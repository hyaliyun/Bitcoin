Background M√≠che√°l √ì Domhnaill co- founded the popular Irish traditional group The Bothy Band in 1974, along with Paddy Glackin (fiddle), Matt Molloy (flute and tin whistle), Paddy Keenan (uilleann pipes and tin whistle), D√≥nal Lunny (bouzouki, guitar, and production), and his sister Tr√≠ona N√≠ Dhomhnaill (harpsichord, clavinet and vocals). √ì Domhnaill met Kevin Burke when Burke replaced Glackin as the fiddler of the band in May 1976. Much of their repertoire was rooted in the traditional music of Ireland, and their enthusiasm and musical virtuosity set a standard for future Irish traditional performers. They recorded three studio albums during their brief career: The Bothy Band (1975), Old Hag You Have Killed Me (1976), and Out of the Wind ‚Äì Into the Sun (1977). A live album After Hours was released in 1979, the year the group disbanded. Production Upon the dissolution of the Bothy Band, √ì Domhnaill and Burke formed a duo, began performing together, and recorded the album Promenade, which was co- produced by √ì Domhnaill and Gerry O'Beirne for Mulligan Records. Composition Promenade consists of traditional songs popular within the Irish traditional music genre. \\"Lafferty's Reel\\" is a song that Burke learned from an album recorded in the 1950s by Paddy Canny and P. J. Hayes. \\"Walsh's Hornpipe\\" is a song from the southwest of Ireland that Burke learned from Jackie Daly. \\"The New Mown Meadow\\" was adapted from a tune called \\"Silver- Spear\\", which Burke first heard played by Mary Fahy in Dublin. \\"Lord Franklin\\" tells the story of British explorer Sir John Franklin, who set off on 18 May 1845 on an expedition with 129 men to find the Northwest Passage sea route through the Arctic Ocean, along the northern coast of North America via waterways through the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, connecting the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. They were lost in their attempt and were never heard from again. After Franklin's ship was stuck in the ice for two years, he died in 1847. The ballad writers set the song in the context of a troubled dream by Lady Jane Franklin, Sir John's widow. \\"Ar A Ghabh√°il Go Baile √Åtha Cliath Domh\\" tells the story of a man whose wife is carried off by fairies who leave in her place a changeling. When the changeling becomes ill, the man sets off to Dublin to find a doctor, but on the way he meets a beautiful woman who turns out to be his real wife. \\"Coinleach Ghlas An Fh√≥mhair\\" is a song of unrequited love from northern Ireland. Reception Promenade has been called \\"one of the finest duets ever recorded in Irish traditional music\\". In contrast to the \\"propulsive power and bracing brinkmanship\\" produced by the Bothy Band, the duo set off on a different musical path that one reviewer from the Irish Echo called \\"soulful finesse\\". The album's centerpiece and single was \\"Lord Franklin\\", which featured √ì Domhnaill's lilting vocals in English. He sang two other songs on the album in Irish. √ì Domhnaill's guitar playing and Burke's Sligo-style Irish fiddling achieved a \\"relaxed vitality\\" through \\"compelling melodies, pulsing Sligo rhythms, intricate variations, and vocal perfection\\". In his review for AllMusic, Steve Winick gave the album three out of five stars, stating that the album was \\"not to be missed\\".

It was founded in 1871 as a privately owned secular cemetery open to the public, but it primarily served the city's African American community. From 1884 to 1885, more than 1,200 bodies were transferred to Graceland Cemetery from Holmead's Burying Ground. When the cemetery encountered financial problems, the owners attempted to sell the land. This led to a lengthy and bitter battle involving the Graceland Cemetery Association, lotholders, the government of the District of Columbia, and the United States Congress. Graceland Cemetery closed by an Act of Congress on August 3, 1894. Removal of remains was also bitterly contested, but a court ruled in the summer of 1895 that the lotholders did not have the right to prevent their removal. Most of the bodies at Graceland were reinterred at Woodlawn Cemetery in Washington, D.C. A portion of Maryland Avenue NE runs through a portion of the former cemetery. Most of the cemetery was purchased by Washington Railway and Electric Company and turned into a powerhouse and streetcar operations complex. This land later became Hechinger Mall. Creation Graceland Cemetery was created due to the need for a large, rural cemetery for African Americans in Washington, D.C., in the late 1800s. At the time, nearly all cemeteries in the city were racially segregated, with whites-only burial grounds refusing to inter black citizens. By 1850, there were 16 cemeteries in the city of Washington, but only three served African Americans: (Eastern Methodist Cemetery, or \\"Old Ebenezer Cemetery\\"; the Harmoneon Cemetery, and Mount Pleasant Plains Cemetery). On June 5, 1852, the D.C. City Council enacted legislation to prohibit interments at any burying ground inside the limits of the Federal City and to ban the establishment of new burial grounds within the Federal City. The city's rapidly increasing African American population desperately needed a new cemetery. In 1870, a group of progressive white citizens decided to buy a plot of land just beyond the border of the Federal City and build a racially integrated cemetery. Graceland Cemetery was chartered by an Act of Congress in Section 5 of the Act of May 5, 1870 (\\"An act to provide for the creation of corporations in the District of Columbia under general law\\", 16 Stat. 106). It was incorporated under the laws of the District of Columbia on September 30, 1871. Two weeks later, on October 16, 1871, the Graceland Cemetery Association acquired for a burying ground on a tract of land bounded by Bladensburg Road NE, K Street NE, 17th Street NE, and Benning Road NE. Operation From 1871 to 1873, Graceland Cemetery was landscaped and numerous trees planted. Winding walkways were laid out through the cemetery's gently rolling hills, and an expensive caretaker's house constructed. The southern half of the property sloped to the south. There were several springs here, and this area was somewhat marshy. The eastern terminus of the Columbia Railway, one of the city's largest streetcar companies, was across the street. The cemetery was on top of a hill, which gave it excellent views of the city and United States Capitol. Graceland Cemetery was governed by a Board of Directors. The board consisted of a president, secretary-treasurer, and three directors. A seven-member Advisory Board was also established to advise the Board of Directors on cemetery operations. The cemetery opened about April 1873. In its first nine months of operation, about 40 burials occurred. Nearly all of these were along the cemetery's southern boundary, which ran along Benning Road. About 42,000 burial lots existed at Graceland. Lot prices were initially held low, to encourage burials. Lot prices ranged from $3 in the marshy southern area to $22 for a prime hilltop site. Burial costs were also low: Opening and closing a grave cost just $4, while handling the body cost $5. (Grave markers, burial vaults, fences, and other improvements cost significantly more.) In comparison, at the highly popular (and almost all-white) Rock Creek Cemetery, opening and closing a grave cost $6.50. Although at times popular with the city's black community, Graceland never quite caught on. The Columbian Harmony Cemetery was the city's most popular African American cemetery, with Payne's Cemetery in the Marshall Heights neighborhood east of the Anacostia River the second most popular. Graceland cemetery was not very popular, however, until 1890. A total of 4,722 African Americans were buried there between 1880 and 1894 (just 4.7 percent of all black burials in the city), but it was the top burying ground for African Americans in 1890 and 1891. At the time it closed, several hundred (perhaps thousands) of as-yet unused burial plots at Graceland were owned by blacks. Although only 1,073 whites were buried at Graceland from 1880 to 1894 (just 0.8 percent of all white burials in the city, this was actually quite a substantial number for a racially integrated cemetery. Nonetheless, by February 1893 there were 5,700 interrals at Graceland. Most of these were in a wide strip along the southern border. Lots here were the cheapest in the cemetery, largely due to its marshy nature. =Complaints about operations= Although Graceland Cemetery was intended to be a rural cemetery, well away from development, housing and other buildings were soon built around it. As early as June 1873, a three-story, 25-room hotel was constructed across the street from Graceland. By January 1878, a large number of new homes had been constructed near the burying ground. The stench of decomposing bodies and the smell and foul taste burials left in the local water supply greatly alarmed local residents, who suffered an outbreak of typhoid in 1877. The D.C. Board of Public Health was worried, too, and it commissioned a study of the cemetery in late 1877 to study the issue. Although the Board found in January 1878 that the cemetery was not responsible for the typhoid outbreak, it expressed its concern that a major burying ground was so near to homes. The complaints did not end, however. In April 1892, a large number of local residents as well as physicians complained about the foul- tasting and smelling water in the vicinity of Graceland Cemetery. More than 200 local residents signed a petition asking the Board of Public Health to close it. Another typhoid outbreak in the summer of 1892 intensified the pressure to close Graceland. Investigation by city health officials found that the soil in the southern part of the cemetery was so marshy that graves often filled with water when dug (and had to be bailed out before a coffin could be lowered). Officials asserted that the graves were also dug too close to one another, so that the walls between graves often collapsed‚Äîallowing germs and disease from a nearby decomposing body to wash into the new, open grave. Eventually, pressure to close the cemetery became so strong that legislation was introduced in the waning days of the 52nd United States Congress to close the cemetery. The D.C. City Commissioners supported the bill, H.B. 9874, which was introduced by Senator Jacob Harold Gallinger (R-New Hampshire) and Representative John J. Hemphill (D-South Carolina). Even The Washington Post editorialized in favor of the bill. The legislation was strongly opposed by Frank Presbrey, the president of Graceland Cemetery, and the Graceland board of directors. The bill died when Congress adjourned on March 3, 1893. With congressional action having, for the time being, failed, city residents pressured the city to act under power granted to the District of Columbia under Joint Resolution 4 of 1892. Section 2 of the Joint Resolution gave the city commissioners broad power to make \\"police regulations\\". But questions were raised as to whether the Joint Resolution actually conferred the power to close Graceland Cemetery (e.g., was closure a police power?) In late March 1893, the D.C. Assistant Attorney said he doubted that closure fell under the general police regulatory power. Closure New legislation to bar further interments at Graceland Cemetery was introduced into the 53rd United States Congress. The House bill was H.R.6915, and the Senate bill (once more sponsored by Senator Gallinger) was S.2245. Once again, the legislation was strongly supported by the city commissioners. The House Committee on the District of Columbia favorably reported the bill on July 5, and the Senate Committee on the District of Columbia followed suit on July 6. The full Senate passed the bill on July 23, and the House on August 3, 1894. Section 1 of the Act revoked the charter of the Graceland Cemetery Association. However, the board of directors was permitted to continue in order that it might carry out the provisions of the law. (It was also permitted to fill vacancies on the board by unanimous vote.) Section 1 also barred any further interments at the burial ground as of the date of enactment. A fine of $100 to $500 was imposed for violations of the law. Section 2 of the Act required the Graceland Cemetery Association to remove all the bodies from the burial ground and reinter them at some other suitable cemetery or cemeteries in the District of Columbia. The board was authorized to subdivide and sell the land for any purpose. Proceeds from the sale were to be used to pay the debts of the cemetery association. Afterward, five percent of the proceeds went to the board of directors as compensation for their services. The remaining funds were then to be distributed among the lotholders on a pro rate basis. Once disbursement was made, the board was ordered to dissolve. Final disposition of Graceland Cemetery An unknown but small number of burials occurred at Graceland Cemetery after its August 3 closure. These occurred after the city government and Graceland Cemetery Association board of directors failed to adequately communicate with the sextons at the cemetery. But no burials were recorded after August 23, 1894. Removing nearly 6,000 bodies from a cemetery was a task never before undertaken in Washington, D.C. Protecting the public health, especially in the wake of complaints going back 15 years, was paramount. On September 5, 1894, the city commissioners adopted health regulations governing the disinterment of bodies at Graceland. The regulations prohibited disinterments in June, July, August, and September (the hottest months of the year, and the months in which corpses would be decomposing most rapidly), and required reinterral within 24 hours. If the deceased had died of diphtheria, the open grave was required to be saturated with chloride of lime and left open for a minimum of 24 hours before the corpse could be removed. The commissioners also moved to ease the grief that some might feel as their loved ones were disinterred. The regulations also prohibited the disinterment of anyone under age of 12 disinterred unless one year had passed since their death. The regulations barring disinterment in the hot months were temporarily rescinded in June 1895, after a lengthy heat wave dried out the marshy ground (making corpses less likely to be in advanced decomposition). (Despite concerns, the dry weather indeed prevented decomposition and there were no odors emanating from the cemetery despite the large number of disinterments). Meanwhile, several of Graceland Cemetery's directors formed the Woodlawn Cemetery Association, which was incorporated on January 8, 1895. They subsequently purchased a plot of land adjacent to Payne's Cemetery across the Anacostia River. Burial plots were quickly laid out on this property, and Woodlawn Cemetery opened on May 13, 1895. =Lawsuit= The disinterment process was not without controversy. On July 1, 1895, a group of lotholders (most of them black) met to protest the removal of bodies from Graceland Cemetery. The meeting was chaired by H.D. Davis, and W.P. Hall was elected secretary. The lotholders had a number of grievances. Many wanted to see Graceland subdivided into building lots rather than sold as a large parcel, for subdivided land would sell at a higher cost. Others did not want to see their loved ones buried at Woodlawn Cemetery (which was denigrated as \\"unenclosed forest and a truck garden\\"), and preferred to receive money from the sale of Graceland now and make the choice of burial location themselves. J. Harry Smith, a local attorney, addressed the lotholders and urged them to sue to protect their rights. The lotholders voted to form the \\"Protective Association of the Lot and Site Owners of Graceland Cemetery\\", and elected Dr. John R. Frances president of the new organization. At a second meeting, held July 9, more than 400 lotholders appeared to support the nascent group. At a second meeting on July 23, the Protective Association voiced its concerns in greater depth. Lotholders had not been given a choice in the selection of a site for the new cemetery, they said. The Graceland board of trustees had merely chosen the cheapest site they could find, cleared only five of the site's , laid out two incomplete roads through the site, and refused to build a receiving vault. Lotholders also complained that Graceland Cemetery had not notified them when bodies were to be disinterred, and refused to tell them where the bodies were being buried at Woodlawn. One lotholder who visited Woodlawn Cemetery claimed that bodies were being interred at a rate of 12 a day there, with graves just apart (side by side and head to foot). Dr. Francis resigned as president of the Protective Association, and Mr. H.A. Davis was elected president. The lotholders adopted a constitution for their association, voted to sue the cemetery, and began raising funds for their lawsuit. The goal of the group was to construct a new cemetery, one ideally located and in a desirable area. The lotholders' lawsuit was initially successful. On August 26, 1895, Judge Louis E. McComas of the D.C. Superior Court issued a temporary injunction against the Graceland Cemetery Association, barring further disinterments. The court gave the association until September 9 to reply to the injunction. The Protective Association alleged in its pleading that some members of the Board of Directors of Graceland had, without the consent or authority of either the lotholders or board of directors, had joined with others to form the Woodlawn Cemetery Association and purchase of land for a new cemetery. The Protective Association also claimed that the Graceland Cemetery Association was removing bodies from Graceland Cemetery without the consent of the lotholders, and without providing them with information on where their loved ones were being reburied. Finally, the Protective Association challenged the Act of August 3, 1894, as an unconstitutional violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Because of District regulations prohibiting the removal of bodies during summer months and the impact of injunction, only 400 bodies had been disinterred from Graceland Cemetery by September 23. The Graceland Cemetery Association replied to the injunction in late September. The cemetery's attorneys asserted before the court that the lotholders did not, in fact, have fee simple title to burial lots, and denied that lotholders were not told when loved ones were disinterred. They acknowledged that some lotholders wanted their family members removed to a burial ground other than Woodlawn Cemetery. They said they were willing to reimburse they lotholders for reasonable disinterment and reinterment costs. The Graceland Cemetery Association won the day, and on October 12, 1895, Edward Franklin Bingham, Chief Justice of the D.C. Supreme Court, dissolved the temporary injunction. =Completion of disinterments= 1899 advertisement announcing the sale of Graceland Cemetery property. As disinterments accelerated through late 1895 and early 1896, Graceland Cemetery began to incur substantial expenses. By the end of 1896, the cemetery had disinterred 637 bodies at a cost of $5,002.57. By January 1897, the cemetery was close to running out of money to continue the process. The cemetery sought to mortgage its property to raise the necessary funds, but lacked the legal authority to do so. It sought the assistance of Congress, and in January 1897 Senator James McMillan and Representative Joseph W. Babcock (R-Wisconsin) sponsored legislation to permit the cemetery to mortgage its land. The House and Senate quickly passed the legislation, and President Grover Cleveland signed it into law on March 3, 1897 (his last day in office). With funds secured, Graceland Cemetery rapidly disinterred the remaining bodies. By early November 1897, nearly all the graves had been emptied. Cemetery officials estimated that disinterals would be finished by January 1, 1898. =Disbursement of funds= The Graceland Cemetery Association put the cemetery up for sale on June 14, 1899. But there were no immediate offers for the land. Some individuals who made down payments on burial plots at Graceland Cemetery were still demanding their money back. But Benjamin Meeds, the cemetery association's secretary, pointed out that the congressional legislation only allowed payments to be made to lotholders‚Äînot those who had made down payments but had never finished purchasing their lots. Meeds said he regretted that these individuals, many of them poor, would lose their down payments. But the law did not permit otherwise. Identifying lotholders proved to be a difficult and time-consuming process. It was not until January 9, 1913, that the board of directors first advertised their willingness to distribute the proceeds from the sale of land to the lotholders. But there was still concern that not all lotholders had been identified. Board members Seymour W. Tullock, Benjamin N. Meeds, Clarence J. Norment, William Tindall, and Odell S. Smith asked Justice Job Barnard of the D.C. Supreme Court for help. The trustees, they said, had made an effort to distribute the proceeds, but were unable to determine who the $115,248.65 should go to. Justice Barnard appointed an auditor to receive claims and make the disbursements. With the cemetery's affairs in the hands of the auditor, the board of directors dissolved. =Post-cemetery use= As expected, the City of Washington pushed several street extensions through the former Graceland Cemetery tract. The most important of these was Maryland Avenue NE. In May 1895, the D.C. city commissioners announced plans to extend Maryland Avenue NE through the former grounds of the burial ground. The city in 1901 asked the cemetery to donate 53 percent of its land for the construction of Maryland Avenue and other streets. But the cemetery refused, arguing that federal law permitted only land sales. The city then offered the cemetery $75,000 to buy the needed land, but the Graceland Cemetery board declined the offer‚Äîarguing the land was worth close to $200,000. It was not until 1936, however, that Maryland Avenue was extended through the property. The city paid $317,500 for land to extend not only Maryland Avenue but also 17th Street and H Street NE. The extension was complete by June 1937. There was also a major effort made to seize the former Graceland Cemetery for use as a public park. In July 1895, the Northeast Citizens Association, an organization of local residents in the area near the cemetery, asked the city to purchase the burying ground and convert it into a public park. Six years later, the citizens' group was still pushing for a park. Movement on a park finally occurred in 1907. H.B. 7354 provided $150,000 to purchase the cemetery for use as a city park. But the city commissioners opposed the plan, arguing that there wasn't enough residential development in the area to justify the move. The bill died at the end of the 59th United States Congress on March 3, 1907. Senator Nathan B. Scott (R-West Virginia) introduced a new bill in the 60th United States Congress. The bill passed the Senate, but died at the end of the 60th Congress on March 3, 1909. The Northeast Citizens Association continued to press for a park in 1909, and Senator Scott introduced a new bill (S.B. 158) in February 1910 in the 61st United States Congress. The Senate approved the bill, which still provided $150,000 for land purchases, in February 1911. But once more, the legislation died when Congress adjourned on March 3, 1911. The final disposition of Graceland Cemetery (and the source of the $115,248.65 disbursed to lotholders) came in 1901. In December, the Washington Railway and Electric Company purchased of land for $26,000. This included a long section of land on 15th Street NE and a long section of land on H Street NE to accommodate a streetcar line extension.; ; ; The square footage reported by The Evening Star newspaper was not the whole story, however. In fact, the railway had purchased the entire property. Only the reported acreage was to be used for streetcar tracks. The rest was to be used for the construction of an electric powerhouse, carhouse, maintenance shop, storehouse, and storage yard. The price paid by the railway totaled $116,155.80.

The training occurred first at a base on Saipan in the Marianas islands but was later moved to a colder mountainous climate at Camp Hale, Colorado. One battalion was trained at Camp Peary, near Williamsburg, Virginia. After the Tibetan operation concluded, Fosmire landed with Tony Poe in Sumatra, Indonesia to supply and train mutinous forces there in an effort by the Eisenhower administration to destabilize the communist-leaning regime of Sukarno. He and Poe were evacuated from Sumatra by US Navy submarine when the troops they were training fled to the mountains. In the late 1960s and early 70s he served in Laos and South Vietnam during the Vietnam War. In the 1980s, Fosmire served in El Salvador and Honduras, training Nicaraguan rebel troops opposed to the Sandanista government. Fosmire was twice awarded the Intelligence Medal of Merit.

He was made chairman of the English National Opera in 2015. Early life, education, and family Br√ºnjes was born in Norwich on 15 October 1954 and grew up around Great Yarmouth, Norfolk. He is the son of Harry Br√ºnjes of The Singing Scott Brothers, who went on to become a headmaster at Alameda School. His mother was also a teacher. He was educated at Bedford Modern School, St Thomas's Hospital Medical School and Guy's Hospital Medical School. During his university career Br√ºnjes worked as a professional pianist and television actor but abandoned entertainment to concentrate on medicine. Br√ºnjes is married to the singer, dancer, choreographer and director Jacqueline Storey. They met while performing together at a show in Newquay. The couple have four children. Emma Brunjes is his daughter. Br√ºnjes and his wife live at Folkington Manor. The couple bought the historic house, a Grade II listed property, in 2010 and then carried out a multi-million pound restoration. The house was opened for public tours in 2014. Br√ºnjes and his wife have restored numerous other properties including Ovingdean Grange. Career Br√ºnjes joined the Rottingdean practice in East Sussex in 1985. He became a senior partner after five years. In 1984 Brunjes was one of the junior hospital doctors in Casualty in the Royal Sussex County Hospital, Brighton on the night of the Grand Hotel IRA bomb blast. In 1995, Br√ºnjes founded what would become Premier Medical Group after working in the NHS for 14 years. He founded Premier after noticing an increasingly large number of patients willing to pay for private healthcare. The practice started in a small office on Harley Street and took on the Premier Medical name in 1996. Br√ºnjes started hiring additional doctors into is practice the same year. Premier continued to expand operations as sales grew. Speaking of the time Br√ºnjes said, \\"It was a stretch financially. I took out loans with the banks and had my house on the line.\\" In 2003, Jason Powell, head of innovation for Bupa, joined Premier as CEO. Br√ºnjes worked with Powell to develop a strategy for further expansion through acquisitions instead of focusing on organic growth. Many of Premier's smaller acquisitions were funded via cash flow. In 2008, Br√ºnjes led Premier's acquisition of Medico-Legal Reporting, a rival firm, with financing from the investment bank Nomura. Under his leadership the firm expanded to run 220 clinics across the United Kingdom. The business was sold in 2010 to Capita for ¬£60 million; Br√ºnjes remained as non- executive chairman after the sale. After the sale of Premier, Br√ºnjes started work on other business opportunities including real estate. Prior to the sale of Premier, he had already spent 13 years restoring a listed manor house; he sold the house to comedian Steve Coogan for ¬£2.4 million. In 2011, Br√ºnjes established Woodsta, a venture capital fund specialising in healthcare. Woodsta acquired Dr Newman's Clinic, which specialises in treating thread veins. Br√ºnjes immediately moved to expand Dr Newman's across the United Kingdom. Br√ºnjes has expressed interest in investing in obesity and elderly care related ventures. Br√ºnjes bought a controlling share of Premier Medical back from Capita in 2016. Capita retained some equity in Premier but has no operational control. Br√ºnjes is working to expand the firm with a particular emphasis on the personal injury market. Since 2015 Brunjes has been Chairman of WARP, a medical software technology company. In recent years Brunjes has performed in a docudrama 'Dial Medicine for Murder'. This has involved two seasons at The Gilded Balloon at the Edinburgh Festival and a national tour. Br√ºnjes is a regular writer, broadcaster, and lecturer. Non-profit work Since 2015, Br√ºnjes has been chairman of English National Opera (ENO). Br√ºnjes was appointed to this position after the resignation of Martyn Rose. Br√ºnjes had previously served on the ENO's board as a non-executive trustee for five years. Since 2012 he has been a member of the Southwark Cathedral Development Trust. He was Chairman of Lancing College from 2009-2019 and was previously a governor of Bedford Modern School (2004‚Äì07).

It is approximately long and flows through Davidson Township. Its watershed has an area of . The stream has a low pH, although that could potentially be remedied. The main rock formations in the area are the Huntley Mountain Formation and the Burgoon Sandstone. The main soil associations in the vicinity of the stream are the Deep-Wellsboro-Oquaga association, the Wellsboro association, the Norwich association, and the Oquaga association. Course Meeker Run begins on a plateau in Davidson Township. It flows south for a short distance before turning east and flowing into a valley. Along the way, it receives an unnamed tributary. At the end of the valley, it reaches its confluence with Heberly Run. Meeker Run joins Heberly Run upstream of its mouth. =Tributaries= Meeker Run has an unnamed tributary known as Unt 28006. Hydrology Meeker Run has a discharge of 320 gallons per minute during average flow conditions. The pH of the stream during average flow conditions is 4.37 and the concentration of aluminum is 0.260 milligrams per liter. It experiences chronic acidification. The water quality of Meeker Run is considered to be \\"severe\\" (a rating worse than \\"very poor\\") in both average and high flow conditions. However, the stream only significantly affects the water quality of Heberly Run during high flow conditions. To be restored to the satisfaction of the East Branch Fishing Creek Restoration Plan, Meeker Run requires an additional alkalinity load of per day. Proposed methods of adding alkalinity to the stream include forest surface liming, as this is the only feasible method, given the difficulty of accessing the stream. A total of of Meeker Run and of its unnamed tributary are considered by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection to be impaired by atmospheric deposition due to pH and metals. The concentration of dissolved organic carbon near the headwaters of Meeker Run is 15.0 milligrams per liter. This is nearly twice as high as any other studied stream in the watershed of East Branch Fishing Creek. Geography and geology The elevation near the mouth of Meeker Run is above sea level. The elevation of the stream's source is between and above sea level. The lower reaches of Meeker Run are on rock of the Huntley Mountain Formation and the upper reaches are on Burgoon Sandstone. Below its unnamed tributary, the stream flows over soil of the Deep-Wellsboro-Oquaga soil association. Upstream of this confluence, it flows over such soil associations as the Wellsboro association, the Oquaga association, and the Norwich association. Another minor soil association is found near its headwaters. Most of the soil in the watershed is strongly acidic. Watershed The watershed of Meeker Run has an area of . There are of streams in the watershed of Meeker Run. Wetlands such as marshes and fens are located in the upper reaches of the Meeker Run watershed. There is a tannic bog on a tributary of the stream. Meeker Run can only be accessed using a four wheel drive. History The restoration of Meeker Run is part of the first phase of the East Branch Fishing Creek Restoration Plan. This phase, which also includes Heberly Run, is estimated to cost $230,000. Meeker Run was first listed as an impaired stream in 2002. As of December 2011 total maximum daily load is scheduled for it in 2015.

Born and raised in rural Illinois, Clark was orphaned at a young age and was adopted by an aunt. He graduated from the University of Illinois in 1890, then supervised a local school. Named an assistant professor at the university in 1893, Clark rose to full professor status in 1900. A favorite of university president Andrew S. Draper, Clark was named dean of the College of Literature in 1900, then dean of undergraduates in 1901. This office was later renamed Dean of Men, making Clark the first to hold the title. Clark was known for his ruthless vigilance over students and was particularly opposed to alcohol and automobiles. However, Clark was a friend to the Greek community in the university, rising to lead the national chapter of Alpha Tau Omega and often supporting the system in the press. He also founded Phi Eta Sigma in 1923. Biography Thomas Arkle Metcalf was born on May 11, 1862, in Marshall County, Illinois. Shortly after his birth, his mother Mary died. His father William then moved the family near Rantoul, Illinois to be closer to other family. However, Thomas' father struggled to make ends meet as a farmer there, as he was only skilled as a coal miner. When William died in 1872, Thomas was adopted by his aunt, Mary Metcalf Clark, taking her adoptive name. Clark worked on the family farm until 1886, when he was able to persuade his adoptive mother to sell the farm and move to nearby Champaign. Clark attended the University of Illinois Academy, a preparatory school for the University of Illinois. He was then admitted to the university and graduated with a bachelor's degree in 1890. During his studies, he worked at The News Gazette. Clark intended to go into politics, but quickly realized that he enjoyed managing campaigns more. Clark's first job was teaching at the Eastside School, where he quickly rose to become principal. In 1893, Clark was offered a position as an assistant professor of rhetoric at the University of Illinois. Two years later he was named an associate professor. In 1895, he was initiated in the Gamma Zeta chapter of Alpha Tau Omega. Clark took classes over two summers at the University of Chicago, then attended Harvard University for a year. With these new credentials, Clark was promoted to full professor and head of the rhetoric department in 1899. Clark became a favorite of university president Andrew S. Draper, and Draper named him Acting Dean of the College of Literature in 1900. The next year, Clark was named Dean of Undergraduates and Assistant to the President, making Clark a member of the school's Council of Administration. Edmund J. James, Draper's successor, kept Clark on as Dean of Undergraduates though the title later changed to Dean of Men. Clark the first to ever hold this title. Clark served as Dean of Men until 1931 despite Stanford University offering him a position as Dean of Men. In exchange for Clark's loyalty, President James expanded Clark's role in the administration. Clark would use his expanded authority to shape the role of fraternities and sororities at the University of Illinois. His first steps were to minimize the influence of the local Theta Nu Epsilon chapter, a secret fraternity. Clark was also heavily involved with official fraternities and worked closely with the L.G. Balfour Company to provide them with hardware. Clark was also a friend of George Banta and was often published in his Greek Exchange magazine. Under Clark's direction, Illinois grew to have one of the largest fraternity and sorority systems in the nation. He also established a Student Publications Board to oversee campus publications. Clark dismissed students caught hazing and established a program personally welcoming freshmen. In 1911, he began a program issuing a handbook to freshmen concerning rules, regulations, and advice. He maintained a vigilant watch on his students through contact with local police, coaches, townspeople, and Pinkerton. By the time of his retirement in August 1931, Clark had greatly expanded the role of Dean of Men, overseeing the Dean of Foreign Students, Assistant Dean of Men, Dean for Freshmen, and Adviser to Student Activities. Clark co-founded the National Association of Student Personnel Administrators in 1919. In 1923, he founded the Phi Eta Sigma honors society. During prohibition, Clark used his fraternity contacts to uncover illegal distribution of alcohol. He would relay some of this information to the Bureau of Prohibition. In 1927, Clark worked with Eliot Ness to combat bootlegging in Champaign-Urbana. Clark also despised automobiles and would expel students caught driving one unless they had an off-campus job. Students believed that Clark operated a spy ring on campus and that he once slid down a fraternity chimney to break up an illegal party. Clark married Alice Broddus, a fellow graduate of Illinois, on August 24, 1896. They had no children. Thomas Clark was Worthy Grand Chief of Alpha Tau Omega from 1918 to 1923, then again from 1929 to 1931. In November 1931, Clark had a tumor removed from his abdomen. The cancer returned the next January. That July, Clark slipped into a coma. He died three days later on July 18, 1932. The national chapter of Alpha Tau Omega presents the Thomas Arkle Clark Award to its most promising seniors.

As a two-year-old, he won one of his first four races before recording his upset win in the Flying Childers and then won a second major prize when taking the Middle Park Stakes. He was rated the second best colt of his generation in Britain. In the following year he was trained in France but failed to win in six races. In all, he won three of his thirteen races between June 1975 and September 1976. He stood as a breeding stallion in Europe and Japan but has not a success. Background Hittite Glory was a \\"powerful, round-bodied, muscular and most impressive looking\\" bay horse with no white markings bred in England by Cleaboy Farms. He was sired by Habitat, an American-bred, British-raced miler who became one of the leading European stallions of the 1970s and 1980s. His other progeny included Habibti, Flying Water, Marwell, Rose Bowl and Steinlen and he was the British Champion broodmare sire on three occasions. Hittite Glory was the second foal of his dam Hazy Idea, a high-class racemare (rated 118 by Timeform) who won the Crookham Stakes in 1969 and the March Stakes in 1970. Both Hazy Idea's sire Hethersett and dam Won't Linger second generation descendants of the broodmare Netherton Maid. As a yearling Hittite Glory was offered for sale and bought for 30,000 guineas by the Indian shipping magnate Ravi Tikkoo. The colt was sent into training with Scobie Breasley at the South Hatch stable near Epsom. Racing career =1975: two-year-old season= Hittite Glory made his debut in the Berkshire Stakes over six furlongs on firm ground at Newbury Racecourse in June and finished fifth, twenty lengths behind the Clive Brittain-trained African Winner. After winning a six furlong maiden race on softer ground on his next appearance, the colt was moved up in class for the Richmond Stakes and finished sixth of the nine runners behind Stand to Reason. In the Gimcrack Stakes at York Racecourse in August Hittite Glory's pretensions to high class were apparently exposed: he swerved exiting the starting stalls and never looked likely to win, finishing eleventh of the fourteen runners behind Music Boy and the somewhat unlucky Stand to Reason. Only five runners contested the Group One Flying Childers Stakes over five furlongs at Doncaster's St Leger meeting in September. Music Boy started the 5/6 favourite ahead of the Norfolk Stakes winner Faliraki on 6/4 with the fillies Western Jewel (runner-up in the Prix Robert Papin) and Alacriter (winner of four races) on 14/1. Hittite Glory, ridden by Frankie Durr, was given no realistic chance and started the complete outsider of the quintet on 100/1. Racing on better ground than in his last two races, Hittite Glory started well but was last of the five runners behind Music Boy at half way, with Durr apparently working hard to keep pace with the others. In the final quarter mile however, the colt produced a sustained run and caught Music Boy in the closing stages to win by a neck. There was a gap of two and a half lengths back to Western Jewel, who was in turn six lengths clear of Faliraki, with Alacriter a further five lengths back in last place. The independent Timeform organisation rejected claims that the result had been a \\"fluke\\", stating their view that he had won the race on merit. Since the introduction of the Group race system in 1971, the only other horse to have won such a race at odds of 100/1 has been Sole Power in the 2010 Nunthorpe Stakes.http://www.thefreelibrary.com/2010+RECORD+BREAKERS%3B+REVIEW+OF+THE+YEAR.-a0245337353 Hittite Glory was treated more seriously when he contested the Middle Park Stakes over six furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse in October, starting at odds of 9/2. The Vincent O'Brien-trained Folmar (winner of the Tyros Stakes) was made favourite, whilst the other contenders included Royal Boy (Mill Reef Stakes) and Duke Ellington (Harry Rosebery Trophy). Hittite Glory started poorly and was still in last place and looking unlikely to find space to run with a quarter mile to run. In a rough finish, Durr drove the colt through a narrow gap on the inside, hampering Royal Boy in the process, and was then in turn bumped by Duke Ellington. He gained the advantage in the last strides and prevailed by a short head from Duke Ellington with the outsider Patris a length away in third. Timeform stated that he would have won more decisively with a clear run. Later that month, at the same course, Hittite Glory attempted to become the first Middle Park Stakes winner since Lemberg in 1909 to follow up with a victory in the seven-furlong Dewhurst Stakes. Racing on firmer ground, he fought against Durr's attempts to restrain him in the early stages and never looked likely to win, finishing fifth of the seven runners behind Wollow. =1976: three-year-old season= For the 1976 season Ravi Tikkoo transferred his horses to France where they were trained by Breasley at Chantilly. Hittite Glory ran six times, but failed to recover his two-year-old form. On his debut he finished seventh to The Chaplain when carrying top weight in the Prix Montenica over 1500 metres at Maisons-Laffitte Racecourse. In the Poule d'Essai des Poulains over 1600 metres at Longchamp Racecourse on 25 April he finished last of the eleven runners behind Red Lord and thereafter reverted to sprint distances. He returned to England for the King's Stand Stakes at Royal Ascot in June and produced his best performance of the season, staying on well after being outpaced in the early stages to finish third behind Lochnager and Realty. His form subsequently deteriorated: he finished last in the July Cup, ninth in the William Hill Sprint Championship in August and ninth in the Prix de Seine-et-Oise at Maisons-Laffitte on 20 September. Assessment There was no International Classification of European two-year- olds in 1975: the official handicappers of Britain, Ireland and France compiled separate rankings for horses which competed in those countries. In the British Free Handicap, Hittite Glory was rated the second-best two-year- old of the season, five pounds behind the top-rated Wollow. The independent Timeform organisation gave him a rating of 125, two pounds behind Wollow and five behind their top-rated juvenile Manado. In their annual Racehorses of 1975, Timeform described him as looking \\"every inch a high-class sprinter\\" and noting that he had a clear preference for good ground. In the following year he was rated 119 by Timeform, who commented in their annual Racehorses of 1976 that the colts moderate performances had left him with a \\"badly tarnished reputation\\" but said that \\"on his day he was a very good horse\\". Stud record Hittite Glory was retired from racing at the end of his three-year- old season and was syndicated for ¬£4,000 a share, giving him a theoretical value of ¬£160,000. He began his career as a breeding stallion at the New England Stud in Newmarket at a fee of ¬£1,200. He made little impact as a sire of winners and was exported to Japan in 1983. His last recorded foal was born in 1989. The best of his offspring was probably Past Glories, who finished third in the Champion Hurdle and became a successful National Hunt sire.

The San Francisco- based band's lyrics discuss topics such as veganism, feminism and addiction, and also shares members with the bands Loma Prieta and Living Eyes. Punch co- released several EPs and LPs through local indie labels 625 Thrashcore and Discos Huelga before signing to Jacob Bannon's (Converge, Supermachiner) label Deathwish Inc. in 2011. Live at Best Friends Day, 2011 Punch guitarist Keeth began writing for the band's third studio album in late 2013, and the full group came together in early 2014. Punch entered the studio with Jack Shirley (Deafheaven, Joyce Manor) and recorded a new album in three days in March/April 2014. Vocalist Meghan O'Neil described the band's mindset while writing the album: \\"This may sound weird, but we came into this one differently by saying to ourselves 'this is going to be our best record.' Just believing that and putting the extra time in to practice and tweak the songs. I also slightly changed my vocal approach and was happy with the results.\\" The album, titled They Don't Have to Believe, was released on August 19, 2014 through Deathwish. O'Neil said the title was derived from Kathleen Hanna's (Bikini Kill, Le Tigre) speech at the end of the 2013 documentary film The Punk Singer. She said the title is \\"an ode to being unapologetically yourself,\\" and in the film's speech, Hanna said: \\"she doesn't expect everyone to understand or believe in feminism or her personal battle with illness, but they should have to stay out of her way.\\" They Don't Have to Believe was well received by music critics, and peaked at number 50 on Billboard's Top Heatseekers chart. Only a couple of weeks after the release of They Don't Have to Believe, O'Neil left the band in September 2014. After Punch, O'Neil joined a new band called Super Unison (named after a Drive Like Jehu song) in late 2014, and released a self-titled EP in May 2015.

It began on 13 July 2014 as part of a series of operations dubbed \\"Libya Dawn\\" or \\" ŸÅÿ¨ÿ± ŸÑŸäÿ®Ÿäÿß\\" by a coalition of islamist militias whom led a coup d'√©tat operation against the House of Representatives (Libya) due to the 2014 Libyan parliamentary election and a series of operations to recapture the Airport and political institutions to wrest control over the capital of Tripoli. The battle ended in August 2014 with the capture of the Airport and ultimately its destruction. The battle was fought between an Islamist New General National Congress and the Zintani brigades. Background Situation in Tripoli mid June 2014; airport is further south The Zintani Brigades had provided security for Tripoli International Airport since the 2011 War which overthrew Gadhafi. After the defeat of Islamist politicians in the 2014 Libyan parliamentary election, the Libya Revolutionaries Operations Room and Misrata Brigades were faced with a largely anti-Islamist parliament. Their most powerful political ally, Nouri Abusahmain, was faced with an imminent loss of power, and they were likely to lose funding from the General National Congress. The anti-Islamist politicians who won the 2014 elections had previously tried to disband the Libya Revolutionaries Operations Room due to its attempted coup in 2013, and were able to do so after the election results. Combatants The New General National Congress coalition, dubbed operation Libya Dawn was composed of the Libya Revolutionaries Operations Room included the following groups: *Misrata's Al Somood batallion led by Salah Badi *Ghnewa battalion led by Abdul Ghani Al-Kikli, *Al-Qabra battalion led by Suleiman Al Shatwan. *Supported by Qatari and Turkish military training, Intelligence and arms support. The Zintani-led brigades consisted of the following groups: *Al-Qaqa battalion led by Maj.Gen. Othman Al Mulaitaqa *Al-Sawa'iq battalion led by Imad Mustafa Traboulsi *Members of Warshefana battalions. *Received materiel and Air support from the Libyan National Army Events On 13 July the Libya Dawn coalition launched their operation to seize the airport. Many aircraft were destroyed on the ground. The operation received public support from Grand Mufti Sadiq Al-Ghariani. On 23 August 2014, Zintani forces withdrew from the airport. They claimed that they withdrew because they had been instructed to do so by the parliament. This was later confirmed by parliamentary sources. Aftermath In the immediate aftermath of the battle, large fires and plumes of smoke arose from 4 large kerosene fuel containers that were struck by rocket attacks, polluting the surrounding grounds and the air quality. Roads infrastructure on the exterior of the airport facility was damaged as well as inside the airport with mortar explosions and shrapnel. Residential areas near to the airport were also damaged in the fighting, as some residences were used in the fighting as firing positions by all involved parties. Residential areas surrounding the airport were also damaged during the battle, mostly from light weapons 7.62x32, heavy weapons damage from zsu-23-2 projectiles, RPG-7 and on rare occasions larger damage from T-72 rounds. There have been reports of violations against civilians, and GRAD rocket systems being used on civilian residential areas, with civilians caught in the crossfire despite many of them being displaced. The airport main reception and customs building succumbed to catastrophic fire damage after an intense assault was launched by Islamist Libya Dawn and Al Somood militias to capture the facility during the final days of the battle which resulted in the defending Zintani forces withdrawing from the airport. The entirety of the interior of the reception building that housed offices and processing areas, containing flammable materials completely burned off, rendering the mail building unusable. The assault on the airport and deteriorating security in Libya, prompted UN agencies to relocate its staff to neighboring countries. UNSMIL \\"United Nations Support Mission in Libya\\" to condemn the violence and the destruction of Civilian infrastructure., resulting in the UN to reiterate its support for a civilian government within Libya and strongly condemned attacks on civilians and infrastructure by adapting resolution 2174(2014), including later placing sanctions on Salah Badi in 2018 for his roles in the assault on Tripoli Airport. More than 20 civilian aircraft were damaged or destroyed, of which 13 belonged to Afriqiyah Airways and 7 belonged to Lufthansa. The Airport's air traffic control tower, radar, four major fuel storage containers, main customs and reception building and terminals were destroyed. On August 6, 2014, Amnesty International, UNSMIL and OHCHR reported a civilian death toll of 214 and 981 injured due to indiscriminate shelling and violence inflicted by militias.OHCHR and UNSMIL reported that: Financial losses suffered by the Airline Sector in Libya were roughly estimated to be around $3.5 billion for the destroyed aircraft alone, in addition to huge sums in damage incurred on the airport facility amounting to an estimated $US 70 million dollars for 90% of the facility's destruction. Libyan Airlines a state owned company reported that its losses amounted to $US 200 million reported by its Manager, Ahmed Al Qadiri in a Statement to The New Arab news agency. On July 13th, 2014, The Zintani forces within the airport withdrew on Orders from the parliament thus ending the battle at the airport. On September 8th 2014, Human rights watch released a statement condemning violence by both main Militia parties and stated that actions taken by Militias may amount to war crimes. By April 2019, the non-functional Tripoli international Airport was captured by the Libyan National Army and is used as a strategic staging ground for the LNA operation against Libya Dawn Islamist in Tripoli. The airport changed hands when Libya's UN-backed Government of National Accord (GNA) declared itself in full control of Tripoli after recapturing the capital's airport on 04th June 2020 with intensified military support from Turkish government forces, who drove Gen Haftar's forces back from the frontlines.

Light-front quantization uses light- front (or light-cone) coordinates to select an initial surface that is tangential to the light cone. Equal-time quantization uses an initial surface that is horizontal, labeled here as the \\"hypersurface of the present\\". The light front quantization of quantum field theories provides a useful alternative to ordinary equal-time quantization. In particular, it can lead to a relativistic description of bound systems in terms of quantum-mechanical wave functions. The quantization is based on the choice of light-front coordinates, where x^+\\\\equiv ct+z plays the role of time and the corresponding spatial coordinate is x^-\\\\equiv ct-z. Here, t is the ordinary time, z is one Cartesian coordinate, and c is the speed of light. The other two Cartesian coordinates, x and y, are untouched and often called transverse or perpendicular, denoted by symbols of the type \\\\vec x_\\\\perp = (x,y). The choice of the frame of reference where the time t and z-axis are defined can be left unspecified in an exactly soluble relativistic theory, but in practical calculations some choices may be more suitable than others. The basic formalism is discussed elsewhere. There are many applications of this technique, some of which are discussed below. Essentially, the analysis of any relativistic quantum system can benefit from the use of light-front coordinates and the associated quantization of the theory that governs the system.  Nuclear reactions  The light-front technique was brought into nuclear physics by the pioneering papers of Frankfurt and Strikman. The emphasis was on using the correct kinematic variables (and the corresponding simplifications achieved) in making correct treatments of high-energy nuclear reactions. This sub-section focuses on only a few examples. Calculations of deep inelastic scattering from nuclei require knowledge of nucleon distribution functions within the nucleus. These functions give the probability that a nucleon of momentum p carries a given fraction y of the plus component of the nuclear momentum, P, y=p^+/P^+. Nuclear wave functions have been best determined using the equal-time framework. It therefore seems reasonable to see if one could re-calculate nuclear wave functions using the light front formalism. There are several basic nuclear structure problems which must be handled to establish that any given method works. It is necessary to compute the deuteron wave function, solve mean-field theory (basic nuclear shell model) for infinite nuclear matter and for finite-sized nuclei, and improve the mean-field theory by including the effects of nucleon- nucleon correlations. Much of nuclear physics is based on rotational invariance, but manifest rotational invariance is lost in the light front treatment. Thus recovering rotational invariance is very important for nuclear applications. The simplest version of each problem has been handled. A light- front treatment of the deuteron was accomplished by Cooke and Miller, which stressed recovering rotational invariance. Mean-field theory for finite nuclei was handled Blunden et al. Infinite nuclear matter was handled within mean- field theory and also including correlations. Applications to deep inelastic scattering were made by Miller and Smith. The principal physics conclusion is that the EMC effect (nuclear modification of quark distribution functions) cannot be explained within the framework of conventional nuclear physics. Quark effects are needed. Most of these developments are discussed in a review by Miller. There is a new appreciation that initial and final-state interaction physics, which is not intrinsic to the hadron or nuclear light- front wave functions, must be addressed in order to understand phenomena such as single-spin asymmetries, diffractive processes, and nuclear shadowing. This motivates extending LFQCD to the theory of reactions and to investigate high- energy collisions of hadrons. Standard scattering theory in Hamiltonian frameworks can provide valuable guidance for developing a LFQCD-based analysis of high-energy reactions.  Exclusive processes  One of the most important areas of application of the light-front formalism are exclusive hadronic processes. \\"Exclusive processes\\" are scattering reactions in which the kinematics of the initial state and final state particles are measured and thus completely specified; this is in contrast to \\"inclusive\\" reactions where one or more particles in the final state are not directly observed. Prime examples are the elastic and inelastic form factors measured in the exclusive lepton-hadron scattering processes such as e p \\\\to e^\\\\prime p^\\\\prime. In inelastic exclusive processes, the initial and final hadrons can be different, such as e p \\\\to e^\\\\prime \\\\Delta^+ . Other examples of exclusive reactions are Compton scattering \\\\gamma p \\\\to \\\\gamma^\\\\prime p^\\\\prime, pion photoproduction \\\\gamma p \\\\to \\\\pi^+ n and elastic hadron scattering such as \\\\pi^+ p \\\\to {\\\\pi^+}^\\\\prime p^\\\\prime. \\"Hard exclusive processes\\" refer to reactions in which at least one hadron scatters to large angles with a significant change in its transverse momentum. Exclusive processes provide a window into the bound-state structure of hadrons in QCD as well as the fundamental processes which control hadron dynamics at the amplitude level. The natural calculus for describing the bound-state structure of relativistic composite systems, needed for describing exclusive amplitudes, is the light-front Fock expansion which encodes the multi-quark, gluonic, and color correlations of a hadron in terms of frame-independent wave functions. In hard exclusive processes, in which hadrons receive a large momentum transfer, perturbative QCD leads to factorization theorems which separate the physics of hadronic bound-state structure from that of the relevant quark and gluonic hard-scattering reactions which underlie these reactions. At leading twist, the bound-state physics is encoded in terms of universal \\"distribution amplitudes\\", the fundamental theoretical quantities which describe the valence quark substructure of hadrons as well as nuclei. Nonperturbative methods, such as AdS/QCD, Bethe-Salpeter methods, discretized light-cone quantization, and transverse lattice methods, are now providing nonperturbative predictions for the pion distribution amplitude. A basic feature of the gauge theory formalism is color transparency\\", the absence of initial and final-state interactions of rapidly moving compact color-singlet states. Other applications of the exclusive factorization analysis include semileptonic B meson decays and deeply virtual Compton scattering, as well as dynamical higher-twist effects in inclusive reactions. Exclusive processes place important constraints on the light-front wave functions of hadrons in terms of their quark and gluon degrees of freedom as well as the composition of nuclei in terms of their nucleon and mesonic degrees of freedom. The form factors measured in the exclusive reaction e H \\\\to e H^\\\\prime encode the deviations from unity of the scattering amplitude due to the hadron's compositeness. Hadronic form factors fall monotonically with spacelike momentum transfer, since the amplitude for the hadron to remain intact continually decreases. One can also distinguish experimentally whether the spin orientation (helicity) of a hadron such as the spin-1/2 proton changes during the scattering or remains the same, as in the Pauli (spin-flip) and Dirac (spin-conserving) form factors. The electromagnetic form factors of hadrons are given by matrix elements of the electromagnetic current such as F_H(q^2) = where q^\\\\mu is the momentum four- vector of the exchanged virtual photon and H(p) > is the eigenstate for hadron H with four momentum p^\\\\mu. It is convenient to choose the light-front frame where q^+=0, q_\\\\perp =Q, q^- = \\\\frac{2q \\\\cdot p}{P^+} with q^2_\\\\perp = Q^2 = - q^2. The elastic and inelastic form factors can then be expressed as integrated overlaps of the light-front Fock eigenstate wave functions \\\\Psi_H(x_i, \\\\vec k_\\\\perp, \\\\lambda_i) and \\\\Psi_H(x_i, \\\\vec k^\\\\prime_\\\\perp, \\\\lambda_i) of the initial and final-state hadrons, respectively. The x of the struck quark is unchanged, and k_\\\\perp^\\\\prime = \\\\vec k_\\\\perp + (1-x_i) \\\\vec q_\\\\perp . The unstruck (spectator) quarks have \\\\vec k_\\\\perp^\\\\prime = \\\\vec k_\\\\perp - x_1 \\\\vec q_\\\\perp. The result of the convolution gives the form factor exactly for all momentum transfer when one sums over all Fock states of the hadron. The frame choice q^+=0 is chosen since it eliminates off-diagonal contributions where the number of initial and final state particles differ; it was originally discovered by Drell and Yan and by West. The rigorous formulation in terms of light-front wave functions is given by Brodsky and Drell. Light-front wave functions are frame-independent, in contrast to ordinary instant form wave functions which need to be boosted from p to p+q, a difficult dynamical problem, as emphasized by Dirac. Worse, one must include contributions to the current matrix element where the external photon interacts with connected currents arising from vacuum fluctuations in order to obtain the correct frame-independent result. Such vacuum contributions do not arise in the light-front formalism, because all physical lines have positive k^+; the vacuum has only k^+=0, and + momentum is conserved. At large momentum transfers, the elastic helicity-conserving form factors fall-off as the nominal power F_H(Q^2) \\\\propto \\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{Q^2 }\\\\right)^{n-1} where n is the minimum number of constituents. For example, n=3 for the three-quark Fock state of the proton. This \\"quark counting rule\\" or \\"dimensional counting rule\\" holds for theories such as QCD in which the interactions in the Lagrangian are scale invariant (conformal). This result is a consequence of the fact that form factors at large momentum transfer are controlled by the short distance behavior of the hadron's wave function which in turn is controlled by the \\"twist\\" (dimension - spin) of the leading interpolating operator which can create the hadron at zero separation of the constituents. The rule can be generalized to give the power-law fall-off of inelastic form factors and form factors in which the hadron spin changes between the initial and final states. It can be derived nonperturbatively using gauge/string theory duality and with logarithmic corrections from perturbative QCD. In the case of elastic scattering amplitudes, such as K^+ p \\\\to K^+p, the dominant physical mechanism at large momentum transfer is the exchange of the u quark between the K^+(u \\\\bar s) kaon and the proton (uud). This amplitude can be written as a convolution of the four initial and final state light-front valence Fock-state wave functions. It is convenient to express the amplitude in terms of Mandelstam variables, where, for a reaction A+ B \\\\to C + D with momenta P_X, the variables are s= (P_A+ P_B)^2 = E_{CM}^2, t = (P_D+ P_B)^2, u = (P_A- P_D)^2. The resulting \\"quark interchange\\" amplitude has the leading form M \\\\propto \\\\frac{1}{u t^2} which agrees well with the angular dependence and power law fall-off of the amplitude with momentum transfer p^2_T =\\\\frac{ tu}{s} at fixed CM angle \\\\cos \\\\theta_{CM} =\\\\frac{ t-u }{ 2 s}. The \\\\frac{1}{u} behavior of the amplitude, at fixed but large momentum transfer squared t, shows that the intercept of Regge amplitudes u^\\\\alpha(t) \\\\to -1 at large negative t. The nominal power-law s^{-8} fall-off of the resulting hard exclusive scattering cross section for K^+ p \\\\to K^+ p at fixed CM angle is consistent with the dimensional counting rule for hard elastic scattering \\\\frac{d\\\\sigma}{dt} (A+B \\\\to C+D) \\\\propto \\\\frac{F(\\\\theta_{CM}}{ s^{n_A + n_B + n_C + n_D -2}}, where n_A is the minimum number of constituents. More generally, the amplitude for a hard exclusive reaction in QCD can be factorized at leading power as a product of the hard-scattering subprocess quark scattering amplitude T, where the hadrons are each replaced with their constituent valence quarks or gluons, with their respective light-front momenta k^+ = x_i P^+, \\\\vec k_\\\\perp = x_i \\\\vec P_\\\\perp convoluted with the \\"distribution amplitude\\" \\\\phi_H(x_i, Q) for each initial and final hadron. The hard-scattering amplitude can then be computed systematically in perturbative QCD from the fundamental quark and gluon interactions of QCD. This factorization procedure can be carried out systematically since the effective QCD running coupling \\\\alpha_s(q^2) becomes small at high momentum transfer, because of the asymptotic freedom property of QCD. The physics of each hadron enters through its distribution amplitudes \\\\phi_H(x_i, Q), which specifies the partitioning of the light-front momenta of the valence constituents x_i = \\\\frac{k^+_i}{P^+}. It is given in light-cone gauge A^+=0 as \\\\Pi_i \\\\int^Q d^2\\\\vec k_{\\\\perp i} \\\\psi_H(x_i, \\\\vec k_{\\\\perp i } ), the integral of the valence light-front wave function over the internal transverse momentum squared k^2_\\\\perp < Q^2; the upper limit Q^2 is the characteristic transverse momentum in the exclusive reaction. The logarithmic evolution of the distribution amplitude in \\\\log Q^2 is given rigorously in perturbative QCD by the ERBL evolution equation. The results are also consistent with general principles such as the renormalization group. The asymptotic behavior of the distribution such as \\\\phi_\\\\pi \\\\to \\\\sqrt 3 f_\\\\pi x(1-x) where f_\\\\pi is the decay constant measured in pion decay \\\\pi^+ \\\\to W^* \\\\to \\\\mu^+ u_\\\\mu can also be determined from first principles. The nonperturbative form of the hadron light-front wave function and distribution amplitude can be determined from AdS/QCD using light-front holography. The deuteron distribution amplitude has five components corresponding to the five different color-singlet combinations of six color triplet quarks, only one of which is the standard nuclear physics product d \\\\to n p of two color singlets. It obeys a 5 \\\\times 5 evolution equation leading to equal weighting of the five components of the deuteron's light-front wave function components at Q^2 \\\\to \\\\infty. The new degrees of freedom are called \\"hidden color\\". Each hadron emitted from a hard exclusive reaction emerges with high momentum and small transverse size. A fundamental feature of gauge theory is that soft gluons decouple from the small color- dipole moment of the compact fast-moving color-singlet wave function configurations of the incident and final-state hadrons. The transversely compact color-singlet configurations can persist over a distance of order E_{\\\\rm lab} / Q^2, the Ioffe coherence length. Thus, if we study hard quasi elastic processes in a nuclear target, the outgoing and ingoing hadrons will have minimal absorption - a novel phenomenon called \\"color transparency\\". This implies that quasi-elastic hadron-nucleon scattering at large momentum transfer can occur additively on all of the nucleons in a nucleus with minimal attenuation due to elastic or inelastic final state interactions in the nucleus, i.e. the nucleus becomes transparent. In contrast, in conventional Glauber scattering, one predicts nearly energy-independent initial and final- state attenuation. Color transparency has been verified in many hard- scattering exclusive experiments, particularly in the diffractive dijet experiment \\\\pi A \\\\to Jet Jet A^\\\\prime at Fermilab. This experiment also provides a measurement of the pion's light-front valence wave function from the observed x and transverse momentum dependence of the produced dijets.  Light-front holography  One of the most interesting recent advances in hadron physics has been the application to QCD of a branch of string theory, Anti-de Sitter/Conformal Field Theory (AdS/CFT). Although QCD is not a conformally invariant field theory, one can use the mathematical representation of the conformal group in five-dimensional anti-de Sitter space to construct an analytic first approximation to the theory. The resulting model, called AdS/QCD, gives accurate predictions for hadron spectroscopy and a description of the quark structure of mesons and baryons which has scale invariance and dimensional counting at short distances, together with color confinement at large distances. \\"Light-Front Holography\\" refers to the remarkable fact that dynamics in AdS space in five dimensions is dual to a semiclassical approximation to Hamiltonian theory in physical 3+1 space-time quantized at fixed light-front time. Remarkably, there is an exact correspondence between the fifth-dimension coordinate of AdS space and a specific impact variable \\\\zeta^2_\\\\perp= b^2_\\\\perp x(1-x) which measures the physical separation of the quark constituents within the hadron at fixed light-cone time \\\\tau and is conjugate to the invariant mass squared {M^2_{q \\\\bar q} }. This connection allows one to compute the analytic form of the frame-independent simplified light-front wave functions for mesons and baryons that encode hadron properties and allow for the computation of exclusive scattering amplitudes. In the case of mesons, the valence Fock-state wave functions of H_{LF} for zero quark mass satisfy a single-variable relativistic equation of motion in the invariant variable \\\\zeta^2=b^2_\\\\perp x(1-x), which is conjugate to the invariant mass squared {M^2_{q \\\\bar q} }. The effective confining potential U(\\\\zeta^2) in this frame-independent \\"light-front Schr√∂dinger equation\\" systematically incorporates the effects of higher quark and gluon Fock states. Remarkably, the potential has a unique form of a harmonic oscillator potential if one requires that the chiral QCD action remains conformally invariant. The result is a nonperturbative relativistic light-front quantum mechanical wave equation which incorporates color confinement and other essential spectroscopic and dynamical features of hadron physics. These recent developments concerning AdS/CFT duality provide new insights about light-front wave functions which may form first approximations to the full solutions that one seeks in LFQCD, and be considered as a step in building a physically motivated Fock-space basis set to diagonalize the LFQCD Hamiltonian, as in the basis light-front quantization (BLFQ) method.  Prediction of the cosmological constant  A major outstanding problem in theoretical physics is that most quantum field theories predict a huge value for the quantum vacuum. Such arguments are usually based on dimensional analysis and effective field theory. If the universe is described by an effective local quantum field theory down to the Planck scale, then we would expect a cosmological constant of the order of M_{\\\\rm pl}^4. As noted above, the measured cosmological constant is smaller than this by a factor of 10‚àí120. This discrepancy has been called \\"the worst theoretical prediction in the history of physics!\\". A possible solution is offered by light front quantization, a rigorous alternative to the usual second quantization method. Vacuum fluctuations do not appear in the Light-Front vacuum state,.H.

Chiral magnetism (or magnetohadrochironics) Phys. Rev. D9 (1974) 436 DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevD.9.436 This absence means that there is no contribution from QED, Weak interactions and QCD to the cosmological constant which is thus predicted to be zero in a flat space-time.S. J. Brodsky and R. Shrock. Condensates in Quantum Chromodynamics and the Cosmological Constant. Proc.Nat.Acad.Sci. 108 (2011) 45-50, [arXiv:0905.1151]. The measured small non-zero value of the cosmological constant could originate for example from a slight curvature of the shape of the universe (which is not excluded within 0.4% (as of 2017)) since a curved-space could modify the Higgs field zero- mode, thereby possibly producing a non-zero contribution to the cosmological constant.  Intense lasers  High-intensity laser facilities offer prospects for directly measuring previously unobserved processes in QED, such as vacuum birefringence, photon-photon scattering and, still some way in the future, Schwinger pair production. Furthermore, \`light-shining-through-walls' experiments can probe the low energy frontier of particle physics and search for beyond-standard-model particles. These possibilities have led to great interest in the properties of quantum field theories, in particular QED, in background fields describing intense light sources, and some of the fundamental predictions of the theory have been experimentally verified. Despite the basic theory behind \`strong-field QED' having been developed over 40 years ago, there have remained until recent years several theoretical ambiguities that can in part be attributed to the use of the instant-form in a theory which, because of the laser background, naturally singles out light- like directions. Thus, light-front quantization is a natural approach to physics in intense laser fields. The use of the front-form in strong-field QED has provided answers to several long standing questions, such as the nature of the effective mass in a laser pulse, the pole structure of the background- dressed propagator, and the origins of classical radiation reaction within QED. Combined with nonperturbative approaches such as \`time dependent basis light-front quantization', which is specifically targeted at time-dependent problems in field theory, the front-form promises to provide a better understanding of QED in external fields. Such investigations will also provide groundwork for understanding QCD physics in strong magnetic fields at, for example, RHIC.  Nonperturbative quantum field theory  Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), the theory of strong interactions, is a part of the Standard Model of elementary particles that also includes, besides QCD, the theory of electro-weak (EW) interactions. In view of the difference in strength of these interactions, one may treat the EW interactions as a perturbation in systems consisting of hadrons, the composite particles that respond to the strong interactions. Perturbation theory has its place in QCD also, but only at large values of the transferred energy or momentum where it exhibits the property of asymptotic freedom. The field of perturbative QCD is well developed and many phenomena have been described using it, such as factorization, parton distributions, single-spin asymmetries, and jets. However, at low values of the energy and momentum transfer, the strong interaction must be treated in a nonperturbative manner, since the interaction strength becomes large and the confinement of quarks and gluons, as the partonic components of the hadrons, cannot be ignored. There is a wealth of data in this strong interaction regime that is waiting for explanation in terms of calculations proceeding directly from the underlying theory. As one prominent application of an ab initio approach to QCD, many extensive experimental programs either measure directly, or depend upon the knowledge of, the probability distributions of the quark and gluon components of the hadrons. Three approaches have produced considerable success in the strong- coupling area up to the present. First, hadronic models have been formulated and applied successfully. This success comes sometimes at the price of introducing parameters that need to be identified quantitatively. For example, the Relativistic String Hamiltonian depends on the current quark masses, the string tension, and a parameter corresponding to \\\\Lambda_{\\\\rm QCD}. The second method, lattice QCD, is an ab initio approach directly linked to the Lagrangian of QCD. Based on a Euclidean formulation, lattice QCD provides an estimate of the QCD path integral and opens access to low-energy hadronic properties such as masses. Although lattice QCD can estimate some observables directly, it does not provide the wave functions that are needed for the description of the structure and dynamics of hadrons. Third is the Dyson‚ÄîSchwinger approach. It is also formulated in Euclidean space-time and employs models for vertex functions. The light-front Hamiltonian approach is a fourth approach, which, in contrast to the lattice and Dyson-Schwinger approaches, is developed in Minkowski space and deals directly with wave functions - the main objects of quantum theory. Unlike the modeling approach, it is rooted in the fundamental Lagrangian of QCD. Any field-theoretical Hamiltonian H does not conserve the number of particles. Therefore, in the basis, corresponding to fixed number of particles, it is a non-diagonal matrix. Its eigenvector‚Äîthe state vector of a physical system‚Äîis an infinite superposition (Fock decomposition) of the states with different numbers of particles:  p \\\\rangle = \\\\sum_{n=1}^{\\\\infty} \\\\int \\\\psi_n(k_1,\\\\ldots,k_n,p) n \\\\rangle D_k. \\\\psi_n is the n-body wave function (Fock component) and D_k is an integration measure. In light-front quantization, the Hamiltonian H and the state vector  p\\\\rangle here are defined on the light-front plane. In many cases, though not always, one can expect that a finite number of degrees of freedom dominates, that is, the decomposition in the Fock components converges enough quickly. In these cases the decomposition can be truncated, so that the infinite sum can be approximately replaced by a finite one. Then, substituting the truncated state vector in the eigenvector equation H  p \\\\rangle=M  p \\\\rangle, one obtains a finite system of integral equations for the Fock wave functions \\\\psi_n which can be solved numerically. Smallness of the coupling constant is not required. Therefore, the truncated solution is nonperturbative. This is the basis of a nonperturbative approach to the field theory which was developed and, for the present, applied to QED and to the Yukawa model. The main difficulty in this way is to ensure cancellation of infinities after renormalization. In the perturbative approach, for a renormalizable field theory, in any fixed order of coupling constant, this cancellation is obtained as a by-product of the renormalization procedure. However, to ensure the cancellation, it is important to take into account the full set of graphs at a given order. Omitting some of these graphs destroys the cancellation and the infinities survive after renormalization. This is what happens after truncation of the Fock space; though the truncated solution can be decomposed into an infinite series in terms of the coupling constant, at any given order the series does not contain the full set of perturbative graphs. Therefore, the standardrenormalization scheme does not eliminate infinities. In the approach of Brodsky et al. the infinities remain uncanceled, though it is expected that as soon as the number of sectors kept after truncation increases, the domain of stability of the results relative to the cutoff also increases. The value on this plateau of stability is just an approximation to the exact solution which is taken as the physical value. The sector-dependent approach is constructed so as to restore cancellation of infinities for any given truncation. The values of the counterterms are constructed from sector to sector according to unambiguously formulated rules. The numerical results for the anomalous magnetic moment of fermion in the truncation keeping three Fock sectors are stable relative to increase of the cutoff. However, the interpretation of the wave functions, due to negative norm of the Pauli-Villars states introduced for regularization, becomes problematic. When the number of sectors increases, the results in both schemes should tend to each other and approach to the exact nonperturbative solution. The light-front coupled-cluster approach (see Light-front computational methods#Light-front coupled-cluster method), avoids making a Fock-space truncation. Applications of this approach are just beginning. = Structure of hadrons = Experiments that need a conceptually and mathematically precise theoretical description of hadrons at the amplitude level include investigations of: the structure of nucleons and mesons, heavy quark systems and exotics, hard processes involving quark and gluon distributions in hadrons, heavy ion collisions, and many more. For example, LFQCD will offer the opportunity for an ab initio understanding of the microscopic origins of the spin content of the proton and how the intrinsic and spatial angular momenta are distributed among the partonic components in terms of the wave functions. This is an outstanding unsolved problem as experiments to date have not yet found the largest components of the proton spin. The components previously thought to be the leading carriers, the quarks, have been found to carry a small amount of the total spin. Generalized parton distributions (GPDs) were introduced to quantify each component of the spin content and have been used to analyze the experimental measurements of deeply virtual Compton scattering (DVCS). As another example, LFQCD will predict the masses, quantum numbers and widths of yet-to-be observed exotics such as glueballs and hybrids. = QCD at high temperature and density = There are major programs at accelerator facilities such as GSI-SIS, CERN-LHC, and BNL-RHIC to investigate the properties of a new state of matter, the quark-gluon plasma, and other features of the QCD phase diagram. In the early universe, temperatures were high, while net baryon densities were low. In contrast, in compact stellar objects, temperatures are low, and the baryon density is high. QCD describes both extremes. However, reliable perturbative calculations can only be performed at asymptotically large temperatures and densities, where the running coupling constant of QCD is small due to asymptotic freedom, and lattice QCD provides information only at very low chemical potential (baryon density). Thus, many frontier questions remain to be answered. What is the nature of the phase transitions? How does the matter behave in the vicinity of the phase boundaries? What are the observable signatures of the transition in transient heavy-ion collisions? LFQCD opens a new avenue for addressing these issues. In recent years a general formalism to directly compute the partition function in light-front quantization has been developed and numerical methods are under development for evaluating this partition function in LFQCD. Light- front quantization leads to new definitions of the partition function and temperature which can provide a frame-independent description of thermal and statistical systems. The goal is to establish a tool comparable in power to lattice QCD but extending the partition function to finite chemical potentials where experimental data are available.

The brothers become interested in exploration and in 1877, they undertook a desert crossing from the Nile to the borders of Abyssinia. The following year they travelled to India and accompanied troops through the Khyber Pass. In 1880‚Äì81 they explored areas of Sudan in preparation for a more extensive expedition and hunting trip the following year. During 1882‚Äì83 season, William accompanied his brother to Mexico, crossing overland to the Pacific side of the country. The brothers became members of the Royal Geographical Society (Frank was elected Fellow in 1881). William learnt map making techniques and during the 1884‚Äì85 season, he accompanied his brother on an expedition through Somalia, mapping areas hitherto unknown to Europeans. These were used to illustrate books published by Frank as were glass plate photographs taken by William. In 1886 William and Frank used the steam yacht RYS Lancashire Witch, to cruise the Mediterranean. Later that year the brothers, with Lord Stradbroke and Lord Dungarvon, sailed to India and the Persian Gulf. In 1888 the brothers took the Lancashire Witch to the West Indies with the Earl of Scarborough and the Hon. W. Ponsonby. Later that same year they were off to Spitsbergen with Arctic explorer Sir Henry Gore-Booth.J. A. James and W. D. James. Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society and Monthly Record of Geography. New Monthly Series, Vol. 12, No. 7 (Jul. 1890), pp. 425‚Äì427 Published by: The Royal Geographical Society (with the Institute of British Geographers). Article Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/1801234 Death of Frank James Lancashire Witch RYS, sold to Admiralty in 1893 and renamed HMS Waterwitch In January 1890, Frank set sail on board the Lancashire Witch for Africa, this time without William, who had recently married. On 21 April, whilst on a hunting trip, Frank was killed by a wounded elephant. His body was recovered with difficulty and returned to England to be buried at Kensal Green Cemetery, London; later his remains were transferred to the family plot at West Dean, West Sussex. The death of Frank came as a terrible blow to his brothers, but particularly to William, an experienced big game hunter, who had been his companion on almost all of his previous expeditions. As a memorial, he and Arthur funded the building of a hospital for mariners in the town of East Cowes, Isle of Wight, named the Frank James Memorial Hospital. Marriage and West Dean House In 1889 William married the 21-year-old Evelyn Elizabeth Forbes, at St. Paul's Church Knightsbridge. She was the eldest daughter of Helen Moncreiffe and Sir Charles Forbes, 4th Baronet of Newe, whose estate, Castle Newe was in the vicinity of Balmoral, the Scottish residence of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. The families were acquainted and Edward, Prince of Wales and Princess Alexandra were fond of Evelyn Forbes, presenting her with a diamond and sapphire brooch when she married. The reception after the wedding was hosted by the Countess of Dudley who was Evelyn's aunt. West Dean House In 1891 William purchased the West Dean estate in the county of West Sussex from Frederick Bower, who coincidentally was a former cotton merchant from Liverpool who traded with China. William and Evelyn undertook extensive alterations to the West Dean House in preparations for house parties plus pheasant and partridge shoots. The location of a new railway station (opened in 1881) at Singleton, adjacent to the entrance to the estate, made it convenient for guests coming from London and was often used by the Prince of Wales. After the death of his brother, William took over the ownership of the steam yacht Lancashire Witch and in 1891 was elected as a member of the Royal Yacht Squadron. He and Evelyn took several voyages, including one to the West Indies, where they became involved with the rescue of a shipwrecked crew of the barque Caribon. During an earlier cruise in 1888 William had also been involved with the rescue of the crews from three sealing vessels that had become icebound in the Kara Sea. In 1891 the yacht required extensive repair work at the yard of Day, Summers and Company in Southampton to replace timber planking. In 1893 William sold the yacht to the Admiralty for use as a survey ship on the Australian Station. She was renamed HMS Waterwitch and after several years of service sunk in Singapore harbour in 1912. In 1902 the Jameses built a house in the adjacent village of Chilgrove, as a retreat from West Dean, named Monkton House. It was designed by Edwin Lutyens, brick built and featuring loggia with deep balconies or sleeping porches. This unusual feature may have been influenced by William's experience of living in hot climates where this arrangement is more common. Lutyens had worked for the same firm of architects that had carried out the alteration work to West Dean House ‚Äì Ernest George and Peto. In addition to Monkton and West Dean the Jameses had a residence in Gullane, in East Lothian called Greywalls. This was another of Lutyen's designs with the garden influenced by Gertrude Jekyll. The Jameses London property was 38 Bryanston Square, where William died on 22 March 1912. Lutyens recorded his first impressions of William and Evelyn James when he visited them at West Dean in March 1902: ::::\\"Mr. James very neat, small: thin: young, turning towards, but gently, to middle age. Very quiet, reserved collected: an occasional spark of human feeling shewn by a twinkle: Improving on acquaintance and for a rich man ‚Äì sitting on Hoheit's lap ‚Äì delightful.\\" (\\"Hoheit\\" was a reference to James's friendship with the King) His first impressions of Evelyn were not so complimentary but he warmed to her. Public life William took an active interest in community matters and gave generously of both time and money to charities and other good causes. An example in 1884 was his donation of land and funds for a village social club in Woolston where he had lived as a child. He was a Justice of Peace, the deputy lieutenant of West Sussex, served as the Sheriff of Sussex and was awarded the Commander Victorian Order by King Edward VII. He was asked in 1904 what his hobbies were and said golf and shooting. He said he enjoyed motoring, owning a 12h.p. Panhard and 20h.p. Gobron-Brilli√©, and since becoming a motorist he estimated he had travelled 20,000 miles. He put down his clubs as the Turf Club and the Royal Yacht Squadron.

Plaque in St Andrew's West Dean, West Sussex UK William died in March 1912 after becoming ill on a trip to South Africa. Evelyn, remarried in 1913 to Major John Chaytor Brinton, a member of the Royal Household; the marriage was annulled in 1927. She died in 1929 following a serious operation. William and Evelyn had five children, four girls and one boy named Edward William Frank James, whose godfather was King Edward VII. In 1964 Edward James turned the West Dean Estate over to an educational trust; he died in 1984. William's mother Sofia had died in 1870 when he was 15. His brother, Arthur, died in 1917. His paternal half brother, Daniel Willis James, who had been born in Liverpool, died in America in 1907. William's paternal half sister, Olivia, married Robert Hoe III in 1868 and moved to America; she died in 1935 aged 98. His other half sister, Elizabeth Eccleston had died in 1868. William's daughter, Audrey Evelyn James Coats married Marshall Field III.

It is a part of the Schauinsland mine complex and was built for the Stolberg Zink AG to provide easier access to the seventh floor level of the Roggenbergschacht mine. Construction began in 1938. It was termed part of the Four Year Plan, an economic plan designed to prepare Nazi Germany for war, and Hermann G√∂ring's name was invoked in a dispute between the mining company and the state environmental protection agency when the agency requested the greening of excavated material. It should replace the existing goods cable lift near the railway to secure the transport via Freiburg and then to the Stolberg Zink AG in Pforzheim for further processing. The driving started in 1938 after the mining rights were acquired in 1935. This new approach was due to the development of the new flotation process. Thus, the ancient disposal heaps of former ore washing were processed.http://www.schwarzwald-mineralien.de/Schauinsland_Bergbau.html The tunnel's size of 2.5m by 2.5m accommodated the horses had been used as carriers. In 1944 this Tunnel achieved a length of more than 3.4 km, exploited by prisoners of war. The final connection to the Leopold gallery must have been accomplished in 1946. This level was in use until 1954. However, in the 1960s the tunnel collapsed 720 meters away from the Kappel valley entrance. This underground construction is part of a larger medieval silver mine in the Schauinsland mountain near Freiburg in Breisgau, sign of the last war efforts to extract zinc and lead ore from this area. Today the large mining complex is a repository for historical documents, adventure mine to attract tourists, students and amateur geologists as well as further underground research. The planned extension to the northern ore dressing part was not completed i.e. 300m remains unaccomplished. Therefore, the Deep Tunnel never could fulfill its function as transporting way. So it only served for the manriding of Kappel's miners and the mine's water drainage. See also * Berthold Steiber: Der Schauinsland. Geschichte, Geologie, Mineralien.

The series consists of three free browser games in which the player attempts to navigate and eventually escape a dream world inhabited by shadow people. The first game, Deep Sleep, was designed for and won first place in the 2012 Jay Is Games Casual Gameplay Design Competition.  Plot  = Deep Sleep (2012) = Interested in lucid dreams, a researcher constructs a world in his mind to explore. However, the world in his dream quickly turns nightmarish, and the researcher becomes trapped. He needs to wake up, which is explained when the player finds a telephone saying he \\"must wake up\\". Shadowy figures haunt this world and attempt to restrict the player from guiding the researcher to freedom. At the beginning of the game, the player appears to be in a bedroom. To escape, the player must first find a key, then go into the next room and use the key on a locker. A cube with a keyhole in it appears, and the walls of the room melt down. The player will then have to explore his or her surroundings, and use acquired items to escape. The main obstacle in the game are locked doors, and cannot be opened unless certain items are acquired. After a long period of time, the player finally escapes the building he is in, but has not woken up yet. Near the end of the game, shadowy figures start to appear and will advance towards the player. The player will then have to escape, as it is impossible to kill them. Running away, the player reaches a lighthouse with a Shadow Figure inside. The player then turns the light so it directly faces the Shadow Figure, and it vanishes. The game then ends, as the player \\"wakes up\\". However, the character is curious about the Shadow Figures he encountered and declares that he wants to visit them again. = Deeper Sleep (2013) = Following the events of the previous game, the protagonist develops an obsession over the previously- encountered shadow people, and begins to worry that they may be real entities. While seeking information at the library, the world begins to degrade around them, revealing that they are actually still in the dream world. Much of the gameplay is similar to that of the previous game, as the player navigates various rooms and buildings and utilized various items to advance through the game. Various newspaper clippings reveal more insight into the nature of the shadow people, which are described as ancient otherworldly entities that exist only in the dream world, and desire to escape into the real world by possessing the uninhabited bodies of people in comas or lucid dreams. Towards the end of the game, the player descends down a water well and enters various tunnels, before encountering two eye-like orbs of light in the darkness. The game then ends, and a newspaper article is shown, revealing that a young boy named Cody (whom the player had previously given a tiger plushie) had baffled doctors by awakening from a three-month coma, indicating that the player's action in the dream world can have consequences in the real world. = Deepest Sleep (2014) = Picking up at a different point in time from the previous game, the player awakens in their bed, immobile, and sees a shadowy figure in their room, which briefly attacks before vanishing. The player then fully \\"awakens\\" and exits their room, only to discover that they are still in the dream world and resume their attempts at escaping. After finding various items and proceeding through various rooms, the player enters a series of underground sewers and tunnels, inhabited by massive dreamworld predators known as \\"bottomfeeders\\" that the player must evade. Upon escaping the sewer system, the player enters a room previously explored in a previous game, where they discover that their uninhabited body had already been possessed, and they are now a shadow person themselves. Upon facing this realization, the player encounters another human traveling through the dream realm, who begins to flee. The player is then given the option to either let the human escape unharmed and remain trapped in the dream realm, or possess the human's body and leave them doomed as a shadow being.  Reception  Deep Sleep received mostly positive reviews. Adam Smith of Rock, Paper, Shotgun wrote that although the game has a minimalist story, it \\"relies on mood rather than jump scares to unsettle\\". Cassandra Khaw of Indiegames.com called it \\"creepy without being overdone\\". Steve Brown of Adventure Gamers called it \\"a truly disturbing experience\\". Both sequels received similarly positive reception, with Jay Is Games calling Deeper Sleep a \\"chilling, wonderfully creepy game that will make the hair on your arms stand on end, and you'll wind up eager for more\\" and PC Gamer including Deepest Sleep in its \\"best free games of the week\\" for August 2, 2014.

The program is organized by the Software Freedom Conservancy and was formerly organized by The GNOME Project and the GNOME Foundation. It is open to cisgender and transgender women, people of other gender identities that are minorities in open source (including transgender men and genderqueer people), and people of any gender in the United States who have racial/ethnic identities underrepresented in the US technology industry (Black/African American, Hispanic/Latino, American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander). Participants can be of any background and any age older than 18. Internships can focus on programming, design, documentation, marketing, or other kinds of contributions. The program began in 2006 with a round of internships for women working on the GNOME desktop environment (which primarily runs on Linux), and it resumed in 2010 with internships twice a year, adding projects from other organizations starting in 2012. As of 2014, these rounds of internships have had up to 16 participating organizations, including Mozilla and the Wikimedia Foundation. Funding comes from the GNOME Foundation, Google, organizations participating in the internships, and other software companies.  Program details  Promotional flyer for January-April 2013 internships The goal of Outreachy is to \\"create a positive feedback loop\\" that supports more women participating in free and open-source software, since contributors to free and open-source projects have mostly been men (see also Women in Libre software communities). The program is similar to Google Summer of Code, also an internship in free and open-source software, but unlike Google Summer of Code it is not limited to students or developers. It is intended to be compatible with student schedules, with mid-year internships corresponding with the summer break of students in the northern hemisphere, and late-year internships corresponding with the summer break of students in the southern hemisphere. The program began with inviting women participants, and it grew to include \\"anyone who was assigned female at birth and anyone who identifies as a woman, genderqueer, genderfluid, or genderfree regardless of gender presentation or assigned sex at birth\\". The December 2014 round was also open to participants of the Ascend Project of any gender, a training program for people from other groups underrepresented in open source. Starting in September 2015, Outreachy became open to \\"residents and nationals of the United States of any gender who are Black/African American, Hispanic/Latin@, American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian, or Pacific Islander\\", as people underrepresented in the technology industry in the US. As part of the application process, applicants have to make a contribution to the project they want to work with. Participants work remotely, so the internship includes a $500 travel budget to support interns meeting fellow contributors in person and develop stronger connections to the project. Participants also write a blog about their work, which one said \\"allowed me to meet many people interested in the same topic as myself and opened a completely different range of opportunities.\\"  Impact  The GNOME Project has noted several signs that the program has improved its recruitment and retention of women contributors. In April 2011, it said its 3.0 release \\"included more contributions by women than any previous release, an increase the project attributes [to] its new internship program.\\" In November 2011, it said the program had also helped recruit seven women to its Google Summer of Code program that year, in comparison to one or zero women in previous years. At the project's annual conference, GUADEC, 17% of attendees (41) in 2012 were women, \\"compared to only 4% (6 women) among attendees affiliated with GNOME three years earlier at the Desktop Summit 2009.\\" In June 2013, program co-organizer Marina Zhurakhinskaya said half of the 41 participants had continued to contribute to GNOME after their internships, including five becoming mentors for the program. Wikimedia said that working with the Outreach Program for Women and Google Summer of Code caused the project to develop better resources for newcomers interested in contributing to Wikimedia in general, including documentation and lists of suitable projects for newcomers. In 2013, Bruce Byfield said \\"Already, the program could claim to be the most successful FOSS program for women ever.\\" In March 2014, the Free Software Foundation gave the program its annual Award for Projects of Social Benefit as part of the FSF Free Software Awards, saying that the program does \\"critical work\\", \\"addressing gender discrimination by empowering women to develop leadership and development skills in a society which runs on technology.\\" Explaining what has made the program effective, Zhurakhinskaya said \\"You just need to say that women are welcome in your project, because that in itself sends a signal. Also, you want specific people they can get in touch with to do their first patch and to ask questions.\\" In June 2015, an Outreachy coordinator and Linux kernel contributor, Sage Sharp, won a Red Hat Women in Open Source Award for \\"efforts in improving communications and inviting women into open source communities.\\" In July 2015, program co-organizer Marina Zhurakhinskaya won an O'Reilly Open Source Award for her work on Outreachy.  History  = Women's Summer Outreach Program = In 2006, Hanna Wallach and Chris Ball noticed there were no women among the 181 applicants to GNOME's internship program with Google Summer of Code, and they decided to run GNOME's Women's Summer Outreach Program (WSOP) to invite participation from women. They organized it in about a month and focused on student developers. They received 100 applications and selected six for internships, half sponsored by the GNOME Foundation and half by Google. The students reported positive experiences and continued to use free and open- source software after the internship, but many of them did not have their work integrated into the main codebase. = GNOME Outreach Program for Women = In 2009, the GNOME community decided to revive the program as part of continuing efforts to encourage more women to contribute to GNOME, renaming it to the GNOME Outreach Program for Women. The GNOME Foundation board appointed Marina Zhurakhinskaya to organize it, including finding mentors for the program. The program's internship options expanded to include non-coding work such as documentation and localization, and it opened up to non-student applicants. To increase chances of success, the new application process included making an improvement to the project, and the internship shifted to encouraging several tasks incrementally incorporated into the main project, instead of one larger project like Google Summer of Code. After restructuring the program and finding interested projects and mentors within GNOME, they selected eight interns in November 2010. Another eight interns, from five continents, began in May 2011. They included Priscilla Mahlangu, a South African woman translating GNOME desktop software into the Zulu language. Twelve interns started in November 2011, with sponsorship from Collabora, Google, Mozilla, Red Hat, and the GNOME Foundation. For the May 2012 round, the Software Freedom Conservancy joined the program with an internship with the Twisted project, mentored by Jessica McKellar. Nine other interns worked on GNOME. = Free and Open Source Software Outreach Program for Women = The January 2013 round of the program, renamed to the Free and Open Source Software Outreach Program for Women, expanded to provide 25 internships with 10 organizations (Deltacloud, Fedora, GNOME, JBoss, Mozilla, Open Technology Institute, OpenITP, OpenStack, Subversion, and Wikimedia), with GNOME Foundation Executive Director Karen Sandler joining Zhurakhinskaya in organizing the program. The June 2013 internships included seven participants contributing to the Linux kernel, for example working on parallelizing the x86 boot process. Led by kernel contributor Sage Sharp, who found mentors and projects for the interns, they made significant contributions to the 3.11 kernel release. This round had 37 interns working with 16 organizations, and the next round starting in December 2013 had 30 interns working with 8 organizations. In April 2014, the GNOME Foundation temporarily froze nonessential expenditures because of a budget shortfall linked to the Outreach Program for Women; it paid interns on a schedule that was sometimes before payments from sponsoring organizations arrived. This was related to the program growing quickly, and the Foundation said it would follow up with those organizations and take other steps to resolve the problem. GNOME Foundation board meeting notes from June 2015 indicate that the problem was resolved with all outstanding payments collected. The May 2014 round had 40 participants and 16 organizations. The December 2014 round was open to participants of the Ascend Project of any gender, a training program for people from groups underrepresented in open source. = Outreachy = In February 2015, the program announced its rename to Outreachy, while management of the program transferred to the Software Freedom Conservancy with the GNOME Foundation participating as a partner. Starting in September 2015, Outreachy became open to \\"residents and nationals of the United States of any gender who are Black/African American, Hispanic/Latin@, American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian, or Pacific Islander\\", as people underrepresented in the technology industry in the US.

Lew was a deputy of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference from 2008 to 2013 and was outspoken as a high-profile supporter of Leung Chun-ying during the 2012 Hong Kong Chief Executive election. The relationship between the two soured after the election and he turned against Leung. In 2016, he was found guilty and imprisoned after being found guilty of perverting the course of justice by asking Leung, in letters and emails, to stop the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) from investigating him.  Early life and business career  Lew was born in Taishan in Guangdong in 1948. In 1973, he swam to Hong Kong with nothing more than swimwear and took a job at a stainless steel factory and became its head. In 1976, he joined a Japanese futures contract company as a broker. He rose to the chief advisor for the C.A. Pacific Forex Limited (CAPFL). He later moved into the energy industry and became the executive director of the Smart Rich Energy Finance (Holdings) Limited. In 2009, he became the deputy chairman and executive director of Pearl Oriental Oil Limited. Political ventures Lew was active in the defending Diaoyu Islands movement. He was a part-time member of the Central Policy Unit from 2006 to 2008 and Commission on Strategic Development from 2009 to 2012. He was appointed a national committee member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference representing Hong Kong, serving in that post from 2008 until 2013, when he lost his seat. He was seen as an outspoken pro-Beijing figure. In 2011, he compared the Hong Kong Autonomy Movement to the Taiwan Independence Movement, and believes that the Hong Kong Autonomy Movement is covertly instigated and planned by Stephen M. Young, who was the then Consulate General of the United States in Hong Kong, in an attempt to split Hong Kong away from China.ÊñáÂåØÂ†± - ÂäâÂ§¢ÁÜä - ÊåáÈªûÊ±üÂ±±ÔºöÊ•äÁî¶Ê££Á≠ñÂãï„ÄåÈ¶ôÊ∏ØËá™Ê≤ªÈÅãÂãï„ÄçÂåÖËóèÁ¶çÂøÉ From 2011, Lew was a member of the Election Committee through the Religious Sub-sector. He was a high-profile supporter of Leung Chun-ying early in the 2012 Hong Kong Chief Executive Election. His support for Leung began in 2010, when Leung approached him in Beijing to ask him if he could help sway public opinion to his side. Lew pitched Leung to Ma Ching-kwan, then chairman of the Oriental Press Group, publisher of Oriental Daily and The Sun. During the Chief Executive campaign, Leung's chief rival Henry Tang was exposed by the media with a series of scandals, including his illegal basement at his residence. Lew even went to Tang's doorstep, to hand out flyers urging Tang to withdraw from the election. As Tang's popularity suffered severely in wake of the scandals, Beijing eventually turned its favourite to Leung. Lew was also involved in setting up an infamous dinner in Lau Fau Shan between Leung's campaign office and Heung Yee Kuk leaders as well as alleged former triad head Kwok Wing-hung during the election campaign in March 2012. However, after Leung was elected, Lew made a series of allegations against Leung, including that Leung had failed to honour his promise to nominate Lew as a vice-chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and that Leung had reneged on appointing Lew to the Executive Council. In 2013, Lew revealed in an interview with iSun Affairs details of Leung‚Äôs alleged broken promises and his alleged illegal structures at his home on The Peak. He became more critical of the Hong Kong government and also some policies of the mainland government. He attended the July 1 march in 2014 opposing Beijing‚Äôs controversial white paper on Hong Kong‚Äôs autonomy and a demonstration against the abduction of Causeway Bay Books publisher Lee Po. He also endorsed Alvin Yeung of the pan-democrat Civic Party in the 2016 New Territories East by- election. He said that \\"I will help improve one country, two systems ... by neither allowing Hong Kong to turn into a sovereign state nor one country, one system.\\" Charges and conviction Lew was arrested by the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) on 25 February 2013 on charges of perverting the course of justice when he was alleged to have sent a letter to Leung, asking him to stop the ICAC from investigating him in a fraud case.Siu, Beatrice (22 August 2013). \\"ICAC lines up 19 witnesses for 'Dream Bear' trial\\" .

History and description The AJAX process invented in 1957, and named after its originator, Albert Jackson. The process involved modifying an open hearth furnace to use oxygen instead of air. The use of oxygen in the open hearth negated the need for an external fuel source, as with Linz-Donawitz converters. The furnaces were used at the United Steel Companies at the Appleby-Frodingham steelworks near Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, England as an alternative to installing completely new oxygen based steelmaking plant. In operational practice at Appleby-Frodingham the design initially increased productivity by 38%, as well as reducing scrap requirement from per . Later productivity increases were from 70% to 100%, with conversion costs reduced to 68%. By 1962 five of the six open hearth furnaces at the plant had been converted. Conversion time of the open hearths to the oxygen based process was around 28 days on average, with a stated capital cost of ¬£180,000 each.

According to legend, the inhabitants of Ulm needed a particularly large beam for the construction of Ulm Minster, but could not get it through the city gate. As they were about to tear the gate down, they noticed a sparrow carrying a straw for its nest; which turned it from crosswise to lengthwise in its beak. Realisation dawned on the people of Ulm, who have ever since placed long loads along rather than across their carts. The legend is first recorded in an 1842 poem by Carl Hertzog.  The legend's origin  The figure on the nave of Ulm Minster was donated by wealthy citizens. It is not a sparrow, but a dove carrying an olive branch in its beak, as in the biblical story of Noah's Ark. It is small in relation to the building, and only easily visible from the tower. Over time, the inhabitants came to refer to it mockingly as a sparrow, and the legend grew from there.

The area is protected, and rocks with fossils on them cannot be moved.  Fossils  Shown is one of several slabs of diatomaceous sandstone with abundant fossil fish (perhaps a species of herring) collected in the 1970s from the area now underneath the Mulholland Estates security gate/access road. Many hundreds if not thousands of these 5 1/2 inch fish must have encountered an area of low oxygen content and all died at once. thumb References Category:Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles Category:Parks in Los Angeles Category:Fossil parks in the United States Category:Paleontology in California ","title":"Fossil Ridge Park"},{"id":"43699508","text":"A 17th-century boyar vozok 1732 vozok from the Kremlin Armoury on a 2002 postage stamp of Russia, this vozok belonged to Elizabeth of Russia (bears her Imperial Monogram) and Anna of Russia Vozok (–≤–æ–∑–æ–∫) is a type of closed winter sled that was used throughout Russia until the late 19th century.

It was enlarged in 1923, with the addition of a three-story, 14 bay brick addition, connected to the original building by a two-story section. The building was converted to apartments in 1937. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986.  History  The Ottari Sanitarium (named for nearby Ottari Rd.) was built in 1912 by Dr. William Banks Meacham, a doctor of Osteopathy. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, the Asheville area was known as a health resort. It was believed that the fresh mountain air could alleviate lung diseases such as tuberculosis. When the facility opened in 1912 there were rooms and suites (with open porches) for eighteen patients. An additional twenty rooms were built in 1923. In a 1917 letter published in Osteopathic Truth,Osteopathic Truth, v.II n.4, p.49. November 1917. https://www.atsu.edu/museum-of-osteopathic-medicine/wp- content/uploads/2019/04/Osteopathic%20Truth/OsteopathicTruthVol2No4Nov1917.pdf Dr. M.J. Carson of the North Carolina Osteopathic Society described the sanitarium: > ...Building fire-proof, interior trim white, glass knobs to doors, each room > with private tiled bath, \\"anatomic\\" closet seats of non-stainable ivory; > cross transom ventilation, door and two windows opening on private screened > porch. Call bells in each room, indirect lighting, furniture and rugs of > private home and not like hotel or hospital. Meals served individually by > maids, nurses and butler dressed in white, with dainty china and neat > silver...\\" By the end of the 1920s, Dr. Meacham found himself financially overextended, and the sanitarium closed in 1930. The City of Asheville and the Buncombe County Commission acquired the property in 1933, and arranged with a local realtor to convert it into apartments. The Kimberly Apartments opened in 1937. In 1940 the apartments were sold to Harry Cutler Coburn, who re-named the complex the Coburn Apartments. The building remains in apartment use in 2020.

Parkey later reacted, \\"I feel terrible. There's really no answer to it. I thought I hit a good ball.\\" The kick became known as the \\"Double Doink\\" after NBC color commentator Cris Collinsworth stated immediately afterward, \\"Oh my goodness, the Bears' season is going to end on a double doink\\".

In Florida, there are a number of murder victims in the category of unidentified decedents, whose identities have yet to be found. In most of these cases, their murderer or murderers have also gone undiscovered.  Marion County Jane Doe  On September 30, 1967, the skeletal remains of a biracial (Hispanic/African American) female were discovered by a group of hunters in the woods of Ocala National Forest near former State Route 315 just south of Fort McCoy, Florida. Cause of death was found to be a gunshot wound to the head, and she had been deceased for anywhere between a few months to two years. Investigators could not figure out whether the gunshot was self inflicted or homicidal. She was between 25 and 40 years old and was between 5 feet and 5 feet 3 inches tall. She also had black curly hair which was possibly bleached with an orange or red tint. Weight and eye color could not be ascertained. She was found wearing a red and green plaid blouse, a bra and a black slip. Isotope testing indicated that she had remained in the southern United States for most if not all of her life. \\"Woman in the Trunk\\" An adult female, between the ages of 25 and 35 years old, was discovered wrapped in plastic and concealed in a footlocker on October 31, 1969 in St. Petersburg, Florida. The murder weapon, a necktie, was visible around her neck. Examination also concluded she had suffered blunt force trauma to the head. The murder had taken place within 72 hours of her discovery. She was five feet nine inches tall, weighed 130 pounds, and was the mother of at least one child. The dental care she received in her life was of relatively low quality, despite the fact that her wisdom teeth had been removed. Her face has been reconstructed twice, including by the University of South Florida. \\"Little Miss Lake Panasoffkee\\" The body of a young woman was found in the summer of 1971 underneath a bridge in Lake Panosoffkee, Florida. She had been killed by strangulation. Analysis of the remains traced her place of residence to a village in Greece. She had given birth to at least two children between the ages of 17 and 24 years. Evidence of various dental work and a unique ankle surgery were present on the body, which may indicate she was from a well-off background. Reconstructions were created between 1971 and 2012.  Pinellas County Jane Doe (1972)  On April 25, 1972, the decomposed remains of a middle-aged white female were found on Belleair Beach in Pinellas County, Florida. The woman's head was not recovered, and wires were used to tie weights to her body, leading investigators to believe that her death was a homicide. She had been dead for anywhere between one and three weeks. She was estimated to be between 4 feet 5 inches and 5 feet 1 inch tall and weighed between 120 and 125 pounds. Hair color and eye color could not be ascertained, but it is believed that she may have had naturally brown hair. She had a dark/tan complexion and may have been a smoker. A body was reported floating in the water a half mile south from where the Doe was found, however was not recovered by authorities, so it is unsure if the two are the same. Volusia County John Doe Shoe worn by the Volusia County John Doe The body of a male, aged 11 to 14, was found floating in a pond on May 7, 1972 in Daytona, Volusia County, Florida. He had been stabbed to death three to four days before, and was already decomposed when he was found, preventing the assessment of his eye color. The victim was white, five feet two inches tall, and weighed around 110 to 120 pounds. He had dark wavy hair and had no evidence of dental work, but his teeth were in very good condition. On his right leg, a benign tumor was found, and the bones of his feet had fused together. Both of these traits were caused by different conditions but would not likely have had symptoms. The victim also may have shaved his pubis, if he was at a reproductive stage in his life. He wore a denim jacket, a red and white striped shirt, gray pants, brown socks, and one black shoe with a silver buckle. The latter articles of clothing were presumed to be dress clothes. The boy had a wallet with visible paint drops in his back pants pocket, although it is unknown if it assisted with finding clues about the victim's identity. The body was exhumed in 2013 to collect DNA, although tests proved unsuccessful at generating a usable profile.  \\"Edna\\"  On July 19, 1972, the decomposed remains of a young white female were discovered just off of State Route 50 near Withlacoochee State Forest in Hernando County, Florida. She had been strangled to death and hidden under a bedspread, and had been dead for between three and five days. She was estimated to be between 25 and 40 years old, was approximately 5 feet tall and weighed between 130 and 140 pounds. She had medium-length brown hair. Her teeth were described to be in poor condition. She was only found wearing a white bra and white bikini-style panties. Witnesses claimed to have seen the woman exit a 1961 or 1962 Ford Falcon head into the woods with two other individuals, while only two returned. Se was exhumed in 2015 for testing and to make a facial reconstruction. Isotope testing on her body indicated that she had been in the United States for between five and ten years, and had been in Florida for several years. She has been nicknamed \\"Edna\\" by investigators. Seminole County Jane Doe (1973) Ring found with \\"Ginger.\\" The body of an unidentified white female was found on August 21, 1973. She was likely between the ages of 13 and 18, but may have been as old as 21. It was believed that she may have been a victim of Joseph Spaziano's, as she was found within a wooded area, lying beneath the body of Laura Harbers, whose murder Spaziano was later charged with. A witness claimed to have met a teenage girl in Daytona Beach, Florida, who was riding on a motorcycle with Spaziano. The girl asked the witness to watch over her purse until she returned. When the girl did not return, the witness looked through the purse but could only recall to authorities that the girl may have been from Ann Arbor, Michigan. Five days later, Spaziano returned and took the purse from the witness. Seminole County Jane Doe was slenderly built, weighed about 110 pounds, and was between 5 feet 1 and 5 feet 7 inches tall. She had light brown hair tied in a ponytail. Some of her teeth may have been found at the scene.  Seminole County Jane Doe (1974)  On November 24, 1974, the remains of a middle aged white female were found in what was a nearly fully-constructed Intestate Mall near Interstate 4 and State Route 436 in Altamonte, Florida. She may be a potential victim of serial killer, Gerald Stano, as he claimed to have killed a woman and then disposed of her at the site. He claimed she was a hitchhiker and never gave him her name. She was estimated to be between 38 and 55 years old, was between 4 feet 11 inches and 5 feet 3 inches tall, and weighed between 140 and 160 pounds. She had reddish blonde to light brown hair. She also had a narrow nose and an obese build. She was found wearing a pair of royal blue slacks with an elastic band, a light red or pink crew neck shirt, a sleeveless, knit blouse, a white bra, and a yellow gold wedding ring with diamond stones. She may have ties to California or Arizona as that's where her wedding ring was known to be sold during 1969 and 1972.  Collier County Jane Doe (1978)  On June 3, 1978, the decomposed remains of a middle aged/elderly white female were discovered in a shallow grave, half a mile south of Alligator Alley on State Route 29 in rural Collier County, Florida. She had been beaten to death, and her body had been covered in caustic lime or hydrated lime at the crime scene. She was estimated to be between 40 and 70 years old, was between 5 feet and 5 feet 5 inches tall, and weighed 180 pounds. She had light brown hair, and possibly hazel eyes. It was also noted that she may have suffered from chronic ear infections which may have caused hearing loss. Her teeth had been restored within the last three years, and investigators noted that the level of quality in which her teeth were restored would have most likely been done in a large city, rather than in a small town. She was also found wearing no clothing. Miami-Dade County Jane Doe (1979) The Miami-Dade County Jane Doe may be an Ohio runaway named Tina with the nickname \\"Sheeba.\\" On September 4, 1979, a young woman's body was found lying in an apartment complex parking lot next to a dumpster, in Dade, Miami-Dade County, Florida. She was believed to have died just hours before, leaving her face in a recognizable condition. She had not been murdered at that location and had likely been killed at a different area. Her eyes were described as hazel, although the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System states that they were a grayish-green. Her hair was strawberry blonde, and she was five foot five to five foot eight inches tall, and weighed 120 pounds. She was between 17 and 25 years old at the time of her death. On her calves, burns were found, possibly from coming in contact with tail pipes from riding on a motorcycle. The victim had acne on her face and some fillings in her mouth. The body was found clad in a white tee shirt, a yellow scarf with flower designs, and blue jeans. Recent developments in her case have turned up the possibility that she may have been an Ohio runaway named Tina and nicknamed \\"Sheeba\\". However, no information has been published if this lead has had results. The missing girl had left Ohio in 1977, and has never been seen nor heard from since. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children published this information on their Facebook page dedicated to unidentified children, hoping for additional tips. Broward County John Doe (1979) 1979 Broward County John Doe On November 2, 1979, a young white man was killed by a drunk driver while walking on Interstate 95 in Fort Lauderdale, Broward County, Florida. The victim was killed alongside another individual who was later identified. The unidentified victim was between 16 and 25 years old, , and weighed . His eyes were gray. The victim's hair was brown, and he may have had facial hair, although this is unknown.

Before she died, the Jane Doe was seen at a diner, where she purchased the cigarettes, and was witnessed arguing with a man by bystanders across the street. Although the woman's face was recognizable and her DNA, fingerprints and dental information were recovered, she was never identified. Those interviewed by police who had seen the victim had no idea who she was. Several missing people from the area that matched her description were eventually found alive. In 2011, Daly City police noted similarities between the murder of Jane Doe and the modus operandi of serial killer Joseph Naso. San Bernardino County Jane Doe (1987) 1987 San Bernardino Jane Doe The body of a white female with a fair complexion between forty-five and fifty-five years old was located on June 19, 1987 in Colton, San Bernardino County, California. The woman had been shot to death mere hours before her body was found. The victim had short hair that was originally auburn, but was dyed blond and it is believed that she had hazel eyes. She had two moles on her face, one on her right temple and another on the right side of her nose, which was fairly noticeable. Other distinct features the woman had included scars on her wrist, abdomen, and one near each knee. She was approximately five feet one inch and weighed between 132 and 135 pounds. She wore blue pajamas and stud earrings made from a yellow metal. The woman also wore a partial denture on her upper set of teeth.  Van Nuys Jane Doe  The body of a woman between twenty-four and thirty-three years old was discovered in Van Nuys, Los Angeles County, California on July 21, 1987. Her body was wrapped in a tarp and some blankets. The body was found weeks afterward. The victim had been strangled and had her arms severed at the elbows, preventing analysis of fingerprints. She had brown hair and eyes, had braces at one time in her life and also had some missing teeth and fillings in her mouth. She wore what appeared to be a handmade dress, a bra, slip, underwear and mismatched shoes, one being a high heel and the other an open- toed shoe. The female was about five feet eight inches tall and was at a weight between 110 and 120 pounds. Further physical examination indicated she had been pregnant at one point in life and had consumed cocaine before her murder. It is possible that this case may be linked to serial killings in the area, but authorities are unsure. The female's body was eventually cremated. Los Angeles County John Doe (1987)  1987 Los Angeles County John Doe A Hispanic man was found stabbed to death on November 22, 1987 in Los Angeles, Los Angeles County, California. He had been left on a sidewalk after his murder, which occurred on the same day. The victim was between twenty-five and thirty-five years of age, had brown eyes and black hair. Examiners concluded he was approximately five feet seven inches tall and weighed 130 pounds. DNA and dental information for the victim were never recorded, although his fingerprints were taken and are entered in national databases. The victim had no distinct markers of identification except for a scar on his right arm.  Clarksburg John Doe (1988)  On March 4, 1988, the partial skeletal remains of a middle-aged white or Hispanic male were found on State Route 1 in a rural agricultural area in Clarksburg, California. The skull, right femur, left tibia and fibula, left iliac bone, and various other small bones were recovered. Cause of death was found to be blunt force trauma to the head, and the man may have been deceased for up to two years. The man was estimated to be between 40 and 60 years old and was 5 feet 4 inches. He had short, fine, dark brown or black hair. Eye color and weight could not be ascertained. Rope was also observed to be tied around one of the leg bones. A reconstruction was released, and workers at a ranch in the local area claimed to identify the man, however no positive identification was made.  San Mateo County Jane Doe (1989)  On March 22, 1989, the skeletal remains of a young African American (with white/Hispanic admixture) female were discovered wrapped in a floral print bedspread in some shrubs in Pacifica, California. She had been strangled to death elsewhere and then deposited at the scene. She was estimated to be between 18 and 30 years old, was approximately 5 feet 6 inches tall, and weighed between 110 and 120 pounds. She had short, curly, reddish- brown hair. Her teeth were noted to have some fillings as well as mild decay. She was found wearing a red and white bikini bottom, a light colored T-shirt with a picture of Betty Boop standing on a grid, and a white metal cuff-like bracelet which appeared handmade. Authorities noted that she may be a victim of Morris Solomon Jr., due to the similar circumstances in which she was found. She was exhumed in 2011 for DNA analysis. Santa Ana Jane Doe (1988) Sketch of the 1988 Santa Ana Jane Doe A Hispanic woman's body was found on March 31, 1988 in Santiago Park, Santa Ana, Orange County, California. Her death was by murder, as she had been stabbed multiple times in the face and once in the neck and later decapitated with the sawing motion of a blade. The body was discovered first, lacking a head. When investigators later returned to the site after four days, the head was located, believed to have been placed there after the body was removed. She was Hispanic, possibly native to the southwestern part of the country or Mexico, judging by an examination of her teeth. The victim was a young woman, presumed to be between twenty-two and twenty-eight years old, although she could have been as young as twenty. The body was clothed, with a yellow sweater, white pants, white shoes. She may have had a laparoscopy, as a scar was located on her stomach. She was estimated to be between five feet three inches to five feet five inches tall at a weight of 130 pounds. She had nine-inch long black hair. The case was reopened in April 2015, in hopes to identify the victim and solve her murder.  Corona Del Mar Jane Doe (1989)  On May 14, 1989, the body of a young white female was discovered by a surfer, tangled up in a barbed-wire fence along the Pacific Coast Highway in Corona Del Mar, California. Cause of death was found to be strangulation, and her body had been recently deposited at the location. She was estimated to be between 25 and 35 years old, was 5 feet 2 inches tall and weighed 158 pounds. She had bleached blonde hair and hazel eyes. She was also described as having a stocky build with pierced ears and painted fingernails. She also suffered from scoliosis. Her teeth were found to be in poor condition. She was found wearing a white tank-top, a short red skirt, a pair of pantyhose and a single white sneaker. Toxicology tests revealed nothing in her system and her fingerprints were run through California's \\"Cal ID\\" database with no results. Despite a sketch of the woman being advertised to local newspapers, nobody came forward with her identity. Investigators do not believe she was a transient. Los Angeles County Jane Doe (1989) 1989 Los Angeles County Jane Doe illustrated with curly hair A Hispanic female, who suffered trauma to the head, was found lying on her back, deceased, in an alley on May 25, 1989 in Los Angeles, Los Angeles County, California. The girl was believed to be between the ages of twelve and fifteen when she died hours before her discovery due to an undisclosed cause. The height and weight of the female were estimated to be five feet three inches and 124 pounds, respectively. Her hair was either black or dark brown and her eyes were also brown. The texture of her hair is disputed, as some sources state she had curly hair and others claim it was straight. Despite her young age, she had multiple tattoos: an \\"oval or diamond\\" shaped design around the letters \\"p,\\" \\"o,\\" \\"h\\" and \\"s\\" along with another on the back her upper right leg. The tattoos were hard to read and probably homemade. The girl wore a blue shirt that read \\"Somebody in California Loves Me,\\" dark blue but faded jeans, a tan bra, white or green underwear, white socks and black shoes with some red. She also wore jewelry that included a ring with a lion decoration, a ring with a light blue stone along with earrings, a bracelet adorned with pendants and a necklace. Placer County Jane Doe On February 10, 1990, a young woman's body was found by two men in Colfax, Placer County, California. She was between sixteen and twenty-six years old at the time of her death, which is believed to have occurred while she was hiking, three to six months before. She was around four feet ten to five foot three inches with an estimated weight range of 120 to 150 pounds, at an average or overweight build. She could have been biracial, of white and Hispanic ancestry and she had dark brown hair with a reddish tint. Her jewelry included three earrings on her left ear and a pearl necklace, along with two mother of pearl rings. She may have been diabetic, as two insulin syringes were found near the corpse. A presumably homemade tattoo was found on her chest of a cross and she had two scars, possibly from removing cysts from her lower back and right breast. The victim wore blue shorts, a sleeveless shirt and a pair of new sneakers, which were white. Her cause of death is unknown but is suspected to be homicide.  Orange County Jane Doe (1990)  On October 4, 1990, the body of a white/Hispanic/Oceanic female was found by children walking to school, rolled up inside of a carpet in Garden Grove, California. Cause of death was found to be strangulation, and the body was then placed into the carpet post-mortem. She was believed to have been discovered shortly after the body was dropped off at the location. She was estimated to be between 25 and 30 years old, was 5 feet 3 inches tall and weighed 179 pounds. She had brown-shoulder length curly hair and brown eyes. She was also of an obese build and had most likely given birth at least once in her life. She was found wearing a sleeveless black blouse over a pink tank top and acid-washed blue jeans. Investigators believe she may have possibly been an immigrant from Mexico, South America or the Pacific Southwest. Despite numerous announcement to various Spanish- speaking news outlets, nobody came forward with information. Investigators are looking for leads to a person that the decedent may have had a connection to with the name 'Steve Glick'. San Diego County John Doe (1991) The San Diego County John Doe may have been native to Vietnam A young man was struck in the back of his head with a two-by-four on September 8, 1991 in San Diego, California. The man died later that day. He was between seventeen and twenty- nine years old and was five feet eight inches at a weight of 112 pounds. He had dark hair and brown eyes and may have spoken to doctors in Vietnamese, although it is not certain if this was true. At the time of death, he wore a long-sleeved shirt with a plaid design and a white undershirt. It has not been published if he wore anything other than these two garments. Los Angeles County Jane Doe (1991) 1991 Los Angeles County Jane Doe On September 11, 1991, the body of a Hispanic female was located in the Green Meadows Park in Los Angeles, Los Angeles County, California, hours after her death. The victim was between fifteen and twenty years of age at the time of her murder and was five feet two inches at a weight of 170 pounds when she died. The girl had wavy dark brown to black hair reaching past her shoulders and had brown eyes. After examining her teeth, it was discovered that one of her upper teeth had an infection that would likely be painful, which may have caused visible distress to the Jane Doe. The victim's skin on her abdomen had areas with different colors, possibly indicating that she had vitiligo. Clothing found at the scene consisted of a white shirt with blue stripes, shorts made from denim, a white bra, socks and hiking boots reaching the ankles. Marks and tan lines near her eyes indicated that she may have worn some sort of eyeglasses before her death. Scars on her body included ones on her collar bone, right lower leg and on her left knee. Los Angeles County John Does (1992) The Los Angeles County John Does may have died after participating in a gang exercise. Two Hispanic teenage boys were shot at a bus stop on July 19, 1992. The older victim, estimated to be between seventeen and nineteen years old, wore a T-shirt, jeans and tennis shoes and had a scar on both of his thighs and one of his hips. The boy also had a small amount of facial hair and had a darker complexion than his companion. He stood at five feet six inches and weighed 170 pounds. His age was initially believed to have been between thirteen and sixteen. The other victim was between fourteen and seventeen years old and was of the same height, but weighed 128 pounds; his hair was somewhat longer than the other victim. He wore jeans and tennis shoes, like the older male, but wore a Casio watch and a scar was observable on one of his forearms. This victim died the same day he was found, but the other lived until July 20. His original age estimation was between twelve and sixteen. The two males allegedly died after a gang initiation took place. Los Angeles County Jane Doe (1992) Reconstruction of the 1992 Los Angeles County Jane Doe On December 9, 1992, the body of a Hispanic female was discovered inside of several trash bags in South Central Los Angeles, Los Angeles County, California. Despite being four feet six inches tall, her age was estimated to between fourteen and twenty-five years old. She wore a white shirt and skirt, two silver-colored rings on her right hand, a black belt, a purple slip and was found barefoot. She was of medium complexion and build, weighing 127 pounds. The cause of her death was multiple stab wounds. Happy Face Killer victims Three women, presumably prostitutes, who were possibly killed by Keith Hunter Jesperson during August 1992 and September 1994. Tujunga Jane Doe (1994) Artist sketch of what Tujunga Jane Doe may have looked like in life. Sketch by Marilyn Droz. The victim, estimated to have been between 14 and 24 years old, was located on August 7, 1994 at 11:25 pm. She had been strangled and set on fire. She was found lying in a vacant dirt parking lot 60 feet north of La Tuna Canyon Road in the Sunland-Tujunga neighborhood in Los Angeles County, California. A passerby noticed what they thought was a pile of trash on fire, stopped to kick some dirt on it and realized it was actually a body. By the time firefighters arrived at the scene, her body was partially burned. She had been deceased for several hours prior to discovery. Detectives suspect that she was strangled somewhere else before her body was dumped and set on fire. The fire was an attempt to hide the identity of the victim. She is believed to have been Hispanic, possibly Asian (Filipina), White/Caucasian, or Admixed. She is estimated to have been 5'2\\" ‚Äì 5'6\\" tall and weighed approximately 133 pounds. She had black, shoulder-length hair that was tied back with a rubber band. She was wearing a medium-length dark brown ‚ÄúNew Born Free‚Äù wig. She had brown eyes. She had a ¬æ\\" horizontal scar on her forehead, just above her right eyebrow. She had small moles across the entirety of her forehead. She had extensive dental work, with at least ten fillings and restorations. She had a gap between her two front teeth, gaps between other teeth and some teeth were crooked. She was wearing tan/brown Levi's slacks (size small), a black and red flower-print blouse or dress (size medium), a white bra (possibly an ‚ÄúA-cup‚Äù), white panties, two yellow metal hoop earrings (one in each ear), a yellow metal chain necklace with a medallion depicting Jesus Christ in a crown of thorns, a yellow metal ring on her right pinky finger, and a v-shaped yellow metal ring with a small white stone on her left ring finger. A math book and LA Gear tennis shoes were also found with the remains. It is likely that the victim was Catholic. She is sometimes referred to as Jane Doe #41. The case is handled by the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner-Coroner. Her dental charts and fingerprints are available for comparison to missing persons. There is insufficient DNA for profiling. Riverside County Jane Doe (1994) On October 24, 1994, the body of a white female was found near Thousand Palms, Riverside County, California. She was elderly, at an age between sixty-five and eighty years old upon the time of her murder. She had been wrapped in plastic that was then secured with a brown cord that was partially concealed in the sand at the scene. The woman was approximately five feet four inches tall, although her weight could not be estimated due to decomposition. The woman had no teeth, but had worn dentures that were found with her body. However, these did not assist with the investigation as they lacked a brand name or a serial number. The woman wore blue shorts, a red shirt and a pair of underwear, but no shoes. She had brown and gray short hair and an eleven-inch scar on her abdomen that had healed. She also suffered from Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and Arteriosclerotic heart disease. San Joaquin County Jane Doe One of the charms found with the body of the San Joaquin County Jane Doe The body of a woman was found on March 29, 1995, in Holt, San Joaquin County, California inside of a refrigerator bound with rope near a road. She had been murdered by a blow to the head with a blunt object around a year before she was found. The body was covered with a sleeping bag as well as a quilt. She was twenty-nine to forty-one years old and was five feet five to five feet seven inches at a weight of 110 to 130 pounds. She was white with strawberry-blond hair, had manicured nails and jewelry, including a wedding ring. She also possibly wore a charm necklace, as remnants of a leather band were located in her pocket. She wore a blue sweatshirt, denim shorts, a tee shirt, a bra, knee-high socks with various colors and expensive boots. It is believed that the refrigerator with her remains originated from elsewhere in California and likely floated along a levee to the location it was found. It has been suggested by Assistant Sheriff John Huber that she might've been a victim of serial killer Terry Peder Rasmussen. Santa Clara County John Does The bodies of two Hispanic men were discovered in July 1997 in Gilroy, Santa Clara County, California. The first victim's torso was found severely decomposed on July 16; his skull was also later found. He was between thirty and fifty years of age. His clothing included a Nike shirt and jeans. A second man was found on July 31 and was fifteen to forty years old. Both men were between five feet five and five feet seven inches and may have been killed by asphyxiation. It is also believed that they were disposed of in a sewer line, which lead to the Gilroy Sewage Treatment Plant. They may have been native to Mexico and could have been involved in the drug trade. They likely were murdered on the same day, up to a year prior.  \\"Eric\\"  On December 27, 1998, the skeletal remains of a young white male were found on the steep hillside of a remote mountain area in Boulder Creek, California. Cause of death was found to be stabbing. He had been murdered at the location between three and six weeks prior. He was estimated to be between 16 and 20 years old, was approximately 5 feet 7 inches tall, and weighed between 150 and 160 pounds. He was found wearing a maroon long-sleeved turtle neck shirt, white socks, heavy blue denim pants and a beaded chain necklace. His murder was solved shortly after he was found. The perpetrators involved in the murder claimed that they had killed the man in order to steal his car. They also claimed that his name may potentially be \\"Eric\\" and that he was homeless. He was also accompanied by a girlfriend whose name has yet to be determined. Clarksburg John Doe (1999) In Clarksburg, Yolo County, California, a man's body was found on March 4, 1999. He was a victim of homicide, as he was stabbed in the chest. He was killed months before his remains were found, which were so badly decomposed that his race was not possible to estimate. He was fully clothed and placed underneath a sleeping bag next to the Elk Slough estuary. He was between twenty and thirty- five years old and stood around five feet eleven inches tall at a weight of 182 pounds. His clothing included a tee shirt with a green \\"M,\\" white and blue shoes and a green pair of boxers. San Diego County Jane Doe (1999) San Diego County Jane Doe The body of a Hispanic female was located on August 11, 1999 in Oceanside, San Diego County, California. The victim was between fifteen and thirty-four years old and was between five feet one to five feet three inches tall at a weight of 135 to 143 pounds, having black hair and brown eyes. She was killed by a blow to the head at an unknown location and was then transported to a drainage ditch where her body was then disposed of. She wore a green turtle-neck shirt, blue pants, white socks and white and blue Reebok sneakers. The victim wore her dark and wavy hair in a long braid. She was the mother of at least one child, giving birth a year or less prior to her death. A six-inch scar was found on the outside of her left knee, indicating she had had some sort of surgery in the past.  San Diego County Jane Doe (2000)  On January 24, 2000, emergency services responded to a fire in an empty lot in San Diego, California. After the fire was extinguished, they discovered the charred remains of a young-middle aged white female, wrapped in cardboard and secured with a rope. Cause of death was found to be multiple stab wounds and strangulation. She was estimated to be between 20 and 40 years old, was between 5 feet 5 inches and 5 feet 10 inches tall, and weighed between 150 and 200 pounds. She had light brown hair and brown eyes. Both hands and a portion of her left calf were missing, most likely cut off to prevent identification. Investigators have followed leads that the woman might possibly be from Arkansas.  \\"Barbara Pacheco Santiago\\"  On May 26, 2003, the skeletal remains of a middle aged woman of Zapotec Indian descent was found in a shallow grave near the Shady Rest Campground in The Mammoth Lakes National Forest in Mono County, California. She was estimated to be between 30 and 50 years old, was between 4 feet 6 inches and 5 feet tall, and weighed between 80 and 90 pounds. She had long, black hair and was determined to have had one full term pregnancy. She was found wearing a black bra, a pair of cropped denim spandex pants, black socks, blue leather \\"Bass\\" brand shoes, a \\"Cold Air Design\\" coat, a pair of shoes, a \\"Jacklyn Smith\\" brand wristwatch, a single gold earring and a necklace/bracelet with small multicolored beads. She was believed to have been hastily buried after being killed by unknown, possibly homicidal means. Isotope testing indicated that she most likely grew up in Northern Mexico or the southwestern US. She was found to have originated from the Zapotec Indian community in Oaxaca, Mexico. A witness claimed that they had seen the woman in the Forest with her husband, who was belligerent. She appeared to be fearful of him. He was described as a white, heavyset male, who was 5 feet 9 inches tall and weighed between 175 and 200 pounds with brown hair and a bushy mustache. Investigators have stated that her name may be \\"Barbara Pacheco Santiago\\". \\"Baby Doe\\" About ten days after he was suffocated, an infant's body was located on a recycling conveyor belt on February 10, 2004 in Stanton, California. He was likely killed on the day he was born, as his placenta and umbilical cord had not yet been severed from his body. A towel was found nearby with blood on it, which may have been used during the birth and, later, to murder the infant. A newspaper and a plastic bag were also found at the scene. The victim's ethnic background was difficult to determine, but he may have been African-American or Hispanic. His hair was black and curly, and his eyes were gray. Although he had been dead for over a week, his body was not badly decomposed; his face was still recognizable.  Rancho Bernardo John Doe  On May 4, 2004, the skeletal remains of a young, possibly white, male toddler were found inside of a duffel bag in Rancho Bernardo, California, near Interstate 15. Cause of death could not be found, but is presumed to be a homicide based on the circumstances. Various clothing items and a blanket were also found in the duffel bag. He was estimated to be between 2 and 4 years old and had light/medium brown hair. Height, weight, and eye color could not be ascertained. He was found wearing a pair of red warm-up pants with white stripes down the sides, a blue vest with a gray hood with \\"Football Power\\" and a yellow football player on the front, a green sweatshirt with \\"Winter Fever\\" and a cartoon surfer on the front, a long sleeved red sweatshirt with a cartoon girl with ponytails and pink heart sunglasses printed on the front and a long sleeved tan/black/red casual shirt (adult sized) with \\"Kamikaze\\" printed on the front and \\"Racing Team\\" printed on the back. The blanket was tan and yellow with a fringe trim. The bag was a green/tan canvas duffel bag with leather handles. Isotope testing found that the victim's mother had spent much of her pregnancy in the southeastern US. The child had likely spent the first year of his life there. A $1000 USD reward is currently being offered for information on the case. He is known as \\"Baby Doe\\" to investigators. Yermo John Doe The burning body of a man aged twenty-five to forty was found near a road on May 8, 2006 in Yermo, San Bernardino County, California. He was presumed to have died approximately one to three hours prior to his discovery. He was a white or Hispanic male at a height of five feet seven inches and a weight of around 140 pounds. Due to the amount of time his remains had been on fire, little clothing survived and his features could not be recognized. However, his DNA, fingerprints and dental information were obtainable. Although he was an adult, two of his teeth had not yet emerged. Yolo County John Doe (2007) On March 29, 2007, a fisherman was spearfishing in a slough on the south side of County Road 22, east of the city of Woodland, California. The fisherman speared a metal cooler, which he then pulled to shore. Inside the cooler, he found the remains of a male baby, aged between one and three months of age. The baby was wearing a disposable diaper, wrapped in a Winnie the Pooh blanket, then in plastic. The ice chest also contained pieces of metal brake rotors, a brick, and numerous metallic fragments. Before his death, the infant had suffered numerous fractures to various portions of his body. He also suffered from porotic hyperostosis. There was also a perimortem fracture to the left tibia Irvine Jane Doe The Irvine Jane Doe was six feet tall at the age of thirteen to twenty-six. In Irvine, Orange County, California, the partially burned body of an African-American female was found on September 5, 2009 in a Pasternack Enterprises parking lot. The victim died less than a day before she was found; her face had not been damaged from the flames and her fingerprints, DNA and dental information were all recovered. She was tall at the age of thirteen to twenty-six, at six feet tall at a weight of 152 pounds. The victim wore a pair of animal-print shorts, a black shirt and distinct high-heels that had a zipper in the front. She also may have worn a black bra, which was burned. She had brown eyes and short to medium-length curly, dark hair. Twenty-nine missing people have been ruled out as the decedent. Her face was reconstructed by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, although the reconstruction erroneously illustrated the girl with shoulder- length hair. San Bernardino Jane Doe (February 2010) Backpack containing the head of the 2010 San Bernardino County Jane Doe In Barstow, San Bernardino County, California, the severed head of a Hispanic female was found concealed in a backpack on February 10, 2010 on the side of a road. She was between fourteen and nineteen years old with brown eyes and brown, straight hair that was shoulder length. Because her head was all that was located, her fingerprints as well as height and weight information could not be obtained. She had died days before, but was not recognizable due to the injuries she sustained. Through examination, it was found that she had many dental fillings and had received very good dental care, possibly indicating she lived in a high socioeconomic class. Mendocino County John Doe (2012)  For years, a Humboldt County, California family kayaked past a half-buried white tennis shoe on the bank of the Eel River. One of their trips occurred on October 30, 2012. When the family noted a second shoe protruding near the first, the father investigated. When he pulled one of the Pro Wing shoes from the dirt, a foot came with it. The family then called the Mendocino County Sheriff's Department to the site, the 83000 block of Hwy 271, Piercy, CA. Once a Halloween prank was ruled out, the skeletal remains were deemed to belong to a homicide victim. They were examined by CSU Chico's Human Identification Laboratory. The remains were determined to be have been buried for several years; they were of a white male 25 to 45 years old, with a stature of 5 feet 11 inches to 6 feet 5 inches. Associated with the remains, besides the shoes, were a rusty jack knife, long underwear pants, and a T-shirt. DNA testing was requested. So was botanical testing on roots intertwined with the bones. However, the best lead for identification is the T-shirt; it was imprinted with \\"Before I started working here I drank, smoked, and used foul language for no reason at all. But thanks to this job, I now have a reason.\\" See also *List of unidentified murder victims in the United States References External links *The Doe Network *National Center for Missing and Exploited Children *National Missing and Unidentified Persons System Category:California-related lists Category:Death in the United States- related lists Category:Lists of victims of crimes Category:United States crime-related lists California ","title":"List of unidentified murder victims in California"},{"id":"43699646","text":"Mirko Radoviƒá (born 15 June 1990) is a Montenegrin handball player for RK Eurofarm Pelister and the Montenegrin national team.

It is endemic to Guyana where it is known from the Kaieteur National Park and the Pacaraima Mountains. However, as it is found along the Guyana‚ÄìBrazil border, it is also possibly present in Brazil. This frog shows maternal care: female frogs can provide tadpoles with trophic eggs. Description Anomaloglossus kaiei are relatively small frogs with males attaining maximum snout‚Äìvent length of about and females . In addition to the small difference in size, males differ from females in colouration, for example by having a cream-coloured belly (versus orangish yellow in females) and a light pink throat dotted with melanophores (pure orangish yellow in females). However, overall colouration is cryptic. Tadpoles are up to in length. =Reproduction= Males are territorial and can be observed calling from on the ground or from elevated sites (e.g., boulders), mostly in morning and after rains. Courtship and ovipositioning behaviours are unknown. However, a male carrying a tadpole has been recorded (a common behaviour among aromobatids). Furthermore, females of this species can provide the tadpoles with trophic eggs. This appears to be a supplement rather than an essential part of their nutrition. Nevertheless, this behaviour probably allows the tadpoles to speed up their development (advantageous in presence of predators or if there is a risk of desiccation), and may lessen cannibalism among the tadpoles. Habitat Anomaloglossus kaiei is mainly known from primary forest, and to lesser extent from disturbed forest, with one specimen found at the savanna edge. It is a terrestrial, diurnal frog, without close association with bodies of water.

Life He was the second son of a Chancery Councillor, who originally wanted him to pursue a legal career, but he displayed an early aptitude for painting. In 1818, he began his studies at the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich, under Johann Peter von Langer, the first Director. While there, he met Peter von Cornelius, who Crown Prince Ludwig von Bayern had brought there to work on the Glyptothek. However, Weller decided that he was more interested in daily life and nature than grand panoramas. For his detailed and meticulous painting technique, he took Peter von Hess as a model. He travelled to Rome in 1825 with his friend, the landscape painter Ernst Fries and was admitted to the Accademia di San Luca. While there, he hiked throughout Italy, as far as Naples. In 1833, he returned to Mannheim. In 1836, he married the daughter of a businessman of Italian origin and moved to Munich. From 1839 to 1848, he was back in Italy, then off to Mannheim again in 1851 when he was appointed Director of the (Art Association), serving as a board member for twenty-three years and eventually becoming Curator. In that capacity, prepared a catalog of his own works, which lists 124 items. He died of a stroke.

Rogell, written by Earl Baldwin, and starring Eddie Quillan, Robert Armstrong, Ginger Rogers, Joan Peers and Ralf Harolde. The film was released on October 16, 1931, by RKO Pictures. Plot Young Tommy Jordan (Eddie Quillan) is sent for a repair job. When he arrives at the address he was told, two guys are waiting for him on the street, bringing him somewhere else - without letting him see where - to repair a radio. He jokes about \\"must be a hide-out, that I should not know where I am\\", for which he earns a \\"you're a smart guy\\". When left in the apartment doing his job, he follows a wire and ends up in the bedroom, lying on the floor under the bed. At this point, the telephone rings and a woman comes out of the bathroom and answers. He is trapped under the bed and can only see her legs. When the lady has finished her conversation, they have to talk and he is told that his great idol Kayo McClure (Robert Armstrong (actor)) a fighter lives in that apartment. She herself is \\"famous\\" Babyface (Ginger Rogers) the woman of McClure. When McClure comes back home, Tommy manages to hide and when Gang leader Nick Vatelli (Ralf Harolde) appears in McClure's apartment with his men threatening him, Tommy acts as Policeofficers through the radio-microphone, so that they leave the flat. McClure is forever thankful to Tommy and he offers him to help him whenever he needs it. McClure hands him out a ticket to a ball. When he gets to the ball there is Baby-Face eager to dance with him. To avoid being mixed up too much with her attracting jealousy of McClure he grabs another girl, that was handy to him, to dance. But this girl is even worse, as she is the fianc√© of Nick, Edna Moreno (Joan Peers). Tommy is very fond of her and when Nick appears he finally takes Edna with him to McClure, to hide for a night. The next day Babyface argues with McClure about hiding the kids, threatening to leave him. Edna leaves the apartment without saying anything. Tommy finds out where she is, and with the help of McClure he saves her from marrying Nick. As the movie ends, Tommy and Edna get married.

Plans to rescue the hostages were accelerated after the execution of journalist James Foley, Steven Sotloff, and Kayla Mueller by ISIS militants. A total of 14 hostages were held hostage by the IS at an undisclosed location. Though no soldiers were killed, the mission failed to locate and rescue the hostages.  History  All three of the beheading victims were American citizens. Foley was working as a freelancer for GlobalPost and other media outlets like Agence France-Presse during the Syrian Civil War when he was captured by ISIS militants in 2012. Sotloff was an American-Israeli journalist who was working as a reporter in Syria before his capture. Mueller was a part of Doctors Without Borders and was captured by ISIS after leaving a hospital in the region. ISIS (Islamic State of Iraq and Syria) is a militant group, established in 2006, that is based and operates in Syria and Iraq, although they are primarily headquartered in Syria. The organization receives funding from oil production and smuggling, taxes, ransoms from kidnappings, selling stolen artifacts, extortion and controlling crops. Foley, Sotloff, and Mueller were kidnapped at varying times and held hostage by ISIS until their deaths. Hostages from other countries were also captured and held for ransom. The United States government does not negotiate with terrorist and refuses to pay ransom to these organizations. However, there are other countries that do not abide by the same policy and paid the ransom for their citizens held captive by ISIS forces. The surviving hostages were instrumental in assisting the United States with locating and targeting the potential hostage house. The US sent the FBI to make contact with former European hostages who were released when their home country paid the ransom. During the FBI's interview with the released hostages (whose names have not been disclosed for security reasons), they were able to compile information about the hostage house and where to locate the hostages within the home.  Mission planning One of the original hostages' ransom was paid by the British government and this individual was released from ISIS. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) was able to locate and contact this individual for questioning in regards to where the remaining hostages were located ‚Äì geographical location and who could be located inside the hostage house ‚Äì and other information that would assist officials in conducting the mission. Statements from the unidentified source along with other intelligence gatherings were then taken to the Pentagon to discuss the specific details of the rescue mission. Officials were aware that the possibility of successfully rescuing all of the hostages without a single American fatality would be slim but the risk was too big not to act. The covert mission was approved and operation planning soon ensued. Operation Once the FBI finished their initial data collection abroad, it was submitted to the Department of Defense for analysis. More information was further compiled as the investigative team raced to assess the location of the home, any persons who may be guarding the home, and any other factors that needed to be assessed. Although there was a fear that the remaining hostages had been moved, ultimately the planning for the covert mission began as the risk of not attempting the rescue mission was too great. In early July, U.S. air strikes were conducted against an ISIS military base camp known as the \\"Osama bin Laden Camp\\" while modified Black Hawk helicopters left from an undisclosed base outside of Syria and traveled towards the suspected hostage house. As the special operations team landed near the home they instantly encountered and killed multiple ISIS members. After landing on the ground, the soldiers blocked the main road towards Raqqa and ambushed the suspected hostage-house in a prison. The special operations team searched the home under the protection of drones circling above, and with ‚Äòwarplanes‚Äô on standby. The raid is said to have involved dozens of special operations forces from all US military services, including the 160th special operations aviation regiment. The special operations team was unable to locate and rescue any hostages. The special operations team conducted house-to-house searches in Uqayrishah. At this time, IS forces from Raqqa began to arrive and a three-hour firefight ensued. During the fighting, militants also directed RPG fire at a U.S. aircraft; a bullet grazed the leg of the pilot. Later, it was reported the hostages had been relocated 24 hours before the attempted rescue. It remained unclear whether the operation failed due to incorrect intelligence or if IS forces had been alerted in advance of the mission. During the home search, the special forces were able to acquire cellphones, hair, half-eaten meals and, blankets for forensic evidence. After searching the home and gathering forensic evidence the operations team returned to the undisclosed base. Aftermath John Kirby, Pentagon Press Secretary during the Syrian Rescue Mission, issued this statement in regard to the failed mission, ‚Äúthe operation involved air and ground components and was focused on a particular captor network within ISIS.‚Äù However, the mission was unsuccessful because the targets were not at the target location. No American forces were killed during the operation; however, during the immediate storming of the suspected location, one ISIS fighter fired at a Black Hawk helicopter, striking the pilot in the leg. A Department of Defense (DOD) official commented on the failure of this mission that, \\"we're not sure why they were moved... By the time we got there, it was too late... a matter of hours, perhaps a day or two.\\" Since the American hostages were moved from their initial location. Defense officials were openly frustrated with the transparency of the administration regarding information of this mission. The National Security Council spokeswoman expressed that they had, \\"never intended to disclose this operation.\\" This issue is extremely concerning and was taken into consideration when President Obama reiterated to the Member States at the Security Council that, \\"foreign fighters were likely to return to their home countries to carry out attacks.\\"  Political aftermath The failure of the operation resulted in backlash from both sides of the political aisle. During an interview, President Obama commented, ‚ÄúWe will do everything we can, short of providing an incentive for future Americans to be caught.\\" Although the policy remains to not negotiate with terrorist organizations, the administration admitted that communication with families could have been improved. In response to this, the administration requested a review of the operation by the National Counterterrorism Center. Nonetheless, families of the victims still criticized the non-negotiating and raised the concern of the timeline for the rescue operation. Despite the concerns, senior officials remarked on the complexity of the operation and deemed the logistical planning of the operation one of the fastest moving approval processes.

O'Reilly worked closely with the producers, costume and make-up departments to find the right look for Naomi, whose style she described as sassy and \\"quite sexual\\". Naomi's initial storylines focused on a reconciliation with her mother, after they fell out over Naomi's affair with a married man. Naomi then tests one of the show's established marriages after she develops feelings for Toadfish Rebecchi (Ryan Moloney) and exploits the problems in his marriage. She also engages in a casual relationship with her much younger neighbour Josh Willis (Harley Bonner). Producers later paired her with Mark Brennan (Scott McGregor) and Paul Robinson (Stefan Dennis), whom she became engaged to. Naomi and her storylines have received mostly positive attention from viewers and critics, with one dubbing her \\"the best new character of the last few years\\" and another calling her \\"a breath of fresh air\\". Creation and casting In October 2013, cast member Colette Mann, who plays Sheila Canning, revealed that her character's daughter was going to be introduced. Producers decided to bring in another member of Sheila's family as they wanted to explore her background further. The producers were also keen to introduce a character similar to Izzy Hoyland (Natalie Bassingthwaighte), who would provoke strong reactions among the characters and viewers. Mann added that the role was in the process of being cast and the character would arrive the following year. On 30 December 2013, it was announced that New Zealand actress Morgana O'Reilly had been cast as Naomi. O'Reilly attended two rounds of auditions before being cast. She and her husband filmed her first audition in their garden in Sydney, before O'Reilly flew to Melbourne to audition in the studio, alongside Mann and Stefan Dennis (Paul Robinson). She competed with five other actresses for the part, but she believed that the role was meant to be hers, as Naomi is both her grandmother's name and her middle name. O'Rielly also said, \\"When I got the scripts, I really loved how Naomi works on lots of levels at all times. That is extremely satisfying to play as an actor.\\" A week after the second audition, O'Reilly's agent informed her that she had won the role. She and her husband then relocated to Melbourne from Sydney to be closer to the studios. O'Reilly was initially offered a three year contract, but she felt that was too long and suggested an 18 month contract instead, which produces agreed to. O'Reilly began filming her first scenes in November 2013 and she made her screen debut as Naomi on 25 March 2014. In July, O'Reilly took two months off from filming in order to perform her one-woman show at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. The break was agreed upon when O'Reilly got the part and she was thankful to the producers for giving her the time off. Development =Characterisation= Before her arrival, O'Reilly said Naomi was \\"a lot of fun\\", but she would be hiding some secrets and it would be interesting to see the lengths she would go to in order to keep them hidden, particularly from her mother. O'Reilly described Naomi as having a \\"good heart\\", but when it came to getting what she wants, some of her actions were \\"questionable\\". She also said Naomi was good at turning a situation to her advantage, and likened her to a cat, as she enjoys the \\"finer things in life\\". The actress continued, \\"On top of all that, she is her mother's daughter. She has the Canning straight up, strength and vulgarity that her genes and upbringing have given her in spades. She's quirky but sophisticated, and at times petulant and silly. All in all, she is very, very fun to play.\\" O'Reilly did not think Naomi was bad, but she was spoilt and always tried to get her own way. However, underneath the surface, she was kind and caring. When asked whether viewers would like Naomi, O'Reilly believed that she could turn out to be a \\"character everyone loves to hate\\". O'Reilly explained that Naomi's style was harder to get right and she worked with the producers, costume and make-up departments to find the right look. The actress said, \\"she has to have a sense of sass and sexuality about her, but she's not cheap and she has worked very hard to shake off her trashy past. What we've come up with is amazing. Some days I put my costume on for a scene and think, 'Oh Naomi, you're outrageous! I could never wear this! Oh well. Go get 'em girl!'\\" O'Reilly thought some of Naomi's outfits complimented her \\"quite sexual\\" nature, especially the six- inch heels and small tops. O'Reilly admitted that she did not have too much in common with Naomi, but they could both be \\"goofy and funny\\". She thought Naomi was definitely not as level-headed as she was in real life. She also said that she enjoyed playing a character who was different from herself. Executive producer Jason Herbison told Sarah Ellis from Inside Soap that he thought Naomi's type of character ‚Äì a \\"classic, troublemaking vixen, who underneath it all is just deeply insecure\\" ‚Äì had been missing from Neighbours for a few years. =Early storylines= Naomi first storyline focused on her unexpected arrival in Erinsborough and her reconciliation with her mother Sheila (Mann), who she had not spoken to in five years. They fell out when Sheila discovered Naomi's affair with a married man and told his wife, which Naomi had never forgiven her for. Naomi's first scenes saw her meeting and flirting with Paul Robinson (Dennis), who was later surprised to learn that she was Sheila's daughter. She then reunited with her mother and her nephew Kyle (Chris Milligan). While Sheila was pleased to see her daughter, she was suspicious of her motives and sudden urge to see her. Mann commented, \\"Sheila has learned the hard way that there is always an agenda with Naomi. Nothing is ever as it seems.\\" When Sheila found a discarded SIM card, she hoped to find some clues as to why her daughter has reappeared in her life. After seeing a lot of number and messages stored on the card, Sheila believed Naomi was having another affair. She then accused Naomi of repeating her past mistakes and \\"a fierce war of words\\" erupted between the two, which resulted in Naomi deciding to leave. Sheila then promised not to interfere in her life and \\"reluctantly\\" offered Naomi a place to stay, until she got back on her feet. A few weeks later, Naomi sold a valuable painting to Paul in order to pay off her debts. However, the painting was given to her by Charles Tranner (David Whiteley), the married man she had an affair with, and his wife, Polly (Michelle O'Grady), soon turned up to reclaim the artwork. O'Reilly explained that as Charles was away on business, there was definite answer as to who the painting belonged to. She continued, \\"Naomi says it was a gift, and belongs to her ‚Äì but Polly argues that Charles used family money to buy it, so she is the owner.\\" Polly and Naomi later ended up in a scrag fight, which had to be broken up the police. O'Reilly enjoyed filming the fight, saying she had \\"a great time\\". The police eventually confiscated the painting and Paul demanded his money back. When Naomi was unable to pay him back, Paul asked her to spend the night with him and he would forget the debt. O'Reilly said while Naomi was not amused, part of her admired Paul's tenacity. =Toadfish Rebecchi= Shortly before Naomi's first scenes were broadcast, Daniel Kilkelly from Digital Spy reported that she would test one of the show's established relationships by setting her sights on a married man. Cast member Ryan Moloney, who plays Toadfish Rebecchi, previously hinted that his character might be tempted by another woman and it was later confirmed that Naomi would develop feelings for Toadie. The storyline began shortly after Toadie hired Naomi to be his new personal assistant at his law office. While Naomi ran the office well, Toadie's wife, Sonya (Eve Morey) did not fully trust her, even after she helped Sonya out with a business problem. Naomi later convinced Toadie that Sonya would be a liability if she attended a meeting with some important clients with him, and then made sure that Sonya was busy when the meeting took place. Sheila, noticing her daughter's \\"intimate\\" celebrations with Toadie at the office, then accused her of trying to seduce another married man. This prompted Naomi to arrange a romantic evening for Toadie and Sonya, while she had dinner with Paul to throw Sheila off the scent. Naomi later signed up for an internet dating website and used it to drive a wedge between Sonya and Toadie. Naomi found a guy she thought would be perfect for Sonya and then asked her and Toadie to come on the date for moral support. Naomi's date ended up having an argument with Sonya, causing Toadie to apologise to Naomi for ruining her date and comforting her. Naomi continued to cause problems for Sonya and Toadie's marriage and when Sonya went away, Naomi decided to make her move. She invited herself over to Toadie's house, where they enjoyed watching DVDs together. Moloney explained that it was all innocent to begin with, but when they began trying out wrestling moves, Toadie should have realised that it was not a good idea. However, Toadie did not stop Naomi and she pinned him to the floor and kissed him. Moloney admitted that Toadie was \\"mortified\\" by the kiss, but it made him realise that he has no emotional investment in Naomi at all. Sheila then told Toadie that Naomi had been trying to seduce him for weeks and Toadie felt \\"duped.\\" Moloney said \\"He trusted Naomi and appreciated their friendship, and now he's been blindsided. He feels utterly betrayed when he discovers the whole situation was premeditated.\\" When Sonya returned home and discovered what Naomi had done, she was furious with her for lying and trying to undermine her marriage. When Naomi and Sonya came face-to-face, Naomi provoked Sonya and blamed her for the troubles in her marriage, causing Sonya to \\"impulsively\\" slap her. Morey admitted that she was uncomfortable about having to film the slapping scene, as she \\"adores\\" O'Reilly. Sonya eventually apologised to Naomi, but told her to stay away from her family and Morey called it a \\"pretty satisfying\\" moment. When asked whether the tension between Sonya and Naomi would continue to be explored, O'Reilly replied that things between them would remain awkward for quite some time. But she hoped that the characters would become friends, as she wanted to share more scenes with Morey. O'Reilly also thought that Sonya was right to trust Toadie when he re-hired Naomi, but stated that it would be harder for Naomi, as she knows that she cannot have Toadie. When Toadie took on a difficult case, his reasons for doing so made Naomi realise that she still had feelings for him. When Sheila then \\"assassinates his character\\", Naomi told her that she was still in love with him. She then quit the law firm, and on the advice of her mother, Naomi chose to distract herself from Toadie by temporarily leaving Erinsborough. Upon her return, Georgia Brooks (Saskia Hampele) learned that Naomi had been in Melbourne instead of Hawaii and Toadie accused her of sending Sonya poison-pen letters. Naomi denied being the sender. =Casual relationship with Josh Willis= In July 2014, Susan Hill from the Daily Star reported that Naomi would begin a casual relationship with her much younger neighbour Josh Willis (Harley Bonner). Josh was trying to get over his long-term relationship with Amber Turner (Jenna Rosenow), which ended when she left him for Daniel Robinson (Tim Phillipps), and he turned to Naomi for comfort. As there was a large age gap between Josh and Naomi, they decided to keep their fling a secret. O'Reilly told Mark James Lowe from All About Soap that the relationship came out of the blue for Naomi and she definitely did not plan for it to happen. The actress also told Lowe that she was not surprised when she received the storyline and compared Naomi's life to \\"a really trashy novel.\\" After Josh started showing interest in her, Naomi decided to \\"take the bull by the horns and go for it!\\" Josh and Naomi had sex in a hotel elevator and O'Reilly said the scenes were not awkward to film, as Bonner's sense of humour made the shoot fun. She also said that Naomi was not worried about taking advantage of Josh, as she was more worried about Sheila's reaction if she found out. Naomi was trying to get her life back under control and she did not want to ruin her relationship with her mother again. The relationship was almost discovered by Sheila when she returned home unexpectedly and interrupted Naomi and Josh. Naomi forced Josh to hide outside in the garden wearing nothing but his underwear. Naomi ended the affair after Josh's mother, Terese (Rebekah Elmaloglou), found out about it and confronted Naomi. O'Reilly thought Naomi was well suited to Josh as they had \\"similar energies\\", but ultimately he was too young for her. =Brother and career change= In November 2014, Naomi was reunited with her older brother Gary Canning (Damien Richardson), after he decided to extend his stay in Erinsborough to reconcile with Sheila and Kyle. Naomi was angry with her mother's \\"blatant favouritism\\" of Gary and urged him to reveal the truth about his past and the reason why he abandoned his family. When Kyle's work tools were stolen, Naomi made \\"more damning accusations\\" against Gary. After Sheila learned that Gary had committed a violent assault, she had a heart attack. Naomi discovered her mother and she was rushed to the hospital, where \\"an incensed\\" Naomi then revealed to Kyle the full truth about Gary's criminal history. Needing a new job, Naomi decided to start her own events business, and took on the role of organising the local Christmas carols at the Lassiter's Complex. Naomi faced difficulties with the event when the \\"Santa Union\\" refused to provide a Father Christmas or Snowman, forcing Naomi to ask her mother and neighbour Susan Kennedy (Jackie Woodburne) for help. The event then came under threat from a councillor, who informed Naomi that she did not have the correct insurance. Once the issue was sorted, the carols went ahead as planned. Naomi's next job was to plan the Erinsborough Festival. Local businessman Dennis Dimato (David Serafin) approached Paul and Naomi about sponsoring the event, but when Mark Brennan (Scott McGregor) informed them that Dimatio had \\"a dodgy past\\", Paul and Naomi turned down his offer. O'Reilly thought the development was interesting as the old Naomi would have teamed up with Dimato. Dimato later tried to bribe Naomi and Brennan encouraged her to go to the police, but she refused and gave the money back. Brennan confronted Dimato, who then cornered Naomi and threatened her for talking about the bribe. O'Reilly commented that Naomi was annoyed at Brennan's interference, as she felt she could handle Dimato. She continued, \\"She's tough as nails. She would never admit there is danger there ‚Äì and especially not to Brennan!\\" Matt Turner (Josef Brown) later asked for Naomi's help, so the police could build a case against Dimato. Naomi gave a statement even though she was still receiving threats from Dimato and his men. Dimato later targeted Sheila, forcing Naomi to retract her statement. Matt tried to get her to change her mind, but it was only when Sheila learned what she had done and told her to re-submit her statement, that Naomi agreed. =Mark Brennan and Paul Robinson= Naomi's friendship with Brennan eventually turned into a romance, after they grew closer during the Dimato situation. O'Reilly said that Naomi was initially \\"oblivious\\" to Brennan's feelings for her. She told an Inside Soap columnist that Naomi was wary of Brennan and figured that he was not ready for a relationship, but neither was she. During a yoga session, Naomi and Brennan flirted heavily and eventually shared a kiss. Naomi tried to take the relationship slowly as she was scared of being hurt. Naomi and Brennan later declared themselves an official couple, despite Naomi's insecurities. When Naomi saw Brennan exchange glances with his ex-girlfriend Paige Smith (Olympia Valance), she became anxious about her relationship and questioned Brennan as to who he wanted to be with ‚Äì her or Paige. As Naomi and Brennan's relationship started to \\"gain ground\\", Naomi was hired to be Paul's executive assistant and she was told in confidence that he had been diagnosed with leukaemia. Naomi began to do everything to help Paul and a TV Soap columnist noted \\"although their working relationship has often been a tense one, Paul and Naomi have always managed to make it work.\\" While Naomi home- nursed Paul, her mother became suspicious, worrying that it might impact on Naomi's relationship with Brennan. This forced Paul to defend their connection. When Paul was later informed that his body was no longer responding to the chemotherapy, he started putting his affairs in order and showed a vulnerable side to Naomi. While comforting him, Naomi was \\"overcome with emotion\\" and she kissed Paul. Despite trying to make their relationship more professional, Naomi realised that she had developed feelings for Paul and she decided to break up with Brennan. Paul and Naomi eventually embarked on a relationship, but faced problems early on when she interfered in his family business by contacting his estranged daughter Amy Williams (Zoe Cramond). Paul confronted Naomi in public, but with Sheila supporting her, Naomi refused to apologise and threatened to quit her job and their relationship. Paul later apologised to Naomi, as he bonded with Amy. O'Reilly believed Paul and Naomi's relationship would \\"stand the test of time\\" and joked that their pairing would be part of Neighbours history. Paul and Naomi's romance was tested when Naomi learned of Paul's involvement in her brother's crime, and when Paul questioned whether she was still in love with Toadie, following an accident that was her fault. Naomi told him that she admired Toadie as he was a good man, something that Paul was not. Paul promised to be a better man and later proposed to Naomi. The proposal surprised Naomi, as they had only been dating for a few months, but she \\"feels duty bound\\" to accept. Naomi instantly had second thoughts and when Paul wanted to tell everyone, in the hope that it might boost his mayoral position, she asked him to keep their engagement a secret. Naomi and Paul's relationship eventually ended after she had a one-night stand with Josh. Paul asked if they could try and work out their differences, but Naomi declined and he told her she would not amount to anything. =Departure= Following her split from Paul, Naomi learned that she had secured her dream job in the United States. She left Erinsborough after saying goodbye to her family and friends. The day after her exit aired in Australia, it was confirmed that O'Reilly had permanently left Neighbours to pursue new career opportunities after the birth of her daughter. Of her exit, Herbison commented \\"The Neighbours audience fell in love with Naomi instantly and we have certainly left the door wide open for her to rejoin the Cannings in the future ‚Äì Sheila wouldn't have it any other way.\\" =Return= On 27 April 2020, it was confirmed O'Reilly had reprised the role and she returned on 7 May. Naomi comes back to Erinsborough to support her mother following Gary's death. O'Reilly told Sarah Ellis of Inside Soap that Kyle contacts Naomi when he becomes worried about Sheila's state of mind, as she has started talking to a bird. The actress said that coincidentally Naomi is having some trouble in Los Angeles, where she has been living and working, so she takes it as a sign to leave and return to Erinsborough. She also told Ellis, \\"On one hand, it's food for the soul to be back with her family. But on the other hand, Naomi is facing the past, and everyone has their opinion about her. She knows she has to work extra hard to prove she's a new person.\\" Sheila is initially overjoyed to see her daughter, until she realises that Naomi is back to talk sense into her. Naomi also notices the tension between Sheila and Susan, and realises that getting them talking could help Sheila move on. O'Reilly commented that Naomi \\"feels deeply for her mum, but also wants to push her to kick start her life again\\". Naomi locks both women in the Willis house, giving them a chance to talk and let down their guard. The character was also revealed to have a connection to series regular Pierce Greyson (Tim Robards). O'Reilly said that Naomi and Pierce \\"have a shared wild past\\" from their time in Sydney, and she is still attracted to him. Reception Naomi and her storylines have received mostly positive attention from critics. Ahead of Naomi's on-screen introduction, TV Week's Rebecca Lake said it was about time the show got \\"a new vixen\\" and thought she looked like quite a \\"sexy character\\". Daniel Kilkelly (Digital Spy) believed Naomi was \\"bound to stir up trouble\\" following her arrival. Ben Pobjie from The Sydney Morning Herald commented that Naomi acted like \\"an idiot\\" during the painting storyline. While a reporter for What's on TV branded the character \\"Naughty Naomi\\" and thought she got \\"the slap she so richly deserved from Sonya\\" after she kissed Toadie. O'Reilly's co-star Eve Morey observed, \\"Naomi is a femme fatale. She's opportunistic and manipulative.\\" Bridget Jones from New Idea stated that Naomi was \\"sweet-at- heart\\". In August 2014, Inside Soap's Michael Cregan expressed his love for the character, commenting \\"We love Neighbours' Naomi and her flirty ways.\\" Cregan also thought the storyline involving Josh was \\"saucy stuff\\". While Stephen Downie from TV Week quipped, \\"The romance between Josh and Naomi has a use-by date but, much like the couple, we're willing to enjoy this ride while it lasts.\\" Claire Crick from All About Soap praised the couple, even though she thought they were complete opposites. Crick also loved their \\"hilarious secret hook-ups\\". O'Reilly was concerned about how her character would be received by viewers, especially when she went after Toadie, but she was pleased with the positive reaction to Naomi. During a feature on what storylines were working and not working for the show, a Soap World columnist praised the character, saying \\"Naomi Canning has been perhaps the best new character of the last few years. Her cougar/cub sex fling with Josh is pure hotness and tends towards the controversial, thus providing good watercooler moments for fans.\\" The columnist also enjoyed Naomi's feud with her mother, as it led to some strong scenes between the two women. However, they criticised Naomi's attempts to seduce Toadie, believing that it was not well executed and for a character \\"designed to be a husband-stealing minx\\" her pursuit was \\"tepid at best\\". During his review of the show in 2014, Digital Spy's Daniel Kilkelly praised O'Reilly's addition to the cast, saying \\"Naomi has also been a breath of fresh air as a character who will push the boundaries just that little bit more than many of her neighbours!\\" In 2015, Kerry Barrett from All About Soap placed Naomi at number 29 on the magazine's list of 30 favourite Neighbours characters. Barrett quipped \\"Spoilt, bratty, kooky, sexy Naomi hasn't been in Ramsay Street for long, but she's definitely made her mark!\\". Barrett thought Naomi's best moment was \\"getting jiggy with Josh in a lift!\\" A reporter for The New Zealand Herald stated \\"business savvy, attention commanding, bossy; Naomi was a woman who knew what she wanted and always put herself first.\\" References External links * Naomi Canning at the Official AU Neighbours website * Naomi Canning at the Official UK Neighbours website Category:Neighbours characters Category:Television characters introduced in 2014 Category:Fictional secretaries Category:Female characters in television ","title":"Naomi Canning"},{"id":"43699814","text":"The Celtic Manor Resort, where the meeting was held The 2014 Wales Summit of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) was a meeting of the heads of state and heads of government of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, held in Newport, Wales on 4 and 5 September 2014. Such summits are sporadically held, and allow leaders and officials from NATO Allies to discuss current issues of mutual concern and to plan strategic activities. The 2014 summit has been described by US Navy Admiral James Stavridis as the most important since the fall of the Berlin Wall. Background The summit was hosted by British Prime Minister David Cameron. Attendees included Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, US President Barack Obama, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Fran√ßois Hollande, Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi and Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy. US Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel, walking in the grounds of the Celtic Manor Resort There were another 180 VIPs, and 4,000 delegates and officials from approximately 60 countries. The official logo for the summit included a panel with four quadrants, each bearing a stylised symbol of Newport or Wales: a Celtic knot, the Welsh Dragon, Newport Transporter Bridge and a Welsh castle. The entrance to the venue was fronted by a full-scale replica of a Eurofighter Typhoon. Agenda NATO Foreign Ministers' dinner, Royal Welsh College of Music & Drama, 4 September 2014 World leaders met at the Celtic Manor, and informally at other locales in and around Cardiff. They discussed ongoing events in the world, such as terrorism, cyber warfare, and other areas of national security interest to the member states. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko had a joint discussion with EU big four leaders and US President Barack Obama before the official start of the Summit, to discuss the crisis with Russia. Outcomes Petro Poroshenko and Quint leaders (Hollande, Obama, Cameron, Renzi and Merkel) discussing the crisis with Russia The following declarations and agreements were made at the Summit: *Wales Summit Declaration *Joint Expeditionary Force agreement * Armed Forces Declaration *Joint Statement of the NATO-Ukraine Commission *Declaration on Afghanistan *The Wales Declaration on the Transatlantic Bondhttps://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/official_texts_112985.htm?selectedLocale=en At the end of the summit Ukrainian President Poroshenko announced a ceasefire which had been agreed with one of the leading pro-Russia separatist leaders, under terms proposed by Russian President Vladimir Putin, which was cautiously welcomed by NATO leaders. ;Wales Pledge For the first time, the Allies formally pledged to aim to move towards what had previously been an informal guideline of spending 2% of their gross domestic products on defense, and 20% of that on new equipment. For countries which spend less than 2% they agreed upon that these countries \\"aim to move towards the 2% guideline within a decade\\". In 2015, five of its 28 members met that goal. At the beginning of 2018, eight of the 29 members either were meeting the target or were close to it; six others had laid out plans to reach the target by 2024 as promised; and Norway and Denmark had unveiled plans to substantially boost defense spending (including Norway's planned purchase 52 new F-35 fighter jets). Further outcomes were the development of the Readiness Action Plan and the Defence and Related Security Capacity Building Initiative.Defence and Related Security Capacity Building Initiative Criticism Anti-NATO protests in central Cardiff Protests, demonstrations and marches took place in Newport and Cardiff involving several hundred people, though the turnout was much lower than predicted. A retired German politician, , former defence secretary of state (until 2002) and former head of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (until 1991), criticised the summit agenda for its focus on military details and not political perspectives. St√ºtzle said that the Russian Federation was not a military threat to NATO but criticised that new NATO members' policies were not d√©tente and negotiation with the Russian Federation. Security Cardiff Castle during the summit, showing NATO flags and the \\"ring of steel\\". In both Newport and Cardiff, road closures and security measures, starting weeks in advance of the summit, created widespread disruption. of security fencing, high, was erected around the Newport hotel venue and of fencing put up around Cardiff city centre. Businesses in the vicinity of security fencing in Cardiff reported a drop in trade by up to a third. This fencing was based on, and expanded, the 'National Barrier Asset' which is held in reserve for similar events. Security included around 9,500 specially trained police officers patrolling the streets of the two cities, military helicopters including US Osprey V22s and the Royal Navy's new ¬£1bn Type 45 destroyer .

Early life She was the elder daughter of Walter Henry Brown (1893/4‚Äì1956), a Ministry of Works civil servant, and his wife, Gerda Lois Brown, n√©e Grenside (1885‚Äì1961), an artist.

He primarily stars in jiangshi films and martial arts films. Performing experience Chung Fat, member of the Han ethnicity, was a disciple of Madame Fan Kuk-fa of The Spring and Autumn Drama School. When he was a teenager, he was a Northern Praying Mantis practitioner with Lam Ching-ying, under Madame Fok guidance. He became proficient in a great variety of martial arts weapons and techniques. Chung Fat debuted very early at the silver screen, shooting \\"Enter the Dragon\\" (1973) with Bruce Lee. Chung stated, \\"You need thousands of extras, some of which must be at the pinnacle of martial arts, Lam Ching-ying was the fellow with the opportunity when they were hiring extras\\". Chung Fat played a small role as an island security guard that was hanged in the end. With that opportunity, he entered in the movies circle, being at the front line more than 30 years, in addition to his jiangshi-themed films. Chung only had three protagonist roles in his career, but instead, he was often cast in supporting or secondary or mainly villain roles. He also has worked as a director, choreographer, and planner. He had a long-term collaboration with Jackie Chan and Sammo Hung. In the 21st Century his film apparitions had basically fade out, making mainly commercials. However, in 2013 he was invited back to the silver screen by Juno Mak to film his new jiangshi film, \\"Rigor Mortis\\" and help to fight off those new vampire-zombies.

He and his three older brothers started careers in teaching (the older three were all rising young professors in college). In the 1940s all were banned from teaching in New York because of earlier affiliations with communist organizations. Foner became a union activist and leader, serving as FLM president from 1961 to 1988. Background Henry Foner was born on March 23, 1919, the youngest of four brothers. He was raised in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York. His father Abraham Foner delivered seltzer; his mother Mary Smith was a homemaker. He and his three older brothers all became active in leftist politics. Two brothers (Philip and Jack) became professional historians. The other two brothers (Moe and Henry) were union activists, although Moe first taught in college, too. Foner was said to be a member of the Young Communist League as a youth, and later wrote a song called \\"Love in the YCL.\\" He attended Eastern District High School and earned a degree in business administration from the City College of New York in 1939, near the end of the Great Depression. Career Foner began his work career by organizing an anti-World War II puppet show. Like his older brothers, he began teaching at the Samuel J. Tilden High School. (Unlike the other three, who completed graduate degrees and became university professors, Foner taught high school.) Colleagues there included future comedian Sam Levenson. From 1942 to 1946 during and after World War II, Foner served in the U.S. Army in Italy and Austria (where he was part of the occupation forces). He was awarded the Legion of Merit and the Italian Military Valor Cross. After his return from the war, Foner resumed teaching, as a substitute in stenography and typewriting at Prospect Heights High School, from 1946 to 1948. After passing his teaching exam, in 1948 he was blocked by the Rapp-Coudert Committee from formal appointment due to earlier involvement in the American Student Union and Young Communist League. Fear of communism in the United States was rising. \\"Both Philip and Jack [Foner} were fired from teaching posts in the City University of New York in 1941 during a purge by the New York State Legislature's Rapp-Coudert Committee, which also cost Moe his administrative post at City College and Henry his job as a substitute teacher in New York high schools.\\" With all four brothers banned from teaching, they formed a jazz band and played at Jewish resorts in the Catskill Mountains: Henry played saxophone and composed songs (see \\"Songs\\" below). Unions Foner became a labor union leader and social activist. According to Ron Radosh, at least, he was a \\"lifelong fellow traveler\\", aligned with socialist and communist causes. ). From 1940 to 1948, Foner was a member of the Teachers Union. In 1948, still denied a career in education, he became director for welfare and education at what was then the Joint Board Fur Dressers' and Dryers' Union, later known as the Joint Board, Fur, Leather and Machine Workers Union (\\"FLM\\"). In 1961, Foner was elected as FLM president, being re-elected and serving until 1988. The union represented members in the Mid-Atlantic states of New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia. Over the years, he worked on issues from promoting civil rights to protesting the Vietnam War. He served as vice-chairman of the Liberal Party of New York. In 1973, Foner went to Spain to observe a Carabanchel Ten trial. Foner has said that, during his decades in the FLM, he worked to keep the union free of corruption, and to insulate the union from criticism that it was Communist-led. For the latter goal, Foner helped to arrange a merger of the FLM with the Amalgamated Meat Cutters union in the late 1950s.He also \\"helped to organize union representation at the Labor Assembly for Peace in Chicago.\\" He was a \\"leader of the Liberal Party\\" (of New York), founded in 1944 by George Counts as alternative to the American Labor Party which was perceived to be unduly influenced by communists. (Co-founders of the Liberal Party included: David Dubinsky of the ILGWU, Alex Rose of the Hat, Cap and Millinery Workers, theologian Reinhold Niebuhr, and teacher-turned-politician Ben Davidson.) Retirement In 1988, Foner retired from the union. For many years, he taught labor history and wrote a column for the journal Jewish Currents. He also served on its editorial board. He served as president of the Paul Robeson Foundation. He also served as editor of Work History News (newsletter of the New York Labor History Association. In 2000, he co-founded Labor Arts. Foner was also a songwriter. He co-wrote (with Norman Franklin) the musical, Thursdays 'Til Nine, presented in 1947 by the Department Store Employees Union. He performed for the Catskills Institute on many occasions. Recordings of his several performances from 1997 to 2004 are available. He was a long- time friend of Pete Seeger, whom he knew for more than 60 years. Seegar played for numerous rallies and marches for his union. \\"Seeger was a member of the New York Labor History Association. In 2009, he played his five-string banjo and other instruments at the 90th birthday celebration of his friend and comrade, Henry Foner.\\" In 2009, he gave an interview about his life experiences: > Foner discusses his background as a political activist, musician, and > teacher.

Personal and death Foner was the youngest of four brothers who became prominent in New York City: * Jack D. Foner (1910-1999): historian, twin of Philip S. Foner (and father of historian Eric Foner) * Philip S. Foner (1910-1994), historian and political activist, twin of Jack D. Foner * Moe Foner (1916-2002): trade union activist In 1948, he married Lorraine Lieberman (March 2, 1923 ‚Äì April 22, 2002).

NCS is internationally recognized as a discrete and unique product by the FAO since 1964 and by the World Customs Organization (WCO) since 2007. WCO defines NCS as \\"cane sugar obtained without centrifugation\\". It also states that \\"the product contains only natural anhedral microcrystals, of irregular shape, not visible to the naked eye, which are surrounded by residues of molasses and other constituents of sugar cane\\". NCS is produced in most sugarcane growing regions of the world, being known by many different names such as panela, jaggery, or gur. Some varieties of muscovado are non-centrifugal. Non- centrifugal cane sugar (jaggery) production near Inle Lake (Myanmar). Crushing and boiling stage. Composition NCS contains over 90% carbohydrate, sucrose being the predominant (near 80%) sugar. It also contains minerals (up to 3%), mainly calcium, potassium, sodium, chloride and phosphates, but also a number of essential nutrients or oligo-elements including iron, zinc, magnesium, copper, cobalt, nickel and chromium. The particular chemical composition of NCS depends on the cane variety used, the soils on which it was grown, the fertilization applied and the processing methods. Economy Generally produced for local markets, NCS probably was the dominant form of cane sugar consumption before the advent of large-scale production of refined sugar for export markets after 1700. Today, NCS has practically disappeared in most non- sugarcane producing countries, as it is traded internationally only in small amounts. However, NCS remains important in most sugarcane producing countries, as shown by the average share in the daily consumption of caloric sweeteners (g/person/day, 2007) in the following countries: Myanmar 46%; Bangladesh 20%; Colombia 19%; India 10%; Pakistan 10%. Most of NCS is produced on small scale in farms which process their own sugar cane using traditional technology. Production appears inefficient and its quality uneven. In some countries, such as India, Colombia, Brazil and Costa Rica, a larger scale NCS industry exists, which process cane from outside farmers using improved technology, which is centered on more efficient energy use and better processing to obtain homogeneous quality and scale-savings. According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) world NCS production has been practically stagnant since the mid 1980s, after modest increases in the previous twenty years, stabilizing at about 12 to 14 million metric tons per year. The real amount produced may be greater given the difficulties in tracking small scale on-farm production. However, whilst production of NCS has been declining in Asia, it has been rising, even if only slowly, in Latin America. NCS production in Latin America reached an all-time high in 2011, surpassing the two million metric ton level for the first time. This compares to around 1.6 million tons 20 years earlier. In Colombia, the share of sugarcane allocated to production of NCS is now the highest worldwide, at 40%. In Brazil, output rose from an estimated 280,000 tons in 2005 to 470,000 tons in 2011. NCS is traded mostly locally in un-branded, solid presentations, such as blocks, cones or other shapes. Such a feature limits its consumption given the difficulties involved in dealing with these solid presentations in the kitchen and in industry. In some countries (for example, Colombia, Ecuador, Venezuela and Costa Rica) solid NCS is being progressively replaced by user-friendly, branded, granulated presentations, often packed in plastic or paper bags for use at home and also as an industrial sweetener for the preparation of beverages and many other processed foods. It is also used to produce alcoholic beverages such as rum, and as a substrate for fermentation processes to produce alcohol and other derivatives. The international trade in NCS has been small and decreasing, reaching more recently levels in the order of 50,000 tons per year. Again, the true quantities are probably greater, as NCS is classified in different ways by importing countries. The introduction of the granulated presentation has permitted the development of a small specialty market in Europe, U.S. and Japan supplied by at least a few producers from India, Costa Rica, Colombia and Brazil. Technology NCS is clean dried sugar cane juice. Given the high sugar content of cane juice NCS is essentially made up of crystals of sucrose mixed with molasses, and many additional constituents of cane juice, like inverted sugars (glucose and fructose), minerals, vitamins, organic acids, and other trace substances, many still unknown. Depending on its manufacturing process it is either presented in solid form, known as lump sugar, or granulated form. Manufacturing process The basic manufacture process of NCS involves juice extraction, physical elimination of impurities and clarification of the juice, evaporation of the water content of the juice, crystallization, eventually drying and packaging. The cane juice is generally extracted from cleaned and eventually shredded cane stalks by mechanical processes, commonly with simple crushers consisting of three metal rollers. It is filtered to separate bagasse particles and/or allowed to settle so to eliminate solid impurities. Clarification is carried out to coagulate the particulates, which come to the surface during boiling and are skimmed off. A variety of materials are used, such as plant material, ash, etc. With the aim of neutralizing the juice, which facilitates the formation of sugar crystals, lime or sulfur dioxide are added. In some of the larger factories the juice is filtered and chemically clarified. Water evaporation is achieved by boiling, mostly in open pans, either in a single or in a series of pans located above a furnace. Larger factories use vacuum pans. In the last step of evaporation crystallization is achieved, either by pouring the heavy syrup into suitable molds to obtain solid forms or by stirring the syrup to obtain granulated product. The granulated product may be dried to enhance its flow and shelf life. Both solid and granulated presentations are then packed. Nutrition and health The progressive loss of worldwide importance of NCS is a typical case of the displacement of a traditional product by an industrialized alternative, in this case by refined sugar and other caloric and non-caloric sweeteners, as judged from the decreasing relative importance of NCS within caloric sweetener consumption. This is part of broader changes in global food consumption patterns characterized by a large increase in refined foods, especially fats, sugar and flours. This pattern, part of a more general nutrition transition, has been linked to the development of diseases such as obesity, diabetes and strokes, which have taken on epidemic proportions in many countries. Increasing recognition of the negative impacts of current dominant diets and sedentary behavioral patterns may help reverse such a pattern and hopefully allow better health upon aging. \\"Natural\\" and \\"organic\\" products appear increasingly popular, attaining significant market shares in many countries. Conversely, refined and \\"industrial\\" products tend to be negatively perceived, among them specially refined sugar and non-caloric sweeteners. This might open opportunities for the revival of NCS consumption.

She was aged between 14 and 18 at the time of her murder on either October 31 or November 1, 1980 Of the thousands of people murdered each year in the United States, many decedents remain unidentified. Including murder victims and individuals whose death is via natural causes or accident, approximately 40,000 decedents remain unidentified in the United States. The cases of unidentified victims within this article are those of individuals discovered in Texas. In most of these cases, the murders remain unsolved.  \\"Mr. X\\" (1972)  On December 11, 1972, a rancher in Johnson County, Texas, was investigating an area where buzzards were circling, when he discovered the nude body of a young, white male. The man had been shot to death with a small caliber handgun. He was estimated to be about 30 years old and was approximately 5 feet 6 inches tall. He had short, curly, brown hair. His weight and eye color could not be ascertained, as various foraging animals had caused extensive damage to the body. He was soon buried in a pauper's grave in Rose Hill Cemetery in Cleburne, Texas. in 2013, his body was exhumed for DNA analysis. The DNA Doe Project was asked to assist with the man's identification in May, 2019. So far, he has gone multiple rounds of DNA extraction and sequencing, with unusable results. He is currently slated for another extraction. Harris County John Doe (1973) A white or Hispanic male between 15 and 18 years old was found buried in a Harris County boat shed in August 1973. This youth is the only still-unidentified victim of serial killer Dean Corll, who, together with two teenage accomplices, killed at least 28 boys and young men between 1970 and 1973. This decedent was between 5 feet 2 and 5 feet 7 inches tall, had dark brown hair, approximately seven inches in length, and is believed to have worn multicolored, striped swim trunks, boots, and a shirt displaying a peace symbol. These items were found near his body. He had received good dental care, and had never received any teeth fillings in his lifetime. It is known that he suffered from a mild form of spina bifida. DNA testing conducted in 2008 did not match any missing person report. A forensic examination of the remains of this decedent, in addition to the circumstantial fact that he was buried between two identified victims of Dean Corll (killed in August 1971 and July 1972), indicated that he was most likely murdered in either 1971 or 1972.  \\"Disco Dan\\"  On April 3, 1970, the partial remains of a young white male were discovered in a drainage culvert in Hewitt, Texas. He had been shot to death. The man was estimated to be between 20 and 30 years old, was 5 feet 8 inches tall, and weighed 128 pounds. He had light brown hair with a mustache and goatee, and brown eyes. He also had three tattoos: one on his upper left arm of a cross inside of a heart, one on his left forearm that read \\"PEACE\\", and one on his upper right arm that read \\"BB\\". He was found wearing a longs sleeve button-up shirt with a white and blue pattern, Levi brand jeans, white tube socks with red and blue stripes, brown Wellington boots, a necklace made of white puka shells and large black beads, and a silver Snoopy medallion. Investigators believe he had been killed elsewhere and deposited at the location. He was buried in an unmarked grave in McLennan County Restland Cemetery, however the location of his body is unknown. Walker County Jane Doe A teenage female whose body was discovered approximately six hours after she died on October 31 or November 1, 1980. Henry Lee Lucas has been named as a potential suspect in this case, although a bite mark found upon the decedent's shoulder was inconsistent with Lucas's dentistry. She was estimated to be between the ages of 14 and 18 years old with brown hair and brown or hazel eyes. She had claimed to a waitress that she was 19 but the waitress did not believe her. She was described as wearing a yellow pullover sweater and red heeled sandals. She was also wearing a square or rectangular pendent necklace with a smokey blue or brown stone. The necklace was found on the body and the shoes were nearby but none of her clothing was located. When her body was found it was determined she had only been dead for several hours. It is unknown if the girl had actually been conventionally raped, although she had been viciously sexually assaulted with a large foreign object. A truck driver had seen her body on the north bound side of highway 45 about a mile north of The Hitchin Post truck stop. The waitress who spoke to her claimed the girl told her she was from the Aransas Pass/Rockport area but no missing persons were reported in that area around the time of her death.  Harris County Jane Doe (1980)  On December 10, 1980, a young African American female was found lying under a mattress, under Interstate 45, about six miles north of downtown Houston, Texas. Investigators could not find a conclusive cause of death. She was estimated to be between 16 and 26 years old, was 5 feet 2 inches tall, and weighed 135 pounds. She had black hair styled in cornrows and pigtails, and brown eyes, as well as scars on her left wrist. Residual pink/red nail polish was found on her hands, and there was evidence that she was a nail-biter. She was found wearing a pink pant-suit with a vest, and two necklaces; one with a dog tag-shaped pendant, and four bracelets. Investigators believe that she may have been a victim of the infamous I-45 Killer. Harris County Does (1981) A young man and woman who were found in January 1981. They were killed approximately two months earlier and left in Houston.  Grimes County Jane Doe  On October 29, 1981, the partial skeletal remains of a teenage, white female were discovered by a TxDOT worker on Farm Route 244 in Grimes County, Texas, just south of Iola. She had died of blunt force trauma to the head, and had been dead for anywhere between a few months to five years. She was estimated to be between 13 and 19 years old, was between 5 feet 1 inch and 5 feet 5 inches tall, and weighed 110 pounds. She had red/dark auburn hair, and had evidence of previously healed fractures to her ribs, breastbone, and toe area. Investigators believe she was right handed. She was found wearing pink bikini panties, a ring with a replica 20-dollar American gold piece, and a white towel. She was found wrapped in a large plastic bag with a rag commonly used by mechanics inside, as well. Investigators believe that her body was stored in a closet for a few years before moving the body to the location. Investigators also searched the area for missing children, however none were reported missing at the time.  Plainview Jane Doe  On February 16, 1982, the decomposed and nude remains of a small, young, white female were discovered on a dirt road in the desert, just outside of Plainview, Texas. Her head was not found at the scene, nor recovered. Cause of death was not determined, but is believed to be a homicide, as she was found with her hands bound behind her back. She was estimated to be between 19 and 21 years old, was between 4 feet 9 inches and 5 feet 2 inches tall, and weighed between 95 and 105 pounds. Henry Lee Lucas claimed to have been responsible for the murder, however his confession is not considered to be plausible. A few days after the body was recovered, a skull was discovered in the same area. Investigators believe that the skull belonged to the unidentified woman, however when DNA testing was done on the skull in 2015, it was determined that it belonged to a different person. The DNA Doe Project was asked to assist with the woman's identification in May, 2019.  Montgomery County Jane Doe (1983)  On May 13, 1983, the decomposing remains of a young white female were discovered by a group of schoolchildren in a wooded area behind a 76 truck stop on US Route 59 in New Caney, Texas. She had been killed by two blows to the head, which caused skull fractures. She was estimated to be between 15 and 22 years old, was 4 feet 11 inches tall, and weighed between 78 and 95 pounds. She had long, dark brown hair. She was found wearing a pair of Shades brand designer blue jeans, a tan Wrangler brand long sleeve T-shirt, and a pair of white panties. The area in which her body was found was a spot typically used for tractor-trailers to park. Harris County Jane Doe (1985) The Harris County Jane Doe, found in 1985, had a tattoo of the letter \\"V\\" on her arm On August 12, 1985, the body of a Hispanic female aged between 16 and 35 was found inside a vacant store. Her body was discovered alongside that of a man who was identified as Thomas Rodriguez, and her death had occurred hours prior to her discovery. She was between five feet and five feet two inches, and weighed approximately 120 to 140 pounds. Other distinctive details regarding this decedent include two sets of distinctive earrings she had worn which contained beads and shells, a tattoo of the letter 'V' on her upper left arm, and a scar resulting from her gallbladder being removed. A necklace with an arrowhead and turquoise stone design was also found on the girl's neck. It is unknown how both victims were placed at the scene. Bexar County Jane Doe On March 26, 1986, a black woman was shot multiple times and left near a railroad. She was between 18 and 25, standing 5 feet, 11 inches tall. The body had gone undiscovered for approximately three weeks to three months. The motive for the murder was apparently an argument. √Ångel Maturino Res√©ndiz, a serial killer, confessed to her murder, claiming he had also killed the woman's boyfriend, whose remains are yet to be found. The woman wore a white gold ring, a striped blue short skirt, and a flannel jacket, which was also striped. She was believed to have been native to Florida, her first name reported to possibly be Norma. The woman, along with her boyfriend, has never been identified. Res√©ndiz apparently killed seventeen others. Live Oak Doe An African American subject, 20 to 30 years old, who was likely a trans woman or a drag queen, was pronounced dead after being transported to a hospital when found unresponsive on July 10, 1986, in Live Oak, Harris County, Texas. The cause of death was strangulation, which may have been done with pantyhose. The subject was dressed in pink pants, a gray shirt, and a black belt with spikes. A pair of socks was under the shirt, likely used to mimic breasts. A heart tattoo containing a scroll was on one arm, and the victim's fingernails had been painted gold at one point. Four earrings were found in each ear; a ring with a clear stone, a ring without a stone, a silver chain, and two gold-colored necklaces were also found. The victim may have had a drug history, as needle marks were visible on the arms. The DNA Doe Project was asked to assist with identifying the body in January, 2020.  \\"New York Billy\\"  On August 3, 1986, several persons in Crater Lake observed what appeared to be a body floating in the water. When authorities responded, they found the decomposed body of a young white male. He had been shot to death and had been dead for about a week. He was estimated to be between 20 and 35 years old, was approximately 5 feet 6 inches tall, and weighed between 130 and 140 pounds. He had long, reddish brown hair and his left earlobe was pierced. He had three tattoos: one of a small devil with a painted tail on his lower left arm, one on his upper left arm with the word \\"Liz\\", and one of a flower design and \\"Baby Dawn\\" on his right arm. The tattoos were described to be of poor quality. He was found wearing a pair of blue Levi brand jeans, a brown short sleeve sports style shirt with a tag having the name \\"Wilson\\" written on it, and an earring of unknown description. After the man was killed, it appeared that he was tied to two cinder blocks with an electrical cord and then deposited in the lake. He may have gone by the street name, \\"New York Billy\\". He was exhumed in 2015 in order to analyze his DNA and make a forensic reconstruction.  Milam County Jane Doe  On November 4, 1986, the skeletal remains of a teenage white/Hispanic female were discovered by a telephone company repairman, in a grassy area alongside US Route 77, seven miles south of Rockdale, Texas. She had been beaten to death; to the point where her face was unrecognizable. She had been dead from anywhere between a few days to over a week. She was estimated to be between 12 and 16 years old, was approximately 5 feet 2 inches tall, and weighed between 90 and 100 pounds. She was only found with a yellow metal ring on her left hand. Her remains were exhumed in 2006 for analysis, however the maxilla and jaw bone were not found in the grave. Photographs were taken of the bones prior to her burial, though. Investigators say that without these two bones, a traditional 3D reconstruction cannot be made. A sketch could still be made of the victim based on the incomplete skull, and DNA Phenotyping may be able to provide a digital likeness of the girl.  Tarrant County John Doe (1987)  On October 10, 1987, the decomposed body of a young white male was found in a field in an unincorporated area of Tarrant County, Texas, close to Benbrook Lake. Cause of death could not be determined, however investigators are treating the case as a homicide. He was estimated to be between 25 and 40 years old, was approximately 6 feet 1 inch tall, and weighed between 140 and 150 pounds. He was found wearing a Land's End brand short sleeve, pullover, knit shirt with a white stripe, a Brigade brand plaid, flannel, long sleeve shirt, a pair of blue bikini briefs, Lee brand jeans with a laundry mark reading, \\"L.P. Brennan 50118\\", a pair of dark socks, a worn, silver ring with flat blue and red stones and a Kronotron brand gold watch, without the band. A pair of athletic shoes and an unfired .32 caliber cartridge were also found with the body. Investigators believe that the man may have come from Indiana, Massachusetts, Mississippi, or Tennessee, and may have used the names Thomas Jeffery, Jeffery Taylor, or Joseph Taylor, in order to gain food and medical care. FBI Reconstruction of \\"White Socks\\"  \\"White Socks\\"  On November 15, 1987, the skeletal remains of a young white/Hispanic male were found in some tall grass near the north shore of the Twin Buttes Reservoir in Tom Green County, Texas. Investigators could not find a cause of death, however, have deemed it a homicide due to the fact that he was found wearing clean socks in a grove of mesquite bushes. The man had been deceased for anywhere between five and six months. The man was estimated to be between 17 and 30 years old, was between 5 feet 6 inches and 5 feet 11 inches tall, and weighed between 145 and 175 pounds. He had dark brown hair and a possible case of mild spina bifida. He was found wearing a pair of Levi brand jeans, a pair of jockey shorts, and a pair of clean white socks. This has led to his nickname, \\"White Socks\\". In May, 2019, the DNA Doe Project was asked to assist with the victim's identification. \\"Rebel Ray\\" The skeletal remains of a male between the ages of 27 and 38 were found on October 3, 1988, in Georgetown, Williamson County, Texas, near a caravan park. He died between a month and a year before, as a result of homicidal violence. He was white with possible Native American or Hispanic ancestry. His hair was dark brown with some gray visible. He had a healed injury to his nose and he was likely of muscular build, with a height between 5'2\\" and 5'5\\". Although there was no clothing on the body, a pair of underwear and a hat were nearby. He was given the nickname \\"Rebel Ray\\" after the wording on the hat. Investigators suspect he may have resided in the nearby caravan park or was possibly employed as a handyman. The DNA Doe Project was asked to assist with identifying the body in May, 2019.

He was between 35 and 50 years old, was approximately 5 feet 8 inches tall and weighed between 195 and 200 pounds. He had receding dark brown hair with gray roots and brown eyes. He was found wearing a beige pullover, short sleeved shirt, a pair of jeans, a reddish-brown leather belt with a silver buckle, brown socks, black tasseled loafers with metal brads across the top, white underwear and a rope-styled chain necklace with a gold medallion with the imprint of an eagle. A pair of work eyeglasses with smoky-gray frames were also found near the body.  Tarrant County John Doe (1992)  On October 25, 1992, police officers found the body of a Hispanic male outside of a club in Fort Worth, Texas. He had been stabbed to death. He was estimated to be in his 30s, was 5 feet 6 inches tall, and weighed 150 pounds. He had black hair and blue eyes. He was found wearing a pair of brown cowboy boots, gray socks, and gray jeans. A man was arrested for the Doe's murder in September, 2007. It appeared the man had been dragged outside of the club, possibly by a worker who had been cleaning up for the night. Romeo Sanchez, was accused of stabbing the victim to death while fighting with the victim inside of the bar. Sanchez had been a long time person of interest in the case, but officers initially did not have enough evidence to charge him.  Dallas County John Doe (2002)  On December 12, 2002, a survey crew discovered seven garbage bags full of various body parts in a construction site in Irving, Texas. Four days later, the man's head was discovered at the same location. Cause of death was believed to be due to the dismemberment. The man was estimated to be between 20 and 39 years old, was approximately 5 feet 5 inches tall, and weighed between 120 and 140 pounds. He had black straight hair, and light brown skin. The bags which contained the man's body parts came from two stores, \\"Carnival Food Store\\" and \\"Fiesta Food Store\\". Investigators believe that the bags were brought to the location by dogs.  Chambers County John Doe  On April 28, 2007, the body of a middle aged Hispanic man was by a group of community service workers, found floating in Double Bayou in Anahuac, Texas. The man's wrists and legs had been bound, and he appeared to be taped around the mouth and head. He was estimated to be between 35 and 45 years old, was approximately 5 feet 6 inches tall and weighed between 150 and 165 pounds. He had short, black hair, a mustache, and brown eyes. He was described as having a medium build. He was found wearing a blue polo shirt with an Exxon logo on the sleeve, blue jeans, a brown/black belt with a silver buckle, and blue sneakers. Kendall County Jane Doe A female between 17 and 26 was discovered in Kendall County, Texas, on March 6, 2010. The victim's race was either Hispanic or Caucasian, possibly being a mix of both. Examination revealed that she had had a large amount of dental work as well as a previous open heart surgery. Deformities were also present on the feet. She had died between one year and a decade prior to the discovery. South Padre Island Jane Doe Reconstruction of the South Padre Island Jane Doe The decomposed remains of a Hispanic woman were found on a beach, scavenged by coyotes, on October 10, 2012, in South Padre Island, Cameron County, Texas. The victim's body was likely exposed due to changes with water levels on the beach. The woman had been dead from one to several weeks before her remains were discovered. The sand above the body had been \\"covered with lime,\\" possibly to speed decomposition or plant growth, likely as a way to prevent the body from being found or identified. Her height was estimated to be four feet ten to five feet two inches tall and her weight at about 95 to 120 pounds. She was middle-aged, approximately forty-two to fifty-five, at the time of death. One or more of the female's limbs were not found with the body, as they were likely carried away by animals. A distinctive feature about this female was that she had her make-up permanently tattooed on her eyebrows, eyelids and lips. Her ears had also been pierced. She was clothed, wearing a dark top, multicolored shorts with star decorations and bikini underwear, along with a sanitary pad. The woman's death is considered to be due to foul play and a \\"suspicious\\" white-colored \\"powder\\" was found on the face region. Since her discovery, a three-dimensional reconstruction and a sketch have been created of the victim.

Criticism  Shekhovtsova and her husband, Valentin Piseev, have been publicly criticized by Russian coaches and skaters. Shekhovtsova has been called \\"the First Lady\\" and \\"grey eminence\\" due to her influence on Piseev, and therefore on the Figure Skating Federation of Russia. A figure skating coach Elena Tchaikovskaia stated that Piseev only listened \\"to one adviser\\", which was his wife. She later criticised Shekhovtsova for becoming an ISU Ice Dance Technical Committee member despite \\"knowing nothing about ice dancing\\". When asked about the relationship with her husband in the interview, Shekhovtsova stated that \\"the talks about my influence are greatly exaggerated\\" and Piseev \\"is the one who always makes all the decisions\\". At the 2014 Winter Olympics, her appointment as a judge caused a controversy. She judged the ladies' single skating competition and was photographed hugging Russian skater Adelina Sotnikova in the arena after competition. Sotnikova won the gold medal. The Korean Olympic Committee (KOC) filed an official complaint against Shekhovtsova, citing the hug and her marriage to Valentin Piseev as reasons for a conflict of interest. The complaint was, however, dismissed by ISU.

His multiple positions through college made it difficult for scouts and analysts to determine what position he would play professionally. Standing at 6'2\\", he tied Tennessee State's A. C. Leonard as the shortest tight ends at the combine and was the lightest by 11 lbs. Burton finished with the fastest 40-yard dash time, tied for second in the three-cone drill, and fourth in the short shuttle among his position group at the combine. On March 17, 2014, Burton opted to participate at Florida's pro day, along with Dominique Easley, Solomon Patton, Loucheiz Purifoy, Marcus Roberson, Jon Halapio, Jonotthan Harrison, Ronald Powell, Jaylen Watkins, and two other teammates.

Burton lowered his time in the short shuttle and three-cone drill, while also increasing his broad and vertical jumps from the combine. At the conclusion of the pre-draft process, Burton was projected to be a seventh round pick or be a priority undrafted free agent by NFL draft experts and analysts.

On May 10, 2014, the Philadelphia Eagles signed him as an undrafted free agent to a three-year, $1.53 million contract that includes $20,000 guaranteed and a signing bonus of $7,500. Throughout training camp, Burton competed for a roster spot against James Casey, Emil Igwenagu, and Blake Annen. He caught nine passes for 100-yards and a touchdown in four preseason games. Head coach Chip Kelly named Burton the fourth tight end on the Eagles' depth chart, behind Zach Ertz, Brent Celek, and James Casey.

This was Burton's first career touchdown and his only score of the season. Burton completed his rookie season with a total of four combined tackles on special teams and five carries for 10-yards and a touchdown in 15 games and zero starts. He primarily played on special teams and showed a lot of production throughout the season. Burton was named to the NFL-All Rookie team as a special teams player. 2015 Burton entered training camp competing for a roster spot against Eric Tomlinson, Andrew Gleichert, and Justin Tukes. He was expected to receive an expanded role on special teams and offense after James Casey was released. On August 29, 2015, Burton caught four passes for 21-yards and two touchdown receptions during a 39‚Äì26 preseason victory at the Green Bay Packers. He became the first Eagles' player to have two touchdown receptions in a single preseason game since former Eagles' tight end Clay Harbor in .

He was named the third tight end behind Ertz and Celek to begin the season. On November 26, 2015, Burton recorded his first career reception and finished with two catches for 49-yards, though the Eagles lost 45‚Äì14 at the Detroit Lions. He was a key special teams contributor and led them with 19 combined tackles and also caught three receptions for 54 receiving yards in 16 games and zero starts. 2016 Under new head coach Doug Pederson, Burton was poised to have a larger role on the offense for the season. Throughout training camp, Burton was used in three tight end sets and at H-back. He competed for a roster spot against Chris Pantale, Dillon Gordon, and M. J. McFarland. The Eagles tested multiple players at fullback, but opted to instead use Burton as an H-Back in those situations. He was named the third tight end to start the regular season, behind Ertz and Celek. He was inactive for the Philadelphia Eagles' season-opening 29‚Äì10 victory over the Cleveland Browns after suffering a calf injury.

Only one example of this two seat, single engine biplane floatplane was built. Development The LeO H-10 (H for hydravion or waterplane) was a two-seat floatplane designed for reconnaissance work from Naval vessels. It was an unstaggered biplane with unswept wings of constant chord that could be folded for ease of onboard stowage. The interplane strut arrangement was unusual: outboard, there were conventional upright pairs but just inboard of these another pair ran diagonally in Warren girder style, replacing the conventional flying wires. The lower wing folded at a rear hinge on a short stub wing; outboard of the break was a single vertical strut. Central cabane struts provided an upper hinge so the wings, with their trailing edges folded downwards, leaned inwards over the fuselage when stowed. The fuselage of the LeO H.10 was a simple, flat sided structure with a water cooled Lorraine 12D V-12 engine in the nose. Twin wooden floats provided its landing gear. Only one was built, flying for the first time in April 1923.

Beginning in 869, Zanj armies repeatedly entered the province of al-Ahwaz (modern Khuzestan Province, Iran) and succeeded in scoring several victories against the defending forces of the Abbasid Caliphate. Over the course of the next decade, the rebels attacked and looted many of the cities in the region, including Suq al-Ahwaz (the provincial capital), 'Askar Mukram and Ramhurmuz. By the height of the rebellion in the mid-870s the Zanj were effectively in control of extensive portions of the province, appointing governors to the districts under their sway and collecting supplies from the local population. During this period, the Zanj in al-Ahwaz were usually commanded by 'Ali ibn Aban al- Muhallabi, a primary lieutenant of the overall Zanj leader 'Ali ibn Muhammad. In an effort to contain the Zanj, the Abbasid government in Samarra dispatched several commanders to the province to fight against the rebels. The caliphal armies were at times able to defeat the Zanj in battle, but they were unsuccessful in dislodging them from the province and frequently suffered severe losses themselves. The Abbasid war effort was further complicated after the Saffarid amir Ya'qub ibn al-Layth arrived in al-Ahwaz in 875 and attempted to assert his own authority over the region, at the expense of both the Zanj and the Abbasids. The Zanj presence in al-Ahwaz came to a sudden end in 881, when 'Ali ibn Aban was ordered to abandon the region and return to lower Iraq, where the remaining military events of the rebellion would take place.  Initial operations  The Zanj Rebellion began in early September 869, in the region of southern Iraq. The leader of the revolt was one 'Ali ibn Muhammad, who had previously led two failed movements against the Abbasid government in 863 and 868. 'Ali was able to quickly gather a major following, especially among the black slaves who had been employed to cultivate the lands in the area of the modern Shatt al-Arab. The rebels soon spread out through the districts around the city of Basra, and began taking control of the villages in the region. Due to their proximity to Basra, some of the border districts of al-Ahwaz were entered by the Zanj in the initial months of the revolt. The rebels' movements in the province at this stage, however, were restricted to the lands around the southern Dujayl River (the modern Karun). The Zanj secured peace agreements with some of the villages in the area; other settlements, however, resisted the rebels and were attacked as a result.  First occupation of Suq al-Ahwaz  For almost a year following the outbreak of the revolt, the rebels had mostly remained confined to the districts in the vicinity of Basra. In mid-870, however, the Zanj succeeded in overrunning al- Ubulla and receiving the submission of 'Abbadan, and the rebels sought to follow up these victories with further attacks. The Zanj leader 'Ali ibn Muhammad decided to expand to the northeast and make al-Ahwaz the target of his next campaign, and an army was ordered to proceed to the province. The Zanj troops that set out for al-Ahwaz were enthusiastic about their mission, and they were reinforced with slaves and weapons that had been confiscated from 'Abbadan. Their first target was Jubba, to the east of the Dujayl. The residents of the town offered no resistance and fled, allowing the Zanj to enter Jubba and pillage it. From there, they spread through the environs of Jubba, which were laid waste. The rebels then continued marching north, and at last arrived before the city of al-Ahwaz, otherwise known as Suq al-Ahwaz. News of the Zanj approach was met with great trepidation in the city. The military governor of al-Ahwaz at the time was Sa'id ibn Yaksin, who had a contingent of troops at his disposal. Sa'id, however, decided to withdraw from the city, taking his soldiers with him, and the residents of al-Ahwaz also fled. Consequently, when the Zanj army reached Suq al-Ahwaz they were able to enter and occupy the city, with almost no one offering resistance. The fiscal governor Ibrahim ibn Muhammad ibn al-Mudabbir, who had remained in Suq al- Ahwaz with his pages and servants, was captured by the rebels, and his money, furnishings and slaves were seized. The Zanj occupation of Suq al-Ahwaz lasted only temporarily, and by the following year the Abbasids reestablished their military presence in the region. The occupation, however, succeeded in opening a new front in the war against the government. The Zanj would occupy Suq al- Ahwaz twice more, in 873 and again in 875, and after the latter occasion they would retain a hold over the city for several years. The capture of al-Ahwaz, together with that of al-Ubulla less than two months prior, also helped spread to fear among the residents of the surrounding regions; many people of Basra, for example, fled their city for safer areas after learning of the Zanj's victory.  Arrival of Ibrahim ibn Sima  In 871, the Zanj leader sent 'Ali ibn Aban to al-Ahwaz, ordering him to occupy the province and destroy a bridge spanning the Dujayl. Upon reaching the bridge, however, his troops were met by Ibrahim ibn Sima al-Turki, a government commander who had been returning to Iraq from Fars. Ibrahim attacked the rebels from several sides, killing a large number of them and forcing 'Ali to flee. Pursued by Ibrahim's cavalry, 'Ali attempted to reach Suq al-Ahwaz, but a foot wound hindered his movements and he eventually decided to retreat back to Jubba instead. As a result of his victory, Ibrahim was appointed to conduct the war against the Zanj in al- Ahwaz, and Sa'id ibn Yaksin was dismissed from his post. Ibrahim decided to pursue 'Ali and divided his forces into two, sending one contingent under his secretary Shahin and retaining the other for himself. Informed of their movements, 'Ali met Shahin's force and defeated it, killing Shahin and a large number of his men. He then immediately advanced against Ibrahim, reaching the latter's camp that same evening before the news of Shahin's defeat had reached him. Despite having far fewer troops, 'Ali fell upon Ibrahim's men and successfully routed them, forcing Ibrahim to withdraw in turn. After the battles against Shahin and Ibrahim, 'Ali remained encamped in Jubba until he was recalled by the Zanj leader in order to take part in the Zanj attack on Basra.  Killing of Mansur ibn Ja'far  After the successful capture of Basra in September 871, 'Ali ibn Aban was again dispatched to Jubba to fight against Mansur ibn Ja'far al-Khayyat, the military administrator of Basra and the Tigris districts. To reinforce 'Ali, the Zanj leader sent twelve barges laden with troops under the command of Abu al-Layth al-Isbahani, with orders to follow 'Ali's commands. Abu al-Layth, however, decided to attack Mansur on his own and went out to meet him without consulting 'Ali. In the resulting battle, Mansur defeated Abu al-Layth, killing many of his men and capturing his barges. After learning of Abu al-Layth's defeat, 'Ali also withdrew back to his camp, where he remained for about a month. He then set out to fight Mansur again, and sent scouts to gather information about him. Upon learning of a contingent led by one of Mansur's officers, 'Ali launched a night attack against it, killing the commander and most of his men and looting their camp. News of this raid reached Mansur, who decided to set forth himself, and 'Ali came out to meet him as well. The resulting battle ended in complete victory for 'Ali; Mansur's troops suffered significant casualties and eventually fled, abandoning him on the battlefield. Mansur himself attempted to flee, but was pursued by a Zanj soldier and killed while attempting to cross a canal. Following Mansur's death, Asghajun was appointed by the government to replace him. 'Ali remained in Jubba for a time, until a dispatch from the Zanj leader reached him to hasten back to Iraq, where Abu Ahmad ibn al-Mutawakkil (the future caliphal regent al-Muwaffaq) had arrived with a large army to attack the chief Zanj \\"city\\" of al-Mukhtarah.  Second occupation of Suq al-Ahwaz, Ibn Muflih  In 873, following the withdrawal of Abu Ahmad from southern Iraq, the Zanj leader ordered 'Ali ibn Aban to return to al-Ahwaz with most of his troops. Upon learning of the rebels' advance, Asghajun advanced from Suq al-Ahwaz against 'Ali with his own forces, and the two sides met in a desert. The battle went badly for the government army; Asghajun and many of his men were killed and others were taken prisoner. The Zanj then made their way to Suq al-Ahwaz and entered it on May 8, upon which they began pillaging and killed a number of its inhabitants. News of the fate of Suq al-Ahwaz reached the central government in Samarra, which responded by placing the general Musa ibn Bugha al-Kabir in charge of war against the Zanj. Musa sent 'Abd al-Rahman ibn Muflih to al-Ahwaz to engage 'Ali. In his first encounter against the rebels, Ibn Muflih was defeated, but after regrouping his forces, he launched a second attack and inflicted a severe defeat upon the Zanj. Many of 'Ali's men were killed or captured, while 'Ali himself escaped with a few of his followers and fled to southern Iraq. After spending some time recovering in al-Mukhtarah, 'Ali was again sent out against Ibn Muflih, who had made camp at Hisn al-Mahdi on the Dujayl. He was engaged, however, by Ibrahim ibn Sima, who was then encamped at al-Badhaward, and was defeated twice by him. For his part, Ibn Muflih received word of 'Ali's movements and dispatched his lieutenant Tashtimur against him. Tashimur found that 'Ali had retreated into an area of dense thickets and reeds, so to force him out he ordered his troops to set fire to the vegetation. 'Ali was able to escape, but several of his men were captured by Tashtimur, who sent word of his victory to Ibn Muflih. Following his defeat, 'Ali made his way to the Nahr al-Sidrah, in the area of the Dujayl south of Suq al-Ahwaz, where he wrote to the Zanj leader asking for reinforcements. Thirteen barges with several contingents of Zanj soldiers were sent to him, upon which 'Ali decided to advance again against Ibn Muflih. The two armies met, but refrained from fighting for a day. That night, 'Ali took several of his most trusted troops and made his way to the rear of Ibn Muflih's camp, where he launched a surprise attack. The government army was defeated and Ibn Muflih retreated, abandoning four of his barges in the process. Ibn Muflih proceeded to al-Dawlab near Suq al-Ahwaz, where he reestablished his camp. Once he had recovered from his defeat, he sent Tashtimur to engage 'Ali, who was defeated and forced to retreat to the Nahr al-Sidrah. Ibn Muflih then set out with the rest of his forces, and succeeded in inflicting a major defeat on 'Ali, who lost ten of his barges during the battle. 'Ali was forced to retreat back to Iraq, and Ibn Muflih himself proceeded to Bayan.  Abu al-Saj and the third occupation of Suq al-Ahwaz  Ibn Muflih and Tashtimur were both killed in early 875 by Muhammad ibn Wasil, the rebel governor of Fars; at the same time, Musa ibn Bugha decided to resign his command of the operations against the Zanj and returned to Samarra. In response, the central government appointed Abu al-Saj as military governor of al-Ahwaz and tasked him with defeating the rebels there. Shortly after Abu al- Saj's arrival, 'Ali ibn Aban advanced into al-Ahwaz and proceeded to the Nahr al-Sidrah. There he fought against a government army and defeated it, killing its commander, a relative of Abu al-Saj's. The latter decided to withdraw to 'Askar Mukram, allowing the Zanj to advance to Suq al-Ahwaz. Upon entering the city, they proceeded to begin killing and capturing its residents, and pillaged and burned their homes. Following the sack of Suq al-Ahwaz, Abu al- Saj was dismissed from his post and was temporarily replaced with Ibrahim ibn Sima. Later that year, Masrur al-Balkhi was given overall command of the war against the rebels.  Ya'qub ibn al-Layth, Muhammad ibn 'Ubaydallah and Ahmad ibn Laythawayh  A new development in the war emerged in late 875 when the Saffarid amir Ya'qub ibn al-Layth arrived in Ramhurmuz. Ya'qub had spent the last several years becoming one of the most powerful rulers in the Islamic east, having conquered the provinces of Sijistan, Kirman, Khurasan and Fars. He furthermore sought to expand into the core regions of the Abbasid Caliphate, a policy that would culminate in early 876 with the Battle of Dayr al-'Aqul in central Iraq. Although the battle ended in defeat for Ya'qub and forced him out of Iraq, he still sought to maintain his authority in al-Ahwaz, at the expense of both the Abbasid government and the Zanj. Ya'qub appointed Muhammad ibn 'Ubaydallah al-Kurdi as governor of the districts of al-Ahwaz. Muhammad, however, soon entered into correspondence with the Zanj leader and offered to defect to the rebels' side. The Zanj leader agreed to the offer, on the condition that Muhammad submit to 'Ali ibn Aban as the latter's deputy. The approximate movements of Ahmad ibn Laythawayh against 'Ali ibn Aban and Muhammad ibn 'Ubaydallah. With Muhammad now on his side, 'Ali decided to send an expedition under his brother al-Khalil to al-Sus, where Ahmad ibn Laythawayh, who had been appointed by Masrur al-Balkhi as the military governor of al-Ahwaz, was staying. Al-Khalil and Muhammad joined forces and headed toward the city, but Ibn Laythawayh intercepted them before they arrived and launched an attack. Many of the rebels were killed or captured, and the rest soon withdrew. Ibn Laythawayh then proceeded to Junday Sabur and established himself there. Upon learning of the defeat, 'Ali ibn Aban decided to assist Muhammad and departed from Suq al-Ahwaz with his troops. 'Ali and Muhammad's forces separately traveled along the Nahr Masruqan and eventually met up at 'Askar Mukram, where 'Ali and Muhammad discussed their plans. The two armies then split up again, with Muhammad heading toward Tustar to establish himself in that city, while 'Ali proceeded to a bridge on the road to Fars. While 'Ali was stationed at the bridge, he received word that, although Muhammad had entered Tustar, he was making the prayers there on behalf of the caliph and Ya'qub ibn al-Layth, instead of the Zanj leader. Considering this to be evidence of Muhammad's betrayal, 'Ali ordered his forces to return immediately to Suq al-Ahwaz and destroyed the bridge to prevent anyone from following him. After a night's march, the rebels entered 'Askar Mukram, which they attacked and plundered despite a prior agreement with the city. 'Ali arrived after his troops and found what they had done, but was too late to stop them, and ordered them to continue back to Suq al-Ahwaz. News of 'Ali's retreat reached Ahmad ibn Laythawayh, who had in the meantime returned to al-Sus. He decided to advance on Tustar and engaged Muhammad in combat. Muhammad was defeated and forced to escape, and Ibn Laythawayh established himself in Tustar. 'Ali now set out for Tustar with the intention of fighting Ibn Laythawayh. Along the way, he learned that Ibn Laythawayh was also heading in his direction, and the two armies met near the Nahr Masruqan. Ibn Laythawayh's cavalry gave him a massive advantage, and the battle turned into a complete rout, with only a few of the Zanj infantry standing firm. 'Ali, who had been wounded in the leg by an arrow, barely managed to escape by jumping into the Nahr Masruqan. He managed to reach Suq al-Ahwaz, but he decided not to remain there and instead returned to al-Mukhtarah to treat his wounds. After fully recovering from his injuries, 'Ali set out to return to al-Ahwaz. Having learned that Ibn Laythawayh was at 'Askar Mukram, he sent a large army under the command of al-Khalil and his nephew Abu Sahl Muhammad ibn Salih against him. The two leaders met Ibn Laythawayh's forces a farsakh outside the city and engaged him in battle. Ibn Laythawayh, however, executed a feigned retreat, and when the Zanj pursued him they were ambushed by a second regiment. With the rebels being routed, Ibn Laythawayh rejoined the battle, and the Zanj were compelled to make a full retreat. Once the battle was over, Ibn Laythawayh collected the heads of the slain rebels and headed for Tustar.  Zanj-Saffarid conflict  Shortly after the battle at 'Askar Mukram, Ibn Laythawayh learned that Ya'qub ibn al-Layth was advancing toward al-Ahwaz; feeling that his position was now untenable, he decided to quit the region and fled from Tustar. Ya'qub proceeded to Junday Sabur, forcing the agents of the central government to evacuate the district. After establishing himself in the city, he sent al-Hisn ibn al-'Anbar to Suq al-Ahwaz to serve as his governor there. Upon learning of al-Hisn's advance, 'Ali ibn Aban decided to abandon the city and set up camp along the Nahr al-Sidrah, allowing al-Hisn to occupy Suq al-Ahwaz without incident. 'Ali and al-Hisn began to launch raids against each other, inflicting casualties on both sides. This continued until 'Ali decided to attack al-Hisn at Suq al-Ahwaz. In a fierce battle, the rebels inflicted a serious defeat on al-Hisn; many of the Saffarid troops were killed and the mounts of the cavalry were captured. Al-Hisn fled to 'Askar Mukram, while the victorious Zanj set about plundering Suq al-Ahwaz. 'Ali then returned to the Nahr al-Sidrah, where he dispatched an expedition against a Kurdish leader loyal to Ya'qub who was stationed at Dawraq. This engagement also went well for the Zanj, who captured the Kurd and killed a number of his men. Following the defeats at the hands of the Zanj, Ya'qub ordered al-Hisn to refrain from engaging them in further combat and to restrict himself to Suq al-Ahwaz. He also wrote to 'Ali and sought a truce, on the condition that he be allowed to keep troops in the city. 'Ali responded by rejecting his proposal, unless he would be allowed to transfer food supplies from the city first. Ya'qub agreed to this and allowed 'Ali to remove his supplies, and the two sides ended hostilities with each other.  Takin al-Bukhari  Ya'qub died in Junday Sabur in 879, and in that same year Masrur al-Balkhi appointed Takin al-Bukhari as military governor of al-Ahwaz. Upon arriving in the province, Takin learned that 'Ali ibn Aban was proceeding toward Tustar with a large army, so he set off for that city as well. When he reached Tustar, he found that 'Ali had surrounded the city and that it was on the verge of surrender. Without spending any time to prepare, Takin ordered an attack and successfully routed the Zanj, forcing them to withdraw from Tustar. Shortly after the battle, Takin was informed that 'Ali had sent a contingent to the Fars bridge, and that it was in a poor state of discipline. He therefore advanced against their position and staged a night assault, which killed several rebel commanders and forced the rest to flee. Takin then continued along the Nahr Masruqan and eventually reached 'Ali's camp, but the latter decided not to fight and withdrew instead. At this point, 'Ali and Takin began corresponding with each other, and messages and courtesies were sent between the two. News of this reached Masrur al-Balkhi, which caused him to suspect Takin's loyalty. He therefore departed for al-Ahwaz and wrote to Takin, expressing approval of his conduct. Unsuspectingly, Takin agreed to meet with Masrur, but when he arrived at his camp he was disarmed and imprisoned. Upon learning that Takin was in custody, his troops began to disperse; several of them entered into the service of 'Ali ibn Aban, while others joined Muhammad ibn 'Ubaydallah. In order to prevent further defections, Masrur issued a guarantee of safe conduct for the troops that remained, whereupon they agreed to join his forces.  Aghartmish  With Takin now imprisoned, Aghartmish was appointed as military governor of al-Ahwaz in his place. With orders to fight against 'Ali ibn Aban, Aghartmish and other commanders marched until they reached Tustar, where they killed a number of Zanj prisoners that Takin had taken captive. They then continued south and eventually reached 'Askar Mukram. 'Ali, meanwhile, decided to set out against Aghartmish and marched north, with his brother al-Khalil commanding his vanguard. Due to the rebels' superior numbers, however, the government army refrained from fighting and cut a bridge to hinder 'Ali's advance. 'Ali then returned to Suq al-Ahwaz, leaving al- Khalil at Masruqan. At Suq al-Ahwaz, he received a message from al-Khalil that Aghartmish was again advancing toward him, so he departed to meet the government forces and ordered al-Khalil to join him. A battle took place between the two sides and ended with Aghartmish the victor. 'Ali withdrew to Suq al-Ahwaz, but he found that his reserve forces there had fled to the Nahr al-Sidrah, so he followed them and joined up with them there. 'Ali regrouped his troops and prepared to stage another attack against Aghartmish. The latter responded by drawing up his own forces and marched against the Zanj. 'Ali again put al-Khalil in his vanguard and instructed another commander, Bahbudh ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab, to position himself in ambush. Al-Khalil then marched against Aghartmish and began an engagement with him. The government army gained an initial advantage during the battle, but when they were attacked by the ambushers and suffered defeat. One of the government commanders was taken prisoner, and 'Ali ordered him to be decapitated in retaliation for the deaths of the prisoners at Tustar. 'Ali then proceeded to Suq al-Ahwaz and sent the heads of the slain to al-Mukhtarah, where they were put on display, while Aghartmish and the remnants of his forces retreated back to Tustar. Fighting continued for a time between 'Ali and Aghartmish, with neither side clearly gaining the upper hand. When reinforcements arrived from al-Mukhtarah to bolster 'Ali's position, however, Aghartmish decided to seek a truce with 'Ali, which the latter accepted. 'Ali then proceeded to raid the nearby districts, and eventually arrived at Bayrudh, which he subdued and plundered. He sent the spoils to al-Mukhtarah and established himself in the village.  Conflict between 'Ali ibn Aban and Muhammad ibn 'Ubaydallah  Relations between 'Ali and Muhammad ibn 'Ubaydallah, the former governor for Ya'qub ibn al-Layth, had remained poor since the incident at Tustar. In an attempt to free himself from 'Ali, Muhammad wrote to Ankalay, the son of the Zanj leader, and asked that the district under his control be removed from 'Ali's jurisdiction and assigned directly to him. This deal angered 'Ali, and in retaliation he requested that Muhammad's tax revenues be transferred to him. When he received the Zanj leader's approval, he demanded the money from Muhammad, but the latter delayed payment. 'Ali used the delay as a pretext to attack Muhammad, and set out for Ramhurmuz where he way staying. Lacking the means to face 'Ali, Muhammad decided to flee, and Ramhurmuz was ransacked by 'Ali's troops. A panicked Muhammad decided to request a reconciliation with 'Ali, which the Zanj leader assented to. Muhammad then turned over his tax revenues to 'Ali, who in turn forwarded the money to al-Mukhtarah and agreed to keep his distance from the areas under Muhammad's control. Some time after this, Muhammad wrote to 'Ali, asking that he assist him in attacking a group of Kurds and offering that any loot received would go to the Zanj troops. 'Ali agreed and sent al-Khalil and Bahbudh to participate in the raid. The battle initially proceeded in favor of the Zanj, but when the Kurds counterattacked Muhammad's men suddenly deserted the field, forcing the Zanj to retreat. While they were in flight, they were attacked by another contingent of Muhammad's men, and lost many of their mounts and spoils in the fighting. When the surviving Zanj returned to 'Ali and reported what had happened, he immediately wrote to the Zanj leader about the incident. Terse negotiations then ensued between al-Mukhtarah, 'Ali and Muhammad, which ended with Muhammad agreeing to return the stolen mounts and send additional compensation. Once the situation with Muhammad had been resolved, 'Ali took no action for a while. Eventually he decided to attack the stronghold of Mattuth and marched against it. When he arrived, however, he saw that it had strong fortifications and numerous defenders, so he decided to make further preparations before assaulting it. He withdrew and began assembling ladders and tools for scaling walls; once this was completed, he ordered his army to again approach the city. As he drew near Mattuth this time, however, he was suddenly attacked by Masrur al-Balkhi, who had learned of 'Ali's plans. The sight of Masrur's cavalry caused 'Ali's men to abandon their equipment and flee, and 'Ali was forced to retreat. Zanj abandonment of al-Ahwaz  The Abbasid government had launched a major offensive in late 879 against the Zanj in central Iraq; led by the prince Abu al-'Abbas (the future caliph al-Mu'tadid [r. 892‚Äì902]), the government army had succeeded in inflicting several major defeats against the Zanj in the regions of Wasit and the Batihah. In September 880 another army commanded by Abu al-'Abbas' father, the caliphal regent al-Muwaffaq, joined the fighting. The Zanj presence in central Iraq was soon all but eliminated; several towns were recovered by the government and the two rebel strongholds of al-Mani'ah and al-Mansurah were captured. The rebel forces in the region were gradually forced to withdraw and retreat closer to their capital of al-Mukhtarah. The approximate movements of al-Muwaffaq during his advance through al-Ahwaz. On January 7, 881, al-Muwaffaq set out from Wasit and advanced upon al-Ahwaz, taking the road to al-Sus. With the rebels' position in Iraq becoming increasingly precarious, and with al-Muwaffaq bearing down on 'Ali ibn Aban's position, the Zanj leader decided to recall 'Ali and have him return to al- Mukhtarah. He therefore wrote to 'Ali, ordering him to abandon his provisions and equipment and return to Iraq. 'Ali, meanwhile, had already learned of al- Muwaffaq's advance; upon receiving the Zanj leader's letter, he appointed a lieutenant in his place and departed from Suq al-Ahwaz. A similar order reached Bahbudh, who governed the villages between al-Ahwaz and Fars; he promptly withdrew and abandoned his supplies as well. The rebels made the journey back to al-Mukhtarah, plundering the villages they encountered along the way despite the fact that they had made peace with the Zanj. Many of 'Ali's men failed to join him and deserted, deciding to remain in the province while 'Ali returned to al-Mukhtarah. Al-Muwaffaq soon arrived at al-Sus, where he was soon joined by Masrur al-Balkhi, his governor of the province. While at al-Sus, he ordered that the supplies left behind by the Zanj be seized, and set about opening dams that the rebels had put up on the rivers and repairing the local roads. After three days he left al-Sus for Junday Sabur, where he ordered his men to search for fodder. After another three days he continued on to Tustar, and upon arriving there he sent officers throughout the district of al-Ahwaz to collect taxes, and arranged for the payment of Masrur's troops. He also sent a representative to Muhammad ibn 'Ubaydallah, who was still in the province, to negotiate a settlement with him. Al-Muwaffaq eventually departed from Tustar and proceeded to 'Askar Mukram, and from there he made his way to Suq al-Ahwaz. While there, he discovered that the Zanj had mined a nearby bridge which prevented supplies from reaching the city, so he ordered his men to restore the crossing. Once that was done, he remained in the city for several days in order to strengthen his forces. During this time, the Zanj who had deserted 'Ali wrote to him requesting a pardon; al-Muwaffaq granted this, and about one thousand of 'Ali's men were integrated into his army. Having reestablished the Abbasid government's authority in al-Ahwaz, al-Muwaffaq departed from Suq al-Ahwaz and made his way south. He and Abu al-'Abbas soon reached al-Mukhtarah in mid-February 881 and began besieging it, thereby initiating the final phase of the rebellion.  Aftermath  During the siege of al-Mukhtarah, which lasted from 881 to 883, no fighting appears to have taken place in al-Ahwaz; the province, however, did contribute to the Abbasid war effort, sending both supplies and volunteers to al-Muwaffaq. When al- Mukhtarah was finally captured in 883, some surviving rebels attempted to flee to al-Ahwaz; one fugitive who had wounded al-Muwaffaq during the siege, for example, was apprehended by the authorities in Ramhurmuz and sent to Abu al-'Abbas, who had him put to death. After the final defeat of the Zanj, al- Muwaffaq ordered that letters be sent out to the centers of the Muslim world announcing to the people of the districts of Basra, al-Ubulla, al-Ahwaz and Wasit that the rebellion was over and that it was now safe for them to return to their homes.

Personal information Claude Verlon was born in Aubervilliers, Seine Saint Denis, France. He enrolled at the Ecole Nationale Sup√©rieure Louis-Lumi√®re and took night courses while he was working from 1984 until he graduated in 1986.  Career  Claude Verlon was sound engineer at Radio France Internationale from 1982 until his murder in 2013. In 1984, he made his first reports as a field reporter. He contributed to the creation of the first reporting service at RFI. At the time of his death, Verlon was a deputy director of technical services at RFI. Verlon was passionate about Africa and he had made other missions to this continent while at RFI. In 2005, Bamako, he created a radio studio outside the 23rd summit Africa-France to cover the event. He specialized in technical challenges and he made reports from many international locations, such as Kosovo, Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya and Mali. As a technician, he established a reputation for his ability to broadcast from the remotest parts of the world. In Bucharest, Romania, he also succeeded in organizing a studio for the Francophone countries summit in 2006 under technically difficult circumstances.  Death  Ghislaine Dupont and colleague Verlon were reporting around Kidal, Mali, when they both were murdered. They had just finished an interview with Ambery Ag Rissa, a spokesperson for the National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad, or Tuareg separatists, in the troublesome northeastern town, when four armed men from a political group took them. The two journalists' bodies were found riddled with bullets 12 km from Kidal. None of the suspects have been arrested. The primary suspect is Baye Ag Bakabo, a Tuareg closely related to National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad and Al-Qaeda, because his car was used for Verlon and Dupont's kidnapping, but his whereabouts are unknown. There are still unanswered questions surrounding the circumstances of their death. Al-Qaeda claimed responsibility for the murder.  Context  Verlon and Dupont were in Mali to cover the Malian presidential elections in 2013. It was the second assignment in Kidal for Verlon since he reported on the first round of Mali's presidential election in July 2013.  Reactions  On 5 November, they received a posthumous decoration from Ibrahim Boubacar Keita, president of Mali, in the presence of government officials, RFI representatives, and France's ambassador to Mali. The United Nations assigned the date of commemoration for the International Day to End Impunity based on the outrage behind the murder of Dupont and Verlon, who were killed on 2 November, as stated in its official resolution. The Ghislaine Dupont and Claude Verlon Scholarship In September 2014, Radio France Internationale announced the Ghislaine Dupont et Claude Verlon scholarships to honor its deceased journalists.

He was a native Texan, raised in a broken family, but a good student. He joined the CIA after serving in a combat unit in Europe during World War II, followed by a geology degree from Texas A&M.; In his senior year, he was recruited by the CIA. Assigned to the Kingdom of Thailand on 1 March 1951, Lair found himself training Border Patrol Police to Special Forces standards. Originally established with an aim of opposing the invasion of Thailand by the People's Liberation Army of China, the new unit policed the Thai border areas until hostilities broke out in the neighboring Kingdom of Laos. Acting in response to the Kong Le coup of 9 August 1960, Lair's unit secretively supplied the communications liaisons needed for the successful counter-coup of 14 December 1960. Once established within Laos, Lair promptly searched out Vang Pao. With Lair's aid, Vang Pao raised an army of 30,000 guerrilla warriors to fight in the Laotian Civil War. The Tonkin Gulf incident in August 1964, followed by the first American combat troops landing in Vietnam in May 1965, escalated the war. In mid-1966, the new CIA Chief of Station Ted Shackley promulgated increased operations against the Ho Chi Minh Trail and commitment of more troops to the fight for northern Laos. U.S. air power began to be used in Laos. The Royal Lao Air Force began its struggle to become an effective close air support force. A new covert unit, the Raven Forward Air Controllers, was formed to guide the air strikes. The use of airpower as mobile artillery to clear the path for guerrillas was successful in the short run; however, Lair believed it would lead to ultimate defeat for the Hmong, as they were used as light infantry in fixed positions. Increasingly estranged from Shackley, as well as from Ambassador William H. Sullivan, Bill Lair left Laos in August 1968. After attendance at the Army War College, Lair returned to a desk job in Bangkok. He would score one last military intelligence coup, when his Thai brother-in-law visited the dying Mao Zedong and brought back information about the political maneuvering of potential successors. Just before Lair's retirement from the CIA, he was honored with a private audience with Thai King Bhumibol. Upon his return to the United States, Lair became a long haul trucker. He remained active within the Hmong-American community. Early life and military service Bill Lair was born in Hilton, Oklahoma on 4 July 1924; he moved to Borger, Texas at the age of three. His mother divorced his father for idleness, and remarried. Her second husband died as a result of a freak oilfield explosion in 1937. However, Lair's grandfather, an old-time cowboy, was an important influence in young Bill's life. Lair lived in and around Borger and Panhandle, Texas until 1940, when he moved to Waco. He graduated from 11 years of schooling at Waco High School, at age 16. He took some post-high school courses while working for the Panhandle Herald and a grocery store.11 December 2001 oral interview of Bill Lair, Vietnam Archive at Texas Technical University; pp. 1-3, 7-10, 16-17; Steve Maxner, interviewer. http://www.vietnam.ttu.edu/star/images/oh/oh0200/OH0200-part1.pdf Retrieved 30 September 2014.20 August 2010 oral interview of Bill Lair, Library of Congress Veterans History Project; Eileen Hurst, interviewer. http://memory.loc.gov/diglib/vhp/story/loc.natlib.afc2001001.76724/transcript?ID=mv0001 Retrieved 28 September 2014. As a fifth-generation Texan, Lair never lost his childhood accent. He was raised as an only child, although eventually he would come to have two younger sisters, and he grew up poor, quiet, and shy. His imagination sparked by his reading, he dreamt of becoming a pilot. He was a seventeen-year-old freshman at Texas A&M; when the attack on Pearl Harbor occurred. Anxious to defend his nation, he applied for naval pilot's training, but was rejected because of substandard eyesight. He then convinced his mother to cosign his enlistment papers into the U.S. Army as a private. He saw his first combat in the invasion of Normandy. His armored unit fought its way across Europe for the next year. Lair's unit ended World War II on the Elbe River, facing a Russian unit on the far bank. It was there that Lair became convinced the American army should have continued the war, and defeated the communists.Warner, p. 31. Once discharged postwar, Lair earned a geology degree from Texas A & M in expectation of working in the petroleum industry. However, the Central Intelligence Agency recruited him just before graduation.Warner, pp. 31-32. CIA career =Assignment to Thailand= After training, Lair was forwarded to the Kingdom of Thailand for his first assignment, arriving on 1 March 1951.11 December 2001 oral interview of Bill Lair, Vietnam Archive at Texas Technical University; p. 62; Steve Maxner, interviewer. http://www.vietnam.ttu.edu/star/images/oh/oh0200/OH0200-part1.pdf Retrieved 30 September 2014. U.S. Ambassador to Thailand Edwin F. Stanton was in the throes of a postwar rapprochement between the two nations. Agreements between the two countries led to the beginning of the American buildup in Thailand. The aim was to help the Thais block any Communist Chinese incursions through the neighboring Kingdom of Laos. Lair's part in this was an assignment to train the Royal Thai Police. He used an old Imperial Japanese training camp in Hua Hin to train a select crew of Thai police in guerrilla warfare, including parachuting. In the process, Lair discovered he had a knack for getting along with the Thais. His bashfulness, his aversion to eye contact, and quiet courteous demeanor were so congruent with ideal Thai manners that his policemen bonded with him, even though he spoke broken Thai with a Texas twang. He trained with them, and underwent survival exercises with them. He even married a Thai socialite.Conboy, Morrison, p. 57. Assistance to the effort was supplied by Southeast Asia Supply Company, a CIA front usually referred to as \\"Sea Supply\\". When the training program was threatened with cancellation due to an apparently dwindling invasion threat, Lair convinced his boss it was worth continuing due to its low cost. With this support, Thai Police General Phao Sriyanond leaned toward a militarized police force; in this, he was building himself a counter-force to troops loyal to the other two strongmen in the government, Field Marshal Plaek Phibunsongkhram and General Sarit Thanarat. By 1953s end, 94 platoons of about 45 men each had been trained by Lair for Phao's command. Earlier, in April 1953, Bill Lair was appointed a captain in the Royal Thai Police. He then selected 100 out of 2,000 previous trainees for advanced instruction in unconventional warfare in Hua Hin, next to King Bhumibol's palace. This elite group would undergo a further eight months of intensive military training before turning about and schooling a further 300 recruits. One of the first visitors to the new training center was Allen Dulles then Associate Director of the CIA. He would later prevent the camp from being closed. At that time, the unit's focus was repelling a Chinese Communist invasion. Nationalist Chinese troops still threatened to cross the Burmese and Lao borders into mainland China, and in turn the Chinese Communists seemed likely to retaliate with a preemptive incursion. The new training camp offered ample opportunity for the trainees to learn to live off the jungle.11 December 2001 oral interview of Bill Lair, Vietnam Archive at Texas Technical University; pp. 66-70, 75-77, 83-85; Steve Maxner, interviewer. http://www.vietnam.ttu.edu/star/images/oh/oh0200/OH0200-part1.pdf Retrieved 30 September 2014. By 1955, the new unit was ready for duty as the Royal Guards. Later renamed to their more familiar cognomen, Police Aerial Resupply Unit, or PARU. They were under the hidden patronage of the king even though they had been split away from the Royal Guards.Conboy, Morrison, p. 58. They were deployed into mountainous northern Thailand to police the hill tribes there. They surreptitiously arrested bandits and opium smugglers while establishing ties to the tribesmen whom were despised by most Thais. During this time, many Hmong mentioned a promising young Hmong warrior in Laos named Vang Pao.Warner, p. 32. By 1957, PARU consisted of two light infantry companies, as well as a pathfinder company personally commanded by Lair. Although dubbed \\"police\\", the extensively cross-trained PARU agents were trained to special forces standards. In September 1957, the PARU narrowly escaped disbandment when General Phao was forced into exile by the head of the Royal Thai Army, General Sarit. In early 1958, they were renamed with the PARU designation. They began to shift their training base from Hua Hin to Phitsanulok, which was closer to their area of operations. In 1958, they became involved in the CIA's international operations. They rigged parachutes for dropping weapons to insurgents in Indonesia. They packed pallets of weaponry for shipment from Takhli to the anti-Chinese Communist resistance in Tibet.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 58-59. Early in 1960, PARU's Pathfinder Company took up three posts along the Thai-Lao border. Each of the three stations was across the Mekong River from an important Lao town. The stations were sited near Vientiane, Mukdahan, and Pakxan. On 9 August came the Kong Le coup in Vientiane. Lair and the PARU would intrude into Laos in the wake of this coup, under complex circumstances. One was that Phoumi Nosavan, who was then the Lao head of state, was a first cousin to General Sarit. The prospect of his rival Phao losing influence as casualties sapped the PARU seems to have been another reason for Sarit's acquiescence. And even as Sarit supported intervention by the PARU, Lair briefed his CIA superiors. Lair's main selling points for leading his paramilitaries into Laos was the sheer secretiveness possible because his troopers could blend seamlessly into the Lao population. It was a demographic oddity that the majority of lowland Lao actually lived south of the Lao-Thai border. Most of Lair's PARU recruits were thus of Lao origin, though Thai citizens. It was also apparent to the agency's apparatus, which had been blindsided by the coup, that it lacked reliable military intelligence sources within Laos.Conboy, Morrison, p. 59.Warner, p. 21.Warner, p. 33. =Move into Laos= Coup and counter-coup As Kong Le consolidated his position in the northern capital of Vientiane, Phoumi's opposition to the coup began to coalesce around the southern panhandle town of Savannakhet. On 19 October 1960, Bill Lair flew in the first installment of Lao kip to pay the dissident troops that had joined the Lao general. It was the first payment of the CIA's million dollar investment in a counter-coup. A few days later, five PARU teams of five espionage agents per team joined Phoumi's troops, where they blended into headquarters units. By late-November, Lair had set up his headquarters in Savannakhet, complete with a radio network. The radio net allowed him contact with his teams when they joined the move northward to Vientiane to unseat Kong Le. The five teams' distribution throughout the column of march was crucial to the success of the 400 kilometer thrust north to Vientiane.Warner 26-29. Once Phoumi's counter-coup succeeded on 14 December 1960, Lair moved his headquarters to Vientiane. Fitzgerald promptly joined him there. Fitzgerald saw that the PARU's flawless performance in the counter-coup was based on reliable inside information, and decided that Lair and his special forces police should remain in Laos. This series of events marked the start of the Laotian Civil War. Once established there, Lair reached out to contact Vang Pao. He flew via Air America Sikorsky H-34 to the Lao village of Tha Vieng to meet the Hmong leader on 19 January 1961. Vang Pao told Lair that his people could not live under Vietnamese communist rule. \\"Either we fight or we leave. If you give me weapons, we fight,\\" he told Lair. He promised he could call up 10,000 tribesmen for military training. They would follow him, he promised, and he pledged loyalty to the King of Laos. The approximately 4,300 Hmong who had accompanied him at Tha Vieng indicated that Vang Pao already had a sizable following. Although Lair did not know it at first, he was about to inherit a tradition of resistance to the Vietnamese. In the late-1800s the Hmong had founded zones of resistance under the command of local village chiefs. Now, many of their descendants would join the CIA effort.Conboy, Morrison, p. 61.Warner, pp. 33-34, 45, 117. Lair saw the Hmong guerrillas as a valuable supplement to the Royal Lao Army's regular forces. His seniors agreed.Ahern, pp. 36-37. Lair foresaw a possible future need for the Hmong to retreat from battle through Sainyabuli Province southward into Thailand. Although he suggested planning such a route, the complications of arranging agreement between Thailand, Laos, and the American embassy kept it from becoming a written plan.Warner, pp. 297-298. Founding L'Arm√©e Clandestine Lair took Vang Pao's offer back to Vientiane with him. By coincidence, Desmond Fitzgerald, head of the CIA's Far East Division, was on an official visit to the Station Chief for Laos, Gordon Jorgenson. Fitzgerald was a supporter of PARU. Lair convinced Fitzgerald, who was his boss's boss, that the agency should support Vang Pao's proposed guerrilla army. Funding was allocated via the Programs Evaluation Office for organizing the first 2,000 recruits into 100 man companies. The operation was classified under the code name Operation Momentum. The eventual result of Lair's initiative was a clandestine army of 30,000 hill tribesmen under Vang Pao's command.Scott, p. 101. To support the new effort, Lair brought in more PARU teams. By now, he had been promoted to lieutenant colonel in the Thai police, and was outranked only by the PARU commanding officer, Colonel Pranet Ritileuchai. In reality, Lair's control over supplies and his personal influence with Pranet and the PARU troops equalled de facto command of the unit. Lair was content with that setup, as it had led to their present success. However, additional CIA case officers such as Vint Lawrence began showing up unexpectedly and unannounced for assignment in Laos. To cope with this, Lair preferred rookie agents whom he could inculcate with his philosophy of covert operations. In quiet discursive low- key fashion that modeled the behavior needed to impress Thai or Lao, he briefed the new agents with information on the local situation even as he steered his listeners toward inevitable conclusions about the subject.Warner, p. 78. However, not all the new agents were rookies. Experienced hands arriving included Thomas Fosmire, Tony Poe, Pat Landry, Joe Hudachek, Jack Shirley, and William Young. On the heels of the incoming case agents were the Green Berets sent as training instructors. While Lair accepted the new helpers individually, he believed that Caucasians who did not speak a local language were both too visible and too linguistically handicapped for useful secret work. Nor did they possess any military skills in short supply, as the PARU troopers had mastered the same parachute and training courses as the Green BeretsWarner, pp. 51-54. Lao neutrality established In summer 1962, Lair arranged USAID air drops of food, medicine, and other essentials to Hmong uprooted by the growing war. In June, when The Saturday Evening Post ran an article on this program, Lair was content to let Edgar Buell be the public face of refugee relief, as a means of hiding CIA involvement.Warner, p. 83. In October 1962, in accordance with the International Agreement on the Neutrality of Laos, the Americans in country drew down to two CIA agents left in Laos after evacuation--Tony Poe and Vint Lawrence. However, 100 PARU troopers also remained, still engaged in training the Hmong. Lair and Landry withdrew to Nong Khai, Thailand, just across the Mekong River from Vientiane. In turn, the Vietnamese Communists officially withdrew 40 soldiers, with at least 5,000 others remaining in Laos.Warner, pp. 83-85. Nong Khai being unsuitable as a headquarters, Lair moved his operation to the Udorn Royal Thai Air Force Base. The CIA building there, called AB-1, became the nerve center of secret operations in Laos. It was hidden in plain sight, under the designation, 4802nd Joint Liaison Detachment. Co-located with it was the Thai covert operations for Laos, Headquarters 333, often referred to by its Thai nickname, \\"Kaw Taw\\".Conboy, Morrison, p. 99. With the move came a promotion. Lair was now Chief of Base, in charge of all paramilitary operations in northern Laos. He and Pat Landry, sitting at facing desks, monitored message and radio traffic from the 20 PARU teams and made their tactical and logistical decisions. At times, Lair flew into Laos for a day. Once a month, he visited his wife and child in Bangkok.Warner, pp. 86-87. In August 1963, Lair received an order to cut Route 7 between the Plain of Jars and the Vietnamese border. After Lair's training, PARU troopers, accompanying and directing 12 platoons of Hmong from their Special Guerrilla Units, infiltrated to a portion of Route 7 that ran along steep cliffs. The saboteurs planted double cratering charges in each of 120 demolition pits they dug, and exfiltrated. When the explosions blew in the middle of the night, two sections of clifftop road migrated downwards. Once again, Lair let Pop Buell claim credit.Warner, pp. 100-101. The Route 7 communist supply line would remain cut until November.Warner, p. 111. On 10 December 1963, King Sisavang Vatthana made a state visit to Long Tieng. This trip served as a seal of approval on the Hmong as Lao, and on their martial efforts. His official visit made it clear that the Hmong were accepted in Lao society, and assuaged Lair's worries that the hill tribesmen and lowland Lao might start fighting with one another.Warner, pp. 117-118. In 1964, Lair returned to the United States on home leave. While he was there, he attended a National Security Council meeting under the auspices of CIA head John McCone. When questions arose concerning the significance of Vang Pao's leadership of his clandestine army, Lair was asked to give his opinion as the officer attached to it. Lair stated that if Vang Pao should become a casualty, there were a number of competent subordinates who could take charge. McCone later thanked Lair for his apposite answer.Warner, pp. 128-129. Upon returning to Laos, Lair found that enemy activities were spreading outwards from their supply center at Tchepone. As the communists occupied more ground within Laos, they began to build the road network that was becoming known as the Ho Chi Minh Trail. Lair countered with Project Hardnose, in which reconnaissance teams were dispatched from Savannakhet and Pakse to spy on the nascent logistics route between North and South Vietnam. Air attacks seemed the only method of cutting the Ho Chi Minh Trail. The Royal Lao Air Force received its first T-28 Trojans as light strike aircraft. A pilot training program for Lao pilots dubbed Operation Waterpump was established at Udorn.Warner, pp. 131-137. Washington's attention shifts from Laos In late-August 1964, in the wake of the Tonkin Gulf incident, the RLAF struck the Mu Gia Pass and further into northern Vietnam. In an escalation of hostilities in Laos, US Air Force jets soon began \\"armed reconnaissance\\" missions. The Tonkin Gulf incident, as well as the expanding Ho Chi Minh Trail, moved the focus of US military action away from Laos and toward Vietnam.Warner, pp. 137, 141. Lair was dismayed when he learned on 8 March 1965 that US Marine Corps infantry had landed at Danang. Lair believed that if American troops were being committed to combat, they should attack Hanoi to win the war. He also believed that US troops would move from training into combat operations, and that the increasing US role would sap the fighting spirit of the South Vietnamese forces. About the same time, Lair prompted Air America Helio Courier special- operations pilot Jim Rhyne's flight that documented the expansion and improvement of the Ho Chi Minh Trail network. It became evident the trail was a growing chain of logistical links approximately 30-40 kilometers long, with porters and chauffeurs as permanent party assigned to each link.Warner, pp. 159-162. On 20 May 1965, BirdAir pilot Ernest C. Brace landed on a dirt landing strip in Laos that had just been overrun by the communists. He was promptly captured. Ambassador William H. Sullivan demanded information on Brace's status from the CIA station. Meanwhile, Lair commandeered a Beechcraft Baron to lead a rescue effort. Once in flight, he rounded up an improvised force of an Air America helicopter for the rescue, a Caribou for radio relay duties, and US-piloted T-28s for firepower. Ambassador Leonard Unger had previously granted Lair the authority to commandeer air assets and order air strikes in emergencies. As the Air America helo landed on the strip, for the first time ever, Lair directed strafing runs of the forests on either side of the runway--first the T-28s, then US F105 fighter-bombers. Sullivan was unaware of Unger's prior permission, and was angered by Lair's impromptu one- time use of air power. Sullivan demanded Lair be reprimanded. Station Chief Douglas Blaufarb, who was Lair's superior, backed Lair.Warner, pp. 163-164. This incident was not the only one concerning unauthorized air strikes. Ambassador Sullivan insisted on his authority to order and approve all air strikes within Laos. However, innocent civilians were being accidentally bombed. And American air power arrived according to the military's schedule, not the ambassador's.Warner, pp. 156-157. Lair had reservations about increased use of US air power in Laos, fearing that the Hmong and other Lao forces would become too dependent upon it. However, in the wake of the Battle of Nam Bac, he could see the need for organized forward air control for close air support. His proposal to place Lao interpreters with US fighter pilots in light aircraft to direct air strikes became the Raven Forward Air Controllers.Warner, p. 241. Moreover, he could see the utility of pilots and infantry sharing a common language. Vang Pao had already requested training slots for Hmong cadets at Project Waterpump at Udorn, and had been refused. Lair quietly scrounged a couple of Piper Cubs and began training Hmong pilots at Nong Khai.Warner, p. 166. A PARU pilot, Somboun Sithoon, served as the first instructor. The instructional staff would come to include two pilots on loan from the Royal Thai Air Force and six more from Continental Air Services, Inc. Three classes of Hmong pilots would graduate by mid-1967, including the pilot who would become the star of the RLAF, Lee Lue.Conboy, Morrison, p. 170. \\"Supermarket war\\" See also Battle of Lima Site 85, Commando Club By mid-1966, Lair had worked successfully under three Chiefs of station, running his paramilitary operations with a relatively paltry annual budget of US$20 million. The money came directly from CIA headquarters, with offers of more funding available. Lair declined the extra money, and never requested a transfer from his assignment. For 15 years, he had encouraged and nurtured native martial talent, believing the covert operation was best done with the fewest Americans possible. As a result of his influence, there were fewer than 100 Americans working in northern Laos.Warner, pp. 180-184. This ended with Ted Shackley. The new Chief of Station was appointed to deal with the increasing communist infiltration of supplies along the Ho Chi Minh Trail. His solution was to advocate more American involvement in Laos, whether in the Laotian panhandle against the Ho Chi Minh Trail, or in the north around the Plain of Jars. He was credited with finding the equivalent of an old-fashioned general store and turning it into a modern supermarket.Warner, p. 187. The swelling tide of American air power brought drastic changes to the war in Laos, and to Lair's life. Major Richard Secord reported for duty. He joined forces with Lair and Landry, and managed air operations in Laos. Lair now routinely scheduled targets for air strikes. A new covert unit, the Raven Forward Air Controllers, sprang into being to direct the increasing bombing raids. The increased CIA effort demanded greater staffing. A new enlarged headquarters building replaced AB-1 to accommodate the increase in newly assigned CIA staff. As the war escalated, there were turf conflicts within the US effort because it lacked a unified command structure.Warner, 192-194, 197-199, 203, 241. An example of the difficulties inherent in the enlarged war was the siting of Lima Site 85 on a mountaintop at Phou Pha Thi, Laos. This clandestine guidance radar facility was proposed at a mid-1967 meeting chaired by General Hunter Harris. Its purpose was radar directed air raids into Hanoi. Lair's opinion of the installation was asked, as he was the local expert, and he was being charged with its defense. He predicted that the Vietnamese would build a road toward the radar site until they could attack it. When asked if LS 85 could be defended, Lair pointed out that guerrilla forces were not equipped or trained for fixed defensive battles. He recommended the use of special forces or other trained infantry for defense, but his request was rejected.Warner, p. 205. In January 1968, North Vietnamese forces bypassed the site temporarily to attack royalist positions at the Battle of Nam Bac.Warner, pp. 208-210. Despite the PAVN's delay of the battle, Lair's prediction of Lima Site 85's fall was prophetic. The radar site was captured by Vietnamese sappers on 11 March 1968 even though Hmong guerrillas and Thai mercenaries remained on the mountain. Shackley had predicted in a cable to headquarters that the site could not hold out beyond 10 March. The accuracy of Shackley's estimate burnished his reputation in the agency.Warner, pp. 226-234. Departure from Laos At odds with both his station chief and Ambassador Sullivan, tagged with the loss of Lima Site 85, and diminished by the expanding American operations of the Laotian war, Bill Lair departed Laos in August 1968. He declined a possible assignment to the Phoenix Program in Vietnam. Lair, who had become the Lawrence of Arabia of Laos, left behind a 30,000 man guerrilla army.Warner, pp. 246, 331-333. He attended the Army War College, and was then stationed in Bangkok.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 199, 205. Having concluded that he would never be promoted to chief of station anywhere, and knowing he was tagged as a Thai/Lao specialist within the CIA, he settled into bureaucracy in his wife's hometown. His title was assistant chief of station, and special operations naturally became his beat. When Leka, the exiled monarch of Albania arrived to buy weaponry, Lair prompted the Thai quashing of the arms deal. Most of Lair's duties, though, required him to keep track of the drug trade in the area. For the most part, the Thai senior officers involved in the opium trade had been trained by Lair. They knew him well enough to know his skepticism about banning drugs, and that he would not retaliate on them. They also knew the king favored him, and that Lair's in- laws were politically influential. Lair would simply ask these officers for needed information, bypassing all the rigamarole of tasking undercover agents to spy upon the drug trade.Warner, pp. 331-333. Lair was still working in Bangkok when the Vietnam War ended. On 18 June 1975, Vang Pao visited Bangkok on his way into exile in Missoula, Montana. Lair wished the Hmong general good luck. At about the same time, Lair was consulted about the possibility of paramilitary operations in Cambodia. He recommended against the attempt because the communists already controlled the countryside.Warner, pp. 351-352.Conboy, Morrison, p. 423. Bill Lair would pull off one more intelligence coup before his retirement. Siddhi Savetsila, Lair's brother-in- law, was a member of a Thai delegation that visited the hospital room of a dying Mao Tse-tung. Lair channeled the resulting intelligence back to Washington, DC. Both President Gerald Ford and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger were thus made privy to details of the maneuvering of possible successors to the Great Helmsman. Despite this, CIA management told Lair they had no domestic assignment for him after Bangkok. Lair decided to retire. He was honored by King Bhumipol with a private audience before he departed.Warner, pp. 333-357. Post CIA career Bill Lair retired from the CIA as a GS-16, the civil service equivalent of a brigadier general. He was 53 years old, with two grown children in college. He had a ranch to retire to, near Waco, but no means of cashing in on his life experience except a return to Thailand. Refusing to trade on his old friendships overseas, he instead became a long haul trucker. His past Asian expertise would be called upon only once more, in 1992, when he was again asked about the chances of setting up a paramilitary network in Cambodia. He again deemed it impossible.Warner, pp. 375-377. James William Lair continued to be prominent in Hmong-American affairs. On 4 July 2013, he was honored with an 89th birthday celebration by the Hmong-American community, including a reunion with the Hmong Laotian Civil War veterans with whom he had served.News video from Suab Hmong News; Richard Wanglue Vang, interviewer. http://gotocinemass.com/Entertainment/YtVideo/Index?videoId=jUw1ZIajYWA&name;=Suab%20Hmong%20News:%20Exclusive%20covered%20Hmong%20SGU%20basi%20for%20Col.%20Bill%20Lair Retrieved 30 September 2014.

Passenger service began February 1926 and service on the lake began with the launching of the propeller-driven motor vessel MV Pentowna in June. CNR had transfer slips in Peachland, Westbank, Penticton, and Kelowna, and shared with Canadian Pacific Railroad (CPR) in Summerland and Naramata. The Pentowna transported passengers between Penticton and Kelowna, hence the name. She competed with Sicamous, but was converted to haul freight in 1937 due to her ungainly appearance and problems with vibrations.Affleck, Edward L. Steamboating on the Columbia River System in British Columbia. Vancouver: Alexander Nicolls Press. 2002. CNR ended its barge service in 1973 due to the new highways and other modes of transportation. Construction CN Tug no. 6 joined CNR's fleet in 1948. While it appears to have been built to meet service demands, some speculate that Tug 6 was launched because CPR, CNR's competitor, had launched the the previous year. It was built in 1948 by Yarrows Shipbuilders, Esquimalt, BC and registered in Esquimalt, B.C.Turner, Robert D. Sternwheelers and Steam Tugs. Victoria: Sono Nis Press, 1947. Tug 6 was all-steel, including the hull, with an eight-cylinder, turbo-charged diesel engine. It had a single blade rudder and a nominal horsepower of 575. It was 88 feet long, 22 feet wide, and 10 feet, 6 inches deep with a gross tonnage of 158 tons. There were three double cabins and a storage room on board. Service Like the tugboat Naramata, Tug 6 transported fruit, mail, and other freight. .\\"S.S. Sicamous Restoration Society\\". The Story of Lake Boats in the Okanagan . August 2014. It was used to push and pull barges loaded with railcars full of fruit from Osoyoos, Penticton, Naramata, Summerland, Peachland, Gellatly's Point, and Westbank to the rail yard at Kelowna, where they were then loaded onto the trains to Vancouver to be shipped across Canada. Although not as glorious as the passenger sternwheelers such as Sicamous, tugboats were essential in the development of the Okanagan, as they developed the fruit industry and economy of the region. =Crew= The last crew of Tug 6 is as follows:\\"CN Tug, Barge end Service Today\\".

Thus, Tug 6 was the last tugboat to operate on Okanagan Lake. It was sold to Fintry Estates in 1973, along with Okanagan, while Pentowna was moved to the Peachland waterfront. Thirteen years later, the city of Kelowna bought Tug 6 from its owner at the time, Angela Percy, for CAD$35 000.\\"City buys lake tugboat as floating museum piece\\". Capital News. p.

Tug 6 was moved to Penticton on June 16, 2007, to rest alongside Sicamous and Naramata, becoming the only ship at Heritage Park to have been fueled by diesel instead of coal. Restoration began with the construction of a bridge from the park to the floating tug. Cleaning and painting followed.

It was founded by the caricaturist, journalist, and publisher Charles Philipon. The magazine's immediate predecessor was Journal pour rire which Philipon had founded in 1849. In 1856, he replaced it with Journal amusant and simultaneously started Petit Journal pour rire for his friend Nadar to edit, although Nadar was to contribute to both publications.Hambourg, Maria Morris et al.

The command center was relocated from Vientiane to Udorn Royal Thai Air Base in northern Thailand. Agency officials wanted Lair to remain in command at Udorn and for Landry to remain in Vientiane to command the southern operations group. Landry refused the promotion in order to remain Lair's deputy at Udorn. The move to Udorn made sense because that large base was capable of supporting an enormous Air Branch flight and maintenance program, as well as serving as the center of Agency theater photo-reconnaissance and photo-analysis efforts in support of SOG special operations in the Laos theater of operations. Udorn housed a large contingent of Air American platforms as well as US Air Force combat resources.

He was one of the first eight smokejumpers recruited out of the University of Montana by the Central Intelligence Agency's famed Special Activities Division (renamed Special Activities Center in 2016 https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/05/04/measuring-change-at-the-cia/) in Spring 1951.Conboy and Morrison, p. 123. He was subsequently offered a staff position in Special Operating Group and, together with Major (later Brigadier General) Heinie Aderholt‚Äîwho had been seconded to the Agency from the US Air Force‚Äîstood up a separate paramilitary air wing‚Äîlater formalized as Air Branch. SOG/Air Branch (and Thorsrud) subsequently played a major role in virtually every Agency covert action in the Third World during the cold war and beyond. In 1956, Thorsrud established an air operations base carved out of the jungle in a western pacific location and from there he oversaw air delivery of men and supplies to support President Eisenhower's program to de- stabilize the Sukarno regime in Indonesia. Gar was assigned President and CEO of Intermountain Aviation, a covert aviation maintenance company, based out of Marana Air Park (now Pinal Air Park), near Tucson, AZ about 1960. He recruited a number of former Smokejumpers and other witting \\"agency\\" employees, and a larger number of unwitting employees who were not told of their CIA connection. In order to maintain their aviation cover business, Intermountain regularly repaired and maintained the aviation interests of other worldly businesses and persons. Gar contracted with Hugh Heffner in the 1960s to repair and paint the famous jet-black Playboy Bunny DC-9 airplane. Later he cleverly negotiated a deal with the Big-3 auto makers to ship car parts between auto factories across the eastern U.S. in agency C-46 aircraft, allthewhile funneling millions from the auto makers into the covert company's bank accounts. When the Soviets abandoned an arctic weather and listening station in the mid-1960s, after the ice pack it was built on broke adrift, Thorsrud organized the air assets from Intermountain Aviation for Operation Cold Feet, a remarkable joint CIA-US Navy operation that put 2 officers on the floating ice flow to recover a treasure trove of documents, instruments and equipment abandoned there by the Soviets. Thorsrud then successfully extracted the two officers by means of a \\"cow catcher\\" attached to a converted B-17 bomber that snagged a line attached to an inflated balloon and connected to the men by harness. This incredible feat in the arctic slowly leaked out and became the basis for the spy thriller film \\"Ice Station Zebra.\\" During the early years of China operations, Air Branch assumed control of several private Asian cargo airlines and turned them into CIA proprietary companies. These included Civil Air Transport (CAT), purchased from its founder General Claire Chennault, as well as Air America, and lesser known air proprietaries such as BirdAir, and Southern Air Transport. Gar was in charge of running CIA air operations during the April 1961 invasion of Cochinos Bay, Cuba. Gar was also a great family man; raising three children with his wife Audrey, who continues to live in the Tucson area. Tributes to Gar and Intermountain Aviation hang on the walls of CIA headquarters in Langley, VA. Thorsrud later founded Mountain West Aviation in 1975 which in turn became Sierra Pacific Airlines.Obituary. Retrieved May 20, 2015 Notes References * Conboy, Kenneth J., and James Morrison.

It includes various genres, including aphorisms, poetry, and fiction (or some combination thereof) written by individuals or collaboratively. The 280-character maximum imposed by the medium, upgraded from 140 characters in late 2017, provides a creative challenge. Genres =Aphorism= Aphorisms are popular because their brevity is inherently suited to Twitter. People often share well known classic aphorisms on Twitter, but some also seek to craft and share their own brief insights on every conceivable topic. Boing Boing has described Twitter as encouraging \\"a new age of the aphorism\\", citing the novel aphorisms of Aaron Haspel. =Poetry= Haiku are a brief poetic form well suited to Twitter; many examples can be found using the hashtag #haiku. Other forms of poetry can be found under other hashtags or by \\"following\\" people who use their Twitter accounts for journals or poetry. For example, the Swedish poet and journalist G√∂ran Greider tweets observations and poems using the Twitter handle @GreiderDD (G√∂ran Greider) as shown in the example on the right. =Fiction= Twitterature fiction includes 140-character stories, fan fiction, the retelling of literary classics and legends, twitter novels, and collaborative works. *140-character stories: refers to that fiction that fits into a single tweet.Jorge, Clinton, et al. \\"Storytelling and the use of social media in digital art installations.\\" International Conference on Interactive Digital Storytelling. Springer International Publishing, 2013. An example of these stories are those written by James Mark Miller @asmallfiction, Sean Hill @veryshortstories, or Arjun Basu @arjunbasu (shown on the right). A number of Twitter journals dedicate themselves to the form. In 2013, The Guardian challenged traditionally published authors such as Jeffrey Archer and Ian Rankin to write their 140-character stories. The Guardian then featured their attempts. *Fan fiction: Twitter accounts have been created for characters in films, TV series, and books. Some of these tweet accounts take the events in the original works as their starting point. *Literary classics and legends: Literary classics and legends are retold on Twitter, either by characters' tweeting and interacting, or by retelling in tweet format, often in modern language using slang. In 2009, Alexander Aciman and Emmet Rensin published Twitterature: The World's Greatest Books Retold Through Twitter. In 2010, a group of rabbis tweeted the Exodus, with the hashtag #TweetTheExodus; in 2011, the Royal Shakespeare Company and the English game company Mudlark tweeted the story of Romeo and Juliet. *The twitter novel is another form of fiction that can extend over hundreds of tweets to tell a longer story. Twitter novels can run for months, with one or more tweets daily. Context is usually maintained by a unique hashtag: searching by this produces a list of all available tweets in the series. Some serials are posted in short updates that encourage the reader to follow and to speculate on the next installment. Examples include Small Places, written by Nick Belardes using the Twitter account @smallplaces. Small Places began on April 25, 2008 with the tweet as shown on the right. Another example is Executive Severance, written by Robert K. Blechman using the Twitter account @RKBs_Twitstery. Executive Severance, which is Book 1 of The Twitstery Twilogy and is the first live-tweeted Twitter comic mystery, or \\"Twitstery\\", began on May 6, 2009 with the tweet shown. The Golden Parachute, Twitstery Twilogy Book 2, appeared a Kindle eBook in 2016 and I Tweet, Therefore I am, the concluding Book 3, was released early in 2017. *Epic Retold is another noteworthy work in this genre. The New Indian Express called it an ‚Äúaudacious attempt‚Äù ‚Äúto fit the mother of all epics, the Mahabharata, into the microblogging site Twitter‚Äù. Tweeted from @epicretold, and subsequently published as a full-length book by Harper Collins India, the story was narrated in \\"2,628 tweets\\" between July 2009 to October 2014. In an interview with Time, author Chindu Sreedharan said it was an attempt to simplify the lengthy epic and make it accessible to the new generation‚Äîboth in India and abroad. *Hari Manev, who does not use Twitter, published his twitter novel The Eye, which is Volume 1 in the twitter trilogy The Meaning of Fruth, as Kindle eBook in 2019. Traditionally published authors such as Jennifer Egan and David Mitchell have also attempted the twitter novel. Jennifer Egan's \\"Black Box\\", first published in about 500 tweets in 2012, and David Mitchell's \\"The Right Sort\\", first published as almost 300 tweets sent over one week in 2014. The first published book entirely composed on Twitter was John Roderick (musician)'s Electric Aphorisms, which Roderick composed in individual tweets Between December 2008 and May 2009 and deleted on publication of the book itself by Publication Studio in November, 2009. The author of a Twitter novel is often unknown to the readers. The Twitter account name can be a character in the story or a pseudonym. This anonymity creates an air of authenticity. *Collaborative works: Neil Gaiman coined the term \\"interactive twovel\\" for an experiment in involving his Twitter followers in collaborating with him on a novel. This was conducted with BBC America Audio Books. The first tweet from Gaiman was as shown on the right. Then, he invited his readers to continue the story under the hashtag #bbcawdio. The result was published as an audiobook under the title Hearts, Keys and Puppetry, with the author given as Neil Gaiman & Twitterverse. Teju Cole sent lines from his short story \\"Hafiz\\" to other Twitter users and then retweeted them to assemble the story. =Weird Twitter= Weird Twitter is a loose genre of Internet humour dedicated to publication of humorous material on Twitter that is disorganised and hard to explain. Related to anti-humour and created primarily by Twitter users who are not professional humourists, Weird Twitter-style jokes may be presented as disorganised thoughts, rather than in a conventional joke format or punctuated sentence structure. The genre is based around the restriction of Twitter's 280-character (previously 140) message length, requiring jokes to be quite short. The genre may also include repurposing of overlooked material on the internet, such as parodying posts made by spambots or deliberately amateurish images created in Paint. The New York Times has described the genre as \\"inane\\" and intended \\"to subtly mock the site's corporate and mainstream users.\\" Related accounts include originators such as dril and, more tangentially, authors such as poet Patricia Lockwood. History Twitter was launched in 2006. The first Twitter novels appeared in 2008. The origins of the term \\"Twitterature\\" are hard to determine, but it was popularized by Aciman and Rensin's book. Since then the phenomenon has been discussed in the arts and culture sections of several major newspapers. In addition to \\"twovel\\", the terms \\"twiction\\" and \\"tweet fic\\" (Twitter fiction), \\"twiller\\" (Twitter thriller) and \\"phweeting\\" (fake tweeting) also exist. Twitterature has been called a literary genre, but is more accurately an adaptation of various genres to social media. The writing is often experimental or playful; with some authors or initiators seeking to find out how the medium of Twitter affects storytelling or how a story spreads through the medium. A Swedish site called Nanoismer.se was launched in 2011 to \\"challenge people to write deeper than what Twitter is for\\". References Further reading A. Aciman, E.

As a child she acted as a Minister of Youth, Sports and Culture. She studied at All Saints School and Awkunanaw Girls High School in Enugu. She boxed, played basketball, and was captain of the girls' soccer team. During her A-Levels at Idia College, Benin, Igwe began to explore her creative side.

She loved her family, and resolved to always be there for them. Amaka Igwe invested in people, and they remain her testimony. She often told those she directly trained that she would give them what she has so they could add to what they have and be better than her. She never thought she was indispensable, and she was committed to the growth and sustenance of the Creative Industries. Honors and tribute Igwe won a number of awards during her career.

He served as a Green Beret in the U.S. Army, Paramilitary Officer in Special Activities Division for the Central Intelligence Agency, and finally as a mercenary soldier. Bacon is remembered as a talented eccentric whose hatred of communism was so great he disobeyed orders to refrain from combat while he served in Vietnam as a member of MACV-SOG. Although trained as a combat medic, he joined raids into Cambodia during Operation Menu. Following discharge from the U.S. Army, Bacon spent time as a civilian before joining the Central Intelligence Agency. He worked as a case officer for them during the Secret War in Laos through 1975. After supposedly leaving the CIA, he became an anti-communist mercenary in the Angolan Civil War, though he may have been working undercover. He was killed in action while attempting to demolish a crucial highway bridge to block an enemy advance. Vietnam Bacon served in the Vietnam War as a Green Beret during 1968‚Äì1969. He was trained as a combat medic. He is remembered as a skinny man with very wide shoulders, a piercing stare from under the brim of an ugly floppy hat, and a reputation for eccentricity. His linguistic talent led him to master Vietnamese and the Bru language while serving in Vietnam. At one time, he served on Recon Team Sidewinder of MACV-SOG. On 23 August 1968, he was at MACV-SOG's Command and Control North base to be considered for promotion. He was unfortunate enough to be napping directly in the path of an attacking force of PAVN sappers; he was severely wounded in the shoulder. Because Bacon's medical training was considered too valuable to hazard, especially considering that MACV-SOG's casualty rate exceeded 100%, he was ordered to remain on base at the Command and Control North headquarters. Instead, outraged by denial of the chance to directly battle communism, he went absent without leave southward to Command and Control Central, and finagled his way onto MACV-SOG's Recon Team Illinois. In May 1969, in a memorable operation, Bacon infiltrated into Cambodia as a member of this team. It was tasked with gathering bomb damage assessment in the wake of the third Operation Menu B-52 raid. Team Illinois was inserted only 20 minutes after the bombing, with the intention of capturing a stunned enemy soldier for military intelligence interrogation. The team had to shoot its way out, with Bacon and John Plaster laying down heavy suppressive fire. United States After discharge from the military, Bacon had difficulty reintegrating into civilian life. He alternated between working for the CIA, and an administrative position at University of Massachusetts. What he perceived as the ineptitude of higher-ups in the CIA at running covert operations frustrated him. The liberal politics of the campus infuriated him. He took solace in riding a home-built Harley-Davidson, and rocketing around town in his battered Morris Minor while training with the CIA. Laos He then turned his military expertise to account as a case agent for the Central Intelligence Agency. His offbeat behavior at Camp Peary bothered his CIA handlers, as Bacon carried around his pet gerbils during training, chewed incessantly on a toothbrush, and secured his Rolex watch with a cord for a wristband. Bacon was still only 24 years old. After completing training, the CIA shipped him off to the Kingdom of Laos to serve in the Laotian Civil War. He relieved Robert Burr Smith as the liaison to General Vang Pao, and quickly picked up Lao. At some point, he also learned Mandarin. Subsequently, he was assigned to be the regimental adviser to Groupe Mobile-24 on the Plain of Jars in June 1971. Using the radio call sign Kayak, he led his mixed band of Lao and Thai irregulars into battle, only to be chastised for risking himself. Nevertheless, George Bacon led his guerrilla band into offensives through war's end. His roommate in Laos related some of Bacon's oddities. He stated that Bacon would strip naked at bedtime, then lie in his bunk through the night crunching crackers and reading obscure books and articles. He was notably a lone hand, though he got along with his fellow case officers.Parker, pp. 49, 168‚Äì169. Angola After serving his tour in Laos, Bacon left the Agency. Even though his efforts in Laos had earned an Intelligence Star, he was so disgusted with American policy that he apparently quit the CIA. He then went to Angola, where he was killed in action in an ambush while working as a mercenary. His cover story was that he was a freelance journalist for Soldier of Fortune magazine. It took Bacon a couple of tries to join the mercenaries being hired by the National Liberation Front of Angola in 1975; they suspected him of being a CIA plant. Once recruited, he flew to Kinshasa on 6 February 1976 to report for duty with Colonel Callan. He was greeted with a telephone call from the American Embassy, ordering him back to the United States. Despite his becoming aware that the mercenary force was poorly organized and supported, with few members, many of dubious martial ability, Bacon remained committed to crossing the border into the fighting in Angola. The Cuban-backed MPLA was beating them badly there. The mercenaries were outnumbered thousands to one. Bacon turned to providing weapons training to local soldiery, instructing 10 to 20 at a time. On 14 February 1976, in a symbolic act of resistance, the mercenaries decided to block the MPLA's mechanized advance by blowing up a concrete highway bridge. Bacon, accompanied by several other mercenaries, mined the bridge for demolition before departing. They were fleeing the scene in a Land Rover when they ran into the rear stake-bed truck of an enemy column of dozens of vehicles. The Land Rover was riddled with enemy bullets before the soldiers of fortune could open fire. Before dying of multiple wounds, Bacon shoved fellow mercenary Gary Acker from the Land Rover. On 26 February 1976, the American Embassy in Kinshasa reported Bacon's death in action in Angola. Three other American citizens, originally reported killed in the same ambush, would later be tried by a People's Revolutionary Tribune. He may have still been working undercover for the CIA at the time of his death. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, who oversaw the attempted return of Bacon's remains, acknowledged him as a mercenary. He was the sole American killed in Angola. Legacy George Bacon III's remains were never recovered. He is memorialized by a scholarship established by his family at University of Louisiana-Monroe.

Gurney was the son of John Gurney (1845‚Äì1887), a member of the influential Quaker Gurney banking family, and Isabel Blake-Humfrey. He joined the diplomatic service and served in various early postings in Europe. From 1911 he worked as secretary to the British Embassy in Berlin. Following the outbreak of the First World War, he was appointed as First Secretary to the Embassy in Copenhagen on 16 August 1914, where he served through most of the conflict. Gurney was not popular at Copenhagen where he was accused of being timid and lacking in judgement by Ambassador Ralph Paget. When Paget took up the position of Ambassador to Brazil in the summer of 1918, the Foreign Office in London decided to remove Gurney from Copenhagen as well due to his being almost universally disliked by his subordinates. On 10 July 1918 Lord Kilmarnock replaced Gurney as First Secretary. This highly unusual move of replacing the First Secretary at the same time as the Ambassador threatened to cut short Gurney's advancement and diplomatic career, but the crisis eventually passed.Kaarsted, Tage; Great Britain and Denmark 1914-1920; Odense, 1979: page 30 Hugh Gurney returned to Copenhagen as Ambassador to Denmark in his own right in 1933, serving until 1935.

Its cloud production platform delivers picture-in-picture viewing experiences, which allows digital viewers to switch in and out of alternative audio feeds presented by guest commentators. Kiswe connects at- home viewers with live events and in-venue fans through interactive video that create memorable social experiences and build loyalty. Kiswe‚Äôs video production solution, CloudCast, uses cloud-based technology to transform the way live games and events are professionally produced and broadcast. The Kiswe suite of solutions is used by the world‚Äôs largest broadcasters, media companies, sports and eSports leagues, and music labels, including Big Hit Entertainment, NBA, Globo, MLS, PGA Tour, Turner Sports and many more. Kiswe is headquartered in the U.S. and has offices in Europe and Asia. Background The company was started in autumn 2013. Its three founders are Jeong Kim, an engineer and former president of Bell Labs; Wim Sweldens, a scientist and innovator in communications and signal processing who had been at Alcatel-Lucent; and Jimmy Lynn, former sports executive with AOL and professor at Georgetown University‚Äôs McDonough School of Business. During its stealth mode period, Kim said the new venture was at the juncture of next- generation Web technology and sports and said that their \\"secret sauce\\" was the technology to allow interactive video to be applied to sports. Kim's initial goals were for $1 million in funding. Partnerships The first substantial use of Kiswe technology came in May 2014 in the Women's National Basketball Association, when the Washington Mystics began testing the Mystics Live application. Mystics Live is a free mobile application that allows users view the team's home games live on their smartphone or tablet, choosing among the broadcast feed or five alternate camera angles, triggering replays from any of those angles, and showing real-time statistics. It can be used both by fans at the game or by those not at the game but within a radius. Ted Leonsis, owner of the Mystics and its Monumental Network digital platform, said Mystics Live would enhance the in-arena experience for the team's fans and in general better engage and reach the mobile generation. (Kiswe co-founder Kim is a partner in Monumental Sports & Entertainment, the group that Leonsis heads.) The WNBA was an effective vehicle for the application because the league is more open to new business ventures and because there are no entrenched regional sports networks paying rights fees to carry Mystics games who would object to a local streaming service. Kiswe is partnering with the National Basketball Association to expand viewership beyond traditional broadcasts through remote production tools. Kiswe's cloud-based platform delivers picture-in-picture viewing experiences during NBA games, which allow digital viewers to switch in and out of alternative audio feeds presented by guest commentators. In an interview with SportsPro Media, Melissa Brenner, EVP of Digital Media at the NBA stated, \\"The [Kiswe] technology is relatively easy to set up and easy to scale, so we are having a lot of fun experimenting with that. It is good for us on two levels; to understand how to scale personalisation, but also to learn how to train the next generation of broadcasters.\\" In 2019, Kiswe launched a strategic partnership with Vidgo, a live TV streaming service, to enable social interactions for Vidgo's mobile app while people watch live TV. . Kiswe also worked with CrossFit to provide an open-source broadcasting model for their annual CrossFit Games, allowing their community to take an open feed and freely distribute the program on any platform or channel they choose. . The result led to 28 open-source broadcasts, which brought in over 70 remote casters with broadcasts delivered in 10 different languages. On June 8, 2020 Kiswe announced a strategic partnership with Big Hit Entertainment for BTS' Bang Bang Con: The Live. The virtual concert took place on June 14, 2020 and garnered over 750,000 views, achieving the Guinness World Records title for most viewers for a music concert live stream. The live-streamed show reached a peak of 756,000 concurrent viewers in 107 countries and territories. Attendance was the equivalent of 15 shows at a 50,000 seat stadium and was the biggest audience for a paid virtual concert, according to Variety Magazine. The partnership saw a dynamic live streaming concert that let fans \\"have a heightened experience that includes features such as interactive regional chats and ‚Äúchoosing their own seat‚Äù via different viewing options.\\" The experience also let audience members from around the world feel like they're in the same venue with innovative fan engagement features. Business model Kiswe is part of a wave of over-the-top content programming that provides alternate digital platforms that are not delivered via traditional cable or satellite services. The company's applications are designed to appeal to the younger demographic; as Kiswe co-founder Lynn has said, \\"One situation facing the major leagues is the youth market. They are losing the youth market because there are so many mobile devices, social networking and gaming.\\" Co-founder and Chief Architect Sweldens has stressed that the company wants to create innovation in the space where television, mobile, and social media intersect.

He has authored or co- authored more than 250 articles and more than 10 books.Center for Anxiety and Depression, Mercer Island Career outline Dunner went to medical school at Washington University in St. Louis, where the psychiatry department was run along biological lines by Eli Robins. After residency in Philadelphia and back at St Louis, he worked at the National Institute for Mental Health for two years. Along with fellow researchers Frederick K. Goodwin and Elliot S. Gershon he developed the concept of what they called Bipolar II Disorder. Dunner notes that their influential 1976 paper on Bipolar II took six years to get published.DAVID L.DUNNER Interviewed by Thomas A. Ban for the ANCP, Waikoloa, Hawaii, December 13, 2001 He then went to New York for eight years to work with Ronald R. Fieve on studies of Bipolar disorder and the emerging Lithium treatment, and developed the concept of 'rapid cycling' for bipolar disorder which was found to show less response to Lithium (he credits Canadian scientist Harvey Stancer for first noticing the connection a year prior). Dunner then moved back to Washington becoming professor at the University of Washington in Seattle and chief of psychiatry at Harborview Medical Centre. While there he set up The Center for Anxiety and Depression and became the foremost \\"clinical expert in bipolar disorder and treatment-resistant depression in the Seattle area\\". Since his medical residency he has been \\"involved in clinical studies of every single drug on the US market at least once, if not many times\\". He has also conducted studies of manualized psychotherapies compared to or combined with medication. He has remarked that he is disappointed they have not discovered the bipolar gene, which he and Elliot Gershon thought they would discover in the early 1970s. Titles and awards Dunner has been President of the American Psychopathological Association (APPA), President of the Psychiatric Research Society and President of the Society of Biological Psychiatry. He has been editor of the journal Comprehensive Psychiatry. He has won the Samuel Hamilton Award and the Morton Prince Award from the APPA, the Robert Jones Lectureship from the Canadian Psychiatric Association, and the Ward Smith Award from the West Coast College of Biological Psychiatry. Pharmaceutical controversies Dunner was on a 1991 FDA Psychopharmacologic Drugs Advisory Committee which advised that there was not sufficient evidence to support a proposal that antidepressant drugs could cause suicidality or other violent behaviors. However, 5 of the 9 members had financial links to pharmaceutical companies and Dunner in particular had extensive financial links both before and after the hearings with Prozac manufacturer Eli Lilly - the company which testified in person during the hearings. Dunner was subsequently involved in controversy over apparent links between Paxil (seroxat) and suicide/violence. When called to testify in 2001 regarding prior inaccurate data analyses used to conclude there was no link, he claimed to have published without seeing the actual data but only tables provided to him by employees of the drug manufacturer SmithKlineBeecham (now GlaxoSmithKline).Lawyers and Settlements, Feb 12th 2008 Evelyn PringleScandal of scientists who take money for papers ghostwritten by drug companies Sarah Boseley, health editor.

She was the last Chairwoman of the BBC Trust before its abolition and the first woman to hold the post. On 3 September 2017, it was announced that Trade Policy Minister Lord Price would leave the government; on 28 September, Fairhead was appointed to succeed him. Fairhead resigned as Minister of State in May 2019. Early life and education Fairhead was born Rona Haig in Cumbria in 1961 and educated at Yarm Grammar School, near Stockton-on-Tees, North East England before attending St Catharine's College, Cambridge; she was president of the Cambridge University Law Society before graduating with a double first in law (Bachelor of Arts, BA). She later obtained a Masters in Business Administration from Harvard Business School. Professional career Fairhead's early business career was spent at Bain & Company and Morgan Stanley in the 1980s before she moved to British Aerospace as an independent consultant in 1991. Later in 1991 she moved to Short Brothers shortly after it was bought by Bombardier Inc. She rose to become vice-president for corporate strategy and public affairs in 1994 and then vice-president, UK aerospace services in 1995. In 1996, she became director of planning and acquisitions for Imperial Chemical Industries before joining the company's executive management team as executive vice-president for planning and communications in 1997, and continuing as executive vice-president for strategy and control from 1998 to 2001. From 2002 to 2006, Fairhead served as chief financial officer for Pearson PLC. Fairhead moved to the Financial Times Group (a subsidiary of Pearson) in 2006 as chief executive. She oversaw the sale of several of the group's other titles during her tenure. She has also served as a non-executive director on the boards of several large corporations, including PepsiCo, and is a former Director of HSBC Holdings and former \\"business ambassador\\" for UK Trade & Investment. She stepped down from her Financial Times role in 2013 after being overlooked for the position of Chairwoman of the Pearson Group when the post was vacated by the previous incumbent, Marjorie Scardino. Her leaving package was estimated to be worth over ¬£1 million in addition to stock options estimated at over ¬£3 million‚Äîa contributing factor to a shareholder revolt at Pearson's annual general meeting in April 2014. In August 2014 Culture Secretary Sajid Javid recommended Fairhead as the preferred candidate for the chairmanship of the BBC Trust, following the departure of Chris Patten, who resigned on health grounds in May. Sources such as The Guardian and The Daily Telegraph reported that her appointment had caused surprise at the BBC, which had expected someone with a higher public profile to get the job. Others considered for the post were Sebastian Coe, the former Chairman of the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games, and former Camelot Group chief executive Dianne Thompson. Fairhead officially took up the BBC Trust role on an acting basis on 9 September 2014, following approval by the House of Commons Select Committee for Culture, Media and Sport. She was formally appointed by the Privy Council of the United Kingdom on 8 October 2014, for a four-year term beginning the following day. In September 2016, Fairhead announced that she would not be applying to head the new unitary board replacing the BBC Trust. Appearance before Public Accounts Committee In March 2015 Fairhead appeared before the Public Accounts Committee of the House of Commons as a non-executive director of the Swiss subsidiary of HSBC. Margaret Hodge, the chair of the committee, stated that in the light of her performance as an HSBC director, she was no longer fit to continue in her role heading the BBC Trust. Hodge was accused of making a \\"bullying\\" attack. Ministerial and parliamentary career On 28 September 2017 the government announced that Fairhead would become an unpaid Minister of State at the Department for International Trade, succeeding Mark, Lord Price. In addition, it was announced that Fairhead would be granted a life peerage. On 19 October, she was created Baroness Fairhead, of Yarm in the County of North Yorkshire. Baroness Fairhead resigned her ministerial position on 7 May 2019, citing personal reasons. Personal life Fairhead's husband, Tom, is a businessman and director of Campbell Lutyens. He was a Conservative councillor for Earl's Court in West London from 1994 to 2010. He now serves as an honorary alderman of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea. The couple have three children. Rona Fairhead is a qualified pilot and her hobbies include flying and scuba diving. Towards the end of her tenure with the Financial Times Group, Fairhead was treated for breast cancer. She was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2012 New Year's Honours List for \\"services to UK Industry\\".

It won two Blue Ribbon Awards in 1976: Best Director (Fukasaku) and Best Actor (Sugawara). Complex named it number 6 on their list of The 25 Best Yakuza Movies. Kino International released the film on DVD in North America in 2006. Plot In the year 1963, in the fictional city of Kurashima, two yakuza gangs - the originally Osaka-based Kawade under Kasumi Kawade, who use political connections in local assemblyman and ex-yakuza boss Masaichi Tomoayasu to further their activities, and the Ohara, under acting boss Kenji Hirotani, who have an alliance with the local police - are battling for local supremacy. After Ohara men raid one of Tomoyasu's bars for a hostess who worked for Hirotani before changing patrons and after helping in assigning the blame on a selected Ohara member, Detective Tokomatsu Kuno has a low-level Kawade soldier arrested on a blackmail charge. He also obtains information on an upcoming land deal involving the Kawade and Tomoyasu, which he reveals to Hirotani. The auction is put on hold, and Hirotani manages to gain control of it. Later, after a night spent at Hirotani's bar, Kuno and Hirotani reminisce on their first meeting: it is revealed that Kuno had shielded after Hirotani completed a successful hit on a rival crime boss seven years earlier. Elsewhere, Ohara members and their police friends get into a fight with a truck driver, who is revealed to have been working for Kawade, who uses this a pretext for an all- out gang war against Hirotani. With the war in full swing, Kawade, Tomoyasu, and Kubo's influence with Police Commissioner Kikkuchi has crusading Lieutenant Shoichi Kaida is assigned to lead the crackdown against the Ohara family. Kaida sets about ordering the officers - Kuno included - to stop fraternizing with the yakuza, and makes his point by smashing bottles of sake Hirotani had sent to them one night. Yoshihura, one of the officers under Tomoyasu's payroll, gets into a fight with Kaida, resigns, and joins Tomoyasu's law office. Boss Ohara is later released as his sentence as ended. Elsewhere, Hirotani is angered with Kuno when he and his men are no longer being tipped off on upcoming police raids. After a raid at Ohara family headquarters, Boss Ohara is taken in for questioning, and under the advice of Tomoyasu (his sworn brother from years before), agrees to retire permanently, disband his family, and surrender all his assets to Boss Kawade. Kuno meanwhile lets one of Hirotani's men (one had met at the film's beginning), go free. The man is arrested later however, and he believes Kuno had sold him out. Kuno gets into an argument with Kaida over how they should properly deal with the gangs and gets suspended after the two men fight. As a result of all this, Hirotani and his remaining men kidnap Yoshihura and hold him hostage just as Hirotani's arrest warrant arrives. The police mobilize and attempt to besiege the hotel, but all attempts to convince Hirotani to surrender are unsuccessful. Kawamoto, a friend of Hirotani's right-hand man Tsukahara, is killed after unsuccessfully asking Tsukahara to negotiate in Hirotani's place. Kuno is then recalled to defuse the situation, and he manages to infiltrate the hotel, rescue Yoshihura, and subdue Hirotani after the hotel is tear- gassed. Kuno then arranges a deal with Kaida in exchange for Hirotani: the Kawade family will be disbanded, Hirotani and Tsukahara will be given light prison sentences, and Kaida will admit that Kuno's way to deal with the gangs was the right way. If he refuses, he will leave and threaten to expose the corrupt officers in the police force, himself included. Kaida accepts the deal and Hirotani has his men surrender themselves and their weapons. As they give themselves up, Hirotani asks Kuno to remove his cuffs, and he obliges. After he is led out, Hirotani breaks free and attempts to take Kaida hostage with Tsukahara. After a tense standoff, Kuno pulls out his pistol and shoots Hirotani several times, killing him. An epilogue states that Kaida resigned from the force two years later and took up a position with Nikko Oil. Kuno meanwhile had been transferred to another city as a patrolman. One night after the end of his shift, he comes upon a crashed car at the exit of a tunnel whilst being followed by a truck. When the truck catches up with him and refuses to obey his signals, it runs over and kills him.

He has authored four popular science books, \\"Moodswing\\", \\"Bipolar II\\", \\"Prozac\\" and \\"Bipolar Breakthrough\\". Fieve received his medical degree from Harvard Medical School and started his residency in internal medicine at Cornell's New York Hospital before switching after a year to New York State Psychiatric Institute/Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. However he did not find the psychoanalytic approach useful for his patients. He was advised by his department head Lawrence Kolb to investigate reports coming out of Denmark and Australia about lithium (starting with John Cade). Fieve and colleagues conducted the first controlled trial of Lithium for depression (published in 1968), which had an impact despite its limitations, and he set up the first lithium clinic in North America in 1966.Mania: A Short History of Bipolar Disorder David Healy, JHU Press, 29 Dec 2010 He also worked with the chemical rubidium for ten years. Fieve notes that when he presented his lithium findings along with Ralph Wharton in 1966, it drew a lot of attention from the American public as it seemed to be the first medication that specifically treated a specific psychiatric disorder. In the same year he was appointed to a lithium taskforce convened by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and their conclusions resulted in the FDA approving lithium for mania in 1970.Lithium: From Introduction to Public Awareness. Ronald R. Fieve Pg 258 to 260, The Triumph of Psychopharmacology and the story of CINP (International College of Neuropsychopharmacology) In the 1970s Fieve appeared on numerous national TV talk shows extolling the virtues of lithium for 'manic depression', along with former patient and famous playwright Joshua Logan. 'Moodswing' was published in 1975 and by 1980 the English language version alone had sold over a million copies.Blaming the Brain: The Truth About Drugs and Mental Health Pg 49-51. Elliot Valenstein, Simon and Schuster, 1 Feb 2002 Psychiatrist Nassir Ghaemi has said the book \\"introduced America to BD and lithium\\" and that 30 years later 'Bipolar II' has been among the first to \\"introduce the bipolar spectrum concept to the public\\".Bipolar II: Book Review March 01, 2007  By S. Nassir Ghaemi Also in the 1970s Fieve, Joseph L. Fleiss and David L. Dunner were instrumental in drawing attention to the concepts of 'hypomania' (lower intensity mania) and the related diagnosis of Bipolar II disorder. They published an influential article in 1976, though Fieve credits the term 'Bipolar II' to Dunner and colleagues while at the NIMH in the early 70s before their work together in New York. Fieve and Dunner then coined the term 'rapid cycling', published in 1974, for those patients with more than four mood changes per year which seemed to correlate with failure to respond therapeutically to lithium. These concepts have been reflected in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) since the 1990s.Bipolar Depression: Molecular Neurobiology, Clinical Diagnosis and Pharmacotherapy Carlos A.

Heleneberg by Pehr Hillestr√∂m. Carl Michael Bellman welcomes Helena Quiding to Heleneberg the 31 July 1792. Helena Quiding (19 August 1755 ‚Äì 2 October 1819) was a Swedish culture personality and creator of Sommarvillan (also known as Sommarn√∂jet and during the 18th century as Heleneberg), a historic building at Lilla Skuggan in Djurg√•rden, Stockholm. She was a friend of Swedish poet Carl Michael Bellman, and she and circle of friends at her summer house, then known as Heleneberg, is frequently mentioned in Bellman's poems and songs. Life Quiding was the daughter of the wealthy br√§nnvinmerchant Johan Henric Lindberg (1719‚Äì1777) and his wife Helena Berg (1729‚Äì1788). Her parents were wealthy and owned real estate on Drottninggatan and Fredsgatan in the centre of Stockholm. She married in 1776 to the spicemerchant Bengt Christopher Quiding (1746‚Äì1797), and had a son, Bernhard Christopher (1778‚Äì1846). The marriage was happy, but her spouse wasted her dowry and the fortune she inherited after her father and apparently persuaded her to forge her rich mother's name to be able to borrow more money, before he went bankrupt and fled the country in 1781, being sentenced in absentia in 1783.Bystr√∂m, Olof: Med Bellman p√• Haga och Djurg√•rden. Heleneberg, fru Quiding och Fiskartorpet. 1966 As a married woman, Quiding was legally a minor and was not charged for the forgery, but she was obliged to give up all property to the creditors and settle with her son in the home of her mother. In 1788, she inherited a second fortune after her mother and filed for a divorce, and in January 1789, she was formally divorced from her spouse. In 1790, the year after her divorce, she spent a fortune by having the summer villa Heleneberg built at Djurg√•rden, where she engaged in gardening and entertained culture personalities such as Bellman during the summers for a decade. Helena Quding and her circle at Heleneberg was the object of many of the poems of Bellman, such as the Djurg√•rdspastoralerna (Djurg√•rden pastorals). It is not known when she and Bellman became acquainted, but they were friends by the time of her divorce proceedings in 1788, and he often celebrated her with poems the following years, such as at the inauguration of Heleneberg. She is described as beautiful, warmhearted but serious, and her life at Heleneberg as idyllic. Apparently, Bellman unsuccessfully attempted to court her at one point, and it is likely that she gave him financial support from time to time. The summers at Heleneberg ended in 1800, after several years of lawsuits with her neighbor Abraham Niclas Edelcrantz, who questioned her rights to the grounds, when she sold it and started to rent a cottage to spend her summers instead.

On a promontory which was previously known as Roslagsudden, it was developed in the late 18th century by Helena Quiding, who spent summers in the main house, which she called Heleneberg. Quiding was a friend of poet Carl Michael Bellman, and Heleneberg is frequently mentioned in his poems and songs. The main house at Lilla Skuggan was later home to the architects Axel Nystr√∂m and Fredrik Wilhelm Scholander, the artist Julius Kronberg, and the financier Ivar Kreuger, who also owned the nearby Villa Ugglebo, a house which was built in the late 19th century by the architect Ferdinand Boberg and his wife, the artist Anna Boberg, and after them was the summer residence of the crown prince, the later King Gustaf VI Adolf. Lilla Skuggen is included in the Royal National City Park, and includes three houses, all of which are historic monuments, and a boathouse. History The headland was originally the site of a gate in the fence enclosing the royal park which gave its name to Djurg√•rden; in winter a road led across the ice- covered Lilla V√§rtan from there to Roslagen and Bogesundslandet. A royal huntsman lived there and guarded the gate. In 1788 the king's secretary, Johan Platin, received permission to build a summer residence near the beach there, with the royal huntsman Olof Bures having the right to use some rooms in the winter half of the year. The property was to revert to the Crown without compensation after 25 years.Bystr√∂m, p. 51. Helena Quiding's house Heleneberg on 31 July 1792, by Pehr Hillestr√∂m; Carl Michael Bellman sits on the front steps greeting her with music on her name day. In 1790 Helena Quiding took over the house, naming it Heleneberg for her mother's maiden name, Helene Berg. She had inherited considerable wealth and, calling the existing property \\"so miserable, hemmed about with trees and rock-strewn that it could not be put to any purpose\\", had the house remodelled for 1,300 riksdaler. A wash drawing by Pehr Hillestr√∂m shows the remodelled house in 1792 as a two-storey wooden, plastered building with a split hipped roof. The grounds were cleared of rocks and trees, making them \\"both useful and neat\\", in the words of Johan Gabriel Oxenstierna. Quiding continued to rebuild and add to the house over the years, so that the original building probably remained only as its core.Bystr√∂m, p. 52. Carl Michael Bellman was one of Quiding's friends and wrote poetry about her and his visits to Heleneberg; she and the house are said to have inspired many of his so-called \\"Djurg√•rd pastorales\\". For ten years Quiding spent her summers at Heleneberg, living in the winter in her parents' large house in Drottninggatan, which she had inherited in 1790. However she then transferred ownership of the Lilla Skuggan house to Lovisa C. Sch√∂nherr, the widow of a silk manufacturer. Abraham Niclas Edelcrantz, who lived nearby at Stora Skuggan, claimed a hundred-year lease on Lilla Skuggan and Quiding gave up on reaching an agreement with him.Bystr√∂m, p. 69. Edelcrantz, who was King Gustav III's private secretary and handled the Crown's petty cash, supposedly used to say to colleagues concerning bills, which it was not felt to be urgent to pay, \\"We'll put this in the shadows\\" (), the source of the names Lilla Skuggan (little shadows) and Stora Skuggan (big shadows). Julius Kronberg's studio, now at Skansen In the second half of the 19th century, the house at Lille Skuggan was the summer residence first of the architect Axel Nystr√∂m, and then of his fellow architect Fredrik Wilhelm Scholander. Scholander's daughter Ellen married the artist Julius Kronberg, who became a permanent resident of Lilla Skuggen and had a studio built there in 1889 to his own design; it was completed in 1912 by the architect Jacob J:son Gate. A ceiling painting in the main house dates to Kronberg's residence there. Kronberg became known for his monumental works at Stockholm Palace and Hallwyl House, among others; after his death in 1921, Countess Wilhelmina von Hallwyl bought the studio and all its furnishings and donated it to the open- air museum at Skansen. A photograph of the interior is on the cover of ABBA's album The Visitors. Another daughter of Scholander, Anna, married the architect Ferdinand Boberg. She was a successful artist herself and in the 1890s the Bobergs became neighbours of the Kronbergs: they built a house in the north of Lilla Skuggan, on the shore of Lilla V√§rtan, which they called Ugglebo. When they acquired Vintra in South Djurg√•rden, they sold Ugglebo to the then crown prince, later King Gustaf VI Adolf, who used it as a summer residence until 1919. That year the financier Ivar Kreuger bought Ugglebo as well as the rest of Lilla Skuggen; under his ownership the buildings acquired substantially the appearance they have today. In 1940 Count Fabian Wrede and his wife Elsa became the new owners of Lille Skuggan; they later transferred possession to their daughter Agneta, who was married to Lars Evers. When she died in 1984, their children Henrik Evers and Christina Rang√∂ inherited the property. In August 2012 it was put up for sale, with the expressed wish that the houses not be sold separately. Area and buildings today Lilla Skuggan is reached by Lilla Skuggans v√§g, which runs past the now drained lake called Lillsj√∂n. Stora Skuggan is to the west of it, Fisksj√∂√§ng to the south, and Lappk√§rrsberget to the north. The oldest building in the Royal National City Park, Charles XI's fishing hut, dating to the 1680s, is nearby in Fiskartorpet. The boathouse is down at the lakeside. The other three buildings, all on the historic register, all have wood-panelled walls painted yellow with green details. There is also a small gazebo.

Life and music Sant√≥rsola was born in Italy and his family settled in S√£o Paulo, Brazil, in 1909. After receiving initial musical instruction from his father, Enrico, he soon entered the Conservat√≥rio Dram√°tico e Musical de S√£o Paulo studying violin with Zaccaria Autuori, and counterpoint, harmony and composition with Agostino Cant√π and Lamberto Baldi. He went to Europe to study violin with Gaetano Fusella (1876‚Äì1973) in Naples and Alfred Mistowski (1872‚Äì1964) at Trinity College, London. Returning to Brazil in 1925, he founded the Brazilian Musical Institute, and was violist of the Paulista Quartet and the Rio de Janeiro Teatro Municipal Orchestra. Subsequently, he was professor of violin, viola and harmony at the Conservat√≥rio Dram√°tico e Musical de S√£o Paulo before settling in Montevideo in 1931. Italian maestro Lamberto Baldi, director of the Orquesta Sinf√≥nica del SODRE, invited Sant√≥rsola to be first violist of his orchestra and also perform with the SODRE Chamber Ensemble. Sant√≥rsola later founded and conducted the orchestras of the Sociedad de Cultura Art√≠stica Uruguaya and the Instituto Cultural Brasil-Uruguay, was violist in the Kleiber Quartet, and was professor at the Instituto de Estudios Superiores of the Escuela Normal de M√∫sica of Montevideo. Sant√≥rsola composed a large body of work that distinctly exhibits melodic and rhythmic energy of Latin America. His musical style was initially influenced by his interest in Baroque counterpoint, Brazilian and Uruguayan folk music, and later twelve-tone serialism. He wrote orchestral and vocal works, concertos, chamber and instrumental music, notably his numerous compositions for classical guitar. Sant√≥rsola's pupils included the composer Amelia Repetto.

It stands east of Askrigg, overlooking pastures leading down to the River Ure. A single-storey central hall sits between two towers, a four-storey western tower and a two-storey eastern tower. The four-storey tower has a turret, lit by slit vents, for a spiral staircase that climbs to crenellated parapets. The taller tower retains its original windows, but sash windows were inserted in the 18th century in the lower two-storey block which housed the kitchen and service rooms, at the opposite end of the hall. In the 17th century, an extra wing was added. Nappa Hall is a Grade I listed building. Descent  The place name Nappa, first mentioned in about 1251 as Nappay, is of uncertain origin, but possibly derives from the Old English hn√¶pp ƒ°eh√¶ƒ°, meaning \\"enclosure in a bowl-shaped hollow\\". =Scrope= The manor of Nappa was originally part of the manor of Askrigg in the North Riding of Yorkshire, but by the late 13th century was a separate estate. It was owned by the Scrope family for some generations, but in the late 14th century Richard le Scrope, 1st Baron Scrope of Bolton granted the estate to James Metcalfe (d. circa 1472) of Worton =Metcalfe= canting arms of Metcalfe: Argent, three calves sable Nappa remained the seat of the Metcalfe family for many centuries. The descent was as follows: *James Metcalfe (d. circa 1472) of Worton, acquired Nappa from Richard le Scrope, 1st Baron Scrope of Bolton; *Thomas Metcalfe, second but eldest surviving son, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, who built the surviving house. A Yorkist, he sued King Henry VII for a special pardon on his accession. He became surveyor of Middleham Castle and by leasing estates in the lordship greatly increased his wealth. *James Metcalfe (d.1539), son and heir, who held his father's offices in Wensleydale and purchased further adjoining estates; *Christopher Metcalfe (d.1574), son and heir, Sheriff of Yorkshire in 1555, Forester of Wensleydale, Parker of Woodhall and Wanless, and supervisor of Middleham. Soon after his succession John Lord Scrope of Bolton challenged the original grant to James Metcalfe. After prolonged litigation, including secondary proceedings against Christopher for bribing a jury, the verdict seems to have been given in favour of Lord Scrope; he consented, however, to exchange the manor of Healey for Nappa. As Sheriff of Yorkshire in 1555 Christopher received the justices attended by 300 horsemen of his name and kin. From this date, however, his fortunes declined, and he was forced to sell various portions of his estates. There is a legend that Mary Queen of Scots stayed there for two nights in 1568 while under house arrest at Bolton Castle and that James I visited the house. In the 16th century John Leland described it as \\"a very goodly Howse\\". *James Metcalfe, eldest son and heir, who died a few years later. *Thomas Metcalfe (d.1655), son and heir, inherited as an infant aged five months. During his minority Nappa was let to two 'principal and dangerous Recusants' who were purposed 'to live obscurely.' Thomas when of age was forced to mortgage portions of his estate, and finally Nappa itself; afterwards recovering the manor, he settled it on himself in tail-male. He had lead mines on Askrigg Common. *James Metcalfe (d.1671), eldest son and heir, who divided Nappa Hall with his brother Thomas Metcalfe. In 1663 James paid the tax for six hearths and Thomas for five. He died without male issue. *Thomas Metcalfe (d.1684), younger brother; *Henry Metcalfe (d.1705), only surviving brother, who settled the manor in tail-male on his son Thomas Metcalfe, 'the hopeful heir to the old ruinous house at Nappa.' *Thomas Metcalfe, son and heir, last of the Metcalfes of Nappa, who was forced by financial trouble to settle the reversion of Nappa on his kinsman, Thomas Weddell of Earswick. =Weddell, Elcock= Thomas Weddell of Earswick, inherited Nappa from his kinsman Thomas Metcalfe. He bequeathed his right to his nephew Richard Elcock, on condition he should adopt the surname Weddell, with remainder to Thomas Robinson, 2nd Baron Grantham. The Weddells of Newby Hall made some improvements. William Weddell (1736-1792) adapted Nappa Hall as a hunting lodge, and added a stable and coach house. =Robinson= *Thomas Robinson, 2nd Baron Grantham, inherited Nappa from Weddell family; *Thomas de Grey, 2nd Earl de Grey, eldest son and heir. He was born as Thomas Philip Robinson, his surname was Weddell from 1803 and de Grey from 1833. His younger brother was Frederick John Robinson, 1st Viscount Goderich, 1st Earl of Ripon (1782‚Äì1859), Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. Thomas de Grey died without surviving male issue, leaving his two daughters as co-heiresses. =Vyner= Lady Mary Gertrude Weddell, daughter and one of the co-heiresses of Thomas de Grey, 2nd Earl de Grey, inherited Nappa as her portion. She married Captain H. Vyner, and was lady of the manor until 1892. =Metcalfe (return)= The Metcalfes moved back in 1889, first as tenants and in 1930 as owners. William Metcalfe sold the house in 2008. The new owners have put forward plans to restore the house.

She was active in social work and community projects, and was well known for advocacy for the preservation of burial mounds constructed by the North American Mound Builders at Sheboygan Indian Mound Park. Biography Julilly House was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, on October 18, 1908, the only child of William Henry House and Mary Lilly Waller. The family moved to Morganfield, Kentucky, and then to Evansville, Indiana, where Kohler spent most of her early years, graduating from Central High School in 1926. She then attended Wellesley College, graduating in 1930 with a degree in French literature. Kohler was a member of Theta Sigma Phi, a national fraternity for women in journalism. While she was working in Chicago at Marshall Field & Co, she met John Michael Kohler III, who was at the time assigned as manager of the Kohler Company's Chicago branch office. John Kohler was the son of Walter J. Kohler, Sr.. They were married on January 7, 1933. The couple resided in the Chicago area until Mr. Kohler was transferred to the Kohler Company home offices in 1937. In 1948 they purchased Riverbend, the Tudor estate in Kohler originally built by Mr. Kohler's father, Gov, Walter J. Kohler Sr. The estate is currently a private resort operated as part of the Kohler Experience. The couple had four children: John Michael Kohler IV (1935‚Äì), William Collin Kohler (1937‚Äì), Julilly Waller Kohler (1942‚Äì), and Marie House Kohler (1951‚Äì). Writing career Kohler began her writing career as a hobby, beginning with children's stories that were published in Story Parade, Child Life, and Jack and Jill and gained notability for publication of the children's books, Farmer Collins and Football Trees in the 1940s. She also made contributions to adult magazines like McCall's, Vogue, and Library Journal. Julilly Kohler achieved a degree of national prominence through her writing, particularly as the author of 10 children's books and two non-fiction books. Her best known book was The Boy Who Stole The Elephant. Walt Disney Productions purchased rights to the book and adapted it to television in two one-hour shows on the Walt Disney Hour in 1970. Many of her stories were drawn from experiences of her Kentucky childhood. Social and philanthropic work In 1954 she was elected an alumnae trustee of Wellesley College at Wellesley, Massachusetts, and served on the board for a six-year term. Her Wellesley association involved invitations to be a visiting observer of classes and administration. In 1956 she co-founded the Town and Country Garden Club based in Sheboygan, Wisconsin. One of her early community activities was organizing and producing a radio quiz show program, Readers Roundup, under the American Association of University Women, which was designed to encourage reading by young people. She was active with the Sheboygan Community Players, both as a performer and board member. Kletzien Mound Group near Sheboygan, Wisconsin In 1967, she organized and led a campaign to preserve the historic Indian mounds, south of Sheboygan, which resulted in the site being designated as Sheboygan Indian Mound Park. In 1968 Kohler was the registered agent for the incorporation of the Sheboygan Indian Mound Park Association, Inc. In 1981, the site was added to the National Register of Historic Places. In recognition of that work, she was awarded the Sears Roebuck National Civic Improvement Medal presented by the National Council of State Garden Clubs. After her husband died in 1968, Mrs. Kohler was asked to take his place as an active trustee of Ripon College, serving in that capacity for five years from 1968 until 1975. In addition, she was appointed to the visiting committee of Harvard University's Department of Anthropology. Other recognitions included the City of Milwaukee Award of Merit and the first annual Civic Development Award from the Sheboygan Area Garden Clubs.

Originally applied to the refining of iron into steel, with most installations in the 1960s, the process is (2014) used primarily to refine non ferrous metals, typically copper. In that field, it is often named TBRC, or Top Blown Rotary Converter. History and description =Steel production= Evolution of chemical composition and temperature of the liquid steel, during the blowing in a Kaldo converter. The iron content is linked with the slag composition, the others elements are taken in the metal. The name \\"Kaldo\\" is derived from Prof. Bo Kalling, and from the Domnarvets Jernverk (Stora Kopparbergs Bergslag subsidiary) both key in the development of the process. Research into the use of a stirring to promote mixing, and therefor rate of conversion was investigated from the 1940s, and investigations into the use of oxygen began c.1948. The feedstock at the Domnarvet works had a phosphorus content of 1.8-2.0% and so the process was developed with one aim being dephosphorisation. The first production unit was installed in 1954 at Domnarvet Jernverk. The converter was a top blow oxygen converter, similar to Linz-Donawitz type, using a cylindrical vessel; the vessel was tilted whilst conversion took place, with typical rotation speeds of around 30 revolutions per minute; the oxygen was injected via a lance, with slag forming materials added separately. Kaldo converters were relatively common in the 1960s in the United Kingdom, during the transition from predominately open hearth process steelmaking to oxygen based steelmaking techniques. Converters were installed at Consett steelworks, Park Gate, Rotherham, Shelton works, Stoke-on-Trent; and Stanton Iron Works. Before the advent of the basic-LD process the Kaldo method was a preferred one in the UK for converting high phosphorus iron. The first unit in the UK was at Park Gate Works, Rotherham. In the USA the process was installed at the Sharon Steel Corporation (c.1962). A plant in Japan was installed for Sanyo Special Steel Co. (Himejii) in c.1965. A combined type of converter (LD-Kaldo), using elements of the Linz-Donawitz and Kaldo processes was installed 1965 in Belgium at Cockerill-Ougr√©e-Providence's plant in Marchienne-au-Pont as a multicompany research venture. In France, one Kaldo furnace was also installed (one 160t unit, 1960) at Sollac's . It was followed in 1969 by two huge 240t units, the biggest Kaldo converters never built (two times bigger than the previous bigger ones : 1000t rotating at 30 r.p.m. !), at Wendel-Sidelor's (later Usinor-Sacilor) (Lorraine, France); these two converters did not meet expectations and the third additional planned Kaldo unit was not installed, instead two OLP (oxyg√®ne-lance-poudre) 240t units were used. Disadvantages of the process, compared to non-rotating oxygen furnaces (e.g. LD type) were the higher capital cost, more difficult to upscale to higher outputs, and additional complexity (i.e. rotating parts and loading thereof). Advantages included the ability to use a high proportion of scrap metal, and good controllability of final steel specification. At the Park Gate works conversion time was 90 minutes, with up to 45% scrap loading, with a capacity of 75t in a 500t total, diameter converter, with a rotation speed of 40 revs per minute. Due to high maintenance costs the Kaldo converter did not gain widespread usage in the steel industry, with non-rotating converters being preferred. =Non-ferrous production= Nickel matte was converted by Inco (Canada) in a pilot Kaldo converter in 1959, and Metallo-Chimique (Belgium) developed secondary copper smelting using the Kaldo type converters in the late 1960s. The Kaldo type converted is commonly known as a Top-Blown Rotary Converter (TBRC) in non-ferrous metal smelting terminology. By the 1970s the Kaldo furnace was in common use for copper and nickel smelting. A Kaldo converter for the smelting of lead was constructed by Boliden in Sweden in 1976. Kaldo secondary copper units were still in use worldwide at the beginning of the 21st century, but as of 2011 no new units had been commissioned for around 10 years, suggesting that the process had been superseded.

An ensemble, coming-of-age piece, the film follows a group of young members of a South Carolina Baptist church as they confront issues of homosexuality and a crisis of faith. Plot Brea (Molly Kunz), Laura (Allison Torem), and Tim (Tyler Ross) are three high school seniors and close friends connected by their South Carolina Baptist church. As they prepare for life after graduation, Brea begins to have doubts about her beliefs, creating a rift between her and the devoutly religious Laura. Likewise, Tim begins to confront feelings of homosexuality, much to Laura's dismay. Brea's doubts about her faith continue to grow as she researches contradictions in the Bible. She befriends an outcast named Cheryl (Sadie Rogers), the granddaughter of a longtime congregation member, Ms. Powell. Cheryl confesses to Brea that she is a nonbeliever, further prompting Brea's curiosity and disbelief. Meanwhile, Elizabeth (Sadieh Rifai), a fellow congregation member, is suffering from a lack of intimacy with her husband Austin (Stephen Cone), the church's music director. Austin begins to confront his own feelings of homosexuality, even privately exchanging an awkward kiss with Tim during a house party. Elizabeth continues to struggle with her husband's lack of intimacy and embarrasses herself at a party after flirting with the church's married prospective youth director Dylan (Cliff Chamberlain). Austin and Elizabeth later go out on their anniversary and get drunk. Afterward, despite his best effort, Austin is still unable to perform sexually for his wife. Tim eventually comes out to his single father Jerry (Matt DeCaro), who is accepting‚Äîif initially apprehensive‚Äîof his son's sexuality. Tim's younger brother Brad (Jacob Leinbach) does not take the news as well, but Jerry advises Tim to give Brad some time to process it. Tim and Brea then take Cheryl out to a dance club, where Tim further explores his sexuality by passionately dancing with a stranger. Laura starts feeling increasingly alienated from Tim and Brea, which is only further complicated when Tim and Brea are accepted into New York University. Feeling her once close relationship with Tim and Brea fading away, she tries to befriend April (Alyssa Puckett) over a tense lunch date where she is introduced to Patrick, April's cousin. Laura, Brea, and Tim hang out for a final time before they head off to college. Laura then makes a final, impassioned plea for Brea to remain true to her faith. The film then picks up after the three friends return home from their first semester at college. Laura is now dating Patrick while Tim and Brea are even closer than before. Jerry reaches out to Tim, asking him if he has met anyone at school. In turn, Tim suggests that his dad start looking for someone to date, too. Later that evening, Austin comes to Tim and confesses that he might be gay. Tim says that he is too and Austin cries on his shoulder. The film concludes as the congregation members gather at the church's living nativity. Austin mouths the words \\"I love you\\" to Elizabeth and she mouths back \\"I love you, too.\\" Cast Production To raise money for production, the film's writer and director Stephen Cone ran a Kickstarter campaign with a goal of $17,500. The campaign closed on July 18, 2010, having successfully raised $17,830. The film was shot on location in Cone's hometown of Charleston, South Carolina. Cone, the son of a Baptist minister, described elements of the film as semi- autobiographical, saying that he \\"experienced some of it, and some of it is speculation and curiosity, wondering about people [he] grew up with.\\" Release The Wise Kids was given its world premiere at the Outfest film festival in Los Angeles, California on July 9, 2011. It was later shown at the LGBT NewFest in New York, New York on July 23, 2011. The film also opened the 30th annual Reeling Gay and Lesbian Film Festival. It was played premiered in Charleston on November 19, 2011. =Home media= The film was distributed by Wolfe Video who released the film on DVD January 8, 2013. Reception =Critical response= The Wise Kids received a very positive response from critics. The film holds a 100% positive \\"Fresh\\" rating on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 3 out of 4 stars and described its handling of the subject matter as \\"honest, observant, and subtle.\\" Robert Koehler of Variety called the performers \\"a brilliant cast of young actors\\" and said of the film, \\"Most impressively, this is an ensemble piece in which no boogeymen are permitted, everyone is observed in shades of gray, and the easy out of making fun of true believers is simply not in the cards.\\" Stephen Holden of The New York Times praised the film as \\"... a guileless exploration of the growing pains of sheltered innocents whose reticence and sincerity evoke 1950s small-town values\\" and added, \\"The performances all capture the perplexity of sexually repressed people who are trying to do the proper Christian thing while coping with unruly desires that they recognize as challenges to their way of life. In its unassuming way, this tiny, low-budget film is a universal reflection on issues of personal identity and choice for which there are no easy answers.\\" Melissa Anderson of The Village Voice was slightly more critical, commenting, \\"The Wise Kids suffers from a theater workshop-y tendency to rest too long on pauses and silences to convey dramatic heft. But the blunder is ultimately overshadowed by Cone's excellent young actors, particularly Torem, burrowing deeply into her character's zealotry and anguish about being left behind.\\" =Accolades= The Wise Kids was selected as a Critics' Pick for The New York Times.

Born in Singapore in 1963, she grew up in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Achnas graduated from the Faculty of Film and Television at the Jakarta Institute of the Arts. She also completed a master's degree in Film Studies at the University of East Anglia in 1996 where she was a Chevening Scholar. While graduating from the University of East Anglia, she directed a film entitled The Only Day (1988) as her diploma film. It won the Grand Prix at the Asian Young Cinema Film Festival in Tokyo. When she is not directing films, Achnas' teaches film at the Jakarta Institute of the Arts which is the main film school in Indonesia.  Career  Achnas first got noticed in 1995 with her short film The Little Gayo Singer. She went forward to direct 5 other films, one of which she also undertook the role of producer (Bendera, 2002). Nan Achnas, together with Mira Lesmana, an independent producer and director, were actively part of a self-aware film movement regarding the participation of women in film. The movement began through the experimental film, Kuldesak (1998), which they collectively produced near the beginning of Achnas' career. Achnas, along with other female Indonesian filmmakers, finds it difficult to increase the participation of women in both the political and social realms of life and work to promote gender politics in Indonesia. When asked about facing discrimination as a woman filmmaker, Achnas says: > \\"Everybody is asking, 'Do you have a problem being a women filmmaker?' And I > say: 'No, should I?' Apparently, there is this brand of feminism saying, 'Do > you know why you do not have a problem? Because you are still ... because > the system is still not at the stage where men dominate. But when men > dominate an industry then you will have problems.' Then I say, 'So far as > you know, we are talking about a vacuum of 10 years, where nobody made films > and now most of the decision-makers are women.' So there has been no > discrimination, nothing.\\" (2013) When speaking about the difficulties in filmmaking, Achnas claims: ‚ÄúYou just have to have staying power and obsession, almost a fixation.‚Äù She also has spoken about government funding and the lack thereof in Indonesia. Achnas says: > ‚ÄúIn countries like South Korea, like Iran, there‚Äôs always some money from > the government to make films that are not really for the mainstream market. > That is not available here (Indonesia). I make films not purely for the > mainstream market (so) I get my funding outside.‚Äù When speaking about making films in Indonesia, she claims ‚ÄúIndonesia is different because we don‚Äôt have an Indonesian diaspora, compared with the Indian or the Chinese.‚Äù In terms of the filmmaking world, Achnas is not surprised by the recycling process that is constantly seen in films. She states that, ‚ÄúIt was the romantic teenage drama and then the horror genre came and now it's the comedies, and I predict it's probably the erotic films next because history repeats it- self.‚Äù Achnas' admits being against anti- pornography law. This statement was made in regards to the Bill against Pornography and Pornoaction that was passed in Indonesia in 2008. = Themes and style = Achnas is often regarded as the first woman filmmaker from Indonesia to have a feminist perspective, while many of her films concentrate on the problems of women in Indonesian society. Achnas' films tend to challenge the New Order's gender regime that is prevalent in Indonesia. Her father was a feminist who she often credits for the distinct feminist ideology in her films. The narratives within her films are often formed using a female voyeurism and gaze. Particularly, Achnas‚Äô films feature little sex or violence.

Behind are Changtse and Everest's West Ridge The Lho La is a col on the border between Nepal and Tibet north of the Western Cwm, near Mount Everest. It is at the lowest point of the West Ridge of the mountain at a height of . History and name Lho La (middle left) Historically, the col was used as a pass over the lowest point of Everest's West Ridge for traders between Nepal and Tibet on the route between Namche Bazaar and Tingri at a time when Everest's glaciers were much higher than at present and traversing the col involved less steep climbing. However, as the glaciers declined the favoured trade route became the Nangpa La, to the west. Following the 1952 Swiss Mount Everest expedition it was suggested that \\"Lho La\\" (South Pass) was an unsatisfactory name because it lies to the west of Everest and it would better be renamed \\"Khumbu La\\" because it led up from the Khumbu Glacier. This would allow the South Col to be called \\"Lho La\\" as it is the col south of Everest and between it and Lhotse. Unfortunately the Nangpa La had been called the Khumbu La in the past and was still sometimes being called by that name. British sentiment was against the proposed name changes and the new names never stuck. Approach from Tibet Sketch map of Everest region, showing Lho La 5 km west of the summit The first western explorers to discover the col were George Mallory and Guy Bullock on the 1921 British Mount Everest reconnaissance expedition although it was only Bullock who actually reached it. They were exploring the West Rongbuk Glacier in Tibet hoping it might give access to a route for reaching the summit of Everest. They named it \\"Lho La\\", meaning \\"South Pass\\" simply because it was to the south of where they were. This rather self-centred decision was to give difficulties later, as mentioned above. Lho La gave access to Everest's West Ridge and to its Western Cwm but they thought neither of these gave feasible ways of ascent. Lho La was also investigated by Bill Tilman and Edmund Wigram on the 1935 British Mount Everest reconnaissance expedition but, like the 1921 explorers, they also preferred the North Col route for a summit attempt. Approach from Nepal Everest, Southwest Face. Khumbu Glacier's Ice Fall is bottom left with Lho La above and the snowfield of the Rongbuk Glacier (middle left) behind the col. The West Ridge slopes diagonally from Lho La over the West Shoulder to the summit. By 1951 China's occupation of Tibet and the opening of Nepal to foreigners meant that Everest was only accessible from the south. A Dane, Klavs Becker-Larsen travelled to Khumbu with the intention of entering Tibet secretly and attempting the North Col route. His attempts to cross the frontier by climbing the Lho La were unsuccessful and he had to retreat. A British reconnaissance in 1951 assessed the route through the Khumbu Icefall to the Western Cwm, hence by-passing Lho La, and in subsequent years this was the line that was followed, so leading to the South Col and the Southeast Ridge. The successful ascent of Everest in 1963 by Americans Tom Hornbein and Willi Unsoeld via the West Ridge and the Hornbein Couloir was achieved by climbing from the Western Cwm to the West Shoulder, well east of the Lho La. After unsuccessful attempts in 1974 and 1978, the first time Everest was climbed via the Lho La was in 1979 when a Yugoslavian team ascended the West Ridge from there (without diverting onto the Hornbein Couloir). Led by Tone Skarja, a team of 40 put fixed ropes up from on the Khumbu Glacier and used a hand winch for 200 metres to lift 6 tons of equipment. They assessed the climbing grade as between II and III, and on the upper as between IV and V, claiming this to be the highest grade V climb in the world. In 1989 five out of six climbers in a Polish team, attempting a descent that involved climbing Khumbutse from the West Rongbuk Glacier via Lho La, were swept to their deaths on the Lho La itself as they climbed above the col, with one survivor Andrzej Marciniak.

Hall (1913) \\"Scientific Theology\\", The Monist 23(1): 90 to 101Paul Carus (1913) \\"Theonomy\\", The Monist 23(1): 137 to 45 at a meeting December 3, 1910. The following March 4th the BCAS met at his home-office at 1301 Davie Street in Vancouver‚Äôs West End. Hall was elected Vice President for 1911-12. He spoke on \\"A Theory of Electromagnetism\\" on November 18 at the McGill University College. Hall was elected President of BCAS on April 13, 1912. In 1913 he was also President, with Charles Hill-Tout of Abbotsford Vice President. The following year Hall served as Secretary-Treasurer while Hill- Tout was President. That year BCAS published seven papers assembled in a book, two by Hall, including \\"Scientific Theology\\". The other was \\"A Geometric Vector Algebra\\", which included quaternions.Frank L. Hitchcock (1914) Review: A Geometric Vector Algebra, Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society 21(8):415,6 In 1916 Hall was official Librarian of BCAS, and he spoke at the December meeting: \\"A scientific musical scale\\". That year BCAS acted as host for an excursion to the Point Grey lands destined to become the UBC campus. The BCAS minutes contain a clipping from a published report describing Professor Klinck‚Äôs preparatory work on campus. BCAS also began the Vancouver Institute lecture series that has supplemented continuing education for adults in the city. On April 20, 1917, Hall spoke on \\"Sodium thio-silicate beads in blowpipe analysis\\". He remained Librarian until 1920, when he was also simultaneously Vice President and Auditor. He continued as Auditor until 1923 when he reported on \\"The Electronic Reactions of Abrams\\", a controversial topic. The November 26 meeting passed a resolution that speakers should henceforth make a disclaimer that their remarks are not to be understood to be endorsed by BCAS. As UBC had by then been established, and the sciences were therefore at home in the Province, some members of BCAS began to question its purpose in 1925. But the Academy carried on, and in 1947 initiated a series of Science Conferences at which the work of high school students was featured. This series continued until 1961 when the fifteenth and last one was held. BCAS was disbanded in 1963.

He led a \\"hunger march\\", fasted outside Windsor Castle, and created an artist's colony near Regent's Park. Early life Alexander Stewart Gray (known as Stewart) was the fifth of eleven children of William Gray (1829‚Äì1909) and Helen Marshall Stewart (1835‚Äì1904), who were tenant farmers at Brownrigg Farm, North Berwick, East Lothian. His mother had her own income, but spent most of it on the children's education. Several of his sisters had good careers. Agnes Grainger Gray (1858-1940) became headmistress of Sandecotes School, Parkstone, Dorset; Jessy MacDonald Stewart Wallace (1867-1937) became an Inspector of Workshops in Islington; Charlotte Jane Andrews (1872-1942) became an established artist of the Scottish Colourist school, and painted alongside Samuel Peploe in France and Spain. The youngest child, Hugh Stewart Gray (1875-1955), married Hilda Orchardson in 1905 (the daughter of the artist Sir William Quiller Orchardson) and became a farmer in South Africa. Alexander Stewart Gray became a solicitor in Edinburgh where he was involved in the flotation of companies on the Stock Market, including the Provost Oats Company, a well-known company at the time. He mismanaged some family finances, and his mother lost all her personal income. He abandoned his work as a solicitor - perhaps being disbarred for embezzlement - and took to politics. Activism In the early 1900s, Gray rejected his middle class existence to campaign against unemployment and poverty. Jack Kahane, who knew him, described Gray in his Memoirs of a Booklegger (1939) as \\"shocked out of a comfortable life by the spectacle of starvation\\", a \\"heroic dreamer\\", and an eccentric who wore a sombrero and had \\"school-boyish and impracticable\\" ideas. Between 1906 and 1910 he achieved a national profile as a political activist and was seldom out of the newspapers for his various campaigns which were reported in detail by The Manchester Guardian and The Times. His activities included the seizure of public land in order for the unemployed to grow vegetables, various public protests and stunts, a hunger strike and a hunger march. Stewart Gray leader of Hunger Marchers. Illustrated London News 10 October 1908, scanned from family album. Gray was the originator of the \\"back-to-the-land movement\\" in the UK.May, Betty. (1929) Tiger Woman: My Story. (2014 reprint) London: Duckworth, pp. 96‚Äì99. The slogans associated with him were \\"Link Idle Land to Idle Labour; Free the Land, and you Free the People; Landlordism is Present-day SLAVERY\\".Contemporary publicity card, n.d. Bridgeman Art Library. 8 Ormonde Terrace Stewart Gray, and wife (centre), appear in William Roberts' The Toe Dancer, 1914. Shortly before the start of the First World War, Gray took over 8 Ormonde Terrace in London, a largish house which overlooks Primrose Hill and is immediately to the north of Regent's Park. Gray is sometimes described as \\"squatting\\" in the house, perhaps because the facilities were so basic that it had the appearance of a squat, but according to Alice Mayes, Gray took a short lease with the help of Augustus John.Cork, Richard. (1974) Vorticism and its Allies: Catalogue of an Exhibition Organised by Richard Cork in Collaboration with the Arts Council of Great Britain, Held at the Hayward Gallery, London, 27 March ‚Äì 2 June 1974. London: Arts Council of Great Britain, p. 85. John's involvement is confirmed in his letters, where he describes the idea of using 8 Ormonde Terrace as a centre for artists as a \\"scheme\\" with a \\"committee\\" of which he was asked to be the leader, a position he refused. John painted a portrait of Gray, entitled \\"Interpretation of Author\\", which was the picture of the year at the Royal Academy. Alice Mayes was a dancer for Kosslov's Ballet Company, and later David Bomberg's first wife, and she and Bomberg were both early inhabitants of the house. Gray was a regular at the Harlequin Club and word quickly got around among the penniless bohemians of London that they could live at Ormonde Terrace for nothing, or almost nothing, and many artists and their models used the house, coming and going as they pleased, and turning it into a form of artist's colony. Betty May and her husband Bunny lived there for six months in 1914 immediately after they married. May recalled in her autobiography Tiger Woman that the house was furnished to the minimum possible standard and that due to Gray's refusal to pay utility bills, the house was without services. Even the water had been cut off. May wrote that \\"The colony was divided into households, but the habit of borrowing resulted in something like what communism ought to be.\\" According to May, Gray wore a beard to disguise the fact that he did not wear a collar, and although he was forced to wear boots around town, which he otherwise would not have done, he went without socks and bootlaces. The sculptor Jacob Epstein attended life drawing classes there and remembered: \\"This refuge was without gas or electric light, so that candles were used, and it seldom had water. No room had a lock, as most of the metal work had been carried away ... Whether Stuart Gray ever received any rent was a question; but the old man, who resembled a Tolstoy gone wrong, would prowl about at night in a godfatherly fashion and look over his young charges.\\"Epstein, Jacob. (1940) Let There Be Sculpture. New York: Putnam, p. 102. The young William Roberts also lived at Ormonde Terrace, and Gray appears twice in Roberts's 1914 drawing The Toe Dancer which, according to the catalogue of Roberts's 1965 Tate Gallery retrospective, was inspired by the dances performed by Gray's wife there. Mrs Gray is the contorted figure in the centre of the drawing.Catalogue quoted at William Roberts: The Toe Dancer. The William Roberts Society. Retrieved 31 August 2014. The Toe Dancer is now in the Victoria and Albert Museum.The Toe Dancer. Victoria and Albert Museum. Retrieved 31 August 2014. In an essay published posthumously, Roberts remembered that \\"At the rear of the house on a level with the first floor landing was a small glass conservatory, that Stuart had filled with hay almost to the roof, on which he slept fully dressed.\\"Roberts, William. (1990) \\"The 'Twenties'\\" in Five Posthumous Essays and Other Writings. Valencia: Artes Graficas Soler. Augustus John described Gray as \\"a dear old humorist with a passion for vegetables\\". Betty May wrote that the First World War broke up the colony but William Roberts remembers a man taking Gray's place and demanding that residents pay rent for the first time, causing at least Bomberg to leave. Family Gray married Aida Forbes, a childhood friend who had often stayed at Brownrigg. He left her soon after the birth of their first child, Agness (Nansie), in 1900. He returned for a short time, but left before the birth of their second child, Dorothea Helen Forbes, in 1905.(Dorothea later became a tutor in Classics at St Hugh's College, Oxford.) Aida Forbes' mother said she would maintain the family provided Aida never saw Stewart again. They were divorced. Jack Kahane reports in his memoir that when he knew Gray during his hunger march days (1906‚Äì10), Gray was separated from his wife who lived in Cannes in \\"luxurious circumstances\\". This \\"wife\\" was presumably a second marriage, or a mistress. It is unclear whether the \\"wife\\" pictured in the William Roberts drawing of 1914, The Toe Dancer, is the same person. Later life View of Wallasea Island. Virginia Nicholson writes that after Ormonde Terrace, Gray lived and painted in Kathleen Hale's basement and converted to spiritualism. Hale had been Augustus John's secretary after moving to London in 1917 and probably met Gray through John. While still in London, Gray would visit the Harlequin Club and offer to draw customers' portraits for pennies. According to Jacob Epstein in Let There be Sculpture, under the guidance of Bomberg, Gray \\"became a painter, gathering his materials where he could and painting on old bits of rag. But he had no talent and finally went off to become \\"king\\" of some Utopian colony on an island where he reared another family.\\" The island was Wallasea, near Burnham-on-Crouch, Essex, where Gray lived in a cottage whose walls and ceilings he had painted with frescoes. His work attracted the attention of Augustus John. Even now, Wallasea is noted for its isolation. Gray died in Ashingdon, near Rochford, Essex, on 13 April 1937.\\"Mr. A.S. Gray\\", The Times, 16 April 1937, p. 16. He was buried in pauper's grave, but the Gray family and others raised money for a tombstone.

Although he was Caucasian, he was reared in the local hill tribe culture. Because his father and brother already worked for the CIA and knew Bill Lair, the Agency knew of his extensive cultural contacts with the Lahu people and other Southeast Asian hill tribes. With command of several Asian languages, he was made a natural recruiter of local guerrillas for the CIA's covert operations in the secret war in the Kingdom of Laos. He was then considered for the position of case officer to Hmong Vang Pao. He was passed over in favor of sending him on an extended reconnaissance of the Kingdom of Laos. His tour ranged westward from his start at Long Tieng--which he reported as well-sited for operations in the Plain of Jars--back to familiar territory in the Golden Triangle. While assigned to paramilitary duty in Nam Yu, Laos, in the Golden Triangle from 1962 to 1967, Young trained a militia army of several thousand hill tribesmen and spied on the People's Republic of China. In time, he clashed with his superiors over the increasing aerial bombing of Laos, and was fired. He spent almost all the rest of his life as a businessman in Chiang Mai, Thailand. Upon occasion, he would work security for an oil company in Sudan, or consult for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. Plagued by ill-health in his later years, he committed suicide on 1 April 2011. Family background Young was born on 28 October 1934 in Kengtung in British-ruled Burma, into the third generation of a Baptist missionary family. The mission was first established among Lahu in the Burmese mountains by Young's grandfather, William Marcus Young. The eldest Young converted many hill tribesmen to Christianity, his proselytizing aided by the Lahu cultural belief in the coming of a white god. Bill Young's father Harold inherited the mission and moved it to Chiang Mai in northern Thailand. Bill Young grew up participating in the Lahu tribe's traditions of hunting, hiking, and jungle survival. Not only did his youthful adventures equip him for life as a jungle dweller, it raised him in multiple languages. His knowledge of Thai, Lahu, Shan and Lao would be a key asset to the Central Intelligence Agency in the future.Warner, Back Fire: The CIA's Secret War in Laos and Its Link to the War in Vietnam, p. 53. So was his family's significance to the Christianized hill tribes, which Young would play upon to support his anti-Communist activities for the Central Intelligence Agency.Tom Fawthrop, 4 May 2011, \\"William Young Obituary\\", The Guardian. Retrieved 2 September 2014. Both Young's elder brother Gordon and his father Harold aided the CIA with an intelligence gathering net of Lahu agents extending from northern Thailand into southern China. While Harold recruited agents and gathered the resultant intelligence, Gordon trained the agents in broadcast procedures and radio repair. Bill Young met Bill Lair through this family connection. Lair claimed he first met Young when the latter was 18 years old--\\"a big, strong, good looking, very innocent guy.\\" That establishes their first meeting as being in late 1952 or early 1953.12 December 2001 oral interview of Bill Lair, Vietnam Archive at Texas Technical University; p. 138; Steve Maxner, interviewer. http://www.vietnam.ttu.edu/star/images/oh/oh0200/OH0200-part2.pdf Retrieved 30 September 2014. Central Intelligence Agency service Son Bill followed in his father's footsteps by joining the CIA after serving in the U.S. Army in Germany. He was then hired by the CIA in 1958 as an interpreter and translator, as he knew five tribal languages.McCoy, The Politics of Heroin: CIA Complicity in the Global Drug Trade, p. 306. Bill Young's knowledge of the Golden Triangle region, command of indigenous languages, and recent military experience made him an ideal candidate for service in the CIA's paramilitary wing--then known as the Special Operations Division. The Agency's rueful joke concerning Bill Young stated that he had an American exterior to disguise his Lahu interior. The very cultural background that made Young so valuable to the CIA would also become the font of their problems with him. He was stubbornly independent, and tended to take orders only from Bill Lair. In Lahu fashion, he was not strict in observing a punctual duty schedule. He did not always observe the niceties of calendar or watch, which led to complaints from other CIA case officers. Young was known to have a legion of female admirers, and a penchant for the occasional French leave, thus irritating his superiors. Additionally, his personality clashed with that of coworker Pat Landry as they worked together at the Royal Thai Air Force Base at Udorn. All of these scotched his chance for which he seemed ideally suited, that of CIA adviser to Hmong General Vang Pao.Warner, Back Fire: The CIA's Secret War in Laos and Its Link to the War in Vietnam, p. 74. Lair's solution to this personnel problem was to ship Young out from headquarters into the field. He used him to assist in founding the Operation Momentum guerrilla training program, before sending him out to spot locations for new guerrilla bases in Laos. Young flew toward the Plain of Jars and found a feasible location at Long Tieng. It would be developed by the CIA paramilitary into Lima Site 20 Alternate, the center of the purportedly Secret War.McCoy, The Politics of Heroin: CIA Complicity in the Global Drug Trade, p. 307. Lair thought Young uniquely qualified to operate solo in a culture so different from American ways. Lair had Young work his way westward toward the mountains where he was reared. Young's directions were to contact village headmen for recruitment, and to find airstrip locations for Lima Sites. He was also exploring a possible line of retreat for Vang Pao's army through Sainyabuli Province southward into Thailand. Young reached Sainyabuli Province in January 1962. Keeping a low profile there throughout the spring, he was able to recruit only 30 new guerrillas.Conboy, Morrison, Shadow War: The CIA's Secret War in Laos, p. 90. Later in 1962, Young moved northward into far northwestern Laos, as close to the familiar Burmese hills and Shan as possible. Given the shortage of Royal Lao regulars in the vicinity, the CIA decided to raise a guerrilla force. However, given Young's record of under-achievement to date, Lair thought the most Young might accomplish would be to organize a local force of Yao irregulars, or reactivate his father's old agent network into China. With a pool of about 100,000 Yao to draw from, plus some scattered smaller ethnic minorities, Young managed to raise a part-time militia of several thousand guerrillas.Warner, Back Fire: The CIA's Secret War in Laos and Its Link to the War in Vietnam, pp. 129‚Äì130.McCoy, The Politics of Heroin: CIA Complicity in the Global Drug Trade, p. 339. Young established his base at Nam Yu, Laos, in the Golden Triangle just south of the Chinese border; as part of his base, he opened Lima Site 118A so he could have aerial resupply. Some 20 additional dirt airstrips for STOL aircraft were carved out throughout the area by late 1963. He also established a second site nearby for refugee relief operations; the setup was analogous to that at Long Tieng and Sam Thong.McCoy, The Politics of Heroin: CIA Complicity in the Global Drug Trade, pp. 336-337. Nam Yu, being near the borders of both Burma and China, offered easy access to both nations. Initially, Young enrolled Burmese Shan for leadership and communications roles because they spoke English. Their major drawback was their scarce numbers in the Laotian populace. However, Young's family background facilitated recruitment from the Shan National Army in far northern Burma. He also had contacts within the National Chinese remnants there; indeed, Battalion Especiale 101 (Special Battalion 101) of the Laotian army was raised from this group. However, by late 1962, this source of manpower would come to be shunned by the CIA as the Kuomintang holdovers began to edge into opium trading. Their past poor performance in combat also told against their retention. The espionage teams trained by Young were segregated by ethnic background. Beginning in 1964, those codenamed Scope carried out reconnaissance as their military intelligence mission. Conversely, Tartar teams were tasked with road watch and ground photography duties.Conboy, Morrison, Shadow War: The CIA's Secret War in Laos, pp. 164-166. As part of his operations, Young also seeded two childhood friends as spies into an opium smuggling caravan entering China. They photographed Chinese engineers building a highway through the trackless Yunnan wilderness into Laos, and headed for Thailand.Valentine, The Strength of the Wolf: The Secret History of America's War on Drugs, p. 421. Young also had the telephone lines on the Chinese side of the border tapped, although no valuable information was gained. However, with no outside enemy to fight, his tribal militia tended to squabble with one another over ethnic differences.Warner, Back Fire: The CIA's Secret War in Laos and Its Link to the War in Vietnam, pp. 250‚Äì251. Nevertheless, there would be more than 50 cross-border missions between 1962 and 1971. Beginning in 1963, Young would also use locally recruited Kuomintang troops to raid villages occupied by the opposing Pathet Lao.Cockburn, Whiteout: The CIA, Drugs, and the Press, p. 228. After five years labor, Young had a guerrilla training program in full swing and teams of spies infiltrating China's Yunnan Province, as well as three radio listening posts just within the Burmese border, aimed at China. With all this was established, Young was replaced by Louis Ojibwe, soon killed in action, then subsequently by Tony Poe in Summer 1965. Young moved south to work at Ban Houayxay on the Mekong River to report on enemy boat traffic. He was tardy in submitting reports, however; Poe fired him, supposedly for this lack of diligence.Warner, Back Fire: The CIA's Secret War in Laos and Its Link to the War in Vietnam, p. 252. However, Young had also argued bitterly with his superiors about the increase in air strikes throughout Laos. Additionally, an incident in early 1964, when he supplied an unauthorized shipment of M1 Garands to Mien guerrillas, aroused extreme antipathy from the local Thai liaison officer, Captain Siri Pandy. Pandy returned to Bangkok. Young was recalled to CIA Headquarters for this insubordinate act in October 1964.Conboy, Morrison, Shadow War: The CIA's Secret War in Laos, p. 135. Young was returned to Nam Yu in August 1965, to run the cross-border infiltrations of local intelligence teams. By the time Young resigned from the CIA in 1967, he had not only organized the trans-border spying operations that wiretapped the Chinese telephone network, he had founded a training program that graduated 35 new agents every other month, and set up three communication stations in Burma near the Chinese border to monitor Chinese radio traffic. Given that legal commerce in opium permeated the population of northwestern Laos, it was inevitable that Young both dealt with opium smugglers and was accused of engaging in opium smuggling. Young maintained he followed the CIA policy of indifference to the trade.McCoy, The Politics of Heroin: CIA Complicity in the Global Drug Trade, pp. 338-339, 341-343, 345. Later life After Young departed CIA employ, he was employed by former Burmese Prime Minister U Nu. Beginning in April 1969, he roamed from one wealthy donor to another, swapping trade concessions in Burma for funds to establish the United National Liberated Front (ULNF). Returning from the United States, Young joined in recruiting ULNF troops. However, the Lahu recruits and the Chinese trainers engaged in ethnic quarrels. The UNLF failed because of this disunity.McCoy, The Politics of Heroin: CIA Complicity in the Global Drug Trade, p. 336. Young moved back to Chiang Mai. He began trading in gems, and owned an orchard and a guest house. He ran a hospitable home, throwing parties for stewardesses and nurses. He married one of the former, and made an abortive move to the United States. He divorced, and returned to Chiang Mai. Upon occasion, he would trade upon his CIA background, to work as an oil firm's security consultant in Sudan or for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. Serious health problems, including emphysema, beset him during his final years and he died by his own hand on 1 April 2011. When Thai police discovered his body, he had a pistol in his right hand and a crucifix in his left. He had been paid $100,000 by a major Hollywood studio for his life story of adventure as a tribal warlord, but the film was never made.Edward Loxton, 4 April 2011, \\"CIA hitman Bill Young found dead in Chiang Mai\\", The Week.

He worked on the painting over an extended period, from 1856 to 1890. It is held by the Manchester Art Gallery. The painting was originally entitled Stolen Pleasures are Sweet, but became Stages of Cruelty by about 1860. The composition was inspired by Arthur Hughes's 1856 painting April Love, which shows a woman turning away from her lover after an argument, and also by William Hogarth's series of engravings Four Stages of Cruelty. Like Hogarth's series, Brown's painting shows separate episodes in the life of the same character, although in this case on the same canvas, with a cruel child growing up to become a cruel adult. In Brown's painting, a girl in a red dress and a white bonnet is shown sitting at the bottom of a flight of stone steps, spitefully hitting her bloodhound with a stem of love-lies-bleeding while the dog raises a paw in protest. Behind her, sitting on a brick wall beside the stairs, a young woman is turning away from a man hidden in a lilac bush behind the wall. The man her lover looks mournfully over a wall at the woman, grasping her right hand and arm, but she rejects him without remorse. She wears a white jacket, with lace collar and cuffs, and a long blue skirt; some red flowers, perhaps geraniums, are tucked into her jacket, and she holds a piece of unfinished embroidery in her left hand. To the right, bindweed (convolvulus) climbs up the balustrade beside the stairs. The flowers are symbolic, reflecting their accepted meanings in the Victorian language of flowers. The love-lies-bleeding stands for hopeless; the purple lilac for first love; and the bindweed (convolvulus) for extinguished hopes. One of the meanings of geraniums is deceit. The young girl was initially modelled on Brown's second daughter Catherine, and later on Catherine's own daughter Juliet. Brown started the work without a commission, and then it languished for many years. It was eventually finished for the brewer, Henry Boddington. Watercolour versions of the painting are held by Tate Britain and the Ashmolean Museum.

Its heyday was during the 20th century's first decades, between 1910 and 1930, but a number of contemporary movements still exist. History The first recorded anarchist movement in Bolivia was the Uni√≥n Obrera Primero de Mayo in 1906, in the small southern town of Tupiza. The organization edited the newspaper La Aurora Social. Other contemporary libertarian publications were Verbo Rojo, El Proletario and La Federaci√≥n, published in the cities of Potos√≠, Cochabamba and Santa Cruz de la Sierra, respectively. Several minor trade unions came together to form the Federaci√≥n Obrera Local (FOL) in 1908, and in 1912 the Federaci√≥n Obrera Internacional (FOI). They adopted the red-and-black flag of anarcho-syndicalism. In the city of La Paz, FOL maintained the periodical Luz y Verdad, while FOI published the Defensa Obrera, which launched a campaign for an eight-hour day. 1918 the FOI was renamed the Federaci√≥n Obrera del Trabajo (FOT), which moved ideologically towards marxism. During the 1920s, the presence of anarchism within the labor movement was at its highest point, with anarchist participating in the struggles of the Bolivian miners. Many strikes - such as in Huanuni in 1919 - were started to demand an eight-hour work day. The anarcho-syndicalist FOL, later associated with the international Asociaci√≥n Continental Americana de Trabajadores confederation, published the weekly newspaper La Humanidad. Numerous anarchist movements were active in La Paz, such as the Centro Cultural Obrero, the Centro Obrero Libertario, the Grupo Libertario \\"Rendici√≥n\\", Sembrando Ideas, Brazo y Cerebro, and the group La Antorcha (founded in 1923) led by Luis Cusicanqui, Jacinto Centellas and Domitila Pareja. Other groups elsewhere in the country were the Centro Obrero Internacional in Oruro, the Escuela Ferrer i Guardia in Sucre, and the newspaper Tierra y Libertad. Women had a prominent role in the anarcho- syndicalist movement. In 1927 the Sindicato Femenino de Oficios Varios was founded. Also founded in 1927 was the Federaci√≥n Obrera Femenina, a branch of FOL and merger of several other all-female unions. Among female anarchist activists were Catalina Mendoza, Petronila Infantes, and Susana Rada. During the Third National Workers' Congress in 1926, the Bolivian communists proposed that the labor organizations should affiliate with the Third International, an idea which was rejected by the anarcho-syndicalists. The FOL was also present in the agrarian peasantry, organizing the Federaci√≥n Agraria Departamental (FAD), which later disappeared due to intense government repression. Bolivian anarcho-syndicalism had a strong presence of foreign activists, many of which had fled their countries due to political persecution. Among them were one Fournarakis, an activist of the Argentine Regional Workers' Federation (FORA) sent into exile, Armando Trevi√±o who was a Chilean cobbler belonging to the Industrial Workers of the World, the Peruvian Francisco Gamarra and Paulino Aguilar, and the Spanish Nicol√°s Mantilla and Antonio Garc√≠a Bar√≥n, the later who came to the country in the 1950s. In 1930, encouraged by the Argentine FORA, the Confederaci√≥n Obrera Regional Boliviana was founded. The organization, which lasted only two years, published La Protesta. In the 1930s the group Ideario emerged in Tupiza. It published La Voz del Campo. At this point the anarchist movement was in decay, having faced growing government persecution. The Chaco War also caused many problems. Later, anarcho- syndicalist unions saw themselves forced to join the Bolivian Workers' Center to survive. Some anarchists tried to influence the BWC from within, among them L√≠ber Forti. In 1946 the N√∫cleo de Capacitaci√≥n Sindical Libertario was formed. Unlike its mother organization FOL, the Federaci√≥n Obrera Femenina weathered the interwar period, surviving until 1964. The Spanish expropriative anarchist, and notorious bank robber and forger, Lucio Urtubia participated in planning the kidnapping of Klaus Barbie, the \\"Butcher of Lyon\\", a former Nazi German officer and war criminal who after fleeing to Bolivia with the help of the CIA helped the government fight Communist guerrillas, later aiding a coup d'√©tat in 1980. In the 1950s Antonio Garc√≠a Bar√≥n (1921‚Äì2008), described by the BBC as the last surviving member of the Durruti Column, an anarchist militia in the Spanish Civil War, and a former prisoner of the Mauthausen- Gusen concentration camp, moved to Bolivia with his wife Irma. There he started a self-described anarchist community, deep in the jungle of San Buenaventura. =Contemporary= In the modern period anarchism has seen a minor renaissance in Bolivia. Several groups exists, prominently among them Mujeres Creando, an anarcha-feminist collective. The organization participates in a range of anti-poverty work, including spreading propaganda, street theater and direct action. The group was founded by Mar√≠a Galindo, M√≥nica Mendoza and Julieta Paredes in 1992 and members include two of Bolivia's only openly lesbian activists. It publishes Mujer P√∫blica, produces a weekly radio show, and maintains a cultural caf√© named Virgen de los deseos. In 2001, Mujeres Creando gained international attention due to their alleged participation in an armed occupation of the Bolivian Banking Supervisory Agency. Other groups and collectives include the Grupo de Apoyo a los Movimientos Sociale in Cochabamba, Combate La Paz and El Alto, Acci√≥n Anarquista Quepus im Sucre, Quilombo Libertario e Infrarrojo in Santa Cruz, and the Colectivo Libertario Gritos in Tarija. Since 2005 there exists an anarchist student movement in the southern region of the Gran Chaco, the Autonom√≠a Frente Universitario. Anarchist newspapers and fanzines include Contraataque, Insumisi√≥n and Oveja Negra. The Black Bridge International, a defunct \\"decentralized anarchist mutual aid network\\", had a local group in Bolivia. In 2003, an affiliated collective in New York City produced a Black Bridge documentary entitled \\"Bolivia Calling\\". The Informal Anarchist Federation (FAI), an insurrectionary anarchist organization, with cells throughout Europe and Latin America, is active in Bolivia. On May 30, 2012 four youths were arrested in connection to a dynamite attack on a military barracks and the bombing of a car dealership. Both attacks were claimed by the FAI. Among contemporary anarchist figures are Silvia Rivera Cusicanqui, an Aymara feminist sociologist and historian. Fredy Perlman (1934‚Äì1985), a prominent author within modern green anarchism and anarcho-primitivism, spent seven years during his childhood in Bolivia.

It was his last painting, made in a Neo-Impressionist style in 1890-91, and remained unfinished at his death in March 1891. The painting is located at the Mus√©e d'Orsay in Paris. Background The painting was Seurat's third major work treating the theme of the circus, after his Parade (Circus sideshow) of 1887-88 and Le Chahut of 1889-90. It depicts a female performer standing on a horse at the Circus Fernando (renamed the Circus M√©drano in 1890, after its most famous clown). The Circus M√©drano was located at the corner of the Rue des Martyrs and the Boulevard de Rochechouart, close to Seurat's studio. It was a popular entertainment in Paris, depicted in the 1880s by other artists such as Renoir (for example, Acrobats at the Cirque Fernando (Francisca and Angelina Wartenberg)), Degas (for example, Miss La La at the Cirque Fernando) and Toulouse-Lautrec (for example, Equestrienne (At the Circus Fernando)). Seurat makes use of Charles Henry's theories on the emotional and symbolic meaning of lines and colours, and the works of Chevreul and Ogden Rood on complementary colours. He was also influenced by Japanese prints, and the graphic works of Jules Ch√©ret. The work is similar to chromolithograph Au cirque by Karl Gampenrieder, but it is not clear if Seurat had seen it. Description The work measures (dimensions with frame painted by the artist: 232 x 198.5 cm). Seurat used a Neo-Impressionist Divisionist style, with pointillist dots creating the sense of other colours. The work is dominated by white and the three primary colours, mainly red and yellow with blue shading. A deeper blue border painted around the edge of the canvas, merging into a flat frame in the same shade of blue. The painting is divided into two spaces, with the circus artists occupying the lower right, characterised by curves and spirals creating a sense of movement, and the audience occupying the upper left, confined to rows of benches. The audience shows the distinctions between social classes sitting in rows, from the well- dressed higher classes near the front (sitting in the front row, in a top hat, is Seurat's friend and fellow painter Charles Angrand) to the lower classes in the gallery at the back. A sense of space is created by the whiteface clown in the foreground, facing away from the viewer, and the tiers of bleachers. Another pair of clowns are tumbling to the right behind the ringmaster. Seurat made few preparatory studies, concentrating on creating dynamic lines and using few colours. Reception Le Cirque was first exhibited at the Salon des Ind√©pendants in March 1891, in an unfinished state. The work remained unfinished at Seurat's death a few days later: in places, the white ground and a grid of blue lines used by Seurat to create his composition are still visible. Early critics complained that the subjects were stiff, like automatons. Others later saw it as a forerunner of Cubism. The painting was returned to Seurat's mother after the exhibition in 1891, and she hung it in the room in the Boulevard de Magenta where he had died. The painting was acquired by Paul Signac around 1900, and then by American collector John Quinn, who donated the painting to the Louvre in 1927. It was exhibited at the Mus√©e du Luxembourg, the Mus√©e National d'Art Moderne and the Galerie du Jeu de Paume. It has been located at the Mus√©e d'Orsay since 1977.

He is working for the Mexican professional wrestling promotion Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) portraying a tecnico (\\"Good guy\\") wrestling character. Blue Panther Jr's real name is not a matter of public record, as is often the case with masked wrestlers in Mexico where their private lives are kept a secret from the wrestling fans. He is the son of Genaro Vazquez Nevarez, better known as Blue Panther, and the older brother of wrestler The Panther. Personal life Black Panther is the oldest son of professional wrestler Genaro Vazquez Nevarez, better known under the ring name Blue Panther and brother of masked wrestler The Panther. His full given name is not a matter of public record in accordance with Lucha Libre traditions where the true identities of masked wrestlers are kept private whenever possible. Both of Nevarez' sons were featured in interviews around their father well before they became professional wrestlers, but their names were never explicitly stated and they always wore the same Blue Panther mask that their father used to conceal their identifies and that of the then masked Nevarez. During interviews they were referred to as \\"Blue Panther Jr.\\" and \\"Hijo de Blue Panther\\", but neither of the sons ever officially used that name. In April 2020 a younger brother was introduced to the wrestling world, using the ring name Chachoro Lagunero, \\"The Lagunero Puppy\\", wearing a version of his father's Blue Panther mask design. He is the cousin of Jesus Toral L√≥pez, better known as Black Warrior, a long time wrestler who at one point also wrestled as \\"Black Panther\\" Professional wrestling career Up until 2013 Black Panther was depicted in interviews as \\"Blue Panther Jr.\\" or referred to simply as \\"the Son of Blue Panther\\". He was introduced as \\"Black Panther\\" while wearing a black and blue version of his father's Panther themed mask during a show to honor his father's 35th anniversary as a wrestler in late 2013. At the time his young brother was also introduced to the wrestling world as Cachorro with a similar mask, but no announcement of their debut date was given at the time. Black Panther made his debut on December 29, 2013, at a local show in Guadalajara, teaming with local wrestler Virgo to defeat the team of Rey Trueno and Mr. Trueno. Black Panther participated in Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre's 2014 La Copa Junior on January 1, 2014. La Copa Junior is a tournament exclusively for second or third-generation wrestlers competing in a torneo cibernetico elimination match. Black Panther and Chachorro were on the rudo (\\"Bad guy\\") team to even out the numbers between the two sides, but were promoted as 'tecnicos (\\"Good guys\\") subsequently. Black Panther did not eliminate any opponents during the match and was the fifth overall eliminated when he was pinned by Stigma. Following the La Copa Junior match Black Panther and Cachorro stated to team up with their father for trios (six-man) tag team matches, with the team billed as Los Divinos Laguneros (\\"The divine from the Lagoon\\", referencing their home region). They soon began a storyline rivalry with La Dinastia Casas (\\"The Casas Dynasty\\"; El Felino and his two sons Tiger and Puma), which was a continuation of a long running storyline between Blue Panther and the Casas family. Black Panther entered the 2014 Torneo Gran Alternativa (\\"Great Alternative\\") tournament, an annual a tag team tournament that has a wrestling rookie team up with an experienced wrestler for the tournament to help showcase younger wrestlers. Black Panther was teamed up with veteran wrestler Diamante Azul to participate in qualifying Block B where they lost to eventual tournament winners Cavernario and Mr. Niebla in the first round. Black Panther was one of 16 wrestlers competing in a tornero cibernetico match for one of eight spots in CMLL's 2014 En Busca de un √çdolo (\\"In search of an idol\\") tournament, but was eliminated. Black Panther, Cachorro, and Blue Panther competed in a one night Cuadrangular de Tercias (Trios four-way) tournament against the teams of Los Guerreros Laguneros (Euforia, Gran Guerrero, and √öltimo Guerrero), El Cuatrero, Sanson, and Universo 2000 and the team of Atlantis, Diamante Azul, and Tit√°n. The team lost to Los Guerreros, but defeated Universo 2000 and his two sons to take third place in the tournament. =Blue Panther Jr. (2014‚Äìpresent)= During a press conference on November 19 Black Panther announced that he was changing his ring name to \\"Blue Panther Jr.\\" and adopting a new mask as well. At the same press conference Cachorro announced he was taking the name The Panther. In May, 2015 Blue Panther Jr. participated in a qualifying match for the 2015 version of En Busca de un √çdolo as one of 16 wrestlers in the qualifying torneo cibernetico elimination match where the last eight wrestlers would qualify for the tournament. He competed against Akuma, Cancerbero, Canelo Casas, Delta, Disturbio, Esfinge, Flyer, El Gallo, Guerrero Maya Jr., Joker, Pegasso, Raziel, Sagrado, Stigma and Boby Zavala. Panther Jr. was one of the eight survivors and qualified for the main portion of the tournament. During the En Busca de un √çdolo the wrestlers would face off in a round-robin first round earning points based on the outcome. After the match each wrestler would receive critique and points from a four man judging panel rating them on the match they just saw. Finally all wrestlers would be given additional points from a weekly online poll open to fans. During the first round Blue Panther Jr. defeated Disturbio and Esfinge, but lost to Boby Zavala, Canelo Casas, Flyer and Guerrero Maya Jr. The judges were often critical of Blue Panther Jr.'s performance giving him between 18 points (an average of 4.5 points per judge) and 29 points (an average of 7 points per judge). On the June 26 round his father Blue Panther was the special guest of the week, stating that he would not evaluate his son he instead gave him a \\"0\\". Blue Panther Jr. was slated to face Delta in his final 1st round match, slated to take place on the 2015 Sin Salida show on July 17, 2015. On the night Blue Panther Jr. did not show up for the match, with CMLL citing force majeure as the official explanation, replacing him with Hechicero for the match. With his absence Blue Panther Jr. got zero points from the judges, cementing his position as eighth and last of all the En Busca de un Idolo participants. On December 25, 2015 as part of CMLL's annual Infierno en el Ring show Blue Panther Jr. was one of twelve men risking their mask in the main event steel cage match. He was the seventh man to leave the cage, keeping his mask safe in the process. The match was won by Blue Panther Jr.'s younger brother The Panther as he unmasked S√∫per Comando. In January 2017, Blue Panther Jr. made his Japanese debut by taking part in Fantastica Mania 2017, the annual tour co-produced by CMLL and New Japan Pro Wrestling (NJPW).

ADW is often conducted online or by phone. In contrast to ADW, credit shops allow wagers without advance funding; accounts are settled at month-end. Racetrack owners, horse trainers and state governments sometimes receive a share of ADW revenues. It typically involves betting on horse or greyhound racing. Wagering may take place through parimutuel pools. Legality Illinois was the first state to offer ADW and has allowed its adult residents to participate in ADW since 1999 under the Illinois Horse Racing Act of 1975; Illinois receives a cut of ADW revenues. Shortly thereafter, Connecticut, Maryland, New York, Oklahoma, and Pennsylvania allowed the practice as well. By 2011, 28 states expressly allowed advance-deposit wagering, with 13 remaining in a bit of a \\"grey area\\" as the practice isn't explicitly prohibited by state law. Impact Chapter 58 of the New York State Laws of 2012 added a new Section 911 to the New York State Racing, Pari-Mutuel Wagering and Breeding Law (Racing Law). Section 911 requires the New York State Racing and Wagering Board (Board) to assess the impact of advanced deposit wagering (ADW) in New York State including, but not limited to: * The impact of out-of-state account wagering providers (OSAWP) accepting wagers from New York State residents; * The annual dollar amount wagered by New York State residents through OSAWPs; * The number of OSAWP accounts held by New York State residents; * Information concerning New York State residents who utilize OSAWPs including residency. Section 911 of the Racing Law required that the study, along with any recommendations, be submitted to the Governor and the Legislature by September 15, 2012. The results of the survey revealed that New York residents bet $165,567,707 in 2010 and $142,246,859 YTD 9/30/11 through the responding OSAWPs. This includes wagering on the New York racing product and on out-of-state racetracks. Table 1 provides detail of the handle by New York racetracks and out-of-state racetracks. The Board estimates this handle will exceed $200,000,000 in 2012. The survey also showed that OSAWPs listed 18,769 accounts in 2010 and 21,310 accounts in YTD 9/30 2011 as New York resident accounts.

The first Ballyscullion House, sometimes called \\"Bishop's Folly\\", was a large house intended for Frederick Hervey, 4th Earl of Bristol and Bishop of Derry. Construction began in 1787 but it was not completed when he died in Italy in 1803. His heir decided to live at his other Irish house, Downhill House, also in County Londonderry, and the partially built Ballyscullion House was demolished by 1825. A second and much smaller Ballyscullion House was built in 1840 for Admiral Sir Henry William Bruce, and is now owned by the Mulholland family. A military camp was built on the estate in the Second World War by the 202nd Engineering Combat Battalion and occupied by the US 82nd Airborne Division before D-Day. Background Hervey was the son of John Hervey, 2nd Baron Hervey, and grandson of John Hervey, 1st Earl of Bristol. He became Bishop of Cloyne in 1767 and was translated to become Bishop of Derry in 1768. He succeeded his elder brothers as the 4th Earl of Bristol in 1779. The original Ballyscullion House was the second of three palatial country houses built by the Earl Bishop, two in Ireland and one in England. The first, Downhill, was built on the north coast of County Londonderry between about 1775 and 1785, and includes Mussenden Temple. Downhill was damaged by fire in 1851, restored, fell into disrepair while occupied by the Royal Air Force in the Second World War, and now lies in ruins. Ballyscullion was his second house in Ireland, and may have been a prototype for a third house, Ickworth House in England, designed by Mario Asprucci, where building work began in 1795. Ickworth was completed by the 5th Earl of Bristol after the 4th Earl's death, and is even larger than Ballyscullion, with a dome some high and a frontage of over . First Ballyscullion House  Building work began at Ballyscullion in 1787, shortly after Downhill was completed. Hervey probably employed the same Irish architect, Michael Shanahan. The design may have been based on John Plaw's Belle Isle, Windermere, or Palladio's Villa Capra, both themselves inspired by the Pantheon in Rome. The northern fa√ßade resembles St. Peter's Basilica in Rome, with a central domed rotunda flanked by curved wings, and a large pavilion at each end, forming a front measured in length. The house was faced with local stone, from the Sperrin Mountains to the west (possibly near Ballinascreen or Dungiven). The portico to the north had four pillars with a pediment bearing Hervey's arms, carved in Italy. A Greek verse in gold letters read (in translation) \\"Immediately open ye doors, for much wealth is within, and, with that wealth, fresh-springing benevolence\\". The central rotunda was an oval measuring , surrounded by 20 Corinthian pilasters. On the frieze was a Latin verse circling the house, reading: : Hic viridi in campo, templum de marmore ponam, : Propter aquam, tardis ingens ubi flexibus errat : Bannius, et tenui praetexit arundine ripas Which can be translated as: ‚ÄúHere is a verdant plain; I will place a temple of marble beside the waters, where the vast Bann strays in sluggish windings, and clothes his banks with tender reed.‚Äù Above the giant first storey were two further storeys, an entablature and attic storey high, and a dome with a sky-light. Inside was an oval lobby of with classical statues in niches. A double corkscrew staircase lit from above - possibly inspired by the famous staircase at the Ch√¢teau de Chambord - led up to a circular drawing room on the first floor, with views across to the Antrim hills to the east, the Mountains of Mourne to the south and the Sperrin Mountains to the west. Oval drawing and dining-rooms on the first floor each measured , and with a library that measured . Corridors led thorough the two wings to pavilions intended as galleries , one for Italian paintings and one for Flemish paintings. Demolition The Earl Bishop died in Italy in July 1803, when the rotunda was almost completed, although its windows had been removed to avoid the window tax. The unfinished house was inherited Rev Henry Hervey Aston Bruce (later 1st Baronet). Bruce was the Earl Bishop's cousin and the brother of his friend Mrs Frideswide Mussenden, after whom Mussenden Temple at Downhill was named. Bruce decided to live at Downhill, where he had been the Earl Bishop's steward. He removed many of the contents and fittings from Ballyscullion to Downhill, and Ballyscullion was demolished in 1813 (or possibly 1825). The columns from Ballyscullion‚Äôs portico were bought by Dr. Nathaniel Alexander, then the Church of Ireland Bishop of Down and Connor. Alexander donated the columns to be incorporated in the rebuilding of St George's Church, Belfast, where they form its portico. Many fireplaces, columns, windows and other features from Ballyscullion can still be found in other historic houses in Ireland: Alexander also acquired other marble columns and chimneypieces for his house at Portglenone House - now a Cistercian monastery; other chimneypieces adorn Bellarena House; an Italian chimneypiece from Downhill (probably originally from Ballyscullion) is today at Castle Upton in County Antrim; and the staircase was bought by Charles O'Neill, 1st Earl O'Neill to be included in Shane‚Äôs Castle, then being rebuilt, but was destroyed in a fire in 1816. Charles Lever described the house in his 1899 book, The Bramleighs of Bishop's Folly. Second Ballyscullion House  A second Ballyscullion House was built near the remains of the first house in 1840 by Sir Charles Lanyon for Admiral Sir Henry William Bruce, a younger son of the Rev. Sir Henry Hervey Aston Bruce, 1st Baronet. The admiral had fought at the Battle of Trafalgar as boy aged 13, and went on to be Commander-in- Chief, Pacific Station from 1854 to 1857, and Commander-in-Chief, Portsmouth from 1860 to 1863. The new house remained in the Bruce family until it was bought by Sir Henry and Lady Mulholland in 1938. Sir Henry Mulholland, 1st Baronet was the Speaker of the Northern Ireland House of Commons from 1929 to 1945. In the Second World War, the estate, renamed Camp Ballyscullion, was prepared by the 202nd Engineering Combat Battalion for US soldiers of the 82nd Airborne Division before D-Day. Ballyscullion House remains a private house owned by the Mulholland family. It may be hired as a wedding venue or film location: part of Game of Thrones was filmed in the park.

World War I He enlisted in the American Ambulance Field Service in February 1915, and arrived at the western front, with Section 2, at Pont-a-Mousson, in April 1915. From February to May he served with the Ambulance at Verdun. He was cited July 4, 1915, \\"for rescue of wounded under fire,\\" offensive Bois-le-Pretre, \\"Croix de Guerre with Star.\\" In June 1915, he enlisted in the Foreign Legion of the French Army, and transferred to 2d Groupe d'Aviation. He was brevetted pilot on Bleriot at Buc. He trained successively at Nieuport Perfectionnement School, at Avord; Machine-Gun School, Cazaux; Combat and Acrobatics, at Pau; Spad, at Plessis Belleville. Willis arrived on the Somme front with the Lafayette Escadrille (N 124) in March, 1917. Soon after arriving Willis redesigned the squadron insignia changing it from a Seminole warrior to a Sioux warrior. The original indian head was printed on boxes of ammunition marked \\"Savage Arms Manufacturing Company\\". This company was providing ammunition for machine guns used by reconnaissance units and bombers of the French military aviation. Harold Buckley Willis shown with the original insignia of the Lafayette Escadrille (N 124) in France during World War I about March 1917. Second insignia created by Harold Willis for the Lafayette Escadrille Sgt. Willis, was captured after an aerial battle, probably against Lt. Wilhelm Schulz of Jasta 16b, 18 August 1917. The aircraft was hit numerous times with damage to the engine which forced the pilot to land in German territory near Convensoye, France. He wrote of his capture in a letter written from a Westphalian prison camp: > This is the first chance I have had to write you a long letter I have heard > nothing from the outside yet, but am hopeful.

Willis was interned in the prison camps of Montmedy, Carlsruhe, Landshut, Giitersloh, reprisal camp Eutin, Bad Stuer, Mecklenburg-Schwerin, Magdeburg, Wurzburg, and Villingen, during 14 months of captivity. After several attempts, Willis disguised as a German guard, made his escape from the American camp at Villingen on Oct. 4, 1918, crossing the Rhine river into Switzerland and finally back to Paris. On arriving at Paris, Willis was awarded the M√©daille Militaire and permitted to return to the Argonne front. Returning to the US in 1919, he was honorably discharged. He wrote his memoirs in a six-part series that appeared in The Boston Globe within a week of his arrival home. The series was issued as the book Through a Cloud of Bullets in January 2019. World War II 12 Curtiss P-40 Warhawks to the Free French Fighter Group GC II/5 During World War II, Willis served in the U.S. Army Air Force as a Major in Africa, England and France. He left the Air Force after the war as a Colonel. Willis was successful in convincing the U.S. government to transfer 12 Curtiss P-40 Warhawks to the Free French Fighter Group GC II/5 based in North Africa. These aircraft were painted with the Lafayette Escadrille insignia emblazoned on their fuselages.

In the British Museum The Chimalli (from Nahuatl:Shield, ) was the traditional defensive armament of the indigenous states of Mesoamerica. These shields varied in design and purpose. The Chimali was also used while wearing special headgear. Construction Chimalli were constructed out of materials such as the skins of deer, ocelots, and rabbits, plants such as bamboo, agave, and cotton, precious metals such as gold, and feathers from local, remote, and migratory birds. A single shield could be covered with as many 26,400 feathers. Feathers for chimalli were collected by bird breeders called amantecas, who hunted and raised several species of birds for the purpose of using their feathers for art. Being an amanteca was a family tradition, and one would teach the art to their progeny. The creation of chimalli was also a community tradition, an art that involved amantecas, as well as goldsmiths, carpenters, and painters. Variations The size of the shields varied. Some had normal(circular design) dimensions, others covered the whole body. There are reports of versions that could be folded.

Before 2016, it had been held on August 29 at 8:29 p.m., but the 2016 event was moved to August 27 (which fell on a Saturday that year) at the same time and rebranded as the \\"Louisville Zombie Walk\\". This resulted in a lawsuit between two of the event's co-founders, John King and Lyndi Curtis, which resulted in Curtis abandoning all rights to the event. The Louisville Zombie Walk's co-organizer, Jason Bessemann, was not named in the suit and went on to promote the 2017 Louisville Zombie Walk as a separate event three days before the original. Several thousand participants dressed and made up as zombies gather in the Highlands area and march down Bardstown Road to the end point of the walk. An after party is typically thrown by all the bars included in the nightlife throughout the street after the walk. Some of the bars included are: Nowhere Bar, Highlands Taproom, Big Bar, Baxter's, and many others in the local area. Throughout the years, the walk grew by thousands as word of mouth caught on. The last few years, the walk has generated over 10,000 walkers, with 30,000 in 2013 and 32,000 in 2014. Over 40,000 walkers were anticipated for the 2015 event. It began as a birthday party for three friends, but has turned into a real event recognized by local businesses. The event typically costs around $10,000 to function, but the event is kept free to the public due to donations. The 2015 event ended in a minor controversy due to excessive amounts of trash left behind by participants. That year's event coincided with the Highlands Festival, another major annual neighborhood event, and according to one media report, the city government failed to follow some standard procedures that could have assured a timely cleanup. In the wake of the event, the office of mayor Greg Fischer indicated that the city would reconsider whether to allow the event in the future if cleanup issues were not addressed. The Louisville government has since established policies requiring that the organizers of public events submit a cleanup plan in advance, with the plan being reviewed before a permit is issued. The organizers of the Zombie Walk hired a cleanup company for the 2016 event. In 2017, King organized a revamped event on the original date of August 29 billed as \\"Louisville Zombie Attack: A Funeral for Indecency\\", since the original Zombie Attack could not compete with an identical event in the same place only three days before. This will feature live music and entertainment, costume contests, a George A. Romero tribute movie marathon and a pinball tournament.

The waters of the Moisie River descend to 410 kmThe Canadian Encyclopedia: Moisie River up to its mouth in the cove at Elz√©ar, 25 kilometres east of Sept-√éles, where the river empties into the St. Lawrence river. The waters of the cove flow into the St. Lawrence River to Moisie, Quebec between the \\"Pointe Moisie\\" and \\"East Point\\". This loop provides a safe haven to protect ships from heavy seas. Just before its mouth, the river Moisie forms a large bend at 180 degrees for around two peninsulas: * The first one that is oriented towards the East is 5.3 km long; a small hamlet called \\"Elbow-de-la-Rivi√®re Moisie\\" is located at the tip of the peninsula.

The Montagnais still use the river as a route into that territory. The river has a rapid because of the sudden drop in its path flow; it has several waterfalls and rapids. The river also has several pits suitable for bolting and retention of salmon.  Salmon fishing  Areas of the river are: * Area 1, which covers ten kilometres downstream from the bridge of the Route 138, in the estuarine area of the river; * Area 2, which is upstream from the bridge of the Route 138. There are 19 pools spread over eight kilometres; * Winthrop-Campbell area (upstream of ZEC), with a length of four kilometres. With 14 pools, this sector is the only one with quota. Although fishing rights belong to the \\"Camp's fishing river Moisie\\" they are administered by the APRM under a renewable agreement from year to year. The Fishing Camp holds the exploitation rights to eight kilometers, being the owner of the riverbed. On public lands upstream, fishing rights are leased to five outfitters: Moisie-Nipissis, Camp Messnak, Moisie- Ouapetec, Moisie-Water-Gold and Upper Moisie. Subsistence fishing is practised in Sector 2 of the ZEC by Montagnais of Uashat and Maliotenam. The downstream part of the river is easily accessible either via the ZEC and the \\"Camp's fishing of river Moisie\\". Users can access the upstream sectors by air. Fishing in the ZEC and the Winthrop-Campbell sector practice only from a river boat. According rensencement aquatic wildlife species twelve fish live in the watershed of the Moisie River.

(led by Arthur S. Demoulas), the company that runs the Market Basket chain of supermarkets, fired President and CEO Arthur T. Demoulas. Demoulas's dismissal resulted in protests from the company's employees and customers. The protests ended on August 27, 2014, when the company's shareholders, including Arthur S. Demoulas, agreed to sell their shares to Arthur T. Demoulas. History In 1954, brothers Telemachus \\"Mike\\" Demoulas and George A. Demoulas purchased Demoulas Market, their parents' mom and pop- style store in Lowell, Massachusetts, for $15,000 and converted it into a modern supermarket. The brothers eventually expanded their business into a chain of supermarkets, with locations through Massachusetts and New Hampshire in the northeastern United States. George Demoulas died in 1971. In 1990, the widow and children of George Demoulas (including his son, Arthur S. Demoulas) sued Telemachus Demoulas, alleging that they had been defrauded out of their shares in the company. Arthur S. Demoulas later filed a second suit, this time alleging that Telemachus Demoulas had diverted assets from the jointly-owned family company to ones controlled by him and his children. Both cases were decided in favor of the plaintiffs. Judge Maria Lopez awarded George's family about $206 million and 50.5% of the company. She also ordered that Telemachus Demoulas be removed as president of the company. =Presidency of Arthur T. Demoulas= In 2008, Telemachus's son Arthur T. Demoulas was named President and CEO of DeMoulas Super Markets, Inc. During his tenure as CEO, sales grew from $3 billion a year to over $4 billion, and the number of employees increased from 14,000 to 25,000. During the same time, competitors Stop & Shop and Shaw's closed many of their stores due to financial troubles. Market Basket also faced new competition from Wegmans. Demoulas was known for his ability to remember his employees' names, birthdays, and milestones, attending many of their weddings and funerals, checking in on ill employees, and asking about the spouses and children of his workers. He was seen as a father figure by a number of his employees and compared to It's a Wonderful Life protagonist George Bailey for his willingness to put people over profit. However, Demoulas's opponents criticized him for being \\"openly defiant\\" of the board of directors and having a \\"dictatorial\\" management style. =Allegations against Arthur T.= In 2010, Arthur S. Demoulas's lawyers drafted legal memos accusing Arthur T. Demoulas of misappropriating millions of dollars by arranging company deals with companies in which Arthur T. and his family were personally invested. The first allegation was against Retail Development and Management Inc., a real estate firm owned by Arthur T.‚Äôs brothers-in-law, Kettenbach and Pasquale. The deal with Market Basket paid Retail Development and Management Inc. 7.5% of the total development costs compared to the traditional industry percentage at the time of 2-3%. Secondly, Arthur T. recommended Market Basket purchase a property in Bourne, Massachusetts, for $20.9 million. The Bourne property was owned by a company in which Arthur T. was a main investor. After Market Basket purchased this site, Arthur S. consulted Robert Griffin of Cushman & Wakefield, which valued the property at $9 million. In response to these allegations, the Board of Directors hired Mel L. Greenberg, a retired judge, to investigate Arthur S.' claims. Greenberg found the fees paid to Retail Development and Management Inc. were not disproportionate to the amount of work done and lawyers for Arthur T. noted that Cushman & Wakefield later appraised the Bourne property as being valued at $25.5 million. Arthur T. also defended his decision to buy the Bourne property, explaining by purchasing that specific property, it allowed Market Basket to avoid fighting in a bidding war against their competitors. =Attempted removal of Arthur T. by Arthur S.= In mid-2013, shareholder Rafaela Evans, the widow of Arthur S. Demoulas's brother Evan, switched loyalties, tipping the majority vote from Arthur T. to Arthur S. On July 18, 2013, the board did not adopt a motion to dismiss Arthur T. as CEO after protesters gathered outside the meeting. Five days later, the board voted to distribute $250 million to family shareholders, an action opposed by Arthur T. In March 2014, two board members elected by Arthur T., William Shea and Terence Carleton, skipped a meeting in which it was anticipated that there could be a vote to remove Arthur T. as CEO. Arthur S.'s side of the family sued Shea and Carleton, alleging they had intentionally missed the meeting so there wouldn't be enough members to have a vote. A judge sided with Arthur S. and ordered Shea and Carleton to attend the next meeting. =Firing of Arthur T. Demoulas= On June 23, 2014, three top-level executives - CEO Arthur T. Demoulas, Vice President Joseph Rockwell, and Director of Operations William Marsden - were fired by the board. The Chief Executive position was filled by former Radio Shack executive James Gooch and former Albertsons executive Felicia Thornton, who were appointed to share the position. =Protests= Chelsea Market Basket store In response to Demoulas's firing, six high-level managers resigned, and 300 employees held a rally outside Market Basket's Chelsea, Massachusetts, flagship store on June 24. The protesters criticized the Market Basket board for putting money before people by choosing to pay its shareholders more instead of reinvesting in the business. Many employees also feared that the new leadership would cut benefits, wages, profit-sharing, and bonuses and raise prices. Employees also speculated that the removal of Arthur T. Demoulas was the first step in the process of selling the company. Most employees did not go on strike, but rather participated in the protests on their own time, including during breaks. Shortly after Demoulas's dismissal, the Board of Directors signaled that it was willing to replace the management at Indian Ridge Country Club, a golf club owned by the company. This led to a protest by employees of Indian Ridge Country Club and Market Basket. On June 26, a member of the company's board of directors who was loyal to Arthur S. Demoulas, accompanied by a police detail, went to the club to fire its management, who were loyal to Arthur T. Demoulas. Later that day, Gooch and Thornton released a statement announcing that they intended to keep the club's management. On July 16, employees at Market Basket's headquarters in Tewksbury delivered an ultimatum to Gooch and Thornton. They demanded that the Board of Directors reinstate Arthur T. Demoulas as CEO by 4:30 pm the following day. Gooch and Thornton responded the following day by announcing in a letter to employees that the board would meet by phone on July 21 to address their demands. They also warned that any employee who walked out would be fired. A message on the Save Market Basket Facebook page said that the employees at Market Basket headquarters would not be reporting to work the next day (July 18). On July 18, protests with between 2,500 and 3,000 employees and customers were held at the company's Tewksbury headquarters and other locations demanding the reinstatement of Arthur T. 300 warehouse workers and 68 drivers refused to make deliveries, which left store shelves severely depleted. Customers chose not to shop at Market Basket due to the lack of product and/or as a form of protest. Stores that usually had over 100 customers in them at one time now had only a few. Most employees did not strike, thus the stores remained fully staffed but employees had little or nothing to do. Many of them joined the protesters outside or performed acts of protest inside the store, such as writing \\"Boycott Market Basket\\" on the window, placing signs encouraging customers to not shop there, leaving frozen dairy products out to spoil, or refusing to stock shelves. On July 20, eight employees were fired for their roles in organizing the protests. The next day, an estimated 5,000 people rallied outside the Market Basket store in Tewksbury. Leaders of the movement said that the protests must now head to the stores. Employees, as well as state politicians, began to call for a boycott of Market Basket stores. By mid-week, Market Basket's sales had fallen about 70%. That night, Arthur T. Demoulas issued his first statement since his firing, calling for the reinstatement of the fired employees. The protests included both management and rank-and-file employees, all of whom are non-union. On July 22, protests were held at all 71 of Market Basket's stores. On July 30, it was reported that managers and assistant managers from 68 of Market Basket's 71 stores prepared to present Gooch and Thornton with a petition stating that they would resign if Arthur T. was not reinstated. Supporters of Arthur T. Demoulas kept the rallies going through August. On August 5, the workers held their fourth-largest demonstration, as thousands protested at the Market Basket store in Tewksbury. Beginning on August 7, a handful of protesters gathered outside of a home in York, Maine, that reportedly belonged to a Market Basket shareholder. On August 15, hundreds of employees continued to protest, including 200 outside of Market Basket headquarters, despite management threatening to fire a number of employees if they did not return to work. That same day, a replacement driver for Market Basket got out of his truck with a hammer and approached protesters at the company's headquarters in Tewksbury in a threatening manner. He was arrested by Tewksbury police and charged with assault by means of a dangerous weapon and disorderly conduct. The atmosphere of the Market Basket protests was described as being like an \\"outdoor rock festival\\", \\"tailgating party\\", and \\"campaign rally\\". At a rally at the Tewksbury store, protesters threw beach balls in the air as loud music played from large speakers set up around the parking lot. Also in Tewksbury, a stage adorned with red, white and blue bunting was set up where protesters delivered speeches. At the company's headquarters, protesters put up tents and roasted a lamb in a fire pit. They also brought an American flag to hang from a flag pole on the property after the company went days without putting up a flag. Protesters carried signs with blown-up pictures of Arthur T. Demoulas. Giraffes also appeared on signs and some employees held up stuffed giraffes, as the employees were \\"sticking their necks out\\" for Demoulas. Protesters received many donations, including food, signs, and portable toilets. Response from company On July 30, CEOs Gooch and Thornton released a statement that promised that \\"any associate that wants to return will be welcomed and not penalized.\\" It also stated that the store would \\"begin advertising for employment opportunities\\" on August 8 to replace employees who chose not to work. The letter prompted a response from Massachusetts and New Hampshire Attorneys General Martha Coakley and Joseph Foster, respectively, who reminded the company's executives that their actions had \\"serious implications\\" on many small businesses that relied on their relationship with Market Basket for their means of support as well as Market Basket's obligations to compensate fired employees. Thornton and Gooch responded by stating that they \\"sincerely hope[d]\\" they would not have to fire any employees and desired to get the \\"stores back up and running for our customers and, importantly, for the many local vendors that rely on Market Basket to make their own businesses successful.\\" On August 4, the company held a job fair for prospective employees. Thornton and Gooch later stated that they had heard that many people were \\"concerned for their safety\\" if they attended the fair and they would allow people to apply for jobs through email because those interested \\"should be given an opportunity without fear of intimidation or harassment.\\" Steve Paulenka, one of the leaders of the protests, disputed the CEOs' claims. He stated that about 200 employees had demonstrated outside of the job fair and that the protests had been peaceful. On August 7, 2014, Market Basket stopped scheduling future hours for part-time employees. Beginning August 23, however, some part-time workers were called back to begin working again if available. On August 12, the company sent a \\"final\\" warning to 200 to 700 employees. The letter, signed by Gooch and Thornton, informed employees that if they did not return to work by August 15, the company would consider their jobs abandoned and terminate their employment. According to the Boston Globe, none of the employees that received the ultimatum had returned to work. On August 16, DeMoulas Super Markets placed security guards at both of the entrances of the company's headquarters. The guards recorded the protesters with camcorders. The company also banned the media from the property. =National impact= The Market Basket protests struck a chord nationally because, as BBC business reporter Kim Gittleson wrote, \\"the dispute seemed to encapsulate everything that is wrong with corporate America.\\" Chris Faraone described the dispute as \\"the last stand for the middle class\\" in an article for Esquire. =Sale negotiations= In the midst of the protests, Arthur T. offered to buy the entire company, an offer that the board said it would consider. The board was reportedly also reviewing additional offers. On July 28, 2014, the Boston Globe reported that Arthur T. Demoulas was the only remaining bidder for the 50.5% stake of the company held by the family of Arthur S. Demoulas. All previous offers by outside parties to buy the company had been withdrawn, and the board was reportedly \\"furiously negotiating\\" with Arthur T. to resolve the situation. The board denied this report, claiming that several offers were still being considered. On August 13, 2014, Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick announced that he had spoken with Arthur T. Demoulas and that it seemed that both sides were close to reaching an agreement that would allow Demoulas to purchase a controlling share of the company. He urged Market Basket employees to \\"stabilize the company\\" by returning to work while a deal was finalized. Patrick came under fire for suggesting employees return to work, as his wife is a co-managing partner and labor attorney for Ropes & Gray, the law firm that represented Market Basket's independent board members. Patrick stated that he had not known that his wife's firm had worked for the Board of Directors and that once he became aware he filed a disclosure with the state ethics commission. On August 17, 2014, Patrick and New Hampshire Governor Maggie Hassan met with both sides of the feud in an attempt to broker a deal. On August 22, Arthur T. made a $1.5 billion offer for the 50.5% of shares owned by the opposing side of the family; several subsequent days of negotiations initially failed to reach an accord. The company was estimated to be in \\"dire\\" financial straits due to the months of protests. According to one estimate, the company lost $10 million a day during the protests. =Sale to Arthur T. Demoulas= On August 27, 2014, the shareholders of Market Basket reached a deal to sell the remaining 50.5% shares of the company to Arthur T. Demoulas for $1.5 billion. According to Fortune, Demoulas was backed by The Blackstone Group, a private equity firm that put up over $500 million towards the purchase price. However, according to the Boston Globe, a source reported there was no private equity involved. The sale was officially completed on December 12, 2014.

Estimated to be about 560 million years old, H. quadriformis is identified as a cnidarian polyp, and is regarded as the earliest animal possessing muscles. Discovered in 2008 from Newfoundland in eastern Canada, it was formally described in 2014. It is the first Ediacaran organism discovered to show fossils of muscle fibres. Structural examination of the muscles and morphology indicate that the animal is a cnidarian, though, which class H. quadriformis belongs to is currently undetermined.  Discovery and name  The first fossil of Haootia was discovered from lower Fermeuse Formation of Back Cove, Bonavista Peninsula in Newfoundland. It was originally unearthed by Martin D. Brasier of the University of Oxford in 2008. However, the specimen was not allowed to be removed according to provincial law in Newfoundland, so that only a plaster cast was made. The cast (plastotype) is maintained in the collections of the Oxford University Museum of Natural History. The actual fossil specimen, or holotype, remains on the north shore of Back Cove, roughly 1.8 km NNW of Melrose town. A second, incomplete specimen was also discovered in the Trepassey Formation of Burnt Point, Bonavista Peninsula. The generic name Haootia is derived from the Beothuk word Haoot, meaning \\"demon,\\" to signify the striking appearance of the holotype. The specific name quadriformis is said to be derived from Latin quadri, meaning \\"fourfold\\", and formis, for \\"form\\", relating to the quadrilateral symmetry of the body. The proper word in classical Latin for \\"fourfold\\" is actually quadruplex,Lewis, C.T. & Short, C. (1879). A Latin dictionary founded on Andrews' edition of Freund's Latin dictionary. Oxford: Clarendon Press. while forma is the proper word in classical Latin for \\"form\\".  Description  Haootia quadriformis is uniquely different from any other Ediacaran fossil so far discovered in that it consists of bundles of fibres that have been identified as muscles. The entire body is in a broadly four-fold symmetrical arrangement. Thus the overall body organisation conforms to the key features of modern cnidarians. The fossil measures 56√ó37 mm in diameter. It indicates it is a soft-bodied animal having an appearance of a smooth discoidal structure connected by a relatively short stem to a quadrate body comprising numerous and regularly aligned linear fibres. The fibres, which are similar in pattern to parallelly arranged muscle fibres, extend laterally across the body, linking adjacent corners. The fibres extend beyond each corner to form an elongate branch, which is divided into smaller dichotomous branches. Smaller branches also arise from the lateral margins of the quadrate body, and also form dichotomously branched fibres.

W. Walsh (born June 29, 1992) is an American football coach and former player. He played quarterback for the Oklahoma State Cowboys football team from 2011 to 2015.http://www.okstate.com/roster.aspx?rp_id=1406 Early life Walsh played at Guyer High School in Denton, Texas, where he was coached by his father John and reached the University Interscholastic League state finals his senior year. College career Walsh was redshirted as a true freshman in 2011. In 2012, Walsh battled Clint Chelf and true freshman Wes Lunt for the starting quarterback job. Lunt won the quarterback derby and Walsh was named the backup. Lunt suffered a knee/ankle injury in the game against Louisiana‚ÄìLafayette on September 15. Walsh stepped in and started the next three games before suffering a knee injury against Iowa State on October 20. The injury was later revealed to be a fractured knee. The injury announcement came as a surprise as Walsh apparently suffered the injury in the first quarter, but he was able to play the entire game and finished with 415 passing yards and 46 rushing yards. The injury was expected to sideline Walsh for the rest of the season, but he was able to return only a few weeks later. He was able to suit up for the last four games of the season and backed up Chelf, who started the final five games of the season at quarterback. Walsh finished the season with 1,564 passing yards, 13 touchdowns against three interceptions, and completed 66.9 percent of his passes. He was named the Big 12 Offensive Freshman of the Year by conference coaches. In 2013, Walsh and Chelf battled for the starting quarterback spot, after Lunt decided to transfer to Illinois. On August 22, Oklahoma State head coach Mike Gundy announced that both Walsh and Chelf would play in the season opener against Mississippi State on August 31. Chelf was named the starter of the Mississippi State game only minutes before kickoff. He engineered two ineffective drives to start the game, before being replaced by Walsh, who played the rest of the game at quarterback. Oklahoma State won the game 21‚Äì3 and Walsh finished the game with 135 passing yards, 125 rushing yards, and completed 18-of-27 passes. After the game, Gundy announced that Walsh would be the starting quarterback going forward. Walsh started the next five games, until he was benched during the game against TCU after throwing two interceptions. He was replaced by Chelf, who started at quarterback for the rest of the season. In 2014, Walsh started the first two games of the season. In the second game of the season against Missouri State, Walsh was knocked out of the game with a right foot injury. The injury required surgical repair and Walsh would miss the remainder of the season. In January 2015, Gundy named Mason Rudolph the starting quarterback going into the 2015 season. With Rudolph as the unquestioned starting quarterback, Walsh entered the 2015 season as the backup quarterback. The coaches designed a package of plays specifically for Walsh and by fall practice, it became clear that Walsh would have a role in the offense. While Rudolph was the starter and would take the majority of snaps at quarterback, Walsh would enter the game at quarterback in short-yardage third and fourth down situations, and red-zone situations throughout the season. In the first ten games of the season, Walsh racked up 10 passing and 10 rushing touchdowns. Walsh started the regular season finale against Oklahoma in place of Rudolph, who suffered a foot injury against Baylor on November 21. Coaching career On January 19, 2016, it was reported that Walsh would be joining the TCU coaching staff as an offensive graduate assistant. On December 21, 2016, it was reported that Walsh would be joining the staff at Abilene Christian University for the 2017 season as the Running Backs coach. On March 10, 2020, it was reported that Walsh would be joining the staff at The University of Texas at Austin for the 2020 season as an offensive analyst.

An 1857 Early History of Kenosha recounts, \\"A 'lighter,' capable of carrying several tons weight, was built in the spring of 1836, and kept on the beach of the Lake; whenever a steamer or sail vessel anchored off shore, for the purpose of landing passengers or freight, whether in the daytime or nighttime, the lighter was launched from the beach and manned. The. lighter being heavy, it required a large portion of the able-bodied men of the town to handle it. Among the most active on such occasions, to man the lighter, was Judge Hale. Many of the citizens of Kenosha have still vivid recollections of hearing his stentorian voice, at midnight hours, calling for men to launch the lighter; when his voice did not suffice to awaken the sleepers, a heavy kick against the door never failed to bring them to a sense of wakefulness.\\"Frank, M.

Madison: Wisconsin Historical Society, 1904; pp. 370 et seq.  Public office  The new Racine County was organized on December 7, 1836 from the southern portion of Milwaukee County, and encompassed what would later become Kenosha County. When the first elections were held on April 4, 1837, Hale was one of the previously appointed justices of the peace who made up the Board of Elections. He was elected at that time to be one of the three members of the county board of supervisors. By April 1838, the title had been changed to \\"Commissioner\\", and Hale was the only one of the three members of the initial body to be retained. He remained on the board until the fall of 1839, when a new election was held. From 1840 to 1842, he served as \\"judge of probate\\", a position later renamed county judge Contemporary press reports indicate that the division between northern and southern Racine County, rather than partisan politics, was the deciding factor in many of these elections, until the county was divided in 1850.Western Historical Company.

Westminster Press, 1976. 369 pages. The church in Antioch (13:1‚Äì3) Antiochia (Antioch) in Roman and early Byzantine times This section opens the account of Paul's first missionary journey (Acts 13:1-14:28) which starts with a deliberate and prayerful step of the church in Antioch, a young congregation established by those who scattered from persecution in Jerusalem () and has grown into an active missionary church. Paul's mission was not his own initiative, but by the command of the Holy Spirit (verses 2, 4), with the framework of prayer and fasting forming an inclusio at the end of this first journey (). =Verse 1= : Now in the church that was at Antioch there were certain prophets and teachers: :: Barnabas, :: Simeon who was called Niger, :: Lucius of Cyrene, :: Manaen who had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and :: Saul. NKJV This Lucius of Cyrene is thought to be the same person as mentioned in , or the same as Luke, the writer of the Gospel of Luke and the Acts of the Apostles.Isaac Asimov. Asimov's Guide to the Bible. The New Testament. New York: Doubleday. 1969. =Verse 2= : As they ministered to the Lord and fasted, the Holy Spirit said, \\"Now separate to Me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.\\" NKJV Journey from Antioch to Cyprus (13:4‚Äì5) The first main destination of the missionary journey is the island of Cyprus, Barnabas' home area (Acts 4:36). There were already believers who scattered due to the persecution in Jerusalem (Acts 11:19), but Barnabas and Saul came on a mission ('sent out by the Holy Spirit', verse 4) to visit formal meeting-places of Jewish communities they pass through (verse 5) to preach the gospel. =Verse 4= Seleucia, where Barnabas and Paul started their journey to Cyprus. : So, being sent out by the Holy Spirit, they went down to Seleucia, and from there they sailed to Cyprus. NKJV * \\"They\\": Barnabas and Saul (Acts 13:2) The governor and the guru (13:6‚Äì12) Elymas the sorcerer is struck blind before Sergius Paulus. Painting by Raphael from the Raphael Cartoons. The account of Saul/Paul displaying the supernatural power of the Holy Spirit (verse 9) that led a proconsul into faith (verse 12) parallels Simon Peter's encounters with Simon Magus (), and with Ananias and Sapphira (). Paul sharply denounced Elymas using a prophetic language (verses 10-11) that resulted in the latter's blindness using words echoing Paul's own experience in . =Verse 6= : Now when they had gone through the island to Paphos, they found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew whose name was Bar-Jesus, NKJV It is noted from his failure to recognize the truth of gospel (verse 8) that Elymas is a 'false prophet', using the term magus (verses 6, 8), which is always in negative sense in the book of Acts (). =Verse 7= : who was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, an intelligent man. This man called for Barnabas and Saul and sought to hear the word of God. NKJV The correct Greek title (anthupatos, proconsul) is used for a governor of a senatorial province. A 'Sergius Paulus' is mentioned in a Roman inscription as a holder of an office in Rome under Claudius (at about the same period) and his family also seems to have a tie to Pisidia.Nobbs, A. (1994) 'Cyprus', in Gill and Gempf (1994), p. 289; apud Alexander 2007, p. 1044. =Verse 9= : However, Saul (who is the same as Paul), full of the Holy Spirit, fixed his eyes on him OEB The change of name from Saul (a Hebrew name) to Paul (Latin name; verse 9) is appropriate as he moved deeper into \\"Gentile territory\\", and very common for diaspora Jews to have Greek or Latin names alongside their Hebrew names. =Verse 12= : Then the proconsul believed, when he saw what had been done, being astonished at the teaching of the Lord. NKJV Luke presents Sergius Paulus as the first Gentile ruler to believe the gospel. Unlike Cornelius (), there is no evidence that Sergius attended the temple or was a God-fearer. This pagan government official was amazed at the power of God and believed the truth.The Nelson Study Bible. Thomas Nelson, Inc. 1997 Journey from Cyprus to Pisidia (13:13-52) It is customary for Paul to start his mission by visiting the local synagogue (verse 14). Paul's sermon in a synagogue of Antioch in Pisidia (13:16‚Äî41) serves as the centerpiece of a long and tightly constructed travel- and-mission account, moving into new places (13:13-14, 51; 14:6-7), then successively going back retracing each stage of the journey (14:21, 24-26). All the sites visited by Paul on this journey eventually fall within the territory of the Roman province of Galatia in the first century,Hansen 1994, p. 382; apud Alexander 2007, p. 1044. so it could be assumed that 'these are the churches Paul addresses in the Epistle to the Galatians'. =Verse 13= Ruins of the main street in Perga, capital of Pamphylia, where Paul and his party arrived after sailing from Paphos, Cyprus. :Now when Paul and his party set sail from Paphos, they came to Perga in Pamphylia; and John, departing from them, returned to Jerusalem. NKJV This John, also mentioned in verse 5, was John Mark, the nephew of Barnabas (Acts 12:25). Whatever the trouble was between Paul and John Mark, it was enough for Paul not to want John Mark to accompany him on a later journey, which caused a rift between Paul and Barnabas (). John Mark would prove faithful later in Paul's ministry (see 2 Timothy 4:11). Ruins at Antioch of Pisidia =Verse 33= :God has fulfilled this for us their children, in that He has raised up Jesus. As it is also written in the second Psalm: ::‚ÄòYou are My Son, ::Today I have begotten You.‚Äô NKJV Citing , which is also quoted and used for exposition in Hebrews 1:5; 5:5. =Verse 34= : And as concerning that he raised him up from the dead, :: now no more to return to corruption, : he said on this wise, : I will give you the sure mercies of David.

Release Floral Shoppe was released digitally to Vektroid's Bandcamp music store on December 9, 2011 by the independent record label Beer on the Rug. All of the album's track titles are written in Japanese. It received considerable online popularity, eventually becoming \\"the most hyped vaporwave release on the Internet.\\" Beer on the Rug later announced a re-release of the album in C44 cassette format. The cassette edition, limited to 100 copies, includes two bonus tracks not found on the digital issue and a code to download the album. Several songs appear in edited and/or crossfaded forms, while \\"Library\\" and \\"Mathematics\\" are featured at slower speeds than the versions found digitally. Vektroid later launched a line of tank tops and hoodies sporting a variation of the Floral Shoppe album cover. On August 6, 2017, New York-based record label Olde English Spelling Bee announced an official version of Floral Shoppe on vinyl. The record is colored \\"bubblegum pink\\" and follows the cassette version of the track listing. It included a fold-out poster and a download card for a digital copy of the album that included a download-only bonus track. Reception Floral Shoppe was met with a polarizing reception from critics and casual listeners alike, being equally \\"criticized and acclaimed for [Xavier's] soulless take on muzak\\". Jonathan Dean of Tiny Mix Tapes wrote positively of Floral Shoppe, citing the album as \\"one of the best single documents of the vaporwave scene yet, a series of estranged but soulful manipulations of found audio that carefully constructs its own meditative headspace through the careful accretion of defamiliarized memory triggers.\\" On the year-end annual Pazz & Jop critics' poll for albums, administered by The Village Voice, the album received two votes. Perfect Sound Forevers Miles Bowe cited Floral Shoppe as one of his year-end best albums. It was also named the sixth best album of the year by Tiny Mix Tapes, with reviewer James Parker opining that it \\"slid seamlessly between pure pop pleasure and the ironic framing of that pleasure, the presence of the artist at turns barely noticeable and dramatically foregrounded.\\" Assessing the influence of Floral Shoppe on vaporwave, along with the genre's perceived decline, Parker wrote: Legacy Floral Shoppe has since been heralded as one of the most significant albums in the early days of vaporwave. In a retrospective review, Adam Downer of Sputnikmusic characterized the album as \\"constantly‚Äîand delightfully‚Äîunsettling\\" and \\"a beautiful record that's both warm and strange, nostalgic and futuristic, bizarre and totally simple.\\" Writing for Pitchfork, Miles Bowe concluded, \\"Nothing could change or improve its sound which, even after thousands of soundalikes, has lost none of its perception-shattering power.\\" Vice (Noisey) included Floral Shoppe on their ranking of the 100 best albums of the 2010s.

History Football has been reported to be played in Carrum since as early as 1902. Between 1902 and 1908 it has been well reported that a 'Carrum Football Club' played pre-season matches against the likes of Frankston Football Club and Mornington Football Club but never competed in an organised competition. A news article from the Mornington Standard in 1909 reported the formation of the 'Carrum Football Club' with R. W. Jones elected as President and M. McCauley and A. Rigby as Vice-Presidents. Despite forming a club in 1909 and playing one-off matches they would not compete in regular competition until 1911. Carrum Football Club first competed in the Federal Football Association as Carrum-Chelsea Football Club in 1911, competing against Moorabbin, Cheltenham and Victoria Brewery. In 1912 the club did not compete but would return in 1913 and 1914 again re-amalgamated as Carrum-Chelsea. In 1914, Carrum would finish 5th on the ladder at the end of what would be their last season until after World War I. In 1919 following the end of the Great War, Chelsea broke away from the Carrum Football Club and formed their own 'Chelsea Football Club'. Carrum Football Club now competed as a stand-alone club in the Federal Football Association. Carrum played a short stint between 1919 and 1921 in the Mornington Peninsula Football Association. It was during this time that Carrum won their first Senior Premiership in 1921, they then returned to the Federal FA the next year. In 1928 the club underwent some financial hardship and disbanded until 1932. They reformed and joined the Peninsula District Football Association where they won their second premiership in 1932 in their return season. In 1933, Carrum came runners up to Rosebud and at the end of the 1933 season the Peninsula District FA merged with the Peninsula FA to form the Mornington Peninsula Football League. In 1936 the club disbanded again and the players joined neighboring clubs, particularly Seaford. Due to constant pressure from the old Carrum players and limited players in both Seaford and Carrum towns, they decided to combine and entered the Mornington Peninsula Football League as Seaford/Carrum Football Club. The combined Seaford/Carrum side would compete together until 1940. During those 4 seasons the team lost 51 games and only won 2. In 1941 Carrum went stand-alone again competing in a social league but achieving little success. Carrum would soon return to the MPFL and shortly after won the MPFL B-Grade Premiership in 1948 and again in 1955. Following this Carrum entered a rebuilding stage and yielded little success until 1959 when great efforts were made to match the strength of sides such as Hastings, Frankston and Crib Point. It paid off with the 1959 premiership, defeating Hastings by just 1 point. In the late 1960s the club song was changed to It's a Grand Old Flag, as used by the Melbourne Demons in the Australian Football League. Carrum Lions would then stay in the MPFL until 1988 when the Mornington Peninsula Football League merged with the Nepean Football League to form the league now knows as the MPNFL. The MPNFL was where Carrum won their final flag as the 2nd Division Premiers in 1994.http://www.heraldsun.com.au/leader/bayside/ryan- parker-on-the-rebirth-of-carrum-patterson-lakes-football-club/story- fngnvli9-1226615822527 Home Grounds *1911 - Rigby's Land - now known as Stanley St. *1912 - Carrum Primary School oval *1913-1914 - Forsyth's Property, bottom end of Breeze St. *1921 - Priestley's Paddock, McLeod Rd, Carrum. *1922-1954 - Keast Park - Nepean Highway, current site of Carrum Bowls Club. *1955‚ÄìPresent - Roy Dore Reserve (Graham Road Reserve) The Graham Road Reserve was renamed the Roy Dore Reserve in 1985 in honor of long time Carrum CFA Captain and Carrum FC President, player and coach Roy Dore.

The playing Guernsey mirrored Fitzroy's in the VFL being a Maroon Guernsey with a blue yolk and a gold Lion emblem located on the left breast of the Jersey. This was also when Carrum began wearing the now infamous white CFC monogram on the centre. *1980s - 1996 In Carrum's final years between their Guernsey changed from the dark maroon and blue yolk to red and royal blue yolk and a white monogram.

He is a member of the Colorado-based artist collective M12. Hyatt is most well known for two albums, 2005's The Clouds and 2007's Shrimp Attack, for which he composed the music and organized the recording of the songs, which were sung by, respectively, local gospel choirs and amateur singers in Sumter County, Alabama, and a 50-member collective of artists with developmental disabilities at Creative Clay, a nonprofit arts center in St. Petersburg, Florida. The Clouds received a Grammy nomination for Best Recording Package in 2005 for Hyatt's handmade corrugated cardboard CD package. The albums were originally released on Hyatt's own label, Team Records, and later re-released by Minneapolis label Innova Recordings. Hyatt's other releases on Team Records have followed a similar community-based approach typified by collectives of nonprofessional musicians organized by Hyatt. In 2005, Hyatt received a prestigious Efroymson Contemporary Arts Fellowship, awarded yearly to artists in the Midwest to reward creativity and encourage emerging and established artists. In 2020, Hyatt released a music album which combines sounds made by the Indiana bat along with music from ambient and experimental artists. Hyatt recorded the ultrasonic echolocations of the Indiana bat and then modulated the sounds in order to make the sounds audible to humans. This \\"sound library\\" of the Indiana bat was sent to musicians who then combined the sounds from the Indiana bat along with original music. Hyatt was quoted as saying that \\"bat noises are like bird songs, just in a register no one can hear. I wanted to bring out the musicality of their voices.\\" Hyatt's album is entitled Ultrasonic, and it features music from Eluvium, Machinefabriek, Ben Lukas Boysen and others.

He served as an associate justice of the Vermont Supreme Court for seven years.Richard T. Cassidy, \\"Larrow, Robert W.\\" in Vermont Encyclopedia, University of Vermont Press, 2003 (eds. John J. Duffy, Samuel B. Hand & Ralph H. Orth), pp. 183-84.Obituary: Robert W. Larrow, 75; Was Vt. Supreme Court Justice, Associated Press, August 4, 1991. The Vermont Encyclopedia describes him as \\"among a small group that led to the revitalization of the Vermont Democratic Party in the 1950s and 1960s, ending the Republican hegemony in Vermont.\\" Early life and education Larrow was born in Vergennes, Vermont, on April 27, 1916. He attended the Vergennes schools and graduated from the College of the Holy Cross and Harvard Law School, receiving his law degree in 1939. He then entered into partnership with Joseph A. McNamara as the firm of McNamara & Larrow. Legal and political career Larrow served as Burlington city attorney for nineteen years, from 1944 to 1963. He was elected to the Vermont House of Representatives in 1949, serving until 1951. Larrow unsuccessfully ran for governor in 1952 against incumbent Lee E. Emerson.Samuel B. Hand, Anthony Marro & Stephen C. Terry, Philip Hoff: How Red Turned Blue in the Green Mountain State, University Press of New England, 2011, pp. 5-6. At the time, Larrow was thirty-six years old and known for being \\"bright and articulate,\\" with \\"considerable energy and drive despite his Sydney Greenstreet-like girth.\\" With his \\"diligent work habits and sharp wit, Larrow ran a vigorous campaign\\": he lost, but received 60,051 votes, some 40 percent of the vote: a record high for a Democratic candidate for governor, and nearly 40,000 more votes than the Democratic candidate had received in 1950. Larrow's run was the first time in decades that a Democrat had actively and credibly campaigned for governor, and a sign of the resurgence of the Democratic party in Vermont after decades of Republican dominance.James M. Jeffords, An Independent Man: Adventures of a Public Servant, Simon & Schuster, 2003, p. 67. He ran as the Democratic candidate for state attorney general in 1962, on a ticket with Philip H.

The next year, Larrow unsuccessfully ran for mayor of Burlington. Larrow was chairman of the State Liquor Control Board from 1963 to 1966, and a Superior Court judge from 1966 to 1974 Vermont Supreme Court and later life Larrow became an associate justice of the Vermont Supreme Court in 1974. He was the last state supreme court justice in Vermont to be elected by the Vermont General Assembly; an amendment to the Vermont Constitution gave the power of appointment to the governor. Larrow retired from the state supreme court in 1981, after seven years on the bench, at the age of sixty-five.New England Briefs: Vt. Judge Retiring, Boston Glove, August 31, 1981.

It was isolated from small amounts of penicillium fungi. A synthetic structure matching that of natural viridicatumtoxin B makes possible synthetic variants that match or surpass its antibiotic potency. Analogs lacking a hydroxyl group were even more effective than the original against Gram- positive bacteria. Concerns about solubility, biodegradation, availability and other issues must be resolved before clinical development begins.  History  The substance was first isolated from the mycelium of liquid fermentation cultures of Penicillium species FR11.  Structure  Based on mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance data, the substance was originally thought to be the 11a',12'-epoxide, but the structure was later revised.  Effects  Viridicatumtoxin B inhibited the growth of Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin resistant S. aureus and quinolone-resistant S. aureus with a minimum inhibitory concentration of 0.5 Œºg/ml. That effect is similar to that of vancomycin, but 8 to 64 times greater than that of tetracycline.  Total synthesis  A complete total synthesis of viridicatumtoxin B, in racemic form, was completed in 2013 by the group of K. C. Nicolaou.

Orr was born with a rare spinal condition where his C-1 vertebrae, the one located at the top of his neck below his skull, was not fully developed. It was revealed that if Orr took a bad hit, the C-1 could explode and may result in death. This promptly forced Orr to retire from professional football after his third season, coming off a breakout season where he led the Ravens in tackles and earned second-team All-Pro in 2016.

College career After a standout high school career at Jacksonville High School in Jacksonville, Arkansas, where he made All-State in both football and basketball, Harris originally signed with Arkansas State to play football, but, after failing to qualify academically, he decided to switch to basketball instead. Attending Mineral Area College, Harris played basketball for two seasons, before transferring to Milwaukee for his final two eligible seasons. After playing off the bench his junior year, Harris was a starter his senior year, starting in 28 of 32 games. Despite the Panthers having a lowly 8-24 record, Harris finished 9th in the Horizon League in field goal shooting (46.9%) and led the Panthers in rebounds. After the conclusion of the basketball season, even though he had not played organized football since high school, NFL scouts showed interest in Harris playing football again, citing his size (6'7\\", 230 lb.) as ideal for the tight end position. Among the teams that showed interest in Harris included the Kansas City Chiefs, Baltimore Ravens, and Dallas Cowboys. To show off his skills for scouts, he held a workout with the Milwaukee Panthers football club team, otherwise known as MPFC.

In particular, phenomenal consciousness is thought to be higher-order representation of perceptual or quasi-perceptual contents, such as visual images. Higher-order theories are distinguished from other cognitive/representational accounts of consciousness which suggest that merely first-order mentality of certain sorts constitutes consciousness. Motivation Higher-order theory can account for the distinction between unconscious and conscious brain processing. Both types of mental operations involve first-order manipulations, and according to higher-order theory, what makes cognition conscious is a higher-order observation of the first-order processing. In neuroscience terms, higher-order theory is motivated by the distinction between first-order information in early sensory regions versus higher-order representations in prefrontal and parietal cortices. Types =Higher-order perception theory= Also called inner-sense theory, this version of higher-order theory proposes that phenomenal consciousness consists not in immediate sensations but in higher- level sensing of those sensations. Or put another way: : A phenomenally conscious mental state is a state with analog/non-conceptual intentional content, which is in turn the target of a higher-order analog/non-conceptual intentional state, via the operations of a faculty of 'inner sense'. One motivation for this approach is that it accounts for phenomenal consciousness absent beliefs or behaviors associated with those experiences‚Äîso that, e.g., someone could feel pain without necessarily exhibiting functional reactions to pain. =Actualist higher-order thought theory= David Rosenthal is a foremost advocate of this view. It claims that a mental state is conscious when it's the subject of a higher-order thought (HOT). Phenomenal consciousness in particular corresponds to certain kinds of mental states (e.g., visual inputs) that are the subjects of HOTs. Rosenthal excludes the special case in which one learns about one's lower-order states by conscious deduction. For instance, if psychoanalysis could reveal one's unconscious motives, this would not suddenly make them conscious. =Dispositionalist higher-order thought theory= The dispositionalist mirrors the actualist view except that the first-order mental state needn't actually be thought about‚Äîit only needs to be available to potentially be thought about. While actualist accounts would seem to require immense higher-order computation on all first- order percepts, dispositionalist accounts do not; they merely require availability of first-order information. Such availability could come from, e.g., global broadcasting as in the Global Workspace Theory. =Self- representational higher-order theories= Self-representational higher-order theories consider the higher-order state to be constitutive or internal to its first-order state. This may be either because # the first-order and higher- order states are identical, with the same state serving two different roles, or # the first-order and higher-order states are part of the same whole, and the whole complex is what becomes conscious. An example of the second, \\"part- whole\\" self-representational theory is Vincent Picciuto's \\"quotational theory of consciousness\\" in which consciousness consists of \\"mentally quoting\\" a first-order perception. =Higher-order statistical inference view= In this theory, higher-level processing determines that a first-order representation is reliable. =Radical plasticity thesis= Similar to a HOT view, this theory proposes that the brain \\"learns\\" when there exists a trustworthy lower- level representation. Scientific perspectives Higher-order theories originated in philosophy, but they have also gained some scientific defenders. Here are some examples of evidence supporting higher-order views: * Reporting of conscious experience seems in some studies to occur serially following unconscious processing rather than in parallel with it. * Unconscious processing is quite powerful on its own, so it's not obvious that task performance requires consciousness. Higher-order views agree with this, unlike, e.g., global-workspace views. * Impairments to the prefrontal cortex may impair subjective reports without affecting task performance. If the prefrontal cortex were mainly serving an attentional role, performance should degrade along with reportability. * Some interpretations of certain disorders of consciousness suggest that they operate by affecting the prefrontal cortex, where higher-order thoughts are assumed to take place. Edmund Rolls defends a higher-order account of consciousness. He argues that consciousness consists in higher-order thoughts allowing one to monitor and correct errors and \\"that the brain systems that are required for consciousness and language are similar.\\" Qualia like pain become conscious when \\"they enter into a specialized linguistic symbol-manipulation system, which is part of a higher- order thought system\\" that helps with, inter alia, \\"flexible planning of actions.\\" Criticisms =Against inner-sense and actualist HOT views= Scott Sturgeon argues against inner-sense theory on the grounds that it could give rise to disorders in which, e.g., one has a first-order perception of red which mis-triggers a second-order sense of \\"looks orange\\". But we don't see any such disorders in neurology. More generally, inner-sense and actualist views face the \\"targetless higher-order representation problem\\" in which there might be, e.g., a higher-order experience/thought about perceiving red without a corresponding first-order redness percept. One reply is that this is no more a problem for higher-order theories than for other neuroscientific theories of consciousness, which also involve many layers of processing that could theoretically be inconsistent. Peter Carruthers points out that inner sense of or actualist HOTs about first-order percepts might greatly increase the computing power required to consciously process stimuli, for not only does one need to have a perception, but one then needs to have another (perhaps highly detailed) perception or thought about that perception. =Against any higher- order view= The \\"rock objection\\" notes that thinking about a rock doesn't cause the rock to \\"light up\\" with consciousness, so why does thinking about a first-order percept cause it to light up? Higher-order theorists reply that first-order states need to be mental states, which rocks are not.

The book was first published in the United Kingdom on 10 October 2013 through Pan Books and was released in the United States on 15 July 2014 through St. Martin's Press. The book follows an antique appraiser that returns home, only to be confronted with the horror of Red House and with her own personal tragedies. Synopsis The book follows Catherine, a young woman with a troubled past, and is set in the present day. Through flashbacks interspersed throughout the book the reader learns about her past, which is extremely complicated. Catherine was abandoned by her birth parents in Ellyll Fields, a fictional small village near Hereford. While she did find an adoptive family, it is not a happy arrangement and they frequently questioned her mental health. Ostracized at school, Catherine only had one friend - a young mentally challenged girl named Alice that was also an outcast. They get along well until the summer of 1981, when Alice is one of several children that were kidnapped by the mysterious Pied Piper of Ellyll. Soon after her disappearance Catherine claims to have made contact with Alice's ghost, which prompts her adoptive parents to send her to therapy. As time passes a now adult Catherine forms a relationship with a man named Mike, but the relationship ends badly. Hoping to cause some change in her life, Catherine travels to London and takes a job with a prestigious TV network. However, her hoped-for change does not come to pass and she is fired from her position by a bullying co-worker named Tara. Shattered by the experience, Catherine returns home and tries to once again rebuild her life. She takes on a job as an antique appraiser for a local handicapped man named Leonard and also manages to romantically re-connect with Mike. Things seem to be going well until Catherine suffers a miscarriage, which signals the end of her relationship with Mike, although she suspects that he really left her because he was seeing another woman. After an unspecified amount of time Catherine is persuaded to take on a job cataloging the contents of Red House, the home of the late M. H. Mason, a local eccentric known for his antique dolls, puppets, and morbid taxidermy displays. Once at the house Catherine is greatly unsettled by Mason's elderly niece Edith, her maid Maude, the house, and its contents. She is pressured to stay by both Edith and Maude, and reluctantly chooses to stay, despite her own reservations about everything. That night Catherine hears several odd noises that sounds like people walking around during the night, an occurrence that Edith later tries to explain away as Maude walking about. However these noises are only the first of a series of increasingly bizarre and strange occurrences. Reception Critical reception for House of Small Shadows has been mostly positive, and the book received praise from Rue Morgue and The Independent. Tor.com and The Guardian expressed some criticism over the character of Catherine, as Tor.com found her past to be overly convoluted and The Guardian noted that her passive nature and \\"barely believable reasons why she can't or won't leave the house\\" did cause a \\"kind of stasis [that] freezes the novel\\". The Guardian gave the book a favorable review overall, while the reviewer for Tor.com commented that the character of Catherine kept them from enjoying the book as much as they would have otherwise. The reviewer for the Lancashire Evening Post gave a favorable review for the work, writing \\"Original, unsettling and genuinely scary, this is a book to be read only in daylight hours‚Ä¶\\".

Established in 1953, the 40-bed facility serves eastern Marion County and the suburbs of Salem. History A non-profit group was created in 1950 by civic leaders in the Stayton area with the goal of creating a hospital to serve the community. Funds to build the hospital were raised by subscription. In March 1953, Santiam Memorial Hospital opened. The hospital looked to expand by adding six beds in 1961 at a cost of about $90,000, but the lack of a sewer system in the city hampered the project. In 1968, the facility began working to build a helipad. On March 11, 1983, a nursing station at the hospital was robbed at gunpoint by a man seeking drugs. It was one of five hospitals in Oregon as of 2007 that did not participate in reporting errors to the Oregon Patient Safety Commission. An expansion that doubled the size of the facility ended in 2012, and the next year the name was shortened to Santiam Hospital. Operations Santiam has 40 licensed beds, and staffs all 40 of the beds. The hospital serves the eastern portions of Marion County in the Salem area. The state of Oregon classifies the hospital as a type B rural hospital. Services at the facility include emergency services, eye health, cardiology, maternity, surgery, pharmacy, radiology, breast health, cardiac rehabilitation, and orthopedic services, among others. For 2013, the hospital had a total of 1,017 discharges, with 3,643 patient days, and 10,507 emergency room visits, plus 36,559 outpatient visits. Also that year were 114 births and 403 inpatient surgeries. In 2013 Santiam Hospital had $69,539,308 in gross patient revenues, provided $1,453,998 in charity care, had $38,818,184 total in operating expenses, and an income of $79,194.

Years in Pakistan Ansari was an active member of the Shi'i scholarly community, both in the years leading up to Partition in British India and over the first decade of Pakistani independence. He served as the Secretary-General of the Punjab Shia Conference (PuSC) under British rule in the 1940s, struggling against the passivity of the organization and its inability to extract annual membership dues and regularly publish its weekly journal, Raz√¢k√¢r. Migrating to Wazirabad after Partition in 1947, Ansari was elected as the first Secretary-General of the All-Pakistan Shia Conference (APSC) in a lively contest. Ansari was intensely concerned with the state of Shi'i tabligh in these years, writing and speaking extensively on what this phenomenon's implications for the future of the Shi'ism would be. In one article from March 1956, he contends the following: Migration to Kenya Ansari left South Asia for Kenya in the 1950s, fulfilling his dream of preaching to distant, foreign Shi'i communities that he mentions in the above quote. He was already a reputed cleric by that time, but nevertheless joined a number of scholars coming from South Asia into the relatively unheard of Shia community of Kenya. After becoming a resident alim there, Ansari helped the community to become large and prosperous as it is today. He is remembered to this day in the country for an address he delivered at the Arusha Conference in December 1958, in which he emphasized the need for tabligh.Highlights of Bilal Muslim Mission of Tanzania (1965 - 1986), Page 6 A large amount of his efforts were focused on the Khoja community. Legacy Although much of Ansari's work was not published, he is still remembered all across the world. Scholars in Canada, United States, Iran, Pakistan, and Kenya, among other places, have used his works as source material. Publications A copy of KarbalƒÅ kƒ´ kahƒÅnƒ´, Qur ºƒÅn kƒ´ zabƒÅnƒ´ in Urdu Ansari is also well known for the books he has written, both in Pakistan and in Kenya, even though many of his writings have not been published. Even late into his life, he actively wrote books, usually with the help of his youngest daughter. Most of his writings are in Urdu. His works today survive in several university catalogs and libraries. Ansari is also mentioned as a source in \\"A Restatement of the History of Islam and Muslims\\" by Sayyid Ali Ashgar Razwy.

Plot Filmed in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, and exploring themes of globalization, class distinctions and income inequality, the film opens in the French seaside town of Dunkirk. France (Karin Viard), a middle-aged divorc√©e, has just been laid off after 20 years at the same shipping company. She takes an overdose of pills but is rushed to hospital and makes a complete recovery. Desperate for employment to support her three children, she moves to Paris where she connects with Ahmed (Zinedine Soualem), the father of a former co-worker. France pretends to be a low-skilled immigrant to find menial work, but is then offered the chance to be the housekeeper for St√©phane Delarue (Gilles Lellouche), a wealthy French banker who has returned to Paris after 10 years in London. The relationship between the pair is initially tense, but St√©phane eventually warms to France, especially after she proves herself an adept hand at taking care of his son for a month, an extra duty for which she is paid ‚Ç¨200 a day. The relationship between France and St√©phane turns amorous on a trip to London to meet with partners of St√©phane's firm. But the following morning France reveals how she came to his employ: she had lost her job when her shipping company moved many of its jobs to China. St√©phane, recognizing the company's name, callously admits he was one of the bankers whose shorting of the company's stock hastened the job losses. Leaving the hotel to play in the park with St√©phane's son, France then overhears him boasting and laughing about his conquest the previous night. France abducts the boy and returns to Dunkirk, holing up in an auditorium that's hosting a dance performance. St√©phane arrives to see France arrested but the crowd, many of whom are former employees of the shipping company, are made aware of St√©phane's identity and pursue him onto the beach. The mob gives chase as others form a blockade to prevent the police wagon from taking France away.

The Outre-For√™t (Unteremw√†ld in Alsatian) is a natural region which is located in the very north of Alsace, bordering on Rhineland-Palatinate. Outre-For√™t means in French beyond the forest, beyond the Haguenau Forest. To the north, it is bounded by the Bienwald as well as by the Lauter. To the east, it is bounded by the Rhine and the Petit Ried. To the west, it is bounded by the Northern Vosges and the River Falkensteinerbach. As a frontier zone off the beaten tracks, the Outre-For√™t has managed to keep its traditions; numerous timbered houses can be admired, pottery is well developed. Far away from the traditional Alsatian vineyards, grapes are grown here.

In Surbourg the altitude reaches 217 m over the sea level. To the west, the vineyard of Cleebourg shows a gentle slope.

When the Haguenau Forest was still an obstacle, and before cars ushered in a new era of mobility, the region was isolated. Therefore, the Outre-For√™t managed to better keep its traditions alive than any other adjacent region. During feasts (more precisely Streisselhochzeit in Seebach) the local folk costume is still worn. In Kutzenhausen, the museum of local traditions endeavours to show the rural life at the beginning of the 20th century. Pottery has been being practised here since the Neolithic period. Betschdorf is known for its grey and blue potteries. Grey is due to clay, whereas blue is due to cobalt.

During her 8 years' stay in the abbey, the cow became a figurehead of animal rights and a meat-free diet. The \\"Sacred Cow Animal Rights Memorial\\" was built on her grave with a life-sized statue of her. Escape from the slaughterhouse On November 14, 1995, Emily, a three-year- old heifer weighing , escaped from a slaughterhouse, A. Arena & Sons Inc, in Hopkinton by jumping a gate, minutes before she would have been killed. In record amounts of snow, Emily was spotted foraging through backyards for food. It was said that local townspeople helped the cow evade capture for 40 days. Oftentimes, she was seen running with a herd of deer, which report made headlines in local newspapers. Life at the Peace Abbey The cow was later purchased from the slaughterhouse by the Randa family, who brought Emily to live in sanctuary at the Peace Abbey on Christmas Eve.

Death and memorial Emily suffered from uterine cancer and died on March 30, 2003. A week before her death, Emily was visited and blessed by a local Hindu priest named Krishna Bhatta of the Lakshmi Temple in Ashland, Massachusetts,Sri Lakshmi Temple in Ashland, Massachusetts who placed a golden thread around her leg and one through the hole in her ear that once held the number tag when she arrived at the slaughterhouse. Emily was buried at Peace Abbey on April 2, 2003, between statues of Mother Teresa and Mahatma Gandhi. Meg and Lewis Randa commissioned artist Lado Goudjabidze to sculpt a life-sized bronze statue of Emily, adorned with a blanket and flowers, Hindu signs of respect, to stand above her grave. The statue was unveiled on Earth Day. After Emily's death, hair clippings from her markings on the forehead and from the tail tip, traces of her blood, and a piece of golden thread placed through her ear by the Hindu priest were released into river Ganges at Benares, India, in April 2003.

It was founded in 1865 under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Cleveland. It has been administered for much of its history by the Sisters of Charity of St. Augustine. The medical center has a main hospital in downtown Cleveland, with additional medical offices elsewhere in Cleveland as well as the suburbs of Independence, Rocky River, Solon and Westlake. History In 1851, the first Roman Catholic Bishop of Cleveland, Louis Amadeus Rappe, brought from his native France a small group of members of a monastery of Augustinian canonesses regular dedicated to nursing to care for the sick of his diocese. By August of the following year, they were able to open St. Joseph Hospital, the first in the city. When the senior canonesses returned to France the following month, Rappe established the two young women from the group who had chosen to remain as the new religious congregation of Sisters of Charity of St. Augustine, under the leadership of an American woman, Mother Ursula Bissonette. The Sisters continued to operate the hospital until 1856, when they closed it to focus on their work of caring for orphans. Having no hospital, Cleveland found itself in a poor position to deal with the illness and large numbers of riverboat accidents resulting from its position as a hub to the American West. The outbreak of the American Civil War presented the additional dilemma of treating returning soldiers who had been wounded in battle, needing immediate medical attention and long term nursing care. After discussion between Rappe and Bissonette, along with Gustave E. Weber, a prominent retired Army surgeon, it was felt that the time was opportune to open another hospital. The bishop approached the City Council in May 1863, proposing that the city build a hospital to care for returning veterans, which the Sisters of Charity would staff. After vocal opposition to the proposal by the press, which urged a non-sectarian facility, the majority Protestant council rejected the offer. Rappe then returned with a second proposal that he build the hospital and provide Religious Sisters to staff it, on the condition that the city provide adequate financial support. This proposal was accepted. The bishop then undertook the task of building the hospital. Land was acquired at a cost of $10,000, and the hospital was erected at a cost of $72,000, of which $42,000 came from public funds. St. Vincent Charity Hospital began operations on October 10, 1865. Growth Under Weber, who became the hospital's first chief of staff, it soon opened a medical school, Charity Hospital Medical College, which awarded its first medical degree - the first awarded in Cleveland - in 1867. In 1881, the school became a founding member of the Western Reserve Medical Department, which eventually became the Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine. A nursing school was opened to help staff the hospital's work in 1898, and two of the Sisters of Charity became among the first women in Ohio to be certified by the State Board of Pharmacy. In 1952 a new building was opened for the hospital. This included Rosary Hall Solarium, dedicated to the care of alcoholics, a service pioneered through the work of Sister Ignatia, C.S.A., a co-worker with the founders of Alcoholics Anonymous. In 2010, the hospital was renamed to St. Vincent Charity Medical Center, after the Sisters of Charity Health System regained full ownership of the hospital. In 2019, Janet Murphy was named President and CEO of the medical center.

He is known for his work in the fields of minimally invasive surgery, spleen-, gastrointestinal- and acute surgery and visceral traumatology.  Biography  Selman Uranues received his degree in 1981 from the Medical University of Graz and board certification in surgery in 1988. Upon acceptance of his postgraduate thesis he advanced to the rank of lecturer in general surgery at the same institution in 1990, and then to professor of surgery in 1996. In that same year, he was named director of the Section for Surgical Research. He has held visiting professorships in surgery at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia USA, at the Charles University in Prague, Czech Republic, Allegheny General Hospital, Pittsburgh, USA, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, USA, John Hunter Hospital of the University of Newcastle, Australiachirurgiezentrum.at and the University of the Witwatersrand, Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital, Johannesburg, South Africa.  Scientific contribution  Selman Uranues has acquired an international reputation on the basis of his work in minimally invasive surgery, visceral traumatology and acute surgery. His early interest in surgical research coincided with the introduction of laparoscopy and minimally invasive surgery. Based on his experimental studies and on the growing demand for clinical application of ever smaller instruments and sophisticated techniques, including virtual reality and robotics, of which he was an earl proponent, he played a leading role in the development of this field.S.

The book was written by Jean Dufaux, illustrated by Antoine Aubin and Etienne Schr√©der and was released in 2013. Plot The Septimus Wave is a sequel to The Yellow \\"M\\", and deals with Olrik's past with Septimus. In London, several months after the outcome of the case of the Yellow Mark, four admirers of Professor Septimus (Lieutenant McFarlane, Lady Rowana, banker Oscar Balley, and Professor Evangely) prepare to revive his work in secret. Lady Rowana is the first of two female protagonists to have a speaking part in Jacobs' publications. The second female protagonist would later appear in Jacobs' 'The Time Trap'. Colonel Olrik finds refuge in the Chinese establishment of Miss Lilly Sing, where he begins to inject himself with morphine to forget his tormented past with Septimus. During one of his panic attacks, Olrik sees Professor Septimus demanding the return of his guinea pig, Olrik. In the Centaur Club, Captain Francis Blake of MI5 is warned by his deputy Millovitch, from the Home Office, that a mad man is wandering around King's Cross station. Blake and Millovitch, along with their polices forces, locate the mad man. When the police encircle him, the mad man is suddenly struck by an electric shock. Meanwhile, Professor Philip Mortimer switches on the electric power in his laboratory in Newham, where he has rebuilt the Telecephaloscope. The Telecephaloscope was invented by Septimus. Professor Philip hopes to perfect the Telecephaloscope in order to place it at the service of psychiatry. Philip's faithful servant, Nasir, disapproves of his plans for this machine. After Professor Philip leaves the laboratory, the machine turns itself on, and Nasir sees a disturbing shape emerging from it. The next day, Blake gets furious when he learns about the nature of Mortimer's research. Busy with another matter, he asks the professor to accompany him to the interrogation of the first mad man found near King's Cross. They discover that he escaped from Bedlam Hospice where Major Banks and his men were cared for. The mad man begins to recite a litany, Mortimer recognizes the words as the litanies of Septimus's victims. Afterwards, in the street, Blake and Mortimer become victims of attempted murder by a driver whose lifeless body was found surrounded by arcs before catching fire. Plagued by a bad feeling, Mortimer returned to his laboratory. Here, Nasir tells him about the disturbing shape that he saw emerging underneath the machine; he saw Septimus' spectrum coming out of the Telecephaloscope. Meanwhile, Professor Septimus, who was brought back by the Telecephaloscope, quietly walks through Bloomsbury in search of his next guinea pig. Mr. Kim Ku-Dum, a former interrogator of the Yellow Army, hypnotized Olrik at Miss Sing's place to help him break free of his demons. Olrik then sees a crowd demanding the return of Septimus and Professor Mortimer reactivating Telecephaloscope. Motivated by these visions, Olrik tries to escape, but Miss Sing is waiting outside to present him to Lieutenant McFarlane. At Bedlam Hospice, Blake and Mortimer find Major Blanks and his team rushing to prepare for an enemy attack. Blanks tells them that he sent two of his men to the abandoned hangars near King's Cross to find the mysterious machine. When Blake and Mortimer decide to leave, Major Blanks and his men fall to their knees and start reciting the litany of Septimus. Blake decides to explore the basement of the abandoned warehouse near King‚Äôs Cross in search of the machine. Within that basement, Blake discovers a metal door. After opening it, Blake and his men enter a huge cave with a giant unknown craft resembling a spaceship. Stepping into the craft, Blake suddenly finds himself in the reading room of the British Museum. Blake inspects the bookshelves and realizes that all of the books surrounding him are copies of ‚ÄòThe Mega Wave‚Äô by Septimus. After touching one of the books, Blake is struck by an electric shock and falls to the floor. The British Museum suddenly vanishes and is replaced by a single glass column. Blake approaches the glass column and sees a scuba diver staring back at him. The scuba diver is attached to the spaceship-like craft with wires and tubes. At the same moment, Mortimer appears to be in a taxi on his way to Lady Rowana, who invited him to attend a private party that included the four admirers of Septimus. He discovers that they too have rebuilt a Telecephaloscope. The admirers then demonstrate they have recovered Olrik as a guinea pig. Knowing their evil intentions, Mortimer damages the machine before being knocked out. Meanwhile, Oscar Balley arrives late for the party. He has had some troubles outside and he tells the rest to take a look out the window. A horde of Septimuses march outside the warehouse looking for Olrik, their guinea pig. Oscar has been touched by one of the Septimuses outside. Shortly after that, he disappears in a cloud of thick smoke and Septimus appears in his place. In their cell, Olrik and Mortimer decide to ally temporarily to be able to escape, but Lady Rowana releases them to show them the entirety of the situation. The professor makes the assumption that there is another mega wave generator that stimulated the Telecephaloscope, and that the image of Septimus, kept in memory, intends to replicate indefinitely. The horde of Septimuses break through the door, they manage to escape via the sewers. Mortimer takes Olrik to his lab in hopes of finding a way to end the phenomenon. At 10 Downing Street, the Prime Minister tells Captain Blake that the mysterious craft, Orpheus, was discovered by Major Blanks's team during the last war and that its existence is to be kept a secret in order to facilitate a study by scientists. Blake decides to destroy the Orpheus and gets inside with explosives without listening to his superiors. In the laboratory, Professor Mortimer uses the Telecephaloscope on Olrik to give him control over the Mega Wave, and thus over the source of the clones of Septimus. Olrik enters the spaceship via the Mega wave and orders Colonel Blake and his men to leave. The diver tries to get control over the situation and keeps saying the word ‚ÄôAsylum‚Äô. Olrik manages to resist the orders of the mysterious diver and triggers the explosion. The Orpheus ship explodes and disappears in a column of light. A few days later, Blake and Mortimer discuss their adventure, while Olrik (who hasn‚Äôt recovered from his experience) finds himself interned in Bedlam Hospice with Major Blanks and his team.

The officer in charge tells Hanne Lindberg, Head of the Cyber Division of Europol, that Benjamin asked for her to do the interrogation. Benjamin says that he has information regarding FRI3NDS, a notorious hacking group of four members connected to the Russian cyber mafia, and MRX, an infamous hacker known on Darknet; he tells her that he could give them both to Hanne if she listens to him. Having no choice, Hanne sits down. Benjamin tells Hanne how he is like a superhero: like many heroes, he too has no parents; he never met his father as he abandoned the family when Benjamin was born, and his mother committed suicide when he was 8. He lives alone with his ailing grandmother. He regards his \\"superpower\\" as invisibility, as he was never noticed by most people during his childhood due to him being socially awkward.

Hearing her having trouble with exams, he decided to help her and be a 'superhero'. He went to the University, hacked into its servers to download the exam questions, but he was caught by a security guard and arrested. Having no prior criminal record, he was forced to perform community service as a punishment. He tells Hanne that while working on cleaning the streets as punishment, he met Max, a fellow hacker, who Benjamin feels is the opposite of himself; a charismatic, cocky and confident individual. Later, Max had introduced him to his colleagues Stephan and Paul. After Benjamin proved himself as a hacker, Max explained to him that the concept of social engineering is the greatest form of hacking. They decide to form a hacking group, called \\"Clowns Laughing At You\\", nicknamed CLAY, and they use Benjamin's house as a base of operations, since Benjamin was forced to send his grandmother to a nursing home due to her Alzheimer's disease. They cause general mayhem around Berlin in a form of pranking, becoming popular around social media. However, MRX, with whom is Max obsessed, mocks them outright. Infuriated, Max wants to perform a more outrageous feat of hacking, and Benjamin suggest hacking the main building of BND (German Central Intelligence). Impressed by this outrageous idea, the group agrees with Benjamin and decide to hack the BND in order to impress MRX. Using dumpster diving and phishing to gain access to the BND building, they manage to hack the internal servers and hack the printers to print their logo titled \\"NO SYSTEM IS SAFE\\" all around the building, impressing MRX. However, when they go to a club and celebrate, Benjamin notices Max kissing Marie. Infuriated, Benjamin refuses to let them in the house, also offending Marie when she visits him due to his anger. Feeling inferior, he secretly contacts MRX, offering him valuable info; database from BND's private servers, in which he hacked in while he was in the BND building, which impresses MRX. When the group arrives the next day, Benjamin is still furious, and attacks Max; who responds by beating him up. However, Paul, watching the TV, hears on the news that one of the members of FRI3NDS, nicknamed Krypton, was murdered. Benjamin admits that he gave the info from the BND to MRX, and after checking them, realizes that the info identified Krypton as a double agent working with Hanne to expose MRX and FRI3NDS, and CLAY is now labeled as a terrorist group for hacking the info. Seeking to clear their name for the murder, Benjamin contacts MRX, who instructs them to hack into the Europol database in exchange for MRX's identity, giving them a hacking tool to help. After dissolving their hard drives in acid to erase data, they travel to Europol's headquarters in The Hague in order to try and break their way in, but it's impossible to find a way inside: they dump their trash in secured building, the sewers are locked, and phishing attempts failed. However, while checking out the building, Benjamin notices a group of scholars visiting the building, and one of them drops his visitor card; using Max's advice about social engineering, Benjamin manages to gain access to the building by fooling a guard and plants a hacking device inside. He then hacks into the internal Europol servers and provides MRX with an entrance; secretly encoded inside a double trojan horse so MRX will be exposed when he tries to gain access. However, MRX, anticipating this, takes a snapshot of Benjamin via his webcam, exposing him. Benjamin is forced to flee when a group of Russian mobsters find him; he evades them in the subway. Benjamin returns to the hotel where he was staying with the trio, only to find them murdered. Having no other choice and knowing that FRI3NDS would kill him, he decided to turn himself in to Hanne, proving that he is serious after stating that he hacked her profile and learned personal information about her. Hanne, who was suspended for her failure to capture them and is desperate to apprehend FRI3NDS and MRX, agrees to put Benjamin into a witness protection program in exchange for capturing them; Benjamin logs in as MRX himself and spreads lies about MRX being a snitch, forcing the real MRX to force his way into the Darknet servers with unsafe methods, allowing Benjamin to expose him; MRX is exposed as a 19-year old American man from New York City, whom the FBI arrests in a coffee shop. However, after agreeing to give Benjamin the witness exchange program for him, Hanne notices a wound going through his palm (the same wound that Max got after running a nail through his hand), and realizes that Max, Stephan and Paul are all made up characters. Distraught, she visits Benjamin's doctor, who states that his mother had multiple personality disorder and committed suicide because of it, learning that it can be genetically passed. She connects various plot holes in Benjamin's story and realizes that he alone was CLAY: he committed all the atrocities, he hacked into the BND alone, and he planted the WWII bullets from his grandmothers in the hotel to make it look like they were killed, imagining the trio due to his illness. Hanne confronts Benjamin, who has an emotional breakdown, as people with mental disorders cannot be given witness protection. However, Hanne changes her mind and allows him access to the witness protection program, revealed to be an actual program containing information about all citizens of Germany; Benjamin changes his identity here. Hanne, dropping Benjamin off, states that she let him go because he truly wants to stay invisible, and lets him go on the condition that he never hacks again. Benjamin, now sporting blonde hair, is standing alone on a Scandlines ferry heading north. However, he is suddenly joined by Marie, Max, Stephan and Paul. In narration, Benjamin states that he performed \\"the greatest social engineering hack\\" ever; the scene shifts back to Benjamin going back to the hotel, finding the guys alive and well; he instructs them to flee since MRX knows his identity, but they refuse to leave him behind. After Marie visits them and confirms that mentally ill subjects cannot be granted witness protection, they devise a plan for Benjamin to go to Hanne and dictate the story, deliberately giving plot holes which she will most likely dechiper, and then using her grief for him in order to give him access to the witness protection program, and also spiking his hand with a nail to make the story seem truthful. In the server room, it was revealed that Benjamin didn't change his identity, he erased it completely. Benjamin states that Hanne will eventually realize his deception, but she won't hunt him down as she got what she wanted. Indeed, at a press conference announcing the defeat of FRI3NDS and MRX, Hanne, having an epiphany, smiles as she realizes the truth.

Weidberg (died 1986) was a socialist writer and speaker based in Manchester and London. Early Life Weidberg was raised in Manchester in petty-bourgeois Jewish family with strict religious ideas. In the 1930s, at the age of seventeen, he developed an interest in leftist politics. He attended a meeting of Stafford Cripps's Labour Party splinter group, but quickly became disillusioned with the speakers (including a young Barbara Castle) whom he judged to be motivated more by self-interest than genuine concern for the betterment of society. Career After about a year of perusing literature from various left-wing groups, he stumbled upon the Socialist Party of Great Britain's journal, The Socialist Standard, and was instantly convinced. Soon after, he joined the SPGB, and served as a regular writer for the Standard and as an outdoor speaker at Speakers' Corner and Lincoln's Inn. Weidberg had a reputation for being caustic, sharp-witted, and provocative, and he harboured a particular hatred for The Guardian. Besides dismissing the newspaper's overall tone as \\"half-baked lefty crap\\", he led an eleven-year campaign to challenge its report that snow had fallen during a Lord's cricket match on 2 June 1975. The complaint made it all the way to the Press Council, which eventually ruled in favour of the newspaper. This was not the first time Weidberg had made the news in connection with a complaint about Lord's: at a match earlier in the 1970s, he removed his shirt to enjoy the sunshine, and refused a steward's order to put it back on. He complained to the Marylebone Cricket Club, which ruled that Weidberg was free to go topless so long as he remained motionless. Death Laurie Weidberg died in 1986 after a long illness.

Retrieved 31 August 2014. Walter Scott of Branxholme and Buccleuch attempted to rescue the young James V of Scotland from the powerful Archibald Douglas, 6th Earl of Angus. Background Guardianship of the young James V of Scotland had been secured by Archibald Douglas, 6th Earl of Angus in what was supposed to be a three monthly arrangement whereby each of the four members of the Council of Regency would care for James.Battle of Melrose 1378 and 1526 douglashistory.co.uk. Retrieved 31 August 2014. However, Douglas refused to hand James over to the Earl of Arran whose turn it was next. James sent a message out to Sir Walter Scott asking him to launch a rescue attempt. The young King James, while being escorted on a journey to Edinburgh by Douglas was intercepted by a large body of Border Reivers led by Sir Walter Scott at Melrose. Battle Angus's force mainly consisted of Kerrs and stood its ground, managing to drive off the attackers. Scott led as many as 1000 men down Eildon Hill at Melrose. Angus‚Äôs men charged and Scott‚Äôs men stood their ground also. However, the Lord Hume arrived with a reinforcement of 80 Kerrs to support Angus, they attacked the wing of Scott's force afresh, and the Scotts and Eliotts began to fall back and run. During the pursuit Andrew Kerr of Cessford was killed by one of the Eliotts. Scott lost about 80 of his men while the Earl of Angus lost about 100, but still won the battle. Aftermath The young King James stayed at Darnick Tower on the night following the battle and proceeded to Edinburgh the next day. In the aftermath of the Battle of Melrose a deadly feud raged for many years in the Scottish Borders between the Kerrs and Scotts due to the death of Andrew Kerr, Laird of Cessford at the battle.

Location The factories of Osukuru Industrial Complex are located in the Sukulu Hills in Osukuru County, Tororo District, Eastern Region of Uganda, just outside the town of Tororo and approximately , by road, east of Kampala, the capital and largest city of Uganda. The approximate coordinates of the Osukuru Industrial Complex are: 0¬∞37'25.0\\"N, 34¬∞09'13.0\\"E (Latitude:0.623611; Longitude:34.153611). Overview The industrial complex will consist of (1) a phosphate fertilizer factory, (2) a steel manufacturing factory, (3) a sulphuric acid manufacturing factory, (4) a rare earth minerals mining plant, and (5) the Osukuru Thermal Power Station with capacity generation of 12 megawatts. In addition, the complex includes the largest organic fertilizer factory in East Africa, with capacity of 300,000 metric tonnes of organic fertiliser annually. The industrial complex sits on of land in Osukuru sub-county and in neighboring Rubongi sub-county, Tororo District, close to the international border with Kenya. The industrial complex will support over 1,700 jobs once completed. History A considerable amount of minerals, particularly flint, phosphorus and iron, have been known to exist in the Sukulu Hills south-west of the town of Tororo as far back as 1954. Starting around 2008, the government of Uganda, began engaging various investors, including a local firm Nilefos Limited, a subsidiary of the Madhvani Group, to commercially exploit the deposits. Local landowners in the mining area, however, filed a lawsuit against the government, protesting the development. The landowners lost that case in 2010. In 2013, the government began negotiations with Guangzhou Dong Song Energy Company Limited from China to set up a mining and manufacturing operation at Osukuru. In 2014, the government and landowners agreed that exploration and construction should begin. Construction timeline The project will cost an estimated US$560 million to US$620 million and will be jointly owned by the Government of Uganda and Guangzhou Dong Song Energy Company Limited, a private Chinese company. Construction began in 2014 and was expected to last two years. Commissioning was expected during the fourth quarter of 2016. After delays, construction resumed in October 2015, starting with office blocks and staff housing. Construction is by the 23rd Metallurgical Construction Group Company Limited. When fully operational, the industrial complex is expected to employ more than 1,000 people. Funding is provided by China Export & Credit Insurance Corporation (SINOSURE) and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC). In February 2016, the developers reached financial closure with ICBC for a loan worth US$240 million. Some of the industries in the complex are expected to be commissioned in October 2018. Starting operations In March 2018, the industrial complex advertised the first 92 jobs, looking to hire welders, storekeepers, drivers, security guards and supervisors. The MoU that Guangzhou Dongsong Energy Group signed with the government calls for employing people from Tororo District first, going outside the district only when the desired skills or expertise are lacking. In August 2018, Irene Muloni, Uganda's Minister of Energy, commissioned the Uganda-China Guangdong Free Zone for International Cooperation, in which the Osukuru Industrial Complex is located. During the same month, Matia Kasaija, Uganda's Finance Minister, commissioned the fertilizer plant, with the steel plant expected online in July 2019. As of August 2018, the industrial complex employed about 1,000 people. The phosphate fertilizer plant was commissioned on 23 October 2018. Steel production is expected to begin in July 2019. The first phase of the development is expected to employ an estimated 1,400 people at completion. This number s expected to rise to 3,000 people after completion of the second phase. In November 2018, the Daily Monitor reported that a brick-baking division, embedded within the industrial complex was operational and manufactured 10,000 building bricks daily, with capacity production of 2.6 million bricks annually.

Kizil Kilise, the Red Church, also known as Sivrihisar Kizil Kilise to distinguish it from other structures called Kizil Kilise, is a partially ruined sixth-century church in the G√ºzelyurt district of Aksaray Province, Turkey. The church takes its name from the red stone used to build it. The building has been listed in the World Monuments Watch since 2008. Background Probably erected in the sixth century during the reign of the Byzantine Emperor Justinian I (r. 527‚Äì565), the edifice is one of the oldest Christian shrines of the Cappadocia region. The church was possibly dedicated to Saint Gregory of Nazianzus, one of the fathers of the Cappadocian church. In central and eastern Cappadocia, 5th and 6th-century churches with cross- shaped plans were standard.R. Krautheimer, \\"Early Christian and Byzantine Architecture\\", 1986, p164. Kizil Kilise follows this plan form, using local volcanic stones cut into regular blocks by highly skilled workers. Architecturally, the most characteristic element of the church is its central dome, erected above an octagonal drum. Eight windows pierce the drum, flooding the nave with light. The only later addition to the building is the narthex; otherwise the church, albeit damaged, still retains its original form. The presence of huge lintels finished off using a highly professional technique hints to a usage as an imperial or burial chapel. Pilgrims traversing Anatolia on the way to Jerusalem along an ancient route could readily reach the church. Gertrude Bell (1868‚Äì1926), the British archaeologist and writer, photographed and measured Kizil Kilise in 1907. Reconstruction activities In 2011 a program of reconstruction work began at the church. International fundraising raised 500,000 to finance the work. ƒ∞smet Aƒüaryƒ±lmaz, a retired professor who previously taught restoration techniques at Yƒ±ldƒ±z Technical University, directed the project.

A year later when the First War of Independence spread to Lucknow and the sepoys installed one of his sons to the throne of Awadh, Wajid Ali Shah was imprisoned in Fort William by the British along with his Prime Minister, due to the fear that he could become a rallying figure for the sepoys.

It was opened in 1976 to replace the Old Burke County Courthouse.\\"A History of Burke County\\". Carolana. Lewis, J.D. . Accessed 29 August 2015. The old courthouse, in use by 1837, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  Old Burke County Courthouse  The Old Burke County Courthouse is the historic courthouse building located at 102 East Union Street in Morganton. It was built in 1833‚Äì1835 at cost of $15,000, and is a two-story, square stone building on a raised basement in the Classical Revival style. It features pedimented porticos on two sides and an elaborate cupola added during a remodeling in 1901. Shortly before the end of the American Civil War a detachment of Union cavalry raided the building in April 1865, as part of Stoneman's 1865 Raid, and destroyed much of the county's records. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970. and is located in the Morganton Downtown Historic District.  History  The Old Burke County Courthouse is the historic courthouse at 102 East Union Street on the courthouse lawn in the center of Morganton, North Carolina. It houses the old courtroom, used for lectures, meetings and events as well as the Heritage Museum and office of Historic Burke Foundation, Inc. \\"In 1830, the Burke County Court of Pleas and Quarter Sessions decided that the County needed a new courthouse to replace the \\"shabby, weather-beaten\\" plank courthouse that had been built on the public square in 1791. The General Assembly of 1830-31 authorized it to spend $8,000 and named five commissioners to oversee the construction. In the 1832-33 sessions, the General Assembly increased the amount to $12,000. James Binnie, a Scottish builder, was awarded the contract in 1833. He built the courthouse of native stone quarried on the Forney plantation about four miles north of Morganton. Frederick Roderick, a German stonemason who later established his home in Burke County, assisted Mr. Binnie with the construction. The building was put into use in 1837. From 1847 until 1862, the North Carolina Supreme Court held its August session in the courthouse for the convenience of lawyers from the western part of the state who were arguing appeals from the Superior Courts of their respective counties. During the Civil War, on April 17, 1865, Major General George Stoneman occupied the building and destroyed most of the County's records. In 1885, the exterior of the building was covered with stucco, and in 1903, a major renovation designed by architect Frank Milburn of Columbia, SC raised the porticos and replaced the simple classical cupola with an elaborate one of Baroque style, giving the courthouse its present appearance. A monument to Burke County's Confederate Army troops was erected on the northwest corner of the Square in 1911 and was paid for by public subscription. The bronze statue of the soldier was added in 1918. The statue was a gift from Captain William Joseph Kincaid, a Burke County Confederate soldier, who settled in Griffin, Georgia after the war. Also found on the Square is a memorial rose garden given in memory of Bob Byrd (1930‚Äì2001), a prominent Burke County attorney and a statue of Sam Ervin, a Burke County native, who served in the US Senate from 1954 to 1974. The courthouse was in continuous use until 1976 when the present Burke County Courthouse was completed. The effort to preserve the Old Courthouse began in 1978. The restoration, completed in 1984, was accomplished with the joint efforts of Burke County, the City of Morganton, and Historic Burke Foundation. The North Carolina Supreme Court met in the Old Chowan County Courthouse in Edenton in 2004, and again in 2013. In 2015, Governor McCrory signed Senate Bill 161 into law (S.L. 2015-89), allowing the court to meet in Morganton once again, \\"‚Ä¶the court shall meet in the Old Burke County Courthouse, the location of summer sessions of the Supreme Court from 1847-1862.\\"\\" References  External links  * \\"Burke County - District 25A\\", North Carolina Court System Category:County courthouses in North Carolina Category:Courthouses on the National Register of Historic Places in North Carolina Category:Government buildings completed in 1835 Category:Buildings and structures in Burke County, North Carolina Category:National Register of Historic Places in Burke County, North Carolina Category:Historic district contributing properties in North Carolina ","title":"Burke County Courthouse (North Carolina)"},{"id":"43704741","text":"The following is a List of awards received by Vishnuvardhan throughout his acting career. ;Filmfare Awards South Filmfare Award for Best Kannada Actor - 4 times: * Naagarahaavu - 1973 Special Award * Bandhana - 1984 Special Award * Suprabhatha - 1988 Best Actor * Haalunda Thavaru - 1994 (Best Actor)https://archive.is/20170207135501/https://archive.org/details/42ndFilmfareKannadaBestActorActressWinners * Yajamana - 2000 (Best Actor) * Apthamitra - 2004 (Best Actor) * Filmfare Lifetime Achievement Award - 2002.http://www.hollywood.com/news/celebrities/6390775/indian-film-star- vishnuvardhan- dies?page=allhttp://m.facebook.com/profile.php?v=info&expand;=1&id;=198717606848253http://www.viggy.com/english/current_filmfare_award_2004.asphttps://www.imdb.com/title/tt0310102/news ;Karnataka State Film Awards Karnataka State Film Awards for the Best Actor Category: Seven Timeshttp://timesofap.com/cinema/vishnuvardhan-anu-prabhakar- bag-karantaka-state-awards.htmlhttp://ibnlive.in.com/news/vishnuvardhan-bags- best-actor-award-posthumously/194892-8-71.html * Naagarahaavu ‚Äì 1972-73 * Hombisilu ‚Äì 1977-78 * Bandhana ‚Äì 1984-85 * Lion Jagapathi Rao ‚Äì 1990-91 * Laali ‚Äì 1997-98 * Veerappa Nayaka ‚Äì 1998-99 * Aaptha Rakshaka ‚Äì 2009-10 (Posthumously) * Lifetime achievement Award Dr. Rajkumar State Award - 2008 ;Cinema Express Awards Cinema Express Awards for the Best Actor Category: * Suprabhatha ‚Äì 1988 - (Best Actor) * Yajamana ‚Äì 2000 - (Best Actor) ;Other awards * Honorary Doctorate awarded by Bangalore University in 2005 * Aragini Reader's Award * Suvarna Lifetime Achievement Award for Contribution To Kannada Cinema 2008Suvarna Film Awards * Tarangini Berkley Award * Indira Pratishtana National Award * V Shantaram award Best Actor for Parva * Kaladevi Award (Chennai)Kannada Cinema's Greatest Actor.

Blaisdell (September 4, 1910 ‚Äì May 1, 2007) was an American minister and United States Air Force Chaplain colonel who organised the so- called \\"Kiddy Car Airlift,\\" the rescue of 964 orphans and 80 orphanage staff from Seoul in the face of the Chinese advance during the Korean War on December 20, 1950. Education He graduated from Hayfield High School, Hayfield, Minnesota in 1927 and received his BA from Macalester College in 1934 and his Master's of Divinity from McCormick Theological Seminary in 1937. Personal life USAF career Blaisdell joined the United States Army Air Corps in July 1940 and was stationed at Fort Sheridan, Illinois until October 1940. He later served at Fort George Wright from 1940-42\\\\. He served as chaplain and base chaplain at Edmonton Alberta for units building the Alaska Highway from 1942-4 and from 1944-6 at Pacific Wing ATC, Hickam Field from where he visited USAAF units in the Pacific Theater of Operations. Following World War II, in 1946 he was stationed at Scott Air Force Base and then at HQ Eighth Air Force, Carswell Air Force Base until 1950. With the outbreak of the Korean War he was assigned to HQ Fifth Air Force, Korea from July 1950 to May 1951. Following the Inchon Landing and the recapture of Seoul in September 1950 then Lieutenant Colonel Blaisdell and another chaplain, Colonel Wallace I. Wolverton began attending to war orphans in the Seoul area. Initially the orphans were placed in a Seoul orphanage, but as the number of orphans continued to increase, the two together with Blaisdell's chaplain's assistant Staff Sergeant Merle \\"Mike\\" Y. Strang and Korean social workers established the Orphans Processing Center, eventually providing food and shelter for over 1000 orphans. After Wolverton left South Korea, Blaisdell continued to manage the center. =Operation Kiddy Car= In December 1950 as the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and North Korean forces threatened Seoul with their Second Phase Campaign, UN forces, including the Fifth Air Force, began to evacuate the city and move further south. On 19 December, Lieutenant Colonel Blaisdell and Staff Sergeant Strang drove the orphans to Inchon harbor for evacuation by Navy LST to Jeju Island, but the vessels failed to arrive. Blaisdell then approached Colonel T.C. Rogers, the 5th Air Force Director of Operations, who arranged for transport aircraft to evacuate the orphans from Kimpo Air Base the following morning. Blaisdell then commandeered a company of Marine Corps trucks to transport the children and their Korean caregivers to Kimpo. Despite arriving at Kimpo more than two hours late, the orphans were evacuated to safety on Jeju Island aboard 16 C-54 Skymaster aircraft. An orphanage was established on Jeju and run by Whang On-soon until the end of the Korean War, when it was relocated back to Seoul. The events surrounding the airlift became widely known outside Korea only when Dean Hess published his autobiography, Battle Hymn, in 1956, which later served as the basis for the 1957 film of the same name, where Hess was played by Rock Hudson. Staff Sergeant Strang later wrote and asked Blaisdell's advice on whether he should \\"blow the whistle\\" on Hess's limited role in the evacuation; Blaisdell responded, \\"The goal of our efforts, in regard to the orphans ... was the saving of lives, which would otherwise have been lost. That was accomplished. In a sense, Mike, well-doing has its own reward, which is not measured in dollars, prestige, or goodwill...\\" In 2004, Dr. George F. Drake took issue with Dean Hess's portrayal of the Kiddy Car Airlift, claiming that Hess took more credit than he deserved. Drake gave Blaisdell and Strang the credit for the evacuation, with Hess's role being reduced to providing accommodation on Jeju itself. According to this criticism, Blaisdell was reportedly originally credited with the evacuation by the media until Battle Hymn was published. Drake termed Hess' claims as \\"fraudulent\\", but acknowledged that the proceeds from Battle Hymn and royalties from the movie were donated to aid Korean orphans.

He then served as Command Chaplain at Tactical Air Command, Langley Air Force Base from 1960-2 and HQ, Military Airlift Command, Scott Air Force Base from 1962-4. Colonel Blaisdell retired from the USAF on 30 June 1964. Later life He served as representative of the New York State Department of Social Services from 1966 to 1977. He retired to Fayetteville, New York, wintering in Las Vegas, Nevada, where he died on May 1, 2007. He is buried at the Veterans Cemetery, Boulder City, Nevada. Awards and honors Blaisdell returned to South Korea in 2001, where he was greeted by Lee Hee-ho, the First Lady of South Korea, awarded an honorary Doctorate of Social Welfare by Kyung Hee University and referred to in the Korean media as the \\"Schindler\\" of Korea. He was also reunited with Whang On-soon, then aged 102, whose family continues to operate the Seoul Orphanage. SSGT Mike Strang died in 1998 without ever receiving any official recognition for his role in saving the orphans, but he was posthumously awarded the Bronze Star in 2003.

History The Ravenscraig Quarry (55.695026 -4.668213) to Jameston Quarry (55.683808 -4.678430) line was a 'Bogey Line' using 'bogeys' or small waggons that transported freestone (sandstone) to another freestone quarry at Jameston near Auchenskeith for transfer into standard gauge waggons and onward transport via the standard gauge Glasgow and South-Western Railway's Dalry to Kilmarnock line. Probably mainly worked by gravity, manually and by horses, the width of the fairly substantial surviving embankments and some vague cuttings suggests that it was a narrow gauge rather than a standard gauge line. The Ordnance Survey maps of the time show that it existed after 1856 and was abandoned by 1895. Jameston Quarry was also disused by 1895 and has since been infilled.Rail Map online1896 OS 25 inch to the mile Old maps show that prior to the railways construction stone could be taken away via North Lissens farm or across the Gorbie Glen and away via Asseyfaulds Cottage. Infrastructure Typical narrow gauge railway waggons for carrying stone The 1.25 mile or 2 kilometers long line ran roughly north from Jameston Quarry with low embankments1897 OS 25 inch to the mile until it crossed the Lissens to Blair Mill road from where it cut across the field on a low embankment at first, progressing as quite a substantial embanked trackbed and at the end of the line branching into two sidings, again on embankments that ran to the western side of the quarry workings. The Railway and quarries today The final section of embankments leading to Ravenscraig Quarry are largely untouched whilst they have been ploughed out in the field facing South Lissens Farm, but a section of cutting remains below South Lissens Farm and the trackbed survives as a farm track as far as the site of the infilled Jameston Quarry. Ravenscraig Quarry is now flooded but otherwise unchanged and is known locally as the 'Blue Waters' or 'Blue Hole'Three Towners Forum because the light shining off the dark vertical faces of the quarry workings once embued the floodwater with a striking blue colour. The site was at one time a popular swimming hole however a drowning incident ended that and although rich in water plants such as the marestail (Hippuris) and pondweeds (Potamogeton the water has lost its blue colour and serves as an unofficial wildlife preserve. No rails or sleepers remain at the site.

Pillow (1806 in Williamson County, Tennessee ‚Äì 1878 in Mound Plantation, Phillips County, Arkansas), that owned Clifton Place, and Major Granville A.

Dale, whose daughter Elvira had married Jerome's son, Jerome Bonaparte (Jr.) Pillow designed and built the mansion that was very similar to both the other homes. All three mansions were two-story with pedimented portico's, columns that went from the top to the ground. The Pillow-Bethel House (as were the others) was constructed from brick made on the property and besides the house there were servants quarters, a detached kitchen, carriage barn, and stables. There was also a small building thought to be a law office. Captain William Decatur Bethel married one of Jerome's daughters thus giving the name Pillow-Bethel House to the property.
