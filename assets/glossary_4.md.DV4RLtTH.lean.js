The use of random permutations is often fundamental to fields that use randomized algorithms such as coding theory, cryptography, and simulation. A good example of a random permutation is the shuffling of a deck of cards: this is ideally a random permutation of the 52 cards. Generating random permutations=Entry-by-entry brute force method One method of generating a random permutation of a set of length n uniformly at random (i.e., each of the n! permutations is equally likely to appear) is to generate a sequence by taking a random number between 1 and n sequentially, ensuring that there is no repetition, and interpreting this sequence (x1, ..., xn) as the permutation : \\\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 & \\\\cdots & n \\\\ x_1 & x_2 & x_3 & \\\\cdots & x_n \\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix}, shown here in two- line notation. This brute-force method will require occasional retries whenever the random number picked is a repeat of a number already selected. This can be avoided if, on the ith step (when x1, ..., xi ‚àí 1 have already been chosen), one chooses a number j at random between 1 and n ‚àí i + 1 and sets xi equal to the jth largest of the unchosen numbers. Fisher-Yates shuffles A simple algorithm to generate a permutation of n items uniformly at random without retries, known as the Fisher‚ÄìYates shuffle, is to start with any permutation (for example, the identity permutation), and then go through the positions 0 through n ‚àí 2 (we use a convention where the first element has index 0, and the last element has index n ‚àí 1), and for each position i swap the element currently there with a randomly chosen element from positions i through n ‚àí 1 (the end), inclusive. It's easy to verify that any permutation of n elements will be produced by this algorithm with probability exactly 1/n!, thus yielding a uniform distribution over all such permutations. unsigned uniform(unsigned m); /* Returns a random integer 0 <= uniform(m) <= m-1 with uniform distribution */ void initialize_and_permute(unsigned permutation[], unsigned n) { unsigned i; for (i = 0; i <= n-2; i++) { unsigned j = i+uniform(n-i); /* A random integer such that i ‚â§ j < n */ swap(permutation[i], permutation[j]); /* Swap the randomly picked element with permutation[i] */ } } Note that if the \`uniform()\` function is implemented simply as \`random() % (m)\` then a bias in the results is introduced if the number of return values of \`random()\` is not a multiple of m, but this becomes insignificant if the number of return values of \`random()\` is orders of magnitude greater than m. Statistics on random permutations=Fixed points The probability distribution of the number of fixed points in a uniformly distributed random permutation approaches a Poisson distribution with expected value 1 as n grows. In particular, it is an elegant application of the inclusion‚Äìexclusion principle to show that the probability that there are no fixed points approaches 1/e. When n is big enough, the probability distribution of fixed points is almost the Poisson distribution with expected value 1. The first n moments of this distribution are exactly those of the Poisson distribution.  Randomness testing  As with all random processes, the quality of the resulting distribution of an implementation of a randomized algorithm such as the Knuth shuffle (i.e., how close it is to the desired uniform distribution) depends on the quality of the underlying source of randomness, such as a pseudorandom number generator. There are many possible randomness tests for random permutations, such as some of the Diehard tests. A typical example of such a test is to take some permutation statistic for which the distribution is known and test whether the distribution of this statistic on a set of randomly generated permutations closely approximates the true distribution.

The town was established as Ellisras in 1960 and named after Patrick Ellis and Piet Erasmus who settled on a farm there in the 1930s. In 2002, Ellisras was renamed Lephalale by the provincial government of Limpopo, after the main river that crosses the municipality. Lephalale is divided into three main subsections, Ellisras, Onverwacht and Marapong. Lephalale is derived from the setswana language meaning \\"to flow\\". History=1550 to 1750 Late Iron Age cattle posts belonging to the Letsibogo ceramic facies have been found in the area. Some rock engravings at Nelsonkop have been recorded. 1930s The name Ellisras origins from a combination of the surnames of Patric Ellis and Piet Erasmus who settled in the 1930s on the farm Waterkloof 502LQ. Since the opening of the main route between Vaalwater and Stockpoort during 1929 a railway bus stop developed on the farm. The central function of the newly established nodes became more evident and other facilities such as schools, churches and shops were established on the farm. Subdivision of the farm started and due to the specific locality of the river, all newly created portions have a river frontage which had a definite influence on the urban form/shape of Ellisras today. 1940s In 1941, the Geological Survey Division of the then Department of Mining, launched an exploration programme. Iscor, the country's largest steel producer, and also the biggest consumer of coking coal, actively participated in this programme. 1950s Drilling was completed in 1952. In 1957, Iscor obtained the surface rights to six farms, including Grootegeluk. 1960s The first townships that were proclaimed in Ellisras were: Ellisras (Proper) - 7 December 1960 Ellisras Extension 1‚Äì5 May 1965 Ellisras Extension 2‚Äì3 November 1971 1970s A major influence on the growth of the farm Waterkloof 502LQ was the decision of Iscor in 1973 to continue with the development of the Grootegeluk Coal Mine. Work commenced in December 1974 on building the mine and one year later in December 1975, the actual quarrying of the mine commenced. 1980s Grootegeluk mine was officially opened on 15 April 1981. On 3 March 1982 this mine was in full operation for the first time. Mokolo Dam (previously known as the Hans Strijdom Dam) was constructed in 1979-1980 on the Mokolo River, near Lephalale. The Malmanie River and the Bulspruit River, two tributaries of the Mokolo, also enter the dam from its left side. The dam mainly serves municipal and industrial purposes. Since Iscor became part of Ellisras, Eskom also decided to extend its interest to Ellisras seeing that the steam coal produced is suitable for use in power stations and is used for the generation of steam. It happened by a decision by Eskom to build the air-cooled Matimba Power Station in close vicinity of the Iscor coal mine. Construction of the power station commenced in April 1981 and the first phase became operational shortly thereafter. Matimba was officially opened on 17 November 1989. Full municipal status was granted to Ellisras on 1 July 1986 by means of Administrator's notice 35 of 1986. 1990s The D'nyala Nature Reserve was the site for peace talks between Nobel Peace Prize winner F. W. de Klerk and Cyril Ramaphosa before the democratic transformation in South Africa. D'nyala is referred to as the original ‚Äúbosberaad‚Äù (or bush conference) centre, based on the fact that it was used for hosting high level cabinet meetings of the former apartheid-government of South Africa prior to the first democratic elections of 1994. At the beginning of his presidency in 1989, former President F. W. de Klerk took his entire cabinet, plus a group of officials and advisors, to D'nyala for a two-day ‚Äúbosberaad‚Äù. This conference involved discussions about policy development and strategies for change within the old South Africa. On 2 February 1990, a mere two months after this first bush conference, De Klerk announced the coming release of hundreds of political prisoners, including Nelson Mandela, and the legalization of black liberation organizations that had been outlawed for 30 years. He also proclaimed his then government's willingness to end apartheid and to negotiate a new constitution to the benefit of all South Africans. Over the next four years De Klerk returned to the D'nyala seven more times with various officials in order to work out solutions for crises that arose during the negotiation processes. In December 1992 and January 1993, for example, government officials and members of the African National Congress (ANC) met at D'nyala for two more bush conferences. It was after these meetings that the government and the ANC began formally working on the new constitution that would lead to South Africa's first democratic elections in April 1994. 2000s The name of Ellisras town was changed to Lephalale during 2002. Town The town is divided into three major extensions: * Lephalale,http://www.lephalale.gov.za/ * Onverwacht and * Marapong. The Lephalale Municipality (LM) area comprises two (2) urban nodes, namely Lephalale/Onverwacht and Marapong (Provincial Growth Point), as well as the surrounding Witpoortjie/Thabo Mbeki rural area (Provincial Growth Point), that accommodates both commercial and communal mixed-farming practices. An industrial area is also slowly developing near Onverwacht, while a heavy industrial zone has been earmarked near the Steenbokpan turnoff. The locality of the municipal area in relation to the rest of the country ensures that a number of important regional routes transverse the area. There is one National road running through the area and three main Provincial roads serve the area, namely: * N11 (Mokopane/Baltimore/Botswana) * P84/1 (Vaalwater/Ellisras/Botswana) * P19/2 (Ellisras/Marken) that links with (Mokopane) * P198/1 (Vaalwater/Ellisras) These roads serve as links between Thabazimbi, Vaalwater, Ellisras and Mokopane. The P84/1 and 198/1 run mostly along the drainage subsystems in the area. These main roads are tarred and are in relatively good condition. The town(s) developed around the central business district (CBD) in a linear form along the R517 road, and also along the main road that leads to Stockpoort. Lephalale Mall offers all modern shopping amenities The Lephalale-Stockpoort road is the main connection road between the Marapong community and Lephalale/Onverwacht. Geography Lephalale is situated between 23¬∞30' and 24¬∞00' south latitude and 27¬∞30' and 28¬∞00' east longitude and the town is positioned west of the Mokolo river, a tributary to the Limpopo river, 820 meters above sea level. Weather The area experiences summer rainfall with very dry winters. The summer rainfall averages between 350‚Äì500 mm/yr and the mean recorded minimum and maximum temperatures range from 2.1ÀöC to 38.2ÀöC for June and December respectively. Economy The economy of Lephalale is dominated by mining, electricity production, tourism, agriculture and game farming. Mining Lephalale is rich with coal which is mined by Exxaro at the Grootegeluk coal mine. The Waterberg coalfield has an estimated resource of 75-billion tons of coal, which is 40% of South Africa's remaining coal resource. The coalfield's 75-billion tons are in 11 zones, which consist of bright coal with interbedded shale and dull coal, sandstone and carbonaceous shale. However, only a relatively small part of the Waterberg coalfield is shallow enough to be accessed by open pit mining. The Eenzaamheid fault and the Daarby fault divide the Waterberg coalfield into open pit mineable and underground mineable resources. =Grootegeluk= Grootegeluk is located in the narrow band between these faults. South of the Eenzaamheid fault and in between the Daarby fault and the Zoetfontien fault, in the north, coal is found from 250 m below surface and deeper. The Grootegeluk coal mine is the largest open cast coal mine together with beneficiation plants of its kind in the world. It produces more than 17 million tonnes of coal product per year and the mine provides iron and ore industries with high grade metallurgical coal for iron and steel production. The low grade coal is supplied to Eskom's Matimba Power Station. Besides Exxaro, Anglo Coal, Sekoko Coal and Resgen mining houses also have operations in the Lephahale area. Electricity production Lephalale hosts two of South Africa's power stations: * Eskom's Matimba Power Station. Matimba, the Tsonga word for power, is designed to generate 4,000 MW and is the largest direct dry-cooled power station in the world. Coal is supplied to Matimba by means of a conveyor belt system from Grootegeluk mine. * Eskom is commissioning a new power station called Medupi. Medupi will have a capacity of 4,800 MW by the time its last unit is commissioned c. 2018. Lephalale development projects * Exxaro's Grootegeluk Medupi Expansion Project will, in terms of an agreement with the power utility, enable the Grootegeluk mine to supply the Medupi power station with an average 14,6Mtpa of power station coal over the next 40 years. * Exxaro's Thabametsi, a third coal project for Exxaro in the Waterberg, with construction planned to reach its peak in 2021. The project will employ 1,500 people. Thabametsi translates into ‚Äòwater mountain‚Äô and is situated about 13 km from Grootegeluk coal mine. When completed an average of 970 people will be employed at the mine which will have a life-span of some 30 years. * Exxaro's proposed Independent Power Producer (IPP) Waterberg Power Station. * The Mokolo and Crocodile Water Augmentation Project (MCWAP) entails the phased construction of two main bulk raw water transfer systems, as well as associated infrastructure to meet the new power station, mines, and domestic demands. The main components of the scheme are abstraction weirs, pump stations, pipelines and balancing storage. When completed in 2015, this project will ensure security of supply for both the surrounding communities and the power station and mines. * Anglo Coal's Five Spot coal-bed methane pilot project and Thirty-Nine Spot project. The Thirty-Nine Spot project involves the drilling of another 39 boreholes and could culminate in a feasibility study in a couple of years. * Sasol Mining's development of a surface mine named the Limpopo West Mine (LWM). * Vedanta Resources PLC Independent Power Producer (IPP) Vedanta Power Station, close to Stockpoort. * Resgens Boikarabelo Mine has probable reserves of 744.8-million tonnes of coal on 35% of the tenements under ResGen's control. The total resource across the whole Boikarabelo tenement could be 6-billion tonnes. Agriculture and game farming Agricultural and farming activities in Lephalale include: =Animal production= Cattle, goats and ostriches. =Plant production= Vegetables, cotton, tobacco, citrus, paprika, peppers, lucern, groundnuts, table grapes, dry beans, wheat, maize, cut flowers and water melons. Lephalale is annually the first to produce table grapes and water melons to the RSA market. =Game farming= Game (including rare species like roan, sable and buffalo) has in recent years become a major economic activity, whilst cattle farming is declining to make way for game farming. The estimated number of game farms in Lephalale is 510. Transportation Public transport in Lephalale is provided by a number of taxi operators and two bus companies, Lowveld Bus Services and Phadziri Brothers. Lowveld Bus Services provides local and long distance services between Lephalale and surrounding villages. In addition it has a contract to provide services for the transportation of labourers to Grootegeluk and Matimba. Phadziri bus service also provides some services to Eskom. Industry The major economic activities of around town includes: *Exxaro's Grootegeluk Coal Mine *Eskom's Matimba coal power station *Eskom's new Medupi power station *Agriculture Educational institutions and training centres Lephalale has a number of educational institutions which are: Primary schools *Bosveld Primary School *Nelsonskop Primary School *Ellisras Primary School *Tshukudu Primary School *Ikitseng Primary School * *Bakgalaka Lower Primary School *Makhurumula Primary School *Lephalale Primary School *Ditheko Primary School *Shongoane Higher Primary School *Mmera primary school *Ramojapudi primary school Secondary and high schools *Tielelo Secondary School *Ho√´rskool Ellisras *Phegelelo High School *King's College *Mathulasera secondary school *Morakolo Secondary School *Matshwara Secondary School *Lerekhureng Combined School Colleges *Lephalale FET College Sports The Mogol Club, situated in the CBD, accommodates horse-riding, golf, rugby, cricket and soccer. The club also hosts conferences for major corporations and is the venue of choice for social functions and traditional bushveld braais. The Mogol Club is truly the pulse of Lephalale. The 18 hole golf course winds through the Onverwacht neighbourhoods, providing green urban spaces. It is widely known for being an excellent winter course. Annual 4 day tournament, The Marula Cup, is held during July. This tournament coincides with the Bushveld Festival. Bushveld Festival The Bushveld Festival takes place in early July. The festival includes cattle shows, a game auction, horse jumping, dog shows, agricultural activities, a three-day 4x4 competition, a game farms expo, hunting opportunities, bird and tree identification competitions, traditional food, live music, a beer tent and huge camp fires. Nature=The Mokolo River This river and its tributaries rise in the western part of the Waterberg (between 1200 and 1600 metres above mean sea level). It originates in a flattish, open area with numerous koppies and flows through a steep gorge emerging above the town of Vaalwater. Here the river flows through a relatively flat area until it enters the Mokolo Dam. From there, it flows through another gorge before entering the Limpopo Plain, near the junction with the Rietspruit. From this point, the Mokolo River flows through flat sandy areas until it reaches the Limpopo River. Fish species found in the Mokolo include: * African mottled eel (Anguilla bengalensis labiata) * Common mountain catfish (Amphilius uranoscopus) * Shortspine suckermouth (Chiloglanis pretoriae) * Small barbs (Barbus spp.) * Largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) * Smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu) * Shortfin barb (Enteromius brevipinnis) * Orangefin barb (Enteromius eutaenia) * Shortspine suckermouth (Chiloglanis pretoriae) * Lhe longfin eel (Anguilla mossambica) * Redeye labeo (Labeo cylindricus) and * Largescale yellowfish (Labeobarbus marequensis) Vegetation The area is dominated by mixed bushveld and sour bushveld (sourveld). In the Limpopo Plain, arid sweet bushveld occurs while pockets of north-eastern mountain sourveld occur in higher lying areas to the south of the catchment. D'nyala Nature Reserve Situated 10 km from the town of Lephalale, this resort gets its name from the massive nyala tree that is characteristic of the area, and is also the southernmost habitat of the famous baobab tree. D'nyala boasts a diversity of game which includes some 65 mammal species such as nyala, white rhinoceros, giraffe, waterbuck, tsessebe, oryx, eland, zebra, impala, caracal, African wildcat, brown hyena, black- backed jackal and leopard. The animals of D'nyala roam freely over the area including the vicinity of the chalets. 263 bird species have been identified including waterfowl attracted to the area by the plains, a few examples include tawny eagle, kori bustard, red-billed oxpecker, black stork, black- winged pratincole, white-backed vulture, Cape vulture, marabou stork, yellow- billed stork, martial eagle, secretarybird, bateleur, lappet-faced vulture, golden-breasted bunting, yellow-fronted canary, bushveld pipit, Cape longclaw, long-tailed paradise-whydah, violet-eared waxbill, African quailfinch, lesser masked-weaver, red-billed buffalo-weaver, capped wheatear, fiscal flycatcher, Chestnut-backed sparrow-lark, rufous-naped lark, arrow-marked babbler and orange-breasted bush-shrike. In the centre of D'nyala, is a VIP mansion, and a conference centre that is of historical significance. Mokolo Nature Reserve and Dam Adjacent to the Mokolo Nature Reserve of 4,600 hectares is the Mokolo dam, the biggest dam in the Limpopo Province and bordering for 6 km on the Mokolo river, flows out of this dam. Approximately 50 km to the south of Lephalale, this dam is well suited for water sports enthusiasts, campers and day visitors. The dammed up Mokolo river winds around mountains. It is on the northern slopes of the Waterberg mountains and has the advantage of both sweet veld as well as sour veld. Mokolo Dam into which the Mokolo River flows, is fairly large and water enthusiasts, campers, anglers and birders all regard the reserve as a sanctuary, set as it is against the beautiful mountains. Mokolo Nature Reserve is true bush, offering open savannah and more dense bushveld to the animals that roam here. Waterberg Biosphere Reserve An area of the District Municipality was designated as a Waterberg Biosphere Reserve (Waterberg District Municipality, 2010). The biosphere reserve concept is aimed at achieving a balance between the pressures of the tourism industry, the need to generate direct benefits to local communities and conservation of the cultural and natural heritage assets. The Waterberg Biosphere Reserve was furthermore declared a National Priority Area (NPA)in terms of Section 18(1) of the National Environmental Management: Air Quality Act, 2004 (Act No. 39 of 2004) (NEMAQA). The NPA required specific air quality management actions to address the negative impacts of the air quality as a proactive approach to support future sustainable development in the area (Waterberg District Municipality, 2010). Wonderkop Nature Reserve This reserve covers ¬±16,100 hectares and also adjoins the Glen Alpine Dam, which forms 11 km of the eastern boundary of Wonderkop Nature Reserve. It was proclaimed as a provincial nature reserve in June 1994. Environmental education is conducted in the areas adjacent to the reserve and the sustainable utilisation of natural resources is promoted from which the surrounding communities could benefit. Lephalale‚Äôs baboon spiders A road upgrade project revealed in March 2012, that a large community of baboon spiders existed in the area. As these long lived species, golden-brown and burst-horned baboon spiders are protected under the National Environmental Management: Biodiversity Act, 175 individuals along the Nelson Mandela Road and another 376 along the Kuipersbult Road, were captured. An 800 ha portion in the south of the Manketti Game Reserve, some 5‚Äì10 km from the capture site, was identified as a suitable new habitat. Artificial burrows were created and the spiders were relocated. This project is considered unique as the large scale relocation of invertebrates is a rare occurrence.

Starring Joe Mantegna, Lara Flynn Boyle, Joe Pantoliano, and Brian Haley, the plot centers on a wealthy baby's abduction by three criminals, his subsequent escape and adventure through Chicago while being pursued by the criminals. The film was released on July 1, 1994 by 20th Century Fox in the United States and became an average at the box-office, grossing only $167 million against a $50 million budget. Despite this, it has since become a cult film in South Asian markets.  Plot  Bennington Austin \\"Bink\\" Cotwell IV, the infant son of socialites Laraine and Bennington Austin \\"Bing\\" Cotwell III, lives in a huge mansion in a suburb of Chicago and is just about to appear in the social pages of the newspaper. Three klutzy criminals, Edgar \\"Eddie\\" Mauser, Norbert \\"Norby\\" LeBlaw, and Victor \\"Veeko\\" Riley, disguise themselves as baby photographers from the newspaper and kidnap him, demanding a $5 million ransom. After the kidnapping, however, the criminals have difficulty controlling Bink at their apartment. Norby attempts to put him to sleep by reading his favorite storybook, Baby's Day Out (or \\"Boo-boo\\", as he calls it), only to fall asleep himself from boredom, leaving Bink unattended. Looking through the book, Bink notices a bird on the page and then one by the window; he follows it out and successfully gets away from his kidnappers. The ensuing chase culminates in Eddie falling off the building and into a garbage bin. Norby and Veeko rescue him and they begin pursuing Bink across the city. The FBI arrives at the mansion, headed by Dale Grissom, where they try to piece together clues along with Bink's parents and his nanny, Gilbertine. Meanwhile, Bink, now outside on the ground and crawling about, finds another part of his book ‚Äì the blue bus, which he then boards. The criminals realize he is escaping and start chasing the bus in their van, but their efforts are in vain. Meanwhile, on the bus, Bink crawls into the bag of an obese lady who gets off at her stop shortly afterwards. By the time the criminals catch the bus, they realize Bink is not on board and follow the lady, leading to an altercation after she catches them. In the distraction, Bink crawls up to a revolving door at the entrance to a department store and is forced inwards by its momentum. He is stopped by an employee who works for the store's day care center, believing he is another baby who escaped from there. He then escapes from the store and eventually crawls into traffic after a ride on a taxi. The criminals attempt to follow him, but keep getting injured in the process as he makes his way to the city zoo. They are shocked to find him in the ape house with a western lowland gorilla, which shows a maternal side and does not injure him. The criminals try to retrieve him, but the gorilla notices and pounds Veeko's hand, throws Norby into the air using a mop as a catapult, and hurls Eddie against the bars of the opposite cage after roaring loudly at him. The criminals corner and catch Bink in the zoo's park, but are confronted by two friendly police officers who have noticed that their van's engine is still running. During the conversation, Eddie hides Bink under his coat in his lap, but Bink reaches his cigarette lighter, setting his crotch on fire and sneaking off as soon as the officers are gone. Veeko extinguishes the fire by stomping repeatedly on Eddie's groin. They then follow Bink to a construction site where they're still unable to catch him due to Veeko getting thrown off the building and into the back of a garbage truck, Norby falling into a vat of wet cement, and Eddie getting stranded on a crane after being drenched in glue. The sun then sets as Bink and the construction crew leave the site. After managing to escape, the criminals give up on catching Bink and return home. Bink's parents are notified of various sightings of him in the city and Gilbertine deduces that he has been following Baby's Day Out, and will most likely head for the Old Soldiers' Home next. They find him there, but on the way home, he begins to call out \\"Boo-Boo\\" toward the criminals' flat; the FBI forces them to return Bink's book and then arrest them. Back at home, he is put to bed by his parents, who discuss having his picture taken by a normal photographer in the morning while, unbeknownst to them, he wakes up and gets ready to read another book titled Baby's Trip to China.

On Rotten Tomatoes, it has a \\"Rotten\\" score of 20% based on 15 reviews with an average rating of 3.89/10. On the Siskel & Ebert show, critic Roger Ebert wrote that \\"Baby's Day Out contains gags that might have worked in a Baby Herman cartoon, but in live action, with real people, taxis, buses, streets, and a real baby, they're just not funny. The Worton twins are adorable as Baby Bink, however; the audience produced an audible coo the first time they saw him on the screen.\\" He gave the film one-and-a-half stars out of four. His partner, Gene Siskel, however, liked it because he thought that young children would love it for the humor. Hal Hinson, writing for the Washington Post, wrote: \\"The pace is quick and efficient but never frantic...almost everything in the picture is just right, including the two- bit crooks who abduct the superhero toddler and end up bruised and begging hilariously for mercy. Best of all, though, is the Binkman himself, whose tiny face is so expressive that he brings new meaning to the phrase 'conquering with a smile.'\\"  Box office  The film opened with takings of $4,044,662 at the start of July 1994. It finally grossed $16,827,402 at the domestic box office, a disappointing return considering the $48 million production budget. It ranked at #83 for the best performing films of 1994. Despite failing at the box office, the film was also the 26th best performing PG-rated family film of the year in 1994.  Year-end lists  * 1st worst ‚Äì Melinda Miller, The Buffalo News * Top 10 worst (not ranked) ‚Äì Dan Webster, The Spokesman-Review  Popularity in India and remakes  The film was tremendously popular in India. It was played at the largest theatre in Calcutta for over a year. Recalling a trip to Calcutta, Roger Ebert said, \\"I asked if Star Wars had been their most successful American film. No, I was told, it was Baby's Day Out\\". It was remade twice, first in Telugu in 1995 under the title Sisindri and then in Malayalam in 1999 under the title James Bond.  Cancelled video game  A video game adaptation of the film was planned, completed and slated to be released on Super Nintendo Entertainment System, Sega Genesis, and Game Boy in October 1994, but was cancelled at the last minute. Two prototypes of the Genesis port can be found for download on several ROM sites. One is a near completed version while the other is a very early beta. Instead of playing as Bink, the player controls what appears to be his guardian angel in order to guide him to safety in the vein of Pac-Man 2: The New Adventures.  Home media  20th Century Fox Home Entertainment released the film on VHS on April 4, 1995, and on DVD on January 29, 2001. Special features include Patrick Read Johnson's commentary, a featurette and a trailer for it. It was re-released on DVD on October 11, 2011.

He presented the weekday overnight/early-morning programme on BBC Radio 2 from 1990 until 2014. From October 2014 until January 2017, he presented the midnight to 3am programme every Friday, Saturday and Sunday. He also temporarily replaced Russell Brand on Saturday evenings in late 2008, between 9 and 11pm, following Brand's resignation over his infamous prank calls row. Early life and career A doctor's son, Lester was educated at Denstone College, and worked in a variety of jobs (including at Dudley Zoo, in a pub, and as a civil service clerk), before he began his broadcasting career in 1977 for BBC local radio stations. He joined Radio Aire in Leeds in 1981. Later, he worked for other radio stations in the commercial sector. These included Radio Tees, based in Stockton-on-Tees, where he worked from 1983 until 1986. At Radio Tees, on joining, he narrowly avoided an attempt by Canadian programme controller Donald Cline to rechristen him \\"Red\\" Lester. Lester went on to present, amongst others, the weekday lunchtime show and a specialist blues music programme there. In 1986 he returned to the BBC, presenting the breakfast show (indeed, the first show) on the newly opened BBC Essex based in Chelmsford. Lester joined Radio 2 in 1987 as an announcer and newsreader. He also presented the night-time show on a rota basis. In 1990 he was given the early-morning show permanently. The Best Time of the Day and beyond Lester kept UK truckers and other night-shift workers awake with his weird and strange observations. The meaningless but catchy show slogans are SCOF (Swirling Cesspool of Filth) and Slap My Top (thought to be a variation on the music hall soundbite slap my thigh ‚Äì but reserved exclusively for people with bald heads) and listeners have marketed the show by writing the phrase in the dirt on the backs of trucks and vans. There was a limited edition range of T-shirts with the slogan written in Cantonese developed by a listener, which Lester awarded to people who came up with the most innovative uses of the slogan ‚Äì winners included a local radio reporter who got the expression into a story; a man who wrote and recorded a song with the slogan as its title; a mystery girl, for placing an ad for Lester's show in the small ads section of a local newspaper and a man who developed a website which remains a communal meeting point for the programme's listeners, and is listed in the External Links section below. As well as T-Shirts another listener produced a range of glow in the dark Alex Lester wristbands which were also given away as prizes on the show. The new phrase for the 2010‚Äì2011 Truck Writing Season was WALLOP (We're Alex Lester's Lovely Overnight People), and in 2013 the slogan ALAN was introduced (Alex Lester at Night). Despite being broadcast in an overnight timeslot, Lester prided himself on calling his programme The Best Time of the Day. As one of the longest-serving broadcasters on the network, he was occasionally heard on Radio 2 during the daytime when regular presenters were away. The programme was broadcast from 4am until 6:30am until December 1992, and from 3am to 5am during 1993. For 16 years, starting in January 1994, the programme began at 3am and finished at 6am, until it was rescheduled in 2010 after changes to the Radio 2 morning schedule. It was then broadcast from 2am to 5am every weekday. With the introduction of After Midnight on Radio 2 in October 2014, the show was broadcast from 12am to 3am from Fridays to Sundays. Alex shared the After Midnight slot with Janice Long, with Long presenting Monday - Thursday and Lester Friday, Saturday and Sunday. The show was cancelled in January 2017 due to Radio 2 cutting costs. Alex had hosted a weekly show on BBC Radio Oxford from 2015 till 2017, broadcasting between 1pm and 4pm on Fridays. Between February and June 2017 he also hosted a four-hour Sunday evening show on BBC Radio Kent but had to relinquish this due to other commitments, primarily resulting from becoming the new host of the breakfast show on BBC WM from Monday 20 March 2017. Lester could also be heard, from April 2017 to June 2017 on Thames Radio's overnight shift. It is believed that the voice parts were 'Tracked' (recorded in advance and inserted between the records in real time). Alex also hosted the late night show on BBC across the West Midlands local radio stations until February 2020 from 10pm on Saturday night until 1am on Sunday. On 4 January 2019 he left the breakfast show on BBC WM after nearly 2 years. From 10 February 2020, Alex started presenting the weekday overnight show on Greatest Hits Radio networks across England and Scotland from 1am until 6am.https://radiotoday.co.uk/2020/02/alex-lester- joins-greatest-hits-radio-for-overnights/ He also presents the Weekend Anthems show on a Saturday afternoon from 4pm.https://planetradio.co.uk/greatest- hits/shows/Weekend-Anthems/ From 8 June 2020, he permanently moved to the late night show 10pm-1am.https://radiotoday.co.uk/2020/06/alex-lester-keeps-late- show-on-greatest-hits-radio/ Personal life Lester has homes in Hastings and Wednesbury. For nearly 10 years he lived aboard a 60-foot traditional stern canal boat (which he nicknamed The Blue Pig) during the week, while presenting his show from the BBC's Pebble Mill Studios and then The Mailbox in Birmingham. He also has a restored cottage as a third home in the Normandy region of France. Obscure sports are another passion. Over the years Lester has participated in Extreme Downhill Cheese Rolling and the Yorkshire Celery Wrestling Finals and achieved a creditable 9th-place finish at the 2006 World Bog Snorkelling Championship. In December 2010 Lester announced his engagement to his longtime partner Kerry, who is also known as \\"The Dark Lady\\". They married on 3 December 2011. Edwina Hayes, a singer-songwriter whose music had been featured on Lester's show, performed at the ceremony. Alex is a stepfather to Kerry's two adult children, Jamie and Ella, from a previous relationship.

Eisenhower Fellowships selected Mollenhoff as a USA Eisenhower Fellow in 1960. In 1965, Mollenhoff published Despoilers of Democracy, which provided details of corruption associated with Senate Majority Leader Lyndon B.

Combat between player characters (PCs) and mobs is called player versus environment (PvE). PCs may also attack mobs because they aggressively attack PCs.

Originally powered by one 119 kW (160 hp) Shvetsov M-11FR-1 radial piston engine, it entered service in 1946. It was also produced in China as the Nanchang CJ-5. Design and development A 1986 postage stamp issued by the Soviet Union to commemorate the Yak-18 A member of the second generation of Russian aircraft designers, and best known for fighter designs, Alexander Sergeyevich Yakovlev always retained a light aircraft design section. In May 1945, Yakovlev initiated design of the Yak-18 two-seat primary trainer. He designed it to replace the earlier Yakovlev UT-2 and Yakovlev Yak-5 in service with the Soviet Air Forces and DOSAAF (Voluntary Society for Collaboration with the Army, Air Force and Navy, which sponsored aero clubs throughout the USSR). In 1944, an advanced version of the UT-2 had been built with many of the features of the new Yak-18. The new aircraft flew a year later, powered by a 119 kW (160 hp) Shvetsov M-11 five-cylinder radial engine and featuring pneumatically operated retractable main landing gear and a fixed tailwheel. It entered service as a trainer later that year and was built by Yakovlev up until 1956. Examples were exported to China in kit form beginning in 1950. The Chinese began producing license built copies in 1954 with the designation CJ-5. The Yak-18's greatest claim to fame is its use as a night bomber by the North Korean Air Force during the Korean War. The aircraft were modified with bomb racks on the wing center section and flew over UN troop locations at night to drop bombs and harass UN forces. The single most successful attack of the North Korean aviation during the war was the destruction of a fuel dump with nearly of fuel in the Inchon area in June 1953 by four or five Yak-18s.Richard P. Hallion (1986), The Naval Air War in Korea, , p.186 The five-cylinder engine reminded many of the US troops of the sound made by early gasoline powered washing machines, earning them the name: \\"Washing Machine Charlie\\". The name \\"Bed Check Charlie\\" was also used for these night intruders. The Yak-18s, along with Polikarpov Po-2s, became quite a nuisance until US night fighters began shooting them down. One nightfighter crashed shooting down a Bed Check Charlie and another nightfighter rammed its target. Other claims to fame for the Yak-18 are an international speed record for its class in 1951 as well as being the aircraft used for initial flight training by Yuri Gagarin (1st human in space) and Ken Rowe (No Kum-Sok, who defected from North Korea with a Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15 jet fighter during the Korean War). Later, as the need for conventional landing gear trainers abated, Yakovlev re-designed the Yak-18 with retractable tricycle landing gear and an Ivchenko AI-14RF radial engine of 224 kW (300 hp); this was designated the Yak-18A. The design proved exceptionally easy to build and maintain. There are an estimated 40 original Yak-18s in existence worldwide. Five are currently flyable in the US, three are flyable in Europe, and the Chinese Air Force has one flyable with several other airframes in storage. Approximately four other aircraft worldwide are currently being restored for flight. Many are found in major aviation museums worldwide including the National Air and Space Museum in the USA. The Nanchang CJ-6, produced in China, is sometimes quoted as a variant but is a completely different aircraft designed in China by Bushi Cheng and built by Nanchang Aircraft Company.

The R-6 traces its roots back to early 1928 when the Soviet Air Force needed a long-range multirole aircraft. The requirements were that it could be used for long-range transport, defensive patrolling, reconnaissance, light bombing and torpedo attack. Design and development Under Ivan Pogosski and guided by Andrei Tupolev, TsAGI developed the ANT-7 from the Tupolev TB-1 by scaling it down by about one third. Power for the ANT-7 was intended to be provided by two ‚Äì Hispano Suiza engines or Bristol Jupiter engines, but the prototype was powered by two ‚Äì BMW VI engines. The first flight of the ANT-7 took place on 11 September 1929, piloted by Mikhail Gromov. Flight tests started in March 1930 after TsAGi decided to postpone them until after the winter. That summer, the NII-VVS (Nauchno- Issledovatel'skiy Institut Voyenno-Vozdooshnykh Seel ‚Äì air force scientific test institute) conducted state tests which revealed tailplane buffeting, which was alleviated by fitting enlarged elevators. The next flight encountered radiator damage and an engine failure, but in spite of this, the ANT-7 passed the state acceptance tests. Operational history Production aircraft were designated R-6 by the Soviet Air Force. The first production aircraft was rolled off the GAZ-22, (GAZ ‚Äì Gosudarstvenny Aviatsionnyy Zavod ‚Äì state aviation plant/factory), assembly line in November 1931, a year after production started. Another 410 aircraft were made during the following three years: 385 at GAZ-22 in Moscow (one of these was the R-6 Limuzin), five at GAZ-31 in Taganrog (floatplanes designated KR-6P), and 20 more at GAZ-12 in Komsomolsk-on-Amur. The standard aircraft crew consisted of the pilot, gunner and observer and the aircraft was able to carry of bombs to a distance of up to . Some were built with floats as the MP-6, (also known as KR-6P), for maritime patrol duties. Another variant was the KR-6 (KR ‚Äì Kreiser Razveyedchik ‚Äì cruiser reconnaissance), which had two PV-2 machine guns and a second gunner, that was later relegated to training duties. By 1935, the R-6 was becoming obsolete, and several were transferred to Aeroflot and Avia Arktika, which used them to carry passengers and cargo in Siberia before the Great Patriotic War, designated PS-7-2M17 (the \\"2M17\\" showed that the aircraft were powered by two Mikulin M-17s), or as MP-6-2M17 if floats were attached.

Originally intended as a replacement for the Mil Mi-8 and the Mi-17, it is being marketed in both military and civil versions. It flew for the first time on 22 December 2003 and was certified on 30 December 2015. History The Mi-38's development was carried out by Kazan Helicopters since early 1980s and a mockup was first shown during the 1989 Paris Air Show. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Kazan Helicopters went into collaboration with Eurocopter that was to adapt the Mi-38 for international market. In September 1994, Euromil JSC was established and funding of the programme began a month later. Sextant and Pratt & Whitney Canada were also to participate in the programme as suppliers of Mi-38's avionics and powerplant equipment. Initially, the helicopter was to be first flight tested in 1999, but only on 18 August 1999 a contract was signed for completion of the first demonstrator. In 2001, testing of Mi-38's rotor blades was carried out on a Mi-17 helicopter. The first Mi-38 demonstrator (PT-1) performed its maiden flight above the Kazan Helicopters plant on 22 December 2003. The second prototype (OP-2), powered by Pratt & Whitney Canada PW127/TS engines, made its first flight on 2 December 2010. The prototype is also equipped with the IBKO-38 or IBKV-38 aviation complex, developed by Transas Aviation, which implements a concept of a glass cockpit for the Mi-38. The same month, OP-2 performed its first long-haul flight from Kazan to Moscow, which covers more than 800 km. In March 2013, the F√©d√©ration A√©ronautique Internationale has confirmed the Mi-38 prototypes have already set five records in the E1h class. The second prototype aircraft set an altitude record by reaching 8,620 meters (28,280 feet) without a payload. The second and third records were for climbing speed; the Mi-38 reached a height of 3,000 meters (9,843 feet) in six minutes, then followed this to reach 6,000 meters (19,685 feet) in 10 minutes and 52 seconds. Two further records were altitude records: the first was set at 7,895 meters (25,902 feet) with a 1,000-kg (2,205-lb) payload, the second at 7,020 meters (23,031 feet) with a 2,000-kg (4,409-lb) payload. The third prototype (OP-3), began its flight tests on 17 December 2013. The helicopter is equipped with a pair of Russian Klimov TV7-117V turboshaft engines, which produce about 2800 shp as opposite to 2500 shp for the Pratt & Whitney Canada PW127/TS. The fourth and final prototype (OP-4), first took off on 16 October 2014. Same as the OP-3, it is powered by Klimov TV7-117V engines but differs from the third prototype by its impact-resistant fuel system and enlarged portholes. On 30 December 2015, Rosaviatsiya certified the Mi-38, completing the testing and certification program and allowing for the delivery of the first production model. Certification was based on the third and fourth flight-test prototypes with 2,500 shp Klimov TV7-117V engines. In July 2017, a contract for delivery of first two serial Mi-38s to the Russian Defence Ministry was signed. The Kazan Helicopters plant launched the serial production of the helicopter on 10 January 2018. In total, the Russian Defence Ministry planned to purchase about 15 helicopters until 2020. On 23 November 2018, military variant, Mi-38T, performed its maiden flight. The new variant was developed to meet the Russian MoD's new requirements for the helicopter and due to international sanctions imposed on Russia, all of its components, including engines and avionics, are Russian-made. Deputy Managing Director at Kazan Helicopters Vadim Ligai stated that the Mi-38 can now carry up to 40 passengers. The Russian Defence Ministry took delivery of the first two serial Mi-38s in December 2019. In January 2020, Russian Helicopters announced that it had received orders from an unspecified export customer (reported by Russian media sources to be in the Middle East) for Mi-38Ts in \\"transport and in increased comfort cabin configurations\\", with delivery from 2021 to 2022. The RF Defense Ministry ordered 2 more Mi-38s in increased comfort cabin configuration in August 2020.https://armstrade.org/includes/periodics/news/2020/0826/095559333/detail.shtml Operators ; Specifications (Mi-38)See alsoReferencesExternal links * Category:2000s Russian military transport aircraft Category:2000s Russian cargo aircraft Category:Mil aircraft Category:2000s Russian helicopters Category:Twin-turbine helicopters Category:Aircraft first flown in 2003 ","title":"Mil Mi-38"},{"id":"1493310","text":"Gaby Rado (17 January 1955, Budapest - 30 March 2003, Sulaymaniyah, Iraq) was a British television journalist who died in Iraq during the 2003 invasion.

Walsh championed the application of scientific methods to control agricultural pests. He was a proponent of biological control as an effective means to manage insects. He was also one of the first American scientists to support Charles Darwin's theory of evolution and was instrumental in securing its broad acceptance in the entomological community.Anelli (2004) Biography Walsh was born in Hackney, which was then a small village outside of London. The son of Benjamin Walsh and Mary Bidwell Clarke, he was the fifth of thirteen children.Sheppard (2004) When Walsh was a boy, his father, a member of parliament, was charged with embezzlement and caught attempting to flee to America without his wife and children. He was jailed at Newgate and saved from hanging by a royal pardon issued in 1812.O'Danachair (2004) After graduation from St. Paul's School in 1827, Walsh entered Trinity College, Cambridge, receiving a B.A. degree in 1831 and a master's degree three years later. In 1833 he became a fellow of Trinity, where he resided for 12 years with the intention of entering the Anglican ministry. A scholar of classic languages and literature, Walsh wrote The Comedies of Aristophanes, Translated into Corresponding English Metres (the first of an intended three volumes). In addition he showed an interest in journalism and wrote numerous articles for newspapers and periodicals. While at Cambridge, Walsh developed a great dislike for religion and in particular came to despise the clergy as hypocrites and fools.Riley (1870) He was also critical of university policies and wrote a pamphlet in 1837, A Historical Account of the University of Cambridge and its Colleges, proposing changes that were considered radical at the time. Eventually he became disillusioned with his career and left Cambridge. Walsh married Rebecca Finn in 1838 and the couple emigrated to the United States. They settled in the remote and sparsely populated Henry County, Illinois, twenty miles from the nearest village. For the next twelve years, Walsh and his wife lived in a mud-plastered log cabin and farmed their 300-acre property.Tucker (1920) His desire to live the solitary life of a philosopher-farmer came to an end when new settlements in the region brought about an outbreak of malaria. Worried for his health, Walsh moved to Rock Island, Illinois in 1850 and started a successful lumber business. After his move to Little Rock, Walsh became active in politics. As a Radical Republican he was opposed to slavery and frequently expressed his strong opinions in print. He was actively involved in the fight to admit Kansas as a free state. In 1856 he helped to establish a local chapter of the Kansas Settlers Society which sought to encourage and support the settlement of Kansas by people who opposed slavery. In 1858 he suspected the Little Rock city council was embezzling city funds and in order to gain access to the financial records, he successfully campaigned for election to the council. Once the corruption was exposed he resigned his position. Entomology Around 1858 Walsh sold his business and earned his living from a number of rental properties that he owned and managed. Although he had studied natural history and collected insects while at Cambridge, it was only at this point that he devoted himself full-time to entomology. By 1859 Walsh was lecturing on insects at the Illinois State Fair where he also displayed his collection of 1,650 insects he had recently collected.Sorensen (1995) In 1860 Walsh delivered a very well-received lecture on insect pests to the Illinois State Horticultural Society. Later he wrote several articles for various farm periodicals. Initially, perhaps influenced by his own farming experience, Walsh focused on the practical aspects of insects as agricultural pests. However, starting in 1862 he published several scholarly papers in the journals of scientific societies such as the Boston Society of Natural History and the Entomological Society of Philadelphia. These works provided detailed observations of insect metamorphosis and natural history; compared morphological characters for a given taxon; or described new species. In his new-found career as an entomologist, Walsh was an active participant in several scientific societies. In 1858 he became a founding member of the Illinois Natural History Society. In 1861 he was elected a corresponding member of the Entomological Society of Philadelphia, and in 1863 he became a member of the Boston Society of Natural History. Walsh was also closely affiliated with the influential Illinois State Agricultural Society. It was this organization that successfully lobbied the state legislature to appoint Walsh as the first Illinois State Entomologist. In 1868 Illinois became only the second state to appoint an official entomologist. Although his official appointment was not ratified by the legislature until nearly a year later, Walsh began work immediately. In 1865 the Entomological Society of Philadelphia established a monthly periodical, the Practical Entomologist, the first American journal devoted to economic entomology. Walsh was appointed an associate editor and quickly became editor of the short-lived but influential publication.Kuehn (2009) In September 1868 Walsh became senior editor of The American Entomologist, with C.V. Riley as junior editor. Targeting farmers, this monthly journal featured illustrations and clear descriptions to help readers identify insect pests and apply the most effective controls. Two significant findings by Walsh and Riley appeared in this journal: the discovery of the 13-year form of the periodical cicada, and the first reference to mimicry of the North American monarch butterfly by the viceroy. Darwinism Walsh had been classmates with Charles Darwin at Cambridge and both received their baccalaureate degrees in 1831. Although not close friends, they were acquaintances, held a shared interest in natural history, and were mentored by two prominent Cambridge professors: geologist Adam Sedgwick and botanist John Henslow. Walsh first read Darwin's On the Origin of Species in 1861. He had initially approached the book with skepticism but quickly became a convert to Darwin's theory and one of its most enthusiastic proponents. He later wrote to Darwin: \\"Allow me to take this opportunity of thanking you for the publication of your Origin of Species... The first perusal staggered me, the second convinced me, and the oftener I read it the more convinced I am of the general soundness of your theory.\\" This was the first letter in what became a regular correspondence. Over the next several years more than 30 letters were exchanged between them. Once Walsh became convinced of Darwin's theory, he championed the cause vigorously in the American scientific community through his lectures, publications and private correspondence. With Darwin's encouragement, he challenged the views of prominent opponents of evolution, including Louis Agassiz, Samuel Scudder, and Alpheus Packard. Within a few years, most entomologists (including Scudder and Packard) were expressing their support for evolutionary theory, while the remaining holdouts, like Agassiz, experienced a diminished reputation with their peers. Walsh also incorporated evolutionary thinking into his own entomological studies and made several original contributions supporting Darwinism. In 1864 Walsh noted that 15 similar species of gall wasps differed primarily in their preference for different species of willow. He went on to argue that these wasps shared a common ancestor that evolved into distinct species based on the species of willow they preferred. Walsh also investigated the phenomena of protective mimicry among insects and argued that it was best explained as an example of natural selection. Darwin was delighted to learn of Walsh's studies and incorporated his findings in later editions of the Origin of Species. Death Walsh died on November 18, 1869 from injuries sustained when struck by a train while walking along the tracks. He is buried in the Chippiannock Cemetery, Rock Island. His insect collection, numbering 30,000 specimens, was purchased by the state of Illinois and stored in the \\"fireproof\\" facilities of the Chicago Academy of Sciences for safekeeping. Nevertheless, almost all of Walsh's collection was destroyed in the Great Chicago Fire of 1871.Valauskas (2015) Publications Walsh authored 385 works during his career and co- authored an additional 478 works with Charles V. Riley.Henshaw (1889) Some of his more notable entomological works include: *1861. Insects injurious to vegetation in Illinois *1864. On dimorphism in the hymenopterous genus Cynips *1864.

Displayed in the Canadian War Museum. A fire-control system (sometimes called FCS) is a number of components working together, usually a gun data computer, a director, and radar, which is designed to assist a ranged weapon system in targeting, tracking and hitting its target. It performs the same task as a human gunner firing a weapon, but attempts to do so faster and more accurately. Naval based fire control=Origins The original fire- control systems were developed for ships. The early history of naval fire control was dominated by the engagement of targets within visual range (also referred to as direct fire). In fact, most naval engagements before 1800 were conducted at ranges of . Even during the American Civil War, the famous engagement between and was often conducted at less than range. Rapid technical improvements in the late 19th century greatly increased the range at which gunfire was possible. Rifled guns of much larger size firing explosive shells of lighter relative weight (compared to all-metal balls) so greatly increased the range of the guns that the main problem became aiming them while the ship was moving on the waves. This problem was solved with the introduction of the gyroscope, which corrected this motion and provided sub- degree accuracies. Guns were now free to grow to any size, and quickly surpassed 10 inches calibre by the turn of the century. These guns were capable of such great range that the primary limitation was seeing the target, leading to the use of high masts on ships. Another technical improvement was the introduction of the steam turbine which greatly increased the performance of the ships. Earlier screw-powered capital ships were capable of perhaps 16 knots, but the first large turbine ships were capable of over 20 knots. Combined with the long range of the guns, this meant that the ships moved a considerable distance, several ship lengths, between the time the shells were fired and landed. One could no longer eyeball the aim with any hope of accuracy. Moreover, in naval engagements it is also necessary to control the firing of several guns at once. Naval gun fire control potentially involves three levels of complexity. Local control originated with primitive gun installations aimed by the individual gun crews. Director control aims all guns on the ship at a single target. Coordinated gunfire from a formation of ships at a single target was a focus of battleship fleet operations. Corrections are made for surface wind velocity, firing ship roll and pitch, powder magazine temperature, drift of rifled projectiles, individual gun bore diameter adjusted for shot-to-shot enlargement, and rate of change of range with additional modifications to the firing solution based upon the observation of preceding shots. The resulting directions, known as a firing solution, would then be fed back out to the turrets for laying. If the rounds missed, an observer could work out how far they missed by and in which direction, and this information could be fed back into the computer along with any changes in the rest of the information and another shot attempted. At first, the guns were aimed using the technique of artillery spotting. It involved firing a gun at the target, observing the projectile's point of impact (fall of shot), and correcting the aim based on where the shell was observed to land, which became more and more difficult as the range of the gun increased.The increasing range of the guns also forced ships to create very high observation points from which optical rangefinders and artillery spotters could see the battle. The need to spot artillery shells was one of the compelling reasons behind the development of naval aviation and early aircraft were used to spot the naval gunfire points of impact. In some cases, ships launched manned observation balloons as a way to artillery spot. Even today, artillery spotting is an important part of directing gunfire, though today the spotting is often done by unmanned aerial vehicles. For example, during Desert Storm, UAVs spotted fire for the Iowa-class battleships involved in shore bombardment. Between the American Civil War and 1905, numerous small improvements, such as telescopic sights and optical rangefinders, were made in fire control. There were also procedural improvements, like the use of plotting boards to manually predict the position of a ship during an engagement.See, for example US Naval Fire Control, 1918. World War I Then increasingly sophisticated mechanical calculators were employed for proper gun laying, typically with various spotters and distance measures being sent to a central plotting station deep within the ship. There the fire direction teams fed in the location, speed and direction of the ship and its target, as well as various adjustments for Coriolis effect, weather effects on the air, and other adjustments. Around 1905, mechanical fire control aids began to become available, such as the Dreyer Table, Dumaresq (which was also part of the Dreyer Table), and Argo Clock, but these devices took a number of years to become widely deployed.The reasons were for this slow deployment are complex. As in most bureaucratic environments, institutional inertia and the revolutionary nature of the change required caused the major navies to move slow in adopting the technology. These devices were early forms of rangekeepers. Arthur Pollen and Frederic Charles Dreyer independently developed the first such systems. Pollen began working on the problem after noting the poor accuracy of naval artillery at a gunnery practice near Malta in 1900.Pollen 'Gunnery' p. 23 Lord Kelvin, widely regarded as Britain's leading scientist first proposed using an analogue computer to solve the equations which arise from the relative motion of the ships engaged in the battle and the time delay in the flight of the shell to calculate the required trajectory and therefore the direction and elevation of the guns. Pollen aimed to produce a combined mechanical computer and automatic plot of ranges and rates for use in centralised fire control. To obtain accurate data of the target's position and relative motion, Pollen developed a plotting unit (or plotter) to capture this data. To this he added a gyroscope to allow for the yaw of the firing ship. Like the plotter, the primitive gyroscope of the time required substantial development to provide continuous and reliable guidance.Pollen 'Gunnery' p. 36 Although the trials in 1905 and 1906 were unsuccessful, they showed promise. Pollen was encouraged in his efforts by the rapidly rising figure of Admiral Jackie Fisher, Admiral Arthur Knyvet Wilson and the Director of Naval Ordnance and Torpedoes (DNO), John Jellicoe. Pollen continued his work, with occasional tests carried out on Royal Navy warships. Meanwhile, a group led by Dreyer designed a similar system. Although both systems were ordered for new and existing ships of the Royal Navy, the Dreyer system eventually found most favour with the Navy in its definitive Mark IV* form. The addition of director control facilitated a full, practicable fire control system for World War I ships, and most RN capital ships were so fitted by mid 1916. The director was high up over the ship where operators had a superior view over any gunlayer in the turrets. It was also able to co- ordinate the fire of the turrets so that their combined fire worked together. This improved aiming and larger optical rangefinders improved the estimate of the enemy's position at the time of firing. The system was eventually replaced by the improved \\"Admiralty Fire Control Table\\" for ships built after 1927.For a description of an Admiralty Fire Control Table in action: Admiralty Fire Control Table in the transmitting station of HMS Belfast. World War II During their long service life, rangekeepers were updated often as technology advanced, and by World War II they were a critical part of an integrated fire control system. The incorporation of radar into the fire control system early in World War II provided ships the ability to conduct effective gunfire operations at long range in poor weather and at night.The degree of updating varied by country. For example, the US Navy used servomechanisms to automatically steer their guns in both azimuth and elevation. The Germans used servomechanisms to steer their guns only in elevation, and the British began to introduce Remote Power Control in elevation and deflection of 4-inch, 4.5-inch and 5.25-inch guns in 1942, according to Naval Weapons of WW2, by Campbell. For example s 5.25-inch guns had been upgraded to full RPC in time for her Pacific deployment. For U.S. Navy gun fire control systems, see ship gun fire-control systems. The use of director-controlled firing, together with the fire control computer, removed the control of the gun laying from the individual turrets to a central position; although individual gun mounts and multi-gun turrets would retain a local control option for use when battle damage limited director information transfer (these would be simpler versions called \\"turret tables\\" in the Royal Navy). Guns could then be fired in planned salvos, with each gun giving a slightly different trajectory. Dispersion of shot caused by differences in individual guns, individual projectiles, powder ignition sequences, and transient distortion of ship structure was undesirably large at typical naval engagement ranges. Directors high on the superstructure had a better view of the enemy than a turret mounted sight, and the crew operating them were distant from the sound and shock of the guns. Gun directors were topmost, and the ends of their optical rangefinders protruded from their sides, giving them a distinctive appearance. Unmeasured and uncontrollable ballistic factors, like high altitude temperature, humidity, barometric pressure, wind direction and velocity, required final adjustment through observation of the fall of shot. Visual range measurement (of both target and shell splashes) was difficult prior to availability of Radar. The British favoured coincident rangefinders while the Germans favored the stereoscopic type. The former were less able to range on an indistinct target but easier on the operator over a long period of use, the latter the reverse. Ford Mk 1 Ballistic Computer. The name rangekeeper began to become inadequate to describe the increasingly complicated functions of rangekeeper. The Mk 1 Ballistic Computer was the first rangekeeper that was referred to as a computer. Note the three pistol grips in the foreground. Those fired the ship's guns. Submarines were also equipped with fire control computers for the same reasons, but their problem was even more pronounced; in a typical \\"shot\\", the torpedo would take one to two minutes to reach its target. Calculating the proper \\"lead\\" given the relative motion of the two vessels was very difficult, and torpedo data computers were added to dramatically improve the speed of these calculations. In a typical World War II British ship the fire control system connected the individual gun turrets to the director tower (where the sighting instruments were located) and the analogue computer in the heart of the ship. In the director tower, operators trained their telescopes on the target; one telescope measured elevation and the other bearing. Rangefinder telescopes on a separate mounting measured the distance to the target. These measurements were converted by the Fire Control Table into the bearings and elevations for the guns to fire upon. In the turrets, the gunlayers adjusted the elevation of their guns to match an indicator for the elevation transmitted from the Fire Control table‚Äîa turret layer did the same for bearing. When the guns were on target they were centrally fired.B.R. 901/43, Handbook of The Admiralty Fire Control Clock Mark I and I* Even with as much mechanization of the process, it still required a large human element; the Transmitting Station (the room that housed the Dreyer table) for HMS Hoods main guns housed 27 crew. Directors were largely unprotected from enemy fire. It was difficult to put much weight of armour so high up on the ship, and even if the armour did stop a shot, the impact alone would likely knock the instruments out of alignment. Sufficient armour to protect from smaller shells and fragments from hits to other parts of the ship was the limit. Accurate fire control systems were introduced in the early 20th century. Pictured, a cut-away view of a destroyer. The below deck analog computer is shown in the centre of the drawing and is labelled \\"Gunnery Calculating Position\\". The performance of the analog computer was impressive. The battleship during a 1945 test was able to maintain an accurate firing solutionThe rangekeeper in this exercise maintained a firing solution that was accurate within a few hundred yards (or meters), which is within the range needed for an effective rocking salvo. The rocking salvo was used by the US Navy to get the final corrections needed to hit the target. on a target during a series of high- speed turns. It is a major advantage for a warship to be able to maneuver while engaging a target. Night naval engagements at long range became feasible when radar data could be input to the rangekeeper. The effectiveness of this combination was demonstrated in November 1942 at the Third Battle of Savo Island when the engaged the Japanese battleship at a range of at night. Kirishima was set aflame, suffered a number of explosions, and was scuttled by her crew. She had been hit by at least nine rounds out of 75 fired (12% hit rate). The wreck of Kirishima was discovered in 1992 and showed that the entire bow section of the ship was missing. The Japanese during World War II did not develop radar or automated fire control to the level of the US Navy and were at a significant disadvantage. Post-1945 By the 1950s gun turrets were increasingly unmanned, with gun laying controlled remotely from the ship's control centre using inputs from radar and other sources. The last combat action for the analog rangekeepers, at least for the US Navy, was in the 1991 Persian Gulf War when the rangekeepers on the s directed their last rounds in combat. Aircraft based fire control=World War II bomb sights An early use of fire-control systems was in bomber aircraft, with the use of computing bombsights that accepted altitude and airspeed information to predict and display the impact point of a bomb released at that time. The best known United States device was the Norden bombsight. World War II aerial gunnery sights Simple systems, known as lead computing sights also made their appearance inside aircraft late in the war as gyro gunsights. These devices used a gyroscope to measure turn rates, and moved the gunsight's aim-point to take this into account, with the aim point presented through a reflector sight. The only manual \\"input\\" to the sight was the target distance, which was typically handled by dialing in the size of the target's wing span at some known range. Small radar units were added in the post-war period to automate even this input, but it was some time before they were fast enough to make the pilots completely happy with them. The first implementation of a centralized fire control system in a production aircraft was on the B-29. Post-World War II systems By the start of the Vietnam War, a new computerized bombing predictor, called the Low Altitude Bombing System (LABS), began to be integrated into the systems of aircraft equipped to carry nuclear armaments. This new bomb computer was revolutionary in that the release command for the bomb was given by the computer, not the pilot; the pilot designated the target using the radar or other targeting system, then \\"consented\\" to release the weapon, and the computer then did so at a calculated \\"release point\\" some seconds later. This is very different from previous systems, which, though they had also become computerized, still calculated an \\"impact point\\" showing where the bomb would fall if the bomb were released at that moment. The key advantage is that the weapon can be released accurately even when the plane is maneuvering. Most bombsights until this time required that the plane maintain a constant attitude (usually level), though dive-bombing sights were also common. The LABS system was originally designed to facilitate a tactic called toss bombing, to allow the aircraft to remain out of range of a weapon's blast radius. The principle of calculating the release point, however, was eventually integrated into the fire control computers of later bombers and strike aircraft, allowing level, dive and toss bombing. In addition, as the fire control computer became integrated with ordnance systems, the computer can take the flight characteristics of the weapon to be launched into account. Land based fire control=Anti-aircraft based fire control By the start of World War II, aircraft altitude performance had increased so much that anti-aircraft guns had similar predictive problems, and were increasingly equipped with fire- control computers. The main difference between these systems and the ones on ships was size and speed. The early versions of the High Angle Control System, or HACS, of Britain's Royal Navy were examples of a system that predicted based upon the assumption that target speed, direction, and altitude would remain constant during the prediction cycle, which consisted of the time to fuze the shell and the time of flight of the shell to the target. The USN Mk 37 system made similar assumptions except that it could predict assuming a constant rate of altitude change. The Kerrison Predictor is an example of a system that was built to solve laying in \\"real time\\", simply by pointing the director at the target and then aiming the gun at a pointer it directed. It was also deliberately designed to be small and light, in order to allow it to be easily moved along with the guns it served. The radar-based M-9/SCR-584 Anti-Aircraft System was used to direct air defense artillery since 1943. The MIT Radiation Lab's SCR-584 was the first radar system with automatic following, Bell Laboratory's M-9 was an electronic analog fire-control computer that replaced complicated and difficult-to-manufacture mechanical computers (such as the Sperry M-7 or British Kerrison predictor). In combination with the VT proximity fuze, this system accomplished the astonishing feat of shooting down V-1 cruise missiles with less than 100 shells per plane (thousands were typical in earlier AA systems).Baxter, \\"Scientists Against Time\\"Bennett, \\"A History of Control Engineering\\" This system was instrumental in the defense of London and Antwerp against the V-1. Although listed in Land based fire control section anti-aircraft fire control systems can also be found on naval and aircraft systems. Coast artillery fire control Figure 2. A conceptual diagram of the flow of fire control data in the Coast Artillery (in 1940). The set forward point of the target was generated by using the plotting board (1). This position was then corrected for factors affecting range and azimuth (2). Finally, fire was adjusted for observations of the actual fall of the shells (3), and new firing data were sent to the guns.In the United States Army Coast Artillery Corps, Coast Artillery fire control systems began to be developed at the end of the 19th Century and progressed on through World War II.For early background, see \\"Fire Control and Position Finding: Background\\" by Bolling W. Smith in Mark Berhow, Ed., \\"American Seacoast Defenses: A Reference Guide,\\" CDSG Press, McLean, VA, 2004, p. 257. Early systems made use of multiple observation or base end stations (see Figure 1) to find and track targets attacking American harbors. Data from these stations were then passed to plotting rooms, where analog mechanical devices, such as the plotting board, were used to estimate targets' positions and derive firing data for batteries of coastal guns assigned to interdict them. U.S. Coast Artillery fortsSee for example, the write-up on Fort Andrews in Boston Harbor for a summary of artillery assets and fire control systems typical of these defenses. bristled with a variety of armament, ranging from 12-inch coast defense mortars, through 3-inch and 6-inch mid-range artillery, to the larger guns, which included 10-inch and 12-inch barbette and disappearing carriage guns, 14-inch railroad artillery, and 16-inch cannon installed just prior to and up through World War II. Fire control in the Coast Artillery became more and more sophisticated in terms of correcting firing data for such factors as weather conditions, the condition of powder used, or the Earth's rotation. Provisions were also made for adjusting firing data for the observed fall of shells. As shown in Figure 2, all of these data were fed back to the plotting rooms on a finely tuned schedule controlled by a system of time interval bells that rang throughout each harbor defense system.For a complete description of fire control in the Coast Artillery, see \\"FM 4-15 Coast Artillery Field Manual-Seacoast Artillery Fire Control and Position Finding,\\" U.S. War Department, Government Printing Office, Washington, 1940. It was only later in World War II that electro- mechanical gun data computers, connected to coast defense radars, began to replace optical observation and manual plotting methods in controlling coast artillery. Even then, the manual methods were retained as a back-up through the end of the war. Direct and indirect fire control systems Land based fire control systems can be used to aid in both Direct fire and Indirect fire weapon engagement. These systems can be found on weapons ranging from small handguns to large artillery weapons. Modern fire control systems Modern fire-control computers, like all high-performance computers, are digital. The added performance allows basically any input to be added, from air density and wind, to wear on the barrels and distortion due to heating. These sorts of effects are noticeable for any sort of gun, and fire-control computers have started appearing on smaller and smaller platforms. Tanks were one early use that automated gun laying using a laser rangefinder and a barrel-distortion meter. Fire-control computers are not just useful for large cannons. They can be used to aim machine guns, small cannons, guided missiles, rifles, grenades, rockets‚Äîany kind of weapon that can have its launch or firing parameters varied. They are typically installed on ships, submarines, aircraft, tanks and even on some small arms‚Äîfor example, the grenade launcher developed for use on the Fabrique Nationale F2000 bullpup assault rifle. Fire-control computers have gone through all the stages of technology that computers have, with some designs based upon analogue technology and later vacuum tubes which were later replaced with transistors. Fire-control systems are often interfaced with sensors (such as sonar, radar, infra-red search and track, laser range- finders, anemometers, wind vanes, thermometers, barometers, etc.) in order to cut down or eliminate the amount of information that must be manually entered in order to calculate an effective solution. Sonar, radar, IRST and range- finders can give the system the direction to and/or distance of the target. Alternatively, an optical sight can be provided that an operator can simply point at the target, which is easier than having someone input the range using other methods and gives the target less warning that it is being tracked. Typically, weapons fired over long ranges need environmental information‚Äîthe farther a munition travels, the more the wind, temperature, air density, etc. will affect its trajectory, so having accurate information is essential for a good solution. Sometimes, for very long-range rockets, environmental data has to be obtained at high altitudes or in between the launching point and the target. Often, satellites or balloons are used to gather this information. Once the firing solution is calculated, many modern fire-control systems are also able to aim and fire the weapon(s). Once again, this is in the interest of speed and accuracy, and in the case of a vehicle like an aircraft or tank, in order to allow the pilot/gunner/etc. to perform other actions simultaneously, such as tracking the target or flying the aircraft. Even if the system is unable to aim the weapon itself, for example the fixed cannon on an aircraft, it is able to give the operator cues on how to aim. Typically, the cannon points straight ahead and the pilot must maneuver the aircraft so that it oriented correctly before firing. In most aircraft the aiming cue takes the form of a \\"pipper\\" which is projected on the heads-up display (HUD). The pipper shows the pilot where the target must be relative to the aircraft in order to hit it. Once the pilot maneuvers the aircraft so that the target and pipper are superimposed, he or she fires the weapon, or on some aircraft the weapon will fire automatically at this point, in order to overcome the delay of the pilot. In the case of a missile launch, the fire-control computer may give the pilot feedback about whether the target is in range of the missile and how likely the missile is to hit if launched at any particular moment. The pilot will then wait until the probability reading is satisfactorily high before launching the weapon.

It is located on the south of Happy Valley, east of Causeway Bay, and west of Mid-levels East, at an altitude of approximately 433 metres. Nearby hills include Mount Nicholson, Violet Hill and Mount Butler. Administratively, it is part of Wan Chai District. History Jardine's Lookout is named after William Jardine, founder of Jardine Matheson. It was from here, in the days of the sailing ships, that a watch was kept for the first glimpse of the sails of the firm's clippers coming from India and London. As soon as a vessel was signaled, a fast whaleboat was sent out to collect Jardines' mails. The correspondence was rushed back to the office so that the directors could have the first possible information on the world's markets. (This practice saved the company on at least one occasion, in 1866, when it learned of the collapse of the discount house Overend, Gurney and Company, about one hour before others did, and quickly withdrew its balances at a local bank before anyone else had heard of the news.) Jardine's Lookout was the sight of fierce conflict in the Battle of Hong Kong and particularly, the Battle of Wong Nai Chung Gap. The Hong Kong Volunteer Defense Corps and Middlesex Machine gunners manned two pillboxes and other areas defending the pass around Jardine's Catchwater, as well as Canadian Winnipeg Grenadiers defending the adjacent Mount Butler. Japanese forces, after landing on the North Shore of Hong Kong Island; used Sir Cecil's Ride and moved up to this pass midway up the lookout and were engaged by Commonwealth forces. The fighting was the preliminary conflict in the Battle of Wong Nai Chung Gap. Residential area Jardine's Lookout is the hill in the centre. left Due to its scenic view and low population density, Jardine's Lookout has been considered an affluent neighbourhood. Residences situated there are amongst the most expensive of Hong Kong. The community mainly consists of highly- placed expatriates, government officials, and successful business people. The area has large detached houses in private lots and more moderate townhouses. Low-rise and high-rise apartments make up the rest of the community. In 2011, the area had a population of 15,533. This community is conveniently linked with public transportation and well-equipped with facilities. Jardine's Lookout is only a 10-minute drive to Central and 5-minute drive to Causeway Bay, (given good traffic) where the Cross Harbor Tunnel is located, making the travel to the Kowloon easy.

The classification below relates to the United States of America. Different classifications exist in other countries. Fire prevention and control, the prevention, detection, and extinguishment of fires, including such secondary activities as research into the causes of fire, education of the public about fire hazards, and the maintenance and improvement of fire- fighting equipment. The three main components of a fire is fuel, heat and oxygen, without one or the other the fire can not live. within fire control there are different classes of fire; Class -A fires, Class -B fires, Class -C fires, Class -D fires, and class -K fires. Each class is specific to the type of fire and requires a specific approach and by using and understanding the class fires it can help control the fire. When putting out a fire you need to understand what fire extinguisher to use, because if the wrong extinguisher is used it can either make the fire worse or not be controlled. For an example, using a type A, B, C fire extinguisher on a chemical fire will do the opposite of what the extinguisher is supposed to do and it can cause an explosion. The different classes of fire need different fire extinguishers such as; CO2 fire extinguishers, type A, B, or C carbon dioxide fire extinguishers, and the water-based fire extinguisher. Before using a Fire extinguisher it is crucial to understand how the extinguisher works and where to point it, P.A.S.S. is an acronym (Pull, Aim, Squeeze, Shoot) to help remember how to use the extinguisher. Fire Extinguisher CO2 extinguishers let out carbon dioxide to smother the fire and prevents the fire from getting oxygen which will depreciate the fire and it wont be able to breath and will die. Class A extinguisher is meant to be used on fires that have wood, paper, and plastic, class B fire extinguishers are meant be used on liquid fires such as oils, gasoline, kerosine, and paint, and Class C fire extinguishers are to be used on electrical equipment.  Class-A fires  A Class A Fire is a fire that consist of paper, wood, and plastics, this is one of the most common fires along with being the most simplest fire to put out with a fire extinguisher. This class fire can simply be started by starting a campfire in the backyard and an ash from the fire catches the ground on fire or and lightning strike that hits a tree. The most common method to control a class-A fire is to remove heat by spraying the burning solid fuels with water. Another method of controlling a class-A fire would be to reduce the oxygen content of the atmosphere in the immediate vicinity of the fire (i.e., \\"smother\\" the fire), such as by the introduction of an inert gas such as carbon dioxide. In a wildfire, fire control includes various wildland fire suppression techniques such as defensible space, widening the fuel ladder, and removing fuel in the fire's path with firebreaks and backfires to minimize the brush fire reaching new combustible fuel and spreading further.  Class-B fires  Some Class B fires (hydrocarbons, petroleums, and fuels on fire) cannot be efficiently controlled with water. Fuels with a specific gravity less than water, such as gasoline or oil, float on water, resulting in the fire continuing in the fuel on top of the water. The application of a combination of fire suppressant foam mixed with water is a common and effective method of forming a blanket on top of the liquid fuel which eliminates the oxygen needed for combustion. The configuration of some fuels, such as coal and baled waste paper, result in a deep seated and burrowing fire, resulting in less effective fire control by the application of water on the outer surfaces of the fuel. Some Class-B fires can be controlled with the application of chemical fire suppressants. Class B fires should be extinguished by foam, powder or carbon dioxide extinguishers and the foam is more dens and cuts off the oxygen from the fire.  Class-C fires  Class-C fires involve electricity as a continuous power source for the ignition of the fuels associated with electrical equipment, such as plastic cable jackets. The application of water does not always result in effective fire control, and there is a general concern regarding conductivity and personnel safety. Class C fires can be effectively controlled by removing the oxygen. The removal of electricity as a continuous ignition source is important to eliminate re-ignition. Once the electricity is removed, the result is a Class A fire. Foam or dry chemical powder can be used to control fires involving shallow liquid spill. You do not want to use water to put out a class C fire, you can get shocked and cause the fire to grow, the best way to put an electrical fire out is with a dry powder or carbon dioxide, dry chemical ABC extinguisher. If the source of the electricity that started the fire was unplugged and the electricity was turned off then the fire changes to a class A or B fire.  Ventilation  Fires can spread through the interior of a structure as the hot gases spread due to the expansion of the gases as a result of the combustion. Some fires can be partially controlled by venting these gases to the outside through manufactured heat vents in the structure's roof, or by the fire department cutting holes in the roof. Ventilation is important when it comes to the fire service, ventilation is \\"the systematic removal or heat, smoke and fire gases from a structure\\". The main purpose for ventilating a fire is decrease the likelihood of a flashover from occurring. When is the right time to ventilate? You do not want to ventilate when Firefighters are inside, the best time to ventilate is before sending anyone in so that way when venting from the roof that will be the bath the fire will take vs not venting and firefighters going in through the front door and by opening that door it allows more oxygen to feed the fire and the fire will take the path you just made.

It is an attack helicopter with no intended secondary transport capability, better optimized than the Mil Mi-24 gunship for the role. It carries a single gun in an undernose barbette, plus external loads carried on pylons beneath stub wings. Development=Origins In 1972, following the completion of the Mil Mi-24, development began on a unique attack helicopter with transport capability. The new design had a reduced transport capability (3 troops instead of 8) and omitted the cabin to provide better overall performance and higher top speed. Improved performance was important for its intended role fighting against tanks and enemy helicopters and covering helicopter landing operations. Initially, many different designs were considered, including an unconventional project with two main rotors, placed with engines on tips of wings (in perpendicular layout); and in one similarity with the late 1960s-era American Lockheed AH-56 Cheyenne attack helicopter design, with an additional pusher propeller on the tail. In 1977, a preliminary design was chosen in a classic single-rotor layout. It lost its similarity to the Mi-24, and even the canopies were smaller, with flat surfaces. Design work on the Mi-28 began under Marat Tishchenko in 1980.Frawley, Gerald. \\"Mil Mi-28\\". The International Directory of Military Aircraft, 2002/2003, p. 128. Aerospace Publications, 2002. . In 1981, a design and a mock-up were accepted. The prototype (no. 012) first flew on 10 November 1982. The second prototype (no. 022) was completed in 1983. In 1984, the Mi-28 completed the first stage of state trials, but in October 1984 the Soviet Air Force chose the more advanced Kamov Ka-50 as the new anti-tank helicopter. Mi-28 development continued, but given lower priority. In December 1987, Mi-28 production at Rosvertol in Rostov-on-Don was approved. An early production Mi-24 was fitted with an air data boom as an early test for the Mi-28's technologies. Later, a few Mi-24Ds were fitted up with the Mi-28's radome mount to test the sighting-flight-navigational complex's abilities, and others had redesigned fuselages that closely resembled the future Mi-28, but with rounded cockpits.http://www.mvzmil.ru/rus/index.php?id=145 Russian page. Pictures of early Mi-28s can be found here. In January 1988, the first Mi-28A prototype (no. 032) flew. It was fitted with more powerful engines and an \\"X\\" type tail rotor instead of the three-blade version. The Mi-28A debuted at the Paris Air Show in June 1989. In 1991 the second Mi-28A (no. 042) was completed. The Mi-28A program was cancelled in 1993 because it was deemed uncompetitive with the Ka-50, in particular it was not all-weather capable. A Mil Mi-28N on display The Mi-28N was unveiled in 1995, the N designation meaning \\"night\\". The prototype (no. 014) first flew on 14 November 1996. Its most significant feature is a radar in a round cover above the main rotor, similar to that of the American AH-64D Apache Longbow. The Mi-28N also has improved tor vision and an aiming device under the nose, including a TV camera and FLIR. Due to funding problems, development was interrupted. A second prototype with an improved rotor design was unveiled in March 2004 at Rosvertol. Changes in the military situation after the Cold War made specialized anti-tank helicopters less useful. The advantages of the Mi-28N, like all-weather action ability, lower cost, and similarity to the Mi-24, became important. In 2003, the head of the Russian Air Force stated that the Mi-28N and Ka-50 would become the standard Russian attack helicopters. The first serial Mi-28N was delivered to the Army on 5 June 2006.\\"First Mi-28N helicopter passes factory tests\\" . RIA Novosti, 30 May 2006.\\"Russian Air Force receives first Mi-28 Night Hunter helicopter\\" . RIA Novosti, 5 June 2006. By 2015, 67 Mi-28Ns were planned to be purchased, when the Mi-24 was to be completely replaced.\\"Russian military to purchase 10‚Äì15 Mi-28N helicopters per year\\" . RIA Novosti, 22 January 2008. The Rostvertol plant delivered about 140 Mi-28N and Mi-35M helicopters in 2012‚Äì14 to domestic and foreign customers; 28 helicopters were delivered in 2015. Mil also developed an export variant of the Mi-28N, designated Mi-28NE, and a simpler day helicopter variant, the Mi-28D, based on the Mi-28N design, but without radar and FLIR. A fifth-generation derivative, dubbed Mi-28NM, has been in development since 2008. According to then Chief Executive Officer at Russian Helicopters Andrey Shibitov, the criteria for the modernized helicopter include low-radar signature, extended flight range, advanced weapons control system, some capability of a fighter jet and speed up to 600 km/h. In 2016, Russian media reported a new, advanced helmet system designed to display visual information for aiming at targets in any field of view was under development for the MI-28N. Design A Russian Air Force Mi-28 The Mi-28 is a new-generation attack helicopter that functions as an air-to-air and air-to-ground partner for the Mi-24 Hind and Ka-50 Hokum. The five-blade main rotor is mounted above the body midsection, short, wide, tapered, weapon- carrying wings are mounted to the rear of the body midsection. Two turboshaft engines in pods are mounted alongside the top of the fuselage with downturned exhausts. The fuselage is slender and tapers to the tail boom and nose. It features tandem, stepped-up cockpits, a cannon mounted beneath the belly, and a non-retractable tricycle tail-wheel type landing gear. Due to the energy- absorbing landing gear and seats the crew can survive a vertical fall of up to 12 m/s. The Mi-28 has a fully armoured cabin, including the windshield, which withstands 7.62 and 12.7 mm armor piercing bullets and 20 mm shell fragments. The helicopter design is based on the conventional pod and boom configuration, with a tail rotor. The main rotor head has elastomeric bearings and the main rotor blades are made from composite materials. The tail rotor is designed on a biplane configuration, with independently controlled X-shaped blades. A new design of all-plastic rotor blades, which can sustain 30 mm shells, is installed on the Mi-28N night attack variant. Mi-28N with radar station and new nose sensors It is equipped with two heavily armored cockpits, a windshield able to withstand 12.7‚Äì14.5 mm caliber bullets, in-nose electronics, and a narrow-X tail rotor (55 deg), with reduced noise characteristics. It is powered by two 2,200 hp Isotov TV-3-117VM (t/n 014) turboshaft engines. While the Mi-28 is not intended for use as a transport, it does have a small passenger compartment capable of carrying three people. The planned purpose of this is the rescue of downed helicopter crews. The Mi-28N features a helmet mounted display for the pilot. The pilot designates targets for the navigator/weapons officer, who proceeds to fire the weapons required to fulfill that particular task. The integrated surveillance and fire control system has two optical channels providing wide and narrow fields of view, a narrow-field-of-view optical television channel, and laser rangefinder. The system can move within 110 degrees in azimuth and from +13 to ‚àí40 degrees in elevation. nose sensors The night attack variant helicopter retains most of the structural design of the original Mi-28. The main difference is the installation of an integrated electronic combat system. Other modifications include: new main gearbox for transmitting higher power to the rotor, new high-efficiency blades with swept-shaped tips, and an engine fuel injection control. The pilot uses a helmet-mounted target designator, which allocates the target to the navigator's surveillance and fire control system. The navigator/weapons officer is then able to employ guided weapons or guns against the target. The targeting system follows the direction of the pilot's eyes. Russia's military rotary-wing aircraft fleet has been fully refitted with new night vision goggles (NVG). Mil Mi-28N attack helicopters of the Russian Aerospace Forces (VKS) received GEO-ONV1-family NVGs. Armament The Mi-28 is equipped with a chin-mounted NPPU-28 turret with 30 mm automatic Shipunov 2A42 autocannon. It has selective fire, and a dual-feed, which allows for a cyclic rate of fire between 200 and 800 rounds per minute. Its effective range varies from 1,500 meters for ground vehicles to 2,500 meters for airborne targets. Rounds from High Explosive Incendiary (HEI) to Armour- Piercing Discarding Sabot (APDS) can be used. Stated penetration for the 3UBR8 round is 25 mm of RHA at 1,500 meters. Mil Mi-28 gun mounting One common Mi-28 armament are a pair of 8 Ataka missile racks along with 2 B-13L rocket pods, each able to carry 5 S-13 rockets. Other rocket options include two B-8 rocket pods, each able to carry 20 S-8 rockets. There are four variants of the Ataka missile for different tasks. The 9M120 Tandem High Explosive Anti-Tank (HEAT) warhead variant is used against tanks fitted with Explosive Reactive Armor (ERA), its stated penetrative ability is 800 mm Rolled Homogeneous Armour (RHA). The 9M120F thermobaric variant is used against infantry, buildings, bunkers, and caves. The 9M120O expanding rod warhead variant is used against helicopters. All the variants have a range of 6 km. The 9M120M improved version has a longer range (8 km) and better penetration (900 mm of RHA). All variants use SACLOS missile guidance. The S-8 and S-13 rockets used by the Mi-28 are usually unguided. In the most common configuration, one can expect 40 S-8 rockets or 10 S-13 rockets. Both rockets have their variants, from HEAT warheads to thermobaric warheads. The S-8 has a shorter range and smaller warhead than the S-13, but compensates with numbers. Currently, the Russian Air Force are upgrading their S-8 and S-13 rockets to laser guided missiles with the proposed Ugroza (\\"Menace\\") system. Rockets upgraded under Ugroza received the designations S-8Kor and S-13Kor, respectively. The Mi-28 can also carry the IR guided R-73 air-to-air missiles, the Kh-25 air-to-surface missiles as well as up to 500 kg aerial bombs. Operational history=Russia First serial Mi-28N has successfully completed flight and armament tests in late May 2006 and was subsequently handed to the ranks on 5 June 2006. The variant was accepted into service with the Russian Air Force three years later, in October 2009. It was assumed the Mi-28N would fully replace the older Mi-24 variant in the Russian Armed Forces by 2015. In September 2011, six Mi-28Ns of the Russian Air Force took part in the 2011 Union Shield joint Russian-Belarusian military exercise at the Ashuluk training ground in Astrakhan Oblast, Russia. To improve training of pilots for the Mi-28N, the Russian Defense Ministry announced to procure up to 60 Mi-28UB training-and-combat versions by 2020. Four to six Mi-28UBs would be purchased for every unit that operates the Mi-28N. An initial batch of 24 Mi-28UB training-and-combat helicopters was ordered in April 2016, and first two serial Mi-28UBs arrived at the Torzhok Air Base on 16 November 2017. In October 2016, a prototype of upgraded Mi-28NM helicopter performed its maiden flight. The Russian Defence Ministry has ordered first batch of Mi-28NM helicopters in December 2017, not disclosing the number of helicopters ordered. In March 2019, a Mi-28NM prototype was seen accompanied by a Mi-24/Mi-35M during a combat sortie over a rebel-held territory in the northern Hama. It was reported the helicopter was sent to Syria to underwent testing in difficult weather and climatic conditions. The Russian Air Force has received first two serial Mi-28NMs on 23 June 2019. A month later, during the International Military-Technical Forum ¬´ARMY-2019¬ª, the Russian Defence Ministry and Rostec signed a long-term contract for supply of 98 Mi-28NMs by 2027. =2015 Russian military intervention in Syria= In the course of the Syrian civil war, the Mi-28N had its combat debut during the 2016 Battle of Palmyra when several Mi-28Ns of the Russian Air Force supported the Syrian Arab Army (SAA) in their advance towards the city. During their support to SAA, Russia's Mi-28Ns targeted several IS positions with S-8 unguided rockets and 9M120 Ataka anti-tank guided missiles. Kenya In late 2011, Kenya began the process of acquiring 16 Mi-28 ground attack helicopters for its Embakasi based 50th Air Cavalry Division. The helicopter gunships were set to be delivered to the 50th Air Cavalry Division in Kenya on 3 January 2012, from the Russian state owned corporation Rosoboronexport, which is an intermediary for all imports and exports of military related hardware. However, in 2013, Oboronprom denied reports that the type had been accepted for service with the Kenyan military. Iraq In October 2012, it was reported that Russia and Iraq may sign a US$4.2‚Äì$5.0 billion weapons contract, including purchase of 30 Mi-28NE helicopters.\\"Baby Come Back: Iraq is Buying Russian Weapons Again\\" . defenseindustrydaily.com, 12 November 2012.

It was primarily intended for the \\"Aerial Infantry Fighting Vehicle\\" category as a successor to the Mil Mi-24 and Mi-8 assault helicopters. It was planned to use two 1,863 kW Klimov TV3-117 turboshaft engines, four-blade main rotor, four-blade Delta H tail rotor (both from the Mi-28), and retractable tricycle-type landing gear. It was expected to weigh 11‚Äì12,000 kg and estimated to attain a 3300 m ceiling, a 314 km/h maximum speed and a 260 km/h cruise speed. Specifications required the functioning in day, night and poor weather as well as carrying eight soldiers (the design achieved seven in practice), eight stretchers or large external loads. An emphasis was placed on survivability with a focus on redundancy, IR suppression and special shock absorbers for the crew to increase the maximum \\"safe\\" crash velocity. The design incorporated a 23 mm rotary cannon (most likely GSh-23L) for defense in the forward hemisphere and a 12.7 mm heavy machine gun (most likely Yak-B) for defense in the rear. Fuselage fairings containing fuel replaced stub wings with missiles mounted above on special hardpoints. Its design borrowed much from the Mil Mi-36 developed over the previous two years, and was itself replaced after a year by the Mil Mi-42 project. Although the Mi-40 design was resurrected for a short period in the 1990s, with optimization studies being completed, it did not reach the prototype stage.

To the extent that this standard is accepted by all parties, one can speak of an absolute phase in a particular field of application. Sound reproduction In the reproduction of sound by headphones or loudspeakers, absolute phase refers the phase of the reproduced signal relative to the original signal, retaining the original polarity. A positive pressure on the microphone is reproduced as a positive pressure by the loudspeaker or headphones driver. For instance, the plosive \\"p\\" sound from a vocalist sends an initial positive air pressure wave toward the microphone which responds with an initial inward movement of the microphone diaphragm, away from the vocalist. To maintain absolute phase, a loudspeaker reproducing the sound would send an initial positive pressure outward from the loudspeaker, toward the listener. In audio, a change in polarity refers to an equal phase shift of 180¬∞ at all frequencies, usually produced on one channel by reversing the connections of two wires. Some audiophiles claim that reversing the polarities of all the channels simultaneously makes a subtle perceptible difference in the reproduced sound, even though the relative phases of all the channels are preserved.Absolute Phase: A Prerequisite To Optimum Performance The ear is sensitive to the periodicity of a waveform at low frequencies; tests have shown that absolute phase can sometimes be heard by test subjects listening with monaural conditions (a single loudspeaker, or headphones sending the same signal to both ears.) Audio engineer Douglas Self concludes \\"there is a prima facie case for the audibility of absolute phase\\", especially for high impulse sounds such as percussion. The concept of absolute phase is rendered irrelevant for any instrument with strings (such as a guitar or piano), or for two or more instruments played together. Complex sounds such as these are known to have an undetectable phase relationship. In practice, the absolute phase of an audio system can be assumed to be inaudible. Power electronics When dealing with power electronics, the phase of the voltage and current at various points in the system relative to one another are important. If the points of interest are widely separated in space, it can be difficult to measure the relative phase. To solve this problem, the phase of the signals relative to absolute time (UTC) is measured using instruments relying on GPS. Comparison of two absolute phases in this sense allows the relative phase of distant signals to be computed.Arbiter Systems - Absolute Phase Signal processing In signal processing a pulse or finite wavetrain can be considered as a signal of a single frequency modulated by an envelope, or as a superposition of an infinite number of infinitesimal waves of different frequencies.reference needed In the first case, one may speak of the phase of the wave with respect to the envelope as the absolute phase. In the second picture, it is a question of the relative phase of the component frequencies. For examples of physical effects due to the phase of signals with the same power spectrum.

A taxi dancer is a paid dance partner in a partner dance. Taxi dancers are hired to dance with their customers on a dance-by-dance basis. When taxi dancing first appeared in taxi-dance halls during the early 20th century in the United States, male patrons would typically buy dance tickets for a small sum each.Cressey (1932), pp. 3, 11, 17.Freeland, David. Automats, Taxi Dances, and Vaudeville: Excavating Manhattan's Lost Places of Leisure. (New York: NYU Press, 2009), p. 192. When a patron presented a ticket to a chosen taxi dancer, she would dance with him for the length of a single song. The taxi dancers would earn a commission on every dance ticket earned. Though taxi dancing has for the most part disappeared in the United States, it is still practiced in some other countries. Etymology The term \\"taxi dancer\\" comes from the fact that, as with a taxi-cab driver, the dancer's pay is proportional to the time he or she spends dancing with the customer. Patrons in a taxi-dance hall typically purchased dance tickets for ten cents each, which gave rise to the term \\"dime-a-dance girl\\". Other names for a taxi dancer are \\"dance hostess\\" and \\"taxi\\" (in Argentina). In the 1920s and 30s, the term \\"nickel hopper\\" gained popularity in the United States because out of each dime-a-dance, the taxi dancer typically earned five cents.Cressey, Paul G. The Taxi-Dance Hall: A Sociological Study in Commercialized Recreation and City Life (Montclair, NJ: Patterson-Smith Publishing Co., 1969), p. 17 History Lobby card for The Taxi Dancer (1927) Taxi dancing traces its origins to the Barbary Coast district of San Francisco which evolved from the California Gold Rush of 1849. In its heyday the Barbary Coast was an economically thriving place of mostly men that was frequented by gold prospectors and sailors from all over the world.Asbury, Herbert. The Barbary Coast: An Informal History of the San Francisco Underworld. (New York: Basic Books, 2002), p. 3. That district created a unique form of dance hall called the Barbary Coast dance hall, also known as the Forty-Nine['49] dance hall. Within a Barbary Coast dance hall female employees danced with male patrons, and earned their living from commissions paid for by the drinks they could encourage their male dance partners to buy.Cressey (1932), p. 179. Still later after the San Francisco Earthquake of 1906 and during early days of jazz music, a new entertainment district developed in San Francisco and was nicknamed Terrific Street.Knowles (1954), p. 64.Asbury (1933), p. 99.Stoddard, Tom. Jazz On The Barbary Coast. (Berkeley, CA: Heyday Books, 1982), p. 10. And within that district an innovative dance hall, The So Different Club, implemented a system where customers could buy a token which entitled them to one dance with a female employee.Stoddard (1982), p. 13. Since dancing had become a popular pastime, many of The So Different Club's patrons would go there to see and learn the latest new dances.Asbury (1933), p. 293. However in 1913 San Francisco enacted new laws that would forbid dancing in any cafe or saloon where alcohol was served.Asbury (1933), p. 303. The closure of the dance halls on Terrific Street fostered a new kind of pay-to-dance scheme, called a closed dance hall, which did not serve alcohol.Cressey (1932), p. 181. That name was derived from the fact that female customers were not allowed ‚Äî the only women permitted in these halls were the dancing female employees.Report of Public Dance Hall Committee of San Francisco of California Civic League of Women Voters, p. 14 The closed dance hall introduced the ticket-a-dance system which became the centerpiece of the taxi-dance hall business model. A taxi dancer would earn her income by the number of tickets she could collect in exchange for dances. Taxi dancing then spread to Chicago where dance academies, which were struggling to survive, began to adopt the ticket-a-dance system for their students.Cressey (1932), p. 183. The first instance of the ticket-a-dance system in Chicago occurred at Mader-Johnson Dance Studios. The dance studio's owner, Godfrey Johnson, describes his innovation: This system was so popular at dance academies that taxi-dancing system quickly spread to an increasing number of non-instructional dance halls. Taxi dancers typically received half of the ticket price as wages and the other half paid for the orchestra, dance hall, and operating expenses.Cressey (1932), p. 3. Although they only worked a few hours a night, they frequently made two to three times the salary of a woman working in a factory or a store.Cressey (1932), p. 12. At that time, the taxi-dance hall surpassed the public ballroom in becoming the most popular place for urban dancing.Cressey (1932), p. xxxiii. Taxi-dance halls flourished in the United States during the 1920s and 1930s, as scores of taxi-dance halls opened in Chicago, New York, and other major cities. In 1931 there were over 100 taxi-dance halls in New York City alone, patronized by between 35,000 and 50,000 men every week.VanderKooi, Ronald. University of Illinois at Chicago Circle, March 1969.Freeland (2009), p. 190. However, by the mid 1920s, in New York City and other towns and cities across the United States, taxi-dance halls were coming under increasing attack by reform movements who deemed some establishments dens of iniquity, populated mainly by charity girls or outright prostitutes. Reform in the form of licensing and police supervision was insisted on, and eventually some dance halls were closed for lewd behavior.Freeland (2009), p. 194. In San Francisco where it all started, the police commission ruled against the employment of women as taxi dancers in 1921, and taxi dancing in San Francisco would forever become illegal.Cressey (1932), p. 182. After World War II the popularity of taxi dancing in the United States began to diminish. By the mid-1950s large numbers of taxi-dance halls had disappeared, and although a handful of establishments tried to hold on for a few more years in New York City and elsewhere, taxi dancing had all but vanished from the nightlife scene in the U.S. by the 1960s.Clyde Vedder: \\"Decline of the Taxi-Dance Hall,\\" Sociology and Social Research, 1954. Background of the taxi dancer What is generally known today about the taxi dancer of the 1930s comes from a major sociological study published by The University of Chicago Press in 1932 (see Classic sociological study below). According to the study, the typical taxi dancer in the 1920s and 30s was an attractive young woman between the age 15 and 28 who was usually single. Although some dancers were undoubtedly older, the taxi-dancer profession skewed strongly toward the young and single. A majority of the young women came from homes in which there was little or no financial support from a father or father figure. The dancers were occasionally runaways from their families, and it was not unusual for a young woman to be from a home where the parents had separated. Despite their relatively young age range, a sizable percentage of taxi dancers had been previously married. Many times the dancers were immigrants from European countries, such as Poland, Sweden, the Netherlands, Germany, and France. Due to cultural differences, conflicts often would arise between parents and their dancing offspring, especially if the parents were originally from rural areas. Sometimes a young woman of an immigrant family who worked as a taxi dancer was the primary financial support of the family. When this occurred and the young woman supplanted the parent or parents as breadwinner, sometimes she would assume an aggressive role in the family by \\"subordinating the parental standards to her own requirements and demands.\\" These conflicts in values between young women taxi dancers and their parents frequently caused the young women to lead so-called \\"double lives,\\" denying that they worked at a taxi-dance hall. To further this divide, the young women would sometimes adopt aliases so that their activities might not reach their families' ears. When parents found out, there were three typical outcomes: the young woman either gave up her dancing career, or she left home and became estranged from the family, or the family accepted the young women's conduct, however reluctantly, due to financial necessity. Despite the frequent hardships, the 1932 sociological study found that many taxi dancers seemed to enjoy the lifestyle and its enticements of \\"money, excitement, and affection.\\" Most young women interviewed for the study spoke favorably about their experiences in the taxi-dance hall. One dancer [case #15] from the 1920s describes her start at a taxi-dance hall: And yet another dancer from Chicago [case #11] spoke very positively of her experiences: Classic sociological study In 1932, The Taxi-Dance Hall: A Sociological Study in Commercialized Recreation and City Life by researcher Paul G. Cressey was published by The University of Chicago Press. Examining the taxi-dancing milieu in Chicago, utilizing vivid, firsthand interviews of taxi dancers as well as their patrons, the book brought to light the little known world of the taxi dance hall. The study is now considered one of the classic urban ethnographies of the Chicago School.Fritz, Angela. \\"I was a Sociological Stranger‚Äô: Ethnographic Fieldwork and Undercover Performance in the Publication of The Taxi‚ÄêDance Hall, 1925‚Äì1932\\", Gender & History, Vol. 30, No. 1, March 2018, pp. 131‚Äì152. Vocabulary of the dancers As taxi dancing evolved to become a staple in the American nightlife of the 1920s and 30s, taxi dancers developed an argot of their own. In his 1932 sociological study, Cressey took note of the specialized vocabulary in the Chicago dance halls:Cressey, Paul G. The Taxi-Dance Hall: A Sociological Study in Commercialized Recreation and City Life ((Montclair, NJ: Patterson Smith, 1969), pp. 33‚Äì37. Taxi dancers today Although the ticket-per-dance system of taxi dancing has become nearly nonexistent in the United States and around the world, some nightclubs and dance instruction establishments continue to offer dancers who may be hired as dance partners.Kilgannon, Corey. \\"At $2 a Dance, a Remedy for Loneliness\\" The New York Times, February 20, 2006. Most often these dance partners are female, but sometimes male. Instead of being called taxi dancers, the dancers are today usually referred to as \\"dance hostesses.\\" Dance hostesses are often employed to assist beginners to learn to dance or may be utilized to further the general goal of building the dance community of an establishment. In social settings and social forms of dance, a partner wanting constructive feedback from a dance hostess must explicitly request it. As the hostess's role is primarily social, she (or he) is unlikely to criticize directly. Due to the increased profile of partner dances during the 2000s, hostessing has become more common in settings where partners are in short supply, for either male or female dancers. For example, male dancers are often employed on cruise ships to dance with single female passengers. This system is usually referred to as the Dance Host program. Dance hostesses (male and female) are also available for hire in Vienna, Austria, where dozens of formal balls are held each year. Volunteer dance hostesses (experienced male and female dancers) are often used in dance styles such as Ceroc to help beginners. United States There remain a handful of nightclubs in the United States, particularly in the cities of New York and Los Angeles, where an individual can pay to dance with a female dance hostess.Kilgannon (February 20, 2006). Usually these modern clubs forgo the use of the ticket-a-dance system, and instead have time-clocks and punch-cards that allow a patron to pay for the dancer's time by the hour. Some of these dance clubs operate in buildings where taxi dancing was done in the early 20th century. No longer called taxi- dance halls, these latter-day establishments are now called hostess clubs.Wright, Evan. \\"Dance With A Stranger\\", LA Weekly, January 20, 1999. Argentina The growth of tango tourism in Buenos Aires, Argentina, has led to an increase in formal and informal dance hostess services in the milongas, or dance halls. While some operators attempt to sell holiday romance, reputable tango agencies offer genuine host services to tourists who find it hard to cope with the cabeceo‚Äîthe eye contact and nodding-method of finding a dance partner. Taxi dancers in popular culture Since the 1920s when taxi dancing boomed in popularity, various films, songs and novels have been released reflecting the pastime, often using the taxi-dance hall as a setting or chronicling the lives of taxi dancers.

It is known as the Mi-8M series in Russian service. It is a medium twin-turbine transport helicopter. There are also armed gunship versions. Development Developed from the basic Mi-8 airframe, the Mi-17 was fitted with the larger Klimov TV3-117MT engines, rotors, and transmission developed for the Mi-14, along with fuselage improvements for heavier loads. Optional engines for \\"hot and high\\" conditions are the 1545 kW (2070 shp) Isotov TV3-117VM. Recent exports to China and Venezuela for use in high mountains have the new Klimov VK-2500 version of the Klimov TV3-117 engine with FADEC control. The designation Mi-17 is for export; Russian armed forces call it Mi-8MT. The Mi-17 can be recognized because it has the tail rotor on the port side instead of the starboard side, and dust shields in front of the engine intakes. Engine cowls are shorter than on the TV2-powered Mi-8, not extending as far over the cockpit, and an opening for a bleed air valve outlet is present forward of the exhaust. Actual model numbers vary by builder, engine type, and other options. As an example, the sixteen new Ulan-Ude-built machines delivered to the Czech Air Force in 2005 with -VM model engines were designated as Mi-171Sh, a development of the Mi-8AMTSh. Modifications include a new large door on the right side, improved Czech-built APU, and Kevlar armor plates around the cockpit area and engines. Eight have a loading ramp in place of the usual clamshell doors and can load a vehicle up to the size of an SUV. In May 2008 licensed production of the Mi-17 started in China, with production being led by Mil Moscow Helicopter Plant JSC and the Sichuan Lantian Helicopter Company Limited in Chengdu, Sichuan province. The plant built 20 helicopters in 2008, using Russian Ulan-Ude-supplied kits; production is expected to reach 80 helicopters per year eventually. The variants to be built by Lantian will include the Mi-171, Mi-17V-5, and Mi-17V7.Mi-17 Hip Multirole Helicopter. Retrieved on 25 May 2008. Operational history=Service usage Macedonian Air Force Mi-17 performing a very tight low-level right turn Mi-17s were used during the Cambodian government's 1996 dry season offensive, five of them being converted to helicopter gunships equipped with 57 mm rocket pods and providing air support for ground forces attacking the Khmer Rouge stronghold of Pailin. In May 1999, during Operation Safed Sagar, the Mi-17 was used in the first air phase of the Kargil War by 129HU of the Indian Air Force against Pakistani regular and Pakistan-backed militant forces. One Mi-17 was downed by a shoulder-fired missile, and a fighter aircraft was lost in combat. This led the withdrawal of armed helicopters and attacks by fixed-wing aircraft began. The Mi-17 was used extensively by the Sri Lanka Air Force in Sri Lanka's war on terrorism by the LTTE. Seven of them were lost in combat and attacks on airports. The Mi-17 was used by the Colombian Army in Operation Jaque. Freelance pilot Neall Ellis operated an Mi-17 in support of the Sierra Leonne government in the Sierra Leone Civil War, ferrying ammunition and other supplies to government troops. In 2001, the Macedonian Air Force used the Mi-17 against Albanian insurgents. US Special Forces in Afghanistan extensively used CIA-operated Mi-17s during the initial stages of Operation Enduring Freedom.https://www.cia.gov/news-information/featured-story- archive/2019-featured-story-archive/cia2019s-mi-17-helicopter-comes-home.html Executive Outcomes used them extensively in its operations in the Angolan Civil War. The Mi-17 is used as a commercial passenger aircraft by Air Koryo, national airline of North Korea. Previous flights include those between Pyongyang and Kaesong and Pyongyang and Haeju. The Mexican Navy uses its Mi-17s for anti-narcotic operations such as locating marijuana fields and dispatching marines to eradicate the plantations. The Slovak Air Force and Croatian Air Force operated Mi-17s in Kosovo as part of KFOR. Both the pro- Gaddafi and anti-Gaddafi forces in the 2011 Libyan civil war have operated Mi-17s. Afghan Air Force Mi-17 showing the clamshell cargo door arrangement Mi-17s are operated by the Afghan Air Force. In July 2010 two Mi-17 were flown by a mixed crew of United States Air Force and Afghan Air Force personnel in a 13-hour mission that rescued 2,080 civilians from flood waters. This was the largest rescue by two helicopters in USAF history. USAF pilot Lt Col Gregory Roberts received the Distinguished Flying Cross for the mission. On 24 November 2015, a Russian Mi-8AMTsh was forced to land when it was hit by insurgent machine gun fire during the combat rescue mission of the ejected crew of the Russian Su-24 that was shot down by a Turkish Air Force F-16 earlier in the day. A Russian marine died in the attack, while the rest of the crew was recovered by another helicopter. The downed air-frame was destroyed with a TOW missile fired by local insurgents. During Tham Luang cave rescue incident in July 2018, Thai army used the MI-17 helicopter for searching operation and evacuating the first batch of survivors from Tham Luang to Chiang Rai hospital and on 10 July 2018 a Mil Mi-17 helicopter took the last evacuated boy to the hospital. On 11 February 2020, a Syrian Air Force Mi-17 utility helicopter was shot-down by Turkish-backed rebel forces using an American designed MANPADShttps://uawire.org/russia-accuses-turkey-of- providing-american-made-weapons-for-militants-in-syria over Al-Nayrab, killing everyone aboard.https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/syrian-rebels-shoot-down- assad-helicopter-as-violence-escalates-in-idlib-whpvxfl8d A second Mi-17 of the Syrian Army was shot down in Idlib under similar circumstances, killing all crew, on 14 February 2020. Recent orders In October 2007, the Saudi Arabian Government cancelled the purchase of 64 NHIndustries NH90 helicopters and agreed to buy 150 Russian-made Mil Mi-17 and Mi-35 helicopters instead. On 28 October 2008 the Royal Thai Army announced a deal to buy six Mi-17s to meet its requirement for a medium-lift helicopter. This is the first time the Thai armed forces have acquired Russian aircraft instead of American aircraft.Bangkok Post Army to buy Russian choppers Flight International quotes the Thai Army's rationale: \\"We are buying three Mi-17 helicopters for the price of one Black Hawk. The Mi-17 can also carry more than 30 troops, while the Black Hawk could carry only 13 soldiers. These were the key factors behind the decision.\\" On 15 December 2008, it was reported that India ordered 80 Mi-17V-5 helicopters worth $1.375 billion, which would be delivered to the Indian Air Force between 2011 and 2014 to replace aging Mi-8s.\\"Russia delivers 80 Mi-17 helicopters to India\\". 9 November 2011 In August 2010, it was reported that India planned to order another 59 Mi-17s.

On 10 July 2009, it was announced that Chile would pursue talks with Russia to purchase five Mi-17 multi-role helicopters for the Chilean Air Force, despite pressure from the United States. However, as of January 2013, it seems that these plans were canceled. On 16 September 2009, the United States Navy delivered the last two of four Mi-17s to the Afghan National Army Air Corps. On 19 June 2010, it was announced that the US government would buy and refurbish 31 more Mi-17 helicopters from Russia to supply the Afghan Air Force. The US was reportedly considering adding the helicopter to the US military for special forces use in order to obscure troop movements.U.S. military criticized for purchase of Russian copters for Afghan air corps . Washington Post, The US has used some Mi-8s and Mi-17s for training, and has purchased units for allies in Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan. In August 2010 a contract was signed by the Argentine Air Force for two Mi-17Es, plus an option on another three, to support Antarctic bases.Argentina formaliza la compra de cinco MI-17 In September 2010, the Polish Defense Minister announced that his country would buy five new Mi-17s from Russia, to support Polish operations in Afghanistan. All five Mi-17-1Vs were delivered by 2011. In 2011, Chief of Staff of the Afghan National Army Abdul Wahab Wardak announced that the US government will buy Mi-17s for use by Afghanistan's troops. He explained the choice of the Russian helicopter over the American Chinook was due to the familiarity of the Afghan technical and pilot staff with the helicopter type and that it is better suited for Afghanistan's environment. The United States continued to purchase the helicopters for Afghanistan in 2013, despite a congressional prohibition.\\"Pentagon to keep buying Russian helicopters.\\" Overall, 63 Mi-17s were acquired through the 2011 contract at a cost of US$16.4 to US$18.4 million each, or US$4 to US$6 million more each than a refurbished American Chinook.

They are sometimes known as targeting radars, or in the UK, gun-laying radars. If the radar is used to guide a missile, it is often known as an target illuminator or illuminator radar. A typical fire-control radar emits a narrow, intense beam of radio waves to ensure accurate tracking information and to minimize the chance of losing track of the target. This makes them less suitable for initial detection of the target, and FCRs are often partnered with a medium-range search radar to fill this role. In British terminology, these medium-range systems were known as tactical control radars. Most modern radars have a track-while-scan capability, enabling them to function simultaneously as both fire-control radar and search radar. This works either by having the radar switch between sweeping the search sector and sending directed pulses at the target to be tracked, or by using a phased-array antenna to generate multiple simultaneous radar beams that both search and track. Operational phases Fire-control radars operate in three different phases: ;Designation or vectoring phase: The fire-control radar must be directed to the general location of the target due to the radar's narrow beam width. This phase is also called \\"lighting up\\". It ends when lock-on is acquired. ;Acquisition phase: The fire-control radar switches to the acquisition phase of operation once the radar is in the general vicinity of the target. During this phase, the radar system searches in the designated area in a predetermined search pattern until the target is located or redesignated. This phase terminates when a weapon is launched. ;Tracking phase: The fire-control radar enters into the track phase when the target is located. The radar system locks onto the target during this phase. This phase ends when the target is destroyed. Performance The performance of a fire-control radar is determined primarily by two factors: radar resolution and atmospheric conditions. Radar resolution is the ability of the radar to differentiate between two targets closely located. The first, and most difficult, is range resolution, finding exactly how far is the target. To do this well, in a basic fire-control radar system, it must send very short pulses. Bearing resolution is typically ensured by using a narrow (one or two degree) beam width. Atmospheric conditions, such as moisture lapse, temperature inversion, and dust particles affect radar performance as well. Moisture lapse and temperature inversion often cause ducting, in which RF energy is bent as it passes through hot and cold layers. This can either extend or shorten the radar horizon, depending on which way the RF is bent. Dust particles, as well as water droplets, cause attenuation of the RF energy, resulting in a loss of effective range. In both cases, a lower pulse repetition frequency makes the radar less susceptible to atmospheric conditions. Countermeasures Most fire-control radars have unique characteristics, such as radio frequency, pulse duration, pulse frequency and power. These can assist in identifying the radar, and therefore the weapon system it is controlling. This can provide valuable tactical information, like the maximum range of the weapon, or flaws that can be exploited, to combatants that are listening for these signs. During the Cold War Soviet fire control radars were often named and NATO pilots would be able to identify the threats present by the radar signals they received. Surface based One of the first successful fire-control radars, the SCR-584, was used effectively and extensively by the Allies during World War II for anti- aircraft gun laying. Since World War II, the U.S. Army has used radar for directing anti-aircraft missiles including the MIM-23 Hawk, the Nike series and currently the MIM-104 Patriot. Ship based Examples of fire-control radars currently in use by the United States Navy: *Mk 95 ‚Äî Continuous Wave Illuminator (NATO Sea sparrow Surface Missile System) *Mk 92 ‚Äî Combined Antenna System (Mk 75 Gun, formerly SM-1 missiles) *AN/SPG-62 ‚Äî Continuous Wave Illuminator (AEGIS) *AN/SPQ-9B ‚Äî Pulse Doppler (Mk 45 lightweight gun) Aircraft based After World War II, airborne fire control radars have evolved from the simpler gun and rocket laying AN/APG-36 system used in the F-86D to the Active electronically scanned array based AN/APG-81 of the F-35.

Cerro El C√≥ndor is a remote peak in the Argentine Puna de Atacama. As such it was probably the last major 6000m+ peak in the Andes to be climbed, with the summit reaching a height of . The volcano has the form of a massif (which covers a surface of ) constructed by two separate volcanoes; the older edifice forms parts of the northern and eastern flanks which are cut by scarps interpreted as caldera remnants.Grosse et al. 2018, p.14 The summit region is formed by the newer edifice, and features a series of craters with diameters of and a cover of pyroclastic material and scoria.

Design and development Formal development of an anti-submarine warfare (ASW) version of the Mil Mi-8 transport helicopter was authorised by the Soviet Communist Party Central Committee and Council of Ministers in April 1965, with the objective of replacing the Mil Mi-4 in the short-range, shore based anti-submarine role. The new helicopter was required to have an endurance of 2 hours on station at a radius of from base.Mladenov Air International March 2001, pp. 184‚Äì186. The new design (with the internal designation V-14) differed from the Mi-8 in having a boat-like hull similar to the Sea King, allowing it to operate off the water, and a retractable four- point undercarriage, with the mainwheels retracting into large sponsons on the rear of the fuselage. The helicopter was to be powered by two Klimov TV3-117MT turboshaft engines. A watertight weapons bay is fitted to the centreline of the fuselage allowing internal carriage of a single torpedo or eight depth charges, while a radome housing a search radar is fitted beneath the nose.Gunston 1995, p. 238. The first prototype V-14, converted from a Mi-8 and powered by the older and less powerful Klimov TV2-117 engines, flew on 1 August 1967. Development was slowed by problems with the helicopter's avionics and due to reliability problems with the TV3-117 engines, with production at Kazan not starting until 1973, and the helicopter (now designated Mi-14) entering service on 11 May 1976. Allegedly due to the strong pressure from the United States, all Russian antisubmarine Mi-14 helicopters were decommissioned in 1996. In May 2015, RT has reported that Mi-14 is being highly sought after by the Russian Black Sea and the Northern Fleets, and that Kazan Helicopter Works (KVZ) is preparing to return 10 previously decommissioned helicopters to active Russian Navy service with the production of new units beginning within five years. The initial demand was estimated at 100 helicopters. In January 2016, Russian Helicopters confirmed to Russian News Agency TASS that no final decision to revive production had been taken, but market demand, feasibility studies ‚Äì including with Moscow's defence ministry ‚Äì and funding sources were under review. The programme remains a ‚Äúpriority‚Äù for Russian Helicopters. The company suggested the Mi-14 would appeal to civil operators in Russia's far north and those supplying the oil and gas industry, alongside the nation's armed forces. Out of the almost 300 Mi-14s produced at Kazan Helicopters between 1973 and 1986, it is estimated that just 44 examples remain in active service.

The hexagon is AbCaBc. thumbPappus's theorem: affine form Ab\\\\parallel aB, Bc\\\\parallel bC \\\\Rightarrow Ac\\\\parallel aC In mathematics, Pappus's hexagon theorem (attributed to Pappus of Alexandria) states that *given one set of collinear points A, B, C, and another set of collinear points a,b,c, then the intersection points X,Y,Z of line pairs Ab and aB, Ac and aC, Bc and bC are collinear, lying on the Pappus line. These three points are the points of intersection of the \\"opposite\\" sides of the hexagon AbCaBc. It holds in a projective plane over any field, but fails for projective planes over any noncommutative division ring.Coxeter, pp. 236‚Äì7 Projective planes in which the \\"theorem\\" is valid are called pappian planes. If one restricts the projective plane such that the Pappus line u is the line at infinity, one gets the affine version of Pappus's theorem shown in the second diagram. If the Pappus line u and the lines g,h have a point in common, one gets the so-called little version of Pappus's theorem Rolf Lingenberg: Grundlagen der Geometrie, BI-Taschenbuch, 1969, p. 93. The dual of this incidence theorem states that given one set of concurrent lines A, B, C, and another set of concurrent lines a, b, c, then the lines x, y, z defined by pairs of points resulting from pairs of intersections A\\\\cap b and a\\\\cap B, \\\\; A\\\\cap c and a\\\\cap C, \\\\;B\\\\cap c and b\\\\cap C are concurrent. (Concurrent means that the lines pass through one point.) Pappus's theorem is a special case of Pascal's theorem for a conic‚Äîthe limiting case when the conic degenerates into 2 straight lines. Pascal's theorem is in turn a special case of the Cayley‚ÄìBacharach theorem. The Pappus configuration is the configuration of 9 lines and 9 points that occurs in Pappus's theorem, with each line meeting 3 of the points and each point meeting 3 lines. In general, the Pappus line does not pass through the point of intersection of ABC and abc.However, this does occur when ABC and abc are in perspective, that is, Aa, Bb and Cc are concurrent. This configuration is self dual. Since, in particular, the lines Bc, bC, XY have the properties of the lines x,y,z of the dual theorem, and collinearity of X,Y,Z is equivalent to concurrence of Bc, bC, XY, the dual theorem is therefore just the same as the theorem itself. The Levi graph of the Pappus configuration is the Pappus graph, a bipartite distance-regular graph with 18 vertices and 27 edges.  Proof: affine form  Pappus theorem: proof If the affine form of the statement can be proven, then the projective form of Pappus's theorem is proven, as the extension of a pappian plane to a projective plane is unique. Because of the parallelity in an affine plane one has to distinct two cases: g ot\\\\parallel h and g \\\\parallel h. The key for a simple proof is the possibility for introducing a \\"suitable\\" coordinate system: Case 1: The lines g,h intersect at point S=g\\\\cap h. In this case coordinates are introduced, such that \\\\;S=(0,0), \\\\; A=(0,1), \\\\;c=(1,0)\\\\; (see diagram). B,C have the coordinates \\\\;B=(0,\\\\gamma),\\\\; C=(0,\\\\delta), \\\\; \\\\gamma,\\\\delta otin {0,1}. From the parallelity of the lines Bc,\\\\; Cb one gets b=(\\\\tfrac{\\\\delta}{\\\\gamma},0) and the parallelity of the lines Ab, Ba yields a=(\\\\delta,0). Hence line Ca has slope -1 and is parallel line Ac. Case 2: g\\\\parallel h \\\\ (little theorem). In this case the coordinates are chosen such that \\\\;c=(0,0), \\\\;b=(1,0),\\\\; A=(0,1), \\\\;B=(\\\\gamma,1),\\\\;\\\\gamma e 0. From the parallelity of Ab\\\\parallel Ba and cB\\\\parallel bC one gets \\\\;C=(\\\\gamma+1,1)\\\\; and \\\\;a=(\\\\gamma+1,0)\\\\;, respectively, and at least the parallelity \\\\;Ac\\\\parallel Ca\\\\;.  Proof with homogeneous coordinates  Choose homogeneous coordinates with :C = (1, 0, 0), \\\\; c= (0, 1, 0),\\\\; X = (0, 0, 1), \\\\; A = (1, 1, 1). On the lines AC, Ac, AX, given by x_2 = x_3,\\\\; x_1 =x_3, \\\\; x_2 = x_1, take the points B, Y, b to be :B = (p, 1, 1),\\\\; Y = (1, q, 1),\\\\; b = (1, 1, r) for some p, q, r. The three lines XB, CY, cb are x_1 = x_2 p,\\\\; x_2= x_3 q,\\\\; x_3 = x_1 r, so they pass through the same point a if and only if rqp = 1. The condition for the three lines Cb, cB and XY with equations x_2 = x_1 q,\\\\; x_1 = x_3 p ,\\\\; x_3 = x_2 r to pass through the same point Z is rpq =1. So this last set of three lines is concurrent if all the other eight sets are because multiplication is commutative, so pq = qp. Equivalently, X, Y, Z are collinear. The proof above also shows that for Pappus's theorem to hold for a projective space over a division ring it is both sufficient and necessary that the division ring is a (commutative) field. German mathematician Gerhard Hessenberg proved that Pappus's theorem implies Desargues's theorem.According to , Hessenberg's original proof is not complete; he disregarded the possibility that some additional incidences could occur in the Desargues configuration. A complete proof is provided by . In general, Pappus's theorem holds for some projective plane if and only if it is a projective plane over a commutative field. The projective planes in which Pappus's theorem does not hold are Desarguesian projective planes over noncommutative division rings, and non-Desarguesian planes. The proof is invalid if C, c, X happen to be collinear. In that case an alternative proof can be provided, for example, using a different projective reference.  Dual theorem  Because of the principle of duality for projective planes the dual theorem of Pappus is true: If 6 lines A,b,C,a,B,c are chosen alternately from two pencils with centers G,H, the lines : X:= (A\\\\cap b) (a\\\\cap B), : Y:= (c\\\\cap A) (C\\\\cap a), : Z:= (b\\\\cap C) (B\\\\cap c) are concurrent, that means: they have a point U in common. The left diagram shows the projective version, the right one an affine version, where the points G,H are points at infinity. If point U is on the line GH than one gets the \\"dual little theorem\\" of Pappus' theorem. Pappus- dual-proj-ev.svgdual theorem: projective form Pappus-dual-aff-ev.svgdual theorem: affine form If in the affine version of the dual \\"little theorem\\" point U is a point at infinity too, one gets Thomsen's theorem, a statement on 6 points on the sides of a triangle (see diagram). The Thomsen figure plays an essential role coordinatising an axiomatic defined projective plane W. Blaschke: Projektive Geometrie, Springer-Verlag, 2013, , S. 190. The proof of the closure of Thomsen's figure is covered by the proof for the \\"little theorem\\", given above. But there exists a simple direct proof, too: Because the statement of Thomsen's theorem (the closure of the figure) uses only the terms connect, intersect and parallel, the statement is affinely invariant, and one can introduce coordinates such that P=(0,0), \\\\; Q=(1,0), \\\\; R=(0,1) (see right diagram). The starting point of the sequence of chords is (0,\\\\lambda). One easily verifies the coordinates of the points given in the diagram, which shows: the last point coincides with the first point. Thomsen- kl-d-pap-ev.svgThomsen figure (points \\\\color{red} 1,2,3,4,5,6 of the triangle PQR) as dual theorem of the little theorem of Pappus (U is at infinity, too !). Thomsen-beweis.svgThomsen figure: proof Other statements of the theorem Triangles XcC and BbY are perspective from A and a, and so, also from Z. In addition to the above characterizations of Pappus's theorem and its dual, the following are equivalent statements: * If the six vertices of a hexagon lie alternately on two lines, then the three points of intersection of pairs of opposite sides are collinear.Coxeter, p. 231 * Arranged in a matrix of nine points (as in the figure and description above) and thought of as evaluating a permanent, if the first two rows and the six \\"diagonal\\" triads are collinear, then the third row is collinear. ::\\\\left\\\\begin{matrix} A & B & C \\\\ a & b & c \\\\ X & Y & Z \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right :That is, if \\\\ ABC, abc, AbZ, BcX, CaY, XbC, YcA, ZaB\\\\ are lines, then Pappus's theorem states that XYZ must be a line. Also, note that the same matrix formulation applies to the dual form of the theorem when (A,B,C) etc. are triples of concurrent lines.Coxeter, p. 233 * Given three distinct points on each of two distinct lines, pair each point on one of the lines with one from the other line, then the joins of points not paired will meet in (opposite) pairs at points along a line.Whicher, chapter 14 * If two triangles are perspective in at least two different ways, then they are perspective in three ways. * If \\\\; AB, CD,\\\\; and EF are concurrent and DE, FA, and BC are concurrent, then AD, BE, and CF are concurrent. Origins In its earliest known form, Pappus's Theorem is Propositions 138, 139, 141, and 143 of Book VII of Pappus's Collection.Heath (Vol. II, p. 421) cites these propositions. The latter two can be understood as converses of the former two. Kline (p. 128) cites only Proposition 139. The numbering of the propositions is as assigned by Hultsch. These are Lemmas XII, XIII, XV, and XVII in the part of Book VII consisting of lemmas to the first of the three books of Euclid's Porisms. The lemmas are proved in terms of what today is known as the cross ratio of four collinear points. Three earlier lemmas are used. The first of these, Lemma III, has the diagram below (which uses Pappus's lettering, with G for Œì, D for Œî, J for Œò, and L for Œõ). :Pappus-collection-7-129 Here three concurrent straight lines, AB, AG, and AD, are crossed by two lines, JB and JE, which concur at J. Also KL is drawn parallel to AZ. Then :KJ : JL :: (KJ : AG & AG : JL) :: (JD : GD & BG : JB). These proportions might be written today as equations:A reason for using the notation above is that, for the ancient Greeks, a ratio is not a number or a geometrical object. We may think of ratio today as an equivalence class of pairs of geometrical objects. Also, equality for the Greeks is what we might today call congruence. In particular, distinct line segments may be equal. Ratios are not equal in this sense; but they may be the same. :KJ/JL = (KJ/AG)(AG/JL) = (JD/GD)(BG/JB). The last compound ratio (namely JD : GD & BG : JB) is what is known today as the cross ratio of the collinear points J, G, D, and B in that order; it is denoted today by (J, G; D, B). So we have shown that this is independent of the choice of the particular straight line JD that crosses the three straight lines that concur at A. In particular :(J, G; D, B) = (J, Z; H, E). It does not matter on which side of A the straight line JE falls. In particular, the situation may be as in the next diagram, which is the diagram for Lemma X. :Pappus- collection-7-136 Just as before, we have (J, G; D, B) = (J, Z; H, E). Pappus does not explicitly prove this; but Lemma X is a converse, namely that if these two cross ratios are the same, and the straight lines BE and DH cross at A, then the points G, A, and Z must be collinear. What we showed originally can be written as (J, ‚àû; K, L) = (J, G; D, B), with ‚àû taking the place of the (nonexistent) intersection of JK and AG. Pappus shows this, in effect, in Lemma XI, whose diagram, however, has different lettering: :Pappus- collection-7-137 What Pappus shows is DE.ZH : EZ.HD :: GB : BE, which we may write as :(D, Z; E, H) = (‚àû, B; E, G). The diagram for Lemma XII is: :Pappus- collection-7-138 The diagram for Lemma XIII is the same, but BA and DG, extended, meet at N. In any case, considering straight lines through G as cut by the three straight lines through A, (and accepting that equations of cross ratios remain valid after permutation of the entries,) we have by Lemma III or XI :(G, J; E, H) = (G, D; ‚àû Z). Considering straight lines through D as cut by the three straight lines through B, we have :(L, D; E, K) = (G, D; ‚àû Z). Thus (E, H; J, G) = (E, K; D, L), so by Lemma X, the points H, M, and K are collinear. That is, the points of intersection of the pairs of opposite sides of the hexagon ADEGBZ are collinear. Lemmas XV and XVII are that, if the point M is determined as the intersection of HK and BG, then the points A, M, and D are collinear. That is, the points of intersection of the pairs of opposite sides of the hexagon BEKHZG are collinear.

Tuzgle is a prominent volcano of the back-arc of the Andes and lies about east of the main volcanic arc. Part of the Central Volcanic Zone of the Andes, it is high above sea level and was constructed during different stages over a caldera and lava domes. Some major lava flows emanate from the summit crater, and one confirmed and one possible flank collapse unit as well as an ignimbrite sheet are associated with this volcano. The first volcanic activity of Tuzgle occurred 650,000 years ago and formed the Tuzgle Ignimbrite. Subsequently, lava domes were erupted and three lava flow units were named San Antonio, Azufre, and Tuzgle. The latest lava flows are dated at 17.5 and 1.5 Ma and volcanic activity may have continued into the Holocene. Several thermal springs are associated with the volcano, and some have been investigated for possible geothermal energy production. Sulfur was formerly mined on the mountain. Argentina's National Route 40 runs along the foot of the volcano.  Geology and geography = Regional setting  Volcanic activity as well as general tectonism in the Central Andes is caused by the subduction of the Nazca plate beneath the South American plate at a horizontal pace of or forming the Central Volcanic Zone (CVZ) between latitude 16 and 28¬∞ south. Starting with activity in the Coastal Cordillera during the Jurassic (La Negra formation), this has caused spatially complex patterns of volcanic activity as well as the formation of the Altiplano-Puna highland with dimensions of . Maximum deformation occurred during the late Miocene, with the formation of tectonic highs and lows. Small andesitic- basaltic volcanic centres of Quaternary age are associated with faulting. Seismic activity is still ongoing at the edge of the Puna, indicating thrusting. The crust beneath the CVZ is thick. A steepening of the subduction zone during the Late Miocene has been linked to an increase in volcanic activity and its westward migration, but it is unlikely that the pattern of activity in the southern Puna next to the Toro fault zone can be explained through this alone. A large low velocity and low seismic attenuation anomaly is found between 20 and 24¬∞ latitude south. Some geologic evidence, including geochemistry and geographic indicators, imply that lithospheric detachment did occur beneath the southern Puna. Several major fault zones run across the Puna in the area, the most important being the Toro lineament to the south of Tuzgle. On this lineament, which has been subject to left-lateral displacement, are aligned several Pleistocene volcanoes, including Cordon Puntas Negras, Rincon, Tul Tul-Del Medio-Pocitos, Quevar, and Tastil (from north to south) (as well as the Negra Muerta volcanic complex). A segment named the Chorrillos fault is located directly south of Tuzgle. The segment of the Toro fault closest to Tuzgle has been active recently. Based on displacements along two monogenetic volcanoes, slip rates of have been estimated. The shoshonitic San Geronimo and Negro de Chorillos scoria cones and lava flows, as well as Antuco hot springs and travertine deposits (), are also linked to the Toro fault zone and thermal waters flowing along it. Volcanic activity in the area occurred during two separate phases, the first one between 17.15 mya and 5.3 mya that generated a large number of volcanic centres, with a much more limited phase of activity since 1.5 mya associated with the Diaguita phase of Andean deformation.  Local setting  Southeast face of Cerro Tuzgle with a conspicuous black latitic lava flow Tuzgle is a dormant stratovolcano in the Susques Department of Jujuy Province in Argentina. It is a prominent back-arc volcanic centre in the Andes located about east of the main volcanic arc. Cerro Tuzgle lies within a geological depression in the Puna bordered by normal faults. The depression dates back to the Ordovician and slopes northward from altitude on the southern side to altitude on the northern side. A low gravity field anomaly is also found in the area. The basement consists of fractured rocks of Precambrian-Ordovician age, known as the Puncoviscana Formation and Faja Eruptiva, respectively, overlain with an impermeable Cretaceous unit named the Pirgua Formation. Volcanism in the area has existed since the Miocene, involving lava domes, ignimbrite eruptions (the 0.6mya Tuzgle ignimbrite) and monogenetic volcanism. Volcanoes located south of Tuzgle are Aguas Calientes, Negro de Chorrillos and San Jeronimo. This region belongs to the back-arc region of the Andes, and the formation of melts is dependent on the melting of a heated mantle, whereas melt generation under the arc proper is dependent on the interaction between fluids and mantle rocks, leading to a reduction in their melting point. There is tomographic evidence that lithospheric delamination is currently underway beneath Tuzgle. The highest unit of the Cerro Tuzgle volcano is the \\"Platform\\" unit, which covers a surface area of and is capped off by a well-preserved summit crater. It consists of well-preserved blocky lava flows with maximum thicknesses of . These are the youngest stages of Tuzgle volcanism and are well preserved. Radiating away from the central summit of the volcano, another lava flow unit forms the so-called Azufre synthem; these lava flows reach maximum thicknesses of and are gray to brownish-red with some evidence of hydrothermal alteration. On the northwestern and southern flanks, lava emission from one emission area down steep slopes form the San Antonio synthem (unconformity bounded unit), with lava flows up to thick. These San Antonio stage lavas have been cut by a long fault scarp trending NNE-SSW that may have been formed by a mass failure of the Tuzgle edifice, which was then rebuilt by the Azufre stage lavas. On the northern flank is found a volcaniclastic fan with a surface area of , a volume of and thicknesses of , presumably, considering its geochemical composition, formed by a mass failure of the San Antonio stage edifice. The scarp was probably formed by the same event but was not accompanied by explosive activity or a pyroclastic flow. This flank collapse may have been triggered by magma injection. A structure on the southern side of the volcano may also be a collapse scar, but no deposit is identifiable. A weakness zone running east-west cuts across the Tuzgle edifice, and some volcanic features are aligned along this weakness. A wide feeder dyke has been modelled and is associated with this weakness zone. The youngest- and best-exposed lava flow of Cerro Tuzgle originated in a group of three depressions bordered by scoria ridges. These depressions, presumably eruption fissures, are arranged in en echelon order. This youngest lava flow has a structure between block lava and aa lava. In non-volcanic terms patterned ground is found resulting from pre-glacial processes. Tuzgle from National Route 40 Tuzgle is underpinned by a plateau formed by mostly unwelded ignimbrites, while the so-called \\"Pre-platform\\", \\"Platform\\", \\"Post-platform\\" and \\"Young Flow\\" units make up the central volcano. The moderately crystal- rich ignimbrite has a volume of and is thick, and was presumably emitted from a caldera now buried by the Cerro Tuzgle edifice. Circular lava domes ( thick at a maximum) are found in the southeastern, eastern and northern sector of the volcano and may have formed along ring dykes associated with the caldera. A high electrical conductivity zone beneath Tuzgle may constitute a magma chamber embedded within porous material containing saline fluids with the bottom at a depth of at least and the top at a depth of . Crustal silicic magmas gave rise to ignimbrites from depths of . The magma chamber appears to be placed next to a crustal decollement at . Thermobarometric data also indicate a magma origin depth of . Beneath Tuzgle, a high seismic attenuation plume rises from an earthquake cluster at depth up to the volcano and is probably linked to asthenospheric upwelling. In the ground beneath Tuzgle, seismic tomography has found a thick layer of low velocity, probably linked to a lower density of the rock, at a depth of . Magnetotelluric analysis has found several deep () conductive layers and one shallow one, possibly formed by the aquifers in the area. Another high conductivity body southeast of Tuzgle is associated with the Toro lineament and the Queva volcano and may also be hydrothermal in origin.  Composition and origin  The Tuzgle volcano proper is constructed from an older rhyodacite-mafic series and a more recent series constructed from andesites alone. These and neighbouring shoshonitic centres are formed from magmas with crustal contamination. Isotope analysis of magmatic rocks have shown La/Nb ratios of 1.31.6 and Ba/Ta ratios of 160260, lower than in the main volcanic front. The overall chemical composition is potassium-rich calc-alkaline. Thermobarometry indicates that the older magmas crystallized at pressures of while younger ones crystallized at and temperatures of about . These magma compositions indicate that the magmas are the result of complex mixing processes and also involve the transitional nature of the mantle beneath Tuzgle, where the more northern steep slab encounters the shallower southern subducting slab. Crystal fractionation and melting of upper crustal rocks further complicate the pattern. The lava domes which were erupted from the ground after the Tuzgle ignimbrite have volumes of , while the Platform and subsequent units have volumes of . The lava domes and San Antonio lava flows have porphyritic surfaces. San Antonio lavas contain large plagioclase xenocrystals and xenoliths. The ignimbrite contains Ordovician lithic fragments and 1020% pumice. Its eruption was presumably linked to high mantle melt rates; the resulting mafic magmas induced the generation of large amounts of silicic melts. Lower mantle melt rates would form mafic melts that incorporate silicic melts before erupting.  Activity  The oldest activity is an ignimbrite erupted 0.65 ¬± 0.18 mya, called the Tuzgle ignimbrite. On the rim of the caldera left by this eruption is a lava dome complex named the Old Complex Unit. 0.3 ¬± 0.1 mya ago effusive activity commenced with the Pre-platform and Platform units that were then followed by a tectonic event that dissected these units. Afterwards, the Post-platform and Young Flow Units were erupted. The youngest unit is latitic and was dated 0.1 ¬± (0.1-0.3) mya ago. This unit may be Holocene or PleistoceneHolocene in age. It is possible that the continuing activity of the Chorrillos fault zone is compressing the magma chamber and feeder dyke of Tuzgle, thus impeding eruptive activity. The well- preserved summit crater and youthful-looking lava flows have been assigned Holocene ages.  Geothermal area and sulfur  The area around Cerro Tuzgle has a high geothermal gradient of , and geothermal studies indicate temperatures of over at depth. Hot springs (with temperatures around ) are also found in the area. The Miocene ignimbritic Trinchera formation may be a geothermal reservoir and the later MiocenePliocene sedimentary Pastos Chicos Formation a seal above it. This geothermal reservoir is deep beneath the earth and thick. A deeper reservoir is also presumed to exist at a depth of . Selected hot springs include TuzgleAgua Caliente (, ), Las Minas () Pompeya (), Mina Betty () and Tocomar (). The water enters the geothermal system in ridges above altitude which are not covered by impermeable layers. Two maars have been found in the Tocomar area. Further, the Antuco travertine and hot springs may be associated with heat flow from the Tuzgle volcanic system. Ancient sulfur mine on Tuzgle The Tuzgle area has been identified as a possible site for geothermal energy production in Argentina with an energy potential of <. These were explored in the 1980s and 1990s, yielding evidence of temperatures . In 2015 a company named Geotermina Andina had six concessions in the area for geothermal drilling. The location of a main power line between Chile and Argentina close to Tuzgle may assist in power generation, and some hot springs could be exploited for tourism. Sulfur deposits generated from hydrothermal alteration are found on Cerro Tuzgle. They are mostly associated with the Azufre synthem and were previously mined on the southern, eastern and western flanks of the volcano. The mines are now abandoned. Arsenic is also found in the groundwater and presumably comes from Tuzgle.  Climate and vegetation  The climate of the Puna is arid, with most precipitation originating in the Amazon basin. During the Last Glacial Maximum, a humid period occurred (possibly directed by orbital changes and monsoon activity), whereas preceding glacial periods were associated with dry phases in travertine deposits at Antuco. Temperatures are usually less than in the Puna with extremes of . Winds usually blow from the west in the dry winter season, with wetter easterly winds arriving during summer. Precipitation in San Antonio de los Cobres () southeast of Tuzgle amounts to . Vegetation is largely missing from the Puna plateau in the area of Tuzgle, which has facilitated the mapping of lava flows from Cerro Tuzgle. A steppe-like vegetation dominated by herbs grows on the slopes of Tuzgle, containing taxa like Festuca, Poa and Stipa as elsewhere on the Puna.

He was Professor of Poetry at the University of Oxford (1984‚Äì1989). Early life and education Levi was born in Ruislip, Middlesex. The family of his father (Herbert Simon Levi) came from Istanbul and that of his mother (Edith Mary Tigar) was English. His mother was a devout Roman Catholic and his Jewish father converted to that religion; their three children all entered religious orders. He was educated in private Catholic establishments starting at Prior Park near Bath, run by the Christian Brothers. When he was 14, Oscar Wilde had become his literary idol. Wilde had said that the Greek text of the Gospels was the most beautiful book in the world,Levi, Peter. (1980) The Hill of Kronos. so a school with more Greek was demanded and he changed schools to Beaumont College, a Jesuit school in Old Windsor, Berkshire. While at Beaumont, at the age of 17 he joined the Society of Jesus as a novice. He was to remain a Jesuit until he resigned the priesthood 29 years later in 1977. Levi trained for the priesthood at Heythrop College and read Classics at Campion Hall. During his teenage years he suffered from polio and as an undergraduate was knocked down by a car ‚Äì the after-effects of these were to affect him throughout his life. While at Heythrop, then a country house near Chipping Norton in Oxfordshire, he was not the most ruly of seminarians. This and possible doubts about his vocation led to his ordination being delayed for a year: :\\"We used to translate psalm [119] Beati immaculati in via at Heythrop as Blessed are those who are not spotted on the way out. I was spotted too often....\\" This delay had the side effect of enabling his first visit to Greece in 1963. He travelled through Afghanistan with Bruce Chatwin in 1970, looking for traces of Greek culture. After the priesthood He left the priesthood in 1977. He subsequently married Deirdre Craig (granddaughter of Lord Craigavon), widow of Cyril Connolly. He spent a year as archaeological correspondent for The Times before returning to academic life. In 1984, he was elected Oxford Professor of Poetry, an appointment requiring only a minimal number of public lectures. In 1988, he claimed to have found a previously unknown poem by William Shakespeare in a manuscript at the Huntington Library in San Marino, California. However, the claim has not been accepted by most scholars. Works Most of this data retrieved from British Library catalogue July 2006. Poetry * 1960: The Gravel Ponds.

He specialized in the study of the nervous and optic systems. Biography Alfred Wilhelm Volkmann was born in Leipzig, and enrolled in medicine there in 1821. Together with Gustav Theodor Fechner, who got his degree in medicine in 1822, and Rudolph Hermann Lotze (1817‚Äì1881) they formed a small intellectual group which dissolved only in 1837 when Volkmann received his professorship in Dorpat. In 1826 he obtained his doctorate and in 1828 he was habilitated as Privatdozent at the University of Leipzig. It was there that he became professor extraordinary of zootomy in 1834. In 1837 he went to Dorpat (now Tartu) as professor of physiology, pathology and semiotics. However, his residence in Dorpat was short: he left for Halle as early as 1843. After moving to Halle, Volkmann helped Gustav Theodor Fechner, his brother-in-law (married to Volkmann‚Äôs sister Clara Fechner), with many experiments that formed the foundation of the epochal Elemente der Psychophysik. (his daughter Anna Ansch√ºtz was later experimental subject for Fechner). In 1854 Volkmann additionally took on the teaching of anatomy, until 1872, when physiology was branched off and given to Julius Bernstein. Volkmann‚Äôs house in Halle was a center of the city‚Äôs social life. Among his friends were the painters Wilhelm von K√ºgelgen, Friedrich Preller and Ludwig Richter, as well as the musicians Robert Franz, and Clara and Robert Schumann. In 1872, after his fiftieth doctoral jubilee he retired completely from his university activities. He died in Halle. Research Today, Volkmann is most remembered for his additions to the physiology of the nervous system and physiological optics. In 1842 he demonstrated that sympathetic nerves were largely made up of medullated fibres arising from sympathetic and spinal ganglia. However, he also delineated and identified numerous features of gross anatomy, including Volkmann's canals. Probably equally important, however, are his contributions to psychophysics and perception research. Fechner developed his classical psychophysical Method of average error (already in use in astronomy) in co-operation with Volkmann. In his 1864 treatise, Volkmann studied Weber‚Äôs law and reported that the threshold for distance discrimination increases with the increase of the reference distance. This was one of the first demonstrations of Weber‚Äôs law in the visual domain. Volkmann‚Äôs extensive experimental data in that book was the main basis on which Ewald Hering developed his theory of hyperacuity in 1899. Philosophically, Volkmann was an evangelical who opposed materialism and gave a number of speeches against the materialist assumption of identity between the body and mind.

Additionally, Feinberg served as the government-appointed administrator of the BP Deepwater Horizon Disaster Victim Compensation Fund. Feinberg was appointed by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to administer the One Fund‚Äîthe victim assistance fund established in the wake of the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings. Feinberg was also retained by General Motors to assist in their recall response and by Volkswagen to oversee their U.S. compensation of VW diesel owners affected by the Volkswagen emissions scandal. Feinberg was hired by The Boeing Company in July, 2019, to oversee distribution of $50 million to support 737 MAX crash victim families. Feinberg is also an adjunct professor at the Columbia University School of Law, University of Pennsylvania Law School, Georgetown University Law Center, New York University School of Law, the University of Virginia School of Law and at the Benjamin N.

The actions taken should be uniform in their approach. #There would be \\"no substitute for hard work and legal craftsmanship\\" of rigorous intellectual honesty. #The support of Senator Edward Kennedy would be recognized throughout the process. #Lawsuits were to be discouraged as contrary to the spirit of the law establishing the compensation fund.Feinberg, Kenneth. What is Life Worth?: The Unprecedented Effort to Compensate the Victims of 9/11 (2005), Perseus Books Group. =History of participation= Early in the process he was described as aloof and arrogant. Feinberg was subjected to some very public criticism at meetings, in the media and on Web sites. \\"I underestimated the emotion of this at the beginning\\", Feinberg has said. \\"I didn't fully appreciate how soon this program had been established after 9/11, so there was a certain degree of unanticipated anger directed at me that I should have been more attuned to.\\" It was up to Feinberg to make the decisions on how much each family of a 9/11 victim would receive. Feinberg had to estimate how much each victim would have earned in a full lifetime. If a family accepted the offer, it was not possible to appeal. Families unhappy with the offer were able to appeal in a nonadversarial, informal hearing to present their case however they wanted. Feinberg personally presided over more than 900 of the 1,600 hearings. At the end of the process, $7 billion was awarded to 97 percent of the families. \\"It's a brutal, sort of cold, thing to do. Anybody who looks at this program and expects that by cutting a U.S. Treasury check, you are going to make 9/11 families happy, is vastly misunderstanding what's going on with this program,\\" said Feinberg. \\"There is not one family member I've met who wouldn't gladly give back the check, or, in many cases, their own lives to have that loved one back. 'Happy' never enters into this equation.\\" Feinberg was able to change the mind of some of his harshest critics. Charles Wolf, whose wife died in the north tower, renamed his highly critical Web site called \\"Fix the Fund\\" to \\"The Fund is Fixed!\\". At first he called Feinberg \\"patronizing, manipulative and at times, even cruel.\\" He later remarked, \\"To have one of your sharpest critics follow through on a promise and not only join the program he was criticizing, but promote it to his peers, says a lot about you and the way you have adjusted both the program and your attitude...Today, I have complete faith in you.\\" In 2005 his book, titled What is Life Worth?: The Unprecedented Effort to Compensate the Victims of 9/11 was published. Feinberg wrote that a widow of one firefighter cursed him \\"I spit on you, and your children.\\" for being unfair in his compensation awards.Feinberg, Kenneth. What is Life Worth?: The Unprecedented Effort to Compensate the Victims of 9/11 (2005), Perseus Books Group, p 56. Hokie Spirit Memorial Fund On July 5, 2007, a Virginia Tech press release said that Feinberg would work pro bono as the chief administrator to the Hokie Spirit Memorial Fund (HSMF). The HSMF was set up by the Virginia Tech Foundation in the aftermath of the April 16, 2007, shooting attacks on the Virginia Tech campus. Special Master for Executive Compensation On June 10, 2009, Feinberg was appointed by the U.S. Treasury Department to oversee the compensation of top executives at companies which have received federal bailout assistance. As part of his policies, he has suggested to many bank executives that they emphasize long-term stock compensation rather than cash payments. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, in a statement about Feinberg's rulings on executive pay, said, \\"We all share an interest in seeing these companies return taxpayer dollars as soon as possible, and Ken today has helped bring that day a little bit closer.\\"Reuters, Oct. 22, 2009 BP oil spill fund On June 16, 2010, it was reported that Feinberg was to run a $20 billion fund to pay claims for the BP oil spill.https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20100616/ap_on_bi_ge/us_gulf_oil_spill President Obama said that the $20 billion from BP \\"will not be controlled by either BP or by the government. It will be put in an escrow account administered by an impartial, independent third party.\\" Obama said he and BP's chairman, Carl-Henric Svanberg, agreed on having Feinberg administer the fund. Feinberg was also selected by Obama to oversee the compensation of top executives at bailed out banks. BP is agreed to pay Feinberg's six-lawyer Washington, D.C., firm, Feinberg Rozen, a flat fee of $1,250,000 a month for labor and overhead costs, but the full details of compensation are unknown.Pressure on Kenneth Feinberg to disclose BP pay deal, Reuters: http://in.reuters.com/article/idINIndia-53083520101122 Feinberg has come under harsh criticism from public interest groups for refusing to disclose the amount of his compensation or the details of his arrangement with the company. On December 6, 2010, the Center for Justice & Democracy (CJ&D;) sent a letter to Robert Dudley, the CEO of BP, concerning \\"serious new issues raised about the lack of transparency and potential conflicts of interest related to the administration of the Gulf Coast Claims Facility.\\" In the letter, CJ&D; pointed out actions taken by Feinberg in the administration of the compensation fund that point to serious conflicts of interest: > Mr. Feinberg, employed by BP, has decided on his own authority that all > claims recipients must release all companies who caused this disaster from > any and all legal responsibility, no matter how grossly negligent they were. > This sweeping release, which assigns victims' claims to BP, benefits only > one actor: BP ‚Äì the company that happens to pay Mr. Feinberg's salary. In January 2011, Judge Barbier, the federal judge over the oil spill litigation, after hearing evidence and arguments of the attorneys, ruled that Kenneth Feinberg was not independent of BP and could no longer claim to be so. Feinberg had been telling victims he was their lawyer and did not answer to BP. The letter also criticized Feinberg's lack of transparency in the matter of compensation: > Despite repeated calls for the release of documents establishing the formal > relationship between BP and Feinberg Rozen, as well as its subcontractors > who are reviewing and adjudicating claims, almost nothing has been publicly > released. And now we learn, as reported by Reuters on November 22, 2010, > that BP and Feinberg Rozen consider their arrangement 'verbal,' i.e., they > have not committed to writing the firm's compensation arrangement so there > can be no public examination of it. Is the public to believe that there is > no paper evidence at all documenting a $10 million per year financial > arrangement between BP and Feinberg Rozen? What about the contracts between > BP, Feinberg Rozen and the subcontractors who are advising and adjudicating > claims and also being paid directly by BP? Surely these contracts must be in > writing and released. This failure to release the terms of all these > financial arrangements under circumstances of tremendous historic and public > significance is simply unacceptable. Penn State settlement On September 12, 2012, Feinberg was hired by Penn State University to aid in the settlement of dozens of personal injury claims against the institution stemming from the sex abuse scandal involving Jerry Sandusky. Four months later, Feinberg said that he expected settlement discussions with 28 people to yield results within a matter of weeks. Aurora victim relief fund Feinberg oversaw the disbursement of donations to the injured victims and families of the deceased in the Aurora, Colorado, movie theater shooting that left 12 people dead and 70 others wounded. The Newtown-Sandy Hook Community Foundation In June 2013, Newtown-Sandy Hook Community Foundation was given permission from the Connecticut Attorney General to distribute $7.7 million from the fund. A committee of three, headed by a retired U.S. District Court judge, was being advised by Kenneth Feinberg. General Motors car recall On April 1, 2014, General Motors announced it had retained Feinberg to handle part of its response to a widely reported product safety recall. GM said Feinberg would serve as a consultant \\"to explore and evaluate options in its response to families of accident victims whose vehicles are being recalled for possible ignition switch defects.\\" Special Master to Oversee Treasury Implementation of Multiemployer Pension Reform Act Regulations The U.S. Department of the Treasury released proposed and temporary regulations to implement the Kline-Miller Multiemployer Pension Reform Act of 2014, as required by Congress. In Kline-Miller, Congress established a new process for multiemployer pension plans to propose a temporary or permanent reduction of pension benefits if the plan is projected to run out of money. As part of Treasury's commitment to ensuring an open and fair process, Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew appointed Kenneth Feinberg as a Special Master to help provide a dedicated, impartial and informed review of applications proposing to reduce pension benefits. Feinberg will oversee Treasury's implementation of Kline-Miller, including the review of applications to determine whether they meet the requirements set by Congress. He will also ensure that affected stakeholders have a single point of contact dedicated to this process. Volkswagen emission scandal In February 2016, it was announced that Feinberg would be heading up the compensation fund for Volkswagen. This fund will be established to compensate the roughly 600,000 U.S. owners of diesel vehicles whose emissions are over the legal limit.  Terrorism compensation fund In March 2016, the United States Department of Justice appointed Feinberg to oversee the Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism Fund. In re Foreign Exchange and Benchmark Rates Antitrust Litigation As a mediator, Kenneth Feinberg served as a mediator to help resolve price-fixing antitrust claims brought against a group of financial institutions. Working as the agreed-upon neutral, he helped secure comprehensive settlements in the billions of dollars, and thereafter helped to design and administer a compensation program to distribute settlement proceeds to eligible claimants. Archdiocese of New York Independent Reconciliation and Compensation Program In 2016, the Archdiocese of New York established the Independent Reconciliation and Compensation Program run by Kenneth Feinberg. This Independent Reconciliation and Compensation Program (the \\"IRCP\\") follows in the wake of initiatives already implemented by the Archdiocese of New York (the \\"Archdiocese\\") to address the problem of sexual abuse of minors alleged against clergy of the Archdiocese The IRCP is a new program designed to compensate eligible victims of abuse. During past years, the Archdiocese has received various individual complaints alleging sexual abuse by clergy of the Archdiocese. This Protocol outlines the eligibility criteria requirements and the process for these individuals to submit and resolve claims alleging such sexual abuse. This Protocol governs only those individual claims previously submitted to the Archdiocese and will be considered Phase I of a two-phase Program.  United Methodist Church  In 2019, Feinberg worked pro bono to mediate the impasse between representatives of factions within the United Methodist Church regarding its position on homosexuality. Consequently on January 3, 2020, the parties unanimously agreed to present a plan to the 2020 General Conference to spin off one or more traditionalist denominations and allow churches and denominations to leave or remain, while dividing church assets.

It was built in large numbers for both military and civil roles and used to be the largest helicopter in production until Mil Mi-26 was put in production in 1980. Design and development The Mi-6 resulted from a joint civil-military requirement for a very large vertical-lift aircraft, which could be used to add mobility in military operations as well as assist in the exploration and development of the expansive central and eastern regions of the USSR. Flown for the first time on 5 June 1957, the Mi-6 was the first Soviet turboshaft- powered production helicopter. The R-7 gearbox and rotor head developed for the project have a combined weight of 3200 kg, which is greater than the two turboshaft engines. Variable-incidence winglets were first mounted on the craft's sides in 1960 to the 30 pre-series units. These wings provide approximately 20% of the lift required during cruise flight. The Mi-6 was by far the world's largest helicopter when it was designed in 1954‚Äì56; with a maximum load capacity of 12,000 kg. It was also the world's fastest helicopter; with a top speed of . In its early days, the Mi-6 set many world records, including one for sheer circuit speed at 340 km/h (211 mph). , the Mi-6 still holds the FAI record of fastest 5-tonne lift over 1,000 km, in which it flew 284 km/h in 1962.\\"FAI Record ID #9999 - Helicopters, Speed over a closed circuit of 1,000 km with 5,000 kg payload \\" F√©d√©ration A√©ronautique Internationale Record date 11 September 1962. Accessed: 29 November 2013. From 1959 to 1972 at least 500 units were built for various general-transport, utility, firefighting and flying-crane duties, the last two sub-types not being fitted with the large fixed wings, which in other versions bear part of the lift in cruising flight and thus enable higher speeds to be attained. The twin nose wheels and large low-pressure main wheels do not retract. Normally flown by a crew of five or more, the Mi-6 seats 65 armed troops and can alternatively carry 41 stretcher (litter) patients and two attendants, or a wide range of bulky loads, including vehicles, loaded through rear clamshell doors. In exercises, fleets of these aircraft have airlifted many kinds of weapons, including FROG-7 rockets on their PT-76 tracked chassis, as well as large radars and heavy artillery. All Soviet armoured personnel carriers, armoured cars and light mechanised infantry combat vehicles can be carried. The CIS Interstate Aviation Committee cancelled the Mi-6's Type Certificate in October 2002 after the crash of RA-21074 in the Taimyr Peninsula. There have also been reports that the wooden tail rotor blades have reached the end of their service life. Variants A Mil Mi-6.

Biography  Krim was born in the village of A√Øt Yahia Moussa (now in Tizi Ouzou Province) in the Berber-speaking Kabylie region of Algeria. During the Second World War, he joined the French Army, and was promoted corporal in the First Algerian Sharpshooter Regiment, reputedly becoming an excellent shot.Cheurfi, Achour, La Classe Politique Algerienne, Casbah Editions, Alger, 2006 - p 230 Demobilized on October 4, 1945, he returned to his home village, where he took up a bureaucratic post. Krim joined the underground Algerian People's Party at the beginning of 1946, setting up clandestine cells in 12 villages around Draa el-Mizan. Accused of the murder of a forest warden in 1947, he was hunted and he joined the maquis under the Pseudonym of Si Rabah with Moh Nachid, Mohand Talah and Messaoud Ben Arab. Twice sentenced to death by French tribunals in 1947 and 1950, he became the Kabylie responsible of the PPA-MTLD paramilitary organization founded in February 1947 by Messali Hadj, the Organisation Sp√©ciale, at the head of 22 members of the resistance (maquisards). During the Algerian War of Independence, Krim was chief of the FLN's 3rd Wilaya, Kabylie and its surrounding area. After his important role at the Soummam Congress‚Äîin which the FLN formalized its revolutionary program‚ÄîKrim became one of the most important and powerful of all the FLN chiefs.Cheurfi, Achour, La Classe Politique Algerienne, Casbah Editions, Alger, 2006 - p 231 Belkacem, who left Algeria after the Battle of Algiers, formed an alliance with Lakhdar Ben Tobbal and Abdelhafid Boussouf against Abane Ramdane. He was the first to be Minister of Defense, then Foreign Minister, in the provisional Government of the Algerian republic (GPRA) in 1958, and Vice President of Algeria. Later he was the principal Algerian negotiator of the agreements of √âvian in March 1962. Belkacem was in opposition to the creation of the Political Bureau of the FLN in July 1962 by Ahmed Ben Bella, Colonel Houari Boumedienne, and Mohamed Khider.  Political views and Assassination  After the June 19, 1965 takeover by the Political Bureau, he returned to opposition, favouring more federalist views than Boumedienne's centralist policies. Accused of having organized an assassination attempt against Boumedienne, he was sentenced to death in absentia. He was found assassinated in 1970 in a hotel room in Frankfurt, West Germany. Belkacem was posthumously rehabilitated by the Algerian state by being buried in the Martyrs Square at the El Alia Cemetery on October 24, 1984. Krim Belkacem Airport in Hassi Messaoud was named after him.

The fund had previously received only temporary funding. The September 11th Victim Compensation Fund (VCF) was created by an Act of Congress, the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act (49 USC 40101),Government statistics concerning 9-11 compensation program shortly after 9/11 to compensate the victims of the attack (or their families) in exchange for their agreement not to sue the airline corporations involved. Kenneth Feinberg was appointed by Attorney General John Ashcroft to be special master of the fund. He developed the regulations governing the administration of the fund and administered all aspects of the program. Legislation authorizes the fund to disburse a maximum of $7.375 billion, including operational and administrative costs, of U.S. government funds. In the United States Feinberg was responsible for making the decisions on how much each family of a victim would receive. Feinberg had to estimate how much each victim would have earned in a full lifetime. If a family accepted the offer, it was not possible to appeal. Families unhappy with the offer were able to appeal in a nonadversarial, informal hearing to present their case however they wanted. Feinberg personally presided over more than 900 of the 1,600 hearings. At the end of the process $7 billion was awarded to 97% of the families. A non-negotiable clause in the acceptance papers for the settlements was that the families were to never file suit against the airlines for any lack of security or otherwise unsafe procedures.Feinberg, Kenneth. What is Life Worth?: The Unprecedented Effort to Compensate the Victims of 9/11 (2005), Perseus Books Group. A stumbling block to settlements was the fact that many of the World Trade Center victims were highly compensated financial professionals. Families of these victims felt the compensation offers were too low, and, had a court considered their case on an individual basis, they would have been awarded much higher amounts. This concern had to be balanced against the time, complications, and risks of pursuing an individual case, and the real possibility that the airlines and their insurers could be bankrupted before being able to pay the claim. This is a separate fund from the similarly named September 11th Fund, and from the World Trade Center Captive Insurance Company. The 8-part Feinberg plan In his book titled What is Life Worth?, Feinberg described the eight-part plan which was applied to approaching the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund (see Publications section below). (i) Identifying someone with sufficient and exceptionally broad experience in mass tort action mediation, litigation, and settlement, which Feinberg possessed through his previous personal experience as a political activist and his work in the Agent Orange compensation settlement. (ii) To support and follow the unprecedented law of Congress for the proportional compensation of victims based on estimated loss from future earnings as a key legislated criterion. Hire a full staff of accountants and attorneys to track and service each claim individually. (iii) Accumulate all the reports and applications, along with counter-claims to gauge and initiate the direct compensation process. How the compensation fund worked was in detail substantially different than the Agent Orange mass tort litigation case. (iv) The place of informed discretion in compensating claimants under the formula of keeping the domain of compensation (p47 of Feinberg's book) under the rule of thumb that 85% of the money should not go to 15% of the 'richest' claimant families, under the principle of \\"narrow the gap\\" between the largest and the smallest compensations paid to claimants. (v) With a mind to the future, the process of the program should be maintained and serviced as a precedent for future courts to defend in future compensation cases as needed. The actions taken should be uniform in their approach. (vi) There would be \\"no substitute for hard work and legal craftsmanship\\" of rigorous intellectual honesty. (vii) The support of Edward Kennedy would be recognized throughout the process whom Feinberg knew since 1975 (p7-8). (viii) Lawsuits were to be discouraged as contrary to the spirit of an enacted Law of Congress legislated to expedite the claim process of victims of September 11th. Additional compensation In spite of the finding of the 9/11 Commission Report that the Saudi Arabian government wasn't involved in the attacks, some 9/11 families sued the Saudi Arabian government in 2016 seeking additional restitution. The lawsuit accuses the Saudis of wrongful death. See also *Financial assistance following the September 11 attacks  Publications  * * Feinberg, Kenneth.

Design and development The Mi-4 was designed in response to the American H-19 Chickasaw and the deployment of U.S. helicopters during the Korean War. While the Mi-4 strongly resembles the H-19 Chickasaw in general layout, including the innovative engine position in front of the cockpit, it is a larger helicopter, able to lift more weight and built in larger numbers. The first model entered service in 1953. The helicopter was first displayed to the outside world in 1952 at the Soviet Aviation Day in Tushino Airfield. One Mi-4 was built with a jettisonable rotor. It served as an experimental vehicle for future pilots' means of safety and ejection designs. Operational history The Mi-4 transport helicopter laid the beginning of the Soviet Army Aviation. It was widely used both in the armed forces and in Soviet civil aviation, and for several decades remained the main type of helicopter in the inventory of the Soviet Armed Forces and of the Civil Air Fleet. The Mi-4 went out of service with the development of the Mi-8. It is no longer used by the Russian Air Force, though it remained in service in some countries as a utility helicopter or as a military transport a while longer. Albania was thought to be the final country using the helicopter and by 2005 all were out of service. The Mi-4 played a very important role in the Bangladesh liberation war of 1971. The Mi-4 was the workhorse of the Indian Air Force covering the medium lift role at the time. A highly successful heli-borne operation, the Meghna Heli Bridge, using Mi-4s helped the Indian Army's 57 Mountain Division clear the Meghna River. The helilift of a battalion of Indian troops to the outskirts of Sylhet was the first heli- borne operation of the Indian army. Much like the UH-1 Huey, after it was gradually phased out of military service, it was used in various domestic roles: search and rescue, firefighting, polar expeditioning, construction site cargo helicopter, commercial flights and many others. An official video of a North Korean Air Force combat flying skills competition released in 2014 shows that the Mi-4 is still in limited service in North Korea.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0yNcM4kV6g Variants ;V-12 :Prototype.

The suburb overlooks Corio Bay. A small residential area is east of the North Shore railway station with a few neighbourhood shops. Midway Limited's Woodchipping Plant at North Shore The suburb is bounded by the Geelong to Melbourne railway line to the west, St Georges Road to the north, Corio Bay to the east, and Cowies Creek to the south. History In 1892 the North Shore area was subdivided as a residential area and bayside retreat. An esplanade and linear park were laid out and planted with trees, the remaining fragment now being Moorpanyal Park. A small jetty was constructed and 10 years later North Shore was a small holiday resort. The Post Office opened on 27 August 1898. It was known as Corio from 1908 until 1913, before reverting to North Shore. Some references say a railway station was first opened at North Shore on 15 April 1895, but an 1857 map shows a station named Cowie's Creek where the current station is sited, which by the 1880s was called North Shore. In 1909, the station was briefly renamed Corio, reverting to North Shore in 1913.Lara, Corio, North Shore Victorian Station Histories In the 1920s various other names, related to the industrial expansion in the area, were suggested for the station, including Jelbart, Pivot and Ford. In 1930, the Minister for Railways announced that the station's name would change to Pivot, but that never happened. Industrialisation in the North Shore area commenced in 1899, when a meat freezing works was opened. The mouth of Cowies Creek was excavated to become Corio Quay from 1909, with the creation of Lascelles Wharf to the north in later years. In 1925 the Ford factory and the Phosphate Co-Operative Company of Australia's \\"Pivot\\" phosphate works were opened, and in 1929 the Corio Distillery opened. International Harvester opened its plant near Ford in 1939. During the 1920s there were several land subdivisions in the North Shore area. One of them was \\"Fordtown\\", no doubt trying to cash in on the coming of the Ford works, and the name was well enough accepted to appear on a 1923 Army Survey map. A small residential area gradually developed between the International Harvester plant and the Pivot works. In the post-war years the Shell Oil Company refinery began production in 1956 at the northern end of North Shore. Other industries established at that time included Coca-Cola Bottlers, Pilkington Glass and Ryland Brothers (later BHP) wire and wire products factory. The suburb has an Australian Rules football team competing in the Geelong Football League.

It was the first Soviet helicopter to enter serial production. It is powered by one 575 hp Ivchenko AI-26V radial. It entered service in 1950 and was first seen on the 1951 Soviet Aviation Day, Tushino and was produced for 16 years. More than 1,000 were built in the USSR and 1,594 in Poland, as SM-1. Development Mikhail Mil began work on rotary- winged aircraft before 1930, but the Mi-1, his first production helicopter, was begun in 1946, under a designation EG-1. In 1947 Mil became a head of OKB-4 design bureau in Tushino, and works were intensified. A final design was named GM-1 (for Gyelikopter Mila, Mil's Helicopter).Soviet engineers tried to create a completely original design. So, they made a rotor hub with spaced vertical and horizontal hinges. This design increased the efficiency of helicopter control and was much simpler than that used on American helicopters. The prototype completed first free flight on 20 September 1948 (pilot Mikhail Baikalov). In 1949 it underwent official state trials. Despite crashes of two prototypes,On 24 November 1948, in which Mikhail Baikalov bailed out, and on 7 March 1949, in which Baikalov died the design was an overall success, and after further work, was ordered for a production, under a new designation Mi-1, for Mil initials. The production was initially limited ‚Äî the first series of only 15 machines was ordered on 21 February 1950, in factory No.3 in Moscow. Only after presentation to Joseph Stalin in 1951, the authorities decided to increase production. In 1952‚Äì1953, 30 Mi-1 were manufactured in Kazan, and from 1954 a mass production started in Orenburg and from 1956 in Rostov (current Rostvertol). The design was a subject of further improvements during production, mostly increasing reliability. Especially a rotor technology was changing. Period between repair increased to 300 hours in Mi-1T (hence a letter T for trekhsotchasovoi, 300-hour), 600 in Mi-1A, then to 1,000 and 3,000 hours by the end of production. The Helicopter Museum Mil Mi-1M All early variants seated pilot in front and two passengers behind him, in common cabin.Grzegorzewski, 1975 and Mi-1 at Ugolok neba The first production variant was Mi-1, quickly replaced by improved Mi-1T, that carried extra operational equipment including full radio and blind-flying instruments, and had more reliable engine AI-26V.Grzegorzewski, 1975 and Mi-1T at Ugolok neba The next basic variant was the Mi-1A of 1957, with further increased reliability and provisions for one 160 l external fuel tank.Grzegorzewski, 1975 and Mi-1A at Ugolok neba A new major variant, Mi-1M in 1957 introduced an enlarged cabin and the more powerful AI-26VF engine, which allowed the accommodation of three passengers on a bench behind the pilot. Cabin height increased from 1.22 to 1.26 m and width from 1.01 to 1.2 m. A noticeable difference was horizontal bottom windows line instead of slanted, with bigger rear side windows, and a less pointed fuselage nose. It could also be fitted with two external side capsules for the injured or mail.Grzegorzewski, 1975 and Mi-1M at Ugolok neba There were trials of an armed anti-tank variant Mi-1MU carried in 1961, being the first Soviet attack helicopter, but it did not enter production due to having a small payload and the cessation of production of the basic variant.Jakubovich, Nikolay. Boevye vertolety Rossii. Ot \\"Omegi\\" do \\"Alligatora\\". Moscow, Yuza & Eksmo, 2010, , pp.30-33. Well over 1,000 of all variants were built in the USSR, including a proportion of dual- control trainers (with U suffix): Mi-1U, TU, AU, MU, with the instructor seated behind a trainee. 15 were produced in Moscow in 1950, 30 in Kazan in 1952‚Äì1953, 597 in Orenburg in 1954‚Äì1958 and 370 in Rostov in 1956‚Äì1960.

Richardson also served as executive producer. The film is based on Timecop, a story created by Richardson, written by Verheiden, and drawn by Ron Randall, which appeared in the anthology comic Dark Horse Comics, published by Dark Horse Comics. The film stars Jean-Claude Van Damme as Max Walker, a police officer in 1994 and later a U.S. federal agent in 2004, when time travel has been made possible. It also stars Ron Silver as a corrupt politician and Mia Sara as Melissa Walker, the agent's wife. The story follows Walker's life as he fights time- travel crime and investigates the politician's plans. Timecop remains Van Damme's highest-grossing film as a lead actor (his second to break the $100 million barrier worldwide), becoming a cult classic with fans. Although met with mixed reviews, it is generally regarded by critics as one of Van Damme's better films. Plot By 1994, time travel has been developed and is used for illicit purposes. The Time Enforcement Commission (TEC) is established to police the use of time travel, with Senator Aaron McComb overseeing operations and financing. Police officer Max Walker is offered a position with the TEC but debates whether to accept it. Leaving home one night to work late, he and his wife Melissa are attacked by unknown assailants. Max witnesses the house explode, killing Melissa inside. Ten years later, Walker is a veteran of the TEC working under Commissioner Eugene Matuzak, who sends him back to October 1929 to prevent his former partner, Lyle Atwood, from using knowledge of the future to financially benefit from the U.S. stock market crash. When confronted, Atwood admits to working for Senator McComb, who needs funds for his upcoming presidential campaign. Fearing McComb will erase him from history, Atwood jumps to his death, but Walker catches him mid-leap and returns them both to 2004. Refusing to testify, Atwood is sentenced to execution and is returned to 1929 where he completes his fatal fall. Under investigation from Internal Affairs, Walker is assigned a new partner, TEC rookie Sarah Fielding, and together they are sent back to 1994 to investigate McComb. They witness a meeting between 1994 McComb and his business partner Jack Parker, where McComb wishes to withdraw over a disagreement about a new computer chip. They are interrupted by the 2004 McComb, who advises his younger self the chip will become highly profitable. The older McComb specifically warns his younger self they must not touch because the same matter cannot occupy the same space, then kills Parker. Fielding turns on Walker, revealing she works for McComb. After a shootout with McComb's henchmen, Fielding is wounded and Walker escapes back to 2004. Walker finds the future has been altered. McComb is now the sole owner of the computer company and is a presidential front runner while the TEC is being shut down due to budget cuts. Walker appeals to Matuzak, who has no knowledge the changes in history. Curious how McComb is able to travel through time, they realize the original prototype machine was never dismantled. Realizing Walker may be right, Matuzak sends him back to the past to restore history, sacrificing himself in the process as he is shot by the TEC's security who work for McComb. Back in 1994, Walker finds Fielding in the hospital. She agrees to testify against McComb, but is murdered in her room shortly thereafter. While at the hospital, Walker finds a record of a recent visit by his wife Melissa, discovering she was pregnant. Realizing she will be killed later that night, he finds her and reveals himself to be from the future. She agrees to make sure the 1994 Walker stays home that night. That night, the 1994 Walker is attacked just as before, the assailants being in McComb's employ, but is unknowingly aided by his older self who has been lying in wait. With the assailants defeated, the 2004 McComb steps in and takes Melissa hostage, confronting the older Walker with the bomb that will blow up the house. McComb knows he will now also die in the ensuing explosion, but is satisfied his younger self will survive and become president with Walker gone. However, Walker reveals he lured the 1994 McComb to the house, who enters the room. Walker pushes the two McCombs together and they merge into a writhing, screaming mass before disappearing from existence forever. 2004 Walker escapes with Melissa before the bomb explodes and leave her beside his unconscious younger self before returning to the future. Back in 2004, the timeline has changed for the better. McComb mysteriously vanished in 1994, allowing the TEC to remain active without his interference. Matuzak and Fielding are alive, although Fielding does not recognize Walker now. Walker returns home to find Melissa alive and waiting for him with their young son.

Richardson developed the story, while the comic was written by Mark Verheiden and drawn by Ron Randall. The comic told a story of Max Walker, a Time Enforcement Commission agent whose wife is implied to be dead (though the circumstances of this are unknown). Max pursues an illegal time traveler robbing a South African diamond mine in the 1930s. After capturing the robber and returning to present time, Walker realizes the timeline has been damaged because the criminal's robotic bodyguard remained in the past and was still active. Walker returns to the 1930s and defeats the robot with the help of a local whom he rewards with a diamond. Returning home, the timeline is largely restored but readers see the local became a political leader who helped end Apartheid. Richardson and Verheiden then teamed up to write the screenplay for the movie adaptation. ProductionMusic The musical score of Timecop was composed by Mark Isham and conducted by Ken Kugler.

The DVD extras include production notes, a theatrical trailer and notes on the cast and crew. By 2010, the rights to the film had reverted to Largo successor InterMedia, and distribution shifted to Warner Home Video. A Blu-ray of the film was released as a double feature for both this and Bloodsport from Warner Home Video on September 14, 2010, which has the full uncut 98-minute version in 2.35:1 widescreen, but no extra features. Reception=Box office Timecop was released on September 16, 1994, where it opened at the number 1 spot with $12,064,625 from 2,228 theaters, and a $5,415 average per theater. In its second week, it took the top spot again with $8,176,615. It finished its run with $45 million in the U.S. Overseas, it grossed about $57 million, for a total gross of $101 million. This makes it Van Damme's highest-grossing film in which he played the leading role, and his second to make over $100 million overall (after Universal Soldier). Critical response Critics were mixed on Timecop, citing its various plot holes and inconsistencies. Roger Ebert called Timecop a low-rent Terminator. Richard Harrington of The Washington Post said, \\"For once, Van Damme's accent is easier to understand than the plot.\\" David Richards of The New York Times disparaged Van Damme's acting and previous films but called Timecop \\"his classiest effort to date\\". Timecop holds a 45% and 5.24/10 average rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 44 reviews, with 20 fresh reviews and 24 rotten. The site's consensus is: \\"It's no Terminator, but for those willing to suspend disbelief and rational thought, Timecop provides limited sci-fi action rewards.\\" Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B+\\" on an A+ to F scale. The film made Entertainment Weekly's \\"Underrated Films\\" list in November 2010, mostly because of Van Damme's acting. Franchise The film was followed by a TV series of the same name, running for nine episodes in 1997 on ABC. It starred T.W. King as Jack Logan and Cristi Conaway as Claire Hemmings. A direct-to-DVD sequel, Timecop 2: The Berlin Decision, was released in 2003, starring Jason Scott Lee and Thomas Ian Griffith, and directed by Steve Boyum. In 2010, Universal Pictures announced a remake of the film, to be written by Mark and Brian Gunn. The film, which was originally based on a comic, was adapted into a two-issue comic book series of the same name. A game based on the movie was developed by Cryo Interactive and released on the SNES in 1995. Additionally, a series of tie-in novels by author Dan Parkinson published in 1997‚Äì1999 featured the Jack Logan character from the television series.

Development The Ka-26 entered production in 1969. 816 have been built. A variant with a single turboshaft engine is the Ka-126. A twin turboshaft-powered version is the Ka-226. (All the Ka-26/126/128/226 variants are code-named by NATO as \\"Hoodlum\\"). Design The fuselage of the Ka-26 consists of a fixed, bubble-shaped cockpit containing the pilot and co-pilot, plus a removable, variable box available in medevac, passenger-carrying and crop duster versions. The helicopter can fly with or without the box attached for flexibility. It is powered by two 325 hp (239 kW) Vedeneyev M-14V-26 radial engines mounted in outboard nacelles. The Ka-26 is small enough to land on a large truck bed. The reciprocating engines are more responsive than turboshaft engines, but require more maintenance. It runs mostly at 95% power in crop dusting with usually excess payload, leaving little reserve power for emergencies. Due to frequent overloads, the interconnect shaft joining the two engines is prone to breakage and requires frequent inspection. The standard instrumentation of the Ka-26, like larger naval Kamovs, may be overkill for civilian or crop dusting use. The 18-dials cockpit panel masks a part of the right-downwards view, needed to avoid telephone and power lines at low altitudes. The instrument panel may be simplified to retain the six main dials. As there is a low rotor clearance at the aircraft front, it is approached from the rear when the rotors are turning. Due to the limitations of the Ka-26, USSR and Romania agreed under the Comecon trade to build a single-turboshaft engine version, the Kamov Ka-126, with better aerodynamics and range. Operational history The Ka-26 was used by some Warsaw Pact armies in the light paratroop or airborne role, but its slow (150 km/h) cruise speed compared with the Mil-2 (220 km/h) limits its military use. However, its shorter length (7.75 m) compared with the Mil Mi-2 (11.9 m) and smaller rotor diameter (13 m vs. 14.6 m) are advantageous when operating in an urban area. It has a longer range than the Mil-2 as well. The Ka-26 is eminently useful for crop dusting. The coaxial main rotor configuration, which makes the Ka-26 small and agile, also results in a delicate airflow pattern under the helicopter, providing a thorough, yet mild distribution of chemicals onto plants. The Ka-26 is often used to spray grape farms in Hungary, where conventional \\"main rotor and tail rotor\\" layout helicopters would damage or up-root the vine-stocks with their powerful airflow. Hungarian Kamov operators claim that coaxial rotors of the Ka-26 creates an airflow which allows pesticides to settle underneath, rather than on top of, the leaves, this means a much more effective distribution of pesticides, as most pests and parasites do not live on the top side of foliage. Additionally, the coaxial vortex system is symmetrical, allowing the distribution of the pesticide to be more uniform. On 30 June 2020, Moldovan police and prosecutors closed down an illegal factory producing unlicensed copies of the Ka-26. The factory had a production line with ten air frames in various stages of completion that were intended for sale to clients in former Soviet countries.

This is a list of malacologists, scientists who study Mollusca mollusks, such as snails, clams, octopuses, and others, in a discipline named malacology. People who specialize in studying only or primarily the shells of mollusks are sometimes called conchologists instead of malacologists. Many of these malacologists are notable for having named species and other taxa of mollusks. This list focuses primarily on people who study or studied recent taxa of mollusks rather than fossil mollusks, so only a few paleontologists are included here. The list also includes researchers who devoted some of their research effort to malacology and some to other sciences. Considering that mollusks are such a very large and diverse phylum of invertebrates, malacology in general is greatly understaffed in its research efforts. For example, there is no living malacological expert who can properly identify all the species of Onchidiidae (about 143 species).Dayrat B.

It was founded in 1925 by Peter Bang and Svend Olufsen, who designed a radio to work with alternating current, a product of significance at a time when most radios were still running on batteries. In May 2015, HARMAN International Industries (which later became a subsidiary of Samsung), announced the completion of its acquisition of Bang & Olufsen Automotive car audio business. In March 2017, Tymphany, an audio ODM based in Hong Kong and with manufacturing operations in Dongchen, announced the acquisition of the engineering and manufacturing operation in the Czech Republic from Bang & Olufsen. History=Early history Peter Bang (1900‚Äì1957), son of Camillo Bang, a successful Danish businessman, showed great interest in radio technology from an early age. After graduating as an engineer in 1924, he spent six months working in a U.S. radio factory. Upon his return to Denmark, he teamed up with his friend Svend Olufsen (1897‚Äì1949), whose parents made the attic of their manor house in Struer in Jutland available for experiments. When they officially opened their business in 1925, Bang concentrated on the technology while Olufsen dealt with business. There were a number of successful developments in the 1930s and 1940s, including a sound recording system for the film industry, roof-mounted loudspeakers for circuses and army vehicles, and the iconic Beolit 39 radio with a Bakelite cabinet. Beolit 39 from 1938, B&O;'s first radio in Bakelite It was, however, many years before their business became significantly profitable. The firm suffered a huge setback towards the end of World War II when its factory at Gimsing in Struer in Northwestern Jutland was burnt down by pro-Nazi saboteurs as punishment for the management's refusal to collaborate with the Germans. Undeterred, Bang and Olufsen rebuilt the factory, producing electric razors until 1955, and then going on to develop a range of radio, radiogram, and television sets, later influenced by designer Ib Fabiansen when he began work for the company in 1957.\\"The true story behind Bang and Olufsen\\", William Schwark, Scanorama, November 2007 In the 1990s, B&O; opened its dedicated stores, selling directly to users instead of selling through retailers. The production of audio separates was discontinued in favor of mini-type audio systems sold, as was usual for B&O;, at a price higher than the industry average. Recent history Due to the economic crisis of 2008 the company experienced a sharp decline in sales and announced significant losses; between 2008 and 2009, annual revenue plunged from $853 million to $528 million, and its stock price plummeted from $52 to $8.50. A restructuring plan included 300 layoffs in Denmark on 21 October 2008, and the abandonment of development of new mobile phones, MP3 players, and standalone systems like DVD2 and HDR2. Instead, the company focused on its traditional strengths: high-quality audio and video products as well as sound systems for the automotive industry.Bang & Olufsen rolls out strategy plan bang-olufsen.com B&O; returned to profitability in 2010. In January 2015, B&O; revealed that the firm would consider bid approaches from competitors due to a profit warning issued at the end of 2014.\\"Denmark's Bang & Olufsen would listen to bid approaches\\", Reuters, 5 January 2015 In March 2015, HP Inc. announced that B&O; would become the company's new premium audio partner for its computers and other devices. In January 2020, Bang & Olufsen A/S reported its third consecutive quarterly loss as the Danish hifi maker struggled with a buildup of inventory after consumers balked at buying $500 headphones. Operations and products Despite its decision to suspend the manufacture of separate components, B&O; continues to develop and market loudspeakers. Its flagship speaker, the BeoLab 5, uses digital signal processing to adjust its frequency response to the room and location in which it is placed. Its midrange and treble drivers use the audio lens technology developed by Sausalito Audio's Manny LaCarrubba to spread the sound over a 180-degree range in order to fill the room, overcoming the directional range limitations of normal midrange and treble drivers, and preventing the sound from reflecting off the ceiling and floor before reaching the listener. B&O; later acquired the audio lens technology in 2007. In 2003, B&O; entered into an agreement with Audi to provide an advanced sound system and in 2005 a sound system based on the BeoLab 5 with 1000 W amplifiers became available to Audi's flagship model, the A8. Audi markets this sound system using the Bang & Olufsen brand name. A unique feature of this sound system is its motorized tweeters that emerge from the dashboard when the sound system is turned on.3rd generation Audi A8 Audi subsequently extended the optional advanced sound system to their A4, A5, A6, A7, A8, Q5, Q7, TT and R8 models. It is a US$6,300 option on the A8/Q7. B&O; also supplies sound systems for higher-end, premium vehicles such as the Aston Martin DBS, Rapide, BMW 5 Series, BMW 5 Series Gran Turismo, BMW 6 Series, BMW M6, BMW's flagship 7 Series, BMW X5 and Mercedes-Benz AMG models.Mercedes AMG S-class\\"mercedes- amg.com Ford has also begun to replace the Sony sound systems in their vehicles with B&O; PLAY audio systems in new models, such as the revised 2018 F-150 and the 2019 Ranger. In addition to consumer products the company also produces business-to-business services, particularly in the area of custom audio-visual installations for car manufacturers, and the hospitality industry. Additionally the company's expertise in aluminium manufacturing is available to other businesses for the production of non-B&O; products.Bang & Olufsen - Business to Business bang-olufsen.com Design B&O; has a distinctive design appeal that Wired described as \\"quality media delivery via striking objects\\". Their work with radios and loudspeakers led them to value high fidelity musical reproduction uninfluenced by technological limitations; in Danish √Ürlig musikgengivelse, meaning \\"honest music reproduction\\". To this end, psychoacoustics was important to designing and testing B&O; products. By 1960, B&O; had begun its foray into global markets with star designers Henning Moldenhawer and Jacob Jensen. B&O; hires designers rather than directly employing them in the company. David Lewis, who became involved with B&O; in 1965 then went on to design most of the company's products after 1980.

The ship was launched on 20 April 1940 at the Sun Shipbuilding & Drydock Co. in Chester, Pennsylvania. She was requisitioned by the Allied forces to re-supply the island fortress of Malta during the Second World War.Holland, James, Fortress Malta: An Island Under Siege, 1940‚Äì1943 (Cassell Military 2004) . The tanker played a fundamental role in Operation Pedestal, which was one of the fiercest and most heavily contested of the Malta convoys, in August 1942.Spooner, Tony. Supreme Gallantry: Malta's Role in the Allied Victory, 1939‚Äì1945 (London, 1996). Although Ohio reached Malta successfully, she was so badly damaged that she had to be effectively scuttled in order to offload her cargo, and never sailed again. The tanker is fondly remembered in Malta, where to this day she is considered to be the savior of the beleaguered island.  Construction and launch  Hull 190, as Ohio was identified before her launch, was a skilful compromise, promising broad cargo-carrying capacity to the merchant and speed, balance, and stability to the mariner. Above the waterline, the construction echoed the outward curve of a schooner's bow, bearing the influence of the old American clipper ship design. The design of Hull 190 was influenced also by the menace of a rearming Germany and a Japanese Empire bent on military expansion. The approach of war had influenced this design, the unofficial conversations between military and oil chiefs resulted in a ship of 9,264 gross register tons, 515 feet in overall length, and capable of carrying of fuel oil, bigger and with a larger capacity than any other tanker previously built. The ship was completed in the unusually short time of seven months and fifteen days.. The Westinghouse turbine engines developed 9,000 driveshaft horsepower at ninety revolutions per minute, which allowed a maximum sixteen knots. Ohio was considered the fastest tanker of her era. Her method of construction was controversial. For some years, the issue of welding versus riveting had been raging on both sides of the Atlantic. Hull 190 was built using the new-fashioned welded method, with hopes it would prove once and for all its reliability. The ship also had a composite framing system with two longitudinally continuous bulkheads, which divided the ship into twenty-one cargo tanks. The ship was launched the day after that scheduled, prompting superstitious fear in the welders, steel-cutters and other craftsmen who had assembled to watch her launch. Hull 190 was christened in a ceremony presided over by the mother of William Starling Sullivant Rodgers, president of the Texas Oil Company, Florence E. Rodgers, who, grasping the ceremonial bottle of champagne in her hand, pronounced the words: The ship slid down No. 2 slipway, entering the waters of the Delaware River. The existence of Ohio would, in her initial years, be uneventful and ordinary, plying between Port Arthur and various other American harbors. She set a speed record from Bayonne to Port Arthur, covering in four days and twelve hours, an average of more than seventeen knots.Pearson, Michael, THE OHIO AND MALTA, (Pen and Sword Books)  Malta, \\"Pedestal\\" planning and Ohio  In 1942, Britain was waging war in the Mediterranean against the German Afrika Korps and Italian forces in North Africa. Crucial to this theatre of operations was the island of Malta, \\"The Mediterranean campaign revolved around the island of Malta, where the British based surface ships, submarines and aircraft [were] to attack the supplies for [the] Italian and German armies in North Africa. Major convoy operations were mounted to sustain Malta and the island narrowly survived.\\" sitting in the middle of Axis supply lines and, if supplied with sufficient munitions, aircraft and fuel, capable of causing severe shortages to the German and Italian armies in North Africa. Munitions and aircraft were available‚Äîduring a brief lull in the Axis attacks, for example, the island's defenses were reinforced by thirty eight Spitfire Mk V aircraft flown in from ‚Äîbut these, along with food and fuel, remained in critically short supply. Successive attempts at resupplying the island had mostly failed; the convoys \\"Harpoon\\" (from Gibraltar) and \\"Vigorous\\" (from Alexandria, Egypt) saw most of their merchantmen sunk and escort ships damaged by aerial and surface attacks. One of the ships lost during \\"Harpoon\\" was Ohios sister ship SS Kentucky, crippled by a German air attack and then abandoned. The tanker was eventually finished off by the Italian cruisers Raimondo Montecuccoli and Eugenio di Savoia and two destroyers. On 18 June, following the failures of \\"Harpoon\\" and \\"Vigorous\\", the Commander in Chief of the Mediterranean Fleet cabled the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill to express his doubts about attempting another convoy.Wade, Frank, A Midshipman's War: A Young Man in the Mediterranean Naval War, 1941‚Äì1943, Trafford Publishing (), Chapter IX. Three days later, Ohio steamed into the mouth of the Clyde, under the command of Sverre Petersen, a former Master in Sail from Oslo, in Norway. In early May 1942, a radio message had reached Captain Petersen which diverted the ship to Galveston in Texas, and then ordered the tanker to proceed to Britain. Before leaving, Ohio was fitted with one gun on her stern, and a AA gun in the bows. She then moved to Sinclair Terminal, Houston in Texas, where the ship loaded a full cargo of of petrol (gasoline), finally sailing on 25 May. Ohio discharged her cargo at Bowling-on-the-Clyde, then steamed out into the tideway and anchored, awaiting orders. Here, the captain received a letter from Lord Leathers, the head of the British Ministry of War Transport, bidding the master a personal welcome and \\"...your safe arrival in the Clyde with the first cargo of oil carried in a United States tanker.\\" However, the euphoria that such a message brought to the crew soon turned into resentment and anger. A telegram was received the same day by the head office of Texaco, from the War Shipping Administration, announcing simply that Ohio was being requisitioned \\"pursuant to the law\\". The immediate reaction was a cabled message from Mr. T. E. Buchanan, General Manager of Texaco's Marine Department to the firm's London agent, that on no account was Ohio to leave her discharging port of Bowling-on-the-Clyde. A period of indecision, meetings and debates between the highest American authorities and their British counterparts soon ensued. The master was told that further orders would arrive soon afterwards. The decision was finally taken two weeks later, when a launch sped out to the ship anchored in the Clyde and Texaco's London agent, accompanied by an official of the British Ministry of War Shipping came over the side. They met the Captain, who was informed that the ship was to be confiscated and handed over to a British crew. The American crew and the captain were exasperated by the seemingly outrageous order, but had no other option but to give in, and started to pack their kit whilst British seamen began to take the ship over. On 10 July, Captain Petersen handed over the ship. There was no formal ceremony, and little goodwill. The American flag was taken down, and Ohio henceforward sailed under the \\"Red Duster\\". Overnight, she was transferred from American to British registry. For convenience in management, the tanker was handed over on 25 July to the Eagle Oil and Shipping Company, which was warned of the importance of the impending convoy and that \\"...much might depend on the quality and courage of the crew.\\"Sam Moses, At All Costs: How a Crippled Ship and Two American Merchant Marines Turned the Tide of World War II, New York: Random House, 2006 (). Rear-Admiral H M Burrough, CB, who commanded the close escort, shaking hands with Captain Dudley Mason As the British crew started to assemble, it became clear that a large convoy was being planned. Command of the ship passed to Captain Dudley W. Mason, who at thirty nine had already held other commands, while James Wyld was to be Chief Engineer. Forty eight hours after Ohio had been transferred to British registry, her crew was completed. The ship's company numbered seventy seven, including no fewer than twenty four naval ratings and soldiers to serve the guns. The ship was then moved to King George V Dock in Glasgow, for the fitting of Oerlikon and Bofors anti-aircraft guns. Ohio and \\"Pedestal\\"Departure= After the disastrous failure of the mid-June convoys, it was wondered if Malta could hold out on the meagre supplies rescued from \\"Harpoon\\" and \\"Vigorous\\" and individual deliveries carried out by submarine and by the fast minelayer HMS Welshman until another convoy could be organised. Escorting merchant ships in the brilliance of a Mediterranean moonlit period was courting inevitable disaster. This situation limited operations in the immediate future to the moonless period in July or August between the 10th and 16th of those months. July passed as the Ohio could not be fitted-out in time. Once the due planning had been carried out it was decided to begin the operation in August. Ohio steamed down to Dunglass on the Clyde and loaded 11,500 tons of kerosene and diesel fuel oils. She was the only ship carrying these supplies which were so vital to Malta's survival. Before she sailed special strengthening was given to the tanker to protect her against the shock of bombs exploding near her. In the previous convoy, the tanker Kentucky had been sunk with only a few hours' repair work needed on a steam pipe, which had been broken by the force of such explosions. The Ministry was determined that this should not happen again, and so Ohios engines were mounted on rubber bearings, to reduce shock, and all steam pipes were supported with steel springs and baulks of timber. While the merchant ships were gathering in the Clyde Estuary, the naval forces had already reached Scapa Flow. Admiral Syfret joined there on 27 July and held a convoy conference on 2 August; the same day, all leave had been stopped. At eight o'clock that evening, two hours before dusk, the convoy sailed. The fourteen ships, led by formed up; it was dark by the time they reached the open sea. =Axis attacks and damage= The convoy left Gibraltar in heavy fog on 9 August. A day later, four torpedoes from the German submarine U-73 sank the aircraft-carrier , killing 260 men, and losing all but four planes. On this day, German bombers attacked the convoy. On 12 August twenty Junkers 88s attacked the convoy, while a further combined strike by 100 German and Italian Regia Aeronautica planes attacked the merchantmen. It was during the ensuing mayhem that the tanker was torpedoed by the Italian submarine AxumWingate, John. The Fighting Tenth: The Tenth Submarine Flotilla and the Siege of Malta (London, 1991). and caught fire. The Ohio was hit amidships, where a huge pillar of flame leapt high into the air. Ohio seemed to be out of control. Captain Mason ordered the engines to be shut down, with all deckhands available fighting the fire with the deck waterlines. Lighted kerosene bubbled up from the fractured tanks, while little gouts of flame spattered the deck to a distance of thirty yards from the blaze. The flames were put out and the tanker managed thirteen knots after being repaired. The blast destroyed the ship's gyrocompass and knocked the magnetic compass off its bearings, while the steering gear was put out of action, forcing the crew to steer with the emergency gear from aft.Thomas, David A, Malta Convoys (Pen and Sword Books) . A torpedo from Axum, an Italian submarine, strikes the tanker on her port side. A hole, 24 feet by 27 feet, had been torn in the port side of the midships pump-room. The explosion had also blown another hole in the starboard side, flooding the compartment. There were jagged tears in the bulkheads and kerosene was spurting up from adjoining tanks, seeping in a film up through the holes in the hull. The deck had been broken open, so that one could look down into the ship. From beam to beam the deck was buckled, but the ship held together. Another sixty Junkers 87 Stuka dive bombers attacked the convoy, focusing on Ohio. A series of near misses ensued as the tanker approached the island of Pantelleria. Bombs threw spray over the decks of the tanker, while aircraft used their machine guns. One near-miss buckled the ship's plates and the forward tank filled with water. The 3-inch (76 mm) gun at the bows was twisted in its mountings and put out of action. A formation of five Junkers 88s was broken up by the tanker's anti aircraft guns, with the bombs falling harmlessly into the sea. Another plane, this time a Junkers 87, was shot down by an Ohio gunner; however, the aircraft crashed into Ohios starboard side, forward of the upper bridge, and exploded. Half a wing hit the upper work of the bridge and a rain of debris showered the tanker from stem to stern. The plane's bomb failed to detonate. Captain Mason was telephoned from aft by the chief officer, who told Mason that the Junkers 87 had crashed into the sea and then bounced onto the ship. Mason 'rather curtly' replied: \\"Oh that's nothing. We've had a Junkers 88 on the foredeck for nearly half an hour.\\"Arthur, Max ‚Äì Forgotten Voices of The Second World War, 2004, Random House, p.172 Ohio nursed by a flotilla of destroyers and minesweepers. As the ship turned slowly to comb torpedoes, two sticks of bombs fell on either side of the tanker. The vessel lifted, and went on lifting until she was clean out of the water. Cascades of spray and bomb splinters lashed the deck, she fell back with a crash. Ohio had differential gearing which slowed the propeller automatically; on other ships, the same effect would have shaken the engines out of their rooms. Continuously bombed, the tanker kept on steaming until another explosion to starboard sent her reeling to port. The engine-room lights went out, plunging her into darkness. The master switches had been thrown off by the force of the explosion, but they were quickly switched on again by an electrician. This time, the ship had not escaped damage. The boiler fires were blown out, and it was a race against time to restore them before the steam pressure dropped too low to work the fuel pumps. The engineers lit the fire starter torches to restart the furnaces. The complicated routine of restarting went forward smoothly and within twenty minutes Ohio was steaming at sixteen knots again. Then another salvo of bombs hit the ship, shaking every plate, and once more the engines slowed and stopped. The electric fuel pumps had been broken by the concussion. While the crew desperately tried to reconnect the electrical wires and restart the engines via the auxiliary steam system, the engine-room was filled with black smoke until the engines were properly re-lit. The ship was making alternate black and white smoke and, with oil in the water pipes and a loss of vacuum in the condenser, Ohio started to lose way slowly, coming to a stop at 10.50 am. The crew abandoned ship, boarding that had come to Ohios aid alongside another destroyer, . The latter ship was soon to leave the stricken tanker after being ordered to go in search of the cruiser , which had been crippled by Italian motor torpedo boats. =Under tow= Penn 's commanding officer, Commander J.H. Swain RN, offered Captain Mason a tow with a heavy 10-inch manila hemp rope. With the tow line in place, Penn moved ahead, straining its engines to the limit; Ohio continued to list to port. The two ships were not making any progress, even drifting backwards due to the easterly wind. Now both ships were sitting ducks, and as another serious attack developed, the destroyer went to full speed to part the tow. A German bomber dove on the tanker and was shot down by Ohio 's gunners, but just before its demise, the aircraft's crew released its cargo. A bomb hit the tanker just where the initial torpedo had hit her, effectively breaking her back, just as night was setting in. The ship was abandoned for the night. The day after, Penn was joined by the minesweeper . The two ships towed the tanker and succeeded in making up to five knots, overcoming the tendency to swing to port. Another attack blasted the group of ships, snapping the tow lines and immobilising Ohios rudder. Another bomb hit the fore end of the front deck, forcing the engineers out of the engine room. Once more, Mason gave the order to abandon ship, as two more air attacks narrowly missed the tanker. A superficial examination showed that the rent that had developed in the amidships section had widened and that the ship had indeed almost certainly broken her back.Smith, Peter C., Pedestal: The Convoy That Saved Malta (Goodall Publications) The damaged tanker, supported by Royal Navy destroyers HMS Penn (left) and Ledbury (right). The two ships around the tanker were joined by HMS Bramham and by Ledbury (the latter returning from her search for Manchester). Meanwhile, Rye had again begun to tow Ohio with the newly arrived Ledbury acting as a stern tug. With less pull from Ledbury, a fair speed was maintained, but steering proved impossible. A stabilising factor was needed, thus Commander Swain edged Penn to the starboard side of Ohio. Rye, joined by Bramham, slowly got under way once more, with Ledbury acting as a rudder. Another Axis air attack began just as the group of ships was moving at six knots. At 10.45 AM the first wave of dive-bombers came low over the water. Only one oil bomb landed close to Ohios bow, showering her with burning liquid. Then came three more echelons of German planes. This time, close air support from Malta was available.Smith, Peter C. The Battles of the Malta Striking Forces (London, 1974) Sixteen Spitfires, of 249 and 229 Squadrons from Malta, had sighted the enemy.McAulay, Lex. Against All Odds: RAAF Pilots in the Battle for Malta, 1942 (Milsons Point, Australia, 1989) The first enemy formation wavered and broke. The second formation also broke, but one section of Junkers 88s succeeded in breaking free, making for the tanker. These were swiftly followed by the Spitfires. Three of the German planes were shot down or manoeuvred to evade the Spitfires; nonetheless one bomber held its course, and a 1,000-pound bomb landed in the tanker's wake. Ohio was flung forward, parting Ryes tow, buckling the stern plates of the tanker and forming a great hole.Jellison, Charles A. Besieged: The World War II Ordeal of Malta, 1940‚Äì1942 (Hanover, NH, 1984) =Arrival= Ohio was sinking not much more than 45 miles west of Malta. Under the protection of the Spitfires, the danger of enemy attacks receded. After the tow line was parted, Ledbury was still secured to Ohio by a heavy wire which had been pulled round by the heavily yawing tanker, and had ended up alongside Penn, facing the wrong way. After a quick analysis of the possibilities, it was decided to tow the tanker with a destroyer on either side of the tanker. Bramham was immediately ordered to make for port, while Penn remained coupled to the starboard side.Bradford, Ernle. Siege: Malta 1940‚Äì1943 (New York, 1986) The speed was increased but kept to five knots, Ohios deck was awash amidships. Now under the protection of the coastal batteries of Malta, the group of ships were slowly moving around the island, approaching Grand Harbour. The coastal batteries fired on a creeping U-Boat's conning tower, and scared off a group of E-Boats. Slowly, the group approached the tricky harbour entrance, near Zonqor Point. Here the group dispersed before a British-laid minefield.Leighton, Frank. Frayed Lifelines: A Siege Survivor's Story (Trafford Publishing) At 6.00am, with Ohio still hovering on the edge of the minefield, the situation was eased by the arrival of the Malta tugs. With destroyers still linked on either side of the tanker, these sturdy ships made fast ahead and astern and the tanker was soon proceeding up the channel to the Grand Harbour entrance.Attard, Joseph. The Battle of Malta (London, 1980) There, a fabulous welcome awaited them. On the ramparts above the wreck strewn harbour, on the Barracca, St Angelo and Senglea, great crowds of Maltese men and women waved and cheered and a brass band on the end of the mole was giving a spirited rendition of Rule Britannia. Captain Mason, however, standing at the salute on the battered bridge of Ohio, could spare not a moment's thought for the pride of bringing the ship to harbour, since the creaking plates showed that Ohio might still go to the bottom of the Grand Harbour.Hogan, George. Malta: The Triumphant Years, 1940‚Äì1943 (London, 1978) Ohio discharges her cargo in the Grand Harbour. Pipes were now hauled aboard and emergency salvage pumps began to discharge the kerosene. At the same time, a fleet auxiliary, RFA Boxol, began to pump the 10,000 tons of fuel oil into her own tanks. As the oil flowed out, Ohio sank lower and lower in the water. The last drops of oil left her and simultaneously her keel settled on the bottom.Caroline Vernon. Our Name Wasn't Written ‚Äì A Malta Memoir (Canberra, Australia, 1992) Her captain, Dudley William Mason, was subsequently awarded the George Cross. =Aftermath= After Ohio reached Malta, the ship broke in two from the damage she had sustained. There were insufficient shipyard facilities to repair the tanker, so the two halves were used for storage, and later barracks facilities for Yugoslavian troops. On 19 September 1946 the forward half of Ohio was towed ten miles offshore and sunk by gunfire from the destroyer . On 3 October, the stern half was scuttled in deep water using explosive charges laid by the salvage vessel RFA Salventure. Epilogue The final ship built for the Texaco fleet was Star Ohio, in honour of the famous Second World War tanker. She is operated by Northern Marine Management on behalf of Chevron. The nameplate, ships wheel, ensign and several other objects of Ohio are preserved in Malta's National War Museum in Valletta. The arrival of Ohio at the Grand Harbour provided the climax of the 1953 British war film, Malta Story.

Only one flightworthy prototype was built, which was first flown in October 1959. The M-50 was constructed by the Myasishchev design bureau. Design and development The M-50 was a fast jet bomber with four engines: two Dobrynin VD-7 non-afterburning turbojet engines at the outer and two VD-7F afterburning turbojet engines at the inner positions. The two inner engines were located under the wing and the two outer on the wingtips of its shoulder- mounted, truncated delta wings. The second aircraft was designated M-52 and carried Zubets 16-17 turbofans, around which the aircraft had been designed. The engine installation was modified, and a second tailplane added to the top of the fin. The fore-end of the M-52 has been redesigned, in place of the tandem cockpit of the M-50 with seats in a row, the M-52 had a wider cockpit with the two pilots sitting side by side. Photo Myasishchev M-52 mockup. The M-50 participated in a Soviet Aviation Day flyby in 1961. The M-52 was completed but was not flight tested. An unmanned M-51 intercontinental cruise missile variant was developed, would have delivered multiple warheads on targets in the contiguous United States.http://www.astronautix.com/m/m-51.html Like most of the early 1960s supersonic strategic bomber projects, the M-50/52 program was terminated due to the development of the intercontinental ballistic missiles and the priority assigned to the Soviet space program. Nuclear bomber hoax The 1 December 1958 issue of Aviation Week included an article Soviets Flight Testing Nuclear Bomber claiming that the Soviets had made great progress in their own nuclear aircraft program.Soviets Flight Testing Nuclear Bomber, Aviation Week, 1 December 1958, p. 27. This was accompanied by an editorial on the topic as well. The magazine claimed that the aircraft was real beyond a doubt, stating that \\"A nuclear-powered bomber is being flight tested in the Soviet Union. ... It has been observed both in flight and on the ground by a wide variety of foreign observers from Communist and non-Communist countries.\\" In reality, however, the article was based on a hoax. The aircraft in the photographs was later revealed to be a M-50 and not a nuclear-powered plane at all. In reality, in the early 1960s Soviet Union did test a technology demonstrator for a nuclear-powered strategic bomber, Tupolev Tu-95LAL, similar to the somewhat earlier American Convair NB-36H project, but, being based on the turboprop Tu-95, it was never supersonic, it never flew under nuclear power (its main goal was to test the nuclear reactor shielding efficiency), and, moreover, it was developed by the Tupolev Design Bureau, as Myasischev company had lost the competition to develop the prototype. It was deemed successful, but further development dragged because of environmental concerns. When the functional ICBMs appeared, the majority of funding and development effort was shifted into that field, and in the late 1960s the project was stopped.

Early years and education  Born to Yorkshire parents, at ten the boy crossed the Atlantic alone to spend the war years in and around Washington D.C. with an aunt and uncle. On D-Day in 1944 he was on his way home. At Kingswood School, Bath, a teacher, praising his Anglo-Saxon type riddles, encouraged him to think he was a poet. National Service near Leptis Magna in Libya, encouraged him further, both as a poet and as an amateur archaeologist (he eventually became a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries). Thwaite came to early prominence as a poet. While still an undergraduate at Christ Church, Oxford, he published a pamphlet with the Fantasy Press in a series that included the early work of Larkin, Kingsley Amis and Elizabeth Jennings. Poems began to appear in the Listener, the New Statesman and the Times Literary Supplement, and with his first book reviews and a series of undergraduate articles, in the Spectator. At Oxford, he edited the weekly magazine Isis, became president of the Poetry Society and met his wife, who became the biographer, Ann Thwaite. In 1955 they went by ship to teach in Japan for two years, where their first child was born and his first book of poems was published, a tribute from his postgraduate students at the University of Tokyo. It was while he was there that the Marvell Press published Larkin's The Less Deceived and accepted the MS of his own Home Truths.  Career  Thwaite returned to take up a graduate traineeship at the BBC. He had eight years there, first as a radio producer (sharing at one stage an office with Louis MacNeice), then as Literary Editor of the Listener. In 1965 he took two years unpaid leave to return to North Africa, this time as assistant professor at the University of Libya in Benghazi and with his wife and four daughters. A brief return to the BBC in 1967 ended when Thwaite was invited to be Literary Editor of the New Statesman, where his assistants were successively Claire Tomalin and James Fenton. In 1968 he won the Richard Hillary Memorial Prize for The Stones of Emptiness, a collection of poems written during these years. His subsequent career has included the following positions: Henfield Writing Fellow at the University of East Anglia, Visiting Professor at Kuwait University, Japan Foundation Fellowship at the University of Tokyo (1985‚Äì1986), co-editor of Encounter magazine (1973‚Äì1985), Poet-in-Residence at Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee. He also spent many years as an editor of the Poetry list at Secker and Warburg, and later as an editorial director of Andr√© Deutsch. Anthony Thwaite has judged many prizes and literary competitions, sat on literature advisory committees (Arts Council and British Council), presented numerous radio programmes and 'Writers World' on BBC2. In 1986 he was chairman of the Booker Prize judges. He has edited selections (Longfellow, R. S. Thomas, Skelton), and anthologies, including Six Centuries of Verse, based on the Thames Television/Channel Four 16-part series with his narration spoken by the actor John Gielgud. The English Poets, from Chaucer to Edward Thomas (1974) was based on a radio series he presented with his friend the Australian poet, Peter Porter. Thwaite was a regular book reviewer for the Observer and later for the Sunday Telegraph and the Guardian. He wrote an introduction to contemporary English poetry, which went into many editions and prepared two travelling exhibitions for the British Council. He himself travelled all over the world, reading his own poems and talking about other people's, from New Zealand to Argentina and Baghdad to Texas. He represented 'Literature' at British Week in Novosibirsk in Siberia and toured China with Malcolm Bradbury at the invitation of their governments. He has returned to Japan many times; the Penguin Book of Japanese Verse, which he edited with Geoffrey Bownas, is still in print. Thwaite has two honorary doctorates, from Hull University and from the University of East Anglia, near where he and Ann have lived for 45 years. He is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature and was awarded an OBE for services to poetry. His Late Poems and Going Out appeared after the Collected Poems. At the launch of his last (20th) book of poems, when he was 85, the distinguished audience (including Alan Hollinghurst, David Lodge, P. J. Kavanagh and Penelope Lively) gave some indication of the esteem in which he is held by his fellow writers.  Appraisal of his work  Praise for Anthony Thwaite's poetry has come from many fellow writers. The novelist Anthony Burgess commended him as 'Very intelligent, also witty, with a wide stretch of subject matter and a great boldness.' The playwright and novelist, Michael Frayn, wrote 'I think of all the living poets whose work I know Anthony Thwaite speaks to me most strongly and intimately. He writes with simplicity and precision about difficult and ambiguous things....the vastness and richness of the past, the elusiveness of the present - and the heroic persistence of our efforts to fix some trace of all this.' Thwaite has been pleased to be called 'a fine comic poet' by Sean O'Brien. One of his best light poems was included by Christopher Ricks in his 'Oxford Book of English Verse', and Thwaite is also well represented in Larkin's Oxford Book of Twentieth Century Verse. Tobias Hill called him 'a master of domestic disquiet' in the Times, reviewing his Collected Poems (2007). He wrote: 'This is spectacular poetry. It deserves to be read: good readers deserve to read it.' Works *Anthony Thwaite (Fantasy Press, 1953). Fantasy Poets 17 *Oxford Poetry 1954 (1954), editor with Jonathan Price *Poems (1957).

Produced in limited numbers, it was used to bomb Berlin in August 1941. It was also used for so-called \\"morale raids\\" designed to raise the spirit of the Soviet people by exposing Axis vulnerabilities. Its primary mission, however, was to attack German airfields, rail yards and other rear-area facilities at night, although one was used to fly the People's Commissar of Foreign Affairs (Foreign Minister) Vyacheslav Molotov from Moscow to the United States in 1942. Originally designated the TB-7, the aircraft was renamed the Pe-8 after its primary designer, Vladimir Petlyakov, died in a plane crash in 1942. Supply problems complicated the aircraft's production and the Pe-8s also had engine problems. As Soviet morale boosters, they were also high-value targets for the Luftwaffe's fighter pilots. The loss rate of these aircraft, whether from mechanical failure, friendly fire, or combat, doubled between 1942 and 1944. By the end of the war, most of the surviving aircraft had been withdrawn from combat units. After the war, some were modified as transports for important officials, and a few others were used in various Soviet testing programs. Some supported the Soviet Arctic operations until the late 1950s. Design and development Development of the Pe-8 began in July 1934, when the Soviet Air Forces (VVS) issued requirements for an aircraft to replace the obsolete and cumbersome Tupolev TB-3 heavy bomber. These requirements specified a bomber that could carry of bombs at a speed greater than at an altitude of , figures that were twice the range, speed and service ceiling of the TB-3.Pe-8: Last of a Generation, Air International, p. 80 The task was assigned to the Tupolev Design Bureau (OKB) where Andrei Tupolev handed the work to a team led by Vladimir Petlyakov and the project received the internal bureau designation of ANT-42. The resulting aircraft, a four-engined, mid-wing cantilever monoplane, was initially designated as the TB-7 (, Tyazholy Bombardirovschik‚ÄîHeavy Bomber) by the VVS and owed more to the streamlined design of the Tupolev SB than to the block-like design of the TB-3.Gunston, Tupolev Aircraft, p. 98 The bomber was built mainly of duralumin, with two steel spars in the wings, although the ailerons were fabric-covered. The pear- shaped monocoque fuselage required the pilots to sit in tandem, offset to the left. In the prototype, space for a fifth engine, an auxiliary Klimov M-100, was reserved inside the fuselage, in a fairing above the wing spars and behind the pilots. It was intended to drive a supercharger that supplied pressurized air to the Mikulin AM-34FRN engines, with the installation designated ATsN-2 (‚ÄîCentral Supercharging Unit), an idea pioneered in 1918 by the Zeppelin- Staaken firm in the German Empire, and refined further for the Third Reich Luftwaffe's Do 217P and Hs 130E experimental bomber designs. Subsequent models of the Pe-8 omitted the internal engine, and provided seating for a flight engineer and radio operator, behind and below the pilots. The bombardier sat in the nose and manned a turret armed with a ShVAK cannon that covered a 120¬∞ cone ahead. A prominent chin gondola, nicknamed the 'beard', protruded beneath the nose. The dorsal gunner sat at the rear of the ATsN fairing with a sliding hood covering a ShKAS machine gun and another ShKAS mounted in a ventral hatch. The tail gunner had a powered turret with a ShVAK and, most unusually, there were manually operated ShVAK cannon mounted at the rear of each inner engine nacelle. Crewmen had access to these positions through the wing or by a trapdoor in the upper wing surface. The large internal bomb bay racks held up to of bombs; external racks held a single FAB-500 (Fugasnaya AviaBomba - high explosive bomb) bomb under each wing.Gunston, Tupolev Aircraft, pp. 98‚Äì99Gunston, Osprey Encyclopedia, pp. 278‚Äì279Pe-8: Last of a Generation, Air International, pp. 80‚Äì81 The maiden flight of the unarmed prototype, piloted by M. M. Gromov and without the ATsN installation, occurred at Khodynka Aerodrome on 27 December 1936.Gunston, Tupolev Aircraft, pp. 99‚Äì100 After successful initial trials, the ATsN system was installed for the State acceptance trials in August 1937 and the AM-34RNB engines were fitted during the tests.Gordon (2005), p. 75 Gromov reported that the rudder was ineffective and that the outer engines overheated. Subsequent wind tunnel testing identified a problem with the aerodynamics of the radiators and nacelles. To solve this problem, the outer engines' radiators were moved into deep ducts under the inner nacelles. The Pe-8 now featured only two pronounced radiator intakes, one under each inner engine, each shared by both inner and outer engines, one of the distinctive and unique features of the aircraft. The rudder was also enlarged and redesigned with a smooth skin.Gunston, Tupolev Aircraft, p. 100 Construction of a second prototype began in April 1936, incorporating lessons from the first aircraft and feedback from the VVS. Designers widened the fuselage by ; the 'beard' was also widened and the tail section was modified to lessen resistance and improve rudder function. A reconfigured control system included an autopilot and the engineers redesigned portions of the electrical system. The engines were changed to the more powerful AM-34FRNVs and a redesigned undercarriage was fitted to the airframe. Two additional fuel tanks increased the craft's range. The defensive and offensive armament was revised, and the bomber's weaponry expanded to twin ShKAS guns in the nose, nacelle barbettes and tail turrets and a dorsal turret with a ShVAK; this design eliminated the ventral gun. The bomb bay was modified to allow for a single FAB-5000 bomb to be carried and provisions were added to carry VAP-500 or VAP-1000 poison gas dispensers under the wings. The arrests of both Tupolev and Petlyakov in October 1937, during the Great Purge, disrupted the program and the second prototype did not make its first flight until 26 July 1938.Gunston, Tupolev Aircraft, p. 101 Although this prototype served as the basis for the series aircraft, further modifications were made to the armament. New weaponry included a retractable ShVAK in the MV-6 dorsal turret, another ShVAK in a KEB tail turret and a Berezin UBT machine gun in each ShU barbette in each inner engine nacelle, on the underside of the wing covering he lower rear arc of fire to left and right, respectively. Another fuel tank further increased the range, and the 'beard' was removed entirely, replaced by a more streamlined nose. Authorization for production was slow for several reasons, including the Great Purge, but also due to the scarcity of resources, and a shortage of workers. Although production facilities in the Kazan Factory No. 124 were ready as early as 1937, the order to begin was not given until 1939. Manufacture and supply problems Engine supply problems complicated the construction of the aircraft. Production of the ATsN superchargers could not be organized in any systematic way and only the first four Pe-8s were equipped with them. Factory No. 124 shut down its Pe-8 production line at the beginning of 1940 while alternative engines were evaluated. Somewhere in the massive Soviet chain of command, the decision was made to proceed without the superchargers. The unavailability of the Klimov M-100 engine of the ATsN-2 installation required a design change, although this modification allowed a commander and radio operator to be carried in its place. Then, to compound the problem further, the production of AM-34FRNV engines ended in the second half of 1939. Only two or four Pe-8s were equipped with them. Eighteen of the aircraft produced by the end of 1940 were fitted with AM-35A engines.Gordon (2005), pp. 75‚Äì76 Rub / Petlyakov-8 / Heavy bomber\\" In 1940, six aircraft without engines were fitted with Mikulin AM-35A engines, while VVS officials evaluated both the Charomskiy ACh-30 and Charomskiy M-40 aircraft Diesel engines. At least nine Pe-8s were fitted with Diesel engines in 1941, but neither the ACh-30 nor the M-40 were entirely satisfactory, despite greatly increasing the range of the aircraft. All surviving Pe-8s were re-engined with AM-35As by the end of 1941. Production continued slowly at Factory No. 124; most of the factory's resources were devoted to the higher-priority Petlyakov Pe-2, a successful light bomber. At this time, most of these aircraft, re-designated as the Pe-8 after Petlyakov was killed in a Pe-2 crash on 12 January 1942, were built with out-of- production AM-35A engines.Gordon (2008), pp. 393‚Äì94 The 1,380-kW (1,850-hp) Shvetsov ASh-82 radial engine was proposed as a replacement to alleviate the shortage of engines and this modification went into production in late 1942. The exhaust arrangements of the ASh-82 were not compatible with the gun turrets in the rear of the engine nacelles and the guns were removed, reducing the aircraft's defensive capability. At the end of 1943, the nose turret was deleted in favor of a manually operated ShKAS machine gun in a more streamlined nose.Gunston, Osprey Encyclopedia, p. 281 This version of the aircraft proved to have much the same range as the diesel-engined versions, but reliability was greatly improved. Production of the Pe-8s totaled 93.Gordon (2008), pp. 395, 398 The last Pe-8s were completed in 1944 as Pe-8ONs (Osobovo Naznacheniya‚ÄîSpecial Mission) with Charomskiy ACh-30B engines and a fillet at the base of the vertical stabilizer. These were special VIP transports with a seating capacity of twelve and a cargo capacity of .Gordon (2005), p. 76 Sources disagree if the armament was removed and, if it was, whether partly or entirely.Gunston, Tupolev Aircraft, p. 103 Operational history=Wartime use When Operation Barbarossa began on 22 June 1941, only the 2nd Squadron of the 14th Heavy Bomber Regiment (Tyazholy Bombardirovochnyy Avia Polk‚ÄîTBAP), based at Boryspil was equipped with Pe-8s, but was not ready for combat.Gordon (2008), p. 395 Two of its nine Pe-8s were destroyed by German air strikes shortly after the war began, before the Pe-8s were withdrawn out of reach of German bombers to Kazan. Stalin ordered that the squadron be reformed into a regiment, and that it strike targets deep inside German territory. Theoretically, this tactic would boost Soviet morale by demonstrating the vulnerability of the enemy. The squadron was re- designated on 29 June as the 412th TBAP and began training for long-range missions. On or about 27 July it was again renamed, this time as the 432nd TBAP. On the evening of 10 August, eight M-40-engined Pe-8s of the 432nd TBAP, accompanied by Yermolaev Yer-2s of the 420th Long-Range Bomber Aviation Regiment (DBAP), attempted to bomb Berlin from Pushkino Airfield near Leningrad. One heavily loaded Pe-8 crashed immediately upon take off, after it lost an engine. Only four managed to reach Berlin, or its outskirts, and of those, only two returned to their base. The others landed elsewhere or crash- landed in Finland and Estonia. The aircraft of the commander of the 81st Long- Range Bomber Division, Combrig Mikhail Vodopianov, to which both regiments belonged, was attacked mistakenly by Polikarpov I-16s from Soviet Naval Aviation over the Baltic Sea and lost an engine; later, before he could reach Berlin, German flak punctured a fuel tank. He crash-landed his aircraft in southern Estonia. Five more Pe-8s were lost during the operation, largely due to the unreliability of the M-40s. Seven Pe-8s were lost during the month of August alone, rendering the regiment ineffective. During this period, the surviving aircraft were re-equipped with AM-35As, which gave them a shorter range, but a more reliable engine.Gordon (2008), p. 396 By 1 October 1941, the regiment mustered fourteen Pe-8s after having been replenished by new aircraft from the factory. It spent the rest of the year conducting night raids on Berlin, K√∂nigsberg, Danzig and as well as German-occupied cities in the Soviet Union. The regiment was re-designated as the 746th Separate Long-Range Aviation Regiment (‚ÄîOAPDD) on 3 December. No aircraft were reported on hand two days later after this designation, but eleven were on strength on 18 March 1942. During the winter of 1941‚Äì42, the regiment was assigned the destruction of a railroad bridge over the Volga River, near Kalinin. In April 1942, one aircraft flew diplomatic personnel and mail on a non-stop flight from Moscow to Great Britain. This was a test run for a flight carrying Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov and his delegation from Moscow to London and then to Washington, D.C. and back, for negotiations to open a second front against Nazi Germany (19 May‚Äì13 June 1942). The flight crossed German-controlled airspace on the return trip without incident.Air International, p. 101 From August 1941 to May 1942, the regiment flew 226 sorties and dropped of bombs. In the course of these missions, they lost 14 bombers, five in combat, and the rest from engine malfunction. The regiment received 17 Pe-8s as replacements. Sixteen aircraft were on hand on 1 May 1942, but the number had increased only to seventeen two months later; the regiment was losing aircraft almost as fast as they were being replaced. The 890th Long-Range Aviation Regiment (‚ÄîAPDD) was formed on 15 June 1942 and both regiments were used to bomb German-held transportation centers of, among others, Orel, Bryansk, Kursk and Poltava. The pace of activity increased and the regiments flew as many missions in August as they had in the first ten months of the war.Gordon (2008), p. 397 By the eve of the Soviet counterattack at Stalingrad, Operation Uranus, on 8 November the regiments had fourteen Pe-8s on hand. Under the command of the 45th Long- Range Bomber Aviation Division (‚ÄîDBAD), they did not participate in the Stalingrad air attacks. In 1943, from the division's primary airfield at Kratovo, southeast of Moscow, the regiments bombed transportation centers, airfields and troop concentrations. The railroad yard at Gomel was a favorite target and the regiment dropped approximately of bombs there between February and September 1943. It is not clear if these sorties were made by Pe-8s alone or in combination with other aircraft. In addition, the regiment dropped the first FAB-5000 bomb on K√∂nigsberg in April 1943, continuing the pin-prick attacks against targets deep in the German rear. In May 1943, efforts shifted to disrupt the German concentration of forces for the Battle of Kursk. In one sortie, the 109 bombers of the 45th DBAD struck the rail junction at Orsha during the evening of 4 May, most of which were not Pe-8s; the German High Command reported the destruction of 300 rail wagons and three ammunition trains.Bergstrom, p. 18 By 1 July, the regiment had 18 Pe-8s for deployment during the early phase of the Battle of Kursk. The long-range aviation units continued to attack targets in the German rear areas at night, supporting the Soviet ground offensive in the Orel Bulge, called Operation Kutuzov, that began on 12 July. The Germans had transferred the nightfighters of the Fourth Group of the 5th Night Fighter Wing (IV./Nachtjagdgeschwader 5), flying a mix of Junkers Ju 88 and Dornier Do 217 aircraft, to counter the Soviet raids near the Orel area. Initially, the night fighters were ineffective against the Soviet raids, until the deployment of their ground radar \\"eyes\\". Once the Germans had use of their radar, after the night of 17‚Äì18 July, Soviet losses increased sharply. Although the Germans flew only fourteen sorties that night, they claimed eight kills (of course, throughout the war, night or day, the number of kills claimed was inevitably significantly higher than the actual number shot down, regardless of nationality or aircraft type). On the night of 20‚Äì21 July, Captain (Hauptmann) Heinrich Prinz zu Sayn-Wittgenstein, commander of IV./NJG 5,Bergstrom, p. 111 claimed to have shot down three himself. The exhaust plume of the ASh-82 engine may have been a contributing factor; the engines lacked flame dampening exhausts, making their plume visible from a distance. Despite its losses, the 746th was re-designated as the 25th Long- Range Guards Aviation Regiment (GAPDD) on 18 September 1943 in recognition of its achievements. Removal from combat The loss of Pe-8s to all causes‚Äîmechanical, combat, friendly fire‚Äîhad steadily increased from one aircraft per 103 flights in 1942 to one per 46 sorties in 1944.Gordon (2008), p. 398 Despite the losses, production kept pace with need. The number of aircraft belonging to the 45th DBAD continued to rise; 20 were on hand on 1 January 1944 and 30 on 1 June. The Pe-8s flew 276 sorties in 1944 against such targets as Helsinki, Tallinn and Pskov. Aviation historian Yefim Gordon maintains that the Pe-8 flew its last mission on the night of 1‚Äì2 August 1944, but the Statistical Digest of the VVS contradicts this claim, showing 31 Pe-8s assigned to 45th DBAD on 1 January 1945 and 32 on hand on 10 May 1945. However, during this period the 45th DBAD only had three regiments, none of which used the Pe-8 as their primary aircraft, so while the 45th DBAD may have had Pe-8s, these may not have been in use as the primary combat aircraft. The 890th began to fly Lend-Lease B-25 Mitchells in the spring of 1944 and was itself re-designated as the 890th Bomber Aviation Regiment on 26 December 1944. The 362nd APDD was formed in early 1944 with four Pe-8s received from the other two regiments, but these were returned in the spring of 1944, when the regiment began to convert to the Lend-Lease Mitchells. Post-war use After the war, the Pe-8 was used extensively as a testbed for trials involving Soviet derivatives of the German V-1 flying bomb and it was designated as the Pe-8LL for prototype piston engine trials. It was also used as a mother ship for the experimental rocket-engined Bisnovat 5 in 1948‚Äì49. Aeroflot received several of the surviving Pe-8s for polar exploration. Their military equipment removed, they had additional fuel tanks installed, were painted orange, and had their engines upgraded to either ASh-82FNs or Shvetsov ASh-73s. One landed at the North Pole in 1954 and others helped to monitor the drift ice stations NP-2, NP-3 and NP-4 during the late 1950s.

(development name ANT-4) was a Soviet bomber aircraft, an angular monoplane that served as the backbone of the Soviet bomber force for many years, and was the first large all-metal aircraft built in the Soviet Union. Design and development In 1924, the Soviet Air Force instructed TsAGI, (–¶–µ–Ω—Ç—Ä–∞ÃÅ–ª—å–Ω—ã–π –∞—ç—Ä–æ–≥–∏–¥—Ä–æ–¥–∏–Ω–∞–º–∏ÃÅ—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π –∏–Ω—Å—Ç–∏—Ç—ÉÃÅ—Ç (–¶–ê–ì–ò) ‚Äì Tsentralniy Aerogidrodinamicheskiy Institut or Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute) to design a heavy-bomber. TsAGI gave the task to the division led by Andrei Tupolev.Gunston 1995, p.381. Tupolev's team designed a twin-engined all-metal monoplane with a corrugated Duralumin skin ‚Äî based on Tupolev's earlier work utilizing the all-metal aircraft design techniques first pioneered by Hugo Junkers in 1918 ‚Äî powered by two Napier Lion engines, and named the ANT-4.Duffy and Kandalov 1996, p.36. The first prototype was built during 1925 on the second floor of Tupolev's factory in Moscow, it being necessary to knock down a wall to allow the aircraft to be taken out of the building in pieces. After reassembly at Moscow's Khodynka Aerodrome, it was flown on 26 November 1925.Duffy and Kandalov 1996, p.36-7. Testing was successful, and it was decided to put the ANT-4 into production as the TB-1. Production was delayed, however, by shortages of aluminium, and by the need to find a replacement for the expensive imported Lion engines, the BMW VI (and later the Soviet licence- built version, the Mikulin M-17). Production eventually started at the ex- Junkers factory at Fili, Moscow in 1929, 216 following the two prototypes, production continuing until 1932.Gunston 1995, pp.381‚Äì383.Duffy and Kandalov 1996, p.222. It was produced in both wheel- and float-gear variants (a total of 66 ANT-4 seaplanes built). Operational history Strana Sovyetov during the flight from Moscow to New York, 1929 The first production aircraft was completed as an unarmed civil aircraft, named Strana Sovyetov (Land of the Soviets) for a propaganda flight from Moscow to New York, taking an eastward course via Siberia, reaching its destination on 3 November 1929, flying 21,242 km (13,194 mi) in 137 flying hours.Duffy and Kandalov 1996, p.38. The TB-1 became the Soviet Air Forces' first standard heavy bomber, also being fitted with floats for use as a torpedo bomber (TB-1P), and for aerial survey operations. Zveno-1: Tupolev TB-1 and two Tupolev I-4 It was also widely used for experimental purposes, being the first mothership used in the Zveno Parasite aircraft project, carrying two I-4 fighters over the aircraft's wings.Gunston 1995, p.383. The TB-1 was replaced as a heavy bomber by the similar, but much larger, four-engined Tupolev TB-3, with many aircraft being converted to civil freighters (designated G-1) for use by Aeroflot and Aviaarktika, Aeroflot's polar division. One Avia Arktika ANT-4, flown by Anatoly Liapidevsky, played a key role in the rescue of the crew of the steamship Chelyuskin, which sank on 12 February 1934 after being trapped in ice near the Bering Strait. Liapidevsky was awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union. G-1s continued in use with Avia Arktika until 1948.Duffy and Kandalov 1996, p.39. Variants * TB-1 : Twin-engined heavy bomber aircraft.

It was the world's first cantilever wing four-engine heavy bomber. Despite obsolescence and being officially withdrawn from service in 1939, the TB-3 performed bomber and transport duties throughout much of World War II. The TB-3 also saw combat as a Zveno project fighter mothership and as a light tank transport. Development In 1925, the Soviet Air Force approached TsAGI with a requirement for a heavy bomber with total engine output of 2,000 PS (1,970 hp) and either wheeled or float landing gear. Tupolev OKB started design work in 1926 with the government operational requirements finalized in 1929.Gunston 1995, pp. 384‚Äì385. The Tupolev TB-1 was taken as the basis for the design and the aircraft was initially powered by Curtiss V-1570 \\"Conqueror\\" engines generating 600 PS (590 hp) each,Duffy and Kandalov 1996, p.42. with the intent of switching to Mikulin M-17s (modified BMW VIs) in production.Vanags- Baginskis 1988, p.5. The mock-up was approved on 21 March 1930 and the first prototype was completed on 31 October 1930. The aircraft flew on 22 December 1930 with Mikhail Gromov at the controls and with ski landing gear. Despite almost crashing owing to vibration causing the throttles to close, the test flight was a success. On 20 February 1931, the Soviet Air Force approved mass production of the ANT-6 with M-17 engines.Gunston 1995, p.385. The prototype was refitted with BMW VIz 500 engines of 730 PS (720 hp) each, larger radiators, and wooden fixed-pitch propellers of TsAGI design. Single-wheel landing gear was deemed too weak and was replaced by tandem bogies with tires. The first pre-production TB-3 4M-17 flew on 4 January 1932 with A. B. Yumashev and I. F. Petrov at the controls. Unexpectedly, subsequent mass-produced aircraft were found to be 10‚Äì12% heavier than the prototype, which significantly hampered performance. The discrepancy was discovered to be due to high positive tolerances on raw materials which resulted in steel sheetmetal, pipes, and wires being much thicker than on the carefully constructed prototypes. The aircraft were also more crudely painted with a thick layer of camouflage and lacquer.Duffy and Kandalov 1996, p.43. The factories asked the workers for suggestions on reducing the weight, paying 100 roubles for each removed from the aircraft. In combination with OKB efforts, this resulted in weight savings of almost . Despite this, production aircraft could differ from each other by as much as several hundred kilograms.Gunston 1995, p.386. In 1933, a single TB-3 4M-17F was streamlined with removal of turrets and bomb shackles, covering of all openings, and fitting of wheel spats. This resulted in only a 4.5% increase in top speed and a similar increase in the range. Tupolev concluded that streamlining was minimally beneficial for large and slow aircraft. To study the effect of corrugated skin, in January‚ÄìFebruary 1935 a single TB-3 4AM-34R had the corrugations incrementally covered with fabric. This resulted in a 5.5% gain in top speed and a 27.5% increase in the ceiling. The same aircraft demonstrated a significant increase in climb rate when fitted with experimental four-blade propellers.Vanags-Baginskis 1988, p.12. ;Record flightsDuffy and Kandalov 1996, p.211. * TB-3 4M-34R set a flight endurance record of 18 hours and 30 minutes. * TB-3 4AM-34FRN with A.

The frame was composed of V-section beams covered with non-stressed corrugated skin ranging from to in thickness. The corrugations were deep and apart. The cantilever wing was supported by four tube-section spars. In 1934, thanks to the development of stronger steel alloys, the wingspan was increased from with a concurrent wing area increase from . Any part of the aircraft could be walked on in soft shoes without damaging the skin, and the leading edges of the wings swung down to form walkways for engine maintenance. Controls were cable- actuated with a variable-incidence tailplane and a trim compensation system in case of engine failures on one side. Fixed main landing gear was not fitted with brakes. The fuel tanks did not have fire or leak protection, although the engines had an internal fire-extinguishing system. The M-17 engines were tuned to provide a maximum theoretical range of without spark plug or carburetor fouling. Defensive armament consisted of light machine guns in five turrets ‚Äî one in the nose, two on top of mid-fuselage, and one retractable \\"dustbin\\" under each wing between the engine nacelles. Later variants moved one of the top fuselage turrets aft of the tail fin. Operational history Paratroopers boarding TB-3 transport TB-3 carrying a T-27 tankette Glavsevmorput (GUSMP) The TB-3 was used operationally during the Battle of Khalkhin Gol against Japan and in the Winter War with Finland. Although it was officially withdrawn from service in 1939, at the start of the Great Patriotic War on 22 June 1941, the Soviet Air Force had 516 operational TB-3s, with an additional 25 operated by the Soviet Navy. Stationed far from the USSR's western border, the –¢B-3s avoided catastrophic losses during the first German air strikes, after which TB-3s from 3rd TBAP (Heavy Bomber Regiment) began flying night bombing missions on 23 June. A shortage of combat-ready aircraft also required daytime use of TB-3s without fighter escort and in this role the bombers, operating at low-to-medium altitudes, suffered heavy losses to enemy fighters and ground fire. By August 1941, TB-3s made up 25% of the Soviet bomber force and, operated by elite air force crews, were flying up to three combat missions per night. The aircraft participated in all major battles through 1943, including the first Battle of Smolensk, the Battle of Moscow, the Battle of Stalingrad, the Siege of Leningrad, and the Battle of Kursk. On 1 July 1945, 18th Air Army still had ten TB-3s on the active roster. The TB-3 served extensively as a cargo and paratroop transport, carrying up to 35 soldiers in the latter role. In the first five months of the war, the aircraft transported 2,797 tons of cargo and 2,300 personnel. The TB-3 was also used in several special projects as a fighter mothership in the Zveno project and for delivering light T-27, T-37, and T-38 tanks. On 1 August 1941, a pair of TB-3s in Zveno-SPB configuration, each with two Polikarpov I-16 fighters carrying a pair of bombs, destroyed an oil depot with no losses in the port of Constan»õa, Romania. On 11 and 13 August 1941, Zveno-SPB successfully damaged the King Carol I Bridge over the Danube in Romania. Zveno operations ended in the autumn of 1942 due to high vulnerability of the motherships. In recognition of the role TB-3 played during the war, three aircraft were included in the first post-war air parade on 18 June 1945.

The capital city of Nueva Esparta, La Asunci√≥n, is located on the island. Since the beginning of the crisis in Venezuela, the primary industry of tourism has declined 90% between 2010 and 2020. The island is currently affected by organized crime and is recognized as an international hub for the illegal drug trade. History 1840 map by Agust√≠n Codazzi  Age of Exploration  Christopher Columbus was the first European to arrive on Margarita Island in 1498. The local natives were the Guaiqueries people. The coast of the island was abundant in pearls, which represented almost a third of all New World tribute to the Spanish Crown. Margarita Island was fortified against the increasing threat of pirate attacks, and some fortifications remain today. It was the center of Spanish colonial Margarita Province, established in 1525. In 1561, the island was seized by Lope de Aguirre, a notoriously violent and rebellious conquistador. Around 1675, the island was captured again, this time by Red Legs Greaves, a pirate known for his humanity and morality. He captured a fleet of Spanish ships off port, before turning the guns on the forts which he stormed and claimed a large booty of pearls and gold. The story of Greaves' capture of the island does not appear in historical Spanish records and may be fictional. Construction of the fort Santa Rosa was ordered by the governor, Juan Mu√±oz de Gadea, after the French buccaneer Marquis de Maintenon attacked the island in early 1676.  Independence era  The island gained independence from the Spanish in 1814 after the collapse of the First Republic of Venezuela. It became the first permanently free territory in Venezuela. In the same year, Luisa C√°ceres de Arismendi was detained in a dungeon of the Fortress of Santa Rosa on the island in an attempt to put pressure on her husband Juan Bautista Arismendi, who was fighting for independence. Her detention lasted for over three years. Sim√≥n Bol√≠var was confirmed as Commander-in-Chief of the Second Republic of Venezuela on the island in 1816. From there he started a nine-year campaign to free Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia from the Spanish Crown.  Contemporary history  In modern times, Margarita Island was primarily a tourist destination. The island's status as a duty-free port was established in 1974 to promote commercial and tourism industries, with lower-priced imports driving increased visitors and the development of hotels. The island was the host venue for the Caribbean Series in 2010 and 2014. In light of the economic, social and political crisis in Venezuela, tourism in Margarita Island has significantly declined. Between 2010 and 2020, tourism rates dropped 90% on the island and many of the hotels were left abandoned. Geography Nueva Esparta map Located in the Caribbean Sea between latitudes 10¬∞52'N and 11¬∞11'N and longitudes 63¬∞48'W and 64¬∞23'W, the island, along with the islands of Coche and Cubagua, comprises the state of Nueva Esparta. The island is split into two peninsulas joined by an long isthmus and covers an area of . It is long and measures roughly at its widest. The climate is sunny and dry, with average temperatures ranging from to . Most of the island's 420,000 residents live in the more developed eastern part of the island, which includes the large cities of Porlamar and Pampatar along with the state capital of La Asunci√≥n. The island can be reached by direct flights from Caracas or ferries from Puerto La Cruz, Cuman√°, and La Guaira. There are no international flights to the island at present. Las Tetas de Mar√≠a Guevara (twin mountains) The Macanao peninsula to the west has a central mountain range in the east-west direction. The highest altitude is at Pico de Macanao. Several smaller ranges derive from this axis following a north-south orientation with deep valleys between them. The most notable of these valleys is San Francisco in the north-central part of the peninsula. The Paraguachoa peninsula to the East is formed by a mountain range in the north-south direction from Porlamar to Cabo Negro. The highest peaks are San Juan or Cerro Grande at and El Copey . The peninsulas are connected by the La Restinga isthmus, on which the La Restinga lagoon is located. There are also two breast-shaped hills known as Tetas de Maria Guevara on the isthmus.  Beaches  Playa El Agua Margarita Hilton at Puerto Cruz beachThere are at least 70 beaches on the island, which has a coastline. Popular beaches include Playa El Yaque, Playa Parguito, Playa Caribe, Playa Punta Arenas, Playa El Agua and Playa Puerto Cruz. Terrain Macanao peninsula consists of mountainous spine of the central west-east, with several culminations, including Macanao Peak, which is the highest, with an altitude of 760 meters above sea level stands. This axial region several side brackets oriented north-south off, including deep valleys are dissected; the most important is San Francisco in the north central of Margarita. The central massif is surrounded by foothills forming a more or less continuous, narrow strip, which reaches almost to the coast north and south of the peninsula .Physical Characteristics of Isla Margarita (spanish) Isla Margarita eastern is formed by a mountain range which runs roughly north-south, from northern Porlamar to Cabo Negro; north from the town of El Espinal, the massif rises steeply to the culminations of San Juan and Copey hills, at heights of 960 and 890 m, respectively. The hills are Matasite and Guayamur√≠ Los Andes foothills. To the north stands the Tragaplata hill.

Rainfall is common in the winter months and rainy season that begins July-October (although the rain is usually quite rare). Being located in the Caribbean Sea near the Earth's equator, solar rays fall perpendicularly on the island and therefore it is advisable to always use some sort of sunscreen when visiting its beaches. MunicipalitiesCities La Asunci√≥n is the capital of the Federal State of Nueva Esparta with a population of around 28,500. It is the seat of the regional government. The city is overlooked by the Santa Rosa Castle of La Asunci√≥n Beach near Pampatar The urban area of Pampatar has a population of around 50,000. A number of the island's larger shopping malls are located in the city, namely Sambil Margarita, Rattan Depot, Centro Comercial La Vela, Centro Comercial Costa Azul, Centro Comercial AB (Avenida Bolivar) and La Redoma. The Royal Fortress of San Carlos Borromeo, constructed in the late 17th century, is located in Pampatar. The city also has several beaches. The largest city on Margarita Island is Porlamar. The population can reach 125,000 in the high season, while in the low season, the population is about 85,000. Two beaches are located within the city. The island's major airport, Santiago Marino Caribbean International Airport, is located near Porlamar. Juan Griego is a city on the northern side of Isla Margarita, and is the most northern port in Venezuela. It has a population of 28,256 inhabitants (as per census of 2001) and is the capital of the Marcano municipality of the Nueva Esparta state. Its Gothic-style church, constructed in 1850 by Fray Nicholas de Igualdad, is still, along with the lovely bay, the symbol of the city. The La Galera fortress, where in the early 1820s a fierce battle for independence was fought, is located near the city centre. In 1973, the island become a free port and the city once again become the second city of commercial importance after Porlamar. Population A typical house in San Juan Bautista View of Margarita island at night The demonym for islanders is Margarite√±os/as and Neoespartanos/as. Ethnic minority populations of some significance include descendants of enslaved West African (brought by the Spaniards), Lebanese, Syrian, Spanish, Italian, German, French, Dutch, Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, Portuguese, Argentine, Chilean, Uruguayan, Colombian, and Chinese. Immigrants from mainland Venezuela are colloquially called navegaos by islanders. A little less than 25% of the Neoespartanian population live in Porlamar. Margarita's population is just under 440,000, although this tends to fluctuate during holiday periods and the festive season. Religion Front facade of La Asunci√≥n Cathedral The predominant religion is Roman Catholicism. Other Christian denominations are also present. Of the churches that present in the Neospartan entity, among the most important are: Bas√≠lica de la Virgen del Valle (in the Valley of the Esp√≠ritu Santo), Cathedral of La Asunci√≥n, Iglesia San Juan Evangelista (Juangriego), Iglesia parroquial de San Juan (San Juan Bautista), Iglesia de San Nicol√°s de Bari (Porlamar), of the San Jos√© de Paraguachi and other churches and chapels minor located in populations of Santa Ana, Punta de Piedras, Porlamar, Pampatar and virtually all the towns of the island. There are also small populations of Jews and Muslims. Evangelical Christian churches have had a significant growth in recent years demonstrating their presence and impact in the population of the island. One of the fastest-growing is the Centro Cristiano Casa de Alabanza (CCCA), present in Porlamar, Juan Griego, La Asunci√≥n and Tubores Municipality. The patron saint of eastern Venezuela is the Virgen del Valle and in the population El Valle del Esp√≠ritu Santo is the Bas√≠lica Menor de Nuestra Se√±ora del Valle, which approaching Margarita, Coche and Cubagua Islanders visit to honor her on her feast day. Natural heritage El Reino Musip√°n amusement park Las Tetas de Mar√≠a Guevara The Las Tetas de Maria Guevara (\\"Maria Guevara's breasts\\"), located in a coastal plain in the south of the 1,670 hectare Laguna de La Restinga National Park, are two small twin hills with a height of . The vegetation around the hills is desert, with cacti, prickly pears, yaks, guamaches. The fauna is diverse, including desert lizards, rabbits, rattlesnakes and coral. The legend told by the inhabitants of the island goes that the name Mar√≠a Guevara comes from a white young girl who was heavily involved in the War of Independence and that upon her death, the hills rose on her grave. Another Margaritan myth says the source of the name also comes from the same woman, but that she was from Cuman√° and came to the island to lead a group of men in fishing activities. As she had small breasts, by way of derision whenever they sighted the hills said, \\"there are the lady's tits\\" and the name was created. The area was declared a national park on February 27, 1974.  Crime = Drug trafficking  Multiple international intelligence organizations have focused their investigations on Isla Margarita as being a major center of organized crime. According to the CIA World Factbook, Margarita Island is the location of significant narcotics-related money-laundering activity. Aerial drug shipments from Colombia and Venezuela often utilize the island for exportation. Joaqu√≠n \\"El Chapo\\" Guzm√°n was known to frequently visit the island. According to Alex Cifuentes, the self-described \\"right-hand, left-hand man\\" of Guzm√°n, Guzm√°n would visit Isla Margarita every two to three months.  Piracy  Since 1998, there have been about ten pirate attacks on or near Margarita Island. Venezuela is now listed as a dangerous region for pirate attacks and, in many regions, including between Margarita and Sucre, sailors should not anchor and yachts should sail in company.  Terrorism  Isla Margarita has been described as the largest center of terrorism in the Americas. Since the early 2000s, the United States government has seen links to Islamic terrorism on Isla Margarita. The United States Southern Command has recognized Isla Margarita as one of the most important locations for the terrorist group Hezbollah. Ghazi Atef Salameh Nassereddine, who was sanctioned by the United States Department of the Treasury for funding Hezbollah and who is a close friend of Tareck El Aissami, established a Hezbollah militant camp on the island with his brother Oday Nassereddine. Hezbollah also receives funds from operations on the island which include local businesses, financial institutions and drug trafficking groups. Multiple Islamic centers funded through dubious means have been created in Porlamar which began to indoctrinate the island's citizens to support certain causes. Photographs have also been taken of Islamic militant training in the remote area of Macanao.  Violent crime  Since 2010, there have been numerous instances of tourist murders. On 27 August 2010 an Italian tourist, Emiliano Astore, was murdered on his boat anchored off Margarita Island in an apparent robbery. Two police officers and a civilian were arrested. A third officer was implicated in the \\"exploitation of objects\\" from the crime. On 18 July 2011, 28-year-old Briton Tom Ossel was killed resisting seven armed robbers who had tricked their way into the backpackers hotel before they took the guests hostage and raiding rooms for valuables. On 29 March 2011, French tourist Yves Le Bras was murdered in a robbery at the Laguna Mar hotel while he and his wife dined at the Guacuco restaurant. In March 2011, Belgian tourist Bonne Philippe was murdered while eating in a fast food outlet in Playa El Agua, Margarita. On 20 January 2012, about 30 or 35 Brazilian tourists were robbed in their hotel in Antolin del Campo, Margarita, by a gang of between 13 and 15 armed robbers. On 3 September 2013, a Dutch sailor was killed on his yacht while resisting armed robbers attempting to board his boat. Starting in October 2011, the government installed equipment that requires everyone visiting Margarita Island to electronically register their fingerprints and a picture when entering Margarita Island. The US government has not issued any warnings of violent crime on Margarita Island, but there is a general warning for all of Venezuela. The UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office warns that street crime in mainland Venezuela is high, and that armed muggings and 'express kidnappings' ‚Äì opportunistic abductions to extort money from someone ‚Äì are regular occurrences.gov.uk Panorama of Margarita Island See also *Cariaco Basin ReferencesExternal links * *Nuevaesparta.gob.ve: Official Isla de Margarita government website Category:Venezuelan islands of the Leeward Antilles Category:Geography of Nueva Esparta Category:Colonial Venezuela ","title":"Margarita Island"},{"id":"1493647","text":"Rhaponticum carthamoides, also known as Maral root or Rhaponticum, is an herbaceous perennial plant from the family AsteraceaeSysTax - detailed information on Rhaponticum carthamoides (Willd.)

The town is situated at the feet of the Ysterberg and is surrounded by the Witfonteinrand and Boshofberg with the majestic Kransberg in the background. The name Thabazimbi means mountain of iron because of the large iron ore reef that was discovered in 1919 by J.H. Williams. The mine boasts one of the largest mining shafts in Africa. More than 2 million tons of ore are mined every year and hauled by train to Mittal's iron and steel works. The railway line from Rustenburg reached the area in the 1930s and full scale iron and steel production began. The town was proclaimed in 1953. Kumba Iron Ore, previously Kumba Resources, is now the principal operator of the iron ore mine. Iron ore mining in Thabazimbi The Marakele National Park about 20 km north-east of the town and situated in the heart of Waterberg Mountains characterised by contrasting mountain landscapes, hills and valleys, as well a variety of wildlife. Marakele National Park is also the home of some of the Tuli Elephants that were caught up in controversy in 1999 involving animal cruelty in South Africa. In the post-apartheid era, the town made headlines in 2003 as the site of Kamp Staaldraad, the Springboks' infamous training camp prior to the Rugby World Cup.

The Tu-2 was tailored to meet a requirement for a high-speed bomber or dive-bomber, with a large internal bombload, and speed similar to that of a single-seat fighter. Designed to challenge the German Junkers Ju 88, the Tu-2 proved comparable, and was produced in torpedo, interceptor, and reconnaissance versions. The Tu-2 was one of the outstanding combat aircraft of World War II and it played a key role in the Red Army's final offensives.Jackson 2003, p. 154. Design and development In 1937, Andrei Tupolev, along with many Soviet designers at the time, was arrested on trumped-up charges of activities against the State. Despite the actions of the Soviet government, he was considered important to the war effort and following his imprisonment, he was placed in charge of a team that was to design military aircraft. Designed as Samolyot (Russian: \\"aircraft\\") 103, the Tu-2 was based on earlier ANT-58, ANT-59 and ANT-60 light bomber prototypes. Essentially an upscaled and more powerful ANT-60 powered by AM-37 engines, the first prototype was completed at Factory N156, and made its first test flight on 29 January 1941, piloted by Mikhail Nukhtinov.Bishop 2002, p. 317 Mass production began in September 1941, at Omsk Aircraft Factory Number 166, with the first aircraft reaching combat units in March 1942. Modifications were made based on combat experience, and Plant Number 166 built a total of 80 aircraft. The AM-37 engine was abandoned to concentrate efforts on the AM-38F for the Il-2, which required Tupolev to redesign the aircraft for an available engine. Modifications of this bomber took ANT-58 through ANT-69 variants. A further 2527 aircraft were built at Kazan, with these modifications. Production ceased in 1951 after a total of some 3,000 aircraft were delivered to various Soviet Bloc air forces. Operational history Built from 1941 to 1948, the Tu-2 was the USSR's second most important twin- engine bomber (the first being the Pe-2). The design brought Andrei Tupolev back into favour after a period of detention. Crews were universally happy with their Tupolevs. Pilots could maneuver the aircraft like a fighter, it could survive heavy damage, and it was fast.Ethell 1995, p. 161. The first Soviet unit to be equipped with the Tu-2 was 132 BAP of 3 VA (Vozdushnaya Armiya, Air Army). The aircraft had its baptism of fire over Velikiye Luki. There, in November-December 1942, this Tupolev bomber flew 46 sorties. On February 11, 1943, 132 BAP was transferred to 17 VA to support the drive toward River Dnepr and it flew another 47 sorties - attacking airfields and rail junctions - until April 13, when the unit was removed from frontline. By that time only three Tu-2s were lost in action, while seven were damaged. Bergstrom 2019, p. 191. The Tu-2 remained in service in the USSR until 1950. Some surplus Tu-2s were provided to the Chinese People's Liberation Army Air Force for use in the Chinese Civil War. Some Chinese Tu-2s were shot down by United Nations airmen during the Korean War. In the 1958‚Äì1962 'counter-riot actions' in the 1959 Tibetan uprising in Qinghai-Tibet Plateau covering Qinghai, Tibet, southern Gansu, and western Sichuan, Chinese PLAAF Tu-2s took on the roles of ground-attack, reconnaissance and liaison. The Chinese Tu-2s were retired at the end of the 1970s. After World War II, the Tu-2 proved to be an ideal test aircraft for various powerplants, including the first generation of Soviet jet engines.

It was developed from the Bartini Stal-7 prototype airliner before the war. It was used to bomb Berlin from airbases in Estonia after Operation Barbarossa began in 1941. Production was terminated in August 1941 to allow the factory to concentrate on building higher-priority Ilyushin Il-2 ground-attack aircraft, but was restarted at the end of 1943 with new, fuel-efficient, Charomskiy ACh-30B aircraft Diesel engines. Although designed as a long-range medium bomber it was flown on tactical ground-attack missions during the Battle of Moscow with heavy losses. The survivors were flown, in ever dwindling numbers, until August 1943 when the last examples were transferred to schools. However, the resumption of production in 1943 allowed the aircraft to resume combat operations in April 1945. The Yer-2 remained in service with Long-Range Aviation until it was replaced by four-engined bombers such as the Tupolev Tu-4 at the end of the 1940s. Development Roberto Bartini had designed and built the Stal-7 airliner whilst he was the chief designer at the ZOK NII GVF ( ‚Äî \\"Factory for Special Constructions at the Scientific Test Institute for the Civil Air Fleet\\"). The performance of the Stal-7 was exceptional, particularly in respect to its payload: at gross overload weight over 56% of the total weight was payload.Gordon, p. 354 During flight trials with maximum all-up weight the prototype crashed on takeoff in early 1938, resulting in the arrest of Bartini and his imprisonment in a Siberian Gulag in February 1938.Gunston, p. 42 The Stal-7 lay unrepaired until Vladimir Yermolaev was appointed as chief designer at OKB-240 after Bartini's arrest, with the task of transforming the Stal-7 design into a long-range bomber, a task made easier since Bartini had reserved space for a bomb bay in the fuselage. After repair the Stal-7 carried on with the flight-test programme, including a record-breaking nonstop flight on 28 August 1939 when it flew Moscow‚ÄîSverdlovsk‚ÄîSevastopol‚ÄîMoscow; a distance of at an average speed of . Preliminary design of the DB-240 (‚Äî\\"long-range bomber\\"), as the bomber version was designated, was completed by the beginning of 1939 and the construction of two prototypes began the following July. The DB-240 retained little apart from the general layout of the Stal-7 as the structure was almost completely redesigned. The pilot's cockpit was offset to port to improve his downward view and the navigator/bomb aimer sat in the extensively glazed nose with a ShKAS machine gun, the radio operator sat below and to starboard of the pilot and the dorsal gunner in a partially retractable turret with one Berezin UBT machine gun. Another ShKAS was fitted in a ventral hatch. Up to of bombs could be carried in the bomb bay and two bombs could be carried externally. Up to of fuel could be carried. The DB-240 had been designed to use the experimental Klimov M-106 V12 engines, but the less-powerful Klimov M-105 engine had to be substituted because the M-106 was not available.Gordon, p. 355 The DB-240 prototype flew for the first time on 14 May 1940 and began its State acceptance tests on 27 September 1940. The weaker engines prevented the DB-240 from reaching its designed performance. It could only attain at instead of the expected at . Its defensive armament was deemed inadequate and other problems included an excessively long take-off run and engine defects. However, these did not offset its virtues of a heavy bomb load and long-range ( carrying of bombs). It was ordered into production at Factory No. 18, in Voronezh, as the Yermolayev Yer-2. Manufacture began in March 1941, with approximately 50 aircraft delivered by 22 June 1941. These aircraft were about slower than the prototype and their normal weight increased to . Production was terminated in August 1941 with only 128 built to allow the factory to concentrate on the higher-priority Ilyushin Il-2 ground-attack aircraft.Gordon, pp. 355‚Äì56 A Yer-2 was modified with experimental Mikulin AM-37 engines, a reinforced undercarriage, armored seats for the navigator and gunner, and 12.7 mm UBT machine guns in place of its original ShKAS weapons. It first flew in July 1941 and was able to reach at , but the range was reduced to ( carrying of bombs. One significant problem with this version was the excessive takeoff roll which hindered operations from grass airstrips.Gordon, p. 357 The engine was unreliable, however, and had cooling problems that the Mikulin OKB did not have the resources to resolve so it was cancelled in October when the factory was forced to evacuate from Moscow by the German advance. The Charomskiy M-40F Diesel engine was also evaluated in a Yer-2 in 1941. This engine, like all Diesels, offered a greatly reduced fuel consumption compared to a standard gasoline-powered engine, but at a great penalty in weight. These engines increased the gross takeoff weight to which required the undercarriage to be reinforced and the wing area increased to keep the same wing loading. The M-40F-powered aircraft reached a maximum speed of at . However, the M-40 was not yet ready for service use and the project was cancelled.Gordon, p. 358 The aircraft/engine combination did have enough potential that development work continued using the closely related, but more mature, Charomskiy ACh-30B Diesel engine. The cockpit was modified to accommodate two pilots side-by-side and the wing and tailplane areas were increased. The 12.7 mm UBT machine gun in the dorsal turret was replaced by a ShVAK cannon and the nose and ventral ShKAS machine guns were exchanged for 12.7 mm UBT machine guns. Up to of fuel could be carried. The Yer-2/ACh-30B was placed into production at Factory No. 39 in Irkutsk at the end of 1943 and the first production aircraft was submitted to its State acceptance trials the following month. Some excess aircraft were converted as Yer-2ON VIP transports. Operational history The Yer-2 was not in squadron service when Germany invaded on 22 June 1941, but the 420th and 421st Long-Range Bomber Regiments (‚ÄîDBAP) were formed shortly afterwards. However neither regiment flew any operational missions until later in the summer. On the evening of 10 August Yer-2s of the 420th DBAP, accompanied by Petlyakov Pe-8s of the 432nd DBAP, attempted to bomb Berlin from Pushkino Airfield near Leningrad. The airfield was too short to accommodate a fully loaded Yer-2, but three bombers did manage to take off regardless. Two managed to bomb Berlin, or its outskirts, but only one successfully returned; the other was shot down by 'friendly' Polikarpov I-16s when it reentered Soviet airspace and the third aircraft went missing. Three crews from the 420th DBAP bombed K√∂nigsberg during the nights of 28‚Äì29 and 30 August ‚Äì 1 September from Ramenskoye Airport, southeast of Moscow. On 1 October 1941 63 Yer-2s were in service, but only 34 were operational. The 420th DBAP had flown 154 sorties by the beginning of November (6 in August, 81 in September, 67 in October) and had lost 30 of its 40 aircraft. Over half of these (19) were due to non-combat losses. Losses were extremely high over the autumn and winter as they were inappropriately committed against German tactical frontline targets during the Battle of Moscow at low altitudes and only 12 were in service on 18 March 1942. On 4 August 1942 the 747th DBAP had only ten Yer-2s on hand and it was briefly committed during the Battle of Stalingrad. The survivors were flown, in ever dwindling numbers, until August 1943 when the last few aircraft were transferred to schools by the 2nd Guards DBAP and the 747th DBAP. The Yer-2 was placed back into production at the end of 1943, but none of the new bombers had been issued to combat units by 1 June 1944. However 42 were in service on 1 January 1945 and 101 on 10 May 1945 after the war ended. The first combat mission undertaken by Yer-2s after they returned to production was a raid on K√∂nigsberg on 7 April 1945 by the 327th and 329th Bomber Aviation Regiments (). It remained in service with Long-Range Aviation units until replaced by four-engined bombers like the Tupolev Tu-4 in the late 1940s.

Downtown Chicago, Illinois has some double-decked and a few triple-decked streets immediately north and south of the Main Branch and immediately east of the South Branch of the Chicago River. The most famous and longest of these is Wacker Drive, which replaced the South Water Street Market upon its 1926 completion. The resulting bi-level street has an upper-level riverfront boulevard, a lower-level roadway for commercial and through traffic, and a recreational walkway at water level. History The Michigan Avenue Bridge crossing the Chicago River. The multilevel configuration arose from geography and traffic patterns in the Loop. In most other parts of the rest of the city near the Chicago River, only major streets crossed the river. However, most downtown streets crossed the river, and all of these crossings were bascule bridges, which required height clearances at the approaches to and over the river. Clearances were further necessitated due to the presence of many existing railroad tracks along the river (as in the west bank of the south branch) and tracks that ended at the river (such as the tracks ending at Randolph Street). Thus, a clearance zone was created along the river at locations that contained many closely spaced crossings. Many double-decked or triple-decked streets were created because they fell within this clearance zone. This also created an anomaly not only in the layout and uses of streets, but also planning of buildings. Generally, the upper levels of the multi-level streets usually serve local traffic. The primary entrances of buildings are usually located on this level. The lower levels generally serve through-traffic and trucks serving businesses along the roads. This level houses the receiving/shipping entrances to the buildings on these streets. As a result, loading docks at street level are noticeably absent. The first raising occurred from 1855 to 1858, when streets and buildings were raised between four and seven feet above their former elevation, just a few feet above lake level, where they were constantly muddy. The higher elevation allowed for sewers and proper drainage. However, this did not produce any two-level streets; the first of those was Michigan Avenue in the late 1910s. When the Illinois Center development was built on the east side of downtown, a new upper level was built, making most streets in that area three levels. After about 1890, special interest groups, including recreational bicyclists, farmers delivering harvested crops to market, and motorists, began to mount support for concrete paving to replace the previously common dirt roads. Public road planning in Chicago began in 1910 when the Chicago Plan Commission was created to implement Daniel Burnham and Edward Bennett's plan. The double-decked portion of Wabash Avenue north of the Chicago River was built in 1930, in conjunction with the single-level Wabash Avenue Bridge. On January 3, 2005, the upper and lower levels were closed at Kinzie Street for reconstruction (in conjunction with the Trump Tower Chicago development) but have since been reopened. The city's famed Billy Goat Tavern, immortalized by John Belushi in a Saturday Night Live sketch as the Olympia Cafe, is located on the lower level of Michigan Avenue.

It was produced in small numbers, and most of them were destroyed during the opening stages of Operation Barbarossa. Design and development The Yak-2 was initially known as the Ya-22, in the Yakovlev OKB numbering sequence, before it was redesignated as the Yak-2 in 1941. It was of mixed construction with wooden wings and center fuselage, duralumin forward fuselage, and steel tube framing in the rear fuselage with a wooden upper decking and fabric skin. The cockpit was at the very tip of the nose, but the navigator/gunner was in a compartment behind the trailing edge of the wing. The prototype was unarmed and no bomb shackles were fitted. It also lacked a radio and navigational equipment. It was, however, the fastest multi-engined aircraft in the Soviet Union, able to reach at , not least because it lacked heavy military equipment.Gordon, p. 132 Stalin ordered it into production, as the BB-22 (, Blizhniy Bombardirovshchik‚Äî short-range bomber), on 15 March 1939 before it could be evaluated by the NII VVS (Naoochno-Issledovatel'skiy Institoot Voyenno-Vozdooshnykh Seel ‚Äì Air Force Scientific Test Institute).Gunston, p. 460 Their tests were conducted in the early summer and concluded that the engine cooling systems were inadequate, the brakes were troublesome and the fuel system unreliable. The task of converting the aircraft to a bomber was formidable and included redesigning the center fuselage to accommodate the gunner/navigator immediately aft of the pilot and provision of two ShKAS machine guns, one for the gunner and the other fixed in the nose. The rear decking of the fuselage was hinged to pivot down to allow the rear gunner to use his gun. Factory No. 1 produced the first pre-production BB-22 in December 1939, although it did not make its first flight until the following February. It was submitted for its service evaluation in March‚ÄìApril 1940 and proved to be a disappointment. Gross weight had increased despite the reduction in fuel from and the maximum speed had declined to at . The engine cooling system was still unsatisfactory and the undercarriage too weak. Longitudinal and lateral stability were also unsatisfactory which made it suitable only for well-trained pilots. The test programme report concluded that it was not combat-capable and reliable and that flights with a bomb load could be dangerous to the crew.Gordon, pp. 133‚Äì134 A remediation program was begun which replaced the single-wheel main landing gear with two-wheeled units and the fuselage upper decking was cut down. Around the same time Factory No. 1 ceased production and Factory No. 81 in Moscow continued to work on the aircraft. Aircraft built by Factory No. 81 were of better quality because the surface finish was better and the engine cowlings and doors were more closely fitted to minimize drag. These improvements increased the speed by . Development work continued and resulted in the Yak-4 when Klimov M-105 engines were fitted. A grand total of 201 Yak-2s were built before production was terminated in April 1941.Gordon, pp. 134‚Äì135 Aviation historian Bill Gunston reports that several prototype variants were built, including the R-12 reconnaissance aircraft which retained the original positioning of the crew, put three cameras in the fuselage and added a bomb bay for eight FAB-20 bombs behind the pilot. Another was the I-29 or BB-22IS escort fighter with restored fuel and two 20 ShVAK cannon underneath the fuselage.Gunston, pp. 460‚Äì461 But neither of these can be confirmed by other, post-Cold-War sources.Gordon, pp. 132‚Äì135 Russian aviation historian Yefim Gordon does mention a Yak-2KABB ground-attack variant which might have been confused with the I-29 because it had two ShKAS in the nose and two ShVAK cannon in a depressible ventral pack. Unfortunately no other details are available, although photos do exist. Another variant mentioned by Gordon was the BPB-22 (Blizhiy Pikeeruyushchiy Bombardirovshchik ‚Äî short-range dive bomber) prototype that was fitted with two M-105 engines, dive brakes and an automatic dive entry/exit control system. It was first flown at the end of October 1940 although it crashed during the test programme when fuel unexpectedly cut out, but not before it was flown to a maximum speed of . Operational history When the Germans invaded the Soviet Union on 22 Jun 1941, 73 Yak-2s were in service, mostly with the 316th Reconnaissance Regiment in the Kiev Military District.

The town was established in 1854. Much of the farming in the area is with Merino sheep.  Tourist attractions  The Fountain, a powerful spring in town, releases about 205,000 litres of water per day. A footpath leads up to Trappieskop which offers panoramic views of the area. Hanover claims to be the country's most central place. It is equidistant from Cape Town and Johannesburg, centrally positioned between Cape Town and Durban as well as Port Elizabeth and Upington and it is the hub of an arc formed by Richmond, Middelburg and Colesberg. Historic figures were at the centre of life here, people like Olive Schreiner, author and women's rights champion, and the tempestuous Rev. Thomas Francois Burgers. Among its residents were the wealthy and eccentric. The town's chief constable was the grandson of Lord Charles Somerset, the magistrate's clerk a son of Charles John Vaughan, Dean of Llandaff, well-known churchman and devotional writer of his day, and the local doctor was the son of a former Solicitor-General of Jamaica. Well-known people of today hailing from Hanover includes Zwelinzima Vavi, the General Secretary of the Congress of South African Trade Unions. The country's first observatory once stood proud at the top of Trappieskop, but it has been moved and is now part of the observatory at Sutherland. Today the busy Karoo N 1 route cuts through the veld between the town and its cemetery. But during the last century all roads converged in Hanover and all travellers passed through the town. It was on an important stop for stage coaches carrying passengers to the Diamond Fields, and the Free State mail was carried through by post cart. Daily life bubbled with people ever on the move. But then in 1884, the advent of the railway deprived the town of much of its through traffic and its character slowly changed.  Link with Olive Schreiner  South African author and women's rights pioneer, Olive Schreiner, and husband Cron lived in Hanover from 1900 to 1907 in a typical small iron-roofed Karoo cottage with a \\"stoep\\". Schreiner House, on the corner of Grace and New street. Olive was very happy in Hanover where the Karoo air relieved her asthma. She wrote to friends saying, ‚Äòthis is the prettiest village I have ever seen'.  History =Early history Farmers moved gradually northwards and settled in this area in the 18th century. One of the early farms was Petrusvallei which in time became Hanover. The farm was originally granted to W. L. Pretorius in November 1841, but things did not go all that well with him and by February the following year he sold to Jan J. Smook. Frederick von Malditz later acquired the property and later still Petrus J. Botha, who sold it to Gert Johannes Wilhelm Gouws, the grandson of Sterren Gauche, a German who had come to Africa in search of his fortune. Petrusvallei was part of an outlying district of Graaff-Reinet and simply known as Bo-Zeekoeirivier (Upper Hippopotamus River). Farmers had to undertake long and arduous journeys to Graaff-Reinet for church, communion or nagmaal services, marriages and baptisms. But in time they felt the need for a religious, administrative and educational centre of their own, so they petitioned the Government for a town. On 17 July 1854, a six-man committee bought the farm for the sum of 33 333 Rixdollars. Their intention was to start a settlement and church farm. Gouws was retained as manager and J. J. Swart was in charge of finances. Survey work started almost immediately, and early in 1856 forty plots were sold. Soon a town mushroomed at the foot of a cluster of hills near a strong natural spring called The Fountain. It delivered over 200,000 litres of fresh water a day, and still does. By 13 October 1856, the affairs of this fledgling town were placed in the hands of a church council. At Gous's request it was agreed to name the village Hanover as his grandfather had come from that city in Germany. A municipality was established and P. Watermeyer elected mayor. He also served the town as Member of Parliament until 1888. District boundaries were firmly established by January 1859, the same year the first church, a typical tiny cruciform thatched-roofed building, was completed. When the first erven were sold, prospective residents were instructed to build directly on and parallel to the edge of the road with gardens at the back. In later years when verandahs came into fashion, these structures were allowed to encroach on the pavement. For this privilege home- owners paid a special tax of one shilling a year. They still pay for the privilege, but in 1994 the fee was raised to R10. The irrigation furrows, or leivoortjies, were built from The Fountain to take water to village vegetable gardens. The system started working in 1870, and has never changed, water flowing in the furrows day and night. All the original plots still get two irrigation turns a week, strictly according to the distribution chart drawn up in 1870. Hanover was declared a magisterial district on 13 November 1876, and Charles Richard Beere was appointed magistrate. A man of foresight, Beere insisted residents plant trees so their descendants would have shade. With the help of prisoners he built an easy-to-climb, stepped footpath to the summit of the hill now called Trappieskop. Beere wanted visitors to share the superb views from its summit. He loved the Karoo and could often be found on the summit of Trappieskop watching the sun rise or set. When he died in 1881, a stone pyramid was erected on its summit to his memory and to honour his contribution to the development of the town. Hanover grew rapidly. By 1881 a jail was built, but a courthouse only came in 1897. The town had a post and telegraph office, a bank, several general dealers, a hotel and a school. Its list of tradesmen included a mason, a farrier and groom, painter, miller, dam builder, brick maker, scab inspector, carpenter, wagon maker, butcher, a post rider and carriers to the railway station 18 km away. The original farmstead is today a national monument. It houses a small cultural history museum, and on display are old bottles, clothes, glassware, kitchen utensils and implements. There is also an intriguing model of the Dutch Reformed Church.  Boer War executions  In the cemetery on the outskirts of town a pyramid of stone marks the grave of three young men executed during the Anglo-Boer War. The people of Hanover were deeply touched by this event. A train had been derailed and plundered at Taaibosch, 20 km from town. Shortly afterwards several young men sleeping in the outside rooms of a nearby farm were taken into custody. They were charged with ‚Äòmaliciously assisting Boer forces,‚Äô robbery and the deaths of passengers. Tried on somewhat dubious authority by a military court at De Aar, three, Sarel Nienaber, J. P. Nienaber and J. A. Nieuwoudt, were shot. They protested their innocence to the end. In H. J. C. Pieterse's book on General Wynand Malan's Boer War experiences, the general states that his commando was responsible for the derailment. The general says the young men were not involved at all. The British, in fact, had sent them to the farm to collect fodder for horses. After the war General Malan joined Olive and Cron Schreiner in a lengthy campaign to have the names of the three cleared. The pyramid of stone over their grave bears this inscription: ‚ÄòVengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord‚Äô.

The centre contains a series of craters and lava flows covering a surface area of . A western component with four craters aligned in a north‚Äìsouth direction on a ridge forms the oldest part. The eastern component is formed by lava flows and craters in Argentina, and the youngest part la Moyra volcano in the western component generated a lava flow that advanced westwards. Weakly porphyritic Andesite and dacite form the rocks of the volcano. No activity, including fumarolic activity, has been recorded at Cord√≥n del Azufre, but the appearance (dark and pristine) and radiometric age (0.3 ¬± 0.3 mya K-Ar on the most recent flow) of the lava flows suggest a recent age.  Geographic context  It is located east of the Chile Trench within the Puna where the volcanic arc intersects a probably deep- seated structural area named the Archibarca corridor. Since the Eocene, underlying convergence and subduction of the Nazca plate at a speed of result in the volcanic activity of the Central Volcanic Zone (CVZ), the activity of fault zones and active deformation south of 23¬∞ S. Several large calderas lie in the CVZ, some of which (Galan, La Pacana) have erupted volumes of over . The area is uninhabited and remote.  Ground deformation  Observations of this volcano and neighbouring Lastarria indicate that they are part of an actively deforming system, named by Pritchard and Simons (2002) the Lazufre system with an axis length of . The modelled centre of deformation is closer to Azufre than Lastarria. Sometimes Cerro Bayo Gorbea is also associated to this complex. This inflation started in the late 1990s and is probably due to the accumulation of volcanic fluids (hydrothermal or magmatic) beneath the volcanic system. The precise date when the uplift started is unclear, because satellite observation of the area is scarce. The start of the uplift may be related to an earthquake in Chile in 1998, but this is questionable. Aftershocks of the 1995 Antofagasta earthquake may be responsible instead. Between 1998 and 2000 the long axis of deformation amounted to , with a later increase to . In 2008 the area had already reached a diameter of and surface area of . In 2015 deformation was observed over a surface of , at depths and with speeds of until 2010. This uncertainty is largely because estimates trade off between depth, pressure and shape of the deformation. Research in 2016 indicated that the uplift dome has a diameter of . Since 2005 uplift speeds of have been observed with InSAR and a magma flux rate of has been inferred. Other research has indicated an inflation rate of , comparable with other plutons in the area. One estimate in 2009 indicated a depth . Another estimate in 2016 indicated a chamber depth of . Research in 2009 indicated that the deforming area has increased by about laterally and covered almost (area uplifted by or more). The researchers concluded that sill fluid dynamics may explain the pattern of uplift and growth in the uplifting area but without major changes in the magma flux rate. Other data indicate that no lateral expansion may be taking place. A study in 2014 indicated that the source of the deformation is most likely elliptical and has a volume of . The deformation pattern may be controlled by local tectonic stress patterns. There are several Pleistocene volcanoes around the uplift region, which may be supplied from the sill. This deformation system is among the largest on Earth. It has been compared to deformation occurring at Uturuncu volcano, but the deformation source beneath Lazufre has not been imaged due to resolution limitations. The size of the deformation area is comparable with the size of calderas such as Long Valley and Yellowstone. Likewise, such deformation patterns are mainly found in active caldera systems and in the case of Lazufre may be caused by the refilling of a magma chamber. The hydrothermal system of Lastarria may be influenced by the uplift, but it's not likely that hydrothermal effects are responsible for the Lazufre deformation. It is not clear whether this deformation is a signal of a future volcanic eruption, but monitoring has been recommended as it may be at risk of a major silicic eruption. Research published in 2016 indicated that the uplift has been ongoing since at least 400,000 years, based on the deformation of lava flows and volcanoes erupted within this time period. Depending on the highly uncertain estimates for the volume of the magma chamber, a modest overpressue may be sufficient to cause the roof of the chamber to fail and an eruption to start.

It was a piston engined aircraft produced at the start of the jet age. Development La-9 represents a further development of the Lavochkin La-126 prototype. The first prototype, designated La-130 was finished in 1946. Similarity to the famous Lavochkin La-7 was only superficial ‚Äì the new fighter had an all-metal construction and a laminar flow wing. Weight savings due to elimination of wood from the airframe allowed for greatly improved fuel capacity and four-cannon armament. Mock combat demonstrated that the La-130 was evenly matched with the La-7 but was inferior to the Yakovlev Yak-3 in horizontal planes. The new fighter, officially designated La-9, entered production in August 1946. A total of 1,559 aircraft were built by the end of production in 1948. Variants Like other aircraft designers at the time, Lavochkin was experimenting with using jet propulsion to augment performance of piston-engined fighters. One such attempt was La-130R with an RD-1Kh3 liquid fuel rocket engine in addition to the Shvetsov ASh-82FN piston powerplant. The project was cancelled in 1946 before the prototype could be assembled. A more unusual approach was La-9RD which was tested in 1947‚Äì1948. It was a production La-9 with a reinforced airframe and armament reduced to two cannons, which carried a single RD-13 pulsejet (the engine which powered the V-1 flying bomb, probably taken from surplus Luftwaffe stocks) under each wing. The 70 km/h (45 mph) increase in top speed came at the expense of tremendous noise and vibration. The engines were unreliable and worsened the handling. The project was abandoned although between 3 and 9 La-9RD were reported to perform at airshows, no doubt pleasing the crowds with the noise. Other notable La-9 variants were: * La-9UTI ‚Äì two- seat trainer version. Built at GAZ-99 in Ulan-Ude. Two versions exist: with 12.7 mm UBS machine gun and with one 23 mm NS-23 cannon (all armament is mounted in the cowling above the engine, firing through the propeller). * La-132 (La-132) ‚Äì prototype with upgraded Shvetsov M-93 engine. Projected top speed 740 km/h (460 mph) at 6,500 m (21,325 ft). Engine proved a failure and the single prototype was equipped with an experimental Shvetsov ASh-82M instead.

History  Slides and pools in the hot springs resort When the Tswana tribes first moved into the region in about the 1800s, they discovered hot springs in the area. The Voortrekker Carl Van Heerden established the first farm in what is now Bela-Bela and called it Het Bad. In 1873, President Burgers' Transvaal government bought the land and established a resort called Hartingsburg after the prominent Dutch biologist Pieter Harting. The British occupied the town during the Anglo Boer War, and renamed the post office Warm Baths in 1903, and proclaimed the boundaries of Warmbaths to be the entire farm of Het Bad. In 1920 Warmbaths was proclaimed a township (in the legal, not racial sense) and the township was designed by architect John Abraham Moffat in that year. In 1950, it became a magisterial district. In 1932 Warmbaths became a village town and was established as a town council in 1960. Called Warmbaths in English, the Afrikaans name for the town was Warmbad. On 14 June 2002 the South African government officially renamed the town to Bela-Bela (meaning \\"boiling boiling\\").

Development One of the recommendations from the government testing of Lavochkin La-130 (Lavochkin La-9 prototype) was to further develop it into a long-range escort fighter. The resultant La-134 prototype (also sometimes referred to as La-9M) featured increased fuel and oil capacity. Armament was reduced to three cannons. The prototype flew in May 1947. The second prototype, La-134D had fuel capacity increased by an additional 275 l (73 US gal) with wing and external fuel tanks. The aircraft was fitted with larger tires to accommodate the increased weight and amenities for long flights such as increased padding in the seat, armrests, and a urinal. In addition, a full radio navigation suite was installed. Not surprisingly, combat performance with a full fuel load suffered. However, as the fuel load approached that of La-9, so did the performance. The aircraft was found to be poorly suited for combat above 7,000 m (23,000 ft). The new fighter, designated La-11 (OKB designation La-140Gordon, Yefim (2003). Lavochkin's Piston-Engined Fighters. Red Star. 10. Earl Shilton, Leicester, UK: Midland Publishing. .) entered production in 1947. By the end of production in 1951, a total of 1,182 aircraft were built. Operational history The first documented combat use of La-11 took place on April 8, 1950, when four Soviet pilots shot down a United States Navy Consolidated PB4Y-2 Privateer over the Baltic Sea, with all 10 of the Privateer's crew lost. Later the same year, two La-11 pilots shot down a USN Lockheed P2V Neptune over the Sea of Japan near Vladivostok; one USN crew member was killed. From February 1950, the Soviet 106th Fighter Aviation Division moved to Shanghai to defend it against bombing by the ROCAF. The division included the 351st Fighter Regiment, equipped with the La-11. On March 7, the regiment claimed a North American B-25 Mitchell bomber, shot down near Nanjing. On March 14, 1950, a Martin B-26 Marauder bomber was claimed in Xuzhou. On March 20, 1950, five La-11 pilots encountered a group of North American P-51 Mustangs north-west of Shanghai, although the P-51 pilots immediately retreated. On April 2, 1950, two P-51s were claimed by La-11 pilots over Shanghai. After that, MiG-15s of the Soviet 29th Fighter Regiment took over the air defence role. The ROCAF stopped bombing Shanghai that June and the Soviet units left in October 1950. By July 1950, La-11s were flying combat air patrol missions over North Korea. On November 30, 1951, 16 La-11 fighter pilots of the 4th Fighter Aviation Regiment, Chinese People's Volunteer Army (PVA) were escorting 9 Tu-2 PVA bombers to bomb the South Korean island of Taehwa-do (ÎåÄÌôîÎèÑ/Â§ßÂíåÂ≥∂), in the Pansong archipelago. They were attacked by more than 30 F-86 fighters of the United States Air Force: four Tu-2 bombers and three La-11s were shot down. The main target of La-11 pilots during the Korean War was the Douglas A-26 Invader night bomber, although numerous skirmishes with P-51s also took place. Attempts to intercept Boeing B-29 Superfortress bombers proved fruitless. An La-11 required 26 minutes to reach the B-29's cruising altitude, and, once there, had a speed advantage of only 20 km/h (12 mph). On July 23, 1954, a Douglas C-54 Skymaster military transport aircraft, registration VR-HEU, operated by Cathay Pacific Airways on a civilian passenger flight en route from Bangkok to Hong Kong, was shot down by two La-11 fighters of the 85th Fighter Regiment, People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) off the coast of Hainan Island, killing 10 people in an incident that has become known as the 1954 Cathay Pacific Douglas DC-4 shootdown. Although the four-engined propeller-driven Douglas (registered VR- HEU) was a C-54 Skymaster, the incident is known as \\"the DC-4 shootdown\\" because the C-54 is the military version of the Douglas DC-4, and the aircraft was flying a commercial passenger run.Accident details - VR-HEU - Plane Crash InfoVR-HEU Account by passenger: Valerie Parish - Major Commercial Airline DisastersVR-HEU - The Life & Times of James HarperHong Kong - Plane Survivors - Movietone News Three days later, near the same location, two La-11s of the same unit were shot down by 2 AD-4 airplanes of the US Navy.

He was the youngest child of Barend and Elizabeth Burger of the farm Langefontein in the Camdeboo district of Graaff Reinet, Cape Colony. Biography After studying theology at the University of Utrecht in the Netherlands, Burgers became the parson of Hanover, South Africa in 1859. A charmingly eloquent, but fiercely individualistic man, he had been influenced by Professor C. W. Opzoomer in the Netherlands and embraced his rationalist, liberal ideas. Burgers quickly became involved in a stormy controversy with the Dutch Reformed Synod over his alleged liberalism and disbelief in the literal truth of the Bible. He was critical of traditional culture and strongly emphasised knowledge and rationalism. In 1862, his unorthodox doctrine brought on him an accusation of heresy, and in 1864, he was found guilty by the Synod and suspended. The Supreme Court overturned the decision, and in 1865, he was readmitted to the ministry. Some of his liberal theological ideas and his diverting viewpoints can be found in the sketches he wrote about daily life in Hanover. The burghers of the South African Republic urged Burgers to stand for the presidency, and he was elected by the considerable majority of 2,964 to 388 in 1872. The South African Republic's first coins‚Äîthe famous Burgerspond‚Äîwas introduced in 1874. These were struck at Heaton's Mint in Birmingham, England when he was there on a visit. Some people in the South African Republic objected to the issue of the Burgerspond, because the portrayal of the President on coins likened him to a dictator. The 1905 New International Encyclop√¶dia describes Burgers' policies as president as ‚Äúcharacterized by brilliant but impracticable schemes, aiming chiefly at territorial expansion.‚Äù One of his plans, inspired by the neighbouring Cape Prime Minister John Molteno's massive railway programme, was to build a railway linking the Transvaal to the sea. In 1875 he traveled to Europe to raise funds, but his plans were thwarted by the Pedi chief Sekhukhune, whose lands lay in the path of the proposed railway. By 1877, Burgers was very unpopular and his government was insolvent. Britain, keen on expanding their empire, stepped in and annexed the Transvaal. Burgers retired from political life, settled in the Cape Colony again, and died in 1881, only forty-seven years old, and leaving his family destitute. Coming to the family's aid, Burgers' former private secretary, Th.M. Tromp, published the sketches Burgers had written about his experiences as minister in Hanover. The proceeds of the book, in Dutch and published in the Netherlands, were used to alleviate his family's financial problems. He was a South African Freemason. He ended his days disheartened and in poverty. His body was disinterred in 1895, to be reburied in the Pretoria cemetery now known as the Heroes' Acre.

Design and development Before the war, Yakovlev was best known for building light sports aircraft. His Yak-4 light bomber impressed the Soviet government enough to order the OKB to design a new fighter with a Klimov M-106 V-12 liquid-cooled engine.

The design took full advantage of Yakovlev OKB's experience with sports aircraft and promised agility as well as high top speed. Since the M-106 was delayed, the design was changed to incorporate the Klimov M-105P V-12 engine, with a ShVAK cannon in the \\"vee\\" of the engine block, in a mount. I-26-I first flew on 13 January 1940 and suffered from oil overheating which was never completely resolved, resulting in 15 emergency landings during early testing. On 27 April 1940, I-26-1 crashed, killing its test pilot Yu.I. Piontkovskiy. The investigation of the crash found that the pilot had performed two consecutive barrel rolls at low altitude, which was in violation of the test flight plan. It was believed that during the first roll, the main landing gear became unlocked, causing it to crash through the wing during the second roll. It has been speculated that Piontkovskiy's deviation from the flight plan was caused by frustration that his aircraft was being used for engine testing while I-26-2, built with the lessons of I-26-1 in mind, was already performing aerobatics. Technical problems with sub-assemblies provided by different suppliers raised the I-26-2's weight above projected figures, which restricted the airframe to only 4.4 G, while oil overheating continued to occur. The many defects caused I-26-2 to fail government testing in 1940. Fortunately for Yakovlev, its competitors, I-200 (future Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-3) and I-301 (future LaGG-3), also failed testing. Requested improvements were incorporated into I-26-3, which was delivered for testing on 13 October 1940. Although it passed on 9 December 1940, the aircraft was still very much unfinished, its engine problems still unresolved. Troublesome and slow testing and development concerned Soviet officials, since I-26 was ordered into production under the name \\"Yak-1\\" on 19 February 1940, a mere month after I-26-1 made its maiden flight. The gamble was intended to reduce the time between the prototype and the beginning of production of service aircraft; t he I-200 and I-301 were also ordered into production. The Yak-1 was slower than the I-200 and less heavily armed than the I-301, it enjoyed the advantage of having been started earlier, which gave it a consistent lead in testing and development over its competitors. Due to Operation Barbarossa the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941, development of promising designs, like the Polikarpov I-185, proved unfeasible. Yakovlev might have been Joseph Stalin's favorite, which may have been in the Yak-1's favor. Simultaneous manufacturing and testing of a design that required as many improvements as I-26 caused much disruption of production. Almost 8,000 changes were made to the blueprints by 1941, with an additional 7,000 implemented the following year and 5,000 more in 1942. Production was further slowed by shortages of engines, propellers, radiators, wheels and cannons. Shortages of quality materials resulted in plywood being shed from the wings of several aircraft. Factory No.292, the main manufacturer of Yak-1s was bombed on 23 June 1941 and burned to the ground; production resumed amid the ruins on 29 June. Due to loose tolerances, each aircraft was unique, with workers performing the final assembly having to mate dissimilar components. The left and right main landing gear could be of different lengths and different angles relative to the aircraft, which required adjusting their attachments to ensure an even stance for the aircraft and parts were often not interchangeable. Production of the Yak-1 ended in July 1944, with somewhere around 8,700 built. Operational history At the time of Operation Barbarossa on 22 June 1941, 425 Yak-1s had been built, although many were en route or still incomplete. 92 machines were fully operational in the Western Military Districts but most were lost in the first days.Drabkin 2007, p. 146. The Yak-1 was built as an escort fighter for Il-2 tactical bombers and combats took place below , where the Yak-1 performed the best. The Yak-1 proved to have a significant advantage over its Soviet competitors. A full circle turn took just 17 seconds in the Yak-1M. The MiG-3, which had the best high- altitude performance, did poorly at low and medium altitudes and its light armament made it unsuitable for ground attack. The LaGG-3 experienced a significant degradation in performance (as much as on some aircraft) compared to its prototypes due to the manufacturer's inexperience with its special wooden construction, which suffered from warping and rotting when exposed to the elements. The Yak-1's plywood covering also suffered from the weather but the steel frame kept the aircraft largely intact. Early aircraft suffered from fuel leaks, spot-welded fuel tanks failing from vibration. The canopy could not be opened under certain conditions in earlier models and some pilots had the sliding portion of the canopy removed. The first 1,000 Yak-1s had no radios; wireless equipment became common by spring 1942 and obligatory by August 1942 but Soviet radios were notoriously unreliable and short-ranged, so they were frequently removed to save weight.Drabkin 2007, p. 146. The M-105 could not tolerate negative G forces which starved it of fuel and suffered from breakdowns of magnetos, speed governors and emitted oil from the reduction shaft.Gordon 2008, p. 143. The Yak-1 was better than the Bf 109E but inferior to the Bf 109F ‚Äì its main opponent ‚Äì in rate of climb at all altitudes, although it could complete a circle at the same speed (20‚Äì21 seconds at ).Williams and Gustin 2003, p. 113.Gordon 2008, p. 139.. The Bf 109, with its automatic wing slats, had a lower stall speed and was more stable in sharp turns and vertical aerobatic figures.Drabkin 2007, p. 146. A simulated combat between a Yak (with M-105PF engine) and a Bf 109F revealed that the Messerschmitt had only marginally superior manoeuvrability at , though the German fighter could gain substantial advantage over the Yak-1 within four or five nose-to-tail turns. At , the capabilities of the two fighters were nearly equal, as combat was essentially reduced to head-on attacks. At altitudes over , the Yak was more manoeuvrable. The engine's nominal speed at low altitudes was lowered to 2,550 rpm, and the superiority of the Bf 109F at these altitudes was reduced. The Yak-1's armament would be considered too light by Western standards but was typical of Soviet aircraft, pilots preferring a few guns grouped on the centerline to improve accuracy and reduce weight. Wing guns were rarely used on Soviet fighters and when they were supplied, they were often removed (as they were from US-supplied Bell P-39 Airacobras). Avoiding wing guns reduced weight and demonstrably improved roll rates (the same was true of the Bf 109F). The US and Britain considered heavy armament and high performance necessary, even at the cost of inferior manoeuvrability, while the Soviets relied on the marksmanship of their pilots coupled with agile aircraft. Even with the Yak-1's light armament, to reduce weight, modifications were made on the front line and on about thirty production aircraft: the 7.62 mm ShKAS machine-guns were removed, retaining only the single ShVAK cannon. Nevertheless, these lighter aircraft were popular with experienced pilots, for whom the reduction in armament was acceptable and combat experience in November 1942 showed a much improved kill- to-loss ratio. In the autumn of 1942, the Yak-1B appeared, with the more powerful M-105P engine and a single 12.7 mm UBS machine gun instead of the two ShKAS. Although this did not increase the total weight of fire much, the UBS machine-gun was much more effective than the two 7.62 mm ShKAS. The simple VV ring sight replaced the PBP gun-sight because of the very poor quality of the latter's lenses. The Yak-1 had a light tail, and it was easy to tip over and to hit the ground with the propeller. Often, technicians had to keep the tail down, which could lead to accidents, with aircraft taking off with technicians still on the rear fuselage.Drabkin 2007, p. 56. The Yak-1 was well liked by its pilots; Nikolai G. Golodnikov considered that the Yak-1B, flown by experienced pilots, could meet the Bf 109F-4 and G-2 on equal terms.Drabkin 2007, p. 135.Gordon 2008, p. 149 The French Normandie-Niemen squadron selected the primitive model Yak-1M (that had a cut-down fuselage to allow all-round vision) when it was formed, in March 1943.Gunston 1980, p. 203. Twenty-four of these aircraft were sent to the all-female 586th Fighter Aviation Regiment, whose pilots included the world's only female aces: Katya Budanova, with 5, and Lydia Litvyak (claims range between 5 and 12, plus two shared). Litvyak flew Yak-1 \\"Yellow 44\\", with an aerial mast, at first in 296th Fighter Aviation Regiment and then with 73rd Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment, until her death in combat on 1 August 1943.Morgan 1999, p. 31. Another ace who flew the Yak-1 was Mikhail Baranov, who scored all his 24 victories with it, including five in a day (four Bf 109s and a Ju 87, on 6 August 1942).Bergstrom, Dikov & Antipov (2006), pp. 61‚Äì62 The Yak-1 was also the first type operated by the (1st Polish Fighter Regiment \\"Warsaw\\"). Soviet naming conventions obscure the fact that the Yak-1 and its successors ‚Äì the Yak-7, Yak-9 and Yak-3 ‚Äì are essentially the same design, comparable to the numerous Spitfire or Bf 109 variants. Were the Yaks considered as one type, the 37,000 built would constitute the most produced fighter in history.Gunston 1998, p. 88.Ethell 1995, p. 163. That total would also make the Yak one of the most prolific aircraft in history, roughly equal to the best known Soviet ground attack type of World War II, the IL-2 Shturmovik. Losses were the highest of all fighter types in service in the USSR: from 1941 to 1945, VVS KA lost 3,336 Yak-1s: 325 in 1941, 1,301 the following year, 1,056 in 1943, 575 in 1944 and 79 in 1945.Bergstr√∂m 2008, p. 132.

It is part of the canton of Echternach, which is part of the district of Grevenmacher. Commune In 2005, the town of Beaufort, which lies in the centre of the commune, had a population of 1,366. Other towns within the commune include Dillingen. Castle Beaufort castle The old castle, protected by a moat, was built in four periods. Based on a document of 1192, it is assumed that Walter of Wiltz and Beaufort was the first Lord of Beaufort. The oldest part of the castle dates from the early 11th century. It was a small square-shaped fortress on a massive rock, surrounded by a wide ditch and a second wall facing the valley. Around the first half of the 12th century, a flanking tower was added and the access gate was moved and enlarged. The marriage of Adelaide of Beaufort with William of Orley in 1348 meant that the castle became the property of the House of Orley. The lords of Orley expanded the castle towards the valley. The wing containing the well and the upper rooms as well as the lower part of the main tower date from this period. Since 1539 Bernard of Velbr√ºck was Lord of Beaufort. The House of Beaufort became ruined by the Thirty Year War and thus was forced to sell up. On 27.11.1639 Johann Baron von Beck, governor of the province of Luxembourg on behalf of the Spanish King, acquired the greatest part of its properties. It is likely that he built the wing with the large Renaissance style windows in the main tower and the northwestern cannon tower. After 1643 he ordered the building of the new renaissance chateau. Johann von Beck, however, died of injuries received at the Battle of Lens in 1648 before he could even move in. His son finished the construction in 1649. The old abandoned knights' castle slowly decayed. At the beginning of the 19th century it was used as a quarry. In 1850 the Luxembourg government declared the castle a cultural heritage. As of 1893 Beaufort castle acquired a new look under the new owner Henri Even and his son Joseph Linckels. The new palace was restored and the sheep farm was expanded. In 1928 Edmond Linckels cleared the rubble from the castle and the well and made the site available to the public. Since 1981 the castle and the chateau are owned by the Luxembourg state.

Martone has won two Fellowships from the NEA and a grant from the Ingram Merrill Foundation. His stories and essays have appeared and been cited in the Pushcart Prize, The Best American Stories and The Best American Essays anthologies.  Biography  Martone attended Butler University and graduated from Indiana University. He holds an MA from the Writing Seminars of Johns Hopkins University, where he studied under John Barth. He has been a faculty member of the MFA Program for Writers at Warren Wilson College, and has taught at Iowa State University, Harvard University, Syracuse University and the University of Alabama. He lives in Tuscaloosa with his wife, the poet Theresa Pappas. The couple has two sons, both of whom are writers: Sam Martone and Nicholas V. Pappas.\\"\\", Superstition Review, Fall 2009. Aside from studying under and befriending John Barth, Martone also developed a close relationship with the writer Thomas Pynchon while the two lived together in Brooklyn. It was later on, while teaching at Syracuse in the early 1990s, that Martone befriended a young David Foster Wallace and introduced to him a number of influential works, most notably Lewis Hyde's The Gift. Career Martone's 2005 work, Michael Martone, is an investigation of form and autobiography. It was originally written as a series of contributor's notes for various publications. One of his central interests is the \\"false biography\\" and the often blurry boundary between fact and fiction. He also considers himself a \\"neo-regionalist.\\" Both of these interests are reflected in books like his 2001 The Blue Guide to Indiana which, as a disclaimer on the cover makes clear, \\"is in no way affiliated with, endorsed by, or associated with the series of travel books titled Blue Guide,\\" and \\"in no way factually depicts or accurately represents the State of Indiana.\\" The disclaimer, Martone explains, was included after he received a cease and desist letter from the publisher of \\"the real Blue Guide.\\" This letter in turn inspired the opening chapter of Martone's 2015 anthology, Winesburg, Indiana, written in the form of a cease and desist letter from the fictional town of Winesburgcreated by the novelist Sherwood Andersonwhich claims proprietary rights to ‚Äúthe distribution of Sadness, Fear, Longing, and Confusion itself. We have patented madness. We own Trembling. We extensively market Grief.‚Äú Martone has devoted much of his career to disrupting and defamiliarizing the taken-as-given notions of order, ownership, and identity in his field, and has been described as literature's \\"most notorious mutineer.\\" In 1988 his membership to the American Academy of Poets was briefly revoked after he published two books, one listed as \\"prose\\" and one as \\"poetry\\" which wereaside from the line-breaks in onecompletely identical to one another. His AWP membership has been revoked multiple times. In the late nineties, after reading Neal Bowers' book of non-fiction, Words for the Taking, which describes the author's agonizing hunt for the person who has plagiarized his poems, Martone began to publish poetry under the pseudonym \\"Neal Bowers.\\" \\"I am not using Bowers' poems,\\" Martone later explained, \\"only the name. So when these poems get published, Neal Bowers could actually include them on his vita as far as I'm concerned. I hope he does ... I understand the theft of intellectual property that got Neal Bowers so worked up. But is it plagiarism to actually contribute to someone else's work? I am not stealing his work but actually donating my own to his store of work.\\" According to Martone he has written under a number of nom de plumes: \\"I've published fictional poems under the name Neal Bowers, fictional stories under the names Christian Piers, Jonah Ogles, Arin Fisher, Sarah Mignin, and Matthew Douglas McCabe, fictional nonfiction under the username zzxyzz [on Wikipedia.org], fictional advertisements under the name Klemm Co., and fictional songs with the band under the name AVALANCHE.\\" Of this impulse, Martone has said \\"I‚Äôve never really felt much like 'Michael Martone'‚Äîsometimes I think my entire life I‚Äôve been wearing a costume. At some point I put it on to cope with things that Michael Martone was too weak to take on as himself. And after a while I forgot I was even wearing the costume. Now I can‚Äôt take it off. I‚Äôve forgotten where the zipper is, and I‚Äôm stuck in it.\\" Martone's work sometimes resembles, more so than traditional literature, performance and installation art. In his twenties, under the name Paul French, Martone self- published the book The Numberless, the sole copy of which exists within the confines of a rural shed in Fort Wayne, Indiana, nailed page by page to the walls, windows, and rafters, in a random, unnumbered order. More recently, he has been working on the sequel to this piece in an abandoned carton factory on the outskirts of Tuscaloosa. Martone has also written a number of fictional interviews with his mentor John Barth, as well as fictional advertisements in the margins of magazines such as McSweeney‚Äôs, Black Warrior Review and Nashville Review.  Influences  In a 2007 interview with Fred Arroyo (now collected in Unconventions), Martone provides a list of major influences, cataloguing figures not only from literary fiction but also popular musicians, visual artists, and television personalities, explaining that, to him it seems \\"the assumptions about influences often suggest the notion of a Gatsby-like program of improvement. The writer only reads 'good' books that contribute to his or her scheme of perfection ... Whatever I am up to as a writer has come about mainly by accident, inertia, and least resistance.\\" Throughout other interviews, Martone reiterates a number of the same names and also mentions several others, occasionally expanding on why these writers are important for him.

They may carry out a range of services, including social care, mental health services or primary care services. Care Trusts are set up when the NHS and local authorities agree to work closely together, usually where it is felt that a closer relationship between health and social care is needed or would benefit local care services. Care trusts were established under the NHS Plan 2000, in England to bring together in one legal entity the commissioning and provision of health and social care services, especially for older people. Torbay and Southern Devon Health and Care NHS Trust was regarded as the most successful. Others are Worcestershire Health and Care NHS Trust, Bradford District Care Trust, Kent and Medway NHS and Social Care Partnership Trust and Sheffield Health & Social Care NHS Foundation Trust Care trusts do not exist in Scotland, nor are there plans to introduce them. In Northern Ireland, health and social care is organised through five sub-regional health and social care trusts.

As both a fighter and later reverting to its original training role, the Yak-7 proved to be a capable aircraft and was well liked by air crews. The Yak-7 was simpler, tougher and generally better than the Yak-1.Taylor 1985, p. 122. Design and development In 1939, Alexander Yakovlev designed a tandem-seat advanced trainer, originally designated \\"I-27\\" and then \\"UTI-26\\", offered along with the original I-26 proposal that became the Yak-1. The \\"UTI\\" (Uchebno Trenirovochnyi Istrebitel, translated as: Training Fighter) was intended to give pilots-in-training experience on a high-performance aircraft before transitioning to a fighter. With development work started in 1940, the UTI-26 differed from its predecessor in its larger span wing being placed farther back for balance as well as having two cockpits with dual controls and a rudimentary communication system. It was armed with a single ShKAS machine gun in the cowling, mainly for use in training, but Yakovlev envisioned a multi- purpose aircraft that could also undertake courier and light transport duties at the front. The first production aircraft known as Yak-7UTIs retained a retractable main landing gear, but beginning in the summer of 1941, a fixed landing gear variant, the Yak-7V (Vyvozoni for Familiarization) was substituted. The factory reasoned that production would be simplified and that reduced performance would not be detrimental for a trainer. Yak-7UTIs and Yak-7Vs were also equipped with skis for winter operations. A factory team from N¬∞ 301, headed by K.A. Sinelshchikov, was detached from the Yakovlev OKB to supervise production of Yak-7UTI. One of these aircraft (serial number 04-11) was fitted with an armored backrest plate over the rear position, self- sealing fuel tanks which filled with inert gas as they emptied, three \\"RO\\" rocket launchers under each wing for as many RS-82 rockets, an axial motornaya pushka-mount ShVAK cannon firing through the propeller spinner, with 120 rounds, and two 7.62 mm ShKAS machine guns under the cowling, each with 750 rounds.Leonard 2005, p. 60. The rear cockpit position was retained, allowing it to accommodate a second seat (without controls) for fast courier and transport duties or a fuel tank for extended range. The additional space could also house bombs or other gear. The engine was an M-105P and the model was designated Yak-7/M-105P. Sinelshchikov did not inform Yakovlev about the conversion and when he learned about it, Yakovlev remained sceptical of the need for the changes. After brief factory trials, the aircraft turned out to be better than the single-seat Yak-1, thanks to the modifications already applied to the UTI as well as revised undercarriage with bigger tires and wheels, more efficient brakes and revised elevators, among other changes. Yakovlev submitted the Yak-7 to the authorities who approved it immediately. The firing tests at the scientific trials Polygon for aircraft armament (NIPAV) were a success and the armament was found to have no effect on the flight characteristics or the general performances of the new fighter. The aircraft's stability as a firing platform was judged far better than that of the Yak-1, the Lavochkin-Gorbunov-Gudkov LaGG-3 and Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-3. The GKO and the NKAP issued decrees in August 1941 for the Yak-7 to be produced by Factories N¬∞301 and N¬∞153, but the Factory 301 had to be evacuated to Novosibirsk where it merged with N¬∞ 153. So, just 62 aircraft were produced in 1941: 51 in September‚ÄìOctober by Factory N¬∞ 301 and 11 by N¬∞153 in December. Test pilot A.N. Lazarev noted the good flight characteristics, how easy it was to get out of a spin, how well it behaved when diving, characteristics that he considered safer than those of the Yak-1. But the Yak-7 showed some defects: the M-105P engine piping, the landing gear locking system, the tires and the tail wheel were identified.Leonard 2005, pp. 60‚Äì61. The Yak-7 was introduced into the production line and the first batch of 60 reached operational squadrons by the end of 1941. Another important variant was the Yak-7/M-105PA. On this model, the two ShKAS on the cowling had been replaced by two UBS machine guns with 400 rounds (260 for the left and 160 for the right). It was powered by an M-105PA engine with an axial ShVAK cannon with 120 rounds. Oil and glycol radiators had been widened and refined and slightly tilted downward. The insulation of the airframe was improved, tail wheel was totally retractable; joints and skin were more carefully made; panels on engine cowling fitted better; the propeller reduction gear worked better; an electro-pneumatic reloading system was installed; canopy frame was reinforced. The Yak-7B made 27 tests flights in January and February 1942. The reports noted that while the aircraft \\"was not inferior to the LaGG-3 and MiG-3 and to foreign fighters in service in the USSR\\", it was more stable and had better flight characteristics. Subsequently, the GKO authorised production at Factory N¬∞153 in place of the Yak-7A, from April 1942 and 261 machines were built until July. After 20 May, the aircraft were equipped with a tank behind the pilot's seat, but the pilots that used the Yak-7 on Stalingrad and on the Kuban removed it as it was not protected and affected the flight characteristics. Generally, the Yak-7B pleased its pilots. They reported that it was easy to fly at all altitudes, stable and easy to maintain and although it did not climb as quickly as a Messerschmitt Bf 109, it was as manoeuvrable and fast, except in the vertical plane. But defects were also noted: there was too much drag from the radiators, the canopy glass was of bad quality; the pilot was not protected enough, taking-off and landing distances were too long and, above all, it was underpowered.Leonard 2005, p. 78. Yakovlev suggested to Klimov, the engine builder, some modifications that resulted in the M-105PF which was more powerful. With this modified engine, the Yak-7B top speed was of , it climbed much faster up to and it was more manoeuvrable both in the horizontal and the vertical planes. But because the rear tank was removed, its range was reduced and the CG was moved too forward, while M-105 defects (glycol and oil overheating, oil leaks etc.) persisted.Leonard 2005, p. 79. Among the engine and armament options was the Yak-7-37 fitted with a MPSh-37 cannon, (MPSh - motornaya pushka Shpital'novo - engine mounted Shpital'nyy cannon), mounted between the engine cylinder blocks, firing through the propeller spinner. Operational history The Yak-7 proved to be an effective close support fighter although the first two-seaters were considered nose- heavy, consequently, the factory introduced a rear cockpit fuel tank. Pilots complained about the fuel tank's vulnerability since it was unarmored, and it was usually removed in the field. There were constant changes to the design based on combat observations including a definitive single-seat variant, the Yak-7B, which was produced in large numbers. After the war, some Yak-7V trainers were provided to the Poles and a single Yak-7V was delivered to the Hungarians for familiarization with the Yak-9 fighter. After trials in April‚ÄìMay 1942, a small batch of 22 Yak-7-37s was authorised, all of which were issued to the 42nd Fighter Aviation Regiment (IAP) at the North-Western front, where they proved highly successful both in air-to-air combat and ground attack.

It was ported to home systems on the Sega Saturn in 1996. It was released on PC in 1997 and Sega Dreamcast in 2000. It was later bundled with Virtua Cop in Virtua Cop: Elite Edition for PlayStation 2 in 2002. This game was known as Virtua Squad 2 for the North American PC release. The game was succeeded by Virtua Cop 3. Gameplay The game features three levels through which the player's movement is automated on a predetermined path. However, unlike the first Virtua Cop, at certain points the player picks their route from two possible choices. It is the player's job to shoot the criminals that appear before time runs out and they shoot back, while taking care not to shoot any innocent bystanders. Along the way there are various objects in the background that can be broken if shot, some of which will reveal power ups afterwards. As with the first Virtua Cop, players earn extra points for \\"justice shots\\", meaning shooting an enemy's gun hand to disarm them without killing them. By consistently defeating enemies without taking hits or shooting hostages, the player increases the multiplier which is applied every time they earn points. At the end of each level there is a boss battle, as well as one extra final boss battle after all three levels have been finished. A combat training simulator, the \\"Proving Ground\\", simulates a variety of life-threatening situations. Each Proving Ground stage is designed to simulate a hostile urban environment thronging with enemies. The goal of each stage is to blast through the crowd of thugs while hunting down and taking out the rival player. Characters *Michael Hardy (Rage) - Two years later, this cop has grown up with his partner, James Cools and a newcomer cop, Janet Marshall. He could do better than anyone else, including his part-time job and his duty training. He is known to be a quick draw when things get under fire. Rage is an all-around character in the game. *James Cools (Smarty) - Like his partner, Michael who worked the same side for the good as well as he does, this doesn't stop him from beating by some bad guys. Although Rage is quicker on the draw in a gunfight, Smarty is known to be the top shot in the police force. *Janet Marshall (Janet) - A newly installed special VCPD detective in the Virtua Cop special investigations squad (although the only female cop in the squad), Janet fights for her deceased partner. Normally, Rage is the character for Player 1, but a cheat code in the Saturn version allows Player 1 to play as Janet. Plot Michael \\"Rage\\" Hardy and James \\"Smarty\\" Cools shut down the E.V.I.L Inc. criminal empire. Three of its leaders, King, Boss, and Kong are all in the maximum security federal pen. The final, fourth member of the E.V.I.L Inc. gang, international terrorist Joe Fang is believed to have been killed in a helicopter crash, though his body was never found. After the downfall of E.V.I.L Inc., a comprehensive investigation of their black market and gun-running activities was launched in the Virtua City bank. Meanwhile, the Virtua City Police Special Investigations Unit got a new member in the shape of Janet Marshall, an expert in criminal psychology profiling. The vice-president of the Virtua City Bank is killed in shady circumstances that are only officially termed accidental. And the swollen accounts of the now-defunct E.V.I.L Syndicate, which he had been suspected of laundering, are emptied overnight. The missing funds amount to more than the GNP of most small countries. Meanwhile, on the other side of town, there is a daring daylight raid on the biggest jewelers in the state. And at the site of the new subway construction, there's been an unusual amount of unexplained activity involving some very suspicious-looking materiel. Development When questioned about Sega AM2's plans for Virtua Cop 2 in a February 1995 interview, AM2 manager Fumio Kurokawa stated \\"We're not sure if there will be [a] VC2. However, since the original VC did well at the arcades, we are certainly thinking about something to follow up.\\" The Saturn version was demonstrated at the May 1996 Electronic Entertainment Expo, at which point only the first level was in a playable state. Development was slowed because AM2's resources were prioritized for the Saturn versions of Fighting Vipers and Virtua Fighter Kids. The game was later bundled with Virtua Cop in Japan and Europe on the PlayStation 2 as Virtua Cop: Elite Edition (Virtua Cop Rebirth in Japan) on August 25, 2002 and November 29, 2002 respectively. Reception In Japan, Game Machine listed Virtua Cop 2 on their November 1, 1995 issue as being the second most-successful dedicated arcade game of the year. Reviewing the arcade version, a Next Generation critic commented that \\"the action, enemies, variation of levels and backgrounds, and the fun are all so improved over Virtua Cop 1, and in all the right places, that no other laser-gun shooter comes close to it right now.\\" He especially praised the high frame rate, the level design, the need for skilled aiming, and the way the game is paced such that bouts of intense shootouts with \\"multitudes of terrorists\\" are broken by short pauses to give the player a breather. As with the original Virtua Cop, the Saturn version of Virtua Cop 2 received positive reviews for its fun gameplay and close translation of the arcade version, while being criticized as too lacking in longevity for a home console game. However, some critics, rather than complaining about the longevity, noted that while it takes about the same amount of time to complete a single playthrough as in the original, the game is much longer than the first Virtua Cop when taking into account all the different level branches. Reviews generally hailed the game as a considerable improvement over the already impressive original, due to its more interactive environments and higher intensity, especially in the chase scenes. A Next Generation critic elaborated, \\"Taking the game one step closer to the feel of a big budget action movie, Virtua Cop 2 seems to have more 'movement' to it. ... Whether chasing down an armored car while picking off bad guys hanging out the window, or dodging bullets in a speeding subway train, this game is just short of being described as a roller coaster ride by some hack movie critic in the Midwest and even closer to being described as an 'edge of your seat thriller' by this reviewer on the West coast.\\" Air Hendrix of GamePro had a somewhat more tempered response, arguing that one can still quickly memorize the game, making repeat plays increasingly routine. He concluded, \\"For lightgun fans, VC2's a solid buy. Otherwise, its short-lived but frenzied fun makes for a top Saturn rental.\\" The four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly had similar reactions, while Rich Leadbetter of Sega Saturn Magazine argued that even the shorter Virtua Cop has far more longevity than it is usually given credit for, as both it and the sequel have numerous modes and approaches that can provide players with new challenges on repeat plays. Tom Ham wrote in GameSpot, \\"While the first Virtua Cop set a new standard for light gun shooters, Sega and the AM2 team have delivered an incredible sequel that takes the concept to a whole new level.\\" Electronic Gaming Monthly named the Saturn version a runner-up for Shooter Game of the Year (behind Alien Trilogy). In 1997 they named the Saturn version number 98 on their \\"100 Best Games of All Time\\", citing its addition of branching levels and innovative stage design to the series' revolutionary use of polygonal enemies which move realistically and react differently depending on where they are shot. Note: Contrary to the title, the intro to the article explicitly states that the list covers console video games only, meaning PC games and arcade games were not eligible. The GamesMaster Challenge Event In 1997, former Games World Videator and future videogames journalist Martin Mathers appeared on the British videogames television show GamesMaster and participated in a challenge to complete a stage on two separate Virtua Cop 2 cabinets at the same time. Mathers ultimately failed the challenge after shooting a bystander and losing a life. This challenge can be seen on the GamesMaster DVD given away on the tenth anniversary issue of GamesMaster magazine in 2003.

Martynov. \\"Designations of Soviet and Russian Military Aircraft and Missiles.\\" designation-systems.net, 2008. Retrieved: 19 August 2011) was a first- generation Soviet turbojet fighter developed by the Yakovlev design bureau (OKB) immediately after World War II. It used a reverse-engineered German Junkers Jumo 004 engine. Along with the Swedish Saab 21R, it was one of only two jets to be successfully converted from a piston-powered aircraft and enter production.Gunston 1995, p. 472 280 aircraft were built in 1947. Although nominally a fighter, it was mainly used to qualify piston-engine-experienced pilots to fly jets. Design=Development and description On 9 April 1945, the Council of People's Commissars ordered the Yakovlev OKB to develop a single-seat jet fighter to be equipped with a single German Jumo 004 engine. To save time, Yakovlev based the new design (known as the Yak-3-Jumo or Yak- Jumo) on the latest version of his successful Yakovlev Yak-3 piston-engined fighter. The piston engine was removed and the jet engine was mounted underneath the forward fuselage so that its exhaust exited underneath the middle of the fuselage. To protect the fuselage, a steel heatshield was added to its bottom. The deeper forward part of the fuselage gave the aircraft a \\"pod-and-boom\\" configuration. Very few changes were made to the metal fuselage other than at the aircraft's nose. This was recontoured to accommodate the armament of two Nudelman-Suranov NS-23 autocannon, an additional fuel tank above the engine and the engine itself. No changes were made to the wings other than the elimination of the air intakes for the oil cooler and the bending of the front wing spar into an inverted U-shape to clear the engine. The vertical stabilizer was slightly enlarged, but the tailplane was unmodified. The conventional landing gear was also unmodified other than the tailwheel which now used several steel leaf springs as shock absorbers. The Yak-Jumo carried a total of of fuel.Gordon 2002, pp. 47, 61 Yak-15 forward fuselage and engine Taxi tests began in October 1945, but the heatshield proved to be too short and the heat from the engine exhaust melted the duralumin skin of the rear fuselage as well as the rubber tire of the tailwheel. Modifications to rectify the problems took until late December. By this time a second prototype had been completed with a solid steel tailwheel and an enlarged tailplane. After a few taxiing tests, it was transferred to the Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute (TsAGI) for full-scale windtunnel testing that lasted until February 1946. On the 26th of that month, the Council of People's Commissars issued requirements that the aircraft should have a maximum speed of at sea level and a speed of at an altitude of . It should be able to climb to that altitude in 4 1/2 minutes or less and it should have a range of at 90% of maximum speed. Two prototypes were to be ready for flight testing on 1 September.Gordon 2002, p. 50 The Mikoyan- Gurevich OKB was developing the MiG-9 at the same time. According to aviation historians Bill Gunston and Yefim Gordon, representatives from Yakovlev and Mikoyan-Gurevich tossed a coin on 24 April 1946 to determine which aircraft would be the first Soviet jet to fly. Yakovlev lost and the Yak-Jumo made one circuit of the airfield before landing.Gunston and Gordon, p. 106 The manufacturer's flight testing of the aircraft was completed on 22 June, but its early success caused the Council of Ministers to issue a new requirement on 29 April for two aircraft powered by the Soviet-built RD-10 engine (known as the Yak-15, Yak-15RD10 or Yak-RD). Aside from the new engine, the requirement differed from the previous one only in a range of at optimum cruise speed and a reduction of the maximum ceiling to . Two prototypes were ordered to be available for flight testing on 1 September 1946. Yakovlev was able to adapt the two existing prototypes to the RD-10 with little trouble and one aircraft participated in the August 1946 Tushino flypast. The day after the aerial display, Joseph Stalin summoned Artem Mikoyan and Aleksandr Yakovlev to his office and ordered that each OKB build 15 aircraft to participate in the 7 November parade in Red Square commemorating the anniversary of the October Revolution. Factory No. 31 in Tbilisi was chosen to build the new aircraft because it was still building conventional Yak-3s and could easily switch to the jet fighter. All 15 aircraft were built before the deadline, although they lacked any armour, were provided with an enlarged fuel tank in lieu of armament, and had an incomplete avionics outfit. The parade was canceled and two of the aircraft were modified with a single 23 mm cannon and began State acceptance trials which lasted until April 1947.Gordon 2002, p. 51 The tests revealed a number of problems in that the thick wing inherited from the Yak-3 limited the top speed of the aircraft, the engine exhaust damaged the surface of the airfield, the cockpit often filled with smoke from kerosene and oil that had dripped onto the engine, and the aircraft was very short-ranged. Despite these problems, the Yak-15 proved to be very easy to fly, even for pilots accustomed to piston-engined fighters, and caused the VVS to accept the fighter as a conversion trainer.Gordon 2002, pp. 58‚Äì59 Even before the State acceptance trials were completed, the Council of Ministers ordered the aircraft into production in December 1946. 50 aircraft were to be built between January and April 1947, equally split between single-seat aircraft and two-seat trainers, armed with only a single cannon. The trainer ran into serious development difficulties and all the aircraft of the first batch were single-seaters. Fifty of these participated in the May Day flypast in Moscow in 1947. A total of 280 Yak-15s were produced through the end of the year, exclusive of prototypes.Gordon 2002, pp. 59‚Äì61 The aircraft were distributed in small numbers to fighter aviation regiments based in the USSR, Poland, Romania, Hungary, and Manchuria for use as conversion trainers. The aircraft's manoeuvrability led it to be used by a number of informal acrobatic display teams throughout the late 1940s.Mikolajczuk, pp. 13, 15 A single prototype of the two-seat trainer was the first aircraft of the first production batch built by Factory No. 31 in the fall of 1946. The prototype did not begin manufacturer's flight testing until 5 April 1947, even though the primary differences from the single-seat version were limited to a redesigned forward fuselage that accommodated an additional cockpit for the trainee where the armament used to be and a sideways-opening, canopy. The trainer was initially designated as the Yak-Jumo vyvoznoy, but it was eventually designated as the Yak-21 although some documents refer to it as the Yak-15V, Yak-15UT or Yak-21V. Further work on the trainer was cancelled with the success of the trainer version of the Yak-17 with its tricycle undercarriage.Gordon 2002, pp. 51, 64 One Yak-15 was used to test a prototype aerial refueling system in 1949, although the installation on the fighter and the Tupolev Tu-2 bomber used as the tanker were both dummies to test procedures and fit. Yak-17-RD10 On 29 April 1946, five days after the Mikoyan-Gurevich I-300 (MiG-9 Prototype) and the Yak-Jumo made their first flights, the Council of Ministers ordered that the Yakovlev OKB begin design of a new aircraft similar to the Yak-Jumo, using the RD-10 engine with improved aerodynamics. This generally resembled the original aircraft, but the wings were entirely redesigned with laminar flow airfoils, the tail structure was enlarged and an ejection seat was fitted. The back of the seat was armoured and the pilot was also protected by a bulletproof windscreen. The entire canopy was also redesigned to accommodate the new windscreen. The landing gear could not be housed in the thin wings so it was redesigned to retract into the fuselage. Low and high wing loading wing versions were considered, but the low wing loading wings were chosen for the prototype. At an altitude of 5000 meters, the Yak-17-RD10, as the new fighter was designated, was expected to have a top speed of ; a significant improvement over that of the production Yak-15. The aircraft was completed on 3 September and ground tests lasted until 26 September, but it never flew as the Yak-15 had already been ordered into production and its conventional landing gear was already deemed obsolete.Gordon 2002, p. 62 Survivors Only one Yak-15 survives, 'Yellow 37' at the Vadim Zadorozhny Technical Museum outside Moscow.

Its large, hairless, spade-shaped forefeet are adapted for digging. The species is native to Canada (Ontario), Mexico, and the eastern United States, and has the widest range of any North American mole. The species prefers the loamy soils found in thin woods, fields, pastures, and meadows, and builds both deep and shallow burrows characterized by discarded excess soil collected in molehills. Its nest is composed of leaves and grasses, and its two to five young are on their own at about four weeks. Its diet consists principally of earthworms and other soil life, but the eastern mole will also eat vegetable matter. Dogs, cats, foxes, and coyotes prey upon the eastern mole, and the species hosts a variety of parasites. Unlike gophers, moles do not eat vegetation and pose no threat to human concerns; the occasional damage to lawns is offset by the aeration provided the soil and consumption of insects. The construction of golf courses has provided the mole with ideal habitat. The species is abundant, occurs in protected areas, faces no major threats and is of little concern to conservationists.  Description  Skeleton of an Eastern mole The eastern mole is a small, sturdy animal which lives principally underground and is highly specialized for a subterranean way of life. Its body is somewhat cylindrically shaped with an elongated head. A fleshy, moveable snout projecting over the mouth with nostrils on the upper part is used as an organ of touch. The minute, degenerative eyes are hidden in the fur; the eyelids are fused and sight is limited to simply distinguishing between light and dark. The ear opening is small and concealed in the fur, but hearing is fairly acute. A short, thick tail is lightly furred and is used as an organ of touch, guiding the mole when it moves backward in the tunnel. The very large front feet are broader rather than long with well-developed claws, and possess a specialized sesamoid bone attached to the wrist that aids digging. The front feet are normally held in a vertical position with the palms facing outward. Both the front feet and the small hind feet are fringed with sensory hairs that help the mole in its excavations. The bones of the front limbs and the breast are hugely enlarged, and provide strong support for the attached muscles used in digging. The hip girdle is narrow, permitting the mole to turn around in its tunnel by doing a partial somersault or doubling back upon itself. The eastern mole has gay-brown, plush-like fur with paler or browner underparts, and may appear to have a silver sheen depending on the angle it is viewed. The fur offers little resistance to backward movement in the tunnel. Compared to the female, the male tends to have a brighter orange strip on the belly being caused by secretion of skin glands in the region. Albinos occur, but these may appear white, orange, or cinnamon-yellow depending on the skin gland secretion. The face, feet, and tail are whitish to pink. Molting occurs in the spring and fall with the new pelage appearing first on the underparts. On the back, the new fur appears first at the tail, then works forward. A distinct line usually marks the old and new fur, and there is no distinct underfur. The hairs are of equal length and, when viewed microscopically, are seen to possess a whip-like tip, unlike the hairs of any other mammal. The sexes are determined externally by the number of openings in the groin area: the female has three - the forward one is the urinary opening (in the urinary papilla or projection), the second is the vagina, and the third is the anus at the tail. The male has two openings - the combined urinary/reproductive opening in the penis, and the anus. The testes never descend into a scrotum, but remain within the body cavity. There are six teats on the belly - a pair at the chest, a pair at the groin, and a pair between the two. A rank, musky odor is emitted from a scent gland on the belly and is left on the floor of the tunnel as the mole passes. It probably serves as a form of communication between the sexes during the breeding season and to discourage predators. Other scent glands are found at the anus.  Measurements  The eastern mole is about in length including a 3 cm long tail and weighs about . Males collected from various parts of the species' range showed the following extremes in measurements: total length 152‚Äì184mm, tail 22‚Äì30mm, hind foot 18‚Äì21 mm, and females displayed extremes of: total length 144‚Äì16 mm, tail 15‚Äì28 mm, hind foot 18‚Äì21 mm, weight 40‚Äì50 grams. Males are larger than females and males collected in the northern Midwest are the largest of all. Twelve adults from northeastern Florida averaged: total length 142, tail 24.5, hind foot 17.8 mm. In Hillsborough and Pasco Counties in Florida, the eastern mole is still smaller, and in the area north of Tampa Bay, total length does not exceed 140 mm, and the hind foot rarely exceeds 17 mm. The smallest and darkest moles are those found in the Miami area. In Pennsylvania, specimens range in weight from 40 to 64 grams. The tooth count numbers 36 (I3/2; C1/0; P3/3; M3/3), and the chromosome diploid number is 34.  Distribution and habitat  The eastern mole is native to Canada (Ontario), Mexico, and the United States, and has the widest range of any North American mole. In the United States, the species is found from southern South Dakota and southern Wisconsin to eastern Massachusetts and south to the tip of Florida and Louisiana and west to Nebraska, Kansas, and central Texas. It is absent from the Appalachian Mountains, most of Canada, and northern New England. The species is found in the southern tip of Ontario, and northern Tamaulipas, Mexico. Its distribution, however, is patchy. Colonies in southwestern Texas and Coahuila and Tamaulipas, Mexico, are isolated and small. The species prefers well-drained, loose, sandy or loamy soil, and avoids heavy clay, stony or gravelly soils, and very dry or very wet soils. It frequents pastures, open fields, meadows, and thin woods. In some marginal areas, human activities such as the building of roads and golf courses often provide beneficial habitat due to higher quality soils and adequate moisture.  Population characteristics  In a study from 1976, home range areas of seven eastern moles were calculated after each had been located periodically during periods ranging from 11 months to 3 years. The mean home range area was ; males averaged , and females . Because the male range is so large, males generally predominate in samples. The species' fossorial habit tends to limit its dispersal and gene flow, and soil character often limits populations. Eastern moles are good swimmers and not limited by rivers, but heavy clay soils associated with some waterways may limit dispersal. Eastern moles probably have a long lifespan, due to a paucity of predators and a low reproductive rate. The young are grayer than the adults and, with age, the skull flattens and the teeth display wear. Females live longer than males. Longevity has been estimated at 6 years with mark-recapture methods in South Carolina. In Kansas, longevity was estimated at greater than 3.5 years. The eastern mole is common in most of the United States, but populations in southern Texas and Mexico are considered extremely rare and possibly extinct.  Behavior  The species is more abundant in warm climes rather than cool or cold climes, and in the southern United States, cultivated fields will often be riddled with their burrows after a penetrating rain. The eastern mole is active at all hours, with peaks in activity near dawn and at dusk. The length of time between bouts of activity averages about three hours, but may last up to 6.5 h.  Burrowing  Molehill The eastern mole digs both deep, permanent burrows and shallow, temporary ones just under the surface, used for foraging. The regular, permanent highway is often built 25 cm or more below the surface and is used as a retreat during hot, dry weather or when frost has descended. The oxygen levels in the tunnels can be as low as 14.3%, and carbon dioxide as high as 5.5%. During winter, the shallow foraging tunnels tend to be dug deeper underground, unlike those of the star-nosed mole. When digging new burrows, the eastern mole will push excess soil up through vertical shafts called \\"molehills\\". New burrows just below the surface are marked by ridges and molehills, and such burrows appear to be used to facilitate the capture of earthworms and other soil life after a rain. In building burrows and probably at other times, the mole uses its nose as a tactile organ, poking about here and there. In friable soil, the species can burrow at a rate of 6 m/h. The eastern mole's nest is built of leaves and grasses, and is usually situated several inches to a foot or more below the surface. It is typically found beneath a boulder, stump, or bush, and has several approaches, including one that enters from below. Eastern moles in Florida are reported to not build a nest.  Diet  Common earthworm The eastern mole is a voracious predator and will daily consume food equal to 25 to 50% of its weight. In captivity, it will eat almost anything, including ground beef and dog food. In its natural environment, the species principally feeds on earthworms when these are available, but will eat many other foods, including slugs, snails, centipedes, larval and adult insects, scarab beetle grubs, and ants at all their life stages.  Vocalizations  Eastern moles vocalize by making high-pitched squeals, harsh, guttural squeaks and short, snorting sounds and by grating the teeth.  Reproduction  Gestation is usually 45 days and a single litter of two to five young is produced between mid-April and June. In warm climates, the young may be born in March. They are born blind and naked, and are relatively large compared to the size of the mother. At 10 days, they exhibit a fine, velvety light-gray fur which is retained for several weeks. Rapid growth permits the young to leave the nest and fend for themselves at about four weeks.  Survival  Dogs, cats, foxes, and coyotes are some of the predators of the species. The eastern mole harbors many parasites. One hundred four eastern moles taken in Indiana exhibited four species of fleas, one species of sucking louse, one species of beetle, and at least 20 species of mites, several of them entirely new species, with one of them, Scalopacarus, constituting a new genus.  Scientific and common names  Linnaeus Linnaeus based the original description of the species upon a specimen found dead in the water, a fact noted on the collection label. He named the species aquaticus, which is actually a misnomer because this species is the least aquatic of the North American moles. The first part of the scientific name, Scalopus, is from two Greek words which mean \\"digging\\" and \\"foot\\" (skalops, \\"mole\\", derived from the word \\"to dig\\" and pous, \\"foot\\"). The word refers to the species' large front feet, which are used for digging. The second word of the name, aquaticus, is Latin and means \\"found in water\\". The word is misleading but was given to the species because its webbed foot suggested it was accustomed to a water habitat, and the original specimen was found dead in water. The first part of the common name, \\"eastern\\", refers to the species' range, and the second part, \\"mole\\" is from the Middle English molle which, in turn, is related to another Middle English word mold-warpe, which means \\"earth-thrower\\".  Fossils  Fossil remains have been reported from the Upper Ohio Valley in Pennsylvania and West Virginia, and Pleistocene cave faunas in Texas.  Interaction with humans and conservation  Cutworm Eastern moles till and form soil, feed on destructive insects such as cutworms and Japanese beetles, and dig tunnels that aerate the soil and permit moisture to penetrate deeper soil layers. The pelt is small and does not take dyes well; it is thus of no commercial interest to the fur industry. When moles disfigure lawns, damage the roots of garden plants while searching for food or take sprouting corn, they are considered undesirable. In one anecdote, however, a homeowner reported the animal completely eradicated the Japanese beetles on his grounds. The species is listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List because of its wide distribution, presumed large population, occurrence in a number of protected areas, tolerance to some degree of habitat modification, and because it is unlikely to be declining at nearly the rate required to qualify for listing in a threatened category.

It was developed from the Yak-15, the primary difference being tricycle landing gear. The trainer version, known as the Yak-17UTI (NATO reporting name Magnet), was the only Soviet jet trainer of the 1940s. Both aircraft were exported in small numbers and the Yak-17 was soon replaced by the far superior Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15 beginning in 1950. Design and development After the state acceptance trials of the Yak-15 in May 1947 recommended that the aircraft be modified with a tricycle landing gear more suitable for jet-powered aircraft, the Yakovlev design bureau (OKB) began design of the Yak-15U or Yak-15U-RD-10 (uloochshenny - improved). The main gear had to be redesigned to place the wheels behind the aircraft's center of gravity. The main gear was moved behind the front spar, and when retracted filled most of the space between the spars. This caused a major redesign of the fuel tanks and reduced their capacity to just 680 liters (150 gallons). This necessitated the addition of two drop tanks, which hung under the tip of each wing. The addition of the tip tanks required a redesign of the structure of the wing so that the aircraft could still maintain a load bearing of 12g. The vertical stabilizer was enlarged and a periscope was also added above the windscreen on most series aircraft. Armament, systems, and equipment were virtually unchanged.Gunston 1995 Operational history The Yak-17 was first publicly displayed at the Soviet Aviation Day of 1949, at Tushino Airfield. In operation, the Yak-17 had most of the same faults as its predecessor, including relatively low speed and range, and an unreliable engine (still based upon the German Junkers Jumo 004) with a complicated starting procedure. On the other hand, its handling was very simple, and similar to popular propeller fighters such as the Yak-3 and Yak-9. This made it an excellent transitional machine to jet fighters. As a result, the trainer version Yak-17UTI accounted for the majority of production, and almost all series-built Yak-17s were of this tandem, dual-control trainer version, which filled an important need in all Soviet air arms. Surviving Yak-17s can be viewed at the Central Air Force Museum at Monino, outside of Moscow and the Prague Aviation Museum at Kbely Airport, near Prague, Czech Republic. Surviving Yak-17UTIs include one example at the Polish Aviation Museum in Krak√≥w and the Chinese Aviation Museum, near Beijing. Yak-17UTI The most-produced variant of the Yak-17, the Yak-17UTI was a tandem-seat, dual- control trainer. Fuel capacity was greatly reduced, owing to the elimination of the wingtip tanks. Initially it was planned to include a single UBS machine gun, but this was omitted on series-produced aircraft. In the U.S., this aircraft was known as the \\"Type 26\\", and given the ASCC reporting name \\"Magnet\\". Production began in 1948. Total production of all Yak-15 and Yak-17 variants was 717, with the Yak-17UTI the most numerous of all variants of this early Soviet jet.

Once opened each door becomes rigidly connected to some world, but which one can't be predicted. All of the worlds have mostly similar environments and seem to be on the planet Earth but the societies and people are different. After a while Kirill meets a special group of functionals, so called because they gained supernatural abilities making them excellent in some profession. They serve other people, but mostly other functionals. They say Kirill has become one of them ‚Äî a customs officer. He benefits from taxes paid by people who pass through his tower. Also he has superhuman strength and is almost immortal, but only within 10 km of his tower. Kirill enjoys these new worlds, people and abilities. A politician Dima meets him and asks to find a national idea for Russia. He informs Kirill about the world number One, which nobody can access and which seems to be exactly our world living 30 years later. Critical information from this world may enhance the prestige of the country. Kirill also encounters an underground, that is, a few people fighting against the 'corporate laws' of functionals and their working for themselves or the elites of other worlds. He remains untouched by the rhetoric of the underground, justifying most of this. Ideas of armed opposition are alien if not to say ridiculous for him. However, a younger woman whom Kirill falls in love with is a genuine underground activist... The last door opened leads to the world number One: A lovely Moscow filled with smiling people: there were no horrors of revolution and no World War II, as this world lags for 30 years and the rulers of it carefully study the mistakes of other worlds. It's just what Dima proposed to Kirill, but applied in reverse. Upon rather bloody returning to our world, Kirill faces troubles with his girl. Hating the system of functionals, she manifests disobedience. But their laws don't forgive this, and the functional Natalie murders her, Kirill being unable to resurrect her... :\\"An extreme foolishness,\\" said I, \\"All these loud words and beautiful poses... 'they will not pass', 'yet it moves', 'motherland or death', 'am able to die for my beliefs' ‚Äî all of this becomes nonsense when real death comes... All of this is for kids. And for adults who handle them...\\" :Natalie nodded with approval. :\\"But yet it moves\\" said I, \\"Doesn't it? It moves, and they will not pass, and motherland remains motherland even if death becomes death, and nobody is ready to die, but sometimes it's easier to die than to betray...\\" In Kirill's fighting Natalie, his tower becomes devastated, thus he ceases being a functional and is restored to his former life.  Universes in Rough Draft  Rough Draft features a number of alternate universes. The precise number of them is unknown, with the later parts of the book suggesting that there may be many more universes than most Functionals are aware of. The only way to travel between these universes is through watchtowers, which exist in several universes at once (though the way they appear differs with each respective universe). The functionals refer to the universes by official numerical designations and more colloquial nicknames. Those nicknames are not always consistent - for example, functions and their allies tend to refer to Earth 3 by the name of a city-state that's closest to the watchtower they use to get there. *Earth 1 (Arkan) - a universe 35 years \\"behind\\" Earth 2. It's a home universe of the functionals. *Earth 2 (Demos) - Kirill's home universe. It's the most technologically advanced inhabited universe in the \\"Fan\\". Named so for its widespread use of democracy, which is considered to be an archaic form of government in other worlds. *Earth 3 (Veroz) - a world where the humanity lives in numerous city-states scattered throughout the planet. Australia is an unexplored continent and the sea is filled with creatures that are regarded as legendary elsewhere (such as the Kraken). Oil doesn't exist on Earth 3, so steam is a primary power source among the natives. *Earth 4 (Antik) - a world that, in many respects, evokes a Greco-Roman utopia. For example, slaves are allowed to rebel twice a year. If they succeed, they can become free citizens and have their own slaves. *Earth 5 - a world where human beings mate in cycles, coming into heat during the spring. It's more advanced than Earth 3 but less advanced than Earth 2. *Earth 6 (Tverd) - a world dominated by repressive theocracies. The dominant church practices a \\"warped, lethargic\\" version of Christianity. This world is known for comparatively advanced bio-technology and ignorance of electricity. *Earth 14 (Janus) - a world with bitterly cold winters and hot summers. Spring is the only season when the weather is anywhere close to tolerable. This version of Earth has no moon and no magnetic field. Although most functionals assume Earth 14 is uninhabited, a functional Kirill encountered in Final Draft insisted that there was some animal and human life that survived by migrating along with the spring weather. *Earth 16 - a world where Earth changed little over the course of billions of years. It's volcanically active, radioactive, oxygen-poor and generally inhospitable to living organisms, but it is stated in Final Draft that animal-like voices are sometimes heard from there. *Earth 17 (Preserve) - a world completely devoid of human life. It's a popular resort among the Functionals and their allies. *Earth 22 (Nirvana) - a universe with no native animal life. The planet's surface is covered with plants that produce a narcotic substance that puts any human being within proximity into a drugged stupor. Functionals use this universe as a political prison for their enemies. The children born in this universe are more resistant to the effects of the plants than their parents, but they aren't completely immune.

The presence of two oppositely curved vent alignments gives the complex an arc-like shape which reaches heights of about above sea level. Blocky lava flows, some of them quite large, form the bulk of the volcano.

In 2015 the charity published its new five year strategy 'Defeating Brain Tumours' The charity's goals are to double survival of a brain tumour diagnosis within 10 years in the UK, and to halve the harm that brain tumours have on quality of life. History The Brain Tumour Charity, as it is today, was created after the merging of Brain Tumour UK, Samantha Dickson Brain Tumour Trust and the Joseph Foote Trust in 2013. The Samantha Dickson Brain Tumour Trust was started by Neil and Angela Dickson in 1996, who lost their daughter, Samantha, to a brain tumour when she was just 16 years old. They had become aware of the lack of properly funded research into this cancer and were determined to try and remedy the situation. Andy Foote founded The Joseph Foote Fund in 2007 after losing his son, Joseph, to a brain tumour. The Foote family began raising funds for research into the causes and treatment of brain tumours ‚Äì in its 12-year history The Joseph Foote Trust raised more than ¬£2million. In 1997, the UK Brain Tumour Society was founded, which later became Brain Tumour UK. The Brain Tumour Charity has grown rapidly since the merging, funding a diverse portfolio of research programmes, projects and clinical trials across the UK.  Activities = Research and research funding  The Brain Tumour Charity currently fund a portfolio of research across the UK with the aim of doubling survival and reducing long term harm through improving the understand and complexities of brain tumours, better diagnostic techniques and new treatments. To achieve these goals, the charity focuses efforts on five priority areas that the charity believes will have the biggest effect for those affected, reflected in its five-year research strategy, ‚ÄòA Cure Can‚Äôt Wait‚Äô: *Accelerate ‚Äì biobanking to accelerate research progress through centralised collection of, and access to, brain tumour tissue samples. *Diagnose ‚Äì diagnosing brain tumours earlier and more accurately for both children and adults. *Understand ‚Äì increasing understanding of the genetics and biology of tumour development to identify effective new treatments. *Catalyse ‚Äì translating laboratory discoveries into new and effective treatments that increase survival and quality of life. *Enhance ‚Äì enhancing care and quality of life for everyone affected by a brain tumour, including patients and carers. The charity works, has worked, and continues to work with a number of medical and research institutes, laboratories and universities looking for cures to defeat brain tumours, as well as treatments for both adults and children. They also provide funding opportunities in line with the ‚ÄòA Cure Can‚Äôt Wait‚Äô strategy, and award these following competitive peer reviewing processes and assessments made by their independent Grant Review and Monitoring Committee (GRAM).  Support and Information services  The Brain Tumour Charity is the only national brain tumour charity to provide a variety of information and support services which allow people personally affected by brain tumours to access support online, face to face, on the phone or in printed form across the UK, regardless of tumour type, age or location, for both adults and children. The services are focused on improving life today, helping people to live their life well, with improved quality of life The charity's support and information services are available free of charge for everyone affected by a brain tumour, those who have been diagnosed, as well as their family, friends, schools and employers  Raising awareness, policies and campaigns  HeadSmart = The Brain Tumour Charity's primary awareness campaign is HeadSmart: be brain tumour aware. HeadSmart HeadSmart is a multi-award-winning, UK-wide campaign based on research funded by The Brain Tumour Charity at The University of Nottingham (2003-2006). HeadSmart aims to educate the public and healthcare professionals about the signs and symptoms of brain tumours in children and young people, to reduce diagnosis times, to save lives and to reduce long term disability. The campaign's goal is to reduce diagnosis times to four weeks or less in line with NHS targets.About HeadSmart = Raising awareness of brain tumours = The charity campaigns on a range of issues that affect people affected by a brain tumour. They engage with politicians, policy makers and other influential stakeholders within the health sector, including responding to government consultations. The charity also works with like-minded organisations and networks across the UK to better understand local healthcare issues. In 2015 the charity commissioned a research project ‚ÄòLiving with a brain tumour, in partnership with an independent research agency. The research investigated the lived experience of adults with a brain tumour. Two publications have results from the research: *‚ÄòLosing Myself: The Reality of Life with a Brain Tumour‚Äô ‚Äì this report demonstrated the extensive effect that brain tumours have on the daily lives of those affected. *‚ÄòFinding Myself in Your Hands: The Reality of Brain Tumour Treatment and Care‚Äô ‚Äì this report outlined the findings related to respondents‚Äô experiences of their NHS treatment and care = Manifestos = Ahead of the 2015 general elections, The Brain Tumour Charity released a manifesto on brain tumours. It outlined key measures that could help survival outcomes and quality of life for everyone affected by brain tumours in the UK. The charity have also released manifestos ahead of the devolved nation elections in 2016.  Fundraising events  People take part in fundraising events across the UK. Flagship events for The Brain Tumour Charity include The Twilight Walk and #WearItOut for Bandanas for Brain Tumour Awareness Month (every March), which also help to unite the brain tumour community.  Partnerships  The Brain Tumour Charity collaborates with a number of other organisations, including Cancer Research UK, Marie Curie Cancer Care Medical Research Council, Children with Cancer UK, Action Medical Research, and Great Ormond Street Hospital. They have also worked in partnership with Peak, a mobile brain training app Institutions that they have funded include Imperial College London, Institute of Cancer Research, Newcastle University, the University of Nottingham, Queen Mary University of London, University of Birmingham, University College London, University of Glasgow and University of Leeds.

Founded in Liverpool in 1990, it is the only UK charity to focus solely on lung cancer care. The charity has a dual focus - saving lives and supporting people affected by lung cancer. It funds lung cancer research, supports the prevention of lung cancer by encouraging and helping people to avoid or quit smoking, and raises general awareness of lung cancer and its symptoms. It also supports lung cancer patients by running support groups, providing information to the NHS, and other measures.. The organisation was founded as the Lung Cancer Fund in 1990 by Professor Ray Donnelly, a thoracic surgeon working in Liverpool, where it provided the first lung cancer support nurse in 1991. In 1993 Donnelly proposed the creation of an international centre for lung cancer research. At this time UK entertainer Roy Castle had been diagnosed with lung cancer, and he agreed to raise ¬£12 million to build, equip and run the new centre. The Lung Cancer Fund was therefore renamed Roy Castle Lung Cancer Foundation. Castle continued fundraising for the charity until his death in September 1994. The charity has since expanded its operations to include a retail wing operating shops in the Merseyside area. It has funded numerous research projects across UK universities, and provides a research fellowship at the University of Nottingham. In 2011 it raised a total of ¬£2.3 million towards lung cancer prevention and care.. The charity's celebrity supporters include Sir Alex Ferguson, Ricky Gervais, Melanie Chisholm, Duncan Bannatyne, Lynda Bellingham, Tricia Penrose, Jenny Frost, Pete Reed, Katherine Grainger, Robert Peston, Robert Powell, Billy Bragg, and Tony Parsons.

Celtic tomb  The history of Clemency goes back to the 1st century BC when the Treveri, a Celtic tribe, inhabited the region around Titelberg, a large oppidum near Rodange. A Celtic funeral chamber measuring 4.30 m by 4.20 m, the largest Gallic tomb ever found, was discovered in 1987 at Clemency. From the offerings in the tomb, it was obviously the burial place of a Celtic nobleman. These included at least ten wine amphorae, an Italic bronze basin, an oil lamp from Campania, an iron grill and some 30 Gallic pots. There was also a chimney from an iron smelter in the chamber testifying to the deceased's association with iron production.Clemency L'√¢ge du Fer r√©cent from Luxembourg's National Museum of History and Art.

Farming and tourism are the main economic activities on \\"The Mountain\\" as it is fondly called by the locals; Haenertsburg is in hilly terrain. The Iron Crown mountain is the highest point in Limpopo and is a well-known landmark. Frequent mists and relatively high rainfall have created a lush vegetation with afromontane forest patches occupying the kloofs (gullies) which dot the rolling grasslands and surrounding mountains. However, large areas of rare, and botanically very diverse, grassland (Woodbush Granite Grassland) have been planted to timber (primarily timber for pulping). These monoculture plantations extract a great deal of water and the resulting water shortages downstream (in the Kruger National Park and Mozambique) are cause for concern. A local volunteer group, FROHG (Friends of the Haenertsburg Grasslands) helps to conserve the indigenous flora and fauna. Funds are raised to create educational materials, maintain a hiking trail, remove alien invasive plants and alert the authorities to illegal developments like bulldozing for pipelines, fencing and even squatting. The scenic beauty of the Haenertsburg area attracts many tourists. It is a favoured spot for cycling, biking and fishing. Sailing and other watersport take place on nearby Ebenezer Dam.

Galantines are often stuffed with forcemeat, and pressed into a cylindrical shape. Since deboning poultry is thought of as difficult and time-consuming, this is a rather elaborate dish, which is often lavishly decorated, hence its name, connoting a presentation at table that is galant, or urbane and sophisticated. In the later nineteenth century the technique's origin was already attributed to the chef of the marquis de Brancas.As in A. Kettner (pseudonym of Eneas Sweetland Dallas), Kettner's Book of the Table: A Manual of Cookery, 1877. Louis, marquis de Brancas, prince de Nisaro (1672‚Äì1750), had been governor of Provence and French ambassador to Spain; at the end of the Ancien R√©gime his son held the sinecure of governor of Nantes (√âtat militaire de France pour l'ann√©e 1789). In the Middle Ages, the term galauntine or galantyne, perhaps with the same connotations of gallantry,Galantyne was a suitable name for a spirited horse mentioned in Sir William St Loe's accounts 1559‚Äì60 (Mary S. Lovell, Bess of Hardwick, Empire Builder 2005:144, note 3). referred instead to any of several sauces made from powdered galangal root, usually made from bread crumbs with other ingredients, such as powdered cinnamon, strained and seasoned with salt and pepper.

The village Vredenburg was established by the Voortrekkers and renamed Piet Potgietersrust after the slain Voortrekker leader Piet Potgieter. The town name was changed to Mokopane in 2003 in honour of a local Northern Ndebele leader, King Mgombane Gegana, who ruled the area before being conquered by the Voortrekkers. Mokopane is the Northern Sotho form of the king‚Äôs name, and is hence erroneous, even though the majority language in the area is Northern Sotho. Two hours from Gauteng by road, the town acts as a getaway destination and as a stop-over for travelers en route to Botswana, Zimbabwe and Kruger National Park. The area is typical bushveld with many Vachellia and Senegalia trees (formerly part of the acacia genus) as well as aloes, which blooms in June and July. History The historic and archaeologically significant Makapansgat caves are situated 15 km north of the town. Recovery of Homo habilis habitation has been made at these caves.Nick Norman and Gavin Whitfield, De Beers Consolidated Mines (2006) Geological Journeys: A Traveller's Guide to South Africa's Rocks and Landforms.

Culture The stunning bushveld environment and influences from North Sotho, Ndebele, Tsonga, Afrikaans and English cultures give Mokopane a unique character. There are also ancient caves, the \\"Big Five\\", San rock paintings, curios, bushveld food and drinks such as biltong (dried meat) and mampoer (a potent alcoholic drink), tropical gardens and traditional dancing. In the adjacent township of Mahwelereng traditional lifestyles, set against the spectacular Waterberg, can be observed. Mokopane also offers outdoor activities ranging from hiking, camping and 4 √ó 4 trails to birding, angling and game viewing. Economy The economy of Mokopane used to be primarily based on agriculture, until the opening of Anglo American's platinum mine. Currently the mine is the biggest contributor to the local economy. Recently there has been interest displayed by other mining companies to start up, but community resistance around mining remains the main reason for the slow growth in mining. The Mokopane area is one of South Africa's richest agricultural areas, producing wheat, tobacco, cotton, beef, maize, peanuts and citrus. The area around Mokopane is rich in minerals with the mining of platinum, diamonds and granite.

It is the primary means by which high-voltage transmission lines are reserved for moving wholesale quantities of electricity. The OASIS concept was originally conceived with the Energy Policy Act of 1992, and formalized in 1996 through Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) Orders 888 and 889. Before OASIS Electric utility systems in North America developed over time as regulated monopolies, jurisdictional utilities given rights to own and operate transmission and distribution networks in a given geographical area along with the responsibility to serve all loads in that same area. At first, utility companies generally served their own system load demand by building local power generation facilities within their systems. Social, economic, and ecological influences later led to new arrangements where a utility company might enter into long-term power purchase or sale agreements with neighboring utility companies, or locate new generation facilities outside of their system and enter into long-term agreements for transmission rights to deliver that energy to their own system. In the short-term world of day-to-day operations, utility companies would agree to \\"preschedule\\" (day ahead) or \\"real time\\" (same day or next hour) energy transactions with adjacent companies to supplement their own generation asset capabilities. Vertically Integrated Utilities As utility companies began integrating their operations in more complex ways with their neighbors, they evolved into a vertical organizational structure with three tiers: Generation, Transmission, and Scheduling. On a day-to-day or day-ahead operational level these functions might be performed by three or more people at large utilities, but might be combined into a single employee's job at a small utility. The size of the back office support for each function varies greatly depending upon the size of the utility. =Generation= The generation group manages the maintenance and operations of generation assets, with an eye on the future regarding when, where and how much generation assets will need to be developed to keep up with future demand. =Transmission= The transmission group concerns itself with maintaining the high voltage transmission system and lower voltage distribution system. As load demands increase or new generation assets come online in their systems, they upgrade existing facilities or construct new transmission corridors to maintain the reliable delivery of energy. =Scheduling= The scheduling group is responsible for ensuring that there is adequate power supply to meet the demand of the customer load on a day-to- day and hour-to-hour basis, and also for procuring resources to meet long term needs. These resources can be procured through the generation group, or through purchases and sales with other companies. Internal Customers Unlike a typical residential or commercial/industrial customer, large bulk users of electricity such as mills, mines and large factories generally have the opportunity to negotiate the rates they will pay their supplier for electricity. In some cases they might even have their own generation assets as well. If they chose to use their supplier's generation instead of their own, they might also be required to pay a fee for the transmission to deliver it, since that transmission might be built specifically to serve their needs. Fees for services provided by the transmission group were defined in a pro forma tariff, a document the transmission group supplied that detailed requirements and responsibilities for the purchaser and provider, and definitions and costs of the types of transmission services available. Impact of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 The Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPAct) laid the initial foundation for the eventual deregulation of the North American electricity market. This Act called for utility companies to allow external entities fair access to the electric transmission systems in North America. The act's intent was to allow large customers (and in theory, every customer) to choose their electricity supplier and subsequently pay for the transmission to deliver it from the generation to serve their load. Based on the premise that new generating facilities would be allowed fair access to their regional transmission system, and precipitated by the EPAct of 1992, construction of new independently owned generation assets began in response to the development of the North American electricity market. Recognizing competition was coming, electric utility companies began modifying their scheduling functions by forming affiliated Power Marketing departments. Similarly, financial trading interests and existing energy companies (outside of electricity) saw the opportunities in the emerging electricity market and began to organize unaffiliated power marketing divisions. With open access, anyone with the proper resources and/or creditworthiness could purchase the rights to generation, move it across the transmission network (provided adequate capacity was available), and deliver it to a place of higher demand. Following passage of the EPAct of 1992, independent generation owner/operators (also called independent power producers or IPPs) and unaffiliated power marketers lodged frequent complaints with FERC about unfair treatment under the new open access requirements. The complaints generally followed the same theme: vertically integrated electric utility companies would favor their own affiliated power marketing division over external parties trying to move power on the system. In many cases, the power marketers operated side by side with the transmission operators (or it might even be the same person) and there were no rules to prevent unfair treatment of external transmission system users. FERC Orders 888 and 889 To protect and promote generation competition and also enforce fair treatment of external users of the transmission system, FERC issued Order 888 and Order 889 on April 24, 1996. The EPAct of 1992 was the beginning of electric deregulation in North America, but Orders 888 and 889 marked the point where the trading of electricity gained a firm foothold. Order 888, the \\"Open Access\\" order Order 888's primary objective was to establish and promote competition in the generation market, by ensuring fair access and market treatment of transmission customers. FERC outlined six points to accomplish this goal: * Require all jurisdictional utilities (within the United States) to file an open-access transmission tariff (OATT) * Require investor-owned utilities (IOU's) to functionally unbundle wholesale generation and power marketing from transmission services * Create Independent System Operators (ISO's) and operating guidelines * Encourage reciprocity for non-jurisdictional (i.e., municipalities and cooperatives) utilities16 U.S.C. 824(f) * Allow utilities to recover stranded costs * Identify ancillary services and comparable services to properly operate the bulk power system One fairly immediate result of this order was the functional separation and isolation of the power schedulers and power marketers within vertically integrated utilities from their company's area of transmission operations. Affiliated power marketers could no longer work alongside the transmission operators who were charged with treating them and external parties equally, and at the same time affiliated power marketers would no longer have any \\"inside information\\" on the availability of the transmission system nor the transactions being scheduled on it. Order 889, the \\"Standards of Conduct\\" order Order 889 went to great lengths to detail exactly how all participants in the electricity market should interact with transmission providers. It laid out the structure and function of what became known as OASIS \\"nodes,\\" which are secure, web-based interfaces to each transmission system's market offerings and transmission availability announcements. Each OASIS node was to be the single point of information dissemination to the market as well as the customer portal for transmission service requests (TSR), even for affiliated power marketers wanting access to their own parent company's transmission. OASIS Nodes OASIS nodes are entirely web-based, and public access is limited. Power marketers that become signatories to a transmission provider's OATT gain more complete access so they can view existing transmission and service availability and existing service requests made by other parties. There are also market observers who have read-only access, who may view activity but not request services. Transmission facilities have power transfer limits that must be maintained to allow the power grid to operate reliably. Transmission operators perform system studies in various future time frames to determine how much transfer capacity is required to serve their own \\"native load\\", and how much capacity must remain as a buffer to prevent unscheduled or accidental overflows that can damage high voltage equipment. The difference between the capacity needed to serve load and to maintain safe flow margins can be made available for purchase on the OASIS node. Unplanned outages and other system emergencies can adversely impact the total power transfer capability across transmission systems, and it sometimes becomes necessary for transmission providers to curtail power flows across the system by revoking transmission rights given to buyers on the OASIS. Some transmission buyers are willing to pay higher rates to avoid having their transactions curtailed, and as such transmission companies offer different priorities of transmission service at varying rates. The least expensive type of transmission is generally \\"non-firm\\" and purchased on an hour to hour basis. Daily non-firm is a slightly higher priority (because the buyer committed to purchasing all day), and increments go up from there to weekly, monthly, seasonally, yearly, or longer with the cost for each also rising incrementally. \\"Firm\\" transmission services are even more expensive, but are the last transactions to be curtailed. Even before the appearance of the OASIS nodes, many groups of transmission owners had already turned over operational control of their collective bulk transmission systems to Independent System Operators of various forms. These ISO's offered OASIS access to their collective systems very early on, so that it was often possible to make a single OASIS transmission service request that could cross multiple transmission systems. Since the inception of OASIS, and under the prodding of FERC to move transmission assets under the control of ISO's, the number of OASIS nodes is decreasing as ISO's assume control of transmission systems and consolidate their related OASIS functions. OASIS impacts After the doors opened to allow power marketers to move their electricity purchases across multiple transmission systems, many transmission operators saw their transmission systems loaded to much higher levels. Even though transmission services are generally obtained \\"point-to-point\\", in actuality power flows divide among numerous paths according to the properties of electricity and thus the actual energy flows follow the path of least resistance. A result of the long distance electricity transactions being scheduled was the impact of \\"loop flows\\" caused by energy flowing on these alternate paths. Transmission system operators were faced with a dilemma: The problems were often being caused by external influences, and the only way available to them to reduce the stress on the transmission system was to curtail their own transmission sales. This resulted in a loss of revenue and still did not always solve the overloading problems. The North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) stepped in to address this new problem that threatened the North American power grid by introducing the NERC Tagging application. NERC Tags captured entire transactions from beginning to end. This let them string together all the transmission legs obtained on various OASIS nodes, and then determine how the total schedule impacted transmission systems, and what priorities of transmission were used in the schedule. This let them determine which schedules should be curtailed to relieve loading on transmission systems. NERC also assumed initial control of the Transmission System Information Networks (TSIN), a database of electric power system data. In 2012 the North American Energy Standards Board (NAESB), an industry council, assumed responsibility https://www.naesb.org//pdf4/registry_transfer_update_080911.pdf for TSIN. It is now the \\"OATI Web Registry\\" and requires that users be registered. The registry is a web-based database containing a comprehensive listing of generation points, transmission facilities and delivery points as well as transmission and generation priority definitions with regard to the applications that use it (the various OASIS nodes as well as the NERC Tagging application).

Many of the poems featured in Seven Poems and a Fragment, The Cat and the Moon and Certain Poems, and October Blast released by Cuala Press. Other poems had been collected in A Vision. Cover design Yeats commissioned Thomas Sturge Moore to create the cover for the volume in 1927. The gold wood-cut style image depicts Thoor Ballylee and its reflection in waters below the tower all on a light green background. The poet praised Moore's artwork, noting that the cover was both a true representation of Thoor Ballylee and a successful symbolic design for the collection. Moore's work on The Tower and other collections solidified Yeats's modern image in both American and English print editions Literary Topics and Content Many of the poems in The Tower demonstrate Yeats's disillusionment with the limitations of the physical world and his withdrawal from ordinary life. The poet seeks to transcend the conflicts between the dichotomies of mind/body and thought/action by allowing poetry to exist in the world of vision rather than the world of reality.

Overview Designed by Capt. R. S. Gammon of the 1st Parachute Regiment, the Gammon bomb was developed as a replacement for the temperamental and highly dangerous \\"sticky bomb\\" grenade. It consisted of an elasticized stockinette bag made of dark coloured material, a metal cap, and an \\"allways\\" fuze, the same fuze as was found in the No. 69 grenade and No. 73 grenade. The Gammon bomb or grenade was an \\"improvised hand-thrown bomb used by the Home Guard, the Special Air Service and the Resistance, especially suitable for the destruction of parked aircraft or vehicles. An explosive charge was wrapped in fabric and sewn to an impact fuse that detonated on sharp contact\\". Unlike conventional grenades, the Gammon bomb was flexible in the amount and type of munition that could be delivered to a target. For anti-personnel use, a small amount of plastic explosive (about half a stick), along with shrapnel-like projectiles, if available, would be placed in the bag. Against armoured fighting vehicles or other armoured targets, the bag could be completely filled up with explosives, making an unusually powerful grenade which could only be thrown safely from behind cover. Using the Gammon bomb was very simple. After filling the stockinette bag with explosive, the screw-off cap was removed and discarded. Removing the screw-off cap revealed a stout linen tape wound around the circumference of the fuze. The linen tape had a curved lead weight on the end. While holding the lead weight in place with one finger (to prevent the linen tape from unwinding prematurely) the grenade was then thrown at the target. When the Gammon grenade was thrown, the weighted linen tape automatically unwrapped in flight, pulling out a retaining pin from the fuze mechanism. Removal of the retaining pin freed a heavy ball-bearing and striker inside the fuze, which was then held back from the percussion cap only by a weak creep spring. In this manner the allways fuze became armed in flight. Impact with the target gave the heavy ball-bearing a sharp jolt - overcoming the weak resistance of the creep spring - that slammed the striker against the percussion cap. The percussion cap fired directly into the adjacent detonator, which in turn sent a violent shockwave into the main explosive filling contained inside the stockinette bag. Detonation of a Gammon grenade was instantaneous on impact with the target, i.e. there was no time-delay. Gammon bombs were primarily issued to special forces such as paratroopers who were issued plastic explosive routinely. These units found the Gammon bomb to be particularly useful due to its small size and weight when unfilled, as well as its adaptability. It was even effective against armoured vehicles, and paratroopers called it their \\"hand artillery\\". It was also popular as a small amount of the C2 fast-burning explosive could heat a mug of coffee or K-rations without giving off any smoke from the bottom of a foxhole. Gammon bombs were declared obsolete in the early 1950s, at which point all existing stocks were destroyed. Typically, any examples encountered today are in the form of unexploded ordnance or inert examples held in museum collections.

Founded in 1974, the name of the Fund is in honour of the Battle of Britain's Air Chief Marshal the Lord Dowding, a past President of the National Anti-Vivisection Society. To date, the Fund has awarded grantsSome Past LDF successes http://www.ldf.org.uk/research/49/51/287/ approaching ¬£2 million to researchers working in a wide range of research fields including microsurgery, toxicity testing of dental fillings, breast and lung cancer, product safety testing, Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, cot deaths, cataracts, kidney research, cell culture, computer-aided drug design, biotechnology, brain damage and computer teaching packages which replace the use of animals in education of students at school and university level. LDF grant around ¬£300,000 per year for projects LDF projects http://www.ldf.org.uk/research/49/51/0/ which show that medical progress is possible without the use of animals. LDF recognises that modern research techniques offer superior replacements to animal procedures. The major advantage is that, without the use of animals, there are no problems of species differences; the results can be directly applied to the human condition. LDF therefore aims to: * Support and fund better methods of scientific and medical research for testing products and curing disease which replace the use of animals. * Fund areas of fundamental research which lead to the adoption of non-animal research methodology. * Fund, promote and assist medical, surgical, and scientific research, learning, and educational training and processes for the purpose of replacing animals in education and training * Promote and assist any research for the purpose of showing that animal research is harmful or unnecessary to humanity. The LDF publishes a magazine New Science,New Science: issue 1 http://www.ldf.org.uk/research/49/71/1158/ exploring the latest developments in the world of research without animals, as well as featuring reports on the research they fund. They are also a member of Focus on Alternatives, a coalition established in 1998 for organizations funding non-animal scientific and medical research to work together. Studying neurological disorders The LDF has committed funding until the end of the decade towards running costs of the functional Magnetic Resonance Images (fMRI) scanning facility at Aston University. The fMRI scanner is twice as powerful as those found in hospitals, so allows detailed study of the human brain. Whilst animal researchers study neurological disorders in primates, this facility shows that it is better to use non-invasive methods to study people; results are more reliable and avoid the potentially catastrophic consequences of species differences. Aston was the first site in the UK to marry both MEG (employing the UK's only whole-head Magnetoencephalography system) and fMRI, putting the Academy of Life Sciences at the forefront of world scientific endeavour. fMRI can be combined with MEG scanning to increase understanding of the human brain by enabling researchers to clearly track, in human volunteers, not just which areas of the brain are active, but when. Unlocking the secrets of human neurotoxicity In another department at Aston University, the LDF is supporting the work of Dr Michael Coleman to develop new methods for studying neurotoxicity. Neurotoxicity, or nerve toxicity, is a potential side-effect of new drugs. By studying which substances cause neurotoxicity and why, we can gain clues about illnesses such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Motor Neurone Disease. Most neurotoxicity research is carried out on some two million rodents and over 10,000 primates every year but the LDF is supporting research using human brain cells grown in culture. So far, Dr Coleman and his team have focused on creating a model for a group of cells known as the astrocytes ‚Äì human brain cells which protect nerves in the CNS from toxins or injury. These cells may play a crucial role in neurodegenerative disease but there has been no model on which to perform tests ‚Äì but this may be about to change. Dr Coleman's team has identified three human cell lines which might act as a suitable model for the astrocytes ‚Äì in preliminary tests all behave similarly to astrocytes. Tackling a hospital killer Over the past 20 years, Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome, or MODS, has emerged as a leading cause of death among critically ill patients in intensive care units. Triggered by an excessive and uncontrolled response to illness or injury, MODS causes organs to dysfunction gradually over a period of weeks or even days. Of those affected, 90% of adults and 54% of children die. Conventional MODS research has entailed forcing rats and mice to endure this excruciating disease. However, the LDF is supporting the development of a technique that makes use of artificially grown human tissue. Dr Karl Wooldridge, of the University of Nottingham, and his team have created an artificial human Blood Brain Barrier ‚Äì a defence mechanism set up by blood vessels to protect the brain. They have subjected this to known MODS-causing organisms, to study how the disease takes hold and develops. Replacements for animals in education for China & India Computer simulations by Professor David Dewhurst with LDF funding have saved tens of thousands of animals from being used in education every year in the UK alone. The simulations replace the animals in university science practicals. The LDF is currently supporting the development of these programmes to enable teachers to assemble their own teaching materials on-line. This will include upgrades of existing tools and programmes in different languages.

He is known for fostering and adopting the Young British Artists, many of whom he taught, and for his conceptual artwork, An Oak Tree. He is Emeritus Professor of Fine Art at Goldsmiths.Goldsmiths College staff list; retrieved 25 January 2011. His memoir and advice for the aspiring artist, On Being An Artist, was published by London-based publisher Art / Books in April 2015. Early life and career Michael Craig-Martin was born in Dublin, but spent most of his childhood in Washington, D.C. For eight years he attended a Roman Catholic school which was run by nuns, followed by the English Benedictine Priory School (now St. Anselm's Abbey School), where pupils were encouraged to look at religious imagery in illuminated glass panels and stained-glass windows.Cork, Richard (2006). Michael Craig-Martin, p. 17, Thames & Hudson: London; ; . He gained an interest in art through one of the priests, who was an artist, and was also strongly impressed by a display in the Phillips Collection of work by Mark Rothko. Craig-Martin studied in the Lyc√©e Fran√ßais in Bogot√°, Colombia, where his father had employment for a while. Drawing classes in the Lyc√©e by an artist, Antonio Roda, gave him a wider perspective on art. His parents had no inclinations towards art, although they did have on display in their home Picasso's Greedy Child.Cork, Richard, p. 18. Back in Washington, he attended drawing classes given there by artists, then in 1959 attended Fordham University in New York for English Literature and History, while also starting to paint. In mid-1961 Craig-Martin studied art at the Acad√©mie de la Grande Chaumi√®re in Paris, and in the autumn he began a painting course at Yale University, where the teaching was strongly influenced by the multi-disciplinary experimentation and minimalist theories on colour and form of Josef Albers, a former head of department. Craig-Martin later said, \\"Everything I know about colour comes from that course\\". Tutors on the course included artists Alex Katz and Al Held. Work Michael Craig Martin (left), and Keith Milow at the \\"varnishing day\\") R.A. summer exhibition 2015 Craig-Martin has lived and worked in London since 1966. From his early box-like constructions of the late 1960s he moved increasingly to the use of ordinary household objects. In the late 1970s he began to make line drawings of ordinary objects, creating over the years an ever-expanding vocabulary of images which form the foundation of his work to this day. During the 1990s the focus of his work shifted decisively to painting, with the same range of boldly outlined motifs and vivid color schemes applied both to works on canvas, and to increasingly complex installations of wall paintings. An Oak Tree In 1973, he exhibited the seminal piece An Oak Tree. The work consists of a glass of water standing on a shelf attached to the gallery wall next to which is a text using an argument to explain why it is in fact an oak tree. Nevertheless, on one occasion when it was barred by Australian Customs officials from entering the country as vegetation, he was forced to explain it was really a glass of water. The work was bought by the National Gallery of Australia in 1977, and the Tate gallery has an artist's copy. Young British Artists In the 1980s Craig-Martin was a tutor at Goldsmiths College, Department of Art, and was a significant influence on the emerging YBA generation, including Damien Hirst. He was also helpful in promoting the Freeze show to established art-world figures. In 1995 he curated Drawing the Line: a comprehensive touring exhibition on the history of line drawing for the Southbank Centre, London.Collection: Michael Craig- Martin British Council.

In 2006, the Irish Museum of Modern Art presented \\"Michael Craig-Martin: Works 1964‚Äì2006\\" which included works from over 40 years of Craig-Martin's career. The exhibition showed around 50 paintings, sculptures, wall drawings, neon works and text pieces by the artist, covering everything from his sculptures to digital works. One of his works called On the Table (1970) involved four metal buckets suspended on a table, exemplifying the influence of Minimalism and Conceptualism on Craig-Martin. An Oak Tree (1973), consisting of \\"an ordinary glass of water on an equally plain shelf, accompanied by a text in which Craig-Martin asserts the supremacy of the artist's intention over the object itself ... is now widely regarded as a turning point in the development of conceptual art\\". In 2015, Craig-Martin's exhibition \\"Transience\\" at the Serpentine Galleries brought together works from 1981 to 2015, including representations of once familiar yet obsolete technology; laptops, games consoles, black-and-white televisions and incandescent lightbulbs that highlighted the increasing transience of technological innovation.

It is part of the canton of Luxembourg. In 2016, Strassen's population counted 8500 citizens. The current mayor of Strassen is Gaston Greiveldinger (LSAP socialists).  History  Strassen was formed on 6 January 1851, when it was detached from the commune of Bertrange. The law forming Strassen was passed on 6 August 1849. The origins of the town began in Roman times. The name of Strassen comes from the Latin \\"strata,\\" which means military road. In Roman times, the Roman road led from Trier through Arlon Strassen and Mamer upwards. Remains of the road were found in 1960 during the widening of Kiem Street. The seal of Johann Strassen (1411) and religious piety dating from 1500 (currently on display at the National Museum of the State), provided the basis for the municipal coat of arms created in 1976 and hieraldic description of \\"Cloche d'or\\". Due to a historical plague, one-third of the population of Strassen disappeared. With the cadastral maps during the time of Maria Theresia (1766) the area of Strassen was 2594.65 acres and the population was 417. Strassen, along with some houses in Reckenthal, became a parish in 1804. In 1823 the town of Strassen was united with the town of Bertrange, but by a law of August 6, 1849, Strassen was again separated from Bertrange effective 1 January 1850. Thus it became a separate municipality from Reckenthal. At that time, the population consisted of 1300. In 1850, natives of Luxembourg including some from Strassen, began to emigrate to the United States, The emigrants from Luxembourg started experiencing a high death rate in the US, which discouraged further emigration. In 1854 the national poet Michel Rodange married a citizen of Strassen, by the name of Leysen Magdalene and they moved to Fels where he was a teacher. The first water main was laid in 1908. For an entire century, the population did not change much. Strassen in 1946 had 1400 citizens and 332 houses. In 1960 there were 1900 inhabitants and 20 years later 4200. On 1 January 1997 there were about 5000 inhabitants in . Populated places The commune consists of the following villages: * Strassen * Reckenthal (lieu-dit) - partly shared with the city commune of Luxembourg  Urbanism  Strassen is considered to be one of the smallest communes of the country. Due to a strong increase of Luxembourg's population, new districts are seeing the day in Strassen. Strassen has been classified as the 3rd most expensive commune in Luxembourg. In fact, you have to count to spend on average 7 592 euro/m2 on recent real estate goods. Strassen is also appreciated from the expatriates, given its proximity with Luxembourg City, and its quality of life. As in many other communes in Luxembourg, Strassen has a private aquatic center (built in October 2009) named Les Thermes, with a cost of ‚Ç¨37,000,000. Luxembourg's national center of archery and the national center of martial arts are also located in Strassen.  Culture  In September the biennial Stroossefestival takes part in central Strassen, with performances, food stalls, and attractions for all ages.  Transport  Like elsewhere in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, public transport is effective and fast. There are buses (ecological hybrids) that connect to Luxembourg City. Strassen has provided for its citizens, a city night shuttle bus service.  Education  In the municipal area, there are 4 schools, all modern and well equipped. In primary school, students lessons are in the three official languages of the country. The primary in Luxembourgish and the secondary language is German, while studying the prospect of having the second language cycle in French and the third language cycle in English.

B. Yeats, published in 1933. It was the next new volume after 1928's The Tower. (The title poem was originally published in 1929 by Fountain Press in a signed limited edition, which is exceedingly rare.) The title is linked to the staircase in an old Norman tower in County Galway which Yeats bought and gave it the Gaelicized name Thoor Ballylee castle; Yeats would spend the summers there for about a decade, beginning in 1919. He saw the castle as a vital connection to the aristocratic Irish past which he admired. This volume capitalizes on the symbolic potential of the tower while examining the tower from the convoluted spaces within in. The Tower and The Winding Stair are two collections which are carefully parallel with opposing points of view. The two volumes and their poems share the complementary symbols of Thoor Ballylee and the winding stair within. Six of the poems in the latter volume were written before the publication of the former, therefore they are often discussed as a single unit. In a complete turnaround from his bleak outlook of eternity expressed in his previous volume (which the poet admitted that he was 'astonished at its bitterness'), Yeats now ponders over the possibility and desire of reincarnation after death. Yeats was in poor health during this period; In a letter to Olivia Shakespeare, Yeats admitted that 'Perhaps if [he] was in better health [he] should be content to be bitter'. Though this volume includes more poems than The Tower, its contents are generally less well-known and thus less frequently anthologized. Among the best-known and anthologized are \\"A Dialogue of Self and Soul\\" and \\"Byzantium.\\" \\"Byzantium\\" is a sequel to \\"Sailing to Byzantium\\" (from The Tower), meant to better explain the ideas of the earlier poem. An important insight on Yeats's concern of death lay in the poem \\"Byzantium\\" which further exploits the contrast of the physical and spiritual form and the final stanza concludes by differentiating the two. Yeats displays his desire for spiritual wisdom in this poem as he creates a path on earth to the spiritual world; he does this through the image of the dolphin's constant trip between the physical and spiritual worlds. This poem not only shows the poet's change of belief but also provides him with the comfort he desired while aging as he concludes with the vivid image of the spiritual world being connected with the sea of life. The indecisive questions posed in \\"Sailing to Byzantium\\" are answered in \\"A Dialogue\\" where Yeats chose reincarnation rather than resting in eternity. Yeats reflects upon the paradoxical reality of life whereby he uses two figures, 'Self' and 'Soul' to represent his opposed attitudes towards life and death. \\"A Dialogue\\" opens with 'Soul' climbing up the 'winding ancient stair' which portrays the progression through life and the descent to non-existence. Yeats's view of heaven and religion is quite different at this point as he became more intrigued by Buddhist thought which can be seen throughout this poem in particular. Very different to his previous interpretation in The Tower, he now portrays the kind of afterlife he sought in \\"Sailing to Byzantium\\" as a dark and 'breathless' eternity. Self is given the final word, which includes an affirmation of temporal life, a preparedness to 'live it all again'.

Whereas Islam accounts for 89.1% of the country's religion, followed by Hinduism at 10%.  History  The Portuguese Church in Old Chittagong, the seat of the Bishop of Chittagong Dhaka's Armenian Church, built in 1781 The introduction and development of Christianity in the Indian Subcontinent can be traced back to several different periods, with the help of several different countries and denominations. The earliest connection to Christianity can be linked back to the arrival of the Apostle Thomas to the Malabar Coast during the first century, in 52 A.D. In addition, the Apostle had managed to convert several thousands of Hindu Brahmins, as they were \\"attracted\\" to the lifestyle and were \\"impressed\\" by Jesus' sacrifice. Christianity did not have a presence in Bangladesh until the arrival of the Portuguese in 1510 with individuals like Alfonso de Albuquerque and Portuguese missionaries. Albuquerque attempted to spread Christianity by encouraging inter-marriage with native Bengali women, therefore their descendants were the first generations of Christians. By 1514, the Portuguese had obtained the right to preach Christianity in Bengal, thanks to the agreement between the Catholic Pope and the King of Portugal. In 1672, Dome Antonio da Rozari, a young Bengali convert, had managed to convert 20,000 low-caste Hindus into Christianity. Afterwards, between the seventeenth and eighteenth century, Portuguese missionaries were evangelising and preaching in the Bengali language. Soon on, evangelical books and Christian theology were being written in Bengali. In 1740, the first Protestant, Reverend John Zachariah Kiernander, arrived in Bangladesh. In 1770, he funded and built a Protestant Church called \\"Mission Church\\" in West Bengal. By the 18th century, British missionaries, such as William Carey, had built more churches, translated the Bible and other Christian books, and had set up religious schools. The British missionaries had also developed Christian newspapers (such as \\"Digdarshan\\", \\"The Gospel Magazine\\", and \\"The Christian Mohila\\") in an effort to spread the gospel. In more recent times, the rise of Christianity in Bangladesh can be credited to Western NGOs and Christian charities, who provided humanitarian work after the Liberation War in 1971. Since then, these NGOs and charities (see Contributions) have not only assisted with support for emergency relief, healthcare, and education in Bangladesh, but they have also encouraged the practice of reading the Bible. Currently, it is estimated that there are approximately 17 000 to 23 000 NGOs in Bangladesh.  History of churches  During the month of January in 1600, the first church was officially inaugurated. The church was named \\"The Church of the Holy Name of Jesus\\" and was built by the Jesuits, who were not only given permission, but also financial support and land by the King of Jessore. The second church was financially supported by the Arakanese King and was built by Andre Boves on June 24, 1600. This church was built in Chittagong and was called \\"St. John the Baptist Church\\". In 1601, the third church was built by Dominicans in the south-east of Chittagong. Eventually these churches were burnt down from the attacks by the Arakanese.  William Carey and missionaries  According to Sufia M. Uddin, William Carey can be seen as \\"one of the most important early Christian missionary figures\\". Carey had arrived in Bangladesh in 1773, where he was financially supported by the Baptist Missionary Society to carry out missionary work. William Carey believed his success as a missionary, was due him learning the Bengali language and therefore being able to translate the gospel. In 1801, he was able to publish a translation of The New Testament, which was the first translation in any South Asian language. Carey then published a Bengali dictionary (\\"A Dictionary of the Bengali language\\") that same year and was also appointed as a professor at Fort William College. Carey, with the assistance of Joshua Marshman and William Ward created Serampore College. Carey's colleagues and missionary team built a Bengali boys' school and by 1817, they were operating 45 boys' schools. As for girls, in 1818 they opened their first Bengali girls' school and by 1824, they were running 6 girls' schools. These mission-run schools would often attract students with scholarships and accommodation. Carey also oversaw the works the Bible being translated into more than 34 Indian languages, while the missionaries wrote books and tracts favouring the Christian lifestyle. These books and tracts (such as \\"Prophet's Testimony in Christ\\", \\"God's Punishment of Sin\\", and \\"Krishna and Christ Compared\\") not only emphasised the benefits of Christian life, but they also condemned Hindu and Islamic beliefs. More specifically, Christian missionaries translated the works of the Prophet Muhammad to use in their books to attack Islam, as they claimed it was a \\"false religion\\".  Female missionaries  In 1822, Miss Mary Anne Cooke was the first English women missionary. Prior to this in 1820, missionary William Ward had encouraged for English women to preach Christianity, in order to connect more with Bengali women. With help from the Christian Missionary Society, Cooke founded 15 girls' schools with around 300 students within the Calcutta area. Sister Argerita Bellasiny, Sister Brigida Janella, and Sister Agostina Bigo from Italy were called upon Father Marietti on May 17, 1868 to help with missionary outreach. The three of them would spread Christianity by going door to door, particularly targeting poor and vulnerable widows.  Missionaries' main objectives  The missionaries had 5 main targets: 1\\\\. They must convert any non-Christian family member in a Christian family. 2\\\\. They must not move onto another village, until everyone at the current village that they're currently evangelising at, has converted. 3\\\\. Evangelistic campaigns should occur at least twice a year. 4\\\\. To focus on the village leaders, even if they're not literate. 5\\\\. The book \\"24 Bible stories\\" should be used as training for training leaders. For a Muslim to convert, they are instructed to take oath, while kneeling on the Quran and holding the Bible in their hands. They are required to pledge \\"By the name of Jesus, from today I enter the fold of Christianity, leaving Islam forever, and by the name of Jesus, I will not reveal the secrets of my conversion to others until the one-third population of my society is converted to Christianity.\\"  First Christian martyr  Father Francisco Fernandez was the first martyr in Bangladesh, he died on 14 November 1602. He was led to his death because he had attempted to save Christian women and children from being captured and used as slaves by the Arakanese. He was detained, chained, and beaten to death. Contributions Christians have greatly served the education and health sectors. This tiny community has some 1000 schools and about 100 health care centers and hospitals. In Bangladesh, the Christian community runs the country's largest cooperative bank in Dhaka. Having worked in Bangladesh as a missionary since 1952, Father Richard William Timm, C.S.C. won the Ramon Magsaysay Award for Peace and International Understanding, the Asian Nobel Prize, in 1987 in recognition of his work as a teacher, as a biologist studying plant-parasitic worms, and with Caritas on relief efforts. In the 1990s, many people opposed the aid of Christian NGOs, and therefore there was a spike in the number of protests and violence opposing the religious influence of Christian NGOs. Up to 52 NGOs were considered to be \\"anti-Islamic\\", with the intentions of \\"proselytising\\" the Islamic nation to Christianity, targeting the vulnerable; the outcasts, the uneducated, and the poor.  Christian Memorial Hospital (Malumghat)  In 1965, The Church of Bangladesh had built the Christian Memorial Hospital at Malumghat. The employees, such as the nurses and maintenance crew had to be Christian or convert to Christian, or they were sacked. It has been reported that Christian doctors would intentionally prescribe and administer the wrong medicine to illiterate patients. While doing this, the doctor(s) would tell the patient to seek Muhammed (if the patient was Muslim) or Ramakrishna (if the patient was Hindu) for blessings for a recovery. When the patient did not make a recovery, the doctor(s) would then administer the correct medication and then ask them to seek Christ for blessings for a recovery. Once the patient had recovered, they were then told a series of points in order to try and get them to convert. These points were: * \\"Jesus was able to cure you; therefore, he can also give you paradise. So, believe in him.\\" * \\"Jesus will give you a prosperous life if you become Christian, and Christians don't face any financial difficulties. Whereas, followers of Muhammed are poor, and the descendants of Muhammed are thieves.\\" * \\"The Quaran is inferior to the Bible.\\" * \\"Converts were also promised money, free medicine, and also jobs.\\" Persecution Given the country's Islamic culture, Christians in Bangladesh often face the pressure from radical Islamic groups or threats (such as persecution and harassment) from the wider community. In 2019, several churches, such as Mohandi Assemblies of God church, were either burnt down or destroyed. To combat this, Christians would gather in secret or in small houses to practice their religion. Additionally, in 2020, it's alleged that several Christians have been detained by police for \\"unlawful conversion\\". Conditions have improved in recent years as Bangladesh moved from place 35 on the World Watch List of Christian persecution in 2015 to place 48 in 2019. However, a sharp rise of violence against Christians in 2019 sent the country back to number 38 on the list.https://www.opendoorsusa.org/download/wwl-2020-bangladesh- countrycard-01/?wpdmdl=55344  Other attacks on Christians  On June 3, 2001, there was a bomb attack during mass in a Catholic church located in Baniarchor; the attack had killed nine people. An Italian aid worker, Cesare Tavella was shot and killed in 2015. Parolari Piero, an Italian Catholic priest and doctor was shot several times in 2015. In 2016, A Christian businessman named Sunil Gomes was hacked to death. On July 1, 2016, 20 hostages were massacred by a group of Islamic militants. A pastor of Faith Bible Church was attacked in October 2016. Dioceses There are two Catholic archdioceses and six Catholic dioceses in Bangladesh with some 400,000 Catholics. Each diocese is led by its own local bishop. Cardinal Patrick D'Rozario is the highest Catholic official. The archdiocese of Dhaka comprises of: * The diocese of Dinajpur * The diocese of Mymesnisingh * The diocese of Rajshahi * The diocese of Sylhet The archdiocese of Chittagong comprises of: * The diocese of Barisal * The diocese of Khulna The diocese of Dhaka was created in 1952 and Reverend James D. Blair was assigned as the first Bishop (Markham, Hawkins IV, Terry & Steffensen, 2013). Following Blair, the first indigenous Bishop of the Diocese of Dhaka was assigned to Reverend B. D. Mondal. By the late 1980s, it was decided that a second diocese was needed, and this was established in Kusthia (Markham et al, 2013).

They work with scientists as well as students to further the commitment of non-animal based research. The HRT began life in 1961, after two years of discussions between the National Anti-Vivisection Society (NAVS), the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Vivisection (SSPV), and the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection (BUAV), as \\"The Lawson Tait Memorial Trust\\". These discussions were chaired by Wilfred Risdon, Secretary of the NAVS, who also became Secretary of the new Trust, set up to honour the memory of the Scottish surgeon and anti- vivisectionist, Robert Lawson Tait (1845-1899).

It is effectively a military administrative corps, and can comprise multiple component regiments. This nomenclature stems from its heritage as an offshoot of the British Army's Royal Artillery. In its current form it was founded in 1947 with the amalgamation of the regular and volunteer corps of artillery in New Zealand. In 1958 in recognition of services rendered it was given the title the Royal Regiment of New Zealand Artillery. History=Predecessors and formation The Royal Regiment of New Zealand Artillery's predecessor units in the Volunteer Force date from February 1866, when the first field artillery battery and naval artillery corps were formed. From 1878 the various field batteries were administrative grouped together as the New Zealand Regiment of Artillery Volunteers, and were designated alphabetically. The naval artillery batteries were grouped as the New Zealand Garrison Artillery Volunteers in 1902. Meanwhile, the establishment of coast defences from the mid-1880s had necessitated the creation of a small permanent artillery force within the Permanent Military, which was designated the Royal New Zealand Artillery (RNZA) on 15 October 1902. Following the formation of the Territorial Force in 1911 the Regiment of New Zealand Field Artillery and the New Zealand Garrison Artillery Volunteers became part of the New Zealand Artillery. During this time the permanent RNZA maintained an instructional and cadre role. Between 2‚Äì5 August 1914 pre-war plans to establish harbour examination batteries and mobilise the then Royal New Zealand Artillery (active force) and New Zealand Garrison Artillery (territorials) were carried out. The examination batteries' task was to interrogate unidentified vessels entering port. The examination batteries at Fort Takapuna, Point Gordon in Wellington, Fort Jervois and Howlett Point at the entrance to Port Chalmers were manned around the clock until 15 March 1915. After that date guns and equipment were maintained at a high state of readiness, with battery personnel available at a few hours' notice.' During initial mobilisation for the First World War, it was intended that one six-gun 18-pounder battery would form part of the initial contingent of the New Zealand Expeditionary Force. Following large numbers volunteering for artillery, it was decided to raise the a brigade of three batteries, totalling twelve 18-pounders. The initial brigade departed with the rest of the Main Body on 16 October 1914. Eventually two New Zealand field artillery brigades (regiment-sized units) served with the New Zealand and Australian Division. Following the end of the war the New Zealand Artillery was renamed the Regiment of New Zealand Artillery. During the Second World War, 4, 5 and 6 Field Regiments sailed with the 2nd New Zealand Expeditionary Force; initially also despatched was 7 Anti-Tank Regiment and 14 Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment. A number of artillery regiments and batteries served with the 2nd New Zealand Expeditionary Force in the Pacific (2 NZEF IP), and 3rd Division. After the war ended, the Territorial Force was reconstituted in the late 1940s, and a number of field, mortar (5th Light Regiment RNZA), and coastal units were created. In January 1947 the Regiment of New Zealand Artillery was amalgamated with the RNZA. New Zealand gunners in action in Korea, April 1952 Korean War When the Korean War broke out in June 1950, a Regular Force regiment, 16th Field Regiment RNZA, was established as the core of New Zealand's deployed contingent, known as Kayforce, in January 1951. The battery was attached to the 27th British Brigade of the 1st Commonwealth Division. The 16th Field Regiment first saw action a month later and remained on active service for the next two and a half years. The 16th Field Regiment subsequently provided close support to the British Commonwealth infantry and was later awarded the South Korean Presidential Unit Citation for its actions during the Battle of Kapyong in April 1951. Between 1951 and 1953 the regiment fire more than 750,000 shells, operating 25-pounders. After the Armistice was signed in 1954, Kayforce‚Äôs numbers were gradually reduced. The 16th Field Regiment and other Corps elements were withdrawn in 1955. The last elements of Kayforce returned to New Zealand in 1957.http://army.mil.nz/about- us/what-we-do/deployments/previous-deployments/korea/default.htm 1950s In 1955, the regiment consisted of the following units:Royal New Zealand Artillery Association, Artillery units 1955‚Äì64, accessed August 2012 *District Troops **Northern Military District ***9th Coast Regiment RNZA (Auckland) ***13th Composite Anti-aircraft Regiment RNZA **Central Military District ***10th Coast Regiment RNZA (Wellington) ***14th Composite Anti-aircraft Regiment RNZA **Southern Military District ***11th Coast Regiment RNZA (Lyttleton Respectively) ***151st Composite Anti-aircraft Battery RNZA (15th Composite AA Regiment disbanded Sept 1954) *Divisional Troops **Headquarters Royal Artillery ***Command ***Royal Artillery Staff Troop ***Divisional Counter Bombardment Staff Troop **1st Field Regiment RNZA (Auckland) **2nd Field Regiment RNZA (Palmerston North **3rd Field Regiment RNZA (Dunedin) **4th Medium Regiment RNZA (Hamilton) **5th Light Regiment RNZA (Wellington) **6th Light Anti-aircraft Regiment RNZA (Auckland) **12th Heavy Anti-aircraft Regiment RNZA (HQ Auckland) **1st Locating Battery RNZA The 1957 National Government defence review directed the discontinuation of coastal defence training, and the approximately 1000 personnel of the 9th, 10th, and 11th Coastal Regiments had their Compulsory Military Training obligation removed. A small cadre of regulars remained, but as Henderson, Green, and Cook say, 'the coastal artillery had quietly died.' All the fixed guns were dismantled and sold for scrap by the early 1960s. The three regiments survived on paper until 1967, 'each in its final years at an actual strength of a single warrant officer, the District Gunner, whose duties mainly involved taking care of the mobile 3.7-inch guns allocated for emergency harbour defences.' In 1958 the regiment was redesignated the Royal Regiment of New Zealand Artillery. The 16th Field Regiment RNZA was reformed at this time as part of the Regular Force Brigade Group. In 1961 the last two anti-aircraft regiments were disbanded. Meanwhile, from 1963 Italian designed 105-mm L5 Pack Howitzers began replacing the 25-pounders. 5th Light Regiment RNZA was disbanded in 1964.

NZ gunners who served in 161 Bty, while under the 173rd (1965‚Äì1966) were permitted to wear the patch on their left sleeve. A rotational RNZA battery was deployed to South Vietnam during the Vietnam War. In 1965 the United States government committed its 173rd Airborne Brigade to South Vietnam in a combat role. Being part of the ANZUS pact Australia and New Zealand were asked to contribute military forces too. Up until this time the Australians had committed an Army training team and New Zealand had committed some non-combatant engineers. In response to the United States' request, the Australian government committed an infantry battalion and New Zealand committed an artillery battery. 161 Field Battery, RNZA arrived in South Vietnam on 16 July 1965. The Australian infantry regiment and the New Zealand artillery battery served under operational control of the 173rd Airborne in Bi√™n H√≤a Province.Film: 'New Zealanders in South East Asia'(1965) URL: https://www.facebook.com/battleoflongtan/videos/10153928021528375/ (New Zealand National Film Unit) 161 Bty was attached as the third battery of the US 3rd Battalion, 319th Field Artillery Regiment. The battery began its first major operation on 14 September 1965. Sergeant Alastair John Sherwood Don and Bombardier Robert White of 161 Bty were the first New Zealand casualties of the Vietnam War when the front of their vehicle was blown up by a Vietcong command detonated mine during the initial road convoy on Operation Ben Cat. In their first year, under U.S command the battery took part in: * Battle of Gang Toi during Operation Hump, * Operation New Life (15 November ‚Äì 16 December 1965) * Operation Marauder (1 - 8 January 1966) * Operation Crimp (8 - 16 January 1966) * Operation Entr√©e in general support of 1/503 US Infantry's operations, * Battle of Suoi Bong Trang during Operation Rolling Stone in support of 1RAR, * Operation Abilene in support of 1st US Infantry Division, * Operation Denver as part of \\"Force Essex\\", and * Operation Enoggera in support of newly arrived 6RAR. In May 1966 it was decided to create an Australian task force with its own Tactical area of responsibility (TAOR.) Ph∆∞·ªõc Tuy Province was to be designated the TAOR for the new task force.Vietnam 1965-1966 URL: https://www.1rar.org.au/vietnam-1965-66/ (1RAR The First Battalion Association) The 1st Australian Task Force (1ATF) was formed in June 1966, with a base built at Nui Dat. The New Zealand government was given the choice of allowing the artillery battery to remain at Bien Hoa under U.S command with the 173rd Airborne or integrate the battery with the new task force. The decision was made to integrate the battery into 1ATF under 105 Battery, Royal Australian Artillery which had arrived at the end of September 1965. As part of 1ATF, the New Zealand battery is remembered well for its role in the Battle of Long Tan on 18 August 1966, during which it played a key role in supporting the outnumbered Australian infantry from D Company, 6 RAR hold off a regimental-sized Viet Cong force. Three New Zealand artillery Forward Observers attached to D Company controlled the guns of their own battery, the two Australian batteries, and two American batteries - a total of 24 guns, in support of themselves and the rest of D Company for more than 3.5 hours firing 6-8 rounds per minute almost non stop.https://battleoflongtan.com/161-bty- royal-new-zealand-artillery-vietnam-1965/ In 1967 the battery's L5 howitzers were replaced by heavier and more robust American M2A2 Howitzers. Also in 1967, the first company of New Zealand infantry arrived, followed by a second company in December 1967. The two infantry companies eventually amalgamated with one of the three 1ATF battalions in March 1968 to form the \\"ANZAC Battalion.\\" This practice continued with each New Zealand infantry company rotating with or within 6 months of a new rotation of Australian infantry, designated \\"ANZAC Battalion\\" each time. When the New Zealand battery was called upon to support 1ATF infantry operations, Forward Observers from the battery would accompany the Australian, New Zealand, or U.S infantry units on operations to direct fire when needed. The battery would continue to support allied forces throughout its entire time in Vietnam including participation in Operation Bribie in 1967, and Operation Coburg, the Tet Offensive, and the Battle of Coral‚ÄìBalmoral in 1968. As Australian and New Zealand combat units began to be withdrawn in keeping with US troop reductions, the battery was withdrawn in May 1971. The battery was involved in 17 major operations during their time in Vietnam. Approximately 750 members of the 161st Battery served in Vietnam with a loss of 5 killed and 22 wounded.https://vietnamwar.govt.nz/sites/default/files/documents/nz-honour- roll-vietnam.pdf 1980s‚Äì1990s A range of new capabilities were introduced during this period. In 1986 the British designed, Australian produced 105-mm L119 Hamel Light Gun was introduced, while computerized artillery systems were introduced in 1989, and global positioning systems in 1997, which resulted in a significant increase in capability. In 1997 the French Mistral short range air defence missile was acquired, providing an anti-aircraft capability for the first time since 1961. The headquarters of 3rd Field Regiment RNZA was disbanded in 1990, with its two subordinate TF batteries remaining. Twenty- first century Gunners fire a L119 Light Gun in 2010 A member of 16 Field Regiment preparing to launch a Kahu UAV in 2008 Today, the RNZA consists of a single regiment: *16 Field Regiment, Royal New Zealand Artillery **Regimental Headquarters **HQ Battery ***JOST Troop **161 Battery (Close Support) ‚Äì L119 Light Gun, Mortar- 81mm, L16A2 ***Headquarters Troop ***Able Troop ***Baker Troop ***Command Post Troop **163 Battery (Close Support) ‚Äì L119 Light Gun, Mortar- 81mm, L16A2 ***Headquarters Troop ***Easy Troop ***Fox Troop ***Command Post Troop Members of the 16th Field Regiment formed part of the New Zealand Battalion deployed on peacekeeping operations in East Timor. The School of Artillery is also active. Territorial units In addition, there are a number of Territorial Force artillery units; these were formerly units of the RNZA, but were moved into the structure of the TF battalion groups on the restructuring of the army in the late 1990s: *11(A) Battery (Auckland) (Close Support), 3rd Auckland (Countess of Ranfurly's Own) and Northland Battalion Group (Amalgamated 1990s) *22(D) Battery (Wellington) (Air Defence), 7th Wellington (City of Wellington's Own) and Hawke's Bay Battalion Group (Disbanded 1990's) *31(B) Battery (Dunedin) 4th Otago and Southland Battalion Group (Disbanded 1990s) *32(E) Battery (Christchurch) (Observation Post), 2nd Canterbury, and Nelson-Marlborough and West Coast Battalion Group (Disbanded 1990s *4 (G) Medium Battery (Hamilton) (Amalgamated 1990s) RNZA Territorial- Reserve Battery's/Troops as of 2020: *11/4 Battery RNZA (Comes under 16 Field Regiment RNZA) *22 Troop RNZA (Linton) (Comes under 16 Field Regiment RNZA) The Battle Honours of the above three Territorial Force artillery units are for South Africa, World War I and World War II. Distinctions A composite unit of the RNZA became the first specific New Zealand unit to mount the Queen's Guard at Buckingham Palace in 1964 (previously, the contingents sent to the Coronation had mounted the guard). The South Vietnam Presidential Unit Citation 1st Class was presented to 161 Bty in 1977 for its service in the Vietnam War as part of the 1st Battalion Group, Royal Australian Regiment (see Non-U.S. recipients of U.S. gallantry awards). In 1995 the unit received the Meritorious Unit Commendation (MUC) in recognition of its service with the United States 173rd Airborne Brigade during the Vietnam War. In 2011 the Governor General of New Zealand, on behalf of HM Queen Elizabeth II, gave permission for 16 Field Regt RNZA to wear the South Korean Presidential Unit Citation, by all Officers and NCO's attached to the Regiment, however after their appoints finish with the Regiment the Citation is handed back to the Regiment. In 2019 the Australian government awarded veterans of 161 Battery who had fought at the Battles of Coral and Balmoral the Australian Unit Citation for Gallantry for \\"extraordinary gallantry\\". Uniform The RNZA were distinguished by a blue and red puggaree around the traditional \\"Lemon Squeezer\\" hat of the New Zealand Army, until this headdress fell into abeyance in the late 1950s. It has subsequently been reintroduced for ceremonial use but the RNZA now wear the same red puggaree as most other corps and regiments. Artillery officers wore a dark blue jacket and trousers with red lapels and trouser stripes for mess dress but this has now been phased out in favour of a universal scarlet mess jacket worn by all branches of the Army.

University of Florida, Rare Books Collection, viewed on July 8, 2013 Dun Emer published two editions of the book in 1903. The more expensive collection was published on Dutch and Irish paper and is bound with a vellum cover with Irish linen ties (see image). This is the first book of Yeats's \\"middle period,\\" in which he eschewed his previous Romantic ideals and preference for pre-Raphaelite imagery, in favor of a more spare style and an anti-romantic poetic stance similar to that of Walter Savage Landor. The poem \\"Adam's Curse\\", however, continues to reflect the old ideals. This is also the most popular and frequently anthologized of the poems from this volume. The volume includes the play \\"On Baile's Strand: A Play\\".  \\"In The Seven Woods\\"  This is the opening poem of the book: :I have heard the pigeons of the Seven Woods :Make their faint thunder, and the garden bees :Hum in the lime-tree flowers; and put away :The unavailing outcries and the old bitterness :That empty the heart. I have forgot awhile :Tara uprooted, and new commonness :Upon the throne and crying about the streets :And hanging its paper flowers from post to post, :Because it is alone of all things happy. :I am contented, for I know that Quiet :Wanders laughing and eating her wild heart :Among pigeons and bees, while that Great Archer, :Who but awaits His hour to shoot, still hangs :A cloudy quiver over Pairc-na-lee. :August, 1902.In The Seven Woods, viewed on July 8, 2013 Index :Title Page :\\"In the Seven Woods\\" :\\"The Old Age of Queen Maeve\\" :\\"Baile and Ailinn\\" :\\"The Arrow\\" :\\"The Folly of Being Comforted\\" :\\"The Withering of the Boughs\\" :\\"Adam's Curse\\" :\\"The Song of Red Hanrahan\\" :\\"The Old Men Admiring Themselves in the Water\\" :\\"Under the Moon\\" :\\"The Players Ask for a Blessing in the Psalteries and Themselves\\" :\\"The Rider From the North\\" :Comment by Yeats :\\"On Baile's Strand: A Play\\" :Advertisements (in the cheaper version) The collection was reprinted in 1906 in \\"Poems, 1899-1905\\" with two additions. \\"Old Memory\\" and \\"Never Give all the Heart\\" appear directly after \\"The Folly of being Comforted\\".

The river rises near Cranborne Chase, an area of chalk downland, and flows broadly from north to south before joining the river Stour. The eight Tarrant Valley villages/hamlets all bear the name of the river. Listed in order from the river's source they are: * Tarrant Gunville: the source of the river is in the grounds of Gunville House, now demolished. The parish church is dedicated to St Mary. * Tarrant Hinton: a village at a crossroads. The parish church is dedicated to St Mary. * Tarrant Launceston: a hamlet with a 17th-century three-arched bridge. The church, dedicated to St Mary, was demolished in the 1700s (the site is on Higher Dairy Farm). Now part of the parish of Tarrant Monkton. * Tarrant Monkton: a village with a parish church dedicated to All Saints. * Tarrant Rawston: a very small settlement. This once had a parish church dedicated to St Mary, which still exists and is in private ownership but remains as a church. * Tarrant Rushton: a village with a parish church dedicated to St Mary. Near here was a World War II RAF airfield. * Tarrant Keyneston: this is the largest village of the eight; it has a parish church dedicated to All Saints. * Tarrant Crawford, the final settlement, lies at the confluence of the rivers Tarrant and Stour. Here there is the church of St Mary the Virgin held by the Churches Conservation Trust and Tarrant Abbey farm, where once stood a nunnery. Tarrant Crawford became part of the parish of Tarrant Keyneston. There were possibly one or two other Tarrant communities: * Tarrant Stubhampton, north of Tarrant Gunville and part of that parish: This is now known as Stubhampton. In the Middle Ages, a church existed in that village. This is the source of the Tarrant. * Tarrant Antioch which may have been an earlier name for Tarrant Rawston, or may have been a distinct community just north of Tarrant Rawston. Tarrant Antioch was served by St Mary Tarrant Crawford, where there was a devotion to St Margaret of Antioch. * Tarrant Preston, now Preston Farm University of Nottingham Survey of English Place-Names A Roman road followed the valley and there are many tumuli on the hills on both sides of the river, evidence of long occupation.

Originally intended as a high-speed replacement for the Il-4, it was recast as a very long-range bomber with fuel-conserving diesel engines before production of the single prototype began in December 1942. Flight testing showed controllability issues when landing at high weights and the engines proved to be hard to start at low temperatures and were slow to respond to throttle movements. Further development was canceled in 1944. Development Outwardly similar to the Il-4, the Il-6 was faster and had a longer and slimmer fuselage fitted with a completely new, highly tapered wing with an aspect ratio of 8. The engine nacelles were streamlined to reduce drag and increase speed as the engine radiators were mounted in the wing center section, fed by slits in the leading edge of the wing. Defensive armament was greatly improved with five cannon fitted on flexible mountings in the nose, dorsal turret, two waist positions and a ventral blister forward of the tailplane.Gordon, p. 103 The Il-6 was originally intended as a high-speed replacement for the Il-4. But after the initial design was completed in August 1942, the VVS requested that the bomber have extended range instead of high speed. The original M-71 radial engines were therefore replaced by Charomskiy ACh-30 diesel engines with low fuel consumption which promised to give the Il-6 the required range, especially when operated at moderate weights. The revised design was completed in December 1942 and production of the prototype was initiated. The first flight of the Il-6 was made in Irkutsk on 7 August 1943 with lower-powered ACh-30B engines substituted for the unavailable ACh-30BF engines.Gordon, pp. 103‚Äì04 Flight tests revealed difficult handling, and a lack of power due to the non-availability of the intended ACh-30BF engines. Flight tests continued without the waist guns and their gunner until the ACh-30BF's were fitted between May and July 1944. Despite modifications, the aircraft still suffered from poor controllability at low speeds and high weights as well as very poor gliding performance. Throughout the flight tests the engines performed satisfactorily in the air, but were found to be very difficult to start in low ambient temperatures and had slow response to throttle movements.

The series premiered in the United Kingdom on BBC Radio 4. Set in the year 2099 AD, the show focuses on the adventures of the eponymous Professor Nebulous, director of operations for the eco-troubleshooting team KENT (the Key Environmental Non-Judgmental Taskforce) as they combat various catastrophes and try to set the world back on the right path following a worldwide environmental disaster known as \\"The Withering\\". As well as being a parody of a number of famous science fiction programmes, including Doctor Who, Quatermass and Doomwatch, Nebulous is considered a cult radio programme, attracting a number of guest appearances from famous actors. There have been three series of Nebulous; the first was broadcast between 6 January and 10 February 2005. The series was well received by critics, and a second series was broadcast between 5 April and 10 May 2006, with a third series commissioned by the BBC which began broadcasting on Thursday, 15 May 2008 at 23:00 BST. The first series was released on compact disc on 5 February 2007 by BBC Audio. Since 2009 all three series have been broadcast on BBC Radio 7. Duff has also announced that he is planning to make an animated series of Nebulous. Production=Development The development of the series began with the production pilot episode, written by Graham Duff and produced by Baby Cow Productions in March 2003. The episode, which eventually became \\"Night of the Vegetarians\\", featured much of the final cast, but with a number of differences: a different actor played Rory, and Sir Ronald Rowlands was voiced by Duff, while Gemini originally had two voices: a female voice played by Julia Dalkin, and a male voice by Nicholas Briggs. Malcolm Boyle - who wrote the Nebulous theme and edited the pilot - had written an entire original score for the show. However, due to BBC radio budget limitations, this was not used in the completed series. Nicholas Briggs had also originally created a very deep, realistic soundscape, similar to those he had created for the Big Finish Productions Doctor Who audioplays, but was advised that \\"it's likely the listener will have distractions and will not listen to it more than once; therefore, the soundscape must be totally accessible from any point in the episode\\", toning down the sound effects to match the series' comic nature. Recording The Moat Studios in London recorded Nebulous in stereo, with each half-hour episode typically taking one day to record, including read- through and rehearsal. Nicholas Briggs produced the sound, using a combination of synthesised effects from a Roland SH-101 and foley sound effects. Briggs also carried out the studio editing in order to bring the 30-minute episodes down to the 28 minutes mandated by the BBC to allow time for radio trailers between programmes. Plot=Setting Set in the year 2099, the series depicts the Earth as very different from today. Following a number of environmental disasters, such as \\"the Withering\\" - which resulted in the loss of a great deal of human knowledge including the vacuum cleaner and fire (although the latter came back fairly quickly) - and a \\"Cattle-clasm\\" that killed off most of the livestock, the Earth has been reduced to a wasteland separated between \\"Withered Zones\\" and the remaining inhabitable areas. The Withering shifted the Earth into a new orbit, resulting in disruption to the seasons and a reformed calendar. Every day of the week is now 25-hours long except for Thursday (which, due to time anomalies, has not occurred in over a decade), while the change in the length of the year led to the creation of new months such as Janril, Febtober, and Marchuary. In addition, the dreary season of Hamble was created, which is permanently dark, cold and drizzly. The Withering resulted in vegetarians, pigeons and gays becoming endangered species, and completely wiped out tarts. The Earth's geography is also radically altered. A new mountain range was formed in Britain by a day-long ice age, and the Earth now has twelve and a half continents. Many locations have been displaced and reduced to islands, including Oxford University and the London borough of Deptford, which is now in the Indonesian Ocean as a part of the Cockney Islands. The solar system is equally altered: Jupiter has been deep fried by Harry Ramsden's, Mercury and Neptune have been knocked together, and there was an initiative to destroy the Moon, which according to the show was deleterious to the nightlight industry. Religion also exists in the Nebulous universe. Pieced together following the Withering, theologians conclude that there were four true deities: the evil twins Yin and Yang, Feng Shui the destroyer, and merciful Bod, based on the children's television programme Bod, the theme tune of which has become a hymn, sung in Gregorian chant. Bod is analogous to God, hence the commonly used phrase \\"Oh my Bod!\\" Storyline Nebulous follows the adventures of the eco-troubleshooting team \\"KENT\\" (the Key Environmental Non-Judgmental Taskforce, named after the English county of Kent). The group is directed by Professor Nebulous toward the goal of restoring a natural balance to Earth. However, they are woefully under-funded; KENT was forced to open a laundry to supplement funds. There is at least one other eco-troubleshooting team based in England, but despite their common goals they have a less-than-hospitable view of each other. LOUGHBOROUGH (the Legitimate Organisation Undertaking General Humanitarian Business Operations Requiring Optimum Unconditional Global Harmony, named after the Leicestershire town Loughborough) is run by Professor Nebulous‚Äô ex- love interest, Doctor Erica Flazenby. By comparison to KENT it is over-funded and well-equipped, with bazers, black helicopters and info pills, which provide the user with information by ingestion. Nebulous both parodies and pays homage to several well known science fiction programmes and films in both its setting and plotlines, often incorporating several different elements within a single story: Professor Nebulous himself is similar to Bernard Quatermass, a British scientist who led a research group and fought aliens in the classic science fiction serial The Quatermass Experiment and its sequels. KENT itself is based partly on the Department of Measurement of Scientific Work, nicknamed \\"Doomwatch\\", the eponymous organisation from the BBC science fiction television programme Doomwatch, and partly on the Doctor Who Organization \\"U.N.I.T\\", otherwise known as the \\"United Nations Intelligence Taskforce\\". The second episode of series one, \\"The Loverly Invasion\\", is a direct spoof of the Doctor Who episode \\"The Claws of Axos\\", while \\"The Deptford Wives\\" takes both its name and premise from The Stepford Wives (and also borrows from Jurassic Park). From the first episode of series 3 onwards, this also began to include the recent Doctor Who spin-off Torchwood and the ITV series Primeval, with references to \\"baby dinosaurs falling through a hole in time\\" and \\"the sheer amount of paranormal activity in the Cardiff area alone ... starting to threaten the Earth's plausibility shield\\". Episode 6 of that series also parodied the tendency in British sci-fi for attempts to take over the world to start in Britain, with the chief villain (played by Tenth Doctor actor David Tennant) stating \\"Funnily enough, that's a tax thing,\\" as well as one of the Ninth Doctor's nicknames, \\"the oncoming storm\\" (with Nebulous known as \\"the oncoming drizzle\\").

The third series featured appearances from Julia Davis and David Tennant. Reviews Reception to Nebulous was generally positive: a reviewer from The Times described the first series as \\"a winning blend of Doomwatch, Quatermass and British silliness that has cult written all over it\\", while the second series was described as \\"cool and cultish\\". However, The Daily Telegraph was more guarded, comparing the show to \\"Hitchhiker's without the philosophy or Red Dwarf without the energy\\", going on to say that show is \\"funny, but not seriously so\\". A reviewer for Doctor Who website UnitNews also initially expressed concerns about the level of jokes in the show, but later claimed \\"I should have been more patient because when they did arrive, coinciding with the introduction of the character Harry, they were relentlessly funny\\".

It is held approximately a hundred days before the matura, or leaving exam; hence its name, which is a Polish noun formed from the adjective studniowy, meaning \\"hundred-day\\" (compare sto dni, \\"a hundred days\\"). The ball is usually organized by parents who also pay most of the costs. The choice of venue depends mostly on the funds - it may be the school gym, but also an expensive hotel, or even a palace or castle. The ball is attended by students and their dates, teachers, and occasionally parents. The attire is formal; this means suits with neckties (not tuxedos) for boys, and evening gowns for girls. Additionally, girls may don red lingerie underneath, which is believed to bring good luck at the exams; boys may also wear red underpants, but this is less common. Studni√≥wka customarily starts with a dinner, usually followed by a toast with champagne. This is normally the first occasion when students and their teachers officially drink alcohol together. The first dance is almost invariably a polonaise, which students usually have to practice before the ball, followed by more modern dances. A popular competition during the party is a contest for the one who can dance longest holding his partner in the arms. During this contest, the tiniest girls around are particularly popular with boys. Apart from the red underwear, the ball may be associated with many other superstitious practices, such as jumping on one leg around a monument - all of which are supposed to help students pass their matura.

After teaching at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm and while working as state geodesist at the Geographical Survey Office of Sweden (Rikets allm√§nna kartverk; RAK) 1949-1954, he completed his Licentiate in 1952 and his Ph.D. in geodesy at Uppsala University in 1954 with the dissertation Outlines of a method for determining the geoid in Sweden by free-air anomalies (published in Stockholm, also as Rikets allm√§nna kartverk. Meddelande. 22). He produced about 60 scientific reports and articles. He taught in Uppsala from 1954, was a researcher with the Swedish Natural Science Research Council from 1962, established the Uppsala Department of Geodesy the same year, and was given a research professorship in 1968. For his 70th birthday he was given the festschrift Commemorative volume on the occasion of Erik Tengstr√∂m's 70th birthday (Report / Department of Geodesy, University of Uppsala, Institute of Geophysics, ISSN 0281-4463 ; 19). The Florian asteroid 2195 Tengstr√∂m, discovered by Liisi Oterma at Turku Observatory in Finland, was named in his honour.  References  *Lars E.

He was a two-way player who played at center on offense and at linebacker on defense. He has been inducted into both the College and Pro Football Halls of Fame, was a founder and the first president of the NFL Alumni Association, and was the third player to receive the Order of the Leather Helmet. Wojciechowicz played college football for the Fordham Rams from 1935 to 1937 and was a member of the line that became known as the Seven Blocks of Granite. He was selected as the consensus first-team All-American center in both 1936 and 1937. Wojciechowicz was selected by the Detroit Lions in the first round of the 1938 NFL Draft and played for the Lions from 1938 to 1946. He was selected as a first-team All- NFL player in 1939 and 1944. In 1946, he was released by the Lions and then sold to the Philadelphia Eagles, for whom he played from 1946 to 1950. He won two NFL championships with the Eagles, in 1948 and 1949. Early years Wojciechowicz was born in 1915 in South River, New Jersey, and attended South River High School. His father, Andrew Wojciechowicz (1890‚Äì1974), was a Polish immigrant and tailor. College football Wojciechowicz enrolled at Fordham University in 1935 and played college football as the center for the Fordham Rams football team from 1935 to 1937. He was a member of the Fordham line, alongside Vince Lombardi, that became known as the Seven Blocks of Granite. The undefeated 1937 Fordham team, with Wojciechowicz at center, compiled a 7‚Äì0‚Äì1 record, was ranked #3 in the final AP Poll, and gave up only 16 points all season. He was selected as the consensus first-team All-American center in both 1936 and 1937. Fordham coach Jim Crowley called Wojciechowicz \\"one of the great defensive centers\\" and noted that he \\"seldom made a bad pass from center.\\" He made a name for himself in the annual rivalry games with Pittsburgh, resulting in three consecutive scoreless ties. The final tie was the only blemish on the record of the 1937 Pitt team that won the national championship in the AP Poll. Wojciechowicz later cited the Pitt games as his three biggest thrills in football, saying, \\"Pitt had the dream backfield, with all-America Marshall Goldberg, and we had the dream line. It was a stalemate for three years. Those three games proved what football is all about.\\" Professional football=Detroit Lions Wojciechowicz was selected by the Detroit Lions in the first round, sixth overall pick, of the 1938 NFL Draft. He signed with the Lions in July 1938. For nine years, Wojciechowicz was a fixture in the Lions' lineup, a 60-minute player who played at center on offense and linebacker on defense. He was selected as a first-team All-NFL player in 1939 and 1944 and had seven interceptions in 1944, a Lions single- season record at the time. Between 1938 and 1946, he appeared in 86 games for the Lions, 61 of them as a starter. The Pro Football Hall of Fame, in its biography of Wojciechowicz, states: \\"On the field, . . . he was all business, one of the last of the 'iron men' of football, a center on offense and a sure- tackling linebacker with unusually good range, on defense.\\" In October 1946, after the Lions lost their season opener, Detroit coach Gus Dorais released four linemen, including Wojciechowicz. Wojciechowicz announced at the time that he would return to his business in New Jersey and added, \\"This day had to come, and I can't say I'm disappointed that it happened now.\\" Philadelphia Eagles Two days after the Lions announced his release, the Eagles purchased the Lions' rights to Wojciechowicz for an undisclosed sum. He appeared in seven games for the Eagles, only one as a starter, during the 1946 season. In 1947, he became the Eagles' starting center, appearing in all 12 games for the club, 11 as a starter. The 1947 Eagles compiled an 8‚Äì4 record, finished in first place in the NFL East, but lost to the Cardinals in the 1947 NFL Championship Game. In 1948, Wojciechowicz lost the starting center job to Vic Lindskog, but appeared in 10 games, mostly on defense, for the 1948 Eagles team that shut out the Cardinals in the 1948 NFL Championship Game. In 1949, he appeared in all 12 games, but only one as a starter, as Chuck Bednarik was the starting center for the Eagles team. That year, the Eagles won their second consecutive NFL championship, shutting out the Rams in the 1949 NFL Championship Game. He was considered past his prime when he joined the Eagles, but head coach Greasy Neale used him principally as a linebacker, and he responded with quality defensive play.Didinger, Ray. \\"Eagles' Wojciechowicz was club's 'toughest guy'\\", Asbury Park Press, July 15, 1992. Accessed May 10, 2017. \\"Alex Wojciechowicz , one of 12 Philadelphia Eagles in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, died Monday at his home in Forked River, N.J.\\" Teammate Jack Hinkle called Wojciechowicz the \\"toughest guy\\" on the Eagles' championship teams and added, \\"He looked like a big, shaggy dog. A sad-eyed St. Bernard. But he'd rip your head off.\\" In his final NFL season, Wojciechowicz appeared in nine games, none as a starter, and saw only limited action. In December 1950, he announced that he was retiring as a player. Family, honors and later years Wojciechowicz was married to Katherine Mallen, and they had three sons and a daughter. For many years after retiring from the NFL, he lived in Wanamassa, New Jersey, and worked as a real estate appraiser and broker. Wojciechowicz was also one of the founders of the NFL Alumni Association, established to negotiate with the owners for the creation of a pension plan to benefit the game's early players, and was elected as its president in 1968. His son recalled: \\"He worked hard to establish the indigent players' fund and establish pensions.\\" After retiring from football, Wojciechowicz received numerous honors including the following: * In 1955, he was inducted to the College Football Hall of Fame. * In 1968, he was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. At the time, Bill Daley wrote in The New York Times: \\"Fewer than a dozen men had the durability and continuing excellence to survive the rigors of smashing play for a longer period of time.\\" * In 1969, he was selected to the National Football League 1940s All- Decade Team. * In 1970, he was one of the five inaugural inductees into the Fordham University Athletic Hall of Fame. * In 1971, he was inducted into the New Jersey All Sports Hall of Fame. * In 1975, Wojciechowicz was inducted into the National Polish American Sports Hall of Fame. * In 1982, he became the third player, after Bronko Nagurski and Red Grange, to receive the prestigious NFL Alumni Order of the Leather Helmet. * In 1987, he was inducted into the Eagles Hall of Fame. Wojciechowicz died in 1992 at his home in the Forked River section of Lacey Township, New Jersey, at age 76.

It belongs to a group of nematodes called roundworms. This intestinal worm can cause a number of symptoms in people, principally skin symptoms, abdominal pain, diarrhea and weight loss, among many other specific and vague symptoms in disseminated disease, and severe life-threatening conditions through hyperinfection. In some people, particularly those who require corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive medication, Strongyloides can cause a hyperinfection syndrome that can lead to death if untreated. The diagnosis is made by blood and stool tests. The medication ivermectin is widely used to treat strongyloidiasis. Strongyloidiasis is a type of soil- transmitted helminthiasis. Low estimates postulate it to affect 30‚Äì100 million people worldwide, mainly in tropical and subtropical countries, while higher estimates conservatively extrapolate that infection is upwards to or above 370 million people. It belongs to the group of neglected tropical diseases, and worldwide efforts are aimed at eradicating the infection. Signs and symptoms right Strongyloides infection occurs in five forms. As the infection continues and the larvae matures, there may be respiratory symptoms (L√∂ffler's syndrome). The infection may then become chronic with mainly digestive symptoms. On reinfection (when larvae migrate through the body) from the skin to the lungs and finally to the small intestine, there may be respiratory, skin and digestive symptoms. Finally, the hyperinfection syndrome causes symptoms in many organ systems, including the central nervous system. Uncomplicated disease Frequently asymptomatic. Gastrointestinal system symptoms include abdominal pain and diarrhea and/or conversely constipation. Pulmonary symptoms (including L√∂ffler's syndrome) can occur during pulmonary migration of the filariform larvae. Pulmonary infiltrate may be present through radiological investigation. Dermatologic manifestations include urticarial rashes in the buttocks and waist areas as well as larva currens. Eosinophilia is generally present. Strongyloidiasis can become chronic and then become completely asymptomatic. Disseminated disease Disseminated strongyloidiasis occurs when patients with chronic strongyloidiasis become immunosuppressed. There is a distinction to be made between dissemination and hyperinfection. It is mainly a semantic distinction. There can be mild dissemination where the worm burden is relatively lower yet causes insidious symptoms, or extreme dissemination that the term hyperinfection is used to describe. Thus hyperinfection of varying levels of severe dissemination may present with abdominal pain, distension, shock, pulmonary and neurologic complications, sepsis, haemorrhage, malabsorption, and depending on the combination, degree, number, and severity of symptoms, is potentially fatal. The worms enter the bloodstream from the bowel wall, simultaneously allowing entry of bowel bacteria such as Escherichia coli. This may cause symptoms such as sepsis (bloodstream infection), and the bacteria may spread to other organs where they may cause localized infection such as meningitis. Dissemination without hyperinfection may present to a lesser degree the above and many other symptoms. Dissemination can occur many decades after the initial infection and has been associated with high dose corticosteroids, organ transplant, any other instances and causes of immunosuppression, HIV, lepromatous leprosy, tertiary syphilis, aplastic anemia, malnutrition, advanced tuberculosis and radiation poisoning. It is often recommended that patients being started on immunosuppression be screened for chronic strongyloidiasis; however, this is often impractical (screen tests are often unavailable) and in developed countries, the prevalence of chronic strongyloidiasis is very small, so screening is usually not cost-effective, except in endemic areas. The reality of global travel and need for modern advanced healthcare, even in the so- called \\"developed world\\", necessitates that in non-endemic areas there is easily accessible testing and screening for neglected tropical diseases such as strongyloidiasis. It is important to note that there is not necessarily any eosinophilia in the disseminated disease. Absence of eosinophilia in an infection limited to the gastrointestinal tract may indicate poor prognosis. Eosinophilia is often absent in disseminated infection. Steroids will also suppress eosinophilia, while leading to dissemination and potential hyperinfection. Escalated disseminated infections caused by immunosuppression can result in a wide variety and variable degree of disparate symptoms depending on the condition and other biological aspects of the individual, that may emulate other diseases or diagnoses. In addition to the many palpable gastrointestinal and varied other symptoms drastic cachexia amidst lassitude is often present, although severe disseminated infections can occur in individuals without weight loss regardless of body mass index. Diagnosis Diagnosis rests on the microscopic identification of larvae (rhabditiform and occasionally filariform) in the stool or duodenal fluid. Examination of many samples may be necessary, and not always sufficient, because direct stool examination is relatively insensitive, with a single sample only able to detect larvae in about 25% of cases. It can take 4 weeks from initial infection to the passage of larvae in the stool. The stool can be examined in wet mounts: * directly * after concentration (formalin-ethyl acetate) * after recovery of the larvae by the Baermann funnel technique * after culture by the Harada-Mori filter paper technique * after culture in agar plates Culture techniques are the most sensitive, but are not routinely available in the West. In the UK, culture is available at either of the Schools of Tropical Medicine in Liverpool or London. Direct examination must be done on stool that is freshly collected and not allowed to cool down, because hookworm eggs hatch on cooling and the larvae are very difficult to distinguish from Strongyloides. Finding Strongyloides in the stool is negative in up to 70% of tests. It is important to undergo frequent stool sampling as well as duodenal biopsy if a bad infection is suspected. The duodenal fluid can be examined using techniques such as the Enterotest string or duodenal aspiration. Larvae may be detected in sputum from patients with disseminated strongyloidiasis. Given the poor ability of stool examination to diagnose strongyloides, detecting antibodies by ELISA can be useful. Serology can cross-react with other parasites, remain positive for years after successful treatment or be falsely negative in immunocompromised patients. Infected patients will also often have an elevated eosinophil count, with an average of absolute eosinophil count of 1000 in one series. Eosinophilia of a gastrointestinal infection may fluctuate in response to larval output, or may be permanently lacking in some disseminated infections. Hence lack of eosinophilia is not evidence of absence of infection. The combination of clinical suspicion, a positive antibody and a peripheral eosinophilia can be strongly suggestive of infection. It would be greatly useful to have significant advances in the sensitivity of the means of diagnosis, as it would also solve the challenging problem of proof of cure. If definitive diagnosis is solved then it stands to reason that proof of cure becomes easily realizable. Treatment The consensus drug of choice for the treatment of uncomplicated strongyloidiasis is ivermectin. However, even if it is considered the main drug of choice, recent studies have illustrated the challenges in ivermectin curing strongyloidiasis. Ivermectin does not kill the Strongyloides larvae, only the adult worms, therefore repeat dosing may be necessary to properly eradicate the infection. There is an auto-infective cycle of roughly two weeks in which ivermectin should be re-administered; however, additional dosing may still be necessary as it will not kill Strongyloides in the blood or larvae deep within the bowels or diverticula. Other drugs that can be effective are albendazole and thiabendazole (25 mg/kg twice daily for 5 days‚Äî400 mg maximum (generally)). All patients who are at risk of disseminated strongyloidiasis should be treated. The optimal duration of treatment for patients with disseminated infections is not clear. Treatment of strongyloidiasis can be difficult and if ceasing treatment before being entirely cleared Strongyloides via the autoinfective cycle has been known to live in individuals for decades; even after initial or inadequate sustained treatment. Continued treatment, blood and stool monitoring thus may be necessary even if symptoms temporarily resolve. As cited earlier, due to the fact that some infections are insidiously asymptomatic, and relatively expensive bloodwork is often inconclusive via false-positives or false-negatives, just as stool samples can be unreliable in diagnoses, there is yet unfortunately no real gold standard for proof of cure, mirroring the lack of an efficient and reliable methodology of diagnosis. An objective eradication standard for strongyloidiasis is elusive given the high degree of suspicion needed to even begin treatment, the sometimes difficulty of the only definitive diagnostic criteria of detecting and isolating larvae or adult strongyloides, the importance of early diagnosis, particularly before steroid treatments, and the very wide variability and exclusion/inclusion of differing collections of diffuse symptoms. Disregarding mis-ascribing bonafide delusional parasitosis disorders, strongyloidiasis should be more well known among medical professionals and have serious consideration for broad educational campaigns in effected geographic locales both within the semi-tropical developed world and otherwise, as well as in the tropical developing world where, among many other neglected tropical diseases, it is endemic. Government programs are needed to help decontaminate endemic areas and to help effected populations from infection. Furthermore, progress is required in establishing financial support to facilitate and cover affordable medications for individuals in effected at-risk regions and communities to help continuing treatments. There are conflicting reports on effective drug treatments. Ivermectin ineffectiveness and rising drug resistance has been documented. Albendazole is noted by the WHO as being the least effective. Thiabendazole can have severe side effects and is unavailable in many countries. Major inroads are required to advance the development of successful medications and drug protocols for strongyloidiasis and other neglected tropical diseases. Contagiousness via textiles, unlike enterobius vermicularis, is unfounded. As is, generally speaking, person to person contagiousness of asymptomatic and disseminated infection. It has rarely been transmitted through organ transplantation. Married Vietnam War veterans who were infected, yet never developed significant hyperinfection, lived for multiple decades with non-debilitating disseminated infection, without treatment, with wives who failed to ever contract infection. Contraction occurs overwhelmingly from skin exposure to any contaminated soil, contaminated potting soil, contaminated waters, lack of sanitation, or environmental factors as potential vectors. Nearly never to extraordinarily very rarely documented is transmission from person to person (besides from infected male homosexual sex), other than closeness of contact to the productive coughing of a very ill hyperinfected individual. It has been shown possible to occur in that situation, or potentially other similar scenarios, it is speculated via pulmonary secretions of a direly hyperinfected individual. In which case treatment for others may be indicated, if deemed necessary by proximity, symptoms, precautions, probable exposures to the same vectors, or through screening of serology and stool samples, until infection is eradicated. Before administering steroids at least somewhat screening for infection in even remotely potentially susceptible individuals in order to prevent escalating the infection is advised. As not doing so in certain cohorts can have extremely high mortality rates from inadvertently caused hyperinfection via immunosuppression of application of certain steroids. Thus extreme caution with respect to iatrogenic risks is crucial to avoiding deaths or other adverse consequences in treatment, that of course prefigures a correct diagnosis. Epidemiology Low estimates postulate it to affect 30‚Äì100 million people worldwide, mainly in tropical and subtropical countries, while higher estimates conservatively extrapolate that infection is upwards to or above 370 million people. It belongs to the group of neglected tropical diseases, and worldwide efforts are aimed at eradicating the infection. History The disease was first recognized in 1876 by the French physician Louis Alexis Normand, working in the naval hospital in Toulon; he identified the adult worms, and sent them to Arthur R√©n√© Jean Baptiste Bavay, chief inspector for health, who observed that these were the adult forms of the larvae found in the stool. In 1883 the German parasitologist Rudolf Leuckart made initial observations on the life cycle of the parasite, and Belgian physician Paul Van Durme (building on observations by the German parasitologist Arthur Looss) described the mode of infection through the skin. The German parasitologist Friedrich F√ºlleborn described autoinfection and the way by which strongyloidiasis involves the intestine. Interest in the condition increased in the 1940s when it was discovered that those who had acquired the infection abroad and then received immunosuppression developed hyperinfestation syndrome.

He was a leading pass-blocker and rusher in the late 1940s and early 1950s, and ended his career with an average of 5.7 yards per carry, a record for running backs that still stands. A versatile player who possessed both quickness and size, Motley was a force on both offense and defense. Fellow Hall of Fame running back Joe Perry once called Motley \\"the greatest all- around football player there ever was\\". Motley was also one of the first two African-Americans to play professional football in the modern era, breaking the color barrier along with teammate Bill Willis in September 1946, when the two played their first game for the Cleveland Browns.Gary Webster, The League That Didn't Exist: A History of the All-America Football Conference. Jefferson, NC: McFarland & Co., 2019; pp. 1-2. Motley grew up in Canton, Ohio. He played football through high school and college in the 1930s before enlisting in the military during World War II. While training in the U.S. Navy in 1944, he played for a service team coached by Paul Brown. Following the war, he went back to work in Canton before Brown invited him to try out for the Cleveland Browns, a team he was coaching in the newly formed AAFC. Motley made the team in 1946 and became a cornerstone of Cleveland's success in the late 1940s. The team won four AAFC championships before the league dissolved and the Browns were absorbed by the more established NFL. Motley was the AAFC's leading rusher in 1948 and the NFL leader in 1950, when the Browns won another championship. Motley and fellow black teammate Bill Willis contended with racism throughout their careers. Although the color barrier was broken in all major American sports by 1950, the men endured shouted insults on the field and racial discrimination off of it. \\"They found out that while they were calling us niggers and alligator bait, I was running for touchdowns and Willis was knocking the shit out of them,\\" Motley once said. \\"So they stopped calling us names and started trying to catch up with us.\\" Focused exclusively on winning, Brown did not tolerate racism within the team. Slowed by knee injuries, Motley left the Browns after the 1953 season. He attempted a comeback in 1955 as a linebacker for the Pittsburgh Steelers but was released before the end of the year. He then pursued a coaching career, but was turned away by the Browns and other teams he approached. He attributed his trouble finding a job in football to racial discrimination, questioning whether teams were ready to hire a black coach. Motley was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1968. Early years and college career Motley was born in Leesburg, Georgia and raised in Canton, Ohio, where his family moved when he was three years old. After going to elementary and junior high schools in Canton, Motley attended Canton McKinley High School, where he played on the football and basketball teams. He was especially good as a football fullback, and the McKinley Bulldogs posted a win-loss record of 25‚Äì3 during his tenure there. The team's three losses all came against Canton's chief rivals, a Massillon Washington High School team led by coach Paul Brown. After he graduated, Motley enrolled in 1939 at South Carolina State College, a historically black school in Orangeburg, South Carolina. He transferred before his sophomore year to the University of Nevada, where he was a star on the football team between 1941 and 1943. As a punishing fullback for the Wolf Pack, Motley played against powerful West Coast teams including USF, Santa Clara, and St. Mary's. He suffered a knee injury in 1943 and returned to Canton to work after dropping out of school. Military and professional career As United States involvement in World War II intensified, Motley joined the U.S. Navy in 1944 and was sent to the Great Lakes Naval Training Station. There he played for the Great Lakes Navy Bluejackets, a military team coached by Paul Brown, who was serving in the Navy during an extended leave from his job as head coach of The Ohio State University's football team. Motley played fullback and linebacker at Great Lakes, and was an important component of the team's offense and defense. The highlight of his time at Great Lakes was a 39‚Äì7 victory over Notre Dame in 1945. Motley was eligible for discharge before the game ‚Äì it was the final match of the season and the last military game of World War II ‚Äì but he stayed on to play. Motley put up an impressive performance, thanks in part to Brown's experimentation with a new play: a delayed handoff later called the draw play. After the war, Motley went back to Canton and began working at a steel mill, planning to return to Reno in 1946 to finish his degree. That summer, however, Paul Brown was coaching a team in the new All-America Football Conference (AAFC) called the Cleveland Browns. Motley wrote to Brown asking for a tryout, but Brown declined, saying he already had all the fullbacks he needed. At the beginning of August, however, Brown invited Bill Willis, another African-American star, to try out for the team at its training camp in Bowling Green, Ohio. Ten days later, Brown invited Motley to come, too. \\"I think they felt [Willis] needed a roommate,\\" Motley later said. \\"I don't think they felt I'd make the team. I'm glad I was able to fool them.\\" Both Motley and Willis made the team and became two of the first African-Americans to play professional football in the modern era. The Los Angeles Rams of the National Football League had signed the only other black players in pro football earlier that year: Kenny Washington and Woody Strode. The four men broke football's color barrier a seven months before Jackie Robinson was promoted from the Class AAA Montreal Royals to join the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947. Motley felt the Browns would likely be his only opportunity to make a career of football. \\"I knew this was the one big chance in my life to rise above the steel mill existence, and I really wanted to take it,\\" he said. Motley was signed to a contract worth $4,500 a year ($ in dollars). With the Browns, he joined a potent offense led by quarterback Otto Graham, tackle and placekicker Lou Groza and receivers Dante Lavelli and Mac Speedie. He was a force to be reckoned with in the AAFC, and helped the team win every championship in the league's four years of existence between 1946 and 1949. He had a combination of quickness and power ‚Äì he was listed at 238 pounds ‚Äì that helped him plow through tacklers. He was also an able pass blocker and played on defense as a linebacker. Motley rushed for an average of 8.2 yards per carry in his first season. His forte was the trap play, a scheme where a defensive lineman was allowed to come across the line of scrimmage unblocked, opening up space for Motley to run. He led the league in rushing in 1948 as the Browns posted a perfect 15‚Äì0 record. He was the AAFC's all-time rushing leader when the league folded after the 1949 season and the Browns were absorbed into the more established National Football League (NFL). The Browns had a 47‚Äì4‚Äì3 overall regular-season win-loss-tie record during the AAFC years as Motley rushed for a total of 3,024 yards. Like other black players in the 1940s and 1950s, Motley faced racist attitudes both on and off the field. Paul Brown would not tolerate discrimination within the team; he wanted to win and would not let anything get in his way. Motley and Willis, however, were sometimes stepped on and called names during games. \\"Sometimes I wanted to just kill some of those guys, and the officials would just stand right there,\\" Motley said many years later. \\"They'd see those guys stepping on us and heard them saying things and just turn their backs. That kind of crap went on for two or three years until they found out what kind of players we were.\\" Motley and Willis did not travel to one game against the Miami Seahawks in the Browns' early years after they received threatening letters. Another time in Miami, Motley and Willis were told they were not welcome at the hotel where the team was staying. Brown threatened to relocate the entire team, and the hotel's management backed down. Attitudes toward race in America began to change after the war, which had caused social and political upheaval and prompted people to think about the future with more ambition and confidence. Although progress was slow and racially motivated hostility continued for many years, the color barrier was broken in all major sports by 1950. Many of Motley and Willis's teammates on the Browns were used to playing with black players in college, where teams were integrated across most of the country. The presence of Motley and Willis, meanwhile, contributed to strong attendance at many of the Browns' early games as large black audiences came to watch them. By one estimate, 10,000 black fans saw the Browns play their first game. Aided by Motley's swiftness and size, the Browns won the NFL championship in 1950, their first season in the league. In October 1950, Motley set an NFL record that stood for more than 52 years when he averaged over 17 yards per rush against the Pittsburgh Steelers, with 188 yards on 11 carries. In December 2002, quarterback Michael Vick of the Atlanta Falcons rushed for 173 yards on 10 carries against the Minnesota Vikings, eclipsing Motley's average. Motley also had a 69-yard rushing and 33-yard receiving touchdowns in the game. While Motley did not factor in the Browns' championship game win against the Los Angeles Rams, he led the league in rushing with 810 yards in 1950 despite averaging fewer than 12 carries per game. He was a unanimous first- team All-Pro selection. By the 1951 season, Motley started to feel the physical effects of his hard-hitting, up-the-middle running style. He suffered a knee injury in training camp, and he was getting older; by the time the season was in full swing, he was 31. Motley only ran for 273 yards and one touchdown that year, an uncharacteristically low total. Despite Motley's troubles, the Browns made the championship game again after winning the American Conference with an 11‚Äì1 record. Cleveland, however, lost the title game to the Rams, 24‚Äì17. Motley had just five carries and 23 yards. Motley's knees continued to bother him in 1952. While he showed occasional signs of his old form that season, it became clear to the Browns' coaching staff that he was no longer in his prime. Motley finished the year with 444 yards of rushing and 4.3 yards per carry, a career low. The Browns finished with an 8‚Äì4 record but still captured the conference title and secured another spot in the NFL championship game. Motley performed well in that matchup against the Detroit Lions, rushing for 95 yards. The Browns, however, lost 17‚Äì7. The 1953 season was no better for Motley, whose effectiveness was again limited by injury. Cleveland finished with an 11‚Äì1 record and faced Detroit in the championship for the second year in a row. As Motley's production declined, the Browns relied on Otto Graham's passing to Lavelli and receiver Ray Renfro, who also lined up as a running back. Motley did not participate in the championship game that year, another loss to the Lions. Motley thought he could come back and play a ninth season in 1954, and showed up to training camp to prove it. Paul Brown, however, thought otherwise. Dogged by injuries and 34 years old, Motley quit before the season began, after Brown said he would otherwise be cut from the team. \\"Marion realized that his knee was weak and did not feel that it was coming around,\\" Brown said at the time. \\"He was one of the truly fine fullbacks in his prime, the type that comes along once in a lifetime. I certainly never will forget some of his runs and I imagine Cleveland football fans feel the same.\\" Motley took the 1954 season off and attempted a comeback in 1955 after the Browns, who still had rights to Motley under his contract, traded him to the Pittsburgh Steelers for Ed Modzelewski. In Pittsburgh he played seven games as a linebacker, but the Steelers released him before the end of the season. In his eight years in the AAFC and NFL, Motley had rushed for 4,720 yards and averaged 5.7 yards per carry. His career rushing average is still an all-time record for running backs. Later life and death After ending his playing career for good, Motley asked Brown about a coaching job with the team. Brown, however, rejected his overtures, saying Motley should instead look for work at a steel mill ‚Äì the very career football was his ticket out of. Unable to find coaching opportunities in the NFL, he worked as a whisky salesman in the early 1960s. He got occasional scouting assignments from the Browns, but as the Civil Rights Movement began to coalesce in 1965, he issued a statement saying he had been refused a permanent coaching position by the team numerous times. He applied for a coaching job in 1964, he wrote, and was told that there were no vacancies. The Browns then hired Bob Nussbaumer as an assistant. \\"When I heard of the hiring of a new assistant, I began to wonder if the full reason is whether or not the time is ripe to hire a Negro coach in Cleveland on the professional level,\\" he wrote. Art Modell, the Browns' owner, responded by saying the team filled its coaching positions based on ability and experience, not race. \\"We are represented by scouts at every major Negro school. And we now have 12 Negroes signed for the 1965 season,\\" he said. Motley asked Otto Graham for a job with the Washington Redskins when Graham was head coach there in the late 1960s, but he was again turned away. Motley also signed on to coach an all-girl professional football team called the Cleveland Dare Devils in 1967. By 1969, the team had only played a few exhibition games as Cleveland theatrical agent Syd Freedman struggled to drum up interest in a women's league. Later in life, Motley worked for the U.S. postal service in Cleveland, Harry Miller Excavating Suffield, Ohio, the Ohio Lottery and for the Ohio Department of Youth Services in Akron. He died in 1999, twenty-two days after his 79th birthday, of prostate cancer. Honors and legacy In 1968, Motley became the second black player voted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, located in his hometown of Canton. Having played successfully as a fullback and pass blocker on offense and as a linebacker on defense, he is seen as one of the best all-around players in football history. Blanton Collier, an assistant who took over as the team's head coach after Paul Brown's firing in 1963, said Motley \\"had no equal as a blocker. He could run with anybody for 30 yards or so. And this man was a great, great linebacker.\\" Most of Motley's runs were trap plays up the middle, but he had the speed to run outside. \\"There's no telling how much yardage I might have made if I ran as much as some backs do now,\\" he once said. Running back Jim Brown surpassed Motley's rushing records in the early 1960s, but many of Motley's coaches and fellow players regarded Motley as the better player, in part because of his strength as a blocker. \\"There is no comparison between Jim Brown and Marion Motley,\\" Graham said at a luncheon in Canton in 1964. \\"Motley was the greatest all-around fullback.\\" In his books The Thinking Man's Guide to Pro Football and The New Thinking Man's Guide To Pro Football, football writer Paul Zimmerman of Sports Illustrated called Motley the best player in the history of the sport. He was named to the NFL's 75th Anniversary All-Time Team in 1994. In November 2019, Motley was selected as one of the twelve running backs on the NFL 100 All-Time Team.NFL 100 All- Time Team running backs revealed ReferencesFurther reading   * External links * * Category:1920 births Category:1999 deaths Category:American football fullbacks Category:Cleveland Browns (AAFC) players Category:Cleveland Browns players Category:Great Lakes Navy Bluejackets football players Category:Nevada Wolf Pack football players Category:Pittsburgh Steelers players Category:Eastern Conference Pro Bowl players Category:Pro Football Hall of Fame inductees Category:South Carolina State University alumni Category:People from Leesburg, Georgia Category:Players of American football from Georgia (U.S. state) Category:African-American players of American football ","title":"Marion Motley"},{"id":"1494046","text":"Edward Granville Browne Edward Granville Browne Edward Granville Browne, FBA (7 February 1862 ‚Äì 5 January 1926) was a British orientalist. He published numerous articles and books, mainly in the areas of history and literature. Life Browne was born in Stouts Hill, Uley, Gloucestershire, England, the son of civil engineer Benjamin Chapman Browne and his wife, Annie. He was educated at Trinity College, Glenalmond, Burnside's School in Berkshire, Eton College, and the Newcastle College of Physical Science. He then read natural sciences at Pembroke College, Cambridge. He also studied Arabic with Edward Henry Palmer and William Wright, Persian with Edward Byles Cowell, and Turkish with Sir James Redhouse, motivated by an interest in the Turkish people. After graduating in 1882 he travelled to Constantinople. Browne then spent a further two years at University of Cambridge studying the languages of India (defined then as Hindustani, Sanskrit, Persian, and Arabic) and also gained an M.B. in London.Buck, Christopher. ‚ÄúEdward Granville Browne.‚Äù British Writers, Supplement XXI. Ed. Jay Parini. Farmington Hills, MI: Charles Scribner‚Äôs Sons/The Gale Group, 2014. Pp. 17‚Äì33. In 1887 he was made a Fellow of Pembroke, and then paid an extended visit to Iran. He returned to become university lecturer in Persian. In April 1902 he was elected Sir Thomas Adams's Professor of Arabic at the University of Cambridge. Browne was mainly responsible for the creation at Cambridge of a school of living languages of Asia, in connection with the training of candidates for the Egyptian and Sudanese civil services, and the Lebanese consular service. He was on his sixtieth birthday the recipient of a large Festschrift.A Volume of Oriental Studies Presented to Edward G. Browne, M.A., M.B., F.B.A., F.R.C.P., Sir Thomas Adam's Professor of Arabic in the University of Cambridge on the 60th Birthday (7 February 1922), ed. by T. W. Arnold and Reynold A. Nicholson (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1922). Family Browne married Alice Caroline, daughter of Francis Henry Blackburne Daniell in 1906, and had two sons. He died in 1926 in Cambridge. Works Browne published in areas which few other Western scholars had explored. Many of his publications are related to Iran, either in the fields of history or Persian literature. He is perhaps best known for his documentation and historical narratives of B√°bism as relayed by Arthur de Gobineau. He published two translations of B√°b√≠ histories, and wrote several of the few Western accounts of early B√°b√≠ and Bah√° º√≠ history. Browne was not a Bah√° º√≠, but rather an Orientalist. His interest in the B√°b√≠ movement was piqued by a book by de Gobineau found while he was looking for materials on tasawwuf. The history A Traveller's Narrative was written by \`Abdu'l-Bah√° and translated by Browne, who added a large introduction and appendices. Browne was fascinated by the development of the written historical perspectives of the Bah√° º√≠s regarding successorship after the B√°b including their idea of an independent dispensation of Bah√°'u'll√°h. These Bah√° º√≠-authored works emphasized Bah√°'u'll√°h to a greater extent than the B√°b and took a critical view against Subh-i-Azal, whom Arthur de Gobineau listed as the B√°b's successor. Browne expressed sympathy for Subh-i-Azal and surprise at the route the religion had taken. About the Bah√° º√≠ teachings he says: In A Year Among the Persians (1893) he wrote a sympathetic portrayal of Persian society. After his death in 1926 it was reprinted and became a classic in English travel literature. He also published the first volume of A Literary History of Persia in 1902 with subsequent volumes in 1906, 1920, and 1924. It remains a standard authority. Among Iranians, Browne is well remembered today. A street named after him in Tehran, as well as his statue, remained even after the Iranian Revolution in 1979.

The flag carrying the seal of the Philippine President is hoisted outside the cockpit of Philippine Airlines Flight PR001 during President Rodrigo Duterte's official visit to Myanmar in March 2017. The Seal of the President of the Philippines () is a symbol used to represent the history and dignity of the President of the Philippines. Its original form was designed by Captain Galo B. Ocampo, Secretary of the Philippine Heraldry Committee, and patterned after the Seal of the President of the United States.Executive Order No. 310, Manuel L. Quezon III, May 29, 2005 It was first used by President Manuel Roxas in 1947. Description and Symbolism The seal is composed of the coat of arms of the president, which, according to Executive Order ‚Ññ 310 of 2004 consists of: The Seal of the President of the Philippines shall consist of the Coat-Of-Arms of the President of the Philippines, and a white circle around the Coat-of-Arms enclosed by two (2) golden-yellow marginal rings. The white circle shall contain the words SAGISAG NG PANGULO NG PILIPINAS (\\"Seal of the President of the Philippines\\") in black letters on the upper arc, the lower arc divided by three (3) five-pointed golden-yellow stars. Some of the symbols in the arms are derived from the National Flag, and retain their meaning. The eight-rayed sun represent the eight provinces placed under martial law in 1896 at the onset of the Philippine Revolution. On the sun there is an equilateral triangle (colored red as opposed to the Flag's white), representing liberty, equality, and fraternity, which were ideals of the Revolution. The stars at the corners of the triangle represent the three major island groups of Luz√≥n, Visayas and Mindanao. At the center of the coat-of-arms is a Sea-lion, which is derived from the coat-of-arms of the City of Manila granted by Philip II of Spain in 1596. It has the upper half of a lion, and the lower half and curled tail of a fish. The Sea-lion as a heraldic device ultimately comes from the lion on the coat-of-arms of Castile and Le√≥n; since the islands were an overseas (ultramar) possession, the lion became a sea lion. History The seal was first used by President Manuel Roxas in 1947. It was designed by Captain Galo B. Ocampo of the Philippine Heraldry Committee, who also designed the Coat of arms of the Philippines. The Seal was officially prescribed on January 7, 1947, when Executive Order ‚Ññ 38 of 1947 was signed into law. It prescribed the coat of arms and seal of the President as: On July 4, 1951, President Elpidio Quirino, signed Executive Order ‚Ññ 457 into law prescribing that: : At the time of signing, the Philippines had 52 provinces. On August 27, 1998, President Joseph Estrada signed Executive Order ‚Ññ 19, amending Executive Order ‚Ññ 38 of 1947 (as amended) in view of the fact that 1951, the number of provinces has increased to 78 and that there is a need to synchronize the number of stars to match the number of provinces at a given time. After Estrada's Executive Order came into law, Roxas's Executive Order read: On April 20, 2004, President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo signed Executive Order ‚Ññ 310, which standardized the Seal and its derivative material. The Seal as it appears on government documents and property has since been redesigned to conform with the Executive Order.

Life The fourth of the five Schlagintweit brothers of Munich joined his brothers Hermann and Adolf at an early age in their Alpine researches and jointly published Neue Untersuchungen √ºber die physikalische Geographie und Geologie der Alpen in 1854. In 1854, acting on the recommendation of Alexander von Humboldt, the East India Company commissioned Hermann, Adolf, and Robert to make scientific investigations in their territory and particularly to study the Earth's magnetic field. For the next three years they travelled through the Deccan, then up into the Himalayas, Karakoram, and Kunlun mountains. Hermann and Robert were the first Europeans to cross the Kunlun. Subsequently Robert returned to Europe, and became a professor of geography at the university of Giessen in 1863. He made several trips to America between 1867 and 1870. Starting in Boston with the Lowell Institute with a series of twelve lectures on \\"Orography and Physical Geography of High Asia,\\"Harriet Knight Smith, The history of the Lowell Institute, Boston: Lamson, Wolffe and Co., 1898. he gave lectures throughout the United States.

He is a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame, the College Football Hall of Fame, and was a member of the Chiefs' team that won Super Bowl IV against the Minnesota Vikings.  High school career  Bobby excelled in several sports at a then-segregated Cleveland High School in Shelby, North Carolina. In the first two years, he played six-man football, playing under center the position halfback. During his junior year, his school converted to playing with an 11-man team where Bell served as quarterback. He won All-State honors.  College career  At the University of Minnesota, Bell was switched to the defensive line. He was a two-time All-American (1961 and 1962) and the winner of the 1962 Outland Trophy, which is given to the nation's most outstanding interior lineman. He also finished third in Heisman Trophy voting. The Gophers with Bell were the 1960 National Champions, played in the 1961 Rose Bowl, and won the 1962 Rose Bowl. Bell was later inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame. He joined Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity, via the Mu Chapter, while at the University of Minnesota. At the age of 74, he completed his college degree at Minnesota by finishing the three remaining courses he required. He graduated on May 14, 2015, some 50 years after leaving college to play professional football. Professional football career He played for the Kansas City Chiefs, first in the American Football League from 1963 through 1969, and then in the NFL from 1970 through 1974. Bell was an AFL All-Star for six consecutive years, 1964 through 1969, and then an NFL Pro Bowler for three straight years (1970-1972). He was on two AFL Championship teams and a World Championship team. He was named to the All-Time All-AFL Team in 1970. He was inducted into the Chiefs Hall of Fame in 1980, and the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1983. The Chiefs retired his uniform number 78. In 1999, he was ranked number 66 on The Sporting News' list of the 100 Greatest Football Players. One of Bell's finest moments came in the 1969 AFL divisional playoff game against the New York Jets. In a critical goal line stand, his key coverage on Jets running back Matt Snell stopped the drive and forced New York to kick a field goal. The 13-6 victory over the Jets propelled Kansas City to its first Super Bowl triumph. During a regular season game against Denver (11/27), the Broncos, trailing 24‚Äì17 late in the game, attempted an onside kick that was recovered by Bell, who promptly returned that kick for a 53-yard touchdown.Chiefs History: 1960's KCChiefs.com, retrieved January 1, 2007. Bell was noted for his one-of-a-kind athleticism at 6' 4\\" and 230 pounds and was reported to have run a 4.5 40-yard dash. Bell was possibly the most physically gifted linebacker in professional football history, for his speed at such a size made him ideal at outside linebacker. He was noted as one of the finest open-field tacklers in professional football history. He was also a great blitzer from the linebacker position. Chiefs records show Bell had 40 career quarterback sacks and he might have had more if he had played right linebacker, not the left linebacker. In that era, more often than not the right-side linebacker got the call to \\"dog\\" or blitz since more often than not the tight end would be lined up right, on the defense's left. Bell scored 9 touchdowns in his career: 6 off interceptions (tied for most in NFL history for a linebacker with Derrick Brooks), 2 more touchdowns off fumble recoveries, and one off an onside kickoff return. Coach Hank Stram said that, \\"He could play all 22 positions on the field, and play them well.\\" In addition to all that, he was regarded as one of the greatest long snapper centers for field goals and points-after-touchdowns in NCAA and AFL/NFL history. After football After his retirement, he opened Bobby Bell's Bar-b-que in Kansas City, Missouri. On August 22, 2016, The Tournament of Roses announced Bobby Bell, Ricky Ervins, Tommy Prothro, and Art Spander would be inducted into Rose Bowl Hall of Fame as the Class of 2016. The Rose Bowl Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony then took place on January 1, 2017, outside the Rose Bowl Stadium, one day before the kickoff of the 103rd Rose Bowl game on Monday January 2, 2017.

The term was coined by Victoria Strauss of Writer Beware, as a parallel formation from diploma mill, an unaccredited college or university that offers degrees without regard to academic achievement, and puppy mill, a breeding operation that produces large numbers of puppies for sale with little regard for breed purity, puppy placement, health, or socialization. Predatory open access publishing is a closely related practice. However, the aims and the business model are rather different: predatory publishers will charge the author up front for publishing in a supposed scientific journal. Since academic evaluation is largely based on publication count or other bibliometrics, even well-meaning authors may be willing to pay to bolster their career prospects. Definition As described by Writer Beware, an author mill is: Victoria Strauss has used the examples of PublishAmerica and VDM Publishing to illustrate the concept of author mill. More precisely, she has characterized VDM as \\"an academic author mill\\". Business model Typically an author mill does the cheapest possible job of production; it sets high cover prices and prints its books \\"on demand.\\" The books are listed with on-line booksellers such as amazon.com and bn.com, and on the publisher's website. Any marketing, promotion, or physical bookstore placement is up to the authors themselves. While authors are not \\"required\\" to buy any of their own books, authors who wish to find readers discover that they need to buy their own books for resale. The rise of the author mill is based on the rise of the on-line bookselling industry and digital printing technology which makes it cheap to print books on demand. The necessary ingredients are: * Minimal editorial gatekeeping * Low production costs (acquiring/editing/designing the book) * Low set-up charges for reproducing the book * The power to set the cover price high enough to make a profit on a small number of average sales * A relatively predictable number of sales to the author, the author's family, and the author's friends.

Hand-to-hand combat (sometimes abbreviated as HTH or H2H) is a physical confrontation between two or more persons at very short range (grappling distance, or within the physical reach of a handheld weapon) that does not involve the use of ranged weapons.Hunsicker, A., Advanced Skills in Executive Protection, Boca Raton FL: Universal Publishers, , , p. 51 While the phrase \\"hand-to-hand\\" appears to refer to unarmed combat, the term is generic and may include use of melee weapons such as knives, sticks, batons, spears, or improvised weapons such as entrenching tools. While the term hand-to-hand combat originally referred principally to engagements by combatants on the battlefield, it can also refer to any personal physical engagement by two or more people, including law enforcement officers, civilians, and criminals. Combat within close quarters (to a range just beyond grappling distance) is commonly termed close combat or close-quarters combat. It may include lethal and non-lethal weapons and methods depending upon the restrictions imposed by civilian law, military rules of engagement, or ethical codes. Close combat using firearms or other distance weapons by military combatants at the tactical level is modernly referred to as close quarter battle. The United States Army uses the term combatives to describe various military fighting systems used in hand-to- hand combat training, systems which may incorporate eclectic techniques from several different martial arts and combat sports. History Hand-to-hand combat is the most ancient form of fighting known. A majority of cultures have their own particular histories related to close combat, and their own methods of practice. The pankration, which was practiced in Ancient Greece and Rome, is an example of a form which involved nearly all strikes and holds, with biting and gouging being the only exceptions (although allowed in Sparta). Many modern varieties of martial arts, such as boxing and wrestling, were also practiced historically. Other historical forms of close combat include the gladiator spectacles of ancient Rome and medieval tournament events such as jousting. Military organizations have always taught some sort of unarmed combat for conditioning and as a supplement to armed combat. Soldiers in China were trained in unarmed combat as early as the Zhou Dynasty (1022 BCE to 256 BCE). Despite major technological changes such as the use of gunpowder, the machine gun in the Russo-Japanese War and the trench warfare of World War I, hand-to-hand fighting methods such as bayonet remained common in modern military training, though the importance of formal training declined after 1918. By 1944 some German rifles were being produced without bayonet lugs. Modern hand-to-hand combat techniques The centre of the International Settlement of Shanghai, 1928. Close Quarters Combat (CQC), or World War II combatives, was largely codified by William Ewart Fairbairn and Eric Anthony Sykes. Also known for their eponymous Fairbairn-Sykes fighting knife, Fairbairn and Sykes had worked in the Shanghai Municipal Police of the International Settlement (1854‚Äì1943) of Shanghai in the 1920s, widely acknowledged as the most dangerous port city in the world due to a heavy opium trade run by organized crime (the Chinese Triads). CQC was derived from a mixture of judo, jujutsu, boxing, wrestling and street fighting. After the May Thirtieth Movement riots, which resulted in a police massacre, Fairbairn was charged with developing an auxiliary squad for riot control and aggressive policing. After absorbing the most appropriate elements from a variety of martial-arts experts, from China, Japan and elsewhere, he condensed these arts into a practical combat system he called Defendu. He and his police team went on to field-test these skills on the streets of Shanghai; Fairbairn himself used his combat system effectively in over 2000 documented encounters, including over 600 lethal-force engagements.Chambers, John W.; Fairbairn, W. E. OSS Training in the National Parks and Service Abroad in World War II, Washington, D.C., U.S. National Park Service (2008), p. 191 (PDF), Archived from the original on April 13, 2014 The aim of his combat system was simply to be as brutally effective as possible. It was also a system that, unlike traditional Eastern martial-arts that required years of intensive training, could be digested by recruits relatively quickly. The method incorporated training in point shooting and gun combat techniques, as well as the effective use of more ad hoc weapons such as chairs or table legs. During the Second World War, Fairbairn was brought back to Britain, and, after demonstrating the effectiveness of his techniques, was recruited to train the British commandos in his combat method. During this period, he expanded his 'Shanghai Method' into the 'Silent Killing Close Quarters Combat method' for military application. This became standard combat training for all British Special Operations personnel. He also designed the pioneering Fairbairn-Sykes fighting knife, which was adopted for use by British and American Special Forces. In 1942, he published a textbook for close quarters combat training called Get Tough.Fairbairn, W. E. Get Tough! Paladin Press, 1 December 1996. Retrieved October 12, 2014 U.S. Army officers Rex Applegate and Anthony Biddle were taught Fairbairn's methods at a training facility in Scotland, and adopted the program for the training of OSS operatives at a newly opened camp near Lake Ontario in Canada. Applegate published his work in 1943, called Kill or Get Killed. During the war, training was provided to British Commandos, the Devil's Brigade, OSS, U.S. Army Rangers and Marine Raiders. Other combat systems designed for military combat were introduced elsewhere, including European Unifight, Soviet/Russian Sambo, Army hand-to-hand fight, Chinese military Sanshou/Sanda, Israeli Kapap and Krav Maga. The prevalence and style of hand-to-hand combat training often changes based on perceived need. Elite units such as special forces and commando units tend to place higher emphasis on hand-to-hand combat training. Although hand-to-hand fighting was accorded less importance in major militaries after World War II, insurgency conflicts such as the Vietnam War, low intensity conflict and urban warfare have prompted many armies to pay more attention to this form of combat. When such fighting includes firearms designed for close-in fighting, it is often referred to as Close Quarters Battle (CQB) at the platoon or squad level, or Military Operations on Urban Terrain (MOUT) at higher tactical levels. Modern usage The chokehold demonstrated in hand-to-hand combat training. Iran Army Hand-to-Hand Combat Badge A 2014 study found that, amongst US soldiers deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan between 2004 and 2008, 19% reported the use of hand-to-hand techniques in at least one encounter, in a variety of circumstances and contexts (such as close combat, prisoner handling, crowd control and security checkpoints), supporting prior research that indicated that, despite advances in technology, hand-to-hand combat remained a persistent aspect of modern warfare.Jensen, Peter R. Hand-to-Hand Combat and the Use of Combatives Skills: An Analysis of United States Army Post Combat Surveys from 2004-2008. MILITARY ACADEMY WEST POINT NY CENTER FOR ENHANCED PERFORMANCE, 2014. Hand-to-hand combat is the principal form of combat during skirmishes between Indian Army and Chinese People's Liberation Army soldiers along the disputed Himalayan border between India and the People's Republic of China. While Chinese and Indian soldiers carry firearms, due to decades of tradition designed to reduce the possibility of an escalation, agreements disallow usage of firearms along this border. In the 2020 China‚ÄìIndia skirmishes, hand-to-hand combat involving stones, batons, iron rods, and other makeshift weapons resulted in the deaths of over 50 soldiers on both sides over six hours of fighting. Military systems * In 2002, the U.S. Army adopted the Modern Army Combatives (MAC) hand-to-hand combat training program with the publishing of U.S. Army field manual (FM 3-25.150) and the establishment of the U.S. Army Combatives School at Ft Benning, Georgia. * The U.S. Air Force adopted MAC as its hand-to-hand combat system in early 2008. * In the U.S. Marine Corps, Marine Corps Martial Arts Program (MCMAP) replaced the Marine Corps LINE combat system in 2002. Each Marine keeps a record book that records their training, and a colored belt system (tan, gray, green, brown, and black in order of precedence) is used to denote experience and skill level, similar to many Asian martial arts.

Football career=Jackson State Barney attended Jackson State University, a historically black university in Jackson, Mississippi. His son Lem Barney the 3rd and Grandson Lem Barney the 4th also followed in his footsteps and graduated from Jackson State. He played college football for the Jackson State Tigers football team from 1964 to 1966 under head coach Rod Paige. He had 26 career interceptions at Jackson State, including nine in 1965 and 11 in 1966. He also had punt averages of 41.7 and 42.5 in those two seasons. Barney was an All-Southwestern Athletic Conference selection three straight years. He was also selected as an All-American by Ebony magazine and the Pittsburgh Courier. Detroit Lions Barney was selected by the Detroit Lions in the second round, 34th overall pick, of the 1967 NFL Draft. As a rookie in 1967, Barney appeared in all 14 games as a starting cornerback and led the NFL with 10 interceptions, 232 interception return yards and three interceptions returned for touchdowns. After an injury to Pat Studstill, Barney also took over as the Lions' punter, punting 47 times for an average of 37.4 yards in 1967. On September 17, 1967, in the first quarter of his first NFL game, Barney intercepted the first pass thrown in his direction by Bart Starr and returned it 24 yards for a touchdown. In the final game of his rookie season, Barney intercepted three passes within ten minutes and returned one 71 yards for a touchdown. At the end of the 1967 season, he was selected by the Associated Press as the NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year. After the 1967 season, Barney played in the 1968 Pro Bowl, and in the off- season, he was married and also served six months of active duty in the Navy. Barney went on to be selected to seven Pro Bowls and was selected as a first- team All-NFL player in 1968 and 1969. During his 11 years in the NFL, Barney had 56 interceptions, 1,011 interception return yards, and seven interceptions returned for touchdowns. He also returned 143 punts for 1,312 yards and three touchdowns as well as 50 kickoff returns for 1,274 yards, including a 98-yard return for touchdown. Retirement In March 1978, as part of a wiretap investigation into international drug smuggling, Barney's voice was heard allegedly discussing cocaine and amphetamines. Although investigators stated that Barney was not the focus of the investigation, the controversy received extensive press attention through the spring of 1978, as Barney was called to testify before a New York grand jury. In August 1978, the Lions placed Barney on the injured waiver list. Barney's efforts to sign with another team were unsuccessful, and he did not play during the 1978 season. He was officially released by the Lions in February 1979. Awards and honors After retiring as a player, Barney received numerous honors, including the following: * In 1980, he was inducted into the Detroit Lions Hall of Fame. * In 1983, he was inducted into the Jackson State Sports Hall of Fame. * In 1985, he was inducted into the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame. * In 1986, he was inducted into the Mississippi Sports Hall of Fame. * In 1992, he was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Jim David, Barney's position coach with the Lions, gave the induction speech for Barney. * In 1997, the Detroit Free Press selected Barney as the best cornerback in NFL history. * In 1999, he was ranked 97th on The Sporting News' list of the 100 Greatest Football Players. * In 2004, the Lions retired jersey #20 in tribute to three Lions greats who wore the number: Barney, Billy Sims and Barry Sanders. Entertainer Barney is an accomplished singer who began singing with choirs in his youth and college. He befriended Motown recording artist Marvin Gaye, when Gaye unsuccessfully tried out for the Lions in 1970. Barney and teammate Mel Farr sang background vocals on Gaye's classic 1971 song \\"What's Going On\\". In 2015, Barney was invited to sing the national anthem at the Pro Football Hall of Fame induction ceremony. Barney also had a brief acting career, beginning with a self-portrayal in the 1968 comedy, Paper Lion. In 1973, he was one of the stars of the blaxploitation biker film, The Black Six. Family and later years Barney and his wife, Martha, had a daughter, LaTrece, and a son, Lem III. After retiring from the NFL, Barney worked for many years, starting in 1979, in public affairs for Michigan Consolidated Gas Company. He also worked in the 1980s as a football broadcaster on BET and on pre-season games for the Detroit Lions. In March 1993, after his car crashed into a guardrail on a Detroit freeway, Barney was arrested and charged with driving under the influence and possession of cocaine and marijuana. He was found not guilty of the drug charges following a jury trial in 1994. In 2006, Barney published an autobiography titled, \\"The Supernatural: Lem Barney\\". He held a public relations post at the Detroit Medical Center starting in 2006. After being fired from that position, he filed an age discrimination lawsuit in 2013. Also in 2013, Barney publicly declared that, in light of revelations about brain injuries resulting from football, he would not play football if he had the chance to live his life over again and predicted that the game of football would be gone in another 20 years.

It is divided into three parts: his life as a junior diplomat in Moscow and his travels in the Soviet Union, especially the forbidden zones of Central Asia; his exploits in the British Army and SAS in the North Africa theatre of war; and his time with Josip Broz Tito and the Partisans in Yugoslavia. Maclean was considered to be one of the inspirations for James Bond,Obituary, The New York Times. and this book contains many of the elements: remote travel, the sybaritic delights of diplomatic life, violence and adventure. The American edition was titled Escape To Adventure, and was published a year later. All place names in this article use the spelling in the book. Golden Road: the Soviet Union Fresh out of Cambridge, Maclean joined the Foreign Office and spent a couple of years at the Paris embassy. He loved the pleasures of life in the French capital, but eventually longed for adventure. Against the advice of his friends (and to the delight of his London bosses), he requested a posting to Moscow, which he received right away; once there, he began to learn Russian. Travelling within the Soviet Union was frowned upon by the authorities, but Maclean managed to take several trips anyway. The Caucasus In the spring of 1937, he took a trial trip, heading south from Moscow to Baku on the Caspian Sea. The Intourist official tried to dissuade him, but he found a ship to take him to Lenkoran (Lankaran, Azerbaijan), where he witnessed the deportation of several hundred Turko-Tartar peasants to Central Asia. Stuck there for a few days, he bargained for horses with which to explore the countryside, and was arrested by the NKVD cavalry near to the Persian border. He explained that he held diplomatic immunity, but his captors could not read his Soviet diplomatic pass. Eventually, as the only person literate in Russian, Maclean \\"read out, with considerable expression, and such improvements as occurred to me\\" the contents of his pass, and was set free. He took an 1856 paddle steamer back to Baku, and then a train on to Tiflis (Tbilisi, Georgia). British troops had supported the Democratic Republic after World War I, and Maclean sought out the British war cemetery, in the process discovering an English governess who had lived in the town since 1912. He caught a truck through the Caucasus mountains, via Mtzkhet (Mtskheta), the former capital of Georgia but by then merely a village, to Vladikavkaz (capital of North Ossetia), and then a train to Moscow. To Samarkand His second trip, in the autumn of the same year, took him east along the Trans- Siberian Railway. Although he disembarked without warning at Novosibirsk, he acquired an NKVD escort. He travelled on the Turksib Railway south to Biisk (Biysk), at the foot of the Altai Mountains, and then to Altaisk and Barnaul. On the trains he heard the complaints of the Siberian kolkhozniks (workers on collective farms) and witnessed another mass movement, this time of Koreans to Central Asia. His first main destination was Alma Ata (Almaty), the capital of the Kazakh republic, which lies near to the Tien Shan Mountains. He characterised it as \\"one of the pleasantest provincial towns in the Soviet Union\\" and particularly appreciated the apples for which it is famous. From there he took a truck to a hill village called Talgar and went walking with one of his NKVD escorts; Maclean availed himself of peasant hospitality and commented on the general prosperity. He managed to hire a car and made it to Issyk-kul, the lake that never freezes, but had to turn back because of the season. From Alma Ata Maclean took the train for Tashkent, passing through villages where \\"nothing seemed to have changed since the time when the country was ruled over by the Emir of Bokhara\\"; men still rode bulls and women still wore veils made of black horsehair. From Tashkent, which then had a reputation for wickedness, he made the final leg to the fabled city of Samarkand. He returned to Moscow with plans for a further trip. Samarkand, by Richard-Karl Karlovitch Zommer Maclean spent the winter working in Moscow and amusing himself at the dacha (country cottage) of American friends, including Chip Bohlen. In March 1938 a show trial was announced, the first such public event in over a year; he attended every day of what became known as the Trial of the Twenty-One. The book goes into great detail, spending 40 pages on description and analysis of the trial, its prominent figures and its twists and turns. To Chinese Turkestan When the weather became more conducive to travel, Maclean began his third and longest trip, aiming for Chinese Turkestan, immediately east of the Soviet Central Asian republics he had reached in 1937. This journey, unlike the previous two, was at the request of the British government. They wished him to investigate the conditions in Urumchi (√úr√ºmqi), the capital of the province of Sinkiang (Xinjiang), which had fallen under Soviet influence. He was commissioned to talk to the tupan (provincial governor) there about the situation of both the consul-general and the British Indian traders. The first stage was retracing his steps on a five-day train journey to Alma Ata; the train ran via Orenburg and the Aral Sea, then parallel to the Syr Darya and the mountains of Kirghizia (Kyrgyzstan). From Alma Aty he travelled four hundred miles north through the Hungry Steppe to Ayaguz (Ayagoz), where \\"a road which had been made, and was being kept up, for a very definite purpose\\" led to the frontier town of Bakhti (Bakhty or Bakhtu, about 17 km from Tacheng, known in Maclean's time as Chuguchak). The Soviet officials were, at first, willing to assist him but the Chinese ones were not, and in the course of the negotiations that surrounded his passage, Maclean discovered that the Soviets exercised some influence over at least the consul if not the provincial government of their neighbours. He crossed the border into China, where he was refused permission to continue; he was forced to return to Alma Aty, whence he was expelled. Soon he found himself back in Moscow. To Bokhara and Kabul His fourth and final Soviet trip was once more to Central Asia, spurred by the desire to reach Bokhara (Bukhara, Uzbekistan), the capital of the emirate which had been closed to Europeans until recent times. Maclean recounts how Charles Stoddart and Arthur Conolly were executed there in the context of The Great Game, and how Joseph Wolff, known as the Eccentric Missionary, barely escaped their fate when he came looking for them in 1845. In early October 1938 Maclean set out again, first for Ashkhabad (Ashgabat, capital of the Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic), then through the Kara Kum (Black Desert), not breaking his journey at either Tashkent or Samarkand, but pushing on to Kagan, the nearest point on the railway to Bokhara. After trying to smuggle himself aboard a lorry transporting cotton, he ended up walking to the city, and spent several days sight-seeing \\"in the steps of the Eccentric Missionary\\" and sleeping in parks, much to the frustration of the NKVD spies who were shadowing him. He judged it an \\"enchanted city\\", with buildings that rivalled \\"the finest architecture of the Italian Renaissance\\". Aware of his limited time, he cut short his wanderings and took the train towards Stalinabad (Dushanbe, the capital of Tajikistan), disembarking at Termez. This town sits on the Amu Darya (the Oxus), and the other side of the river lies in Afghanistan. Maclean claimed that \\"very few Europeans except Soviet frontier guards have ever seen it at this or any other point of its course\\". After more negotiations, he managed to cross the river and thus leave the USSR, and from that point his only guide seems to have been the narrative of \\"the Russian Burnaby\\", a colonel Nikolai Ivanovich Grodekov, who rode from Samarkand to Mazar-i-Sharif and Herat in 1878. The following day he and a guide set out on horseback, riding through jungle and desert, and detained on the way by dubious characters who may or may not have been brigands. (Maclean, a proficient linguist, was hamstrung on entering Afghanistan by the lack of any lingua franca.) They rode past the ruins of Balkh, a civilization founded by Alexander the Great and destroyed by Genghis Khan. After a night in Mazar, Maclean managed to get a car and driver, and progressed as rapidly as he could to Doaba, a village half-way to Kabul, where he had arranged to meet the British minister (i.e., ambassador), Colonel Frazer-Tytler. Together, they returned to the capital via Bamyan and its famous statues. Maclean circled back to Moscow via Peshawar, Delhi, Baghdad, Persia, and Armenia. Orient Sand: the Western Desert Campaign The middle section of the book details Maclean's first set of experiences in World War II. He was invited to join the newly formed Special Air Service (SAS), where, as part of the Western Desert Campaign, he planned and executed raids on Axis- held Benghazi, on the coast of Libya (Operation Bigamy). When it became clear that the North African Campaign was drawing to a close towards the end of 1942 and it became too quiet for his taste, he travelled east to arrest General Fazlollah Zahedi, at the time the head of the Persian armed forces in the south. SAS patrol in North Africa during WW2. Joining up The first challenge Maclean faced was getting into military service at all. His Foreign Office job was a reserved occupation, so he was not allowed to enlist. The only way around this was to go into politics, and on this stated ground Maclean tendered his resignation in 1941 to Alexander Cadogan, an FO mandarin. Maclean immediately enlisted, taking a taxi from Sir Alexander's office to a nearby recruiting station, where he joined the Cameron Highlanders, his father's regiment, as a private. Later, his erstwhile employers discovered that his resignation had been merely a ruse or legal fiction along the lines of taking the Chiltern Hundreds. Maclean was thus forced to run for office and, despite his self-confessed inexperience, was chosen as a Conservative candidate, and eventually elected MP. Prime Minister Winston Churchill jocularly accused him of using \\"the Mother of Parliaments as a public convenience\\".\\"Back to Benghazi\\" in Eastern Approaches Benghazi and the desert retreat After basic training, Maclean was sent to Cairo, where David Stirling invited him to join the newly formed Special Air Service (SAS), which he did. They worked closely with the Long Range Desert Group (LRDG), a mechanised reconnaissance unit, to travel far behind enemy lines and attack targets such as aerodromes. Maclean's first operation with the SAS, once his training was completed, was to Benghazi, Libya's second largest city, in late May 1942. He was joined on this operation by Randolph Churchill, son of the prime minister. They drove from Alexandria via the seaport of Mersa Matruh and the inland Siwa Oasis. They crossed the ancient caravan route known as the Trigh-el-Abd, which the enemy had laced with little bombs, and camped in the Gebel Akhdar, the Green Mountain just inland from the coastal plain. Once inside the occupied city, their patrol came face to face with Italian soldiers several times; Maclean, with his excellent Italian, managed to bluff his way out of all of these encounters by pretending to be a staff officer. They spent two nights and a day in the city. They had hoped to sabotage ships, but both the rubber boats they had brought with them failed to inflate, so they treated the visit as a reconnaissance mission. The drive back was uneventful, but nearing Cairo, Maclean, along with most of his party, was seriously injured in a crash and spent months out of action. Once he had recovered, Stirling involved him in preparations for a larger SAS attack on Benghazi. They attended a dinner with Churchill, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff General Alan Brooke, and General Harold Alexander, who was about to assume control of Middle East Command, the post responsible for the overall conduct of the campaign in the North African desert. Four operations were designed to create a diversion from Rommel's attempt on El Alamein: attacks on Benghazi (Operation Bigamy), Tobruk, Barce, and the Jalo oasis. These all started out from Kufra, an oasis 800 miles inland. Maclean's convoy drove to the Gebel across the Sand Sea at its narrowest point, Zighen, and made it there undetected, although \\"bazaar gossip\\" from an Arab spy indicated that the enemy expected an imminent attack. When Maclean's group reached the outskirts of Benghazi, they were ambushed and had to retreat. Axis planes repeatedly bombed them, destroying many of the vehicles and most of their supplies. Thus began a painful limp of days and nights over the desert towards Jalo, without even knowing whether that oasis was in Allied hands. They existed on rations of \\"a cup of water and a tablespoon of bully beef a day.... We found ourselves looking forward to the evening meal with painful fixity\\". When they got to that oasis, they found a battle going on between the Italian defenders and the Sudan Defence Force, and despite their offers to help, they received orders from GHQ to abandon the assault. Some days later they made it back to Kufra. The arrest of the Persian general Fazlollah Zahedi In September 1942 Maclean was ordered to Baghdad, where General Wilson, the new head of Persia and Iraq Command, wanted his advice about starting something like the SAS in Persia, should that country fall to the Germans. He proceeded there to recruit volunteers, passing through many of the places he had seen in peacetime four years earlier: Kermanshah, Hamadan, Kazvin, Teheran. He was soon diverted to a more urgent task. General Joseph Baillon, the Chief of Staff, and Reader Bullard, the minister (i.e., ambassador, as above), summoned him to Teheran. They were concerned about the influence of Fazlollah Zahedi, the general in charge of the Persian forces in the Isfahan area, who, their intelligence told them, was stockpiling grain, liaising with German agents, and preparing an uprising. Baillon and Bullard asked Maclean to remove Zahidi alive and without creating a fuss. He devised a Trojan horse plan: he and a senior officer would call on Zahidi to pay their respects, and then arrest him \\"at the point of a pistol\\" within his walled and guarded residence. He would be whisked out in the British staff car, driven a waiting plane, and flown into internment and exile. Maclean obtained and trained a platoon of Seaforth Highlanders to cover his retreat, and the plan went like clockwork. (Zahidi spent the rest of the war in British Palestine; five years later he was back in charge of the military of southern Persia, by 1953 he was prime minister.) By the end of the year, the war had developed in such a way that the new SAS detachment would not be needed in Persia. General Wilson was being transferred to Middle East Command, and Maclean extracted a promise that the newly trained troops would go with him, as their style of commando raids were ideal for southern and eastern Europe. Frustrated by the abandoning of plans for an assault on Crete, Maclean went to see Reginald Leeper, \\"an old friend from Foreign Office days, and now His Majesty's Ambassador to the Greek Government then in exile in Cairo\\". Leeper put in a word for him, and very soon Maclean was told to go to London to get his instructions directly from the prime minister. Churchill told him to parachute into Jugoslavia (now spelled Yugoslavia) as head of a military mission accredited to Josip Broz Tito (a shadowy figure at that point) or whoever was in charge of the Partisans, the Communist-led resistance movement. Mihajlovic's royalist Cetniks (now spelled Chetniks), which the Allies had been supporting, did not appear to be fighting the Germans very hard, and indeed were said to be collaborating with the enemy. Maclean famously paraphrased Churchill: \\"My task was simply to help find out who was killing the most Germans and suggest means by which we could help them to kill more.\\" The prime minister saw Maclean as \\"a daring Ambassador-leader to these hardy and hunted guerillas\\". Balkan War: With Tito in Yugoslavia \\"To arms, everyone!\\", a Partisan propaganda poster. The final and longest section of the book covers Maclean's time in and around Yugoslavia, from the late summer of 1943 to the formation of the united government in March 1945. The Yugoslav front, also known as the Yugoslav People's Liberation War, had become important to the Allies by 1943, although the Partisans had been fighting for two years without any help. He lived closely with Tito and his troops and had the ear of Churchill, and as such his recommendations shaped the Allies' policy towards Yugoslavia. The list of characters In the late summer of 1943, Maclean parachuted into Bosnia with Vivian Street and Slim Farish (whom he called his British and American Chiefs of Staff, respectively) and Sergeant Duncan, his bodyguard. They were attached to Tito's headquarters, then in the ruined castle of Jajce. Here and elsewhere, Maclean lived in proximity to the Partisan leader for a year and a half, on and off. Maclean gives much of this section of the book to his personal assessment of the Partisan position and of Tito as a man and as a leader. Their talks, in German and Russian (while Maclean learned Serbo-Croat), were wide-ranging, and from them Maclean gained hope that a future Communist Yugoslavia might not be the fear-wracked place the USSR was. The Partisans were extremely proud of their movement, dedicated to it, and prepared to live a life of austerity in its cause. All of this won his admiration. Some of the characters close to Tito whom Maclean met in his first months in Bosnia were Vlatko Velebit, an urbane young man about town, who later went with Maclean to Allied HQ as a liaison officer; Father Vlado (Vlada Zeƒçeviƒá), a Serbian Orthodox priest, \\"raconteur and trencherman\\"; Arso Jovanoviƒá, the Chief of Staff; Edo Kardelj, the Marxist theoretician who ended up vice-premier; Aleksandar Rankoviƒá, a professional revolutionary and Party organiser; Milovan ƒêilas (Dzilas), who became vice-president; Mo≈°a Pijade, one of the highest-ranking Jews; and a young woman named Olga whose father Momƒçilo Ninƒçiƒá had been a minister in the Royalist government and who spoke English like a debutante. Other Yugoslavs of note whom he met later included Koƒça Popoviƒá, later Chief of the General Staff of Yugoslav People's Army, whom Maclean judged \\"one of the outstanding figures of the Partisan Movement\\"; Ivo Lola Ribar, son of Dr Ivan Ribar, who seemed destined for great things; Miloje Milojeviƒá; Slavko Rodiƒá; Sreten ≈Ωujoviƒá (Crni the Black). Officers and soldiers under Maclean's command included Peter Moore of the Royal Engineers; Mike Parker, Deputy Assistant Quartermaster general; Gordon Alston; John Henniker-Major, a career diplomat; Donald Knight, and Robin Whetherly. Maclean arranged for an Allied officer, under his command, to be attached to each of the main Partisan bases, bringing with him a radio transmitting set. Maclean was not in fact the first Allied officer in Yugoslavia, but the few who had been dropped before him had not been able to get much of their information out. Maclean made contact with Bill Deakin, an Oxford history don who had served as a research assistant to Churchill; Anthony Hunter, a Scots Fusilier, and Major William Jones, an enthusiastic but unorthodox one-eyed Canadian. First journey across Bosnia and Dalmatia Maclean saw his task as arranging supplies and air support for the Partisan fight, to tie up the Axis forces for as long as possible. The Royal Air Force was reluctant to risk landing on what they saw as an amateur airstrip at Glamoj (Glamoƒç), although Slim Farish was in fact an airfield designer, and night air drops were sporadic. The Royal Navy was approached, and they offered to bring supplies to an outlying island off the Dalmatian coast. Maclean and a couple of companions set off on foot for Korƒçula, being passed from guerilla group to guerilla group. They passed through battle-scarred villages and towns that had changed hands many times, some so recently that corpses still lay on the ground: Bugojno and Livno and Ar≈æano. Once, they were billeted with a landlady whose sympathies clearly did not lie with the Partisans; she would not sell them food, but there was no question of simply commandeering it. Eventually, after an all-night march across noisy stony ground, dodging German patrols as they crossed a major road, the little group reached Zadvarje, where they were greeted with astonishment as creatures from another world \\"as indeed in a sense we were\\". After a few hours' sleep, they continued over the final range of hills to the coast, and down to Ba≈°ka Voda, where a fishing boat took them circuitously to Korƒçula. There, all seemed in order for a Navy supply drop, but the wireless set developed problems. Maclean was on the point of returning to Jajce when the motor launch arrived, with a crew that included Sandy Glen (also, like Maclean, thought to be one of the inspirations for James Bond) and David Satow. By this point the enemy were closing in to take the remaining access points to the coast, which would throttle the Partisan supply route before it had even begun. He sent top priority requests, asking for air and sea support from Allied bases in Italy, and these took effect. Maclean decided he needed to discuss matters with Tito and then with Allied superiors in Cairo to argue for more resources to push the project forward, and accordingly made his way back to Partisan HQ in Jajce. He returned to the islands, first on Hvar and then on Vis, to wait for the response to his strongly worded signals. On Vis he discovered an overgrown British war cemetery dating from a naval victory over the French in 1811. Gaining support In Cairo Maclean dined with Alexander Cadogan, his FO superior, and the next day reported to Anthony Eden, the Foreign Secretary. He stated his conclusions straightforwardly: that the Partisans were important militarily and politically and would influence the future of Yugoslavia whether the Allies helped them or not; their impact on the Germans could be greatly increased by Allied support; they were Communist and oriented towards the USSR. He says that his report created \\"something of a stir\\". He was sent back to collect two Yugoslav liaison officers who had not been allowed to come out with him on the first Navy pick- up. From Bari on the Italian Adriatic coast, now a centre of operations for the Tactical Air Force, he saw that this would prove difficult, as the German offensive had captured the whole Dalmatian coast. Fortunately, he had asked Air Marshal Sholto Douglas to assign him a liaison officer, and Wing Commander John B. Selby proved a godsend. Together they obtained the use of a Baltimore bomber and an escort of Lightnings. Twice they set out from Italy on a sunny day and twice the clouds blocked them from the Bosnian hills. On the third day the fighters were unavailable so the bomber set out alone, but again the weather made it impossible to land. On their return to Italy, they received a signal that the Partisans had captured a small German plane that they proposed to use. As they were loading up the plane, an enemy aircraft, alerted by a traitor, bombed the landing strip at Glamoc, killing Whetherly, Knight, and Ribar, and wounding Milojevic. This event, at the end of November, proved a spur to getting the mission higher priority, and soon Maclean got a large Dakota and half a squadron of Lightnings to complete the landing operation. Milojevic and Velebit accompanied Maclean to Alexandria, where the Yugoslavs decompressed for a few days, while Maclean sought out the prime minister. Churchill received him in trademark fashion: in bed, wearing an embroidered dressing gown, smoking a cigar. He, Joseph Stalin, and Franklin D. Roosevelt had discussed the matter of Yugoslavia at a recent conference in Teheran, and had decided to give all possible support to the Partisans. This was the turning point. The Chetniks were given a task (a bridge to blow up) and a deadline, to show whether they could still be effective allies; they failed this test and supplies were re-directed from them to the Partisans. The British government was left with the tricky political and moral problem of King Peter and his royalist government in exile. But the main issues were air supplies and air support, and to help co-ordinate this, Maclean's mission was expanded. Some of the new officers included Andrew Maxwell of the Scots Guards, John Clarke of the 2nd Scots Guards, Geoffrey Kup, a gunnery expert, Hilary King, a signals officer, Johnny Tregida, and, for a time, Randolph Churchill. Some of these were SAS or otherwise known from the Western Desert Campaign the previous year. Marshal of Yugoslavia Maclean returned to the islands and settled on Vis as being the best site for an airstrip and a naval base. He then needed to garrison it. He discussed the matter with General Alexander and his Chief of Staff General John Harding, who seemed to think it might be possible, and who gave him a lift to Marrakech to put the matter to the prime minister. Churchill assured him on the point of troops, and wrote a personal letter to Tito which he commissioned Maclean to deliver. Maclean parachuted into Bosnia again, thinking it no longer an unknown, as it had been only six months before. Tito, since the end of November Marshal of Yugoslavia, was delighted with the recognition from Churchill, as from one statesman to another. The Partisan headquarters moved to the village of Drvar, where Tito took up residence in a cave with a waterfall. Maclean spent months there with him, \\"talking, eating, and above all, arguing\\". He and Tito agreed a system of allocating the air drop supplies around the country, although there was some friction from officers wanting a bigger share. Air drops became much more frequent, as did air support for Partisan operations. At this point all support for the Cetniks was withdrawn, a fact Churchill announced in the House of Commons. Maclean decided to go to Serbia to see for himself what this stronghold of Cetniks held for the Partisans. In early April, before this could be arranged, he was ordered to London for further discussions. (A stop- over in Algiers meant a specially arranged radio phone call with Churchill. Maclean, who hated telephone conversations, managed to wring amusement from the mix-ups of codes and scrambling. Churchill's son was referred to as Pippin.) They arrived in England to find \\"the whole of the southern counties [were] one immense armed camp\\". Despite the tension over the anticipated invasion of Normandy, the press and officials were eager to hear the Yugoslav story, and Maclean and Velebit had a busy time; even U.S. General Dwight D. Eisenhower wanted to meet them. At Chequers Maclean participated in attempts to build a possible compromise between the Royalist government in exile and the Partisans. As Maclean was preparing to go back to Bari and Bosnia, he received news that the enemy had made a fierce attack on Partisan headquarters at Drvar, later known as the Knight's Move. \\"It was the kind of communication that took your breath away.\\" When he got the full story from Vivian Street, he heard how the German bombers had made a full and thorough attack, and, after Tito and the Partisans escaped, revenged themselves on the civilians, massacring almost everyone, men, women, and children. In the week that followed the attack on Drvar, Allied planes flew more than a thousand sorties in support of the Partisans. Tito, harassed and harried through the woods, reached the decision that he needed to leave and establish his headquarters in a place of security. Accordingly, he asked Vivian Street to arrange for the Allies to evacuate him and his staff, which they did. Maclean, on his way back from London, caught up with the Marshal at Bari, and found him proposing to establish his base on Vis. The Royal Navy took him across in fine style, with a memorable wardroom dinner, at which Tito recited, in English, \\"The Owl and the Pussycat\\". Negotiating the future of Yugoslavia Vis had been transformed in the intervening months, becoming a substantial base for aircraft, commandos, and navy boats \\"engaged in piratical activities against enemy shipping up and down the whole length of the Jugoslav coastline from Istria to Montenegro\\". Meanwhile, other fronts of the war were progressing rapidly, and the Germans were hard-pressed. It was necessary to discuss the future shape of Yugoslavia at the highest possible level, and so Maclean was instructed to invite Tito and his entourage to Caserta, the Allied Force Headquarters near Naples. Maclean accompanied him on this, his first public appearance outside his own country. While the negotiations wore on, Maclean was told that Churchill would be in Italy in a week and wanted to see the Yugoslav Marshal, but security meant the prime minister's movements could not be released. Maclean helped to spin out Tito's visit with side trips and excuses, taking him to Rome and Cassino, \\"to tea with Hermione Ranfurly at her ridiculous little house of the side of the hill overlooking the Bay of Naples\\" and to Capri to meet Mrs Harrison Williams. Sitting outside one afternoon, Tito saw a heavy plane and a dozen fighters coming in, and announced that that must be Mr Churchill. Maclean commented wryly, \\"He was not an easy man to keep anything from\\". The negotiations that followed were called the Naples Conference, with Tito, Velebit and Olga on one side of the table and Churchill and Maclean on the other. Churchill was happy to give this matter his personal attention, and, Maclean says, he did it very well. One day the two leaders were taking a rest, having handed things over to a committee of experts, when a matter arose required Churchill's immediate attention. Maclean was sent to find him; he was believed to be bathing in the Bay of Naples. When they got to the shore, they saw the huge flotilla of troopships setting off for the south of France (Operation Dragoon), and a small bright blue admiral's barge dodging around them. Maclean was assigned a little torpedo boat, complete with a cautious captain and an attractive stenographer. It zoomed after the barge, eventually catching up with the prime minister, who found Maclean and his crew's arrival a source of much hilarity. Immediately after the Naples Conference, Tito continued the diplomatic discussions on Vis, this time with Ivan ≈†uba≈°iƒá, prime minister of the Royal Yugoslav Government, and his colleagues. Ralph Stevenson, the British Ambassador to this government in exile, accompanied ≈†uba≈°iƒá to Vis, but he and Maclean stayed out of the negotiations and spent their days swimming and speculating. The two parties came to an agreement, the Treaty of Vis, which, Maclean said, \\"sounded (and was) too good to be true\\". To celebrate this, Tito took everyone out in a motor boat to a local beauty spot, an underwater cave illuminated with sunlight (Bi≈°evo). \\"We all stripped and bathed, our bodies glistening bluish and ghastly. Almost everyone there was a Cabinet Minister in one or other of the two Yugoslav Governments, and there was much shouting and laughter as one blue and phosphorescent Excellency cannoned into another, bobbing about in that cerulean twilight.\\" Planning for action But by this point Maclean had had enough of high politics and garrison life. He wanted to be back in the action, and it looked as if the Germans were planning to withdraw from Yugoslavia. Accordingly, he came up with a plan known as Operation Ratweek, in which the Partisans and Allies were to harass the Axis troops in close co- ordination for seven days, destroying their communication lines. Bill Elliot, in command of the Balkan Air Force, supported the plan, as did the Navy and General Wilson. Tito committed himself too, although, as Maclean points out, it would have been understandable had he wished to let the Germans leave as soon as possible. Maclean got permission from Churchill to go to Serbia, previously a stronghold of the Chetniks, to supervise Ratweek from there. He landed at Bojnik near Radan Mountain, a position surrounded by Bulgars, Albanians, White Russians, and Germans. Through the latter part of August he, and his team back in Bari and Caserta, and the Partisans in Serbia and elsewhere, finalised the details of Ratweek. Almost to cue, the White Russians blew up their ammunition dump and the enemy started to retreat. The following day, Maclean moved to near Leskovac, and the next day, Ratweek began, with fifty heavy bombers attacking the town at 11:30. \\"Already the Fortresses were over their target -- were past it -- when, as we watched, the whole of Leskovac seemed to rise bodily into the air in a tornado of dust and smoke and debris,and a great rending noise fell on our ears. When we looked at the sky again, the Forts, still relentlessly following their course, were mere silvery dots in the distance. [...] Even the Partisans seemed subdued.\\" That night, the land offensive began, and Maclean watched the Partisans attack the Belgrade-Salonika railway, blowing up bridges, burning sleepers, and rendering it unusable. When the Germans tried to repair it, the Balkan Air Force soon dissuaded them. They tried to evacuate Greece and Macedonia by air, but again the Allies thwarted them. Maclean, with three British companions and one Yugoslav guide, made his way on horseback north into Serbia. They travelled for several days through prosperous countryside, \\"so surprising after Bosnia and Dalmatia\\", where the peasants, who expressed great friendship for Britain and a certain caution about the Partisans, gave them lavish hospitality and food. One evening they camped outside a village, and soon saw \\"a procession of peasant women arriving with an array of bowls, baskets, jars and bottles. From these they produced eggs and sour milk and fresh bread and a couple of chickens and a roast suckling-pig and cream cheese and pastry and wine and peaches and grapes\\". The journey produced many such vignettes, some pleasant, others of confusion, discomfort, worry. Altogether Maclean found it \\"an agreeable existence\\", reflecting \\"with heightened distaste\\" on the life he lived on Vis in the shadow of political negotiations. He hoped he could remain in Serbia to be there when Belgrade was liberated, but received a message that Tito had disappeared‚Äîor as Churchill put it \\"levanted\\"‚Äîand he had to try to find him. A plane was sent to pick up Maclean. End stages Yugoslav Partisans in liberated Belgrade, October 1944. From Bari, he calculated that Tito would want to be directing the recapture of Belgrade, so he headed towards there himself, landing at Valjevo with a jeep. It was here that \\"Lili Marlene\\", the song broadcast from Radio Belgrade and which he had listened to night after night, from the desert to the mountain tops, finally ceased. \\"Not long now,\\" he thought. The Partisan troops travelled through Arandjelovac and soon met up with the Red Army, who were being hailed as liberators. Maclean noted that almost every one of them was a fighting soldier, and that their vehicles carried nothing but petrol and ammunition. For the rest, he presumed, they got from the enemy or the local people. \\"We were witnessing a return to the administrative methods of Attila and Genghis Khan, and the results seemed to deserve careful attention.\\" In the last ten miles outside the capital, they passed hundreds and hundreds of corpses from the recent battle, and a neat stack of a hundred or more who appeared to have been executed. When they reached the HQ of General Peko Dapƒçeviƒá, his chief of staff, who had only a vague notion of the geography of the city, took Maclean and Vivian Street out for a tour, through heavy shelling that he appeared oblivious to. From the terrace of the Kalemegdan, the ancient fort in the middle of the city, they witnessed the withdrawal of German troops over the Danube to the suburb of Zemun. Inexplicably, the Germans failed to blow up the bridge after the last of their troops were over it, allowing the Russians to follow only minutes behind. Maclean, some time afterwards, found out the answer to this puzzle, comparing it to a fairytale. An old schoolmaster, whose one experience of modern warfare was in the Balkan War of 1912, saw the charges being laid and knew how to disconnect them. He got a gold medal in 1912 and another for this initiative too. A few days later Tito arrived and Maclean had to convey Churchill's displeasure at his sudden and unexplained departure. Tito had been to Moscow at Stalin's invitation, to arrange matters with the Soviet High Command. Maclean helped to hammer out a draft agreement, and went to London with it, while Tito's envoys took it to Moscow. \\"It was a difficult and thankless task. King Peter, quite naturally, was not easy to reassure, and Tito, sitting in Belgrade with all the cards in his hand, was not easy to satisfy.\\" The bargaining went on for months, and meanwhile Maclean's staff wanted to get away, to assist guerrilla wars elsewhere. When the Big Three (Churchill, Roosevelt, and Stalin) met at Yalta in February 1945, and made it clear that Tito and ≈†uba≈°iƒá had to get on with it, King Peter gave in, and all the pieces fell into place. The regents were sworn in, as was the united government, and the British ambassador flew in. Maclean was finally able to leave. Quotations * When I got to Cairo, I took a taxi to the address at which I had been told to report. \\"Ah,\\" said the villanous-looking Egyptian who drove me, when he heard the address. \\"You want Secret Service.\\" * (On a reconnaissance trip to occupied Benghazi.) We walked down the middle of the street arm in arm, whistling and doing our best to give the impression that we had every right to be there. Nobody paid the slightest attention to us. On such occasions it's one's manner that counts. If only you can behave naturally, and avoid any appearance of furtiveness, it is worth any number of elaborate disguises and faked documents. * Clearly it was no easy task to transport several dozen vehicles and a couple of hundred men across 800 miles of waterless desert without attracting the attention of the enemy. * Another truck full of explosives went up, taking with it all my personal kit. That was another two trucks gone. My equipment was now reduced to an automatic pistol, a prismatic compass and one plated teaspoon. From now onwards I should be travelling light. * Our meal that night was on a more luxurious scale than anything that we had tasted for some time. In addition to the usual spoonful of bully beef, we used up some of the remaining water in making some hot porridge and brewed up some tea. We also scraped up enough rum for a small tot all round. This we drank after supper, lying on a little sandbank and watching the sun sinking behind the dunes. I cannot remember a meal that I enjoyed more or that seemed more wildly and agreeably extravagant. Extravagant it certainly was, for, when we had finished eating, there was no food left at all, and only enough water to half fill one water-bottle for each man. * I was to have dinner that night with [Sir Alexander] Cadogan. As I lay in my bath, I reflected that the last time I had seen him had been in his room at the Foreign Office when I had handed him my letter of resignation from the Diplomatic Service. It seemed a long time ago. Looking back on the few but crowded years between, it occurred to me forcibly how fortunate I had been in my decision and how lucky not to miss the experiences which had fallen to my lot in the intervening space of time. To me, it was not disagreeable to look forward to a future of uncertainty and insecurity, with none of the slow inevitability of a career in the Government service; to feel myself, in however small a way, the master of my destiny. With my left foot I turned the hot-water tap full on and wallowed contentedly. * The day after, I asked my pilot, a cheerful young New Zealander, if he thought we really needed an escort. He said that, unless we had bad luck, he could probably get away from anything except a very up-to-date fighter. I asked him if he would get into trouble if we went without an escort. He replied cheerfully that, if we came back safely, no one would say anything, and if we didn't, it wouldn't matter anyway. This seemed sound enough logic, and so we sent off a signal to Robin, announcing our arrival, and set off on our own. * I was right: we had been dropped from very low indeed; no sooner had my parachute opened, than I hit the ground with more force than was comfortable.

The population of the civil parish (including Littlethorpe) at the 2011 census was 8,498. The name is derived from the Old English north burh, meaning \\"north fort or stronghold\\". At the 2001 Census, the parish had a population of 8,402. Surrounding villages include Enderby, Whetstone, Littlethorpe, Cosby, and Huncote. Location Narborough is situated on or near several major transport corridors. The M1 motorway passes through the east of Narborough, and the Leicester to Birmingham railway line runs beside the River Soar on its way through the village. Coventry Road in the village centre runs along the course of the Fosse Way (Roman road), which then joins back onto the present course of the B4114 link from Birmingham to Leicester. Narborough is often split into two distinct parts, the (old) village core to the South and the newer Pastures estate to the north east. These areas are separated by the B4114 which runs through the middle of the two areas. Transport=Bus Narborough is served by Arriva Midlands services 50 and X84 both linking the village with Rugby, Enderby, Croft, Fosse Shopping Park, and Leicester city centre. Rail Narborough railway station Narborough railway station is situated in the village centre and offers an hourly service with South Wigston and Leicester to the north, and Hinckley, Nuneaton, Coventry and Birmingham in the south and west. Amenities View from All Saints Tower with Littlethorpe in the distance The village contains many amenities including two doctors' surgeries, a dentist, several hairdressers, a beauty salon, a post office, two estate agents and two chemists. There are also four newsagents, a bakery, a Chinese takeaway, a pizza takeaway and a fish and chip shop. Narborough also boasts two small supermarkets, a Tesco Express and a Central England Co- operative, and two pubs: The Copt Oak and outside the village centre and Narborough Arms within it. Two other pubs have since been converted into Indian Restaurants: \\"The Bell\\" is now Spice 45 Indian restaurant and the \\"Dovecote\\" was converted to the \\"Monsoon Indian Restaurant\\" (after a long closure the building has been taken over and is now called \\"The Dovecote\\"). A third property has been converted into an Indian restaurant/hotel: the Heritage Hotel and Restaurant can be found on Leicester Road. To the north- east of the village lies Carlton Park, a business park that included the headquarters of Alliance & Leicester, who employed over 1,800 people locally. Carlton Park also has a Racquets and Health Club, David Lloyd (formerly Next Generation), which opened in the summer of 2006 . Near to the village centre are the Blaby District Council offices. As well as Greystoke Primary School in the village, The Pastures Primary and Red Hill field Primary School are the two other primary schools serving the village. Pupils from these schools will generally go on to Brockington College in Enderby.  Politics and government  Narborough is part of the South Leicestershire constituency and is currently represented in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom by Conservative, Alberto Costa.  Religion  Narborough also has a Congregational Church situated on School Lane and a Catholic church, St. Pius X, on Leicester Road. Narborough has been home to The Buddhist House, HQ for the Amida Trust, a Pureland Buddhist school, since 2001.

According to the , it has a population of people.  History  The Parish/Township of San Julian owes its origin to the Pre-Spanish settlement of Libas. When the Jesuits started evangelizing the inhabitants on the eastern littoral of Samar Island in early 17th century. Libas was already a small settlement, although the term village could not be applied to it. The houses were far removed from each other and the place was without street. It was simply a group of houses dotted near the mouth of Libas river. The inhabitants, whom from time to time the Jesuits from Sulat gathered at a makeshift chapel for worship and the doctrina were engaged in farming and fishing. The establishment of LIbas in 1781 as a village was largely the work of a Franciscan parish priest of Sulat, Fr. Melchor Claver. Through his effort, a church was constructed and houses were gathered around it. He directed the construction of a casa tribunal, a cemetery, and a rectory (convento). On July 4, 1863, Libas was separated from Sulat politically and ecclesiastically, and as it already had enough population and revenues to support a priest, was erected into a diocesan parish on August 25, 1871. The new parish included the vistas (barrios) of nonoc, the patron of which was St. Pascual Baylon, Simangan, dedicated to St. John the Baptist, and Pagbabangnan, placed under the protection of St. Francis of Assisi. The first parish priest was a diocesan, Fr. Pedro Baul, who was assigned in Guiuan from 1865 to 1866. Tradition has it that he was a pastor of LIbas from 1871 to 1874. The seat of the parish was, of course, Libas, with a wooden church dedicated to Our Lady of Sorrows. In 1865, the whole parish and town had a population of 2,940, and a total of 835 tributes. It also had an escuela de premer esdenanza (roughly a primary school) located at the parish seat. Its big church bell was acquired in 1885. When commerce in Samar Island improved in the late 19th century, the priest and the people recognized that the location of the town placed it in an economic disadvantage. In 1886, during the incumbency of Don Granizo Calim as gobernadorcillo, when the town had a total 3,645 population, and the people were already part of the inter- town commerce, Fr. Julian Diaz, the parish priest, proposed that the poblacion be transferred to the visita of Nonoc largely for economic reason. Having been seconded by the majority of the principales (town's leading men), the proposition for the transfer of poblacion, after much deliberation, was locally approved on April 7, 1886. With the stamp of approval by the governador general in Manila, with the assistance of the Gobernador Politico- Militar Don Pelayo Echacon y Lopez, the transfer became effective on August 14, 1887. Nonoc, the new poblacion was renamed San Julian, after the friar, Fr. Julian Diaz, the last resident priest of Libas and the first resident priest of Nonoc. Its first gobernardocillo was Don Francisco Villarazo. Since Nonoc had not a single street, one of the first projects of the parishioners was the opening of streets and in compliance with the usual requirements of poblacion, Fr. Diaz led in the construction of the parish church of stone (traditionally dated 1890, a church plaza, a casa tribunal (roughly a municipal building), a convento, a cemetery (1888), and a primary school (escuela de primer ensenanza) Meanwhile, LIbas was reverted to the status os visita, populated by those Libasnons who chose to remain in the settlement. Before the end of the Spanish regime, one more visita was added to the pueblo (township) San Julian, namely, Nena, which was already known for its agricultural products. Originally known as Bulaun, its Militar, Don Ricardo Nouvilas, who named it after his daughter Nena. (Simangan became part of Sulat) At the same time, another barrio (probably Lunang) was made, and renamed San Antonio, after the name of a well-loved pastor of San Julian, but its existence was short-lived, not only because the area was sparsely populated, but also because many inhabitants transferred to the poblacion. In 1909, San Isidro was separated from Pagbabangnan, and became an independent visita. The town is the most progressive in the entire Eastern Visayas region in terms of human rights upholding. It is the first and only municipality in the region to possess an ordinance which bans discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.

The pHi plays a critical role in membrane transport and other intracellular processes. In an environment with the improper pHi, biological cells may have compromised function. Therefore, pHi is closely regulated in order to ensure proper cellular function, controlled cell growth, and normal cellular processes. The mechanisms that regulate pHi are usually considered to be plasma membrane transporters of which two main types exist ‚Äî those that are dependent and those that are independent of the concentration of bicarbonate (). Physiologically normal intracellular pH is most commonly between 7.0 and 7.4, though there is variability between tissues (e.g., mammalian skeletal muscle tends to have a pHi of 6.8‚Äì7.1).. There is also pH variation across different organelles, which can span from around 4.5 to 8.0. pHi can be measured in a number of different ways.  Homeostasis  Intracellular pH is typically lower than extracellular pH due to lower concentrations of HCO3‚àí. A rise of extracellular (e.g., serum) partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) above 45 mmHg leads to formation of carbonic acid, which causes a decrease of pHi as it dissociates:Flinck M, Kramer SH, Pedersen SF (July 2018). \\"Roles of pH in control of cell proliferation\\". Acta Physiol (Oxf). 223 (3): e13068. doi:10.1111/apha.13068. PMID 29575508. : H2O + CO2 H2CO3 H+ \\\\+ HCO3‚Äì Since biological cells contain fluid that can act as a buffer, pHi can be maintained fairly well within a certain range. Cells adjust their pHi accordingly upon an increase in acidity or basicity, usually with the help of CO2 or HCO3‚Äì sensors present in the membrane of the cell. These sensors can permit H+ to pass through the cell membrane accordingly, allowing for pHi to be interrelated with extracellular pH in this respect. Major intracellular buffer systems include those involving proteins or phosphates. Since the proteins have acidic and basic regions, they can serve as both proton donors or acceptors in order to maintain a relatively stable intracellular pH. In the case of a phosphate buffer, substantial quantities of weak acid and conjugate weak base (H2PO4‚Äì and HPO42‚Äì) can accept or donate protons accordingly in order to conserve intracellular pH: :OH‚Äì \\\\+ H2PO4‚Äì H2O + HPO42‚Äì :H+ \\\\+ HPO42‚Äì H2PO4‚Äì  In organelles  Approximate pHs of various organelles within a cell. The pH within a particular organelle is tailored for its specific function. For example, lysosomes have a relatively low pH of 4.5. Additionally, fluorescence microscopy techniques have indicated that phagocytes also have a relatively low internal pH. Since these are both degradative organelles that engulf and break down other substances, they require high internal acidity in order to successfully perform their intended function. In contrast to the relatively low pH inside lysosomes and phagocytes, the mitochondrial matrix has an internal pH of around 8.0, which is approximately 0.9 pH units higher than that of inside intermembrane space. Since oxidative phosphorylation must occur inside the mitochondria, this pH discrepancy is necessary to create a gradient across the membrane. This membrane potential is ultimately what allows for the mitochondria to generate large quantities of ATP. Protons being pumped from the mitochondrial matrix into the intermembrane space as the electron transport chain runs, lowering the pH of the intermembrane space.  Measurement  There are several common ways in which intracellular pH (pHi) can be measured including with a microelectrode, dye that is sensitive to pH, or with nuclear magnetic resonance techniques. For measuring pH inside of organelles, a technique utilizing pH-sensitive green fluorescent proteins (GFPs) may be used. Overall, all three methods have their own advantages and disadvantages. Using dyes is perhaps the easiest and fairly precise, while NMR presents the challenge of being relatively less precise. Furthermore, using a microelectrode may be challenging in situations where the cells are too small, or the intactness of the cell membrane should remain undisturbed. GFPs are unique in that they provide a noninvasive way of determining pH inside different organelles, yet this method is not the most quantitively precise way of determining pH.  Microelectrode  The microelectrode method for measuring pHi consists of placing a very small electrode into the cell‚Äôs cytosol by making a very small hole in the plasma membrane of the cell. Since the microelectrode has fluid with a high H+ concentration inside, relative to the outside of the electrode, there is a potential created due to the pH discrepancy between the inside and outside of the electrode. From this voltage difference, and a predetermined pH for the fluid inside the electrode, one can determine the intracellular pH (pHi) of the cell of interest.  Fluorescence spectroscopy  Another way to measure Intracellular pH (pHi) is with dyes that are sensitive to pH, and fluoresce differently at various pH values. This technique, which makes use of fluorescence spectroscopy, consists of adding this special dye to the cytosol of a cell. By exciting the dye in the cell with energy from light, and measuring the wavelength of light released by the photon as it returns to its native energy state, one can determine the type of dye present, and relate that to the intracellular pH of the given cell.  Nuclear magnetic resonance  In addition to using pH-sensitive electrodes and dyes to measure pHi, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy can also be used to quantify pHi. NMR, typically speaking, reveals information about the inside of a cell by placing the cell in an environment with a potent magnetic field. Based on the ratio between the concentrations of protonated, compared to deprotonated, forms of phosphate compounds in a given cell, the internal pH of the cell can be determined. Additionally, NMR may also be used to reveal the presence of intracellular sodium, which can also provide information about the pHi. Using NMR Spectroscopy, it has been determined that lymphocytes maintain a constant internal pH of 7.17¬± 0.06, though, like all cells, the intracellular pH changes in the same direction as extracellular pH.  pH-sensitive GFPs  To determine the pH inside organelles, pH-sensitive GFPs are often used as part of a noninvasive and effective technique. By using cDNA as a template along with the appropriate primers, the GFP gene can be expressed in the cytosol, and the proteins produced can target specific regions within the cell, such as the mitochondria, golgi apparatus, cytoplasm, and endoplasmic reticulum. If certain GFP mutants that are highly sensitive to pH in intracellular environments are used in these experiments, the relative amount of resulting fluorescence can reveal the approximate surrounding pH.

The Elders' Journal of the Church of Latter Day Saints (the name changed to Elders' Journal of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints with the third issue) was an early Latter Day Saint periodical edited by Don Carlos Smith, younger brother of Joseph Smith. It was the successor to the Latter Day Saints' Messenger and Advocate and was eventually replaced by the Times and Seasons. History Two issues of the Elders' Journal were published in Kirtland, Ohio in 1837. The newspaper was then relocated to Far West, Missouri where two more issues were printed. The first two issues were published on the press that had previously been used to publish the Messenger and Advocate ‚Äî but this press fell into the hands of Warren Parrish's schismatic \\"Church of Christ\\" and a new press had to be obtained before printing could continue. Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon relocated to a new headquarters in Far West and continued to publish the Elders' Journal until the events of the 1838 Mormon War in Missouri prevented further operations in the state. The press of the Elders' Journal in Far West, was used by the LDS Church to publish Rigdon's July 4th oration, which was one of the factors that increased tensions between Latter Day Saints and non-Mormons in northwestern Missouri. Prospectus The revised prospectus for the periodical (reprinted in No. 3) reads: :\\"PROSPECTUS for the ELDERS' JOURNAL of the Church of Jesus Christ, of Latter Day Saints. :It is, we presume, generally known, that this paper was commenced in Kirtland, Ohio, in October last; but by reason of the great persecution against the Saints in that place, the paper had to be stopped; and through the craft of wicked men they go possession of the Printing Office, and knowing they could not hold it, it was burned. :The paper is now about to be resuscitated in this place; to be conducted as set forth in the former prospectus. It will be issued in a few weeks, and sent to the former subscribers, as previously stated. :We send this prospectus to arouse the Saints to energy in obtaining subscribers. ‚Äî We hope the Elders abroad, will not fail to use their influence to give as general a circulation as possible. :The JOURNAL will be Edited by Joseph Smith, jr., and Published by Thomas B. Marsh, at Far West, Caldwell County Missouri. :Terms‚ÄîOne dollar, per annum, paid in advance. All letters must be Post Paid, and directed to the Publisher. :Far West, Mo. April 26, 1838. Contents The Elders' Journal contains a number of letters from church leaders, minutes from church conferences as well as notices of marriages and obituaries. The July 1838 issue published a \\"Q & A\\" style interview with the editorial board (led by Joseph Smith, Jr.) about Smith's personal history and Mormon beliefs.No title Elders‚Äô Journal Volume 2, number 1, September 1, 1904 Chattanooga, Tennessee, page 1.

In 1903, under the direction of Ben E. Rich, the LDS Church's Southern States Mission began publishing a monthly periodical called Elders' Journal, which was named after the 1837‚Äì38 periodical of the same name. By September 1, 1904, the publication had moved from Atlanta, Georgia, to a newly purchased Southern States Mission office in Chattanooga, Tennessee, and, with a price increase from $0.25 to $0.50 annually, became a semi-monthly publication.\\"No Place Like Home\\" Elders‚Äô Journal Volume 2, number 1, September 1, 1904 Chattanooga, Tennessee, page 1. In June 1907, the Elders' Journal was merged with The Liahona, a weekly publication created in April 1907 for use in all missions of the LDS Church in the United States. The combined publication was named Liahona: The Elders‚Äô Journal and printed in Independence, Missouri. The new publication retained the format of the Elders' Journal rather than The Liahona and remained semi-monthly. Subscription lists from both publication were combined, roughly 20,000 copies of the first edition were printed, and the consolidated publication continued for the next 37 years. \\"Editorial: To Agents and All Subscribers\\", Liahona The Elders‚Äô Journal Volume 5, number 1, June 22, 1907.

In the final issue of Liahona: The Elders‚Äô Journal, published February 27, 1945, the editors recommended readers subscribe to one of two LDS Church periodicals; the weekly Church News, or the monthly magazine The Improvement Era. Wrapped with the final issue was a sample copy of the Church News as it was presumably less well known to subscribers than The Improvement Era. The Church News, a weekly insert in the Deseret News, had been available in limited circulation outside of Utah since 1943. The Improvement Era, had been available since 1897.\\"Announcement by The First Presidency of the discontinuation of the Liahona in the United States\\" , Liahona The Elders‚Äô Journal Volume 42, number 18, February 27, 1945.

This can be thought of as there being many different \\"selves\\" within decision makers, with each \\"self\\" representing the decision-maker at a different point in time; the inconsistency occurs when not all preferences are aligned. The term \\"dynamic inconsistency\\" is more closely affiliated with game theory, whereas \\"time inconsistency\\" is more closely affiliated with behavioral economics. In game theory In the context of game theory, dynamic inconsistency is a situation in a dynamic game where a player's best plan for some future period will not be optimal when that future period arrives. A dynamically inconsistent game is subgame imperfect. In this context, the inconsistency is primarily about commitment and credible threats. This manifests itself through a violation of Bellman's Principle of Optimality by the leader or dominant player, as shown in . For example, a firm might want to commit itself to dramatically dropping the price of a product it sells if a rival firm enters its market. If this threat were credible, it would discourage the rival from entering. However, the firm might not be able to commit its future self to taking such an action because if the rival does in fact end up entering, the firm's future self might determine that, given the fact that the rival is now actually in the market and there is no point in trying to discourage entry, it is now not in its interest to dramatically drop the price. As such, the threat would not be credible. The present self of the firm has preferences that would have the future self be committed to the threat, but the future self has preferences that have it not carry out the threat. Hence, the dynamic inconsistency. In behavioral economics In the context of behavioral economics, time inconsistency is related to how each different self of a decision-maker may have different preferences over current and future choices. Consider, for example, the following question: *(a) Which do you prefer, to be given 500 dollars today or 505 dollars tomorrow? *(b) Which do you prefer, to be given 500 dollars 365 days from now or 505 dollars 366 days from now? When this question is asked, to be time-consistent, one must make the same choice for (b) as for (a). According to George Loewenstein and Drazen Prelec, however, people are not always consistent. People tend to choose \\"500 dollars today\\" and \\"505 dollars 366 days later\\", which is different from the time-consistent answer. One common way in which selves may differ in their preferences is they may be modeled as all holding the view that \\"now\\" has especially high value compared to any future time. This is sometimes called the \\"immediacy effect\\" or \\"temporal discounting\\". As a result, the present self will care too much about himself and not enough about his future selves. The self control literature relies heavily on this type of time inconsistency, and it relates to a variety of topics including procrastination, addiction, efforts at weight loss, and saving for retirement. Time inconsistency basically means that there is disagreement between a decision-maker's different selves about what actions should be taken. Formally, consider an economic model with different mathematical weightings placed on the utilities of each self. Consider the possibility that for any given self, the weightings that self places on all the utilities could differ from the weightings that another given self places on all the utilities. The important consideration now is the relative weighting between two particular utilities. Will this relative weighting be the same for one given self as it is for a different given self? If it is, then we have a case of time consistency. If the relative weightings of all pairs of utilities are all the same for all given selves, then the decision- maker has time-consistent preferences. If there exists a case of one relative weighting of utilities where one self has a different relative weighting of those utilities than another self has, then we have a case of time inconsistency and the decision-maker will be said to have time-inconsistent preferences. It is common in economic models that involve decision-making over time to assume that decision-makers are exponential discounters. Exponential discounting posits that the decision maker assigns future utility of any good according to the formula :U(t) = U(0) e^{-\\\\rho t} where t=0 is the present, U(0) is the utility assigned to the good if it were consumed immediately, and \\\\rho is the \\"discount factor\\", which is the same for all goods and constant over time. Mathematically, it is the unique continuous function that satisfies the equation : U(t_1)/U(t_2) = U(t_1+c)/U(t_2+c); that is, the ratio of utility values for a good at two different moments of time only depends on the interval between these times, but not on their choice. (If you're willing to pay 10% over list price to buy a new phone today instead of paying list price and having it delivered in a week, you'd also be willing to pay extra 10% to get it one week sooner if you were ordering it six months in advance.) If \\\\rho is the same for all goods, then it is also the case that : U_A(t_1)/U_B(t_1) = U_A(t_2)/U_B(t_2); that is, if good A is assigned higher utility than good B at time t_1, that relationship also holds at all other times. (If you'd rather eat broccoli than cake tomorrow for lunch, you'll also pick broccoli over cake if you're hungry right now.) Exponential discounting yields time-consistent preferences. Exponential discounting and, more generally, time-consistent preferences are often assumed in rational choice theory, since they imply that all of a decision-maker's selves will agree with the choices made by each self. Any decision that the individual makes for himself in advance will remain valid (i.e., an optimal choice) as time advances, unless utilities themselves change. However, empirical research makes a strong case that time inconsistency is, in fact, standard in human preferences. This would imply disagreement by people's different selves on decisions made and a rejection of the time consistency aspect of rational choice theory. For example, consider having the choice between getting the day off work tomorrow or getting a day and a half off work one month from now. Suppose you would choose one day off tomorrow. Now suppose that you were asked to make that same choice ten years ago. That is, you were asked then whether you would prefer getting one day off in ten years or getting one and a half days off in ten years and one month. Suppose that then you would have taken the day and a half off. This would be a case of time inconsistency because your relative preferences for tomorrow versus one month from now would be different at two different points in time‚Äînamely now versus ten years ago. The decision made ten years ago indicates a preference for delayed gratification, but the decision made just before the fact indicates a preference for immediate pleasure. More generally, humans have a systematic tendency to switch towards \\"vices\\" (products or activities which are pleasant in the short term) from \\"virtues\\" (products or activities which are seen as valuable in the long term) as the moment of consumption approaches, even if this involves changing decisions made in advance. One way that time-inconsistent preferences have been formally introduced into economic models is by first giving the decision-maker standard exponentially discounted preferences, and then adding another term that heavily discounts any time that is not now. Preferences of this sort have been called \\"present-biased preferences\\". The hyperbolic discounting model is another commonly used model that allows one to obtain more realistic results with regard to human decision-making. A different form of dynamic inconsistency arises as a consequence of \\"projection bias\\" (not to be confused with a defense mechanism of the same name). Humans have a tendency to mispredict their future marginal utilities by assuming that they will remain at present levels. This leads to inconsistency as marginal utilities (for example, tastes) change over time in a way that the individual did not expect. For example, when individuals are asked to choose between a piece of fruit and an unhealthy snack (such as a candy bar) for a future meal, the choice is strongly affected by their \\"current\\" level of hunger. Individuals may become addicted to smoking or drugs because they underestimate future marginal utilities of these habits (such as craving for cigarettes) once they become addicted. Stylized examples *In a game theory context, an announced government policy of never negotiating with terrorists over the release of hostages constitutes a time inconsistency example, since in each particular hostage situation the authorities face the dilemma of breaking the rule and trying to save the hostages. Assuming the government acted consistently in not ever breaking the rule, it would make it irrational for a terrorist group to take hostages. (Of course, in the real world terrorists might not act rationally.) *Students, the night before an exam, often wish that the exam could be put off for one more day. If asked on that night, such students might agree to commit to paying, say, $10 on the day of the exam for it to be held the next day. Months before the exam is held, however, students generally do not care much about having the exam put off for one day. And, in fact, if the students were made the same offer at the beginning of the term, that is, they could have the exam put off for one day by committing during registration to pay $10 on the day of the exam, they probably would reject that offer. The choice is the same, although made at different points in time. Because the outcome would change depending on the point in time, the students would exhibit time inconsistency. *Monetary policy makers suffer from dynamic inconsistency with inflation expectations, as politicians are best off promising lower inflation in the future. But once tomorrow comes lowering inflation may have negative effects, such as increasing unemployment, so they do not make much effort to lower it. This is why independent central banks are believed to be advantageous for a country. Indeed, \\"a central bank with a high degree of discretion in conducting monetary policy would find itself under constant political pressure to boost the economy and reduce unemployment, but since the economy cannot exceed its potential GDP or its natural rate of unemployment over time, this policy would instead only lead to higher inflation in the long run\\". The first paper on this subject was published by Finn E. Kydland and Edward C. Prescott in the Journal of Political Economy in 1977, which eventually led to their winning the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2004. (See also Monetary policy credibility.) *One famous example in literature of a mechanism for dealing with dynamic inconsistency is that of Odysseus and the Sirens. Curious to hear the Sirens' songs but mindful of the danger, Odysseus orders his men to stop their ears with beeswax and ties himself to the mast of the ship. Most importantly, he orders his men not to heed his cries while they pass the Sirens; recognizing that in the future he may behave irrationally, Odysseus limits his future agency and binds himself to a commitment mechanism (i.e., the mast) to survive this perilous example of dynamic inconsistency. This example has been used by economists to explain the benefits of commitment mechanisms in mitigating dynamic inconsistency. *A curious case of dynamic inconsistency in psychology is described by . In the experiment, subjects of the study were offered free rentals of movies which were classified into two categories - \\"lowbrow\\" (e.g., The Breakfast Club) and \\"highbrow\\" (e.g., Schindler's List) - and researchers analyzed patterns of choices made. In the absence of dynamic inconsistency, the choice would be expected to be the same regardless of the delay between the decision date and the consumption date. In practice, however, the outcome was different. When subjects had to choose a movie to watch immediately, the choice was consistently lowbrow for the majority of the subjects. But when they were asked to pick a movie to be watched at later date, highbrow movies were chosen far more often. Among movies picked four or more days in advance, over 70% were highbrow. *People display a consistent bias to believe that they will have more time in the future than they have today. Specifically, there is a persistent belief among people that they are \\"unusually busy in the immediate future, but will become less busy shortly\\". However, the amount of time you have this week is generally representative of the time you have in future weeks. When people are estimating their time and when deciding if they will make a commitment, they anticipate more \\"time slack\\" in future weeks than the present week. Experiments by on this topic showed that people tend to discount investments of time more than money. They nicknamed this the \\"Yes...Damn!\\" effect because people tend to commit themselves to time-consuming activities like traveling to a conference under the false impression that they will be less busy in the future.

This time-limited therapy was developed in the context of the UK's National Health Service with the aim of providing effective and affordable psychological treatment which could be realistically provided in a resource constrained public health system. It is distinctive due to its intensive use of reformulation, its integration of cognitive and analytic practice and its collaborative nature, involving the patient very actively in their treatment. The CAT practitioner aims to work with the patient to identify procedural sequences; chains of events, thoughts, emotions and motivations that explain how a target problem (for example self- harm) is established and maintained. In addition to the procedural sequence model, a second distinguishing feature of CAT is the use of reciprocal roles (RRs). These identify problems as occurring between people and not within the patient. RRs may be set up in early life and then be replayed in later life; for example someone who as a child felt neglected by parents perceived as abandoning might be vulnerable to feelings of abandonment in later life (or indeed neglect themselves). Sources and origins As the name implies, CAT evolved as an integrative therapy based on ideas from cognitive and analytic therapies. CAT was also influenced in part by George Kelly's constructivism. Kelly had developed personal construct theory and the repertory grid method, and Kelly's approach to therapy \\"offered a model of nonauthoritarian practice\\" that psychotherapist Anthony Ryle found appealing. Ryle, a general practitioner and analytically trained psychotherapist, was undertaking research into psychotherapy practice using repertory grids in the 1970s. He found that the themes eventually addressed in analytic work were in fact present in transcripts from the very first sessions. However the slow, exploratory nature of traditional analytic therapy meant that these were not always addressed early and assertively, with the result that therapy, while effective, took a long time to produce results. He proposed a shorter, more active form of therapy which integrated elements from cognitive therapy practice (such as goal setting and Socratic questioning) into analytic practice. This would include explicitly formulating the problems experienced by the patient, and sharing this formulation with the patient to engage them in psychotherapy as a co-operative enterprise. Subsequently CAT has been influenced by ideas from the work of Vygotsky and Bakhtin. From Vygotsky come concepts such as the zone of proximal development (ZPD) and scaffolding.Vygotsky, L. S. (1987). Thinking and speech. In L. S. Vygotsky, Collected works (vol. 1, pp. 39-285) (R. Rieber & A. Carton, Eds; N. Minick, Trans.). New York: Plenum. (Original works published in 1934, 1960). The ZPD implies that new tasks set for the patient (for example, tolerating anxiety about social situations) should extend what they do beyond their current capabilities, but only by a small and achievable amount. Scaffolding involves the therapist providing support for the patient's efforts to change, but varying this level of support as the patient's needs change. Bakhtin provided concepts such as dialogism from which come techniques such as Dialogical Sequence Analysis. This is a structured attempt to identify and visually display sequences of behaviour, thinking, and emotions so that the patient becomes more aware of these and can start to modify them.Leiman, M. (2004). Dialogical sequence analysis. In: H. J. M. Hermans & G. Dimaggio (eds.), The dialogical self in psychotherapy (pp. 255‚Äì270). London: Brunner-Routledge. In practice An example of two different reciprocal roles which might be identified during the reformulation phase of CAT. A procedural diagram which might be drawn during the recognition phase of CAT. The model emphasises collaborative work with the client, and focuses on the understanding of the patterns of maladaptive behaviours. The aim of the therapy is to enable the client to recognise these patterns, understand their origins, and subsequently to learn alternative strategies in order to cope better. The approach is always time-limited, typically taking place over 8-24 weekly sessions (the precise number being agreed at the start of therapy). Sixteen sessions is probably the most common length. In the first quarter of the therapy (the Reformulation phase) the therapist collects all the relevant information, asking the patient about present day problems and also earlier life experiences. At that point the therapist writes a reformulation letter to the client. This letter summarises the therapist's understanding of the client's problems. Particular attention is given to understanding the connection between childhood patterns of behaviour and their impact on adult life. The letter is agreed between patient and therapist and forms the basis for the rest of the work. After the reformulation letter the patient may be asked to complete diaries or rating sheets to record the occurrence of problems and their context. During this period (known as the Recognition phase) patient and therapist construct a diagrammatic formulation to illustrate the unhelpful procedures which maintain problems for the patient. The aim of this phase is to enable the patient to recognise when and how problems occur. In the second half of the therapy work moves into the Revision phase, where patient and therapist identify and practice \\"exits\\" from the procedural diagram established in the previous phase. For example, a problematic procedure might move a patient from feeling angry to taking an overdose. An exit might involve expressing the anger in some way as an alternative to self-injuring behaviour. At the end of the therapy, patient and therapist each write \\"goodbye letters\\" which they exchange, summarising what has been achieved in the therapy and what remains to be done. After the end of the agreed number of weekly sessions, planned follow-up sessions take place to monitor and support the changes that have been made. Typically, a 16-session CAT might be followed up by a single session one month after the end of therapy, and a final one three months later. The evidence base CAT has been the subject of a number of research studies published in peer-reviewed journals. These include randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and other kinds of study. The approach is too new for any systematic reviews of RCTs to have been conducted, and therefore is not yet explicitly recommended by name by the UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE). However NICE has recommended that there should be further research of CAT, for example in borderline personality disorder.NICE (January 2009). Borderline personality disorder: Treatment and management, NICE guidelines [CG78], p. 30. A review of CAT research evidence published in 2014 reported that although there were five randomised controlled trials published, research evidence into the approach was dominated by small-scale, practice-based studies. These tended to be with complex and severe clinical groups; 44% of studies reviewed involved personality disorder. A review of CAT looking back over the 30 years to its beginnings contains a meta-analysis of 11 outcome studies of CAT. The overall number of patients treated in the studies was 324 and the average effect size across all studies was 0.83 (95% confidence interval 0.66-1.00). This is a large effect and suggests that CAT is efficacious in treating mental health problems. Evidence from randomised controlled trials CAT has been shown to lead to subjective improvement in people with anorexia nervosa. It has also been shown to produce significant improvements in adolescents with a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder. A different trial suggested that CAT for adult patients with personality disorders also showed improvements in symptoms and interpersonal functioning, as against controls who deteriorated on these measures. CAT has also been shown to improve patients' management of diabetes. An RCT of the use of a CAT-informed assessment for young people who had self-harmed suggested that it was effective in increasing rates of attendance at community follow- up. Evidence from other methodologies Comparative studies have suggested CAT to be at least as effective as other forms of brief psychotherapy,Mann, J & Goldman, R (1982).

His father Daniel Kemper had been a Deputy Clothier-General in the Continental Army during the American Revolution. His mother, Elizabeth (Marius) Kemper, descended from well-known families of the Dutch New Amsterdam era. Kemper entered Columbia College at the age of fifteen, where he studied theology under Dr. Henry Hobart and graduated in 1809 as the valedictorian of his class. Career Jackson Kemper Relocating to Philadelphia, Kemper was ordained a deacon of the Episcopal Church in 1811 by Bishop William White, and a priest in 1814 as he served at Christ Church. Particularly interested in evangelism, Kemper even persuaded his elderly mentor to make a missionary journey to western Pennsylvania during which also he founded St. Matthew's Episcopal Church in Wheeling, West Virginia.https://liturgyandmusic.wordpress.com/2011/05/24/may-24-jackson- kemper-first-missionary-bishop-in-the-united-states-1870/ In 1835, the Episcopal Church's General Convention decided to consecrate missionary bishops to preach the Gospel west of the settled areas. Fr. Kemper was the first chosen. After being consecrated as a bishop he promptly headed west for Indiana and Missouri. Since most clergy who had lived all their lives in the settled East were slow to respond to his call to join him on the frontier, Kemper determined to recruit priests from among men already in the West. He established a training college in St. Louis, Missouri, for that purpose, which failed in 1845 for lack of funding. He went on to found Nashotah House in 1842 and Racine College in Wisconsin. Kemper also founded the mission parish that became the Cathedral Church of All Saints in Milwaukee. Kemper constantly urged outreach to the Native American peoples, and translations of the Scriptures and the services of the Church into their languages. His first official act as Missionary Bishop, in what would become Wisconsin, was laying the cornerstone for a new frame church building for Hobart Church, Duck Creek, which served the Oneida Indian Mission.Wagner, Harold Ezra (1947). The Episcopal Church in Wisconsin, 1847-1947: A History of the Diocese of Milwaukee. Milwaukee, Wisconsin: Diocese of Milwaukee. Perhaps more significantly, the first ordinations in what would become Wisconsin were also at Hobart Church. There Kemper ordained William Adams and James Lloyd Breck, two young recruits from the East who helped him establish Nashotah House Seminary, on October 9, 1842.Breck, Charles (1883). The Life of the Reverend James Lloyd Breck, D.D.: Chiefly from Letters Written by Himself. New York: E. & J. B. Young. He was regularly invited to the Oneida reservation at Duck Creek by chief Daniel Bread. Kemper ordained a Native American, Enmegahbowh, of the Ottawa tribe as a deacon in 1859. Kemper's tomb at Nashotah House Kemper supported the Oxford Movement, although he maintained the importance of separation from the Roman Catholic Church. He ordained James De Koven as a priest in 1855, and supported Benjamin Onderdonk during his trial. In 1846 Kemper purchased a property adjacent to Nashotah House where he lived the rest of his life. From 1847 until 1854, Kemper served as Provisional Bishop of the newly formed Diocese of Wisconsin, and then served as its diocesan bishop from 1854 until his death in 1870.Wagner, Harold Ezra (1947). The Episcopal Church in Wisconsin, 1847-1947: A History of the Diocese of Milwaukee. Milwaukee, Wisconsin: Diocese of Milwaukee. Kemper also supported creation of a new diocese, though he did not live to see the formation of the Diocese of Fond du Lac come to fruition.Curtiss, A. Parker (1925). History of the Diocese of Fond du Lac and Its Several Congregations. Fond du Lac, Wisconsin: P.B. Haber Printing. Bishopstead, his residence in Delafield, Wisconsin, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Kemper Hall, an Episcopal school for girls in Kenosha, Wisconsin that was named after him, is also listed on the National Register. Veneration Kemper is honored with a feast day on the liturgical calendar of the Episcopal Church (USA) on May 24.

Overview The group was founded in 1902 by Einstein, Conrad Habicht, and Maurice Solovine, and played a significant role in Einstein's intellectual development. Before his \\"miracle year\\" (1905), when Einstein was a patent clerk in Bern, the group of friends met to debate books in the fields of physics and philosophy. The group's origin lay in Einstein's need to offer private lessons in mathematics and physics in order to make a living (in 1901, before he took up his post at the patent office in Bern). Solovine, a Romanian philosophy student, answered Einstein's newspaper advertisement. In fact neither the tutorials nor any payment materialised; instead, the two began to meet regularly to discuss their shared interest in physics and philosophy. They were soon joined by the mathematician Habicht, who was Einstein's neighbour at Schaffhausen; in 1902 they named themselves the Akademie Olympia, and though a friend would occasionally join them in one of their meetings, the Academy remained essentially just the trio of Einstein, Habicht, and Solovine until the latter two left Bern in 1904 and 1905 respectively. The first book that Einstein suggested for reading was Karl Pearson's The Grammar of Science. The three discussed their own work and also books such as Ernst Mach‚Äôs Analyse der Empfindungen (Analysis of Sensations), Henri Poincar√©'s Wissenschaft und Hypothese (Science and Hypothesis), John Stuart Mill‚Äôs A System of Logic, David Hume‚Äôs Treatise of Human Nature, and Baruch Spinoza‚Äôs Ethics, and sometimes literary works such as Miguel de Cervantes' Don Quixote. Despite the brief existence of the Academy, it had a lasting effect on the three friends; they remained in touch throughout their lives, and Einstein was to say that it had had an effect on his later scientific career.

They called a meeting in January 1938 at Bloomsbury, London which was attended by 30 people and which acted as the foundation of the organisation being formed the following year. The first issue of the charity‚Äôs newsletter was published in April 1939. On 18 May 1939 a letter from Hugh Moulton, Liberal politician, was published informing the public of the formation of the Infantile Paralysis Fellowship which \\"seeks to help the sufferers help themselves and to afford each other mutual aid and sympathy\\". The letter went on to say the principal objective of the Fellowship was to help members find work and suggested that there were (at that time) somewhere between 5,000-7,000 people with the after-effects of infantile paralysis in Britain.North, Barry \\"Something To Lean On\\". The British Polio Fellowship, 1999, p.1-3 Over time the focus of the charity's work has shifted due to the eradication of polio in the UK during the 1980s and the discovery of post-polio syndrome, and the fellowship's work has become more about supporting those with PPS.

The charity was founded by the late Keith Pennock who had a daughter with a learning disability. The work was derived from Glenn Doman's The Institutes for The Achievement of Human Potential (IAHP) in Philadelphia, USA. Many of the children they work with have disorders of the nervous system, or inherited characteristics, which affect the way the body or brain develops. These include: acquired and traumatic brain injury, Down syndrome, Cerebral palsy, Autism, Specific developmental disorders, Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and Learning disability including dyslexia, developmental coordination disorder and dyscalculia. Unlike many other organisations, bibic also works with children that have no formal diagnosis at all. A variety of therapeutic approaches are used. There is no peer reviewed research into the effectiveness of therapy for this condition. The organisation raises funds and receives no Government funding. The charities National Assessment Centre is based at Old Kelways, just outside the town of Langport, in Somerset. Keith Pennock's book Rescuing brain injured children describes the impetus for starting the organisation as his daughter, who had developmental delay. In 1970 the family travelled from the UK to Philadelphia attended the IAHP, and adopted the Doman-Delecato patterning technique in the UK. A precursor to bibic was opened in Staffordshire later the same year, as news spread of the family and their use of the new therapy method. Local residents began to give donations and offer their time. The British Institute for the Achievement of Human Potential (BIAHP) was established in 1974, with staff being trained directly at the IAHP in Philadelphia. The family and fledgeling organisation moved to Knowle Hall near Bridgewater, Somerset in 1976. In 1979, the IAHP (under the management of Glenn Doman) were turning their interests to \\"well children\\" with the introduction of a Better Babies programme. The board of the BIAHP felt that they could not support this shift in focus and wanted to continue their work solely with children who had a brain injury, therefore through necessity the British Institute of Brain Injured Children was launched as an independent organisation in 1980 ‚Äì no links with the IAHP were retained, and staff began to be trained in the UK. In 1987 a research piece was commissioned to demonstrate the effectiveness of the programme, in association with the University of Surrey. Keith Pennock resigned from his post as chief executive of BIBIC in early 1996. In 1999, research covering the period 1995-1997 at BIBIC was published. In a letter to the [journal] editor, the authors of the appraisal report noted that strong similarities to the Doman-Delecato Patterning method (a therapy by this point widely condemned) remained strong despite BIBIC making revisions, and that areas of the therapy caused concern. BIBIC responded later that year, informing the journal that significant changes had been made to the programme, with the appraisal report being a much-anticipated catalyst for doing so. Since these revisions and under new management the organisation has been registered as a charity, and is now known only as \\"bibic\\". Bibic remains an active organisation and also provides policy input. Bibic now reports to base its programme of developmental therapy on more recent research based on the concept of neuroplasticity, the brain's ability to undergo alterations in response to internal and external environmental changes. Bibic moved to Langport in Somerset, in 2014.

It was preceded by the National Association for the Deaf and Dumb (NADD), which had been founded by deaf people in 1886. The creation of the NADD had been in response to the perceived threats to the language and education rights of deaf people which had arisen after the Milan Conference of 1880. This international congress, where the majority of those attending were people who taught hearing to deaf children, had passed a resolution banning the use of sign languages throughout the world. The participants of the conference had then returned to their home countries, determined to eradicate both the employment of deaf teachers and the use of sign language in schools. They also sought to reduce class sizes to those that were manageable by hearing teachers. A Royal Commission on the education of deaf children was launched in 1889 but it failed to consult deaf people and supported the establishment of the Pure Oral System and so the banning of sign language; in response the magazine Deaf Mute encouraged deaf people to unite in defence of their own interests. In 1889, the NADD ceased to exist and so four deaf men, including Francis Maginn and George Healey, arranged a meeting in January 1890 at St. Saviour's Church for the Deaf, Oxford Street, London, that they called the \\"National Conference of Adult Deaf and Dumb Missions and Associations\\". The conference considered the forming of a national society to \\"elevate the education and social status of the Deaf and Dumb in the United Kingdom\\" and resulted in the formation of the British Deaf and Dumb Association (BDDA) in Leeds on 24 July 1890. The BDDA deleted the world \\"Dumb\\" from its title in 1971. It wasn't until the 1970s that schools began to look again at accepting sign language. The advent of sign language and its acceptance by the general public resulted in deaf leaders slowly coming back to the forefront starting with Jock Young as the first deaf chair in 1983 and, in the mid-1990s, its first deaf chief executive, Jeff McWhinney. In the 1990s the BDA became a deaf-led organisation and the campaigning for the recognition of sign language is to date the main focus of their work. The current Chair is Linda Richards. Previous Chairs include the late Terry Riley, editor of the BBC's See Hear programme.

He was the founder of the famous casino in Monte Carlo, as his title in Monegasque and Italian was Carlo III.Referred to also as Carlo III. He was born in Paris, the only son of Florestan, Prince of Monaco, and Maria Caroline Gibert de Lametz. Marriage and reign { align=\\"left\\"  Royal Monogram of Prince Charles III of Monaco } While he was Hereditary Prince, Charles was married on 28 September 1846 in Brussels to Countess Antoinette de M√©rode- Westerloo. He succeeded his father Prince Florestan I in 1856. During his reign, the towns of Menton and Roquebrune, constituting some 80 percent of Monegasque territory, were formally ceded to France, paving the way for formal French recognition of Monaco's independence. Rebellions in these towns, aided by the Kingdom of Sardinia, had exhausted Monaco's military resources for decades. The Principality was in dire need of cash flow, so Prince Charles and his mother, Princess Caroline, had the idea of erecting a casino. The Monte Carlo Casino was done, according to the Prince's liking, in the German style and placed at the sight of Les Sp√©lugues. Monte Carlo (in English, Mount Charles) itself takes its name from Charles, after all its founder. Charles established a society (business) to run the Casino; this society is today the Soci√©t√© des bains de mer de Monaco. Under Charles III, the Principality of Monaco increased its diplomatic activities; for example, in 1864, Charles III concluded a Treaty of Friendship with the Bey of Tunis, Muhammad III as-Sadiq, which also regulated trade and maritime issues. Honours Monte Carlo is named after Charles III. It stands for the \\"Mount Charles\\" in Italian. The Order of Saint-Charles was instituted on 15 March 1858, during the reign of Prince Charles III. He received the following decorations and awards: * 50px Grand Cross of St. Olav, with Collar, 27 March 1863 (Sweden-Norway) * 50px Grand Cross of the Dannebrog, in Diamonds, 16 February 1865 (Denmark)Kongelig Dansk Hof-og Statskalendar (1880) (in Danish), \\"De Kongelig Danske Ridderordener\\", p. 8 * 50px Grand Cross of the Ludwig Order, 17 April 1865 (Grand Duchy of Hesse) Hof- und Staats-Handbuch des Gro√üherzogtum Hessen (1879), \\"Gro√üherzogliche Orden und Ehrenzeichen\\" p. 12 * 50px Grand Cross of the Order of Charles III, 17 February 1867 (Spain) * 50px Grand Cross of the Z√§hringer Lion, 1869 (Grand Duchy of Baden)Hof- und Staats-Handbuch des Gro√üherzogtum Baden (1873), \\"Gro√üherzogliche Orden\\" p. 74 * 50px Officer of the Legion d'Honneur, for his service in the French Navy in the Franco- Prussian War (French Empire) * 50px Grand Cordon of the Royal Order of Leopold, 1874 (Belgium)Almanach royal officiel: 1875; p. 55 * 50px Grand Cross of St. Stephen, 1882 (Austria-Hungary)\\"A Szent Istv√°n Rend tagjai\\" * 50px Knight of the Supreme Order of Christ (Holy See) * 50px Grand Cross of the Tower and Sword (Kingdom of Portugal) Death In his middle years his sight greatly weakened, and by the last decade of his life he had become almost totally blind. In fact, Dr. Thomas Henry Pickering wrote in 1882: \\"So far back as 1860, Prince Charles lost his eyesight....\\" He died at Ch√¢teau de Marchais on 10 September 1889. He was succeeded by his son Albert I of Monaco. Coin On 1 June 2016, fifteen thousand 2 euro coins were issued by Monaco; commemorating the 150th anniversary of the foundation of Monte Carlo by Charles III In literature Charles III is referenced, as Prince Charles Honor√©, in a fictional entitled, The Fall of Prince Florestan of Monaco, by the British politician Sir Charles Wentworth Dilke. This work was one of satire and parody on a number of political characters of the day. It centered around a Cambridge-educated, half-W√ºrttemberg nephew of Charles III who comes to the throne by way of Charles III and the next two heirs being wiped out of existence. The upstart \\"Florestan II\\", a radical republican, boldly attempts to democratize Monaco. He fails and then is forced to leave the country.

They started as dance contests in the 1920s and developed into entertainment events during the Great Depression in the 1930s. Before the development of \\"reality shows\\", dance marathons blurred the line between theatre and reality. Also known as endurance contests, dance marathons attracted people to compete as a way to achieve fame or win monetary prizes.Camus, Renee. \\"Dance Marathons\\", U.S.A. Twenties, Grolier, 2004 , 2005 paperback The 1969 film They Shoot Horses, Don't They?, based on the 1935 novel of the same title written by Horace McCoy, a bouncer at several such marathons,Carol J. Martin, popularized the idea and prompted students at Northwestern University, Pennsylvania State University, Indiana University, Ohio State University, the University of Florida, the University of Kentucky, the University of Iowa, and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill to create charity dance marathons. Marathons could last anywhere from a few hours to several weeks.  Popularity  Dancers at a 1923 event Dance marathons became popular in the United States during the Great Depression. The popularity of dance marathons began in 1923 when a woman named Alma Cummings danced continuously for 27 hours with six different partners. After Cummings established her record, dance marathons became common in the United States. Initially, participants competed in order to break Cummings's record, but later on people began to compete to win prizes, which could range from money to publicity.‚ÄúDance Marathon‚Äù Sonny Watson‚Äôs StreetSwing.com. January 1, 2013. Accessed April 8,2015. Dance marathons were a huge hit during the Great Depression as they provided contestants and spectators food, shelter and the opportunity to earn cash prizes, at a time when many people needed a meal and free entertainment. The dances were popular at this time because these events supplied basic human needs to both the contestants and audience. The depression era marathons faded in the public's enthusiasm in the late 1930s due to increased municipal ordinances and the decreased number of towns where the seamier side of the promotions were unknown. The improving economic conditions and the American entry into World War II also contributed to their demise.  Rules  Rules vary widely, but one common rule of the marathon stated that the participants could not fall asleep, although some marathons would allow one part of the team to sleep as long as their teammates continued dancing. It was important for the team to keep moving because if they stopped, they would be disqualified from the contest. Contestants were only allowed to leave the dance floor for hygienic or medical purposes, to change clothing, or for other similar circumstances.Farrel, James. \\"The dance marathons.\\" Melus 18, no. 1 (Spring93 1993): 133. Academic Search Complete, EBSCOhost (accessed March 22, 2015). A mixture of other elements were incorporated in the marathons including elimination sprints, raffles, mud wrestling and fake weddings of competitors. Oftentimes, the type of music played at a dance marathon changed throughout the duration of it. It consisted of a mix of slow and upbeat music to give the contestants breaks and also keep them going and energized. Spectators were allowed to come in and watch the marathon and the contestants competing. Often, viewers were able to pay 25 cents to watch the marathon for as long as they wished.  Opposing groups  Although many people supported marathons because they were sources of entertainment, there were outside groups that opposed the marathons. Some external groups did not like what the marathons were doing to participants. Movie theater owners, church groups, and women's groups were among those that opposed the marathons. Movie theatre owners were unhappy because people were paying to watch the marathons instead of attending films. Churches were unhappy with the way that the contestants danced with each other as it was not socially acceptable during the time period. Women's groups were upset because they thought it was unethical to charge spectators to watch dancers humiliate themselves. In 1928, Seattle passed an ordinance prohibiting dance marathons within city limits when a woman attempted suicide after competing in a 19-day marathon and receiving 5th place. Other states followed Seattle's precedent shortly after. Although marathons were extremely popular, they were also dangerous. During a marathon in the 1920s, a man named Homer Morehouse was the first contestant to dance in the marathon, but after dancing for 87 hours, he collapsed from exhaustion and died on the dance floor. Charity dance marathons Today, over 250 colleges and high schools nationwide participate in dance marathons of some sort to raise money for children's hospitals. Some raise money under the Children's Miracle Network and with their help, while others are entirely student-run and operate to benefit partnered charities. Each year, students organize and host different types of dance marathon events in which participants stand on their feet for 12‚Äì46 hours straight. Some US student-run dance marathons include: Penn State Dance Marathon (THON) A modern charity dance marathon at Pennsylvania State University The Penn State Dance Marathon, commonly referred to as THON, is a 46 hour dance marathon which takes place every February at Pennsylvania State University to raise money to combat children's cancer. THON was started in 1973 by the university's Interfraternity and Panhellenic Councils and in its first year raised more than $2,000. Today, it is the largest student-run philanthropy in the world which has raised over $157 million since 1977. In 2011, THON raised $9,563,016.09, in 2013, $12,374,034.46 and in 2014, $13,343,517.33. In 2020 THON raised $11,696,942.38. The money raised is donated to the Four Diamonds Fund, a charity devoted to defeating pediatric cancer through research and treats patients at the Penn State Hershey Medical Center Children's Hospital. University of Kentucky DanceBlue DanceBlue , one of the University of Kentucky's most-loved traditions, is a 24-hour no sitting, no sleeping dance marathon and is the fastest growing student-ran philanthropy in the Southeastern Conference. Entering its 15th year, over $15.3 million dollars has been raised by students, faculty/staff, corporate donors, and mini- marathons held by high schools around Kentucky. Money raised goes into the Golden Matrix Fund, which was established in 2006 to benefit the DanceBlue Kentucky Children's Hospital Hematology/Oncology Clinic both today and well into the future through an endowment. In its 15 years, DanceBlue has been able to fund numerous projects and programs. In addition to small but important patient support programs such as the ‚ÄúBeads of Courage‚Äù program that each child receives after cancer treatments, this fund has been able to allow the hiring of vital staff in the clinic such as a Childlife Specialist who provides encouragement and distraction to help the child emotionally handle their diagnosis and the treatments. Finally, the support of the Golden Matrix Fund has recently allowed for the construction of a new Pediatric Hematology/Oncology Clinic that has expanded the capacity of the clinic as well as providing a more convenient and comfortable experience for the families. In 2019, DanceBlue raised $1,880,954.88 for the Golden Matrix Fund.http://www.danceblue.org/  Northwestern University Dance Marathon (NUDM)  Founded in 1975, Northwestern University Dance Marathon, commonly referred to as NUDM, is one of the nation's largest student-run philanthropies. The event unites more than 1,500 students, faculty, and staff to participate in the 30-hour dance-a-thon at the end of the winter quarter in early March. Unlike other Dance Marathons, NUDM changes which charity it primarily supports from year to year. The primary beneficiary is chosen each May, and will receive 90% of all funds raised throughout the year. The other 10% is donated to the Evanston Community Foundation (ECF), which then uses this gift to allocate grants to local Evanston charities. NUDM 2020 will be the 23rd year where ECF has been the secondary beneficiary. With 1,000 dancers and over 500 committee members who work throughout the year to help organize the event and raise awareness, NUDM is a Northwestern tradition. In 2014, NUDM raised its highest total to date, $1,385,273 to benefit Team Joseph. In 45 years, NUDM raised more than $20 million for over 30 charities.  Indiana University Dance Marathon (IUDM)  The Indiana University Dance Marathon, commonly known as IU Dance Marathon or IUDM, is a 36-hour Dance Marathon that takes place every November at Indiana University with the purpose of raising both funding and awareness for pediatric care. In 1991, student Jill Stewart started IU Dance Marathon in honor of her friend, Ryan White, who died from AIDS the year before. Since then, IUDM has raised over $32 million for Riley Hospital for Children, including $4,203,326.23 during the 2017 marathon year. IUDM currently supports the Wells Center for Pediatric Research and Riley Hospital for Children.  University of Florida Dance Marathon  Dance Marathon at University of Florida, commonly referred to as DM at UF, is an annual 26.2 hour dance marathon that takes place every March or April to benefit patients at the University of Florida Health Shands Children's Hospital in Gainesville. Each year, more than 800 students stay awake and on their feet to raise money and awareness for Children's Miracle Network Hospitals. In the 25 years of DM at UF, more than $21.4 million has been donated, which makes it the most successful student-run philanthropy in the southeastern United States. In 2019, DM at UF broke records with a total of $3,230,025.23 raised for the Children's Miracle Network Hospitals at the University of Florida Health Shands Children's Hospital.  University of Iowa Dance Marathon (UIDM)  The University of Iowa Dance Marathon was founded in 1994 and provides financial and emotional support to pediatric oncology and bone marrow transplant patients treated at the University of Iowa Stead Family Children's Hospital. Over the past 24 years, the University's largest student organization has raised $24,548,226.30 for the children's hospital. In 2018, UIDM raised a total of $3,011,015.24, making it the second Miracle Network Dance Marathon in the country to raise over three million dollars. After a ten-year, $5 million leadership gift to the University of Iowa Stead Family Children's Hospital's building campaign, the 11th floor was named the UI Dance Marathon Pediatric Cancer Center. Since then, the student- run group has donated over $2.2 million to create the UI Dance Marathon Pediatric Oncology Targeted Therapy Program and $2 million to establish the first student-funded chair position at the University of Iowa, the UI Dance Marathon Chair in Pediatric Oncology, Clinical and Translational Research.  Dance Marathon at the University of Michigan (DMUM)  Dance Marathon at the University of Michigan (DMUM) was founded in 1997 and raises funds awareness for pediatric rehabilitation therapies at C.S. Mott Children's Hospital, part of the University of Michigan Health System. The money raised for these programs allows DMUM families to participate in various pediatric rehabilitation therapies. Participants of DMUM volunteer at these therapies in order to build relationships with the children who benefit from these programs. Every March, participants of DMUM stand for over 24 hours at Michigan's Indoor Track and Field to show their dedication to the children, families, and hospitals they support. In 2017, DMUM raised over $510,000 for the kids.  University of Maryland Terp Thon  Terp Thon at the University of Maryland was founded in 2009 and has since raised over $4.2 million For The Kids at Children's National Health System in Washington D.C. 100% of the fundraising efforts go directly to Children's National so that no family is turned away due to their inability to pay. Terp Thon creates events throughout the year to aid fundraising and awareness efforts. Each year, Terp Thon continues to break records and in 2014 became the youngest dance marathon to enter the Top 10 Dance Marathon programs in the country. In 2015, Terp Thon raised more than $600,000. In 2017, Terp Thon raised over $1 million becoming the youngest ever Dance Marathon to accomplish this.

Most of today's glacial landforms were created by the movement of large ice sheets during the Quaternary glaciations. Some areas, like Fennoscandia and the southern Andes, have extensive occurrences of glacial landforms; other areas, such as the Sahara, display rare and very old fossil glacial landforms. Erosional landforms Erosional landformsAs the glaciers expand, due to their accumulating weight of snow and ice they crush and abrade and scour surfaces such as rocks and bedrock. The resulting erosional landforms include striations, cirques, glacial horns, ar√™tes, trim lines, U-shaped valleys, roches moutonn√©es, overdeepenings and hanging valleys. * Cirque: Starting location for mountain glaciers * Cirque stairway: a sequence of cirques * U-shaped, or trough, valley: U-shaped valleys are created by mountain glaciers. When filled with ocean water so as to create anthe glacial action erodes through, a spillway (or col) forms * Valley step: an abrupt change in the longitudinal slope of a glacial valley Depositional landforms Depositional landforms Later, when the glaciers retreated leaving behind their freight of crushed rock and sand (glacial drift), they created characteristic depositional landforms. Examples include glacial moraines, eskers, and kames. Drumlins and ribbed moraines are also landforms left behind by retreating glaciers. The stone walls of New England contain many glacial erratics, rocks that were dragged by a glacier many miles from their bedrock origin.Harvey, A. M. ‚ÄúLocal-Scale geomorphology ‚Äì process systems and landforms.‚Äù Introducing Geomorphology: A Guide to Landforms and Processes. Dunedin Academic Press, 2012, pp. 87‚Äì88. EBSCOhost. * Esker: Built up bed of a subglacial stream. * Kame: Irregularly shaped mound. * Moraine: Feature can be terminal (at the end of a glacier), lateral (along the sides of a glacier), or medial (formed by the merger of lateral moraines from contributary glaciers). * Outwash fan: Braided stream flowing from the front end of a glacier. Glacial lakes and ponds Lakes and ponds may also be caused by glacial movement. Kettle lakes form when a retreating glacier leaves behind an underground or surface chunk of ice that later melts to form a depression containing water. Moraine-dammed lakes occur when glacial debris dam a stream (or snow runoff). Jackson Lake and Jenny Lake in Grand Teton National Park are examples of moraine-dammed lakes, though Jackson Lake is enhanced by a man-made dam. * Kettle lake: Depression, formed by a block of ice separated from the main glacier, in which the lake forms * Tarn: A lake formed in a cirque by overdeepening * Paternoster lake: A series of lakes in a glacial valley, formed when a stream is dammed by successive recessional moraines left by an advancing or retreating glacier * Glacial lake: A lake that formed between the front of a glacier and the last recessional moraine Ice features Apart from the landforms left behind by glaciers, glaciers themselves may be striking features of the terrain, particularly in the polar regions of Earth. Notable examples include valley glaciers where glacial flow is restricted by the valley walls, crevasses in the upper section of glacial ice, and icefalls‚Äîthe ice equivalent of waterfalls. Disputed origin The glacial origin of some landforms has been questioned. Erling Lindstr√∂m has advanced the thesis that roches moutonn√©es may not be entirely glacial landforms taking most of their shape before glaciation. Jointing that contribute to the shape typically predate glaciation and roche moutonn√©e-like forms can be found in tropical areas such as East Africa and Australia. Further at Iv√∂ Lake in Sweden weathered rock surfaces exposed by kaolin mining resemble roche moutonn√©e. The idea of elevated flat surfaces being shaped by glaciation‚Äîthe glacial buzzsaw effect‚Äîhas been rejected by various scholars. In the case of Norway the elevated paleic surface has been proposed to have been shaped by the glacial buzzsaw effect. However, this proposal is difficult to reconcile with the fact that the paleic surface consist of a series of steps at different levels. Further glacial cirques, that in the buzzsaw hypothesis contribute to belevel the landscape, are not associated to any paleosurface levels of the composite paleic surface, nor does the modern equilibrium line altitude (ELA) or the Last Glacial Maximum ELA match any given level of the paleic surface. The elevated plains of West Greenland are also unrelated to any glacial buzzsaw effect. The Gulf of Bothnia and Hudson Bay, two large depressions at the centre of former ice sheets, are known to be more the result of tectonics than of any weak glacial erosion.

Publication history An original character from DC's Milestone Comics imprint, she first appeared in Icon #1 (May 1993) where she was created by Dwayne McDuffie (writer), Denys Cowan, and Mark Bright. At the 2008 Comic- Con, DC Comics executive editor Dan DiDio announced that the Milestone Universe and characters would be revived and merged into the DC Universe proper. The merger treats the characters as new to the universe, ignoring the \\"Worlds Collide\\" Milestone/DC crossover of 1994. Rocket reappeared in Justice League of America (vol. 2) #27, written by creator Dwayne McDuffie. Character biography Raquel Ervin was born in Paris Island, the poorest, most crime-ridden neighborhood in Dakota.Dwayne McDuffie (writer), Icon #1 (May 1993) Although she is only the sidekick of the title character, Icon, she is the actual protagonist of the series. She yearned to become a writer (\\"just like Toni Morrison\\"), but lacked inspiration until she met Augustus Freeman IV, a corporate lawyer who was secretly a stranded alien with superhuman powers. This occurred while she and her friends were robbing Freeman's home. Raquel convinced Augustus to become the superhero Icon, and to take her on as his sidekick, Rocket. While in costume, she wore a belt that Icon fashioned out of his escape pod's inertia winder, which allowed her to manipulate kinetic energy.Icon #8 Shortly after she began adventuring with Icon, Raquel discovered that she was pregnant by her ex-boyfriend, Noble (one of the other robbers from the day she met Freeman).Icon #3 She gave birth to a son, Amistad Augustus Ervin, named \\"Amistad\\" after the famous ship that brought slaves over from Africa to America,http://worldofblackheroes.wordpress.com/2011/03/09/rocket-raquel- ervin/ and \\"Augustus\\" in honor of Icon.Icon #24 While her pregnancy caused her to give up adventuring for a time, Raquel eventually became a superhero again.Icon #26 Rocket also assists the Blood Syndicate member Flashback in fighting her addiction to crack cocaine. Rocket was more liberal than Icon, which caused them to clash on a number of occasions. She befriended Static, another teenage superhero from Dakota City. While it has been hinted that someday they might become more than friends, their relationship remained platonic throughout the run of their respective titles. DC Universe Following the death of Darkseid (as chronicled in Final Crisis), the space- time continuum was torn asunder, threatening the existence of both the Dakotaverse and the mainstream DC universe. The being known as Dharma was able to use energies that he harnessed from Rift (upon that being's defeat in Worlds Collide) to merge the two universes, creating an entirely new continuity. Only Dharma, Icon and Superman are aware that Dakota and its inhabitants previously existed in a parallel universe.Justice League of America (vol. 2) #34 (June 2009) In the revised continuity, Rocket and the other Milestone characters have apparently always existed in the DC Universe.Justice League of America (vol. 2) #30 (February 2009) Rocket is still partnered with Icon, who appears to have an existing friendship with Superman and is exempt from prosecution at the hands of the Green Lantern Corps. Rocket makes her first DCU appearance in Justice League of America (vol. 2) #30, intervening at Icon's request when Batman, Zatanna, Firestorm, and Black Lightning attack several members of the Shadow Cabinet while on a mission in the city of Metropolis. Believing Raquel and the Shadow Cabinet agents have kidnapped former Justice League International member Kimiyo Hoshi (Dr. Light II), Batman immediately attempts to strike Rocket with a batarang, which she easily deflects with her powers. After berating Batman and informing him that Kimiyo is unharmed, Rocket accompanies the Shadow Cabinet Agents and JLA members to the Justice League Satellite, where they aid Icon, Hawkman, and the rest of the Shadow Cabinet and JLA members in a battle with the Shadow Thief. Once Shadow Thief is defeated, Rocket and the other Milestone heroes return home by use of the Shadowslide, with Raquel and Augustus presumably returning to Dakota. On her Twitter account, writer Gail Simone mentioned that she had planned on using Rocket at some point during her tenure on Wonder Woman, but was not allowed to.\\"Tried to use her in WW but wasn't allowed!\\" rt @ LindAp7618 @GailSimone Any chance of Rocket from Milestone showing up in BOP?https://twitter.com/Gailsimone 4:04 AM Apr 30th via web Rocket makes a cameo appearance in Justice League, speaking to Wonder Woman. Powers and abilities=Powers All of Rocket's superhuman powers derive from her inertia belt (see Equipment). By using her belt, she can manipulate kinetic energy, granting some super strength, and a kinetic force field. Skills Raquel Ervin is a voracious reader and a gifted writer. A former high school gymnast, she is very agile and has quick reflexes. Rocket is also a good hand- to-hand combatant due to her crime fighting experience as Icon's sidekick. Equipment All of Rocket's superhuman powers derive from the inertia winder installed in her belt buckle.Icon #2 This device is one of two from Icon's escape pod, the other is installed in Hardware's current suit of armor.Hardware #16 When activated, the inertia winder surrounds Rocket in an \\"inertia field\\", which absorbs, stores, and redirects any kinetic energy used against it.Icon #2 Rocket's inertia field is normally invisible to the human eye. The field glows purple when it absorbs or releases kinetic energy.Icon #2 The inertia field primarily serves as a force field that protects her from anything invested with kinetic energy: physical blows,Icon #2 bullets,Icon #2 falls,Icon #13 etc. The maximum amount of kinetic energy Rocket's inertia field can absorb and store is unknown. However, the field nearly reached its limit during Rocket's battle with Oblivion.Icon #26 Rocket's inertia field normally extends a few inches from her body,Icon #2 but she can expand the field to enclose much greater areas. She once used it to protect a small crowd of people without any loss of its durability.Icon #29 Rocket can release the field's stored energy, giving her a range of offensive abilities. She can strike with superhuman force by surrounding her fists with kinetic energy.Icon #2 By releasing all the energy in the inertia field, she can stagger powerful beings like Icon with a single blow.Icon #28 However, such a feat would leave Rocket defenseless so she prefers to throw less powerful punches. Furthermore, Rocket has moral qualms about using her full store of kinetic energy against normal human opponents. Rocket can also use kinetic energy to increase the force with which she hurls an object, turning it into a dangerous projectile.Icon #2 For example, she once hurled a bullet with enough force to rival a shot from a high-caliber rifle. This ability is limited to objects which she can lift and toss with her normal strength. By releasing her store kinetic energy in focus beams, Rocket can project powerful energy blasts from her hands.Icon #2 As with her kinetic punches, the force of these blasts depends on how much kinetic energy she uses. Recently, Rocket has learned how to use her inertia winder to surround a target within an \\"inertialess field\\".Icon #39 This field's kinetic energy nullifies the energy of anything trapped within down to the molecular level. As a result, Rocket can use the inertialess field to effectively immobilize her opponents. In fact, some opponents can fall unconscious in as much as the field prevents oxygen molecules from reaching their lungs. The inertialess field consumes enormous amounts of energy and collapses after a few seconds.Icon #39 Rocket can fly by releasing her inertia field's kinetic energy beneath her, launching her skyward. Initially, she was not very skilled with this ability and thus could only leap over great distances.Icon #24 However, after training from Darnice, Rocket can use her kinetic energy as a means of propulsion for genuine flight.Icon #24 Rocket is capable of flying through narrow corridors and performing complex aerial maneuvers.Icon #28 She can even hover in midair by releasing controlled bursts of kinetic energy beneath her.Icon #28 Rocket's inertia field has certain weaknesses due to its very nature. First, the field will not activate if a person or object exerts little kinetic energy against it. This makes Rocket vulnerable to stealth attacks, which rely on slower movements and minimal force.Icon #14 Second, the inertia field offers little protection against weapons based on non-kinetic energy like thermal (e.g., flamethrowers)Icon #23 or electrical (e.g., tasers).Icon #2 Finally, Rocket will begin to feel the force of attacks directed against the field if it is overloaded as occurred in her battle with Oblivion.Icon #26 In other media=Television Rocket appears in Young Justice, voiced by Kittie in \\"Usual Suspects\\", \\"Auld Acquaintance\\" and \\"Satisfaction\\", and by Denise Boutte in \\"Intervention\\". In the episode \\"Revelation\\", she and Icon are shown helping the Justice League fight off a massive plant creature created by the Injustice League. She reappears in the episode \\"Failsafe\\", working alongside Red Arrow, Zatanna, Garth and Tula as part of a resistance cell trying to stop an alien invasion. She later appears in \\"Misplaced,\\" saving a bus on the edge of a bridge. In \\"Agendas\\", Wonder Woman nominates Rocket for membership in the Justice League, a sentiment which is echoed by both Black Canary and Hawkwoman. However, Superman rejects this notion on the grounds that she is not old enough to join the League. In \\"Usual Suspects\\", Rocket joins the Team after Icon is inducted into the Justice League; at the end of the episode she learns that stopping worldwide threat level criminals is a normal day for the team. She helped the rest of the team defeat Vandal Savage and the mind controlled Justice League, notably taking down her mentor and incapacitating Wonder Woman. She displays an attraction to Aqualad, and kisses him at the end of \\"Auld Acquaintance\\". She appears in the second season, set five years after the events of \\"Auld Acquaintance\\". Now an adult, Rocket is shown as a member of the Justice League alongside her former teammate Zatanna. Later in the season, Rocket is engaged and throws a bridal shower to celebrate with most of the old and new female members of the League and the Team. In \\"Intervention\\", Rocket assists Zatanna form a containment field around Blue Beetle as part of a plot to break the Reach's control over him. She appears in Outsiders, two years after Invasion, as cameo in \\"Princes All\\" sitting next to Zatana. In \\"Triptych\\", Rocket prevents Brick from escaping. In \\"Home Fires\\", she and her son Amistad join Iris West's play date group. Video Games Rocket appears as a playable character in the video game Young Justice: Legacy, voiced by Cree Summer. Notes * Rocket held liberal views on economic and social issues, which resulted in her often clashing with her conservative partner, Icon. Under her influence, Icon eventually began re-evaluating his views. * W. E. B. Du Bois's The Souls of Black Folk was a major influence in shaping Rocket's liberal views. * Rocket is the first comic book superheroine who is a single teenage mother. The only other one is Mirage, a former member of the Teen Titans. Although Stephanie Brown, the former Batgirl and current Spoiler, gave birth at 15, she gave the child up for adoption.

In 2017 the organisation merged with RNIB with which it had been in a partnership since 2009. History Action for Blind People was founded in 1857 as the Surrey Association for the General Welfare of the Blind and later became the London Association for the Blind. The Association's main activities in the early days were teaching blind people to read and to learn practical trades. Opportunities and attitudes towards blind and partially sighted people have changed over the years, along with the nature and the scale of the Association's work. As a result, their title was changed to Action for Blind People in 1991. RNIB Group Action for Blind People formed a partnership with the Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) in April 2009 and became part of RNIB Group. This enabled both organisations to provide a unique combination of complementary strengths and expertise to help an ever-increasing number of people with sight loss. Working together in this way allows both organisations to share skills and deliver services in line with the UK Vision Strategy and RNIB Group Strategy. Organization Action had 17 regional teams across England and four Resource Centres. Action for Blind People operates a Mobile Sight Loss Information service that travels around the UK. Action for Blind People also runs four hotels, but in 2009, the hotels were rebranded as Vision Hotels. Action local teams are based in Birmingham, Bristol, Carlisle, Exeter, Leeds, Liverpool, Loughborough, Manchester, Middlesbrough, North London, Norwich, Preston, Salisbury, South London, Stafford, Stoke and Wallsend. Vision Hotels Action for Blind People originally ran the hotels under the Action for Blind People name, but in 2009, the hotels were rebranded as Vision Hotels. Vision Hotels are three AA 3 star hotels in South Devon, Somerset and Lake Windermere. The Cliffden Hotel is in Teignmouth, South Devon. The Lauriston Hotel, Weston-super-Mare, Somerset Windermere Manor, Windermere, Cumbria. The hotels were put up for sale in 2016, as the charity reportedly could not afford the upkeep of three hotels.

A Game of Hide and Seek was published again in 1986 by Virago Press and Penguin Books, with an introduction by Elizabeth Jane Howard.  Plot  The novel is set in England, with a time-frame divided between the inter-war years and the peace after 1945, and is focused on the characters of Harriet Claridge and Vesey Macmillan. The novel explores their relationship, its effect on those around them, as they seek each other's love for more than 25 years. The story starts in their childhood. Harriet is painfully inarticulate, while Vesey is defensive and irritating; yet they are drawn to one another. When Vesey attends Oxford, they are separated, but she cherishes his photograph and waits for him to write. But he doesn't, so Harriet marries Charles, a rather dull country solicitor, and have a daughter, while Vesey becomes an actor. Skipping ahead 15 years, nothing has changed greatly. The latter portion of the novel is concerned with the rather pitiful, often lovely, and completely ineffectual affair they embark on. Their intrigue could not possibly be less of a 'grand passion.' When it ends as the reader knows it must, the affair is not completed; it is just forced to stop. Reception In a 1951 book review in Kirkus Reviews the review summarized; \\"A shaded, subtle recording of lonely lives which find no real contact‚Äîor comfort‚Äîwith each other... the insights here are finedrawn, the conclusions inescapable. For her audience‚Äîwhich is established if selective.\\" In reviewing the 2009 reissue, Elizabeth Day of the Guardian wrote \\"Taylor's forte as an author is acute observation and the devastating precision of her understated prose. Her brilliance is particularly evident in this, her fifth novel, set in her familiar milieu of middle-class married couples whose unfulfilled lives are crisscrossed with unspoken tension and stifled ardour.\\" and it \\"showcases much of what makes Taylor a great novelist: piercing insight, a keen wit and a genuine sense of feeling for her characters.\\" Writing for The New Republic, Britt Peterson wrote \\"The ambiguous ending, Taylor‚Äôs best, like a perfect bubble that never bursts, is a moving refusal to render final judgment on any of the imperfect, well-meaning bumblers who make up the story.\\" References Category:1951 British novels Category:Novels by Elizabeth Taylor ","title":"A Game of Hide and Seek"},{"id":"1494278","text":"See also: 1928 in organized crime, other events of 1929, 1930 in organized crime and the list of 'years in Organized Crime'.

Bomberman Hero is more advanced in terms of gameplay, as well as having more levels, bosses, weapons, and character moves. However, it lacks multiplayer and therefore focuses on the single player action. This game was available on the Wii Virtual Console service. Story The story is similar to (and even could have been based upon) Star Wars; a princess steals a secret data disk from an evil empire, and she safely smuggles out the information through a robot, but is captured herself. Bomberman is training in his headquarters when news arrives about the princess being captured. Bomberman chases after the Garaden Empire to save the Princess, but the Empire eventually claims back the disks to rebuild their leader, Bagular, whose body was destroyed in Super Bomberman 3. At first Bomberman travels through four worlds; Planet Bomber, Primus Star, Kanatia Star, and Mazone Star. Each world has its respective boss from the Garaden Empire; Endol, Baruda, Bolban, and Natia and her pet robot Cronus. Within each world, there are three different areas with their own collection of stages. Towards the middle of a world Bomberman encounters Nitros, a mysterious recurring mini-boss similar to Bomberman. While on his adventure Bomberman encounters characters from past games such as Black Bomber and Louie. The basic plot for the first three worlds is that Bomberman chases after Princess Millian only to find that she has been transported to the next world. While on Mazone area three, Bomberman finds Princess Millian safe in a laboratory. She tells him to find the rest of the disks in the next few levels. After giving the disks to Princess Millian, she turns out to be Natia in disguise. Natia then sends the disks needed to rebuild Bagular to the Garaden base. After Bomberman battles Natia and Cronus, he sets out towards Garaden Star. Within Garaden Star Bomberman battles resurrected forms of the past bosses through the various stages. Midway through the world, Bomberman encounters Nitros for a final battle. After the battle, Nitros snaps out of his brain-washed state, explains himself to Bomberman, shares his power with Bomberman, and then tells him to defeat Bagular for him. At the end of the world, Bomberman encounters the recently resurrected Bagular and engages him in a lengthy final battle. As a final act of desperation, Bagular self- destructs Garaden Star in an attempt to kill Bomberman. The story seems to end here with the destruction of the Garaden Empire and the credits. However, if a perfect score is achieved on every level and all the Adok bombs are collected, a new cut-scene takes place after the destruction of Garaden Star. A mysterious figure says \\"Bagular you fool, you lost again!\\" and suddenly the final world Gossick Star appears. At the end of the second level, Bomberman ascends an elevator to the final battle. There he battles Evil Bomber, possibly the real mastermind of the operation. After defeating Evil Bomber, Bomberman flies away in a ship with Princess Millian and the credits run. Gameplay Bomberman Hero controls very differently from Bomberman 64. In Hero, the character can jump, has a life meter, faces tougher bosses, and has the ability to throw bombs farther, thus, making Hero a more platform-oriented experience. There are several different areas to be encountered, each with about five different stages. A unique feature is that it's possible to play with an extra advancement, such as a jet pack or a submarine. There are also several different types of bombs in addition to the regular ones. Ice bombs turn enemies into a block of ice which can be moved around and used to jump on to get to higher places. Salt bombs only harm slugs, which are invulnerable to all other weapons. Control bombs explode when remotely detonated; a useful ability against certain bosses. Much of the game's replay value is in the sub- mission of scoring the number of target points per stage, which awards Bomberman a certain number of stage points (1 through 5) at the end of each level. You can re-enter the stages as often as you like, in order to secure the highest possible score within the stage. Medals are awarded on a per- planet basis, awarded based on the total number of stage points at the planet's completion (red, blue, bronze, silver, and gold). Getting a perfect score on every planet (or rather, a gold medal on each one) will award mini- games to be accessed on the options screen. The games include: *Slide Racer: Play through the Crystal Hole level on the Bomber Slider, racing against a snow-man. Beat him and get the record time to win. *Golden Bomber: Bomberman gets the Golden Chip, which allows him to travel underwater with ease. Traverse through three stages to beat the Boss of the Woods. *Treasure Hunt: Princess Millian's ship, which was full of treasure taken from Bagular's base, was shot down at the treasures were scattered all over the six planets. Find them all. Reception Bomberman Hero received generally mixed reviews from critics and fans alike, though the soundtrack was met with significant praise. GameSpot said, \\"Despite the uninspired plotline, Bomberman Hero is a rather surprising success. In a departure from Bomberman 64, Bomberman Hero boasts a number of new gameplay features that make this a completely new Bomberman game.\\" In a mixed review, IGN heavily criticized the lack of multiplayer mode, stating, \\"Nintendo and Hudson serve up a decidedly average 3D Bomberman sequel -- without a multiplayer mode.\\" Edge criticized the graphics for featuring intrusive distance fog and the same texture pattern, which make it difficult for the player to judge depth. However, the magazine concluded that, as a Japanese platformer, the game should not be overlooked, and favorably compared its rewarding exploration with that of Yoshi's Island. The game has since been recognized for its unique use of jungle and drum 'n' bass style music, by long-time Bomberman series music producer, Jun Chikuma.

He headed this company and its predecessor from 1899 until 1906, thereby helping to create one of the most successful nameplates in United States motor vehicle history. Biography Buick was born in Arbroath, Angus, Scotland and moved to Detroit at the age of two with his family. He left school in 1869 and worked for a company which made plumbing goods. When the company ran into trouble in 1882, he and a partner took it over. At this time Buick began to show his promise as an inventor, producing many innovations including a lawn sprinkler, and a method for permanently coating cast iron with vitreous enamel which allowed the production of \\"white\\" baths at lower cost. Although cast iron baths are uncommon nowadays, the method is still in use for enameling them. With the combination of Buick's innovation and his partner's sound business management the company became quite successful. Buick Motor Company During the 1890s, Buick developed an interest in internal combustion engines and began experimenting with them. He was spending little time on the plumbing business, and his business partner became impatient with him. The partnership was dissolved and the company was sold. Buick now had the time and capital to work on engines full-time, and he set up a new company, the Buick Auto-Vim and Power Company, in 1899 to do so. The stated aim of the company was to market engines for agricultural use. Buick soon turned to the development of a complete car, rather than just an engine. He also concentrated on research and development at the expense of manufacturing and sales. The result was that he consumed his capital by early 1902 without having generated any significant return, only a single car. In early 1902, he established the Buick Manufacturing Company, with the objectives of marketing engines to other car companies, and manufacturing and selling its own cars. Manufacturing and development problems ensued, and, at the end of 1902, Buick was out of money with only one car to show for his work. The concentration on development had produced the revolutionary \\"Valve- in-Head\\" overhead valve engine. This method of engine construction produces a much more powerful engine than the rival side valve engine design used by all other manufacturers at the time. Overhead valve engines are used by most car manufacturers today, but now only GM and Chrysler produce the \\"push-rod\\" variant with any regularity. Since overhead cam engines are design variants of OHV engines, it is fair to classify virtually all modern engines as derivatives of Buick's invention. The money ran out again, and in 1903 Buick was forced to raise more money via a $5,000 loan (equal to $ today) from a friend and fellow car enthusiast, Benjamin Briscoe. With this financial help, Buick formed the Buick Motor Company which would eventually become the cornerstone of the General Motors empire. Later life and business failure In 1906, Buick accepted a severance package and left the company that he had founded, with only one share of the company in his possession. Then president of Buick, William C. Durant, bought this share from him for $100,000, equal to $ today. After unsuccessful investments in California oil and Florida land, and an attempt (with his son Tom) to manufacture carburetors, Buick made a brief return to the automotive business in 1921, as president of the short-lived Lorraine Motors, and in 1923 with the design of the Dunbar, an automobile prototype. In an interview with historian Bruce Catton in 1928, Buick admitted that he was almost completely broke, unable to even afford a telephone, and worked as an instructor at the Detroit School of Trades. The following year, he died from colon cancer on March 5, 1929 at the age of 74, and was buried at Woodmere Cemetery in Detroit, Michigan. Commentator Theodore F. McManus noted that \\"Fame beckoned to David Buick. He sipped from the cup of greatness, and then spilled what it held.\\" In 2000, automotive historian Vincent Curcio observed that \\"To date, over 35,000,000 motor cars have been built in his name, which will never be lost to history.\\" He was inducted into the Automotive Hall of Fame in 1974.

The church was designated a New York City landmark in 1966, and the cathedral complex was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1977. It was declared a minor basilica by Pope Benedict XVI on Saint Patrick's Day, March 17, 2010.  History  St. Patrick's Cathedral before the reconstruction of 1840 The first Roman Catholic church in New York City was St. Peter's on Barclay Street, the cornerstone of which was laid in 1785.Brown, Mary Elizabeth and Osborne, Ernest L. \\"St. Peter's Church [Roman Catholic]\\" in , p. 1142 By the early 19th century, the Jesuit rector of that church, Anthony Kohlmann, realized that the city's growing Catholic population needed both a second sanctuary and a cathedral for the first bishop, since the city had been made a see in 1808.Burrows & Wallace, pp. 480‚Äì481 The site he selected for the new church was being used as a cemetery for St. Peter's, and was well outside the settled area of the city, surrounded by farmland and the country houses of the rich. The architect chosen was Joseph-Francois Mangin, who had co-designed New York's City Hall with John McComb Jr.,NYCLPC, p. 28 construction on which was ongoing when the cornerstone of St. Patrick's was laid on June 8, 1809. Construction took just under five years, with the sanctuary being dedicated on May 14, 1815. In that same year, John Connolly, an Irish Dominican friar, arrived to take office as the city's first resident bishop. The church, which was the largest in the city at the time it was built, now measures 120 by 80 feet and the inner vault is 85 feet high (37m x 24m x 26m). Until 1830 the cathedral was the ending place of New York's annual St. Patrick's Day parade. After that, it ended further south along Mott Street at the Church of the Transfiguration, whose pastor, Felix Varela, was a Spanish political refugee from Cuba. In New York, he served as the chaplain of the Hibernian Universal Benevolent Society.Burrows & Wallace, pp. 543‚Äì546 Eventually, the parade moved uptown to pass in front of the new St. Patrick's Cathedral (1879). In 1836, the original cathedral was the subject of an attempted sack after tensions between Irish Catholics and anti-Catholic Know-Nothing nativists led to a number of riots and other physical confrontations. The situation worsened when a brain-injured young woman, Maria Monk, wrote a book telling her \\"true\\" story - a Protestant girl who converted to Catholicism, and was then allegedly forced by nuns to have sex with priests, with the resulting children being baptized then killed horribly. Despite the book being debunked by a mildly anti-Catholic magazine editor, nativist anger at the story resulted in a decision to attack the cathedral. Loopholes were cut in the church's outer walls, which had just recently been built, and the building was defended from the rioters with muskets. Afterwards, the Ancient Order of Hibernians established its headquarters across the street from the church. Thirty years later, in 1866, the cathedral was gutted by a fire that spread from a nearby shop, and even though the new St. Patrick's was already under construction, the old cathedral was restored under the direction of architect Henry Engelbert and reopened in 1868. Since 1879, St. Patrick's Old Cathedral has been a parish church, the pastor residing in the old Bishop's House at 263 Mulberry Street. Today's multi-ethnic parish includes the territory of the former Most Holy Crucifix Parish, whose church for a time was the nearby Chapel of San Lorenzo Ruiz and housed the Filipino Catholic Apostolate for the Archdiocese of New York. Cathedral complex St. Patrick's Old Cathedral School at 32 Prince Street, across from the Cathedral, predates the church itself. It was built in 1825‚Äì1826 as the Roman Catholic Orphan Asylum, operated by the Sisters of Charity. In 1851, the asylum became for girls only, and in 1886 became St. Patrick's Convent and Girls School, before turning co-educational again. The Federal-style building is a New York City landmark, designated in 1966.NYCLPC, p. 42 The school finally closed in 2010 as enrollment dwindled, and the building was converted into residential and office space. In 1859, a \\"Gingerbread Gothic\\" Chancery Office Building was built at 266 Mulberry Street, just north of the sanctuary, designed by James Renwick Jr. and William Rodrigue, who would go on to design the new cathedral.NYCLPC, p. 43 The building would later become St. Michael's Chapel and, since 1936, St. Michael's Russian Catholic Church of the Byzantine Rite;Stmichaelruscath.org the liturgy is said and sung in Old Church Slavonic, Russian, and English. St. Michael's is the last Russian Catholic church in New York City and one of only four remaining such sanctuaries in the United States.Stmichaelruscath.org Underneath the basilica are catacombs which currently consist of 35 family crypts and 5 clerical vaults, and which have reopened to new interments. The basilica has also opened the catacombs to walking tours led by \\"Tommy's New York\\".http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2017/07/31/saint-patrick-s-old- cathedral-opens-its-centuries-old-catacombs-to-the-public.html Among the notable interments are the first resident Bishop of New York John Connolly, General Thomas Eckert, several members of the Delmonico restaurant family, Countess Annie Leary, and Congressman John Kelly.https://ny.curbed.com/2016/8/22/12583592/soho-st-patricks-old-cathedral- crypt-for-sale In addition, two New Yorkers who are currently on the road to sainthood, Pierre Toussaint and Father Isaac Hecker, were originally interred there before being moved; Toussaint to the new St. Patrick's Cathedral, and Hecker to St. Paul the Apostle Church. The founding mother superior of New York's first Sisters of Mercy convent, Mary Agnes O'Connor, is also buried there. Old St. Patrick's Cathedral gallery holds a large pipe organ that was built in 1868 by Henry Erben, originally operated without any use of electricity. After the new cathedral opened uptown in 1879, the Erben organ was left downtown with minimal alterations. In 2004, the Organ Historical Society designated it as an instrument of \\"exceptional historical merit, worthy of preservation\\", the organ equivalent of national landmark status. The instrument remains in use for Sunday services while awaiting further restoration.

In 1751, during a trip to England, he was summoned by hetman Kirill Razumovsky to decorate his residences in Ukraine. To this early period belong the Resurrection cathedral in Pochep near Bryansk and the Catherine Cathedral in Yamburg, now Kingisepp near St Petersburg (illustrated, right), where Rinaldi successfully expressed the domed, centrally-planned form required by traditional Russian Orthodox practice in a confident Italian Late Baroque vocabulary. His first important secular commission was the Novoznamenka chateau of Chancellor Woronzow. In 1754, he was appointed chief architect of the young court, i.e., the future Peter III and Catherine II, who resided at Oranienbaum. In that town he executed his best-known baroque designs: the Palace of Peter III (1758‚Äì60), the sumptuously decorated Chinese Palace (1762‚Äì68), and the Ice-Sliding Pavilion (1762‚Äì74). In the 1770s, Rinaldi served as the main architect of Count Orlov, who was Catherine's prime favourite and the most powerful man in the country. During this period he built two grandiose Neoclassical residences, namely the Marble Palace on the Palace Embankment in St Petersburg and the roomy Gatchina Castle, which was subsequently acquired for Emperor Paul and partly remodeled. He also designed for Orlov several monuments in Tsarskoe Selo, notably the Orlov Gates, Kagul Obelisk and the Chesma Column. He completed the work started by Jean-Baptiste Vallin de la Mothe on the Catholic Church of St. Catherine. Rinaldi's last works represent a continuous transition from the dazzling rococo of interiors to the reserved and clear-cut treatment of facades characteristic of Neoclassicism. These include two St Petersburg cathedrals, one dedicated to St Isaac the Dalmatian and subsequently demolished to make way for the present Empire-style structure, and the other, dedicated to Prince Vladimir and still standing.

They illegally trespassed onto the General Electric Nuclear Missile facility in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, where they damaged nuclear warhead nose cones and poured blood onto documents and files. They were arrested and charged with over ten different felony and misdemeanor counts. The Plowshares movement is an anti-nuclear weapons and Christian pacifist movement that advocates active resistance to war. The group often practices a form of symbolic protest that involves the damaging of weapons and military property. The movement gained notoriety in the early 1980s when several members damaged nuclear warhead nose cones and were subsequently convicted. The name refers to the text of prophet Isaiah who said that swords shall be beaten into plowshares. History The U.S. Plowshares group was deeply influenced by Roman Catholicism and, in particular, the Catholic left movement of the late 1960s and the Catholic Worker Movement.McKanan, D. (2011) Religion and war resistance in the Plowshares Movement. Journal of the American Academy of Religion, 79(2), 544‚Äì547. The Plowshares movement takes its name from the idea of beating swords to ploughshares in the Book of Isaiah: On September 9, 1980, Daniel Berrigan, his brother Philip Berrigan, and six others (the \\"Plowshares Eight\\") began the Plowshares Movement under the premise of beating swords to ploughshares. They trespassed onto the General Electric Re-entry Division in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, where Mark 12A reentry vehicles for the Minuteman III missile were made. They hammered on two reentry vehicles, poured blood on documents, and offered prayers for peace. They were arrested and charged with more than ten different felony and misdemeanor counts.Commonwealth v. Berrigan, 501 A.2d 266, 509 Pa. 118 (1985) On April 10, 1990, after 10 years of appeals, the Berrigans' group was re-sentenced and paroled for up to 23 and 1/2 months in consideration of time already served in prison. Their legal battle was re-created in Emile de Antonio's 1982 film In the King of Prussia,In the King of Prussia review by Time Out which starred Martin Sheen and featured appearances by the Plowshares Eight as themselves. Church Committee Report Book III Actions Other actions followed. As of 2000, some 71 such actions happened on several continents. There have been several more such actions since 2000. The vast majority end in prison time for the actors, the longest of which were those meted out to the 1984 group, the Silo Pruning Hooks, two of which were sentenced to 18 years in federal prison for entering a Minuteman II missile silo. Pouring of blood Pouring of blood is a controversial symbolic act that has been traditionally conducted by Plowshares activists. Recent actions On April 30, 2008, three Plowshares activists entered the GCSB Waihopai base near Blenheim, New Zealand and punctured an inflated radome used in the ECHELON signal interception program, causing $1.2 million in damages. In March 2010 the three men stood trial by jury at the District Court in Wellington and were acquitted. The New Zealand Attorney-General then lodged a civil claim, on behalf of the GCSB, for $1.2 million. This claim was dropped in February 2014. On November 2, 2009, a Plowshares action took place in the U.S. at Naval Base Kitsap-Bangor, where Trident nuclear weapons are stored or deployed on Trident submarines. These weapons constitute the largest stockpile of nuclear weapons in the US. On July 28, 2012, three Plowshares activists, Sister Megan Rice, 82, Greg Boertje- Obed, 57, and Michael Walli, 63, who compose the Transform Now Plowshares movement, breached security at the U.S. Department of Energy's Y-12 National Security Complex in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, causing the government to temporarily shut down the weapons facility. Once inside a \\"secure\\" area, the activists hung protest banners on a uranium storage site, poured human blood and spray-painted the walls with anti-war slogans. Following a controversial trial, the three activists were convicted in early May 2013 on the charges of damaging property in violation of 18 US Code 1363, damaging federal property in excess of $1000 in violation of 18 US Code 1361, and intending to injure, interfere with, or obstruct the national defense of the United States and willful damage of national security premises in violation of 18 US Code 2155. Megan Rice was sentenced to 35 months, or just under three years. The other two protesters, Greg Boertje-Obed and Michael Walli, both were sentenced to 62 months, or a little more than five years. The National Nuclear Security Administration has acknowledged the seriousness of the 2012 Plowshares action, which involved the protesters walking into a high-security zone of the plant, calling the security breach \\"unprecedented.\\" Independent security contractor, WSI, has since had a weeklong \\"security stand-down,\\" a halt to weapons production, and mandatory refresher training for all security staff. Non- proliferation policy experts are concerned about the relative ease with which these unarmed, unsophisticated protesters could cut through a fence and walk into the center of the facility. This is further evidence that nuclear security‚Äîthe securing of highly enriched uranium and plutonium‚Äîshould be a top priority to prevent terrorist groups from acquiring nuclear bomb-making material. These experts have questioned \\"the use of private contractors to provide security at facilities that manufacture and store the government's most dangerous military material\\". On April 4, 2018, seven Plowshares activists calling themselves \\"Kings Bay Plowshares\\" were arrested at the Kings Bay Naval Submarine Base. They stated that the action had been planned to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the Assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. The activists were arrested, handed over to local authorities, and taken to the county jail. The Kings Bay spokesman, Scott Bennett, said that no one had been threatened and no military personnel or assets were endangered. The base houses 8 Ohio-class submarines, 6 of which carry ballistic missiles and are described by the Navy as \\"designed specifically for stealth and the precise delivery of nuclear warheads.\\" The seven Plowshares were found guilty on October 24, 2019. Liz McAlister was sentenced to time served, 3 years of supervised probation and a portion of the $33,000 restitution. The other defendants remain to be sentenced. Sentencing guidelines suggest 8 to 33 months of incarceration and/or conditional probation, although they face potentially more than 20 years.

Born and raised in Detroit, Michigan, Street was the first member of the Temptations to actually be a native of the city which served as Motown's namesake and hometown; all of the previous members were born and at least partially raised in the southern United States. Career=Otis Williams and the Distants Street was the lead singer of an early Temptations predecessor, Otis Williams & the Distants, and takes the spotlight on their local hit \\"Come On\\". The Distants also included future Temptations Otis Williams, Melvin Franklin who was Street's cousin, and Elbridge \\"Al\\" Bryant, who left The Distants and their record deal with Johnnie Mae Matthews' Northern Records to form The Elgins (later The Temptations) with Eddie Kendricks and Paul Williams. After their departure, Matthews had Street briefly lead a new Distants group in the early 1960s. The Monitors During the mid-1960s, Street performed with a Motown act called The Monitors, who had only one minor hit, 1966's \\"Greetings (This is Uncle Sam)\\", to its name. They also had a smaller hit in 1965 by the name of \\"Say You\\", which The Temptations originally recorded for their Gettin' Ready album. The Temptations Street knew the Temptations and Otis Williams, in particular, having worked for Motown in quality control and through his vocal work with the Distants and the Monitors. By the late-1960s, Street was being called upon to travel with The Temptations and sing Paul Williams' parts from off-stage, while Paul Williams, who suffered from both alcoholism and sickle-cell disease, danced and lip-synched onstage. Street officially replaced Paul Williams in mid-1971, after both he and Eddie Kendricks left the group. A number of the Temptations' best-selling hits feature Street's lead vocals, including \\"Superstar (Remember How You Got Where You Are)\\" (1971), \\"Papa Was a Rollin' Stone\\" (1972), \\"Masterpiece\\" (1973), and was featured solo on \\"Hey Girl (I Like Your Style)\\" (1973) as well as the album cuts \\"The First Time I Saw Your Face\\" and \\"Firefly\\" from the All Directions (1972) and A Song for You albums (1975), respectively. Street and Damon Harris traded leads on \\"1990\\"s tune \\"Heavenly.\\" He and old Distants bandmates Otis Williams and Melvin Franklin endured a number of lineup changes over the two decades Street was a Temptation, during which time Dennis Edwards, Ricky Owens, Damon Harris, Glenn Leonard, Louis Price, Ron Tyson, and Ali-Ollie Woodson all served as members of the group at various times. In 1998, NBC aired The Temptations, a four-hour television miniseries based upon an autobiographical book by Otis Williams. Street was portrayed by actor J. August Richards. Street was featured on the following Temptations songs: (List not complete) Departure from The Temptations According to Street's own website, he left the group after the \\"family feeling\\" of the Temptations deteriorated. In 1993, Street entered the hospital to have seventeen kidney stones removed. Group leader Otis Williams was not informed of Street's condition, and angrily called Street, demanding to know why he missed his last performance. Street felt that Williams seemed to show a lack of concern, and decided to move on. Solo work Street continued to tour and perform as a solo artist. At times, he performed as a duo with former Temptations bandmate Damon Harris, who had joined the group at about the same time he did. Street was also a regular guest host with Tim Marshall and Larry Cotton on R&B; Showcase Radio Show airing on WBZC FM in South Jersey. He was honored with a New Jersey State Senate Proclamation on May 11, 2002, for his charitable works at a Mount Laurel, NJ benefit for Cancer. The event was presented by R&B; Showcase Magazine. Entertainers including Ms. Marilyn Marshall and MTV's \\"Making The Band\\" finalists LMNT paid tribute to Richard Street. Personal life Street was formerly married to The Velvelettes' lead singer Carolyn \\"Cal\\" Gill from 1969 to 1983. They have one son, Richard, Jr. Street. He also has three children from additional relationships: Brandi Chapman, Januari Street, and Brandon Street. Richard Street was married to Cynthia Ramirez Street when he died. They were married for 7 years. At the time of his death, Street was completing his autobiography, Ball of Confusion (referring to the Temptations song \\"Ball of Confusion (That's What the World is Today)\\", which Street did not appear on as he joined The Temptations in 1971, the year after it was released). Completed by his co-author, Gary Flanigan, Ball of Confusion: My Life as a Temptin' Temptation was published in 2014. It is the second autobiographical account of The Temptations, the first being Otis Williams' Temptations book from 1988. Death Richard Street died on February 27, 2013 in Las Vegas, Nevada of a pulmonary embolism. His death occurred nine days after fellow former Temptation Damon Harris's death. A public viewing was held in the evening March 15 at the church at Forest Lawn in Cypress California. Funeral services were held the next day at Forest Lawn.

Early life Van Rensselaer as a young man Henry Van Rensselaer was born at the manor house in Albany, New York. His father was Stephen Van Rensselaer III, the patroon of the Manor of Rensselaerswyck, who was also a United States Representative and founder of the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. The Van Rensselaers belong to the King family of Massachusetts and New York City. His mother, Cornelia Paterson, was the daughter of William Paterson, who served as Governor of New Jersey and an Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court. He graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York in 1831. Career He was appointed a brevet Second Lieutenant of the Fifth Regiment, United States Infantry on July 1, 1831, and resigned January 27, 1832. He then engaged in agricultural pursuits near Ogdensburg, New York, and served as a military aide to Governor William H. Seward from 1839 to 1840. Upon his father's death in 1839, Van Rensselaer, as the fifth son, inherited the wild lands in St. Lawrence County along the St. Lawrence River. His eldest brother, Stephen Van Rensselaer IV inherited the manor on the Albany side of the Hudson River.

Film critic Roger Ebert, an early supporter, said $400,000 more was eventually spent by the distributor on sound, print, score and music/clip clearances to bring the film to theaters.\\"Documentary makers rally for fair use\\", Tiscali. \\"Citing dozens of examples, they contend, for instance, that the budget of Jonathan Caouette's homemade 2004 documentary 'Tarnation' ballooned from $218 to $400,000, 'using most of the eventual budget to clear rights.'\\" The film went on to win the Best Documentary Award from the National Society of Film Critics,Sean McConville and Anna Bryson also was nominated for the Independent Spirits, the Gotham Awards, as well as the L.A. and London International Film Festivals.Jane L. Chapman Content Tarnation is an autobiographical documentary focusing on Caouette's early life and adulthood, as well as his mother, Renee LeBlanc, who was treated with electroshock in her youth. With an absent father and a mother who struggled with mental illness, Caouette eventually settled in the Houston area with his grandparents, Adolph and Rosemary Davis, who despite personality quirks provided a supportive family for him. The film explores Caouette's life as he negotiates his complicated relationship with his mother as her child, friend and ultimately, parental figure while developing his creativity as an actor, writer and director. Caouette came out as gay at a young age and moved to New York City at age 25, eventually finding a boyfriend named David Sanin Paz. They both live in New York City today. As documented in the film, his mother has lived with them at times and they've formed an unusual family. A scene early in the movie has an approximately 11-year-old Caouette improvising a monologue as a woman in an abusive relationship. Soundtrack The soundtrack uses songs by Hex (Donnette Thayer and Steve Kilbey), Lisa Germano, The Cocteau Twins, Dolly Parton, Low, Mark Kozelek, Glen Campbell, The Magnetic Fields, Iron and Wine, The Chocolate Watch Band, Mavis Staples, Red House Painters, Marianne Faithfull and many more. Orchestral cues for the film were composed by John Califra. Max Avery Lichtenstein wrote several original instrumental songs for the film, including the film's recurring theme \\"Tarnation\\". The film's trailer features orchestral music by John Califra, \\"Tarnation\\" by Max Avery Lichtenstein, and the song \\"Safe As Milk\\" by the band Hopewell. No soundtrack compilation album has been released, but a digital E.P. featuring selections of Max Avery Lichtenstein's original music for the film was released in 2005 by Tin Drum Recordings. History Caouette was shaping his material when he sent in an audition tape for John Cameron Mitchell's Shortbus. The tape contained the footage of an 11-year-old Jonathan imitating a battered wife. Mitchell was impressed and encouraged him to continue working on the film. He alerted Stephen Winter, then the artistic director of MIX NYC, the New York Lesbian & Gay Experimental Film Festival. Stephen became the producer of Tarnation. A tape found its way to Mitchell's friend, Gus Van Sant, who was also deeply moved by the film. Both he and Mitchell signed on as executive producers. The November 2003 world premiere of the movie at MIX was much more abstract in nature, running about two hours. With input from Mitchell, Winter, and co-editor Brian A. Kates, Caouette shot new footage and edited the film down to about 90 minutes for its screening at the 2004 Sundance Film Festival in the Frontier Section. There it was invited to appear in the 2004 Cannes Film Festival Directors' Fortnight. The filmmakers didn't have the $30,000 to make a film print for the festival but at the last minute respected art house distributor Wellspring picked it up and brought it to Cannes where it garnered great critical acclaim and worldwide distribution. Caouette's next completed film in 2007 was All Tomorrow's Parties. Walk Away Renee, Jonathan's companion film to Tarnation, examines a certain later period involving the filmmaker and his mother. It premiered at Cannes in 2011, and was released internationally in May 2012. In June 2020 it was announced that indie distributor Hope Runs High had picked up Tarnation and was giving the film its streaming premiere on the Criterion Collection's Criterion Channel. https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/6963-the-criterion- channel-s-june-2020-lineuphttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gz74_hpl9bU&t;=5s ReferencesExternal links *Jonathan Caouette's Blog (about himself and Tarnation)  * *BBC website article about the screening at the Cannes Festival *Tarnation on MUBI Category:2003 films Category:2003 documentary films Category:American documentary films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:Documentary films about LGBT topics Category:American teen LGBT-related films Category:Collage film Category:Documentary films about mental health Category:Autobiographical documentary films Category:Films directed by Jonathan Caouette Category:Films shot in Houston Category:Films shot in New York City Category:Films shot in Portland, Oregon Category:2003 directorial debut films ","title":"Tarnation (2003 film)"},{"id":"1494406","text":"Very Nice, Very Nice is a Canadian avant-garde collage film made by Arthur Lipsett in 1961, and produced by the National Film Board of Canada.

Education and early career Keeler studied applied mathematics at Harvard University, graduating summa cum laude in 1983. He then gained a master's degree from Stanford in electrical engineering before returning to Harvard. He earned a PhD in applied mathematics from Harvard in 1990. His doctoral thesis was \\"Map Representations and Optimal Encoding for Image Segmentation\\". After earning his doctorate, Keeler joined the Performance Analysis Department at AT&T; Bell Laboratories. Career He soon left Bell Labs to write for David Letterman and subsequently for various sitcoms, including several episodes of Wings, The Simpsons, Futurama, and The Critic, as well as the short-lived Fox claymation show The PJs. For The Simpsons, Keeler has written such episodes as \\"A Star Is Burns\\" (which Matt Groening refused to be credited for, as he was opposed to the idea of The Simpsons crossing over with The Critic) and \\"The Principal and the Pauper\\" (which many fans ‚Äì including series creator Matt Groening and voice actor Harry Shearer ‚Äì disliked due to the massive changes in Principal Skinner's backstory). Keeler was instrumental in the creation of Futurama, and served as a co-executive producer in its first three years, and as an executive producer in its fourth year. He was one of the show's most prolific writers, with fourteen episodes to his name (including the original series finale, \\"The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings\\", the Writers Guild Award- winning episodes \\"Godfellas\\" and \\"The Prisoner of Benda,\\" and the series finale \\"Meanwhile\\").

It stars Bugs Bunny and Cecil Turtle. Bob Clampett took Tex Avery's scenario from Tortoise Beats Hare and altered it for this film. The title is an appropriate pun on \\"hair\\". This is one of the first shorts to feature Robert McKimson's design of Bugs Bunny. A newspaper's front page (the Chicago Sunday Tribunk) shown in this cartoon accurately predicts Adolf Hitler's suicide two years later. Plot Two years after the events in Tortoise Beats Hare, Bugs is watching footage of that cartoon, determined to learn how it was that Cecil managed to beat him (the cartoon seems to depict Cecil as having won fairly, rather than the truth, which was that the turtle engaged his cousins to cheat and help him win). Bugs then goes to Cecil's house disguised as an old man (a parody of Bill Thompson's \\"Old Timer\\" character from Fibber McGee and Molly) to ask about the turtle's secret for winning. Cecil is not the least bit fooled by the disguise, but goes along with the gag, claiming that his streamlined shell ensures his success; he produces a set of blueprints for his \\"air-flow chassis.\\" He also adds that, in contrast, the long ears of a rabbit only serve as \\"wind resistance\\", which slows the rabbit down. The turtle ends the conversation with the comment, \\"Oh, and another thing...Rabbits aren't very bright, either!\\" just before slamming the door in the enraged bunny's face. Not getting the hint that the turtle's story is a humbug, Bugs builds a shell of his own and prepares for the new race. Meanwhile, the bunny mob learns of the match-up, places all its bets on Bugs, and hints that \\"the toitle\\" will not even finish the race. Initially, Bugs takes the easy lead, after dressing up in his new chassis. The rabbit mob, mistaking Bugs for Cecil and, despite Bugs' insistence to the contrary, attack the rabbit. Cecil does not help Bugs' cause by dressing up in a rabbit suit. The rabbit mob fall for it and cheer Cecil as the real rabbit, causing the turtle to remark to the audience, \\"I told you rabbits aren't very bright.\\" Bugs still manages to regain the lead and nearly wins, until the mob stalls him right at the finish line, while other rabbits rush Cecil over the line and to victory. Bugs then bursts out crying, rips off his chassis and reveals that he was the real rabbit. In despair, the rabbit mob replies, \\"Ehhh, now he tells us,\\" and kill themselves with a single bullet through all their heads. Cast *Sara Berner as Mrs. Turtle *Mel Blanc as Bugs Bunny, Cecil Turtle, Narrators, Rabbit Bookie and Rabbit Thugs *Kent Rogers as Rabbit with Telescope Analysis The animated short contains wartime references. Bugs displays \\"A\\" and \\"C\\" ration cards. He claims he has a secret weapon. A Japanese cruiser is mentioned in a newspaper headline, as is the accurate prediction of Adolf Hitler's suicide two years later. A chorus of turtles sing \\"He did it before and he can do it again\\".Shull, Wilt (2004), p. 159 Nichola Dobson mentions the short as an example of both Bob Clampett's attention to detail and of the fast pace of his work.Dobson (2010), p. 44 The suicide gag at the end is normally edited out of television broadcasts, fading out just as the rabbits say, \\"NOW he tells us.\\" Availability *This short can be found (uncut and uncensored) on Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 1 and Looney Tunes Platinum Collection: Volume 2.

Van Rensselaer went on to serve in the Eighth, Ninth, Tenth, and Eleventh United States Congresses, serving until March 3, 1811. While in Congress, he was placed on the Ways and Means Committee. He was invited and dined at the White House with President Jefferson and President Madison, as well as at the residences of Col. John Tayloe, a close friend of George Washington, Count Fyodor Palen, the Plenipotentiary of the Czar of Russia to the United States, and Louis Marie Turreau, Napoleon's Ambassador to the United States. Afterwards, he returned to Claverack and resumed the practice of law. Personal life On January 27, 1791, Van Rensselaer married Margaretta \\"Margaret\\" Sanders (1764‚Äì1830), daughter of John Sanders (d. 1782) and Deborah Glen (d. 1786) of Scotia, and a cousin of his brother Philip's wife. Together they had five children, one of whom died in infancy: * John Sanders Van Rensselaer (1792‚Äì1868), who married Ann Dunkin (1795‚Äì1845) * William Van Rensselaer (1794‚Äì1855) * Deborah Van Rensselaer (1795‚Äì1796), who died in infancy * Richard Van Rensselaer (1797‚Äì1880), who married Elizabeth Van Rensselaer (d. 1835), and later Matilda Fonda Van Rensselaer (d. 1863) * Bernard Sanders Van Rensselaer (1801‚Äì1879), who married Elizabeth Hum (d. 1834), and later Mary Targee (d. 1858). They lived at 112 State Street, a home built for them in 1801, at the same time Philip S. Van Rensselaer, the Mayor, built his home on the corner of Chapel Street (which was later purchased by Erastus Corning). Van Rensselaer died on June 18, 1845 in Albany, New York, aged 82, and was interred in a private cemetery at East Greenbush. Descendants Killian's grandson was Charles van Rensselaer (1823‚Äì1857), the first officer on the SS Central America, when it was lost during a hurricane in September 1857.Loss of the Central America; September 21, 1857 New York Times article; Retrieved August 1, 2013.

By the extreme value theorem the GEV distribution is the only possible limit distribution of properly normalized maxima of a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables. Note that a limit distribution need to exist, which requires regularity conditions on the tail of the distribution. Despite this, the GEV distribution is often used as an approximation to model the maxima of long (finite) sequences of random variables. In some fields of application the generalized extreme value distribution is known as the Fisher‚ÄìTippett distribution, named after Ronald Fisher and L. H. C. Tippett who recognised three different forms outlined below. However usage of this name is sometimes restricted to mean the special case of the Gumbel distribution. The origin of the common functional form for all 3 distributions dates back to at least Jenkinson, A. F. (1955), though allegedly it could also have been given by Mises, R. (1936). Specification Using the standardized variable s = (x - \\\\mu)/\\\\sigma\\\\,, where \\\\mu\\\\,, the location parameter, can be any real number, and \\\\sigma > 0 is the scale parameter; the cumulative distribution function of the GEV distribution is then :F(s; \\\\xi) = \\\\begin{cases} \\\\exp\\\\Bigl(-\\\\exp(-s)\\\\Bigr) & ~~ \\\\text{ for } ~~ \\\\xi = 0 \\\\ {} \\\\ \\\\exp\\\\Bigl(-(1+\\\\xi s)^{-1/\\\\xi}\\\\Bigr) & ~~ \\\\text{ for } ~~ \\\\xi eq 0 ~~ \\\\text{ and } ~~ \\\\xi \\\\, s > -1 \\\\ {} \\\\ 0 & ~~ \\\\text{ for } ~~ \\\\xi > 0 ~~ \\\\text{ and } ~~ \\\\xi\\\\, s \\\\le -1 \\\\ {} \\\\ 1 & ~~ \\\\text{ for } ~~ \\\\xi < 0 ~~ \\\\text{ and } ~~ \\\\xi\\\\, s \\\\le -1 ~, \\\\end{cases} where \\\\xi\\\\,, the shape parameter, can be any real number. Thus for \\\\xi > 0, the expression is valid for s > -1/\\\\xi\\\\,, while for \\\\xi < 0 it is valid for s < -1/\\\\xi\\\\,. In the first case, -1/\\\\xi is the negative, lower end-point, where F is 0; in the second case, -1/\\\\xi is the positive, upper end-point, where F is 1. For \\\\xi = 0 the second expression is formally undefined and is replaced with the first expression, which is the result of taking the limit of the second, as \\\\xi \\\\to 0 in which case s can be any real number. In the special case of the mean x =\\\\mu\\\\,, so s = 0 and F(s; \\\\xi) = \\\\exp(-1) ‚âà 0.368 for whatever values \\\\xi and \\\\sigma might have. The probability density function of the standardized distribution is :f(s;\\\\xi) = \\\\begin{cases} \\\\exp(-s) \\\\exp\\\\Bigl(-\\\\exp(-s)\\\\Bigr) & ~~ \\\\text{ for } ~~ \\\\xi = 0 \\\\ {} \\\\ \\\\Bigl(1+\\\\xi s\\\\Bigr)^{-(1+1/\\\\xi)} \\\\exp\\\\Bigl(-(1+\\\\xi s)^{-1/\\\\xi}\\\\Bigr) & ~~ \\\\text{ for } ~~ \\\\xi eq 0 ~~ \\\\text{ and } ~~ \\\\xi \\\\, s > -1 \\\\ {} \\\\ 0 & ~~ \\\\text{ otherwise, } \\\\end{cases} again valid for s > -1/\\\\xi in the case \\\\xi > 0\\\\,, and for s < -1/\\\\xi in the case \\\\xi < 0\\\\,. The density is zero outside of the relevant range. In the case \\\\xi = 0 the density is positive on the whole real line. Since the cumulative distribution function is invertible, the quantile function for the GEV distribution has an explicit expression, namely :Q(p;\\\\mu,\\\\sigma,\\\\xi) = \\\\begin{cases} \\\\mu - \\\\sigma\\\\log\\\\Bigl(-\\\\log\\\\left(p\\\\right)\\\\,\\\\Bigr) & ~ \\\\text{ for } ~ \\\\xi = 0 ~ \\\\text{ and } ~ p \\\\in \\\\left(0,1\\\\right) \\\\ {} \\\\ \\\\mu + \\\\displaystyle{{\\\\,\\\\sigma\\\\,}\\\\over{\\\\,\\\\xi\\\\,}}\\\\left( \\\\Bigl(-\\\\log(p)\\\\,\\\\Bigr)^{-\\\\xi} - 1\\\\right) & ~ \\\\text{ for } ~ \\\\xi > 0 ~ \\\\text{ and } ~ p \\\\in \\\\left[0,1\\\\right) \\\\ {} & ~~ \\\\text{ or } ~ \\\\, \\\\xi < 0 ~ \\\\text{ and } ~ p \\\\in (0,1]\\\\;,\\\\end{cases} and therefore the quantile density function \\\\left(q \\\\equiv \\\\frac{\\\\;\\\\operatorname{d}Q\\\\;}{\\\\operatorname{d}p}\\\\right) is :q(p;\\\\sigma,\\\\xi) = \\\\frac{\\\\sigma}{\\\\;\\\\Bigl(-\\\\log\\\\left(p\\\\right)\\\\, \\\\Bigr)^{\\\\xi+1}\\\\, p\\\\,} \\\\quad \\\\text{ for } ~~ p \\\\in \\\\left(0,1\\\\right)\\\\;, valid for ~\\\\sigma > 0~ and for any real ~\\\\xi\\\\;. Example of probability density functions for distributions of the GEV family. Summary statistics Some simple statistics of the distribution are: :\\\\operatorname{E}(X) = \\\\mu + \\\\left(g_1-1\\\\right)\\\\frac{\\\\sigma}{\\\\xi} for \\\\xi < 1 :\\\\operatorname{Var}(X) = \\\\left(g_2-g_1^2\\\\right)\\\\frac{\\\\sigma^2}{\\\\xi^2} , :\\\\operatorname{Mode}(X) = \\\\mu+\\\\frac{\\\\sigma}{\\\\xi}[(1+\\\\xi)^{-\\\\xi}-1] . The skewness is for Œæ>0 :\\\\operatorname{skewness}(X) = \\\\frac{g_3-3g_2g_1+2g_1^3}{(g_2-g_1^2)^{3/2}} For Œæ<0, the sign of the numerator is reversed. The excess kurtosis is: :\\\\operatorname{kurtosis\\\\ excess}(X) = \\\\frac{g_4-4g_3g_1+6g_2g_1^2-3g_1^4}{(g_2-g_1^2)^{2}}-3 . where g_k=\\\\Gamma(1-k\\\\xi), k=1,2,3,4, and \\\\Gamma(t) is the gamma function. Link to Fr√©chet, Weibull and Gumbel families The shape parameter \\\\xi governs the tail behavior of the distribution. The sub-families defined by \\\\xi= 0, \\\\xi>0 and \\\\xi<0 correspond, respectively, to the Gumbel, Fr√©chet and Weibull families, whose cumulative distribution functions are displayed below. * Gumbel or type I extreme value distribution (\\\\xi=0) : F(x;\\\\mu,\\\\sigma,0)=e^{-e^{-(x-\\\\mu)/\\\\sigma}}\\\\;\\\\;\\\\; \\\\text{for} \\\\;\\\\; x\\\\in\\\\mathbb R. * Fr√©chet or type II extreme value distribution, if \\\\xi=\\\\alpha^{-1}>0 and y = 1 + \\\\xi (x-\\\\mu)/\\\\sigma : F(x;\\\\mu,\\\\sigma,\\\\xi)=\\\\begin{cases} e^{-y^{-\\\\alpha}} & y > 0 \\\\ 0 & y \\\\leq 0. \\\\end{cases} * Reversed Weibull or type III extreme value distribution, if \\\\xi=-\\\\alpha^{-1}<0 and y = - \\\\left( 1 + \\\\xi (x-\\\\mu)/\\\\sigma \\\\right) : F(x;\\\\mu,\\\\sigma,\\\\xi)=\\\\begin{cases} e^{-(-y)^{\\\\alpha}} & y<0 \\\\ 1 & y\\\\geq 0 \\\\end{cases} The subsections below remark on properties of these distributions. Modification for minima rather than maxima The theory here relates to data maxima and the distribution being discussed is an extreme value distribution for maxima. A generalised extreme value distribution for data minima can be obtained, for example by substituting (‚àíx) for x in the distribution function, and subtracting from one: this yields a separate family of distributions. Alternative convention for the Weibull distribution The ordinary Weibull distribution arises in reliability applications and is obtained from the distribution here by using the variable t = \\\\mu - x , which gives a strictly positive support - in contrast to the use in the extreme value theory here. This arises because the ordinary Weibull distribution is used in cases that deal with data minima rather than data maxima. The distribution here has an addition parameter compared to the usual form of the Weibull distribution and, in addition, is reversed so that the distribution has an upper bound rather than a lower bound. Importantly, in applications of the GEV, the upper bound is unknown and so must be estimated, while when applying the ordinary Weibull distribution in reliability applications the lower bound is usually known to be zero. Ranges of the distributions Note the differences in the ranges of interest for the three extreme value distributions: Gumbel is unlimited, Fr√©chet has a lower limit, while the reversed Weibull has an upper limit. More precisely, Extreme Value Theory (Univariate Theory) describes which of the three is the limiting law according to the initial law X and in particular depending on its tail. Distribution of log variables One can link the type I to types II and III the following way: if the cumulative distribution function of some random variable X is of type II, and with the positive numbers as support, i.e. F(x; 0, \\\\sigma, \\\\alpha), then the cumulative distribution function of \\\\ln X is of type I, namely F(x; \\\\ln \\\\sigma, 1/\\\\alpha, 0). Similarly, if the cumulative distribution function of X is of type III, and with the negative numbers as support, i.e. F(x; 0, \\\\sigma, -\\\\alpha), then the cumulative distribution function of \\\\ln (-X) is of type I, namely F(x; -\\\\ln \\\\sigma, 1/\\\\alpha, 0). Link to logit models (logistic regression) Multinomial logit models, and certain other types of logistic regression, can be phrased as latent variable models with error variables distributed as Gumbel distributions (type I generalized extreme value distributions). This phrasing is common in the theory of discrete choice models, which include logit models, probit models, and various extensions of them, and derives from the fact that the difference of two type-I GEV-distributed variables follows a logistic distribution, of which the logit function is the quantile function. The type-I GEV distribution thus plays the same role in these logit models as the normal distribution does in the corresponding probit models. Properties The cumulative distribution function of the generalized extreme value distribution solves the stability postulate equation. The generalized extreme value distribution is a special case of a max-stable distribution, and is a transformation of a min-stable distribution. Applications *The GEV distribution is widely used in the treatment of \\"tail risks\\" in fields ranging from insurance to finance. In the latter case, it has been considered as a means of assessing various financial risks via metrics such as Value at Risk.Moscadelli, Marco. \\"The modelling of operational risk: experience with the analysis of the data collected by the Basel Committee.\\" Available at SSRN 557214 (2004). Fitted GEV probability distribution to monthly maximum one-day rainfalls in October, SurinamCumFreq for probability distribution fitting *However, the resulting shape parameters have been found to lie in the range leading to undefined means and variances, which underlines the fact that reliable data analysis is often impossible.Kjersti Aas, lecture, NTNU, Trondheim, 23 Jan 2008 * In hydrology the GEV distribution is applied to extreme events such as annual maximum one-day rainfalls and river discharges. The blue picture, made with CumFreq, illustrates an example of fitting the GEV distribution to ranked annually maximum one-day rainfalls showing also the 90% confidence belt based on the binomial distribution. The rainfall data are represented by plotting positions as part of the cumulative frequency analysis. Example for Normally distributed variables Let (X_i)_{i\\\\in[n]} be iid. normally distributed random variables with mean 0 and variance 1. The Fisher‚ÄìTippett‚ÄìGnedenko theorem tells us that \\\\max_{i\\\\in[n]} X_i \\\\sim GEV(\\\\mu_n, \\\\sigma_n, 0), where \\\\begin{align} \\\\mu_n &= \\\\Phi^{-1}\\\\left(1-\\\\frac{1}{n} \\\\right) \\\\ \\\\sigma_n &= \\\\Phi^{-1}\\\\left(1-\\\\frac{1}{n} \\\\cdot \\\\mathrm{e}^{-1}\\\\right)- \\\\Phi^{-1}\\\\left(1-\\\\frac{1}{n} \\\\right) \\\\end{align} . This allow us to estimate e.g. the mean of \\\\max_{i\\\\in[n]} X_i from the mean of the GEV distribution: \\\\begin{align} E\\\\left[\\\\max_{i\\\\in[n]} X_i\\\\right] &\\\\approx \\\\mu_n+\\\\gamma\\\\sigma_n \\\\&=(1-\\\\gamma)\\\\Phi^{-1}(1-1/n)+\\\\gamma\\\\Phi^{-1}(1-1/(en)) \\\\&= \\\\sqrt{\\\\log \\\\left(\\\\frac{n^2}{2 \\\\pi \\\\log \\\\left(\\\\frac{n^2}{2\\\\pi} \\\\right)}\\\\right)} \\\\cdot \\\\left(1 + \\\\frac{\\\\gamma}{\\\\log (n)} + \\\\mathcal{o} \\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{\\\\log (n)} \\\\right) \\\\right) \\\\end{align} Related distributions # If X \\\\sim \\\\textrm{GEV}(\\\\mu,\\\\,\\\\sigma,\\\\,\\\\xi) then mX+b \\\\sim \\\\textrm{GEV}(m\\\\mu+b,\\\\,m\\\\sigma,\\\\,\\\\xi) # If X \\\\sim \\\\textrm{Gumbel}(\\\\mu,\\\\,\\\\sigma) (Gumbel distribution) then X \\\\sim \\\\textrm{GEV}(\\\\mu,\\\\,\\\\sigma,\\\\,0) # If X \\\\sim \\\\textrm{Weibull}(\\\\sigma,\\\\,\\\\mu) (Weibull distribution) then \\\\mu\\\\left(1-\\\\sigma\\\\mathrm{log}{\\\\tfrac{X}{\\\\sigma}}\\\\right) \\\\sim \\\\textrm{GEV}(\\\\mu,\\\\,\\\\sigma,\\\\,0) # If X \\\\sim \\\\textrm{GEV}(\\\\mu,\\\\,\\\\sigma,\\\\,0) then \\\\sigma \\\\exp (-\\\\tfrac{X-\\\\mu}{\\\\mu \\\\sigma} ) \\\\sim \\\\textrm{Weibull}(\\\\sigma,\\\\,\\\\mu) (Weibull distribution) # If X \\\\sim \\\\textrm{Exponential}(1)\\\\, (Exponential distribution) then \\\\mu - \\\\sigma \\\\log{X} \\\\sim \\\\textrm{GEV}(\\\\mu,\\\\,\\\\sigma,\\\\,0) # If X \\\\sim \\\\mathrm{Gumbel}(\\\\alpha_X, \\\\beta) and Y \\\\sim \\\\mathrm{Gumbel}(\\\\alpha_Y, \\\\beta) then X-Y \\\\sim \\\\mathrm{Logistic}(\\\\alpha_X-\\\\alpha_Y,\\\\beta) \\\\, (see Logistic_distribution). # If X and Y \\\\sim \\\\mathrm{Gumbel}(\\\\alpha, \\\\beta) then X+Y sim \\\\mathrm{Logistic}(2 \\\\alpha,\\\\beta) \\\\, (The sum is not a logistic distribution).

Life Hobsbaum was born into a Polish Jewish family in London, and brought up in Bradford, Yorkshire, where he attended Belle Vue Boys' Grammar School.Baker, William, \\"Hobsbawm, Philip Dennis (1932-2005)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2009; online edition, January 2009. Retrieved 22 May 2018 He read English at Downing College, Cambridge, where he was taught and heavily influenced by F. R. Leavis. At Cambridge he took over the editing of the magazine delta from Peter Redgrove. After Cambridge, he worked as a school teacher in London from 1955 to 1959, when he moved to Sheffield to study for a PhD under William Empson. In 1962 he took up an academic position at Queen's University, Belfast, and moved again in 1966, to take up a post in the University of Glasgow. He was awarded a personal chair in 1985, and retired from the University in 1997; he remained in Glasgow until his death in 2005. The Group(s) Hobsbaum's most direct impact on literature was as the animating force behind The Group, a sequence of writing workshops in Cambridge, London, Belfast and Glasgow, in turn. Although there was some slight overlap in personnel with The Movement, the various incarnations of the Group had a more concrete existence and a more practical focus. The Cambridge Group was initially concerned with the oral performance of poetry, but soon turned into an exercise in practical criticism and mutual support for a network of poets. This Group relocated to London when Hobsbaum moved there in 1955, becoming The Group, and continuing until 1965, chaired by Edward Lucie-Smith after Hobsbaum's departure for Sheffield. On arriving in Sheffield (c.1959-1962) he immediately organized the \\"Writers' Group\\" for the university's undergraduates and started \\"Poetry from Sheffield\\", a magazine for their poetry but which also had poems by George McBeth, Peter Redgrove and Francis Berry. He wrote about the group in The Times Literary Supplement, published on 14 April 1961. Barry Fox took over the chair when Hobsbaum left to concentrate on his thesis. In Belfast (1962-1966), Hobsbaum organised a new weekly discussion group, which became known as The Belfast Group and included the emerging authors John Bond, Seamus Heaney, Michael Longley, Derek Mahon, Stewart Parker and Bernard MacLaverty. In Glasgow, Hobsbaum became once again the nucleus of a group of new and distinctive authors, including Alasdair Gray, Liz Lochhead, James Kelman, Tom Leonard, Aonghas MacNeacail and Jeff Torrington. This group continued to meet until 1975, and unlike the previous groups developed a more pronounced focus on prose than on poetry. As an encore, Hobsbaum was instrumental in setting up, in 1995, the successful MLitt in Creative Writing at the University of Glasgow. Work Though he was a poet as well, it was as a critic that Hobsbaum was best known.

Relay valves are necessary in heavy trucks in order to speed-up rear-brake application and release, since air takes longer to travel to the rear of the vehicle than the front of the vehicle, where the front service brakes, foot-valve, parking-control valve, and trailer-supply valve (if applicable) are located. Without relay valves, it would take too long for sufficient air to travel from the brake pedal valve to the rear of the truck or trailer in order to apply the rear service brakes concurrently with the front service brakes, resulting in a condition known as brake lag. To correct this condition on a long-wheel-base vehicle, a relay valve is installed near the rear service brake chambers. In tractors as well as straight-trucks, a remote air-supply is provided in the form of a large diameter pipe connected between the primary reservoir and the relay valve for remote service brake application. In a truck‚Äôs air brake system, relay valves get a signal when a driver presses the treadle, which then opens the valve and allows air to enter the brake chamber via air inlet. The diaphragm gets pushed, then the rod, then the slack adjuster which twists to turn the brake camshaft. Next, it moves the disc, wedge or s-cam, which pushes the brake shoes and lining, creating friction. This friction slows and eventually stops the brake drum‚Äôs turning, which stops the wheel. Trailers In trailers, this remote air-supply is in the form of a tank, which is charged whenever the emergency brakes are released via the red trailer-supply valve on the dashboard. In a dual-circuit air brake system, this tank actually receives its air from both the primary and secondary reservoirs of the tractor; the air from both of these reservoirs is merged via a two-way check valve. The two-way check valve is a pneumatic device that has two inputs and one output; each input is connected to one these reservoirs. Only the air that is at the higher pressure is allowed to pass through to the check valve's output, which then passes through the tractor-protection valve, and then travels onward towards the trailer's air-tank and spring brake valve via the red trailer-supply line (a.k.a., the emergency line); this releases the trailer's emergency brakes (a.k.a. spring brakes). The tractor-protection valve is a device that prevents air from being lost from the tractor's braking system in the event of the air- lines becoming separated or broken. The tractor's air-lines connect to the trailer's air-lines via metal connectors known as gladhands. The merged air from both reservoirs of the tractor prevents air-loss from only one tractor braking circuit from causing the trailer's spring brakes to automatically apply. This gives the driver more control, and prevents the vehicle from grinding to a halt in an unsafe location, such as in the middle of an intersection. Service brake relay valve With a service brake relay valve installed, the hose that connects to the primary delivery-port output of the foot-valve becomes a control-line (i.e., The air from the foot-valve ‚Äúdead ends‚Äù at the relay valve's control-port.). Only low-volume air-signals are required to travel back and forth between the foot-valve's delivery port and the relay valve's control port; therefore, the air-volume supplied by the delivery port is now only a tiny-fraction of what otherwise would have been required had the relay valve not been installed. This reduces the delay between the application of the front and rear brakes to only a fraction of a second. When the driver depresses the brake pedal, a small amount of air momentarily opens the relay valve's supply port, which then directs air from the remote air-supply directly to the rear service brake chambers, and quickly applies the rear service brakes. The pressure delivered to the service brake chambers in this manner will equal the control-pressure delivered by the foot- valve to the relay valve. When the driver partially or fully releases the brake pedal, the control-pressure delivered by the foot-valve decreases; this causes the relay valve's supply port to close, and its exhaust port to momentarily open, thus preventing a pneumatic short-circuit from occurring while the air exhausts from all rear service brake chambers. In order to control the trailer service brakes, the merged outputs (i.e., merged via 2 two-way check valves connected in-series to give three inputs) of the foot- valve and trailer-hand-valve (if applicable) are directed through the tractor- protection valve, and onward towards the trailer relay valve via the blue service line. In tractors that are not equipped with a trailer hand valve, only the merged outputs of the foot-valve (i.e., via a single two-way check valve) are directed towards the trailer relay valve; however, the fact that the foot-valve's delivery-port outputs are still merged enables the trailer's service brakes to still be controlled even if there is failure within one braking circuit of the tractor. Spring brake relay valve A spring brake relay valve works on the same principle as the service brake relay valve, although it has the opposite effect. This type of relay valve responds to a major drop in pressure at its control-port by opening its exhaust port, which causes the air from each spring brake chamber under its control to remotely exhaust, thus applying the spring brakes much-more-quickly than would otherwise be possible if the air were required to discharge via the yellow parking-control valve on the dashboard. In a dual-circuit air brake system, air from both the primary and secondary reservoirs is fed into the supply-port of the parking-control valve, as well as the supply-port of this relay valve; it is merged via yet another two-way check valve. The delivery-port output of the parking-control valve connects to the control-port of this relay valve; this enables the spring brakes to be controlled via this valve. The merged air from the parking-control valve prevents air-loss from only one braking circuit from causing the spring brakes to automatically apply. This gives the driver more control, and prevents the vehicle from grinding to a halt in an unsafe location. However, with this increased control, comes increased responsibility on the part of the driver: If air is lost from the primary circuit alone, the spring brakes must be manually applied by the driver via the parking-control valve; otherwise, the front service brakes may not be enough to stop the vehicle safely in an emergency‚Äîespecially if the vehicle is heavily loaded, and/or traveling at a high-speed. In fact, the driver's failure to manually apply the spring brakes in this situation could lead to catastrophic failure of the front brakes due to overheating, since it could cause the front service brakes to exceed their design-limit for energy absorption. QR1C air valve speeds up the process, with anti compounding, meaning trailer and service brakes will function 1 second between each other. The relay valve's function is analogous to the transistor used in electronic circuits. Testing Relay Valves Relay valves are tested for durability before use through a seat test with air. In pressure at 80 psig or more, a 2-inch or smaller relay valve should not be tested for less than 15 seconds under pressure or for less than 30 seconds if it is at 3 inches in size.

Dunbar Cave is the 280th largest cave complex in the world, stretching 8.067 miles (13 km) inward. In front of the cave entrance is a large concrete poured structure with three distinct arches. The cave is located in an area of karst topography, including sinkholes, springs, and limestone bedrock. The manmade Swan Lake also sits in front of the cave. In March 2010 the cave was closed to tours and visitors because a bat infected with White nose syndrome was found in the cave. However as of August 2015 cave tours are back open again. History The entrance to Dunbar Cave was inhabited by local prehistoric peoples for thousands of years before settlers arrived. In the late 1970s a team of archaeologists found artifacts dating back to the Paleo Indian time, which was from 10000‚Äì8000 B.C. The bulk of artifacts found were dated to the Archaic time, which was from 8000‚Äì1000 B.C. The area, while still inhabited during the Woodland time, which was from 1000 B.C. ‚Äì 800 A.D., was not as populated due to the fact that the Native Americans at this time had started to rely heavily on growing crops, and the land around the Red River and Cumberland River were more conducive to growing crops than the rocky terrain around the cave. During the Mississippian era, which was from 800‚Äì1550 A.D., the cave was used by Native Americans for ceremonial purposes. There have been pictographs found in the cave depicting religious symbols indicating that the cave was believed to be an important spiritual location. By 1784 it had been claimed by Thomas Dunbar, who paid for the land but never got the deed. Sometime around 1790, a land surveyor named Robert Nelsen realized this and claimed the land for his own. A legal battle ensued, and in 1792 the US Government awarded the land to Robert Nelsen, and the Dunbar family was removed from the land, although the cave retained Dunbar's name. During the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, the cave was used to mine saltpeter for gunpowder. In 1858, developers saw the potential in the area, along with nearby Idaho Springs, and the first cabins were built there. After the Civil War, the springs and the cave were acquired by J. A. Tate, who constructed a two-story hotel on the site. By 1931, the area had hosted numerous social events, including dances, concerts, and fairs, and was in need of repair and renovation. At the time, the state had just completed a new road in front of the hotel and an opportunity arose. A couple of local businessmen cleaned up the site, adding additional recreational facilities, including a concrete swimming pool, bathhouse, and tennis courts, and restoring and expanding the size of the hotel. The existing lake was also dammed up, increasing its size to 20 acres (81,000 m¬≤). Dunbar Cave was purchased by Roy Acuff on April 26, 1948 for $150,000.Nashville Banner, April 27, 1948 The cave was the site of musical festivities and entertainment shows, which would host big bands like Benny Goodman's and Tommy Dorsey's. Acuff also added a golf course adjacent to the lake. Over time the popularity of the cave and surrounding area declined, and the hotel burned in 1950 and was not rebuilt. Dunbar Cave was purchased by McKay King in 1963. King operated the Dunbar Cave property until his death in 1971. The swimming pool was closed in 1967. The cave was inherited by his widow.Matthews (2005), page 38. In 1973, the State of Tennessee, under then Governor Winfield Dunn, purchased Dunbar Cave from Mrs. McKay King, to become a State Natural Area. In 2002, the park shut down briefly during the state's budget cutting crisis. Petroglyphs On January 15, 2005 park specialist Amy Wallace, geologist and author Larry E. Matthews, local historian Billy Frank Morrison, and history professor Joe Douglas discovered Native American Pictographs and petroglyphs in Dunbar Cave. The more than 30 drawings and etchings found in the cave were dated to the Mississippian era (700 to 1300 CE) using torches and other artifacts found nearby. Some of the pictographs are religious symbols, with one depicting a Mississippian supernatural warrior. Their existence was announced to the public by the State of Tennessee on July 29, 2006, during the Second Annual Dunbar Cave Day, held at the Park. 2010 White Nose Syndrome shutdown Although Dunbar Cave only has a small bat population, it is still closed from September through April to allow the bats undisrupted hibernation. In March 2010, a bat with White nose syndrome was discovered by researchers from Austin Peay State University doing assessments of species diversity and roosting patterns. Based on finding the infected bat, the State of Tennessee announced on March 24, 2010 that Dunbar Cave was closed to all visitors and tours were discontinued. Since 2006 when the disease was first discovered in New York, it has spread to Ontario, New Jersey, New Hampshire, and Tennessee, causing the death of over a million bats. The US Fish & Wildlife Service (USFWS) has called for a moratorium on caving activities in the affected areas, and strongly recommends that any clothing or equipment used in such areas be decontaminated after each use.

The album was released on June 11, 2001 on Warp. The music was created by Herren alone, with some tracks featuring guest vocals from MCs Mikah 9, MF Doom and Aesop Rock as well as vocalist Sam Prekop from The Sea and Cake. Inspired by Miami bass and early 90s hip hop, Herren had been recording music with his Music Production Center (MPC) for Schematic Records, a label known primarily for intelligent dance music (IDM). After working with various local hip hop artists making what he described as \\"very boring rap beats\\", Herren was inspired to take his music in a more left-field direction. Vocal Studies + Uprock Narrativess music is primarily instrumental and features unintelligible cut-up vocals. Originally inspired to sample the hip hop artists he was signed to work with in the studio, the album consists of samples by more popular hip hop artists including Nas, Ol' Dirty Bastard and Erykah Badu. Despite being described as electronic music, IDM and glitch and not the kind of music a hip hop audience is used to hearing, Herren felt that his music was closer to hip hop. The album's release after a tour that included a performance at All Tomorrow's Parties in the United Kingdom as well as opening for the group Tortoise in the United States. The album did not chart in either the United Kingdom or United States, but received positive reviews from various sources including AllMusic, Spin and Uncut. It was later named as one of the best albums of the year by Rolling Stone and The Globe and Mail and one of the best albums of the first half the 2000s by Pitchfork. Background and production In the mid- to late 1990s, Guillermo Scott Herren returned to Decatur, Georgia, from New York and worked at a recording studio. Unsatisfied working with the studio's clients, who he felt made \\"pre-historic trap music\\", Herren was encouraged to take his music in a more left-field direction, as he was \\"bored with people barking orders at me to make them these really boring rap beats.\\" In return for Herren handling the studio's hip hop clients, the studio owner bought him a Music Production Center (MPC) which Herren would use to create his Prefuse 73 material. Hip hop artist MF Doom (pictured) is featured on the album. While working at the studio, Herren met Joshua Kay and Romulo del Castillo, two Miami-based producers who had founded Schematic Records, a label known for IDM. Herren recorded and composed music on his MPC and manipulated it to fit Schematic's aesthetic. While working at the recording studio, Herren felt that the hip hop musicians coming in had very trite lyrics, and felt he could use them for his own Prefuse 73 material. For Vocal Studies + Uprock Narratives, Herren sampled more famous hip hop records by artists including Nas, Ol' Dirty Bastard and Erykah Badu. Herren stated that he used some of his favorite MCs instead of the musicians he worked with, as he felt these artists were \\"saying totally relevant stuff, but I guess it was just my excitement to make it happen. But a vocal doesn't have to say anything. Why not challenge people's imagination and let it say whatever they want it to?\\" For Vocal Studies + Uprock Narratives, Herren created the music using two turntables plugged into his MPC. To create the glitch sounds through the MPC, Herren switched between different sample sources by instantaneously silencing groups of audio channels at the same time. In 1999, Herren signed to the British label Warp under two aliases, Prefuse 73 and Savath & Savalas, after Warp staff had heard a previous record of Herren's which had sparked their interest in his work. Herren was familiar with the label through artists Aphex Twin and Boards of Canada, but chose to sign to Warp as he was a fan of the group Broadcast who had released an EP through the label. Vocal Studies + Uprock Narratives features rapping from Mikah 9, Aesop Rock and MF Doom, and vocals from Sam Prekop of the indie rock band the Sea and Cake. The vocalists did not work directly with Herren, but sent him audio tapes of their own vocal recordings. Herren later commented on having Prekop sing on the album, noting that having an indie rock artist on the album was his way of trying to get his sound out to a new audience. Music Herren described the album as an attempt to bridge hip hop instrumentals with vocal-orientated hip hop tracks, saying that the chopped and edited raps were \\"another layer of music\\" and that he was \\"into creating a whole new mangled language [...] it's a form of communication without communicating, a new flow when you feel like you're listening to a standard hip hop track but there's something in it that's not right.\\" The cut- up vocals were also described by Herren as a tribute to Miami bass music and the group Mantronix. Herren said: \\"Old school dirty south and booty shake shit, just the way stuff was edited back then, all the bass music and edit records... that's what inspired me. I wanted to make edit records, but bring all the shit that happened afterwards into it, hip hop from the early 90s through the present day.\\" The song \\"Nuno\\" features chopped-up vocals with only the phrase \\"fuck words of wisdom\\" intelligible; the title is a reference to the Portuguese musician Nuno Canavarro, whose 1988 album Plux Quba also features manipulated vocals including randomly-reassembled tapes of children singing. Herren used a sample from Canavarro's song \\"Wask\\" for \\"Nuno\\". The Sydney Morning Herald stated that \\"journalists obsessed with labels\\" had described the music in a range of genres \\"from 'glitch' to 'click-hop'.\\" Music journalists made other comparisons of the music in context of both electronic and hip hop, with Exclaim! describing this sound as \\"not exactly what the hip hop world is used to hearing.\\" Fact expanded on the description of the two genres, stating that \\"the sonic cut-ups that characterize Vocal Studies have often been linked to the IDM scene, but they can just as well be understood within the context of scratching and turntablism, where snatching small elements of records and re-contextualizing them was key.\\" Herren has only described his style as hip hop, saying that he does not listen to electronic music and that \\"some people have a hard time accepting what I do.\\" During promotion of his next album One Word Extinguisher, Herren stated that Vocal Studies + Uprock Narratives did not have a particular theme as he was primarily focusing on and developing an editing style. In contrast, his follow-up One Word Extinguisher was about his relationship with a woman and the vast spectrum of emotions felt during a break-up. Release and promotion Prior to the release of Vocal Studies + Uprock Narratives, Herren performed at the All Tomorrow's Parties festival at Camber Sands in April 2001. The festival was curated by the band Tortoise, with whom Herren toured as the opening act in May 2001. Vocal Studies + Uprock Narratives was released on June 11, 2001 through Warp on vinyl, compact disc and download. It was Warp's second release by an American musician, following Richard Devine's Lipswitch which had been released in the previous January. The album did not chart in the United States or United Kingdom. Herren was not happy on how the album was promoted, saying: \\"I couldn't understand why they were treating me like I was 10. They were ignoring all the cultural references that were to be found throughout that first record.\\" He felt the album \\"would have been easier to package if I'd been from the Bronx. Instead I was from Miami, and lived in Decatur.\\" Critical reception John Bush of AllMusic described the album as \\"one of the most enjoyable works of experimental techno heard in several years, a combination of tough, underground hip hop and the fractured neo- electro of Warp favorites Autechre and Plaid.\\" Noel Dix of Exclaim! described the album as \\"a truly remarkable and creative record\\", praising its unpredictability. Tedd Kessler of the NME called the album \\"teeth-clattering but exhilarating\\", writing that \\"behind every wall of hip hop noise ... there lurks a heart-bursting tune and that's what makes it alluring.\\" Pitchfork wrote that Herren had \\"painted a portrait of the peculiar state of our urbanity.\\" Reviewing the album alongside two other Warp releases (Plaid's Double Figure and Squarepusher's Go Plastic), Uncut described Vocal Studies as \\"the pick of this crop\\" and concluded that it \\"genuinely seems like a next step for a genre in perpetual need of reinvention.\\" The BBC gave the album a mixed review, stating that \\"taken as a whole the album is pretty relentless\\" and the album was \\"best taken in small doses\\". PopMatters gave the album a negative review, writing that \\"the new sounds Herren creates are innovative and entertaining; he simply overdoes it.\\" Legacy and influence Vocal Studies + Uprock Narratives was named as one of the best albums of 2001 by several publications, including Pitchfork, Ottawa Citizen and Rolling Stone. The Globe and Mail named it the seventh best album of the year, with Carl Wilson writing that \\"of all the electronica-glich-IDM this year, [the album] is the only one I go back to as if it were the Rolling Stones.\\" In 2005, Pitchfork ranked the album the 84th best of 2000‚Äì2004. Herren was overwhelmed with the positive reception the album received, exclaiming that \\"Most of it was so positive, but I'd also get a really strong reaction from people- some that want to kill me, 'cause they're under the impression that I'm trying to kill hip hop or something, and I'm like 'uh see ya, whatever man.'\\" According to Pitchfork, the album was important for Warp, which had been seeking credibility after relocating their offices to New York City. Herren began acting as A&R; member for the label, which had a reputation only for IDM, by introducing it to artists including Anti-Pop Consortium, Battles, and Flying Lotus. In 2011, after releasing The Only She Chapters, his eighth album for the label, Warp ended their relationship with Herren. The master recordings of his material stayed with the label. Vocal Studies + Uprock Narratives was an influential album for contemporary musicians Amon Tobin and Nick Sanborn of Sylvan Esso. Tobin stated that his single \\"Verbal\\", from his acclaimed 2002 album Out from Out Where, was influenced by Prefuse 73. Sanborn spoke on the influence of Vocal Studies + Uprock Narratives, referring to it as one of the records that \\"gave me a doorway into hip hop. I know it's weird, but he was my entry point into instrumental hip hop, starting a domino effect that led me to Dilla, Madlib and the rest.\\" Track listing All tracks written by Scott Herren Personnel Credits adapted from Vocal Studies + Uprock Narratives liner notes. * Scott Herren ‚Äì performer, writer * Estrada / Mofungo ‚Äì design See also * 2001 in music NotesExternal links * Vocal Studies + Uprock Narratives album microsite at the Wayback Machine * Category:2001 debut albums Category:Prefuse 73 albums Category:Warp (record label) albums ","title":"Vocal Studies + Uprock Narratives"},{"id":"1494495","text":"Slan√Ω (; ) is a town in the Central Bohemian Region of the Czech Republic. It has about 16,000 inhabitants. It is located about 25 km northwest of Prague. The town is part of the Prague metropolitan area. Administrative parts The villages of Dol√≠n, ≈Ωelevƒçice, Lotou≈°, Blahotice, Netovice, Kv√≠c, Kv√≠ƒçek, Trpomƒõchy and Otruby are all administrative parts of Slan√Ω. Geography The town is situated in the Slan√Ω Plain (the northwestern part of a geomorphologic whole called the Prague Plain). A creek called ƒåerven√Ω potok (Red creek) flows through it from the southwest to the northeast. Its dominant feature is Sl√°nsk√° Hill. History The Bohemian Chronicle of V√°clav H√°jek records Slan√Ω as having been founded in 750, at the site of a salt spring below Sl√°nsk√° Hill (slan√Ω is Czech for \\"salty\\"). The town grew as a result of its location on the trade route between Prague and Saxony. The Benedictines established a hospital here in 1136, together with a church dedicated to St. Gotthard. It was this large presence of the church, and the unconsolidated state of landed property that went with it, that allowed king Wenceslas II to charter Slan√Ω as a town and give his royal assent to its Magdeburg rights only sometime in the decade after 1295. In 1348, an earthquake damaged the now-fortified town; in 1371, a large fire broke out, and the church had to be rebuilt. Slan√Ω was captured by the Taborites in 1425 during the Hussite Wars, and remained in their hands until 1434. Not only did the Benedictine monks have to leave ‚Äî this town by the hill was also one of Hussite holy cities, and their preachers expected it to survive the anticipated end of the world. Later, the Hussite king George of Podƒõbrady gave Slan√Ω many privileges, after the town had supported his election to the throne. The town also participated in the Bohemian Revolt that opened the Thirty Years' War, housing the family of king Frederick V of the Palatinate. After the battle of White Mountain, that meant a defeat for the cause, the town suffered as a result of the ravages of war. Afterwards, the new Catholic possessors of Slan√Ω, the Martinic, erected many a baroque church and edifice that, together with a new monastery, adorn the town to this day. Since the middle of the 19th century, Czech has been the dominant language there. Industrial development was delayed until around 1860. An important engineering factory was built in 1872 and more followed. A factory producing batteries was founded in 1918. The infrastructure and amenities of a modern town have been gradually added since the second half of the 19th century.

The first prisoners who came to the camp were political prisoners from the Ravensbr√ºck camp in northern Germany. Later Jewish prisoners were brought. History In the beginning, no barracks were completed so the women slept in the factory hall. Eventually twelve barracks were completed, but only four were for prisoners living quarters. Fifty-four guards served at the camp; twenty-seven men and twenty-seven women. Most of the women guards served at other camps; many trained at Flossenburg, two at Gross Rosen and some in Ravensbr√ºck concentration camp before they arrived at Helmbrechts. The male guards were mostly older Germans or ethnic Germans who were no longer combat worthy. Herta Haase, Erna Achtenberg, Ellia Mains, Ingeborg Schimming-Assmuss, and Ruth Hildner were some of the female SS troops stationed in the camp. The male guards profiles however are unknown by the most part. According to a postwar testimony of overseer Elli Mains, relations between the male and female guards were \\"very good.\\" The camps population was mainly non-Jews, but in March 1945, a group of over 500 Jewish women arrived on foot from the Gr√ºnberg subcamp in Poland. Conditions for the Jewish prisoners at Helmbrechts were brutal with vicious guards and primitive facilities. One prisoner who stayed there a month on the Volary death march writes of sleeping on dirt floors with no blankets. Nor was there access to toilets; only two barrels in the corner of the barracks served 400 women in the barracks, many of whom suffered from dysentary. The guards regularly beat them in the morning for the mess. Weissman Klein reports that each morning the guards came by with a wheelbarrow to haul away the bodies of those who died in the night. Many also died as a result of beatings. Evacuation (death march) May 11, 1945: German civilians are forced to walk past the bodies of 30 Jewish women starved to death by German SS troops in a march across Czechoslovakia from Helmbrechts concentration camp. Buried in shallow graves in Volary, Czechoslovakia, the bodies were exhumed by German civilians working under the direction of Medics of the 5th Infantry Division, US Third Army. The bodies were later placed in coffins and reburied in the cemetery in Volary. In early April 1945 the front closed in on Germany. Commandant Doerr ordered the women and a few men, one being a rabbi, to depart on a death march to the Dachau concentration camp. The extra clothing in the camp was given to the non-Jewish prisoners. Along the way the Nazi guards learned that the US Army liberated the camp and turned the march into (then still occupied) Czechoslovakia. The Germans left all the non-Jewish women at the Zwodau (Svatava) subcamp on the seventh day of the march but took with them the more than 500 Jewish women. Those women marched another two weeks, until May 6, most of them dying from starvation, disease, and the beatings and shootings of the guards. On May 6, they were liberated at Volary, Czechoslavakia. The camp at Helmbrechts was liberated the same day as Bergen Belsen, April 15, but no inmates remained behind. Postwar fates of one of the camp guard In 1996 renewed attention focused on the Helmbrechts sub-concentration camp. Two stories broke about former SS-Aufseherin (\\"Overseer\\") Ingeborg Schimming-Assmuss who was accused of killing four prisoners at the camp and on the death march into Czechoslovakia. One article began \\"DEATH FORSTALLED the LAW.\\" \\"The [camp] called her 'the Terrible Inge'- Inge Assmuss, earlier Schimming, one of 27 [female guards] inside the external bearing Helmbrechts.\\" She was hidden from prosecution by the State Security Service in Berlin for over 50 years. The first record of murder was done by Ingeborg, as well as the other female guards in Helmbrechts on February 24, 1945. She and the other overseers flogged a female inmate, Dr. Alexandra Samoylenko to death for escaping. The act was tolerated and ordered by camp commandant Alois Doerr. Another former prisoner related, \\"...on the first day after the march [began] an Aufseherin-she was called Inge-tore my completely weakened friend Bassia from my arms with a switch and dragged her into the forest. I heard a shot. Subsequently, the Aufseherin returned alone.\\" Two other inmates also related to Allied forces that the Aufseherin killed other internees. In 1951 a warrant was issued for Ingeborg's arrest to the GDR. Authorities in East Berlin refused to hand over the former SS employee, saying that 'she works for us.' In 1989 the Berlin Wall fell and Inge was still living in East Berlin, scarcely fifty meters from the former wall. In 1994 she was discovered living in Berlin-Pankow. In 1996 Ingeborg Schimming-Assmuss died, a free woman. The German government was in the process of prosecuting the former female guard, but as the title of the article stated, death stopped all proceedings. She was seventy-four years old.

Released on 10 November 2000, it was a critical and commercial failure. The film was Hoffman's only feature film; he primarily directed television commercials. Plot In 2056 A.D., Earth is in ecological crisis as a consequence of pollution and overpopulation. Automated interplanetary missions have been seeding Mars with atmosphere-producing algae as the first stage of terraforming the planet. When the oxygen quantity produced by the algae is inexplicably reduced, the crew of Mars-1 investigate‚Äîa crew consisting of Quinn Burchenal (Tom Sizemore), a geneticist; Bud Chantilas (Terence Stamp), an aging philosophical scientist and surgeon; systems engineer Robby Gallagher (Val Kilmer); commander Kate Bowman (Carrie-Anne Moss); pilot Ted Santen (Benjamin Bratt); and terraforming scientist Chip Pettengill (Simon Baker). When Mars-1 is damaged in arrival by a gamma-ray burst, Bowman remains aboard for repair while the others land to locate an automated habitat (HAB 1) established earlier to manufacture food and oxygen. During insertion, the team's landing craft is damaged and lands off-course. In the aftermath, \\"AMEE\\" (Autonomous Mapping Exploration and Evasion)‚Äîa military robot programmed to guide them‚Äîis lost, and Chantilas suffers a ruptured spleen and internal bleeding, and tells the others to leave him behind. Santen refuses, but Chantilas tells them that they have limited oxygen left to make it to HAB 1. Chantilas tells Gallagher that it is all right, as he got to see Mars for the first time. The crew leaves to allow Chantilas to die in peace. In orbit around Mars, Bowman contacts Houston, which informs her that Mars-1 is in decaying orbit, but offers hope of restoring engine function in departing Mars. On Mars, the landing party find HAB 1 mysteriously destroyed. They are baffled for an explanation, since the module was designed and field-tested in Tornado Alley to withstand any damaging storms on Mars. All expect their imminent deaths by suffocation. Pettengill and Santen wander from the others to explore, later to reach a canyon where Pettengill accidentally kills Santen, after they get into a fight over whether or not the mission was a failure, and that Pettengill realizes that Santen would never accept defeat. Pettengill returns to Burchenal and Gallagher and tells them that Santen killed himself. His oxygen depleted, Gallagher opens his helmet, choosing a quick death over asphyxiation ‚Äì and discovers that Mars' atmosphere is thin but breathable. The only salvageable material from the habitat is all of the liquid fuel, which has ruptured out of its containers but pooled under the wreck. With no remaining power in their suits, the astronauts set it on fire with a flare so they can have a bonfire to survive the massive temperature drop of the Martian night. AMEE reunites with the crew, and the three astronauts notice the robot is damaged and attempt to shut it down so they can recover its guidance device. Perceiving their actions as a threat, AMEE breaks Burchenal's ribs and pursues the others before retreating. Gallagher tells the others she has gone into military mode and intends to kill them all one by one. She wounded Burchenal instead of killing him because she has been programmed with knowledge of the old guerrilla tactic that a wounded man will slow the enemy down since effort must be expended to transport a wounded teammate. Eventually, Gallagher builds a makeshift radio from parts of the Mars Rover Pathfinder, through which Bowman instructs them to use a Russian probe's sample-return system to launch themselves into orbit. During the trip, Bowman tells Gallagher that the probe can hold only two people. The trio takes shelter from an ice storm inside of a cave. Devastated by the recent news and afraid of being left behind, Pettengill flees with the radio, only to be killed by AMEE. After the storm subsides Gallagher and Burchenal recover the radio from Pettingill's corpse, and discover that it has become infested by insect-like native Martian life (identified by Burchenal as \\"nematodes\\"). The insects are highly flammable, as using a simple cutting torch on Pettengill's corpse to free his grip caused a chain reaction, making all the insects in his corpse explode like firecrackers. Later, the two encounter a field of algae being eaten by the insects, and Burchenal pieces together what happened. The Martian insects had lain dormant on their almost dead world, but when the probes from Earth spread algae fields across Mars it gave them a massive new food source and led to a population explosion. The Martian insects are what caused the algae to disappear, but in the process they actually gave Mars breathable oxygen levels, because they produce oxygen as a waste product (explaining why they are so flammable). The insects are also what destroyed the habitat module, as they tore in to get to the food supplies inside. Burchenal explains to Gallagher that the biochemistry of alien insects' respiratory metabolism is capable of producing oxygen far more efficiently than human science is currently able to. Studying the insects' biochemistry is the key to terraforming Mars, and may even lead to discoveries which will allow Earth's polluted atmosphere to be repaired. However, Burchenal is attacked by swarms of the insects when blood drips from an open wound. Rather than be eaten alive, he passes his sample vial of insects to Gallagher before immolating himself and his attackers. Gallagher reaches the Russian probe, finds sufficient fuel to power the rocket's engine, but not enough electrical power to launch the probe, and realizes that the only available replacement is AMEE's power core. In a final confrontation, Gallagher is able to lure AMEE into a trap and disable her using one of the probe's sample launchers, then takes her battery. Gallagher launches himself in the probe's sample-return capsule and reaches orbit where Mars-1 is waiting for him, and he is recovered and revived by Bowman. Gallagher becomes upset that four astronauts died so that he could live, but Bowman tells him that they did not die for nothing. The computer is busy analyzing the sample of Martian insects which Gallagher brought back, and research on them might lead to repairing Earth itself. With a six-month-long trip back to Earth, the computer has plenty of time to analyze the insects, and Bowman and Gallagher have time to start pursuing a romantic relationship.

Ted Santen * Simon Baker as Chip Pettengill * Terence Stamp as Dr. Bud Chantilas * Neil Ross as Space Suit (voice) (uncredited) Production The production of the film (which was filmed in Wadi Rum in Southern Jordan and in Outback Australia) was the subject of numerous reports about the bad working relationship between co-stars Tom Sizemore and Val Kilmer. Kilmer's reputation for being \\"difficult\\" was already well- established, and although the two stars had been friends, they fell out after Kilmer reportedly became enraged when he discovered that production had paid for Sizemore's exercise machine to be shipped to the set. Kilmer shouted, \\"I‚Äôm making ten million on this; you‚Äôre only making two\\", to which Sizemore responded by throwing a 50-pound weight at Kilmer. The two were soon refusing to speak to each other or even come onto the set if the other was present, necessitating the use of body doubles to shoot scenes involving both actors, and their relationship became so bad that one of the producers is said to have asked Sizemore not to hit Kilmer in the face when the big fight finally happened - in the event, Sizemore purposely punched Kilmer in the chest. Sizemore has since described the film as one of his career regrets, but also stated that he and Kilmer have since reconciled. Release=Box office Red Planet opened at No. 5 at the North American box office making $8.7 million USD in its opening weekend. The film was a box office bomb, grossing $33 million worldwide against an estimated budget of $80 million.

He murdered the anti-Mafia prosecutor Giovanni Falcone in 1992, and once stated that he had committed between 100 and 200 murders. He had been sentenced to life in prison in absentia for Mafia association and multiple murders. Brusca was captured in 1996, and turned pentito. A pudgy, bearded and unkempt mafioso, Brusca was known in Mafia circles as 'u verru (in Sicilian) or il porco or il maiale (in Italian; \\"the pig\\", \\"the swine\\") or 'u scannacristiani (\\"the people-slayer\\"; in the Sicilian language the word cristianu means both ‚ÄúChristian‚Äù and \\"human being\\").

Shortly before he ordered the murder of Di Matteo, Brusca had also discovered that he had been sentenced in absentia to a life sentence for the murder of Ignazio Salvo. Brusca was involved in the campaign of terror in 1993 against the state during their crackdown against the Mafia after the murders of Anti-mafia magistrates Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino. Following the months after Riina's arrest in January 1993, there were a series of bombings by the Corleonesi against several tourist spots on the Italian mainland ‚Äì the Via dei Georgofili bombing in Florence, Via Palestro in Milan and the Piazza San Giovanni in Laterano and Via San Teodoro in Rome, which left 10 people dead and 71 injured as well as severe damage to centres of cultural heritage such as the Uffizi Gallery.

As the scruffy- bearded Brusca emerged from a car, clad in dirty jeans and a rumpled white shirt, some ripped off their ski masks, as if to say they no longer had anything to fear from the Mafia. One reportedly managed to slip past guards and punched Brusca in the face. In 1997, Di Matteo and Brusca met face to face during court proceedings. Bursting into tears Di Matteo told the judge: \\"I guarantee my collaboration, but to this animal I guarantee nothing. If you leave me alone with him for two minutes I'll cut off his head.\\" The confrontation threatened to become violent, but court security guards restrained Di Matteo. Di Matteo assale Brusca: \\"Animale, ti stacco la testa\\", La Repubblica, September 15, 1998 Brusca had also asked Giuseppe Di Matteo's family for forgiveness.

According to Brusca, Bernardo Provenzano \\"sold\\" Riina in exchange for the valuable archive of compromising material that Riina held in his apartment in Via Bernini 52 in Palermo. Brusca also claimed that Riina had told him that after the assassination of Falcone, he had been in indirect negotiations with interior minister Nicola Mancino in a deal to prevent any further killings. Mancino later said this was not true,Folain, Vendetta, p. 150 but in July 2012, Mancino was ordered to stand trial for withholding evidence on 1992 talks between the Italian state and the Mafia and the killings of Falcone and Borsellino.Italy: Ex-interior minister implicated in mafia negotiations, AND Kronos International, 25 July 2012 Brusca has been imprisoned in Rebibbia, Rome, though has requested house arrest nine times since 2002, all having been refused.

As a result of his collaboration with police, his sentence was reduced to 26 years in prison. Assets confiscated The Brusca family land was seized by the government and in 2000, handed over to an organization called the Consortium for Legal Development.

Les Luthiers is an Argentine comedy-musical group, very popular also in several other Spanish-speaking countries including Paraguay, Guatemala, Peru, Chile, Ecuador, Spain, Colombia, Mexico, Uruguay, Bolivia, Cuba, Costa Rica and Venezuela. They were formed in 1967 by Gerardo Masana, during the height of a period of very intense choral music activity in Argentina's state universities. Their outstanding characteristic is the home- made musical instruments (hence the name luthiers, French for \\"musical instrument maker\\"), some of them extremely sophisticated, which they skillfully employ in their recitals to produce music and texts full of high class and refined humor. From 1977 until his death in 2007, they worked with Roberto Fontanarrosa, a renowned Argentine cartoonist and writer. Musical stylings Les Luthiers began writing humorous pieces primarily in a Baroque style, especially imitating vocal genres such as cantatas, madrigals and serenatas. Later, they diversified into humorous renditions of music in other genres, from romantic lieder and opera to pop, mariachi and even rap. Their stage show is often intermingled with humorous skits, frequently involving absurd situations, the music and biography of fictional composer Johann Sebastian Mastropiero and a heavy reliance on fairly sophisticated word play. Much of the humor derives from the basic contradictions between the formality and highly developed vocal and instrumental technique of classical musicians and the sheer silliness of their show. All members of the group provided their voices for the pigeons in the Latin American and Spanish dubbings of the 2008 Disney film, Bolt. Les Luthiers have acknowledged the influence of Gerard Hoffnung and Peter Schikele in their work. \\"Professor\\" Schikele invented in 1965 the fictional character of P.D.Q. Bach, son of Johann Sebastian Bach. He also invented many unusual instruments based in real ones, in the same style of the group. He also used the fictional biography of his imaginary composer as a running gag in his musical act. Mr. Hoffnung predated both acts, starting in 1956 the Hoffnung Music Festival and publishing many cartoons with imaginary instruments for a classical orchestra. Malcolm Arnold probably was the first person to write a parody of classical music using odd instruments when he wrote for a Hoffnung Concert the score of A Grand, Grand Overture, a piece for orchestra and vacuum cleaners dedicated to US President Herbert Hoover. Informal instruments Les Luthiers are known in particular for employing a diverse ensemble of invented instruments created from common, everyday materials. The group's first home-made musical instrument, the bass- pipe a vara (a sort of trombone), was created by Gerardo Masana, the founder of the group, by joining paperboard tubes found in the garbage and miscellaneous items. Forty years later, this instrument is still being used on stage. The first informal instruments were relatively simple, like the Gum- Horn, made with a hose, a funnel and a trumpet's mouthpiece, and some of them were born as a parody of musical instruments, which is the case of the lat√≠n (referred to in English as fiddlecan) and the violata, bowed instruments whose resonating chambers are made out of a large tin for processed ham and a paint can respectively, the marimba de cocos, a marimba made out of coconuts, and others. Inventor and instrument-maker Carlos Iraldi (1920‚Äì1995), as \\"Les Luthiers' luthier\\", was responsible for inventing several more sophisticated instruments, including the mandocleta, a bicycle whose rear wheel moves the strings of a mandolin, the bajo barr√≠ltono, a Double bass whose body is a giant barrel, and others. After Iraldi's death in 1995 Hugo Dom√≠nguez took his place, and made instruments such as the desafinaducha, the nomeolb√≠det etc. Current members * Carlos L√≥pez Puccio: Bowed Strings (violin, viola, cello), synthesizers, vocals, percussion, dactilophone, etc. * Jorge Maronna: Vocals, fretted strings (guitar, bass, banjo, charango, lute...), cello, synthesizers, etc. * Roberto Antier: Piano * Tom√°s Mayer-Wolf: Piano * Martin O'Connor: Vocals * Horacio Turano: Saxophone Former members * Gerardo Masana, founder (died in 1973): Guitar, bass-pipe, vocals, percussion, etc. * Ernesto Acher (left the group in 1986): Piano, horn, trumpet, clarinet, drums, synthesizers, cello, vocals, etc. * Daniel Rabinovich (died in 2015): Vocals, guitar, violin, bass-pipe, sousaphone, recorder, drums, etc. * Carlos N√∫√±ez Cort√©s (left the group in 2017): Piano, vocals, recorder, piccolo, Bunsen flute, synthesizer, etc. * Marcos Mundstock: (died in 2020): Vocals, percussion, trumpet, synthesizer, etc. Shows *Les Luthiers cuentan la √≥pera (1967) *Todos somos mala gente (1968) *Blancanieves y los siete pecados capitales (1969) *Querida Condesa (1969) *Les Luthiers Opus P√≠ (1971) *Recital '72 (1972) *Recital sinf√≥nico '72 (1972) *Recital '73 (1973) *Recital '74 (1974) *Recital '75 (1975) *Viejos fracasos (1976) *Mastropiero que nunca (1977) *Les Luthiers hacen muchas gracias de nada (1979) *Los cl√°sicos de Les Luthiers (1980) *Luthier√≠as (1981) *Por humor al arte (1983) *Humor dulce hogar (1985) *Recital sinf√≥nico '86 (1986) *Vieg√©simo aniversario (1987) *El re√≠r de los Cantares (1989) *Les Luthiers, Grandes Hitos (1992) *Unen canto con humor (1994) *Bromato de armonio (1996) *Todo por que r√≠as (1999) *Do, Re, Mi, J√° (2000) *El Grosso Concerto (2001) *Las Obras De Ayer (2002) *Con Les Luthiers y sinf√≥nica (2004) *Recital Folkl√≥rico Cosqu√≠n (2005) *Los Premios Mastropiero (2005) *Recital por los Cuarenta A√±os (2007) *Lutherapia (2008) *¬°CHIST!

According to an interview with Steve Martin of Agnostic Front that appeared in the December 1991 issue of Pulse! magazine, Arc had its genesis in a film that Young made called Muddy Track (referred to in an interview with David Fricke in the November 28, 1991 issue of Rolling Stone), which consisted of the beginnings and endings of various songs from his 1987 European tour. Young placed a video camera on his amplifier during the 1987 tour and recorded the beginnings and endings of various songs, and later edited them down into the film's soundtrack. \\"It was the sound of the entire band being sucked into this little limiter, being compressed and fuckin' distorted to hell,\\" Young said to Martin, referring to the soundtrack of Muddy Track. Young then showed the video to Sonic Youth's Thurston Moore, who suggested that he record an entire album in a similar manner. However, Arc was not recorded through video camera microphones, as was the case with Muddy Track, but instead was compiled from various professional multi-track recordings made throughout the tour.

In Roman times, the \\"scrutari\\" of cities and towns were those who laboriously searched for valuables amidst the waste and cast-offs of others. The modern English \\"scrutiny\\" is derived from this root, indicating a careful examination or inquiry (often implying the search for a hidden mistake, misstatement, or incongruity). The word is specifically applied in the early Roman Catholic Church to the examination of the catechumens or those under instruction in the faith. They were taught the creed and the Lord's Prayer, examined therein, and exorcized prior to baptism. The days of scrutiny varied at different periods from three to seven. From about the beginning of the 12th century, when it became usual to baptize infants soon after their birth instead of at stated times (Easter and Pentecost), the ceremony of scrutiny was incorporated with that of the actual baptism. Currently, there are three moments for the scrutinies to occur: the 3rd, 4th, and 5th Sundays of Lent. These are done in public in front of the entire congregation, and the candidates are dismissed before the Prayer of the Faithful. Only under grave circumstances can the scrutinies be dispensed, and only then by the local ordinary (who can dispense only two at most). The scrutinies are fully intended for the catechumens (i.e., those who are to receive Baptism, Communion, and Confirmation).Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults Scrutiny is also a term applied to a method of electing a pope in the Catholic Church, in contradistinction to two other methods, acclamation and accession. In the law of elections, scrutiny is the careful examination of votes cast after the unsuccessful candidate has lodged a petition claiming the seat, and alleging that he has the majority of legal votes. Each vote is dealt with separately, notice being given beforehand by one party to the other of the votes objected to and the grounds of objection.

It was developed for the Commodore 64 by Rainbow Arts, and was ported to other systems later. In addition to concept design and character creation, Trenz programmed Turrican on the Commodore 64. A sequel, Turrican II: The Final Fight, followed in 1991 for the Commodore 64 and other platforms. Gameplay Turrican can be described as a cross between Metroid and Psycho-Nics Oscar. While the huge levels and the morph-ball function were inspired by Metroid, the overall graphics design and weapons were inspired by Psycho-Nics Oscar. Unlike many other action games of its time, Turrican did not force the player to complete a linear level. Instead, the player can explore each level and uncover secrets. Plot The lost colony of Alterra is a completely man-made world in a nearby galaxy, abandoned long ago. Alterra consists of five self-contained habitats, separately bio-engineered by a powerful ecosystem generation network known as a Multiple Organism Unit Link, or MORGUL for short. Early colonists used MORGUL to render Alterra inhabitable, but a cataclysmic quake severed all system interface functions, and MORGUL murderously rebelled. The few colonists lucky enough to escape told a grim tale of a higher intelligence gone berserk. For generations, mankind sought a return to Alterra. Finally, genetic science created a saviour: Turrican, a mutant warrior, bio-engineered for the task of planetary reclamation. In the meantime, MORGUL has diligently twisted Alterran life forms to his brutal, destructive purposes. Thus, Turrican's challenges consist of eliminating hostile organisms from Alterra's five multi-level worlds and, finally, destroying the three faces of MORGUL. Development Level 1 (Atari ST version) The series started in 1989 on the Commodore 64 with a demo level of the full game which was released in 1990. Turrican became popular due to its high technical achievements, demonstrating graphics which many did not believe to be possible on a C64. Turrican was developed mainly by Manfred Trenz and published by Rainbow Arts. Turrican was released for the Amiga, Atari ST, Amstrad CPC, ZX Spectrum and CDTV. Factor 5 handled the Amiga, Atari ST and CDTV versions, while the Amstrad CPC and ZX Spectrum were developed by Probe Software. While all of these versions were published in Europe, the Commodore versions were the only computer versions to be published in North America, by Innerprise Software. The Spectrum version of the game went to number 2 in the UK sales charts, behind Shadow Warriors. In 1991, console ports for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis, TurboGrafx-16 and Game Boy were handled by The Code Monkeys and published by Accolade in North America, with the Mega Drive and Game Boy versions being also released in Europe. A conversion of the game for the Atari Jaguar was under discussion by German studio Softgold, but work on the port was never stated beyond the discussional phase. Music Chris Huelsbeck composed music for the Amiga conversions of Turrican, Turrican II and Turrican 3, as well as Mega Turrican for the Mega Drive and Super Turrican and Super Turrican 2 for the SNES. Music from Turrican II was performed live by a full orchestra at the second Symphonic Game Music Concert in 2004. The event took place in Leipzig, Germany. The music from Turrican was released in the Turrican Soundtrack Anthology on November 24, 2013 as a 4-volume digital download. In addition, \\"Subsong 2\\" from the Commodore 64 version of Turrican, arranged by Ramiro Vaca, was copied from the song \\"Escape\\" of The Transformers: The Movie soundtrack. The title screen of Turrican is based upon the Manowar album cover Kings of Metal. Reception The Spectrum version was voted number 36 in the Your Sinclair Readers' Top 100 Games of All Time. Sequels=Turrican II: The Final Fight Turrican II: The Final Fight was released in 1991. The Amiga version, done by Factor 5, was finished before the C64 version, but Manfred Trenz cites the C64 version as the original design. The game was also released for the CDTV, Atari ST, Amstrad CPC, ZX Spectrum and PC (MS-DOS), and also for the Mega Drive/Genesis, Game Boy and SNES http://www.nemmelheim.de/turrican/official_turricans/show_turrican_details.php?game=UniversalSoldierSNES rebranded as Universal Soldier. Mega Turrican/Turrican 3: Payment Day Mega Turrican was an original Factor 5 game initially designed for the Mega Drive/Genesis, and later followed by an Amiga port under the title of Turrican 3: Payment Day. PC (MS-DOS), Acorn Archimedes and Amiga CD32 versions were also planned and developed, but they were never released and only some enemy sprite designs have surfaced. Super Turrican (NES) Released for the NES, this Turrican game was created by Manfred Trenz alone. It is based roughly on the levels of the first two Turrican games. Super Turrican and Super Turrican 2 (SNES) The Super Turrican games were developed for the SNES by Factor 5. They were released in 1993 and 1995, respectively. Unreleased games Turrican 3D was intended to introduce 3D graphics in the Turrican series, but was not released because publisher THQ stopped development. The game was intended for PC (Windows) and Dreamcast. Screenshots and videos show how the world of Turrican would have looked.Screenshots and videos of Turrican 3D In an interview, Manfred Trenz, creator of Turrican, Turrican II, Super Turrican (NES) and co-developer of Turrican 3D, stated that many members of the project were far too profit-oriented, and the project failed as a result. Thornado is another never-released Turrican spin-off. Handled by the US branch of Factor 5, they did not use the name Turrican because of legal issues. It was developed first for the Nintendo 64 and later for the GameCube. All that is available from this game is a piece of preliminary music composed by Chris Huelsbeck and some art assets that were reused in Star Wars: Rebel Strike, such as the Golden Gate-looking bridge. The \\"Thornado Demo\\" track which was released as a teaser for the then-upcoming GameCube game, was in fact running on the older Nintendo 64 sound hardware using Factor 5's new proprietary MusyX software sound engine. The Thornado demo, although not available on Factor 5's website anymore, can still be found on Chris Huelsbeck's page at GarageBand.com.http://www.garageband.com/artist/huelsbeck Next-gen Turrican in April 2007, a Gamasutra article revealed that Factor 5 was working on concepts for a new Turrican game. The game did not have a title yet and was known as Turrican or Project cyclone. Since the game was being planned once again by the US branch of Factor 5 and they went bankrupt not long after, this game was not released. Fan projects Hurrican is an independent freeware sequel released for Windows in 2007. In the past there were already several other more or less extensive fan-made remakes of Turrican including T2002, T4 Funeral and a Turrican table for Visual Pinball, but Hurrican is particularly notable for its 2nd place in the 2008 Indie Game Showcase contest.Winners of the Indie Game Showcase contest 2008 (archived) As the source code of Hurrican was released in 2012, source ports to other platforms are now possible.Hurrican source-code released! news message of the developer (January 30, 2012)  Gallery  Amiga-Computer.jpgTurrican played on an Amiga, photographed in England in the early 1990s.

As a poetic movement in Great Britain it is often seen as being the successor to The Movement. Cambridge In November 1952 while at Downing College, Cambridge University, Philip Hobsbaum along with two friends‚ÄîTony Davis and Neil Morris‚Äîdissatisfied with the way poetry was read aloud in the university, decided to place a notice in the undergraduate newspaper Varsity for people interested in forming a poetry discussion group. Five others, including Peter Redgrove, came along to the first meeting. This poetry discussion group met once a week during term. London When Hobsbaum moved to London, the discussion group reconstituted itself there. It is this London group that is now referred to as The Group. The London meetings started in 1955 once a week, on Friday evenings, at first at Hobsbaum's flat and later at the house of Edward Lucie-Smith. The poets gathered to discuss each other's work, putting into practice the sort of analysis and objective comment in keeping with the principles of Hobsbaum's Cambridge tutor F. R. Leavis and of the New Criticism in general. Before each meeting about six or seven poems by one poet would be typed, duplicated and distributed to the dozen or so participants. There was no manifesto as such. Lucie-Smith wrote, in a letter to Hobsbaum dated November 1961: 'This is a group of poets who find it possible to meet and discuss each other's work helpfully and without backbiting or backscratching‚Ä¶we have no axe to grind -- this isn't a gang and there's no monolithic body of doctrine to which everyone must subscribe'. The poets who met included George Macbeth, Edward Lucie-Smith, Philip Hobsbaum, Peter Redgrove, Alan Brownjohn, Peter Porter and Martin Bell. Ted Hughes occasionally attended. Lucie-Smith The chairmanship of the group passed to Edward Lucie-Smith in 1959 when Hobsbaum left London to study in Sheffield. The meetings continued at his house in Chelsea, and the circle of poets expanded to include Fleur Adcock, Taner Baybars, Edwin Brock, and Zulfikar Ghose; others including Nathaniel Tarn circulated poems for comment.The University of Reading collection of papers relating to The Group Lucie-Smith and Hobsbaum edited A Group Anthology (London: Oxford University Press, 1963); in the foreword the aim is described of writing 'frank autobiographical poems' and a 'poetry of direct experience'. In the anthology's epilogue Hobsbaum writes of the importance of discussion, and the writer's need for 'community to keep him in touch with his audience.' Satire was prominent in the works of Bell, Brownjohn, and Porter. Next stages=The Belfast Group When Hobsbaum moved to Belfast in 1962 he established a similar group there, sometimes referred to as The Belfast Group. The Poets' Workshop After the publication and publicity associated with the publication of the anthology, numbers attending the weekly meetings increased, and the meetings became unworkable. In 1965 the Group was restructured, and the more formal The Poets' Workshop was established under the influence of Martin Bell.

The mountain range is the most prominent in the Tucson area, with the highest average elevation. The highest point in the Catalinas is Mount Lemmon at an elevation of above sea level and receives of snow annually. Originally known by the Tohono O'odham Nation as Babad Do'ag,Santa Catalina Mountains, Moon Handbooks: Arizona. Retrieved 2010-03-12 the Catalinas were later named in 1697 by Italian Jesuit priest Eusebio Francisco Kino in honor of St. Catherine who was the patron saint of Kino's oldest sister. The Catalinas are part of the Santa Catalina Ranger District located in the Coronado National Forest, and also include the Pusch Ridge Wilderness Area. The mountain range is considered a prominent range in the Madrean sky islands, and partially delimits the mountain ranges in the northwest of the sky island region; lower elevation bajadas associated with the Santa Cruz River Valley spread northwestwards towards Phoenix. Catalina Sky Survey (CSS), on Mt. Lemmon, is a project to discover comets and asteroids, and to search for near-Earth objects (NEOs). More specifically, CSS is to search for any potentially hazardous asteroids that may pose a threat of impact. Its southern hemisphere counterpart, the Siding Spring Survey (SSS) was closed in 2013. The Catalinas are a significant focus of recreational activity, with areas such as Sabino Canyon providing streams and perennial pools for visitors, by road access; Sabino Canyon is also a dayhiking access point. Catalina State Park in the western foothills of the Catalinas attracts visitors for its hiking opportunities and permanent pools in Romero Canyon. The village of Summerhaven on Mount Lemmon serves as a popular summer retreat from the heat of Arizona's lower deserts. Mount Lemmon Ski Valley is also notable as it is the southernmost ski destination in the United States. Other mountain ranges surrounding the Santa Cruz Valley include the Santa Rita Mountains, the Rincon Mountains, the Tucson Mountains, and the Tortolita Mountains. Name The Catalinas were originally named the \\"Sierra de las Santa Catarina\\" as depicted on a German map from 1875 and prior maps dating back to 1864. A successive map from 1890 still referred to the Catalinas as the \\"Santa Catarina Mountains.\\" However, a map from 1895 depicted the range with the name \\"Santa Catalina.\\" Various maps during the 1880s and 1890s referred to the range as either \\"Santa Catarina\\" or \\"Santa Catalina.\\" However, by 1902 the range was officially designated the \\"Santa Catalina Mountains,\\" as the General Land Office established the Santa Catalina Forest Reserve that year, encompassing 155,520 acres (later to become the Santa Catalina National Forest.) As such, the name of the range apparently morphed into the current \\"Santa Catalina Mountains\\" sometime between 1890 and 1902, but each previous version of the name always referred to the namesake St. Catherine. National Forest Following the Gadsden Purchase, Americans increasingly moved into the Arizona Territory and focused on the Catalinas in search of gold, silver, and copper beginning in the 1850s. By the late 1880s, residents of southern Arizona desired protection for the Catalinas, and the U.S. Congress authorized the President to designate specific lands around the U.S. to be removed from the public domain under the Forest Reserve Act of 1891. As mentioned above, the Santa Catalina Forest Reserve was created on July 2, 1902, and after the National Forest Service was organized in 1905, the reserve became the Santa Catalina National Forest on March 4, 1907. On July 1, 1908, it was combined with two other nearby national forests (Dragoon and Santa Rita) to create the present Coronado National Forest.

The company was founded in 1996 by K√°ri Stef√°nssonAnnouncement of deCODE launching operations, and an interview with Stef√°nsson on the company's goals, in the country's principal newspaper Morgunbla√∞i√∞, 31 May 1996. Co-founders were pediatrician Kristleifur Kristj√°nsson, who worked at the company for twenty years, and psychiatrist and poet Ernir Kristj√°n Snorrason. with the aim of using population genetics studies to identify variations in the human genome associated with common diseases, and to apply these discoveries \\"to develop novel methods to identify, treat and prevent diseases.\\"Good early summary of approach and mission is in the company's first press release, announcing the isolation of a disease gene, 25 August 1997 As of 2019, more than two-thirds of the adult population of Iceland was participating in the company's research efforts,Anna Azvolinsky, \\"Master Decoder: A Profile of K√°ri Stef√°nsson,\\" The Scientist, 1 March 2019 and this \\"population approach\\" serves as a model for large-scale precision medicine and national genome projects around the world.Daly, Mark J. ‚Äú2017 William Allan Award Introduction: K√°ri Stefansson,‚Äù American Journal of Human Genetics, vol. 102, number 3 (2018) doi:10.1016/j.ajhg.2018.01.010 deCODE is probably best known for its discoveries in human genetics, published in major scientific journals and widely reported in the international media. But it has also made pioneering contributions to the realization of precision medicine more broadly, through public engagement in large-scale scientific research; the development of DNA- based disease risk testing for individuals and across health systems; and new models of private sector participation and partnership in basic science and public health.deCODE's principal publications and its news releases since its founding are available on its website. Since 2012, it has been an independent subsidiary of Amgen and its capabilities and discoveries have been used directly in the discovery and development of novel drugs. This example has helped to spur investment in genomics and precision therapeutics by other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies.Major investments in population genomics by pharmaceutical companies since 2012 include those by Regeneron, AstraZeneca, AbbVie, Glaxo, and others.  Iceland and the population approach  In 1996, when Stefansson left a tenured position at Harvard Medical School to return to Iceland to found a genomics enterprise, nearly everything in his thinking was unproven or controversial. At the time, the causes of some rare diseases - often variations in single genes that could be found by studying small families - were beginning to be uncovered.See for example Francesco Cuca et al., \\"The distribution of DR4 haplotypes in Sardinia suggests a primary association of type I diabetes with DRB1 and DQB1 loci,\\" Human Immunology, Vol 43, Issue 4, pp 301-308 (August 1995); EM Petty et al., \\"Mapping the gene for hereditary hyperparathyroidism and prolactinoma (MEN1Burin) to chromosome 11q: evidence for a founder effect in patients from Newfoundland,\\" American Journal of Human Genetics, Vol 54, Number 6, pp 1060‚Äì1066 (June 1994); Melanie M Mahtani et al., \\"Mapping of a gene for type 2 diabetes associated with an insulin secretion defect by a genome scan in Finnish families,\\" Nature Genetics (subscription required), Volume 14, pp 90‚Äì94, (September 1996); Steinnun Thorlacius et al., \\"A single BRCA2 mutation in male and female breast cancer families from Iceland with varied cancer phenotypes,\\" Nature Genetics (subscription required), Vol 13, pp 117‚Äì119 (May 1996) Yet it was far from universally accepted that there was any significant genetic component to common/complex diseases like heart disease or type 2 diabetes with well-known behavioral and environmental risk factors; nor, even if there were, whether such variations could be found given the rudimentary technology for reading DNA.On the approach, and its doubters, see Stephen D. Moore, \\"Biotech firm turns Iceland into a giant genetics lab,\\" Wall Street Journal (subscription required), 3 July 1997 Stefansson was convinced that these existed and could be identified, but only by working at industrial scale. A decade before the term was in common use, deCODE's premise was that this was a big data problem: finding variants impacting risk in dynamic interaction with lifestyle and other factors would require studies not at the family level, but at the scale of public health. As a discovery venture in uncharted territory, the strategy was to assemble and query as much data as possible: DNA contributed by tens of thousands of people; both broad and deep medical and health data; and, crucially, comprehensive genealogies linking all these participants together.An early description of the discovery model by Stefansson and his laboratory director, Jeffrey Gulcher, in \\"Population genomics: laying the groundwork for genetic disease modeling and targeting,\\" Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (subscription required) vol 36, number 8, pp 523-7 (August 1998) In short, this required a population, with people willing to take part in research, a modern healthcare system with meaningful numbers of cases of most common diseases, and much genealogical data. Iceland, Stefansson's native country, with 270,000 people at the time, fit this description better than any other.Population and other statistics at Statistics Iceland In 1996, funded by $12 million in American venture capital, deCODE set up a laboratory and began operations.First major interview with Stefansson on the company, now up and running, in Morgunbla√∞i√∞, 24 November 1996 Within its first few years it recruited and genotyped tens of thousands of participants. It made rapid progress in creating a national genealogy database; developed a novel privacy protection system with government-supervised identity encryption; signed a landmark partnership with Swiss pharmaceutical company Roche; and mapped putative disease genes in a handful of conditions.For an overview of the company's activities and achievements in these early years, see the years 1997-2003 in the news section of its website. At the same time as it was beginning to prove its science, the company ignited a huge controversy with the proposal to create a research database - the Iceland Health Sector Database (or IHD for short) - containing copies of medical records from across the country's national health service.Gulcher and Stefansson cited polls showing public support for the IHD of 75% in \\"An Icelandic saga on a centralized healthcare database and democratic decision making,\\" Nature Biotechnology (subscription required), volume 17, p 620, July 1999. In December 1998, with lobbying from deCODE, the Icelandic Parliament passed the Act on Health Sector Database which permitted public bidding for the right of a company to create this health database and use it for commercial research and to support the national health system.J Gulcher and K Stefansson, \\"The Icelandic Healthcare Database and Informed Consent,\\" New England Journal of Medicine, vol 342, pp 1827-1830 (June 2000) The parliament shortly thereafter granted deCODE the right to create this database after the company made a successful bid to do so.Chadwick, R. (1999). \\"The Icelandic database‚Äîdo modern times need modern sagas?\\". BMJ. 319 (7207): 441‚Äì444. doi:10.1136/bmj.319.7207.441. PMC 1127047\\\\. PMID 10445931. Widely supported by the public and parliament, the IHD's openly commercial aims, and proposed inclusion of medical records data unless individuals opted out, unleashed vehement opposition played out in the local and international media, led by a group of Icelandic activists as well as a number of foreign bioethicists.Opponents of the IHD created an organization called Mannvernd to fight it and to encourage people to exercise their right to opt-out. The number of opt-outs provides one concrete measure of opposition to the idea as well as, conversely, a measure of how many people either favored the idea or held no strong opinion. According to an archived snapshot of Mannvernd's website from September 2003, in the five years following the passage of the law authorizing the IHD, just over 20,000 people had opted out, or 7% of a 2003 population of 288,000. Although the IHD was never built, the debate underscored the political challenges involved in enlisting an entire society in a scientific enterprise, especially one with the explicit aim of commercializing its discoveries.Books and major research articles by bioethicists and other opponents of the IHD and commercial genomics include: Mike Fortun, Promising genomics: Iceland and deCODE genetics in a World of speculation (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2008); David Winickoff, \\"Genome and nation: Iceland's Health Sector Database and its legacy,\\" Innovations: Technology Governance Globalization, vol 1, number 2, pp 80-105 (February 2006); Henry T. Greely, \\"Iceland's plan for genomics research: Facts and implications,\\" Jurimetrics (subscription required) vol 40, number 2, pp 153-91 (Winter 2000); and Jon Merz, \\"Iceland, Inc?: On the ethics of commercial population genomics\\", Social Science & Medicine vol 58, number 6, pp 1201-9 (April 2004). Apart from Mannvernd's, another website hosted in Berkeley, California was devoted to the anthropological implications of deCODE and genetics research in Iceland. It also ensured that deCODE and its approach went from being a peripheral curiosity to one of the highest profile enterprises in the global effort to understand the human genome.Hundreds of articles were written for and against the IHD and deCODE and its approach. A glimpse of the tenor and sheer number of these can be found in an archived view from May 1999 of the website of Mannvernd, the Icelandic organization formed to oppose the IHD, and in a highly detailed bibliography created by Dr Sk√∫li Sigur√∞sson, a leading member of Mannvernd.  Genome of a Nation  By the time Bill Clinton and Tony Blair announced the completion of the first rough draft of the human genome sequence in June 2000,See archived version of the announcement in the Clinton archives deCODE was busily scaling up its gene-hunting in dozens of diseases and publishing its first discoveries.See deCODE publications from 1997-2000 on the company's website The company used the most scalable DNA-reading technology of the time - microsatellite genotyping - to place and measure highly variable and therefore informative markers at hundreds of points along the genome. Analyzed in tandem with the genealogies, this made it possible to home in on regions of specific chromosomes that people with a given disease tended to have inherited from their common ancestors.See for example an early company press release, \\"deCODE genetics of Iceland maps a gene linked to pre-eclampsia,\\" 19 September 1999 Harbored within these regions were, the thinking went, were genes or sequence variants associated with disease that could subsequently be found using finer- definition methods and tools.A good summary of the approach is in Nicholas Wade, \\"A genomic treasure hunt may be striking gold,\\" New York Times, 18 June 2002 But the main significance of these early publications was the focus on analytics and the suggestive power of the approach. Much of the field and public attention was focused on the race between the publicly funded Human Genome Project (HGP) and the private company Celera to generate the complete sequence of a single whole genome to use as a reference for future research. This was a technical challenge to generate and assemble raw data. By contrast, deCODE was advancing a strategy for analyzing variation in tens of thousands of genomes through genetics, leveraging the nature of the genome as a means of replicating and transmitting information. The power of the genetics was on full view by 2002, when deCODE published a genetic map of the genome consisting of 5000 microsatellite markers, which the genealogies made it possible to order correctly across all the chromosomes. The map was critical to correcting and completing the public reference genome sequence in 2003, improving the accuracy of the HGP assembly from 93% to 99%.A Kong et al., \\"A high resolution recombination map of the human genome,\\" Nature Genetics (subscription required), Volume 31, pp 241‚Äì247, 10 June 2002 One key to this approach has been mass participation. From its early days, over 90% of people asked to participate in deCODE's disease research have agreed to do so.Participation rate over 90% even while IHD controversy was still fresh, in deCODE's annual report from 2002 filed with the SEC, p 8; company profile in Pharmacogenomics, 4 Nov 2004 Participation is voluntary but not trivial. It requires going to a data collection center to have blood drawn, answer questionnaires, and undergo clinical examinations and tests relevant to a given disease.A good early description of how people are asked to participate and how their data is used in research is on pp 7-9 of deCODE's 2002 annual report filed with the SEC By 2003, more than 100,000 people had volunteered to take part in one or more of deCODE's three-dozen common diseases research programs.Helen Pearson, \\"Profile: Kari Stefansson,\\" Nature Medicine, volume 9, page 1099, 1 September 2003; participation rate in deCODE's annual report from 2002 filed with the SEC, p 8 This number rose to 130,000 by 2007,James Butcher, \\"Kari Stefansson, general of genetics,\\" The Lancet, 27 January 2007 and more than 160,000 by 2018. This represents two-thirds of all adult citizens. The genomes of some 60,000 of these participants had been directly sequenced by 2019, with thousands more being sequenced every month.Anna Azvolinsky, op. cit A second and unique pillar of deCODE's work is the genealogies. Geneticist Mary Claire King, whose family-based research in the early 1990s led to the discovery of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 breast cancer genes, predicted not long after deCODE's founding that the ability \\"to trace the genealogy of an entire nation...could become one of the treasures of modern medicine.\\"Michael Specter, \\"Decoding Iceland,\\" The New Yorker (subscription required), 18 January 1999 In 1997, deCODE formed a partnership with local software firm Fridrik Skulason ehf to accelerate the creation of a comprehensive, computerized national genealogy database. It drew on all available sources, from the earliest calfskin records and sagas through the 1703 census and parish records to the contemporary national registry.See Islendingabok's English wikipedia page By the early 2000s they had created what is still today the most comprehensive genealogy of an entire country. It links together all living citizens through virtually complete records back to 1703 (itself recognized by UNESCO as the world's first nominal national census) and stretches back to before the settlement of the country in the ninth century. In the research version of the database, the identities of individuals are encrypted via the same anonymization system used for DNA and medical data, so that the data can be correlated.Olga Khazan, \\"How Iceland's Genealogy Obsession Leads to Scientific Breakthroughs,\\" The Atlantic, 7 October 2014 And In 2003, deCODE launched a public-facing, online version of the database, called √çslendingab√≥k, or the Book of Icelanders. Anyone with an Icelandic social security number could request a password and then research their family tree and see their nearest family connection to anyone else in the country. Within its first month online, more than one-third of the population had requested a password.Morgunbla√∞i√∞ on Islendingabok launch - with photo By 2020, it had over 200,000 registered users and more than 900,000 linked entries, comprising the majority of Icelanders who have ever lived. On an average day, nearly 6000 people, or close to two percent of all citizens, consult the database.Islendingabok.is, accessed as user In a country that is essentially a huge extended family with a correspondingly keen interest in how its members are related, Islendingabok has become a constant in national life and a daily and direct means of social engagement with deCODE's work. But in scientific terms, the ability to understand the precise genealogical relationships of all participants in its research projects has given deCODE an abiding advantage as a discovery enterprise, ensuring that its genomic and medical datasets have remained among the largest and best powered collections anywhere.Meg Tirrell, \\"Iceland‚Äôs genetic goldmine,\\" CNBC, 6 April 2017 At each successive advance in technology for reading DNA the genealogies have amplified both the amount of data that can be generated from them as well as the power to extract information from the data.Yekaterina Vaydylevich, \\"Iceland study provides insights into disease, paves way for large-scale genomic studies,\\" online news item for National Human Genome Research Institute, 1 May 2015 In the era of microsatellites, it was possible to establish that participants shared certain markers and segments of the genome not by chance but by descent. With the advent in the mid-2000s of genotyping chips, which could measure hundreds of thousands of single-letter variations (SNPs) across the genome, deCODE statisticians were able to accurately phase segments of the genome - to understand the parental source of segments - and then impute genotypes measured in some people across the entire population.A Kong et al., \\"Detection of sharing by descent, long-range phasing and haplotype imputation,\\" Nature Genetics, Vol. 40, Number 9, pp 1068‚Äì1075 (August 2008) This effectively multiplies the size and power of any study. When Illumina began selling machines that could economically sequence whole genomes, deCODE was able to directly sequence several thousand Icelanders and then impute whole genome sequence (WGS) data for virtually the entire population. This represents one of the largest single collections of WGS data in the world, and the first results of its analysis were published in 2015 in a special edition of Nature Genetics.\\"The Genomes of Icelanders,\\" Nature, permanent link, 25 March 2015 The direct sequencing of tens of thousands of more people since then has enabled routine searches for ever rarer variants at an unprecedented scale.DO Arnar and R Palsson, \\"Genetics of common complex diseases: a view from Iceland,\\" European Journal of Internal Medicine, Vol. 40, pp 3-9 (2017)  Discoveries and scientific contributions  Genome research in general, and deCODE's global reputation as a discovery organization, took off with the arrival of SNP genotyping chips in the mid-2000s.T LaFramboise, \\"Single nucleotide polymorphism arrays: a decade of biological, computational and technological advances,\\" Nucleic Acids Research, vol 37, issue 13, pp 4181-93 (2009) doi:10.1093/nar/gkp552 These tools set off a worldwide boom in genome-wide association studies (GWAS), in which the entire genome is be scanned to identify SNPs that those with a given disease tend to have one version of, while unaffected individuals tend to have another. In common diseases, as with many traits or phenotypes such as drug response, the difference is not one of causal certainty but of statistical odds representing increased or decreased risk versus the population average. The ability to conduct large studies and analyze the resulting data - from thousands of patients with a disease and many times more control subjects, ideally unaffected relatives - is therefore at a premium.An overview of the approach and scale of field in J Macarthur et al., \\"The new NHGRI-EBI Catalog of published genome-wide association studies (GWAS Catalog),\\" Nucleic Acids Research, vol 45, issue D1, pp D896‚ÄìD901 (January 2017) deCODE's vast collection of DNA, medical and genealogical data that could be mined together - and enriched through repeated querying and imputation - was almost perfectly suited to this type of study. Since 2003, the company has discovered and published hundreds of variants linked to susceptibility to scores of diseases and conditions, including major ongoing contributions to understanding inherited risk for Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders; a dozen common forms of cancer; coronary artery disease, stroke atrial fibrillation and the other most common cardiovascular diseases; as well as traits and phenotypes ranging from drug response to cognition and hair and eye color.List of hundreds of the company's main publications on the publications page of its website. The company publishes its discoveries in peer-reviewed journals, and many, such as the TCF7L2 variants in type 2 diabetes, are used as standard risk markers in polygenic risk modeling and in research.See for example, S Srinivasan et al., \\"TCF7L2 Genetic Variation Augments Incretin Resistance and Influences Response to a Sulfonylurea and Metformin: The Study to Understand the Genetics of the Acute Response to Metformin and Glipizide in Humans (SUGAR-MGH),\\" Diabetes Care, vol 41, number 3, pp 554-561 (2018); AV Khera et al., \\"Genome-wide polygenic scores for common diseases identify individuals with risk equivalent to monogenic mutations,\\" Nature Genetics, vol 50, pp 1219‚Äì1224 (2018) A review of the GWAS era published in Nature Communications in 2019 quantified deCODE's outsized contribution to the field: Icelanders accounted for 12% of all participants in all published GWAS studies globally between 2007 and 2017, with each citizen participating on average to 19 published findings in that period alone.Table 2 in MC Mills and CA Rahal, \\"A scientometric review of genome-wide association studies,\\" Nature Communications Biology, vol 2, number 9 (2019) Stefansson, deCODE's research chief Unnur Thorsteinsdottir, and statistician Gudmar Thorleifsson were respectively ranked the first-, second- and sixth-highest impact GWAS authors in the world.Table 4, Mills and Rahal, op. cit Adding whole-genome sequencing (WGS) on top of its genotyping data gave a new dimension and power to deCODE's discovery capabilities. By definition, the common SNPs on standard genotyping chips yielded reliable risk markers but not a determinant foothold in the biology of complex diseases. Yet by running the company's growing number of directly sequenced whole genomes through the genotyping data and genealogies as a scaffold, the company's statisticians have been able to impute very high definition WGS on the entire population. The result has been the ability to conduct GWAS studies using from 20 to 50 million variants, and to systematically search for rare variants that either cause or confer very high risk of extreme versions of common phenotypes, and thereby pointing directly to putative drug targets.An early overview and 20 million SNPs were put in the public domain in DF Gudbjartsson et al., \\"Sequence variants from whole genome sequencing a large group of Icelanders,\\" Nature Scientific Data, vol 2, art 150011 (March 2015); dozens of subsequent papers using this scale of data are on the publications page of deCODE's website from 2015 onward The value of this approach is best known from the model of PCSK9, in which the study of families with extremely high cholesterol levels and early-onset heart disease led to an understanding of the key role of this gene and the development of a new class of cholesterol-fighting drugs. deCODE now routinely searches for such rare variants across many phenotypes and the results have provided the basis of drug discovery and development programs.See deCODE publications from 2014-present For example, since 2016 its important contributions in cardiovascular disease include demonstrating that it is non-HDL cholesterol rather than merely LDL levels that most accurately reflect risk of heart disease;A Helgadottir et al., \\"Variants with large effects on blood lipids and the role of cholesterol and triglycerides in coronary disease,\\" Nature Genetics, vol. 48, pp 634‚Äì639 (May 2016) finding variants in the ASGR1 gene that protect against coronary artery disease;P Nioi et al., \\"Variant ASGR1 Associated with a Reduced Risk of Coronary Artery Disease,\\" New England Journal of Medicine, vol 374, pp 2131-2141 (June 2016) and defining the role of lipoprotein (a) as a major risk factor for heart attack.DF Gudbjartsson et al., \\"Lipoprotein(a) Concentration and Risks of Cardiovascular Disease and Diabetes,\\" J Am Coll Cardiol., vol. 74, number 24, pp. 2982-2994 (December 2019) As all deCODE's data sits on its servers and can be queried simultaneously, it can also be queried with remarkable speed. In 2014, a group from the Broad Institute stopped by at deCODE on its way back from Finland, where through a major research effort they had found a variant that protected carriers against type 2 diabetes. Over coffee, the deCODE team confirmed that the Finnish variant did not exist in Iceland, but that another did.The story recounted by Gina Kolata, \\"Rare mutation kills off gene responsible for diabetes,\\" New York Times, 2 March 2014 The Broad group added it to the paper announcing the discovery.J Flannick et al., \\"Loss-of-function mutations in SLC30A8 protect against type 2 diabetes,\\" Nature Genetics (subscription required), vol 46, pp 357‚Äì363 (2 March 2014) Because of its singular population resources and the questions its scientists can ask and answer, many of deCODE's most remarkable findings have been in basic science. One notable focus has been on elucidating how variation in the sequence of the genome is generated. Following its microsatellite-based genetic map of the genome in 2002, the company created and made available to the scientific community two more: one in 2010 built on 300,000 SNPs,A Kong et al., \\"Fine- scale recombination rate differences between sexes, populations and individuals,\\" Nature, vol 467, pp 1099‚Äì1103 (October 2010) and another in 2019 built on WGS data.BV Halldorsson, et al., \\" Characterizing mutagenic effects of recombination through a sequence-level genetic map,\\" Science, vol 363, issue 6425, eaau1043 (January 2019) Recombination - the reshuffling of chromosomes that takes place in the making of eggs and sperm - is a primary mechanism for generating diversity and to build these maps. Over fifteen years deCODE has published a series of breakthrough papers detailing in a real human population how recombination rate varies according to sex, age and other characteristics, and how these differences impact the generation of genomic diversity and variation of many kinds. The general picture that has emerged is that the genome is generating diversity but within certain bounds, providing a dynamic but generally stable substrate for natural selection and evolution.Roger Highfield, \\"How humans evolve,\\" UK Science Museum blog, 24 January 2019 To understand the population that it is working in and to address broader questions few can in the same way, deCODE has also from its early days had its own genetic anthropology group. It has published pioneering work on mitochondrial and Y-chromosome mutation to trace the Norwegian and Celtic mix in the early population; sequenced ancient DNA from the settlement period; compared ancient and modern Icelandic genomes to see how genetic drift, epidemics and natural disasters have yielded a modern-day population genetically distinct from its forbears and source populations.S Ebenesersdottir et al., \\"Ancient genomes from Iceland reveal the making of a human population,\\" Science, vol. 360, issue 6392, pp. 1028-1032 (June 2018) and observed variants under positive natural selection in a present-day society.H Stefansson et al., \\"A common inversion under selection in Europeans,\\" Nature Genetics, vol 37, pp 129‚Äì137 (16 January 2005) The company has also catalogued human knockouts - people missing certain genes - and reconstructed the genome of the first man of African descent to live in Iceland by analyzing the sequences of hundreds of his living descendants.A Jagadeesan et al., \\"Reconstructing an African haploid genome from the 18th century,\\" Nature Genetics, vol 50, pp 199‚Äì205 (January 2018) These studies are avidly followed by foreign and Icelandic media alike, and constitute another type of return that deCODE renders to the society it studies and works within.  Product innovation  deCODE's scientific leadership over more than twenty years has enabled it repeatedly to pioneer new types of partnerships, products and applications for many aspects of precision medicine. Between 1998 and 2004, the company signed high-profile and innovative partnerships with pharmaceutical companies Roche, Merck, Bayer, Wyeth and others. These alliances provided research funding to advance deCODE's work, with goals of finding genetically validated new drug targets in common diseases; to develop DNA-based diagnostics, that could gauge risk of disease or predict drug response and identify patients most likely to benefit from a drug; and to design \\"information-rich\\" clinical trials that would enroll participants with particular genetic variants, with the potential to make trials smaller, more informative, and with a greater chance of success.Brief summary of the company's collaborations and business lines in its 2005 10K, pp. 9-10 In 2002, deCODE acquired a Chicago-based medicinal chemistry company in order to discover compounds based on its genetics discoveries and so to begin to develop its own pipeline of new drugs.\\"DeCode to Acquire MediChem Life Sciences in $84M Stock Deal,\\" Genomeweb, 8 January 2002 Over the next few years the company initiated and completed several early-stage clinical trials for potential new treatments for heart attack, peripheral artery disease, and conducted work with partners on asthma and SMA.Company press release, \\"deCODE genetics, Inc. Provides Product Development Update -- CEP-1347, DG041, DG031, DG051,\\" republished in Biospace, 26 June 2006 These were early examples of what would today be called 'precision medicine' programs: using genetics for target discovery and to select trial participants by testing them for disease susceptibility through the same pathway targeted by the drug.H Hakonsarson et al., \\"Effects of a 5-Lipoxygenase‚ÄìActivating Protein Inhibitor on Biomarkers Associated With Risk of Myocardial Infarction: A Randomized Trial,\\" JAMA, vol 293, issue18, pp 2245‚Äì2256 (May 2005) In the mid-2000s, deCODE launched a new kind of risk diagnostic focused largely on prevention and wellness. These DNA- based diagnostic tests detected genetic variants identified by deCODE and others that correlated with significantly increased individual risk of common diseases including heart attack,Company press release, \\"deCODE Launches deCODE MI‚Ñ¢ ‚Äì A Test for a Major Genetic Risk Factor for Early-onset Heart Attack,\\" 11 October 2007 atrial fibrillation and stroke, type 2 diabetes, common (non- BRCA) breast cancer, prostate cancer and glaucoma.A list of the tests and example of how their utility was described in company press release, \\"deCODE Launches deCODE BreastCancer‚Ñ¢, a Genetic Test to Screen for Risk of the Most Common Forms of Breast Cancer,\\" 8 October 2008 The type 2 diabetes test, for example, was based on published studies that showed that approximately 10% of people carried two copies of deCODE's highest impact risk variant, putting them at twice the average risk of developing diabetes, independent of obesity. The medical purpose of the test was \\"to identify prediabetics at higher than average risk of progressing to full-blown diabetes, and that these same individuals can effectively counteract this added risk through weight loss and through the use of certain medications.\\"Company press release, \\"deCODE Launches deCODE T2‚Ñ¢, a Novel DNA-based Test for Assessing Inherited Risk of Type 2 Diabetes,\\" 15 April 2007 Another novel characteristic of these tests was the integration of multiple, well-validated genetic risk factors. The overall impact of these different risk factors was combined and calculated into what was called a polygenic risk score, placing the individual on a spectrum of risk with regard to that of the population in general, independent of and in addition to other health or lifestyle risk factors.Example of SNPs included in deCODEme in SNPedia With each new discovery, deCODE could broaden the risk factors tested. The idea was to make screening and prevention strategies and therapies more specific and more effective for those at higher risk, and hopefully to provide new incentive for individuals to follow through with well understood lifestyle modification such as weight loss, smoking cessation, etc.New variant added to deCODE AF in company press release, \\"deCODE Discovers Second Common Genetic Risk Factor for Atrial Fibrillation and Stroke,\\" 13 July 2009 This was the essence of what was then called personalized medicine, but because these tests were new, their medical usefulness was as yet unproven. As everyone is by definition at risk of common diseases, and doctors generally understood genetic risk only as it referred to rare diseases, the medical community approached these tests with skepticism.On continued skepticism for common disease testing even in 2019, see Ian Sample, \\"NHS abandons plan to let healthy people pay for DNA sequencing,\\" Guardian, 25 July 2019 In 2018, advocacy for the use of polygenic risk scores for identifying those at significantly increased risk of common diseases, and using whole-genome data and new algorithms to build on many early deCODE markers, began a revival.A V Khera et al., \\"Genome-wide polygenic scores for common diseases identify individuals with risk equivalent to monogenic mutations,\\" Nature Genetics, vol. 50, pp. 1219‚Äì1224 (August 2018) To judge by the intense media coverage of deCODE's discoveries, ordinary people were very certainly interested in these genetic risk factors and how they might be relevant to their health. In late 2007, the company effectively launched the field of personal genomics with its deCODEmeCompany press release, \\"deCODE Launches deCODEme‚Ñ¢,\\" 16 November 2007 direct-to-consumer (DTC) scan aimed at enabling people to better understand their risk of common diseases and use this information to stay healthy. deCODEme hit the market a day before the now widely known, Google-funded 23andMe.On deCODEme launch and 23andMe just behind, Nicholas Wade, \\"Company offers genome assessments,\\" New York Times, 16 November 2007. A year later, when Time magazine named the retail DNA test as its invention of the year, it gushed about 23andMe's links with Google but did not mention deCODE. \\"The retail DNA test,\\" Time, 29 October 2008 deCODEme's marketing emphasized its pedigree, seriousness and scientific rigor: \\"provided by a world leader in the discovery of genetic risk factors for disease...[so that its customers] benefit directly from the knowledge and experience of scientists carrying out internationally renowned research\\" (its competitors used deCODE's published variants as the basis for many of their results); with the scan processed in the same labs that had found them. By 2012, the deCODEme complete scan measured one million SNPs and calculated risk for 47 common diseases and traits as well as basic information on maternal and paternal ancestry, noting that most ancestry scans of the period were not back by much data.See the archived version of deCODEme website from July 2012. Despite deCODEme's emphasis that its results were for informational purposes ‚Äî \\"a roadmap to improve your health\\" ‚Äî and the provision of genetic counseling for users who had questions about their results, US regulators quickly took a critical view of disease risk assessments being put directly in the hands of consumers.California cease-and-desist letters to testing companies in Andrew Pollack, \\"Gene Testing Questioned by Regulators,\\" New York Times, 26 June 2008 In June 2010, the FDA wrote to deCODEFDA letter to deCODE, 10 June 2010 and its main competitors to say that they considered such scans to be medical devices requiring FDA approval.FDA Letters to 23andMe, Navigenics and Knome, in Andrew Pollack, \\"F.D.A. Faults Companies on Unapproved Genetic Tests,\\" New York Times, 11 June 2010 Facing regulatory headwinds and then corporate reorganization, deCODE stopped selling deCODEme in late 2012.Turna Ray, \\"With deCODE purchase, Amgen gains expertise, consumers lose DTC testing option,\\" Genomeweb, 12 December 2012 In 2017, the FDA began to approve certain assessments of genetic risk for disease in consumer tests.FDA press release, \\"FDA allows marketing of first direct-to-consumer tests that provide genetic risk information for certain conditions,\\" 6 April 2017 In 2018, deCODE broke new ground with a direct intervention in public health and the first national genetic screening program of its kind. The company launched a website that enables anyone in Iceland to ask the company - free of charge - to search their whole genome sequence data to determine whether they are likely carriers of a SNP in the BRCA2 gene that confers high risk of breast and prostate cancer in Iceland. Within months, ten percent of the population had requested their BRCA2 status, and the National Hospital has built up its counseling and other services to help people follow up on their preliminary results and use the information to protect their health.Statistics in \\"NACG 6th Clinical workshop report,\\" Nordic Alliance for Clinical Genomics, 21 November 2018, p.9  Business  Despite its pathbreaking science, or perhaps because it was often far ahead of the field, deCODE had a volatile history as a standalone business. In July 2000, it completed a $200 million IPO on Nasdaq, big for the time and the first listing by an Icelandic company on a US exchange. Its early pharmaceutical alliances, particularly that with Roche, further helped to fund the enrollment of most of the adults in the country in the first decade of its research, and the rapid expansion of both its discovery capabilities and its product development efforts in drugs, diagnostics and personal genomics.Matthew Herper, \\"Choppy IPO for deCODE genetics\\", Forbes 19 July 2000 From a scientific perspective, as the Broad Institute's David Altschuler told the MIT Tech Review in 2004, \\"This is a business in which critical mass is important, and they have achieved critical mass.\\"Corie Lok, \\"Translating Iceland's Genes into Medicine,\\" MIT Technology Review, 1 September 2004 But the business was also about money. Being an innovation enterprise pioneering new markets, the company had spent more than $500 million on R&D; in its first decade and never been profitable. By 2006 it was borrowing more,On investment and business performance see for example deCODE's 2006 10-K filed with the SEC; Company press release, \\"deCODE genetics, Inc.

Files Voluntary Chapter 11 Petition to Facilitate Sale of Assets,\\" 17 November 2009 Its key assets - the heart of which was the Iceland genetics operation - were bought and kept running by a consortium of the company's two main original venture backers: Arch Venture and Polaris Ventures, along with Illumina, Inc., the dominant maker of genotyping chips and sequencing equipment.Nicholas Wade, \\"Out of bankruptcy, genetics company drops drug efforts,\\" New York Times, 21 January 2010 It abandoned work on its drug development programs.Emily Singer, \\"deCODE ditches drug development,\\" MIT Technology Review, 22 January 2010 As a business, deCODE had in some sense gone back to the future: it was a 13-year-old company with a global reputation, again backed by its original VCs, which Newsweek called \\"the world's most successful failure.\\"A good summary of the challenges and thinking for deCODE's revival post-bankruptcy, Mary Carmichael, \\"The world's most successful failure,\\" Newsweek, 11 February 2010 During the following period Stefansson mused publicly that deCODE had been founded between six and ten years too early.Stefansson said six years too early to Kevin Davies, in BioIT in 2008; Kevin Davies, The $1,000 Genome: The Revolution in DNA Sequencing and the New Era of Personalized Medicine (New York: The Free Press, 2010), p. 148 The technology for accurately reading DNA with sufficient detail, he reasoned, had not arrived until the mid-2000s, leaving deCODE in debt for years of R&D; but based on findings that didn't provide a detailed enough insight into the biology of disease to swiftly create commercially compelling diagnostics and developmental drugs.Stefansson said company founded ten years too early and outlined his reasons to Victor McIlhenny in Drawing the Map of Life: Inside the Human Genome Project (London: Hachette UK, 2012) What might provide that insight was population-scale WGS data. By 2010 Stefansson was outlining how to sequence a few thousand individuals and then use imputation - powered again by the genealogies - to ensure that deCODE would be the first in the world to have anything like it.\\"For Kari Stefansson and deCODE, the diagnostics looks promising,\\" Sciencewatch, September/October 2010 In spite of its straitened circumstances, with Illumina as one of its owners the company could still receive the latest sequencing machines and reagents. In 2011, deCODE and Illumina collaborated on a paper that gave an early hint at the power of WGS imputation, turning 500 sequences into 40,000 whole genomes of data. This was enough to begin to discover rare variants, validated through replication in several other populations.Company press release on the paper, \\"deCODE Genetics, in Collaboration with Academic Colleagues and Illumina, Discovers Mutations Conferring High Risk of Ovarian Cancer,\\" 2 October 2011 Unlike common variants, mutations causing rare diseases tend to be in the regions of genes that encode proteins, providing both a direct window on disease biology and so more direct utility as drug targets. In December 2012, the American pharmaceutical company Amgen acquired deCODE for $415 million. A key rationale for the acquisition was deCODE's unique ability to use WGS data to discover rare coding variants and cause extreme versions of more common diseases. As Sean Harper, then Amgen's head of R&D; told Forbes, \\"It was really working on targets like PCSK9 [for heart disease]...that really drove home the immense value of having targets that have either been discovered or validated by the kind of human genetic analysis that Decode is a world expert in.‚ÄùMatt Herper, \\"With DeCode Deal, Amgen Aims To Discover Drugs Like We Meant To In 1999,\\" Forbes, 12 December 2012 More broadly, these capabilities could be applied to evaluate current programs as well, and within month of the acquisition deCODE had reviewed Amgen's entire pipeline. In 2018, Harper estimated that \\"just [by] having strong genetic support for half your pipeline you can improve your rate of return on R&D; investments by approximately 50%.\\"Quoted in Asher Mullard, \\"An audience with...Sean Harper,\\" Nature Reviews Drug Discovery (subscription required), vol 17, pp 10-11 (January 2018) By 2020, Amgen had brought two new cardiovascular drugs into clinical trials based directly on deCODE discoveries, which continue to be published in leading scientific journals.One targets lipoprotein (a), based on a deCODE discovery published in 2019; another targets non-HDL cholesterol building on deCODE's discovery of variants in the ASGR1 gene in 2016. See Amgen's pipeline and M. Janiszewski et al., Journal of the American College of Cardiology, Volume 73, Issue 9, Supplement 1 (March 2019)  As global model  Introducing Stefansson for the organizations at the American Society of Human Genetics annual meeting in 2017, the Broad Institute's Mark Daly observed that the meeting and the field were dominated by \\"a pervasive paradigm involving biobanks recruited with full population engagement, historical medical registry data, investments in large- scale genetic data collection and statistical methodology, and collaborative follow-up across academic and industry boundaries...[and] deCODE provided the template for this discovery engine.\\"MJ Daly, ‚Äú2017 William Allan Award Introduction,‚Äù op. cit. From its early days, deCODE's example gave fresh impetus to others hunting for disease genes in isolated communities and small populations in Sardinia, Quebec, Newfoundland, northern Sweden, Finland, and elsewhere. However deCODE was not touting the Icelandic population's \\"relative homogeneity\\" in order to find variants causing rare syndromes, but because the existence of founder mutations would help to power discovery of variants impacting common disease.On role of homogeneity and overall goals, see J Gulcher and K Stefansson, \\"Population Genomics: Laying the Groundwork for Genetic Disease Modeling and Targeting,\\" Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine, vol 36, Number 8 (1998) In terms of its relevance to global medical challenges, Iceland was not an inbred population with a high prevalence of rare syndromes but rather a European society in miniature that could be studied as a whole: not the biggest small population so much as the smallest big one. The first large country to follow deCODE's example was the UK.British scientist John Bell was particularly prescient regarding the future utility of genomics in healthcare. See John Bell, \\"The new genetics in clinical practice,\\" BMJ, vol 316, issue 7131 (14 February 1998) Iceland's experience, behind the scientific and medical value of applying the NHS's vast reach and resources to one of the most diverse populations in the world,See J Fears and G Poste, \\"Building population genetics resources using the U.K. NHS,\\" Science, vol 284, issue 5412, pp 267-8 (April 1999) informed the authorization of the UK Biobank in 2003Pallab Ghosh, \\"Will Biobank pay off?,\\" BBC, 24 September 2003 and then Genomics England in 2013.

Although with varying focuses and approaches, all of these programs were at the least implicitly inspired by deCODE's example.Catherine Offord, \\"Learning from Iceland‚Äôs Model for Genetic Research,\\" The Scientist, 31 May 2017 Other large projects led by pharmaceutical companies have closely followed deCODE's model and its work with Amgen. These include Regeneron's with the Geisinger health system in the US,Press release, \\"Regeneron and Geisinger Health System announce major human genetics research collaboration,\\" regeneron.com, 13 January 2014 and Astra Zeneca's hybrid public/private/academic partnership with the Wellcome Trust in the UK, Craig Venter's Human Longevity in California, and Finngen in Helsinki.Heidi Ledford, \\"AstraZeneca launches project to sequence 2 million genomes,\\" Nature, 22 April 2016 The latter, founded by Broad Institute leaders and Finnish universities, the health ministry, and biobanks to drive drug discovery,See, for example, Mark Daly's faculty page as director of the Institute for Molecular Medicine at the University of Helsinki is remarkably close to deCODE's original vision in Iceland but with academics and government bodies as equity partners in the business. This public-private partnership model may explain the passage of legislation in Finland in 2019 authorizing the near wholesale use of anonymized medical records, social welfare data and biobank samples for biomedical research, which goes well beyond the ambitions of the 1998 IHD legislation that caused so much controversy in Iceland twenty years earlier.ES Hautam√§ki and J Lilja, \\"Secondary use of health data ‚Äì the new Finnish Act,\\" Insights blog, Roschier.com, 19 November 2019 deCODE's direct involvement and lineage is also evident across the field. deCODE is a founding member and leader of the Nordic Society of Human Genetics and Precision Medicine, which brings together the resources of all the Scandinavian countries and Iceland and Estonia to advance gene discovery and the application of precision medicine across the region. In 2013, a group of deCODE alumni created a spinoff, NextCODE Health (now Genuity Science), that licensed and further developed informatics and sequence data management tools originally developed in Iceland to support clinical diagnostics and population genomics in other countries.Press release, \\"NextCODE Health Launches Operations with Exclusive License to Leverage deCODE genetics' Genomics Platform for Sequence-Based Clinical Diagnostics, and $15 Million in Venture Financing,\\" PRNewswire, 23 October 2013 Its systems and tools have been used by national genome projects in England,See Vivien Marx, \\"DNA of a Nation,\\" Nature, vol 524, pp 503‚Äì505 (August 2015) Qatar,Press release, \\"Sidra Selects WuXi NextCODE to Power Population Genomics and Precision Medicine in Qatar,\\" PRNewswire, 6 October 2015 Singapore;Allison Proffitt, \\"WuXi NextCODE Chosen To Support Singapore Precision Medicine Pilot,\\" BioIT World, 5 January 2017 pediatric rare disease programs in the UK, USC Brownstein, et al., \\"If I knew then what I know now: The need for infrastructure to enable precision medicine,\\" Vector (Boston Children's Hospital blog), 14 August 2017 and China;\\"DNA of a nation,\\" op. cit.; \\"WuXi NextCode, Fudan Children's Hospital Collaborate on Rare Disease Diagnostics,\\" Genomeweb, 16 September 2015 and at its subsidiary Genomics Medicine Ireland.

This effort marked the company's deepest and most direct ever involvement in public health and constitutes an important component of one of the most intensive and successful containment strategies of any country in the early months of the global pandemic.Tests per million by country at Wiki page Template:COVID-19 testing by country; by late April, eight weeks after testing, tracing and isolation began, virtually no new cases were being detected, as can be seen on https://www.covid.is/data The response of Iceland's health authorities to the pandemic was notable for being an early, transparent and effective example of best-practice 'test, trace and isolate' epidemiological control. In late January 2020, the National Directorate of Health began testing people arriving in Iceland from high-risk areas or showing possible symptoms of infection, and, with the Department of Civil Protection and Emergency Management, activated a system to isolate anyone diagnosed with the virus and to trace and quarantine all of their contacts.The best source of information on the official response, from historical timeline to the latest data, is the government's official site, covid.is, available in Icelandic, English and many other languages. The Wikipedia page COVID-19 pandemic in Iceland builds on this with additional sources, links and graphics. Iceland's first case was diagnosed on February 28, a month after targeted testing began, and within days dozens of people were testing positive every day. Little more than two months later, Iceland was virtually free of active infections. See data and graphs on the official data page https://www.covid.is/data The foundation of this response and the data to guide it was testing. Yet while the official testing effort was prompt and energetic, it was focused on those who were either symptomatic or at high risk due to having likely been in contact with infected people. In early March, deCODE's CEO Kari Stefansson became concerned that without also screening the population at large there was no way to understand the virus' spread or its fatality rate, crucial information for holistically addressing the epidemic.Elizabeth Kolbert, \\"How Iceland Beat the Coronavirus,\\" The New Yorker, 1 June 2020 In this \\"all-hands-on-deck\\" moment, and with the know-how, people and equipment to rapidly turn the company's genetics research lab into a PCR diagnostic testing facilityA useful schematic of what this testing entails is in Clive Cookson and Camilla Hodgson, \\"What coronavirus tests does the world need to track the pandemic?,\\" Financial Times, 1 April 2020., he offered to put the company's capabilities to work to screen the general population under the auspices of the Directorate of Health.√û√≥runn Kristj√°nd√≥ttir, \\"‚ÄûE√∞lilegt‚Äú og ‚Äûsj√°lfsagt‚Äú a√∞ leggjast √° √°rarnar,\\" Morgunbla√∞i√∞, 6 March 2020 deCODE staff worked swiftly to put together workflows for everything from sample collection to running the tests to privacy-protected reporting, and to get the swabs and reagents ready to begin large-scale testing. On Thursday 12 March 2020, the company opened its website to book appointments for testing and within hours 12,000 people had signed up. Testing began the following morning, free of charge.\\"T√≥lf √æ√∫sund b√≥ka√∞ t√≠ma √≠ skimun,\\" Morgunbla√∞i√∞, 13 March 2020 The deCODE effort scaled up quickly to a capacity of over 1000 samples per day. From the beginning of population screening, fewer than 1% of those taking part were found to be infected, indicating that the health authorities' containment strategy was working.Press release, \\"Large scale testing of general population in Iceland underway,\\" Icelandic Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 15 March 2020. From mid-March to the end of May 2020, the company conducted an average of 600 tests a day, complementing the health authorities' 250 tests per day at the National- University Hospital, Those testing positive in deCODE's screening were similarly isolated and their contacts traced and asked to quarantine themselves. In total, by the beginning of June more than 60,000 tests had been conducted in Iceland, equivalent to 18 percent of the population. Powered by this combined testing strategy and tracing and isolation follow up, the number of infections in Iceland peaked in the first week of April and dropped steeply off by the end of the month. By mid-May, there were only a handful of active infections in the country, although deCODE and the health authorities continued to conduct as many as 200 tests per day thereafter to try to detect any fresh outbreaks.Complete statistics on testing by health authorities and deCODE by date, as well as the number of active infections, from 28 February to 14 June can be found in English at https://www.covid.is/data-old In tandem with its screening work, deCODE used its genetics capabilities to sequence the virus from hundreds of infected individuals, and to draw a kind of genealogy of the different clades of the virus in the country. This showed how during the early weeks of the pandemic the virus had entered the country with people infected in different countries and then spread within Iceland.Press release, \\"Iceland Provides a Picture of the Early Spread of COVID-19 in a Population With a Cohesive Public Health Response,\\" deCODE genetics, 14 April 2020 In April 2020, with colleagues from the Directorate of Health and the national hospital, the company published in the New England Journal of Medicine a paper detailing what the spread of Covid-19 looks like across a population, and how a robust policy of testing, tracing and isolation could effectively contain it. In May, the company began work to develop and carry out antibody testing in the population, and early results showed that around one percent of the general population that had not been diagnosed with infection carried antibodies for the virus. This meant on the one hand that the virus had been swiftly and well contained, but also that nearly three times had been infected as had been officially diagnosed since the end of February and also that the population was still more than 98% naive.\\"√ûrisvar sinnum fleiri smit en greindust,\\" Morgunbla√∞i√∞, 5 June 2020 That indicated that large-scale testing would need to continue to detect later outbreaks as the country reopened its borders to travel by its own citizens and others coming to Iceland.Dagny Hulda Erlendsd√≥ttir, \\"Mikill minnihluti landsmanna me√∞ m√≥tefni vi√∞ COVID-19,\\" RUV, 28 May 2020 In June, the company said that it was working with Amgen's unit in British Columbia to use white blood cells from recovered Icelandic Covid patients to begin to manufacture antibodies for the virus, which could be used either prophylactically or therapuetically.\\"Einka√æotan m√¶tt a√∞ s√¶kja bl√≥√∞kornin,\\" RUV, 6 June 2020 Appearances in popular culture The work of deCODE is criticised by Arnaldur Indri√∞ason's novel Jar City from 2000, which was adapted into a 2006 film of the same name.Burke, Lucy, 'Genetics and the Scene of the Crime: DeCODING Tainted Blood', Journal of Literary & Cultural Disability Studies, 6 (2012), 193‚Äì208. doi:10.3828/jlcds.2012.16. deCODE and K√°ri Stef√°nsson are satirised as VikingDNA and Professor L√°rus J√≥hannsson in Dau√∞ans √≥vissi t√≠mi by √ûr√°inn Bertelsson (Reykjav√≠k: JPV √ötg√°fu, 2004). deCODE and specifically K√°ri Stef√°nsson is presented as the creator of monstrous genetic hybrids in √ìttar M.

The family has held the noble titles of Baron Scrope of Masham, Baron Scrope of Bolton, and for a brief time, the Earl of Wiltshire. Origin of name The name (pronounced \\"Scroop\\") may be derived from the old Anglo-Norman word for \\"crab\\". Whether far-fetched or not, it is fact that at one stage the family crest was a crab (subsequently five feathers) and that the family motto is still Devant si je puis (\\"forward if I can\\"), which could have a double meaning as, of course, a crab can only go sideways. Early Scropes The first well-documented ancestor of the Yorkshire Scropes appears to be Robert le Scrope (1134 ‚Äì aft.1198), who is described as the son of the aunt\\"Matertera\\" is an ambiguous term because it could refer to a person's father's sister or mother's sister. of Alice de Gant, Countess of Northampton by her husband Richard le Scrope. The Scrope family appear to be related and allied to the Gant family in the 12th century, and possibly trace their origins to Lincolnshire or Northamptonshire.Alice de Gant married Simon de St. Liz, 7th Earl of Northampton and Huntingdon, whose paternal grandmother Maud, Countess of Huntingdon, great-niece of the Conqueror, married secondly King David I of Scotland. Alice de Gant's mother was Rohese de Clare, the daughter of Richard FitzGilbert, Lord of Clare and Adeliza de Meschines. Her father's sister (or half-sister) is not known, but the Earls of Lincoln and Chester were half-brothers, sons of a wealthy Anglo-Norman-Saxon heiress Lucy, Countess of Chester, widow of Ivo de Taillebois. (Lucy is claimed to be a descendant of Godiva, but there is no evidence of this; it is known that she made three excellent marriages). The aunt Agnes may have been an illegitimate half-sister of either Gilbert de Gant or Rohese de Clare; this would explain her marriage to a relatively obscure man. Precedents among the daughters of the later earls of Chester exist for similar differences in marriages between legitimate daughters (married to barons) and illegitimate daughters (married to mere knights). 14th-century Scropes The shield above depicts the arms of Scrope; its blazon is Azure, a bend Or. The great-great-great-grandson of Hugh was Sir William le Scrope (c.1259 ‚Äì c. 1311) of Bolton, in Wensleydale, Yorkshire, who had two sons, Henry le Scrope (died 1336) and Geoffrey le Scrope (died 1340), both of whom were in succession chief justice of the king's bench and prominent supporters of the court in the reign of King Edward II of England. Richard le Scrope (c. 1327 ‚Äì 1403) : Henry was father of Richard Scrope, 1st Baron Scrope of Bolton (c. 1327 ‚Äì 1403), chancellor of England, an active adherent of John of Gaunt. William le Scrope (c. 1350 ‚Äì 1399) : His eldest son William le Scrope (c. 1350 ‚Äì 1399) was created Earl of Wiltshire in 1397 by Richard II, of whose government he was an active supporter. Wiltshire bought the sovereignty of the Isle of Man from the Earl of Salisbury. In 1398 he became Treasurer of England. His execution at Bristol was one of the first acts of Henry IV, and the irregular sentence of an improvised court was confirmed by Henry's first parliament. Wiltshire' father, Lord Scrope, and his other sons were not included in the attainder, but received full pardon from Henry. Scrope, who was the builder of Bolton Castle, his principal residence, died in 1403. He was succeeded in the barony by his second son, Roger, whose descendants held it till 1630. Geoffrey le Scrope (d. 1340) Sir Geoffrey le Scrope (died 1340), chief justice of the kings bench as mentioned above, uncle of the first Baron Scrope of Bolton, had a son Henry, who in 1350 was summoned to parliament by writ as Baron Scrope, the designation of Masham being added in the time of his grandson to distinguish the title from that held by the elder branch of the family. Henry's fourth son was Richard le Scrope (c. 1350 ‚Äì 1405), Archbishop of York, who took part with the Percies in opposition to Henry IV, and was beheaded for treason in June 1405. Despite this, Henry Scrope, 3rd Baron Scrope of Masham (c. 1376 ‚Äì 1415), became a favorite of Henry V, by whom he was made treasurer in 1410 and employed on diplomatic missions abroad. However, in 1415 he was involved in a conspiracy to assassinate Henry (along with the King's cousin Richard of Conisburgh, 3rd Earl of Cambridge) and was ignominiously executed at Southampton. His title was forfeited. It was, however, restored to his brother John in 1455; and it fell into abeyance on the death, in 1517, of Geoffrey, 11th Baron Scrope of Masham, without male heirs. 16th- and 17th-century Scropes John Scrope, 8th Baron Scrope of Bolton was a somewhat reluctant supporter of the Pilgrimage of Grace, a northern uprising in protest at the reforms of Henry VIII but incurred the king's displeasure when he allowed sanctuary to Adam Sedbar, Abbot of Jervaulx who was on the run from the King's Commissioners. Scrope was himself obliged to seek refuge in Skipton castle and the King's men fired his Bolton castle residence. Abbot Sedbar was caught and executed. His son Henry Scrope, 9th Baron Scrope of Bolton (1534‚Äì1592), was governor of Carlisle in the time of Elizabeth I, and as such took charge of Mary, Queen of Scots, when she crossed the border in 1568; and he took her to Bolton Castle, where she remained till January 1569. His son, Sir Thomas Scrope, 10th Baron Scrope of Bolton, was Warden of the West March in the Anglo-Scottish border country and governor of Carlisle in 1596 when Walter Scott, the \\"Bold Buccleuch\\", staged his raid on Carlisle to rescue the reiver Kinmont Willie Armstrong. He was the father of Emanuel Scrope, 11th baron (1584-1630), who was created Earl of Sunderland in 1627; on his death without legitimate issue in 1630 the earldom became extinct, and the immense estates of the Scropes of Bolton were divided among his illegitimate children, the chief portion (including Bolton Castle) passing by marriage to the Marquess of Winchester, who was created Duke of Bolton in 1689; to the Earls Rivers; and to John Grubham Howe, ancestor of the Earls Howe. The barony of Scrope of Bolton seems then to have become dormant; and although the title might, it would appear, have been claimed through the female line by the representative of Charles Jones (d. 1840) of Caton, Lancashire, no such claim was ever made. From Stephen, third son of the 1st Baron Scrope of Bolton, were descended the Scropes of Castle Combe, Wiltshire, the last of whom was William Scrope (1772‚Äì1852), an artist, author and fly-fishing enthusiast, who was an intimate friend of Sir Walter Scott. His daughter Emma Phipps Scrope, married George Poulett Thompson (1797‚Äì1876), an eminent geologist and prolific political writer, who took the name of Scrope, and who after his wife's death sold Castle Combe, of which he wrote a history. Probably from the same branch of the family was descended Col. Adrian Scrope, or Scroope (1601-1660) the Regicide, who was prominent on the parliamentarian side in the Civil War, and one of the signatories of Charles I's death warrant. Colonel Scrope was grandson of Adrian Scrope of Wormsley, who was (approximately) third son of John Scrope (d. 1547) of Spennithorne, Yorkshire, and Hambleden, Bucks, who was the younger son of the 6th Lord Scrope (c1468-1506) by Lady Eliz. Percy daughter of Henry Percy, 3rd Earl of Northumberland. John Scrope was Adrian Scrope's grandson and the last Scrope of Wormsley and Bristol. The Chiltern estate at Wormsley was inherited by one of John Scrope's nephews; one of the brothers of Thomas Fane, 8th Earl of Westmorland. Descendants The male line of the Scrope family still exists but it has for centuries now been known simply as \\"Scrope of Danby\\", with no hereditary titles left to its name. Although Bolton Castle is still owned by descendants of the Scrope family, they do not have the name of Scrope, being descendants through the female line of the Duchess of Bolton. The present senior male of the family, or Head of the House, is Simon Richard Henry ('Harry') Scrope (b. 1974), only son of Simon Egerton Scrope of Danby (1934-2010), by his wife (Jennifer) Jane Parkinson, a granddaughter maternally of the 1st and last Baron Bingley. The next heir male is his father's cousin Henry John Scrope (b. 1941), eldest son of the late Ralph Henry Scrope by his wife Lady Beatrice Savile, 2nd daughter of the 6th Earl of Mexborough. Other Scropes have also married in the 20th century into aristocratic families such as the Cochrane family, the Ward family, the Davies family, the Sykes family of Sledmere and many landed gentry families.

It was developed at a time when Native American sovereignty and the right to establish gaming casinos on reservations had survived court challenges. Development of the casino was opposed from within and outside the OIN. As a fall-back plan, the OIN had the casino designed so that it could be adapted as a small shopping mall, if necessary. Ultimately, the OIN decided not to add a shopping mall because online shopping has diminished patronage to shopping malls.\\"Jackpot: Conventions become a bigger part of casino business\\", Empire Monthly The land upon which the casino is located was acquired from Ibrahim Batca and his family in two transactions in 1992 and 1993.Deeds on file in the Oneida County Clerk's Office in Book of Deeds, volume 2627, page 94 and Book of Deeds volume 2657, page 653 Construction of an on-site hotel and a bingo hall began in 1994. The Bingo Hall's construction was completed in 1995. Disagreements over the hotel plans delayed its construction for a year. The hotel's original design plans had the hotel and casino separate, connected only by an outdoor walkway. Because of the delay, the hotel plans were re-designed to combine the hotel and casino into one structure. This new design allowed the Oneida Indian Nation to offer more services, including a pool, a spa, and a gym. Additionally, the combination created a larger and more formal lobby to serve both the hotel and casino to be one structure. In 1997 the OIN paid for construction of a water tower near the casino and donated it to the Town of Verona, as one of their community contributions. The water tower has a capacity to hold 1,000,000 gallons of water. In 2005 the OIN consumed 600,000 gallons per day, which was four times the amount guaranteed to them under an agreement with the Town of Verona. In about July 2005 the Town of Verona notified the OIN that after 5:00 p.m. on August 2, 2005, the water would be shut off after the tribe had used the 150,000 gallons of water that is guaranteed under the agreement. Just hours before this deadline, the OIN began paying for a new water pump to be installed to provide the needed water capacity for the casino and resort.Oneida Indian Nation Water Pump , Madison County website In 2002 construction of a gaming expansion and showroom were completed to provide the only Ticketmaster-approved venue in the area.\\"Tribe to give workers a bonus\\", Times Union, 30 January 2005 The popularity of the casino provided sufficient revenue for the OIN to build second and third hotels at the site to satisfy demand. Construction of the new hotel was finished in late 2004. One of the hotels is the tallest structure between Syracuse and Albany to serve the common guest; the other hotel is a luxury resort that caters to golf customers and fans.\\"Gaming aside, the Oneidas are betting on golf\\", Boston.com, 18 April 18, 2004 DeSimone Consulting Engineers is the structural engineering firm for the project. Entertainment The Turning Stone Casino and Resort hosted NESN and YES Network's Boston vs. New York Poker Challenge for two seasons. The casino hosts several shows throughout the year, featuring musicians (KISS, Kelly Clarkson, Carrie Underwood, Fergie, Mariah Carey, Gwen Stefani, No Doubt, Jordin Sparks, Alicia Keys & Wayne Newton), comedians and other entertainment groups (Purrrfect Angels). The Irish Rovers played their two 2014 St Patrick's Day Concerts at the resort. The resort's Atunyote Golf Club, located on tribal land, hosted the Turning Stone Resort Championship, a PGA Tour event, from 2007 through 2010. It was dropped from the tour schedule over a 2011 scheduling dispute. In 2006, it hosted the B.C. Open on the PGA Tour in July and the PGA Professional National Championship, which returns in 2016. Legal issues The casino's early success met opposition from New York State, Oneida County, Madison County, Vernon town government, and a citizens' group called Upstate Citizens for Equality (UCE). Several lawsuits were commenced that challenged the casino's legal authority to operate. The tribal-state gaming compact Until the November 5, 2013 election that amended the New York State Constitution, state law prohibited gambling, particularly class III gaming. The OIN wanted to take advantage of expanding the original bingo hall into a full casino, which would include Class III gaming. To do so, OIN negotiated a gaming compact with then Governor Mario Cuomo in 1993; a prerequisite to creating an Indian casino pursuant to the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA). UCE challenged the compact's validity because the state legislature failed to approve the compact, pursuant to the New York State Constitution.Peterman v Pataki, 4 Misc3d 1028A, 798 NYS2d 347 [Sup Ct] In Pataki, the New York State Supreme Court held that despite Cuomo's representation and belief that legislative approval was unnecessary, the compact was not valid because the state legislature had not approved the same. The OIN appealed this decision to the Appellate Division, which affirmed the lower court. The Appellate Division granted leave to appeal to the Court of Appeals, which affirmed the Appellate Division's decision. After the Court of Appeals decision, the OIN petitioned the US Supreme Court to review the decision, but the high court denied certiori. The OIN argued that the US Secretary of the Interior approved the compact and that removed the need for the state legislature's approval. The IGRA incorporates state laws into federal law. Specifically, provides \\"for purposes of Federal law, all State laws pertaining to the licensing, regulation, or prohibition of gambling, . . . shall apply in Indian country in the same manner and to the same extent as such laws apply elsewhere in the State.\\"18 USC Sec. 1166 Gambling in Indian country The Tenth Circuit held that the Secretary of the Interior's approval of a gaming compact has no impact on its validity because state law controls whether a gaming compact is valid.\\"Mescalero Apache Tribe v State of New Mexico, 131 F.3D 1379 [10th Cir. 1997] However, to date, the Second Circuit has not adopted this view in regards to the validity of a compact.http://www.upstate-citizens.org/NY-v-OIN.pdf The Pataki case was a state court action, and did not receive review in the Second Circuit. The OIN then sought relief with the U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI) Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). After many failed attempts to negotiate a settlement by an April 2007 deadline, the Department of the Interior launched its own investigation into the compact's validity. On June 13, 2007 when the Associate Deputy Secretary of the Interior declined to reconsider its approval of the compact, Mr. Cason stated, \\"the 1993 Compact continues to be in effect for purposes of the IGRA\\".Department of the Interior letter to the Oneida Nation In UCE's lawsuit against the DOI, UCE challenged the DOI's decision regarding the compact's validity in addition to its challenge of the DOI's decision to take land into trust for the OIN.Complaint The US Interior Department's position was that the June 13, 2007 correspondence was not the end of it reconsidering the validity of the tribal-state compact, but merely a suspension of its reconsideration.USDOI Reply \\"The one page letter does not reflect a substantive deliberation reconsidering DOI‚Äôs former approval but rather a simple notice to the concerned parties that the reconsideration process has been indefinitely suspended.\\" On August 7, 2007, in an action between New York State and the OIN, U.S. District Court Judge Kahn upheld Magistrate Treece's order directing the depositions of high-ranking officials and denying the State's motions. The decision also dismissed the Amended Complaint pleading, which attacked the Board's authority to amend the Compact due to Peterman and Seneca, on subject matter jurisdiction grounds. The fact that the amended complaint was dismissed on jurisdictional grounds deprived the court of the opportunity to address, directly, the compact's validity at the federal level. If the compact was invalid, then the Oneida Indian Nation would be violating federal law (operating a gaming facility without a tribal- state compact).see Indian Gaming Regulatory Act Such a violation of federal law would have provided the requisite subject matter jurisdiction (federal question) to address the amended complaint. Even though the State sought to enjoin the Nation from operating Instant Multi Game (\\"IMG\\") based on its failure to adhere to the procedures in the Compact,see 28 U.S.C.A. ¬ß 1331, Upstate Citizens for Equality website (page 5 left column), the state has since dropped this case.Syracuse.com blog In 2013, the OIN, New York State, and Madison and Oneida Counties reached a landmark agreement that resolved the ongoing issues regarding the tribal-state compact, taxing issues, and the land upon which the resort casino is built. 2013 landmark agreement The agreement also ended all litigation pending between the three entities at the time of the agreement. Casino location site legality In addition to whether the tribe-state gaming compact was valid, the other issue was whether the location chosen to conduct the gaming was legal. New York State Law forbade Class III gaming on lands within New York State. The casino was located on Indian Territory as defined in the IGRA. However, the issue was compounded in light of the City of Sherrill v Oneida Indian Nation US Supreme Court decision.City of Sherrill v. Oneida Indian Nation of N.Y. The DOI stated \\"compact does not specifically refer to the site where ... the Nation has built a major new facility in anticipation of being able to conduct gaming in the future. Since the compact tracks the [IGRA's definition of 'Indian lands'], we ... take no position with regard to whether this new facility is on 'Indian land' as that term is used in IGRA\\".DOI letter regarding gaming site Justice Ginsburg opined that although the land was part of the original tribal land grant of the 1796 Treaty of Canadagua, 200+ years in non-Indian control was too long a time for the Oneida Indian Nation to re-establish its immunity over those lands once it re-acquired the ownership of those lands. As directed in the Sherrill decision, the OIN applied to the DOI to have this land taken into trust, which was approved and formalized on September 4, 2014.For more information on this application see the Oneida Indian Nation page. Gaming issues resolved On May 2013, the OIN, New York State, and Madison and Oneida Counties reached a landmark agreement that resolved the gaming compact issue, among other issues needing resolution. As part of the agreement, the state held a referendum to amend the New York State Constitution to allow for full gambling casinos to operate within the state, which passed on November 5, 2013.Casino Gambling Referendum Approved The agreement paved the way for the OIN to open two more casinos within its 10-county area of exclusivity. Liquor license The casino applied for several liquor licenses with the New York State Liquor Authority (Liquor Authority) in 2007 that were denied on October 3, 2007.Turning Stone liquor deal 'very lucrative'\\"State denies all 6 Nation liquor license applications\\" , Utica OD After delaying a decision for a month, the liquor board told the OIN it cannot issue permits while unsettled sovereignty issues between the OIN and the state (related to land issues) are being litigated in court. \\"The Liquor Authority said the applications were disapproved without prejudice, and the Nation can reapply for the licenses after the reservation issue is solved.\\"\\"State denies all 6 Nation liquor license applications\\" , Utica OD The licenses would have allowed the casino to serve alcohol on the gaming floor and at its several restaurants. While the applications were pending before the Liquor Authority, the resort did not allow any kind of alcohol on the premises, as part of their application.\\"Turning Stone Asks for Liquor\\", Syracuse Blog Since the Liquor Authority's denial on the applications, the OIN lifted the alcohol ban in the resort. In response, the casino reached an agreement with the Beeches Hotel And Catering Service which received multiple one-day permits to sell alcohol at the premises.Turning Stone liquor deal 'very lucrative' This generated much controversy because the Beech's owner's wife, Roan Destito sits on the committee governing liquor laws.Id.

Smoking versus non-smoking Smoking is allowed around the resort; non-smoking sections have been established and expanded in all areas. In 2016, the casino and resort underwent a $20 million upgrade and renovation project to provide better smoke-free areas on the gambling floor, and improve ventilation facilities to enhance all non-smoking zones within the resort and casino.Turning Stone To Limit Smokers To Own Mini- Casino; $20 Million Project To Upgrade Awards and recognitions Since 2001, Turning Stone has received more than 480 different awards and recognitions.Awards & Accolades, Turning Stone Resort Casino, Retrieved 18-05-2018.

Although the council was not permanent, it was the first representational form of democracy in the Dutch colony. The next two councils created were known as the Eight Men and the Nine Men Background The Dutch West India Company had incurred significant expenses building and manning fortifications. Kieft sought to offset some of the cost by demanding contribution from the Indians, whom he saw as deriving protection from rival tribes. They declined, pointing out that the Dutch had not been invited in the first place, and with the Indian settlements so scattered, by the time word reached the fort any help dispatched would be too late. In the spring of 1640, some Raritan Indians attacked a Company trading boat near Staten Island and stole a canoe. They were subsequently mistakenly blamed for the theft of some pigs from the farm of David Pietersz. de Vries. Kieft sent Cornelis van Tienhoven with a force of seventy soldiers and sailors to demand payment. The Raritan declined to pay for pigs that they had not taken. As the meeting broke up, the Dutch suddenly attacked, killing a few Raritan, capturing several and routing the rest. Within six weeks the Raritan responded by burning De Vries' house and tobacco sheds. Four colonists died. Kieft spread word to several other tribes that he would pay a bounty in wampum for every head of a Raritan brought to him. A peace was reached by the end of the year.Henri and Barbara Van Der Zee. A Sweet and Alien Land, Viking Press, New York, 1978 In August 1641, a Weckquaesgeek Indian killed Claes Swits, an elderly Swiss immigrant who ran a public house frequented by settlers and Indians alike at Turtle Bay, Manhattan. As a child, the young Indian had witnessed the murder of his uncle, and upon coming of age took revenge. The Weckquaesgeek refused to hand the killer over to the Dutch. Another incident occurred at Achter Kol along the banks of the Hackensack River. Settlers and some Hackensacks had been drinking alcohol at a trading post when a conflict arose over a missing coat which ended in the death of the post's foreman.Ruttenber,E.M., Indian Tribes of Hudson's River, (Hope Farm Press, 3rd ed, 2001) Council of Twelve Kieft was determined to conduct punitive measures against the Indians, but reluctant to assume sole responsibility for the decision. In August 1641, he summoned twelve prominent settlers to New Amsterdam to advise him on relations with the Indians. He posed three questions: #Whether it is not just to punish the barbarous murder of Claes Swits committed by an Indian and, in case the Indians refuse to surrender the murderer at our request, whether it is not justifiable to ruin the entire village to which he belongs? #In what manner the same ought be put into effect and at what time? #By whom it may be undertaken?

They then requested that four of their number be elected to the Director-General's Council. Kieft was not pleased with the advice received. After months of haggling, in January 1642, Kieft told them that he would accept their request if they, in turn, would support his proposed war. The Council reluctantly agreed.\\"The Twelve Men and Director Kieft's Indian War\\", Historical Society of the New York Courts Krieft dissolved the Council of Twelve in February 1643 and forbade them to meet with out his permission.Shorto, Russell, The Island at the Center of the World, Vintage Books (Random House) 2004, p. 120 His duplicity did nothing to reduce opposition to the war. Not all of the Twelve opposed Kieft's plan. A group of Tappan had moved to Pavonia, while a second group from east of the Hudson were at Corlears Hook. Both were seeking refuge from attacks of the Mohawk to the north. On February 24, 1643, Maryn Adriansen, Jan Jansen Damen, and Damen's step-sons-in-law Abraham Isaacsen Verplanck and Cornelis Van Tienhoven, petitioned the Director to order an immediate attack upon the two groups of refugees. Kieft readily endorsed their request. He ordered Van Tienhoven to lead the soldiers stationed at Fort Amsterdam on a raid on those sheltering at Pavonia. It took place the following night and eighty Tappan were killed. Kieft ordered Maryn Adriaensen and a band of volunteers to go to Corlear's Hook to attack the refugees there. Forty Indian men, women and children were killed there. This served to unite the various tribes against the Dutch and war broke out. The majority of the Twelve Men, most of whom who had not known of the petition, objected strongly to Kieft's actions. Kieft blamed Maryn Adriaensen, who then armed himself, went to Fort Amsterdam and attacked Kieft. Kieft was unharmed, and Adriaensen arrested. His friends managed to have him sent to Amsterdam for trial, where he was acquitted.

The term scot comes from the Old English word sceat, an ordinary coin in Anglo-Saxon times, equivalent to the later penny. In Anglo-Saxon times, a payment was levied locally to cover the cost of establishing drainage, and embankments, of low-lying land, and observing them to ensure they remain secure. This payment was typically a sceat, so the levy itself gradually came to be called sceat. In burghs, sceat was levied to cover maintenance of the town walls and defences. In Norman times, under the influence of the word escot, in Old French, the vowel changed, and the term became scot. In 19th century Kent and Sussex, low-lying farmland was still being called scot-land. Scot, though, gradually became a general term for local levies; a person who was not liable for the levy, but received its benefits, got off 'scot-free'. Lot means portion/share, hence lottery, land lot and allotment. The phrase scot and lot thus meant the local levies someone paid, and the share they received of local provisions; more generally, it meant rights and obligations, in respect of local government. In the medieval Lordship of Ireland, Frenchmen were required to pay scot and lot. Scot and lot is also mentioned in a statute of the city of Waterford: no man could enjoy the liberties of the city unless he was resident there, and paid scot and lot. Parliament had evolved from the king's baronial court, with the commons being populated by representatives of the landholders who were too minor to call in person. Burghs were somewhat outside the feudal system, making their franchise ambiguous. Before the mid 19th century, burghs varied in their choice of franchise. In some burghs, the franchise was set at scot and lot; that is, people were only permitted to vote if they were liable for the local levies. In mediaeval times, this could mean dozens of people, and by the 19th century tens of thousands of people could qualify in a single scot and lot burgh. In Gatton, however, only two people qualified under scot and lot; since burghs received 2 MPs, this meant that each MP for Gatton represented exactly 1 voter. The quirks of the existing system, such as Gatton, was one of the reasons for the 1832 Great Reform Act. There were two scot and lot boroughs in Wales: Flint Boroughs (1727‚Äì1832) and Haverfordwest. A cognate term, skat, exists in the udal law of Orkney and Shetland. References * *Danby Palmer Fry, 'On the Phrase Scot and Lot', in Trans. Philological Society (1867), pp. 167‚Äì197; *C.

The seats are low and cold to sit on; the addition of four inches of cushion makes them comfortable. In church architecture, sedilia (plural of Latin sedƒ´le, \\"seat\\") are seats, usually made of stone, found on the liturgical south side of an altar, often in the chancel, for use during Mass for the officiating priest and his assistants, the deacon and sub-deacon. The seat is often set back into the main wall of the church itself. Not all sedilia are stone; there is a timber one thought to be 15th century in St Nicholas' Church at Rodmersham in Kent. When there is only one such seat, the singular form sedile is used, as for instance at St Mary's, Princes Risborough, Buckinghamshire or at St Agatha's, Coates, West Sussex. The first examples in the catacombs were single inlays for the officiating priest. In time, the more usual number became three, although there are examples of up to five sedilia. The custom of recessing them in the thickness of the wall began about the end of the 12th century; some early examples consist only of stone benches, and there is one instance of a single seat or arm-chair in stone at Lenham in Kent. The niches or recesses into which they are sunk are often richly decorated with canopies and subdivided with moulded shafts, pinnacles and tabernacle work; the seats are sometimes at different levels, the eastern being always the highest, and sometimes an additional niche is provided in which the piscina is placed.

The injury is typically inflicted by a low- velocity gunshot to the knee pit with a handgun. The term is considered a misnomer by medical professionals because only a very small minority of victims suffer damage to the kneecap. A review of eighty kneecapping victims found that only two had a fractured kneecap. Some victims have their elbows and ankles shot as well.  Treatment  Knee injury caused by a punishment shooting The severity of the injury can vary from simple soft tissue damage to a knee joint fracture with neurovascular damage. The latter requires several weeks in hospital and intensive outpatient physiotherapy for recovery. If the damage is too great, amputation might be necessary, but this rarely occurs. In Northern Ireland thirteen people had their legs amputated as a consequence of limb punishment shootings over the duration of the Troubles. In the long term it is estimated that one out of five victims will walk with a limp for the rest of their lives.  History  During the Troubles in Northern Ireland, paramilitaries considered themselves to be law enforcers in their own areas. They used limb punishment shootings to punish drug pushers and child molesters. If the crime was considered to be grave, the victim was also shot in the ankles and elbows, leaving them with six gunshot wounds (colloquially known as a six pack). Approximately 2,500 people were victims of these punishment shootings through the duration of the conflict. Those who were attacked carried a social stigma with them. The Red Brigades, an Italian militant organization, employed these punishment shootings to warn their opponents. They used the method to punish at least 75 people up to December 1978. The Bangladesh Police have started kneecapping in the country since 2009 to punish the opposition and preventing them from participating in protests against the government. Human Rights Watch (HRW) has published a report on kneecapping in Bangladesh.

The Beat was the last car to be approved by Soichiro Honda before he died in 1991. The total number of cars produced was around 33,600. Most of the production (around two-thirds) occurred in the first year, and then production and sales fell drastically. The design of the car originated from Pininfarina, who then sold the design plan to Honda. The Beat was one of many cars designed to take advantage of Japan's tax-efficient kei car class.Needed, link dead History There were two mainstream models of the Beat (the PP1‚Äì100 and the PP1‚Äì110) and a couple of limited edition versions. Variations on the first model were just cosmetic updates. Only the second model had any real mechanical differences. All cars were offered with the option of a driver's side airbag. The car was sold exclusively in Japan at Honda Primo dealership sales channels. 1991 Honda Beat In typical Honda fashion, the Beat's engine did not utilize a turbocharger or supercharger. The engine was modified with the MTREC (Multi Throttle Responsive Engine Control) system, with individual throttle bodies for each of the three cylinders, to produce at 8100 rpm with an electronically limited top speed of 135 km/h (84 mph). Only a manual transmission was available. The MTREC design would filter down to the 1993 Honda Today kei car. The Beat was part of a wave of kei car-sized sports cars in the early 1990s; its competitors included the Suzuki Cappuccino and Mazda's Autozam AZ-1. Together they anticipated the arrival of the Smart Roadster over a decade later, while Japan would not see a new model of the genre until the 2002 Daihatsu Copen. On May 9, 2010, a parade was held in the Twin Ring Motegi circuit as a part of an annual Beat owners meeting. 569 Honda Beats participated in the parade, which is certified by Guinness World Records as the largest parade of Honda cars. The record was shown in the 2011 edition of Guinness World Records.

Located at the mouth of the Union River at Hood Canal, it serves as the commercial center of North Mason County. The population of the surrounding area swells in the summertime as tourists and nature lovers flock to the Canal and the Olympic Peninsula. The population was 3,931 at the 2010 census. Geography Belfair is located on an isthmus connecting the Kitsap and Olympic Peninsula. It receives an average rainfall of yearly and has a growing season of 212 days with final spring frost around April 20 usually. Mason Lake is southwest of Belfair. Notable People Belfair is the home of former U.S. Representative Norm Dicks. Belfair was also home to Noah Ashenhurst, formerly an English teacher at North Mason High School and award-winning author of the novel Comfort Food. Belfair is also the hometown of 6 Time AMA National Champion Jason Raines and the Illustrator of numerous children's books Daniel Lane. History Belfair was originally called Clifton, as were several other towns in the state.

Local doctor offices are in the area along with other professional services. The area has local and chain restaurants along with two major grocery stores (QFC, which specializes in food, and Safeway). Local shopping includes gift stores. Timberland Regional Library has a local branch in Belfair. Several public golf courses are nearby, including McCormick Woods, Gold Mountain, Alderbrook, Trophy Lake, Horseshoe Lake, and Lakeland Village. Gold Mountain is ranked on the top 100 list of public courses. Also in Belfair is the Mary E. Theler Community Center. The Theler Wetlands have walking trails meandering through of tidal wetlands, offering boardwalks and well-groomed paths with scenic views of Hood Canal, Union River, and a tidal estuary. Birders flock to the area to view kingfishers, herons, bald eagles and other birds. The wetlands and surrounding lowland forest are also home to foxes, deer, and other creatures. Other nature trails are behind Belfair Elementary, open dawn to dusk. Local vendors, farmers, and crafters can be found every Saturday at the \\"Belfair Saturday Market\\" during the spring/summer months in the Belfair Elementary parking lot. Washington State Route 3 is the main road leading into Belfair, from Bremerton and Gorst in the north, and Allyn in the south. Washington State Route 106 also starts at the south end of Belfair, leading toward Union, the next town along the south shore of Hood Canal. Washington State Route 300 begins in Belfair and runs along the north shore of Hood Canal, providing access to Tahuya and Dewatto Bay. Recreation Belfair serves as a gateway town for the Hood Canal region, and is the last town with services before visitors reach Tahuya State Forest, famed for its miles of off-road vehicle and mountain biking trails.

It offers satellite imagery, aerial photography, street maps, 360¬∞ interactive panoramic views of streets (Street View), real-time traffic conditions, and route planning for traveling by foot, car, bicycle and air (in beta), or public transportation. In 2020, Google Maps was used by over 1 billion people every month. Google Maps began as a C++ desktop program at Where 2 Technologies. In October 2004, the company was acquired by Google, which converted it into a web application. After additional acquisitions of a geospatial data visualization company and a realtime traffic analyzer, Google Maps was launched in February 2005. The service's front end utilizes JavaScript, XML, and Ajax. Google Maps offers an API that allows maps to be embedded on third-party websites, and offers a locator for businesses and other organizations in numerous countries around the world. Google Map Maker allowed users to collaboratively expand and update the service's mapping worldwide but was discontinued from March 2017. However, crowdsourced contributions to Google Maps were not discontinued as the company announced those features would be transferred to the Google Local Guides program. Google Maps' satellite view is a \\"top-down\\" or bird's-eye view; most of the high-resolution imagery of cities is aerial photography taken from aircraft flying at , while most other imagery is from satellites. Much of the available satellite imagery is no more than three years old and is updated on a regular basis. Google Maps used a variant of the Mercator projection, and therefore could not accurately show areas around the poles. In August 2018, the desktop version of Google Maps was updated to show a 3D globe. It is still possible to switch back to the 2D map in the settings. Google Maps for Android and iOS devices was released in September 2008 and features GPS turn-by-turn navigation along with dedicated parking assistance features. In August 2013, it was determined to be the world's most popular app for smartphones, with over 54% of global smartphone owners using it at least once. In 2012, Google reported having over 7,100 employees and contractors directly working in mapping. In May 2017, the app has reported to have 2 billion users on Android, along with several other Google services including YouTube, Chrome, Gmail, Search, and Google Play, Google Maps reached over 1 billion monthly users.  History = Acquisitions  Google Maps first started as a C++ program designed by two Danish brothers, Lars and Jens Eilstrup Rasmussen, at the Sydney-based company Where 2 Technologies. It was first designed to be separately downloaded by users, but the company later pitched the idea for a purely Web-based product to Google management, changing the method of distribution. In October 2004, the company was acquired by Google Inc. where it transformed into the web application Google Maps. In the same month, Google acquired Keyhole, a geospatial data visualization company (with investment from the CIA), whose marquee application suite, Earth Viewer, emerged as the highly successful Google Earth application in 2005 while other aspects of its core technology were integrated into Google Maps. In September 2004, Google acquired ZipDash, a company that provided realtime traffic analysis.  2005‚Äì2010  Google Maps Beta in 2005 The launch of Google Maps was first announced on the Google Blog on February 8, 2005. In September 2005, in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, Google Maps quickly updated its satellite imagery of New Orleans to allow users to view the extent of the flooding in various parts of that city. Original Google Maps icon On November 28, 2007, Google Maps for Mobile 2.0 was released. It featured a beta version of a \\"My Location\\" feature, which uses the GPS / Assisted GPS location of the mobile device, if available, supplemented by determining the nearest wireless networks and cell sites. The software looks up the location of the cell site using a database of known wireless networks and sites. By triangulating the different signal strengths from cell transmitters and then using their location property (retrieved from the database), My Location determines the user's current location. On September 23, 2008, coinciding with the announcement of the first commercial Android device, Google announced that a Google Maps app had been released for its Android operating system. In October 2009, Google replaced Tele Atlas as their primary supplier of geospatial data in the US version of Maps and used their own data.  2011‚Äì2015  On April 19, 2011, Map Maker was added to the American version of Google Maps, allowing any viewer to edit and add changes to Google Maps. This provides Google with local map updates almost in real-time instead of waiting for digital map data companies to release more infrequent updates. Icon used until 2020 On January 31, 2012, Google, due to offering its Maps for free, was found guilty of abusing the dominant position of its Google Maps application and ordered by a court to pay a fine and damages to Bottin Cartographer, a French mapping company. This ruling was overturned on appeal.https://www.competitionpolicyinternational.com/france-google-wins- court-decision-vs-evermaps/ In June 2012, Google started mapping Britain's rivers and canals in partnership with the Canal and River Trust. The company has stated that it would update the program during the year to allow users to plan trips which include locks, bridges and towpaths along the 2,000 miles of river paths in the UK. A monument in the shape of a Google Maps pin in the center of the city of Szczecin, Poland In December 2012, the Google Maps application was separately made available in the App Store, after Apple removed it from its default installation of the mobile operating system version iOS 6 in September 2012. On January 29, 2013, Google Maps was updated to include a map of North Korea. , Google Maps recognizes Palestine as a country, instead of redirecting to the Palestinian territories. In August 2013, Google Maps removed the Wikipedia Layer, which provided links to Wikipedia content about locations shown in Google Maps using Wikipedia geocodes.Google Maps Drops Wikipedia Layer . Search Engine Roundtable. (September 10, 2013) On April 12, 2014, Google Maps was updated to reflect the 2014 Crimean crisis. Crimea is shown as the Republic of Crimea in Russia and as the Autonomous Republic of Crimea in Ukraine. All other versions show a dotted disputed border. In April 2015, on a map near the Pakistani city of Rawalpindi, the imagery of the Android logo urinating on the Apple logo was added via Map Maker and appeared on Google Maps. The vandalism was soon removed and Google publicly apologized. However, as a result, Google disabled user moderation on Map Maker, and on May 12, disabled editing worldwide until it could devise a new policy for approving edits and avoiding vandalism. On April 29, 2015, users of the classic Google Maps were forwarded to the new Google Maps with the option to be removed from the interface. On July 14, 2015, the Chinese name for Scarborough Shoal was removed after a petition from the Philippines was posted on Change.org.  2016‚Äì2018  On June 27, 2016, Google rolled out new satellite imagery worldwide sourced from Landsat 8, comprising over 700 trillion pixels of new data. In September 2016, Google Maps acquired mapping analytics startup Urban Engines. In 2016, the Government of South Korea offered Google conditional access to the country's geographic database ‚Äì access that already allows indigenous Korean mapping providers high-detail maps. Google declined the offer, as it was unwilling to accept restrictions on reducing the quality around locations the South Korean Government felt were sensitive. On October 16, 2017, Google Maps was updated with accessible imagery of several planets and moons such as Titan, Mercury, and Venus, as well as direct access to imagery of the Moon and Mars. In May 2018, Google announced major changes to the API structure starting June 11, 2018. This change consolidated the 18 different endpoints into three services and merged the basic and premium plans into one pay-as-you-go plan. This meant a 1400% price raise for users on the basic plan, with only six weeks of notice. This caused a harsh reaction within the developers community. In June, Google postponed the change date to July 16, 2018. In August 2018, Google Maps designed its overall view (when zoomed out completely) into a 3D globe dropping the Mercator projection that projected the planet onto a flat surface.  2019‚Äìpresent  2020 icon redesign In January 2019, Google Maps added speed trap and speed camera alerts as reported by other users. On October 17, 2019, Google Maps was updated to include incident reporting, resembling a functionality in Waze which was acquired by Google in 2013. In December 2019, Incognito mode was added, allowing users to enter destinations without saving entries to their Google accounts. In February 2020, Maps received a 15th anniversary redesign. It notably consisted of a brand-new app icon, which resembled the original icon in 2005. On 23 September 2020, Google announced a COVID-19 Layer update for Google maps, which is designed to offer a seven-day average data of the total COVID-19-positive cases per 100,000 people in the area selected on the map. It will also feature a label indicating the rise and fall in the number of cases.  Functionality = Directions and transit  Google Maps provides a route planner, allowing users to find available directions through driving, public transportation, walking, or biking. Google has partnered globally with over 800 public transportation providers to adopt General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS), making the data available to third parties. The app can indicate users' transit route in an October 2019 update. The incognito mode, eyes-free walking navigation features were released earlier. A July 2020 update provided bike share routes.  Traffic conditions  Screenshot of Google Maps with traffic option enabled In 2007, Google began offering traffic data as a colored overlay on top of roads and motorways to represent the speed of vehicles on particular roads. Crowdsourcing is used to obtain the GPS- determined locations of a large number of cellphone users, from which live traffic maps are produced. Google has stated that the speed and location information it collects to calculate traffic conditions is anonymous. Options available in each phone's settings allow users not to share information about their location with Google Maps. Google stated, \\"Once you disable or opt out of My Location, Maps will not continue to send radio information back to Google servers to determine your handset's approximate location\\".  Street View  Google Maps car at Googleplex, Mountain View On May 25, 2007, Google released Google Street View, a new feature of Google Maps which provides 360¬∞ panoramic street-level views of various locations. On the date of release, the feature only included five cities in the US. It has since expanded to thousands of locations around the world. In July 2009, Google began mapping college campuses and surrounding paths and trails. Street View garnered much controversy after its release because of privacy concerns about the uncensored nature of the panoramic photographs, although the views are only taken on public streets. Since then, Google has begun blurring faces and license plates through automated facial recognition. In late 2014, Google launched Google Underwater Street View, including of the Australian Great Barrier Reef in 3D. The images are taken by special cameras which turn 360 degrees and take shots every 3 seconds. In 2017, in both Google Maps and Google Earth, Street View navigation of the International Space Station interior spaces became available.  45¬∞ imagery  An example of the Leaning Tower of Pisa in the 45¬∞ view In December 2009, Google introduced a new view consisting of 45¬∞ angle aerial imagery, offering a \\"bird's-eye view\\" of cities. The first cities available were San Jose and San Diego. This feature was initially available only to developers via the Google Maps API. In February 2010, it was introduced as an experimental feature in Google Maps Labs. In July 2010, 45¬∞ imagery was made available in Google Maps in select cities in the United States and worldwide.  Business listings  Google collates business listings from multiple on-line and off-line sources. To reduce duplication in the index, Google's algorithm combines listings automatically based on address, phone number, or geocode, but sometimes information for separate businesses will be inadvertently merged with each other, resulting in listings inaccurately incorporating elements from multiple businesses. Google allows business owners to create and verify their own business data through Google My Business,. Owners are encouraged to provide Google with Business information including; address, phone number, business category and photos. Google has staff in India who check and correct listings remotely as well as support businesses with issues. Google also has teams on the ground in most countries, that validate physical addresses in person. After the business listing is been verified, business owners can further optimize their profile by logging into their Google account and GMB dashboard. In mid August 2020 Google made it more convenient for business owners to edit their business profile directly from search, simply by typing the word My business or their company name. Google Maps can be manipulated by businesses which are not physically located in the area in which they record a listing. There are cases of people abusing Google Maps to overtake their competition by placing unverified listings on online directory sites knowing the information will roll across to Google (duplicate sites). The people who update these listings do not use a registered business name. Keywords and location details are placed on their Google Maps business title which can overtake credible business listings. In Australia in particular, genuine companies and businesses are noticing a trend of fake business listings in a variety of industries. Genuine business owners can also optimise their business listings to gain greater visibility in Google Maps, through a type of search engine marketing called Local search engine optimisation.  Indoor maps  In March 2011, indoor maps were added to Google Maps, giving users the ability to navigate themselves within buildings such as airports, museums, shopping malls, big-box stores, universities, transit stations, and other public spaces (including underground facilities). Google encourages owners of public facilities to submit floor plans of their buildings in order to add them to the service. Map users can view different floors of a building or subway station by clicking on a level selector that is displayed near any structures which are mapped on multiple levels.  My Maps  Google My Maps My Maps is a feature in Google Maps launched in April 2007 that enables users to create custom maps for personal use or sharing. Users can add points, lines, shapes, notes and images on top of Google Maps using a WYSIWYG editor. An Android app for My Maps, initially released in March 2013 under the name Google Maps Engine Lite, is also available.  Google Local Guides  Google Local Guides is a program launched by Google Maps to enable its users to contribute to Google Maps and it provides them additional perks and benefits for the work. The program is partially a successor to Google Map Maker as features from the former program became integrated into the website and app. The program consists of adding reviews, photos, basic information, videos and correcting information such as wheelchair accessibility.  Dark mode  Google is getting ready to add a dark mode option for the menu and settings on Google Maps. Google Maps is preparing to add a dark mode for menus and settings, xda-developers. October 10, 2019. Retrieved October 11, 2019.  Implementation  A split view screenshot of Google Maps. In the bottom half the Street Maps is shown, while in the top half the Street View is shown. A user can zoom-in and out either of them independently of the zoom level of each. As the user drags the map, the grid squares are downloaded from the server and inserted into the page. When a user searches for a business, the results are downloaded in the background for insertion into the side panel and map; the page is not reloaded. A hidden iframe with form submission is used because it preserves browser history. Like many other Google web applications, Google Maps uses JavaScript extensively. The site also uses JSON for data transfer rather than XML, for performance reasons. The version of Google Street View for classic Google Maps required Adobe Flash. In October 2011, Google announced MapsGL, a WebGL version of Maps with better renderings and smoother transitions. Indoor maps uses JPG, .PNG, .PDF, .BMP, or .GIF, for floor plans. Users who are logged into a Google Account can save locations so that they are overlaid on the map with various colored \\"pins\\" whenever they browse the application. These \\"Saved places\\" can be organised into user named lists and shared with other users. One default list \\"Starred places\\" also automatically creates a record in another Google product, Google Bookmarks.  Map data and imagery  The Google Maps terms and conditions state that usage of material from Google Maps is regulated by Google Terms of Service and some additional restrictions. Google has either purchased local map data from established companies, or has entered into lease agreements to use copyrighted map data.Google Map Suppliers The owner of the copyright is listed at the bottom of zoomed maps. For example, street maps in Japan are leased from Zenrin. Street maps in China are leased from AutoNavi. Russian street maps are leased from Geocentre Consulting and Tele Atlas. Data for North Korea is sourced from the companion project Google Map Maker. Street map overlays, in some areas, may not match up precisely with the corresponding satellite images. The street data may be entirely erroneous, or simply out of date: \\"The biggest challenge is the currency of data, the authenticity of data,\\" said Google Earth representative Brian McClendon. As a result, in March 2008 Google added a feature to edit the locations of houses and businesses. Restrictions have been placed on Google Maps through the apparent censoring of locations deemed potential security threats. In some cases the area of redaction is for specific buildings, but in other cases, such as Washington, D.C., the restriction is to use outdated imagery.  Google Maps API  Google Maps API, now called Google Maps Platform, hosts about 17 of different APIs, which are themed under the following categories; Maps, Places and Routes. After the success of reverse-engineered mashups such as chicagocrime.org and housingmaps.com, Google launched the Google Maps API in June 2005 to allow developers to integrate Google Maps into their websites. It was a free service that didn't require an API key until June 2018 (changes went into effect on July 16), when it was announced that an API key linked to a Google Cloud account with billing enabled would be required to access the API. The API does not contain ads, but Google states in their terms of use that they reserve the right to display ads in the future. By using the Google Maps API, it is possible to embed Google Maps into an external website, on to which site- specific data can be overlaid. Although initially only a JavaScript API, the Maps API was expanded to include an API for Adobe Flash applications (but this has been deprecated), a service for retrieving static map images, and web services for performing geocoding, generating driving directions, and obtaining elevation profiles. Over 1,000,000 web sites use the Google Maps API, making it the most heavily used web application development API. In September 2011, Google announced it would deprecate the Google Maps API for Flash. The Google Maps API is free for commercial use, provided that the site on which it is being used is publicly accessible and does not charge for access, and is not generating more than 25,000 map accesses a day. Sites that do not meet these requirements can purchase the Google Maps API for Business. As of 21 June 2018, Google increased the prices of the Maps API and requires a billing profile.  Google Maps in China  Due to restrictions on geographic data in China, Google Maps must partner with a Chinese digital map provider in order to legally show Chinese map data. Since 2006, this partner has been AutoNavi. Within China, the State Council mandates that all maps of China use the GCJ-02 coordinate system, which is offset from the WGS-84 system used in most of the world. google.cn/maps (formerly Google Ditu) uses the GCJ-02 system for both its street maps and satellite imagery. google.com/maps also uses GCJ-02 data for the street map, but uses WGS-84 coordinates for satellite imagery, causing the so-called China GPS shift problem. Frontier alignments also present some differences between google.cn/maps and google.com/maps. On the latter, sections of the Chinese border with India and Pakistan are shown with dotted lines, indicating areas or frontiers in dispute. However, google.cn shows the Chinese frontier strictly according to Chinese claims with no dotted lines indicating the border with India and Pakistan. For example, the South Tibet region claimed by China but administered by India as a large part of Arunachal Pradesh is shown inside the Chinese frontier by google.cn, with Indian highways ending abruptly at the Chinese claim line. Google.cn also shows Taiwan and the South China Sea Islands as part of China. Google Ditu's street map coverage of Taiwan no longer omits major state organs, such as the Presidential Palace, the five Yuans, and the Supreme Court. Feature-wise, google.cn/maps does not feature My Maps. On the other hand, while google.cn displays virtually all text in Chinese, google.com/maps displays most text (user-selectable real text as well as those on map) in English. This behavior of displaying English text is not consistent but intermittent ‚Äì sometimes it is in English, sometimes it is in Chinese. The criteria for choosing which language is displayed are not known publicly.  Discontinued features = Google Latitude  Google Latitude was a feature from Google that lets users share their physical locations with other people. This service was based on Google Maps, specifically on mobile devices. There was an iGoogle widget for desktops and laptops as well. Some concerns were expressed about the privacy issues raised by the use of the service. On August 9, 2013, this service was discontinued, and on March 22, 2017, Google incorporated the features from Latitude into the Google Maps app.  Google Map Maker  In areas where Google Map Maker was available, for example, much of Asia, Africa, Latin America and Europe as well as the United States and Canada, anyone who logged into their Google account could directly improve the map by fixing incorrect driving directions, adding biking trails, or adding a missing building or road. General map errors in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Liechtenstein, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, South Africa, Switzerland, and the United States could be reported using the Report a Problem link in Google Maps and would be updated by Google. For areas where Google used Tele Atlas data, map errors could be reported using Tele Atlas map insight. If imagery was missing, outdated, misaligned, or generally incorrect, one could notify Google through their contact request form. In November 2016, Google announced the discontinuation of Google Map Maker as of March 2017.  Mobile app  Google Maps is available as a mobile app for the Android and iOS mobile operating systems. The Android app was first released in September 2008, though the GPS-localization feature had been in testing on cellphones since 2007. Up until iOS 6, the built-in maps application on the iOS operating system was powered by Google Maps. However, with the announcement of iOS 6 in June 2012, Apple announced that they had created their own Apple Maps mapping service, which officially replaced Google Maps when iOS 6 was released on September 19, 2012. However, at launch, Apple Maps received significant criticism from users due to inaccuracies, errors and bugs. One day later, The Guardian reported that Google was preparing its own Google Maps app, which was released on December 12, 2012. Within only two days, the application had been downloaded over ten million times. left  Features  The Google Maps apps for iOS and Android have many of the same features, including turn-by-turn navigation, street view, and public transit information. Turn-by-turn navigation was originally announced by Google as a separate beta testing app exclusive to Android 2.0 devices in October 2009. The original standalone iOS version did not support the iPad, but tablet support was added with version 2.0 in July 2013. An update in June 2012 for Android devices added support for offline access to downloaded maps of certain regions, a feature that was eventually released for iOS devices, and made more robust on Android, in May 2014. At the end of 2015 Google Maps announced its new offline functionality, but with various limitations ‚Äì downloaded area cannot exceed 120,000 square kilometres and require a considerable amount of storage space. In January 2017, Google added a feature exclusively to Android that will, in some U.S. cities, indicate the level of difficulty in finding available parking spots, and on both Android and iOS, the app can, as of an April 2017 update, remember where users parked. In August 2017, Google Maps for Android was updated with new functionality to actively help the user in finding parking lots and garages close to a destination. In December 2017, Google added a new two-wheeler mode to its Android app, designed for users in India, allowing for more accessibility in traffic conditions. In 2019 the android version introduced the new feature called live view that allows to view directions directly on the road thanks to augmented reality Google Maps won the 2020 Webby Award for Best User Interface in the category Apps, Mobile & Voice.  Reception  USA Today welcomed the application back to iOS, saying: \\"The reemergence in the middle of the night of a Google Maps app for the iPhone is like the return of an old friend. Only your friend, who'd gone missing for three months, comes back looking better than ever.\\" Jason Parker of CNET, calling it \\"the king of maps\\", said, \\"With its iOS Maps app, Google sets the standard for what mobile navigation should be and more.\\" Bree Fowler of the Associated Press compared Google's and Apple's map applications, saying: \\"The one clear advantage that Apple has is style. Like Apple devices, the maps are clean and clear and have a fun, pretty element to them, especially in 3-D. But when it comes down to depth and information, Google still reigns superior and will no doubt be welcomed back by its fans.\\" Gizmodo gave it a ranking of 4.5 stars, stating: \\"Maps Done Right\\". According to The New York Times, Google \\"admits that it's [iOS app is] even better than Google Maps for Android phones, which has accommodated its evolving feature set mainly by piling on menus\\". However, Google Maps' location tracking is widely regarded as a threat to users' privacy, with Dylan Tweney of VentureBeat writing in August 2014 that \\"Google is probably logging your location, step by step, via Google Maps\\", and linked users to Google's location history map, which \\"lets you see the path you've traced for any given day that your smartphone has been running Google Maps\\". Tweney then provided instructions on how to disable location history. The history tracking was also noticed, and recommended disabled, by editors at CNET and TechCrunch. Additionally, Quartz reported in April 2014 that a \\"sneaky new privacy change\\" would have an effect on the majority of iOS users. The privacy change, an update to the Gmail iOS app that \\"now supports sign-in across Google iOS apps, including Maps, Drive, YouTube and Chrome\\", meant that Google would be able to identify users' actions across its different apps. The Android version of the app surpassed 5 billion installations in March 2019.  Go version  Google Maps Go, a version of the app designed for lower-end devices, was released in beta in January 2018. By September 2018, the app had over 10 million installations.  Potential misuse  In 2005 the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organization (ANSTO) complained about the potential for terrorists to use the satellite images in planning attacks, with specific reference to the Lucas Heights nuclear reactor; however, the Australian Federal government did not support the organization's concern. At the time of the ANSTO complaint, Google had colored over some areas for security (mostly in the US), such as the rooftop of the White House and several other Washington, D.C., US buildings. In October 2010, Nicaraguan military commander Ed√©n Pastora stationed Nicaraguan troops on the Isla Calero (in the delta of the San Juan River), justifying his action on the border delineation given by Google Maps. Google has since updated its data which it found to be incorrect. On January 27, 2014, documents leaked by Edward Snowden revealed that the NSA and the GCHQ intercepted Google Maps queries made on smartphones, and used them to locate the users making these queries. One leaked document, dating to 2008, stated that \\"[i]t effectively means that anyone using Google Maps on a smartphone is working in support of a GCHQ system.\\" In February 2020, Simon Weckert used 99 cell phones to fake a Google Maps traffic jam.

It is used as a method of torture, or to incapacitate the victim. Use Hamstringing is used primarily to incapacitate a human or animal and render them incapable of effective movement. The severing of the hamstring muscles results not only in the crippling of the leg, but also in pain. Method In humans, the hamstring extends between the hip and knee joints. The hamstring muscle group is made up of the biceps femoris, semitendinosus muscle, and the semimembranosus. It facilitates both the flexing of the knee and hip extension,Brughelli, Matt. (2011) making it a vital contributor to normal leg movement. By severing these muscles or the tendons involved in this process, normal leg movement is disrupted. In addition to sustaining massive bleeding, the injured leg becomes useless and the victim is rendered lame. The severing of the hamstring is usually accomplished through use of a blade such as a knife or sword. Medical treatment Due to a lack of research in the field of critical hamstring injuries, the current injury management is quite limited. Management of the injury is based solely \\"on clinical experience, anecdotal evidence and the knowledge of the biological basis of tissue repair.\\" These injuries are difficult to control or repair, leading often to permanent injury or even death by exsanguination. Historical usage Sources from late antiquity indicate that hamstringing was commonly used to incapacitate combatants and prisoners. Use as metaphor Literally, to \\"hamstring\\" an individual is to sever the tissues of their hamstring. As a metaphor to be \\"hamstrung\\" suggests being limited, by external imposition or not, in a way that prevents full freedom of movement or utilization of resources. Biblical references Rendering chariot horses lame by hamstringing is mentioned in the Bible, called \\"houghing\\" in the King James Version,Book of Joshua, Chapter 11, Verse 9 (King James Version) from an old spelling of hock. In the Bible, this is seen as a positive use of hamstringing because it prevents the horses from being used in warfare.

During the Trans-Saharan slave trade, many Nilotic peoples from the lower Nile Valley were purchased as slaves and brought to work elsewhere in North Africa and the Orient by Nubians, Egyptians, Berbers and Arabs. Starting in 1995, many human rights organizations have reported on contemporary practice, especially in the context of the Second Sudanese civil war. According to reports of Human Rights Watch and others, during the war the government of Sudan was involved in backing and arming numerous slave-taking militias in the country as part of its war against the SPLA. It also found the government failed to enforce Sudanese laws against kidnapping, assault and forced labor, or to help victims' families locate their children.) Another report (by the International Eminent Persons Group) found both the government-backed militias and the rebels (led by the SPLA) guilty of abducting civilians, though the abducting civilians by pro-government militias was \\"of particular concern\\" and \\"in a significant number of cases\\", led to slavery \\"under the definition of slavery in the International Slavery Convention of 1926.Slavery, Abduction and Forced Servitude in Sudan US State Department  International Eminent Persons Group  May 22, 2002  page 7 accessed 26 October 2015 The Sudanese government maintained that the slavery is the product of inter-tribal warfare, over which it had no control. According to the Rift Valley Institute, slave raiding and abduction \\"effectively ceased\\" in 2002, although an \\"unknown number\\" of slaves remained in captivity. \\"Slave\\" is a racial epithet directed towards darker- skinned Sudanese. History of slavery in the Sudan Slavery in the region of the Sudan has a long history, beginning in the ancient Nubian and ancient Egyptian times and continuing up to the present. Prisoners of war were a regular occurrence in the ancient Nile Valley and Africa. During times of conquest and after winning battles, the ancient Nubians were taken as slaves by the ancient Egyptians .Redford, D. B..From Slave to Pharaoh: The Black Experience of Ancient Egypt. Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2004. Project MUSE In turn, the ancient Egyptians took slaves after winning battles with the Libyans, Canaanites, and Nubians. Soon after the Arab conquest of Egypt, the Arabs attempted to conquer the kingdoms of Christian Nubia on multiple occasions, but utilizing strategic guerilla-like warfare, the significantly smaller Christian Nubia defeated the larger Arab forces. Eventually, given their unsuccessful efforts, the Arabs signed the 600-year Baqt treaty with the Christian Nubian kingdom of Makuria. As a part of the treaty, the Nubians, already involved in the burgeoning East African slave trade, agreed to trade 360 slaves annually to their northern neighbors in exchange for spices and grains. After the Nubian kingdoms' fall in 1504, the Ottomans conquered most of Nubia, while the Funj conquered much of modern day Sudan from Darfur to Khartoum ; the Funj began to use slaves in the army in the reign of Badi III (r. 1692-1711). Later, Egyptian slavers began raiding modern South Sudan. In particular, the ruler Muhammad Ali of Egypt attempted to build up an army of Southern Sudanese slaves with the aid of the Nubian slavers. Attempts to ban slavery were later attempted by colonial British authorities in 1899, after they conquered the region. According to British explorer (and abolitionist) Samuel Baker, who visited Khartoum in 1862 six decades after the British had declared slave trade illegal, slave trade was the industry \\"that kept Khartoum going as a bustling town\\".quotes by Jok Madut Jok, (source: Baker described the practice of slave raiding of African villages to the south by slavers in Khartoum: An armed group would sail up the Nile, find a convenient African village, surround it during night and attack just before dawn, burning huts and shooting. Women and young adults would be captured and bound with \\"forked poles on their shoulders\\", hand tied to the pole in front, children bound to their mothers. To render \\"the village so poor that surviving inhabitants would be force to collaborate with slavers on their next excursion against neighboring villages,\\" the village would be looted of cattle, grain, ivory, with everything else destroyed. In the late 19th century, two thirds of Khartoum's population were slaves, according to historian Douglas H. Johnson.  Modern-day slavery  The \\"current wave\\" of slavery in Sudan reportedly began in 1983 with the Second Sudanese Civil War between the North and South. It involved large numbers of \\"African\\" Sudanese, \\"primarily the Dinka, Nuer and Nuba of central Sudan,\\" being captured and sold \\"(or exploited in other ways)\\" by Northern Sudanese \\"Arabs\\".John Eibner, the CEO of Christian Solidarity International-USA, also states that modern-day slavery was revived in Sudan in the mid-1980s the Arab-Muslim state of Sudan started reviving. He claims that this slavery is a result of a jihad led by the state against the non-Muslim population.(source: The problem of slavery reportedly became worse after the National Islamic Front-backed military government took power in 1989, the Khartoum government declared jihad against non-Muslim opposition in the south. The Baggara were also given freedom \\"to kill these groups, loot their wealth, capture slaves, expel the rest from the territories, and forcefully settle their lands.\\" The Sudan Criminal Code of 1991 did not list slavery as a crime, but the state of Sudan has ratified the Slavery Convention, the Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery, the Slave Trade, and Institutions and Practices Similar to Slavery, and is a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). Nonetheless, according to the imam of the Ansar movement and former prime minister, Sadiq al-Mahdi, jihad > requires initiating hostilities for religious purposes ... It is true that > the [NIF] regime has not enacted a law to realize slavery in Sudan. But the > traditional concept of jihad does allow slavery as a by-product [of > jihad].As-Sadiq Al-Mahdi to Mary Robinson, U.N. High Commissioner for Human > Rights (Section III: War Crimes), Mar. 24, 1999. Human Rights Watch\\"Children in Sudan: Slaves, Street Children and Child Soldiers,\\" Human Rights Watch, September 1995 and Amnesty International\\"Sudan:‚ÄòThe tears of orphans‚Äô: no future without human rights,\\" Amnesty International, January 1, 1995 first reported on slavery in Sudan in 1995 in the context of the Second Sudanese Civil War. In 1996, two more reports emerged, one by a United Nations representative and another by reporters from the Baltimore Sun, just one of many \\"extensive accounts of slave raiding\\" in Sudan provided by Western media outlets since 1995. Human Rights Watch and others have described the contemporary form of slavery in Sudan as mainly the work of the armed, government-backed militia of the Baggara tribes who raid civilians‚Äîprimarily of the Dinka ethnic group from the southern region of Bahr El Ghazal. The Baggara captured children and women who were taken to western Sudan and elsewhere. They were \\"forced to work for free in homes and in fields, punished when they refuse, and abused physically and sometimes sexually\\". The government of Sudan \\"arm[ed] and sanction[ed] the practice of slavery by this tribal militia\\", known as muraheleen, as a low cost way of weakening its enemy in the Second Sudanese Civil War, the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Movement/Army (SPLM/A), which was thought to have a base of support among the Dinka tribe of southern Sudan. According to a 2002 report issued by the International Eminent Persons Group, (acting with the encouragement of the US State Department) both the government-backed militias and the rebels (led by the SPLA) have been found guilty of abducting civilians, but \\"of particular concern\\" were incidents that occurred \\"in conjunction with attacks by pro-government militias known as murahaleen on villages in SPLA-controlled areas near the boundary between northern and southern Sudan.\\" The Group concluded that \\"in a significant number of cases\\", abduction is the first stage in \\"a pattern of abuse that falls under the definition of slavery in the International Slavery Convention of 1926 and the Supplementary Convention of 1956.\\" Estimates of abductions during the war range from 14,000 to 200,000. One estimate (by Jok Madut Jok) is of 10-15,000 slaves in Sudan \\"at any one time\\", the number remaining roughly constant as individual slaves come and go‚Äîas captives escape, have their freedom bought or are released as unfit for labor, more are captured. Until 1999, the number of slaves kept by slave taker retains after the distribution of the human war booty was usually \\"three to six and rarely exceeded ten per slave raider\\". Although modern slave trading never approached the scale of nineteenth-century Nilotic slavery, some Baggara \\"operated as brokers to convert the war captives into slaves\\", selling slaves \\"at scattered points throughout Western Sudan\\", and \\"as far north as Kharoum\\". Illegal and highly unpopular internationally, the trade is done \\"discreetly\\", and kept to a \\"minimal level\\" so that \\"evidence for it is very difficult to obtain.\\" \\"Slave owners simply deny that Southern children working for them are slaves.\\" According to a January 25, 1999, report in CBS news, slaves have been sold for $50 apiece. Writing for The Wall Street Journal on December 12, 2001, Michael Rubin said:Michael Rubin, \\"Don't 'Engage' Rogue Regimes,\\" Wall Street Journal, December 12, 2001 The Sudanese government has never admitted to the existence of \\"slavery\\" within their borders, but in 1999, under international pressure, it established the Committee to Eradicate the Abduction of Women and Children (CEAWC). 4,000 \\"abducted\\" southerners were returned to South Sudan through this program before it was shut down in 2010.Michaela Alfred-Kamara, \\"Will Independence Lead to the End of Slavery in Sudan?\\" Anti-Slavery International Reporter, Winter 2011 PDF ;End of trade According to the Rift Valley Institute, slave-raiding, \\"abduction ‚Ä¶ effectively ceased\\" in 2002. \\"A significant number\\" of slaves were repatriated after 2005 the Comprehensive Peace Agreement of 2005, but \\"an unknown number\\" remain in captivity. The Institute created a \\"Sudan Abductee Database\\" containing \\"the names of over 11,000 people who were abducted in 20 years of slave-raiding\\" in Northern Bahr el-Ghazal state in southern Sudan, from 1983 to 2002. The January 2005 \\"North/South Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA)\\" peace treaty that ended the Sudanese civil war put an end to the slave raids, according to Christian Solidarity International, but did not provide a \\"way home for those already enslaved.\\" The last Human Rights Watch \\"Backgrounder on Slavery in Sudan\\" was updated March 2002. Christian Solidarity International slave redemption efforts Efforts to \\"redeem\\" or to buy the freedom of slaves in Sudan are controversial. Beginning in 1995, Christian Solidarity International began \\"redeeming\\" slaves through an underground network of traders set up through local peace agreements between Arab and southern chiefs. The group claims to have freed over 80,000 people in this manner since that time.John Eibner, \\"Slavery FAQ\\"  csi-usa.org  accessed 26 October 2015 Several other charities eventually followed suit. In 1999 UNICEF called the practice of redeeming slaves 'intolerable', arguing that these charities are implicitly accepting that human beings can be bought and sold. UNICEF also said that buying slaves from slave-traders gives them cash to purchase arms and ammunition. But Christian Solidarity said they purchase slaves in Sudanese pounds, not US dollars that could be used to purchase arms. As of 2015, Christian Solidarity International states that it continues redeeming slaves. On its website, the group states that it employs safeguards against fraud, and that allegations of fraud \\"remain today unsubstantiated\\".

The two versions were the 16 KB and 48 KB of RAM. They contained the same processor (Z80A), running at 3.58 MHz and a ROM chip, some RAM chips (old dynamic RAMs 4116 and 4416). Microdigital reverse engineered a CMOS integrated circuit (IC) with similar functionality to the original Bipolar IC ULA from Sinclair/Ferranti. The modulator was tuned to VHF channel 3 and the TV system was hardware selectable to PAL-M (60 Hz) as used in Brazil, PAL-N (50 Hz) as used in Uruguay, Argentina and Paraguay and NTSC (60 Hz) as used in USA and many other countries. An improvement over the original ZX Spectrum was the sound output via modulated RF direct to the TV set instead of the beeper. Most software written for the Spectrum ran on the TK90X, with some minor incompatibilities. Only three peripherals were released by Microdigital -- a Joystick, a light pen interface and a parallel printer interface. A Beta disc (48) interface was made by third party companies, called 'C.A.S. disk drive interface' (a near- clone from the original Beta disc interface), 'C.B.I. disk drive interface' (with a printer interface included) and 'IDS91' (with a printer interface included made by Synchron) or 'IDS2001ne' (these exclusively compatible only with the TK90X or TK95 {no ZX Spectrum use possible}, also from Synchron, and also with a printer interface included). TK95 The TK90X was replaced by the TK95, which had a different keyboard (professional) and case (identical to the Commodore Plus4) and exactly the same circuit board and schematics. The motherboard was marked as TK90X. The unit had a few difference in the ROM that made the TK95 more compatible with the original ZX Spectrum. It used the same ULA chip, with only digital logic ports and the analogue part outside the ULA chip, exactly as in the TK90X. It was reported that the TK95 provided more compatibility with the original ZX Spectrum (e.g., the game Mikie runs only on the TK95, not on the TK90X), e.g., the D1 diode was disconnected and some changes to the ROM were made. Curiously, some games became incompatible due to this modification. TK90X users in Brazil used to make a switch to choose the original TK90X (or TK95) ROM or the ZX Spectrum ROM internally, so they could use almost all of the Spectrum's software. Export model During that period, Brazilians were not allowed to import computers and therefore the TK90X became the first affordable color computer for Brazilians. It was successful in other Latin America countries, such as Uruguay and Argentina, but the export model used a different circuit board and schematics, and an original Ferrati ULA from the ZX Spectrum. Because of its affordability, many commercial software programs were locally developed for the first time for use of small businesses in Latin America to run on the TK90X and millions of users had their first computer experience with it.

It was founded in 1947 by Catherine Doherty in Combermere, Ontario and has established missionary field houses worldwide. History Madonna House was founded by Catherine and Eddie Doherty in Combermere, Ontario, in 1947. The apostolate has since grown to establish 18 \\"field houses\\" in six countries. Life Staff workers of the Madonna House Apostolate live in voluntary poverty. Donations of clothing, food, goods and money come from a variety of sources enabling them to live out their promise of poverty, and better identify with the poor whom they serve. As a celibate community, the men, women and priests live in separate dormitories and generally work in separate departments, but gather together for all daily meals and religious services. Members of the Madonna House community live a simple daily routine beginning with a brief prayer service, followed by a day of work, and ending with Mass and dinner. Work at the main house generally consists of the day-to-day maintenance of the community, care of a farm, and the sorting and distribution of donations to the poor. The spirituality of the Madonna House Apostolate is summarized in The Little Mandate, a \\"distillation\\" of the Gospel message of Jesus Christ brought forth by the apostolate's foundress. Some members of the apostolate live in \\"poustinia\\", meaning a small, sparsely furnished cabin or room (the term poustinia has its roots in the Russian word for \\"desert\\"). For these few staff workers, their voluntary life as poustiniks is somewhat like that of a hermit, though less strict. Madonna House welcomes guests into their community, allowing anyone to come and join their daily routine of work and prayer for varying lengths of time at their training centre in Combermere. Also, once a year, a program is offered to families at Madonna House's summer camp called Cana Colony. Cana Colony was begun as a response to the request by Pope Pius XII to Catherine Doherty in 1951 that she and Madonna House would \\"always remember the family.\\" Cana Colony began the following year and the camp is located at the edge of Bennett Lake. Families need to come prepared to enjoy an experience of simple and rustic living. A cook-shack is the only place that has electricity and running water. The one-room cabins have no electricity, and all of the johns are outdoor outhouses. Recreational activities include swimming, hiking, fishing, campfires, sing-alongs, etc. All families share in chores to help maintain the camp. Works The main work of the Madonna House Apostolate is serving the poor ‚Äî both the physically and spiritually poor. Donations sent to the community are redistributed locally and internationally. Through their missionary field houses, Madonna House staff workers serve the needs of the poor in many ways, from \\"prayer and listening houses\\" to soup kitchens. The apostolate maintains a non-profit publications department, Madonna House Publications. It publishes the works of Catherine Doherty and other members of the community as part of its mission to spread the Gospel. The Madonna House monthly newspaper, Restoration, has been in continuous publication since 1947. Madonna House also works to promote the cause for canonization of their foundress, Catherine Doherty, through a newsletter and web site. Restoration Restoration is published by Madonna House Publications. It was founded in 1947 by the American newspaperman Eddie Doherty and his wife, social justice activist Catherine Doherty. The articles and stories in Restoration are generally drawn from the daily life of the staff of the Madonna House Apostolate, and primarily revolve around the challenges of living the Gospel of Jesus as a Catholic in today's world. Regular columns include: *Combermere Diary -- current events at the Madonna House training centre in Combermere, Ontario *Milestones -- announcements regarding the staff of the apostolate *My Dear Family -- articles from the writings of Catherine Doherty *My Story -- personal testimonies of Madonna House staff and friends *New Millennium -- articles by the Madonna House Director General of Priests *Notes From Near and Far -- news from the apostolate's international field houses *One Man's Scrap, Another Man's Gold -- requests for specific donations for the needs of the community *The Pope's Corner -- excerpts from the writings of the Holy Father *Word Made Flesh -- reflections on Scripture readings from the liturgy The paper is non-profit, and there is only a small subscription fee to cover the cost of printing and mailing. Structure Madonna House is a \\"public association of the Christian faithful\\" under the authority of the bishop of the Diocese of Pembroke, and faithful to the magisterium of the Roman Catholic Church.Code of Canon Law, 298‚Äì320 The headquarters (called the \\"main house\\" or \\"training centre\\") located in Combermere, Ontario, Canada, houses the majority of the apostolate's staff workers. The community is overseen by three \\"Directors General\\" ‚Äî the Director General of Men, the Director General of Women, and the Director General of Priests ‚Äî each of whom is elected by the respective segment of the community for four-year terms. The apostolate also has several international missionary \\"field houses\\", each under the authority of the bishop of the area (and set up at his invitation). Each field house has a \\"Local Director,\\" appointed by the Directors General. Local Directors gather yearly at the main house for several weeks of meetings and retreats. Members of Madonna House are known as \\"staff workers.\\" After a two-year period of applicancy, staff workers make year-long promises (not vows) of poverty, chastity and obedience. These promises are renewed yearly and, after seven years, staff workers generally make lifelong final promises to the community. Staff workers can be distinguished by the large silver rounded cross they wear on a cord around their necks bearing the Latin words pax caritas (for \\"peace\\" and \\"love\\"). Madonna house also has a seven-month program for discerning the priesthood that runs from the first week of October until Easter. The program's participants live and work in the community in a routine similar to volunteer working guests except with the addition of a special class.http://www.madonnahouse.org/programs/formation/ In addition, the apostolate also accepts priests, bishops and deacons from outside the community as \\"Associate Priests\\" ‚Äî although these priests do not participate in the day-to-day workings of the apostolate. The Associate Priests do wear the pax caritas cross, strive to live \\"the Madonna House way of life,\\" and meet yearly at the main house for retreats. (There is no corresponding \\"associate\\" status for lay people.) Pioneer Museum The apostolate's headquarters in Combermere, Ontario, includes the Pioneer Museum, a log barn housing historic pioneer artifacts. Items include household items, kitchenware, tools, cobbler and farm implements. Field houses Besides the main training centre in Combermere, Ontario, the Madonna House Apostolate also maintains missionary \\"field houses\\" in the following places: Canada *Edmonton, Alberta *Vancouver, British Columbia *Combermere, Ontario *Ottawa, Ontario *Toronto, Ontario *Windsor, Ontario *Regina, Saskatchewan *Whitehorse, Yukon *Rimouski, Quebec United States The Madonna House in Winslow, Arizona, was founded in 1957.\\"La Casa de Nuestra Se√±ora\\", The Roman Catholic Diocese of Gallup Other houses are located in Washington, D.C.; Alpena, Michigan; Salem, Missouri; and Roanoke, Virginia. International The Madonna House in Robin Hood's Bay, England, was established in 1985. Other houses are in Carriacou, Grenada; Krasnoyarsk, Russia; and Resteigne, Belgium. Our Lady of Combermere Our Lady of Combermere refers to a statue of Mary erected in 1960 in the village of Combermere, Ontario, Canada. Prayer to the Virgin Mary under the title of \\"Our Lady of Combermere\\" began in the late 1940s at the Madonna House Apostolate founded by Catherine Doherty in the small village of Combermere, in Ontario, Canada. As the title began to gain popularity among the apostolate's friends and neighbours, a woman (who claimed to have received an answer to prayer through the use of this title) offered to donate the money required to have a life-sized bronze statue erected for a Marian shrine to Our Lady of Combermere. Catherine Doherty and her apostolate sought permission for the formal use of this title, as well as the erection of a shrine, from the Bishop of Pembroke, the Most Rev. William J. Smith, who directed them to contact the Sacred Congregation of Rites in Rome. The Congregation of Rites responded, giving the local bishop the authority to approve the title and shrine. He granted them permission to erect a statue of Mary under the title of \\"Our Lady of Combermere\\" and to have it blessed. The statue itself was sculpted by Frances Rich of Santa Barbara, California. Modelled on an earlier work by Rich entitled \\"The Questing Madonna,\\" the statue of Our Lady of Combermere depicts the Virgin Mary hastening with arms open wide as if to welcome and embrace the viewer. The statue was officially installed and blessed by the Most Rev. William J. Smith, Bishop of Pembroke, on June 8, 1960. Other Madonna House organizations A number of other, unaffiliated organizations have also adopted the name \\"Madonna House\\", providing services varying from maternal services to retirement homes, and homeless shelters.

The Africanized bee in the western hemisphere is directly descended from 26 Tanzanian queen bees (A. m. scutellata) accidentally released by a replacement bee-keeper in 1957 in Rio Claro, S√£o Paulo in the southeast of Brazil from hives operated by Kerr, who had interbred honey bees from Europe and southern Africa. Biography Kerr was born in 1922 in Santana do Parna√≠ba, S√£o Paulo, Brazil, the son of Am√©rico Caldas Kerr and B√°rbara Chaves Kerr. The Kerr family immigrated by way of the United States. His family is originally from Scotland. The family moved to Pirapora do Bom Jesus, SP in 1925. He attended secondary school and the preparatory course at the Mackenzie in S√£o Paulo and subsequently was admitted to the Escola Superior de Agricultura Luiz de Queiroz of the University of S√£o Paulo, at Piracicaba, S√£o Paulo, where he graduated as agricultural engineer. From March 1975 to April 1979, Kerr moved to Manaus, Amazonas, as director of the National Institute of Amazonia Research (INPA), a research institute of the National Council of Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq). He officially retired from the University of S√£o Paulo in January 1981, but not from scientific life. Exactly eleven days later he accepted a position as Full Professor at the Universidade Estadual do Maranh√£o in S√£o Lu√≠s, state of Maranh√£o, where he became responsible for creating the Department of Biology; and, for a short period (1987‚Äì1988) served also as Dean of the University. He moved to the Universidade Federal de Uberl√¢ndia, in Uberl√¢ndia, state of Minas Gerais, in February 1988, as a Professor of Genetics. Scientific contributions His scientific life began in Piracicaba, where he received his doctorate (D.Sc) and later was an assistant professor. In 1951, he did postdoctoral studies as a Visiting Professor at the University of California at Davis and, in 1952, at Columbia University, where he studied with the famous geneticist Theodosius Dobzhansky. In 1958, he was invited by Professor Dias da Silveira to assist in organizing the Department of Biology at the Faculdade de Ci√™ncias do Rio Claro, of the recently created State University of S√£o Paulo UNESP, in the city of Rio Claro, where he stayed until 1964, directing a research group on the genetics of bees, his main field of specialization. From 1962 to 1964, he served as the Scientific Director to organize the recently created S√£o Paulo State Research Foundation (FAPESP). In December 1964, he accepted the position of Full Professor of Genetics at the Faculty of Medicine of Ribeir√£o Preto of the University of S√£o Paulo, in order to create a new Department of Genetics. In this capacity, Kerr was able to establish a research center of excellence, particularly in the areas of entomological genetics and human genetics, and that trained many masters and doctoral students. The department included a new research and teaching area, that of mathematical biology and biostatistics, the first of its kind in a medical school in Brazil; and was a pioneer in the use of computers in biology and medicine, particularly for genetics applied to animal husbandry. In all these positions he never stopped his research on Meliponini, especially the genus Melipona, which is a genus of Neotropical bees that are frequently subject to the predatory action of wild honey gatherers (meleiros in Portuguese). Kerr became well known for his research on the hybridization of the African bee and the Italian bee (Apis mellifera ligustica). Kerr has 620 publications on various subjects. Apart from being a member of the Brazilian Academy of Sciences, he was also a Foreign Associate of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA,http://www.nasonline.org/site/Dir/989495092?pg=rslts and of the Third World Academy of Sciences. He was admitted by President Itamar Franco to the National Order of Scientific Merit at the Gr√£-Cruz class in 1994.

Her 1984 novel The Hero and the Crown won the Newbery Medal as the year's best new American children's book. , McKinley has written or contributed to twenty books. Her most recent novel is Shadows (2013).  Biography  Robin McKinley was born as Jennifer Carolyn Robin McKinley on November 16, 1952 in Warren, Ohio. Her father William McKinley was an officer in the United States Navy and her mother Jeanne Turrell McKinley was a teacher. As a result of her father's changing naval posts, McKinley grew up all over the world, including in California, New York, Japan, and Maine. She was educated at Gould Academy, a preparatory school in Bethel, Maine. McKinley went on to attend college, first at Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania in 1970‚Äì1972 and later at Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine, where she graduated summa cum laude in 1975. Robin McKinley lives in Hampshire, England. Her husband was author Peter Dickinson; they were married from 1991 until his death in 2015. They had no children, though Dickinson had children from his first marriage. McKinley currently has two dogs, and her many \\"obsessions\\" include learning Japanese, playing the piano, horseback riding, gardening, cooking, and bell ringing.  Career  After graduating from college, she remained in Maine for several years working as a research assistant and later in a bookstore. During this time, she completed her first book, Beauty: A Retelling of the Story of Beauty and the Beast. It was accepted for publication by the first publisher it was sent to and upon publication immediately pushed McKinley to prominence. The book was named an American Library Association Notable Children's Book and an ALA Best Book for Young Adults.  Awards  *1983 Newbery Honor for The Blue Sword. *1985 Newbery Medal for The Hero and the Crown. *1986 World Fantasy Award for Anthology/Collection for Imaginary Lands, as editor. *1998 Phoenix Award Honor Book for Beauty. *2004 Mythopoeic Fantasy Award for Adult Literature for Sunshine.  Writing  Robin McKinley has written a variety of novels, mostly in the fantasy genre. Several of her novels are her own personal renditions of classic fairy tales with a \\"feminist twist\\". These retellings usually feature a strong female protagonist who does not wait to be rescued but instead takes an active role in determining the course of her own life. Beauty and Rose Daughter are both versions of Beauty and the Beast, Spindle's End is the story of Sleeping Beauty, and Deerskin and two of the stories in The Door in the Hedge are based on other folk-tales. Besides adapting classic fairy tales, McKinley wrote her own rendition of the Robin Hood story in her novel The Outlaws of Sherwood. McKinley has written two novels set in the imaginary land of Damar, The Blue Sword and The Hero and the Crown. Her contribution to the Imaginary Lands anthology and the stories in A Knot in the Grain are also set there. Her standalone novels include Sunshine, Shadows, and Dragonhaven. The heroines in McKinley's books reflect certain qualities that she saw in herself as a young woman: clumsiness, plainness, bookishness, and disinterest in the usual social games that involve flirting and dating. In her Newbery Award acceptance speech, she said, \\"I didn't discover boys because they didn't discover me, and because their standards of discovery seemed to me too odd to be aspired to. They were the ones who got to have adventures, while we got to‚Äîwell, not have adventures.\\" McKinley says she writes about strong heroines because she feels very strongly about the potential for girls to be \\"doing things\\", and she feels that the selection of fantasy literature featuring girls is scarce and unsatisfactory. According to biographer Marilyn H. Karrenbrock, \\"McKinley's females do not simper; they do not betray their own nature to win a man's approval. But neither do they take love lightly or put their own desires before anything else. In McKinley's books, the romance, like the adventure, is based upon ideals of faithfulness, duty, and honor.\\"  Works = Children's picture books  * Rowan (1992), Illustrated by Donna Ruff * My Father is in the Navy (1992), Illustrated by Martine Gourbalt * The Stone Fey (1998), Illustrated by John Clapp  Adaptations  * Black Beauty Storybook Edition (1986), Illustrated by Susan Jeffers.

She was built in the Netherlands in 1902 and is currently operated out of Airlie Beach, Australia as a holiday sailor in the Whitsunday Islands. History The ship, originally named Stina, was built out of German steel with timber decking as a sail powered cargo vessel. In 1905, she was sold and renamed Adolf, working in and around the Baltic and North seas. In 1915, she was seized as a prize of war by the British Royal Navy and used as a Q-Ship during World War I. After the war, she worked as a coal, produce and stone carrying vessel between Liverpool and Scotland. She was sold to a Scottish firm in 1924 in the Solway Firth, where she was renamed Solway Lass. When World War II broke out, Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine seized Solway Lass and used her as a supply ship. She hit a mine and was badly damaged during the war; but she was repaired by the Germans to serve as a sail-powered icebreaker. After WWII, Solway Lass served in the South Pacific as a cargo vessel. A Sydney businessman purchased her in Fiji in 1983 and rebuilt her. She took part in the 1st Fleet re-enactment of the Tall Ships in Sydney Harbour in 1988. Solway Lass was purchased in 1999 by Australian Tall Ship Cruises and sailed from Sydney to the Whitsunday Islands arriving in the Whitsundays in February 1999. After an extensive refurbishment Solway Lass went to sea as a live-aboard charter yacht providing three night cruises around the Whitsundays Islands. In April 2002, the owners and crew of Australian Tall Ship Cruises celebrated with a 100th birthday for Solway Lass in the Whitsundays.

He is a liaison of the United States government who is against the superhuman community. Publication history The character first appeared in Avengers Vol. 1 #165 (November 1977) and was created by Jim Shooter (writer) and John Byrne (penciller). Fictional character biography Henry Gyrich is the first person to be given the title of US Government liaison to the Avengers by the National Security Agency later by the National Security Council. With his status, Gyrich is one of only two people (the other being the President of the United States) who could affect the Avengers in many difficult ways. During his tenure, Gyrich revokes the Avengers' priority status after taking issue.Avengers #168 (February 1978) The Avengers have to accept Gyrich's \\"suggestions\\" or have their Quinjets and other sensitive equipment confiscated.Avengers #181 (July 1979) He limits the Avengers' active membership to seven members, forces the Falcon to join unwillingly to fill an affirmative action quota Gyrich sets, and installs various security measures for the teamAvengers #181 (July 1979) Gyrich oversees the Avengers' activities for the next several months without incident, until he forbids the team to go on a mission to help Quicksilver.Avengers #186 (August 1979) The next incident involves a security leak. Gyrich takes part in a Senate investigation involving the Avengers which claims the team are national security threats. When the investigation ends, the Senate committee gives the Avengers new guidelines to follow, and the committee designates Raymond Sikorski as his successor. Writer Peter David has indicated that Shooter based Gyrich on himself. David attempted to humanize Peter by giving a backstory which touched upon Gyrich's family life. After Betty Banner criticizes Gyrich for appearing callous and unfeeling when mentioning the pain of Thunderbolt Ross dying, Gyrich cuts Banner off, saying \\"My father died of Alzheimer's, [Betty]. I took a year's leave to care for him so he wouldn't be watched over by strangers that my crummy salary couldn't even afford. I cleaned up after him, tended to him, and his last words as I cradled his dying body were, 'Who in heck are you?'\\";The Incredible Hulk (vol. 2) #456 (August 1997)\\"Q&A;\\" entry on David's blog; April 14, 2007 (The information on this point is in the April 16, 2005, 9:31 a.m. post.) Avengers: The Initiative later revealed that Gyrich's greatest fear is contracting the same disease that killed his father.Avengers: The Initiative #5 Prior to his involvement with the Avengers, Gyrich was NSA Liaison to Canada's Department H. While there, he met and had repeated issues with Canada's chief agent Wolverine. Gyrich becomes a member of the Commission of Superhuman Activities (CSA), the oversight body on superhuman activities in the United States; he's part of the team that forces Captain America to resign. Gyrich also takes part as a special consultant in a covert government designed to deal with the problems concerning mutants in the United States. The project is instrumental in creating a mutant team to counter the foreign mutants threat. Dire Wraith Henry Gyrich is later involved in war efforts against the Dire Wraith extraterrestrials. This time, he works alongside the mutant Forge who works as a weapons maker for the US government and S.H.I.E.L.D. Gyrich takes Forge's specially designed superhuman power-neutralizing gun to capture the mutant Rogue for breaking into a facility S.H.I.E.L.D. In an encounter with Rogue, Storm and government forces, Gyrich accidentally shoots Storm and his specialized weapon strips Storm's powers and abilities as a mutant (but Storm's powers return some time later). Gyrich continues attempting to use Forge's own version of Spaceknight Rom's Neutralizer, planning to use an orbital version to wipe out all superpowers on Earth. Rom and Forge stop him, however, and he can only watch while tied up as Rom banishes Wraithworld (the Dire Wraith's home world) instead of destroying all the heroes and villains. Gyrich is also involved in hunting the Hulk after Onslaught's events. Hunted by others Henry Gyrich is targeted for assassination by the current form of the Mutant Liberation Front (MLF), led by the energy-casting Reignfire. His lack of gratitude for being rescued is part of what led the mutant Feral to defect from X-Force to the MLF.X-Force Vol. 1 #27‚Äì28 (October‚ÄìNovember 1993) Gyrich is a key player in Bastion's program. He is a faithful believer in the operation until he himself becomes a target of Prime Sentinels. After being rescued by Spider-Man, Marrow and Callisto, Gyrich demands the program be shut down. Political exploits Gyrich is promoted to be Valerie Cooper's successor as the CSA's head. While there, Baron Strucker secretly places Gyrich under the control of nanites. Gyrich uses Commission resources and remolds the vigilante Nomad into the assassin Scourge and attempts to live out his \\"fantasy\\" of killing all the world's superhumans, before being stopped by the Thunderbolts. Following that incident, he's reassigned to the US State Department and is made the Black Panther's liaison as well as the Avengers' new liaison to the United Nations (by Captain America's suggestion). During this time, he redeems himself in the eyes of the team when he refuses to deliver information on the Avengers to the Red Skull (disguised as the Secretary of Defense Dell Rusk). He never breaks, even under severe torture, which impressed the others. Now a faithful liaison officer to the Avengers, Gyrich's job comes to an end after the United Nations' relationship with the Avengers ends.Avengers Disassembled Following the Civil War storyline, Gyrich is the Secretary of the Superhuman Armed Forces. His base of operations is the superhuman training facility in Stamford, Connecticut. It is under his orders that the Gauntlet is drafted as the facility's drill instructor. This comes after Gauntlet saves him from an attack by HYDRA in Iraq.Avengers: The Initiative #1 (April 2007) Gyrich gives orders to cover up MVP's death. He makes arrangements to provide a special tutor to Trauma through Hank McCoy;Avengers: The Initiative #2 (May 2007) the tutor is revealed to be depowered mutant Dani Moonstar.Avengers: The Initiative #3 They don't get along well and Gyrich fires Moonstar for training Trauma to use powers to help people with debilitating phobias instead of using these abilities as a weapon. After KIA's debacle, Gyrich had to deal with an inquiry involving the Initiative program, getting into a heated argument with Iron Man where Gyrich says to Iron Man, \\"you've got Captain America's blood on your hands!\\". Apparently fired from his position after this, he later makes a statement claiming at a press conference that he had decided to \\"retire\\" to spend time with his family. When a reporter points out that Gyrich has no living family, he declines to elaborate.Avengers: The Initiative #12 Gyrich becomes the main antagonist for Kieron Gillen's and Steven Sander's new series S.W.O.R.D. where he joins S.W.O.R.D. (Sentient World Observation and Response Department) under Norman Osborn's orders and becomes the co-leader alongside Abigail Brand. In the first volume, Gyrich manages to kidnap several notable aliens including Noh-Varr, Adam X, Jazinda, Karolina Dean and Hepzibah, all in his desire to send aliens home. He also arrests both Brand and Lockheed.S.W.O.R.D. #2 Gyrich survives an alien takeover of the installation simply by being too dosed on intruder-neutralization gas to be much of a threat. Brand, with the assistance of several super-powered beings, takes back the job and blackmails Gyrich into leaving S.W.O.R.D. alone.S.W.O.R.D. Volume 1: No Time To Breathe (120 pages, July 2010, ) (2010) While it is unknown if he was brainwashed by HYDRA or it was by his own will, Gyrich worked along HYDRA to control Dennis Dunphy and turn into the new Scourge in order to kill criminals and \\"fix the system\\". After Captain America tended him a trap, he was captured by S.H.I.E.L.D.Captain America #12‚Äì13 During the Civil War II storyline, Gyrich represented the United States as a member of the Alpha Flight Space Program's Board of Governors.Captain Marvel Vol. 9 #6 Other versions=Age of Apocalypse In the \\"Age of Apocalypse\\" alternate timeline storyline, Gyrich is an anti-mutant suicide bomber who threatens to destroy Heaven, Angel's club. He is defeated by the Bedlam Brothers. He was returned in the current \\"Age of Apocalypse\\" on-going, as a leader in the human resistance. He lost his legs, in \\"the offensive to blow the Seattle power core\\", confining him to a wheelchair, and is seen helping evaluate the now powerless Jean Grey.Factor X #1 Mutant X In the Mutant X comic, Gyrich is the government's liaison to the Avengers. He calls for the aid of the Six to search for Dracula after forces break the vampire out of the Vault prison.Mutant X #26 (December 2000) In this continuity, he again has a serious problem with Captain America.

Gyrich attempts to do so by disguising himself as Captain America and hiding agitators in the crowd; he manages to approach Mary and stab critically before he gets his hand broken by the Thing. But his plan severely backfires when Mary uses healing powers to quell the outbreaking violence amongst the crowd and, after making a full recovery, subsequently instigates the dissolution of the existing government system. Following that, Gyrich receives a visit from Captain America, who is out for revenge for Gyrich's abuse of his name and ideals.What If...? Vol.2 #30 (1991) In other media=Television * Henry Gyrich appeared in the 1990s X-Men animated series, voiced by Barry Flatman. This version is against mutants.

Gyrich and Trask are seen again in the episodes \\"The Final Decision\\" and \\"Courage\\", while on the run from Master Mold. In the series finale \\"Graduation Day\\", Gyrich speaks at an anti-Mutant summit detailing various mutant attacks. As Professor X tries to convince him that not all mutants are evil, Gyrich retaliates by attacking him with a sonic gun that puts Professor X near death and involuntarily broadcast psychic waves, revealing his target's mutant status to the world. As the X-Men present rush to Professor X's aid, Gyrich is dragged away by security guards while psychotically claiming that mutants are dangerous. * Henry Gyrich appears in the Fantastic Four: World's Greatest Heroes episode \\"Imperious Rex\\", voiced by Don Brown. * Henry Gyrich appears in The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes, voiced by Jim Ward.

History=Ancient history In the apocryphal history of Ireland, Lebor Gab√°la √ârenn, Tory Island was the site of Conand's Tower, the stronghold of the Fomorians, before they were defeated by the Nemedians in a great battle on the island. The later Fomorian king Balor of the evil eye also lived here.G. H. Kinahan \\"Donegal Folk-lore: Ballor of the Evil Eye.\\" The Folk-Lore Journal. Volume 5, 1894. Balor would imprison Ethlinn in a tower built atop Tor M√≥r (or T√∫r M√≥r in Old Irish, meaning The High Tower). Tor M√≥r is the island's highest point. A monastery was founded on Tory in the 6th century by Colmcille. The monastery dominated life on the island until 1595, when it was plundered and destroyed by English troops, waging a war of suppression against local chieftains. The monastery's bell tower is the largest structure to survive and was built in the 6th or 7th century. Early modern history In 1608, the Siege of Tory Island, one of the final incidents of O'Doherty's Rebellion, took place when a surviving group of rebels took shelter in the castle, only to begin killing each other to secure a pardon. The Battle of Tory Island, the last action in the Irish Rebellion of 1798, took place at sea nearby.

Tourism Tory Island has a number of historical and mythological sites: * D√∫n Bhaloir (Balor's Fort) is located on the island's eastern side. This peninsula is surrounded on three sides by cliffs. Balor's Fort is accessible only by crossing a narrow isthmus, defended by four earthen embankments.Oileanthorai.com ‚Äî Official Tory Island Tourism Website ‚Äì Places of Interest View from D√∫n Bhaloir * An Eochair Mh√≥r (the Big Key) is a long, steep-sided spur jutting from the east side of the peninsula and ending in a crag called An Tor M√≥r (the Big Rock or the Big Tower). The spur has prominent rocky pinnacles ‚Äì these are known as 'Balor's soldiers' (Saighdi√∫ir√≠ Bhaloir). They give the spur a 'toothed' appearance and contribute to the name, 'the Big Key'. An Tor M√≥r * The Wishing Stone is a precipitous flat-topped rock beside the northern cliff-face of Balor's Fort. Traditionally, a wish is granted to anyone foolhardy enough to step onto the rock, or who succeeds in throwing three stones onto it. * An Cloigtheach (the Bell Tower) is the largest structure to have survived the destruction of the monastery (see history section above). The round tower was built in the 6th or 7th century. * The Tau Cross (a t-shaped cross) is believed to date from the 12th century. It is one of only two Tau crosses in Ireland (the other being in Kilnaboy, County Clare). * M√≥irsheisear (Grave of the Seven): M√≥irsheisear, which actually translates as 'big six' ‚Äì a term for seven ‚Äì is the tomb of seven people, six men and one woman, who drowned when their boat capsized off Scoilt an Mh√≥irsheisear (the Cleft of the Seven) on the island's northwest coast. According to local superstition, clay from the woman's grave has the power to ward off vermin. * The Lighthouse, standing at the west end of the island, was built between 1828 and 1832 to a design by George Halpin, a noted designer of Irish lighthouses. In April 1990, the lighthouse was automated. The lighthouse is one of three in Ireland in which a reference station for the Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) is installed. The lighthouse is at coordinates * The Torpedo: A torpedo can be seen midway between An Baile Thiar and An Baile Thoir.

A flaming chalice is the most widely used symbol of Unitarianism and Unitarian Universalism (UUism) and the official logo of the Unitarian Universalist Association (UUA) and other Unitarian and UU churches and societies. Origins The symbol had its origins in a logo designed by Austrian refugee Hans Deutsch for the Unitarian Service Committee (USC) (now the Unitarian Universalist Service Committee) during World War II. According to USC director Charles Joy, Deutsch took his inspiration from the chalices of oil burned on ancient Greek and Roman altars. It became an underground symbol in occupied Europe during World War II for those assisting Unitarians, Jews, and other people to escape Nazi persecution.\\"The Flaming Chalice\\", by Dan Hotchkiss, Pamphlets, Unitarian Universalist Association (2007). > Living in Paris during the 1930s Deutsch drew critical cartoons of Adolf > Hitler.

From his Lisbon > headquarters, Joy oversaw a secret network of couriers and agents.The > History of the Flaming Chalice, About Unitarian Universalism, Unitarian > Universalist Association (2007). After 1941, the flaming chalice symbol spread throughout Unitarianism in America and the rest of the world. This spread continued after Unitarians in North America merged with Universalists to form the Unitarian Universalist Association. The symbol gradually became more than a printed logo. By the 1960s, people like Fred Weideman of Dearborn, Michigan, were making flaming chalice jewelry. Some congregations began displaying the symbol in their worship spaces. At some point, three-dimensional chalices were made to be lit during worship services, but the origin(s) of this usage remains obscure. Interpretation This symbol of Christian Universalism was already in use decades prior to the creation of the Unitarian Universalist Association The chalice is off center. This was taken from the Universalist symbol, the Off- Center Cross. The interpretation of the Off-Center Cross is that, while Universalism is based in Christianity, there is room for the Love and Wisdom of other religions. The chalice symbol is often shown surrounded by two linked rings (see illustration). The two linked rings were based on the quote from the poet and life long Universalist Edwin Markham, \\"He drew a circle that shut me out -- Heretic, rebel, a thing to flout. But Love and I had the wit to win: We drew a circle and took him in!\\" It also served as a symbol signifying the joining of Unitarianism and Universalism in 1961. In August 1962, the newsletter of the Midwestern Unitarian Universalist Association began using a chalice symbol drawn inside the two interlocking rings, as drawn by Betty King. There is no orthodox interpretation of the flaming chalice symbol. In one interpretation, the chalice is a symbol of religious freedom from the impositions of doctrine by a hierarchy and open to participation by all; the flame is interpreted as a memorial to those throughout history who sacrificed their lives for the cause of religious liberty. In another interpretation, the flaming chalice resembles a cross, symbolic of the Christian roots of Unitarian and Universalism.The History of the Flaming Chalice, supra. Later, associations were made between this symbol and the Hussites religious sect. Czech reformer Jan Hus (1369‚Äì1415) began reading the Bible to his congregations in their native language, while the Catholic Church demanded that the Bible only be read in Latin. Also, during communion, the chalice was reserved for the clergy; the laity only received bread. When a church council condemned the practice of priests who were giving the chalice to their congregants, Hus refused to support the condemnation. After his execution by burning in 1415, followers of Hus adopted the \\"lay chalice\\" as an important symbol of their movement.Arnason, Wayne B. and Rebecca Scott. We Would Be One: A History of Unitarian Universalist Youth Movements. Boston: Unitarian Universalist Association of Congregations, 2005, p. 58. Accessed June 7, 2009. Usage Service leader preparing to extinguish the flaming chalice at Nora UU Church in Minnesota Ceremonial lighting Many Unitarian Universalist and Unitarian congregations and organizations feature flaming chalice symbolism on their signs, logos, and in their meeting places. Some congregations light a chalice displayed prominently in their worship space while saying opening words at the beginning of weekly worship services. The texts used during these \\"chalice lightings\\" vary; some congregations use a ritual formula while at others these words are spoken extemporaneously. Outside of weekly worship services, many small gatherings of Unitarian Universalists incorporate a lit chalice, often accompanied by readings, as a reminder of the religious nature of the gathering. Unitarian Universalists, Unitarians and Universalists might also display a flaming chalice on clothing, jewelry, their cars, or in their homes as a symbol of their faith, much as Christians display a cross or as Jews display a Star of David. In keeping with the traditions of religious pluralism and individualism, there is no requirement, doctrinal or otherwise, that congregations or adherents use or acknowledge the flaming chalice as a religious symbol.

The family is small, with just eight species in three genera represented; they are distributed throughout tropical to subtropical waters of the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans. These fishes are named for their oversized, recurved palatine teeth, similar to those of saber-toothed cats (and the prehistoric Enchodus). The family is named Evermannellidae after Barton Warren Evermann, noted ichthyologist, naturalist and director of the California Academy of Sciences.  Description  Sabertooth fishes have moderately elongated and compressed bodies which lack normal scales. The head is large and blunt; the terminal mouth is large and lined with slender palatine teeth, and the front is mostly enlarged and is curved inward slightly. A number of shorter, straighter teeth accompany these fang-like teeth. The tongue is toothless. The eyes range in size from small to large; they are tubular in structure and point upwards. The lateral line runs uninterrupted. The different families have 44-54 vertebrae, with three discrete bands of muscle tissue (epaxial, midlateral, and hypaxial) present in the caudal region. Sabertooths do not have swim bladders, and the stomach is highly distensible. A single high dorsal fin (with 10-13 rays) originates slightly before the thoracic pelvic fins. The anal fin (26-37 rays) is the largest of the fins, and runs along the posterior half of the fish, tapering in height towards the emarginated caudal fin. A small adipose fin is also present. The pectoral fins (11-13 rays) are positioned rather low on the body. All fins are spineless and lightly pigmented in shades of brown. Sabertooth fish are usually a drab, light to dark brown when preserved; however, a brassy green iridescence is seen on the flanks, cheeks, and ocular region of well- preserved specimens. The naked skin is easily torn. The Atlantic sabertooth (Coccorella atlantica) is the largest species, at up to 18.5 cm standard length.  Life history  Almost nothing is known of the biology and ecology of evermannellids. They are active, visual predators and confine themselves to the mesopelagic zone, about 200‚Äì1,000 m down; they are most commonly trawled from between 200 and 400 m. At these depths, extremely little light is available; the view from below is like the sky at twilight. The sabertooth fish use their telescopic, upward-pointing eyes--which are thus adapted for improved terminal vision at the expense of lateral vision--to pick out squid, cuttlefish, and smaller fish silhouetted against the gloom above them. Their distensible stomachs allow sabertooth fish to swallow prey larger than themselves; their recurved teeth likely function in a manner similar to a snake's, preventing a captured fish from backing out and helping to guide the fish down the sabertooth's pharynx. Sabertooth fish are solitary animals; it is not known whether they undergo diel vertical migrations. Their reproductive habits are poorly studied; they are assumed to be nonguarding, pelagic spawners. True synchronous hermaphroditism with external fertilization is known in Evermannella indica and Odontostomops normalops, and the former species appears to spawn throughout the year. Sabertooth fish larvae are planktonic and have long snouts and oblong eyes before metamorphosis. Both larvae and juveniles remain at shallower depths of 50‚Äì100 m, descending to deeper water with age.  References  * * Fishes: An introduction to ichthyology. Peter B. Moyle and Joseph J.

The term specifically refers to the method of collecting the platelets, which is performed by a device used in blood donation that separates the platelets and returns other portions of the blood to the donor. Platelet transfusion can be a life-saving procedure in preventing or treating serious complications from bleeding and hemorrhage in patients who have disorders manifesting as thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) or platelet dysfunction. This process may also be used therapeutically to treat disorders resulting in extraordinarily high platelet counts such as essential thrombocytosis. Platelet transfusion Platelet transfusions are traditionally given to those undergoing chemotherapy for leukemia, multiple myeloma, those with aplastic anemia, AIDS, hypersplenism, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), sepsis, bone marrow transplant, radiation treatment, organ transplant or surgeries such as cardiopulmonary bypass. Platelet transfusions should be avoided in those with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) because it can worsen neurologic symptoms and acute renal failure, presumably due to creation of new thrombi as the platelets are consumed. It should also be avoided in those with heparin- induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). In adults, platelets are recommended in those who have levels less than 10,000/¬µL, less than 20,000/¬µL if a central venous catheter is being placed, or less than 50,000/¬µL if a lumbar puncture or major surgery is required. Whole blood platelets Platelets collected by using apheresis at an American Red Cross donation center. Not all platelet transfusions use platelets collected by automated apheresis. The platelets can also be separated from donations of whole blood collected in a traditional blood donation, but there are several advantages to separating the platelets at the time of collection. The first advantage is that the whole-blood platelets, sometimes called \\"random\\" platelets, from a single donation are not numerous enough for a dose to give to an adult patient. They must be pooled from several donors to create a single transfusion, and this complicates processing and increases the risk of diseases that can be spread in transfused blood, such as human immunodeficiency virus. Collecting the platelets from a single donor also simplifies human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matching, which improves the chance of a successful transfusion. Since it is time-consuming to find even a single compatible donor for HLA-matched transfusions, being able to collect a full dose from a single donor is much more practical than finding multiple compatible donors. Plateletpheresis products are also easier to test for bacterial contamination, a leading cause of transfusion-associated deaths. Pooling of whole blood platelets is often done in an \\"open\\" system where the platelet containers are connected in a way that could expose the platelets to air, and pooled platelets must be transfused promptly so that any contamination does not have time to grow. Problems with apheresis include the expense of the equipment used for collection. Whole blood platelets also do not require any additional donor recruitment, as they can be made from blood donations that are also used for packed red blood cells and plasma components. Thrombocytopenia due to underproduction Recipients in this category include those undergoing chemotherapy, those with myelophthisic anemia, AIDS, or with aplastic anemia. If indicated, transfusions (one thrombapheresis concentrate) should be given until recovery of platelet function, generally approximately twice weekly. Surgical bleeding due solely to thrombocytopenia occurs when platelets < 50,000/¬µL while spontaneous bleeding occurs when platelets < 10,000/¬µL. Thrombocytopenic patients can develop \\"dry\\" bleeding, that is, petechiae and ecchymoses only. They will not suffer fatal hemorrhagic events unless they first have extensive mucosal bleeding, or \\"wet\\" bleeding. Therefore, in those with no bleeding or only \\"dry\\" bleeding, the threshold for transfusion should be between 5,000 and 10,000/¬µL. A more conservative threshold of 20,000/¬µL should be used in those with a fever or other risk factors for bleeding. Those with active bleeding or prior to surgery should have a threshold of 50,000/¬µL. An unconfirmed, but helpful, way to determine whether a patient is recovering from chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia is to measure \\"reticulated\\" platelets, or young RNA-containing platelets, which signifies that the patient is starting to make new platelets. Immune thrombocytopenia Recipients in this category include those with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura or drug-induced thrombocytopenia. Platelet transfusions are generally not recommended for this group of patients because the underlying cause involves antibodies that destroy platelets, therefore any newly transfused platelets will also be destroyed. Platelets transfusions may be used in emergency bleeding situations where the platelets could be used by the body before the immune system destroys them. More studies need to be done. Altered platelet functions Disorders of platelet function can be congenital or acquired. Most of these disorders are mild and may respond to therapy with desmopressin (dDAVP). Transfusion is not necessarily required. However, with some more severe disorders such as Glanzmann thrombasthenia, transfusions with large amount of platelets may be needed. The number of transfusions may be reduced if these patients are given recombinant human factor VIIa since the underlying cause are antibodies to platelet glycoproteins IIb/IIIa. Cardiopulmonary bypass surgery Cardiopulmonary bypass surgery can result in destruction of a large proportion of the patient's platelets and may render the remaining viable platelets to be dysfunctional. The indications for transfusion in such patients is controversial. General guidelines recommend not transfusing patients prophylactically but only when they are bleeding excessively, while also giving desmopressin. Drug-induced platelet dysfunction The most common of these is aspirin, and its similar drug class, the NSAIDs. Other antiplatelet drugs are commonly prescribed for patients with acute coronary syndromes such as clopidogrel and ticlopidine. When surgery is undertaken following the administration of these drugs, bleeding can be serious. Transfusion under these circumstances is not clear-cut and one has to use clinical judgment in these cases.  Expected platelet increase after transfusion  Platelet count increase as well as platelet survival after transfusion is related to the dose of platelets infused and to the patient's body surface area (BSA). Usually these values are less than what would be expected. * Corrected platelet count increment (CCI) = platelet increment at one hr x BSA (m2) / # platelets infused x 1011 * Expected platelet increase (per ŒºL) = platelets infused x CCI / BSA (m2) The theoretical value of the CCI is 20,000/ŒºL but clinically, the value is closer to 10,000/ŒºL. If the CCI is less than 5,000/ŒºL, patients are said to have \\"refractoriness\\" to platelet transfusion.  Platelet collection  A single line cartridge based, centrifuge machine. Collecting a 'double unit' in this instance. The separation of individual blood components is done with a specialized centrifuge (see apheresis). The earliest manual forms of thrombapheresis are done by the separation of platelets from multiple bags of whole blood collected from donors or blood sellers. Since each blood bag (usually 250 mL or 500 mL) contains a relatively small number of platelets, it can take as many as a dozen blood bags (usually from 5 to 10 bags, depending on the size of the blood bags and each donor's platelet count) to accumulate a single unit of platelets (enough for one patient). This greatly increases the risks of the transfusion. Each unit of platelets separated from donated whole blood is called a \\"platelet concentrate\\". Modern automatic thrombapheresis allows blood donors to give a portion of their platelets, while keeping their red blood cells and at least a portion of blood plasma. Therefore, no more than three units of platelets are generally harvested in any one sitting from a donor. Most donors will donate a \\"single\\" or \\"double\\" unit, however the occurrence of \\"triples\\" has been increasing as more suitable donors are recruited. Because platelets have a shelf life of just 5 days, more platelet donors are always needed. Some centers are experimenting with 7 day platelets, but this requires additional testing and the lack of any preservative solutions means that the product is far more effective when fresh. Even though red blood cells can also be collected in the process, many blood donation organizations do not do so because it takes much longer for the human body to replenish their loss. In addition, some (though not all) centers defer further platelet donations until the red blood cells can be replenished. In most cases, blood plasma is returned to the donor as well. However, in locations that have plasma processing facilities, a part of the donor's plasma can also be collected in a separate blood bag (see plasmapheresis). For example, in Australia around 5.9√ó1011 platelets and 580ml of plasma might be collected from an 88kg donor.  Leukoreduction  Due to their higher relative density, white blood cells are collected as an unwanted component with the platelets. Since it takes up to 3 liters of whole blood (the amount of a dozen blood bags) to generate a dose of platelets, white blood cells from one or several donors will also be collected along with the platelets. A 70 kg (154 lb) man has only about 6 liters of blood. If all of the incidentally collected white blood cells are transfused with the platelets, substantial rejection problems can occur. Therefore, it is standard practice to filter out white blood cells before transfusion by the process of leukoreduction. Early platelet transfusions used a filter to remove white blood cells at the time of transfusion. It takes a trained person about 10 minutes to assemble the equipment, and this is not the safest or most efficient means of filtration because living white blood cells can release cytokines during storage and dead white blood cells can break up into smaller fragments that can still stimulate a dangerous response from the immune system. In addition, simple filtration can lead to increased risks of infection and loss of valuable platelets. Newer, more advanced thrombapheresis machines can filter white blood cells during separation. For example, with marginally acceptable whole blood (white blood cells: < 10,000/mm¬≥; platelets: > 150,000/mm¬≥), a dose (3√ó1011) of platelets comes with about 2√ó1010 white blood cells. This can seriously damage the patient's health. A dose of single- donor platelets prepared using latest filters can contain as little as 5√ó106 white blood cells.  Apheresis  There are two types of manual platelet apheresis. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is widely used in North America and buffy coat (BC) is more widely used in Europe. Plasma can be collected simultaneously with a platelet donation. Platelets are the clotting cells of the blood, and when donated, frequently go to cancer patients, because due to chemotherapy many cancer patients are unable to generate enough platelets of their own. The basic principles of automatic platelet apheresis are the same as in the manual procedure, but the whole procedure is performed by a computer-controlled machine. Since the donor's blood is processed in a sterile single-use centrifuge, the unwanted components can be returned to the donor safely. This allows the apheresis machine to repeat the draw-centrifuge-return cycle to obtain more platelets. The bulk of the machine and the length of the donation process means most platelet donations are done in blood centers instead of mobile blood drives. Each country has its own rules to protect the safety of both donor and recipient. In a typical set of rules, a platelet donor must weigh at least 50 kg (110 lb) and have a platelet count of at least 150 x 109/L (150,000 platelets per mm¬≥). One unit has greater than 3√ó1011 platelets. Therefore, it takes 2 liters of blood having a platelet count of 150,000/mm¬≥ to produce one unit of platelets. Some regular donors have higher platelet counts (over 300,000/mm¬≥); for those donors, it only takes about one liter of their blood to produce a unit. Since the machine used to perform the procedure uses suction to draw blood out of a donor's body, some people who can give whole blood may have veins too small for platelet donation. Blood centers evaluate each donor's veins prior to donation. Blood accounts for about 8% of body weight, so a 50 kg (110 lb) donor has about four liters of blood. No more than 50% of a donor's platelets are ever extracted in one sitting, and they can be replenished by the body in about three days. Most newer apheresis machines can separate a maximum donation of platelets in about 60 to 120 minutes depending on the donor's health condition. Platelet donation After a short physical examination, the donor is taken into the donation room and sits in a chair next to the machine. The technician cleans one or both arms with iodine, or other disinfectant, and inserts the catheter into a vein in the arm. With some procedures both arms are used, one to draw blood and the other to return it. The process takes about one to two hours while blood is pulled into the machine, mixed with an anticoagulant such as sodium citrate, spun around, and returned to the donor. \\"Double needle\\" procedures using both arms tend to be shorter since the blood is drawn and returned through different catheters; with \\"single needle\\" procedures a set volume is drawn and processed in the first part of the cycle and returned in the second part. The donor's blood undergoes repeated cycles of draw and return. Side effects of the donation of platelets generally fall into three categories: blood pressure changes, problems with vein access, and effects of the anticoagulant on the donor's calcium level. Blood pressure changes can sometimes cause nausea, fatigue, and dizziness. Venous access problems can cause bruising, referred to as a hematoma. While donating, a supply of calcium antacid tablets is usually kept close by to replenish the calcium lost. Because the anticoagulant works by binding to the calcium in the blood, a donor's levels of calcium ‚Äì and especially of active calcium ions ‚Äì drop during the donation process. The lips may begin to tingle or there may be a metallic taste; since calcium enables the function of the nervous system, nerve-ending-dense areas (such as the lips) are susceptible, at least during the donation process. Unusually low calcium can cause more serious problems such as fainting, nerve irritation and short-duration tetany. Such an acute hypocalcaemia is usually due to low calcium levels prior to donation, aggravated by the anticoagulant. Hypocalcaemia can be curtailed by modestly increasing dietary calcium intake in the days prior to donation. Serious problems are extremely rare, but apheresis donors are typically not allowed to sleep during the long donation process so that they can be monitored. Aside from the procedure, donating platelets is different from donating blood in a few ways. Firstly, the donor must not take aspirin or other anti-platelet medications such as clopidogrel (Plavix) for anywhere from 36 to 72 hours prior to donation. (Guidelines vary by blood center.) The reason is that aspirin can prevent platelets from adhering to clot bleeding. Some blood centers also prohibit the taking of any NSAID (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug) for 36 hours prior. Secondly, one is generally allowed to donate platelets anywhere from every 3‚Äì28 days. This is a stark contrast to whole- blood donation, which has an eight-week (or longer) waiting period between donations. Along those lines, since platelet donation does temporarily remove whole blood from the body, it may be necessary to wait eight weeks after a whole blood donation to donate platelets, although two weeks is more common. In the US, a donor is only allowed to donate 24 times each year and may not lose more red blood cells or plasma in a year than they would from the maximum allowable number of whole blood donations. In India, as per Ministry of Health the blood donation interval criteria for apheresis requires at least 48 hours interval after platelet/plasma - apheresis. The donation should not be done more than 2 times a week and should also be limited to 24 times in one year. Thirdly, additional tests may be required before becoming a donor for the first time. These tests may establish a platelet count. Newer automated platelet pheresis machines do that as the donation begins, and adjust accordingly the quantity of platelets to be drawn. Tests may also determine the donor's compatibility with particular recipients through an HLA (Human Leukocyte Antigen) test. Multiparous women may be excluded from becoming donors due to heightened TRALI risk. These tests usually involve nothing more involved than the drawing of several tubes of blood. Adverse events A hematoma caused by a dislodged needle during a plateletpheresis donation. Adverse conditions that can happen during a plateletpheresis donation are hypocalcemia, hematoma formation, and vasovagal reactions. The risk of these conditions happening can be reduced or prevented by pre-donation education of the donors and change of apheresis machine configuration. =Vein scarring= Repeated platelet donations at short intervals will cause the venipuncture site to scar. While cosmetically it is virtually invisible, the scarring also occurs on the vein itself, making it harder to insert a needle on future occasions. Anecdotal reports have said that rubbing vitamin E oil (or the insides of a vitamin E capsule) on the venipuncture site may reduce scarring. However, a study conducted by the University of Miami Department of Dermatology and Cutaneous Surgery in 1999 demonstrated no positive effect from the application of topical vitamin E. Scarring of veins may also cause problems for further attempts to draw blood, such as for medical procedures. This may confuse phlebotomists who may believe they have missed the vein due to the higher pressure needed to penetrate the scar tissue.

Viskovatiy rose to the rank of dyak in 1549 during the time of Ivan the Terrible's intensive organizational activities. Together with Alexei Adashev, he managed Russia's foreign relations until his death. Historians believe that the Posolsky Prikaz was finally formed in 1556 owing to the efforts of Viskovatiy. He was also the one to inventory the archives of the ministry of foreign affairs. In 1561, Viskovatiy was appointed the keeper of the seal, combining, thus, the custody of the seal of the Russian state with the diplomatic department. This tradition would be in place until the 17th century. As keeper of the seal, Viskovatiy was also made a member of the Boyar Duma. When Ivan the Terrible became seriously ill in 1553, Viskovatiy was the first one to propose to the tsar to choose a successor. He was also among the first to support the nomination of the young Dmitry Ivanovich. In 1554, Viskovatiy was appointed a member of the boyar investigation committee regarding Prince Semeon Rostovsky's treason. That same year, Viskovatiy had to appear before the ecumenical council of the Russian Orthodox Church because he had been influenced by Matvei Bashkin's heresy and had drawn other people into accepting it. The council treated him with leniency and inflicted a three-year penance upon him. In 1563, Viskovatiy went on a diplomatic mission to Denmark to hold negotiations on Livonian affairs; that was the time when tensions between Denmark and Sweden were building up towards the Northern Seven Years' War, in which Russia did not take part, but was a very interested observer. In 1566, Viskovatiy took part in the Zemsky Sobor. Viskovatiy managed to escape the tsar's disgrace during the 1560s. He had to pay dearly, however, for his alleged involvement in a still unclear affair in 1570. Viskovatiy was accused of his alleged intentions to give Novgorod to the Polish king and Astrakhan and Kazan to the Turkish sultan. He was publicly executed on 25 July 1570 in Moscow.

It was conceived by Jorge Beltran and Victor Basurto as a special project that would detach from the sound of previous bands they had played and recorded with in the past, namely Loch Ness, Humus, Frolic Froth, and Semefo. All these bands had achieved critical acclaim in many underground quarters, since their releases were distributed from inception in the late 1980s in Europe, USA, and as far as New Zealand. So STCA became an experimental band, using instruments that were never featured, or had little prominence in the other bands, but most distinctively, the total lack of electric guitars and standard drum sets. Heavily relying on keyboards and varied percussion, and bass as a leading improvisational force, the band released first eponymous album in 1996. They succeeded in sounding totally different from previous recordings, creating original atmospheres and landscapes with an acoustic twist. Though some fans felt that Beltran and Basurto had lost direction, the album did gain them a new following. At the same time Humus and Frolic Froth continued active with the preparation of follow up albums for both bands, in their own unique psychedelic and heavy styles. It was during a European tour of Humus in 1997 that Victor Basurto settled in the Netherlands, but that wasn't and hasn't been an impediment for both musicians to continue collaborating, recording and releasing albums, with the constant mail-exchange of tapes. It was through this fashion that all their records since then have been produced, including a second album by STCA recorded in 1999 named Animated Weigtlessness (released 2002), which went even farther than the first in the difficult task of trying to categorize it. The album got rave reviews in yet new international quarters, many of them not even linking STCA to Beltran and Basurto's other \\"established\\" acts. Animated Weightlessness was released in own independent label Nuggetphase. The name of the band was inspired by the song \\"Smoking the day away\\" by May Blitz, though some purists hated the fact that this formation had little or non resemblance to the May Blitz sound. Originally, the band was conceived to release records only until the end of the 20th century, but since their second album was released in the 21st, there might be a new release in the future. As of February 2005, the two founding members continue with their never ending exchange of tapes.

The Horatian ode format and style has been emulated since by other poets. Books 1 to 3 were published in 23 BC. A fourth book, consisting of 15 poems, was published in 13 BC. The Odes were developed as a conscious imitation of the short lyric poetry of Greek originals ‚Äì Pindar, Sappho and Alcaeus are some of Horace's models. His genius lay in applying these older forms to the social life of Rome in the age of Augustus. The Odes cover a range of subjects ‚Äì Love, Friendship, Wine, Religion, Morality, Patriotism; poems of eulogy addressed to Augustus and his relations; and verses written on a miscellany of subjects and incidents, including the uncertainty of life, the cultivation of tranquility and contentment, and the observance of moderation or the \\"golden mean.\\"For a discussion of the classification of Horace's Odes, see The Works of Horace Rendered into English Prose by James Lonsdale, M.A. and Samuel Lee, M.A. London: Macmillan and Co., 1883, p. 22 and Horace: The Complete Works by Charles E. Bennett and John Carew Rolfe. Boston: Allyn & Bacon, 1901, pp. xvii-xxii. The Odes have been considered traditionally by English-speaking scholars as purely literary works. Recent evidence by a Horatian scholar suggests they may have been intended as performance art, a Latin re- interpretation of Greek lyric song. The Roman writer Petronius, writing less than a century after Horace's death, remarked on the curiosa felicitas (studied spontaneity) of the Odes (Satyricon 118). The English poet Alfred Lord Tennyson declared that the Odes provided \\"jewels five-words long, that on the stretched forefinger of all Time / Sparkle for ever\\" (The Princess, part II, l.355). Book 1 Book 1 consists of 38 poems.All Latin text courtesy of thelatinlibrary.comSummaries are taken from: * The Works of Horace Rendered into English Prose by James Lonsdale, M.A. and Samuel Lee, M.A. London: Macmillan and Co., 1883; * Horace: The Complete Works by Charles E.

Book 3 \\"Justum et tenacem propositi virum\\" ‚Äì \\"a man just and steadfast in purpose\\", from Horace's Odes, III.3, on the gravestone of Elliot Charles Bovill, Chief Justice of the Straits Settlements, in Fort Canning Green, Singapore The ancient editor Porphyrion read the first six odes of this book as a single sequence, one unified by a common moral purpose and addressed to all patriotic citizens of Rome. These six \\"Roman odes\\", as they have since been called (by HT Pl√ºss in 1882), share a common meter and take as a common theme the glorification of Roman virtues and the attendant glory of Rome under Augustus. Ode III.2 contains the famous line \\"Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori,\\" (It is sweet and honorable to die for one's country). Ode III.5 Caelo tonantem credidimus Jovem makes explicit identification of Augustus as a new Jove destined to restore in modern Rome the valor of past Roman heroes like Marcus Atilius Regulus, whose story occupies the second half of the poem. Book 3 consists of 30 poems. III.1, Odi profanum vulgus et arceo... ‚Äì On Happiness ‚Äì Philosophy is a mystery which the uninitiated crowd cannot understand. The worthlessness of riches and rank.

Juno's speech to the gods on the destiny of Rome. III.4, Descende caelo et dic age tibia... ‚Äì On Wise Counsel and Clemency ‚Äì The Muses have guarded and given counsel to Horace since his youth. They also do so to Augustus, and prompt him to clemency and kindness. The evils of violence and arrogance, on the other hand, are exemplified by the Titans and Giants, and others. III.5, Caelo tonantem credidimus Iovem... ‚Äì To Augustus ‚Äì On Virtue and Fortitude ‚Äì Augustus will be recognized as a god on earth for his subjugation of the Britons and Parthians. The disgraceful actions of the troops of Crassus (who married Parthians after being taken prisoner) are contrasted by the noble example of Regulus (who was released from Carthage to negotiate a peace, but dissuaded the Senate, and then returned to Carthage to be tortured to death). III.6, Delicta maiorum inmeritus lues... ‚Äì Piety & Chastity ‚Äì Return to the Old Morals! ‚Äì Horace condemns the prevailing domestic immorality and contempt of the institutions of religion, and earnestly urges a speedy return to the simpler and purer manners of ancient times. III.7, Quid fles, Asterie, quem tibi candidi... ‚Äì Constancy, Asterie! ‚Äì Horace consoles Asterie on the absence of her lover Gyges, and warns her not to be unfaithful to her own vows.

III.9, Donec gratus eram tibi... ‚Äì The Reconciliation of Two Lovers ‚Äì Often referred to as an \\"Amoebaean\\" ode (from the Greek Œ±ŒºŒµŒØŒ≤œâ ‚Äì to exchange), it describes, in graceful dialogue, a quarrel between two lovers and their reconciliation. III.10, Extremum Tanain si biberes, Lyce... ‚Äì A Lover's Complaint ‚Äì Horace warns Lyce that he cannot put up with her unkindness forever. III.11, Mercuri, ‚Äì nam te docilis magistro... ‚Äì Take Warning, Lyde, from the Danaids! ‚Äì To Mercury ‚Äì Horace begs the god to teach him such melody as will overcome the unkindness of Lyde. The ode concludes with the tale of the daughters of Danaus, and their doom in the underworld. III.12, Miserarum est neque amori dare ludum... ‚Äì Unhappy Neobule ‚Äì Joyless is the life of Neobule, ever under the watchful eye of a strict guardian. Only thoughts of handsome Hebrus take her mind off her troubles. III.13, O fons Bandusiae splendidior vitro... ‚Äì O, Fountain of Bandusia! ‚Äì Tomorrow a sacrifice will be offered to the fountain of Bandusia, whose refreshing coolness is offered to the flocks and herds, and which is now immortalized in verse.

Initially a follower of Partholon, he alone survived the plague, or the Flood, that killed the rest of his people. Through a series of animal transformations he survived into Christian times, and, in conversation with St. Finnian of Moville told a brief history of himself and of Ireland from his people onward to the coming of St. Patrick. Sources His legend is found in an 11th Century manuscript called Lebor na hUidre (The Book of Dun Cow); in a 15th Century manuscript called Laud 610 kept at the Bodleian Library, Oxford; and in a 16th Century manuscript labeled H.3.18 at Trinity College, Dublin. Summary Tuan who was a hermit or recluse, told St. Finnan that he was born 2000 years earlier and witnessed many of the waves of invaders who came to ancient Ireland - the Nemedians, Fir Bolg and the Tuatha De Dannan. As a lone human guarding the land, he grew hairy, clawed and gray. And he witnessed the invasion of Nemed (who he says was his father's brother), and woke up one day to find himself reborn as a vigorous young stag. The ancient stag watched the Nemedians perish, and was again reborn into a young wild boar, and became the king of the boar-herds, witnessing the taking of Ireland by Semion, leader of the Fir Bolg. Then he became a great hawk (or eagle) and saw Ireland seized by the Tuatha D√© Danann and the Milesians. Later reincarnated into a salmon, he was caught by a fisherman serving a chieftain called Cairill, and was eaten whole by the Cairill's wife, and passed into her womb to be reborn again as Tuan mac (son of) Cairill.

Since 1996, it has formed part of the United States Virgin Islands, a United States territory located in the Caribbean Sea. The island is of volcanic origin and lies to the south of Saint Thomas in the Charlotte Amalie harbor. Ferry service runs regularly from Crown Bay, Saint Thomas to Phillips Landing, Water Island; the ferry ride is about 10 minutes. At in size is administratively part (with Hassel Island) of the subdistrict of Water Island, in Saint Thomas District. Water Island is a residential island, with a population of 182 (2010 census) and no significant commercial establishments. A number of homes on Water Island are available to accommodate visitors. The main attractions are beaches, including Honeymoon Beach, plantation ruins, Fort Segarra, an underground fort partially constructed by the U.S. during World War II, and scuba diving site Supermarket Reef in Limestone Bay. The eastern third of the island is a gated community, Sprat Bay Estates. This includes Sprat Point, a 30-acre peninsula and nature preserve owned by the United States Department of the Interior, and private Sprat Bay Beach, located between Sprat Point and Carol Point. All beaches in the USVI are public when approached from the water. History The earliest settlers were Ta√≠no in the 15th century. Water Island was named by Europeans for its natural ponds of freshwater. Many islands in the Lesser Antilles lack potable water, so Water Island was a frequent stop for pirates seeking to replenish their ships' stores of freshwater. Danish claims to the island date to at least 1769. During the 18th century and early 19th century, the island was owned by several free black and mulatto people who had cotton plantations and raised livestock. In 1905, the island was sold to the Danish East Asiatic Company. The U.S. believed that the company acted as a front for Germany and sought to establish a German naval base and commercial presence on Saint Thomas. While the rest of the Danish West Indies were purchased by the United States in 1917, Water Island was not purchased by the U.S. until June 19, 1944, when it was purchased for $10,000 to protect the submarine base on Saint Thomas during World War II. From 1944 to 1950, the island was under the operation of the Department of Defense. Construction on Fort Segarra commenced in 1944 but the fort was abandoned incomplete in 1948. The United States Army's Chemical Warfare Division used sections of Water Island to test chemical warfare agents, including predecessors of Agent Orange, from 1948 until 1950. It was then turned over to the Department of the Interior and leased out, primarily to residential tenants. Control of Water Island was transferred from the federal government to the territorial government on December 12, 1996, for the sum of $25,000,000.00 (the same amount the federal government paid for the entire U.S. Virgin Islands in 1917) making Water Island the \\"Last Virgin\\". In the late 1990s, the Department of the Interior began transferring Water Island land to the long-time residential leaseholders. In 2005, the U.S. Virgin Islands government announced plans to further develop Water Island, and to increase the amount of residential housing to deal with chronic shortages on Saint Thomas. The Water Island Civic Association (WICA) was formed in the mid-1960s to help improve the quality of life on Water Island. Today, the association has over 100 members and it interacts and cooperates with the U.S. Virgin Islands government to help protect the environment on Water Island. Water Island residents pay to have the beach maintained and provide volunteers for clean-up efforts around the island. Notable features=Honeymoon Beach Honeymoon beach as it appears today One of the principal attractions of Water Island is Honeymoon beach, in Druif Bay, on the west end of the island. Initially Honeymoon Beach could hardly be called a beach. It was an area about long strewn with vegetation and rocks and only extended about from the water line. The trees and brush were removed, 200 truck loads of rock and gravel were hauled off, and the beach stone was broken up with a bulldozer. The sand was sifted to remove any remaining debris and a dredge was used to remove the seaweed and to deposit sand on the shore. Rows of palm trees were planted back from the shoreline. This was all accomplished under the direction of Walter Phillips, the Master Leaseholder in the early 1950s. In the 1970s Water Island was also home to a sizable hotel called the \\"Water Island Colony Club\\" which offered villas for rent as well as hotel rooms. The name was changed to \\"Sugar Bird\\" and met its demise when hurricane Hugo hit. The barracks for Fort Segarra were used as housing for the employees of the hotel. Fort Segarra Fort Segarra 2013. Fort Segarra was built as part of the United States' defense strategies during World War II on Water Island in the U.S. Virgin Islands in the Caribbean. World War II seacoast batteries here were Battery 314 at Flamingo Point (1944, never completed) and an Anti Motor Torpedo Boat Batteries. In addition, some barracks, watch towers, ammunition bunkers were also created near Carolina Point as well as an infrastructure of docks, roads, water, sewage and power systems. It was to be an underground fort and its purpose was to protect the submarine base on Saint Thomas. The war ended before its completion and the project was subsequently abandoned. The uncompleted post was transferred to the Army's Chemical Warfare Division in 1948 for testing poison gas and chemical agents on goats and pigeons for several years. Following the conclusion of these tests, the Army transferred control of this area to the Interior Department in 1952.http://seestjohn.com/water_island_lease.html Gun emplacements, tunnels and underground rooms which were created during the World War II building efforts are still visible. The site is now open for viewing, and tunnels and underground chambers are open for tours. The area is monitored by the United States Army Corps of Engineers and soil samples are monitored from the former chemical test sites to ensure \\"that no residual contamination remains from previous Department of Defense activities.\\" Visiting Water Island The island can be reached by a people ferry from Crown Bay Marina or by other vessels. The ferry takes passengers to Phillips Landing where golf carts are available to rent for exploring the island. There are currently no hotels, although several homes are available to rent for visitors. Virgin Islands Campground also provides accommodations.

The effect can not be explained by Classical mechanics, but requires the wave theory of quantum mechanics.  Definitions  When an electron moves through a gas, its interactions with the gas atoms cause scattering to occur. These interactions are classified as inelastic if they cause excitation or ionization of the atom to occur and elastic if they do not. The probability of scattering in such a system is defined as the number of electrons scattered, per unit electron current, per unit path length, per unit pressure at 0 ¬∞C, per unit solid angle. The number of collisions equals the total number of electrons scattered elastically and inelastically in all angles, and the probability of collision is the total number of collisions, per unit electron current, per unit path length, per unit pressure at 0 ¬∞C. Because noble gas atoms have a relatively high first ionization energy and the electrons do not carry enough energy to cause excited electronic states, ionization and excitation of the atom are unlikely, and the probability of elastic scattering over all angles is approximately equal to the probability of collision.  Description  The effect is named for Carl Ramsauer (1879-1955) and John Sealy Townsend (1868-1957), who each independently studied the collisions between atoms and low-energy electrons in the early 1920s. If one tries to predict the probability of collision with a classical model that treats the electron and atom as hard spheres, one finds that the probability of collision should be independent of the incident electron energy (see Kukolich). However, Ramsauer and Townsend observed that for slow-moving electrons in argon, krypton, or xenon, the probability of collision between the electrons and gas atoms obtains a minimum value for electrons with a certain amount of kinetic energy (about 1 electron volts for xenon gas). This is the Ramsauer‚ÄìTownsend effect. No good explanation for the phenomenon existed until the introduction of quantum mechanics, which explains that the effect results from the wave-like properties of the electron. A simple model of the collision that makes use of wave theory can predict the existence of the Ramsauer‚ÄìTownsend minimum. Bohm presents one such model that considers the atom as a finite square potential well. Predicting from theory the kinetic energy that will produce a Ramsauer‚ÄìTownsend minimum is quite complicated since the problem involves understanding the wave nature of particles. However, the problem has been extensively investigated both experimentally and theoretically and is well understood (see Johnson and Guet). In 1970 Gryzinski has proposed classical explanation of Ramsauer effect using effective picture of atom as oscillating multipole of electric field (dipole, quadrupole, octupole), which was a consequence of his free-fall atomic model.

Conann and Conaing) was a leader of the Fomorians who lived in a tower on Tory Island. He oppressed the followers of Nemed, demanding a huge tribute of their produce and children. Eventually Nemed's people rose up and killed him, destroying his tower. After his death, Morc, another Fomorian massacred Nemed's surviving followers.  Conand's Tower  According to the Lebor Gab√°la √ârenn Conand mac Febair (son of Febar) and Morc mac Deled (son of Dela) imposed a heavy tax on the clan of Nemed, demanding two-thirds of their wheat, milk, and offspring, which were due every Samain at the plain called Mag Cetne. The oppressed attacked from the sea with a host of 30,000 headed by three champions, grandsons and great-grandsons of Nemed, and overcame Conand and his host of 30,000 at Conand's Tower (later called Torinis Cetne).

The tale was embellished by M√≠che√°l √ì Cl√©irigh in the Annals of the Four Masters recension of the Lebor Gab√°la, whereby the Nemedian folk obtain assistance from Greece in the form of venomous beasts, and a woman spy named Relbeo. She infiltrates the tower and gains Conand's trust, obtaining crucial intelligence on how to tactically assault the tower. R. A. S. Macalister states √ì Cl√©irigh invented this seemingly out of thin air, and it would be a futile exercise to second guess what source he may have plagiarized. Localization It had almost become conventional wisdom to identify the location of this Conand's tower at Tory Island, ever since the publication of O'Flaherty's Ogygia, but this has been disputed by Henry Morris (√ânr√≠ √ì Muirgheasa). Morris argued that the plain where the taxes were collected (Mag Cetne) was properly to be located in Co. Sligo, south of the Duff River, and not in Co. Donegal between the Drowes River (Drobhais) and Erne River) as Geoffrey Keating indicated. Morris consequently proposed a small island off the coast, called Derinish, corrupted from Tor-Inis. Macalister commends the effort, while noting that such a treatise can hardly hope to carry conclusive proof.: \\"comes as near to carrying conviction as such a paper well can do\\".

It was built in its present form in the 13th century on the site of a 2nd-century Roman temple, with some materials from the Dacian Sarmizegetusa fortress. It has a stone tower above the naos. Inside the church there are 15th century mural paintings that show Jesus wearing Romanian traditional clothes. These paintings were made by artist »òtefan. In the 18th century more paintings were added by Simion de Pite»ôti. From 1566 to the end of the 19th century the building functioned as a Calvinist church, too. Because of this, the paintings were lime-whited in the 16th century and its belltower has a Hungarian inscription from 1782. According to Romanian historians, on the setting of the present-day church there was once a Dacian temple dedicated to Zamolxis, upon which the conquering Romans built a temple dedicated to the god Mars. Its present form dates from the beginning of the 12th century. Considering its antecedents, though, Densu»ô Church dates from the 4th century AD, and is considered the oldest church in Romania and Southeast Europe.  Hypothesis about Densu»ô  One of the hypotheses about Densu»ô is that it was once a pagan temple; to sustain this argument, it is noted that the altar of the church is closer to the South than to the East, which would suggest that it was once a pagan temple, since all early Christian houses of worship have the altar pointing towards the East. Other clues are the form of the roof, which, seen from a lateral perspective, has the form of a bird, to be exact a dove, and above the altar there are two stone lions, united by their tails. Another hypothesis, based on inscriptions found inside the church, holds that it was originally built as a mausoleum to the Roman general Longinus Maximus. But it is also possible that the stones with the inscriptions were moved from their original place and were built into the temple later. The most widespread opinion among Romanian historians is that the present Densu»ô church was once a Christianized Roman temple, which is to say a Paleo-Christian church from the 4th to 6th centuries AD, and it is also the first church on Dacian territory.

She has the ability to tap, store, and manipulate cosmic energy for a variety of effects, including the projection of concussive force bolts and flight. The cosmic energy enhances her physical attributes to superhuman levels, and enhances her metabolism and her life force, preventing her from aging, and making her virtually immortal. She can recover from serious injuries by creating a cosmic energy cocoon from surrounding molecules in which she can rest and regenerate. She can reanimate dead tissue by projecting a portion of her cosmic life force into it. Kismet cannot restore a being's spirit (astral self) to a body that she resurrects if that spirit has left the body. She also has the ability to use cosmic energy to rearrange molecular structures (of about three cubic feet at a time).

Rubin is a past president of the American Institute for Psychoanalysis and the Karen Horney Institute for Psychoanalysis. He lived in New York City and was married to Eleanor Katz. Life and career He is a long-time contributing columnist to the Ladies' Home Journal (1972-?), and the author of more than 25 works of fiction and nonfiction. In 1962, director Frank Perry made the acclaimed film David and Lisa from Rubin's novella Lisa and David. The film was remade by entertainer Oprah Winfrey in 1998. His book Shrink: The Diary of a Psychiatrist, was written in the times of his residences in different psychiatric hospitals in the West Coast of the United States until his decision to move to New York. For a clinician who rose to prominence within psychoanalysis during the heyday of what is known as \\"ego psychology\\" (a movement often criticized for its equation of mental health and conformity to normative American cultural values, exemplified by the pathologizing of homosexuality), Rubin is iconoclastic with regard to psychoanalytic and cultural orthodoxy. Compassion and Self-Hate: An Alternative to Despair (1975), while espousing traditional psychoanalytic notions of repression and defense, emphasizes the centrality of covert self- hate in the phenomenology of neurotic suffering, recommending consciously invoked compassion, a self-help approach which more closely resembles Tibetan Buddhism than psychoanalysis. This dichotomy can be seen in at least one of two ways: as an opening of the psychoanalytic model to existential and spiritual phenomenology (see Epstein's \\"Thoughts Without a Thinker\\" for a recent exposition of the idea that psychoanalysis and Buddhist thought can be productively synchronized), or as an unacknowledged radical interrogation of core psychoanalytic assumptions (see DuQuesne's \\"Killing Freud\\" for a thorough discussion of this trend in analytic writing).

During the ritual, congregants contribute flowers to a central location, and later the flowers are distributed among the participants. History The Flower Celebration was initiated in Prague on 4 June 1923 by Norbert ƒåapek, who was also the founder of the Unitarian Church in Czechoslovakia. He saw the need to unite the diverse congregants of his church, from varying Protestant, Catholic, and Jewish backgrounds, without alienating those who had left these traditions. For this reason he honored the universal beauty of nature by having a communion of flowers instead of the Eucharist. Though Unitarian Universalists often refer to the ritual as a Flower Ceremony, Festival, or Communion, ƒåapek's term \\"Oslava Kvƒõtin\\" is more accurately translated as \\"Flower Celebration,\\" a term which continues to be preferred by Czech Unitarians today.\\"Fragile and Rooted\\", by Joan Van Becelaere, CLF Quest, June 2002 The ritual was brought to the United States in 1940 by the Rev. Maja ƒåapek, Norbert's wife, and was widely adopted by the American Unitarian churches, and their successor Unitarian Universalist congregations. Earlier Unitarian \\"Flower Services,\\" documented in Midwestern U.S. Unitarian congregations beginning circa 1880, were somewhat different in form from ƒåapek's service. A floral arrangement created for a Flower Communion at a Unitarian Universalist Church for Easter celebrations 2009 A sample Flower Communion In its essentials, the ritual involves the following: each congregant brings a flower to be used in the service; congregants leave their flowers in a central location either as they enter or during the service. Early in the service the bouquets of flowers are carried in, often by children. Towards the end of the service, the flowers are distributed or congregants come forward and choose a flower different from the one they brought. The actual order of service varies widely in different congregations, and often closely resembles the ordinary order of service. Other service elements might include a sermon, the blessing of or a prayer over the flowers, a reading by Norbert ƒåapek, the history of the ritual, hymns, etc. Many congregations include this blessing used by ƒåapek to consecrate the flowers before they are passed to or distributed among the people: > \\"Infinite Spirit of Life, we ask thy blessing on these, thy messengers of > fellowship and love. May they remind us, amid diversities of knowledge and > of gifts, to be one in desire and affection, and devotion to thy holy will. > May they also remind us of the value of comradeship, of doing and sharing > alike. May we cherish friendship as one of thy most precious gifts. May we > not let awareness of another's talents discourage us, or sully our > relationship, but may we realize that, whatever we can do, great or small, > the efforts of all of us are needed to do thy work in this world.\\" Symbolism As with the flaming chalice there is no one orthodox interpretation of this flower ritual. The beauty and diversity of flowers is seen as symbolic of the beauty and diversity of life. Czech Unitarian Iva Fi≈°erov√° has written: \\"The flower is the most beloved symbol for Czech Unitarians...

They are a Class A - Advanced team in the Northern Division of the California League, and have been a farm team of the San Francisco Giants since 1988 and have played continuously since 1962 under several different names/affiliations. Home games are played at Excite Ballpark. Games A San Jose Giants game in 1994 San Jose Giants games are very much rooted in the older traditions of baseball. Fans sit very close to the field, general admission seating is available for games, players sign autographs before every game, and the outfield walls are lined with advertisements much like the stadiums of the 1920s and 1930s were. A simple scoreboard shows basic game data like runs, strikes, balls, and outs. This was updated in 2005 to feature lights to denote the count (three lights for strikes and four for balls) rather than numbers. The out-of-town scoreboard displaying other California League game scores was manually operated using hand-hung number cards. In 2006, the simple scoreboard was replaced with a 21-by-15-foot video screen costing $500,000, and the out-of-town scoreboard was no longer used. Between innings, fans are treated to a variety of games and entertainment, such as kids' air guitar, a child footrace around the bases, or throwing a baseball at a truck's headlights for prizes. The San Jose Giants also added a mascot, Gigante, for the 2006 season. Before Gigante's introduction, San Francisco Giants mascot Lou Seal made occasional appearances. San Jose Giants games were often the home of Krazy George. George was a well known \\"fan\\" in the San Francisco Bay Area who attended not only SJ Giants games, but also many of the MLB, NFL, NHL, and NCAA football games in the region. His claim to fame is being the creator of \\"the wave\\" in Oakland on October 15, 1981, where fans rise and wave their arms in sequence around a stadium thus created a wave-like effect when viewed from a distance. Team history San Jose has hosted multiple minor league baseball teams throughout its history. The current lineage can be traced back to the San Jose Bees who joined the California League in 1962 as an affiliate of the expansion Los Angeles Angels. They switched to a Kansas City Royals affiliate from 1970‚Äì1974 and a Cleveland Indians affiliate in 1975‚Äì1976. Many players on the Kansas City Royals teams of the 1970s and 1980s, including George Brett, Amos Otis, and Dennis Leonard played in San Jose. The Sacramento Solons then leased the San Jose affiliate for two seasons, when they were known as the San Jose Missions and played in the Pacific Coast League as an affiliate of the Oakland Athletics and Seattle Mariners. In 1982 the club became affiliated with the Montreal Expos and was known as the San Jose Expos. The Expos ended their affiliation after one year and the renamed Bees became an independent club. As an independent club, the Bees were free to sign players from Nippon Professional Baseball; the Seibu Lions sent several players to the Bees on loan in this period including Norio Tanabe and Kimiyasu Kudo. The 1986 Bees employed five decorated former Major Leaguers who struggled with drugs and alcohol and were effectively blacklisted by Major League Baseball: Steve Howe, Mike Norris, Ken Reitz, Todd Cruz and Daryl Sconiers. The mix of disgraced former stars and Japanese imports attracted attention from such publications as The Times, Rolling Stone, The New York Times, The Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times. San Jose Giants, 1988-present The team was sold to a group led by Winston H. Cox in 1987.https://www.sfgate.com/sports/article/San-Jose-Giants-Owner-Dies- at-55-2965799.php The current affiliation with the San Francisco Giants began in 1988. Since the team's inception, the San Jose Giants have been one of the more successful teams in the California League. They captured the league championship in 1998, 2001, 2005, 2007, 2009 and most recently in 2010. In 2005 and once again in 2007 after being down 0‚Äì2 in the best of 5 series, came back home and won the final three games over Lake Elsinore Storm to claim the Championship Series 3‚Äì2. (In 2001 the Giants were declared co-champions with the Lake Elsinore Storm after the final series was canceled after the September 11 terrorist attacks). The team has also made the California League playoffs numerous times and won the Northern Division championship 8 times. The Giants also had the best record of any minor league class A team in the 1990s. The Giants success has shown at the turnstile as attendance has increased 14 of the last 17 years. The SJ Giants are now in their 22nd season being affiliated with the San Francisco Giants. This makes the SJ Giants affiliation the longest currently enjoyed by a team in the California League. 2008 marked a second highest team record attendance of 183,788 for the season. The San Jose Giants have developed more than 190 major league players, including Buster Posey, Tim Lincecum, Jonathan S√°nchez, Matt Cain, Brian Horwitz, Noah Lowry, Merkin Valdez, Chad Zerbe, Russ Ortiz, Bill Mueller, Doug Mirabelli, Rod Beck, Joe Nathan, Francisco Liriano, Shawn Estes, Emmanuel Burriss, Andr√©s Torres, Pablo Sandoval, Madison Bumgarner and Adam Duvall.

The most common translation of Historikerstreit in English-language academic discourse is \\"historians' dispute\\", although the German term is often used. was a dispute in the late 1980s in West Germany between conservative and left-of-center academics and other intellectuals about how to incorporate Nazi Germany and the Holocaust into German historiography and, more generally, into the German people's view of themselves.Kattago, Siobhan. Ambiguous Memory: The Nazi Past and German National Identity, Westport: Praeger, 2001, pp. 56‚Äì58. The position taken by conservative intellectuals, led by Ernst Nolte, was that the Holocaust was not unique and therefore Germans should not bear any special burden of guilt for the \\"Final Solution to the Jewish Question\\".Kattago 2001, pp. 61‚Äì62. Nolte argued that there was no moral difference between the crimes of the Soviet Union and those of Nazi Germany, and that the Nazis acted as they did out of fear of what the Soviet Union might do to Germany.Kattago 2001, p. 62. Likewise, the conservative historian Andreas Hillgruber asserted that there was no moral difference between Allied policies towards Germany in 1944‚Äì1945 and the genocide waged against the Jews. Others argued that the memory of the Nazi era could not be \\"normalized\\" and be a source of national pride.Stern, Fritz. Five Germanys I Have Known, New York: Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 2006, pp. 430‚Äì432. The debate attracted much media attention in West Germany, with its participants frequently giving television interviews and writing op-ed pieces in newspapers. It flared up again briefly in 2000 when one of its leading figures, Ernst Nolte, was awarded the Konrad Adenauer Prize for science.. Background Immediately after World War II, intense debates arose in intellectual circles about how to interpret Nazi Germany, a contested discussion that continues today. Two of the more hotly debated questions were whether Nazism was in some way part of the \\"German national character\\" and how much responsibility, if any, the German people bore for the crimes of Nazism. Various non-German historians in the immediate post-war era, such as A. J. P. Taylor and Sir Lewis Namier, argued that Nazism was the culmination of German history and that the vast majority of Germans were responsible for Nazi crimes. Different assessments of Nazism were common among Marxists, who insisted on the economic aspects of Nazism and conceived of it as the culmination of a capitalist crisis, and liberals, who emphasized Hitler's personal role and responsibility and bypassed the larger problem of the relation of ordinary German people to the regime.Ian Kershaw, Hitler: A Profile in Power, in particular the introduction (London, 1991, rev. 2001). Within West Germany, then, most historians were strongly defensive. In the assessment of Gerhard Ritter and others, Nazism was a totalitarian movement that represented only the work of a small criminal clique; Germans were victims of Nazism, and the Nazi era represented a total break in German history. Starting in the 1960s, that assessment was challenged by younger German historians. Fritz Fischer argued in favor of a Sonderweg conception of German history that saw Nazism as the result of the way German society had developed. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the functionalist school of historiography emerged; its proponents argued that medium- and lower-ranking German officials were not just obeying orders and policies but actively engaged in the making of the policies that led to the Holocaust. The functionalists thereby cast blame for the Holocaust across a wider circle. Many right-wing German historians disliked the implications of the Sonderweg conception and the functionalist school; they were generally identified with the left and structuralism and were seen by the right-wingers as being derogatory toward Germany. By the mid-1980s, right-wing German historians began to think that enough time had passed since 1945 and thus it was time for the German nation to start celebrating much of its history again. A sign of the changed mood was the ceremony at Bitburg in May 1985, where US President Ronald Reagan and West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl honored the German war dead buried at Bitburg, including the SS men buried there, which was widely seen as a sign that the memory of the Nazi past had been \\"normalized\\" (i.e., that the Nazi period was \\"normal\\" and therefore Germans should not feel guilty).Kattago, Siobhan Ambiguous Memory The Nazi Past and German National Identity, Westport: Praeger, 2001 page 50 President Reagan justified laying a wreath to honor all the Germans buried at Bitburg who died fighting for Hitler, including the SS men, and his initial refusal to visit the Bergen- Belsen concentration camp under the grounds that the SS men buried at Bitburg were just as much victims of Hitler as the Jews murdered by the SS and that \\"They [the Germans] just have a guilt feeling that's been imposed on them and I just think it's unnecessary\\".Kattago, Siobhan Ambiguous Memory The Nazi Past and German National Identity, Westport: Praeger, 2001 page 49. The ceremony at Bitburg and Reagan's remarks about the need to do away with a German \\"guilt feeling\\" about the Nazi past were widely interpreted by German conservatives as the beginning of the \\"normalization\\" of the memory of the Third Reich.Kattago, Siobhan Ambiguous Memory The Nazi Past and German National Identity, Westport: Praeger, 2001 pages 49-50. Michael St√ºrmer's 1986 article \\"Land without History\\" questioned Germany's lack of positive history in which to take pride.St√ºrmer, Michael \\"History In a Land Without History\\", pages 16-17, in Forever In The Shadow of Hitler? edited Ernst Piper, Atlantic Highlands: Humanities Press, 1993 St√ºrmer's position as Chancellor Kohl's advisor and speechwriter heightened the controversy.Wicke, Christian Helmut Kohl's Quest for Normality: His Presentation of the German Nation and Himself Berghahn: New York, 2015 pages 185-186 At the same time, many left-wing German historians disliked what they saw as the nationalistic tone of the Kohl government. A project that raised the ire of many on the left, and which became a central issue of the Historikerstreit,Habermas, J√ºrgen \\"A Kind of Settlement of Damages On Apologetic Tendencies In German History Writing\\" pages 34‚Äì44 from Forever In the Shadow of Hitler? edited by Ernst Piper, Humanities Press, Atlantic Highlands, 1993 page 41; Maier, Charles The Unmasterable Past Harvard University Press: Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1988 pages 121-159; Mommsen, Hans \\"Search for the 'Lost History'?\\" pages 101‚Äì113 from Forever In The Shadow of Hitler? edited by Ernst Piper, Humanities Press, Atlantic Highlands, 1993 page 110; Mommsen, Wolfgang J. \\"Neither Denial nor Forgetfulness Will Free Us\\" pages 202-215 from Forever In The Shadow of Hitler? edited by Ernst Piper, Humanities Press, Atlantic Highlands, 1993 pages 204-205. consisted of two proposed museums celebrating modern German history, to be built in West Berlin and Bonn. Many of the left-wing participants in the Historikerstreit claimed that the museum was meant to \\"exonerate\\" the German past and asserted that there was a connection between the proposed museum, the government, and the views of such historians as Michael St√ºrmer, Ernst Nolte, and Andreas Hillgruber. In October 1986, Hans Mommsen wrote that St√ºrmer's assertion that he who controls the past also controls the future, his work as a co-editor of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper‚Äîwhich had been publishing articles by Ernst Nolte and Joachim Fest denying the \\"singularity\\" of the Holocaust‚Äîand his work as an advisor to Chancellor Kohl should cause \\"concern\\" among historians.Mommsen, Hans \\"The New Historical Consciousness\\" pages 114‚Äì124 from Forever In The Shadow of Hitler? edited by Ernst Piper, Humanities Press, Atlantic Highlands, 1993 p. 115. Overview=Participants On one side were the philosopher and historian Ernst Nolte, the journalist Joachim Fest, and the historians Andreas Hillgruber, Klaus Hildebrand, Rainer Zitelmann, Hagen Schulze, and Michael St√ºrmer. Opposing them were the philosopher J√ºrgen Habermas and the historians Hans-Ulrich Wehler, J√ºrgen Kocka, Hans Mommsen, Martin Broszat, Heinrich August Winkler, Eberhard J√§ckel, and Wolfgang Mommsen. Karl Dietrich Bracher and Richard L√∂wenthal argued for some compromise; they said that comparing different totalitarian systems was a valid intellectual exercise, but they insisted that the Holocaust should not be compared to other genocides. Issues The views of Ernst Nolte and J√ºrgen Habermas were at the center of the debate, conducted almost exclusively through articles and letters to the editor in the newspapers Die Zeit and the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. People in West Germany followed the debate with interest. The debate was noted for its vitriolic and aggressive tone, with the participants often engaging in ad hominem attacks.Evans, Richard J. In Hitler's Shadow, New York: Pantheon Books, 1989, pp. 116‚Äì117 In Hillgruber's 1986 book, Zweierlei Untergang (\\"Two Kinds of Downfall: The Smashing of the German Reich and the End of European Jewry\\"), he lamented the mass expulsions of ethnic Germans from Czechoslovakia and Poland at the end of World War II and compared the suffering of the Heimatvertriebene (\\"those expelled from their native land\\") to that of victims of the Holocaust. Hillgruber had not supported Nolte, but the controversy over Zweierlei Untergang became linked with Nolte's views when Habermas and Wehler characterized both men as conservatives trying to minimize Nazi crimes. The debate centered on four questions: * Were the crimes of Nazi Germany uniquely evil or were other crimes, such as those of Joseph Stalin in the Soviet Union, comparably so? Were other genocides comparable to the Holocaust? Many scholars believed that such comparisons trivialized the Holocaust. Others maintained that the Holocaust could best be understood in the context of other crimes. * Did German history follow a \\"special path\\" (Sonderweg) leading inevitably to Nazism? * Were the crimes of the Nazis a reaction to Soviet crimes under Stalin? * Should the German people bear a special burden of guilt for Nazi crimes, or can new generations of Germans find sources of pride in their history? Immediate background=\\"Between Myth and Revisionism\\" In 1980, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper published a feuilleton ‚ÄúBetween Myth and Revisionism: The Third Reich In the Perspective of the 1980s‚Äù, where Nolte sketched out many of the same ideas that later appeared in his 1986 essay ‚ÄúThe Past That Will Not Go Away‚Äù . The essay \\"Between Myth and Revisionism\\" was also published in English in the 1985 book Aspects of the Third Reich by the Anglo-German historian H. W. Koch, where it was billed incorrectly as an essay written for Aspects of the Third Reich. It was the 1985 version of \\"Between Myth and Revisionism\\" that Habermas noticed and referred to in his essay \\"On Damage Control\\". According to Nolte in ‚ÄúBetween Myth and Revisionism‚Äù, during the Industrial Revolution in Britain, the shock of the replacement of the old craft economy by an industrialized, mechanized economy led to various radicals starting to advocate what Nolte calls ‚Äúannihilation therapy‚Äù as the solution to social problems.Nolte in Koch (1985) p. 31 In Nolte's views, the roots of Communism can be traced back to 18th and 19th century radicals like Thomas Spence, John Gray, William Benbow, Bronterre O‚ÄôBrian, and Fran√ßois-No√´l Babeuf.Nolte in Koch (1985) pp. 30‚Äì31 Nolte has argued that the French Revolution began the practice of ‚Äúgroup annihilation‚Äù as state policy, but not until the Russian Revolution did the theory of ‚Äúannihilation therapy‚Äù reach its logical conclusion and culmination.Nolte in Koch (1985) p. 32 He asserts that much of the European Left saw social problems as being caused by ‚Äúdiseased‚Äù social groups, and sought ‚Äúannihilation therapy‚Äù as the solution, thus leading naturally to the Red Terror and the Yezhovshchina in the Soviet Union.Nolte in Koch (1985) pp. 33‚Äì34 Nolte suggests that the Right mirrored the Left, with ‚Äúannihilation therapy‚Äù advocated by such figures as John Robison, Augustin Barruel, and Joseph de Maistre; Malthusianism and the Prussian strategy of utter destruction of one's enemies during the Napoleonic Wars also suggest sources and influences for National Socialism.Nolte in Koch (1985) p. 33 Ultimately, in Nolte's view, the Holocaust was just a ‚Äúcopy‚Äù of Communist ‚Äúannihilation therapy‚Äù, albeit one that was more terrible and sickening than the ‚Äúoriginal‚Äù.Nolte in Koch (1985) p. 36 Bitburg controversy In 1984, the West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl invited the U.S. President Ronald Reagan to mark the 40th anniversary of the end of World War II in Europe by attending a memorial service at a military cemetery in Bitburg.Stern, Fritz Five Germanys I Have Known, New York: Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 2006, p. 430. Reagan accepted the offer, unaware that members of the Waffen-SS were buried in the Bitburg cemetery, and when this was reported in early 1985, many Americans urged Reagan to cancel the planned visit to Bitburg under the grounds it was offensive for president of the United States to lay a memorial wreath honoring those SS men who died fighting for Hitler. Kohl insisted that if Reagan snubbed the Bitburg ceremony that it would be the end of his chancellorship, saying the majority of Germans would find it offensive. Reagan stated those Waffen-SS men who died fighting for Hitler were just as much victims of Hitler as the Jews exterminated in the death camps.Evans, Richard In Hitler's Shadow, New York: Pantheon, 1989 p. 16. Reagan argued to place a memorial wreath honoring the sacrifices of the SS men buried in the Bitburg cemetery was no different from placing a memorial at the Auschwitz death camp for the SS and the Jews killed by the SS were all equally victims of Hitler. This clumsy attempt at public relations damage control only increased the controversy, with both veterans' groups and Jewish groups in the United States being adamantly opposed to Reagan attending the Bitburg ceremony.Evans, Richard In Hitler's Shadow, New York: Pantheon, 1989 p. 17 Reagan also refused to visit a concentration camp to balance out the visit to the Bitburg cemetery by saying the Germans \\"have a guilt feeling that's been imposed on them, and I just think it's unnecessary\\".Evans 1989, p. 17 The Franco-Romanian Holocaust survivor and writer Elie Wiesel issued a public letter to Reagan saying: \\"That place, Mr. President, is not your place. Your place is with the victims of the SS\\".Evans 1989, p. 17 After Wiesel's letter, which helped to crystallize opposition in the United States to the Bitburg service, Reagan and Kohl very reluctantly agreed to visit the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp to honor the memory of who died there, though both Reagan and Kohl went out their way to insist the visit to Bergen-Belsen should not be the cause for Germans to have any \\"guilt feelings\\" about the Nazi past.Evans 1989, p. 17 The Bitburg ceremony was widely interpreted in Germany as the beginning of the \\"normalization\\" of the Nazi past, namely the viewpoint that the Germans had a \\"normal\\" history that would not cause shame or guilt, and instead inspire pride in being German.Kattago, Siobhan Ambiguous Memory The Nazi Past and German National Identity, Westport: Praeger, 2001, p. 50. The Christian Democratic politician and Second World War veteran Alfred Dregger in a public letter published on 20 April 1985 and written to a group of 53 U.S senators opposed to the Bitburg service, stated for Reagan to not attend the Bitburg service would be an insult both to himself and to his brother who had been killed fighting the Red Army in 1945.Evans 1989, p. 55 Dregger stated that he was proud to have served in the Wehrmacht and to have fought the Red Army in Silesia in 1945, insisting he and his brother had fought in World War II in an effort to save Europe from Communism. Finally, Dregger linked Nazi Germany's war against the Soviet Union to the Cold War, arguing that all of the men buried in Bitburg, whatever they were in the Wehrmacht or the Waffen- SS, had died fighting nobly and honorably against the Soviet Union, which was just as much the enemy in 1985 as it had been in 1945. Bringing up a point later made by Andreas Hillgruber, Dregger emphasized Red Army atrocities against German civilians in 1945, insisting he and everybody else served on the German side in the Eastern Front had waged an \\"honorable\\" fight to protect German civilians from the Red Army. Dregger called Hitler and his regime a small criminal clique that had nothing to do with the honorable and noble war waged by the Wehrmacht to \\"defend\\" Germany from the Red Army, arguing that the battles and campaigns to protect German civilians from the Red Army was an episode in Germany worthy of the utmost admiration, and should be honored with Reagan attending the Bitburg memorial service. Amid much controversy, on 8 May 1985, Kohl and Reagan visited the Bitburg cemetery and placed memorial wreathes to honor all of the Wehrmacht and Waffen-SS men buried there. The American historian Fritz Stern wrote that Kohl and Reagan were engaging in \\"symbolic politics\\" with the Bitburg ceremony, to suggest the memory of the Nazi past should to a certain extent be exorcised with the idea to honor those who died fighting in the Waffen-SS as victims of Hitler, but instead the immense controversy caused by the Bitburg ceremony caused shown that the Nazi past could not be \\"normalized\\" as they had wished. On the same day as the Bitburg ceremony, the West German president Richard von Weizs√§cker delivered a speech in Bonn which was an \\"implicit rebuke\\" to the Bitburg ceremony where he stated the Jews exterminated in the Holocaust were much more victims of Hitler than those Germans who died fighting for Hitler.Stern, Fritz Five Germanys I Have Known, New York: Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 2006, p. 431-432. In the same speech, Weizs√§cker also stated the memory of the Nazi past could not be \\"normalized\\" and the memory of the Nazi era would always be a source of shame for Germans. The contrasting reactions to the Bitburg controversy and to Weizs√§cker's speech brought to the fore the question of whatever Germans should still feel shame at the Nazi past forty years later or not. On one side, there were those who insist that West Germany was a \\"normal\\" country that should have a \\"normal\\" history that would inspire national pride in being German, and on the other there were those who insisted the memory of the Nazi era could not be \\"normalized\\" and be a source of national pride.Stern, Fritz Five Germanys I Have Known, New York: Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 2006 p. 430-432. The debate was not entirely along left-right lines as Weizs√§cker was a Second World War veteran and a conservative.Evans 1989, p. 18 The intense controversy caused by the Bitburg memorial service with its suggestion that the Nazi era was a \\"normal\\" period lead those who in favor of \\"normalization\\" to redouble their efforts.Kattago, Siobhan Ambiguous Memory The Nazi Past and German National Identity, Westport: Praeger, 2001 p. 49-50. The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper published an opinion piece in early 1986 saying that the Jews needed to be \\"tactful\\" in dealing with Germans and should not be bringing up the Holocaust as that would insult German sensitivities.Evans 1989, p. 18 The minister-president of Bavaria, Franz Josef Strauss, complained that the Germans had been spent too long \\"on their knees\\" and need to learn how to \\"walk tall again\\", arguing that 40 years of guilt had been quite enough.Evans 1989, p. 19 As part of his \\"walk tall\\" speech, Strauss argued that West Germany needed to \\"become a normal nation again\\", saying \\"German history cannot be presented as an endless chain of mistakes and crimes\\", and that Germans should be proud to be German.Evans 1989, p. 19 Strass's reference to the Germans \\"kneeling\\" in his \\"walk tall\\" speech was to the Kniefall von Warschau when in 1970 the West German chancellor Willy Brandt had knelt before a memorial to the Warsaw Ghetto, saying as a German he felt ashamed of what had happened. Strauss's \\"walk tall\\" speech with its implicit criticism of Brandt kneeling in guilt before the site of the Warsaw Ghetto was very polarizing. \\"History In A Land Without History\\" In a feuilleton published in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung on 25 April 1986, the German historian Michael St√ºrmer complained that most Germans lacked pride in their history, which he felt threatened the future. St√ºrmer wrote \\"...that in a land without history, the future is controlled by those who determine the content of memory, who coin concepts and interpret the past\\". St√ºrmer warned that with most Germans lacking pride in their history that this a destabilizing factor that nobody could predicate where it would end.St√ºrmer, Michael \\"History in a Land Without History\\" from Forever in the Shadow of Hitler? edited by Ernst Piper, 1993, p. 16. St√ºrmer felt that the left had too much power in regards to the memory of the past, complaining that the Social Democrats were still concerned 40 years after 1945 with \\"battling the social foundations of fascism in the Federal Republic\\".St√ºrmer 1993, p. 17. St√ºrmer wanted for historians to find the \\"lost history\\" that would inspire national pride in being German. St√ºrmer wrote Germany's allies were becoming concerned with the German lack of pride in their history, stating \\"the Federal Republic has political and economic responsibility in the world. It is the centerpiece of European defense within the Atlantic system...It is also becoming evident that the technocratic underestimation of history by the political Right and the progressive strangulation of history by the Left is seriously damaging the political culture of the country. The search for a lost past is not an abstract striving for culture and education. It is morally legitimate and politically necessary\\". Zweierlei Untergang In May 1986, a book by Andreas Hillgruber, Zweierlei Untergang Die Zerschlagung des Deutschen Reiches und das Ende des europ√§ischen Judentums (Two Kinds of Ruin The Smashing of the German Reich and the End of European Jewry), was published in Berlin. The book consisted of two essays by Hillgruber, in which he argued the end of Germany as a great power in 1945 and the Holocaust were morally equivalent tragedies.McKale, Donald, Hitler's Shadow War, New York: CooperSquare Press, 2002, p. 445 Much of the controversy generated by Zweierlei Untergang was due to the essay Der Zusammenbruch im Osten 1944/45 (The Collapse in the East 1944/45) in which Hillgruber presented an account of the Eastern Front in 1944-45 and mourned the end of \\"the German east\\". Hillgruber had been born and grew up in the town of Angerburg (modern Wƒôgorzewo, Poland) in what was then East Prussia and often wrote nostalgically about his lost Heimat. Hillgruber expressed much anger in Zweierlei Untergang about the Oder-Neisse line, the expulsions of the Germans from Eastern Europe and the partitioning of Germany, all of which he used to argue that the policies of the Allies towards the Germans during and after World War II were just as horrific as the Holocaust. Evans, Richard In Hitler's Shadow (1989), pp. 50-51. In particular, Hillgruber accused Winston Churchill and the rest of the British government of being obsessed with anti-German and anti-Prussian prejudices going back to at least 1907, and maintained it was always Britain's goal to \\"smash\\" the German Reich. Hillgruber accused the British of holding \\"a negative image of Prussia, exaggerated to the point of becoming a myth\\", which led them to seek the utter destruction of the Prussian-German state in World War II and blinded them to the fact that only a strong Central European state led by Prussia could have prevented the \\"flooding\\" of Central Europe by the Red Army.Hirschfeld, Gerhard, \\"Erasing the Past?\\", pp. 8-10 in History Today, vol. 37, August 1987, p. 8. Hillgruber in Der Zusammenbruch im Osten 1944/45 was also concerned with the \\"justified\\" last stand of the Wehrmacht on the Eastern Front in 1944-45 as Hillgruber gave a lengthy account of Red Army war crimes against German civilians. Hillgruber wrote the Wehrmacht in 1944-1945 was fighting \\"for a centuries-old area of German settlement, for the home of millions of Germans who lived in a core of the German Reich - namely in eastern Prussia, in the provinces of East Prussia, West Prussia, Silesia, East Brandenburg and Pomerania\\".Evans, Richard In Hitler's Shadow (1989), pp. 50‚Äì51. Hillgruber wrote: \\"If the historian gazes on the winter catastrophe of 1944-45, only one position is possible...he must identify himself with the concrete fate of the German population in the East and with the desperate and sacrificial exertions of the German Army of the East and the German Baltic navy, which sought to defend the population from the orgy of revenge of the Red Army, the mass rapine, the arbitrary killing, and the compulsory deportations.\\"Maier, Charles The Unmasterable Past, Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1988 page 21. Besides for his call for historians to \\"identify\\" with the Wehrmacht, Hillgruber condemned the putsch of 20 July 1944 as irresponsible and wrong and praised those Wehrmacht officers who stayed loyal to Hitler as making the correct moral choice.Lukacs The Hitler of History, 1997, p. 236. Hillgruber argued that the need to protect German civilians from the Red Army should have been the overriding concern of all Wehrmacht officers, which required remaining loyal to Hitler.Lukacs The Hitler of History, 1997, p. 236. Historikerstreit begins, June 1986=\\"The Past That Will Not Pass\\" Nolte launched the Historikerstreit (\\"Historians' Dispute\\") on 6 June 1986 Nolte with an article in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung: Vergangenheit, die nicht vergehen will: Eine Rede, die geschrieben, aber nicht mehr gehalten werden konnte (\\"The Past That Will Not Pass: A Speech That Could Be Written but Not Delivered\\") . His feuilleton was a distillation of ideas he had first introduced in lectures delivered in 1976 and in 1980. Earlier in 1986, Nolte had planned to deliver a speech before the Frankfurt R√∂merberg Conversations (an annual gathering of intellectuals), but he had claimed that the organizers of the event withdrew their invitation.Maier (1988) p. 29 In response, an editor and co-publisher of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Joachim Fest, allowed Nolte to have his speech printed as a feuilleton in his newspaper.Maier (1988) p. 30 One of Nolte's leading critics, British historian Richard J. Evans, claims that the organizers of the R√∂merberg Conversations did not withdrew their invitation, and that Nolte had just refused to attend.Evans, pp. 148‚Äì149 Nolte began his feuilleton by remarking that it was necessary in his opinion to draw a \\"line under the German past\\".Nolte in Piper (1993) p. 19 Nolte argued that the memory of the Nazi era was \\"a bugaboo, as a past that in the process of establishing itself in the present or that is suspended above the present like an executioner's sword\\".Nolte in Piper (1993) p. 18 Nolte used as an example of the problem of the \\"Past That Will Not Go Away\\" that in Nazi Germany, the \\"mania of masculinity\\" was \\"full of provocative self-confidence\\", but now German men were afraid to be manly because German feminists had made National Socialism the \\"present enemy\\".Nolte in Piper (1993) p. 18 In the same way, Nolte charged that Germans were being forced to live under the fear of being labelled anti-semitic; Nolte wrote based on his viewing of the film Shoah it was clear that the SS guards of the death camps were \\"victims of a sort and that among the Polish victims of National Socialism there was virulent anti-Semitism\\".Nolte in Piper (1993) p. 20 Nolte complained that excessive present-day interest in the Nazi period had the effect of drawing \\"attention away from the pressing questions of the present-for example, the question of \\"unborn life\\" or the presence of genocide yesterday in Vietnam and today in Afghanistan\\". Nolte argued that the furor in 1985 over the visit of the American president Ronald Reagan to the Bitburg cemetery reflected in his view the unhealthy effects of an obsession with the memory of the Nazi era.Nolte in Piper (1993) p. 20 Nolte suggested that, during West German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer's visit to the United States in 1953, if he had failed to visit Arlington National Cemetery a storm of controversy would have ensued. Nolte argued that since some of the men buried at Arlington had in his view \\"participated in terror attacks on the German civilian population\\", there was no moral difference between Reagan visiting the Bitburg cemetery, with its graves of Waffen SS dead, and Adenauer visiting Arlington with its graves of American airmen. Nolte complained that because of the \\"past that would not pass\\", it was controversial for Reagan to visit Bitburg, but it was not controversial for Adenauer to visit Arlington. Nolte cited the Bitburg controversy as an example of the power exerted by historical memory of the Nazi past. Nolte concluded that there was excessive contemporary interest in the Holocaust because it served the concerns of those descended from the victims of Nazism, and placed them in a \\"permanent status of privilege\\". Nolte argued that Germans had an unhealthy obsession with guilt for Nazi crimes, and called for an end to this \\"obsession\\".Maier (1986) p. 39 Nolte's opinion was that there was no moral difference between German self- guilt over the Holocaust, and Nazi claims of Jewish collective guilt for all the world's problems. He called for an end to the maintaining of the memory of the Nazi past as fresh and current, and suggested a new way of viewing the Nazi past that would allow Germans to be free of the \\"past that will not pass\\". In his feuilleton, Nolte offered a new way of understanding German history which sought to break free of the \\"past that will not pass\\", by contending that Nazi crimes were only the consequence of a defensive reaction against Soviet crimes.Evans, p. 28 In Nolte's view, National Socialism had only arisen in response to the \\"class genocide\\" and \\"Asiatic barbarism\\" of the Bolsheviks.Nolte in Koch (1985) 35‚Äì36Nolte in Piper (1993) p. 22 Nolte cited as example the early Nazi Max Erwin von Scheubner-Richter, who during World War I had been the German consul in Erzerum, Turkey, where he was appalled by the genocide of the Armenians.Nolte in Piper (1993) pp. 21‚Äì22 In Nolte's view, the fact that Scheubner-Richter later became a Nazi shows that something must have changed his values, and in Nolte's opinion it was the Russian Revolution and such alleged Bolshevik practices as the \\"rat cage\\" torture (said by Russian √©migr√© authors to be a favorite torture by Chinese serving in the Cheka during the Russian Civil War) that led to the change.Nolte in Piper (1993) p. 21Evans, pp. 37‚Äì38; Evans disputes Nolte's evidence for the \\"rat cage\\" torture being a common Bolshevik practice Nolte used the example of the \\"rat cage\\" torture in George Orwell's 1948 novel 1984 to argue that the knowledge of the \\"rat cage\\" torture was widespread throughout the world. Nolte wrote about the horrors perpetuated by the \\"Chinese Cheka\\" as showing the \\"Asiatic\\" nature of the Bolsheviks. Furthermore, Nolte argues that the \\"rat cage\\" torture was an ancient torture long practiced in China, which in his opinion further establishes the \\"Asiatic barbarism\\" of the Bolsheviks.Evans, pp. 31‚Äì32 Nolte cited a statement by Hitler after the Battle of Stalingrad that Field Marshal Friedrich Paulus would be soon sent to the ‚Äúrat cage‚Äù in the Lubyanka as proof that Hitler had an especially vivid fear of the ‚Äúrat cage‚Äù torture. Along the same lines, Nolte argued that the Holocaust, or \\"racial genocide\\" as Nolte prefers to call it, was an understandable if excessive response on the part of Adolf Hitler to the Soviet threat and the \\"class genocide\\" with which the German middle class was said to be threatened. In Nolte's view, Soviet mass murders were Vorbild (the terrifying example that inspired the Nazis) and Schreckbild (the terrible model for the horrors perpetrated by the Nazis).Baldwin in Baldwin (1990) p. 5 Nolte labeled the Holocaust an \\"√ºberschie√üende Reaktion\\" (overshooting reaction) to Bolshevik crimes, and to alleged Jewish actions in support of Germany's enemies. In Nolte's opinion, the essence of National Socialism was anti-Communism, and anti-Semitism was only a subordinate element to anti-Bolshevism in Nazi ideology. Nolte argued that because \\"the mighty shadow of events in Russia fell most powerfully\\" on Germany, that the most extreme reaction to the Russian Revolution took place there, thus establishing the \\"causal nexus\\" between Communism and fascism. Nolte asserted that the core of National Socialism was > \\"neither in criminal tendencies nor in anti-Semitic obsessions as such. The > essence of National Socialism [was to be found] in its relation to Marxism > and especially to Communism in the form which this had taken on through the > Bolshevik victory in the Russian Revolution\\". In Nolte's view, Nazi anti-communism was \\"understandable and up to a certain point, justified\\". For Nolte, the \\"racial genocide\\" as he calls the Holocaust was a \\"punishment and preventive measure\\" on the part of the Germans for the \\"class genocide\\" of the Bolsheviks.Kershaw, p. 175 American historian Peter Baldwin noted parallels between Nolte's views and those of American Marxist historian Arno J. Mayer:.Baldwin in Baldwin (1990) p. 25 Both Nolte and Mayer perceive the interwar period as one of intense ideological conflict between the forces of the Right and Left, positing World War II as the culmination of this conflict, with the Holocaust a byproduct of the German-Soviet war.Baldwin in Baldwin (1990) pp. 25‚Äì26 Baldwin distinguished Nolte from Mayer in that Nolte considered the Soviets aggressors who essentially got what they deserved in the form of Operation Barbarossa, whereas Mayer considered the Soviets to be victims of German aggression.Baldwin in Baldwin (1990) p. 26 Operation Barbarossa, in Nolte's thinking, was a \\"preventive war\\" forced on Hitler by an alleged impending Soviet attack. Nolte wrote that Hitler's view of the Russian people as barbarians was an \\"exaggeration of an insight which was basically right in its essence\\" and that Hitler \\"understood the invasion of the Soviet Union as a preventive war\\" as the Soviet desire to bring Communism to the entire world \\"must be seen as mental acts of war, and one may even ask whether a completely isolated and heavily armed country did not constitute a dangerous threat to its neighbors on these grounds alone\\".Evans, p. 42 The crux of Nolte's thesis was presented when he wrote: > \\"It is a notable shortcoming of the literature about National Socialism that > it does not know or does not want to admit to what degree all the deeds‚Äîwith > the sole exception of the technical process of gassing‚Äîthat the National > Socialists later committed had already been described in a voluminous > literature of the early 1920s: mass deportations and shootings, torture, > death camps, extermination of entire groups using strictly objective > selection criteria, and public demands for the annihilation of millions of > guiltless people who were thought to be \\"enemies\\". > > It is probable that many of these reports were exaggerated. It is certain > that the ‚ÄúWhite Terror‚Äù also committed terrible deeds, even though its > program contained no analogy to the ‚Äúextermination of the bourgeoisie‚Äù. > Nonetheless, the following question must seem permissible, even unavoidable: > Did the National Socialists or Hitler perhaps commit an ‚ÄúAsiatic‚Äù deed > merely because they and their ilk considered themselves to be the potential > victims of an ‚ÄúAsiatic‚Äù deed? Wasn‚Äôt the 'Gulag Archipelago' more original > than Auschwitz? Was the Bolshevik murder of an entire class not the logical > and factual prius of the \\"racial murder\\" of National Socialism? Cannot > Hitler's most secret deeds be explained by the fact that he had not > forgotten the rat cage? Did Auschwitz in its root causes not originate in a > past that would not pass?\\" Nolte wrote the principal problem \\"for the coming generations...must be liberation from collectivist thinking\\", which Nolte claimed dominated scholarship on Nazi Germany.Nolte in Piper, p. 22-23. Nolte ended his essay with calling for a \\"more comprehensive debate\\" about the memory of Nazi Germany that would allow for \\"the past that will not go away\\" to finally go away \\"as is suitable for every past\\".Nolte in Piper, p. 23. Nolte called the Auschwitz death camp and the other German death camps of World War II a \\"copy\\" of the Soviet Gulag camps. Nolte subsequently presented a 1940 book by American author Theodore N. Kaufman entitled Germany Must Perish!. The text contends that all German men should be sterilized, evidencing, according to Nolte, the alleged \\"Jewish\\" desire to \\"annihilate\\" Germans prior to the Holocaust.Nolte in Koch (1985) pp. 27‚Äì28 An August 1941 appeal to the world by a group of Soviet Jews seeking support against Germany was also cited by Nolte as evidence of Jewish determination to thwart the Reich.Kershaw, p. 176 Nolte argued that the Nazis felt forced to undertake the Holocaust by Hitler's conclusion that the entire Jewish population of the world had declared war on Germany. From Nolte's point of view, the Holocaust was an act of ‚ÄúAsiatic barbarism‚Äù forced on the Germans by the fear of what Joseph Stalin, whom Nolte believed to have significant Jewish support, might do to them. Nolte contends that the U.S. internment of Japanese Americans in the wake of the Pearl Harbor attack provides a parallel to the German \\"internment\\" of the Jewish population of Europe in concentration camps, in light of what Nolte alleges was the \\"Jewish\\" declaration of war on Germany in 1939 which Weizmann's letter allegedly constitutes.Nolte in Koch (1985) p. 28 Subsequently, Nolte expanded upon these views in his 1987 book Der europ√§ische B√ºrgerkrieg, 1917‚Äì1945 (The European Civil War, 1917‚Äì1945) in which he claimed that the entire 20th century was an age of genocide, totalitarianism, and tyranny, and that the Holocaust had been merely one chapter in the age of violence, terror and population displacement. Nolte claimed that this age had started with the genocide of the Armenians during World War I, and also included the Stalinist terror in the Soviet Union, the expulsion of ethnic Germans from Eastern Europe, Maoist terror in China as manifested in such events as the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution, compulsory population exchanges between Greece and Turkey from 1922 to 1923, American war crimes in the Vietnam War, the Khmer Rouge genocide in Cambodia, and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.Lipstadt, p. 211 In particular, Nolte argued that the expulsion of ethnic Germans from Eastern Europe in 1945‚Äì46 was \\"to be categorized...under the concept of genocide\\".Evans, p. 94 As part of this argument, Nolte cited the 1979 book of the American historian Alfred-Maurice de Zayas, Die Wehrmacht Untersuchungsstelle, which argues that the Allies were just as guilty of war crimes as the Germans as the \\"happy evidence of the will to objectivity on the part of a foreigner\\"Evans, p. 162 In Nolte's opinion, Hitler was a \\"European citizen\\" who fought in defence of the values of the West against \\"Asiatic\\" Bolshevism, but due to his \\"total egocentrism\\" waged this struggle with unnecessary violence and brutalityEvans, p. 56 Since in Nolte's view, the Shoah was not a unique crime, there is no reason to single out Germans for special criticism for the Holocaust.Evans, p. 27 In addition, Nolte sees his work as the beginning of a much-needed revisionist treatment to end the \\"negative myth\\" of the Third Reich that dominates contemporary perceptions.Nolte in Piper (1993) pp. 4‚Äì5 Nolte took the view that the principle problem of German history was this ‚Äúnegative myth‚Äù of the Third Reich, which cast the Nazi era as the ne plus ultra of evil.Nolte in Piper (1993) pp. 3‚Äì4 Nolte wrote that after the American Civil War, the defeated South was cast as the symbol of total evil by the victorious North, but later ‚Äúrevisionism‚Äù became the dominant historical interpretation against the ‚Äúnegative myth‚Äù of the South, which led to a more balanced history of the Civil War with a greater understanding of the ‚Äúmotives and way of life of the defeated Southern states‚Äù, and led to the leaders of the Confederacy becoming great American heroes.Nolte in Piper (1993) p. 4 Nolte urged that a similar ‚Äúrevisionism‚Äù destroy the ‚Äúnegative myth‚Äù of the Third Reich.Nolte in Piper (1993) pp. 4, 14‚Äì15 Nolte argued that the Vietnam War, the Khmer Rouge genocide, the expulsion of \\"boat people\\" from Vietnam, the Islamic revolution in Iran, and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan meant the traditional picture of Nazi Germany as the ultimate in evil was no longer tenable, and proved the need for \\"revisionism\\" to put an end to the \\"negative myth\\" of the Third Reich.Nolte in Piper (1993) p. 5 In Nolte's view, the first efforts at revisionism of the Nazi period failed because A. J. P. Taylor's 1961 book The Origins of the Second World War was only a part of the \\"anti-German literature of indictment\\" while David Hoggan in Der erzwugnene Krieg, by only seeking to examine why World War II broke out in 1939, \\"cut himself off from the really decisive questions\\". Then the next revisionist efforts Nolte cites were the Italian historian Domenico Settembrini's favorable treatment of Fascism for saving Italy from Communism, and the British historian Timothy Mason's studies in working class German history.Nolte in Piper (1993) pp. 6‚Äì7 The best of the revisionists according to Nolte is David Irving, with whom Nolte finds some fault, although \\"not all of Irving's theses and points can be dismissed with such ease\\".Nolte in Piper (1993) p. 8 Nolte praises Irving as the first to understand that Weizmann's letter to Chamberlain was a \\"Jewish declaration of war\\" on Germany that justified the \\"interning\\" of the Jews of Europe.Nolte in Piper (1993) pp. 8‚Äì9 Nolte went on to praise Irving for putting the Holocaust \\"in a more comprehensive perspective\\" by comparing it to the British fire- bombing of Hamburg in 1943, which Nolte views as just much of an act of genocide as the \\"Final Solution\\". The sort of revisionism needed to end the \\"negative myth\\" of the Third Reich is, in Nolte's opinion, an examination of the impact of the Russian Revolution on Germany.Nolte in Piper (1993) pp. 9‚Äì10 Nolte contends that the great decisive event of the 20th century was the Russian Revolution of 1917, which plunged all of Europe into a long-simmering civil war that lasted until 1945. To Nolte, fascism, Communism's twin, arose as a desperate response by the threatened middle classes of Europe to what Nolte has often called the ‚ÄúBolshevik peril‚Äù. He suggests that if one wishes to understand the Holocaust, one should begin with the industrial revolution in Britain, and then understand the rule of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia.Nolte in Piper (1993) p. 9 Nolte then proceeds to argue that one should consider what happened in the Soviet Union in the interwar period by reading the work of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn. In a marked change from the views expressed in The Three Faces of Fascism, in which Communism was a stream of ‚Äútranscendence‚Äù, Nolte now classified communism together with fascism as both rival streams of the ‚Äúresistance to transcendence‚Äù.Maier (1988) pp. 86‚Äì87 The ‚Äúmetapolitical phenomenon‚Äù of Communism in a Hegelian dialectic led to the ‚Äúmetapolitical phenomenon‚Äù of fascism, which was both a copy of and the most ardent opponent of Marxism.Baldwin in Baldwin (1990) pp. 9‚Äì10 As an example of his thesis, Nolte cited an article written in 1927 by Kurt Tucholsky calling for middle- class Germans to be gassed, which he argued was much more deplorable than the celebratory comments made by some right-wing newspapers about the assassination of the German Foreign Minister Walter Rathenau in 1922.Nolte in Piper (1993) p. 152 Richard J. Evans, Ian Kershaw and Otto Dov Kulka all claimed that Nolte took Tucholsky's sardonic remark about chemical warfare out of context.Evans, p. 37Kulka in Baldwin (1990) p. 152 Kershaw further protested the implication of moral equivalence between a remark by Tucholsky and the actual gassing of Jews by Nazis, which Kershaw suggests is an idea which originates in neo-Nazi pamphleteering. In his 1987 book Der europ√§ische B√ºrgerkrieg, 1917‚Äì1945, Nolte argued in the interwar period, Germany was Europe's best hope for progress.Evans, p. 99 Nolte wrote that \\"if Europe was to succeed in establishing itself as a world power on an equal footing [with the United States and the Soviet Union], then Germany had to be the core of the new 'United States'\\". Nolte claimed if Germany had to continue to abide by Part V of the Treaty of Versailles, which had disarmed Germany, then Germany would have been destroyed by aggression from her neighbors sometime later in the 1930s, and with Germany's destruction, there would have been no hope for a \\"United States of Europe\\". The British historian Richard J. Evans accused Nolte of engaging in a geopolitical fantasy.Evans, pp. 99‚Äì100 \\"A Kind of Damage Control\\" The philosopher J√ºrgen Habermas in an article entitled \\"A Kind of Damage Control: On Apologetic Tendencies In German History Writing\\" in the Die Zeit of 11 July 1986 strongly criticized Nolte, along with Andreas Hillgruber and Michael St√ºrmer, for engaging in what Habermas called ‚Äúapologetic‚Äù history writing in regards to the Nazi era, and for seeking to ‚Äúclose Germany‚Äôs opening to the West‚Äù that in Habermas's view has existed since 1945.Habermas in Piper (1993) p. 43 Habermas criticized St√ºrmer for his essay \\"History in a land without history\\" as engaging in \\"damage control\\" with German history and wrote that Hillgruber and Nolte were putting his theories into practice.Habermas in Piper (1993) p. 34‚Äì35 Habermas criticized Hillgruber for demanding historians \\"identify\\" with the Wehrmacht's last stand on the Eastern Front as being purely \\"selective\\".Habermas in Piper (1993) p. 35 Habermas charged that as long as the Wehrmacht held out, the Holocaust continued, but that Hillgruber's approach which emphasized the war on the Eastern Front from the viewpoint of the ordinary German soldier and the \\"desperate civilian population\\" serves to sever the \\"Final Solution of the Jewish Question\\" from history.Habermas in Piper (1993) p. 35‚Äì36 Habermas charged that Hillgruber had much sympathy with the German soldiers who found a \\"picture of horror of raped and murdered women and children\\" at Nemmersdorf, but his way of \\"identifying\\" with the Wehrmacht meant the Holocaust went unmentioned.Habermas in Piper (1993) p. 35‚Äì36 Habermas wrote in the second part of his essay, Hillgruber who previously insisted on a \\"bird's eye\\" view of the Eastern Front from the viewpoint of the ordinary German soldier now used the perspective of a historian to argue the Allies were always planning on destroying Germany and it was wrong for the Allies to impose the Oder- Neisse line as the new eastern frontier of Germany, which Habermas felt to be a double standard.Habermas in Piper (1993) p. 35‚Äì36Habermas wrote Hillgruber had failed as a historian, stating: \\"Hillgruber is most deeply appalled by the high proportion of university-trained men who participated [in the Holocaust]-as if there were not a completely plausible explanation for that. In short, the phenomenon that a civilized populace let these horrible things happen is one that Hillguber removes from the technical competence of the overburdened historian and blithely pushes off into the dimension of the generally human\\".Habermas in Piper (1993) p. 38 Habermas called Nolte the \\"officious-conservative narrator\\" who presented a version of history in which the \\"annihilation of the Jews appears as a regrettable, but perfectly understandable result\\".Habermas in Piper (1993) p. 39 Habermas criticized Nolte for claiming that Chaim Weizmann declared war on Germany in 1939 which \\"was supposed to justify Hitler in treating German Jews as prisoners of war- and then in deporting them\\"..Habermas in Piper (1993) p. 39 Habermas wrote: > ‚ÄúThe culture section of Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, June 6, 1986 > included a militant article by Ernst Nolte.

In Habermas's opinion, since Cambodia was a backward, Third World agrarian state and Germany a modern, First World industrial state, there was no comparison between the two genocides.Low, Alfred \\"Historikerstreit\\" p. 474 from Modern Germany, Volume 1 A-K, edited by Dieter Buse and J√ºrgen Doerr, Garland Publishing, New York, United States of America, 1998 Habermas then linked what he called the revisionism of Nolte, Hillgruber and St√ºrmer with the planned German Historical Museum in Berlin and the House of History in Bonn, which he criticized for a nationalistic view of German history.Habermas in Piper (1993) p. 41 Habermas accused St√ºrmer of subordinating history to politics and of attempting to strangle the emergence of individualistic society with his demand for \\"historical consciousness as vicarious religion\\".Habermas in Piper (1993) p. 42 Habermas wrote: \\"The unconditional opening of the Federal Republic to the political culture of the West is the greatest intellectual achievement of our postwar period; my generation should be especially proud of this. This event cannot and should not be stabilized by a kind of NATO philosophy colored with German nationalism. The opening of the Federal Republic has been achieved precisely by overcoming the ideology of Central Europe that our revisionists are trying to warm up for us with their geopolitical drumbeat about \`\\"the old geographically central position of the Germans in Europe\\" (St√ºrmer) and \\"the reconstruction of the destroyed European Center\\" (Hillgruber). The only patriotism that will not estrange us from the West is a constitutional patriotism.\\"Habermas in Piper (1993) p. 43 \\"The New Myth of State\\" The sub-title of Hillgruber's book drew controversy with the Swiss historian Micha Brumlik in an essay entitled \\"New Myth of State\\" first published in Die Tagezeitung newspaper on 12 July 1986, commenting that the use of the word Zerschlagung (destruction) for the Germans indicated that an act of extreme violence was committed against the Germans while the Jews were assigned only the neutral term Ende (end) to describe the Holocaust.Brumlik, Micha, \\"New Myth of State\\" pp. 45-49 from Forever In The Shadow of Hitler? edited by Ernst Piper, Humanities Press, Atlantic Highlands, NJ, 1993 p. 48. Brumlik argued that in his view, Hillgruber by his use of the word \\"End\\" to label the Holocaust implied that the Shoah was just something terrible that happened to the Jews of Europe, but it was not anybody's fault. Brumlik accused Hillgruber of reducing German history down to the level of Landserheft (a type of comics in Germany glorifying war).Brumlik, Micha, \\"New Myth of State\\" pp. 45‚Äì49 from Forever In The Shadow of Hitler? edited by Ernst Piper, Humanities Press, Atlantic Highlands, NJ, 1993 p. 45. Brumlik argued that Hillgruber's thesis about the Holocaust as one of many genocides, instead of a unique event, was a form of \\"psychological repression\\" to avoid dealing with guilt over the Holocaust.Brumlik, Micha, \\"New Myth of State\\" pp. 45-49 from Forever In The Shadow of Hitler? edited by Ernst Piper, Humanities Press, Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey, 1993 p. 46. Brumlik wrote: \\"Even if we do not look into Stanlist totalitarianism and its murderous work camps, the expansionism of the Soviet Union since 1945, the irresponsible foreign policy adventures of the Soviet Union and its thoroughly repressive regime, it now is becoming clear what role anticommunism played and plays in the political culture of psychological repression...Only if this equation is made; only if is further insinuated that the Soviet Union wanted to exterminate the Germans; other then does it seem legitimate that the nation conducting the war protected the annihilation camps\\".Brumlik, Micha, \\"New Myth of State\\" pp. 45-49 from Forever In The Shadow of Hitler? edited by Ernst Piper, Humanities Press, Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey, 1993 p. 48. Brumlik wrote that Hillgruber was clearly trying to suggest that the Soviet Union was waging genocide against the Germans, which made the war effort of Nazi Germany in the East to be as Hillgruber would have it a \\"justified\\" defense of German civilians even as at the same time the defensive efforts of the Wehrmacht allowed the Holocaust to continue.Brumlik, Micha, \\"New Myth of State\\" pp. 45‚Äì49 from Forever In The Shadow of Hitler? edited by Ernst Piper, Humanities Press, Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey, 1993 p. 48. Brumlik wrote though Zweierlei Untergang only covered the period from June 1944 to May 1945, it did served to implicitly to turn what was a war of conquest on the part of Germany into a defensive struggle to protect Germans while pushing the Jews being exterminated by the Reich into the background.Brumlik, Micha, \\"New Myth of State\\" pp. 45-49 from Forever In The Shadow of Hitler? edited by Ernst Piper, Humanities Press, Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey, 1993 p. 48. Brumlik wrote that Hillgruber in Zweierlei Untergang had played up the role of Germans as victims in World War II at the expense of Germans as perpetrators. Brumlik, Micha, \\"New Myth of State\\" pp. 45-49 from Forever In The Shadow of Hitler? edited by Ernst Piper, Humanities Press, Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey, 1993 p. 47-49. The American historian Gordon A. Craig expressed the view that Hillgruber's choice of the word Ende for the Holocaust suggested that the Holocaust was \\"something that just sort of happened\\".Aschheim, Steven \\"History, Politics and National Memory\\" pages 222-238 from Survey of Jewish Affairs: 1988 edited by William Frankel, Fairleigh Dickinson University Press 1989 p. 232. \\"The Age of Tyrants\\" In response to Habermas's essay, Klaus Hildebrand came to the defence of Nolte. Hildebrand in an essay entitled \\"The Age of Tyrants\\" first published in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung on July 31, 1986 went on to praise Nolte for daring to open up new questions for research.Hildebrand in Piper (1993) pp. 54‚Äì55 Hildebrand wrote that Habermas had done a \\"bad service to politics and denies scholarship outright\\".Hildebrand in Piper (1993) pp. 50 Hildebrand accused Habermas of fabricating the sentence in which Hillgruber had praised the \\"tried and true higher-ups of the NSDAP\\", noting that Hillgruber wrote a long sentence in which Habermas had selectively quoted from without ellipsis.Hildebrand in Piper (1993) pp. 51 Hildebrand wrote that Hillgruber had understood history as a tragedy and \\"... this fact escaped Habermas, perhaps due to a lack of expertise, perhaps also due to an unfamiliarity with historical research\\".Hildebrand in Piper (1993) pp. 52 Hildebrand wrote that Hillgruber was not trying to glorify the Wehmarcht as Habermas was charging; instead maintaining Hillgruber approach in writing history from the viewpoint of the average German soldier on the Eastern Front in 1944-45 was \\"legitimate and necessary\\".Hildebrand in Piper (1993) pp. 53 Hildebrand praised Hillgruber for his new approach to the Eastern Front and accused Habermas of having a \\"simplistic image of history... without regard to new sources, new realizations, and new questions\\".Hildebrand in Piper (1993) pp. 53 Hildebrand ended his essay with the remarking that Habermas should have just remained silent as he nothing intelligent to say as he was suffering from a \\"loss of reality and Manichaenism\\".Hildebrand in Piper (1993) pp. 55 Nolte's letter to Die Zeit, 1 August 1986 Nolte for his part, started to write a series of letters to various newspapers such as Die Zeit and Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung attacking his critics; for an example, in a letter to Die Zeit on 1 August 1986, Nolte complained that his critic J√ºrgen Habermas was attempting to censor him for expressing his views, and accused Habermas of being the one responsible for blocking him from attending the R√∂merberg Conversations.Nolte in Piper (1993) pp. 56‚Äì57 In the same letter, Nolte described himself as the unnamed historian whose views on the reasons for the Holocaust had at dinner party in May 1986 in Bonn had caused Saul Friedl√§nder to walk out in disgust that Habermas had alluded to an earlier letterNolte in Piper (1993) p. 56 Habermas's letter to the FAZ, 11 August 1986 Responding to the essay \\"The Age of Tyrants: History and Politics\\" by Klaus Hildebrand defending Nolte and Hillgruber, Habermas wrote that Hillgruber's approach \\"perhaps would be a legitimate point of view for the memoirs of a veteran-but not for a historian writing from the distance of four decades\\".Hildebrand in Piper (1993) pp. 59 Habermas wrote: > ‚ÄúIn his essay Ernst Nolte treats the ‚Äúso-called‚Äù annihilation of the Jews > (in H.W.

It's a shame about this man [Habermas] who once had something to say\\".Habermas in Piper (1993) p. 61‚Äì62 \\"Encumbered Remembrance\\" Fest in an essay entitled \\"Encumbered Remembrance\\" first published in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung on August 29, 1986 claimed that Nolte's argument that Nazi crimes were not singular was correct.Fest in Piper (1993) pp. 64‚Äì65 Fest accused Habermas of \\"academic dyslexia\\" and \\"character assassination\\" in his attacks against Nolte.Fest in Piper (1993) p. 64 In response to Habermas's claim that the Holocaust was not comparable to the Khmer Rouge genocide because Germany was a First World nation and Cambodia a Third World nation, Fest, who was one of Nolte's leading defenders, called Habermas a racist for suggesting that it was natural for Cambodians to engage in genocide while unnatural for Germans.Fest in Piper (1993) p. 66 Fest argued against the \\"singularity\\" of the Holocaust under the grounds that: > \\"The gas chambers with which the executors of the annihilation of the Jews > went to work without a doubt signal a particularly repulsive form of mass > murder, and they have justifiably become a symbol for the technicized > barbarism of the Hitler regime.

Nolte's admirer Joachim Fest was to defend Nolte by arguing that Habermas was a racist for arguing that it was natural for Cambodians to practice genocide and unnatural for Germans. Bracher's letter to the FAZ, 6 September 1986 In a letter to the editor of Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung published on September 6, 1986, Karl Dietrich Bracher that nothing new was being presented by either side.Bracher, Karl Dietrich \\"Letter to the Editor of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, September 6, 1986\\" pages 72-73 from Forever In The Shadow Of Hitler? edited by Ernst Piper, Atlantic Highlands, N.J. : Humanities Press, 1993 page 72 Bracher wrote that he approved of Joachim Fest's essay ‚ÄúEncumbered Remembrance‚Äú about the moral equivalence of Nazi and Communist crimes, though he remained pointly silent about Fest's support for the theory of Ernst Nolte of a ‚Äúcasual nexus‚Äù with German National Socialism as an extreme, but understandable response to Soviet Communism. Bracher argued that \\"...the \\"totalitarian\\" force of these two ideologies [Communism and National Socialism] seized the whole human and seduced and enslaved him\\". Bracher accused both J√ºrgen Habermas and Ernst Nolte of both \\"...tabooing the concept of totalitarianism and inflating the formula of fascism\\". Bracher complained about the \\"politically polarized\\" dispute that was blinding historians to the \\"comparability\\" of Communism and National Socialism Bracher ended his letter by writing that neither National Socialism nor Communism lost none of \\"...their respective \\"singular\\" inhumanity by comparisons. Neither a national nor a socialist apologetic can be supported on that basis\\". \\"The Impoverished Practice of Insinuation\\" The historian Eberhard J√§ckel in an essay first published in the Die Zeit newspaper on September 12, 1986 argued that Nolte's theory was ahistorical on the grounds that Hitler held the Soviet Union in contempt, and could not have felt threatened as Nolte claimed.J√§ckel in Piper (1993) pp. 77‚Äì78 J√§ckel wrote, in an essay entitled \\"The Impoverished Practice of Insinuation: The Singular Aspect of National-Socialist Crimes Cannot Be Denied\\", > \\"Hitler often said why he wished to remove and kill the Jews. His > explanation is a complicated and structurally logical construct that can be > reproduced in great detail. A rat cage, the murders committed by the > Bolsheviks, or a special fear of these are not mentioned.

The gigantic empire in the East is ripe for collapse\\". Hitler > still believed this in 1941 when he had his soldiers invade Russia without > winter equipment.\\"J√§ckel in Piper (1993) p. 78 J√§ckel attacked Nolte's statement that Hitler had an especially intense fear of the Soviet \\"rat cage\\" torture by arguing that Hitler's statement of February 1, 1943 to his generals about captured German officers going off to the \\"rat cage\\" clearly meant the Lubyanka prison, and this is not as Nolte was arguing to be interpreted literally.J√§ckel in Piper (1993) p. 77 J√§ckel went on to argue that Nolte had done nothing to establish what the remarks about the \\"rat cage\\" had to do with the Holocaust. J√§ckel accused Nolte of engaging in a post hoc, ergo propter hoc argument to establish the \\"causal nexus\\" between Hitler's supposed fear of the \\"rat cage\\" torture, and the Holocaust. Against Nolte's claim that the Holocaust was not unique but rather one among many genocides, J√§ckel rejected the assertion of Nolte and his supporters, such as Joachim Fest: > \\"I, however claim (and not for the first time) that the National Socialist > murder of the Jews was unique because never before had a nation with the > authority of its leader decided and announced that it would kill off as > completely as possible a particular group of humans, including old people, > women, children and infants, and actually put this decision into practice, > using all the means of governmental power at its disposal. This idea is so > apparent and so well known that is quite astonishing that it could have > escaped Fest's attention (the massacres of the Armenians in the Ottoman > Empire during the First World War were, according to all we know, more like > murderous deportations than planned genocide)\\".J√§ckel in Piper (1993) p. 76 J√§ckel later described Nolte's methods as a \\"game of confusion\\", comprising dressing hypotheses up as questions, and then attacking critics who demanded evidence for his assertions as seeking to block one from asking questions.Hirschfeld, Gerhard \\"Erasing the Past?\\" pp. 8‚Äì10 from History Today Volume 37, Issue 8, August 1987 p. 9 \\"The Morality of History‚Äù The philosopher Helmut Fleischer in an essay first published in the N√ºrnberger Zeitung newspaper on September 20, 1986 defended Nolte against Habermas under the grounds that Nolte was only seeking to place the Holocaust into a wider political context of the times.Fleischer in Piper (1993) p. 80 Fleischer wrote the dispute was really \\"about the moral judgement of the Nazi past\\".Fleischer in Piper (1993) p. 80 Flesicher wrote in defense of Hillgruber that he had the moral case for justifying the Wehrmacht's last stand on the Eastern Front as necessary to protect German civilians from the Red Army.Fleischer in Piper (1993) p. 80 Fleischer accused Habermas of seeking to impose a left-wing moral understanding on the Nazi period on Germans and of creating a ‚Äúmoral‚Äù Sondergericht (Special Court).Fleischer in Piper (1993) pp. 80, 83 Fleischer argued that Nolte was only seeking the \\"historicization\\" of National Socialism that Martin Broszat had called for in a 1985 essay by trying to understand what caused National Socialism, with a special focus on the fear of Communism.Fleischer in Piper (1993) pp. 81‚Äì83 Historkerstreit, autumn 1986=\\"Hitler Should Not Be Repressed By Stalin and Pol Pot\\" The German historian J√ºrgen Kocka in an essay first published in Die Zeit on September 26, 1986 contended against Nolte that the Holocaust was indeed a ‚Äúsingular‚Äù event because it had been committed by an advanced Western nation, and argued that Nolte's comparisons of the Holocaust with similar mass killings in Pol Pot's Cambodia, Joseph Stalin's Soviet Union, and Idi Amin's Uganda were invalid because of the backward nature of those societies.Kocka, pp. 86‚Äì87 Kocka dismissed Fest's claims that Habermas was a racist for rejecting comparisons with Cambodia, writing \\"it has to do with historical knowledge about the connection between economic development and the possibilities of sociopolitical organization, and also with taking seriously the European tradition, in consideration of which the Enlightenment, human rights and the constitutional state cannot be simply ignored\\".Kocka, p. 87 Kocka went to criticize Nolte's view of the Holocaust as \\"a not altogether incomprehensible reaction to the prior threat of annihilation, as whose potential or real victims Hitler and the National Socialists allegedly were justified in seeing themselves\\".Kocka, p. 87 Kocka wrote that: > \\"The real causes of anti-Semitism in Germany are to be found neither in > Russia nor the World Jewish Congress. And how can one, in light of the > facts, interpret the National Socialist annihilation of the Jews as a > somewhat logical, if premature, means of defense against the threats of > annihilation coming from the Soviet Union, with which Germany had made a > pact in 1939, and which it then subsequently attacked?

If a past \\"that is capable of being > agreed on\\" can be gained by intellectual gymnastics of this sort, then we > should renounce it.\\"Kocka, p. 88 Kocka argued contra St√ºrmer that \\"Geography is not destiny\\".Kocka, p 91. Kocka argued there other countries in \\"the middle\\" like Poland, Switzerland and Germany itself prior to 1871 did not evolve in the same way that Germany did after 1871, stating that St√ºrmer's argument that Bismark needed to impose an authoritarian government because of geography was simply wrong.Kocka, pp. 90-91 \\"Questions We Have To Face\\" Hagen Schulze in an essay first published in Die Zeit on September 26, 1986 defended Nolte, together with Andreas Hillgruber, and argued Habermas was acting from \\"incorrect presuppositions\\" in attacking Nolte and Hillgruber for denying the \\"singularity\\" of the Holocaust.Schulze in Piper (1993) p. 94 Schulze argued that Habermas's attack on Nolte was flawed because he never provided any proof that the Holocaust was unique, and argued there were many \\"aspects\\" of the Holocaust that were \\"common\\" with other historical occurrences. In Schulze's opinion: > \\"For the discipline of history, singularity and comparability of historical > events are thus not mutually exclusive alternatives. They are complementary > concepts. A claim that historians such as Ernst Nolte or Andreas Hillgruber > deny the uniqueness of Auschwitz because they are looking for comparisons > stems from incorrect presuppositions. Of course, Nolte and Hillgruber can be > refuted if their comparisons rest on empirically or logically false > assumptions. But Habermas never provided such proof.\\" Schulze defended St√ºrmer's call for the historians to explore the \\"German question\\", writing that it was \\"important\\" for historians to \\"make the national identity of the Germans an object of their research\\".Schulze in Piper, pp. 96 Schulze dismissed Habermas's call for \\"constitutional patriotism\\" under the grounds a form of national identity grounded in loyalty to the Basic Law of 1949 was too dry to work, and the German people needed a national identity that was more emotional to work.Schulze in Piper, pp. 97  ‚ÄúA Searching Image of the Past\\" The Swiss journalist Hanno Helbling in an essay first published in the Neu Zuricher Zeitung newspaper on September 26, 1986 accused Nolte and his allies of working to destroy ‚Äúthe ‚Äúnegative myth‚Äù of the Third Reich, not only by revising our inevitable understanding of this reign of terror, but also by restoring the national past‚Äù.Helbling in Piper (1993) p. 99 Nelbling complained: \\"Revisionists who gloss over the evils of National Socialism and deny its atrocities have raised a ruckus latterly. What they claim is without scholarly substance and cannot influence our understanding of history in the long term\\".Helbling in Piper (1993) p. 99 Helbling wrote about Nolte's comment about the problem of a \\"negative myth of the Third Reich\\" that Nolte wrote \\"as if myths were necessary to make our understanding of National Socialism negative... Or can take refuge in countermyths of the negative kind and thus come close to a leveling strategy, just as announcements of horrors from the distant past are not suited to proving that back then, too, murderous deeds were committed. And what about the recent past: \\"Didn't Stalin...\\"; in Cambodia, didn't they...\\" These are sad , which in a strange way have propagated themselves into the political view of the present\\".Helbling in Piper (1993) p. 98‚Äì99 \\"The Search for the 'Lost History'?\\" Hans Mommsen in an essay first published in the September 1986 edition of Merkur accused Nolte of attempting to \\"relativize\\" Nazi crimes within the broader framework of the 20th century.Mommsen in Piper (1993) p. 108 Mommsen asserted that by describing Lenin's Red Terror in Russia as an \\"Asiatic deed\\" threatening Germany, Nolte was arguing that all actions directed against Communism, no matter how morally repugnant, were justified by necessity. Mommsen wrote that the problem with German conservatives after 1945 was lack of a \\"reservoir of conservative values to which it could connect without interruption\\".Mommsen in Piper (1993) p. 102 Mommsen wrote the theory of totalitarianism served Cold War needs so \\"that could not only decorate itself with the epithet \\"anti-Fascist\\" but could also rule out and criminalize leftist efforts\\" and for the \\"bracketing out the period of the Third Reich from the continuity of German history\\".Mommsen in Piper (1993) p. 103 Mommsen argued this \\"bracketing out\\" was necessary because of the continuity of the German bureaucracy from the Weimar to Nazi to post-war periods, which required a \\"psychological repression of the criminal politics of the Third Reich\\".Mommsen in Piper (1993) p. 104 In this regard, Mommsen wrote: \\"It is significant that the Weimar Republic was viewed in the years immediately following 1945 as an experiment failed from the onset; not until the success of the chancellor democracy did this image brighten. Then the Weimar experience could be trotted out for the additional legitimization of the Federal Republic and the fundamental superiority the Federal Republic assured\\".Mommsen in Piper (1993) p. 104 Mommsen wrote that the Bitburg controversy of 1985 had \\"made surprisingly clear that the burdens of the Second World War now as before possess traumatic meaning. These burdens disturbed the dramaturgy of the Bitburg spectacle, which, under the fiction of final reconciliation among friends, was supposed to replace the idea of a crusade by the Allies against the Hitler dictatorship with the idea of a crusade against Communist world dictatorship\\".Mommsen in Piper (1993) p. 105 Mommsen wrote it was a reaction to the Bitburg controversy that led historians like Michael St√ºrmer to insist that the Germans needed a positive history to end what St√ºrmer called the \\"collective obsession with guilt\\".Mommsen in Piper (1993) p. 110‚Äì111 Mommsen praised what St√ºmer deplored, writing the \\"prevailing mistrust in the Federal Republic, independent of every party affiliation of any cult of community, organized by the state, of appeals for national willingness to make sacrifices and of sentiment against national pathos and national emblems has its roots in the political sobering up that arose from the experiences of the Third Reich. Whoever wants to see in this a lack of patriotic sentiment should be clear once and for all that there is no lack of willingness for democratic participation, although this frequently takes place outside of the corrupt apparatus of the large parties... It is therefore absurd to want to rehabilitate older authoritarian attitudes through historical relativizing. It is a mistake to characterize as a wrong path the consequences of action inferred from the flawed developments of the period between the wars\\".Mommsen in Piper (1993) p. 110‚Äì111 Mommsen accused the Kohl government of seeking to revive German nationalism \\"via a detour\\" of \\"strengthening national consciousness\\" through the planned German Historical Museum in West Berlin.Mommsen in Piper (1993) p. 111‚Äì112 Mommsen wrote the purposes of the German Historical Museum together with the House of History in Bonn was to \\"make us forget the Holocaust and Operation Barbarossa under the slogan of \\"normalizing\\". This intention has nothing to do with the understanding of history that has grown stepwise in postwar Germany, an understanding that has come about apart from the classical monumental history and frequently independently of the scholarly discipline\\".Mommsen in Piper (1993) p. 112 \\"The New Historical Consciousness\\" In another essay first published in the Bl√§tter f√ºr deutsche und internationale Politik magazine in October 1986, Mommsen was to call Nolte's claim of a \\"causal nexus\\" between National Socialism and Communism \\"not simply methodologically untenable, but also absurd in it premises and conclusions\\".Mommsen in Piper (1993) p. 120 Mommsen wrote in his opinion that Nolte's use of the Nazi era phrase \\"Asiatic hordes\\" to describe Red Army soldiers, and his use of the word \\"Asia\\" as a byword for all that is horrible and cruel in the world reflected racism.Mommsen in Piper (1993) p. 122 Mommsen wrote: > \\"In contrast to these irrefutable conditioning factors, Nolte‚Äôs derivation > based on personalities and the history of ideas seems artificial, even for > the explanation of Hitler‚Äôs anti-Semitism‚Ä¶If one emphasizes the indisputably > important connection in isolation, one should not then force a connection > with Hitler's weltanschauung, which was in no ways original itself, in order > to deprive from it the existence of Auschwitz.

A better description would be that national sentiments, long dammed up and visible only in marginal literature, are coming together in an unholy alliance and seeking new shores\\".Mommsen in Piper (1993) p. 116 Mommsen wrote the question of the \\"singularity\\" of the Holocaust was legitimate, but the motives of Hildebrand and St√ºrmer were political rather than scholarly, to end the \\"German obsession with guilt\\".Mommsen in Piper (1993) p. 117 Mommsen wrote\\" \\"To accept with resignation the acts of screaming injustice and to psychologically repress their social prerequisites by calling attention to similar events elsewhere and putting the blame on the Bolshevist world threat recalls the thought patterns that made it possible to implement genocide\\".Mommsen in Piper (1993) p. 119 Mommsen that when in the spring of 1943 the graves of the Polish officers massacred by the NKVD were discovered in Katyn Wood, the massacre was given massive publicity in Germany as a symbol of Soviet terror, going on to note those Germans opposed to the Nazi regime continue to view the Nazi regime as something worse despite all the publicity about the Katyn Wood massacre in Germany.Mommsen in Piper (1993) p. 119 Mommsen wrote the present campaign was a form of \\"psychological repression\\" intended to end any guilt over the Holocaust.Mommsen in Piper (1993) pp. 123‚Äì124 In another essay entitled \\"Reappraisal and Repression The Third Reich In West German Historical Consciousness\\", Mommsen wrote that: > \\"Nolte's superficial approach which associates things that do not belong > together, substitutes analogies for casual arguments, and ‚Äì thanks to his > taste for exaggeration ‚Äì produces a long outdated interpretation of the > Third Reich as the result of a single factor.

Broszat commented, \\"These facts may be overlooked by a right-wing publicist with a dubious educational background, but not by the university professor Ernst Nolte.\\" Broszat observed that when Hildebrand organized a conference of right-wing German historians under the auspices of the Schleyer Foundation in West Berlin in September 1986, he did not invite Nolte, whom Broszat observed lived in Berlin.Broszat, Martin \\"Where the Roads Part: History Is Not A Suitable Substitute for a Religion of Nationalism\\" pages 123-129 from Forever In The Shadow of Hitler? edited by Ernst Piper, Humanities Press, Atlantic Highlands, 1993 p. 127 Broszat suggested that this was Hildebrand's way of trying to separate himself from Nolte, whose work Hildebrand had praised so strongly in a review the Historische Zeitschrift in April 1986. Broszat wrote that St√ºrmer was trying to create an \\"ersatz religion\\" that was more appropriate for the pre-modern era than 1986, charging that St√ºrmer seemed torn between his commitment to democracy, NATO and Atlanticism vs. his call for history to serve as a unifying force for society. Broszat wrote that \\"Here the roads part\\", and argued that no self-respecting historian could associate himself with the effort to \\"drive the shame out of the Germans\\".Broszat in Piper (1993) p. 129 Broszat ended his essay with the remark that such \\"perversions\\" of German history must be resisted in order to ensure the German people a better future. \\"The New Auschwitz Lie\\" The journalist Rudolf Augstein, the publisher of the Der Spiegel news journal accused Nolte of creating the \\"New Auschwitz Lie\\" in an essay first published in the October 6, 1986 edition of Der Spiegel.Augstein in Piper (1993) pp. 133‚Äì134 Augstein questioned just why Nolte referred to the Holocaust as the \\"so-called annihilation of the Jews\\".Augstein in Piper (1993) p. 131 Augstein agreed with Nolte that the Israelis were ‚Äúblackmailing‚Äù the Germans over the Holocaust, but argued that given the magnitude of the Holocaust, the Germans had nothing to complain about. Augstein wrote in opposition to Nolte that: > \\"Not for nothing did Nolte let us know that the annihilation of the kulaks, > the peasant middle class, had taken place from 1927 to 1930, before Hitler > seized power, and that the destruction of the Old Bolsheviks and countless > other victims of Stalin's insanity had happened between 1934 and 1938, > before the beginning of Hitler's war.

Augstein went on to call for Hillgruber to be fired from his post at the University of Cologne for being a \\"constitutional Nazi\\", and argued that there was no moral difference between Hillgruber and Hans Globke. Thirty-Sixth Conference of German Historians, Trier, October 8, 1986 The classicist Christian Meier, who was president of the German Historical Association at the time gave a speech on October 8, 1986 before that body, in which he criticized Nolte by declaring that the Holocaust was a ‚Äúsingular‚Äù event that ‚Äúqualitatively surpassed\\" Soviet terror.Meier in Piper (1993) p. 136 Referring to Nolte's claims of being censored, Meier stated that Nolte had every right to ask questions, and that ‚Äúno taboos will be established‚Äù.Meier in Piper (1993) p. 139 Meier went to say: > ‚ÄúBut the way Nolte poses these questions must be rejected simply because one > should not reduce the impact of so elementary a truth: because German > historical scholarship cannot be allowed to fall back into producing > mindless nationalist apologies; and because it is important for a country to > not deceive itself in such sensitive‚Äîethically sensitive‚Äîareas of its > history.‚Äù Meir wrote that question of comparing Hitler to Stalin was \\"not at all illegitimate\\" and should be studied before saying. \\"Even if our crimes were not singular, how would that be advantageous for us and our position in the world?\\"Meier in Piper (1993) p. 139 Meir in an attempt to cool down an increasingly heated debate argued that both sides were unable to listen to one another and German historians needed a \\"good dose of humor\\".Meier in Piper (1993) p. 137 Meir argued that it was unacceptable for historians to refuse to shake hands because of their disagreements over the Historikerstreit, saying this lack of civility and outright hatred was poisoning the profession of history in Germany.Meier in Piper (1993) p. 137 Meir stated that historians had to explain events that they may disapprove of to the best of their abilities, saying that not all scholarship was political.Meier in Piper (1993) p. 137 Meir used as an example that intentionist historians did not benefit conservatism, arguing the willingness of \\"power elites\\" to obey Hitler's orders does not support a conservative position.Meier in Piper (1993) p. 138 Meir defended Hillgruber, saying that the criticism of him by Habermas as a Nazi sympathizer was \\"nonsensical\\".Meier in Piper (1993) p. 138 Meir ended his speech with a call for German historians to continue to study the past in a professional manner, and argued that pluralism was necessary for the historians' craft.Meier in Piper (1993) p. 142 \\"Under the Domination of Suspicion\\" The conservative German historian Thomas Nipperdey in an essay first published in Die Zeit on October 17, 1986 accused Habermas of unjustly smearing Nolte and other right-wing historians via unscholarly and dubious methods.Nipperdey in Piper (1993) pp. 143‚Äì144 Nipperdey argued that Habermas had crossed a line in his criticism of Hillgruber, Nolte, Hildebrand and St√ºrmer.Nipperdey in Piper (1993) p 143 Nipperdey wrote that historians often revise the past and blasted the \\"critical\\" historians for their \\"moralizing\\" which did more to hinder than help understand German history.Nipperdey in Piper (1993) pp. 144-145 Nipperdey accused those historians \\"critical\\" of the German past of making that the \\"monopolistic claim\\" that its \\"damning judgments\\" of the German past were the only acceptable version of history.Nipperdey in Piper (1993) p. 145 Nipperdey defended St√ºrmer's thesis that \\"there is a political right to memory\\" as it was a \\"simple fact\\".Nipperdey in Piper (1993) pp. 145-146 Nippedery wrote their history rested on the basis of \\"secured knowledge\\" with \\"stronger and weaker perspectives, more objective and less objective portrayals\\".Nipperdey in Piper (1993) p. 146 Nipperdey concluded that the \\"great debate\\" started by Habermas was \\"unfortunate\\" and should not have been started.Nipperdey in Piper (1993) p. 146 \\"Auschwitz, an Asiatic Deed\\" In letter to the editor of Der Spiegel on October 20, 1986, Imanuel Geiss accused Augstein and Habermas of trying to silence Nolte and Hillgruber.Geiss in Piper (1993) p. 147 Geiss wrote that revision of history is \\"normal\\" and did not justify Augestein's essay.Geiss in Piper (1993) p. 147 Geiss accused Augstein and Habermas of threatening \\"our scholarly and political pluralism\\".Geiss in Piper (1993) p. 147 Geiss argued that it necessary for historians to reexamine the past, and that Nolte should be allowed to ask questions, saying that people \\"who desire to defend liberal values in this country must also practice with them in dealing with dissenters\\".Geiss in Piper (1993) p. 148 \\"Standing Things On Their Head\\" In another feuilleton entitled \\"Standing Things On Their Heads\\" first published in Die Zeit on October 31, 1986, Nolte dismissed criticism of him by Habermas and J√§ckel under the grounds that their writings were no different from what could find in an East German newspaper.Nolte in Piper (1993) p. 153 Nolte contended that criticism over his use of the phrase ‚Äúrat cage‚Äù was unwarranted since he was only using the phrase ‚Äúrat cage‚Äù as an embodiment of the ‚ÄúAsiatic‚Äù horror he alleges Hitler felt about the Bolsheviks.Nolte in Piper (1993) p. 151 Nolte wrote he was not trying to reintroduce the Nazi concept of ‚ÄúJewish Bolshevism‚Äù and that ‚Äú‚Ä¶even for the uninformed reader, the reference to the Chinese Cheka‚Ä¶\\" should have made clear that he was writing about overblown fears in Germany of the Bolsheviks instead of an objective reality. In reply to the criticism of Habermas and J√§ckel, Nolte wrote: > ‚ÄúThe Gulag Archipelago is primary to Auschwitz precisely because the Gulag > was in the mind of the originator of Auschwitz; Auschwitz was not in the > minds of the originators of the Gulag‚Ä¶If J√§ckel proves his own definition > for the singularity of the Final Solution, then I think that his concept > simply elaborates what can be more briefly expressed with the term \\"racial > murder\\".

Hitler was > certainly the most powerful man that has ever lived in Germany.

Habermas‚Äôs ‚Äúexpulsion of the kulaks‚Äù speaks for > itself\\"Nolte in Piper (1993) pp. 151, 153 Interview with Andreas Hillgruber, 31 October 1986 Hillgruber defended his call for the identification with the German troops fighting on the Eastern Front in an interview with the Rheinischer Merkur newspaper on 31 October 1986, on the ground that he was only trying \\"‚Ä¶to experience things from the perspective of the main body of the population\\".Hillgruber, Andreas, \\"No Questions are Forbidden to Research\\" pp. 155-161 from Forever In The Shadow Of Hitler? edited by Ernst Piper, Atlantic Highlands, NJ: Humanities Press, 1993 p. 157. In the same 1986 interview, Hillgruber said it was necessary for a more nationalistic version of German history to be written because the East German government was embarking upon a more nationalist history, and if West German historians did not keep up with their East German counterparts in terms of German nationalism, it was inevitable that Germans would come to see the East German regime as the legitimate German state.Hillgruber, Andreas \\"No Questions are Forbidden to Research\\" pp. 155‚Äì161 from Forever In The Shadow Of Hitler? edited by Ernst Piper, Atlantic Highlands, NJ: Humanities Press, 1993 p. 160. Hillgruber was most furious with Augstein's \\"constitutional Nazi\\" line, and stated that he was considering suing Augstein for libel.Hillgruber, Andreas \\"No Questions are Forbidden to Research\\" pp. 155‚Äì161 from Forever In The Shadow Of Hitler? edited by Ernst Piper, Atlantic Highlands, NJ: Humanities Press, 1993 p. 157. Replying to the interviewer's question about whether he thought the Holocaust was unique, Hillgruber stated: > ...that the mass murder of the kulaks in the early 1930s, the mass murder of > the leadership cadre of the Red Army in 1937-38, and the mass murder of the > Polish officers who in September 1939 fell into Soviet hands are not > qualitatively different in evaluation from the mass murder in the Third > Reich.Hillgruber, Andreas, \\"No Questions are Forbidden to Research\\" pp. > 155‚Äì161 from Forever In The Shadow Of Hitler? edited by Ernst Piper, > Atlantic Highlands, NJ: Humanities Press, 1993, p. 157. In response to the interviewer's question about whatever he was a \\"revisionist\\" (by which the interviewer clearly meant negationist), Hillgruber stated that: > Revision of the results of scholarship is, as I said, in itself the most > natural thing in the world. The discipline of history lives, like every > discipline, on the revision through research of previous > conceptualizations...Here I would like to say that in principle since the > mid-1960s substantial revisions of various kinds have taken place and have > rendered absurd the clich√©d \\"image\\" that Habermas as a nonhistorian > obviously possesses.Hillgruber, Andreas \\"No Questions are Forbidden to > Research\\" pp. 155-161 from Forever In The Shadow Of Hitler? edited by Ernst > Piper, Atlantic Highlands, NJ: Humanities Press, 1993 p. 156. Replying to the interviewer's question about whether he wanted to see the revival of the original concept of the Sonderweg, that is of the idea of Germany as a great Central European power equally opposed to both the West and the East, Hillgruber denied that German history since 1945 had been that \\"golden\\", and claimed that his conception of the Central European identity he wanted to see revived was cultural, not political.Hillgruber, Andreas, \\"No Questions are Forbidden to Research\\", pp. 155‚Äì161 in Forever In The Shadow Of Hitler? edited by Ernst Piper, Atlantic Highlands, NJ: Humanities Press, 1993 pp. 159-160. Hillgruber called the idea of Germany as great power that would take on and being equally opposed to the United States and the Soviet Union as: > ...historically hopeless because of the way the Second World War ended. To > want to develop such a projection now would mean to bring the powers in the > East and the West together against the Germans. I cannot imagine that anyone > is earnestly striving for that.

Habermas wrote the Bitburg ceremony was meant to create nationalist feelings and a certain rehabilitation of the Nazi era with President Reagan and Chancellor Kohl laying wreaths at the cemetery to honor the Waffen-SS men buried there, but that for Nolte \\"Bitburg did not open the floodgates widely enough\\".Habermas, Jurgen \\"On the Public Use of History: The Official Self-Understanding of the Federal Republic Is Breaking Up\\" pp. 162-170 from Forever In The Shadow of Hitler? edited by Ernst Piper, Humanities Press, Atlantic Highlands, 1993 p. 163. Habermas wrote that: \\"This longing for the unframed memories from the perspective of the veterans can now be satisfied by reading Andreas Hillgruber's presentation of the events on the Eastern Front in 1944-45. The 'problem of identification', something that is unusual for an historian, poses itself to the author only because he wants to incorporate the perspective of the fighting troops and the affected civilian population\\".Habermas, Jurgen \\"On the Public Use of History: The Official Self-Understanding of the Federal Republic Is Breaking Up\\" pp. 162-170 from Forever In The Shadow of Hitler? edited by Ernst Piper, Humanities Press, Atlantic Highlands, 1993 p. 164.

Habermas accused Nolte, Hildebrand and Fest of engaging in personal attacks instead of debating him.Habermas, Jurgen \\"On the Public Use of History: The Official Self-Understanding of the Federal Republic Is Breaking Up\\" pp. 162‚Äì170 from Forever In The Shadow of Hitler? edited by Ernst Piper, Humanities Press, Atlantic Highlands, 1993 p. 194. About Nolte's criticism over the line \\"expulsion of the kulaks\\", Habmeras wrote: \\"I accept the criticism that, \\"annihilation\\", not \\"expulsion\\" of the kulaks is the appropriate description of this barbaric event. Enlightenment is a mutual undertaking. But the public settling of accounts by Nolte and Fset does not serve the end of enlightenment. They affect the political morality of a community that-after being liberated by Allied troops and without doing anything itself-has been established in the spirit of occidental conception of freedom, responsibility and self-determination\\".Habermas, Jurgen \\"On the Public Use of History: The Official Self-Understanding of the Federal Republic Is Breaking Up\\" pp. 162‚Äì170 from Forever In The Shadow of Hitler? edited by Ernst Piper, Humanities Press, Atlantic Highlands, 1993 p. 170.  \\"Eternally in the Shadow of Hitler?\\" Adolf Hitler. The German historian Heinrich August Winkler wrote: \\"No German historian has ever accorded Hitler such a sympathetic treatment‚Äù as did Nolte. In an essay first published in the Frankfurter Rundschau newspaper on November 14, 1986, Heinrich August Winkler wrote of Nolte's essay \\"The Past That Will Not Pass\\" that: > ‚ÄúThose who read the Frankfurter Allgemine all the way through to the culture > section were able to read something under the title ‚ÄúThe Past That Will Not > Pass‚Äù that no German historian to date had noticed: that Auschwitz was only > a copy of a Russian original-the Stalinist Gulag Archipelago. For fear of > the Bolsheviks‚Äô Asiatic will to annihilate, Hitler himself committed an > ‚ÄúAsiatic deed‚Äù. Was the annihilation of the Jews a kind of putative self- > defence? Nolte‚Äôs speculation amounts to that.‚ÄùWinkler in Piper (1993) p. 173 Writing of Nolte's claim that Weizmann's letter was a ‚ÄúJewish declaration of war‚Äù, Winkler stated that ‚ÄúNo German historian has ever accorded Hitler such a sympathetic treatment‚Äù. Winkler wrote the current controversy over the memory of the Nazi past was caused by the controversy over Bitburg ceremony, writing that just as American had learned to forget about the My Lai massacre, the Bitburg ceremony was meant to allow German \\"to be able to feel an unbroken sense of pride\\".Winkler in Piper, p. 171. Winkler charged the editors of the Frankurter Allgemeine Zeitung in response to the Bitburg controversy had started a campaign meant to end any sense of guilt over the Nazi past.Winkler in Piper, p. 172‚Äì173. Winkler asked what was the point of these comparisons of Nazi Germany to the Soviet Union and Cambodia, writing: \\"Culturally, Germany is a country of the West. It participated in the European Enlightenment and in a long tradition of the rule of law. That is not the case for Russia and certainly not for Cambodia. The crimes of Stalin and the Khmer Rouge are in no way excused by this fact. But Hitler and his helpers must be judged by our Western norms. In this historical context, the systematic genocide of the Jews ordered by the German state-but also the murder of Sinti and Roma-is the greatest crime of the twentieth century, in fact of world history\\".Winkler in Piper, p. 174. \\"Not A Concluding Remark\\" In a later newspaper feuilleton first published in the Frankurter Allgemeine Zeitung on November 20, 1986, Meier again asserted that the Holocaust was a ‚Äúsingular‚Äù occurrence, but wrote that: > ‚ÄúIt is to be hoped that Ernst Nolte‚Äôs suggestion that we should remain more > keenly aware of the various million-fold mass murders of this century bears > fruit. When one seeks orientation about this-and about the role of mass > murder in history-one is surprised by how difficult it is to find. This > would appear to be an area that historical research should look into. By > pursuing these questions, one can recognize more precisely the peculiarity > of our century-and certain similarities in its ‚Äúliquidations‚Äù. But Nolte‚Äôs > hope to be able to attenuate this distressing aspect of our Nazi past will > probably not succeed. If we, and much speaks for this, to prevent National > Socialist history from becoming an enduring negative myth about absolute > evil, then we will have to seek other paths‚Äù.Meier in Piper (1993) p. 178 Meier praised Nolte in his article ‚ÄúStanding Things On Their Head‚Äù for speaking to ‚Äúmodify‚Äù the thesis that he had introduced in ‚ÄúThe Past That Will Not Pass‚Äù about the ‚Äúcausal nexus‚Äù by claiming the ‚Äúcausal nexus‚Äù only existed in Hitler's mind‚Äù. Meir expressed his approval of J√§ckel's argument for the \\"singularity\\" of the Holocaust, writing that \\"industrial extermination\\" by Nazi Germany was a \\"qualitative leap\\".Meier in Piper (1993) p. 178 In response to Fest's argument that it was racist not to compare Germany with Cambodia, Meir stated that Germany by being a First Nation nation had \\"duties\\" that a Third World nation like Cambodia did not..Meier in Piper (1993) p. 178 Meir wrote the Historikerstreit was really about the future, namely how to \\"live with a past that is so deeply anchored in our consciousness?\\".Meier in Piper (1993) p. 179 Meir wrote that historians are always influenced by the present and historians \\"should also be able to discern uncomfortable truths\\".Meier in Piper (1993) p. 180 About St√ºrmer's call for history as an unifying force to hold together West German society for the Cold War, Meir wrote that Habermas had the right to challenge him, but did not understand the Atlanticist St√ºrmer was not an advocate of Germany as a Central European power as he alleged.Meier in Piper (1993) p. 181 Meir called St√ºrmer's theories as \\"probably not...illegitimate\\", but argued that a democratic society was always going to have diverse opinions.Meier in Piper (1993) p. 181 Meir ended his essay that the problems faced by Germans was: \\"How are going to live with this history and what conclusions can we draw from it?...We will make no progress if we use the Nazi past as a club in partisan disputes...But it is to be wished that the center, especially will be strong, for in the past, the political middle has always been capable of providing reasonable solutions, results and maxims.\\"Meier in Piper (1993) p. 183 In response to Meier's article, Nolte wrote in a letter to the editor of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung published on December 6, 1986 that he did not ‚Äúdefuse‚Äù the thesis he presented in his essay ‚ÄúThe Past That Will Not Pass‚Äù, but merely corrected a few mistakes in his essay \\"Standing Things On Their Head\\".Nolte in Piper (1993) p. 243 ‚ÄúMakeup Artists are Creating a New Identity‚Äù The political scientist Kurt Sontheimer in an essay first published in the Rheinischer Merkur newspaper on November 21, 1986 accused Nolte and company of attempting to create a new ‚Äúnational consciousness‚Äù meant to sever the Federal Republic's ‚Äúintellectual and spiritual ties to the West‚Äù.Sontheimer in Piper (1993) p. 184 Sontheimer accused Hillgruber of being guilty of \\"revisionism\\" (by which Sontheimer clearly meant negationism) in his writings on German history.Sontheimer, Kurt, \\"Makeup Artists Are Creating a New Identity\\" pp. 184-187 from Forever In The Shadow Of Hitler? edited by Ernst Piper, Atlantic Highlands, NJ: Humanities Press, 1993 p. 184. Sontheimer wrote it was impossible for historians to claim \\"pure and strict scholarly research\\" while at the same time engaging in a political project like attempting to shape national identity.Sontheimer, Kurt, \\"Makeup Artists Are Creating a New Identity\\" pp. 184-187 from Forever In The Shadow Of Hitler? edited by Ernst Piper, Atlantic Highlands, NJ: Humanities Press, 1993 p. 184. Sontheimer wrote the political basis of the Federal Republic founded in 1949 was in the Western tradition of liberal democracy and without mentioning St√ºrmer by name declared that the search for some basis in German national identity in the Imperial period to provide a \\"unified an understanding of history as possible\\" was \\"dubious\\" because there was \\"so little to be found there\\" and \\"because every attempt to provide political meaning via our predemocratic national history threatens to end the consensus of the postwar era\\".Sontheimer, Kurt, \\"Makeup Artists Are Creating a New Identity\\" pp. 184‚Äì187 from Forever In The Shadow Of Hitler? edited by Ernst Piper, Atlantic Highlands, NJ: Humanities Press, 1993 p. 187. Sonthemier wrote that the great achievements of German historians since 1945 was seeking to understand why the Weimar Republic failed and how Nazi Germany came to be, stating:\\"We were attempting to overcome the past, not to invoke it...I cannot see what better lesson those who are struggling to provide meaning through history can offer us\\".Sontheimer, Kurt, \\"Makeup Artists Are Creating a New Identity\\" pp. 184‚Äì187 from Forever In The Shadow Of Hitler? edited by Ernst Piper, Atlantic Highlands, NJ: Humanities Press, 1993 p. 187. \\"He Who Wants To Escape The Abyss In another feuilleton entitled \\"He Who Wants to Escape the Abyss\\" first published in Die Welt on November 22, 1986, Hildebrand argued in defense of Nolte that the Holocaust was one of out a long sequence of genocides in the 20th century, and asserted that Nolte was only attempting the \\"historicization\\" of National Socialism that Broszat had called forHildebrand in Piper (1993) pp. 194‚Äì195 Hildebrand accused Habermas of engaging in \\"scandalous\\" attacks on Hillgruber.Hildebrand, Klaus \\"He Who Wants to Escape the Abyss\\" pp. 188-195 from Forever In The Shadow Of Hitler? edited by Ernst Piper, Atlantic Highlands, NJ: Humanities Press, 1993 p. 191. Hildebrand claimed that \\"Habermas's criticism is based in no small part on quotations that unambiguously falsify the matter\\". Hildebrand wrote the historian are engaged in a continuous search for the truth, which always involves revision and the historiography of the Third Reich was no different.Hildebrand, Klaus \\"He Who Wants to Escape the Abyss\\" pp. 188-195 from Forever In The Shadow Of Hitler? edited by Ernst Piper, Atlantic Highlands, NJ: Humanities Press, 1993 p. 188.

St√ºrmer went on to argue that the German people had not had a really positive view of their past since the end of the First Reich, and this lack of a German identity to be proud of was responsible for all of the disasters of German history since then. St√ºrmer asserted \\"All of our interpretations of Germany had collapsed\\". As a result, he claimed that at present, the German people were living in historical \\"rubble\\", and that the Federal Republic was doomed unless the Germans once again had a sense of history that provided the necessary sense of national identity and pride St√ºrmer warned that the West Germans would face a \\"Communist future\\" if the German people did not have a history that provided for a self-confident national identity .St√ºrmer, Michael. \\"How Much History Weighs\\" pages 196-197 from Forever In The Shadow of Hitler? edited by Ernst Piper, Atlantic Highlands: Humanities Press, 1993 p. 196 Hillgruber's letter to the FAZ, 29 November 1986 Responding to Meier's comment about what why he chose to \\"identify\\" with German troops in a letter to the editor of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung on 29 November 1986, Hillgruber wrote: > Is it really so difficult for a German historian (even if he is, like Meier, > a specialist in ancient history) to realize why the author of an essay about > the collapse in the East in 1944-45 identifies with the efforts of the > German populace?

L√∂wenthal's letter to the FAZ, 29 November 1986 The German political scientist Richard L√∂wenthal noted that news of Soviet dekulakization and the Holodomor did not reach Germany until 1941, so that Soviet atrocities could not possibly have influenced the Germans as Nolte claimed.Baldwin in Baldwin (1990) p. 9 L√∂wenthal argued in a letter to the editor of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung on 29 November 1986 for the \\"fundamental difference\\" in mass murder in Germany and the Soviet Union, and against the \\"balancing\\" out of various crimes in the 20th century.L√∂wenthal in Piper (1993) p. 199 L√∂wenthal contended that comparisons between Hitler and Stalin were appropriate, but comparisons between Hitler and Lenin were not. For L√∂wenthal, the decisive factor that governed Lenin's conduct was that right from the onset when he took power, he was involved in civil wars within Russia L√∂wenthal argued that ‚ÄúLenin‚Äôs battle to hold on to power‚Äù did not comprise ‚Äúone-sided mass annihilation of defenceless people‚Äù Speaking of the Russian Civil War, L√∂wenthal argued that ‚ÄúIn all these battles there were heavy losses on both sides and horrible torture and murders of prisoners‚Äù L√∂wenthal in Piper (1993) pp. 199‚Äì200 Speaking of the differences between Lenin and Stalin, L√∂wenthal argued that ‚ÄúWhat Stalin did from 1929 on was something entirely different‚ÄùL√∂wenthal in Piper (1993) p. 200 L√∂wenthal argued that with dekulakization, the so-called ‚Äúkulaks‚Äù were to destroyed by the Soviet state as: > a hindrance to forced collectivization.

In Mommsen's view, the decisive issue was whether the Federal Republic was a continuation of the Reich that had existed from 1871 to 1945 or not. He argued that at first the continuity thesis dominated, as shown by the lavish celebrations of the 150th anniversary of Bismarck's birthday in 1965, but as a younger generation came of age, a more critical attitude towards the past emerged.Mommsen 1993, p. 205. He wrote further that German reunification \\"would presume the collapse of the Soviet empire, a premise unthinkable at the time\\".Mommsen 1993, p. 206. As a result, since German reunification was impossible in the 1950s-60s, together with the resumption of Germany as a great power, led West Germans to embrace the idea of integration into the European Economic Community and NATO as the best substitutes. Adenauer's policies of integration into the EEC and NATO suggested that the only role possible for the Federal Republic was at best as a middle-size world power whose influence stemmed from working with other Western powers. The policies of Western integration caused the idea of a continuity of German history to lose its appeal to the younger generation of West Germans, he wrote, leading to the idea popular by the late 1960s that the state founded in 1949 represented discontinuity.Mommsen 1993, p. 207. Finally, Mommsen maintained that the discontinuity thesis led to the younger generation of West Germans to become more critical of the old Reich that had existed from 1871 to 1945.Mommsen, Wolfgang \\"Neither Denial nor Forgetfulness Will Free Us\\" pp. 202‚Äì215 from Forever In The Shadow Of Hitler? edited by Ernst Piper, Atlantic Highlands, NJ: Humanities Press, 1993 p. 208. Mommsen argued that for those nationalists still attached to the idea of national continuity, these were painful developments, noting that an article by Nolte in Die Zeit had its title \\"Against Negative Nationalism in Interpreting History\\" where Nolte lashed out against historians critical of the German past.Mommsen, Wolfgang \\"Neither Denial nor Forgetfulness Will Free Us\\" pp. 202‚Äì215 from Forever In The Shadow Of Hitler? edited by Ernst Piper, Atlantic Highlands, NJ: Humanities Press, 1993 p. 208. Mommsen argued much of the writing by Nolte, Hildebrand, and St√ºrmer was clearly aiming to provide for a version of history that celebrated the continuities of German history while trying to get around the more unpleasant aspects of the Second Reich and even more so the Third Reich.Mommsen, Wolfgang \\"Neither Denial nor Forgetfulness Will Free Us\\" pp. 202‚Äì215 from Forever In The Shadow Of Hitler? edited by Ernst Piper, Atlantic Highlands, NJ: Humanities Press, 1993 p. 209. Mommsen wrote that Nolte, Hildebrand, St√ºrmer and Hillgruber were in different ways seeking a version of history that allowed for the continuity of German history to be celebrated despite the Nazi era. Mommsen argued that the Nazi period, was however painful and distasteful, part of German history and the memory of which was something all Germans had to face.Mommsen, Wolfgang \\"Neither Denial nor Forgetfulness Will Free Us\\" pp. 202‚Äì215 from Forever In The Shadow Of Hitler? edited by Ernst Piper, Atlantic Highlands, NJ: Humanities Press, 1993 p. 211 Mommsen wrote the Bitburg ceremony of 1985 was intended to \\"be a kind of line drawn under that segment of German history. But it turned out that, at least in terms of intellectual honesty, that cannot be done, and that no matter what we do, other peoples will not be willing to accept such an act from us\\".Mommsen, Wolfgang \\"Neither Denial nor Forgetfulness Will Free Us\\" pp. 202‚Äì215 from Forever In The Shadow Of Hitler? edited by Ernst Piper, Atlantic Highlands, NJ: Humanities Press, 1993 p. 211. Mommsen charged that Nolte was attempting to egregiously whitewash the German past.Mommsen in Piper (1993) pp. 208‚Äì209 Mommsen argued that Nolte was attempting a \\"justification\\" of Nazi crimes and making \\"inappropriate\\" comparisons of the Holocaust with other genocides.Mommsen in Piper (1993) p. 209 Mommsen wrote that Nolte intended to provide the sort of history that would allow Germans to feel good about being Germans by engaging in ‚Äú‚Ä¶an explanatory strategy that‚Ä¶will be seen as a justification of National Socialist crimes by all those who are still under the influence of the extreme anti-Soviet propaganda of National Socialism\\". Mommsen wrote about Hillgruber's demands that historians identified with the \\"justified\\" German defence of the Eastern Front that: > Andreas Hillgruber recently attempted to accord a relative historical > justification to the Wehrmacht campaign in the East and the desperate > resistance of the army in the East after the summer of 1944. He argued that > the goal was to prevent the German civilian population from falling into the > hands of the Red Army. However, the chief reason, he argued, was that the > defense of German cities in the East had become tantamount to defending > Western civilization. In light of the Allied war goals, which, independent > of Stalin's final plans, envisioned breaking up Prussia and destroying the > defensive position of a strong, Prussian-led Central European state that > could serve as a bulwark against Bolshevism, the continuation of the war in > the East was justified from the viewpoint of those involved. It was, as > Hillgruber's argument would have it, also justified even from today's > standpoint, despite the fact that prolonging the war in the East meant that > the gigantic murder machinery of the Holocaust would be allowed to continue > to run. All this, the essay argued, was justified as long as the fronts > held.

Accordingly, > parts of the gigantic scenery of the Second World War were, at least as far > as we were concerned, totally senseless, even self-destructive. We cannot > escape this bitter truth by assigning partial responsibility to other > partners who took part in the war.Mommsen, Wolfgang \\"Neither Denial nor > Forgetfulness Will Free Us\\" pp. 202‚Äì215 from Forever In The Shadow Of > Hitler? edited by Ernst Piper, Atlantic Highlands, NJ: Humanities Press, > 1993 p. 212. Mommsen wrote the attempts to \\"strengthen\\" the Federal Republic by writing nationalistic histories that meant to end any sense of German shame would in fact have the extract opposite effect.Mommsen, Wolfgang \\"Neither Denial nor Forgetfulness Will Free Us\\" pp. 202-215 from Forever In The Shadow Of Hitler? edited by Ernst Piper, Atlantic Highlands, NJ: Humanities Press, 1993 p. 215. Also in an essay published in the December 1, 1986 edition of The New Republic, the American historian Charles S. Maier rejected Nolte's claim of moral equivalence between the actions of the Soviet Communists and German Nazis under the grounds that while the former were extremely brutal, the latter sought the total extermination of a people, namely the Jews.Maier, Charles \\"Immoral Equivalence\\" pages 36-41 from The New Republic, Volume 195, Issue #2, 750, 1 December 1986 page 40. \\"What May Not, Cannot Be\\" The German historian Horst M√∂ller in an essay entitled \\"What May Not Be, Cannot Be\\" first published in the December 1986 edition of Beitr√§ge zur Konfliktforschung magazine argued that Nolte was not attempting to \\"excuse\\" Nazi crimes by comparing it with other crimes of others, but was instead trying to explain the Nazi war-crimes.M√∂ller in Piper (1993) p. 218 M√∂ller wrote that Habermas was highly prejudiced by his left-wing beliefs and did not really understand the work of Nolte, Hillgruber and Hildebrand, whom M√∂ller wrote were all serious historians.M√∂ller, Horst \\"What May Not Be, Cannot Be\\" pp. 216‚Äì221 from Forever In The Shadow Of Hitler? edited by Ernst Piper, Atlantic Highlands, NJ: Humanities Press, 1993 pp. 216. M√∂ller argued that Nolte was only attempting to explain \\"irrational\\" events rationally, and that the Nazis really did believe that they were confronted with a world Jewish- Bolshevik conspiracy that was out to destroy Germany. M√∂ller asserted that all historical events are unique and thus \\"singular\\". M√∂ller defended Hillgruber by arguing that: > Hillgruber comes to the conclusion, on the basis of British files that have > come to light in the meantime, that the destruction of the German Reich was > planned before the mass murder of the Jews became known - and that the mass > murder does not explain the end of the Reich ... It is hardly disputable > that the attempt to hold the Eastern Front as long as possible against the > Red Army meant protection for the German civilian populace in the eastern > provinces against murders, rapes, plundering and expulsions by Soviet > troops. It was not simply Nazi propaganda against these \\"Asiatic hordes\\" > that caused this climate of fear.

M√∂ller argued that Habermas was guilty to trying to justify Soviet crimes by writing of the \\"expulsion of the kulaks\\". M√∂ller wrote that Habermas was either \\"ignorant or shameless\\" in accusing Nolte, Hillgruber and Hildebrand of being Nazi apologists.M√∂ller, Horst \\"What May Not Be, Cannot Be\\" pp. 216-221 from Forever In The Shadow Of Hitler? edited by Ernst Piper, Atlantic Highlands, NJ: Humanities Press, 1993 pp. 220 M√∂ller wrote that Hans Mommsen and Martin Broszat were the real \\"revisionists\\" by arguing for a functionalist theories.M√∂ller, Horst \\"What May Not Be, Cannot Be\\" pp. 216-221 from Forever In The Shadow Of Hitler? edited by Ernst Piper, Atlantic Highlands, NJ: Humanities Press, 1993 pp. 221 M√∂ller ended his essay that the Nolte, Hillgruber and Hildebrand had made \\"essential contributions\\" to the historiography of the Third Reich and should not be the victims of \\"character assassination\\" as he alleged Habermas was guilty of.M√∂ller, Horst \\"What May Not Be, Cannot Be\\" pp. 216‚Äì221 from Forever In The Shadow Of Hitler? edited by Ernst Piper, Atlantic Highlands, NJ: Humanities Press, 1993 pp. 221 \\"J√ºrgen Habermas, Karl-Heinz Jan√üen, and the Enlightenment in the Year 1986\\" In an essay meant to reply to Habermas's criticism entitled \\"J√ºrgen Habermas, Karl- Heinz Jan√üen, and the Enlightenment in the Year 1986\\" first published in the right-wing Geschichte in Wissenschaft und Unterricht (History In Academics and Instruction) magazine in December 1986, Hillgruber accused Habermas of engaging in \\"scandalous\\" methods of attack.Hillgruber, Andreas \\"J√ºrgen Habermas, Karl-Heinz Jan√üen, and the Enlightenment in the Year 1986\\" pp. 222‚Äì236 from Forever In The Shadow Of Hitler? edited by Ernst Piper, Atlantic Highlands, NJ: Humanities Press, 1993 p. 223. Hillgruber lent Nolte support by commenting that what was going on in the Soviet Union in the early 1920s may had influenced Hitler's thinking on the JewsHillgruber in Piper (1993) p. 233In answer to Habermas's criticism of the sub-title of his book, Hillgruber argued that the title of his Holocaust essay, \\"Der geschichtliche Ort der Judenvernichtung\\" (The Historical Locus Of The Annihilation Of The Jews) and the first sentence of his book, in which he spoke of the \\"murder of the Jews in the territory controlled by National Socialist Germany\\", disproved Habermas's point.Hillgruber, Andreas \\"J√ºrgen Habermas, Karl-Heinz Jan√üen, and the Enlightenment in the Year 1986\\" pp. 222-236 from Forever In The Shadow Of Hitler? edited by Ernst Piper, Atlantic Highlands, NJ: Humanities Press, 1993 p. 224. In particular, Hillgruber was highly furious over the sentence about \\"tried and true higher-ups of the NSDAP\\" that Habermas had created by selective editing of Hillgruber's book.Hillgruber, Andreas \\"J√ºrgen Habermas, Karl-Heinz Jan√üen, and the Enlightenment in the Year 1986\\" pp. 222‚Äì236 from Forever In The Shadow Of Hitler? edited by Ernst Piper, Atlantic Highlands, NJ: Humanities Press, 1993 pp. 228‚Äì229. Hillgruber claimed that Habermas was waging a \\"campaign of character assassination against Michael St√ºrmer, Ernst Nolte, Klaus Hildebrand and me in the style of the all-too-familiar APO pamphlets of the late 1960s\\" [Hillgruber was attempting to associate Habermas with the APO here].Hillgruber, Andreas \\"J√ºrgen Habermas, Karl-Heinz Jan√üen, and the Enlightenment in the Year 1986\\" pp. 222‚Äì236 from Forever In The Shadow Of Hitler? edited by Ernst Piper, Atlantic Highlands, NJ: Humanities Press, 1993 p. 222. Hillgruber described Habermas as a kind of left-wing literary hit-man who had asked to \\"take apart\\" Zweierlei Untergang by Karl-Heinz Jan√üen, the editor of the culture section of the Die Zeit newspaper.Hillgruber, Andreas \\"J√ºrgen Habermas, Karl-Heinz Jan√üen, and the Enlightenment in the Year 1986\\" pp. 222‚Äì236 from Forever In The Shadow Of Hitler? edited by Ernst Piper, Atlantic Highlands, NJ: Humanities Press, 1993 pp. 222‚Äì223. Reacting to Habermas's criticism that in the Holocaust essay in Zweierlei Untergang that his use of the word \\"could\\" in a sentence where Hillgruber wrote that Hitler believed only through genocide of the Jews could Germany become a great power, which Habermas claimed might have indicated that Hillgruber shared Hitler's viewpoint, Hillgruber took much umbrage to Habermas's claim. Hillgruber stated that what he wrote in his Holocaust essay was that the German leadership in 1939 was divided into three factions. One, centred on the Nazi Party and the SS, saw the war as a chance to carry out the \\"racial reorganization\\" of Europe via mass expulsions and German colonization, whose roots Hillgruber traced to the war aims of the Pan-German League in the First World War.Hillgruber, Andreas \\"J√ºrgen Habermas, Karl-Heinz Jan√üen, and the Enlightenment in the Year 1986\\" pp. 222-236 from Forever In The Shadow Of Hitler? edited by Ernst Piper, Atlantic Highlands, NJ: Humanities Press, 1993 p. 237. Another faction comprised the traditional German elites in the military, the diplomatic service and the bureaucracy, who saw the war as a chance to destroy the settlement established by the Treaty of Versailles and to establish the world dominance that Germany had sought in the First World War. And finally, there was Hitler's \\"race\\" program, which sought the genocide of the Jews as the only way to ensure that Germany would be a world power. Hillgruber insisted that he was only describing Hitler's beliefs, and did not share them. Hillgruber argued that only by reading his second essay about the Holocaust in Zweierlei Untergang could one understand the first essay about the \\"collapse\\" on the Eastern Front. Hillgruber compared the feelings of Germans about the lost eastern territories to the feelings of the French about their lost colonies in Indochina. Hillgruber claimed that, when writing about the end of the \\"German East\\" in 1945, to understand the \\"sense of tragedy\\" that surrounded the matter one had to take the side of the German civilians who were menaced by the Red Army, and the German soldiers fighting to protect them.Hillgruber, Andreas \\"J√ºrgen Habermas, Karl-Heinz Jan√üen, and the Enlightenment in the Year 1986\\" pp. 222-236 from Forever In The Shadow Of Hitler? edited by Ernst Piper, Atlantic Highlands, NJ: Humanities Press, 1993 pp. 237-238. Hillgruber went on to write that Habermas was seeking to censor him by criticizing him for taking the German side when discussing the last days of the Eastern Front.Hillgruber, Andreas \\"J√ºrgen Habermas, Karl-Heinz Jan√üen, and the Enlightenment in the Year 1986\\" pp. 222-236 from Forever In The Shadow Of Hitler? edited by Ernst Piper, Atlantic Highlands, NJ: Humanities Press, 1993 p. 238. Replying to Habermas's charge that he was a \\"neo-conservative\\", Hillgruber wrote: > How does he come to come categorize my work as having so-called > neoconservative tendencies? For decades I have never made any bones about my > basic conservative position. Deeply suspicious as I am of all \\"leftist\\" and > other world-improving utopias, I will gladly let the label \\"conservative\\" > apply to me, meant though it is as a defamation.

Hillgruber argued that there was a contradiction in Habermas's claim that he was seeking to revive the original concept of the Sonderweg, that is, the ideology of Germany as a great Central European power that was neither of the West or the East which would mean closing Germany off to the culture of the West while at the same time accusing him of trying to create a \\"NATO philosophy\\".Hillgruber, Andreas \\"J√ºrgen Habermas, Karl-Heinz Jan√üen, and the Enlightenment in the Year 1986\\" pp. 222-236 from Forever In The Shadow Of Hitler? edited by Ernst Piper, Atlantic Highlands, NJ: Humanities Press, 1993 pp. 230-231. Hillgruber took the opportunity to once more restate his belief that there was no moral difference between the actions of the German Nazis and the Soviet Communists, and questioned whether the Holocaust was a \\"singular\\" event.Hillgruber, Andreas \\"J√ºrgen Habermas, Karl-Heinz Jan√üen, and the Enlightenment in the Year 1986\\" pp. 222-236 from Forever In The Shadow Of Hitler? edited by Ernst Piper, Atlantic Highlands, NJ: Humanities Press, 1993 pp. 232-233. Finally, Hillgruber accused Habermas of being behind the \\"agitation and psychic terror\\" suffered by non-Marxist professors in the late 1960s, and warned him that if he was trying to bring back \\"...that unbearable atmosphere that ruled in those years at West German universities, then he is deluding himself\\".Hillgruber, Andreas \\"J√ºrgen Habermas, Karl-Heinz Jan√üen, and the Enlightenment in the Year 1986\\" pp. 222-236 from Forever In The Shadow Of Hitler? edited by Ernst Piper, Atlantic Highlands, NJ: Humanities Press, 1993 p. 234. \\"The Nazi Era-A Case of Normal Tyranny?\\" In an essay entitled \\"The Nazi Era-A Case of Normal Tyranny?\\" first published in Die neue Gesellschaft magazine in late 1986, the political scientist Walter Euchner wrote that Nolte was wrong when he wrote of Hitler's alleged terror of the Austrian Social Democratic Party parades before 1914, and argued that Social Democratic parties in both Germany and Austria were fundamentally humane and pacifistic, instead of the terrorist-revolutionary entities that Nolte alleged them to be.Euchner in Piper (1993) p. 240 Euchner wrote that: > \\"Politicians like Karl Kautsky and Eduard Bernstein certainly did not > inspire anyone to phantasies about annihilation. For these Hitler needed > neither prewar Marxism nor the Gulag Archipelago. They were in fact a > product of his insanity.\\" Euchner went to argue that there was no comparison of German and Soviet crimes in his view because Germany had had an \\"outstanding intellectual heritage\\" and the Nazis had carried out a policy of genocide with the \\"voluntary support of a substantial part of the traditional elites\\". Eulchner wrote that Hildebrand's claim that the British and the Soviets had \\"horrifying\\" war aims was meant to show there everyone was equally evil in World War II and no one had the right \\"to point his finger at others\\", which Euchner wrote was clearly meant to end any reason for to see the Holocaust as special.Euchner in Piper (1993) p. 238 \\"Only by Facing the Past Can We Be Free\\" The journalist Robert Leicht in an essay first published in Die Zeit on December 26, 1986 asserted that Nolte was attempting to end the German shame over the Holocaust by making \\"absurd\\" arguments.Leicht in Piper (1993) p. 246 Leicht argued that Stalin was not the \\"real\\" cause of the Holocaust as Nolte alleged, and that because the Holocaust was without precedent in German history, it was indeed \\"singular\\". Leicht complained about the apologist effect of lines like evil \\"done in the German name\\" as making it sound as if \\"the Germans had not done these things themselves but had hired a subcontractor\\". Leicht argued that Germans \\"cannot erect straight genealogical trees\\" with regards to their history as the Nazi period could not be a source of pride, meaning there was always going to be a \\"broken relationship\\" with their history.Leicht in Piper (1993) p. 247 Leicht asserted that the Nazi era was a part of the German past that justifiably inspired shame, and there was nothing that historians and politicians could do to end this shame, as the Historikerstreit and the Bitburg controversy had just proved.Leicht in Piper (1993) p. 245 Leicht argued that aspects of German history that made Hitler possible could not be celebrated today, that the \\"historiczation\\" of National Socialism as suggested by Broszat was necessary, and that Germans should resist the appeal of myths intended to make the shame caused by the Nazi era go away.Leicht in Piper (1993) p. 247 Leicht ended his essay by writing \\"we also stand in the shadow of a history that we can no longer heal. And thus the imperative of the Enlightenment is all the more pressing\\"..Leicht in Piper (1993) p. 248  \\"Those Who Refused to Go Along\\" The political scientist Joachim Perels in an essay first published in the Frankfurter Rundscahu newspaper on December 27, 1986 argued that Nolte's bias could be seen in that Nolte was full of fury against the \\"permanent status of privilege\\" that he alleged that those who were descendants of Nazi victims were said to enjoy while at the same time having the utmost sympathy for Hitler and his alleged terror of Bolshevik \\"Asiatic deeds\\".Perels in Piper (1993) p. 251 Perels thought it was outrageous for Hillgruber to praise those German officers who stayed loyal to Hitler during the July 20th putsch as making the right moral choice, and felt that Hillgruber had slandered those Germans who chose to resist the Nazi regime as traitors who let down their country in its hour of need.Perels, Joachim \\"Those Who Refused to Go Along\\" pp. 249‚Äì253 from Forever In The Shadow Of Hitler? edited by Ernst Piper, Atlantic Highlands, NJ: Humanities Press, 1993 pp. 250‚Äì251. Perels wrote that Hillgruber's identification with those Wehrmacht officers who stayed loyal to Hitler with Germany meant excluding all of the Germans suffering in the concentration camps in 1944-45 from history.Perels, Joachim \\"Those Who Refused to Go Along\\" pp. 249‚Äì253 from Forever In The Shadow Of Hitler? edited by Ernst Piper, Atlantic Highlands, NJ: Humanities Press, 1993 pp. 251‚Äì252. In the same way, Perels wrote that Meir had praised those Germans who joined the Wehrmacht as doing their duty to the Fatherland which Perels felt disparaged those Germans who refused to join the Wehrmacht and were sent to concentration camps.Perels, Joachim \\"Those Who Refused to Go Along\\" pp. 249‚Äì253 from Forever In The Shadow Of Hitler? edited by Ernst Piper, Atlantic Highlands, NJ: Humanities Press, 1993 p. 251 Perels felt that both Meir and even more so Hillgruber with his call for historians to \\"identify\\" with the Wehrmacht had equated Germany with those who fought for Hitler, charging this way of writing history excluded those Germans opposed to Hitler.Perels, Joachim \\"Those Who Refused to Go Along\\" pp. 249‚Äì253 from Forever In The Shadow Of Hitler? edited by Ernst Piper, Atlantic Highlands, NJ: Humanities Press, 1993 pp. 251‚Äì252. Perels used as an example of what he arguing against that in 1956 the West German Supreme Court upheld the death sentences handed down to Lutheran pastor Dietrich Bonhoeffer and the lawyer Hans von Dohn√°nyi as legal, under the grounds that Hitler was the legal leader of Germany and Bonhoeffer and Dohnayi were guilty of treason by working for his overthrow, meaning their executions by the SS were lawful and the judge and prosecutor in their case did nothing wrong.Perels, Joachim \\"Those Who Refused to Go Along\\" pp. 249‚Äì253 from Forever In The Shadow Of Hitler? edited by Ernst Piper, Atlantic Highlands, NJ: Humanities Press, 1993 p. 252-253. Perels wrote that Hillgruber's book Zweierlei Untergang which praised those German officers who stayed to Hitler as making the correct ethical choice served to put him in the same moral camp as the judges of the Supreme Court who regarded Bonhoeffer and Dohn√°nyi as traitors who were properly executed. Perels argued it was time for historians to have a \\"serious discussion about the hereditary encumbrance of National Socialism\\".Perels, Joachim \\"Those Who Refused to Go Along\\" pp. 249-253 from Forever In The Shadow Of Hitler? edited by Ernst Piper, Atlantic Highlands, NJ: Humanities Press, 1993 p. 253. In this regard, Perels argued that far being \\"The Past That Will Not Go Away\\", that the memory of the Nazi period was a subject that the Germans were only tentatively even in the 1980s starting to explore.Perels, Joachim \\"Those Who Refused to Go Along\\" pp. 249-253 from Forever In The Shadow Of Hitler? edited by Ernst Piper, Atlantic Highlands, NJ: Humanities Press, 1993 pp. 252‚Äì253. ‚ÄúOn the Historkerstreit‚Äù In an essay first published in the Evangelische Kommentare magazine in February 1987, Geiss called Nolte's claim about Weizmann's letter being a Jewish ‚Äúdeclaration of war‚Äù as ‚Äúhair-raising nonsense‚ÄùGeiss in Piper (1993) p. 255 Geiss wrote that both essays in Zweierlei Untergang were \\"respectable\\", but that it was \\"irritating\\" and ill- advised on the part of Hillgruber to publish them together, with the implied moral equivalence between the expulsion of the Germans from Eastern Europe, and the genocide of the Jews. Geiss accused Habermas of engaging in a \\"malicious insinuation\\" in his attacks on Hillgruber.Geiss, Imanuel \\"On the Historikerstreit\\" pp. 254‚Äì258 from Forever In The Shadow Of Hitler? edited by Ernst Piper, Atlantic Highlands, NJ: Humanities Press, 1993 p. 256. Geiss wrote that Hillgruber's demand that historians had to side with German troops fighting on the Eastern Front was problematic, but it did \\"...not justify the merciless severity, almost in the tone of an Old Testament prophet with which Habermas goes after this dissident historian\\". Habermas's Note of 23 February 1987 Habermas in \\"Note\\" of 23 February 1987 responded to the criticism of Hillgruber and Hildebrand of dishonesty by noting a small error in his article \\"Damage Control in German History\\" that both Hillgruber and Hildebrand ignored.Habermas in Piper, p. 260. Habermas responded to the criticism of St√ºrmer denying that he was seeking \\"endow history with meaning\\" by citing his remark from his 1986 book Dissonanzen des Fortschritts: \\"It appears necessary to abandon the merely apparent difference between social history and cultural history and to understand that at the end of the twentieth century humans residing in industrial cultures must more than ever before seek and comprehend their historical identity in order not to lose themselves\\".Habermas in Piper, p. 260. About the line of \\"true and tried\\" Nazi officials, Habermas justified the procedure under the grounds that in general Hillgruber spoke warmly of the role that Nazi Party officials played in helping to sustain the \\"justified\\" defense in eastern Germany in Zweierlei Untergang, writing that Hillgruber's approach to the subject is one where the war effort of Nazi Germany is applauded.Habermas in Piper, p. 260. Habermas went on to argue that: \\"And in any case, this ridiculous dispute about words and secondary virtues just confirms Hillgruber's lack of objectivity about this entire sphere. This a case of praising the fire department that set the fire\\".Habermas, J√ºrgen \\"Note, 23 February 1987 pp. 260-262 from Forever In The Shadow Of Hitler? edited by Ernst Piper, Atlantic Highlands, NJ: Humanities Press, 1993 p. 261. Habermas ended his article with the remark that Hillgruber was an extremely shoddy historian, claiming that Hillgruber's charge that he was a leading 60s radical who was behind \\"...the agitation unleashed by extreme leftists at West German universities and on the psychic terror aimed at individual non-Marxist colleagues\\" was simply not supported by the facts, and told Hillgruber to read one of his own books about his actions in the late 1960s before making such claims. Nolte's Note of 15 April 1987 Nolte in his \\"Note\\" of 15 April 1987 wrote his principle objection to the subtitle to Piper's book, saying he wanted it to be the \\"Documentation of the Controversy Surrounding the Preconditions and the Character of the 'Final Solution of the Jewish Question'\\" instead of \\"The Documentation of the Controversy Concerning the Singularity of the National Socialist Annihilation of the Jews\\".Nolte in Piper, p. 263. Fest Postscript, 21 April 1987 Nolte's admirer Joachim Fest was later to argue in his \\"Postscript\\" of April 21, 1987 that Nolte was motivated by purely scholarly concerns, and was only attempting the \\"historicization\\" of National Socialism that Martin Broszat called forFest in Piper (1993) p. 265 Fest wrote that in his view: > \\"In its substance, the dispute was initiated by Ernst Nolte's question > whether Hitler's monstrous will to annihilate the Jews, judging from its > origin, came from early Viennese impressions or, what is more likely, from > later Munich experiences, that is, whether Hitler was an originator or > simply being reactive.

The > conclusions would probably not have caused as much controversy if they had > been accompanied by special circumstances\\"Fest in Piper (1993) p. 264 Fest accused Habermas and his allies of attempting to silence those whose views they disliked. Fest wrote that: > \\"Standing on the one side, to simplify, are those who want to preserve > Hitler and National Socialism as a kind of antimyth that can be used for > political intentions‚Äîthe theory of a conspiracy on the part of the political > right, to which Nolte, St√ºrmer, and Hillgruber are linked.

The controversy over Nolte's thesis These views ignited a firestorm of controversy. Most historians in West Germany and virtually all historians outside Germany condemned Nolte's interpretation as factually incorrect, and as coming dangerously close to justifying the Holocaust.Kershaw, p. 173 Many historians, such as Steven T. Katz, claimed that Nolte's ‚ÄúAge of Genocide‚Äù concept ‚Äútrivialized‚Äù the Holocaust by reducing it to one of just many 20th century genocides.Katz, Steven The Holocaust in Historical Context Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1994 pp. 23‚Äì24 A common line of criticism were that Nazi crimes, above all the Holocaust, were singularly and uniquely evil, and could not be compared to the crimes of others. Some historians such as Hans- Ulrich Wehler were most forceful in arguing that the sufferings of the ‚Äúkulaks‚Äù deported during the Soviet ‚Äúdekulakization‚Äù campaign of the early 1930s were in no way analogous to the suffering of the Jews deported in the early 1940s. Many were angered by Nolte's claim that \\"the so-called annihilation of the Jews under the Third Reich was a reaction or a distorted copy and not a first act or an original\\", with many such as Ian Kershaw wondering why Nolte spoke of the \\"so-called annihilation of the Jews\\" in describing the Holocaust. Some of the historians who denounced Nolte's views included Hans Mommsen, J√ºrgen Kocka, Detlev Peukert, Martin Broszat, Hans- Ulrich Wehler, Michael Wolffsohn, Heinrich August Winkler, Wolfgang Mommsen, Karl Dietrich Bracher and Eberhard J√§ckel. Much (though not all) of the criticism of Nolte came from historians who favored either the Sonderweg (Special Way) and/or intentionalist/functionalist interpretations of German history. From the advocates of the Sonderweg approach came the criticism that Nolte's views had totally externalized the origins of the National Socialist dictatorship to the post-1917 period, whereas in their view, the roots of the Nazi dictatorship can be traced back to the 19th century Second Reich. In particular, it was argued that within the virulently and ferociously anti- Semitic V√∂lkisch movement, which first arose in the latter half of the 19th century, the ideological seeds of the Shoah were already planted. From both functionalist and intentionist historians came the similar criticism that the motives and momentum for the ‚ÄúFinal Solution to the Jewish Question‚Äù came primarily from within Germany, not as the result of external events. Intentionalists argued that Hitler did not need the Russian Revolution to provide him with a genocidal mindset, while functionalists argued it was the unstable power structure and bureaucratic rivalries of the Third Reich, which led to genocide of the Jews. Another line of criticism centered around Nolte refusal to say just precisely when he believes the Nazis decided upon genocide, and have pointed out that at various times, Nolte has implied the decision for genocide was taken in the early 1920s, or the early 1930s or the 1940s. Coming to Nolte's defence were the journalist Joachim Fest, the philosopher Helmut Fleischer, and the historians' Klaus Hildebrand, Rainer Zitelmann, Hagen Schulze, Thomas Nipperdey and Imanuel Geiss. The latter was unusual amongst Nolte's defenders as Geiss was normally identified with the left, while the rest of Nolte's supporters were seen as either on the right or holding centrist views. In response to Wehler's book, Geiss later published a book entitled Der Hysterikerstreit. Ein unpolemischer Essay (The Hysterical Dispute An Unpolemical Essay) in which he largely defended Nolte against Wehler's criticisms. Geiss wrote Nolte's critics had \\"taken in isolation\\" his statements and were guilty of being \\"hasty readers\\"Evans, p. 33 Further adding to the controversy was a statement by Nolte in June 1987 that Adolf Hitler \\"created the state of Israel\\", and that \\"the Jews would eventually come to appreciate Hitler as the individual who contributed more than anyone else to the creation of the state of Israel\\". As a result of that remark, Nolte was sacked from his position as chief editor of the German language edition of Theodore Herzl's letters by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (German Research Community), the group that was responsible for the financing of the Herzl papers project. Another controversial claim by Nolte was his statement that massacres of the Volksdeutsch minority in Poland after the German invasion of 1939 were an act of genocide by the Polish government, and thereby justified the German aggression as part of an effort to save the German minority. Another contentious set of claims by Nolte was his argument that the film Shoah showed that it was \\"probable\\" that the SS were just as much victims of the Holocaust as were the Jews, and the Polish victims of the Germans were just as much anti-Semites as the Nazis, thereby proving it was unjust to single out Germans for criticism.Evans, p. 31Lipstadt, p. 214 Nolte claimed that more ‚ÄúAryans‚Äù than Jews were murdered at Auschwitz, a fact overlooked because most Holocaust research comes ‚Äúto an overwhelming degree from Jewish authors‚Äù. Likewise, Nolte has implied that the atrocities committed by the Germans in Poland and the Soviet Union were justified by earlier Polish and Soviet atrocities.Evans, pp. 56‚Äì57 In response, Nolte's critics have argued that though there were massacres of ethnic Germans in Poland in 1939 (about 4,000 to 6,000 being killed after the German invasion), these were not part of a genocidal program on the part of the Poles, but were rather the ad hoc reaction of panic-stricken Polish troops to (sometimes justified) rumors of fifth column activities on the part of the volksdeutsch, and can not in any way be compared to the more systematic brutality of the German occupiers towards the Poles, which led to a 25% population reduction in Poland during the war.Evans, p. 57 Another contentious statement by Nolte was his argument that the Wannsee Conference of 1942 never occurred. Nolte wrote that too many Holocaust historians were \\"biased\\" Jewish historians, whom Nolte strongly hinted manufactured the minutes of the Wannsee conference. The British historian Richard J. Evans was highly offended by Nolte's claims that German massacres of Soviet Jews carried out by the Einsatzgruppen and the Wehrmacht were a legitimate \\"preventive security\\" measure that was not a war crime.Evans, p. 82 Nolte wrote that during World War I, the Germans would have been justified in exterminating the entire Belgian people as an act of \\"preventive security\\" because of franc-tireur attacks, and thus the Rape of Belgium was an act of German restraint; similarly, Nolte wrote that because many Soviet partisans were Jews, the Germans were within their rights in seeking to kill every single Jewish man, women and child they encountered in Russia as an act of \\"preventive security\\". In particular, controversy centered on an argument of Nolte's 1985 essay ‚ÄúBetween Myth and Revisionism‚Äù from the book Aspects of the Third Reich, first published in German as \\"Die negative Lebendigkeit des Dritten Reiches\\" (\\"The Negative Legend of the Third Reich\\") as an opinion piece in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung on 24 July 1980, but which did not attract widespread attention until 1986 when J√ºrgen Habermas criticized the essay in a feuilleton piece.Evans, pp. 152‚Äì153 Nolte had delivered a lecture at the Siemans-Sitftung in 1980, and excerpts from his speech were published in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung without attracting controversy.Piper in Piper (1993) p. 272 In his essay, Nolte argued that if the PLO were to destroy Israel, then the subsequent history written in the new Palestinian state would portray the former Israeli state in the blackest of colors with no references to any of the positive features of the defunct state.Nolte in Koch (1985) p. 21 In Nolte's opinion, a similar situation of history written only by the victors exists in regards to the history of Nazi Germany. Many historians, such as British historian Richard J. Evans, have asserted that, based on this statement, Nolte appears to believe that the only reason why Nazism is regarded as evil is because Germany lost World War II, with no regard for the Holocaust.Evans, pp. 32‚Äì33 Klaus Hildebrand called in a review in the Historische Zeitschrift journal on 2 April 1986 called Nolte's essay \\"Between Myth and Revisionism\\" ‚Äútrailbrazing‚Äù.Lipstadt, p. 213 In the same review of Nolte's essay \\"Between Myth and Revisionism\\", Hildebrand argued Nolte had in a praiseworthy way sought: > \\"to incorporate in historicizing fashion that central element for the > history of National Socialism and of the \\"Third Reich\\" of the annihilatory > capacity of the ideology and of the regime, and to comprehend this > totalitarian reality in the interrelated context of Russian and German > history\\".Kershaw, p. 232; original remarks appeared in Historische > Zeitschrift, Volume 242, 1986, p. 465 Entsorgung der deutschen Vergangenheit? (1988) Hans-Ulrich Wehler was so enraged by Nolte's views that he wrote a book Entsorgung der deutschen Vergangenheit?: ein polemischer Essay zum \\"Historikerstreit\\" (Exoneration of the German Past?: A Polemical Essay about the \\"Historikerstreit\\") in 1988, a lengthy polemic attacking every aspect of Nolte's views. Wehler described the Historikerstreit as a \\"political struggle\\" for the historical understanding of the German past between \\"a cartel devoted to repressing and excusing\\" the memory of the Nazi years, of which Nolte was the chief member, against \\"the representatives of a liberal-democratic politics, of an enlightened, self- critical position, of a rationality which is critical of ideology\\".Muller, p. 40 In another essay, Wehler declared: > \\"Hitler supposedly believed in the reality of this danger [of the Soviet > Union threatening Germany]. Moreover, his dread of being overwhelmed by the > \\"Asiatic\\" Bolsheviks was allegedly the prime motivating force behind his > policies and personality. Nolte restated his axiom-one which perhaps > reflects the naivet√© of an historian who has devoted his life's work to the > power of ideologies-in a blunter, more pointed form than ever before in the > fall of 1987: \\"To view Hitler as a German politician rather the anti-Lenin\\", > he reproved hundreds of knowledgeable historians, \\"strikes me as a proof of > a regrettable myopia and narrowness\\". Starting from his premise, and falling > under the sway of the very fears and phobias he himself has played up, Nolte > once again defiantly insisted: \\"If Hitler was a person fundamentally driven > by fears-by among others a fear of the \\"rat cage\\"-and if this renders \\"his > motivations more understandable\\", then the war against the Soviet Union was > not only \\"the greatest war ever of destruction and enslavement\\", but also > \\"in spite of this, objectively speaking [!], a preemptive war\\". > > While Nolte may like to describe his motive as the purely scientific > interest of (as he likes to put it) a solitary thinker in search of a > supposedly more complex, more accurate understanding of the years between > 1917 and 1945, a number of political implications are clearly present. The > basic tendency of Nolte's reinterpretation is to unburden German history by > relativizing the Holocaust. Nolte claims the Nazi mass murder was modeled on > and instigated by the excesses of the Russian Revolution, the Stalinist > regime and the Gulag; that it countered this \\"Asiatic\\" danger by imitating > and surpassing it. This new localization of \\"absolute evil\\" in Nolte's > political theology leads away from Hitler, National Socialism and German > history. It shifts the real origins of fascist barbarism onto the Marxist > postulate-and the Bolshevik practice-of extermination. Once again the > classic mechanism of locating the source of evil outside one's own history > is at work. The German war of destruction certainly remains inhuman. But > because its roots supposedly lie in the Marxist theory and Bolshevik class > warfare, the German perpetrator is now seen to be reacting in defensive, > understandable panic to the \\"original\\" inhumanity of the East. From there, > it is only one more step to the astounding conclusion that Hitler's invasion > of the Soviet Union in June 1941 and the war of conquest and extermination > that followed were \\"objectively speaking\\"-one can hardly believe one's > eyes-\\"a preemptive war\\".Wehler in Baldwin (1990) pp. 218‚Äì219 Der europ√§ische B√ºrgerkrieg (1987) Another area of controversy was Nolte's 1987 book Der europ√§ische B√ºrgerkrieg and some accompanying statements, in which Nolte appeared to flirt with Holocaust denial as a serious historical argument.Evans, p. 83 In a letter to Otto Dov Kulka of 8 December 1986 Nolte criticized the work of French Holocaust denier Robert Faurisson on the ground that the Holocaust did in fact occur, but went on to argue that Faurisson's work was motivated by admirable motives, in the form of sympathy for Palestinians and opposition to Israel.Maier (1988) p. 190 In Der europ√§ische B√ºrgerkrieg, Nolte claimed that the intentions of Holocaust deniers are \\"often honorable\\", and that some of their claims are \\"not obviously without foundation\\". Kershaw has argued that Nolte was operating on the borderlines of Holocaust denial with his implied claim that the \\"negative myth\\" of the Third Reich was created by Jewish historians, his allegations of the domination of Holocaust scholarship by Jewish historians, and his statements that one should withhold judgment on Holocaust deniers, whom Nolte insists are not exclusively Germans or fascists. In Kershaw's opinion, Nolte is attempting to imply that perhaps Holocaust deniers are on to something. In Der europ√§ische B√ºrgerkrieg, Nolte made five different arguments as a way of criticizing the uniqueness of the Shoah thesis. There were: *There were other equally horrible acts of violence in the 20th century.Evans, Richard In Hitler‚Äôs Shadow, New York: Pantheon, 1989 pages 80-81. Some of the examples Nolte cited were the Armenian genocide, Soviet deportation of the so-called ‚Äútraitor nations‚Äù like the Crimean Tatars and the Volga Germans, British ‚Äúarea bombing‚Äù in World War II, and American violence in the Vietnam War.Evans, Richard In Hitler‚Äôs Shadow, New York: Pantheon, 1989 page 81. *Nazi genocide was only a copy of Soviet genocide, and thus can in no way can be considered unique. In support of this, Nolte claimed that Lenin had ‚Äúexterminated‚Äù the Russian intelligentsia, and used Hitler's remark at press conference of November 10, 1938 where he commented he might have to ‚Äúexterminate‚Äù the German intelligentsia as an example how he feels that Hitler had merely copied Lenin. *Nolte argued that the vast majority of Germans had no knowledge of the Shoah while it was going on Nolte claimed that the genocide of the Jews was Hitler's personal pet project, and the Holocaust was the work of only a few Germans entirely unrepresentative of German society Against the American historian Raul Hilberg, who claimed that hundreds of thousands of Germans were complicit in the Shoah from high-ranking bureaucrats to railway clerks and locomotive conductors, Nolte argued that the functional division of labour in a modern society meant that most people in Germany had no idea of how they were assisting in genocide.Evans, Richard In Hitler‚Äôs Shadow, New York: Pantheon, 1989 page 82. In support of this, Nolte cited the voluminous memoirs of German generals and Nazi leaders like Albert Speer who claimed to have no idea that their country was engaging in genocide during World War II. *Nolte maintained that to a certain degree, Nazi anti-Semitic policies were justified responses to Jewish actions against Germany such as Weizmann's alleged 1939 ‚Äúdeclaration of war‚Äù on Germany. *Finally, Nolte hinted that perhaps the Holocaust never happened at all.Evans, Richard In Hitler‚Äôs Shadow, New York: Pantheon, 1989 p. 83. Nolte claimed that the Wannsee Conference never happened, and argues that most Holocaust scholarship is flawed because most Holocaust historians are Jewish, and thus ‚Äúbiased‚Äù against Germany and in favour of the idea that there was a Holocaust. In Der europ√§ische B√ºrgerkrieg, Nolte wrote that in 1939 Germany was a \\"liberal\\" country compared with the Soviet Union.Evans, Richard In Hitler‚Äôs Shadow, New York: Pantheon, 1989 page 156. Nolte argued that most German citizens provided that there were \\"Aryans\\" and were not politically active had little to fear from the Gestapo whereas in the Soviet Union at the same time millions were being arrested, tortured and executed by the NKVD. Likewise, Nolte argued that the death rate in the German concentration camps was lower those in the Soviet Gulag camps, and used Hitler's long-running dispute with the German judiciary over the \\"correct\\" sentences to hand down as an example of how 1939 Germany was a \\"normal\\" country compared to the Soviet Union since Stalin did not have the same trouble with his judges over the \\"correct\\" sentences to hand out. The British historian Richard J. Evans wrote that Nolte was taking Hitler's dispute with the judiciary out of context, and that differences between German judges and Hitler were of a degree, not of kind. Another controversial statement by Nolte in Der europ√§ische B√ºrgerkrieg was his comment that the Kristallnacht pogrom was not that bad as pogroms in Imperial Russia killed far more Jews than those killed in Kristallnacht, and that anymore more people were in being killed in the Soviet Union during the Great Terror at the same time than were killed in the Kristallnacht.Evans, Richard In Hitler‚Äôs Shadow, New York: Pantheon, 1989 page 155. Likewise, Nolte argued that Nazi anti-Semitic laws had hardly affected Jewish participation in the German economy. In this respect, Nolte favourably cited the remarks by Sir Horace Rumbold, the British Ambassador to Germany 1928-33 who claimed that the ‚Äúostentatious kind of lifestyle of Jewish bankers and monied people inevitably aroused envy, as unemployment spread generally‚Äù and who spoke of ‚Äúthe sins of the Russian and Galician Jews‚Äù who came to Germany after 1918. The British historian Richard J. Evans accused Nolte of engaging in ‚Äúcomparative trivialization‚Äù with his statements about Kristallnacht and through admitting that Nolte was correct about the higher death toll in Russian pogroms and the Great Terror argued that was irrelevant to the horrors of Kristallnacht. Evans went on to write that Nolte appeared to be ignorant of the effects of various anti-Semitic laws in 1930s Germany which forbid Jews from engaging in professions like the law, medicine, the civil service while the ‚ÄúAryanization‚Äù campaign saw mass expropriations of Jewish businesses. A further controversial claim in was Nolte's statement violence in the defence of the social order is always preferable to violence aiming at the destruction of the social order.Evans, Richard In Hitler‚Äôs Shadow, New York: Pantheon, 1989 page 29. Thus, Nolte argued that the notorious lenience of judges in the Weimar Republic towards perpetrators of violence from the right while imposing stiff sentences on perpetrators of violence from the left was justified. In this way, Nolte maintained that the very harsh sentences given to the leaders of the Rote Ocktober (Red October) putsch attempt in Hamburg of October 1923 were justified while the light sentences that Hitler and the other Nazi leaders received for the Munich Beer Hall Putsch of November 1923 were also completely warranted because Nolte claimed that the Nazis were only attempting to overthrow the Weimar Republic in order to save the social order. Nolte claimed that the German Communists were seeking the \\"social destruction of the bourgeoisie\\" in the interests of the Soviet Union, which \\"physically exterminated these classes\\" while the Nazis sought only the destruction of the \\"Versailles system\\".Evans, Richard In Hitler‚Äôs Shadow, New York: Pantheon, 1989 page 30. In 1988, the German historian Eckhard Jesse called Der europ√§ische B√ºrgerkrieg a \\"great and bold work\\" that \\"the time is not yet ripe\\" for.Evans, Richard In Hitler‚Äôs Shadow, New York: Pantheon, 1989 page 177. Jesse claimed that it would take decades for historians to fully appreciate Nolte's achievement with Der europ√§ische B√ºrgerkrieg. The British historian Richard J. Evans called Jesse's remarks the most inane remark anyone made during the entire Historikerstreit. Nolte's critic, the British historian Richard J. Evans accused Nolte of taking too seriously the work of Holocaust deniers, whom Evans called cranks, not historians. Likewise, Evans charged that Nolte was guilty of making assertions not supported by the evidence as claiming that the SS massacres of Russian Jews was a form of counterinsurgency or taking at face value the self-justifying claims of German generals who professed to be ignorant of the Shoah. Evans wrote that it was not enough for Nolte to cite the claim of a functional division of labour in modern society as a way of rebutting Hilburg, instead arguing that as a historian Nolte should have found evidence that most people in Germany did not know of the \\"Final Solution\\" rather than just a quoting a sociological theory.Evans, Richard In Hitler‚Äôs Shadow, New York: Pantheon, 1989 page 84. Evans wrote that most of Nolte's claims were either Der europ√§ische B√ºrgerkrieg rested either on speculation and/or were based on a slight base of evidence often taken wildly out of context.Evans, Richard In Hitler‚Äôs Shadow, New York: Pantheon, 1989 page 85. Moreover, Evans claimed that the bibliography of Der europ√§ische B√ºrgerkrieg suggested that Nolte was not aware of much of the vast secondary sources on German and Soviet history. Perhaps the most extreme response to Nolte's thesis occurred on 9 February 1988, when his car was burned by leftist extremists in Berlin.Evans, p. 177 Nolte called the case of arson \\"terrorism\\", and maintained that the attack was inspired by his opponents in the Historikerstreit. Views from outside Germany=Contemporaneous views Criticism from abroad came from Ian Kershaw, Gordon A. Craig, Richard J. Evans, Saul Friedl√§nder, John Lukacs, Michael Marrus, and Timothy Mason. Mason wrote against Nolte in a call for the sort of theories of generic fascism that Nolte himself had once championed: > ‚ÄúIf we can do without much of the original contents of the concept of > ‚Äòfascism‚Äô, we cannot do without comparison. ‚ÄúHistoricization‚Äù may easily > become a recipe for provincialism. And the moral absolutes of Habermas, > however politically and didactically impeccable, also carry a shadow of > provincialism, as long as they fail to recognize that fascism was a > continental phenomenon and that Nazism was a peculiar part of something much > larger. Pol Pot, the rat torture and the fate of the Armenians are all > extraneous to any serious discussion of Nazism; Mussolini‚Äôs Italy is > not.‚ÄùMason, Timothy ‚ÄúWhatever Happened to ‚ÄòFascism‚Äô?‚Äù pp. 253- 263 from > Reevaluating the Third Reich edited by Jane Caplan and Thomas Childers, > Holmes & Meier, 1993 p. 260 Anson Rabinbach accused Nolte of attempting to erase German guilt for the Holocaust.Rabinbach in Baldwin (1990) p. 65 Ian Kershaw wrote that Nolte was claiming that the Jews had essentially brought the Holocaust down on themselves, and were the authors of their own misfortunes in the Shoah.Kershaw, pp. 175‚Äì176 Elie Wiesel called Nolte, together with Klaus Hildebrand, Andreas Hillgruber, and Michael St√ºrmer, one of the ‚Äúfour bandits‚Äù of German historiography.Lukacs, John The Hitler of History p. 238 American historian Jerry Muller called Nolte an anti-Semitic for suggesting that the only reason people kept the memory of the Nazi past alive was to place those descended from the victims of National Socialism in a \\"privileged\\" position.Muller, pp. 37‚Äì38 Muller accused Nolte of writing \\"pseudo-history\\" in Der Europ√§ische B√ºrgrkrieg. Deborah Lipstadt argued in her 1993 book Denying the Holocaust that there was no comparison between the Khmer Rouge genocide and the Holocaust because the former had emerged as part of the aftermath of a war that destroyed Cambodia whereas the latter was part of a systematic attempt at genocide committed only because of ideological beliefs.Lipstadt, p. 212 The American historian Charles Maier rejected Nolte's claims regarding the moral equivalence of the Holocaust and Soviet terror on the grounds that while the latter was extremely brutal, it did not seek the physical annihilation of an entire people as a state policy.Maier (1988) p. 82 The American historian Donald McKale blasted Nolte together with Andreas Hillgruber for their statements that the Allied strategic bombing offensives were just as much acts of genocide as was the Holocaust, writing that that was just the sort of nonsense one would expect from Nazi apologists like Nolte and Hillgruber.McKale, Donald Hitler's Shadow War, New York: CooperSquare Press, 2002 p. 445 In response to Nolte's article \\"Between Myth and Revisionism\\", Israeli historian Otto Dov Kulka in a letter to Nolte on November 24, 1985 criticized Nolte for abandoning the view that he expressed in The Three Faces of Fascism that the Holocaust was a \\"singular\\" event, and asked \\"Which of the two Ernst Noltes should we regard as the authentic one?\\"Kulka in Baldwin (1990) p. 153 In his reply, Nolte told Kulka to read his up-coming book Der europ√§ische B√ºrgerkrieg to better understand his \\"shift of emphasis\\".Kulka in Baldwin (1990) pp. 153‚Äì154 In a reply of May 16, 1986, Kulka accused Nolte of engaging in a \\"shift of responsibility\\" with the Holocaust as a \\"preventive measure\\" forced on the Germans by the \\"Jewish provocation\\" of Weizmann's letter to Chamberlain.Kulka in Baldwin (1990) p. 154 In a letter to Nolte on July 18, 1986, Kulka wrote in defense of the \\"singularity\\" of the Holocaust that: \\"The uniqueness of the National Socialist mass murder of the Jews must be understood in the world-historical sense attributed to it-as an attempt to bring about a change in the course of universal history and its goals. Thus, National Socialist anti-Semitism must be regarded as an expression of perhaps the most dangerous crisis of Western civilization with the potentially gravest consequences for the history of mankind...\\"Kulka in Baldwin (1990) p. 166 In a letter to Kulka on October 22, 1986, Nolte wrote: \\"If I pursed my thinking from 1963 on, it was in a way along the line that an overexaggerated right can be equally an evil, and that an overexaggerated (historical) evil can again, in some way, be right\\" (emphasis in the original). Kulka accused Nolte of advancing \\"monocausal, retrospective explanations of universal history\\" and of engaging in \\"totalitarian thinking\\". The Anglo-German historian H.W. Koch accepted Nolte's argument that Weizmann's letter to Chamberlain was indeed a ‚ÄúJewish declaration of war‚Äù, with the oblivious implication since all Jews were now enemies of the Reich, the Germans were entitled to treat the Jews whatever way they wanted to.Koch, H.W. ‚ÄúIntroduction‚Äù from Aspects of the Third Reich pp. 378‚Äì379 From abroad came support from Norberto Ceresole and Alfred-Maurice de Zayas. In a 1987 essay, the Austrian-born Israeli historian Walter Grab accused Nolte of engaging in an ‚Äúapologia‚Äù for Nazi Germany.Grab, Walter ‚ÄúGerman Historians And The Trivialization of Nazi Criminality‚Äù pp. 273‚Äì278 from The Australian Journal Of Politics and History, Volume 33, Issue #3, 1987 p. 274 Grab called Nolte's claim that Weizmann's letter to Chamberlain was a \\"Jewish declaration of war\\" that justified the Germans \\"interning\\" European Jews a \\"monstrous theses\\" that was not supported by the facts. Grab accused Nolte of ignoring the economic impoverishment and the total lack of civil rights that the Jewish community in Germany lived under in 1939. Grab wrote that Nolte \\"mocks\\" the Jewish victims of National Socialism with his \\"absolutely infamous\\" statement that it was Weizmann's with his letter that caused all of the Jewish death and suffering during the Holocaust. One of Nolte's letters created another controversy in late 1987, when Otto Dov Kulka complained that a letter he wrote to Nolte criticizing his views was edited by Nolte to make him appear rather sympathetic to Nolte's arguments, and then released to the press.Kershaw, p. 171 In 1987, Nolte wrote an entire book responding to his critics both German and foreign, Das Vergehen der Vergangenheit : Antwort an meine Kritiker im sogenannten Historikerstreit (The Offense Of The Past: Answer At My Critics In The So-Called Historians' Dispute), which again attracted controversy because Nolte reprinted the edited version of Kulka's letters, despite the latter's objections to their inclusion in the book in their truncated form. In Das Vergehen der Vergangenheit, Nolte declared that the Historikerstreit should have begun 25 years earlier because \\"everything which has provoked such excitement in the course of this dispute had already been spelled out in those books [Nolte's earlier work]\\" and that \\"the simple scheme 'perpetrators-victims' reduces the complexities of history too much\\" (emphasis in the original). In Das Vergehen der Vergangenheit, Nolte appeared to backtrack from some of his theories, writing that after Weizmann's letter, European Jews should be treated as \\"civil internees\\" rather as \\"prisoners of war\\".Evans, p. 152 Evans wrote that the sole purpose of Das Vergehen der Vergangenheit appeared to be to obscure the issues by making confusing statements about what he actually said and wrote, and that Nolte's real purpose to justify the Shoah as there is not other reason why Nolte should have been making these arguments. When an anthology was published about the Historikerstreit, Nolte objected to the subtitle ‚ÄúThe Documentation of the Controversy Concerning the Singularity of the National Socialist Annihilation of the Jews‚Äù, and instead demanded that the subtitle be ‚ÄúDocumentation of the Controversy Surrounding the Preconditions and the Character of the ‚ÄúFinal Solution of the Jewish Question‚Äù.Nolte in Piper (1993) p. 263 Only when it became clear that the book could not be published, did Nolte yield on his demands. The Historikerstreit attracted much media attention in West Germany, where historians enjoy a higher public profile than is the case in the English-speaking world, and as a result, both Nolte and his opponents became frequent guests on West German radio and television.Kershaw, p. 170 The Historikerstreit was characterized by a highly vitriolic tone, with both Nolte and his supporters and their opponents often resorting to vicious personal attacks on each other.Evans, pp. 116‚Äì117 In particular, the Historikerstreit marked the first occasion since the ‚ÄúFischer Controversy‚Äù of the early 1960s when German historians refused to shake hands with each other.Evans, p. 22 Abroad, the Historikerstreit garnered Nolte some fame, to a somewhat lesser extent. Outside of Austria, foreign press coverage tended to be hostile towards Nolte, with the fiercest criticism coming from Israel. In 1988, an entire edition of Yad Vashem Studies, the journal of the Yad Vashem Institute in Jerusalem, was devoted to the Historikerstreit. A year earlier, in 1987, concerns about some of the claims being made by both sides in the Historikerstreit led to a conference being called in London that was attended by some of the leading British, American, Israeli, and German specialists in both Soviet and German history. Among those who attended included Sir Ralf Dahrendorf, Sir Isaiah Berlin, Lord Weidenfeld, Harold James, Carol Gluck, Lord Annan, Fritz Stern, Gordon A. Craig, Robert Conquest, Samuel Ettinger, J√ºrgen Kocka, Sir Nicholas Henderson, Eberhard J√§ckel, Hans Mommsen, Michael St√ºrmer, Joachim Fest, Hagen Schulze, Christian Maier, Wolfgang Mommsen, Hugh Trevor-Roper, Saul Friedl√§nder, Felix Gilbert, Norman Stone, Julius Schoeps, and Charles S. Maier.Thomas, pp. vii‚Äìviii Nolte was invited to the conference, but declined, citing scheduling conflicts. The Israeli historian Samuel Ettinger described Nolte as someone who wrote about Soviet history despite not being a Soviet specialist.Thomas, p. 27 Ettinger went to say about Nolte: > ‚ÄúQuotations from Latsis, who was First Cheka Chief; Tucholsky, the satirist > and journalist, and Theodore Kaufmann (who knows who Theodore Kaufmann was?) > were used as historical sources. Can an assorted collection of this kind > serve as a basis for serious scholarly analysis, the starting point for the > claim that poor Hitler was so frightened by the ‚ÄúAsiatic deeds‚Äù of the > Bolsheviks that he started to exterminate Jewish children? All this without > taking into account the historical development of the relationship between > Germany and the Soviet Union, the military co-operation during the twenties > which as well known to the German General Staff and to Hitler, > Tukhachevsky's speech in 1935 was applauded at a meeting of the General > Staff of Germany for its anti-Western remarks. Then there are the > negotiations between Stalin and Hitler from ‚Äô36 and ‚Äô37 onwards which > brought a rapprochement and led to the dismissal of Jewish diplomats and > other public officials until the division of Poland in 1939‚Äù.Thomas, pp. > 27‚Äì28 The Anglo-American historian of Stalin's terror, Robert Conquest was quoted as saying about Nolte's theories: > ‚ÄúI think we all accept the proposition that Nazi crimes were unique and > uniquely horrible, that they were a reaction against the Communist terrors > seems untenable. It is conceivable that support for the National Socialists > may largely have come as a reaction to Lenin‚Äôs international civil war > launched in 1918, but the actual crimes of the Holocaust are of a totally > different nature from Stalin‚Äôs crimes and I see no connection whatever. But > although there is no causative connection, comparisons can still be > made‚Äù.Thomas, p. 48 Lord Annan was quoted as saying \\"Nolte's article may have been sinister, even malevolent, but we have had a great example of an informed debate, of great heart-searching and of a profound examination of the nature of Germany's past and present\\"‚Äù.Thomas, p. 39 The German historian Julius Schoeps stated: > \\"I would like stress a seminal factor in the Historikerstreit: The > historians who caused this dispute are men in their sixties, that is, men > who were old enough to be in the Hitler Youth, Hitlerjugend; men who were > perhaps soldiers in the war; men for whom the collapse of the Third Reich > turned into a trauma which is inextricably linked to the key terms Holocaust > and Auschwitz. Nolte's reaction is, I think, typical of this generation of > scholars. Contrary to some historians who assert that Germans should not ask > such questions at all, I believe that Germans must ask them. But there is no > need for slanted questions and ambiguous statements which whitewash German > history. Unfortunately, questions of this kind were posed in the > Historikerstreit; such assertions were made. If historians are suggesting > today that Hitler had the right to intern the Jews, they may be tempted to > suggest tomorrow that he had the right to kill the Jews. That is why it is > crucial to discuss such moral, political, ethical lies\\".Thomas, p. 29 During the course of the debate, Eberhard J√§ckel and Joachim Fest again clashed over the question of the \\"singularity\\" of the Holocaust with Fest accusing J√§ckel of presenting a \\"caricature\\" of his opponents.Thomas, p. 87 Writing in 1989, the British historian Richard J. Evans declared that: > \\"Finally, Nolte's attempts to establish the comparability of Auschwitz rest > in part upon an extension of the concept of \\"genocide\\" to actions which > cannot plausibly justify being described in this way. However much one might > wish to criticize the Allied strategic-bombing offensive against German > cities, it cannot be termed genocidal because there was no intention to > exterminate the entire German people. Dresden was bombed after Coventry, not > the other way around, and it is implausible to suggest that the latter was a > response to the former; on the contrary, there was indeed an element of > retaliation and revenge in the strategic bombing offensive, which is > precisely one of the grounds on which it has often been criticized. There is > no evidence to support Nolte's speculation that the ethnic Germans in Poland > would have been entirely exterminated had the Nazis not completed their > invasion quickly.

At this point, it is useful to > recall the conclusion of the German historian and Hitler specialist Eberhard > J√§ckel that \\"the Nazi murder of the Jews was unique because never before had > a state decided and announced, on the authority of its responsible leader, > that it intended to kill in its entirety, as far as possible, a particular > group of human beings, including its old people, women, children and > infants, and then put this decision into action with every possible > instrument of power available to the state\\". > > The attempts undertaken by Nolte, Hillgruber, Fest and other neoconservative > historians to get around this fact are all ultimately unconvincing. It > requires a considerable degree of myopia to regard the policies of the USA > in Vietnam in the 1960s and early 1970s or the occupation of Afghanistan by > the USSR in the 1980s as \\"genocide\\". However much one may deplore the > conduct of the occupying armies, there is no evidence of any deliberate > policy of exterminating the inhabitants of the countries in question. The > terrible massacres of the Armenians by the Turks in 1915 were more > deliberate, on a wider scale and concentrated into a far shorter time, then > the destruction of human life in Vietnam and Afghanistan, and they were not > carried out as part of a military campaign, although they did occur in > wartime. But these atrocities were committed as part of a brutal policy of > expulsion and resettlement; they did not constitute an attempt to > exterminate a whole people. Similar things may be said of the forcible > removal of Greeks from Asia Minor during the 1920s, although this has not, > in contrast to the events of 1915, generally been regarded as genocide. > > The Pol Pot regime in Cambodia witnessed the horrific spectacle of a > nation's rulers turning upon their own people, in a manner comparable to > that of the Ugandan dictator Idi Amin a few years previously. The victims, > whose numbers exceeded a million, were killed, not on racial grounds, but as > part of a deliberate policy of terror to subdue opposition and revenge > against those thought to have collaborated with the American enemy during > the previous hostilities. Moreover, the barbarities inflicted on the > Cambodian people by the Pol Pot regime were to a considerable extent the > result of a brutalizing process that had accompanied a terrible war, during > which vast quantities of bombs were dropped on the country, destroying a > large part of the moral and physical basis of Cambodian society in the > process. This in no way excuses the murderous policies of the Khmer Rouge. > But it does show up, once more, the contrast with the Nazi genocide of the > Jews, which, as we have seen, was a gratuitous act carried out by a > prosperous, advanced industrial nation at the height of its power.\\".Evans, > pp. 85‚Äì87 Evans criticized Nolte for crediting the remark about the Armenian genocide as an \\"Asiatic deed\\" to Scheubner-Richter, when in fact, it came from a 1938 biography of Scheubner-Richter.Evans, p. 35 Moreover, Evans maintained that there is no evidence to support Nolte's claim that because Max Scheubner- Richter was opposed to the Armenian genocide, that proved that Hitler thought the same way in 1915. Citing Mein Kampf, Evans argued that Hitler was an anti- Semitic long before 1914 and that it was the moderate left SPD, not the Bolsheviks that Hitler regarded as his main enemiesEvans, pp. 35‚Äì36 Nolte's opponents have expressed intense disagreement with his evidence for a Jewish \\"war\\" on Germany. They argue that Weizmann's letter to Chamberlain was written in his capacity as head of the World Zionist Organization, not on behalf of the entire Jewish people of the world,Evans, p. 38 and that Nolte's views are based on the spurious idea that all Jews comprised a distinct \\"nationality\\" who take their marching orders from Jewish organizations. Lipstadt criticized Nolte's thesis on the grounds that first, Weizmann had no army in 1939 to wage ‚Äúwar‚Äù against Germany with, and that Nolte had totally ignored the previous six years of Nazi persecution of the Jews, making it sound like as if Weizmann had struck a low blow against Germany for no apparent reason in 1939. Furthermore, it has been contended that there is no evidence that Hitler ever heard of Weizmann's letter to Chamberlain, and that it was natural for Weizmann, a British Jew, to declare his support for his country against a fiercely anti-Semitic regime.Lukacs, John The Hitler of History New York: Vintage Books, 1997, 1998 pp. 180‚Äì181 As for Kaufman's book, the Nazis were certainly aware of it; during the war, Germany Must Perish! was translated into German and widely promoted as an example of what Jews thought about Germans. But most historians contended that the radical views of one American Jew can in no way be taken as typical of what all European Jews were thinking, and to put the call for the forced sterilization of Germans that was never carried out as Allied policy in the same league as the Holocaust shows a profound moral insensitivity.Vidal-Naquet, Pierre Assassins of Memory, New York: Columbia University Press, 1992 p. 126 Moreover, it has been shown that there is no indication that Kaufman's book ever played any role in the decision-making process that led to the Holocaust. Finally, it has been contended that Nolte's comparison of the Holocaust with the internment of Japanese Americans is false, because the Jews of Europe were sent to death camps rather than internment camps, and the U.S. government did not attempt to exterminate the Japanese Americans in the internment camps.Evans, pp. 38‚Äì39 Later views The British historian Norman Davies argued in 2006 that revelations made after the fall of Communism in Eastern Europe after 1989‚Äì91 about Soviet crimes had discredited the left-wing position taken in the 1980s during the Historikerstreit debate.

Euhemerus describes this place as home to a society made up of a number of different ethnic tribes and his trip there in his major work Sacred History, only fragments of which survive. Fragments preserved by followers such as the later Greek historian Diodorus Siculus and 4th century AD Christian writer Eusebius of Caesarea describe Panchaia as a rational island paradise located in the Indian Ocean. Euhemerus went there by traveling through the Red Sea and around the Arabian Peninsula; in the island's temple of Zeus Triphylius he discovered a register of the births and deaths of the gods, proving they were merely historical figures. The island is also mentioned by Lygdamus (Tib. 3.2.23), one of the Tibullan elegists, as a rich place from which he will hope for gifts to his grave. Virgil called the Island \\"incense bearing, rich with sands\\" (\\"totaque turiferis Panchaia pinguis harenis\\" Georgics 2.139).

At its greatest extent, it ruled much of present- day western and northern Iran.  Origins  The dynasty was descended from Vardanshah, leader of the Shahanshahvand tribe, which traced its descent back to the legendary king Arghush Farhadan, who was the ruler of Gilan, and lived during the time of Kai Khosrow. Vardanshah had a son named Ziyar, who married a sister of the Gilaki king Harusindan, who bore him a son named Mardavij. Mardavij later served another Gilaki military leader named Asfar ibn Shiruya, but later betrayed the latter and conquered Tabaristan, which led to the foundation of the Ziyarid dynasty, which he named after his father.  History  Mardavij then began aggressively expanding his territories, killing Asfar and capturing several important cities in Iran, such as Hamadan, Dinavar, Kashan, Isfahan, Shiraz and Ahvaz from the Abbasids.\\"Ziyarids\\", C.E. Bosworth, Encyclopaedia Iranica, (October 1, 2010). He further planned to restore the Sasanian Empire through conquering Baghdad and ousting the Abbasid Caliphate, but was instead murdered in 935. After Mardavij's death, his brother and general Vushmgir was crowned as the new Ziyarid ruler in Ray. Hasan ibn Buya, one of the brothers of the Buyid ruler Ali ibn Buya, took advantage of Mardavij's death by seizing Isfahan from Ziyarid rule. The Samanids also took advantage of the opportunity, but were defeated by Vushmgir, who then wrested Gorgan from Samanid control. However, Vushmgir soon decided to acknowledge Samanid supremacy, and in 936 he also turned over Gorgan to Makan.Nazim (1987), pp. 164‚Äì165Madelung (1975), p. 213 Turning against Hasan, he retook Isfahan in 938. In 939 or 940 the Samanid governor Abu 'Ali Chaghani attacked Gorgan; Vushmgir sent Makan aid, but the city fell after a long siege. Abu 'Ali Chaghani then engaged Vushmgir in battle in Ray and defeated him, killing Makan in the process. Vushmgir fled to Tabaristan, but was faced there with a revolt by his governor of Sari, al-Hasan ibn al-Fairuzan, who was a cousin of Makan and blamed the Ziyarid for his death. Vushmgir defeated him, but al- Hasan convinced Abu 'Ali Chaghani to invade Tabaristan. Vushmgir was forced to recognize Samanid authority again. Hasan furthered the Ziyarid's troubles by retaking Isfahan in 940. When Abu 'Ali Chaghani left for Samanid Khurasan, Vushmgir retook control of Ray. He then lost it for good in 943, to the Buyid Hasan. Returning to Tabaristan, he was defeated there by al-Hasan, who had previously occupied Gorgan. Vushmgir fled to the Bavandids of the mountains in eastern Tabaristan, then to the court of the Samanid Nuh I. Al-Hasan meanwhile allied with Hasan, but when Ibn Muthaj took Ray from the Buyids in 945, he recognized Samanid authority. Still, in 945 Vushmgir captured Gorgan with Samanid support, but did not manage to retain his rule there. It was only in 947 when he was able to take Gorgan and Tabaristan from al-Hasan with the help of a large Samanid army. In 948 Hasan (who since the Buyids' entrance into Baghdad in 945 had used the title Rukn al-Dawla) invaded Tabaristan and Gorgan and took them from Vushmgir. While al-Hasan supported the Buyids, Vushmgir relied on his Samanid allies. Tabaristan and Gorgan changed hands several times until 955, when in a treaty with the Samanids, Rukn al-Daula promised to leave Vushmgir alone in Tabaristan. Peace between the two sides did not last long, however; in 958 Vushmgir briefly occupied Ray, which was Rukn al-Dawla's capital. Rukn al-Dawla later made a counter-attack, temporarily taking Gorgan in 960, then taking both Tabaristan and Gorgan for a short time in 962. He may have also taken Tabaristan and Gorgan in 966, but did not hold on to them for long.\\"The Minor Dynasties of Northern Iran\\", C.E. Bosworth, The Cambridge History of Iran, Vol. 4, ed. W. Madelung, (Cambridge University Press, 1975), 214. Vushmgir was killed by a boar during a hunt in 967, shortly after a Samanid army had arrived for a joint campaign against the Buyids. He was succeeded by his eldest son Bisutun; however, the Samanid army favored another son, Qabus, and challenged Bisutun's rule. Bisutun then agreed with Rukn al- Dawla to become his vassal in return for protection against the Samanids, which forced the Samanid army to withdraw to Khorasan. In 971, the Abbasid caliph al-Muti gave Bisutun the title of Zahir al-Dawla. Bisutun later died in 977, and was succeeded by Qabus. However, he was expelled by the Buyid ruler Adud al-Dawla in 980, because he gave refuge to the latter's rival and brother Fakhr al-Dawla. The Buyids now dominated Tabaristan over 17 years while Qabus was in exile in Khorasan. In 998, Qabus returned to Tabaristan and re- established his authority there. He then established good relations with the Ghaznavid ruler Mahmud of Ghazni who had taken control of Khorasan, but still acted as an independent sovereign. During the reign of Qabus, his kingdom was a major attraction to scholars; Abu Rayhan Biruni, the great scientist of the Middle Ages, was supported by Qabus. In fact he dedicated his work Chronology to Qabus around 1000 and observed eclipses of the moon in his capital of Gorgan.\\"The Exact Sciences\\", E.S. Kennedy, The Cambridge History of Iran: The period from the Arab invasion to the Saljuqs, Vol. 4, 394. Due to his tyrannical rule, Qabus was overthrown by his own army in 1012, and was succeeded by his son Manuchihr, who quickly recognized the sovereignty of Mahmud of Ghazni, and married one of his daughters. Manuchihr died in 1031, and was succeeded by his son Anushirvan Sharaf al-Ma'ali whom Mahmud of Ghazni had chosen as the heir of the Ziyarid dynasty. From 1032 to 1040, the real power behind the throne was held by Abu Kalijar ibn Vayhan, a relative of Anushirvan. In 1035, Abu Kalijar stopped paying tribute to the Ghaznavids; the Ghaznavids invaded Tabaristan and sacked the Ziyarid capital, Amol.The Ghaznavids, C.E. Bosworth, History of Civilizations of Central Asia, Vol.IV, part 1, ed. M.S. Asimov, C.E. Bosworth, (Motilal Banarsidass Publishers, 1997), 107. Abu Kalijar, after having learned the consequences of not paying tribute to the Ghaznavids, agreed to continue paying tribute. This gave Anushirvan the opportunity to imprison Abu Kalijar and gain a firm grip over his kingdom. In 1041/1042, the Seljuqs, now the new masters of Khorasan, invaded Anushirvan's domains, which forced him to accept their authority. Anushirvan died in 1059 and was succeeded by his cousin Keikavus, the celebrated author of the Qabus nama, a major work of Persian literature. Keikavus died in 1087, and was succeeded by his son Gilanshah. Gilanshah's reign, was, however, short; in 1090, the Nizari Ismaili state under Hassan-i Sabbah invaded and conquered his domains, which ended Ziyarid rule in Tabaristan. Art and architecture One of the most famous architectural works of the Ziyarid dynasty is the Gonbad Kavous (meaning the \\"Dome of Qabus\\"). The tomb is one of the earliest architectural monuments with a dated inscription surviving in post-Islamic Iran. The tomb, built of fired brick, is an enormous cylinder capped by a conical roof. The circular plan, broken by 10 flanges, is 17 m in diameter, and the walls are 3 m thick. The height from base to tip is 49 m. Legend has it, that the body of Qabus was enclosed in a glass coffin which was suspended by chains from the interior dome inside the tower.

It was located where Peachtree Creek flows into the Chattahoochee River, in today's Paces neighborhood. It was located in the borderlands of the Cherokee and Creek nations. It is referred to in several documents dating as far back as 1762.Franklin M. Garrett, Atlanta and Environs, pp. 8ff. Etymology Standing Peachtree's name is an accurate preservation of its native Creek Indian name, Pakanahuili. Some sources claim that \\"peachtree\\" is a corruption of \\"pitch tree\\", a supposed reference to pine trees from which pitch could be obtained. However, there is no evidence for the \\"pitch tree\\" name from before the 20th century, while \\"Standing Peachtree\\" can be traced back to the 18th century. Peachtree Street Standing Peachtree was the end of the Creek Peachtree Trail, which ran from near Toccoa to just south of what is now Piedmont Hospital in Buckhead. (A marker now stands there at the corner of Peachtree St. and Palisades Rd.) At this junction the path split. One branch went to Standing Peachtree (Pace's Ferry and Moore's Mill roads were built along this path). The other branch ran southwards towards what is now Five Points in Downtown Atlanta. Thus, much of Atlanta's main street, Peachtree Street follows the earlier Indian path. Fort Peachtree Fort Peachtree was built here in 1812. Later known as Fort Gilmer, it was connected to Fort Daniel at Hog Mountain in what is now Gwinnett County, by a path which came to be known as Old Peachtree Road. The Creek ceded the land that is now Metro Atlanta in 1821 as part of the systematic removal of Indians from Georgia. Standing Peachtree thus ceased its role as Indian trading post. It was established as the first post office in the newly established Dekalb County, preceding Decatur (the area would later become part of Fulton County). Montgomery's Ferry (later DeFoor's Ferry) across the river opened at Standing Peachtree in 1837 and the area soon became better known by that name. The post office closed in 1842.

It was designed as one of 20 munitions filling factories. It was planned as a Permanent ROF with the intention that, unlike some other similar facilities, it would remain open for production after the end of World War II. After privatisation of the Royal Ordnance Factories in the 1980s it became part of Royal Ordnance plc and later a production unit of BAE Systems. It was served by the Great Western Railway's Coleford, Monmouth, Usk and Pontypool Railway from its opening in April 1940 until 1993.Stanley C Jenkins, The Ross, Monmouth and Pontypool Road Line, revised second edition 2009,  Early history  In the late 1930s leading up to the outbreak of war in 1939, the British government developed a strategy to disperse armaments and munitions production away from major cities and the southeast part of England which were felt to be especially vulnerable to bombing from the air. As a result the Ministry of Supply built a number of Royal Ordnance Factories and satellite factories. A munitions-filling factory was sited at Glascoed in a valley between Pontypool and Usk in Monmouthshire. The site was chosen for its seclusion and sheltered topography surrounded by hills and its damp micro-climate was suited for the handling of explosives. Mostly agricultural land was acquired by compulsory purchase. In addition, the large workforce needed would benefit a region of the UK hit by particularly heavy unemployment in the 1930s Great Depression. The new factory was designed at The Royal Arsenal, Woolwich (Woolwich Arsenal), based on its long experience in munitions production. Safety considerations were paramount. The design, style and spacing of individual production buildings meant that they were separated by wide open spaces as well as approx 20 feet (6 m) high grassed embankments and extremely thick reinforced concrete walls and overbridges, called traverses. The purpose of these earthworks was to deflect any explosion skyward rather than outward to any adjacent buildings or structures. The site was built with extensive underground magazines, comprehensive lightning protection and individual buildings linked by paths, roads and railways. Building work on the 1,000 acre (4 km¬≤) site started in February 1938, with the Ministry of Works acting as Agents; and was undertaken by a construction company from Cardiff. The factory was officially opened in April 1940 and full production was achieved in 1941-1942.  World War II and Korean War activity  At its peak, ROF Glascoed boasted nearly 700 separate buildings, each designated for a particular process and used as required. It still has in excess of 10 miles (16 km) of roads, an 8-mile (13-kilometre) perimeter fence and, until more recent years, its own 17 mile (27 km) standard gauge railway system. This included a dedicated passenger station and freight marshalling yards. It was linked to the Great Western Railway (GWR) branch line that ran between Pontypool Road and Monmouth. This rail link enabled the three-times daily movement of up to 13,000 workers in and out of the site as well as the receipt of raw materials and components and the despatch of finished munitions. A small housing estate was built close-by to accommodate managers and staff who had to respond quickly in emergencies. Initially it was intended that ROF Glascoed would produce sea-mines for the Royal Navy. However as well as these, heavy bombs and pyrotechnics (such as target indicators and skymarkers) were supplied to the RAF. Among the weapons filled and assembled by ROF Glascoed were the bouncing bomb, designed by Barnes Wallis and delivered to the Ruhr area of Germany by the Dambusters, RAF 617 squadron. Contemporary ARP planning was largely based on Stanley Baldwin's assertion that \\"the bomber will always get through\\". So, near Glascoed, the local Folly Tower on a hill top at nearby Pontypool was seen as an aiming-off point for the Luftwaffe to attack the ROF factory. The Tower was demolished at the start of the war and not rebuilt until 1994 when it became a minor tourist attraction. As it was, ROF Glascoed was bombed only twice during the war. On one occasion, a worker was killed and several injured by a lone bomber which caused minor damage. Post-war debriefing records show that the bomber's crew were convinced they had bombed Filton aerodrome in Bristol, some forty miles (65 km) away. As demand for weapons and ammunition declined with the end of the war, many Royal Ordnance Factories were closed. ROF Glascoed was retained and supplemented its output by manufacturing concrete building products and by scrapping surplus munitions. The growing hostility of the Cold War as evidenced by the Korean War saw a much wider range of munitions filled, assembled and packed at ROF Glascoed. These included munitions for field guns and howitzers, tanks and other fighting vehicles, mortar and aerial bombs, warheads for missiles and torpedoes, flares, pyrotechnics and smoke bombs.  Post-war survival  The Royal Ordnance Factories were part of a government department until they were privatised in 1987. Today Glascoed is operated by BAE Systems Global Combat Systems Munitions. With the closure of other ROFs, Glascoed remains the only ammunition filling facility in the UK and exports its products, as well as supplying the British Ministry of Defence (MoD). Glascoed now employs about 400 people and has invested heavily in R&D; and improved production facilities. In recent years, Glascoed has developed an expertise with Insensitive MunitionsInsensitive Munitions (IM) in artillery shells and other warheads. These employ PBX compositions such as Rowanex 3601 (booster) and Rowanex 1100 (main charge) designed to minimise the risk of accidents e.g. inadvertent detonation by dropping, heat, friction or impact. One such accident occurred on the USS Forrestal in 1967.USS Forrestal The Tragic Fire - July 29, 1967 Until the mid-1990s, in the interests of security, British Ordnance Survey maps omitted the details of all operational ROF sites; the maps showed the sites as they existed before the ROFs' construction, although it was sometimes possible to identify the site boundaries. More recent editions show the detail of the buildings, internal roads, and rail links, labelled simply as \\"Depot\\" or \\"Works\\". On the 20 August 2008 the Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom) announced a 15 year ¬£2bn contract with BAE Systems to supply British forces with medium calibre and small arms ammunition.BAE in ¬£2bn MoD ammunition deal See also *Royal Ordnance ReferencesExternal links *BAE Systems home page Glascoed Category:Buildings and structures in Monmouthshire Glascoed ","title":"ROF Glascoed"},{"id":"1494935","text":"See also: 1891 in organized crime, other events of 1892, 1893 in organized crime and the list of 'years in Organized Crime'.

Since their inception, the group went through numerous lineups, including four ex-drummers. Its final roster included Monty Carlo (Colin Hickey), The Count (Chris Knudson), Cap'n Sextastic (Jake Morton), and Joe Danger (Joe Brennan). The group was based out of Missoula, Montana and was a staple at the Northwest nightclub Jay's Upstairs during the early 2000s. Upon its closing, The International Playboys dedicated more time to their touring act, which crossed North America several times a year. The band played their final show before parting ways on August 2, 2007.  Biography  The International Playboys were a fusion of classic rock 'n roll, 80s acid jams, jarring vocals, and stage showmanship. The band was well known for their wild presence, sweaty dimestore suits, and the wild unkempt hair of lead vocalist Monty Carlo, who was referred to by critics as \\"Joe Cocker, punk rocker\\". The International Playboys released three studio albums. Their debut, First Album (2002), was given \\"props for their blend of unibrow Van Halen-meets-Candy Snatchers bad- boy rock\\" in a 2003 issue of Maximumrocknroll. SLUG Magazine called it \\"a skull-fracturing heap of primitive rock n‚Äô roll comparable to James Brown on crack fronting a hyperactive band raised on Chuck Berry and The Ramones.\\" The band's second album, Sexiful (2004), was described in a Punk Planet review as \\"irresponsibly entertaining music that once outraged parents.\\" Cobra Blood Hangover, released in 2006, was compared by Allmusic's Stewart Mason to such bands as the Darkness, Jet, and Wolfmother. Mason remarked that three albums into the band's career, their \\"tongue-in-cheek celebration of '70s boogie raunch\\" had not yet gotten old. A review in Maximumrocknroll stated that the album's music has \\"lots of deep end, unexpected tempo changes, and a lyrical sense of the absurd.\\" In 2004, the band starred in the short musical film Ghouls Gone Wild!, which fictionally chronicled their grave misadventures while on tour. After taking a wrong turn, the band ended up stranded in a haunted ghost town, attacked by its ghoulish residents. In 2006, The Playboys were named Pabst Blue Ribbon's Montana Band of the Year and were signed to Australian Cattle God Records.  Touring and Beyond  *The band took part in several cross-country tours, playing alongside such groups as Japan's Guitar Wolf, Captured by Robots, NoMeansNo, Ghoultown, The Fireballs of Freedom, Volumen, and The Spiders. In August 2012 the band played an epic reunion show in Missoula during a citywide music festival.

Collision and loss On 21 October 1981, S-178, under the command of Captain Third Rank V.A. Marango, was transiting on the surface at , returning to base after two days of sound trials. The sea state was 2 (less than one- metre waves) and night time visibility was unlimited. The starboard diesel was under repair, so the propulsion plant was aligned port diesel, starboard electric motor. For convenience, the diesel mechanics and electricians had opened the watertight doors between compartments. In addition, the cooks had opened other watertight doors so that they could serve dinner. At 19:30 local time, S-178 received permission to save time by entering Golden Horn Bay, in downtown Vladivostok, through a combat training range. The port officer who granted that permission had just assumed the watch, and was unaware that the off-going watch officer had granted similar permission to the refrigerated stores vessel RFS Refrizherator-13 to leave Golden Horn Bay through the combat training range. Watchmen on RFS-13 noticed navigation lights which they took to be a fishing trawler. At about the same time, the pilot of RFS-13 noted a contact on radar which was showing decreasing range and zero bearing rate, indicating a collision course. On S-178, sonar reported detection of another vessel, but that report was lost in the relaxed atmosphere prevailing on the submarine after dinner. Nautical \\"rules of the road\\" and the rules of navigation in Vladivostok port agree that the ship should yield the right-of- way to the submarine; however, master V.F. Kurdyukov of RFS-13 chose not to alter course. The lookouts on S-178 did not spot RFS-13's running lights against the background of the lights of Vladivostok until the ship was upon them. The captain gave the orders \\"hard right rudder\\" and \\"Signalman, illuminate that vessel\\", but too late to have any effect. At 19:45 Refrizherator-13 struck S-178 at an angle of 20‚Äì30 degrees on the port side of the sixth compartment at a speed of , tearing a hole about two square metres in area. The sixth compartment flooded completely in 15 to 20 seconds. The boat rolled sharply, throwing the 11 men on the bridge into the water. The inrushing water made it impossible to close the watertight doors between the sixth, fifth, and fourth compartments. Approximately 40 seconds after the collision, S-178 had taken on about 130 tons of water, and sank. She hit bottom, rolled 28 degrees to starboard, in 31 meters of water. Eighteen men died immediately. The 26 survivors in the forward compartments were unable to stop the flooding of the third compartment, so retreated into the first and second compartments about half an hour after the wreck. Four men were trapped in the seventh compartment, including the Chief of Staff of the submarine brigade Captain Second Rank V.Y. Karavekov. When leakage into the seventh compartment reached 15 tons an hour, Karavekov made the decision to escape from that compartment and make a free ascent to the surface. However, they could not open the escape trunk's top hatch. It transpired later that they had not equalized the pressure across the hatch. Four hours later, communications with the seventh compartment ended. On the surface, RFS-13 rescued seven of the 11 men thrown from the bridge and at 19:57 informed the port authorities of the accident. At 20:15 search and rescue forces were alerted, and steam ships Zhigulis and Mashuk, and the Project 940 Lenok rescue submarine BS-480 Komsomolets Uzbekistan had arrived at the scene of the accident. At 21:00 the crew of RFS-13 located the emergency buoy from S-178. At 21:50 salvage ships arrived at the scene. Vice-Admiral Golosov commanded salvage operations. Beginning at 08:45 on 22 October, Komsomolets Uzbekistan began attempting to rescue the trapped crew, but locating the sunken submarine took about 17 hours. The rescue submarine dived three times, without success. Divers finally reached S-178 on 23 October at 03:03. By this time, the trapped crew had despaired of rescue and had begun attempting free ascents. At 20:30 on 23 October, Captain Lieutenant Kubynin, the senior officer among the survivors, was the last of the crew to leave S-178. Three men who reached the surface later died, and three others who left the boat were never found on the surface; it is possible they came up under maneuvering ships and were killed by their screws. Their loss brought the death toll to 31 men. On 24 October work began to raise the sunken boat. First, pontoons lifted her up to a depth of 15 meters and she was towed into shallow water. Divers then removed the bodies of the victims. On 15 November 1981 S-178 was raised. After her torpedoes were removed, she was dry docked. Repair was deemed impractical, and she was stricken. Her commander, Captain Third Rank Marango, and Kurdyukov, the master of RFS-13, were both sentenced to ten years' imprisonment.

The Washington Crossing State Park, dedicated to George Washington's crossing of the Delaware River in 1776, is adjacent to the community. History Titusville's central feature is a small village that sits on a bluff overlooking a picturesque stretch of the Delaware River with stairwells connecting the village to private docks on the river. The Feeder Canal for the Delaware and Raritan Canal runs parallel to the river just to the east of the village, which is connected to River Road (Route 29) by several two-lane bridges. A biking/walking trail follows the canal, constructed when the former Belvidere-Delaware Railroad line was removed in the early 1980s. Opposite the canal from the river, extending eastward, are a number of small residential streets, a county park centered about Baldpate Mountain, and the homes ringing the base of the mountain and county park. Titusville is just north of the Johnson Ferry House in adjacent Washington Crossing, the scene of George Washington's crossing of the Delaware River during the American Revolution. In 1831, the ferry was replaced by the Washington Crossing Bridge, linking it with Washington Crossing in Pennsylvania. Titusville is home to Janssen Pharmaceuticals Inc., a division of Johnson and Johnson. In 1851, the Belvidere-Delaware Railroad opened to Titusville and a station was built in the town. Passenger service ceased at Titusville in April 1952 but passenger trains to other towns continued operating until October 1960. Freight continued to run on this portion of the line until 1976. Track was subsequently removed for the Delaware & Raritan Canal State Park recreational trail in the early 1980s. Historic district The Titusville Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places on March 17, 1983 for its significance in architecture, industry, religion, and transportation. It includes 100 contributing buildings. With Geography The town is bisected by state New Jersey Route 29, a busy road that conveys traffic along the Delaware River. Washington Crossing State Park is an 800-acre (3.2 km2) tract of woods, fields, and streams. The park covers the gradual slope from Bear Tavern Road down to Delaware River.

Though Miller was not known for his humor, this play uses a pointed comedic edge to intensify his observations about the dangers, as well as the benefits, of blind belief: political, religious, economic and emotional. Plot The story is set in an unnamed Latin American country that is painfully third world. The plot revolves around a captured prisoner who may or may not be the second coming of Christ, though Miller deliberately leaves the divinity of his unseen protagonist ambiguous. He is said to be able to perform miracles such as walk through walls, a major problem for the prison guards, and, because of his popularity among the impoverished citizens, the military dictator of the nation has sentenced him to be crucified. This creates many moral dilemmas with the play's cast of characters, which include a wealthy land-owner who is the cousin of the dictator, his depressed daughter‚Äîa close friend of the accused‚Äîand an American television production team that arrives to broadcast the crucifixion.  Characters  The plot has six central characters: * General Felix Barriaux - the dictator of the country who orders the crucifixion. For a dictator, he is a poignant and witty character who holds some sympathy for the audience despite his obsession with money and power. He has been played by actors ranging from Munson Hicks to Maximilian Schell. * Henri Schultz - cousin to Felix and owns a large chain of pharmaceutical companies, but is reluctant to be a businessman and retires to teach philosophy. He once joined a revolutionary group to fight against Felix but it was unsuccessful. Ironically there is still a familial bond of friendship between Felix and himself and he spends the play trying to dissuade Felix from the crucifixion. He has been played by James Fox to Patrick Husted. * Jeanine Schultz - daughter of Henri, she is a modern form of Mary Magdalen as she is in love with the man about to be crucified and opens the play having tried to commit suicide. She too was caught up with the revolution but when her father gave up, she held on to the spirit her comrades were shot by Felix when they were captured, but she was spared. She has been played by Patricia Ageheim to Neve Campbell. * Skip L. Cheesboro - the producer of the American television special that is to be made about the crucifixion. He is a no-nonsense man who, in his own words, admits that \\"some of us have to be shallow so others can be deep.\\" He has been played by Doug Wert to Matthew Modine. * Emily Shapiro - the TV special's director who is, at the beginning of the play, unaware of the crucifixion. It is suggested that a relationship with Skip may have existed but when she finds out about the crucifixion, she is shocked and repulsed by Skip for even suggesting filming it. She then has a relationship with Felix whom she begs to call off the crucifixion. She is seen to be the voice of reason within the play and has been played by Gretchen Egolf to Jane Adams. * Stanley - a disciple to the prisoner and is interrogated by Felix when he escapes. A self-proclaimed hippie, he addresses the approachability of 'Christ' saying that he himself in unsure whether he is Christ or not. He produces a lot of wit at the same time as introducing new ideas. He has been played by Douglas Rees to Peter McDonald. Other characters include the filming crew, an omnipresent military and the captain of the police who is respectful of Henri Schultz because of his wealth.  Production history  There was originally a reading that Jerry Zaks directed so that Miller could see what he had. The cast included Nathan Lane as Felix Barreaux, Bill Murray as Skip Cheeseboro, Julia-Louis Dreyfus as Emily, and Richard Libertini.  World premiere in Minneapolis  Resurrection Blues originally premiered August 9, 2002, at the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis, Minnesota, under the artistic direction of Joe Dowling. This world premiere was directed by Minnesota native David Esbjornson. The cast featured John Bedford Lloyd as General Felix Barreaux, Jeff Weiss, and Laila Robins.Gans, Andrew. \\"Lloyd, Weiss and Robins Cast in Guthrie's Miller Premiere, 'Resurrection Blues'\\" playbill.com, June 27, 2002 Arthur Miller chose the Guthrie Theater for the play's debut, citing the quality of its audiences and the outdatedness of premiering a play on Broadway.Combs, Marianne. \\"Arthur Miller premiers play in Minnesota\\" Minnesota Public Radio, July 3, 2002, accessed April 8, 2016 Miller continued to work on the script up until his death in 2005 although the Minneapolis production of the original script fared far better than the later production at the Old Vic in London. Philadelphia The East Coast premiere of Resurrection Blues debuted at the Wilma Theater in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on September 2, 2003. The production was directed by Jiri Zizka. The cast featured Munson Hicks, Patrick Husted, Lindsay Smiling, Gretchen Egolf, Doug Wert, William Zielinski, Miriam A. Hyman, Patricia Ageheim, Douglas Rees, Jennifer A.

Despite eyewitness accounts of his human form, he may be divine or at least an inspired figment of the imagination, Miller suggests. He must decide whether to be crucified or to disappear. This is an interesting tangent, but it further removes the play from the nitty-gritty of the political realities that drove Miller to write. His continuing sense of adventure at age 88 is awe- inspiring, but the play itself isn't.\\" Miller worked with the director and cast through the rehearsal process to find a more straightforward message than in the previous production.  London  The UK premiere was in March 2006 under the artistic direction of Kevin Spacey at the Old Vic. The play was directed by Robert Altman. The play suffered mass criticism despite boasting a \\"distinguished\\" cast that included James Fox, Maximilian Schell, Jane Adams (Emily) and Neve Campbell. It was forced to close early especially after the actress playing Emily (the American film director) left the production. Spacey said the cast suffered from \\"nerves the like of which I've never seen\\". Charles Spencer, reviewing for The Telegraph noted that \\"Miller was apparently revising the play right up to his death last year, after two earlier drafts had flopped in the States.\\"Spencer, Charles. \\"A Miller‚Äôs tale that‚Äôs beyond resurrection\\" The Telegraph, 3 March 2006 The New York Times reviewer observed: \\"Between the relentless public attention and the sometimes scathing reviews, Kevin Spacey has had a rough year and a half as artistic director at the Old Vic Theater. But nothing was so disastrous as the debacle surrounding 'Resurrection Blues,' a star-laden production that drew horrendous reviews and closed a week early this spring, just in time for the announcement that the theater would go dark until September.\\"Lyall, Sarah. \\"Beyond a Sea of Criticism, All's Well for Kevin Spacey at Old Vic\\" The New York Times, May 29, 2006  Actors' fund reading  An independent theatre company called Fancy Bred Theatre produced a special reading of Resurrection Blues as a fundraiser for the Actors' Fund of Canada, in February 2009, in Winnipeg, Canada. The reading was staged in a very physically animated style, and it ran for three nights before 180 people. The production, featuring many well-known professional local artists, focused mainly on the comedy and absurdities of the script. Audience reception was overall very positive, and the production was a great success. Some audience members even mentioned that the wordy script worked much better in a reading than in a fully mounted show. The reading was directed by Rodrigo Beilfuss. The cast included Sarah Constible, Michelle Boulet, Omar Khan, Toby Hughes, James Johnston, and Cory Wojcik. Chicago  The Eclipse Theatre Company produced the Chicago debut of Resurrection Blues as part of its 2010 season, which focused on Arthur Miller. Eclipse Theatre, known for its \\"one playwright, one season\\" approach, also mounted After the Fall and A Memory of Two Mondays.

In 1985, he was The Three Johns' sound engineer for their first American tour; a recording of their Chicago performance has been released as Live in Chicago. As a member of the Jelly Bishops, he collaborated with Langford and John Hyatt, releasing the album Kings of Barstool Mountain (1988). He and Langford appear in Gary Lucas's 1993 video, \\"Skin the Rabbit,\\" and they share song-writing credits for \\"On the Streets,\\" featured on The Return of Rico Bell (1996). Greenhalgh has also performed on the Langford- organised Pine Valley Cosmonauts albums, contributing a cover of Hank Williams's \\"Angel of Death\\" to 2003's anti-death penalty benefit, The Executioner's Last Songs Vol. 2 & 3\\\\. His guitar (and Langford's vocals) can be heard on fellow-Mekon Sally Timms's \\"Corporal Chalkie\\" from her 2004 album, In the World of Him. On 13 June 2007, Greenhalgh's new band King Tommy's Velvet Runway d√©buted in London. This band features Therese Daniell on keyboards and guitar, Tam McGibbon on banjo, John Langley on drums and Meiling Daniell-Greenhalgh on vocals and violin. The band's first album, Dance on the Volcano, saw a special limited edition release in 2007. Independent projects With Kevin Lycett, Steve Goulding, and John Gill, Greenhalgh has also been a member of Edward II and the Red Hot Polkas, appearing on Let's Polkasteady (1987) and Two Step to Heaven (1989). With Lycett and Robert Worby, he participated in Leeds Metropolitan University's A Christmas Pudding for Henry (1999) with the mecity multimedia project. Since around 1991, he and Worby have collaborated on Plate, recording yet-unreleased experimental electronic music. With fellow-Mekon Sarah Corina, he has recorded some songs on ukuleles and banjoleles, a sample (\\"Lowlands of Holland\\") of which was heard on ResonanceFM's Clear Spot in 2002, a program that also featured Lu Edmonds. Greenhalgh produced Michelle Shocked's cover of the Beatles' \\"Lovely Rita\\" for the compilation Sgt. Pepper Knew My Father (1988). He also produced Mush's second album, Face in Space (1998). In 1998, he worked on a remix with the Knights of the Occasional Table. In 2000, Curve guitarist Alex Mitchell and he (as DJ Sparky Lightbourne and DJ Tommy Tomtom) appeared at the Foundry in Shoreditch. At one time, Greenhalgh was also a part-time art instructor. Intensely private and cheeky, Greenhalgh has managed to downplay his contributions to the art and music communities for much of his career. Following a move from his long-time residence in London to Somerset, he relocated to Hong Kong between 2003 and 2005, and is rumoured to have since returned to England.

Before adopting the name Akimbo, the company also operated under a number of other names including StaticTV and Blue Falcon Networks.  Company  Based out of San Mateo California, the company employed approximately 80 people at its peak. It was founded by Steve Shannon, a former executive of ReplayTV, a TiVo competitor that was to become a unit of D&M; Holdings, and is now owned by DirecTV.  History  Akimbo had released a software version of its on-demand system that ran on any computer running Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005. The software version was compatible with media center extenders such as the Xbox and Xbox 360. The service was initially announced in February 2004, when Akimbo demonstrated its product at the Demo 2004 conference in Scottsdale, Arizona. It was launched in October 2004, and signed on with Amazon as their official retailer. Initial reactions were mixed, with criticisms of high prices of unknown content being levelled at it, although the user interface was regarded as intuitive and responsive. From December 2004, AT&T; Homezone began to offer some of Akimbo video content through its set top boxes, a result of a partnership deal inspired by AT&T;'s deep investments in the company. Akimbo had also released its new RCA Akimbo Player which was a set top box that offers up to 100 hours of recording and was connected to the Akimbo Video On Demand Service. On August 1, 2007, Akimbo finalized the dissemination of its Video on Demand service. On June 2, 2008, Akimbo went out of business.  Criticism  With the initial launch of the service, complaints were rampant regarding the cost of the set-top-box (about $300), and then the added cost for users to purchase video content. Users would be able to buy or rent video content which would then be downloaded to their player for viewing. Akimbo would purchase the rights to provide content from content providers, then allow the content providers to set the cost of their content. This resulted in erratic pricing and exorbitant costs for users, as content owners would often set prices of 5-9 dollars for a 30-minute show, and load the show with commercials. Akimbo also struggled with video quality, using Windows Media as the video type. Videos often were encoded in standard definition with the audio and video out of sync, audio cutting out part way through a video, and or pixelation and distortion to the video. About a month after launching the Akimbo service, the company had about 120 active set-top boxes, about 60 of which were being used by employees and/or investors. On average only about 20 of those 120 players downloaded any content during a month. At the time when the company began its first round of lay-offs, about a year and a half after the initial launch, the number of users had grown to only about 140.  Equipment and programming = Equipment  Akimbo's hard-drive-equipped set-top box connected to a broadband connection and stored the chosen full-resolution programs using Akimbo's TiVo-like guide.

A Republican, he is most notable for his service as a U.S. Representative, U.S. Senator, state appellate court judge, and a U.S. Ambassador, first to India (1969-1972), then to Israel (1973-1975). A native of Lima, New York, Keating graduated from Genesee Wesleyan Seminary (1915), the University of Rochester (1919), and Harvard Law School (1923). Keating practiced law in Rochester and became active in Republican Party politics. During World War I, Keating served with the Student Army Training Corps at the University of Rochester. He joined the United States Army for World War II, and was commissioned as a major. He served in India as head of the U.S. office that managed the Lend-Lease Program for the China Burma India Theater and was promoted to colonel before the end of the war. Keating remained in the Organized Reserve Corps after his wartime service, was promoted to brigadier general in 1948, and continued to serve until retiring in 1963. In 1946, Keating ran successfully for a U.S. House seat from a Rochester-based district. He was reelected five times, and served from 1947 to 1959. During his House tenure, Keating developed a reputation as a moderate on many issues, which he combined with conservative positions on Cold War anticommunism and the fight against organized crime. In 1958, he ran successfully for a U.S. Senate seat from New York, and he served from 1959 to 1965. Keating was an advocate of desegregation, and played a key role in breaking the filibuster that enabled passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Keating was one of many moderate to liberal Republicans who refused to endorse conservative Republican Barry Goldwater for president in 1964. Defeated for reelection by Robert F. Kennedy in 1964, Keating practiced law briefly, then won a seat on the New York Court of Appeals in the 1965 elections. He served until 1969, when he resigned to become U.S. Ambassador to India. He served in India until 1972, when he resigned and returned home to campaign for the reelection of President Richard Nixon. In 1973, Nixon appointed Keating Ambassador to Israel, and Keating remained in this position until his death. Early life Keating was born in Lima, New York on May 18, 1900, the son of Louise (Barnard) Keating, a schoolteacher, and Thomas Mosgrove Keating, a grocer. He was tutored by his mother until age seven, when he began attending the Lima public schools as a sixth grader. He graduated from high school at age 13 and attended Genesee Wesleyan Seminary, from which he graduated in 1915 as the class valedictorian. He graduated from the University of Rochester in 1919, and was a member of the Delta Upsilon fraternity and Phi Beta Kappa. He taught Latin and Greek for a year at Rochester's East High School, then began attendance at Harvard Law School. He graduated in 1923, was admitted to the bar, and commenced practice in Rochester. Keating's early forays into politics and government included service as town attorney for the town of Brighton, where he resided while practicing law in Rochester. Military service During World War I, Keating served in the Student Army Training Corps at the University of Rochester, where he attained the rank of sergeant. In April, 1942 Keating joined the Army for World War II and was commissioned as a major. He served initially as chief of the assignments branch in the international division of the Army Service Forces headquarters, and was promoted to lieutenant colonel in October, 1942. In 1943, Keating was assigned to India as head of the Army Service Forces international office that administered the Lend-Lease Program for the China Burma India Theater, part of the South East Asia Command commanded by Lord Louis Mountbatten. He was promoted to colonel in February 1944 and in July 1944 he made an assessment tour of the theater's front lines with General Albert Coady Wedemeyer, Mountbatten's chief of staff, which took him to sixteen countries, including Ceylon, Burma, Indochina, and Java. Keating later served as executive assistant to Mountbatten's U.S. deputy, Lieutenant General Raymond Albert Wheeler, and was the senior American officer at the South East Asia Command's rear headquarters in India. In November 1945, Mountbatten dispatched Keating to London to provide Parliament information on the post-war rebuilding of India. Keating closed out his wartime service as a liaison between the Army Services Forces and the British military office in Washington, DC, and was awarded the Legion of Merit with Oak Leaf Cluster and the Order of the British Empire. Keating remained in the Organized Reserve Corps after the war, and was promoted to brigadier general in 1948. He continued to serve until retiring from the military in 1963. U.S. House A Republican, Keating was a member of the New York delegation to every Republican National Convention from 1940 to 1964 with the exception of 1944, when he was overseas with the Army. On returning to the United States after World War II, Keating ran successfully for a Rochester-area seat in the U.S. House of Representatives in the 1946 election. He was reelected five times, and served in the 80th, 81st, 82nd, 83rd, 84th and 85th United States Congresses (January 3, 1947 to January 3, 1959). Keating was regarded as a liberal Republican on many issues, but adopted conservative positions on anticommunism during the Cold War and fighting organized crime. He supported the Truman Doctrine and Marshall Plan and sponsored an early civil rights bill. He opposed diplomatic recognition of \\"Red China\\" after the Chinese civil war, and supported allowing the Federal Bureau of Investigation to use tactics including wiretaps on organized crime figures and suspected communist sympathizers. As a senior member of the House Judiciary Committee, Keating was active in shepherding the Civil Rights Act of 1957 to passage. Keating also enhanced his public profile by creating a semi-monthly Rochester-area television show in which he discussed current events with government officials including fellow members of Congress, which increased his personal popularity among his House colleagues, who appreciated the opportunity to publicize their activities. U.S. Senate In 1958, Keating was the Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate seat of the retiring Irving Ives, and defeated Democrat Frank Hogan, the New York County District Attorney. He served from January 3, 1959 to January 3, 1965 (the 86th, 87th and 88th Congresses) and was defeated for reelection in 1964 by Robert F. Kennedy. During his Senate term, Keating served on the Judiciary and Rules committees. In 1960, Keating introduced the Twenty-Third Amendment to the United States Constitution, which allowed residents of the District of Columbia to vote in presidential elections. In 1962, before the Cuban Missile Crisis that began in October, Keating publicly cited a source who had informed him that the Soviet Union and Cuba had constructed intercontinental ballistic missile facilities in Cuba that could target the United States, and urged President John F. Kennedy to take action. He also worked with a bipartisan coalition that enabled passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by breaking a conservative filibuster. During the 1964 Republican National Convention, Keating staged a walkout of the majority of the New York delegation after conservative Barry Goldwater won the presidential nomination. In the general election campaign, Keating refused to endorse Goldwater, and did not campaign for him in New York. Keating outperformed Goldwater on election day, but was defeated for reelection by the Democratic nominee, Robert F. Kennedy, who had established residency in New York shortly before becoming a candidate. Keating accused Kennedy of \\"carpetbagging\\", but Democratic strength in what proved to be a wave election nationwide was sufficient to propel Kennedy to victory. Later career=Appeals court judge In 1965, Keating was elected to the New York Court of Appeals. He served until resigning in 1969. Though elected to a 14-year term, New York required judges to retire at age 70. Because he was in his 60s when elected, Keating desired to make a mark in what he anticipated would be a short tenure. As a result, in his brief time on the bench, he authored more than 100 opinions. Keating's judicial philosophy was that precedent was binding, but only to the extent that it made sense in the context of the current case and times; he disagreed with following precedent for its own sake. He also disagreed with the concept of distinguishing cases; that is, explaining in an opinion that an existing precedent applies partly but not completely because of materially different facts between the precedent-setting case and the current one. In Keating's view, if a precedent was to be overturned, it should simply be overturned; attempts to distinguish cases by parsing language or selectively picking and choosing case details were confusing to attorneys and judges because they amounted to dishonest reasoning. In Liberty National Bank v. Buscaglia, Keating rejected the argument that national banks should be exempt from paying state taxes on the grounds that they were instruments of the federal government. In Keating's view, national banks had changed so much since the 1819 McCulloch v. Maryland decision gave them the exemption from state taxes that the McCulloch precedent no longer applied. In Gallagher v. St. Raymond's Roman Catholic Church, Keating's opinion overturned the precedent that the owner of a building to which the public was invited had no duty to illuminate the building's outside stairway. Keating argued that while the precedent made sense in the eras of candles, lanterns and gas lighting, which were not universally accessible, the availability of electric lighting nearly everywhere had rendered it obsolete. In Flanagan v. Mount Eden General Hospital, the court overruled the common law tradition that the statute of limitations in medical malpractice actions which involved instruments left inside a patient began to run from the commission of the act. Keating's opinion argued that logically, the statute of limitations should begin at the point where the patient first became aware of the instrument that had not been retrieved. Ambassador to India In 1969, Keating was appointed U.S. Ambassador to India, which enabled him to make use of the goodwill and contacts he had established during his World War II military service. His tenure was regarded as a success for U.S.-India relations until its last few months, when the Nixon Administration tacitly supported Pakistan in the Bangladesh Liberation War. India conducted a successful war against Pakistan which lasted two weeks and resulted in the transformation of East Pakistan into the independent state of Bangladesh. As a result of U.S. support for Pakistan in the conflict, America suspended economic aid to India, and India closed five American cultural centers. Keating remained in India until 1972, when he returned to the United States to campaign for the reelection of President Richard M. Nixon. Ambassador to Israel He served as Ambassador to Israel from August 1973 until his death. Keating's ambassadorship was high profile; he built a network of contacts and conducted one on one diplomacy by entertaining frequently at his home in the Tel Aviv suburbs. Despite his efforts, members of the Israeli government were reportedly unhappy with his work, and expressed skepticism about the quality of the reports he sent to the State Department in Washington. In one instance, Israel's government claimed Keating had misinformed U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger about the effects of public opinion in Israel on how much compromising its government could do in attempting to reach agreement with Egypt on the occupation of the Sinai. Death and burial Keating suffered a heart attack on April 17, 1975 while visiting his daughter in New Jersey, and was admitted to Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in New York City. He died in the hospital on May 5. Keating's funeral was held at St. John's Episcopal Church in Washington, and he was buried at Arlington National Cemetery. Family In 1928, Keating was married to Louise DePuy, who died in 1968. In 1974, he married Mary Leet Pitcairn (d. 2009), the former wife of William Harding Jackson and former secretary for General Omar N. Bradley. She was the widow of attorney Wendell Davis, who had been a law school classmate of Keating. In addition to his second wife, Keating was survived by his daughter, Judith K. Howe of Short Hills, New Jersey. Legacy The federal building in Rochester is named for Keating. Brooklyn Law School awards the annual Judge Kenneth B. Keating Memorial Prize to a member of each graduating class who demonstrates exceptional achievement in the field of conflict of laws. The Kenneth Barnard Keating Papers are part of the Rare Books, Special Collections and Preservation holdings at the University of Rochester. Senator Keating Boulevard in the town of Brighton, a road which was constructed in the late 1990s, is named for Keating.

Joseph Unterman, November 1938, both in the signature and also in the seal was the first Chief Rabbi of Ireland, his term lasting from 1921 to 1936. From 1936 until his death in 1959, he was Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi of the British Mandate of Palestine and of Israel after its independence in 1948. Biography Isaac Halevi Herzog was born in ≈Åom≈ºa, Poland, the son of Liba Miriam (Cyrowicz) and Joel Leib Herzog. He moved to the United Kingdom with his family in 1898, where they settled in Leeds. His initial schooling was largely at the instruction of his father who was a rabbi in Leeds and then later in Paris. After mastering Talmudic studies at a young age, Yitzhak went on to attend the Sorbonne and then later the University of London, where he received his doctorate. His thesis, which made him famous in the Jewish world, concerned his claim of re-discovering Tekhelet, the type of blue dye once used for the making of Tzitzit. Rabbi Herzog's descendants have continued to be active in Israel's political life. His son Chaim Herzog was a general in the Israel Defense Forces and later became ambassador of Israel to the UN and President of Israel. His son Yaakov Herzog served as Israel's ambassador to Canada and later as Director General of the Prime Minister's Office. He also accepted an offer to become Chief Rabbi of the British Commonwealth but due to ill health never took up that role. His grandson Isaac Herzog was a member of the Knesset, Israel's parliament, and head of the opposition. He previously served as housing and tourism minister and minister of welfare. Rabbinic career Rabbi Herzog served as rabbi of Belfast from 1916 to 1919 and was appointed rabbi of Dublin in 1919. A fluent speaker of the Irish language, he supported the First D√°il and the Irish republican cause during the Irish War of Independence, and became known as \\"the Sinn F√©in Rabbi\\". He went on to serve as Chief Rabbi of Ireland between 1922 and 1936, when he immigrated to Palestine to succeed Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook as Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi upon his death. He became a supporter of both the Irish Republican Army and the Irgun.Calder Walton, 'British Intelligence and Threats to British National Security After the Second World War,' in Matthew Grant (ed) The British Way in Cold Warfare: Intelligence, Diplomacy and the Bomb 1945-1975, A&C; Black, 2011 pp.141-158 p.151. In May 1939, shortly before the Second World War, the British put out the White Paper of 1939 restricting Jewish immigration to Palestine. After leading a procession through the streets of Jerusalem, with an unusually united Jewish following from all sects, on the steps of the Hurva Synagogue he turned and said: \\"We cannot agree to the White Paper. Just as the prophets did before me, I hereby rip it in two.\\" Some 40 years later, on 10 November 1975 Ambassador Herzog repeated his father's gesture with the UN resolution that Zionism is equal to racism. During the Second World War, Rabbi Herzog travelled with great risk to the US, and back, not before he was able to secure a meeting with Roosevelt. Roosevelt smiled and did not reply to the Rabbi's pleadings for a promise to help the Jews of Europe. His biographer records that several people noticed that his hair turned white when he left the meeting, which he perceived as a failure. Following this, he immediately returned home, missing the ride on a ship that was sunk by a U-boat, and taking what was said to be the last civilian ship to cross the Atlantic during the war. After the war, Rabbi Herzog dedicated himself to saving Jewish children especially babies and bringing them back from their places of hiding throughout all of Europe, to their families or to Jewish orphanages. Many of these were hidden in Christian monasteries or by Christian families, and refused to return them. In his biography, he tells of the difficulties he had of meeting the Pope who avoided him, but did receive in the end assistance from the Vatican. In later years it was found that Karol Wojty≈Ça, future Pope John Paul II, was the contact who helped the rabbi out.On Popes and Jews, Akiba Zimmerman, Hazofe newspaper archive (Hebrew). It is said as an urban legend, that one tactic he had for proving which children were Jewish, although still in denial or mostly afraid of the monastery staff, would be to call out the Shema Yisroel and Jewish children would instinctively cover their eyes along with him. However, defenders of Pope Pius XII have asserted that Herzog had maintained friendly relations with the pontiff during and after the World War II. In 1945, he stated: ‚ÄúThe people of Israel will never forget what His Holiness and his illustrious delegates are doing for our unfortunate brothers and sisters in the most tragic hour of our history, which is living proof of Divine Providence in this world.‚Äù Published works Rabbi Herzog was recognised as a great rabbinical authority, and he wrote many books and articles dealing with halachic problems surrounding the Torah and the State of Israel. Indeed, his writings helped shaped the attitude of the Religious Zionist Movement toward the State of Israel. Rabbi Herzog authored: *Main Institutions of Jewish Law *Heichal Yitzchak *Techukah leYisrael al pi haTorah *Pesachim uKetavim *The Royal Purple and the Biblical Blue  Awards and recognition * In 1958, Rabbi Herzog was awarded the Israel Prize, in Rabbinical literature.

His efforts contributed much to the great increase in popularity of European classical music in the United States during the late 19th century.  Life  Balatka was born in Hoffnungsthal (near Olm√ºtz, today Doly, part of the village Bouzov), Moravia. His parents were noted musicians. He studied law at Olm√ºtz, and after finishing the course was engaged as tutor by a wealthy family in Vienna. There he also perfected his knowledge of harmony and composition under Simon Sechter und Heinrich Proch. This source gives a birthdate of March 5, 1836. He began his musical career as conductor for singing societies. He became a member of the Academic Legion during the Revolutions of 1848. After the Vienna Uprising was crushed, he decided to emigrate to the United States. In 1849 he reached Wisconsin and, following a romantic impulse, tried rural life for a spell, but soon settled in Milwaukee, where he conducted the Musical Society (), founded in 1850, beginning in 1851. He produced several oratorios and operas, and conducted musical festivals in Cleveland, Cincinnati, Detroit, Chicago, and Pittsburgh. In 1860 he left the Musikverein to become leader of the newly founded Philharmonic Society of Chicago. In 1867 he became director of the Germania M√§nnerchor, and in the same year conducted the group at Nord-Amerikanischer S√§ngerbund held in Indianapolis, where they performed the works of Franz Abt. In 1868 he directed a musical festival at Chicago, which was pronounced the greatest that had been held in this country up to that time. The Great Chicago Fire of 1871 destroyed his home, and he went on a concert tour for two years. He organized the Liederkranz Society in 1873, and later the Mozart Club and the Chicago Musical Society. He was also director to the Arion des Westen Musical Society and in 1879 he founded the Balatka Academy of Musical Art, in which his son Christian and his daughter Annie were teachers. He conducted a great Saengerfest in Chicago, with a chorus of 2,200, a mixed chorus of 1,200, and an orchestra of 150. He died in Chicago at the age of 72. Works Balatka's compositions are few in number. Besides his addition of a climax to Chopin's \\"Funeral March,\\" in place of its abrupt ending, he composed a grand aria for soprano with accompaniment, a piano quartet, a sonata, and several songs. He was the author of A Condensed History of Music (1888), A History of Orchestra Music in Chicago, and contributed musical articles regularly to the Chicago Daheim.

A useful index fossil, this tree is found in strata dating from the Upper Devonian to Lower Carboniferous (), the oldest fossils being 385 million years old,Fossilized Roots Are Revealing the Nature of 385-Million-Year-Old Forests and had global distribution. Until the 2007 discovery of Wattieza, many scientists considered Archaeopteris to be the earliest known tree. Bearing buds, reinforced branch joints, and branched trunks similar to today's wood, it is more reminiscent of modern seed-bearing trees than other spore bearing taxa; It combines characteristics of woody trees and herbaceous ferns, and belongs to a group of extinct plants sometimes called the progymnosperms, plants with gymnosperm-like wood but that produce spores rather than seeds. A reconstruction of Archaeopteris macilenta from the Late Devonian, Walton Formation of Hancock, New York A polished round of permineralised wood of Callixylon whiteanum from the Late Devonian Woodford Shale of Ada, Oklahoma Taxonomy John William Dawson described the genus in 1871. The name derives from the ancient Greek (archaƒ´os, \\"ancient\\"), and (pt√©ris, \\"fern\\"). Archaeopteris was originally classified as a fern, and it remained classified so for over 100 years. In 1911, Russian paleontologist Mikhail Dimitrievich Zalessky described a new type of petrified wood from the Donets Basin in nowadays Ukraine. He called the wood Callixylon, though he did not find any structures other than the trunk. The similarity to conifer wood was recognized. It was also noted that ferns of the genus Archaeopteris were often found associated with fossils of Callixylon. In the 1960s, paleontologist Charles B. Beck was able to demonstrate that the fossil wood known as Callixylon and the leaves known as Archaeopteris were actually part of the same plant. It was a plant with a mixture of characteristics not seen in any living plant, a link between true gymnosperms and ferns. The genus Archaeopteris is placed in the order Archaeopteridales and family Archaeopteridaceae. The name is similar to that of the first known feathered bird, Archaeopteryx, but in this case refers to the fern-like nature of the plant's fronds.  Relationship to spermatophytes  Archaeopteris sp. ‚Äì reconstruction at MUSE - Science Museum in Trento Archaeopteris notosaria fronds from the Waterloo Farm lagerst√§tte in the Eastern Cape, South Africa. These represent the only high latitude species of Archaeopteris as yet described. Archaeopteris is a member of a group of free-sporing woody plants called the progymnosperms that are interpreted as distant ancestors of the gymnosperms. Archaeopteris reproduced by releasing spores rather than by producing seeds, but some of the species, such as Archaeopteris halliana were heterosporous, producing two types of spores. This is thought to represent an early step in the evolution of vascular plants towards reproduction by seeds, which first appeared in the earliest, long extinct, gymnosperm group, the seed ferns (Pteridospermatophyta). The conifers or Pinophyta are one of four divisions of extant gymnosperms that arose from the seed ferns during the Carboniferous period.  Description  The trees of this genus typically grew to in height with leafy foliage reminiscent of some conifers. The large fern- like fronds were thickly set with fan-shaped leaflets or pinnae. The trunks of some species exceeded in diameter. The branches were borne in spiral arrangement, and a forked stipule was present at the base of each branch. Within a branch, leafy shoots were in opposite arrangement in a single plane. On fertile branches, some of the leaves were replaced by sporangia (spore capsules).  Other modern adaptations  Aside from its woody trunk, Archaeopteris possessed other modern adaptations to light interception and perhaps to seasonality as well. The large umbrella of fronds seems to have been quite optimized for light interception at the canopy level. In some species, the pinnules were shaped and oriented to avoid shading one another. There is evidence that whole fronds were shed together as single units, perhaps seasonally like modern deciduous foliage or like trees in the cypress family Cupressaceae. The plant had nodal zones that would have been important sites for the subsequent development of lateral roots and branches. Some branches were latent and adventitious, similar to those produced by living trees that eventually develop into roots. Before this time, shallow, rhizomatous roots had been the norm, but with Archaeopteris, deeper root systems were being developed that could support ever higher growth.  Habitat  Evidence indicates that Archaeopteris preferred wet soils, growing close to river systems and in floodplain woodlands. It would have formed a significant part of the canopy vegetation of early forests. Speaking of the first appearance of Archaeopteris on the world-scene, Stephen Scheckler, a professor of biology and geological sciences at Virginia Polytechnic Institute, says, \\"When [Archaeopteris] appears, it very quickly became the dominant tree all over the Earth. On all of the land areas that were habitable, they all had this tree\\". One species, Archaeopteris notosaria, has even been reported from within what was then the Antarctic circle: leaves and fertile structures were identified from the Waterloo Farm lagerst√§tte in what is now South Africa.Anderson, H. M., Hiller, N. and Gess, R. W.(1995). Archaeopteris (Progymnospermopsida) from the Devonian of southern Africa. Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society 117, 305‚Äì320. Scheckler believes that Archaeopteris had a major role in transforming its environment. \\"Its litter fed the streams and was a major factor in the evolution of freshwater fishes, whose numbers and varieties exploded in that time, and influenced the evolution of other marine ecosystems. It was the first plant to produce an extensive root system, so had a profound impact on soil chemistry. And once these ecosystem changes happened, they were changed for all time. It was a one-time thing.\\"Virginia Tech, \\"Earliest Modern Tree Lived 360-345 Million Years Ago,\\" ScienceDaily, 22 April 1999 Looking roughly like a top-heavy Christmas tree, Archaeopteris may have played a part in the transformation of Earth's climate during the Devonian before becoming extinct within a short period of time at the beginning of the Carboniferous period.

Mike Vejar served as director for the episode. Captain Archer and Sub-Commander T'Pol are kidnapped while en route to a planet in the Coridan system, which results in a confrontation between Vulcan and Andorian forces. The events of this episode (coupled with that of \\"The Andorian Incident\\") proved to be the basis for many future occurrences and plot devices in the following three seasons of Star Trek: Enterprise. These included many reprisal attempts against both Archer and T'Pol by the Vulcan High Command, and the developing trust and respect between Archer and the Andorian Commander Shran. There would also be long-ranging implications for T'Pol and for her family, as revealed in the fourth season episode, \\"Home\\". Plot A Vulcan delegation, headed by Ambassador Soval, complains to Admiral Forrest about the recent diplomatic incident at P'Jem. Soval blames Captain Archer: in response, joint fleet operations are suspended, and Sub-Commander T'Pol is to be recalled from her post. Enterprise, however, is already on its way to Coridan, a planet which has a mining agreement and the largest starship construction yards in the sector. As Archer and T'Pol head to the capital city, their shuttlepod is captured. Later, they try to escape, but are soon recaptured by Traeg, an anti-government leader, who then sends a ransom request of weapons to Enterprise. After refusing to co-operate with the Vulcans (sent by Soval to return T'Pol to Vulcan) and their rescue mission, Commander Tucker and Lieutenant Reed mount their own, leaving Sato to somehow distract them. The pair are soon 'captured' by Commander Shran and Tholos of the Andorian Imperial Guard, who want to repay Archer for his interventions at P'Jem. The humans and Andorians covertly break into the rebel compound where Archer and T'Pol are being held, while the Vulcans, led by Captain Sopek, attempt a more direct rescue mission. The rival groups then confront one another amid the wreckage of the compound. As they argue about treaty violations, T'Pol notices Traeg targeting the group. She pushes Sopek out of the way and takes the phaser blast meant for him. Archer gathers her up and leaves with his away- team. In Sickbay, Doctor Phlox treats her, and Sopek arrives to ask about her condition. Archer asks that T'Pol be given a second chance, and he agrees to lobby the Vulcan High Command on her behalf. As they leave, Phlox revives T'Pol with a hypospray, and Archer says that she will be on Enterprise for a while longer. Continuity * The events of \\"The Andorian Incident\\" are referenced in this episode. Reception Despite being generally considered one of the first season's best episodes, \\"Shadows of P'Jem\\" sparked controversy at the time of broadcast over a tongue-in-cheek scene in which T'Pol and Archer, tied back-to-back, try awkwardly to get themselves free, their efforts ultimately resulting in Archer momentarily being smothered by T'Pol's breasts.

Each high- performance sports car is hand-built by a small team of craftsmen, and the only way to purchase a brand new Isdera was to call the CEO directly. Each vehicle is custom built for its original buyer, and a waiting period of twelve months is to be expected.  History  The first vehicle designed by Eberhard Schulz appeared in 1969, named Erator GTE. In 1978 the concept car CW 311 was presented, engineered by Schulz and promoted by the b&b; company.https://web.archive.org/web/20141203104255/http://isdera.de/isdera.php?site=modelle The company Isdera was founded in 1981 in Leonberg. Its first car, the Spyder 033, was presented in 1982. Some other vehicles in the company's history are the 1984 Isdera Imperator 108i, 1985 Spyder 033-16 and the 1987 Spyder 036i. Each model was unveiled at the Geneva Motor Show, Switzerland. In 1993 Isdera designed the Commendatore 112i, which weighed . It could accelerate from 0 to 97 km/h in 4.0 seconds, and had a top speed of . The car had a mid-mounted Mercedes-Benz 6.0 L V12 engine generating and a 6-speed manual transmission. The Commendatore had many advanced and unique features such as two sets of gull-wing doors, a velocity-sensitive electronic chassis that lowers the car at high speeds, and an automatic air brake. The 112i was featured in the 1997 video game Need for Speed II. An estimated 70 cars have been sold by Isdera since 1983. Projects since 1993 have been kept top secret by Isdera. The company's most recent automotive ventures and sales figures have not been released to the general public. In 1999, the Commendatore was modified and was now called the Silver Arrow C112i and was powered by a Mercedes-Benz, V12. The car's top speed was recorded at 230 mph (370 km/h) during testing. At the time of its introduction, the Silver Arrow was the only car in the world to feature an automatically lifting airbrake. The Silver Arrow prototype was offered for sale on eBay in October 2005 for US$3 million, but was not sold. At the time of the auction, the car was located in Switzerland. In 2006, Isdera introduced the Autobahnkurier AK116i, a controversially styled vehicle powered by two Mercedes-Benz V8 engines ‚Äì one for each axle ‚Äì from the W126-500SE, and reminiscent of a 1930s touring car.

Darius built the road to facilitate rapid communication throughout his very large empire from Susa to Sardis. Mounted couriers of the Angarium were supposed to travel from Susa to Sardis in nine days; the journey took ninety days on foot. Course of the Royal Road The course of the road has been reconstructed from the writings of Herodotus,Herodotus, Histories v.52-54, viii.98; Herodotus seems to have been in possession of an itinerary. suggested that Herodotus was partly in error in his tracing the route through Anatolia by making it cross the Halys and showed that though his overall his distances in parasangs are approximately correct, his distances over the sections he describes bear no relation to geographical facts. archeological research, and other historical records. It began in Sardis near the Aegean coast of Lydia, traveled east through Anatolia (crossing the Halys according to Herodotus), and passed through the Cilician Gates to the old Assyrian capital Nineveh in upper Mesopotamia, then turned south to Babylon. From near Babylon, it is believed to have split into two routes, one traveling northeast then east through Ecbatana and on along the Silk Road (via the Great Khurasan Road), the other continuing east through the future Persian capital Susa and then southeast to Persepolis in the Zagros Mountains. Of course, such long routes for travellers and tradesmen would often take months on end, and during the reign of Darius the Great numerous royal outposts (Caravanserai) were built. History of the Royal Road Because the road did not follow the shortest nor the easiest route between the important cities of the Persian Empire, archeologists believe the westernmost sections of the road may have originally been built by the Assyrian kings, as the road plunges through the heart of their old empire. More eastern segments of the road, identifiable in present-day northern Iran, were not noted by Herodotus, whose view of Persia was that of an Ionian Greek in the West;\\"Herodotus, a Greek from the Aegean coast of Asia Minor, appears to have reported only that part of the network which led directly to the parts of the Greek world that concerned him,\\" notes stretches of the Royal Road across the central plateau of Iran are coincident with the major trade route known as the Silk Road. This route was used by couriers to deliver messages to the Persian capital. However, Darius I improved the existing road network into the Royal Road as it is recognized today. A later improvement by the Romans of a road bed with a hard-packed gravelled surface of 6.25 m width held within a stone curbing was found in a stretch near GordiumNear Gordium the track was identified as post-Phrygian, as it wound round Phrygian tumuli: p. 266 \\"The Royal Road\\"; and 61 (1957:319 and illus.). and connecting the parts together in a unified whole stretching some 1677 miles, primarily as a post road, with a hundred and eleven posting stations maintained with a supply of fresh horses, a quick mode of communication using relays of swift mounted messengers, the kingdom's pirradazis. The construction of the road as improved by Darius was of such quality that the road continued to be used until Roman times. A bridge at Diyarbakƒ±r, Turkey, still stands from this period of the road's use. The road also helped Persia increase long-distance trade, which reached its peak during the time of Alexander the Great (Alexander III of Macedon). In 1961, under a grant from the American Philosophical Society, S. F. Starr traced the stretch of road from Gordium to Sardis, identifying river crossings by ancient bridge abutments. It was maintained by personal guards. The road also was made secure by the Persians. Guard posts were stationed along the road, patrols were also made to secure the route. The Royal Road would be a monument of the Persian Empire. Legacy The Greek historian Herodotus wrote, \\"There is nothing in the world that travels faster than these Persian couriers.\\" Herodotus's praise for these messengers--\\"Neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night stays these couriers from the swift completion of their appointed rounds\\"-- was inscribed on the James Farley Post Office in New York and is sometimes thought of as the United States Postal Service creed.  A metaphorical \\"Royal Road\\" in famous quotations  Euclid is said to have replied to King Ptolemy's request for an easier way of learning mathematics that \\"there is no Royal Road to geometry\\", according to Proclus.Proclus, p. 57 Charles Sanders Peirce, in his How to Make Our Ideas Clear (1878), says, \\"There is no royal road to logic, and really valuable ideas can only be had at the price of close attention.\\" This essay was claimed by William James as instrumental in the foundation of the philosophical school of pragmatism. Sigmund Freud famously described dreams as the \\"royal road to the unconscious\\" (\\"Via regia zur Kenntnis des Unbewu√üten\\"). Karl Marx wrote in the 1872 Preface to the French Edition of Das Kapital (Volume 1), \\"There is no royal road to science, and only those who do not dread the fatiguing climb of its steep paths have a chance of gaining its luminous summits.\\" The Royal Road to Romance (1925) is the first book by Richard Halliburton, covering his world travels as a young man from Andorra to Angkor.

Ramdev was born on Bhadra Shukla Dooj in c.1405 in a Meghwansi family at Ramderiya. In Rajasthan, Ramdev is the chief deity of the Meghwal community, worshiped during Vedwa Punam (August ‚Äì September). The community's religious leader, Gokuldas, claims that Ramdev was himself a Meghwal(jaipal) in his 1982 book Meghwal Itihas, which constructs a history of the Meghwal community. However, this is a claim accepted only by the Meghwal community themselves. Muslims venerate Ramdev as Ramshah Pir or Rama Shah Peer. He was said to have had miraculous powers and his fame reached far and wide. Legend has it that five Pirs from Mecca came to test Ramdev's powers. Ramdev welcomed them, and requested them to have lunch with him. The Pirs declined, saying that they ate only with their personal utensils, which were in Mecca. At this, Ramdev smiled and said look your utensils are coming and they saw that their eating bowls were coming flying in air from Mecca. After being convinced of his abilities and powers, they paid their homage to him and named him Rama Shah Peer. The five Pirs, who came to test his powers, were so impressed by him that they decided to stay with him. Their graves are located near Ramdev's samadhi. Ramdev believed in the equality of all human beings, be they high or low, rich or poor. He helped the down-trodden by granting them their wishes. He is often depicted on horseback. His followers are spread across in Rajasthan, Haryana, Punjab, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh, Mumbai, Delhi and also in Sindh in Pakistan. Several fairs in Rajasthan are held to commemorate him. Temples in his name are found in many states of India.Story of Ramdev Pir Devotees during the two-month carnival at Ramdevra, Rajasthan, India Samadhi and Main Temple in Ramdevra Ramdevji Samadhi Darshan, Ramdevra, Rajasthan Ramdevji Samadhi Darshan, Ramdevra, Rajasthan Ramdev took Samadhi at Ramdevra (10 km from Pokhran) in Rajasthan, on Bhadrapada Shukla Ekadashi in V.S. 1442 at the age of 37 years. Dalibai, his ardent follower from the Meghwal community, is also buried near his grave and is said to have taken Samadhi two days before Ramdev. The temple complex housing the resting place of Ramdev is located at Ramdevra (10 km from Pokhran) in Rajasthan. The present temple structure was built around Ramdev's final resting place by Maharaja Ganga Singh of Bikaner in 1931.http://ramdevdarshan.in/ The complex also houses Samadhis of his disciples like Dalibai and some other of his chief disciples.

The annual festival of Ramapir Temple Tando Allahyar is the second largest pilgrimage sites for the Hindus in Pakistan. Every year in the Hindu month of Bhadrapad, 3 days celebrations are arranged by Ramapir Sheva Mandli. Legend According to a legend, about 150 years ago, a man of the Khatri community of Tando Allahyar took a vow that if he was blessed with a son, he would arrange mela (fair) of Rama Pir. His wish was fulfilled. The man brought an earthen lamp from the original temple of Rama Pir in Rajasthan to Tando Allahyar and built a temple. During the mela, people carry flags in their hands and recite bhajans whole night sitting outside the city, and early in the morning at 5:00 AM they hoist the Dhaja (flag) at the temple by dancing on the beat of drums and trumpets. Thousands of devotees travel on foot to pay homage to Rama Pir. Although Ramdev was cremated in Rajasthan, he had come to Tando Allahyar and his devotees had constructed a temple in his memory at the place where he had worshiped as far back as 1800. Since then, a fair is held at the Rama Pir temple by his devotees every year.By Ramesh Kumar (Ravi) Meghwar, Tando Allahyar +92-300-3322811. There is also a temple of Ramdev Pir in Chelhar, Sindh, Pakistan. It is thought that the horse of Baba Ramdev Pir used to feed and rest up there. Media A Rajasthani language film based on the life of Ramdev, Baba Ramdev, was made in the 1960s. The movie was a commercial success. Gujarati language film Jay Ramdev Pir was based on the life of Ramdev Pir. Gopal Bajaj is a singer and musician from Hyderabad, best known for his performances for many Ramdevji bhajans. 24 Banis are considered as famous literature composed by Ramdev. Many poets and followers like Harji Bhati, Raja Mansinh, Likhmauji Mali, Vijoji Sani, Hiranand Mali, Devshi Mali and Rani Rupande composed folk-tales about him which are still sung by his followers. Folklore One day, young Ramdev wanted to play with a toy horse. His father gave a toymaker sandalwood and new cloth to make a wooden horse. The toymaker, however, stole most of the new cloth for his wife, and made the wooden horse from a piece of old cloth, with only a cover from new cloth. When Ramdev sat on the horse it began to fly and disappeared into the sky along with the child. Ramdev's parents got angry with the toymaker and imprisoned him. Shortly afterward, Ramdev came back along with the horse and accused the toymaker of cheating. The toymaker confessed his crime and begged for forgiveness. Ramdev forgave him and accepted the horse. Wooden toy horses covered with cloth are among the most popular offerings at the temples dedicated to him.

History The Bank of England first decided to open premises on Castle Street, Liverpool in 1826, which helped established the area as the city's financial centre. The present building was designed by Charles Robert Cockerell and built in a Neoclassical style between 1845 and 1848. The building was constructed as one of three branch banks for the Bank of England in the mid-19th century. The building was used entirely by the bank and did not contain any lettable space to other businesses, which were being fast established in the district. Subsequently Cockerell built a similar building in Cook Street for this purpose. It was demolished in 1959. Architecture The building combines several neoclassical architectural styles, including Greek, Roman and Renaissance. The most evident of these is Greek, with four Doric style columns 'tying' the ground and first floors together. The building itself is raised up from ground level, sitting atop a rough granite plinth. The front of the building held accommodation for the bank's agent, accessible from Union Court. The sub-agent had a similar layout at the rear. Despite only being three bays wide and seven bays deep, the building's design was seen to give it an \\"overwhelmingly massive and powerful\\" appearance. The building is regarded as one of Cockerell's most impressive and was described by Nikolaus Pevsner as a \\"masterpiece of Victorian architecture\\". and by the National Heritage List for England as \\"one of Cockerell's richest and most inventive buildings.\\" It was Grade I listed on 28 June 1952.

It operated the former Fairfield Shipyard and took its name from the Govan area in which it was located. History The former Govan Shipbuilders yard is now under the ownership of BAE Systems Surface Ships, building a Type 45 destroyer, 2007. The company was formed in 1972 by way of a purchase of the former Fairfield Shipyard in Govan from Sir Robert Smith, Liquidator of Upper Clyde Shipbuilders (UCS), itself a product of the amalgamation of several Clydeside yards; Fairfields, Alex Stephens, Charles Connell and Company, Yarrow Shipbuilders Ltd. and John Browns.University of Glasgow Archives Between 1973 and 1980 Scotstoun Marine Ltd, a subsidiary of Govan Shipbuilders, also operated the former Connell shipyard in Scotstoun. In 1977 the Company was nationalised by the Labour government of James Callaghan under the Aircraft and Shipbuilding Industries Act and subsumed into British Shipbuilders.Aircraft & shipbuilding Industries Act Between 1973 and 1988, a total of 53 ships were built by Govan Shipbuilders at the Govan (former Fairfield) shipyard. Investment in plant equipment at the yard during this period included expansion of the steel fabrication facilities and the installation of four 80 ton travelling rope luffing cranes in 1975 by Clarke Chapman, servicing the yard's three slipways, in order to increase the size of units that could be prefabricated. An additional three 80 ton cranes from Scotstoun Marine Ltd were dismantled and transferred to Govan after the Scotstoun yard closed in 1980; they remain distinctive due to their blue paintwork.

Erected from 1695 to 1706 according to plans by Johann Arnold Nering, Martin Gr√ºnberg, Andreas Schl√ºter and Jean de Bodt in Baroque style, it was later converted into a Prussian Hall of Fame. Damaged during the Allied bombing in World War II, the Zeughaus was rebuilt from 1949 to 1967 as part of the Forum Fridericianum.Zeughaus (in German) Landesdenkmalamt Berlin Since 2003, it has been home to the Deutsches Historisches Museum (German Historic Museum). History The Zeughaus is the oldest structure at Unter den Linden. It was built by Frederick III, Elector of Brandenburg between 1695 and 1730 in the Baroque style, to be used as an artillery arsenal for the display of cannons from Brandenburg and Prussia. The first building master was Johann Arnold Nering. After his death in 1695, he was followed by Martin Gr√ºnberg, then Andreas Schl√ºter and finally Jean de Bodt. Andreas Schl√ºter designed the keystones above the round-arch windows in the form of heads of giants. Georg Friedrich Hitzig (1811-1881) constructed the monumental flight of steps to the upper floor of the north wing and also a roof over the courtyard.. The building was converted into a military museum in 1875. In March 1943, Rudolf von Gersdorff tried, but failed to assassinate by suicide bombing Adolf Hitler, during the opening of an exhibition in this museum. From 1949-65 the Zeughaus was restored after heavy war damage, the interior being completely redesigned. In 1952, the government of the German Democratic Republic opened the Museum of German History (Museum f√ºr Deutsche Geschichte) in the Zeughaus, which presented the history of Germany, especially in the modern era, from a Communist point of view. Today, the Zeughaus is the site of the Deutsches Historisches Museum (German Historical Museum).

It is a satellite of Crinkle Crags and stands above the Upper Duddon Valley. Topography When travelling clockwise, Crinkle Crags is the last of the high cirque of fells forming the head of upper Eskdale. It sends out a trio of ridges to the south, running parallel like the prongs of a trident. Working from the west these ridges culminate in Hard Knott, Little Stand and Cold Pike. The Cold Pike ridge begins indistinctly in an area of rocky knolls and small tarns beneath the Fifth Crinkle. Gradually gaining definition it descends to a broad grassy saddle before rising again to the summit plateau of Cold Pike. To the north of the saddle is Great Knott (2,283 ft). This top is considered by most guidebooks to be a subsidiary of Crinkle Crags rather than the nearer Cold Pike.Alfred Wainwright: A Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells, Book 4: Richards, Mark: Mid-Western Fells: Collins (2004): Beyond the summit the ridge continues for another half mile south eastward before falling steeply over the many tiered crags of Wrynose Breast. Wrynose Breast stands above the nascent Duddon and the Wrynose Pass road, which provides the only vehicular link between central Lakeland and the Duddon Valley. Together with Hardknott Pass to the west, Wrynose is the latest incarnation of the Roman road from Ambleside to the port of Ravenglass. To the west of Cold Pike is the Gaitscale Beck, the watercourse separating it from Little Stand. To the east across a wide low col is Pike of Blisco, a conical fell with its footing firmly in Langdale. The source of the River Duddon flows south from this col, curving westward around the foot of Wrynose Breast. To the north is Red Tarn, a feeder via Oxendale of Great Langdale Beck. Red Tarn is an elongated pool whose stony bed can be seen through clear shallow waters, reputed to hold trout.Blair, Don: Exploring Lakeland Tarns: Lakeland Manor Press (2003): It forms a focal point for walkers as the wide path from the summit of Wrynose Pass down to Stool End runs beside it, a further path branching off across the outflow to Crinkle Crags. Geology The fell top is composed of dacite lava flows with the volcaniclastic sandstones and tuffs of the Blisco Member outcropping to the south.British Geological Survey: 1:50,000 series maps, England & Wales Sheet 38: BGS (1998) The main Red Tarn path was originally made to serve Red Crag Mine. This consists of a series of pits and trial borings for iron, concentrated about 300 yards north of the tarn. It was worked from 1860 to 1875 but never achieved commercial success.Adams, John: Mines of the Lake District Fells: Dalesman (1995) Summit The summit plateau of Cold Pike has three widely separated summits, all of which are listed as nuttalls. The lower two are unnamed on Ordnance Survey maps, but are generally referred to as Cold Pike West Top and Cold Pike Far West Top.Nuttall, John & Anne: The Mountains of England & Wales - Volume 2: England (2nd edition): Cicerone (1990): The true summit is itself one of a series of three outcrops in a mild echoing of Crinkle Crags. Each has a cairn, the highest being a fine example. The top is an excellent place from which to survey Crinkle Crags, the Langdale Pikes, and the northern end of the Coniston Fells across Wrynose Bottom; there is a fine distant prospect of the Pennines above Windermere, and Morecambe Bay above the Duddon Valley. *Panorama Ascents Cold Pike can be reached easily via Red Tarn from the carpark at the summit of Wrynose Pass. It can also be climbed (less easily) from Great Langdale. More ‚Äòhonest‚Äô walkers beginning in the south may wish to start from Little Langdale or Wrynose Bottom, first ascending Wrynose Pass. A direct route from Wrynose Bottom is also possible although pathless, skirting around the left of the crags. A consideration here is that the Duddon will need to be forded when starting out. Cold Pike is often seen as a worthwhile detour en route to Crinkle Crags.

Education Toll received his bachelor's degree in physics from Yale University in 1944, after which he served in the U.S. Navy in World War II. He finished his Ph.D. in physics at Princeton in 1952. Career He then moved to the University of Maryland, where he became chair of the Department of Physics and Astronomy in 1953. During his tenure as chair, he was responsible for a major increase in size and quality of the department. The physics building at the University of Maryland is named for him. In 1965 he left to become the second president of the State University of New York at Stony Brook, a position he held until 1978. While he was there, Stony Brook University, one of four SUNY centers created by then-governor Nelson Rockefeller (briefly Vice President of the United States under Gerald Ford), and, until recently, the only four allowed to call themselves \\"universities\\", grew to more than 17,000 students from a handful who started their academic careers before the campus was even finished, at the now-defunct State University of New York on Long Island (SUCOLI). He then returned to the University of Maryland to become president of the original five campuses of the University of Maryland. Comparable to a chancellor position in other state university systems, at the time Toll oversaw UMCP, University of Maryland, Baltimore County, University of Maryland University College, University of Maryland, Eastern Shore, and University of Maryland at Baltimore. When Governor William Donald Schaefer decided to merge most of the state's public universities into a single system, Toll was put in charge of the merger. He then became the first chancellor of the new University System of Maryland. In 1995, at age 71, he became president of Washington College, a small, private liberal arts school in Chestertown, Maryland. There, he was credited with fixing the school's budget crisis and raising its national profile. As a physicist, Toll was known for his work in dispersion theory and elementary particle physics. Between university jobs in the early 1990s, he was president of the Universities Research Association which oversaw the U.S. Superconducting Supercollider project until Congress defunded it. In January 2004, he announced that he would leave Washington College and return to physics research at the University of Maryland. Personal life He married the former Deborah Taintor, and they had two daughters. Toll died on July 15, 2011, of respiratory failure at Fox Hill Assisted Living in Bethesda, Maryland.

The insulae are believed to be involved in consciousness and play a role in diverse functions usually linked to emotion or the regulation of the body's homeostasis. These functions include compassion and empathy, taste, perception, motor control, self-awareness, cognitive functioning, and interpersonal experience. In relation to these, it is involved in psychopathology. The insular cortex is divided into two parts: the larger anterior insula and the smaller posterior insula in which more than a dozen field areas have been identified. The cortical area overlying the insula toward the lateral surface of the brain is the operculum (meaning lid). The opercula are formed from parts of the enclosing frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes. Structure=Connections The anterior part of the insula is subdivided by shallow sulci into three or four short gyri. The anterior insula receives a direct projection from the basal part of the ventral medial nucleus of the thalamus and a particularly large input from the central nucleus of the amygdala. In addition, the anterior insula itself projects to the amygdala. One study on rhesus monkeys revealed widespread reciprocal connections between the insular cortex and almost all subnuclei of the amygdaloid complex. The posterior insula projects predominantly to the dorsal aspect of the lateral and to the central amygdaloid nuclei. In contrast, the anterior insula projects to the anterior amygdaloid area as well as the medial, the cortical, the accessory basal magnocellular, the medial basal, and the lateral amygdaloid nuclei. The posterior part of the insula is formed by a long gyrus. The posterior insula connects reciprocally with the secondary somatosensory cortex and receives input from spinothalamically activated ventral posterior inferior thalamic nuclei. It has also been shown that this region receives inputs from the ventromedial nucleus (posterior part) of the thalamus that are highly specialized to convey homeostatic information such as pain, temperature, itch, local oxygen status, and sensual touch. A human neuroimaging study using diffusion tensor imaging revealed that the anterior insula is interconnected to regions in the temporal and occipital lobe, opercular and orbitofrontal cortex, triangular and opercular parts of the inferior frontal gyrus. The same study revealed differences in the anatomical connection patterns between the left and right hemisphere. The 'circular sulcus of insula' (or sulcus of Reil)is a semi-circular sulcus or fissure that separates the insula from the neighboring gyri of the operculum in the front, above, and behind. Cytoarchitecture The insular cortex has regions of variable cell structure or cytoarchitecture, changing from granular in the posterior portion to agranular in the anterior portion. The insula also receives differential cortical and thalamic input along its length. The anterior insular cortex contains a population of spindle neurons (also called von Economo neurons), identified as characterising a distinctive subregion as the agranular frontal insula.< Development The insular cortex is considered a separate lobe of the telencephalon by some authorities.Brain, MSN Encarta. Archived 2009-10-31. Other sources see the insula as a part of the temporal lobe. It is also sometimes grouped with limbic structures deep in the brain into a limbic lobe. As a paralimbic cortex, the insular cortex is considered to be a relatively old structure. Function=Multimodal sensory processing, sensory binding Functional imaging studies show activation of the insula during audio-visual integration tasks.  Taste  The anterior insula is part of the primary gustatory cortex. Interoceptive awareness There is evidence that, in addition to its base functions, the insula may play a role in certain higher-level functions that operate only in humans and other great apes. The spindle neurons found at a higher density in the right frontal insular cortex are also found in the anterior cingulate cortex, which is another region that has reached a high level of specialization in great apes. It has been speculated that these neurons are involved in cognitive-emotional processes that are specific to primates including great apes, such as empathy and metacognitive emotional feelings. This is supported by functional imaging results showing that the structure and function of the right frontal insula is correlated with the ability to feel one's own heartbeat, or to empathize with the pain of others. It is thought that these functions are not distinct from the lower-level functions of the insula but rather arise as a consequence of the role of the insula in conveying homeostatic information to consciousness. The right anterior insula aids interoceptive awareness of body states, such as the ability to time one's own heartbeat. Moreover, greater right anterior insular gray matter volume correlates with increased accuracy in this subjective sense of the inner body, and with negative emotional experience. It is also involved in the control of blood pressure, in particular during and after exercise, and its activity varies with the amount of effort a person believes he/she is exerting. The insular cortex also is where the sensation of pain is judged as to its degree. Further, the insula is where a person imagines pain when looking at images of painful events while thinking about their happening to one's own body. Those with irritable bowel syndrome have abnormal processing of visceral pain in the insular cortex related to dysfunctional inhibition of pain within the brain. Another perception of the right anterior insula is the degree of nonpainful warmth or nonpainful coldness of a skin sensation. Other internal sensations processed by the insula include stomach or abdominal distension. A full bladder also activates the insular cortex. One brain imaging study suggests that the unpleasantness of subjectively perceived dyspnea is processed in the right human anterior insula and amygdala. The cerebral cortex processing vestibular sensations extends into the insula, with small lesions in the anterior insular cortex being able to cause loss of balance and vertigo. Other noninteroceptive perceptions include passive listening to music, laughter, and crying, empathy and compassion, and language. Motor control In motor control, it contributes to hand-and-eye motor movement, swallowing, gastric motility, and speech articulation. It has been identified as a \\"central command‚Äù centre that ensures that heart rate and blood pressure increase at the onset of exercise. Research upon conversation links it to the capacity for long and complex spoken sentences. It is also involved in motor learning and has been identified as playing a role in the motor recovery from stroke. Homeostasis It plays a role in a variety of homeostatic functions related to basic survival needs, such as taste, visceral sensation, and autonomic control. The insula controls autonomic functions through the regulation of the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems. It has a role in regulating the immune system. Self It has been identified as playing a role in the experience of bodily self-awareness, sense of agency, and sense of body ownership. Social emotions The anterior insula processes a person's sense of disgust both to smells and to the sight of contamination and mutilation ‚Äî even when just imagining the experience. This associates with a mirror neuron-like link between external and internal experiences. In social experience, it is involved in the processing of norm violations, emotional processing, empathy, and orgasms. The insula is active during social decision making. Tiziana Quarto et al. measured emotional intelligence (EI) (the ability to identify, regulate, and process emotions of themselves and of others) of sixty-three healthy subjects. Using fMRI EI was measured in correlation with left insular activity. The subjects were shown various pictures of facial expressions and tasked with deciding to approach or avoid the person in the picture. The results of the social decision task yielded that individuals with high EI scores had left insular activation when processing fearful faces. Individuals with low EI scores had left insular activation when processing angry faces.  Emotions  The insular cortex, in particular its most anterior portion, is considered a limbic-related cortex. The insula has increasingly become the focus of attention for its role in body representation and subjective emotional experience. In particular, Antonio Damasio has proposed that this region plays a role in mapping visceral states that are associated with emotional experience, giving rise to conscious feelings. This is in essence a neurobiological formulation of the ideas of William James, who first proposed that subjective emotional experience (i.e., feelings) arise from our brain's interpretation of bodily states that are elicited by emotional events. This is an example of embodied cognition. In terms of function, the insula is believed to process convergent information to produce an emotionally relevant context for sensory experience. To be specific, the anterior insula is related more to olfactory, gustatory, viscero-autonomic, and limbic function, whereas the posterior insula is related more to auditory-somesthetic-skeletomotor function. Functional imaging experiments have revealed that the insula has an important role in pain experience and the experience of a number of basic emotions, including anger, fear, disgust, happiness, and sadness. The anterior insular cortex (AIC) is believed to be responsible for emotional feelings, including maternal and romantic love, anger, fear, sadness, happiness, sexual arousal, disgust, aversion, unfairness, inequity, indignation, uncertainty, disbelief, social exclusion, trust, empathy, sculptural beauty, a ‚Äòstate of union with God‚Äô, and hallucinogenic states. Functional imaging studies have also implicated the insula in conscious desires, such as food craving and drug craving. What is common to all of these emotional states is that they each change the body in some way and are associated with highly salient subjective qualities. The insula is well-situated for the integration of information relating to bodily states into higher-order cognitive and emotional processes. The insula receives information from \\"homeostatic afferent\\" sensory pathways via the thalamus and sends output to a number of other limbic-related structures, such as the amygdala, the ventral striatum, and the orbitofrontal cortex, as well as to motor cortices. A study using magnetic resonance imaging found that the right anterior insula is significantly thicker in people that meditate. Other research into brain activity and meditation has shown an increase in grey matter in areas of the brain including the insular cortex. Another study using voxel-based morphometry and MRI on experienced Vipassana meditators was done to extend the findings of Lazar et al., which found increased grey matter concentrations in this and other areas of the brain in experienced meditators. The strongest evidence against a causative role for the insula cortex in emotion comes from Damasio et al. (2012) which showed that a patient who suffered bilateral lesions of the insula cortex expressed the full complement of human emotions, and was fully capable of emotional learning. Salience Functional neuroimaging research suggests the insula is involved in two types of salience. Interoceptive information processing that links interoception with emotional salience to generate a subjective representation of the body. This involves, first, the anterior insular cortex with the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (Brodmann area 33) and the anterior and posterior mid- cingulate cortices, and, second, a general salience network concerned with environmental monitoring, response selection, and skeletomotor body orientation that involves all of the insular cortex and the mid-cingulate cortex. An alternative or perhaps complementary proposal is that the right anterior insular regulates the interaction between the salience of the selective attention created to achieve a task (the dorsal attention system) and the salience of arousal created to keep focused upon the relevant part of the environment (ventral attention system). This regulation of salience might be particularly important during challenging tasks where attention might fatigue and so cause careless mistakes but if there is too much arousal it risks creating poor performance by turning into anxiety.  Auditory perception  Recent research indicates that the insular cortex is involved in auditory perception. Responses to sound stimuli were obtained using intracranial EEG recordings acquired from patients with epilepsy. The posterior part of the insula showed auditory responses that resemble those observed in Heschl‚Äôs gyrus, whereas the anterior part responded to the emotional contents of the auditory stimuli. Direct recordings from the posterior part of the insula showed responses to unexpected sounds within regular auditory streams, a process known as auditory deviance detection. Researchers observed a mismatch negativity (MMN) potential, a well known event related potential, as well as the high frequency activity signals originating from local neurons. Simple auditory illusions and hallucinations were elicited by electrical functional mapping.  Clinical significance = Progressive expressive aphasia  Progressive expressive aphasia is the deterioration of normal language function that causes individuals to lose the ability to communicate fluently while still being able to comprehend single words and intact other non-linguistic cognition. It is found in a variety of degenerative neurological conditions including Pick's disease, motor neuron disease, corticobasal degeneration, frontotemporal dementia, and Alzheimer's disease. It is associated with hypometabolism and atrophy of the left anterior insular cortex.  Addiction  A number of functional brain imaging studies have shown that the insular cortex is activated when drug users are exposed to environmental cues that trigger cravings. This has been shown for a variety of drugs, including cocaine, alcohol, opiates, and nicotine. Despite these findings, the insula has been ignored within the drug addiction literature, perhaps because it is not known to be a direct target of the mesocortical dopamine system, which is central to current dopamine reward theories of addiction. Research published in 2007 has shown that cigarette smokers suffering damage to the insular cortex, from a stroke for instance, have their addiction to cigarettes practically eliminated. These individuals were found to be up to 136 times more likely to undergo a disruption of smoking addiction than smokers with damage in other areas. Disruption of addiction was evidenced by self-reported behavior changes such as quitting smoking less than one day after the brain injury, quitting smoking with great ease, not smoking again after quitting, and having no urge to resume smoking since quitting. The study was conducted on average eight years after the strokes, which opens up the possibility that recall bias could have affected the results. More recent prospective studies, which overcome this limitation, have corroborated these findings This suggests a significant role for the insular cortex in the neurological mechanisms underlying addiction to nicotine and other drugs, and would make this area of the brain a possible target for novel anti-addiction medication. In addition, this finding suggests that functions mediated by the insula, especially conscious feelings, may be particularly important for maintaining drug addiction, although this view is not represented in any modern research or reviews of the subject. A recent study in rats by Contreras et al. corroborates these findings by showing that reversible inactivation of the insula disrupts amphetamine conditioned place preference, an animal model of cue-induced drug craving. In this study, insula inactivation also disrupted \\"malaise\\" responses to lithium chloride injection, suggesting that the representation of negative interoceptive states by the insula plays a role in addiction. However, in this same study, the conditioned place preference took place immediately after the injection of amphetamine, suggesting that it is the immediate, pleasurable interoceptive effects of amphetamine administration, rather than the delayed, aversive effects of amphetamine withdrawal that are represented within the insula. A model proposed by Naqvi et al. (see above) is that the insula stores a representation of the pleasurable interoceptive effects of drug use (e.g., the airway sensory effects of nicotine, the cardiovascular effects of amphetamine), and that this representation is activated by exposure to cues that have previously been associated with drug use. A number of functional imaging studies have shown the insula to be activated during the administration of addictive psychoactive drugs. Several functional imaging studies have also shown that the insula is activated when drug users are exposed to drug cues, and that this activity is correlated with subjective urges. In the cue-exposure studies, insula activity is elicited when there is no actual change in the level of drug in the body. Therefore, rather than merely representing the interoceptive effects of drug use as it occurs, the insula may play a role in memory for the pleasurable interoceptive effects of past drug use, anticipation of these effects in the future, or both. Such a representation may give rise to conscious urges that feel as if they arise from within the body. This may make addicts feel as if their bodies need to use a drug, and may result in persons with lesions in the insula reporting that their bodies have forgotten the urge to use, according to this study. Subjective certainty in ecstatic seizures A common quality in mystical experiences is a strong feeling of certainty which cannot be expressed in words. Fabienne Picard proposes a neurological explanation for this subjective certainty, based on clinical research of epilepsy. According to Picard, this feeling of certainty may be caused by a dysfunction of the anterior insula, a part of the brain which is involved in interoception, self- reflection, and in avoiding uncertainty about the internal representations of the world by \\"anticipation of resolution of uncertainty or risk\\". This avoidance of uncertainty functions through the comparison between predicted states and actual states, that is, \\"signaling that we do not understand, i.e., that there is ambiguity.\\"Picard 2013, p.2496-2498 Picard notes that \\"the concept of insight is very close to that of certainty,\\" and refers to Archimedes' \\"Eureka!\\"Picard 2013, p.2497-2498See also satori in Japanese Zen Picard hypothesizes that during ecstatic seizures the comparison between predicted states and actual states no longer functions, and that mismatches between predicted state and actual state are no longer processed, blocking \\"negative emotions and negative arousal arising from predictive uncertainty,\\" which will be experienced as emotional confidence.Picard 2013, p.2498 Picard concludes that \\"[t]his could lead to a spiritual interpretation in some individuals.\\" Other clinical conditions The insular cortex has been suggested to have a role in anxiety disorders, emotion dysregulation, and anorexia nervosa. History The insula was first described by Johann Christian Reil while describing cranial and spinal nerves and plexuses. Henry Gray in Gray's Anatomy is responsible for it being known as the Island of Reil. John Allman and colleagues showed that anterior insular cortex contains spindle neurons.

Its members claim lineal descent from the biblical King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba. Tradition asserts that the queen gave birth to Menelik I after her biblically described visit to Solomon in Jerusalem. In 1270, the Zagwe dynasty of Ethiopia was overthrown by Yekuno Amlak, who claimed descent from Solomon and reinitiated the Solomonic era of Ethiopia. The dynasty lasted until 1974, ended by a coup d'√©tat and the deposition of Haile Selassie, who was a Solomonic prince through his grandmother.  History  Imperial Standard (obverse) The Solomonic dynasty was a bastion of Judaism and later of Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity. It is claimed that this dynasty ruled Ethiopia as early as the 10th century BC, although there is no historical evidence to support this claim. Records of the dynasty's history were supposedly maintained by the Ethiopian Orthodox monasteries to near antiquity; however, if such records existed, most were lost as a result of the destruction of Orthodox monasteries by the resurgent Judaic Judith I around 960 AD/CE. Yekuno Amlak, an Amhara prince from the old province Bet Amhara, re-established the dynasty, tracing his ancestry to the last Solomonic King of Axum, Dil Na'od (or Anbesa Wudm). The Dynasty re-established itself on 10 Nehas√© 1262 ECA. K. Irvine, \\"Review: The Different Collections of N√§g≈õ Hymns in Ethiopic Literature and Their Contributions.\\" Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London. School of Oriental and African Studies, 1985. (10 August 1270 CE) when Yekuno Amlak overthrew the last ruler of the Zagwe dynasty. Contemporary painting of Yekuno Amlak, Lalibela 13th century Solomonic hand cross. Yekuno Amlak claimed direct male line descent from the old Axumite royal house that the Zagwes had replaced on the throne. Menelik II, and later his daughter Zewditu I, would be the last Ethiopian monarchs who could claim uninterrupted direct male descent from Solomon of Israel and the Queen of Sheba (both Iyasu V and Haile Selassie I were in the female line, Iyasu V through his mother Shewarega Menelik, and Haile Selassie I through his paternal grandmother, Tenagnework Sahle Selassie). The male line, through the descendants of Menelik's cousin Dejazmatch Taye Gulilat, still existed, but had been pushed aside largely because of Menelik's personal distaste for this branch of his family. The Solomonic Dynasty continued to rule Ethiopia with few interruptions until 1974, when the last emperor, Haile Selassie I, was deposed. The royal family is currently non-regnant. Members of the family in Ethiopia at the time of the 1974 revolution were imprisoned; some were executed and others exiled. In 1976, ten great grandchildren of Haile Selassie I were extracted from Ethiopia in an undertaking later detailed in a book by Jodie Collins titled Code Word: Catherine. The women of the dynasty were released by the regime from prison in 1989, and the men were released in 1990. Several members were then allowed to leave the country in mid-1990, and the rest left in 1991 upon the fall of the communist r√©gime. Many members of the Imperial family have since returned to live in Ethiopia. Imperial sarcophagi of the Solomonic dynasty King Haile Selassie I and his wife at the Holy Trinity Cathedral. During much of the dynasty's existence, its effective realm was the northwestern quadrant of present-day Ethiopia, the Ethiopian Highlands. The Empire expanded and contracted over the centuries, sometimes incorporating parts of modern-day Sudan and South Sudan, and coastal areas of the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. Southern and eastern regions were permanently incorporated during the last two centuries, some by Shewan kings and some by Emperors Menelik II and Haile Selassie I; although much of the central and southern regions were previously incorporated into the empire under Amda Seyon I and Zara Yaqob, peripheral areas were lost after the invasion of Ahmad Gragn.Taddesse Tamrat, Church and State in Ethiopia (1270-1527) (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1972), p 275. In the modern era, the Imperial dynasty has several cadet branches. The elder Gondarine Amhara line, starting with Susenyos in 1606 (although often credited to his son Fasilides who established his capital at Gondar) ended its rule with the fall of the largely powerless Yohannes III in 1855 and the coming to power of Tewodros II, whose later claims of Solomonic descent were never widely accepted. Following Tewodros, Wagshum Gobeze claimed the throne linking himself to the last independent Gondare emperors through his mother, Aychesh Tedla, a descendant of Iyasu I, and reigned as emperor of Ethiopia with the title Tekle Giorgis II for some years, highly investing in the renovation of churches and monuments in Gondar. Being also an heir to the Zagwe throne, his reign was meant to be a unification of both dynasties in the enthronement of a king bearing both lineages. Tekle Giorgis II fought a battle with the Tigrean Claimant Kassai Mercha (Yohannes IV), and the latter, who had retrieved superior weaponry and armament from the British in return for his assistance in the defeat of Tewodros II, would be able to defeat Tekle Giorgis II's army, imprisoning and killing him. The Tigrean line came to power briefly with the enthronement of Yohannes IV in 1872, and although this line did not persist on the Imperial throne after the Emperor was killed in battle with the Mahdists in 1889, the heirs of this cadet branch ruled Tigre until the revolution of 1974 toppled the Ethiopian monarchy. The Tigrean Cadet branch (along with its various sub-branches) traces its lineage to the main Solomonic line of Emperors through at least two female lines. The more recent link was through Woizero Aster Iyasu (wife of Ras Mikael Sehul, daughter of Mentewab and her lover, Melmal Iyasu, a Solomonic prince and nephew of Mentewab's late husband Bakaffa). Prince Asfa-Wossen Asserate, a member of the Solomonic dynasty. The Shewan line was next on the Imperial throne with the coronation of Menelik II, previously Menelik King of Shewa, in 1889. The Shewan Branch of the Imperial Solomonic dynasty, like the Gondarine line, could trace uninterrupted male line descent from King Yekonu Amlak, though Abeto Negassi Yisaq, the grandson of Dawit II by his youngest son Abeto Yaqob. The direct male line ended with Menelik II ‚Äì who was succeeded first by the son of his daughter Lij Iyasu from 1913 to 1916, then by his daughter Zewditu until 1930, and finally by the son of a first cousin in the female line, Haile Selassie I. Haile Selassie's reign lasted until 1974, when the dynasty was removed from power. His grandson Prince Zera Yacob is his legal heir and therefore the current head of the imperial dynasty. The Shewan branch has several sub-branches, most notably the Selalle line established by Menelik II's uncle Ras Darge. The oldest junior cadet branch of the Solomonic Dynasty is the Gojjam branch which traces its ancestry through various lines of the main branch of the Solomonic dynasty. One of the more prominent lines comes from Princess Walata Israel, the daughter of Melmal Iyasu and Empress Mentewab. She would later marry Dejazmach Yosedek who would later give rise to the Gojam Imperial House by way of their child \\"Talaku\\" Ras Hailu. The Princes of Gojam which include Ras Merid Hailu ( son of Ras Hailu Yosedek), Ras Goshu Zewde, Tekle Haymanot of Gojjam, Dejazmach Tadla Gwalu and Ras Desta Tadla all claim royal blood through the main Gonder Imperial House through Empress Mentewab and the Solomonic Prince Melmal Iyasu. Its most recent members include Tekle Haimanot King of Gojjam, his son Leul Ras Hailu Tekle Haimanot, who was the most senior Ethiopian noble who submitted to the Italian occupation of 1936‚Äì1941; and his nephew Ras Hailu Belew who was a noted figure in the resistance against the Italian occupation.  Coat of arms  Lion of the Tribe of Judah The Imperial Coat of arms was adopted by Haile Selassie I, and is currently held by his direct heir in the male line, Prince Zera Yacob, and by the Crown Council of Ethiopia. The arms are composed of an Imperial Throne flanked by two angels, one holding a sword and a pair of scales, the other holding the Imperial scepter. The throne is often shown with a Christian cross, and a Star of David, (representing the Christian and Jewish traditions). It is surmounted by a red mantle with the Imperial Crown, and before the throne is the Lion of the Tribe of Judah. The Lion of Judah was the central emblem of the Ethiopian tri-color flag during the reign of the monarchy, and now serves as the chief symbol of the Ethiopian monarchist movement. The Lion of Judah has also been adopted as the leading religious symbol for the Rastafari movement (a Western, African diaspora movement) that regards Emperor Haile Selassie as divine. The phrase \\"Moa Ambassa ze imnegede Yehuda\\", (Conquering Lion of the Tribe of Judah) appeared on the arms, and always preceded the Emperor's official style and titles. The official Imperial Dynastic motto was \\"Ityopia tabetsih edewiha habe Igziabiher\\" (Ethiopia stretches her hands unto God), a quote from the . The full title of the Emperor of Ethiopia was Negusa Nagast and Seyoume Igziabeher (Ge'ez: ·à•·ã©·àò ·ä•·åç·ãö·ä†·â•·àî·à≠; \\"Elect of God\\"). The title Moa Anbessa Ze Imnegede Yehuda (\\"Conquering Lion of the Tribe of Judah\\") always preceded the titles of the Emperor. It was not a personal title but rather referred to the title of Jesus and placed the office of Christ ahead of the Emperor's name in an act of Imperial submission. Until the reign of Yohannes IV, the Emperor was also Neguse Tsion(Ge'ez: ·äï·åâ·à† ·åΩ·ãÆ·äï, 'n…ôgus√§ tsiyon)', \\"King of Zion\\"), whose seat was at Axum, and which conferred hegemony over much of the north of the Empire (See: Ethiopian aristocratic and court titles).Vadala, Alexander Atillio (2011). \\"Elite Distinction and Regime Change: The Ethiopian Case\\".

Developed by Renault from 1932, the type was ordered by the French Cavalry in 1933; a total of 123 would be built until 1935. The AMR 33 was lightly armed and armoured; though it was very fast for its day, it proved to be a mechanically unreliable vehicle, especially its suspension elements being too weak. It was therefore succeeded by an improved type, the AMR 35. Though its name might suggest otherwise, the AMR 33 was not a scout vehicle and mostly was not equipped with a radio set. The AMR 33s were intended to form a large mass of light tanks, preceding the medium types into battle. In reality they never served as such; by the time enough medium tanks were produced to form armoured divisions, the AMR 33 had already been replaced by the AMR 35 and was limited to the Cavalry Divisions and in 1940 to the Cavalry Light Divisions to provide fire support to motorised infantry and dismounted cavalry. In the Battle of France of 1940 the AMR 33s were quickly lost. Some captured vehicles were for the duration of the war used by Germany. Development To counter the threat posed by the massive Soviet arms build- up since 1928, the year Joseph Stalin took power, the French government on 4 July 1930 conceived the plan to form a projection force capable of assisting its allies in the Cordon sanitaire. This force would have to consist of five motorised infantry divisions and the five existing cavalry divisions, one brigade of each of which would have to be motorised. In 1934 the 4th Cavalry Division would have to be transformed into an armoured division. The plan called for the introduction of many specialised vehicles, among which was an Automitrailleuse de Cavalerie type Reconnaissance (AMR), specified on 16 January 1932 as a vehicle of three tons, armed with a light machine gun and having a range of 200 kilometres. Automitrailleuse was then the generalised term for any light armoured fighting vehicle armed with a machine gun and was also used to indicate a cavalry tank, as by law tanks (Chars) had to be part of the Infantry. Although the name might suggest otherwise, an AMR was not a specialised reconnaissance vehicle but a skirmisher without a radio. The gathering and reporting of information was the task of an AMD (Automitrailleuse de D√©couverte). In anticipation Louis Renault had early November 1931 already begun to design a tracteur l√©ger de cavalerie type VM based on his Renault UE tractor. On 12 November the first drawings were examined and rejected because the vehicle in its proposed form was much too cramped. A larger hull was clearly necessary but Renault was hesitant to invest in it without the prospect of a possible order. On 21 November he was asked by the Section Technique de la Cavalerie to provide a tankette version of his Renault UE to test the feasibility of a tracked AMR-concept. Being hereby informed of the general outlines of the specifications, he sent on 22 December a representative to supreme commander Maxime Weygand to lobby for a Renault AMR. Weygand informed him that it had informally been decided to procure the AMR Citro√´n K√©gresse P 28, a half-track made by Renault's competitor Citro√´n. After much deliberation however the General that very day committed himself to take a Renault tank into consideration. That commitment being secured, Renault hastily designed a larger model, a wooden mock-up of which was presented in March 1932. Based on it an order was made on 20 April of five prototypes for a price of 171,250 FF per vehicle, to be delivered in September before the start of the autumn Champagne manoeuvres. The Cavalry saw this as a pre-series to obtain a platoon to be used for its very first trials with a mechanised unit. Renault however decided to provide each with a different suspension type, to lower the risk that his design would be found wanting. All were generally based on the Carden Loyd type that Renault had simply copied for his Renault UE ‚Äì without paying any licence rights ‚Äì and used the standard Renault Reinastella engine. As there simply wasn't time to fully develop all types before the autumn, in July the five vehicles, with military registration numbers 79756 to 79760, were delivered with the simplest one: two leaf springs on each side didn't spring the suspension units, they were the suspension units. In September the tanks were united in the first French Cavalry mechanised unit ever: the experimental D√©tachement M√©canique de S√ªret√©. The experience showed that they were very agile, but also noisy, poorly balanced and lacking sufficient range; unsurprisingly, the crew was always in for a bumpy ride. After the exercise they were sent back to Renault, who shortly afterwards submitted three types for evaluation to the Commission d'Exp√©riences du Mat√©riel Automobile at Vincennes: prototype 79758, still with the original suspension, 79759 with added internal hydraulic dampers and 79760 with a fully new suspension consisting of a central bogie with a leaf spring and wheels at the front and the back connected to two horizontal helical springs. In November and December 1932 the \\"Commission de Vincennes\\" tested them, using as reference changed specifications determined on 10 June 1932. They were found to have a sufficient speed (56.25 ‚Äì 60 km/h), but an insufficient range of 166 - 188 kilometres and to be too heavy with a weight of 4.8 tons. On 8 December it was decided to abandon the unrealistic three ton weight limit and install larger fuel tanks and heavier armour; the vehicles were again sent back. In April 1933 Renault submitted two types, fitted with 0.5 ton weights simulating an up-armouring from nine to thirteen millimetres maximum: 79758 rebuilt with a horizontal rubber spring suspension and 79757 fitted with a suspension derived from that of 79760, but now with a central vertical spring and the casings of the horizontal springs filled with oil to make them act as dampers. They were tested until June 1933 and, against the strong advice of Renault favouring the rubber springs, on 6 June a production was ordered for prototype 79757 as the AMR Renault mod√®le 1933 or AMR 33. The Renault factory identifier was Renault VM. Production On 8 March 1933 the Cavalry had already made a preliminary order of 45 for whatever type would be chosen. This was confirmed on 22 June together with a second order of twenty vehicles, deliveries were to start no later than 1 July. In the autumn a third order was made of fifty. The first vehicle was only delivered on 1 June 1934 however, due to financial difficulties; the last of the 115 in September. The production of the Citro√´n half-track was limited to fifty. It was decided to rebuild the original prototypes into standard vehicles; however in fact two were used to develop the AMR 35, an improved model that was necessary because the too-fragile suspension of the AMR 33 was prone to break down (or even simply to break off) and engine noise was excessive. Prototype 79758 was used to test several other improved configurations. To compensate three more AMR 33's were built in the Spring of 1935 for a total of 123, including all prototypes. The chassis that was used for the development of the Engin P, a project for a 37 mm gun equipped tank destroyer, is not included in this number. Description The AMR 33 at Saumur The AMR 33 was a very small vehicle, long, wide and tall. It weighed only 5.5 metric tonnes; the unloaded weight of the hull 4.5 tonnes. The eight-cylinder 84 hp 4241 cc Renault Nervasport 24 CV engine allowed for an official maximum speed of ‚Äì the Renault export brochure claimed and an off-road speed of . A Cleveland differential was used; there were four forward and one reverse gears. A fuel tank of allowed for a range of 200 km. The tracks were 22 centimetres wide. It had a wading capacity of sixty centimetres; could cross a trench wide, or climb a vertical obstacle or a 50% slope. Details of the turret The (riveted) armour of all vertical plates was 13 mm, of all inclined plates 9 mm, of the top 6 mm and of the bottom 5 mm. There was a crew of two: the driver to the left next to the engine and the tank commander/gunner behind him in the turret which was armed with a 7.5 mm Reibel machine gun. There was also a reserve machine gun that could be optionally placed on a pedestal on top of the turret for defence against aircraft. The original proposal had foreseen the use of a special expensive Schneider turret; the prototypes had a very high octagonal Renault turret at the very back of the hull. This proved to be too awkward and was replaced on the series vehicles by a flatter design from the army Atelier de Vincennes, the AVIS-1, which was moved about a foot to the front to improve visibility. The AVIS was produced by Renault and had, unusually for a French tank turret of the thirties, a hatch in the top for observation. The normal access to the tank was by means of large double hatch at the back of the hull. Operational history The 115 vehicles available in 1934 were first assigned to the five cavalry divisions, a squadron of fifteen (three platoons of four, two reserve tanks and a command tank) for the GAM (Groupe d'Automitrailleuses) of each, except 5e DC which got ten and 4e DC which, all with priority from the first production batch, received forty: a squadron for its 4e GAM and its 18e Dragons and another ten for its 4e BDP (Bataillon de Dragons Port√©s). In 1935 5e DC received the three rebuilt prototypes, bringing its strength to thirteen. AMR 33s were also allocated to two independent cavalry regiments: 9e Dragons which received eight from the first batch of 65 and 11e Chasseurs which received twelve from the second batch of fifty. The organic strength thus equalled the total AMR 33 fleet. The r√¥le of the AMR 33s in the cavalry divisions was largely that of direct support of the dismounted horsemen. In 1935 it was decided to transform 4e DC into an armoured division in case of war. For its sole tanks this division would have had six squadrons equipped with the AMR 33. Its fighting power would thus have been very limited indeed. Both in 1936 and 1937 however a real armoured division was created, first from 4e DC and then from 5e DC. These 1 DLM and 2 DLM (Division L√©g√®re M√©canique or \\"Mechanised Light Division\\") had three squadrons of AMRs each to accompany their motorized infantry (among many other types). At that time however the mechanical unreliability of the AMR 33 had become obvious and it was decided only to use the AMR 35 in the Cavalry armoured divisions, concentrating the AMR 33s into the remaining DCs. Each of these would now have a larger RAM (R√©giment d'Automitailleuses) with two AMR squadrons, these again enlarged to four platoons of five plus two reserve tanks and a command tank. Total division AMR strength would thus be 46. As there were three divisions however, their need for 138 vehicles could not be met by the existing numbers of AMR 33s. Therefore 1re DC was to use the AMR 35 and the only units deploying the AMR 33 remained 2e DC and 3e DC. At the outbreak of the Second World War, France participating from 2 September 1939, total organic AMR 33 strength was still 92. However, to create a larger number of motorised units, from 1 December 1939 till 15 February 1940 the last two cavalry divisions were disbanded and their personnel and mat√©riel, supplemented with discarded older mat√©riel from the former cavalry divisions, was redistributed among five new Divisions L√©g√®res de Cavalerie (\\"Cavalry Light Divisions\\"). It was first decided that these within each of the two battalions of their R√©giment de Dragons Port√©s (motorised infantry regiment) would incorporate two AMR 33 platoons (half a squadron), which, together with two reserve tanks and a command tank, would create a demand for five times 23 or 115 vehicles, slightly lower than the available total of 118. In view of the poor general maintenance condition of the type this was again changed: the 1re DLC would use the AMR 35 instead and the other four DLCs would increase their strength to 26 by adding three reserve tanks; apart from this organic total strength of 104 a general mat√©riel reserve of fourteen would thus be created. On 10 May, the day of the German invasion, this measure was shown to have been still insufficient. Only 5e DLC had its official strength of 26, the other three divisions having apparently not yet started to make an attempt to increase their strength: 2e DLC fielded 22 AMR 33s, 3e DLC twenty and 4e DLC 23, for a total strength of 91. There was thus a mat√©riel reserve of 22 vehicles. In the Battle of France the type fared very badly. The DLCs in the Ardennes unexpectedly encountered the main German armoured force and could only fight a delaying battle for which the AMR 33 was not very useful. It was poorly armed and armoured ‚Äì and very unreliable because of its one good point: its speed which wore out the suspension units. It was faster than any German tank of the time. Around 10:00 on 10 May near Vanc√©, AMR 33 N¬∞ 83950 of 3e DLC had the dubious distinction of being the first French tank to be destroyed in the battle, being hit by German anti-tank gunfire, killing the crew. During the first week of the fighting 75% of the AMR 33s was lost, often because of a breakdown. On 7 June 1940 the 7e DLM was created, an emergency unit, of which 4e RAM was part. That regiment had an allocation of fourteen AMRs; to this number probably nine AMR 33s belonged from the mat√©riel reserve. All these vehicles would again be lost before the armistice of 25 June. Some captured AMR 33s were used by the Germans as the Panzersp√§hwagen VM 701 (f), probably mostly in France itself. A single vehicle survives at the Mus√©e des Blind√©s at Saumur. Projects and variants=AMR 33 TSF In 1934, the three command vehicles of the GAM of 4e DC were rebuilt as AMR 33 TSF (T√©l√©graphie Sans Fil or \\"wireless\\") by fitting them with an ER29 radio set, the antenna of which was placed on the left back corner of the hull. It is unknown whether any other command tanks were so modified. Modernisation Already in 1934 it became obvious that Renault had been right in advising to select a different suspension type. The standard one proved to be much too flimsy and especially the oil shock dampers were very maintenance intensive. Both the three vehicles built in 1935 and the two rebuilt prototypes were therefore fitted with an improved AMR 35 suspension type with rubber cylinders. Prototype 79758 had been used to test three different systems: the first with the trailer wheel touching the ground, the second with five road wheels and the last was the one selected. The second type would form the basis for the Renault ZB, a lengthened export version, destined for China. After continuing reports regarding the unreliability of the mat√©riel ‚Äì often ascribed to the fact that not professional drivers but half-trained conscripts were the most frequent users ‚Äì it was decided to investigate whether structural changes had to be made. Accordingly, the type was again tested by the Commission de Vincennes between 8 September 1936 and 5 May 1937. The commission concluded on 17 February 1938 that the suspension was fundamentally unsuited for cross-country driving and advised that all existing vehicles be fitted with a new system. When war broke out, it was decided to improve readiness by fully revising all AMR 33s. During that process they were to be refitted with the new suspension. About half a dozen vehicles had been so modified on 10 May. Type M Late in 1932 ‚Äì this is known by a later confirming letter dated 18 December 1932 ‚Äì Renault had a meeting with General Weygand, during which he proposed to develop an entire family of light armoured fighting vehicles based on the AMR 33-chassis. He was especially interested in producing a Voiture l√©g√®re de transport de personnel, an armoured personnel carrier capable of transporting four to five infantrymen and having a crew of two and a 19 CV engine. As there was an insufficient budget to equip even a limited part of the Infantry with fully tracked vehicles this plan was abandoned, but on 20 March 1933 Renault received an order from the STMAC (Section Technique des Mat√©riels Automobiles de Combat) to develop a prototype of a different design discussed with Weygand: a command vehicle corresponding to the specifications of 9 January 1931 for a so-called Type M. In September 1933 two prototypes were presented in Mailly, which were rebuilt with a more powerful 22 CV engine in 1934. In January of that year it had been decided to order ten of these, but to use the chassis of the AMR 35 instead. The second prototype would be used in the autumn of 1936 to develop the Renault YS artillery observation vehicle, the production vehicles of which would however also be based on the AMR 35 chassis. Engin P On 9 January 1931 the French Artillery officially issued the specifications for a Type P, which was to be a v√©hicule antichar, a self-propelled antitank-gun, that was to serve in the Maginot Line as a tank destroyer. On that date Renault, who had been informed of the plans about a year earlier, had already begun to develop a prototype. The first plans foresaw a very small tracked vehicle, a chenillette, weighing no more than 1.5 metric tonnes, on which a 25 mm antitank-gun was to be mounted on a tripod in an open position. The gun would have to be removable, so that it also could be placed on the ground after having been transported by the vehicle. However, the same year it was decided to let the 25 mm gun be towed by the Renault UE chenillette, making the Type P redundant in its original scope. The Artillery therefore decided to mount, under armour, a much more powerful 37 mm Mod√®le 1934 fortress gun with a muzzle velocity of 860 m/s, which yet had to be developed by the Atelier de Puteaux, the State armament arsenal. In 1932 Renault delivered a prototype, a specially built AMR 33 chassis (N¬∞ 81805), that in general form resembled the standard AMR 33. A turret was absent however, and the hull roof had been raised. In the middle of the front of the superstructure there was room for a gun; to the left of it the driver was to be seated. Almost all available space was then occupied; this was solved by letting the gun loader sit on the floor, with his outstretched legs below the gun breech. In this cramped position he was supposed to load the weapon, taking with his right hand rounds from a stock of 107 shells, that had been positioned on the left back of the hull, where in the standard AMR 33 the back exit hatch was located. The third crew member, the commander, sat on the right, squeezed between the hull roof and the engine; he had hardly any headroom. The Puteaux workshop only finished the prototype, now named the Engin P, in the Spring of 1935. After the gun was placed, it weighed 4565 kilogrammes and had a maximum speed of 54.1 km/h. On 18 April 1935 the CEMAV (Commission d'Exp√©riences du Mat√©riel Automobile de Vincennes), after testing, expressed a very negative opinion: \\"An ancient and outdated model [...] incapable of rendering serious service\\". Moreover, on 24 June the Conseil Consultatif de l'Armement decided that in future all guns up to a calibre of 47 mm would have to be towed by the Renault UE after modifying the latter type (though this in fact never happened). As a result, the Engin P was rejected. Renault YI In the years 1932 and 1933 Renault developed a series of three unarmoured military caterpillar tractors. The smallest of these, the tracteur de 2 tonnes with the factory designation Renault YI, largely used the AMR 33 suspension, though the sprocket was not spoked but consisted of a single convex plate. The vehicle had an open cargo room behind, the engine in front and the cabin in between. The French Ministry of War ordered two vehicles of each type. The Trench-Jumper AMR 33 prototype N¬∞ 78758 was used in 1935 by the engineer Nicolas Straussler, a former citizen of Austria- Hungary who at the time lived in the United Kingdom, to demonstrate his hydraulic \\"Trench-Jumper\\" that he already had tested in England. He had proposed the system in 1933 to the French Army and the Atelier et Chantier de la Loire had obtained an exemplar. The contraption consisted of two large hydraulic arms that were to be fitted on the front and back of a vehicle. The arm in front would secure itself on the opposite bank of a trench to be crossed, preventing the tank from falling in. The tank would then drive over the trench, folding the forward arm, while the back arm would lodge itself on the bank of departure and unfold, pushing the vehicle safely across. In this way a trench two metres wide could be crossed. The system was tested on 3 April 1935 and 21 March, 30 April and 4 May 1936 and finally in March 1938. It proved to be quite effective but in 1938 the Commission de Vincennes rejected the project as the small gain in trench-crossing capacity did not make up for the higher weight. Smoke-laying tank In 1938 a smoke-laying system was tested, using the AMR 33. An AM5 apparatus was fitted by the Chaubeyre factory. It was not taken into production, despite a favourable report by the Section Technique de la Cavalerie.

After hearing rumours that other directors were planning films with a small number of shots, Maddin decided that his film would instead contain over 100 shots per minute, and enough plot for a feature-length film. Maddin then wrote and shot The Heart of the World in the style of Russian constructivism, taking the commission at its literal face value, as a call to produce a propaganda film. Even in its expanded, 6-minute version, The Heart of the World runs at a breakneck speed, averaging roughly two shots per second, a pace intensified by the background music, Time, Forward! by Georgy Sviridov.  Plot summary  The plot of The Heart of the World concerns two brothers, Osip and Nikolai, who compete for the love of the same woman: Anna, a state scientist studying the Earth's core. Anna discovers that the heart of the world is in danger of a fatal heart attack (which would mean the end of the world), and the brothers compete amongst the public panic. Nikolai is a mortician and tries to impress Anna with assembly-line embalming, while Osip is an actor playing Christ in the Passion Play and tries to impress Anna through his suffering.

It is located on the grounds of the Curtea de Arge»ô Monastery, and is dedicated to Dormition of the Mother of God. The building is the seat of the Archdiocese of Arge»ô and Muscel. The cathedral is faced with pale grey limestone, which was easily chiselled then hardened on exposure. The interior is of brick, plastered and decorated with frescoes. Nearby on the grounds stands the large Neo-Romanian style Royal Palace built in late 19th century. Architecture Back view The aghiasmatar (holy water basin) pavilion in front of the Cathedral The building resembles a very large and elaborate mausoleum, and was built in the Byzantine architectural style, with arabesques. The cathedral sits upon a raised platform, above the surrounding grade, and encircled by a stone balustrade. In shape the structure is oblong, with a many-sided annex at the back. A dome rises in the center, fronted by two smaller twisting and leaning cupolas, while a secondary dome, broader and loftier than the central one, springs from the annex. Each summit is crowned by an inverted pear-shaped stone, bearing a triple cross, emblematic of the Trinity. The windows are mere slits; those of the tambours (the cylinders on which the cupolas rest) are curved and slant at an angle of 70 degrees, as though the tambours were leaning to one side. Between the pediment and the cornice a thick corded moulding is carried round the main building. Above this comes a row of circular shields, adorned with intricate arabesques, while bands and wreaths of lilies are everywhere sculptured on the windows, balconies, tambours and cornices, adding lightness to the fabric. Facing the main entrance is a small open shrine, consisting of a cornice and dome upheld by four pillars. Inscriptions The archives of the cathedral were plundered by Hungarians and Turks, but several inscriptions, Greek, Slav, and Roman, are left. One tablet records that the founders were Prince Neagoe Basarab (1512-1521) and his wife Milica Despina of Wallachia; another that Prince Ioan Radu completed the work in 1526; a third describes the repairs executed in 1681 by Prince »òerban Cantacuzino; a fourth, the restoration, in 1804, by Joseph, the first bishop. Between 1875 and 1885 the cathedral was reconstructed, and in 1886 it was reconsecrated.  Legends  Legends of Curtea de Arge»ô have inspired many Romanian poets, among them the celebrated Vasile Alecsandri. One traditional legend describes how Neagoe Basarab, while a hostage in Constantinople, designed a splendid mosque for the sultan, returning to build the cathedral out of the surplus materials. ;Manole legend A legend tells of Radu Negru employing a Me≈üterul Manole or Manoli as architect. With Manole being unable to finish the walls, the prince threatened him and his assistants with death. At last Manole suggested that they should follow the ancient custom of placing a living woman into the foundations; and that she who first appeared on the following morning should be the victim. The other masons warned their families, and Manole was forced to sacrifice his own wife. Thus the cathedral was built. When Manole and his masons told the prince that they could always build an even greater building, Radu Negru had them stranded on the roof so that they could not build something to match it. They fashioned wooden wings and tried to fly off the roof, but, one by one, they all fell to the ground. A spring of clear water, named after Manole, is said to mark the spot where he fell. This motif is widespread in South-East Europe, most notably also in Russia, like the blinding of the Masons of Saint Basil's Cathedral by Ivan the Terrible.

The Baby New Year is a personification of the start of the New Year commonly seen in editorial cartoons. He symbolizes the \\"birth\\" of the next year and the \\"passing\\" of the prior year; in other words, a \\"rebirth\\". Baby New Year's purpose varies by myth, but he generally performs some sort of ceremonial duty over the course of his year such as chronicling the year's events or presiding over the year as a symbol. Legend The myth most associated with him is that he is a baby at the beginning of his year, but Baby New Year quickly ages until he is elderly (like Father Time, with whom he is often associated) at the end of his year. Very rarely is the Baby New Year depicted as any age other than a baby or as a very old man. Some stories, especially those with depictions of years past, will have him bear a strong likeness to key events in his time.Rudolph's Shiny New Year; https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073640/ At this point, he hands over his duties to the next Baby New Year, while he either dies or remains in this state and retires. Representation The stereotypical representation of Baby New Year is as a baby boy wearing nothing more than a diaper, a top hat and a sash across his torso that shows the year he is representing (e.g. 2019). He is sometimes depicted holding or associated with an hourglass, a noisemaker, or other item either pertaining to time or New Year's Day festivities. Often, he is not a complete newborn but instead more closely resembles a toddler, because he is frequently shown standing on his own, crawling or barely walking, or having a small amount of (usually blond) hair. Baby New Year title In addition to being a mythical figure, the title of \\"Baby New Year\\" is sometimes given to living people. The first baby born in any village or city in a certain year may be honored by being labeled as the official Baby New Year for that year. The official Baby New Year can be male or female, even though the mythical Baby New Year is nearly always male. Attempts to name an official Baby New Year for an entire country have sometimes been made, but generally there are multiple contenders and no single Baby New Year can be confirmed. There has however been a great deal of several who have come close. Numerous hospitals no longer make a Baby New Year public due to concerns that the infant will become a target for criminals.First baby of 2015? It's a secret in many places . Associated Press.

Happy ran away due to being laughed at because of his big ears which he wears under his top hat.

In an interview with Inside Higher Education in October 2009, where he presents public university education as vital but in need of change to survive successfully, he talks of four main areas of change that need to be addressed: *He sees public universities becoming autonomous through deregulation, run by independent trustees who decide educational and financial policies. *He argues that taxpayers' money should support less-well-off students through scholarships, not subsidize campuses; higher income students would pay more, lower income less. Best value schools would prosper and overall student numbers would rise. Research, low-enrollment, and vital programs would be protected. *He sees university personnel cost as being the largest area of budget. Efficiency should be increased through voluntary financial incentives, and reducing committee sizes and numbers. *He believes that candidate selection of senior administrators, presidents and chancellors by search committees and vested interests is inefficient and ineffective, and should operate more like private-sector universities. He also argues that state governors who typically appoint trustees should be educated about how to select qualified and effective candidates.Inside Higher Education: Saving Alma Mater, 23 October 2009, retrieved 15 March 2011 Garland's views were acknowledged in The New York Times.Review: Saving Alma Mater The New York Times, 29 December 2009, retrieved 15 March 2011 He spoke on topics raised in Saving Alma Mater at the University of Cincinnati,Saving Alma Mater: University of Cincinnati: speech by J.C.

The walls of Lima in a plan of 1750 Muralla, Casco Antiguo de Lima The Walls of Lima were a fortification consisting mainly of walls and bastions whose purpose was to defend the city of Lima from exterior attacks. It was built between 1684 and 1687, during the Viceroy Melchor de Navarra y Rocafull (Duke of Palata)'s government. The wall was located on the present streets of Alfonso Ugarte, Paseo Col√≥n and Grau and the left bank of R√≠mac River. Under Luis Castaneda Lossio's management, he recovered a section of the remains of the left bank of the R√≠mac River, which are now visible as a part of the group known as \\"Parque de la Muralla,\\" although these are probably from a previous construction known as \\"Tajamar de San Francisco.\\" The Santa Luc√≠a bastion is a sector of the wall located on the edge of Barrios Altos and El Agustino that still stands .wall-of-lime-santa- lucia Marco Gamarra (2010). \\"The last wall of Lima: Santa Luc√≠a\\", The Marquense Library History Map of the City of the Kings in 1744 which was public in the work of Jorge Juan and Antonio de Ulloa. Gate of Maravillas which gave access to the fortified Lima Aspect of the Gate of Callao, located in the Ovalo de la Reina, in 1870 The old wall was built around the city to protect it from pirates attacks and other enemies of the Spanish crown in the 17th century. The wall had 10 exit and entry gates: Martinete, Maravillas, Barbones, Cocharcas, Santa Catalina, Guadalupe, Juan Sim√≥n, San Jacinto, Callao, Monserrate and the gate of la Gu√≠a en el Barrio de San L√°zaro (now the R√≠mac district). As part of urban expansion programs and construction of new avenues, the wall was demolished in 1868 under Jos√© Balta's government. The wall never served the purpose for which it was built, to the point that Ra√∫l Porras Barrenechea mentioned that \\"it died a virgin of gunpowder.\\" Current status Part of the sea wall has been restored at the back of the Church of San Francisco, near the Government Palace, which has created a public space named Parque de la Muralla (The Wall Park). In this park, the remnants of the foundations that had been the seawall are visible, which was done by the Franciscans in 1610. The aforementioned park has a restaurant and a shop selling hand-made items from different areas of the country. The park contains a statue of Francisco Pizarro, which used to be in the \\"Plaza Per√∫,\\" located next to the Government Palace. There is also a museum exhibiting archaeological pieces found in the area. Construction of an expressway on Grau Avenue uncovered some of the wall's remains. In Barrios Altos, the remains of the walls near the Plazuela del Cercado is in good condition. The camal de Conchucos, which was the bastion of Santa Luc√≠a, one of the surveillance points of the wall, is now a sports complex. The wall was not a paragon of beauty. Except for the portals of Maravillas (1807) in the Barrios Altos and El Callao, the other gates, as told by the painter Juan Manuel Ugarte, \\"had no great artistic appeal.

Viva, vive, and vivat are interjections used in the Romance languages. Viva in Spanish, Portuguese, and Italian, Vive in French, and Vivat in Latin are subjunctive forms of the verb \\"to live\\". Being the third-person, subjunctive present conjugation, the terms express a hope on the part of the speaker that another should live. Thus, they mean \\"(may) he/she/it live!\\" (the word \\"may\\" is implied by the subjunctive mood) and are usually translated to English as \\"long live\\". They are often used to salute a person or non-personal entity: \\"Vive le Qu√©bec libre\\" (from Charles de Gaulle's Vive le Qu√©bec libre speech in Montreal), or \\"Viva il Duce!\\", the rough equivalent in Fascist Italy of the greeting, \\"Heil Hitler.\\" Additionally, in monarchical times the king of France would be wished \\"Vive le Roi!\\" and the king of Italy \\"Viva il Re!\\", both meaning \\"May the king live!\\" or \\"Long live the king!\\". Overview The acclamation \\"Vivat!\\" is still used in British coronations when the sovereign is hailed while processing from the quire of Westminster Abbey towards the coronation theatre, fronting the altar. The shouts are delivered by the King or Queen's Scholars of Westminster School, who by tradition are the first to acclaim the sovereign at the ceremony. This was last performed when Queen Elizabeth II was crowned in 1953; she was greeted with \\"Vivat, Regina! / Vivat, Regina Elizabetha! / Vivat! Vivat! Vivat!\\", which was incorporated into Hubert Parry's anthem, I was glad. The mediaeval university Latin anthem De Brevitate Vitae has verses like: :Vivat academia! :Vivant professores! :Vivat academia! :Vivant professores! :Vivat membrum quodlibet :Vivant membra quaelibet :Semper sint in flore. In Spanish, for plural subjects, it becomes vivan. Compare ¬°Viva el rey! with ¬°Vivan los reyes!. A frame from the trailer for Viva Zapata!. The Mexican slogan \\"¬°Viva Zapata!\\" was used to title the 1952 English-language biographical drama film Viva Zapata! by Elia Kazan, about Emiliano Zapata. It later inspired the title of 2005 Italian-language documentary film Viva Zapatero!, by Sabina Guzzanti, referring to Jos√© Luis Rodr√≠guez Zapatero. In Italy, the nationalist phrase \\"Viva Vittorio Emanuele Re d'Italia!\\" (\\"Long live Victor Emmanuel king of Italy\\") was hidden from the Austrian enemy by its acronym Viva VERDI!, that passed for a praise of the music of Giuseppe Verdi. In Italian graffiti, viva is often abbreviated as W, a letter otherwise foreign to Italian. The opposite concept abbasso (\\"Down with\\") is abbreviated with an inverted W. In the Philippines, (a former Spanish colony), the usage of ¬°Viva! has declined in the 20th century, having been replaced by the Filipino term Mabuhay and its cognates in various Philippine languages. Today, the expression is largely found in religious contexts (specifically, Filipino Catholicism), where it is said in fiestas to honour a manifestation of God or a patron saint (e.g. \\"¬°Viva, Se√±or Santo Ni√±o!\\", \\"¬°Viva la Virgen de Pe√±afrancia!\\"). Other and similar uses The use of these terms has increased in non-Latin nations recently; for example, a common greeting regarding the Anglophone city of Las Vegas is \\"Viva Las Vegas!\\" One reason may be that West Germanic languages do not have a good equivalent of the term; the closest may be Hail (English)/Heil (German), which understandably has Nazi- tainted connotations. Nevertheless, Hail still appears in certain previously frozen expressions and usages, for example the prayer Hail Mary and the song Hail to the Chief. A similar expression is 'Zindabad' used in Hindustani, Bengali and Persian, it means roughly \\"Long live\\" and is used as a patriotic sentiment glorifying leaders and countries e.g. 'Pakistan Zindabad' or 'Bangladesh Zindabad'. On 25 July 2005, upon winning his seventh consecutive Tour de France and subsequently retiring from professional cycling, Lance Armstrong ended his farewell speech with \\"Vive le Tour, forever\\".

He became the next ruler of the Lodi dynasty after the death of his father Bahlul Lodi in July 1489.The second and most successful ruler of the Lodi dynasty of the Delhi sultanate, he was also a poet of the Persian language and prepared a diwan of 9000 verses.Ram Nath Sharma, History Of Education In India, Atlantic (1996), p. 61 Biography The top two storeys of the Qutub Minar were reconstructed in marble by Sikandar Lodi Sikandar was the second son of Sultan Bahlul Lodi, a Pashtun ruler of Lodi Sultanate.Lodƒ´ dynasty - Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Sikandar was a capable ruler who encouraged trade across his territory. He expanded Lodi territory into the regions of Gwalior and Bihar. He made a treaty with Alauddin Hussain Shah and his kingdom of Bengal. In 1503, he commissioned the building of the present-day city of Agra. Agra was founded by him. Sikandar Lodi's tombalt= Conflict with Manasimha Tomar The Man Singh (Manasimha) palace at the Gwalior fort The newly crowned Manasimha was not prepared for an invasion from Delhi, and decided to avoid a war by paying Bahlul Lodi a tribute of 800,000 tankas (coins). In 1489, Sikandar Lodi succeeded Bahlul Lodi as the Sultan of Delhi. In 1500, Manasimha provided asylum to some rebels from Delhi, who had been involved in a plot to overthrow Sikandar Lodi. The Sultan, wanting to punish Manasimha, and to expand his territory, launched a punitive expedition against Gwalior. In 1501, he captured Dholpur, a dependency of Gwalior, whose ruler Vinayaka-deva fled to Gwalior. Sikandar Lodi then marched towards Gwalior, but after crossing the Chambal River, an epidemic outbreak in his camp forced him to halt his march. Manasimha used this opportunity to reconcile with Lodi, and sent his son Vikramaditya to the Lodi camp with gifts for the Sultan. He promised to expel the rebels from Delhi, on the condition that Dholpur be restored to Vinayaka-deva. Sikandar Lodi agreed to these terms, and left. Historian Kishori Saran Lal theorizes that Vinayaka Deva hadn't lost Dholpur at all: this narrative was created by the Delhi chroniclers to flatter the Sultan. In 1504, Sikandar Lodi resumed his war against the Tomaras. First, he captured the Mandrayal fort, located to the east of Gwalior. He ransacked the area around Mandrayal, but many of his soldiers lost their lives in a subsequent epidemic outbreak, forcing him to return to Delhi. Sometime later, Lodi moved his base to the newly established city of Agra, which was located closer to Gwalior. He captured Dholpur, and then marched against Gwalior, characterizing the expedition as a jihad. From September 1505 to May 1506, Lodi managed to ransack the rural areas around Gwalior, but was unable to capture the Gwalior fort because of Manasimha's hit-and-run tactics. A scarcity of food resulting from Lodi's destruction of crops forced Lodi to give up the siege. During his return to Agra, Manasimha ambushed his army near Jatwar, inflicting heavy casualties on the invaders. Having failed to capture the Gwalior fort, Lodi decided to capture the smaller forts surrounding Gwalior. Dholpur and Mandrayal were already in his control by this time. In February 1507, he captured the Uditnagar (Utgir or Avantgarh) fort lying on the Narwar-Gwalior route. In September 1507, he marched against Narwar, whose ruler (a member of the Tomara clan) fluctuated his allegiance between the Tomaras of Gwalior and the Malwa Sultanate. He captured the fort after a year-long siege. In December 1508, Lodi placed Narwar in charge of Raj Singh Kachchwaha, and marched to Lahar (Lahayer) located to the south-east of Gwalior. He stayed at Lahar for a few months, during which he cleared its neighbourhood of rebels. Over the next few years, Lodi remained busy in other conflicts. In 1516, he made a plan to capture Gwalior, but an illness prevented him from doing so. Manasimha died in 1516, and Sikandar Lodi's illness also led to his death in November 1517.  Religion  The Lodi Sultans were Muslims, and like their predecessors, acknowledged the authority of the Abbasid Caliphate over the Muslim World. Because Sikandar's mother was a Hindu, he tried to prove his Islamic credentials by resorting to strong Sunni orthodoxy as a political expediency. He destroyed Hindu temples, and under the pressure from the ulama, allowed the execution of a Brahmin who declared Hinduism to be as veracious as Islam. He also banned women from visiting the mazars (mausoleums) of Muslim saints, and banned the annual procession of the spear of the legendary Muslim martyr Salar Masud. Before Sikandar's time, the judicial duties in smaller villages and towns were performed by local administrators, while the Sultan himself consulted the scholars of the Islamic law (sharia). Sikandar established sharia courts in several towns, enabling the qazis to administer the sharia law to a larger population. Although such courts were established in areas with significant Muslim population, they were also open to non-Muslims, including for non- religious matters such as property disputes.

A political party is either organized, and thus officially recognized by the Secretary of State's office, with equal rights and responsibilities therein or it does not have any legal existence. The interest group Friends of Democracy has been lobbying to expand ballot access to the minor political parties, with some success. In 2004, the length of time that a petition to create a new political party could be circulated was expanded, as was the process by which new political parties can remain recognized state parties and independent nominees for president can now include a brief minor party designation in lieu of independent. North Dakota's most historically significant minor parties, the Non-Partisan League and the Independent Voters Association could be considered factions of the Republican party, however this is a gross simplification of the situation, as both groups had structures strongly resembling independent political parties, despite competing on the Republican primary ticket. In 1996, the Reform Party became a recognized political party in the state, with Ross Perot winning five percent or more of the popular vote in that state, and the Natural Law Party became organized that year to nominate a slate of candidates in that year's state constitutional election. However, neither political party remained active and soon lost their recognized status. In 2007, the Libertarian Party and the Constitution Party both received official recognition from the Secretary of State's office as an \\"organized political party.\\" In 2007 the Libertarian Party of North Dakota filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District court arguing that state law requiring a minimum number of votes in a party‚Äôs primary, for that party to nominate candidates in a legislative election, violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments. A similar requirement had been struck down in Minnesota and the party hoped that the court would invalidate this law as well. However, in Libertarian Party of North Dakota v. Jaeger (2011) the Federal Court of Appeals upheld the District court's ruling that the regulation did not impose any unconstitutional burden on the political party. Unorganized political parties In 2009, the democratic socialist Liberty Union Party came into existence, although it has not yet run candidates.

The institution is based in the Coulonh√ªs and adjacent buildings in Leeuwarden. Together with several other institutes it belongs to the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (KNAW). It has about 60 employees. In addition, some 300 scientists, amateurs and professionals, are active in the scientific societies hosted by the Fryske Akademy.  Activities  Although the academy's mission includes a wide scope of Friesland-related topics, a great deal of its work focuses particularly on the West Frisian language. It has also done a great deal to regulate the language. The Fryske Akademy publishes the ' (Dictionary of the (West) Frisian Language), which serves as the language's principal authority. It also does a good deal of research regarding the language, history, and culture of the Frisian people. Since its inception, it has published almost 1,000 scientific books, thousands of articles, and a large number of reports on these subjects. A few larger projects include: * the authoritative dictionary of the West Frisian language, in 25 volumes; * a West Frisian‚ÄìEnglish dictionary; * the Historical Geographical Information System (HISGIS), in which historical registers of real property have been linked to other information like parish registers; * the Mercator European Research Centre on Multilingualism and Language Learning, which has been financed in part by the Council of Europe, the province of Friesland, and the municipality of Leeuwarden.  Function in society/social function  The social purpose of the Fryske Akademy is, as its statutes have it, the maintenance of societies for the study of Friesland, in which professional scientists and amateur scientists participate. The societies are in part responsible for the large number of books which the Fryske Akademy produces. Very active societies include the Genealogical Society, the Archaeological Society, and the Biological Society. Active or passive participation in these societies is open to everyone paying his dues as a donor of the Fryske Akademy. There are about 3000 donors, each paying a minimum of 25 euro a year. In addition, the Fryske Akademy carries out contract research for third parties, such as the provincial authorities for whom the Fryske Akademy investigated the quality of language education at primary level. It also contributed to the development of test for speech therapy for West Frisian, which made it possible to assess children's linguistic progress in West Frisian. Up till then, only a Dutch test had been used, which gave distorted results in the case of bilingual children. The academy is also the home of Fryske Rie foar Heraldyk, a heraldic advisory board for the Frisian region.  History  The Fryske Akademy was founded in 1938 with the support of the provincial authorities at the behest of many pro-Frisian politicians and scientists, notably the historian Geart Aeilco Wumkes and the theologian Titus Brandsma. Before the foundation of the Fryske Akademy, two societies were concerned with Frisian science: * The Frisian society for History, Archaeology, and Linguistics * The society for the Frisian language and book knowledge These 19th-century societies regarded themselves as the intellectual heirs to the University of Franeker, which was abolished by Napoleon and which the government of the new Kingdom of the Netherlands failed to reopen. To some extent, the Fryske Akademy considers itself a successor to the University of Franeker.

It builds upon the earlier DXT5 algorithm and is an open standard. 3Dc is now implemented by both ATI and Nvidia.  Target application  The target application, normal mapping, is an extension of bump mapping that simulates lighting on geometric surfaces by reading surface normals from a rectilinear grid analogous to a texture map - giving simple models the impression of increased complexity. This additional channel however increases the load on the graphics system's memory bandwidth. Pre-existing lossy compression algorithms implemented on consumer 3D hardware lacked the precision necessary for reproducing normal maps without excessive visible artefacts, justifying the development of 3Dc.  Algorithm  Surface normals are three-dimensional vectors of unit length. Because of the length constraint only two elements of any normal need to be stored. The input is therefore an array of two- dimensional values. Compression is performed in 4√ó4 blocks. In each block the two components of each value are compressed separately. For each block, each of the two components have a palette of 8 values to choose from. The palettes are generated from two values representing the start and end of a line and the other six values being generated as linear combinations of the start and end values. Compression is natively achieved by finding the lowest and highest values of the 16 pixels to be compressed and storing each of those as an 8-bit quantity. Individual elements within the 4√ó4 block are then stored with 3-bits each, representing their position on an 8 step linear scale from the lowest value to the highest. Each pixel's 3-bit value (the palette index) would be chosen by choosing the palette entry with the minimum distance from the original values. Total storage is 128 bits per 4x4 block once both source components are factored in. In an uncompressed scheme with similar 8-bit precision, the source data is 32 8-bit values for the same area, occupying 256 bits. The algorithm therefore produces a 2:1 compression ratio. The compression ratio is sometimes stated as being \\"up to 4:1\\" as it is common to use 16-bit precision for input data rather than 8-bit. This produces compressed output that is literally 1/4 the size of the input but it is not of comparable precision.  3Dc+  3Dc+ (FourCC: ATI1) (also known as BC4 or Block Compression 4) can compress textures, i.e. light maps, shadow maps, HDR textures and material properties. 3Dc+ provides 2:1 compression ratio with single component (DXT5 alpha) 8-bit integer textures and 4:1 compression ratio with normal maps and textures consisting of two 8-bit integer components  References  * Microsoft Developer Network article on Block Compression in Direct3D 10 * What is a Normal Map? * CREATING AND USING NORMAL MAPS * Creating Normal Maps * 3Dc - higher quality textures with better compression Category:Texture compression Category:Open formats Category:Lossy compression algorithms Category:3D graphics software ","title":"3Dc"},{"id":"1495343","text":"Isaac Ridgeway Trimble (May 15, 1802 ‚Äì January 2, 1888) was a United States Army officer, a civil engineer, a prominent railroad construction superintendent and executive, and a Confederate general in the American Civil War. He was born in Virginia, lived in Maryland for much of his adult life, and returned to Virginia in 1861 after Maryland did not secede. Trimble is most famous for his role as a division commander in the assault known as Pickett's Charge at the Battle of Gettysburg. He was wounded severely in the leg during that battle, and was left on the field. He spent most of the remainder of the war as a prisoner, and was finally paroled on April 16, 1865, one week after Robert E. Lee surrendered the Army of Northern Virginia following the Battle of Appomattox Court House. Youth, education, building railroads Trimble was born in Frederick County, Virginia, to John and Rachel Ridgeway Trimble, and his family moved to Culpeper County, Virginia shortly thereafter. As a young boy, Trimble's mother and father both died of fever within a short period of time, and he was sent to live with his half-brother in Kentucky. He was nominated by U.S. Representative Henry Clay to attend the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, from which he graduated in 1822, 17th in a class of 42. Although he excelled academically in engineering, he was commissioned as a brevet second lieutenant of artillery. He served for ten years as a lieutenant in the 3rd and 1st U.S. Artillery regiments, and left the U.S. Army in May 1832, along with five of his West Point classmates, to pursue the emerging business of railroad construction.The Pennocks of Primitive Hall website; Fiebeger, Dictionary of American Biography; Eicher, p. 536; Krick, p. 60. Krick states that there were 42 cadets graduating in 1822, Eicher states 40. Trimble was married twice: first, in 1831 to Maria Cattell Presstman of Charleston, South Carolina, who died in 1855; second, to her sister, Ann Ferguson Presstman. By his first marriage he had two sons, David Churchill Trimble and William Presstman Trimble, who survived him. Soon after leaving the Army, Trimble moved to Maryland at the urging of his wife, and he subsequently considered it his home state. He helped survey the route of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. He was a construction engineer for the Boston and Providence Railroad. He was chief engineer for Pennsylvania Railroad predecessors Baltimore and Susquehanna Railroad; Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad (serving under famous American Civil War era President Samuel Morse Felton Sr. (1809-1889), where he was responsible for constructing the President Street Station, the line's southern terminal in east downtown waterfront Baltimore in 1849-1850, now the oldest big city train depot left in America. Later then Trimble went to the Philadelphia and Baltimore Central Railroad. From 1859-61, he was superintendent of the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad. Following the firing on the Federal installation of Fort Sumter in Charleston harbor in South Carolina in early April 1861, he led a contingent of Maryland state militia to burn the railroad bridges around Baltimore to prevent the entry of any more Federal regular army or Northern state militia from passing through the divided riotous city following the bloodshed conflict of the Pratt Street Riots on April 19th, 1861, on the orders of the Mayor of Baltimore George William Brown and Governor of Maryland Hicks.Fiebeger, Dictionary of American Biography; The Pennocks of Primitive Hall website; Eicher, p. 536; Krick, p. 60; Tagg, p. 328. Civil War At the start of the Civil War, Trimble participated in efforts to restrict the movement of Union troops to Washington, D.C., by burning bridges north of Baltimore. When he realized that Maryland would not secede from the Union, he returned to Virginia and joined the Provisional Army of the state of Virginia as a colonel of engineers in May 1861. He was appointed a brigadier general in the Confederate States Army on August 9, 1861, and was assigned to construct artillery batteries along the Potomac River and later the defenses of Norfolk, Virginia. He was given command in the Army of the Potomac (the predecessor of the Army of Northern Virginia), of a brigade that consisted of regiments from four different states, effectively merging them into a single fighting unit.Eicher, p. 536; Krick, p. 60; Tagg, p. 328. Trimble first saw combat as part of Thomas J. \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson's spring 1862 campaign in the Shenandoah Valley. He distinguished himself in the Battle of Cross Keys by fighting off an attack from Union troops under Maj. Gen. John C. Fr√©mont, and then seizing the initiative to counterattack and rout them. During the Seven Days Battles under Jackson outside of Richmond, Virginia, his brigade had few engagements, but they fought hard at Gaines' Mill and he sought to follow up the unsuccessful Confederate assault on Malvern Hill by making a night attack, but his request was refused.Krick, pp. 60‚Äì61; Tagg, pp. 328‚Äì29. In the Northern Virginia Campaign, Trimble's brigade performed well at the Battle of Cedar Mountain and defeated a Union brigade at Freeman's Ford in mid-August. The brigade marched with Jackson around Maj. Gen. John Pope's main force and Trimble played a major role in the Battle of Manassas Station Operations, seizing a critical supply depot in Pope's rear. Trimble's forced march and action at Manassas Station received praise from Jackson, who said it was \\"the most brilliant that has come under my observation during the present war.\\" Pope was forced by this maneuver into attacking Jackson's strong defensive positions and suffered a severe defeat in the Second Battle of Bull Run. Trimble was wounded in the leg during the battle on August 29, resulting in an injury so severe that there was speculation that he was hit with an explosive bullet.Krick, p. 61; Tagg, p. 329; Freeman, vol. II, p. 118, states that it was a \\"Belgian explosive bullet\\". Although Krick implies that Trimble resisted having his leg amputated, Long reports that the general insisted on it, but the doctor resisted. Although Trimble avoided the amputation of his wounded leg, his rehabilitation proceeded slowly. For months after, doctors periodically found bone fragments that had to be extracted. By November, he developed camp erysipelas and a probable case of osteomyelitis, and his ambitions for elevation to division command were on hold until he was well enough to return to active duty. He made his desire for promotion abundantly clear to his colleagues, and in one instance before the army moved north to Manassas, he was quoted as saying (probably humorously), \\"General Jackson, before this war is over, I intend to be a Major General or a corpse!\\"Freeman, vol. II, pp. 273‚Äì74, 256‚Äì57; Long, p. 125. Jackson wrote a strong letter of recommendation, although he tempered it by including the sentence \\"I do not regard him as a good disciplinarian.\\" Trimble engaged in a letterwriting campaign from his sick bed to obtain his promotion and to challenge Jackson's claim. He wrote to Adjutant General Samuel Cooper, \\"If I am to have promotion I want it at once and I particularly request, that my date may be from 26 August, the date of the capture of Manassas.\\" (During this period Trimble also feuded with Maj. Gen. J.E.B. Stuart about their conflicting reports of the battle and who bore primary responsibility for the seizure of the Union supply depot.)Freeman, vol. II, p. 416, 502‚Äì03. Trimble was eventually promoted to major general on January 17, 1863, and assigned to the command of Jackson's old division, but he continued to be unable to command in the field due to his health. At the Battle of Chancellorsville Brig. Gen. Raleigh E. Colston, as the senior brigadier general, commanded Trimble's division. A recurrence of illness forced him to turn over his division command in the Second Corps to Maj. Gen. Edward \\"Allegheny\\" Johnson and he was assigned to light duty as commander of the Valley District in the Shenandoah Valley on May 28, 1863.Krick, p. 61; Eicher, 536; Tagg, p. 329; Freeman, vol. II, pp. 416, 701; Long, p. 125. Eicher and Krick list his promotion date as January 17, Freeman and Tagg as January 19. By June 1863, Gen. Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia had crossed the Potomac River in the Gettysburg Campaign. Trimble was desperate to get back into action, particularly because he was familiar with the area from his railroad days. He joined Lee's headquarters unsolicited, and wore out his welcome hanging around without formal assignment. Riding north, he caught up with Lt. Gen. Richard S. Ewell on the way to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and joined his staff as a supernumerary, or senior officer without a command. He and Ewell quarreled frequently due to this clumsy arrangement and Trimble's lack of tact.Tagg, p. 329. At the Battle of Gettysburg, Ewell's Second Corps reached the battlefield in the early afternoon of the first day, July 1, 1863, smashing into the Union XI Corps and driving it south through the town to Cemetery Hill. Trimble wrote the following about his encounter with Ewell: Observers have reported that the \\"impatient reply\\" was, \\"When I need advice from a junior officer I generally ask for it.\\" They also stated that Trimble threw down his sword in disgust and stormed off. A more colorful version of this account has been immortalized in Michael Shaara's novel, The Killer Angels.Tagg, p. 329. Freeman, vol. 3, p. 95, gives a detailed account of what was probably said, and not said, in the unrecorded confrontation between Trimble and Ewell. On July 3, 1863, Trimble was one of the three division commanders in Pickett's Charge. He stepped in to replace Maj. Gen. W. Dorsey Pender, of Lt. Gen. A.P. Hill's corps, who had been mortally wounded the previous day. Trimble was at a great disadvantage because he had never worked with these troops before. His division participated in the left section of the assault, advancing just behind the division led by Brig. Gen. J. Johnston Pettigrew (formerly by Maj. Gen. Henry Heth). Trimble rode his horse, Jinny, and was wounded in the left leg, the same leg hit at Second Bull Run. Despite feeling faint, the 61-year-old general was able to walk back to the Confederate line on Seminary ridge. His leg was amputated by Dr. Hunter McGuire, and Trimble could not be taken along with the retreating Confederates, because of fear of infection that would result from a long ambulance ride back to Virginia, so he was left under the care of a family in Gettysburg on July 6 as the army withdrew. Trimble complained bitterly that if his leg had been amputated at Second Bull Run, the bullet would have missed him on this occasion. He was treated in the Seminary Hospital at Gettysburg until August. Of the charge on the third day of Gettysburg, Trimble said: \\"If the men I had the honor to command that day could not take that position, all hell couldn't take it.\\"Long, p. 125; Krick, p. 61; Tagg, pp. 329‚Äì30; Gottfried, p. 650. Gettysburg marked the end of Trimble's active military career. He spent the next year and a half in Federal hands at Johnson's Island and Fort Warren. He was recommended for parole soon after capture, but former U.S. Secretary of War Simon Cameron recommended against it, citing Trimble's expert knowledge of northern railroads. In March 1865, Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant ordered Trimble to be sent to City Point, Virginia, for exchange, but by the time he reached there, Robert E. Lee's army was already retreating in the Appomattox Campaign. Trimble was finally paroled in Lynchburg, Virginia, on April 16, 1865, just after Lee's surrender.Long, pp. 126‚Äì28; Eicher, p. 536; Krick, p. 61; Tagg, p. 330. Postbellum life and heritage After the war, Trimble, equipped with an artificial leg, returned to Baltimore, Maryland, to resume his engineering work. He died in Baltimore and is buried there in Green Mount Cemetery, arguably the most famous Maryland resident who fought for the Confederacy. In 1849, Trimble built Baltimore's historic 1849 President Street Station. The oldest big city train station in America, it was restored in 1997 to serve as the Baltimore Civil War Museum. In popular media Isaac Trimble was played by actor W. Morgan Sheppard in the movies Gettysburg and Gods and Generals.

He continues to curate, organise and exhibit around the world: in Seoul, LA and Cyprus, the Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris and Design Museum, London as well as in castles, sheds and garages. He is a Senior Fellow of the Royal College of Art, London. Cook's professorships include those of the Royal Academy, University College, London and the Hochschule fur Bildende Kunste (St√§delschule) in Frankfurt-Main, Germany. Construction of his arts building, the Kunsthaus Graz (aka 'The Friendly Alien') in Graz, Austria (with Colin Fournier) brought his work to a wider public. In 2013 he (along with his studio CRAB) completed the Vienna Business and Economics University's new law faculty and Australia's newest school of architecture, the Abedian School of Architecture at Bond University on the Gold Coast. Cook has also built in Osaka, Nagoya, Berlin and Madrid. He practices with Gavin Robotham as CRAB studio (Cook Robotham Architectural Bureau), and is married to the Israeli architect, Yael Reisner. Cook was awarded a knighthood in the Queen's 2007 Birthday Honours List, for services to architecture. Awards and honours *1960 ‚Äì Henry Florence Student A.A.

It is the 22nd Disney animated feature film and was first released on a double bill with The Littlest Horse Thieves on March 11, 1977. Its characters have spawned a franchise of various sequels and television programs, clothing, books, toys, and an attraction of the same name at Disneyland, Walt Disney World, and Hong Kong Disneyland in addition to Pooh's Hunny Hunt in Tokyo Disneyland. Plot The film's content is derived from three previously released animated featurettes Disney produced based upon the Winnie-the-Pooh books by A. A. Milne: Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree (1966), Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day (1968), and Winnie the Pooh and Tigger Too (1974). Extra material was used to link the three featurettes together to allow the stories to merge into each other. A fourth, shorter scene was added to bring the film to a close, originally made during production of Blustery Day (based on the presence of Jon Walmsley as Christopher Robin). The sequence was based on the final chapter of The House at Pooh Corner, where Christopher Robin must leave the Hundred Acre Wood behind as he is starting school. In it, Christopher Robin and Pooh discuss what they liked doing together and the boy asks his bear to promise to remember him and to keep some of the memories of their time together alive. Pooh agrees to do so, and the film closes with The Narrator saying that wherever Christopher Robin goes, Pooh will always be waiting for him whenever he returns. Later featurette Six years after the release of The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh, Disney commissioned a fourth featurette based on the stories. Winnie the Pooh and a Day for Eeyore premiered in theaters on March 11, 1983, but was not originally connected to the preceding films in any manner. It has since been added to home video releases of The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh. Voice cast * Winnie the Pooh, voiced by Sterling Holloway * Christopher Robin, voiced by Bruce Reitherman, Jon Walmsley and Timothy Turner * Piglet, voiced by John Fiedler * Eeyore, voiced by Ralph Wright * Roo, voiced by Clint Howard and Dori Whitaker * Kanga, voiced by Barbara Luddy * Tigger, voiced by Paul Winchell * Rabbit, voiced by Junius Matthews * Owl, voiced by Hal Smith * Gopher, voiced by Howard Morris * Narrated by Sebastian Cabot Production The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh was the last film in the Disney canon in which Walt Disney had personal involvement, since one of the shorts (Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree) was released during his lifetime and he was involved in the production of Blustery Day. It was always Walt Disney's intention to create a feature film, but he decided to make shorts instead ‚Äî after production had begun ‚Äî to familiarize U.S. audiences with the characters. All three shorts, as well as future feature films, boast classic songs by the Sherman Brothers including \\"Winnie the Pooh\\" and \\"The Wonderful Thing About Tiggers\\". For the character Piglet, hand gestures and other movements were used by the animators to create expressiveness, since he (and Pooh) had the appearance of dolls or stuffed animals with relatively simple button eyes. The scene where Rabbit deals with Pooh's rump being part of the \\"decor of his home\\" was not in the original book, but was reportedly contemplated by Disney when he first read the book. Release=Reception The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh holds a unanimous critic approval rating of 100% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 13 reviews, with a weighted average of 8.4/10. The website's critical consensus reads \\"Perhaps the most faithful of Disney's literary adaptations, this cute, charming collection of episodes captures the spirit of A.A. Milne's classic stories.\\" Film critic Leonard Maltin called the original Pooh featurettes \\"gems\\"; he also noted that the artwork resembles the book illustrations, and that the particular length of these featurettes meant that the filmmakers didn't have to \\"compress or protract their script.\\" Ruth Hill Viguers, however, when writing in A Critical History of Children‚Äôs Literature during the 1960s, mentioned Disney's Winnie the Pooh along with several other Disney adaptations as having \\"destroyed the integrity of the original books\\". The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists: * 2008: AFI's 10 Top 10: ** Nominated Animation Film Home media The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh was first released on VHS, Betamax, CED videorecord, and laserdisc in the early 1980s. In 1996, it was re-released on VHS as part of the Masterpiece Collection and included video footage of the making which was shown before the movie starts (as did the first UK VHS release in 1997). It was released on DVD for the first time in 2002 as a 25th Anniversary Edition, with digitally restored picture and sound. The individual shorts had also been released on their own on VHS in the 1990s. The 25th anniversary edition DVD includes, among other bonus features, \\"The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh: The Story Behind the Masterpiece\\", which documents the history of the books and their initial film adaptations. It also features interviews with animators Ollie Johnston, Frank Thomas, and Burny Mattinson, as well as the Sherman Brothers, Paul Winchell, and others. Digital Media FX reviewer Shannon Muir stated that the audio and video quality of the film on this DVD was very high. The \\"Friendship Edition\\" DVD was re-released on June 19, 2007. All of the special features from the previous \\"25th Anniversary Edition\\" DVD were recycled; the only new addition being an episode of Playhouse Disney's computer-animated series My Friends Tigger & Pooh. The DVD re-release coincides with the 30th anniversary of the release of the film. The Blu-ray version was released for the first time along with the third DVD release on August 27, 2013. The bonus features included a Mini Adventures of Winnie the Pooh segment, \\"Geniuses\\" and the only bonus feature that was kept from the previous DVD releases was the \\"Winnie the Pooh\\" theme song music video performed by Carly Simon.

He ruled Egypt from approximately 872 BC to 837 BC from Tanis, the capital of that dynasty. After succeeding his father, Osorkon II was faced with the competing rule of his cousin, King Harsiese A, who controlled both Thebes and the Western Oasis of Egypt. Potentially, Harsiese's kingship could have posed a serious challenge to the authority of Osorkon, however, when Harsiese died in 860 BC, Osorkon II acted to ensure that no king would replace Harsiese. He appointed his son, Nimlot C, as the high priest of Amun at Thebes, which would have been the source for a successor to Harsiese. This consolidated the king's authority over Upper Egypt and thereafter, Osorkon II ruled over a united Egypt. Osorkon II's reign was a time of prosperity for Egypt and large-scale monumental building ensued. Foreign policy and monumental program Entrance to the Tomb of Osorkon II Despite his astuteness in dealings with matters at home, Osorkon II was forced to be aggressive on the international scene. The growing power of Assyria was accompanied with increased meddling in the affairs of Israel and Syria - territories well within Egypt's sphere of influence. Osorkon II devoted considerable resources into his building projects by adding to the temple of Bastet at Bubastis,Mohamed I. Bakr and Helmut Brandl, \\"Bubastis and the Temple of Bastet\\", in: M.I. Bakr, H. Brandl, and F. Kalloniatis (eds.), Egyptian Antiquities from Kufur Nigm and Bubastis. M.i.N. (Museums in the Nile Delta) 1, Cairo/Berlin 2010, pp. 27-36 which featured a substantial new hall decorated with scenes depicting his Sed festival and images of his queen, Karomama. Monumental construction during his reign also was performed at Thebes, Memphis, Tanis, and Leontopolis. Osorkon II also built Temple J at Karnak during the final years of his reign and it was decorated by his high priest, Takelot F (the future king, Takelot II). Takelot F was the son of the deceased high priest Nimlot C and, thus, Osorkon II's grandson. Now, all of Osorkon II's sizeable stone statues are known to be re- used works of earlier periods that merely were re-inscribed for Osorkon II, including the famous \\"Cairo-Philadelphia statue of Osorkon II\\".H.

(https://www.academia.edu/8241577/Bemerkungen_zur_Datierung_von_libyerzeitlichen_Statuen_aufgrund_stilistischer_Kriterien Osorkon II was the last great Twenty-second Dynasty king of Tanis, ruling Egypt from the Delta to Upper Egypt. His successor, Shoshenq III, lost the effective control of Middle and Upper Egypt that Osorkon II had assembled into a united Egypt. Many officials may be dated to the reign of Osorkon II. Ankhkherednefer was inspector of the palace, Paanmeny probably was his chief physician, Djeddjehutyiuefankh was the fourth prophet of Amun,Statue, Cairo CG 42206, 42207 and Bakenkhons was another prophet of Amun during his reign.Cairo CG 42213 Reign length Statue of Osorkon II from the Temple of Baalat Gebal in Byblos, displayed in the National Museum of Beirut. Approximately 837 BC, Osorkon II died and he was buried in Tomb NRT I at Tanis. Currently, he is believed to have reigned for more than 30 years, rather than just 25 years as had been interpreted earlier. The celebration of his first Sed Jubilee previously was thought to have occurred in his Year 22, but the Heb Sed date in his Great Temple of Bubastis is damaged and also may be read as Year 30, as Edward Wente notes.Edward Wente, Review of Kenneth Kitchen's The Third Intermediate Period in Egypt c.1100-650 BC, JNES 35(1976), pp.275-278 The fact that this king's own grandson, Takelot F, served him as High Priest of Amun at Thebes-as the inscribed walls of Temple J prove - supports the hypothesis of a longer reign for Osorkon II. Recently, it has been demonstrated that Nile Level Text 14 (dated to Year 29 of an Usimare Setepenamun) belongs to Osorkon II on palaeographical grounds.Gerard Broekman, \\"The Nile Level Records of the Twenty-Second and Twenty-Third Dynasties in Karnak,\\" JEA 88(2002), pp.174-178 This finding suggests that Osorkon II likely did celebrate his first Heb Sed in his Year 30 as was traditionally the case with other Libyan era kings, such as Shoshenq III and Shoshenq V. In addition, a Year 22 Stela from his reign preserves no mention of any Heb Sed celebrations in that year, as would be expected (see Von Beckerath, 'infra'). While Osorkon II's precise reign length is unknown, some Egyptologists, such as J√ºrgen von Beckerath - in his 1997 book Chronology of the Egyptian PharaohsJ√ºrgen von Beckerath, Chronologie des Pharaonischen √Ñgypten, MAS:Philipp von Zabern, (1997), p.98 & p.191 - and Aidan Dodson have suggested a range of between 38 and 39 years.Aidan Dodson, A new King Shoshenq confirmed?, GM 137(1993), p.58 However, these much higher figures are not verified by the current monumental evidence. Gerard Broekman gives Osorkon II a slightly shorter reign of 34 years.Gerard Broekman, 'The Reign of Takeloth II, a Controversial Matter,' GM 205(2005), pp.31 & 33 English Egyptologist Kenneth Kitchen, in a 2006 \\"Agypten und Levante\\" article, now accepts that if Nile Level Text 14 is correctly attributed to Year 29 of Osorkon II, then the reference to Osorkon's Sed Festival jubilee should be amended from Year 22 to Year 30.Kenneth Kitchen, Agypten und Levante 16 (2006), p.299 point No.7 Kitchen suggests that Osorkon II would have died shortly afterward, in his Year 31.Kitchen, Agypten und Levante 16 (2006), p.301 section 16 Reliefs from the Tomb of Osorkon II Marriages and children Osorkon II is known to have had at least four wives: * Queen Karomama is the best known of Osorkon's wives. Karomama was the mother of at least two sons and three daughters:Kitchen, The Third Intermediate Period in Egypt (1100‚Äì650 BC). 3rd ed. Warminster: Aris & Phillips Limited. 1996 * Isetemkheb is known to be the mother of a daughter named, Tjesbastperu, who was married to the High Priest of Ptah Takelot B.Aidan Dodson & Dyan Hilton: The Complete Royal Families of Ancient Egypt. Thames & Hudson, 2004, * Djedmutesakh IV was the mother of the High Priest of Amun Nimlot C. Nimlot C was a son of Osorkon II and the father of Takelot F, who would become Takelot II. * Mutemhat was another of his wives. Other children of record included: * Prince Shoshenq D was High Priest of Ptah * Prince Hornakht was the High Priest of Amun in Tanis.Nos anc√™tres de l'Antiquit√©, 1991. Christian Settipani, p.153 and 166 Osorkon II appointed Hornakht as the chief priest of Amun at Tanis to strengthen his authority in Lower Egypt; however, this was clearly a political move since Hornakht died prematurely before the age of ten.Nicolas Grimal, A History of Ancient Egypt, Blackwell Books, 1992. p.325 * Princess Tashakheper may have served as God's Wife of Amun during the reign of Takelot III * Princess Karomama C, who may be identical to Karomama Meritmut, a God's Wife of Amun * Princess Taiirmer Other possible children attributed to Osorkon II include his successor Shoshenq III and the King's Daughter Tentsepeh (D), the wife of General Ptahudjankhef, who was a son of Nimlot C and hence, a grandson of Osorkon II. Tomb Interior photograph of the tomb of Osorkon II The French excavator Pierre Montet discovered Osorkon II's plundered royal tomb at Tanis on February 27, 1939. It revealed that Osorkon II was buried in a massive granite sarcophagus with a lid carved from a Ramesside-era statue. Only some fragments of a hawk-headed coffin and canopic jars remained in the robbed tomb to identify him. While the tomb had been looted in antiquity, what jewellery that remained \\"was of such high quality that existing conceptions of the wealth of the northern Twenty-first and Twenty-second dynasties had to be revised.\\"Bob Brier, Egyptian Mummies: Unravelling the Secrets of an Ancient Art, William Morrow & Company Inc., New York, 1994. p.144 Successor David Aston has argued in a JEA 75 (1989) paper that Osorkon II was succeeded by Shoshenq III at Tanis rather than Takelot II Si-Ese as Kitchen presumed because none of Takelot II's monuments have been found in Lower Egypt where other genuine Tanite kings, such as Osorkon II, Shoshenq III, and even the short-lived Pami (at 6-7 years) are attested on donation stelas, temple walls, and annal documents.Aston, pp.139-153 Other Egyptologists, such as Gerard Broekman, Karl Jansen-Winkeln, Aidan Dodson, and J√ºrgen von Beckerath have endorsed this position as well. Von Beckerath also identifies Shoshenq III as the immediate successor of Osorkon II and places Takelot II as a separate king in Upper Egypt.J√ºrgen von Beckerath, \\"Chronologie des Pharaonischen √Ñgypten,\\" M√ÑS 46 (Philipp von Zabern), Mainz: 1997. p.94 Gerard Broekman writes in a recent 2005 GM article that, \\"in light of the monumental and genealogical evidence\\", Aston's chronology for the position of the twenty-second dynasty kings \\"is highly preferable\\" to Kitchen's chronology.Gerard Broekman, 'The Reign of Takeloth II, a Controversial Matter,' GM 205(2005), pp.31 The only documents that mention a king Takelot in Lower Egypt, such as a royal tomb at Tanis, a Year 9 donation stela from Bubastis, and a heart scarab featuring the nomen 'Takelot Meryamun' -- now have been attributed exclusively to king Takelot I by Egyptologists today, including Kitchen.K.A. Kitchen, in the introduction to his 3rd 1996 edition of \\"The Third Intermediate Period in Egypt (c.1100-650 BC),\\" Aris & Phillips Ltd. pp.xxxii-xxxiii The English Egyptologist Aidan Dodson, in his book The Canopic Equipment of the Kings of Egypt, observes that Shoshenq III built \\"a dividing wall, with a double scene showing Osorkon II\\" and him \\"each adoring an unnamed deity\\" in the antechamber of Osorkon II's tomb.Aidan Dodson, \\"The Canopic Equipment of the Kings of Egypt,\\" (Kegan Paul Intl: 1994), p.95 Dodson concludes that while one may argue Shoshenq III erected the wall to hide Osorkon II's sarcophagus, it made no sense for Shoshenq to create such an elaborate relief if Takelot II really had intervened between him and Osorkon II at Tanis for 25 years, unless Shoshenq III was Osorkon II's immediate successor. Shoshenq III must, hence, have wished to associate himself with his predecessor - Osorkon II.Dodson, The Canopic Equipment of the Kings of Egypt, p.95 Consequently, the case for establishing Takelot II as a Twenty-second Dynasty king and successor to Osorkon II disappears, as Dodson writes. Takelot II instead founded the twenty-third dynasty of Egypt and ruled a divided Egypt by administering Middle and Upper Egypt. ReferencesFurther reading * Bernard V.

Overview  Before the adoption of pixel shader-enhanced bump mapping methods such as normal and parallax mapping that simulate higher mesh detail, curved 3D shapes in games were created with large numbers of triangles. The more triangles are used, the more detailed and thus less polygonal the surface appears. TruForm creates a curved surface using the existing triangles, and tessellates this surface to make a new, more detailed polygonal model. It is designed to increase visual quality, without significantly impacting frame rates, by utilizing hardware processing of geometry. TruForm was not significantly accepted by game developers because it ideally required the models to be designed with TruForm in mind. To enable the feature without causing visual problems, such as ballooned-up weapons, the models had to have flags identifying which areas were to be tessellated. The lack of industry- wide support of the technique from the competition caused developers to ignore the technology. In later version of Catalyst drivers, the TruForm feature is removed. Beginning with Radeon X1000 series, TruForm was no longer advertised as a hardware feature. However, Radeon 9500 and higher (as well as hardware supporting Shader Model 3.0) include Render to Vertex Buffer feature, which can be used for tessellation applications. In the case of Radeon X1000 series, it supports binding up to 5 R2VB buffers simultaneously. Tessellation as dedicated hardware has returned in Xenos and Radeon R600 GPUs.

There are two main types: a boiled then chilled dessert, texturally a custard set with starch, commonly eaten in the U.S., Canada, Germany, Sweden, Poland, and East and South East Asia; and a steamed/baked version, texturally similar to cake, popular in the UK, Ireland, Australia, Germany and New Zealand. British Isles and Australian version In Britain, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand, chocolate pudding is similar in preparation to the Daily Do versions in early 20th century United States. It is a steamed dessert which consists of flour, baking powder, sugar, whole eggs, vanilla aroma, and cocoa powder or chocolate mixed together to make a batter and steamed or baked similar to Christmas pudding. Texturally it is similar to chocolate cake, but denser courtesy of being steamed or baked with boiling water poured over the pudding batter. North American and Asian version The U.S./Canada and Asian version is one of the most common varieties of sweet or dessert pudding served in these countries. It is usually eaten as a snack or dessert. It is also used as a filling for chocolate pie or black bottom pie. Historically, it is a variation on chocolate custard, with starch used as thickener rather than eggs. Early versions of the dish using both egg and flour can be found in the 1918 edition of Fannie Farmer's Boston Cooking School Cook Book and in the 1903 edition of Mary Harris Frazer's Kentucky Receipt Book. In the late 19th and early 20th century, chocolate pudding was thought of as an appropriate food for invalids or children as well as a dessert. It was not considered a health food in the modern sense of the term, but as a wholesome, high-calorie food for those with poor appetites. General Foods (Jell-O) introduced chocolate pudding mix in 1934 as \\"Walter Baker's Dessert\\". It was renamed \\"Pickle's Pudding\\" in 1936. Modern chocolate puddings are usually made with milk and sugar, flavored with chocolate and vanilla and thickened with a starch such as flour or cornstarch. Occasionally, eggs are still used when making chocolate pudding. Usually it is cooked together on the stovetop, but other methods exist including microwaving, steaming, baking (sometimes in a bain-marie) or freezing (using gelatin as a thickener). Sometimes white chocolate pudding is made. Chocolate pudding is commonly purchased ready-made in stores, popular brands include Jell-O Pudding by the Kraft Foods Corporation and Snack Pack by Hunt's. Many people make their own chocolate puddings at home, but commercially produced tinned or refrigerated versions are commonly available in supermarkets.

They are bit sequences generated using maximal linear feedback shift registers and are so called because they are periodic and reproduce every binary sequence (except the zero vector) that can be represented by the shift registers (i.e., for length-m registers they produce a sequence of length 2m ‚àí 1). An MLS is also sometimes called an n-sequence or an m-sequence. MLSs are spectrally flat, with the exception of a near-zero DC term. These sequences may be represented as coefficients of irreducible polynomials in a polynomial ring over Z/2Z. Practical applications for MLS include measuring impulse responses (e.g., of room reverberation). They are also used as a basis for deriving pseudo-random sequences in digital communication systems that employ direct-sequence spread spectrum and frequency-hopping spread spectrum transmission systems, optical dielectric multilayer reflector design, and in the efficient design of some fMRI experiments. Generation Figure 1: The next value of register a3 in a feedback shift register of length 4 is determined by the modulo-2 sum of a0 and a1. MLS are generated using maximal linear feedback shift registers. An MLS-generating system with a shift register of length 4 is shown in Fig. 1. It can be expressed using the following recursive relation: :\\\\begin{cases} a_3[n+1] = a_0[n] + a_1[n]\\\\ a_2[n+1] = a_3[n] \\\\ a_1[n+1] = a_2[n] \\\\ a_0[n+1] = a_1[n] \\\\ \\\\end{cases} where n is the time index and + represents modulo-2 addition. For bit values 0 = FALSE or 1 = TRUE, this is equivalent to the XOR operation. As MLS are periodic and shift registers cycle through every possible binary value (with the exception of the zero vector), registers can be initialized to any state, with the exception of the zero vector. Polynomial interpretation A polynomial over GF(2) can be associated with the linear feedback shift register. It has degree of the length of the shift register, and has coefficients that are either 0 or 1, corresponding to the taps of the register that feed the xor gate. For example, the polynomial corresponding to Figure 1 is x4 + x1 + 1\\\\. A necessary and sufficient condition for the sequence generated by a LFSR to be maximal length is that its corresponding polynomial be primitive.\\"Linear Feedback Shift Registers- Implementation, M-Sequence Properties, Feedback Tables\\", New Wave Instruments (NW), Retrieved 2013.12.03. Implementation MLS are inexpensive to implement in hardware or software, and relatively low-order feedback shift registers can generate long sequences; a sequence generated using a shift register of length 20 is 220 ‚àí 1 samples long (1,048,575 samples). Properties of maximum length sequences MLS have the following properties, as formulated by Solomon Golomb. Balance property The occurrence of 0 and 1 in the sequence should be approximately the same. More precisely, in a maximum length sequence of length 2^n-1 there are 2^{n-1} ones and 2^{n-1}-1 zeros. The number of ones equals the number of zeros plus one, since the state containing only zeros cannot occur. Run property A \\"run\\" is a sub-sequence of consecutive \\"1\\"s or consecutive \\"0\\"s within the MLS concerned. The number of runs is the number of such sub- sequences. Of all the \\"runs\\" (consisting of \\"1\\"s or \\"0\\"s) in the sequence : * One half of the runs are of length 1. * One quarter of the runs are of length 2. * One eighth of the runs are of length 3. * ... etc. ... Correlation property The circular autocorrelation of an MLS is a Kronecker delta function (with DC offset and time delay, depending on implementation). For the ¬±1 convention, i.e., bit value 1 is assigned s = +1 and bit value 0 s = -1, mapping XOR to the negative of the product: R(n)=\\\\frac 1 N \\\\sum_{m=1}^N s[m]\\\\, s^*[m+n]_N = \\\\begin{cases} 1 &\\\\text{if } n = 0, \\\\ -\\\\frac 1 N &\\\\text{if } 0 < n < N. \\\\end{cases} where s^* represents the complex conjugate and [m+n]_N represents a circular shift. The linear autocorrelation of an MLS approximates a Kronecker delta. Extraction of impulse responses If a linear time invariant (LTI) system's impulse response is to be measured using a MLS, the response can be extracted from the measured system output y[n] by taking its circular cross-correlation with the MLS. This is because the autocorrelation of a MLS is 1 for zero-lag, and nearly zero (‚àí1/N where N is the sequence length) for all other lags; in other words, the autocorrelation of the MLS can be said to approach unit impulse function as MLS length increases. If the impulse response of a system is h[n] and the MLS is s[n], then :y[n] = (h*s)[n].\\\\, Taking the cross-correlation with respect to s[n] of both sides, :{\\\\phi}_{sy} = h[n]*{\\\\phi}_{ss}\\\\, and assuming that œÜss is an impulse (valid for long sequences) :h[n] = {\\\\phi}_{sy}.\\\\, Any signal with an impulsive autocorrelation can be used for this purpose, but signals with high crest factor, such as the impulse itself, produce impulse responses with poor signal-to-noise ratio. It's commonly assumed that the MLS would then be the ideal signal, as it consists of only full-scale values and its digital crest factor is the minimum, 0 dB. However, after analog reconstruction, the sharp discontinuities in the signal produce strong intersample peaks, degrading the crest factor by 4-8 dB or more, increasing with signal length, making it worse than a sine sweep. Other signals have been designed with minimal crest factor, though it's unknown if it can be improved beyond 3 dB. Relationship to Hadamard transform Cohn and Lempel showed the relationship of the MLS to the Hadamard transform. This relationship allows the correlation of an MLS to be computed in a fast algorithm similar to the FFT.

They were originally commissioned by The Montreal Star newspaper and later collected and published in one volume as Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town. Since then, many attempts have been made to expand the canon, present it in a different form or make reference to it. Although the author publicly denied it, the town is closely modelled on the town of Orillia, Ontario and its inhabitants. He named it after one or more nearby communities, which had borne versions of that name in real life, which have since disincorporated: Mariposa, Ontario, and Mariposa Beach. Leacock was a professor of political economy at McGill University in Montreal, Quebec, but he had a summer home at Old Brewery Bay. The names of the characters in the stories were altered to avoid potential libel lawsuits when the stories were published in book form in 1912. Mariposa has been a subject of academic research in a number of fields, such as small town heritage preservation, and in literary studies of Leacock writings. The remainder of this article will provide information on Mariposa in the form of a regular geographic entry as if it really existed, with references to the facts associated with the non- fictional models. Geography Mariposa, Ontario, nicknamed Hull Town, is situated between Lake Ossawippi and Lake Wissanotti (modelled on Lake Couchiching and Lake Simcoe, although with features that radically depart from both). The Ossawippi River joins these two lakes, and the Lower Ossawippi River feeds into the northern end of Lake Wissanotti. The community is located on the Canadian Shield and hence the soil is rocky and supports mostly slow- growing evergreen trees. Politically, Mariposa is located in Missinaba County (modelled on Simcoe County and possibly taking its name from the Missinaibi River near Chapleau, Ontario) which was surveyed in a grid pattern. The town is the metropolis of surrounding rural Tecumseh Township (modelled on Tecumseth Township in Simcoe County), from which it was created in the 19th century, and serves as the judicial district but not county seat. It is only one hundred miles north of the provincial metropolis (modelled on Toronto). Demographics The official census conducted by the federal government lists a population of about five thousand, not counting outlying districts such as Tecumseh Corners, Nichols Corners, Third Concession and Fourth Concession. Other ordinarily reliable sources, including the local agent for the collection of Ontario's vital statistics and the town's two newspapers, estimate that the population is as high as nearly ten thousand. The ethnic origins of most residents are from the British Isles, the descendants of whom have overwhelmed the indigenous Missinabi population. Major sources of in migration are the Maritime provinces, northern Ontario and Massachusetts. Major destinations of out migration, especially for educational and economic reasons, are the nearby provincial metropolis. Mariposans follow diverse Christian denominations according to their ethnic origins, but the Anglicans are clearly most dominant, followed in no particular order by Presbyterians, Salvationists, Methodists and Roman Catholics. Mallory Thomkins of the Times- Herald newspaper is the only outspoken agnostic or atheist. Economy There are several sectors of the economy, and each will be discussed in turn. Primary industry and agriculture Mariposa was attractive to its first inhabitants as a source of primary industries. Swampy areas near the Ossawippi River and nearby shallow reedy areas on Lake Wissanotti itself provided excellent homes for waterfowl and excellent killing grounds for duck hunters. Both fowl and human feasted on abundant bass, chub and the native maskinonge (piscis mariposis) fish. The townsite was occupied by pine and hemlock woods and its reduced remains still ring the town. Choice hardwoods like elm and maple are south of Mariposa, while north of town are tamarack and willow. Although Mariposa is south of Spanish River lumber country, it still maintains a planing factory or sawmill on the lakeshore near the railway siding and every spring there is a huge influx of rough lumbermen. In the immediate vicinity of Mariposa, there are some fair crop farms, but in the extremities of Tecumseh Township and Missinaba County, forbidding rocks, fetid swamps and dense forests of the north country of the Canadian or Laurentian Shield make the soil large scale cultivation of grains or fruits impractical. Livestock farming is somewhat more successful, and the Mariposa Packing Company is always kept busy. Secondary industry, commerce and finance Excluding the sawmill, there is very little industry in town, notably only the Mariposa Carriage Co. This may be partly explained by the erratic nature of the distribution of hydro-electric power generated by the dam on the Lower Ossiwipi River nineteen miles (30 km) north at the rapids. Only on official occasions is the forty or so foot wide bustling downtown thoroughfare of Mariposa called by its proper name, Missinaba Street (after the county and based on Mississaga Street in Orillia), rather than Main Street. Among the many shops there are Pharmaceutical Hall (Jim Eliot's drug store), Pete Glover and Alf McNichol's co-located hardware and paint stores and Ed Moore's photo shop. Similarly, services downtown include lawyers, doctors, dentists, Jefferson \\"Jeff\\" Thorpe's barbershop and, when it is all over, Golgotha Gingham's funeral home. Mariposa boasts two branches of major banks: the Commercial Bank (modelled on what is now the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce) and the Exchange Bank (modelled on what is now the National Bank of Canada). Robertson's Coal and Wood Office was divided to serve as Mariposa Mining Exchange during the investment boom in junior mining companies. Thorpe earned 5312% profit after investing in Northern Star mine in northern Ontario. Trying to continue his financial success, he invested his profits in the Cuban Land Development Company whose corporate headquarters was a P.O. box in New York City. Unfortunately, police discovered this to be a fraud and Thorpe lost not only his own money but undertook to repay Mariposans whom he had help to invest in the dubious scheme. Tourism In recent years, tourism has become the backbone of the town as city folk take the short train trip north. Town architecture is preserved and enhanced, mainly through the activity of hotelier Josh Smith who not only rebuilt and expanded his own property but also replaced the fa√ßade of the Anglican church. Smith's hotel has long been a fixture of the town, and when he bought it around 1908. The hotel has borne many names both before and after his acquisition of it, in approximate order: the Royal Hotel, the Queen's Hotel, the Alexandria Hotel, Smith's Ladies‚Äô and Gent's (sic) Caf√©, Smith's Summer Pavilion, Smith's Tourists‚Äô Emporium, Smith's Northern Health Resort, Smith's Northern Health Resort and Home of the Wissanotti Angler, and Smith's British Arms. Clearly, Josh Smith dominates the hospitality industry, but visitors may also stay at the Continental Hotel, operated by Pete Robinson, or Mariposa House, containing a billiard room. There are also seven short-stay cottages located along Lake Wissanotti. Communications Although it is a small town located in a rural county, Mariposa maintains close connections with the rest of Ontario, Canada and the world. The downtown post office, with Alf Trelawney as its postmaster, served impartially under Liberal government of Alexander Mackenzie as well as the Conservative government of John A. Macdonald. The town took to advanced technology very early, having a telephone exchange staffed with four women operators in 1912. The telegraph office, operated by Billy Rawson, linked Mariposa by telegraph wires along Main Street to the nearby county seat (modelled on Barrie) and the provincial metropolis. For such a small town, the fourth estate is amply represented by two widely read newspapers (modelled on the Orillia Packet-Times and the Owen Sound Sun-Times). The Mariposa Newspacket supports the Conservative Party and its editor wears his blue temperance ribbon of the Knights of Pythias. The Mariposa Times-Herald supports the Liberal Party and its editor published the famous partisan screed from Patriotus Canadiensis. Transportation Mariposa has good transportation networks. Rail transit is provided by the transcontinental trains which roll through the town, usually at night. Unfortunately, scruffy miners and coiffed millionaires from the city rarely stop to offload or load. For that, one must board the Mariposa Local which links the town to the city one hundred miles to the south. Once commercial travellers from the city arrive from the 6:30 a.m. express train, or before they wish to leave the Main Street hotel strip to catch the 5:30 p.m. train to the city, they take the hotel shuttle into downtown. Otherwise, there is no common carrier public transit in town so even bank employees use their feet or bicycles. Since 1972, the stationary dining cars of the Ossawippi Express have served as a reminder of the area's proud railway history, and given residents and visitors a classy place to eat out. Mariposa Belle was the name of its notoriously unseaworthy steamship which cruised at . Its only scheduled departures from the wharf built by the federal government were for scenic cruises on May 24 and July 1 (that is, Victoria Day and Canada Day). Many locals and visitors took chartered day excursions twenty miles (32 km) north to Indian Island (modelled on Georgina Island Indian reserve on Lake Simcoe and Chiefs Island of the Rama Indian Reserve on Lake Couchiching) on Lake Wissanotti. Locals groups, including Knights of Pythias and Sons of Temperance, also take day trips to local option dry townships in Missinaba County. In 1987, a new paddlewheeled cruise ship also called Mariposa Belle began operating in Toronto. In contrast to its namesake, conspicuous and considerable consumption of food and alcohol is the sole purpose of this ship. Government and services Judicial oversight is provided by Judge Philip Pepperleigh, a staunch Conservative, has sat on the bench of the Mariposa Court House for years since emigrating from the Maritimes. Sometimes, it seems more like judicial oversight when he ignores the arguments of Macartney, the prosecuting (i.e., Crown) attorney. For example, Pepperleigh acquitted his own son for hitting a prominent Liberal and fined publican Josh Smith for not opening his bar after hours to accommodate His Honour. The greatest threat to public safety is fire, so the volunteer fire brigade was organized by townsmen. Its lone fire engine is parked at the Fire Hall at the main intersection, and both are funded by proceeds of the Firemen's Ball held each winter. The only other safety and health organizations in town are the marine life station on Lake Wissanotti and the Mariposa Hospital. The former's 14-man Mackinaw rescue boat was rescued by the Mariposa Belle when both sank. The latter's source of income is almost exclusively public subscription. However, the greatest source of the threat to public safety proved to be Josh Smith, de facto chief of the volunteer fire department. Witnesses told detectives brought up from Toronto that they saw Smith in suspicious circumstances before a fire destroyed the debt-ridden Anglican church and that only later did he return to organize the fire fighting effort. Nonetheless, Judge Pepperleigh acquitted Smith of arson and insurance fraud. Other minor officialdom is stabled at the county seat, where the Licence Commissioners grant or withdraw liquor licences based in part on the adherence to an 11 p.m. last call. Undertaker Golgotha Gingham doubles as the provincially appointed collector of vital statistics. Public education is directed by the School Board which operates several primary schools in the township (e.g., Tecumseh Corners School House and Concession School House) and one high school. Mariposa High School offers a full spectrum of instruction including English literature, drama, music and biology. The Mariposa Mechanics‚Äô Institute, blessed with Gallagher collection donated by one of the town's most learned men, provides adults with opportunities for self-education and continuing education. Politics Municipal politics are normally sedate, with several leading members of the council and community such as businessman Pete Glover taking turns annually as mayor. The only incumbent known outside the town was Harry J. Boyle, concurrently the chairman of the CBC in 1967. The only moderately controversial feature of municipal politics is the local option on Prohibition, which even temperance organizations sometimes find inconvenient. However, normally staid federal politics become very important and divisive at election time. Religious solidarity is torn apart. The Rev. Mr. Rupert Drone, the Anglican priest, preaches the Conservative message from his pulpit despite the fact his brother Edward Drone ran as an Independent on an anti-corruption platform. Likewise the Presbyterian minister supports the Conservative Party regardless of the fact that twenty-year veteran Liberal MP John Henry Bagshaw is a co- religionist and is seen as a supporter of that community. Professional solidarity is also rent asunder, as Judge Pepperleigh is a Conservative, Dr. Gallagher is a Liberal and Dr. Joe Milligan is a Conservative. Business solidarity is also rather tenuous. The Continental Hotel is used as Conservative election headquarters while Mariposa House is used by the Liberals. Prior to the 1911 election, Josh Smith maintained his hotel as a politically multi-partisan (or Independent-Liberal-Conservative-Imperialist) place. After Smith won his liquor licence back, he gained political favour by operating the best hotel in town and donating $100 to each of the established political parties, the Mariposa Hospital and other worthy charities. He paid the touring amusement ride operator enough cash so that all children could ride for free that day. Based on his growing popularity, Smith unexpectedly became the conservative candidate in the federal election of 1911. The main election issues were reciprocity and Naval Service, but Smith deftly sat on the fence on these issues. He deftly deflected all the mud the incumbent MP slung his way, and through deft manipulation of the mob mentality and telecommunications Smith achieved an electoral upset by defeating Bagshaw. He was, however, silent in victory. Culture and entertainment Culture and entertainment are intimately entwined in Mariposa. They are organized mainly along religious denominational lines but also in secular fraternal and civic societies, so these two components will be treated separately. Religious culture and entertainment The dominant religion is Anglicanism, and the Church of England Church (as it is locally known) is the venue for most Anglican pastimes Its programs include the Mother's Auxiliary, the Girls Auxiliary, the Infants School, the Book Club, the Bible Study Class, a choir, and Willing Workers of the Church of England and its youth wing the Early Workers‚Äô Guild. Dean Drone has served the church since about 1870, but his financial acumen is dubious. When he tore down the original stone church and erected a wooden replacement, the debt crushed the congregation. The Whirlwind Campaign designed to retire debt achieved only 0.04% of its ambitious $250,000 goal. The lay leadership including Gingham, Nivens and Mullins forced Drone to accept a curate to take over most of his duties, except the Infants School. Protestants are also active on the Mariposa cultural and religious scene. The Salvation Army conducts its street ministry at the main intersection downtown, and solicits funds as Smith's Hotel even though it is the watering hole in town. The Methodist Social has poetry readings, and the Presbyterian Church will even accept Anglicans like Zena Pepperleigh, the district judge's daughter, as curious visitors to its divine services. Roman Catholics understandably keep a low profile in town, since every July 12 the Orangemen's Parade is celebrated by Mariposans with flourish. St. Patrick's Day, St. Andrew's Day, St. George's Day, Independence Day and July 1 are also popularly celebrated. Despite the overt activity of the Orangemen, Catholics hold an annual summer picnic at which the Salvation Army band plays. Anglicans are also known to drop in on Catholic masses, but only in the city where their attendance is anonymous and will not lead to social complications. Secular culture and entertainment In addition to overt or primarily religious organizations operating directly as part of the diverse Christian denominations of Mariposa, there are many secular or ecumenical organizations the civic-minded resident may join. The Young Men's Christian Association offers a physical and spiritual outlet for Mariposians, especially those like bank clerk Peter Pupkin who moved to the town from away. Organized amateur sports are very popular in Mariposa. One may join the Ball Club, Lacrosse Club, Curling Club, Mariposa Canoe Club, Snow Shoe Club, and the Mariposa Tennis Club (behind Dr. Gallagher's house). Foot races are organized on Indian Island during Mariposa Belle excursions. Sleigh riding, sport fishing and duck hunting are also very popular solitary or small group pastimes. Music and dancing are incorporated into many secular activities, since these are often very circumscribed if not outright banned in a religious environment (except for the Salvation Army, which makes music a central part of its ministry). The uniformed town band, with at least ten members, plays its coronets every Wednesday in the municipal park. The Mariposa Quartette, the Oddfellows‚Äô Brass Band and the Knights of Pythias band are also active. The fundraising Firemen's Ball is the highlight of the winter social season, eclipsing even the Oyster Supper of Knights of Pythias. The usual fraternal societies were active in the town: Freemasons, Oddfellows, Foresters. More regional or local cross-denominational or secular organizations are: Knights of Pythias (which has Dean Drone as chaplain), Sons of Temperance (whose members sometimes stray) and The Girls‚Äô Friendly Society (since they are barred from the Pythians).

The centre opened on and is located near the junction of the M50 motorway and N4 road closely surrounded by Lucan to the west, Palmerstown Village to the east and Clondalkin to the south. The centre was a scaled-down replacement for a much larger complex once mooted for the site, known as Quarryvale, the development of which was highly controversial. After over a decade without major development, the centre was extended in 2016. Tenants Anchor tenants at the centre are Ireland's largest Marks & Spencer, Dunnes Stores, Next, and Ireland's largest Boots. In 2010 large H&M; and New Look fashions stores opened in the centre of the mall. The centre is home to Vue Dublin cinemas (formerly Ster Century Dublin). One of the anchor tenants at the time of opening was Ireland's only branch of C&A;, which closed when the parent firm exited the UK market. This unit was taken by Dunnes Stores. An associated retail park, The Retail Park, Liffey Valley, is nearby, with several warehouse-style stores. Renovations The front promenade of Liffey Valley post-renovation. In February 2015, Liffey Valley announced that it was to begin a ‚Ç¨26 million expansion of the shopping centre. The expansion had brought six new restaurants to the shopping centre including Prezzo and TGI Fridays. As well as expanding the Vue cinema and building a new Penneys which opened on 6 December 2016. Tesco opened in the summer of 2018. and was expected to create 450 new jobs. The construction of the Penneys Store marked the first new store opening in a decade, leading the branch at Liffey Valley to be more modernized, incorporating an Insomnia cafe within the confines of the shop. The general extensions at Liffey Valley attracted significant media interest,http://www.dailyedge.ie/new-penneys-liffey-valley-3122320-Dec2016/ and have rejuvenated the local economy. Further extensions were refused planning permission by An Bord Pleanala as they would be detrimental to traffic congestion.https://www.irishtimes.com/news/environment/planning- refused-for-extension-to-liffey-valley-centre-1.2971525 In April 2020 property group Hines submitted a ‚Ç¨135 million plan for a major extension to the Liffey Valley Centre in Dublin. The mixed leisure, entertainment and retail extension will include a large public plaza, and creating a new east-west street at the centre. There will also be two large retail units to either side of the plaza. Transport Liffey Valley is served by Dublin Bus and Go-Ahead Ireland routes 25, 25a, 25b, 25x, 26, 40, 51d, 66, 66a, 66b, 66x, 67, 67x, 76, 76a, 239 Planning impropriety For two decades an actual \\"town centre\\" had been planned in a central location to serve the Lucan, Clondalkin and Palmerstown areas. But Liffey Valley was built to the northeastern extremity of the area it was originally planned to serve. This meant, as noted by Jerry Barnes, chairman of the Royal Town Planning Institute, that the residents of Lucan, Clondalkin and Palmerstown \\"have been left for 20 years without an appropriately centrally located town centre which is easily accessible to all. This has very serious long-term implications for thousands of people\\". Thirty Dublin councillors were investigated by the Mahon Tribunal over allegations about accepting bribes relating to the rezoning of land in Quarryvale. Se√°n Ardagh was named in the tribunal's report as having received contributions from lobbyist Frank Dunlop and developer Owen O‚ÄôCallaghan, and the report names other councillors as \\"hopelessly compromised\\" due to their associations with the project.

Biography He was born in Pitaru, D√¢mbovi≈£a County, Wallachia now called Romania. In 1843 the family moved to Bucharest. At a young age (between 1846 and 1850), he became an apprentice at the workshop of the Czech painter Anton Chladek and created icons for the church of BƒÉicoi and the . In 1856 he created the historical composition Mihai scƒÉp√¢nd stindardul (Michael the Brave saving the flag), which he presented to the Wallachian Prince Barbu ≈ûtirbei, together with a petition asking for financial aid for his studies. Between 1856 and 1857, he painted the church of the Zamfira monastery, Prahova County, and in 1861 the church of the Agapia monastery. With the help of Mihail KogƒÉlniceanu, he received a scholarship to study in France. In the autumn of 1861, young Grigorescu left for Paris, where he studied at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts. He also attended the workshop of S√©bastien Cornu, where he had as a colleague Pierre-Auguste Renoir. Knowing his weaknesses, he concentrated drawing and composition. However, he soon left this workshop and, attracted by the artistic concepts of the Barbizon school, he left Paris for that village, where he became the associate of artists such as Jean-Fran√ßois Millet, Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot, Gustave Courbet and Th√©odore Rousseau. Under the influence of the movement, Grigorescu looked for new means of expression and followed the trend of en plein air painting, which was also important in Impressionism. As part of the Universal Exposition of Paris (1867), he contributed seven works. Then he exhibited at the Paris Salon of 1868 the painting T√¢nƒÉrƒÉ ≈£igancƒÉ (Young Gypsy girl). He returned to Romania a few times and starting in 1870 he participated in the exhibits of living artists and those organized by the Society of the Friends of the Belle-Arts. Between 1873 and 1874 he traveled to Italy, Greece and Vienna. In 1877 he was called to accompany the Romanian Army as a \\"frontline painter\\" in the Romanian War of Independence. During the battles at the Grivitsa Strongpoint and Oryahovo, he made drawings and sketches which later used in creating larger- scale works. In 1889 his work was featured in the Universal Exhibition in Paris and at the Romanian Atheneum. Centerpiece exhibits took place at the Romanian Atheneum would follow in 1891, 1895, 1897, 1902, and 1905. From 1879 to 1890 he worked in France, especially in Vitr√©, Brittany, and in his workshop in Paris. In 1890 he settled in C√¢mpina and started depicting pastoral themes, especially portraits of peasant girls, pictures of ox carts on dusty country roads and other landscapes. He was named honorary member of the Romanian Academy in 1899. At the moment of his death, Grigorescu had been working on his √éntoarcerea de la b√¢lci (The Return from the Fair).

Triangulation is also called losing a tempo or losing a move. Triangulation occurs most commonly in endgames with only kings and pawns when one king can maneuver on three adjacent squares in the shape of a triangle and maintain the basic position while the opposing king only has two such squares. Thus, if one king triangulates by using three moves to return to the original square and the opposing king cannot do the same, he has lost a crucial tempo and reached the same position with the other player to move. Triangulation can occur in other endgames and even in some middlegames . Example Consider this position, with White to move. Here, Black has the opposition, and is keeping the white king out. However, if White had the opposition (i.e. it were Black's move in this position), the black king would have to move away from d7 and allow the white king to advance. Black's king must stay close to where it is ‚Äì he must prevent the c-pawn from advancing and he must not let himself be driven to the edge of the board. The squares d5 and d7 are corresponding squares. When White's king is on d5, Black's king must be on d7, with White to move in order for Black to prevent the advance of the White king. White has a triangle of squares available: d5, e5, and d4. White can win by the following maneuver: : 1. Ke5! (if 1. c6+ then 1... Kc8 draws. If 1... bxc6+ then 2. Kc5 wins, see king and pawn versus king endgame.) : 1...Kc6 (if 1... Ke7 then 2. c6 and white wins by promoting the b pawn) : 2. Kd4 Kd7 : 3. Kd5 and now the triangulation is complete and we have the same position but with Black to move. White has gained the opposition and Black is now in zugzwang. There may follow: : 3. ... Kc8 : 4. Ke6! (diagonal opposition) Kd8 : 5. Kd6 (vertical opposition) Kc8 : 6. Ke7 Kb8 : 7. Kd7 Ka8 : 8. c6 and White will win . (There are other ways for White to win after his third move.) Triangulation with the king In this 1978 game between Lev Alburt and future World Champion Garry Kasparov,Alburt vs. Kasparov, 1978 Black wins by triangulating: :55...Kf5! :56. Kg1 Ke5 and White resigned. After 57. Kf1 Ke4! 58. Kf2 Kf4 59. Kf1 Kg3, Black wins the white pawn . Second example Triangulation can occur in endgames other than king and pawn endgames, such as this game in the 1965 Candidates Tournament, in which future World chess champion Boris Spassky defeated former world champion Mikhail Tal and won the right to challenge the then-current champion Tigran Petrosian.Tal vs. Spassky White would be in zugzwang if it were his move. Black achieves this through triangulation: : 64... Kd2 : 65. Re4 Kc3! : 66. Rh4 Kd3 : 67. 0-1 Now it is back to the same position, but with White to move, and now White is in zugzwang. White must lose the rook or allow the f-pawn to advance towards promotion . Example in king and pawn endgame Usually when a king triangulates in a king and pawn endgame, it is close to the other king and triangulation gains the opposition, putting the opponent in zugzwang. This position (from analysis of a game between Alexey Shirov and Alexander Grischuk in New Delhi in 2000) shows an example when the kings are far apart.Shirov vs. Grischuk White triangulates to put Black in zugzwang: : 1. Kh2! Kf7 : 2. Kg3 Ke8 : 3. Kg2! and amazingly Black is in zugzwang. The game could continue: : 3... g4 : 4. Kg3 Kf7 : 5. Kf4 Ke8 : 6. Ke5 Kf7 (Black cannot allow White to move Ke6) : 7. Kd5 g3 : 8. Kc6 g2 (If 8... Ke8 9. d7+ Kxe7 10. Kc7 and White wins easily) : 9. Kd7 g1=Q : 10. e8=Q+ and White wins . Triangulation with other pieces For an example of triangulation with a queen, see the queen versus rook position at Philidor position. The game Fischer versus Taimanov, fourth match game shows a similar tactic with a bishop. A rook can also perform the maneuver, but a knight cannot . Example with a rook In this game between future FIDE World Champion Veselin Topalov and former world champion Anatoly Karpov,Topalov vs. Karpov White triangulates with his rook to put Black in zugzwang: : 1. Rh7+! Kd8 : 2. Rh8+ Kd7 : 3. Rh6 back to the same position and Black is in zugzwang. The game continued: : 3... Kd8 : 4. Rh7 zugzwang again : 4... Rb4 : 5. Ka7 Ra4+ : 6. Kb6 1-0 .

Charles Robert Cockerell (27 April 1788 ‚Äì 17 September 1863) was an English architect, archaeologist, and writer. He studied architecture under Robert Smirke. He went on an extended Grand Tour lasting seven years, mainly spent in Greece. He was involved in major archaeological discoveries while in Greece. On returning to London he set up a successful architectural practise. Appointed Professor of Architecture at the Royal Academy of Arts he served in that position between 1839 and 1859. He wrote many articles and books on both archaeology and architecture. In 1848 he became the first recipient of the Royal Gold Medal. Background and education Charles Robert Cockerell was born in London on 27 April 1788,page 3, The Life and Work of C.R. Cockerell, David Watkin, 1974, Zwemmer Ltd, the third of eleven children of Samuel Pepys Cockerell, educated at Westminster School from 1802, where he received an education in Latin and the Classics.page 4, The Life and Work of C.R. Cockerell, David Watkin, 1974, Zwemmer Ltd, From the age of sixteen, he trained in the architectural practice of his father, who held the post of surveyor to East India House, and several London estates. From 1809 to 1810 Cockerell became an assistant to Robert Smirke,page 5, The Life and Work of C.R. Cockerell, David Watkin, 1974, Zwemmer Ltd, helping in the rebuilding of Covent Garden Theatre (the forerunner of today's Royal Opera House). Grand Tour Cockerell's depiction of the temple of Apollo at Bassae, 1860 On 14 April 1810 he set off on the Grand Tour.page 6, The Life and Work of C.R. Cockerell, David Watkin, 1974, Zwemmer Ltd, Due to the Napoleonic Wars much of Europe was closed to the British, so he headed for Cadiz, Malta and Constantinople (Istanbul); from there he went to Troy, finally arriving in Athens, Greece by January 1811.page 7, The Life and Work of C.R. Cockerell, David Watkin, 1974, Zwemmer Ltd, In Constantinople he met John Foster (architect) who would accompany him on his tour.page 8, The Life and Work of C.R. Cockerell, David Watkin, 1974, Zwemmer Ltd, In April 1811 he was in Aegina where he helped excavate the Temple of Aphaea (which he called the Temple of Jupiter),page 9, The Life and Work of C.R. Cockerell, David Watkin, 1974, Zwemmer Ltd, finding fallen fragmentary pediment sculptures (these are now in Germany), which he discovered were originally painted.page 18, The Life and Work of C.R. Cockerell, David Watkin, 1974, Zwemmer Ltd, On 18 August 1811 he set out with three companions from Zakynthos on a tour of Morea, aiming for the temple of Apollo Epicurius at Bassae in Arcadia.page 12, The Life and Work of C.R. Cockerell, David Watkin, 1974, Zwemmer Ltd, The magnificent Bassae Frieze that Cockerell discovered at the temple was eventually excavated and sold to the British Museum. His tour continued visiting, Sparta, Argos, Tiryns, Mycenae, Epidaurus and Corinth returning to Athens.page 13, The Life and Work of C.R. Cockerell, David Watkin, 1974, Zwemmer Ltd, It was there that he met Frederick North, who persuaded Cockerell and Foster to accompany him to Egypt,page 14, The Life and Work of C.R. Cockerell, David Watkin, 1974, Zwemmer Ltd, setting off in late 1811, they travelled via Crete, where North abandoned the idea, so Cockerell and Foster decided to visit the Seven churches of Asia and visit Hellenistic sites along the way, the itinerary was: Smyrna, Pergamon, Sardis, Ephesus, Priene and Side. They arrived in Malta on 18 July 1812, where Cockerell was confined to bed for three weeks with a fever. By 28 August 1812 they were in Sicily, where they stayed several months studying the chief Greek temples, drawing a reconstruction of the Temple of the Olympian Zeus, Agrigento. From December 1813 to February 1814 he was in Syracuse, Sicily working on drawings for a projected book on Aegina, Phigalia and the Bassae Frieze, he left to return to Athens where he continued work on the book, only to fall ill again on 22 August, he was still ill on 10 November, when he wrote to his sister. On his recovery he continued his travels, in January 1814 he was in Ioannina, where he had an audience with Ali Pasha.page 15, The Life and Work of C.R. Cockerell, David Watkin, 1974, Zwemmer Ltd, Returning to Athens, before going on in May 1814 to Zakynthos to attend the sale of the Bassae Frieze. Back in Athens he met an old school friend John Spencer Stanhope and his brother, between August and October he was struck down by the fever again, but was well enough to attend a celebration of the anniversary of the Battle of Salamis at Piraeus on 25 October. In December 1814 he returned to the Temple of Aphaea for a fortnight to check and correct his drawings.page 16, The Life and Work of C.R. Cockerell, David Watkin, 1974, Zwemmer Ltd, In a letter of 23 December 1814 he details his re-discovery of entasis, he enclosed a sketch for Robert Smirke of one of the Parthenon columns showing its outline.page 17, The Life and Work of C.R. Cockerell, David Watkin, 1974, Zwemmer Ltd, Thanks to the abdication of Napoleon in April 1814, the Kingdom of Sicily and Rome were now open to the British, so on 15 January 1815 Cockerell left for Naples in the company of Jakob Linckh, they visited Pompeii and only reached Rome on 28 July. The circle he mixed with in Rome included: Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, Antonio Canova, Bertel Thorvaldsen, Peter von Cornelius, Friedrich Wilhelm Schadow, Heinrich Maria von Hess, Ludwig Vogel, Johannes Riepenhausen, Franz Riepenhausen and the Knoering brothers. Writing to his father in August 1815 he said 'I should be out of my wits at the attention paid me here, I have an audience daily of savants, artists & amateurs who come and see my drawings; envoys and ambassadors beg to know when it will be convenient for me to show them some sketches; Prince Poniatowski and Prince Saxe-Gotha beg to be permitted to see them...'.

Cockerell, David Watkin, 1974, Zwemmer Ltd, Cockerell set about preparing his drawings of Greek antiquities for exhibition at the Royal Academy. Cockerell was living and working at 8 Old Burlington Street, it was owned by his father, where his office remained until 1830, he lived elsewhere on marrying in 1828.page 39, The Life and Work of C.R. Cockerell, David Watkin, 1974, Zwemmer Ltd, From 1832 to 1836 he rented as his office 34 Savile Row (which was at the bottom of the garden of 8 Old Burlington Street). Cockerell was a member of three gentlemen's clubs: Athenaeum Club, London, Travellers Club (he was a founder member, 5 May 1819) and Grillion's to which he was elected in 1822.page 42, The Life and Work of C.R. Cockerell, David Watkin, 1974, Zwemmer Ltd, In 1819 he was appointed Surveyor of the Fabric of St Paul's Cathedral,page 222, A Biographical Dictionary of British Architects 1600‚Äì1840, Howard Colvin, 2nd Edition 1978, John Murray, where his works included the replacement, in 1821, of the ball and cross on the dome. With Jacques Ignace Hittorff and Thomas Leverton Donaldson, Cockerell was also a member of the committee formed in 1836 to determine whether the Elgin Marbles and other Greek statuary in the British Museum had originally been coloured (see Transactions of the Royal Institute of British Architects for 1842). He was elected an Associate of the Royal 'Academy on 2 November 1829,page 58, Masterworks: Architecture at the Royal Academy of Arts, Neil Bingham, 2011 Royal Academy of Arts, and an academician on 10 February 1836, his diploma work being his design for the Palace of Westminster competition. In September 1839, he was appointed Professor of Architecture at the Academy, following the death of William Wilkins.page 105, The Life and Work of C.R. Cockerell, David Watkin, 1974, Zwemmer Ltd, He won the first Royal Gold Medal for architecture in 1848page 243, The Life and Work of C.R. Cockerell, David Watkin, 1974, Zwemmer Ltd, and became president of the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1860. In 1833, following the resignation of Sir John Soane, he became surveyor to the Bank of England, and made additions to its London building, as well as designing branch offices in Manchester, Liverpool, Bristol, and Plymouth. His exhibits at the Royal Academy included reconstructions of ancient Rome and Athens and a capriccio entitled \\"Tribute to the Memory of Sir Christopher Wren, being a Collection of his Principal Works\\"; these became well known through published engravings As an archaeologist, Cockerell is remembered for removing the reliefs from the temple of Apollo at Bassae, near Phigalia, which are now in the British Museum. Replicas of these reliefs were included in the frieze of the library of the Travellers Club. The Royal Academy of Arts composed a brief commemorative biography of Cockerell, including the following sentiment which speaks of his great work as a student of architecture: > At the heart of Cockerell's emotional experience of the power of the antique > to fire the imagination lay an extraordinary visual sensitivity to the mass > and volume of the components of architecture, which for him were never mere > abstract, weightless forms or quotations borrowed from the past, but acted > together as a constantly renewable expression of man's innate need to create > beauty on earth. Architectural career Cockerell's Hanover Chapel, in 1828 Cockerell had grave doubts about the wisdom of using Greek Revival architecture in nineteenth-century England, in his diary of 1821 he had this to say:page 65, The Life and Work of C.R. Cockerell, David Watkin, 1974, Zwemmer Ltd, > Until the attention of the world was drawn to the study of Greece by the > spirit of the last century by Barth√©lemy's Anacharsis & thence to the study > of Greek architecture by the researches of Stuart & Revett architecture had > for its guide this Country the Old Italian masters & their valuable > commentaries & publications of the anc[ien]t arch[itectur]e of Rome and > Italy. No great enormities could arise under such guidance, but since the > rage for Greek has been amongst us all the rules which formerly protected us > are now set aside & we are at sea without compas ...we stick a slice of an > anc[ien]t Greek Temple to a Barn which is called breadth & simplicity, than > which nothing can be more absurd, as the Greek Houses were certainly of wood > & brick & plaister [Sic] painted & temporary things. I am sure that the > grave & solemn arch[itectur]e of Temples were never adopted to Houses, but a > much lighter style, as we may judge by the vases, the object being space & > commodiousness. Cockerell's first building (1818‚Äì20) was in the style of Tudor architecture, the brick building at Harrow School, now known as the 'old schools' has twin crow-stepped gables.page 135, The Life and Work of C.R. Cockerell, David Watkin, 1974, Zwemmer Ltd, His next commission was the classical Hanover Chapel (1821‚Äì25) Regent Street, with its twin towers and projecting tetrastyle Ionic portico, later demolished (1896). Personal life On 23 March 1828 he proposed marriage to, and was accepted by, Anna Maria Rennie (daughter of John Rennie the Elder) while strolling in the grounds of Dalmeny House, Scotland, she was twenty-five, and he was nearly forty.page 51, The Life and Work of C.R. Cockerell, David Watkin, 1974, Zwemmer Ltd, The engagement ring was bought for ¬£27 10s 0d in Edinburgh on 29 March and the wedding took place on 4 June 1828 in St James's Church, Piccadilly, the Bishop of London William Howley officiated. The honeymoon started at Liphook, moving on to Chichester, the Isle of Wight, crossing to Portsmouth where they toured the Dockyard, and finally on 14 June The Grange, Northington .pages 51‚Äì52, The Life and Work of C.R. Cockerell, David Watkin, 1974, Zwemmer Ltd, The couple set up home at 87 Eaton Square.page 41, The Life and Work of C.R. Cockerell, David Watkin, 1974, Zwemmer Ltd, In 1838 the family moved to Ivy House, North End, Hampstead. The first of their ten children, a son, Robert Charles was born in 1829 but died five years later, followed in 1832 by the second son John Rennie, a daughter in 1832, then in 1833 a son Frederick Pepys Cockerell who became an architect, followed in 1834 by Robert who became a soldier and died aged twenty in the Battle of Alma, then two more daughters and three sons, the youngest Samuel Pepys (1844‚Äì1921) would edit and publish in 1903 his father's travel diaries. By 1851 Cockerell was in poor health and spent that summer recuperating at his sister Anne Pollen's house in Somerset,page 244, The Life and Work of C.R. Cockerell, David Watkin, 1974, Zwemmer Ltd, from this time on his architectural practice virtually ceased. The family moved to 13 Chester Terrace, it was here that he died on 17 September 1863, aged 75. He was buried in the crypt of St Paul's Cathedral, a perk of being the cathedral's surveyor, his marble tomb consists of his profile portrait, suspended from an Ionic column, surrounded by rich embellishment.page 284, St. Paul's The Cathedral Church of London 604‚Äì2004, Derek Keene.

He is the lead singer/guitarist and songwriter of the bands Streetlight Manifesto and Bandits of the Acoustic Revolution, and goes by the pseudonym Toh Kay as a solo performer. He is the former lead singer/guitarist for 3rd-wave ska band Catch 22, but left the band after making only one album (their debut, Keasbey Nights) to attend Savannah College of Art and Design in Savannah, Georgia, for visual art. According to the booklet of Somewhere in the Between, Kalnoky attended Rutgers University. He is the owner of Pentimento Music Company, a record company. Biography Kalnoky's family (which is a historical family from Transylvania, back then being part of Hungary, now belongs to Romania) emigrated from Czechoslovakia to the U.S. in 1985, when he was 5 years old. He has one brother, Achilles, who is a year older than he is. During a live performance in Greece in 2008, Tomas stated that he was of Greek descent and had lived in the country for several years. He, however, had to leave the country because due to his Greek citizenship, he would have had to serve in the Greek Military. At a show at the Glass House in Pomona, CA, Kalnoky stated that he lived close by in the same city and was revealing this information only because he had just moved recently. Tomas Kalnoky performing live in 2008 Kalnoky said he learned to play guitar because of influence from The Beatles. His first foray into the music world began with the punk band Gimp, with whom he released one cassette, Smiles for Macavity, before moving onto Catch 22 (with fellow Gimp members drummer Chris Greer and bassist Jason Scharenguivel). It was in Gimp that Kalnoky first wrote the song \\"Supernothing\\" which later appeared on the Catch 22 demo Rules of the Game (EP) and the album Keasbey Nights. However, the original version is a much slower acoustic song, which features Kalnoky's brother Achilles on violin (Achilles would later appear on the Bandits EP A Call to Arms, as well as on the first volume of \\"99 songs of Revolution\\"). Kalnoky is involved in The RISC Group, of which very little is known. After Kalnoky departed Catch 22, three ex-members of Catch 22, Tomas Kalnoky, Josh Ansley, and Jamie Egan, joined with three ex-One Cool Guy members, Stuart Karmatz, Dan Ross, and Pete Sibilia, to form Streetlight Manifesto. Despite the horn section, Kalnoky is hesitant to brand them \\"ska\\" saying, \\"Ska is something that you have to tread so lightly with because there are so many, ironically, Nazi-like purists out there who will rip you apart because you don't fit the part of the 'ska band'\\". Kalnoky's influences are many, the blending of which creates Streetlight's signature sound. Kalnoky cites The Drifters as a favorite band. Other musical influences include Bad Religion, Nirvana, The Suicide Machines, Squirrel Nut Zippers, and The Dead Milkmen. He has mentioned Czech folk singer Jaromir Nohavica as one of his musical heroes. During one of his early interviews, Kalnoky cited American pop-folk singer Mason Jennings as one of his current CD's playing in his car. Streetlight Manifesto recorded Jennings' Birds Flying Away as a track on \\"99 Songs of Revolution.\\" On another note, Tomas Kalnoky said outside a concert in Montreal in 2015 that his favourite author is Kurt Vonnegut. During the 2009 Van's Warped Tour Tomas fractured his arm in a bicycle accident, rendering him incapable of playing guitar. Guitar player Sean P. Rogan of Big D and the Kids Table filled Tomas' spot on guitar while his arm healed. Tomas continued, however, to take up the microphone and sing the band's set. Kalnoky is a self-proclaimed perfectionist, explaining the persistent delay of Streetlight Manifesto's second original album, Somewhere in the Between, and the next album by the Bandits of the Acoustic Revolution, which he says \\"Will be released by the end of this decade.\\" In 2010, Streetlight Manifesto released the first volume of 99 Songs of Revolution, the first of \\"...8 or so records that focus entirely on playing music that other musicians have written.\\" One of the songs however, \\"They Provide the Paint for the Picture Perfect Masterpiece that You Will Paint on the Insides of Your Eyelids,\\" is originally written by Tomas and performed by his \\"side project,\\" Bandits of the Acoustic Revolution. The project/record was originally planned to be solely by Bandits of the Acoustic Revolution, but, as time went on, it faded into a project containing both Streetlight and BOTAR, as well as 2 other potential bands. For this reason, BOTAR has been called \\"the single least prolific musical group on the face of the planet,\\" by the Pentimento Music Company, a member of the RISC Group. Also in 2010, Kalnoky released a split CD with Dan Potthast entitled You By Me: Vol. 1, under the pseudonym \\"Toh Kay.\\" The first official Toh Kay music video is his interpretation of \\"I've Set Sail,\\" originally by Dan Potthast, animated by Eric Power of Inked Reality. On January 29, 2013, Kalnoky announced that he would perform 7 shows as part of The Revival Tour alongside Chuck Ragan, Dave Hause of The Loved Ones, Jenny Owen Youngs, Rocky Votolato, Jenny O., and Tim McIlrath of Rise Against. He would later announce 5 additional dates. Toh Kay released You By Me: Vol. 2 with fellow Pentimento Artist Sycamore Smith.

It opened in October 1996 and was extended in 2004 to create extra retail space. It lies in the administration of Fingal County Council. The Blanchardstown Centre is served by over 600 bus movements per day, and is close to Dublin's M50 radial motorway, and adjacent to the M3 motorways. In June 2016 the centre was sold to the Blackstone Group by Green Property for an estimated ‚Ç¨950m. Stores The centre contains over 180 stores, including banking outlets and dining facilities, three retail parks and 7,000 free car parking spaces. The anchor stores in the shopping centre itself include Dunnes, Penney's (Primark), and Marks and Spencer. A former anchor, Debenhams Ireland, was closed in April 2020. Other tenants include H&M;, Superdry Store, Vero Moda, Jack & Jones, River Island, JD, Topshop/Topman, BT2 and Zara. The Blanchardstown Centre is also home to Ireland's largest TK Maxx store, Lifestyle Sports and 53 Degrees North, all of which are located in the \\"fashion park\\". Surrounding the centre are three retail parks, two of which are part of the centre, whilst the other, WestEnd Shopping Park, is operated separately and features stores such as New Look, Argos, Lidl, Dealz, Nike Outlet, Heatons and Next. Harvey Norman, Smyths Toys, Currys, PC World, Waltons Music, Elvery's Sports and DFS Sofas are also located in the retail parks around the centre. The complex includes a 9-screen cinema operated by Odeon Cinemas and a Leisureplex entertainment centre.  Non-retail developments  Other amenities located in or adjacent to the centre include the Draiocht arts centre, as well as Ireland's \\"largest purpose built public library\\". At the time of building, Greater Blanchardstown had a population of over 120,000, and this figure was growing due to its location near the M50 and beside the M3. In the period that followed the 1996 opening of the retail spaces, additional commercial and office spaces were leased to eBay, Fingal County Council and Liberty Insurance - who relocated their headquarters to the site, bringing \\"over 1,300 staff to the area daily\\". The Crowne Plaza hotel chain also built a four-star 200-bedroom hotel within the development in 2008. Plans From early 2009, plans had been published which set to extend the centre by with a new \\"Yellow Mall\\" extension. These plans included a three- storey complex with a new anchor store, 17 new shops and a food court located on the second floor, as well as a two-storey underground carpark. These plans proposed eight new restaurants for the exterior. As of January 2016, when the centre was put up for sale, these plans had not been executed. In June 2016, the centre was sold (together with this planning approval) to the Blackstone Group by Green Property for an estimated ‚Ç¨950m.

Loch Garry is much photographed from the A87 for its romantic setting and also because a quirk of perspective makes it appear like a map of Scotland. Both lochs have been dammed for hydro-electric, the dam on Loch Quoich being the largest rockfill dam in Scotland at 320 m long and 38 m high. Water is fed by tunnel to the two power stations each producing 20MW, and the scheme was completed in 1962. The Glen used to be home of the Clan MacDonell of Glengarry, but since the Highland Clearances the population has been reduced to a handful of estates. The main activities are deerstalking and forestry, with little tourism apart from munro-baggers seeking some spectacularly remote mountains at the head of the glen. The lonely road along the north side of Loch Garry continues past Loch Quoich to Kinlochhourn from where a footpath continues to Knoydart.

Ballast Island is a small, 4.89 km¬≤ private island in Lake Erie, about northeast of the northeast tip of South Bass Island. It is known primarily as a navigation point for boats going to or from Put-in-Bay from the east. There are shoals between Ballast and South Bass, but there is a passage between known locally as \\"the wagon tracks\\". Ballast Island received its name when commodore Oliver Hazard Perry used rocks from this island, according to legend, to ballast his ships. George William Gardner purchased Ballast Island from Lemuel Brown in 1874 according to Ottawa County Records. The deeds show that Brown acquired the island from Joseph de Rivera St. Jurgo in 1869. Lemuel Brown was a half-breed Erie Indian who had married the daughter of the chief of the Erie Indians who claimed all the islands. Commodore Gardner was a well-known Clevelander who served as Mayor from 1886-1890. He founded the Cleveland Yacht Club in 1878 and served as Commodore until 1895. He also organized the Inter Lake Yachting Association in 1884 and was its commodore until 1894. The Greater Cleveland Sports Hall of fame honored him in 1981. After completing his purchase of Ballast, Commodore Gardner sold to his friends, including Henry Corning, Will Claflin and Civil War General James Barnett, undivided interests with the right to build a cottage. The island then became a cooperative association of wealthy families. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Ballast Island flourished. A large hotel and dining hall were constructed high on the cliffs of the north side of the island. A windmill supplied water and carbide lanterns supplied light. During this time many cottages were built around the east and west shores along with the Gardner Log Cabin. Over the years the Gardner family has lived in this log house, including George W., his son George Henry, Kenneth and Constance Gardner, and currently the daughter of Ken and Constance. During the 1890-early 1900 time span the southeast corner of Ballast facing Buckeye Point on South Bass was adorned by a boat house. This boat house served as the headquarters for the Longworth Canoe club. The canoe club was named after Nicholas Longworth, who was the father-in-law of Theodore Roosevelts's daughter, Alice. Presidents Theodore Roosevelt, William McKinley, James Garfield and Grover Cleveland all have visited Ballast. During the depression years, Ballast was not used as often because of the expense. In the 1930s and 1940s the steamers Goodtime, Put-in-Bay, and Chippewa brought friends to the island, and Ballast once again flourished. In the 1950s, several owners died but the partition deed that was in place, held. This was because one of the original signers, Constance \\"Kiki\\" Gardner was still living. In 1958 one of Kiki's daughters, Constance Gardner Moore offered to buy Roseanne Gilmore's property. The offer was accepted and the Moore family became part owners of Ballast Island. At the same time two other sections of Ballast Island were for sale. They were purchased by a Cleveland businessperson.

James Gibbs (23 December 1682 ‚Äì 5 August 1754) was one of Britain's most influential architects. Born in Scotland, he trained as an architect in Rome, and practised mainly in England. He is an important figure whose work spanned the transition between English Baroque architecture and a Georgian architecture heavily influenced by Andrea Palladio. Among his most important works are St Martin-in-the-Fields (at Trafalgar Square), the cylindrical, domed Radcliffe Camera at Oxford University, and the Senate House at Cambridge University Gibbs very privately was a Roman Catholic and a Tory, because of this and his age had a somewhat removed relation to the Palladian movement which came to dominate English architecture during his career. The Palladians were largely Whigs, led by Lord Burlington and Colen Campbell, a fellow Scot who developed a rivalry with Gibbs. Gibbs' professional Italian training under the Baroque master Carlo Fontana also set him uniquely apart from the Palladian school.Howard Colvin, A Biographical Dictionary of British Architects, 1600‚Äì1840, 3rd ed. 1995, s.v. \\"Gibbs, James\\". However, despite being unfashionable, he gained a number of Tory patrons and clients, and became hugely influential through his published works, which became popular as pattern books for architecture. The naming of the Gibbs surround for doors and windows, which he certainly did not invent, testifies to this influence. His architectural style did incorporate Palladian elements, as well as forms from Italian Baroque and Inigo Jones (1573‚Äì1652), but was most strongly influenced by the work of Sir Christopher Wren (1632‚Äì1723), who was an early supporter of Gibbs. Overall, Gibbs was an individual who formed his own style independently of current fashions. Architectural historian John Summerson describes his work as the fulfilment of Wren's architectural ideas, which were not fully developed in his own buildings.Summerson, pp.330, 333 Despite the influence of his books, Gibbs, as a stylistic outsider, had little effect on the later direction of British architecture, which saw the rise of Neoclassicism shortly after his death. Biography=Background and education Born on 23 December 1682 in Fittysmire, Aberdeen,Friedman, p.3 Scotland, a younger son of a Patrick Gibbs merchant and his second wife Ann n√©e Gordon, the family was Roman Catholic; there was a half-brother William from the first marriage to Isabel n√©e Farquhar.Friedman, p.2 He was educated at Aberdeen Grammar School and Marischal College.Friedman, p.4 After the death of his parents he went in 1700 to stay with relatives in Holland. He later travelled through Europe, visiting Flanders, France, Switzerland and Germany. Some time after he left for Rome travelling via France. On 12 October 1703 he registered as a student at The Scots College.Friedman, p.5 He would have been studying for the Catholic priesthood but had second thoughts. By the end of 1704 he was studying architecture under Carlo Fontana;Friedman, p.6 he was also taught by Pietro Francesco Garroli, professor of perspective at the Accademia di San Luca.Friedman, p.7 While in Rome Gibbs met John Perceval, 1st Earl of Egmont who attempted to persuade him to move to Ireland. He moved to London in November 1708; his return to Britain was probably due to the terminal illness of his half-brother William, who died before James reached Britain.Little, p.25 Career Still intending to take up the offer of work in Ireland, he had been befriended by John Erskine, Earl of Mar, while abroad. The Earl persuaded Gibbs to remain in London, offering him his first commission, alterations to his house in Whitehall. Around this time he met Edward Harley, 2nd Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer, who would be a powerful patron and friend (Gibbs would later remodel the Earl's house Wimpole Hall) and James Brydges, 1st Duke of Chandos (for whom he would be one of the architects to work at Cannons from 1715 to 1719Friedman, p.13). Gibbs was one of the sixty founder members of Godfrey Kneller's Academy of Painting, founded in 1711.Friedman, p.20 In August 1713 Gibbs discovered that William Dickinson was resigning as architect from the Commission for Building Fifty New Churches; the commissioners included Sir Christopher Wren, Sir John Vanbrugh and Thomas Archer. With the backing of, amongst others, the Earl of Mar and Sir Christopher Wren, Gibbs was appointed architect to the commission on 18 November 1713,Friedman, p.10 where he would have worked with Nicholas Hawksmoor, his fellow architect to the commission. But a combination of events would ensure Gibbs was deprived of his place as architect to the commission by December 1715: Queen Anne had died and a Whig government had replaced the Tories; and the failure of the 1715 Jacobite rising that was supported by the Earl of Mar were all factors. Still he was able to complete one church, St Mary-le-Strand, that he described as \\"the first publick (sic) building I was employed in after my arrival from Italy; which being situated in a very publick place, the Commissioners... spar'd no cost to beautify\\". On 18 December 1716 Gibbs joined the \\"Vandykes clubb\\" (sic), also called the Club of St Luke for \\"Virtuosi in London\\". Fellow architects who were members included William Kent and William Talman; other notable members with whom Gibbs would later work included the garden designer Charles Bridgeman and the sculptor John Michael Rysbrack, who sculpted many of the memorials Gibbs designed.Friedman, p.21 In March 1721 Charles Bridgeman, James Thornhill, John Wootton and Gibbs were all travelling together from London to Wimpole Hall where they were all working for Edward Harley, the Earl of Oxford; Thornhill recalled that they drank Harley's \\"healths over and over, as well in our civil as bacchanalian hours\\" and talked \\"of building, pictures and may be towards the close of politics or religion\\".Friedman, p.23 In 1720 Gibbs was invited along with other architects to enter a competition to design a new church to replace the dilapidated church of St Martin-in-the-Fields. He won, and on 24 November 1720 he was appointed architect of the new church,page 21 St Martin- in-the-fields, Malcolm Johnson, 2005, Phillimore, which was to be his most famous building. Horace Walpole described Gibbs as being around 1720 as \\"the architect most in vogue\\".Page 45, 'Anecdotes of Painting in England' 1771 In 1720 Gibbs was approached by the Provost of King's College, Cambridge to complete the college. The scheme consisted of three buildings, all high, forming a courtyard to the south of the Chapel. In the end only the western block, the long Fellows' Building, was constructed from 1721 to 1724; the eastern Fellows' Building would have been identical, and the southern building would have had a great octastyle Corinthian portico, and been long, containing the great dining hall, Provost's Lodge and offices.pages 27 to 29, the Architectural Drawings Collection of King's College, Cambridge, Allan Doig, 1979, Avebury Publishing On 11 December 1721 Edward Lany, one of the Syndics of University of Cambridge, thanked Edward Harley Earl of Oxford for sending \\"Mr Gibbs's design for our building. I design to offer it to the Syndics as soon as they meet...I have not skill enough myself to judge of it\\".Friedman, p.225 This referred to a design for a new central building for the University to house the library, Senate House, the Consistory and Register Offices. Gibbs produced a second larger design in 1722, consisting of a courtyard building with two projecting wings to the east, . Work started on the building in November 1722, but in the end only the Senate House, , the northern of the two east wings, was built. It was finished in 1730. By 1723 Gibbs was rich enough to open an account at Drummonds Bank, with his first year's balance being ¬£1055 11 shillings 4 pence.Friedman, p.15 1723 also saw Gibbs being made a governor of St Bartholomew's Hospital;Friedman, p.214 other governors included fellow architects Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington and George Dance the Elder. On 1 August 1728 it was decided to rebuild the Hospital. Gibbs offered his service for free, and designed a quadrangle of with four near-identical plain blocks. In March 1726 Gibbs was made a member of the Society of Antiquaries of London.Friedman, p.16 and in 1727 he was awarded with the only government post he ever held, Architect of the Ordnance, which he held for life. He was given it thanks to the Duke of Argyll who was Master of the Ordnance and in 1729 he was elected to the Royal Society. One of the most serious disappointments of Gibbs's career was his failure to win the commission for the Mansion House, London. There were two competitions for the building, both of which he entered ‚Äì the first in 1728 and a second in 1735; in the end George Dance the Elder won the commission.Friedman, p.222 In 1735, Gavin Hamilton painted A Conversation of Virtuosis... at the Kings Arms, a group portrait that included Michael Dahl, George Vertue, John Wootton, Gibbs and Rysbrack, along with other artists who were instrumental in bringing the Rococo style to English design and interiors.Friedman, p.22 After the death in 1736 of Nicholas Hawksmoor, who was architect for the Radcliffe Camera, Gibbs was appointed on 4 March 1737 to replace him.page xii, The Building Accounts of the Radcliffe Camera, S.G. Gillam, 1958, Oxford University Press The Radcliffe Camera was finished by 19 May 1749.page xviii, The Building Accounts of the Radcliffe Camera, S.G. Gillam, 1958, Oxford University Press Gibbs was awarded by Oxford University an honorary degree of Master of Arts in 1749 recognition of the completion of the Radcliffe Camera. Collections A list of the nearly 700 books in his library is preserved in the Bodleian Library.Little, p.164 While architecture and related crafts made up the bulk of his books, other subjects covered included antiquities, coins, and heraldry; histories of England, Scotland and Rome and other nations; literature including works by Alexander Pope, Jonathan Swift, Daniel Defoe and Matthew Prior; travel books including Egypt, the South Seas, Russia, Hungary, Lapland, Virginia, Ceylon and Abyssinia; missionary travels including China, Formosa, Guinea, Borneo and the East Indies; books on religion including both Anglican and Roman Catholic works; and even cookery books. The most significant of the architectural works were Vincenzo Scamozzi's L'Idea dell'Architettura Universale, Sebastiano Serlio's Sette Libri d'Architettura, Domenico Fontana's Della transportatione dell'obelisco Vaticano e delle fabriche di Sisto V, Colen Campbell's Vitruvius Britannicus, Giacomo Leoni's The Architecture of A. Palladio, in Four Books, William Kent's The Designs of Inigo Jones and Robert Wood's The ruins of Palmyra. Gibbs is also known to have owned at least 117 paintings, including works by Canaletto, Giovanni Paolo Panini, Sebastiano Ricci, Antoine Watteau and Willem van de Velde the Younger.Little, p.23 Sculptures owned by Gibbs included a bust of Flora by Fran√ßois Girardon, a bust of Matthew Prior by Antoine Coysevox and busts of Alexander Pope and Gibbs by Rysbrack. Death and will Gibb's memorial, St Marylebone Parish Church James Gibbs by John Michael Williams c.1737‚Äì40 By 1743 Gibbs, who was fond of wine and food, was described as \\"corpulent\\".Little, p.168 In June 1749 Gibbs set out for the spa town of Aix- la-Chapelle for treatment: he long suffered from kidney stones and had lost weight and was in pain. He remained until September when he returned to London.Friedman, p.18 Gibbs never married.Little, p.163 He died in his London house on the corner of Wimpole Street and Henrietta Street on 5 August 1754 and was buried in St Marylebone Parish Church, and a modest wall tablet was erected with this inscription : > Underneath lye the Remains of JAMES > GIBBS Esqr. whose Skill in Architecture > appears by his Printed Works as well > as the Buildings directed by him, > Among other Legacys & Charitys > He left One Hundred Pounds towards > Enlarging this Church > He died Augt. 5th. 1754. > Aged 71. > In his will made on 9 May 1754, Gibbs left ¬£1000, his Plate, and three houses in Marylebone to Lord Erskine in gratitude for favours from his father the late Earl of Mar. Further bequests included ¬£1,400 and two houses in Marylebone and Argyll Ground Westminster to John Sherwine of Soho plus ¬£100 to be given to a charity of Sherwine's daughters choice, to Robert Pringle of Clifton a Cavendish Square house and ¬£400 and to Cosmo Alexander (1724‚Äì1772) a Scottish painter \\"my house I live in withall [sic] its furniture as it stands with pictures bustoes [sic] etc\\". Further bequests of ¬£100 each went to William Thomas, Dr. William King, St Bartholomew's Hospital and the Foundling Hospital. The Trustees of Radcliffe Camera were given \\"all my printed books, Books of Architecture books of prints and drawings books of maps and a pair of globes with leather covers to be placed ... in the library... of which I was architect ... next to my Bustoe\\".Friedman, pp.17‚Äì20 The Palazzo Branconio dall'Aquila, Rome, inspiration for Gibbs' St Mary le Strand Architecture=Early works Mar attached Gibbs' name among the list of architects to be responsible for the new churches to be built under the Act for Fifty New Churches, and in 1713 he was appointed one of the Commission's two surveyors, the contemporary term for an architect, alongside Nicholas Hawksmoor. He held this post for two years, until he was forced out by the Whigs, because of his Tory sympathies, and replaced by John James.Summerson, p.280 During his tenure he completed his first important commission, the church of St Mary-le-Strand (1714‚Äì17), in the City of Westminster. A previous design had been prepared by the English Baroque architect Thomas Archer, which Gibbs developed in an Italian Mannerist style, influenced by the Palazzo Branconio dall'Aquila in Rome, attributed to Raphael, as well as incorporating elements from Wren.Summerson, p.286 Such strong Italian influence was not popular with the Whigs, who were now taking political control following the accession of King George I in 1714, leading to Gibbs' dismissal, and causing him to modify the foreign influences in his work.Summerson, p.324 Colen Campbell's Vitruvius Britannicus (1715), which promoted the Palladian style, also contains unfavourable comments regarding Carlo Fontana and St Mary-le-Strand. Campbell went on to replace Gibbs as the architect of Burlington House around 1717, where the latter had designed the offices and colonnades for the young Lord Burlington. Design for the pavilions at Stowe; the stone pyramidal roof is no longer atop either pavilion Other early designs include the house of Cannons, Middlesex (1716‚Äì20), for James Brydges, 1st Duke of Chandos, and the tower of Wren's St Clement Danes (1719).Summerson, p.325 At Twickenham he designed the pavilion at Orleans House, called the Octagon Room, for a Scottish patron, James Johnston (1655‚Äì1737) former Secretary of State for Scotland, about 1720.Illustrated in Gibbs, A Book of Architecture plate 71: Colvin 1995. It is the only part of the house and grounds that has survived. Country houses Gibbs' mature style emerges in the early 1720s, with the house of Ditchley, Oxfordshire (1720‚Äì22), for George Lee, 2nd Earl of Lichfield. It typifies his conservative domestic manner, which changed little throughout the rest of his career.Summerson, p.326 His other houses include Sudbrooke Lodge, Petersham (1728), for the Duke of Argyll, works at Wimpole Hall, Cambridgeshire, for the 2nd Earl of Oxford, Patshull Hall, Staffordshire (1730) for Sir John Astley, and modifications to Colen Campbell's designs at Houghton Hall in Norfolk. Gibbs also completed the Gothic Temple (1741‚Äì48), a triangular folly at Stowe, Buckinghamshire, and now one of the properties leased and maintained by The Landmark Trust. Other garden buildings at Stowe include the pair of \\"Boycott Pavilions\\", which were altered by Giovanni Battista Borra in 1754 to replace the pyramidal stone roofs with more conventional domes.Colvin 1995. St Martin- in-the-Fields, London, is the prototype of many New England churches. Churches Gibbs designed one church for the Commission for Building Fifty New Churches, St Mary le Strand. Construction began in 1714 and it was complete by 1717. Between 1721 and 1726 Gibbs designed his most important and influential work, the church of St Martin-in-the-Fields, located in Trafalgar Square, London. Gibbs' initial radical design for the commission was for a circular church, derived from a design by Andrea Pozzo; its illustration in Gibbs' book was to influence several adaptations by Neoclassical architects.Summerson, p.327 This was rejected by the commission, and Gibbs developed the present rectangular design. The layout and detailing of the building owes much to Wren, in particular the church of St James', Piccadilly.Summerson, p.328 However, Gibbs' innovation at St Martin's was to place the steeple centrally, behind the pediment.Summerson, p.330 By contrast, Wren's steeples were usually adjacent to the church, rather than within the walls. This apparent incongruity was criticised at the time, but St Martin-in- the-Fields nevertheless became a model for church buildings, particularly for Anglican worship, across Britain and around the world. At the same time, Gibbs designed a chapel of ease for the 1st Earl of Oxford, now known as St Peter, Vere Street (1721‚Äì24). In 1725 he designed All Saints', Derby, now Derby Cathedral, on similar lines to St Martin's, although at Derby the original gothic steeple was retained. Gibbs, the first British architect to do so,Colvin 1995 created numerous designs for funeral monuments, often collaborating with the sculptor Michael Rysbrack. In 1733 Gibbs was commissioned by Lord Foley to adapt the chapel from Cannons House (Gibbs was one of the architects involved in designing Cannons), as the parish church at Great Witley.Page 325-6, Terry Friedman, James Gibbs, 1984, Yale University Press St Bartholomew's Hospital In 1723 Gibbs was appointed a governor of St Bartholomew's Hospital,Friedman, p.213 which led to him being commissioned to redesign the hospital. In 1728 he produced a design with four near identical blocks around a square ; he gave his services for free. The first block to be built, the north, administration block was constructed from 9 June 1730, using Bath Stone (this would be used for all the blocks). It was finished in 1732 and contains the Great Hall and the main staircase, the walls of which are covered by murals painted by William Hogarth, depicting Christ healing the sick at the Pool of Bethesda and the parable of the good Samaritan. The other blocks contained wards. The south block was built from 1735 to 1740 (demolished 1937). the west block was built from 1743 to 1753; it was delayed due to the War of the Austrian Succession. The east block was built 1758‚Äì68 to Gibbs' design. The North block, St Bartholomew's Hospital, London Universities Fellows' Building, King's College, Cambridge Gibbs worked at both Oxford and Cambridge Universities. He shares the credit, with James Burrough, for designing the Senate House at Cambridge.T. P. Hudson, \\"James Gibbs's Design for University Buildings at Cambridge\\", The Burlington Magazine 114 (1972): 844. The Fellows' Building at King's College (1724‚Äì30) is his work entirely. A simple composition, similar in style to his houses, the building is enlivened by a central feature incorporating an arch, within a doric portal, and a Diocletian window, all under a pediment. This mannerist composition of features from Wren and Palladio is an example of Gibbs' more adventurous Italian style. The Radcliffe Camera, Oxford More adventurous still was Gibbs' last major work, the Radcliffe Camera, Oxford (1739‚Äì49). A circular library building was first planned by Hawksmoor around 1715, but nothing was done at the time. Sometime before 1736, new designs were submitted by Hawksmoor and Gibbs, with the latter's rectangular design being preferred. However, this plan was abandoned in favour of a circular plan by Gibbs, which drew on Hawksmoor's 1715 scheme, although it was very different in detail.Summerson, p.333 Gibbs' design saw him returning to his Italian mannerist sources, and in particular shows the influence of Santa Maria della Salute, Venice (1681), by Baldassarre Longhena. The building incorporates unexpected vertical alignments: for instance, the ribs of the dome do not line up with the columns of the drum, but lie in between, creating a rhythmically complex composition. Gibbs' designs for three chimney pieces plate 91 from A Book of Architecture Published works Gibbs published the first edition of A Book of Architecture, containing designs of buildings and ornaments in 1728, dedicated to one of his patrons John Campbell, 2nd Duke of Argyll. It was a folio of his building designs both executed and not, as well as numerous designs for ornaments and including 150 engraved plates covering 380 different designs. He was the first British architect to publish a book devoted to his own designs.page 210, British Architectural Books and Writers 1556‚Äì1785, Eileen Harris, 1990, Cambridge University Press, The major works illustrated include St Martin-in-the-Fields (including the unexecuted version with a circular nave), St Mary le Strand, the complete schemes for King's College Cambridge and the Public Building (including the Senate House) at Cambridge University, numerous designs for medium-sized country houses, garden building and follies, obelisks and memorial columns, church memorials and monuments, as well as wrought-iron work, fireplaces, window and door surrounds, Cartouche (design) and urns. The first page of the introduction included: '...such a Work as this would be of use to such Gentleman as might be concerned in Building, especially in the remote parts of the Country, where little or no assistance for designs can be procured'. It was intended to be a pattern book for both architects and clients, and became, according to John Summerson, \\"probably the most widely-used architecture book of the century, not only throughout Britain, but in the American colonies and the West Indies\\". For example, Plate 58 was an inspiration for the river fa√ßade of Mount Airy, Richmond County, Virginia, and perhaps also for the floorplan of Drayton Hall in Charleston County, South Carolina.The Center for Palladian Studies in America, Inc., \\"Palladio and Patternbooks in Colonial America.\\" Other published works by Gibbs include The Rules for Drawing the Several Parts of Architecture (1732), which explained how to draw the Classical orders and related details and was used well into the 19th century, and Bibliotheca Radcliviana subtitled A Short Description of the Radcliffe Library Oxford (1747) to celebrate the Radcliffe Camera, including a list of all the craftsmen employed in the building's construction as well as twenty-one plates.Little, p.36 In 1752 he published a two-volume translation of the Latin book De Rebus Emanuelis by a 16th-century Portuguese Bishop Jerome Osorio da Fonseca; his English title was The History of the Portuguese during the Reign of Emanuel.

Originally built after the Norman conquest to control the strategically important route to the north of England, it played a role in the conflicts of the Anarchy, the First and Second Barons' Wars. Hugely expanded by Edward I, the castle then fell rapidly into disuse in the late medieval era, its stonework recycled for building purposes in the surrounding colleges. Cambridge Castle was refortified during the English Civil War but once again fell into disuse, used primarily as the county gaol. The castle gaol was finally demolished in 1842, with a new prison built in the castle bailey. This prison was demolished in 1932, replaced with the modern Shire Hall, and only the castle motte and limited earthworks still stand. The site is open to the public daily and offers views over the historic buildings of the city.  History = 11th century  Cambridge Castle was one of three castles built across the east of England in late 1068 by William the Conqueror in the aftermath of his northern campaign to capture York.Mackenzie, p.310, Pounds, p.7. Cambridge, or Grantabridge as it was then known, was on the old Roman route from London to York and was both strategically significant and at risk of rebellion.Pounds, p.57. The initial building work was conducted by Picot, the high sheriff, who later founded a priory beside the castle.Pounds, p.58. The castle was built in a motte and bailey design, within the existing town, and 27 houses had to be destroyed to make space for it.Pounds, p.208.  12th-13th centuries  Location of King's Ditch overlaid on a modern map The castle was held by the Norman kings until the civil war of the Anarchy broke out in 1139.Bradbury, p.144. Castles played a key role in the conflict between the Empress Matilda and King Stephen, and in 1143 Geoffrey de Mandeville, a supporter of the Empress, attacked Cambridge; the town was raided and the castle temporarily captured. Stephen responded with a counter- attack, forcing Geoffrey to retreat into the Fens and retaking the castle.Bradbury, p.145. Cambridge Castle remained exposed, however, and Stephen decided to build a supporting fortification at Burwell to provide additional protection.Bradbury, p.146. Geoffrey died attacking Burwell Castle the following year, leaving Cambridge Castle secure. Under Henry II the castle was adequately maintained, but little additional work was undertaken to improve it.Brown, p.171. A castle-guard system was established, under which lands around Cambridge were granted to local lords on the condition that they provide guard forces for the castle, and the castle was primarily used to hold the sheriff's court and records.Pounds, pp.46, 98; Brown, p.71. King John expanded the castle in the years before the First Barons' War of 1215 to 1217, but this work was concentrated on constructing a new hall and chamber, at the cost of ¬£200.Mackenzie, p.310; Brown, p.71. During the war, the rebel barons, supported by Prince Louis of France, captured much of eastern England; Cambridge Castle fell in 1216.Pounds, p.116. The castle was returned to royal control after the war, but Henry III only conducted basic maintenance of the fortification.Brown, p.71. Cambridge was attacked again during the Second Barons' War in 1266.Mackenzie, p.310. This time the town and castle held long enough to be relieved by Henry's forces, but the king reinforced the city defences with a large ditch, later known as King's Ditch. Cambridge Castle remained only a basic fortification until 1284 when Edward I decided to undertake major expansion works. Over the next 14 years the king spent at least ¬£2,630 on rebuilding the castle in stone. Edward's castle was four- sided, with circular towers at each corner, guarded by a gatehouse and a barbican.Brown, p.73. A circular stone keep was built on the motte. The result was a \\"major fortress in the latest fashion\\", albeit never quite completed. Edward stayed at the castle for two nights in 1294.  14th-17th centuries  Cambridge Castle, engraved in 1575 The 17th-century bastions of the castle, shown in an 1837 plan During the 14th century the castle was allowed to fall into disrepair. From Edward III onwards, little money was spent on maintaining the property and by the 15th century the castle was in ruins. The castle hall and chamber were roofless by the 15th century, and Henry VI ordered these buildings to be destroyed and the stone reused for constructing King's College in 1441, with other parts of the castle being used to help build Trinity College's chapel.Brown, p.73; Mackenzie, p.310. More stonework was given away by Mary I in the 16th century for building a mansion at nearby Sawston in the Fens, and other grants of stone given to Emmanuel and Magdalene colleges.Mackenzie p.310; Brown, p.73. By 1604 only the gatehouse, used as a gaol, and the keep remained intact, with the surrounding walls described by contemporaries as \\"rased and utterly ruinated\\". Civil war broke out in England in 1642 between the rival factions of the Royalists and Parliament. Cambridge Castle was occupied by Parliamentary forces in the first year of the war.Wedgwood, p.106. Oliver Cromwell ordered emergency work to be conducted to repair the defences, resulting in two new earthwork bastions being added to the castle and a brick barracks constructed in the old bailey.Mackenzie, p.311; Brown, p.73. The governor of Cambridge described in 1643 that \\"our town and castle are now very strongly fortified... with breastworks and bulwarks\\".Thompson, p.139. The castle saw no further fighting during the war, and in 1647 parliament ordered the remaining fortifications to be slighted, damaged beyond further use.  18th-19th centuries  An engraving of Cambridge Castle in 1730, including the motte (l) and the gatehouse gaol (r) 1841 painting of the castle gatehouse The castle rapidly deteriorated after the slighting and the remaining walls and bastions were taken down in 1785, leaving only the gatehouse and the earth motte. The gatehouse remained in use as the county gaol into the 19th century, being run, like other similar prisons, as a private business ‚Äî the keeper of the castle gaol was paid ¬£200 a year by the county in 1807Finn, p.135; 2009 equivalent prices using the Measuring Worth website, accessed 29 January 2011. (equivalent to ¬£ in ). This came to an end when a new county prison was built in the grounds of the castle's former bailey.Pounds, p.100; The Cambridge Guide, p.212. The new prison was built by G. Byfield between 1807 and 1811 with an innovative octagonal structure, influenced by the designs of the prison reformer John Howard; the castle gatehouse was destroyed to make way for a new county court building.Mackenzie, p.311; Cambridge Castle, Heritage Gateway, accessed 28 January 2011.  Preservation  The castle is a Scheduled Ancient Monument. Its only remains are the high motte (which stands on the highest point in the city) and some fragments of earthworks. It is open to the public daily with no admission fee, and offers views over the historic buildings of the city. The site of the castle bailey and the 19th-century prison is now occupied by Shire Hall, which was built in 1932 as the headquarters of Cambridgeshire County Council.

The origin of its name derives from the 234 metre mountain in the south of the settlement, a volcanic cone that first encountered during the exploration of the island, and which scattered basaltic lava in its surroundings. It was only in the 20th century that the parish developed initiatives to improve the quality of life in Pico da Pedra, which included the establishment of social centre, cooperative for habitation and consume, sports fields, a Casa do Povo, daycare and seniors centres, and informative services. Geography Pico da Pedra is a landlocked parish situated in the interior of the northern coast of the island of S√£o Miguel, approximately eight kilometres away from the town of Ponta Delgada and ten kilometres from municipal seat of Ribeira Grande. It is surrounded in the north and west by the parishes of Calhetas and Fenais da Luz, south by Faj√£ de Cima, S√£o Roque and Livramento and east by the parish of Rabo de Peixe. It contains the localities Cancela, Pico da Pedra, Pico do Ata√≠de, Pico do Boi, Tapada do Fernandes and Tronqueira. The population of the parish hovers around 3000 residents. The growth of pedestrianism on the islands of the Azores was the impetus for the creation of the ecological association Amigos dos A√ßores, whose headquarters is located in Pico da Pedra. Economy Over that last decades of the 20th century, the population of Pico da Pedra transformed from a typically rural population, dedicated to agriculture, into a population dedicated to essentially serviced-based activities, employed primarily in the city of Ponta Delgada.

He was owner of the Lambert Puppet Theatre in Monkstown, County Dublin. He was noted for co-starring as O'Brien in the RT√â television series Wanderly Wagon. Lambert's Puppet Theatre also produced the iconic children's television character Bosco. He died in 2010 at the age of 81. Early life Lambert was born and raised in County Sligo. His father was the county librarian and died at the age of 35. His mother took on his father's old job and Lambert was raised in a bookish home. He made his first puppet when he was 8 years old and was a proficient ventriloquist by the time he reached his early teens. Career Lambert was long a stalwart of the Irish vaudeville scene, particularly in Dublin, although he also toured the country frequently with his wife Mai. His most common acts were with Finnegan, a mischievous storyteller, and Judge, a pensive dog. With the rise of television in the 1960s, the Lambert puppet theatre became a fixture in Irish broadcasting. In the early 1960s, Lambert devised a puppet series for children entitled Murphy agus a Chairde (\\"Murphy and His Friends\\"). Murphy was a giant who lived in a magical kingdom. Its king, \\"An R√≠\\", only had one problem - constant mischief from two witches, Feemy and Bab√≥g. RT√â was the only station most people in Ireland could then access and Murphy's adventures were soon an important part of most children's viewing. Murphy himself appeared as the in-vision continuity announcer all through one of RT√â's Christmas Day broadcasts. In November 1963, Lambert drew international attention after he successfully acquired a driver's license for his puppet Finnegan. Lambert reported that he did so simply to show how easy it was for anybody in Ireland to obtain a license. He later co-starred in the children's television series Wanderly Wagon as the mischievous and greedy O'Brien, known for his childlike curiosity and cowardice in the face of magical events. Lambert and his family provided many regular (puppet) characters ‚Äî Judge the dog, Mr Crow (who lived in a cuckoo clock), the mysterious Foxy Loxy, and the untrustworthy Ssneaky Ssnake. The series also featured Irish actor Frank Kelly who played Dr Astro in the series, who later appeared as Fr. Jack Hackett in Father Ted. Another series created by Eugene Lambert was adapted from a children's book by Patricia Lynch, Br√≥geen Follows The Magic Tune. Br√≥geen was a leprechaun who teamed up with a fiddler who had heard a piece of music created by the fairies - and they wanted it back. The series was a great success and won several awards internationally. Some years later, when Lambert enquired about the 2\\" master video tapes, RT√â admitted to having re-used them. Brogeen (and most of Wanderly Wagon) was gone forever, although a dubbed version of Brogeen still exists in the archives of NRK. Lambert Puppet Theatre and Museum Lambert and his wife Mai visited The Harlequin Puppet Theatre in Colwyn Bay, Wales and an International Puppet Festival in Prague. Inspired, they decided to open a puppet theatre of their own, The Lambert Puppet Theatre. The Lambert Puppet Theatre was established in 1972. In the early years with Finnegan, Eugene toured UK and Ireland extensively and in later years he promoted Ireland for Irish Tourist Board, touring USA, Japan and Australia. Lambert's Puppet Theatre was responsible for producing the popular 1980s children's television character Bosco who was an ever-present fixture on the Irish national station, with Lambert's daughters, Miriam and then Paula voicing and operating Bosco. Personal life Lambert and his wife, Mai had ten children, two of whom predeceased him. In the 1950s, Lambert supplemented his day job as a refrigeration engineer with evenings appearing with his vent act Finnegan at Gala concerts and dinners. The Lambert family participated in Jury‚Äôs Irish Cabaret for seven years bringing topical puppet acts to the American audience. Lambert died at his home in Monkstown, County Dublin on Monday 22 February 2010, aged 82. His funeral on 26 February 2010 was attended by entertainers and politicians, with Liam √ì Maonla√≠ and Sin√©ad O'Connor singing at his Mass and a miniature Wanderly Wagon featuring in the ceremony.

Since May 2014, he has been Lord Lieutenant of Tweeddale. Before moving to St Andrews, Strachan was the Chichele Professor of the History of War at All Souls College, Oxford. Early life Strachan was born in Edinburgh, Scotland. He was educated at Rugby School, then in 1968 was a merchant seaman for three months, working his passage around the world on ships of Ben Line Steamers Ltd. He then spent three years at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, graduating BA in 1971 and proceeding to M.A. in 1975. In 1973, he joined a survey of antiquities in the Sudan. Career In 1975, Strachan was elected a research fellow of Corpus Christi College, and in 1977‚Äì1978 was a senior lecturer in war studies at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. In 1978, he returned to his Cambridge college as a tutor. His early research and published work focussed on the history of the British Army, and he was awarded the Templer Medal for From Waterloo to Balaclava and the Westminster Medal for The Politics of the British Army. Commissioned by the Oxford University Press to write a history of the First World War to replace C. R. M. F. Cruttwell's one- volume A History of the Great War, 1914-1918, Strachan completed the first of three volumes, The First World War: Volume 1: To Arms in 2001 to wide acclaim and is acknowledged as one of the world's authorities on the subject. Accompanying the print publication of his one volume survey The First World War (2004) was a multi-part documentary series for television entitled The First World War, with some episodes being titled after the chapters in the written work. This set was also released on DVD by Image Entertainment. He became admissions tutor and then senior tutor of Corpus Christi College, and in 1992 was elected a life fellow. He was Professor of Modern History at the University of Glasgow from 1992 to 2000, then migrated to Oxford as Chichele Professor of the History of War at All Souls. He was director of the Oxford Programme on the Changing Character of War from 2004 to 2015, and has published a series of important articles on strategy, as well as editing books which have arisen from the project.

In 2015, he left Oxford to serve as Professor of International Relations at the University of St Andrews. Views In January 2014, Strachan told The Daily Beast that President Barack Obama's failures in Afghanistan and Syria have shown that he is \\"chronically incapable\\" of military strategy. He said, \\"Bush may have had totally fanciful political objectives in terms of trying to fight a global War on Terror, which was inherently astrategic, but at least he had a clear sense of what he wanted to do in the world. Obama has no sense of what he wants to do in the world.\\" Awards and honours In 2005 Strachan was bestowed with an honorary Doctor of the University from the University of Paisley. He was knighted in the 2013 New Year Honours for services to the Ministry of Defence. In 2016, he won the Pritzker Literature Award for Lifetime Achievement in Military Writing.

The Mac version was ported over and developed and published by Destineer's MacSoft. The PC version was released on October 18, 2005 in North America and November 4, 2005 in Europe, while the Mac version was released on November 21, 2006 in North America and September 29, 2006 in Europe. An N-Gage version of the game developed by Glu Mobile was released on April 28, 2009. It is the third game of the Age of Empires series and the sequel to Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings. A remaster titled Age of Empires III: Definitive Edition was released on October 15, 2020. Its successor, Age of Empires IV is under development. The game portrays the European colonization of the Americas, between approximately 1492 and 1876 AD. There are fourteen civilizations to play within the game. Age of Empires III has made several innovations in the series, in particular with the addition of the \\"Home City\\", which combines real-time strategy and role-playing features. Two expansion packs have been released: the first, Age of Empires III: The WarChiefs, was released on October 17, 2006, and introduced three Native American civilizations; the second, Age of Empires III: The Asian Dynasties, was released on October 23, 2007, and included three Asian civilizations. On October 15, 2020, a remastered version of the game developed by Tantalus Media was released entitled Age of Empires III: Definitive Edition. Age of Empires III has sold over 2 million copies as of May 2008. As well as receiving favorable reviews, it has garnered awards, including GameSpy's \\"Best RTS game of 2005\\", and was one of the best-selling games of 2005. In 2007, Age of Empires III was the seventh best-selling computer game, with over 313,000 copies sold that year. Gameplay Players begin with a constructed town center or a wagon that will build into such, an armed explorer, and a modest number of villagers. Players explore the map and begin gathering resources used to build additional units and buildings and to research upgrades or technologies. Actions such as training units, constructing buildings, killing enemy units, etc., earn the player experience points. At certain experience point thresholds, players earn shipments that may be turned in for cards from the player's Home City, which can include units, upgrades, or resources. The game progresses similarly to most real-time strategy games until one side resigns. Imperial Age town, sitting safely behind several defensive walls (see miniature map, lower left corner). Includes a factory (center). In Age of Empires III, the player advances through technological \\"Ages\\", representing historical time periods; these provide access to greater improvements, units, and buildings. They include the Discovery Age, which represents the discovery and exploration of the Americas by Europeans and allows the player to explore and develop their economy; the Colonial Age, which represents the European Expansion into the \\"New World\\" and unlocks early military units; the Fortress Age, which represents the fortification of the European colonies, unlocks forts, and allows the player to have a more complete military; the Industrial Age, which triggers a strong economy, due in part to factories‚Äîadvanced buildings that automatically produce resources or artillery‚Äîand unlocks all units and shipments; and the Imperial Age, which unlocks all buildings and upgrades, and allows you to send unit and resource shipments a second time. All Ages cost food and coin to advance to, except the Colonial Age, which only costs food (800). The price of age advancement is incremental but does not vary between civilizations. Similar to the \\"minor gods\\" system in Age of Mythology, Age of Empires III uses a \\"Politician System\\" to grant bonuses on a successful advancement to another age. When the player chooses to advance to the next age, who is given the choice of two or more \\"Politicians\\" that provide them with a different bonus on choosing them. The Politician is given a generalized title from the period that usually reflects the bonus that it gives: for example, \\"The Naturalist\\" gives the player four cows, while \\"The General\\" gives twelve musketeers and one piece of heavy artillery. As the player's Home City increases in level, more Politicians are unlocked‚Äîat a rate of one for every ten Home City levels‚Äîup to level 60. Civilizations Age of Empires III allows the player to play as eight different civilizations: Spanish, British, French, Portuguese, Dutch, Russian, German, and Ottomans.Age of Empires III Manual, p. 21: \\"Choosing a civilization\\". Each of the eight civilizations has its own strengths and weaknesses and unique units available only to that civilization. Specific units for each civilization are designated Royal Guard units, receiving greater bonuses on the Guard upgrade in the Industrial Age, but at an increased price. The player can change the name of their Home City, the Explorer name, and is given a pre-named leader from part of the period (for example, Napoleon Bonaparte for the French Colonial Empire, Suleiman the Magnificent for Ottoman Empire, and Ivan the Terrible for the Russian Empire). Each civilization has unique shipments to aid its cultural, economy and military (for example, the Ottomans are able to order a shipment of gold for both them and their teammates). There are other civilizations playable via the campaign, which include The Knights of St. John, John Black's Mercenaries, and the United States of America, which are played as the Spanish, German and British civilizations, respectively, with slight modifications. Non-playable campaign civilizations include the Pirates, Circle of Ossus and Native Americans, although these civilizations are playable using the Scenario Editor. Twelve different tribes of Native Americans are in the game as well, but these are not in themselves playable factions. However, players can gain access to unique units and improvements by forming an alliance with the tribes by building a trading post at their camps. The native tribes featured are the Aztec, Carib, Cherokee, Comanche, Cree, Inca, Iroquois, Lakota, Maya, Nootka, Seminole, and Tupi. Three of these tribes were made playable in the expansion pack Age of Empires III: The WarChiefs: the Iroquois, Lakota (under the name Sioux) and Aztecs. These civilizations were removed as the smaller, alliance based tribes and were replaced by the Huron, Cheyenne, and Zapotec, respectively. In The Asian Dynasties another three civilizations were added, along with several new native tribes. The civilizations are the Indian, the Japanese, and the Chinese. Home Cities Age of Empires III is the first game in the series to introduce the \\"Home City\\" concept. The Home City functions as a second city, a powerhouse that is separated from the active game. It cannot be attacked or destroyed, although an Imperial Age upgrade called \\"Blockade\\" stops the player's opponents from receiving Home City shipments. Similar to a role-playing game character, the Home City is persistent between games, meaning that upgrades gained through separate games can be applied and stay applied for as long as that particular city exists. Multiple Home Cities can be created and maintained, although each supports only one civilization. The Home City is composed of five main buildings from which the player chooses their new shipment cards and customizations: The New World Trading Company, the Military Academy, the Cathedral, the Manufacturing Plant and the Harbor. Players can also access the Home City during a match by clicking on the \\"Home City\\" button represented on the HUD as the nation's flag. The Home City functions differently inside a game. Instead of customizing a Home City or choosing cards, a player can ship cards chosen before the game (and added to a deck). During the course of a game, players gain XP (experience) by completing actions such as constructing buildings, training units, killing enemies, and collecting treasures. Whenever a certain amount of experience points are gained, the player can make use of a shipment from their respective Home City. Shipments slow down as the game goes on since more XP is required with every consecutive shipment. This XP is also added directly to the home city and is collected over multiple games, allowing it to level up over time. Players can gear their cards into three different combinations: \\"Boom\\" (economic combinations), \\"Rush\\" (military combinations), or \\"Turtle\\" (defensive combinations). The first few cards chosen are automatically added to the player's portfolio, where it can be copied onto a deck for use in a game. Later in the game, cards have to be manually chosen because of the limit of cards in one deck. Most cards are available to all civilizations, but some are unique to one. If the Home City being played has more than one deck, the player must select which to use when the first shipment is sent. During a game, players keep this initial deck; this feature encourages players to build decks that are customized for the map being played on, or that counter other civilizations. The decks support twenty cards. As the Home City improves by level, you may gain an extra card slot for the decks for every 10 levels. Units The units of Age of Empires III are based, as in previous iterations of the game, around military classes of the historic time period. The player controls a variety of civilian and military units, and uses them to expand and develop their civilization, as well as wage war against opponents. The base unit of a game is the settler, responsible for gathering resources and constructing buildings, in order to improve the economy of the civilization. The number of units a player can control in a scenario is limited by a \\"population limit\\", a common real-time strategy game mechanic. Houses and town centers raise the starting limit, to a maximum of 200, while each unit that is produced increases the population count. Basic units such as settlers and infantry count as 1, but others, including most cavalry and mercenary infantry count as 2. More powerful units, especially artillery or mercenary cavalry, can count for a population as high as 7. Native warriors, explorers, tamed and grazing animals, hot air balloons and warships do not count towards the population limit, but generally have a build limit, allowing the player to deploy only a certain number of those specific units at a time. A small troop of cavalry, infantry, and cannon departing, headed out to battle. Military units are used for combat against other players. Infantry are the cheapest unit type and all are land-based, using weapons ranging from crossbows to early muskets to more advanced rifles. The heavier artillery classes also make use of ranged weapons, primarily cannon and mortars; however, there is also artillery armed with grenades. Mounted troops are also present, and are armed with either hand weapons, such as swords, or ranged weapons, such as pistols. These units also have significant features, such as skirmishers which do bonus damage against infantry, and ranged cavalry does bonus damage against other cavalry. A new unit introduced in Age of Empires III is the explorer, which is chiefly responsible for scouting and gathering treasure but is also capable of building Trading Posts and has a special attack, used at the player's command. This unit cannot be killed, but can be rendered unconscious, to be revived when friendly units are in range; also, a ransom can be paid to have it reappear at the player's town center. This ransom is credited to the player that disabled him, when applicable. Some shipment cards increase the explorer's effectiveness in gameplay; for example, providing it with \\"war dogs\\" can aid scouting and combat. In Age of Empires III, ships are available on most maps. Military ships makes use of cannon or flaming arrows, while some ships can collect resources or transport land units. Mercenaries may aid the player in their campaigns in the New World. Mercenaries are not trained like standard units; instead, they can be shipped from the Home City or hired from saloons for a lot of gold, so that only economically powerful players can employ them. Most are powerful, but hiring them does not provide experience points, so mercenaries cannot effectively replace the player's standard army, and can negatively affect a player's economy if used excessively. Incidentally, along with hero/explorer units, Mercenaries were vulnerable to assassin units such as spies, agents and ninjas. In most cases, a selection of Native American tribes populate game maps and support their own brand of military units that can be trained once an alliance has been formed. Some Native American military units use m√™l√©e weapons, a few use indigenous ranged weapons, such as bows and arrows or atl-atls, while still others adopt ranged European gunpowder weapons. These units usually pertain to the infantry or cavalry classes, but, on maps with water, canoes are also available to the player through the dock. Buildings Buildings play a big role in gameplay, as they are used for training civilian and military units, researching improvements, supporting population, providing structural defense, or as resource providers. The buildings portrayed in Age of Empires III resemble the architectural design of that era. All of the games in the series share several buildings, including the Town Center and Docks. The appearance and attributes of a building change as the player advances through the Ages, and some civilizations have their own unique buildings. The appearance of these buildings depends on civilization. Some buildings can only be built at certain times like the defensive towers. There are certain architectural styles present in the game; architectural styles determine the appearance of in-game buildings. Each civilization is automatically assigned its architectural style. These three architectural styles are the Western European, which consists of classical styled wooden buildings and is shared by the British, French and Dutch; the Eastern European, which consists of wooden and straw structures and is shared by the Germans and Russians, and the Mediterranean, which consists of buildings made of stucco cement and dry brick, which is shared by the Spanish, Portuguese and Ottomans. Plot The story-based campaign mode consists of related scenarios with preset objectives, such as destroying a given building. In Age of Empires III, the campaign follows the fictional Black family in a series of three \\"Acts\\", which divide the story arc into three generations. All three acts are narrated by Amelia Black (Tasia Valenza). Instead of playing as one of the standard civilizations, the player takes command of a special civilization that is linked to the character or period that each Act portrays. Most units of the player civilizations speak in English language, with the exception of unique units such as Spanish Rodeleros, Spanish Lancers, German Uhlans, and German War Wagons. Act I: Blood During Act I, the player assumes command of the Knights of St. John, which resembles the Spanish civilization. In the late 16th century, Morgan Black‚Äîa Scottish-born mid-level commander of the Knights of Saint John‚Äîis defending their last stronghold on Malta from the forces of Sahin \\"The Falcon\\" of the Ottoman Empire (in a telling of the Great Siege of Malta). When the Ottomans send in their great bombards, Morgan then lights a signal fire to call in supporting cavalry led by his superior, Alain Magnan, who drive the Turks back and capture a bombard. Morgan and Alain drive the Ottomans from Malta and detonate Ottoman weapon caches in the nearby caves. Inside, they discover that the Ottomans were actually interested in a hidden stone library telling the story of the Lake of the Moon; the Fountain of Youth, a fabled Native American relic whose water is rumored to grant eternal life; and a secret society called the Circle of Ossus, who seek the Fountain for their own gain. Alain orders Morgan to sail to the New World to search for the Lake, but Morgan is attacked by the pirate Elisabet \\"Lizzie\\" Ramsey and is forced to land in the Caribbean islands. After re-engaging and defeating Lizzie, Morgan's men find some navigation charts which guide them safely to New Spain. In Yucatan, Morgan's forces destroy an Ottoman base. However, Spanish conquistador Francisco Juan Delgado de Leon captures Sahin and some other Ottoman soldiers. Morgan then defends his new Aztec allies from the Spanish. Afterward, he realizes that Delgado was looking for the map to the Lake of the Moon disguised as the mosaic in the Aztecs' town square, which shows the Lake of the Moon being in Florida. Morgan sets sail for Florida, but his fleet is damaged by a hurricane, forcing him to dock in Havana, Cuba. There, he earns Lizzie's respect and promises her the gold from the Spanish treasure fleet if she takes him to Florida. In Florida, Alain orders Morgan and Lizzie to capture the Spanish treasure ships while he claims the Lake. Together, Morgan and Lizzie capture the fleet, killing Delgado in the process, and capture Sahin. Sahin tells Morgan that the Circle believes the Lake is home to the Fountain of Youth and that he only wanted to keep the Circle from claiming it. Alain returns from the Lake and orders Morgan to execute his native allies and Sahin as heathens, but Sahin and Lizzie convince Morgan that Alain is actually the leader of the Circle of Ossus. At the Lake of the Moon, the group captures an enormous stationary cannon called a \\"Fixed Gun\\" from one of the Circle's bases. Using the Fixed Gun, Lizzie's fleet of fire ships and Morgan's ground forces hold off the Circle's elite Boneguard soldiers, then destroy the Fountain. Alain personally leads a Boneguard force in a counterattack but is killed during the fighting. After the battle, Sahin returns to Turkey, and Lizzie, with her Spanish gold sunk to the bottom of the Lake, leaves for the Caribbean, although it is hinted that she and Morgan will eventually reunite. Morgan silently wonders whether the fountain really was the Fountain of Youth, then refills his empty canteen with water from the lake. Act II: Ice During Act II, the player plays as John Black's Mercenaries, which is modeled after the German civilization with some elements of the French civilization. In the mid-eighteenth century, Morgan's grandson, John Black, and his Mohawk friend Kanyenke are on their way through the Carolinas to Brunswick with their band of mercenaries after the colony's governor and John's uncle, Stuart Black, summons them. After defending the colony against Cherokee raiders, John and Kanyenke attack the Cherokee war camps, forcing the Cherokee to arrange a truce. While John, Kanyenke, and most of the colony's garrison are away at the following negotiations, British General Warwick leads an army to attack them and capture Brunswick. Warwick abducts Stuart and begins questioning him about the location of the Lake of the Moon. John and Kanyenke return and drive Warwick's forces from Brunswick, but Warwick and Stuart are gone. John concludes that the Circle of Ossus has returned. Kanyenke believes that his sister, Nonahkee, could be in danger, and the pair leaves for New England. They find Warwick attacking Nonahkee's village, hoping to extract John's location from her. After the ensuing battle, John reveals to Kanyenke that he and Nonahkee are in love. John and Kanyenke take their mercenaries to fight Warwick's fleeing army and ally with the French in the Seven Years' War against Warwick. When Colonel George Washington tells them that Warwick is a renegade and has been hunted by the British as well, John agrees to track him down for the British. John's mercenaries and Washington's forces destroy Warwick's base in the Great Lakes region, where John finds Stuart's decapitated body. John then continues to pursue Warwick, who has again escaped and fled to the Rocky Mountains. John and Kanyenke intercept Warwick's supply train and destroy a fortified Circle base in the mountains. They soon discover that Warwick and his soldiers have fled even farther west to Colorado, where they have allied with the Russians. They discover that the Circle plans to capture British and French colonies and towns while their soldiers are fighting one another, and that Warwick wants the Circle of Ossus to take over North America. While John pursues Warwick, Kanyenke and some miners bring down large rock bridges to stop the Russians' large cannons from advancing. He and the mercenaries return east as John plants explosives to cause an avalanche. Warwick ambushes John, but he successfully detonates the explosives, killing himself and Warwick. The resulting avalanche buries the Russians and the Circle's troops, ending their current plans. In the spring, Kanyenke returns to his village and learns that his sister has given birth to John's son Nathaniel, whom he begins to help raise. Act III: Steel During Act III, the player plays as the U.S. civilization (only available in the campaign), which resembles the British civilization. In 1817 (five years after Nathaniel's death in 1812), the narrative shifts to Amelia Black, the granddaughter of John Black and Nathaniel's daughter, and heiress owner of The Falcon Company, a railroad company. Her sights are set on expanding new railroad operations in the United States after the compensation given by the British and Americans for John Black's sacrifice was exhausted by Nathaniel. After defeating a rival railroad company and laying track to supply the US Cavalry near the Mexican border, Amelia meets French prospector Pierre Beaumont, who helps her and US Cavalry commander Major Ryan Cooper defeat a Mexican army attacking a fort. Beaumont leads Amelia to a mine in Colorado, where she meets an aged Kanyenke, who has brought Cooper and the cavalry with him. Kanyenke reveals Beaumont as the leader of Circle of Ossus. Amelia, Kanyenke, and Cooper chase Beaumont through the mines, where they find a map to the Lake of the Moon. The three travel to Florida, where they find that the Lake is now a swamp, and destroy a Circle base, after which one of Beaumont's wolves kills Cooper. Amelia, now wanting to avenge Cooper, learns from the local Seminoles that there is an Inca city in Pacamayo Valley where several barrels of the Fountain's water have been stored. Amelia and Kanyenke sail to South America, where they help Sim√≥n Bol√≠var defeat the Spanish. Bol√≠var offers them guides, and, with the Circle's army close behind them, they make a dangerous passage through the Andes. After the passage, they discover the Inca city in Pacamayo Valley and defend it from the Circle. Amelia soon finds that Beaumont has once again escaped, this time with the barrels of the Fountain's water. Amelia and Kanyenke next fight the Circle at their last stronghold in Cuba. With help from the Spanish colony of Havana, they destroy the Ossuary. Near the battle's end, Beaumont ambushes Amelia and Kanyenke while they are passing under an archway, but is shot and killed by Amelia. Amelia uses the Circle's stored treasure to revive the Falcon Company and builds railroads to the future west coast of the United States. Back in the US, an elderly man congratulates Amelia and states that she broke the Circle in one lifetime, hinting that he is Morgan Black and that he greatly extended his life using water from the Fountain of Youth. Development=Technical features Havok graphical production in Age of Empires III. Building collapses are not pre-recorded animations. A troop of 6 cannon units and 44 rodeleros attacking a fort. The building initially collapses in two different ways in two different games. (1) First image: two explosions, smokestack on right side breaks. (2) Second image: one explosion, rooftop on left side breaks. Age of Empires III builds on and introduces new features to the Age of Mythology engine, called Bang! Engine. One new feature is the inclusion of the Havok physics simulation middleware engine on the Windows version and the similar PhysX engine on Mac OS X. This means that many events such as building destruction and tree falls will not be pre-created animations, but will be calculated according to the physics engine, in an innovation for the series. Other graphical features of the game include bloom lighting and support for pixel shader 3.0. Audio The Age of Empires III original soundtrack features an original musical score composed by Ensemble Studios musicians Stephen Rippy and Kevin McMullan, whose previous work includes other games in the Age of Empires series as well as Age of Mythology. It was released on November 11, 2005 by Sumthing Else Music Works. Stephen Rippy, music and sound director at Ensemble Studios, said, \\"Age of Empires III is a game with an epic topic ‚Äî it covers the colonization of the Americas over a period of some three hundred years, so it needed to have an epic-sounding score to match. Using a full orchestra and choir as well as some more period- inspired instrumentation, the music follows the story of Morgan Black and his descendants as they battle the Circle of Ossus for a foothold in the New World.\\" The soundtrack also features a bonus DVD that includes fourteen tracks remixed in 5.1 surround, a behind-the-scenes video of the studio session, the Age of Empires III cinematic trailer and five exclusive bonus tracks. Unlike previous versions of Age of Empires, the AI nations in single player skirmish mode will send voice messages to the player at various points in the game, taunting the player if they are selected as enemies or sharing military plans with the player if they are allies. All the AI characters have different personalities and many different quotes exist in the game. The feature can be easily removed if required. Release history Following the announcement of the game on January 4, 2005, a trial version was released on September 7, 2005. This contained a cut-down version of the game, introducing new features, such as two campaign scenarios, two random map scenarios (New England and Texas) and access to two civilizations (British and Spanish), and a variety of modifications. An updated demo version was made available with the game's release on September 22, 2005. As part of Age of Empires III launch, Ensemble Studios announced the release of Age of Empires III Fan Site Kit on September 9, 2005. The release of the game on September 22, 2005, saw two separate editions being made available. The standard edition included the game and manual, a collector's edition version in a presentation box that includes the official soundtrack, extra documentation, a hardback book titled Art of Empires that contains concept art and 3D renders from the game and a DVD entitled The Making of Age of Empires III. The release of the game has been followed by a series of patches that have fixed minor bugs in the software or added new features. Ensemble Studios released an expansion for the game named Age of Empires III: The WarChiefs on October 17, 2006. It contains three new native civilizations that can be completely controlled: The Iroquois Confederation, the Great Sioux Nation, and the Aztecs. New content for existing European civilizations, maps and gameplay additions (such as the \\"revolution\\" feature, in which players can \\"revolt\\" from their mother country and start an active military coup in the game) was added. A second expansion pack, Age of Empires III: The Asian Dynasties, was announced on May 18, 2007 and features three Asian civilizations: the Indians, Chinese, and Japanese. It was released on October 23, 2007. A Mac OS X port of the game was released on November 13, 2006 by MacSoft, followed by the first expansion on June 18, 2007. In 2009, when Ensemble Studios was closed and no support was to expect by the successor company Robot Entertainment, the game community tried to provide game support and fixes of remaining issues themselves, for instance with fan patches. Both the original game and the first expansion were made available in a single collection titled Gold Edition on October 23, 2007. On November 21, 2010, Microsoft sold the game including its two expansion packs as a part of the relaunch of its Games for Windows Live platform for 10 cents or 10 Microsoft points. The overwhelming and unanticipated demand created a shortage of account keys leaving some of those who had purchased the game through the promotion unable to install the game. Microsoft remedied this issue by assuring all customers who purchased the game that account keys would be generated within one week and automatically uploaded to each profile. As a result of this promotion the overall sales of the game have sharply increased. Definitive Edition On August 21, 2017, Microsoft announced a remaster titled Age of Empires III: Definitive Edition at Gamescom 2017. On May 30, 2019, Microsoft announced that they will be bringing all Age of Empires Definitive Editions to Steam, stating that more information will be released soon. The Definitive Edition of Age of Empires III is being developed by Tantalus Media, overseen by Xbox Game Studios' internal World's Edge studio. On January 23, 2020, Microsoft announced that the closed beta would begin in early February. Each beta session will include a small piece of the game. Larger closed beta sessions will be dedicated to multiplayer and matchmaking. Campaign beta sessions will be limited to a very small group of players and only certain missions. The first closed beta session began on February 11, 2020 and ended on February 19, 2020.. The second closed multiplayer session began on March 31 and ran through April 7. . The full game was released on October 15, 2020. Age of Empires III: Definitive Edition included updated 4K graphics and the two previous expansions Age of Empires III: The WarChiefs and Age of Empires III: The Asian Dynasties. This remaster also featured new content in the form of two new playable civilizations, the Swedish Empire and the Inca, as well a new set of \\"Historical Battles\\" and \\"The Art of War\\" challenge missions similar to those implemented in Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition. Reception Age of Empires III was well received by critics and reviewers. The game received an average score of 82% according to GameRankings. Age of Empires III was listed as the eighth best-selling PC game of 2005, and over two million copies of it had been sold by May 2007. GameSpot pointed out that \\"Age of Empires III has some very big shoes to fill\\", and GameSpy remarked that it \\"may not redefine real-time strategy gaming, but it sets the bar so high that we will be comparing games to this for years\\". IGN also commented on the game, saying \\"Age of Empires III is a superbly balanced and polished game\\", and: \\"Discounting a few niggles in the interface, the whole presentation is rock solid.\\" Game Revolution said that it is \\"as detailed as a history book, and about as much fun\\", while GameZone stated it is \\"one purchase you will not come to regret\\". Age of Empires III was the eighth best-selling PC game of 2005 despite its late release, and sold over 2 million copies by May 2007. It received a \\"Gold\\" sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 200,000 copies in the United Kingdom. Graphics The game's visuals were highly praised by reviewers. In a preview, IGN said that \\"After seeing the screenshots, our jaws hit the floor at the amount of detail\\", while in their review, 1UP.com described it as \\"one of the most beautiful games you will put on your computer for the foreseeable future;\\" GameSpy agreed, stating, \\"Age IIIs graphics are unmatched in the strategy genre.\\" GameSpot also admired the graphics, but had a negative comment as well; they said, \\"Were it not for the awkward unit behavior...Age of Empires III would look truly amazing.\\" GameSpy awarded Age of Empires III the \\"Best Graphics\\" award at GameSpy's \\"Game of the Year 2005\\", mentioning that the graphics engine boasted \\"all the high-end technology you would normally find in first-person shooters\\". Sound effects GameZone praised the game's sound effects, saying that \\"you will feel the explosions of the cannon balls, the muskets firing their endless volleys, and the destruction of a building. It all sounds extremely realistic, and makes the game come that much more alive.\\" Eurogamer said \\"AoE3 ... sounds fantastic\\", while Game Revolution mentioned, \\"The ambient sounds, music and voice work all suit the colonial theme.\\" Single-player campaign Reviewers were divided about the single- player campaign. GameSpot thought it was \\"standard for a real-time strategy game\\", but also complained that it had \\"less-than-stellar voice work and awkward cutscenes\\"; GameSpy agreed that \\"Age of Empires IIIs campaign is not revolutionary\\", but thought that \\"the voice acting is great\\". IGN praised the campaign's story, in that it gave the player a \\"nice sense of purpose\\"; they thought \\"The 24-mission campaign is very well designed.\\" Eurogamer said the campaign lacked originality, stating, though \\"well-written and imaginatively framed\\", the campaign \\"offers exactly the same kind of challenges that RTS campaigns have been offering for years;\\" Game Revolution disliked the campaign more than the other reviewers. Comparing it to Age of Empires IIs campaign, they said: \\"The plot actually got worse. Age of Empires III...avoids all the interesting and prickly issues like genocide, epidemics and slavery, instead subbing in a wimpy tale of a family destined to protect the Holy Grail from a Satanic Cult.\\" Multiplayer Age of Empires IIIs multiplayer was the first in the series to be integrated into the game interface and was highly lauded, as was the Home City concept. The topic of multiplayer was touched by GameZone, who said \\"this game demands multiplayer mode, and Ensemble Studios provided this for the players\\", while at 1UP, the reviewer commented similarly, stating, \\"Multiplayer support has been significantly upgraded with a slick interface, support for clans and a number of other useful features.\\" GameSpy commented on the Home City as well, saying, \\"the 'home city' system creates long-term depth and strategy\\". EuroGamer, however, stated: \\"Stop with the gifts! ... You do not need to let me flick to a home city screen every few minutes so that I can select a free unit or resource windfall. I'm not some spoilt toddler that needs to be bribed with endless sweeties.\\" Age of Empires III uses the ESO server for multiplayer. Awards Age of Empires III won PC Gamer USs \\"Best Real-Time Strategy Game 2005\\" award. The magazine's Brett Todd wrote, \\"It was astounding how Ensemble managed to stick to the historical RTS formula yet keep the gameplay feeling fresh.\\" The game was presented with two awards by GameSpy in 2005: \\"Real-time strategy game of the year\\" and \\"Best Graphics\\". GameSpy highly praised the game overall, giving it 5 stars in its review, which particularly noted the graphics and multiplayer experience. The game was named fifth-best game of 2005 by GameSpy. Other awards, including an \\"Outstanding\\" from GameZone, reflect the positive critical reception of the game. The game was given an 'honorable mention' in the 'Best Music' category. Yahoo!'s report differed, but still had many positive features. Like GameSpy, Yahoo! also praised the effort put into the graphics and physics, but maintained that these are essentially eye-candy. Both Yahoo! and Eurogamer were disappointed by the traditional economics-based strategy of the game and believed that this, with the lack of useful formation and tactics, meant that the game does not stand up to other modern real-time strategy games. Eurogamer shared these final thoughts and described the new Home City shipments, along with all the treasures scattered around the map, as silly and childish ways of trying to complement the game's lack of strategy and tactical choices. However, Eurogamer recognized that Ensemble Studios was brave to implement \\"something quite different\\" from other real time strategy games ‚Äî the Home City concept.

The Force area also covered some of the North Sea, giving Grampian Police the responsibility of policing the oil and gas platforms of the North East. The force was headquartered on Queen Street in Aberdeen. The Police Authority had six representatives from Aberdeen City, six from Aberdeenshire, and four from Moray. Grampian Police was formed on 16 May 1975, when Grampian Region was created, a merger of the previously formed Scottish North Eastern Counties Constabulary and the Aberdeen City Police. The North Eastern force had been formed on 16 May 1949, by the merger of Aberdeenshire Constabulary, Banffshire Constabulary, Kincardineshire Constabulary, and Moray and Nairn Constabulary. The force produced a quarterly magazine called The Informer for its staff, and, in 2009, launched a YouTube channel. An Act of the Scottish Parliament, the Police and Fire Reform (Scotland) Act 2012, created a single Police Service of Scotland - known as Police Scotland - with effect from 1 April 2013.STV News , 30 October 2012 This merged the eight regional police forces in Scotland (including Grampian Police), together with the Scottish Crime and Drug Enforcement Agency, into a single service covering the whole of Scotland. Police Scotland has its headquarters at the Scottish Police College at Tulliallan in Fife. Areas covered Grampian Police covered the local authority areas of Aberdeen, Aberdeenshire and Moray. In addition to this, Grampian have a lead role in incidents on offshore installations in Scottish areas of the North Sea, irrespective of which police area the installation is situated. This arrangement exists due to Grampian's extensive experience in dealing with the offshore industry. The railway stations and lines in the area are the responsibility of the British Transport Police, and a number of Ministry of Defence installations in the region are policed by the Ministry of Defence Police. However, as with all territorial police forces, the chief officer of Grampian Police is ultimately responsible in statute for all law and order in Grampian police area, irrespective as to whether a special police force is present. Departments and units Grampian Police Headquarters at Queen Street in Aberdeen Grampian Police had a number of specialist departments and units, with officers joining them and undertaking this as their primary role. Amongst others, these included: * Grampian Police Mountain Rescue Team * Dog Section * Underwater Search Unit (Grampian's Underwater Search Unit is the regional USU for Grampian, Northern Constabulary, and Tayside Police. However, it is staffed entirely by Grampian.) * Armed Response Vehicles * Oil and Energy Liaison Unit * Criminal Investigation Department * Wildlife Crime Unit * Roads Policing Department (formerly the Traffic Department) * Special Branch * Financial Investigation Unit * Family Protection Unit * Education Liaison * Professional Standards and Conduct Department * Human Resources (Recruitment & Training) * General Enquiries Department * Major Investigation Teams Pipe band The Grampian Police Pipe Band, established in 1907, often played at events and competitions throughout Scotland. The group rehearses on a weekly basis in Aberdeen and comprises both police staff and civilians. The band launched its own design of tartan in 2007 and performed for Queen Elizabeth at Balmoral Castle to celebrate its unveiling. Grampian Racist Incident Partnership Grampian Racist Incident Partnership (GRIP) is a coalition of race equality groups led by Grampian Police officers. It was formed in May 2008 in response to a series of highly publicised racist assaults against Pakistani migrants and English travellers in Aberdeen. In 2008 Grampian Police took part in the first GRIP campaign, designed to increase awareness in the bars and pubs of Aberdeen with an eye towards to protecting patrons from racist assaults. In 2010 it launched a campaign in conjunction with GRIP called 'RACISM ‚Äì Report it Now!' The campaign involved putting up posters and stickers in shops, bars, restaurants, and post offices throughout the region urging people to report racist incidents. GRIP had mixed results in its first two years. While the number of racist assaults against Pakistanis has been declining, there was a dramatic spike in 2009 in the number of assaults against people classified as \\"Other White\\" and \\"White British\\". Lewis Macdonald, the Labour member for Aberdeen Central, said the spike shows that \\"police are getting much better at recording a racial incident.\\" Robert Brown, the Liberal Democrat member for Glasgow, said the spike was \\"truly shocking.\\" Significant events and incidents Grampian Police were involved in many high-profile cases throughout Scotland, either as the investigating force, reviewing investigations on behalf of other forces, or providing specialist support. * Piper Alpha disaster (investigating force) * Arlene Fraser murder case (investigating force) * George Murdoch murder (investigating force) * Michael Holding murder (investigating force) * Scott Simpson murder (investigating force) * Renee MacRae mystery (reviewing force) * Jolanta Bledaite murder (specialist support ‚Äì underwater search) * April 2009 North Sea helicopter crash (investigating police force, in partnership with Air Accident Investigation Branch and other agencies) Chief Constables *Alexander Morrison (1975‚Äì1983) *Alistair G.

He is best known for his work on public choice theory, the application of economic thinking to political issues. He was one of the founding figures in his field. Early life and education A native of Rockford, Illinois and graduate of Rockford Central High School, Tullock attended the University of Chicago and, after a break for military service during World War II, received a J.D. in 1947. Following a brief period in private practice, he joined the Foreign Service that fall. After completing training, he was posted to Tianjin, China, later receiving Chinese language instruction at Yale and Cornell and follow-on postings to Hong Kong and Korea. He resigned from the Foreign Service in 1956.Tullock, Gordon, Curriculum Vitae , October 2000. Retrieved on 2010-07-25. While he originally intended to pursue a career as a foreign trader in the Far East, his work on The Politics of Bureaucracy eventually led him to begin collaboration with James M. Buchanan at the University of Virginia while Tullock worked at the University of South Carolina teaching international studies. Academic career Tullock's collaboration with Buchanan produced The Calculus of Consent: Logical Foundations of Constitutional Democracy (1962), which quickly became a seminal work in the new field of public choice. He later joined Buchanan as a faculty colleague at Virginia. For four years Buchanan and Tullock continued their research program, even founding a new journal for their field (1966), first called Papers in Non-Market Economics and eventually titled Public Choice, where they invited articles applying economic theory to all sorts of non- market phenomena, especially in the realm of government and politics. Despite the success of the book and the journal, disagreements with the UVA administration eventually led Tullock to leave. In 1967, Tullock identified many of the concepts of what came to be known as rent-seeking in a seminal paper. Tullock moved to Virginia Polytechnical Institute (VPI, now called Virginia Tech) in 1968 and was joined by Buchanan a year later. There they continued the Public Choice Society and the journal, of which Tullock remained editor until 1990. At VPI, Tullock wrote a number of influential articles and books, including Private Wants, Public Means (1970), The Logic of the Law (1971), The Social Dilemma (1974), and The Vote Motive (1976). In 1983, Tullock and the Center for Study of Public Choice moved to George Mason University, at the time a relatively unknown school in Fairfax, Virginia. Tullock taught at GMU from 1983‚Äì1987 and at the University of Arizona from 1987‚Äì1999. He continued to publish widely (more than 150 papers and 23 books in all), including \\"The Economics of Wealth and Poverty\\" (1986), Autocracy (1987), Rent Seeking (1993), The Economics of Non-Human Societies (1994) and On Voting: A Public Choice Approach (1998). In 1999 he returned to George Mason as a professor of law and economics, where he retired in 2008. Rent seeking Tullock developed a theory referred to as rent-seeking. Rent seeking, according to public choice theory, is securing profits through the political process rather than the market process of exchange. An example of rent seeking is when a firm, union, or special-interest group lobbies political actors (e.g. politicians or bureaucrats) to influence legislation in a beneficial manner. This can lead to moral hazard when politicians make policy decisions based on the lobby instead of the efficiency of the policy. Tullock also formulated and considered the Tullock paradox, namely, the paradox of why rent-seeking is so cheap. Tullock's spike The name \\"Tullock's spike\\" refers to a thought experiment in which Tullock suggested that if governments were serious about reducing road casualties, they should mandate that a sharp spike be installed in the center of each car's steering wheel, to increase the probability that an accident would be fatal to the driver. Tullock's idea was that the normal process of risk compensation would then lead to safer driving by the affected drivers, thereby actually reducing driving fatalities. Awards and recognition In 1994 Tullock was awarded an honorary Ph.D. from the University of Chicago and in 1998 became a distinguished fellow of the American Economic Association. He served as President of the Southern Economic Association, the International Atlantic Economic Society (1998‚Äì1999), the Western Economic Association and the Public Choice Society. In 1996 he was elected to the American Political Science Review Hall of Fame. He was sometimes considered a longshot candidate for the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences. Criticism His book, The Politics of Bureaucracy, has been criticized for overlooking a substantial body of literature. A number of authors have criticized Tullock and the public choice tradition as being too simplistic in its explanation of political behavior. Death On November 3, 2014, Tullock died at the age of 92 in Des Moines.Gordon Tullock ReferencesFurther reading * External links * Faculty Biography from George Mason University * Tullock's bio at the Mercatus Center * * Profile of Tullock in National Review * * Category:1922 births Category:2014 deaths Category:People from Rockford, Illinois Category:Economists from Illinois Category:University of Chicago alumni Category:George Mason University School of Law faculty Category:Public choice theory Category:Distinguished Fellows of the American Economic Association ","title":"Gordon Tullock"},{"id":"1495634","text":"Dean Guitars, commonly referred to simply as Dean, is an American importer and maker of stringed instruments and musical products with its headquarters in Tampa, Florida. Its products include solid-body electric guitars, bass guitars, and acoustic guitars. The company also distributes resonators, basses, banjos, mandolins, ukuleles, amplifiers, guitar cases, accessories, and custom guitar pickups.

However, the building was constructed for and is on long-term lease from the University of Aberdeen, which still uses parts of the building to house a museum. Today, it provides corporate office space and public access to council services, adjacent to the Town House, the city's historic seat of local government. Many Aberdonians consider Marischal College to be an icon of the \\"Granite City\\" and to symbolise the zenith of Aberdeen's granite-working industry. The construction of the modern college building began in 1835, following the demolition of previous buildings on the site, and was completed in its present form in the early 1900s. It is the second largest granite building in the world.How we built Britain by David Dimbleby Formerly the seat of the Marischal College and University of Aberdeen founded in 1593, the building was retained by the unified University of Aberdeen which was created in 1860 by the merger of Marischal College and King's College. The buildings of Marischal College continued to be used for academic purposes until the mid-20th century and less and less until the early 2000s. During this period they were frequently rebuilt and expanded upon. In the mid-to-late 20th century, teaching and academic activities at the university began to move to King's College or Foresterhill (for students of medicine) and by the early 21st century a new purpose for Marischal College was required. After a number of unsuccessful proposals, the majority of the building was leased to Aberdeen City Council to be restored and refurbished as office accommodation. The extensive renovation was completed on schedule and significantly under budget and the building opened to the public in June 2011. The university has retained the Mitchell Hall and a number of other significant parts of the building for its own use, in addition to the Marischal Museum. History Statue of king Robert the Bruce in front of Marischal College. Marischal College from the rear, showing Mitchell Tower and Mitchell Hall Bust of James Clerk Maxwell by Charles d‚ÄôOrville Pilkington Jackson. Located in the Mitchell Hall of Marischal College Marischal College and University of Aberdeen was the formal name of the former university which occupied the present Marischal College site. The College was founded in 1593 by George Keith, 5th Earl Marischal of Scotland. The original charter of the university was lost by the early 18th century, but two near-contemporary copies exist ‚Äì one of which was accepted by the courts in 1756 as being authentic.Skene v. Duff In this charter, Marischal College is described variously as a gymnasium, collegium (college), academia (academy) and universitas (university). Marischal was the second of Scotland's post-mediaeval 'civic universities', following the University of Edinburgh, created without Papal bull and with a more modern structure and a greater resemblance to the Protestant arts colleges of continental Europe. As such, both Edinburgh and Marischal came to be known as the 'Town Colleges' of their respective cities. The university was founded with the expressed aim of training clergy for the post-Reformation Kirk. It is believed that Keith desired a protestant institution alongside the pre- Reformation King's College, although King's had been Protestant since 1569. It is possible that the founding of another college in nearby Fraserburgh in 1592 was the true cause; its founder Sir Alexander Fraser was a business rival of Marischal. The College was constructed on the site of a medieval Franciscan Friary, disused after the Reformation. This building was later replaced by a William Adam designed building in the mid-18th century, however this, together with the Friary remains, were demolished entirely for the construction of the present building between 1835 and 1906. The college's Greek motto translates as \\"virtue is self-sufficient\\". James Clerk Maxwell FRS, FRSE (1831-1879), described as \\"the most famous and influential professor Aberdeen has ever had\\" was appointed as Professor of Natural Philosophy in 1856 and continued in that post until the merger of Marischal College with Kings College. The Mitchell Hall, where University of Aberdeen graduations previously took place, was built in the early 20th century. It is named for Dr Charles Mitchell, an alumnus of the university and a Tyneside shipbuilder. A large stained-glass window dominates the hall, executed by TR Spence of London and representing the university's history. The building was commended by poet John Betjeman following a visit to Aberdeen in 1947:Detail of ornately carved granite pinnacles on the facade of Marischal College, following restoration :\\"No-one can dismiss Marischal College, Aberdeen, when looking at the work of the present century. Wedged behind a huge town hall in an expensive and attractive mid-Victorian baronial style, I saw a cluster of silver-white pinnacles. I turned down a lane towards them, the front broadened out. Oh! Bigger than any cathedral, tower on tower, forests of pinnacles, a group of palatial buildings rivalled only by the Houses of Parliament at Westminster. :\\"This was the famous Marischal College. Imagine the Victorian tower with a spire on top, and all that well-grouped architecture below of lesser towers, and lines of pinnacles executed in the hardest white Kemnay granite and looking out over the grey-green North Sea and you have some idea of the first impression this gigantic building creates. :\\"It rises on top of a simple Gothic one designed by Simpson in 1840. But all these spires and towers and pinnacles are the work of this century and were designed by Sir Alexander Marshall Mackenzie. You have to see them to believe them.\\" There is an urban legend that Marischal College was Adolf Hitler's favourite building in the United Kingdom and that he would have liked to use it as a residence if the outcome of the Second World War had been different. This was a fabrication by students at the University of Aberdeen and David Webster, a noted Aberdeen historian. University of Aberdeen Marischal College with the new front under construction; circa 1900 The University of Aberdeen was created after the merger of Marischal College and King's College, Aberdeen in 1860 under the terms of the Universities (Scotland) Act 1858. The following extract refers to this merger:Haythornthwaite, J.A.: Scotland in the 19th Century; hosted by Strathclyde University, pub. 1993. Gdl.cdlr.strath.ac.uk. :\\"Universities of Kings College and Marischal College, Aberdeen. First Report of the Commissioners, 1838. 1837‚Äì38. Vol. XXXIII, 75p. [123] Chairman: Lord John Cunninghame. :The commissioners were in favour of a merger of the two colleges despite opposition from Kings College. They considered the unification as essential for the educational system of Northern Scotland although they disagreed with the proposed method of merger laid down by the last commission. The buildings of Marischal College were in very bad repair but new ones were under construction. Additions had been made in 1827 to Kings College buildings which were in a tolerable state of repair.\\" Throughout the 20th century, Marischall college housed all sciences and medicine. Since about 1960, the college housed the Department of Molecular and Cell Biology and Medical school. The building standing today, which replaced a number of older structures, was constructed between 1837 and 1844 by Aberdeen architect Archibald Simpson. This 1837 building formed a U-shaped quadrangle, with a small entrance via an archway amidst unrelated housing on the west side. The building was substantially extended between 1893 and 1905 by Alexander Marshall Mackenzie, and with its new \\"granite cage\\" front, enclosing the quadrangle, it became the second-largest granite building in the world (exceeded only by the Escorial Palace near Madrid). Renovation as Aberdeen City Council Headquarters For many years, much of the building was derelict as university departments had moved to King's College or Foresterhill years or decades before. Up to 2009, the only parts of the college building chiefly used by the university were the Mitchell Hall (for graduations, concerts and other events), the Marischal Museum, and the Anatomy department, which was used for 1st year medical students until March 2009. It was also home to the University's debating chamber. In 2006 plans were announced for the renovation of the college as new administrative headquarters for the Council to replace the ageing St. Nicholas House across the street. The University leased the Marischal College site to Aberdeen City Council for 175 years in exchange for ¬£4.7 million. Work began in 2009 and the newly refurbished Marischal College was opened in summer 2011. The derelict internal spaces were completely demolished and replaced with a new internal structure which matched exactly to the existing walls and windows. The renovations restored the granite exterior, ornamentation and detailing to their original glory, and provided new public space for citizens accessing council services and state-of-the-art offices for council workers. The Council Chamber and democratic processes continue to be located at the Town House next door. The university retained the north wing comprising the Mitchell Hall, debating chamber and associated rooms, although as of May 2012 these are not yet open for use. In Spring 2011, the city erected outside Marischal College a statue of King Robert the Bruce on horseback, holding up a charter. Greyfriars Church Amongst the buildings demolished to make way for the new frontage of Marischal College at the turn of the 20th century, was the Greyfriars collegiate church, built in 1532 and incorporated as part of the College in 1593. Following a dispute regarding the conservation of this church, a new church building was constructed within the Marischal College complex. It is incorporated into the College frontage, which includes the southern tower, notable for being surmounted with a spire. The southern tower of the Marischal College frontage ‚Äì the spire of Greyfriars Church, Alexander Marshall Mackenzie, 1903 Following a merger, this church was later to become known as Greyfriars John Knox Church. The building is currently unused and is being offered for sale by the Church of Scotland for commercial or residential use.

It centres on the idea that children are best cared for within their own families; however, it also makes provisions for instances when parents and families do not co-operate with statutory bodies. Passage The Children Bill was announced as part of the Queen's Speech on 22 November 1988 and formally introduced to the House of Lords the following day by the Lord Chancellor, Lord Mackay of Clashfern. The Bill was given its second reading in the Lords on 6 December, and was passed to the committee stage on 13 December. Committee debates were held on 19 and 20 December and 23 January 1989. It reached the report stage on 2 February, with debates on 6, 7 and 16 February. On 16 March the Bill was given its third reading in the Lords before being passed to the House of Commons. The Bill was given its second reading in the Commons on 27 April. It was granted Royal Assent on 16 November 1989 and became an Act. Contents=Part I: IntroductoryWelfare of the child= The Children Act 1989 states that children's welfare should be the paramount concern of the courts. It also specifies that any delays in the system processes will have a detrimental impact on a child's welfare. The court should take into account the child's wishes; physical, emotional and educational needs; age; sex; background circumstances; the likely effect of change on the child; the harm the child has suffered or is likely to suffer; parent's ability to meet the child's needs and the powers available to the court.Children Act 1989, Part I, Section 1 =Parental responsibility= Parental responsibility is defined in the Act as \\"all the rights, duties, powers, responsibilities and authority which by law a parent of a child has in relation to the child and his property\\".Children Act 1989, Part I, Section 3 If the child's parents are married both have parental responsibility; if they are unmarried, the father does not automatically have parental responsibility however.Children Act 1989, Part I, Section 2 A father of a child, who was not married to the mother at the time of birth may apply to the courts for parental responsibility, or this may be done through mutual agreement between the mother (or child) and father.Children Act 1989, Part I, Section 4 The Act specifies that more than one person can have parental responsibility, although they can act alone in decision making for the child. If a child does not have anyone to care for them with parental responsibilityChildren Act 1989, Part I, Section 5 a guardian can be appointed by the court. That appointment can be overturned on application of the parent with parental responsibility, by the child or in family proceedings.Children Act 1989, Part I, Section 6 =Section 7 reports= Under Section 7 of the Act, the court can request CAFCASS or local authorities to provide reports to the court in respect of the welfare of the child.Children Act 1989, Part I, Section 7 Part II: Orders with respect to children in family proceedingsResidence, contact, prohibited steps, and specific issue orders= Section 8 of the Children Act 1989 outlines the orders which can issued by the court. A \\"contact order\\" (now termed a Child Arrangements Order) outlines the requirements, of the person the child resides with, to allow contact with another person. A ‚Äòprohibited steps order‚Äô prevents a parent from exercising their full parental responsibility without consent of the court. A ‚Äòresidence order‚Äô (now termed a Child Arrangements Order) puts in place the arrangements for whom a child should live with. A ‚Äòspecific issue order‚Äô relates to directions given from the court to address a query that has arisen regarding parental responsibility for a child.Children Act 1989, Part II, Section 8 Section 8 orders cannot be made in regards to children who are looked after; with the exception of the residence order.Children Act 1989, Part II, Section 9 When an application is made to the court for a section 8 order the court takes into account: the nature of the proposed application; the connection the person has to the child; the disruption that could be caused to the child and, if the child is being looked after by the local authority: the local authorities plans for the child's future and the wishes of the child's parents.Children Act 1989, Part II, Section 10 A person who gains a residence order for a child will hold parental responsibility for the time the order is in place.Children Act 1989, Part II, Section 12 Despite this, the Act forbids anyone to change the child's surname or remove them from the United Kingdom without permission from all those with parental responsibility or with express permission from the court.Children Act 1989, Part II, Section 13 Under section 63(3) of the [1980 c. 43.] Magistrates' Courts Act 1980 the court has powers to punish those who do not abide by the ruling set out in the residence order.Children Act 1989, Part II, Section 14 Applications for section 8 orders are now regulated by the Child Arrangements Programme. =Family assistance orders= The court has the power to issue a family assistance order in which a probation officer or local authority officer should be available to \\"advise, assist and (where appropriate) befriend any person named in the order\\".Children Act 1989, Part II, Section 16 Part III: Local authority support for children and familiesChildren in need= Each local authority has a duty to \\"safeguard and promote the welfare\\" of children who are assessed as being in need. A child is deemed as \\"in need\\" if they are disabled or unlikely to achieve a reasonable standard of health or development unless services are provided. The local authority has a duty to provide or facilitate others to provide services for children in need.Children Act 1989, Part III, Section 17 The local authority must provide day care for children in need who are under the age of five and not attending school if appropriate. There should also be provisions for out-of-school hours activities.Children Act 1989, Part III, Section 18 =Accommodation and looking after children= Under section 20 of the Act local authorities must provide accommodation for any child in need who has no-one with parental responsibility to care for them. This may also be extended to children that have a parent available if it is deemed that by staying with them it would put the child at risk. A community home placement may be deemed necessary for persons between the ages of 16 to 18 to promote their welfare and safety. The Act specifies the need to give consideration to children's views when deciding where to accommodate them. Persons with parental responsibility should also be consulted, and if they object the child (unless they are over 16 years old) cannot be accommodated under Section 20 of this Act. The parent can also remove the child from the accommodation provided at any time.Children Act 1989, Part III, Section 20 Accommodation must also be provided when requested in the case of police protection orders or for children on remand or supervision orders that require them to be accommodated.Children Act 1989, Part III, Section 21 The local authority has a duty to safeguard and promote the welfare of the children in its care. The child, parents and other relevant people should be consulted in the decision- making process regarding a child being taken into care and during their time under local authority care. Consideration should also be given to the child's age, understanding, religion, race, culture and linguistic background.Children Act 1989, Part III, Section 22 Sibling groups should be placed together and should be accommodated near their home if possible.Children Act 1989, Part III, Section 23 Looked after children should not be placed in accommodation that restricts their liberty (‚Äòsecure accommodation‚Äô) unless they have a history or are likely to abscond and are at risk of suffering significant harm or are likely to cause harm to themselves or others. For a court to make a decision regarding placing a child in secure accommodation it must be satisfied that the child has legal representation or has been fully informed about how to access legal aid.Children Act 1989, Part III, Section 25 =Children leaving care= Children leaving care should be given advice and assistance from the local authority; this may involve giving assistance in kind or in exceptional circumstances in cash. They may also contribute to the expenses incurred by the young person regarding employment, training or education.Children Act 1989, Part III, Section 24 =Reviewing cases= Section 26 of the Act outlines the obligation of the local authority to review cases regularly and they should have a complaints procedure available to the children they are caring for.Children Act 1989, Part III, Section 26 =Multi-agency working= Local authorities also have a duty to communicate and share information with other agencies if it complies with their own statutory obligations.Children Act 1989, Part III, Section 27 The local authority must consult with educational authorities when a child becomes looked after and ensure they are informed of the educational arrangements for the child.Children Act 1989, Part III, Section 28 =Payment for services= A fee may apply to services provided under Sections 17 and 18 of the Act (\\"other than advice, guidance or counselling\\") to the parents of the child, the young person if over the age of 16, or to a family member (if they receive the service). But the local authority should only charge them if it is reasonable to assume they can pay for the service.Children Act 1989, Part III, Section 29 Part IV: Care and supervisionCare and supervision orders= A care or supervision order may be granted by the court if a child is or is likely to suffer significant harm if they are not placed into local authority care. This also includes children who are ‚Äòbeyond parental control‚Äô. The court may grant a care order in place of a supervision order if they believe it is more appropriate or vice versa.Children Act 1989, Part IV, Section 31 If, during family court the court has concerns for a child's welfare, they can direct the local authority to investigate. The local authority can then decide if they are going to apply for a care order or supervision order. If they decided not to take any legal action, they must explain to the court their reasons for doing so.Children Act 1989, Part IV, Section 37 Applications for care and supervision orders are regulated by the Public Law Outline. Care orders When a care order is issued the local authority must take the child into care and accommodate them for the period of time the order is in force. The local authority will have parental responsibility for the child.Children Act 1989, Part IV, Section 33 Parents and guardians should be given reasonable amounts of contact with the child during the time they are in care unless otherwise directed by the court. However, in urgent situations to protect the child the local authority may refuse contact for up to seven days. Local authorities may apply to the court to prevent contact to safeguard or promote the child's welfare.Children Act 1989, Part IV, Section 34 Supervision orders A supervision order makes it the duty of the supervisor to \\"advise, assist and befriend\\" the child and to consider applying to the court for a variation on the order if it is not being fully complied with.Children Act 1989, Part IV, Section 35 An education supervision order may be granted if it is deemed that a child is not being properly educated. Before an application for an order is made, the education authority must consult with the \\"social service committee\\".Children Act 1989, Part IV, Section 36 Interim orders An interim order may be made if there are reasonable grounds to believe that the subject child has suffered, or is likely to suffer, significant harm. An interim care or supervision order is commonly drafted so as to last until the conclusion of the proceedings or further order. A care order, full or interim will confer parental responsibility (\\"PR\\") upon the applicant local authority. This does not extinguish the PR held previously by members of the child's family and thus their PR is shared with the local authority. A supervision order, interim or final, does not confer PR upon the local authority. =Guardians = A guardian shall be appointed by the court to safeguard the child's interests unless this is deemed not be required by the court. The court can also appoint a solicitor to represent the child.Children Act 1989, Part IV, Section 41 A guardian has access to and may take copies of any local authority records relating to the child concerned.Children Act 1989, Part IV, Section 42 The Guardian is under an obligation to represent and safeguard the interests of the child during the currency of the legal proceedings. A Guardian will invariably be represented by a solicitor. Older children may, if they disagree with the view of their Guardian, instruct their own solicitor to act on their behalf. Guardians have social work expertise but are independent of social services. Part V: Protection of childrenChild assessment orders= A child assessment order can be requested by the local authority if they believe it would not be possible to complete a proper assessment without an order. It must only be requested if the applicant has reason to believe that the child is likely to suffer significant harm or that an assessment is required to determine if the child is likely to suffer significant harm. The child should not be removed from home for the assessment to be completed; though the courts may deem this necessary for the period of assessment.Children Act 1989, Part V, Section 43 =Emergency protection orders= An application can be made to the court for an emergency protection order (EPO) if it is believed a child is likely to suffer significant harm if they are not taken to, or remain in, a place of safety. The name and a description of the child should be provided to court upon application if possible. The order gives the local authority parental responsibly for the child though this should only be exercised as required to safeguard or promote the welfare of the child. As part of the order, the court can direct contact conditions and medical examinations of the child. The local authority has the power to return the child if it is assessed it is safe for the child to return home. It is an offense to obstruct someone who is carrying out the directions of the court in the case of an emergency protection order.Children Act 1989, Part V, Section 44 An emergency protection order lasts up to 8 days (unless the last day is a public holiday, and the court may direct that it is extended until noon on the next non-holiday day). This may be extended only once for a period up to 7 days. During this period the local authority may apply for a care order. The child, parent or care-giver may apply for the order to be discharged. An appeal cannot be made in relation to the making or refusal to make an emergency protection order.Children Act 1989, Part V, Section 45 An emergency protection order may also include an exclusion requirement which can stipulate that a person must leave or not enter the home of the child or must stay away from the area the child lives. This requirement can only be ordered if it is believed that the child will not suffer significant harm if this person no-longer lives at the property. The parent or care-giver who will remain at the home must agree to this requirement. If the child is removed from the home, the exclusion requirement ceases to be in effect.Children Act 1989, Part V, Section 44A In the circumstances in which a child's whereabouts cannot be established although it is believed a person knows where the child is, the court can order that this person provides the relevant authority with the information they hold. The court can also authorise entry into a property to search for a child; a police warrant may be issued to assist with gaining entry.Children Act 1989, Part V, Section 48 =Police protection provisions= If there are concerns of a child suffering significant harm the police have the power to ensure that child is removed to, or remains in, a place of safety for up to 72 hours. They do not require a court order, but they must ensure that the local authority is informed and the child is accommodated appropriately.Children Act 1989, Part V, Section 46 =Section 47 investigations= A local authority must investigate if they are informed that a child in their area is subject of an emergency protection order, is in police protection or is suffering or likely to be suffering significant harm. They must then take any steps, as reasonably practicable, to ensure that the child is safeguarded. If any concerns arise regarding a child's education, the relevant local education authority should be consulted. If as part of the enquiries they are unable to gain access to the child, and they still have significant concerns, the local authority can apply for an emergency protection order, a child assessment order, a care order or a supervision order. If it is deemed an order is not required they may establish a date to review the case.Children Act 1989, Part V, Section 47 =Abduction of children in care= A person is committing an offence if they knowingly take a child, who is in care, away from the responsible person as ordered by the court. It is also an offence to encourage or assist a child to run away from the responsible person; this can be punishable by imprisonment up to 6 months or a fine.Children Act 1989, Part V, Section 49 A recovery order can be made by the court to retrieve a child who is believed to have been abducted.Children Act 1989, Part V, Section 50 Part VI: Community homes All local authorities must ensure they have community homes available to utilise for children looked after. This may be a home which is controlled by the local authority or a voluntary organisation working on behalf of local authority.Children Act 1989, Part V, Section 53 A community home may cease to be used by the local authority if it is deemed unsatisfactory by the Secretary of State.Children Act 1989, Part V, Section 54 If a controlled or assisted community home wishes to discontinue offering a service to local authorities they must give two years notice to the Secretary of State and the local authority.Children Act 1989, Part V, Section 56 If a local authority wishes to cease using a voluntary owned community home, they must also give 2 years notice in writing.Children Act 1989, Part V, Section 57 References Footnotes Bibliography * External links * Category:Children's rights in England Category:United Kingdom Acts of Parliament 1989 Category:English family law Category:Children's rights in Wales Category:1989 in England Category:1989 in Wales Category:Social care in the United Kingdom Category:Family law in the United Kingdom Category:November 1989 events in the United Kingdom ","title":"Children Act 1989"},{"id":"1495654","text":"Hugh Gallagher may refer to: * Hugh Gallagher (advocate) (1933‚Äì2004), author and international disability advocate * Hugh Gallagher (humorist) (aka Von Von Von), author and humorist See also * Hughie Gallacher (1903‚Äì1957), Scottish footballer * Hugh Gallacher (footballer, born 1870) (1870‚Äì1941), Scottish footballer ","title":"Hugh Gallagher"},{"id":"1495657","text":"Interstellar Pig, published in 1984 by Bantam Books, is a science fiction novel for young adults written by William Sleator. It was listed as an ALA Notable Book, a SLJ Best Book of the Year, and a Junior Literary Guild Selection.  Plot  When Zena, Manny, and Joe move into the cinder-block cottage next door, Barney is intrigued by their glamorous, exotic lifestyle. His fascination grows when Zena introduces Barney to their favorite pastime: Interstellar Pig, a board game in which the key objective is to finish the game with the Piggy card in hand. Zena quickly briefs him on the rules: each player picks their character from a box of cards depicting different aliens. Every alien race has their own strengths, weaknesses, and IRSC (Interstellar Relative Sapience Code, with lower numbers favorable). When the time runs out, every home planet will be obliterated except the one belonging to the holder of the Piggy. Barney is amazed when the neighbors keep choosing the same character cards: Joe repeatedly picks water-breathing Jrlb; Zena always chooses Zulma, an arachnoid nymph; and Manny always picks Moyna, an octopus- like gas bag. While snooping through Zena's underwear drawer, Barney finds a manuscript written by Captain Latham--the same Captain who had built the house that Barney and his parents were renting--telling of the event that caused his brother to go crazy. At sea, the Captain rescued a man floating in the ocean, described as having a \\"leathery, greenish, reptilian hide\\" due to sunburn and a \\"swollen contusion\\", \\"yellow and filmed with slime\\" on his forehead.Sleator, William. Interstellar Pig (1984) Insisting that the man is the Devil, the Captain's brother strangles him--and in punishment, is keelhauled. Although he survives, his mind is damaged due to the oxygen deprivation, and he spends the rest of his life locked in his room (which later became Barney's bedroom), scratching patterns into the wooden walls and clinging to the strange trinket he had taken from the murdered man's corpse. That night Barney begins to see a pattern in the marks the Captain's brother had scratched into the window of his bedroom: all the scratches centered on a particular rock on a nearby island. Remembering the trinket \\"to which [the brother] clung as he was pulled from the water, to which he still clings\\", Barney decides to go out to the boulder and see if the trinket had been hidden there. He finds a small, silver, round object: > There was a face carved in this side, nothing but a rigid, slightly smiling > mouth under a single wide-open eye... Crude as it was, the thing seemed > alive. And it was the brutal wrongness of it, the mouth smiling with such > placid idiocy, noseless, under the solitary gaping eye, that made the face > so repellent. The Piggy. Barney realizes that the game is real, the clock is running, and his neighbors --aliens in disguise--will do anything to get the Piggy. Each tries to bribe him with a unique incentive, similar to the Judgement of Paris, but Barney turns them down. Unfortunately by doing so, he's just entered the real game as a player representing the human race. As Barney hurries to select his weapons and equipment before a horde of aliens descend on his cottage, he makes the startling discovery that he shares a psychic link to the Piggy. The Piggy tells him that it created the game so that it could be loved and appreciated, despite its tendency to detonate whole planets (and their surrounding solar systems) from time to time when it hiccups. Barney concludes that the object of the game is backwards, and it is only the possessor of the Piggy that will be blown up. Minutes before his home is destroyed, Barney concocts a plan to pass the Piggy off to another player convincingly enough so that it won't arouse suspicion. He tells the carnivorous lichen where to find the Piggy. However, as they approach it he realizes that the same logical inconsistency exists with the Piggy's version of the story. He decides that the only explanation that makes sense is that the Piggy created both stories in order to learn about new people. He abandons the Piggy and lets the lichen board their spaceship home, drawing off the other alien players. Once they depart, no damage is done to either the lichen or to Earth. The Piggy Barney determines the Piggy to be a recording device created to learn about different races throughout the galaxy. The Piggy is sentient and can communicate, but often answers questions with irrelevant recordings. :\\"Are you the Piggy?\\" I thought at it. \\"Is that who you are?\\" :\\"Yn swlllyyybg k'sshhhhrlkthththwzzz,\\" the voice replied, in a kind of reptilian gurgle. Alien Races There are several alien races mentioned in the book. The lichen, who take off with the Piggy in the conclusion, are a race of carnivorous pseudo-sentient fungi. They are composed of masses of single-celled organisms who \\"cannot lie\\", which Barney uses to his advantage. He transforms into a lichen during combat and asks the neighboring lichen if it has ever seen the end of a game of Interstellar Pig. It denies this, and Barney concludes that no alien race has ever seen the ending - so the \\"timer\\" controlled by the Piggy might not even exist. In essence, the game would continue forever, allowing the Piggy to travel from species to species. IRSC The Interstellar Relative Sapience Code is a number assigned to species determining their intelligence in the game. Barney has an IRSC of 93.7. The lower the IRSC, the higher the intelligence of the race. However, whether or not this applies outside the game is unclear; Barney exhibits superior critical thinking skills when fighting the aliens, even though they have lower IRSCs.

(2010) Homebrew is a term frequently applied to video games or other software produced by hobbyists and amateur developers targeting proprietary hardware platforms (usually with hardware restrictions) that are not typically user-programmable or that use proprietary storage methods. Homebrew can include software made using unofficial, community maintained toolchains or games developed using official development kits such as Net Yaroze, Linux for PlayStation 2, or Microsoft XNA. A game written by a non-professional developer for a system intended to be consumer- programmable, like the Commodore 64, is simply called a hobbyist (rather than a Homebrew developer). Some popular targets for homebrew games include the Nintendo Wii,Dreamcast, Game Boy Advance, PlayStation Portable, and older consoles like the Nintendo Entertainment System or the Atari 2600. All major sixth generation consoles are given attention in Homebrew development, but less so than earlier generations. This is the case mainly because software production for newer consoles requires more time and resources compared to older consoles, newer consoles often employ significantly more complex systems to prevent the execution of unauthorized code, newer consoles generally quickly receive updates containing bug-fixes patching out software exploits required to run homebrew, and emulators for newer consoles, generally, are not accurate enough to reliably develop on. Homebrew is not only limited to games. There are demos and applications that have been released for systems with a homebrew scene. Development Homebrew games for older systems are typically developed using emulators for convenience, since testing them requires no extra hardware on the part of the programmer. Development for newer systems typically involves actual hardware, given the lack of accurate emulators. Efforts have been made to use actual console hardware for many older systems, though. Atari 2600 Homebrew developers use various methods, for example, burning an EEPROM to plug into a custom cartridge board or audio transfer via the Starpath Supercharger. Game Boy Advance Homebrew developers have several ways to use GBA flash cartridges in this regard. First through fourth generation consoles The Atari 2600 is a popular platform for Homebrew developers. Magnavox Odyssey In 2009, Odball became the first game for the Magnavox Odyssey since 1973. It was produced by Robert Vinciguerra who has since written several other Odyssey games. On July 11, 2011, Dodgeball was published by Chris Read. Fairchild Channel F A handful of Homebrew games have been programmed for the Fairchild Channel F, the first console to use ROM cartridges. The first known release is Sean Riddle's Lights Out which included instructions on how to modify the SABA#20 Chess game into a Multi-Cartridge. There is also a version of Tetris and in 2008 \\"Videocart 27: Pac-Man\\" became the first full production Homebrew for the Channel F. Atari 2600 The Atari 2600, released in 1977, is a popular platform for Homebrew projects. Games created for the Atari 2600 can be executed using either an emulator or directly when copied onto a blank cartridge making use of either a PROM or EPROM chip. Unlike later systems, the console does not require a modchip. Although there is one high-level compiler available, batari Basic, most development for the Atari 2600 is still done in 6502 assembly language. Combined with the extremely limited resources of the 2600, it is a difficult system to develop for, and some games are programmed simply for the technical challenge. NES Several compilers are available for the Nintendo Entertainment System, but like the Atari 2600, most development directly applies assembly language. One impediment to NES Homebrew development is the relative difficulty involved with producing physical cartridges, although third-party flash carts do exist, making Homebrew possible on original NES hardware. Several varieties of custom processors are used within NES cartridges to expand system capabilities; most are difficult to replicate except by scavenging old cartridges. The hardware lockout mechanism of the NES further complicates the construction of usable physical cartridges. However, the NES-101 removed the 10NES lockout chip so any game, whether Homebrew, unlicensed, or another region of an official game, can be played. The original Famicom and its clones also feature no lockout mechanism. The 10NES chip can eventually be permanently disabled by performing a minor change to the hardware. Genesis Pier Solar was released as a Genesis cartridge in 2010. The Sega Genesis has no physical lockout mechanism, making it easier to release software for the system. Rick Dangerous, Rick Dangerous 2, Pier Solar and the Great Architects, and a port of Teenage Queen were released as physical cartridges. Other games include Sacred Line Genesis, Coffee Crisis, and Frog Feast for the Genesis and Mighty Mighty Missile for the Sega Mega-CD. The 2018 game Tanglewood was developed using original Sega development hardware. Neo-Geo MVS, Neo-Geo AES, and Neo-Geo CD The Neo-Geo Home Cart and Arcade Systems can be tough candidates for Homebrew development. Neo-Geo AES and MVS cartridges have two separate boards: one for video, and one for sound. If programming a cartridge for the system were to occur, it would involve replacing the old ROM chips with one's newly programmed ones as the cartridges are in a sense, Arcade boards. NGDevTeam who have released Fast Striker and Gunlord found a workaround with this. What they did was print out their own board, and soldered their own ROM chips into them; this, however, can cause the Universe Bios logo to look corrupted if a custom bios were to be programmed. Programming for the Neo-Geo CD, however is easier than programming for cartridges. The CDs themselves can actually contain both sound and video respectively. Depending on the Megabit count for a game program, load times will vary. A CD game with low Megabit counts will load only one time; whereas a CD game with higher megabit counts could load in between scenes, or rounds. There are now some full games scheduled for release in physical form, such as Neo Xyx.NGDevTeam.com Programmer of the Neo-Geo Universe Bios, Razoola is currently working on a \\"Skeleton Game Driver\\" that supports two players. This ROM is meant to remedy the corrupted Universe Bios Screens, as well as work with an unmodified/stock Neo-Geo Multi-Video System (MVS), or Advanced Entertainment System (AES). SNES After its discontinuation of games in 1999, and production in 2003, Homebrew ROM images were created, despite the various security measures to prevent unauthorized code running on the machine. Eventually the Homebrew community figured out how games ran on the SNES hardware and were able to bypass its security mechanisms. Companies such as Bung Enterprises Ltd. released hardware plugins such as the Game Doctor SF series. These allowed users to not only copy games but also to run Homebrew developed games on SNES hardware. Homebrew ROMs could be converted into the Game Doctor SF format and put onto a 3 1/2\\" floppy. Games as large as twelve megabits could be put on floppy disks formatted to 1.6 megabytes. An alternative device was the Super Flash, by Tototek, which allowed for multiple games to be burned onto a flash memory chip of cartridge. This allowed up to 48 megabits. This chip was the mask ROM for the Super Flash development cartridge; it was easy to use and had a user interface on the computer end. This allowed users to make a SNES game and play it in an actual cartridge rather than a floppy disk. The run and gun game, Alisha‚Äôs Adventure, used original Super Famicom development hardware.https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=iJNazRuMeLc TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine The TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine has a comparatively small homebrew scene. The first homebrew title released on CD was MindRec's Implode in 2002, a few years after the system's last official release (Dead Of The Brain I & II for the PC Engine in 1999). Two years later, MindRec released Meteor Blaster DX on CD-R. Official word was that it was unable to be pressed to CD proper due to the glass mastering software suddenly unable to handle the unorthodox style of CD layout that the system expects. Five years later, Aetherbyte Studios released Insanity, a Berzerk clone, on pressed CD, quelling the notion of unpressable CDs. Aetherbyte later went on to prototype and produce a new HuCard design called \\"AbCARD\\", which was fully compatible with the console. There is one C compiler for the console known as HuC. It has not been officially updated since 2005. The MagicKit assembler is generally considered the de facto assembler for the console, and comes included with HuC. Additional libraries for HuC/MagicKit include Squirrel, a sound engine developed by Aetherbyte Studios, and the SGX/ACD library, developed by Tomatheous, that gives the developer easy access to the SuperGrafx video hardware as well as the Arcade Card. The cc65 C compiler is compatible with the console, although there is no development library support for it. Fifth- generation consoles=Atari Jaguar The Atari Jaguar has had a cult following after being declared as an open platform in 1999. After JTS Corporation sold all the assets of Atari Corporation for $5 million to Hasbro Interactive in 1998, Hasbro released into the public domain all rights to the Jaguar on May 14, 1999, declaring the console an open platform and opening the doors for extensive homebrew development. Because of this, a few developers and publishers such as AtariAge, B&C; Computervisions, Piko Interactive, Songbird Productions, Telegames and Video61 continue to release both previously unfinished games from the Jaguar's past life cycle and several brand new titles to satisfy the system's cult following. These titles are not endorsed or licensed by Atari or Hasbro. Homebrew games for the Atari Jaguar are released in either cartridge, CD or both formats. Titles released in the CD format are either glass mastered, or burned on regular CD-Rs however, since the add-on was released in very limited quantities, most of the Homebrew developers prefer to publish their works either online on forums or in cartridge via independent publishers, with many of the cartridge releases stylized as a retail Jaguar title from the era. Since both systems do not have regional locking all of the titles are region free but some titles, such as Gorf Classic and the initial release of Black Out! do not work correctly on PAL systems. Some of the earliest CD releases were not encrypted, requiring either B&C;'s Jaguar CD Bypass Cartridge or Reboot's Jagtopia (Freeboot) program burned into a CD in order to run unencrypted CD games, but Curt Vendel of Atari Museum released the binaries and encryption keys for both the cartridge and CD format, making it possible to run games without the need of development hardware. A cracked BIOS of the Jaguar CD can be installed inside the system but with some soldering skills. Some of the titles listed have been released on other platforms, such as the Amiga, Atari ST, Dreamcast, Genesis, mobile devices, PC, PlayStation and Super Nintendo. The very first Homebrew title programmed for the Jaguar dates from 1995, a version of Tetris called JSTetris developed using a hacked Alpine Dev. Kit, one of the pieces of development hardware used to program official Jaguar titles. Since emulation of the console is still limited, coding is conducted using a real Jaguar console through either the Skunkboard development cartridge, using a BJL modified Jaguar, or the official Alpine Development Kit. The commercial game BattleSphere Gold, also contains the JUGS (Jaguar Unmodified Game Server) aid to development. Homebrew games and demos for the system developed between 1995-2008 were done by small groups which released their titles in either downloadable or physical format, with the downloadable games needing an emulator or development device. There has been an increase in the number of Homebrew games released for the Jaguar in recent years. There are also ST-to- Jaguar conversions, which involves porting titles from the Atari ST to the Jaguar, which a few of them includes some enhancements and improvements from its original computer version, also done by some members of the community. While they can be downloaded for free, select titles were sold in August 3, 2016 and others, as of date, are being licensed and sold in festivals dedicated to the system such as E-JagFest, JagFest or online via AtariAge. PlayStation Making games on the PlayStation is possible with any model of the system through the use of a modchip or the double 'Swap Trick'. Requirements consist of a PC, SDK, and a 'Comms Link' device to upload and download files to and from the console. Another way of starting Homebrew on the PlayStation is 'UniROM', which is a Softmod. UniROM works by being installed onto a cheat-device, which is connected via the parallel-port (on old consoles) and allows loading of custom code via burned CDs and the serial port. Homebrew was originally promoted by Sony with the Net Yaroze, which had a large scene for quite some time. However, the official Net Yaroze site was shut down in mid-2009, and Sony stopped supporting the system as well as the users who still owned the console. Sega Saturn The Sega Saturn Homebrew scene is small but active. As with the PlayStation, all models are capable of Homebrew. Modchips for the Saturn Model 1 have been scarce for some time, as it seems that no one has produced any new modchips in years. As such, the only two options left are to either perform the swap trick or extensively modify a Saturn Model 2 modchip. Running Homebrew on the Model 2 can be accomplished by bridging two points on the modchip, soldering a wire from the modchip to the Saturn power supply, and inserting it where the CD-rom ribbon cable inserts. The swap trick is more difficult to pull off on this Model due to the lack of an access light. Another method is what is known as the \\"PseudoSaturn\\" unlocking method. It is a program created by CyberWarrior2000 that abuses the \\"Pro Action Replay\\" cartridge's firmware. It unlocks region, frequency, and CD protection of most Saturn models. Either a modded Saturn or a swap trick is required to run the installer, which loads the code in the FlashROM of the cartridge. Afterwards, the cartridge unlocks everything and most software can be run, from backups to Homebrews. There is also now a new engine for development called the Jo-Engine created by Johannes Fetz to allow easy development of 2D games. This engine is currently able to compile 2D games without the Sega Graphic Libraries (SGL). Another engine by XL2, called the Z-Treme engine, led to the creation of a fully 3D Sonic The Hedgehog game called Sonic Z-Treme. Z-Treme uses Sega Basic Libraries (SBL) and Sega Graphic Libraries (SGL). Virtual Boy Planet Virtual Boy has promoted Homebrew for years by the site, since the system has no region lock. But it wasn't until the flash carts FlashBoy and FlashBoy+ were released that the Homebrew scene began to grow. Despite the Virtual Boy's mere 8 months in production before being discontinued (August 1995 - March 1996), dedicated fans have been making a variety of Homebrew games for years. Two previously unreleased games, Bound High! and Niko-Chan Battle (the Japanese version of Faceball) have been released. Nintendo 64 The Nintendo 64 Homebrew scene is small, but Homebrew can still be played and developed through the use of a Doctor V64, (Acclaim used a Doctor V64 to help develop Turok,) the Everdrive 64EverDrive 64 or 64drive. NEC PC-FX There is only one Homebrew development kit known for the PC-FX, which is based on the GNU Compiler Collection version 2.95.1. The Mednafen author began work on a library for the compiler called pcfxlib but it was discontinued due to lack of interest until trap15 started development of a new library called liberis. The toolchain is designed for a Linux environment, although it can also be used with cygwin. To date, no Homebrew titles for the PC-FX have been released, although Aetherbyte Studios and Eponasoft have both expressed interest in developing new software for the console. Sixth-generation consoles=Nuon The Nuon was a game chip built into several DVD players. VM Labs, which made the system, released an SDK just before it went bankrupt. Homebrew Nuon apps can only be played on Samsung DVD-N50x and RCA Nuon DVD players. Dreamcast Despite its short commercial lifespan of less than two years in North America, the Dreamcast benefits from an active Homebrew scene even ten years after its discontinuation. Due to a flaw in the Dreamcast BIOS, which was intended for use with MIL-CD's, the console can run software from CD-R without the use of a modchip. Sega reacted by removing MIL-CD support from the BIOS of the later produced Dreamcast consoles manufactured from November 2000 onwards. The console is especially notable for its commercial Homebrew scene. One notable project was the Bleemcast! emulator, which was a series of bootdisks made to play PlayStation games on the system, featuring visual enhancements over the original console. Newer independent releases include Last Hope, released by RedSpotGames in 2007, and DUX, both Shoot 'em up style games. These releases were written using the KallistiOS development system. A port of the freeware high-level development language Fenix and BennuGD is available for use in game development; many DIV Games Studio games have been ported and others were originally written for the system. PlayStation 2 Early versions of the PlayStation 2 have a buffer overflow bug in the part of the BIOS that handles PS1 game compatibility; hackers found a way to turn this into a loophole called the PS2 Independence Exploit, allowing the use of Homebrew software. Another option for Homebrew development is the use of a modchip. Also, it is possible for developers to utilize a PS2 hard drive and HD Loader. As of May 2008, there is a superior exploit called Free McBoot, which is applicable to all PS2s including Slimlines except for SCPH-9000x models with BIOS 2.30 and up, where the exploit was patched by Sony. Manufacturing of such Homebrew- proof models started in the third quarter of 2008, which is denoted as date code 8C on the console, although some consoles of this line still have the old unpatched 2.20 BIOS. Unlike the Independence Exploit, which requires a trigger disk, Free McBoot needs only a standard Memory Card, which allows it to be used on systems with broken optical drives. The installation is keyed to the Memory Card and will be usable on only the same version consoles that it was originally installed on, unless a Multi-Install is performed. The drawback of this exploit is that it needs to be installed/compiled on each individual memory card. Simply copying the exploit is not possible; this means that an already modded or exploited system is required to install FMCB on a Memory Card. After installing an exploit, unsigned executables (Executable and Linkable Format) may be launched from a Memory Card or a USB drive. Such programs include emulators, media players, hard drive management tools, and PC-based or NAS-based file shares. The exploit is also notable for allowing the user to copy PS1/PS2 save files from a Memory Card to a USB drive, a functionality normally only possible with tools such as a DexDrive. Sony also released an official Homebrew-development kit that allows PlayStation 2 to run Linux. Nintendo GameCube Homebrew development on the Nintendo GameCube tended to be difficult, since it uses a proprietary MiniDVD-based drive and media as opposed to the standard DVD drives of the PS2 and Xbox for piracy protection. Also, its connectivity is limited, as it does not feature a USB port or an HDD port like the PlayStation 2. The barrier to burning Nintendo GameCube discs with a consumer DVD burner is the Burst Cutting Area, a \\"barcode\\" in the innermost ring of the disc, an area inaccessible to most burners and writeable only by very expensive disc pressing machines. For a long time the only way to run Homebrew software on Nintendo GameCube was through a patching-system exploit of Phantasy Star Online Episode I & II, requiring users to find the game and a Broadband Adapter. Both of these are difficult to find because a follow-up has been released (under the name Phantasy Star Online Episode I & II Plus) and thus the original PSO was rarely sold after then, and because the Broadband Adapter was not often carried in stores due to the Nintendo GameCube's very limited selection of online games. As of August 2019, the most common method is to use an Action Replay in conjunction with an SD card adapter inserted into the memory card slot, allowing the user to run Homebrew from the SD card, or over Ethernet. Another method involves using a modchip to allow the GameCube to run Homebrew from a MiniDVD-R via the disc drive. Another method uses a save game exploit which involves transferring modified game save files to a GameCube memory card that triggers arbitrary code execution when loaded by an official game, allowing custom software to be run from a memory card, SD card, or other media. As the Nintendo GameCube's case does not fit a full-size DVD-R, third party replacement cases are available. Homebrew software for the Nintendo GameCube mainly consists of emulators for other systems, as well as several popular Homebrew utilities. Swiss is an ‚Äúall-in-one Homebrew utility‚Äù, including a file browser, and the ability to force software to use different video modes that aren't officially supported, such as progressive scan or 16:9 widescreen. The Game Boy Interface is a Homebrew software frontend for the Game Boy Player peripheral, and is often used for capturing high-quality footage from Game Boy, Game Boy Color, and Game Boy Advance games. Xbox Xbox with a modchip installed The Xbox console uses several measures, including cryptographically signed code to obfuscate firmware. The primary method of executing Homebrew code required installing a mod chip which could be flashed with a modified Microsoft BIOS. This BIOS allowed the system to boot unsigned executables (XBEs) and control several hardware variables, such as region coding and video mode. With the leak of Microsoft's official development kit (XDK) Homebrew coders were able to write replacement Xbox GUIs (known as dashboards), games and applications for the Xbox. A softmod, which uses a commercial game such as 007: Agent Under Fire, Mech Assault, or Splinter Cell, had been created to execute a persistent softmod installer without modification of the hardware. This method utilizes modified font and sound files to cause the Xbox to cause a stack buffer overflow and load a Homebrew dashboard. Once in this condition, the Xbox is able to execute Homebrew games and applications upon boot up. Due to the Xbox using standard PC libraries, writing Homebrew games is relatively easy and the vast majority of libraries available for a PC programmer are available to an Xbox Homebrew programmer. One of the more common type of Homebrew games for the Xbox are ports of PC games whose source has been publicly released or leaked. Many classic PC games have been released for Xbox, but most are created with the XDK which limits their availability. The only places to find these ports are through IRC or peer-to-peer browsers. The Xbox system is also very adept at running emulators which have been ported from PC. The Xbox is able to emulate systems up to the previous generation, including the Nintendo 64 and the PlayStation. For this reason, many different emulators have been created for or ported to the Xbox. Gameboy Advance The popularity of Homebrew development for the Game Boy Advance system since its release in 2001 is due to the availability of C compilers and ready-made, high-quality code libraries, and debugging features for Gameboy Advance emulators like the VisualBoyAdvance-M, the mgba, the No$gba GBA Emulator, John GBA and My Boy. Also contributing to the success is both the nostalgia for the system in general, the Pok√©mon Romhacking community, and the wide availability of Flash ROM cartridges and cartridge writers in online shops. Seventh-generation consoles=PlayStation Portable (PSP)Nintendo DS Nintendo DS Lite with SuperCard DS Lite and MicroSD card. Nintendo DS Homebrew software is unofficial software written for the Nintendo DS by hobbyist programmers, versus software written by a game production company or corporation using the official development tools from Nintendo. Homebrew software is typically used on the DS via third-party rewritable game cartridges, SD cards, emulators, or rewritten game cards (most notably the R4 cartridge). Photographer Steve Chapman, looking for other ways to continue his photography work with smaller equipment, created DS-DSLR, an application that allowed him to control his camera without his bulky laptop. When his camera was connected to the DS through the GBA cartridge slot, DS- DSLR allowed him to execute many tasks, including controlled bracketing, custom intervalshots, and timed long exposures. DS-DSLR even had a noise- activated shutter control which was activated when the DS mic detected noise. Retrieved 2019-10-05. Xbox 360 Microsoft has released a version of its proprietary Software Development Kit (SDK) for free, to would-be Homebrew programmers. This SDK, called XNA Game Studio, is a free version of the SDK available to professional development companies and college students. However, to create Xbox 360 games one must pay for a premium membership to the XNA Creators Club. Once the games are verified, the games written with XNA Studio can be made available for 80, 240, or 400 Microsoft Points to all Xbox 360 owners (through Xbox Live). This allows creators of Homebrew content access to their target audience of Xbox 360 owners. This content is available under the Indie Games section of the New Xbox Experience. On March 20, 2007, it was announced that a hack using the previously discovered hypervisor vulnerability in the Xbox 360 kernel versions 4532 and 4548 had been developed to allow users to run XeLL, a Linux bootloader. The initial hack was beyond the average user and required an Xbox serial cable to be installed and a flashed DVD Drive firmware. Felix Domke, the programmer behind XeLL, has since announced a live bootable Linux CD suitable for novice users, with the capabilities to be installed to the SATA hard drive of the Xbox 360. Despite the availability of such a distribution, the Xbox 360 still isn't considered a popular platform for Homebrew development, given the dependence of the exploit on the DVD-ROM being able to load a burnt DVD game, a modified version of the game King Kong, and two older kernel revisions of the console itself. A group independent of Microsoft is working on the means to run Homebrew code, as part of the Free60 project. Note: The hypervisor vulnerability in the Xbox 360 kernel versions 4532 and 4548 was addressed by Microsoft with the release of the NXE system and dashboard update in 2008. Homebrew was since re-enabled on any Xbox 360 with dash 2.0.7371.0 or lower via an exploit referred to as the jtag / jtag smc hack but was promptly patched again by Microsoft with the 2.0.8495.0 update. Homebrew has now become available on most if not all Xbox 360 consoles due to the Reset Glitch Hack. So far it works on all current dashboards up to as of now the latest 17526 dashboard. Although it can run unsigned code some hardware is required to do the hack/exploit. Also soldering skills are a necessity when attempting to use this exploit. PlayStation 3 The PlayStation 3 was designed to run other operating systems from day one. Very soon after launch, the first users managed to install Fedora Core 5 onto the PlayStation 3 via the 'Install Other OS' option in the PlayStation 3's XMB (Xross Media Bar), which also allows configuring the PlayStation 3 to boot into the other OS installed by default. So far, several Linux flavors have been successfully installed to the PlayStation 3, such as Fedora Core 5, Fedora Core 6, Gentoo, Ubuntu and Yellow Dog Linux (YDL). The latter comes installed with the Cell SDK by default, allowing programmers a low cost entry into Cell programming. See also: Linux for PlayStation 3 Originally, graphics support was limited to framebuffer access only (no access to the PlayStation 3's graphics chip RSX), yet some access to the RSX graphics processor was achieved (but Sony blocked this with firmware release 2.10). As of firmware release 3.21, consumers are no longer able to access the 'Other OS' due to Sony removing the facility Retrieved 2012-04-14. from the software in an update. Sony said this was in response to several 'security concerns'. Homebrew developers do have access to the Cell microprocessor, including 6 of its 7 active Synergistic Processing Elements (SPEs). The Game OS resides under a hypervisor and prevents users from taking full control of the PlayStation 3's hardware. This is a security measure which helps Sony feel secure enough to allow users to install other operating systems on the PS3. The Sixaxis controller has also been exposed to Linux and Windows, but no driver seems to have been successfully created yet that exposes its accelerometer functionality, except for Motioninjoy. However other drivers have successfully used it as a controller for gaming and other applications. In May 2008, a vulnerability was found in the PlayStation 3 allowing users to install a partial debug firmware on a regular console. However, the debug functionality is disabled, so neither Homebrew applications nor backup games can be run yet. Another exploit was found on August 14, 2008, allowing users to boot some backup games from the PlayStation 3's HDD, although the exact instructions on how to do this were not released at that time. However, a different person posted instructions 10 days later, which explained the exploit. On January 6, 2009 a hacking ring known as the \\"Sh4d0ws\\" leaked the jig files needed to launch the PlayStation 3 into service mode. Although the PlayStation 3 can be triggered into service mode, it is not yet of any use because the files needed to make changes to the console have not been leaked. On August 31, 2010, PSGroove, an exploit for the PS3 through the USB port, was released and made open source. This exploit works on all of the PS3 models released up until then. A guide for the creation of the PSGroove is available through several online sources. George Hotz, better known under his nickname \\"geohot\\", has recently appeared on Attack of the Show because he released the PlayStation 3's encryption keys, therefore any Homebrew or custom firmware can be signed. Once signed, Homebrew can be natively run. It would be difficult for Sony to fix this because it would most likely require a voluntary recall and the most expensive parts would have to be replaced. In 2011, Sony, with help from law firm Kilpatrick Stockton, sued Hotz and associates of the group fail0verflow for their jailbreaking activities. Charges included violating the DMCA, CFAA, Copyright law, and California's CCDAFA, and for Breach of Contract (related to the PlayStation Network User Agreement), Tortious interference, Misappropriation, and Trespass.Sony follows up, officially sues Geohot and fail0verflow over PS3 jailbreak.

Wii Wii Homebrew Channel logo In advance of the Wii's release, WiiCade was the first site to host Adobe Flash Homebrew games specifically designed for the Wii and its remote, which could be played without any exploits using the Wii's Opera web browser. The Wii was hacked via a custom serial interface in December 2007. The goal of most Wii exploits is to install the Homebrew Channel, a custom channel that lets users run Homebrew software on the console. The Homebrew Channel's first full release was in December 2008. Though Nintendo successfully patched various older exploits to install the Homebrew Channel, many exploits to run the channel on current firmware exist. This channel can be installed using exploits in games such as Super Smash Bros. Brawl, an exploit in the Internet Channel, or it can be installed via an exploit in the Wii's messaging system. Note that only exploits that use disc games are compatible with installing the Homebrew Channel on the vWii (virtual Wii) mode on a Wii U, with the exception of \\"wuphax\\", an exploit that installs the channel via Wii U specific system permission exploits. The Wii Opera software development kit let developers make their own games in JavaScript. The console's controller was also a popular target for modification. On Aug 9, 2010, Team Twiizers released an exploit called LetterBomb which uses a malformed mail letter (Buffer overflow) to load a boot.elf file into memory, which then installs The Homebrew Channel to run unsigned code. In recent years, other methods exploiting the Internet channel (Flashhax) and EULA have been released (str2hax). In 2019, an exploit using Bluetooth called bluebomb was released. Bluebomb meant the Wii Mini was hackable for the first time, as it was previously not possible due to the Wii Mini's Internet and Wii messaging capabilities, and SD slot removed. Eighth- generation consoles=Nintendo 3DS A New Nintendo 3DS XL running the Homebrew Launcher The first public Homebrew exploit for the Nintendo 3DS, ninjhax, allowed the user to scan a QR Code to exploit the game Cubic Ninja. Other ways to run the Homebrew Launcher have been discovered since then, including freakyhax, an exploit in the Deluxe edition of Freakyforms: Your Creations, Alive!, Doodlebomb, an exploit in the 1.1.1 and older versions of Swapdoodle, and smashbroshax, a New 3DS exclusive exploit for the 3DS version of Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U. The majority of system updates that have \\"Further improvements to overall system stability and other minor adjustments have been made to enhance the user experience\\" in their changelog are simply to patch Homebrew Launcher (userland) exploits that require a specific version of a game or application are often patched in these updates by adding those exploited application versions to the \\"IsTitleAllowed\\" blacklist, which prevents outdated applications on the list from launching, forcing users to update those applications to the latest version to launch the application. For example, notehax only works on outdated versions of Flipnote Studio 3D. In the 11.6.0-39 system update, all regions of Flipnote Studio version <=1.0.1 in USA, <=1.2.0 in EUR, and <=1.3.1 in JPN were blocked from launching the application, patching the exploit on current firmware. Unsigned software can be launched from the SD card without having to install custom firmware on the device by using an exploit to run the Homebrew Launcher. The Homebrew Launcher itself can be launched on system versions 9.0-11.13 on any 3DS system. However, without installing custom firmware, the user will need to run the exploit each time they want to access the Homebrew Launcher. To directly install custom software onto the 3DS home menu, a custom firmware is needed. There are several custom firmware releases available, the most popular being Luma3DS. Requirements to install custom firmware involve using various exploits to run a bootrom exploit called boot9strap, which executes custom code before boot ROM lockout. As of October 2020, the latest exploit uses an oversight in the 3DS browser, which can run the custom code from the app to install the 3DS hacks.  PlayStation Vita  In 2016, an exploit for the PlayStation Vita was released named \\"HENkaku\\". This exploit used a bug found on the 3.60 system firmware, allowing users to run unsigned software. It was installed by visiting a website and clicking on the install button on the PlayStation Vita web browser. This had to be done every time the user turned the system on. In the 3.61 system update, Sony patched the bug to make it impossible to run unsigned code on the Vita. However, in 2018, computer science student TheFloW (Andy Nguyen) found a kernel bug in firmware versions 3.65, 3.67, and 3.68 that allowed unsigned code to be run. Eventually, he developed an exploit called \\"h-encore\\" which allowed one to install the HENkaku hack on later PS Vita versions. The kernel bug was patched in firmware version 3.69, but the userland bug still works. On February 13, 2019, TheFloW released a downgrader tool that can downgrade any Vita console to an older firmware down to its factory firmware.  Wii U  The Wii U currently has Homebrew execution in both the PowerPC kernel and the ARM9 kernel (nicknamed IOSU by the community). The most common way to execute code on the Wii U for 5.5.1 and below is through vulnerabilities in the Wii U's built in web browser. There are many different userland and PowerPC kernel exploits in the Wii U internet browser. The earliest userland exploits used C code (on versions 2.0.0-5.3.2) and libstagefright bugs (on versions 5.4.0-5.5.1) to load custom code in the browser, with memory and permission limitations. The first kernel exploit found in the browser, called osdriver, only works on system versions 5.3.2 and lower, but this is no longer used as the 5.5.1 and lower exploit is more reliable. Currently, two different browser kernel exploits are used in the community. The first exploit found works on 5.5.1 and below and is very reliable. The other kernel exploit works on 5.5.2 and below, but due to its unreliability, it is only used on 5.5.2 to install Haxchi. Haxchi exploits the fact that DS virtual console game data is only checked when the game is installed. When installed to a DS virtual console game, Haxchi launches Homebrew directly (such as the Wii U Homebrew Launcher) using an exploit installed in the game's file location. Many Homebrew applications that run via the Homebrew launcher have been collected and hosted on wiiubru.com, which has a layout similar to that of the Wii U's own menu. These hosted applications can be downloaded directly on the Wii U using the HB App Store app in the repository. Some of these applications utilize an IOSU exploit that was released by the WiiUbru team, which allows full access to any Wii U console. This IOSU exploit is often used to launch a console into a patched mode called CFW (custom firmware) sysNAND. In this patched mode, the system is able to launch any title, including unofficial titles and titles without valid signatures and Wii virtual console games or injections that are shortcuts to vWii (Wii Mode) games or Homebrew applications. All of the current CFWs allow editing of files stored on the Wii U via an internet connection and an FTP application as well. The Wii U's built-in Wii emulator (often nicknamed vWii or Wii Mode) is capable of running Wii Homebrew, such as the Homebrew Channel. However, vWii is much more fragile than a classic Wii console and has a higher chance of being bricked if dangerous software is used. Also, due to changes in the Wii operating system only found in vWii mode, previous exploits that utilized the HOME menu itself to load the HackMii Installer, such as Letterbomb, do not work on vWii. However, exploits that launch the HackMii Installer via a game still work on vWii. The only way to hack vWii without one of the exploit games is using an application called wuphax. Wuphax uses the public Wii U IOSU exploit to temporarily inject the HackMii installer into the Mii Channel so that the Homebrew Channel can be installed without an exploit game. Nintendo Switch The Nintendo Switch got its first exploit with PegaSwitch on March 14, 2017; just 11 days after the console's release. It was developed by a team called ReSwitched, and it can be run through the browser included when connecting to a Wi-Fi network with a login page. Luca Todesco used the same exploit to jailbreak iOS 9 devices in 2016. It did not allow true Homebrew to run on the system at the time, but it let developers look for other security bugs in the system. On October 1, 2017, ReSwitched announced many new exploits and tools allowing developers to start working on Homebrew programs for the system even before they could be launched. At the 34c3 event, hackers Plutoo, Derrek, and Naehrwert announced a kernel exploit for the system (which they said would not be released) and said that a Homebrew launcher was coming soon. On January 7, 2018, fail0verflow posted a video to Twitter showing a simple side-scrolling text program before booting the system, which shows that there is a way to run code before boot, opening up possibilities for new programs focused on development. A Homebrew launcher application has been released as well,https://switchbrew.github.io/nx-hbl/ and a custom firmware called Atmosphere, has also been released.https://twitter.com/SciresM/status/969790718951608321 Access to a Japanese copy of Puyo Puyo Tetris is initially required to install a Fake News exploit to launch the CFW on 1.0.0. For later system versions, the ability to install depends on the age of the console, as new consoles first appearing in June 2018 and shipping with system version 4.1.0 have their bootroms patched against the TrustZone (full control) exploit that allows CFW to be installed. As long as the system does not have the patches (which can only be installed at the factory during console assembly), the exploit can be used to install CFW.https://reinx.guide/firsttime On March 29, 2018, SciresM, a respected developer in the Homebrew community, announced that custom firmware called \\"Atmosphere\\" would be released for all available firmware versions at the time. Firmware above 1.0.0 will be hackable via a cold boot exploit known as Fus√©e Gel√©e developed by the Reswitched team. This exploit takes advantage of a bug in the boot ROM on the Tegra X1 chip used by the Nintendo Switch. The exploit was also independently discovered by Fail0verflow under the name ShofEL2. Firmware version 1.0.0 will be hackable via a Trustzone exploit known as Jamais Vu. Atmosphere released its first public build in October 2018, which supports all system versions.  Xbox One  The Xbox One has a Dev Mode, though intended to be used for retail game development, can be used to run unsigned Homebrew software. It can be enabled on any retail Xbox One console. Dev Mode disables retail games and software while enabled. Homebrew software can be developed as Universal Windows Platform applications, allowing many programs designed to run on desktop editions of Windows 10 to run on the console including console emulators.

It was the consumer version of Final Cut Pro and was designed for advanced editing of digital video as well as high-definition video, which was used by many amateur and professional videographers. Final Cut Express was considered a step above iMovie in terms of capabilities, but a step underneath Final Cut Pro and its suite of applications. As of June 21, 2011, Final Cut Express was discontinued in favor of Final Cut Pro X.Golson, Jordan. \\"Apple Discontinues Final Cut Express with Launch of FCP X.\\" Mac Rumors. N.p., June 22, 2011. Web. Nov 23, 2012. . History Final Cut Express 1.0, based on Final Cut Pro 3, was released at Macworld Conference and Expo in San Francisco in 2003. The second version, based on Final Cut Pro 4, was released at Macworld San Francisco in 2004. The third version, capable of editing high definition video, was also announced at Macworld San Francisco a year later, and was released as Final Cut Express HD in February 2005. It was based on Final Cut Pro HD (version 4.5) and included LiveType 1.2 and Soundtrack 1.2. Final Cut Express version 3.5 was released with little fanfare in May 2006 as a Universal Binary. In addition to improving real-time rendering with Dynamic RT, version 3.5 upgraded LiveType to version 2.0 and Soundtrack to version 1.5. In November 2007, Apple released Final Cut Express 4, which although it did not support real-time editing in the AVCHD format (it only allowed for transcoding AVCHD to Apple Intermediate Codec (AIC) provided that the camera was actually attached to the computer - it did not convert AVCHD files stored elsewhere and is currently for Intel processors only), imported iMovie '08 projects and included 50 new filters. It did not include Soundtrack 1.5, but it still included LiveType which enables users to create advanced text for the movies they created in Final Cut. The price was dropped from $299 for version 3.5 to $199 for version 4.0. In June 2011, Final Cut Express was officially discontinued, in favor of Final Cut Pro X. Features Final Cut Express' interface was identical to that of Final Cut Pro, but lacks some film-specific features, including Cinema Tools, multi-cam editing, batch capture, and a time code view. The program performed 32 undo operations, while Final Cut Pro did 99 . Features\\"Final Cut Express 4 - Technical Specifications.\\" Final Cut Express 4 - Technical Specifications. N.p., n.d. Web.

RT Extreme Inherited from Final Cut Pro, Final Cut Express features RT Extreme, which allows previews of some video filters and transitions without rendering. Audio that is not in the native AIFF file format needs rendering before it can be played back. RT Extreme has three modes: 'Safe', for seeing multiple video layers at a quality that more or less guarantees a smooth playback; 'Unlimited', which allows the maximum number of composited video layers to be viewed at the same time; and 'Dynamic', which alternates between these settings depending on how many simultaneous video tracks are present. Frame dropping may result from using 'Unlimited' on low- resource machines. Boris Calligraphy Like Final Cut Pro, Express also comes with Boris Calligraphy, a plugin for advanced titling and scrolling/crawling titles more sophisticated than the ones that can be created with the built-in title overlays. Calligraphy has a WYSIWYG interface and features wrapping, alignment, leading, kerning and tracking features, as well as allowing up to five custom outlines and five custom drop shadows to be defined for a selected portion of the title.  Soundtrack  Prior to version 4, Final Cut Express included Soundtrack 1.5, a music program similar to the consumer-level GarageBand, but designed for videographers who wish to add music to their films. Soundtrack comes with around 4,000 professionally recorded instrument loops and sound effects that can be arranged in multiple tracks beneath the video track. To use Soundtrack, users export their Final Cut Express sequence, or a marked portion thereof, as a reference file, which can include scoring markers defined in the timeline. This reference file can be imported as the video track in Soundtrack. Soundtrack is functionally and visually identical to Soundtrack Pro's multitrack editing mode, but includes fewer Logic plugins and lacks the highly regarded noise removal tool. Soundtrack was removed from Final Cut Express 4, which lowered its price and may have encouraged people to buy Logic Express. References Category:MacOS-only software made by Apple Inc.

The idea of a quorum was established by Joseph Smith early in the history of the movement, and during his lifetime it has included several church-wide quorums, including the First Presidency, the Presiding High Council, the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, the Anointed Quorum, and the Quorum of the Seventy, as well as numerous local quorums for each congregation. The Council of Fifty, or General Council, was not part of the church, but a quorum-like body designed as a forerunner to establishing a theocratic government. The concept of a quorum continues to have significant meaning in most modern Latter Day Saint denominations. Quorums are expected to act unanimously, if possible, and are chaired by one person who is designated as the president or presiding officer. Quorums in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints In The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), a quorum is a body (group) of those ordained to the same office of the priesthood. The size of each quorum depends on the office to which the members are ordained. General authority quorums There are certain quorums that are called to preside over the entire church. These quorum members are called general authorities. The Presidency of the Church (commonly called the First Presidency) is a quorum consisting of at least one apostle (the President of the Church) and two or more high priests.Doctrine and Covenants, In practice, all members of the First Presidency are usually apostles. The First Presidency presides over the entire church, although only church's president is authorized to use all priesthood keys within the church. The members of this quorum are usually the President of the Church and his first and second counselors. The First Presidency may be expanded to allow for additional counselors, when needed. The Quorum of the Twelve Apostles is a group of twelve men, ordained to the office of apostle, that have been called as \\"special witnesses of the name of Christ in all the world\\". This quorum is \\"equal in authority and power to the three presidents previously mentioned.\\"Doctrine and Covenants, Members of this quorum hold priesthood keys, but they are only used under the direction of the First Presidency. The Presiding Bishopric is a quorum consisting of three men who are called to preside over the Aaronic priesthood and the temporal affairs of the church. This quorum consists of the Presiding Bishop and two counselors, who hold priesthood keys to direct the temporal affairs and finances of the church, in conjunction with the First Presidency and Twelve. They also hold all of the keys of the Aaronic priesthood. In current practice, these men are always high priests and ordained bishops. The Quorums of the Seventy \\"are also called to preach the gospel, and to be especial witnesses unto the Gentiles and in all the world\\". These quorums are \\"equal in authority to that of the Twelve special witnesses or Apostles just named.\\"Doctrine and Covenants, Each Quorum of the Seventy may consist of up to seventy ordained to the office of Seventy. All the quorums of the seventy are presided over by seven presidents‚Äîthe Presidency of the Seventy‚Äîwho hold keys to direct the affairs of the quorums. There may be an unlimited number of such quorums that are called to witness in \\"all the world\\", but currently only the members of the first and second quorums are general authorities of the church.Doctrine and Covenants, In 2015, the church stopped publicly differentiating between members of the First and Second Quorums of the Seventy, using the more generic term \\"General Authority Seventies.\\" Six other seventy quorums are designated as authorities over specific areas of the church. Local priesthood quorumsMelchizedek priesthood quorums= A High Priests Quorum is a local quorum organized in each stake and presided over by the stake presidency, who holds the keys of the Melchizedek priesthood within the stake. Along with the stake presidency, Melchizedek Priesthood holders currently serving as a functioning patriarch, in a bishopric, or on the stake high council within the stake form this quorum. Full quorum meetings are held annually.https://www.deseretnews.com/article/900014550/president-nelson- announces-major-changes-to-structure-of-lds-priesthood-quorums.html (Historically, a High Priests Group was also organized in local units, presided over by a group leader and two assistants, with each group consisting of all high priests within that unit. On March 31, 2018, high priest groups were discontinued, with all local high priests not in the callings noted above becoming members of their unit's elders quorum).http://fox13now.com/2018/03/31/lds-church-announces-they-will- discontinue-high-priests-groups An Elders Quorum is a local quorum organized in each ward and presided over by a president with priesthood keys who, along with his two counselors, act under the direction and authority of the stake presidency, and under the direction of the bishop. Each quorum consists of up to 96 Melchizedek Priesthood holders.Doctrine and Covenants, Historically, a local Quorum of Seventy existed which consisted of up to seventy members in each quorum, and was presided over by seven presidents, each of whom had keys and acted under the direction and authority of the stake president. In the LDS Church, quorums of seventy are no longer organized in local wards or stakes. =Aaronic priesthood quorums= A Priests Quorum is a quorum consisting of up to 48 Aaronic priesthood holdersDoctrine and Covenants, ordained to the office of priest. Young men are eligible to become a priest at the beginning of the year of their 16 birthday. If there are more than 48 priests in the ward, then the bishop may choose to divide the quorum.Handbook 2, section 8.1.2. Priests Quorums are organized at the ward level and presided over by the bishop.Doctrine and Covenants, The bishop typically calls two \\"assistants\\" from the quorum to oversee the day-to-day affairs of the quorum.Church Handbook 2, 8.3.1 A Teachers Quorum is a quorum consisting of up to 24 individualsDoctrine and Covenants, ordained to the office of Teacher. Young men are eligible to become a teacher at the beginning of the year of their 14 birthday. If there are more than 24 teachers in the ward, then the bishop may choose to divide the quorum. Teachers Quorums are organized at the ward level and act under the direction of the bishop, who calls a Teachers Quorum President to hold keys to direct the work of the quorum.Handbook 2 section 8.3.2. A Deacons Quorum is a quorum consisting of up to 12 individualsThe Doctrine and Covenants, ordained to the office of Deacon. Young men are eligible to become a deacon at the beginning of the year of their 12 birthday. If there are more than 12 deacons in the ward, then the bishop may choose to divide the quorum. Deacons Quorums are organized at the ward level and act under the direction of the bishop, who calls a Deacons Quorum President to hold keys to direct the work of the quorum. =Administrative quorums= A stake presidency is a quorum consisting of three to administer a unit of church organization called a stake. This quorum consists of the stake president and two counselors who are each ordained to the office of high priest. A stake high council is an administrative quorum consisting of twelve men called that assist in the administration of a stake. Each of the members is ordained to the office of high priest, and also belongs to the High Priests Quorum in the stake. A bishopric is a quorum consisting of three to administer a church congregation or ward. This quorum consists of a bishop and two counselors. While a bishop and his counselors are typically high priests, counselors may hold other priesthood offices.In Latter-day Saint single adult wards, often counselors are elders rather than high priests. Typically, the bishop is also set apart as the quorum president of the Priests Quorum, and he, together with two priests who serve as his assistants, form the presidency of the priests quorum. A quorum presidency is an administrative quorum consisting of a quorum president who holds keys to direct the affairs of the quorum, and two counselors who he has selected to assist him. In most cases, the president will also select a secretary whom he will delegate authority to as needed. Organization presidencies and groups such as the Relief Society, Primary, Sunday School, Young Men, and Young Women do not form quorums because they are considered auxiliary to the priesthood and its quorums.

WRHS) is located in Holden, Massachusetts, United States and services the Wachusett Regional School District. Founded in 1955, WRSD comprises Holden, Paxton, Princeton, Rutland, and Sterling. William Beando was appointed principal as of July 1, 2007, succeeding the one year interim service of longtime principal Hal Lane, who had retired in 1993. The assistant principals are Andrew Costa, Anthony DiBenedetto, Victoria DeSimone, and Michael Pratt. Academics The school offers a wide range of courses in many subjects, chiefly of four difficulty levels. The CPA, College Prep - Accelerated, is the accelerated college preparatory level, and the majority of students take classes at this level. The Honors level is above CPA. CP, College Prep is the regular level for students and prepares them for studies after high school. Students at the CP level may need a little extra support with their studies to prepare them for post-high school studies. The fourth main class level is AP, or Advanced Placement, a College Board program through which college credit can be awarded for excellent performance on year-end standardized exams. There are also V or \\"0\\" level courses, which are usually mandatory or non-academic, such as physical education and special education courses. The Advanced Placement program at the school has proven a great success. Since 2005, 88% of students taking the end-of-year examination have earned a score of \\"3\\" or better, qualifying many of the students for college credit. As of 2010, the high school offers nineteen Advanced Placement courses. The high school also consistently exceeds state and national averages for the Scholastic Aptitude Test, or SAT. School activities=Music Department WRHS has a large and well regarded music department- which includes several choirs or varying sizes, orchestra and concert bands, string and wind ensembles, as well as jazz performance groups (both vocal and instrumental). For each of the past seven years, WRHS has received recognition from the Grammy Foundation for being one of the top 100 high school music programs in the United States.Remarks of Hon. James P. McGovern, WRHS's music department also has a special partnership with the Boston Symphony Orchestra which permits the students to sit in on rare closed rehearsals of the orchestra. In the spring of 2005, WRHS performed admirably at an international music competition in Toronto, Ontario. At the Festival of Music, Wachusett received first place in the Jazz Band competition, receiving recognition for having several excellent musicians, soloists, and sections. Jazz Choir and Orchestra also took first place in their respective categories. Singers and Chamber Choir took first place in the Mixed Men's and Women's Choir section. String Orchestra received a first place award as well. Wind Ensemble received second place overall. In April 2003 and 2007, the Honors Music Program performed in Florida and visited Walt Disney World, performing on various stages within the park and in Disney Springs. Also in 2007, the Honors Choirs performed at Foxwoods with Kenny Rogers, and also in 2008 at Mohegan Sun. In the spring of 2009, WRHS competed in the North American Festival of Music in Toronto, Ontario, receiving several first and second place awards. The Wachusett Madrigal Singers were first led to International Music Festival Gold in 1993 by beloved director, and recipient of the MMEA Lowell Mason Award, and the MMEA Distinguished Service Award, Grace V Reidy. Extracurricular activities=Wachusett Model United Nations and Civics Club Wachusett's Model United Nations program was first established in the 1970s. Under the current guidance of a political science teacher, Wachusett frequents several model United Nations conferences in locations such as Northeastern University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Clark University, and Princeton University. The Wachusett Model United Nations organization has since been disbanded and replaced by the Wachusett Civics Club. This new club was founded in 2018 and continues to participate in model United Nations events along with Model Congress and moot court. Massachusetts Club Formed during the 2005‚Äì2006 school year, the Massachusetts Club takes group trips to historic places throughout the state, usually on weekends. Trips taken include a day spent in Rockport, several visits to Boston, and a trip to Salem. Sports Under the school colors of green and white, Wachusett fields many perennially competitive sports teams. The school has forty-six athletic programs, in which about 1,000 students participate. These include lacrosse, American football, basketball, baseball, soccer, tennis, ice hockey, track, cross country, lacrosse, alpine skiing, volleyball, gymnastics, field hockey, golf, and swimming. The girls soccer team won consecutive Division 1 state championships in 2017 and 2018. The girls indoor track team won the Division 1 state championship in 2018. The boys hockey team won the Division 3 state championship in 2019. The girls cross-country team has won 13 consecutive league championships, and a number of consecutive district championships. Both girls and boys track teams are consistently among state's best. Wachusett's soccer teams have also won several championships, most recently the girls' team in 2017. In 2004, the Boys Basketball team won the District Championship, supported by the enormous \\"Badlands\\" student rooting section, known as the loudest student section in Central Massachusetts. The school's football team went undefeated in the 2003 season and has won back-to-back Super Bowl Titles. The team went undefeated yet again in 2009, with a record of 13‚Äì0, beating 4th ranked Holy Name in the super bowl. In 2007, the girls gymnastics team was crowned Mid-Wach league champions following an undefeated season, and went on to place 6th overall in the state. The baseball team won district championships in 2010 and 2017 and selected and won games in the Super Eight State Tournament in 2015 and 2018. The cheerleading team has won multiple National Championships. The Boys Varsity Hockey Team Also won the 2018-2019 state championship, playing their last game in TD Garden. Science Seminar and Science Fair Every year, Wachusett conducts a school science fair. Winners of the school competition advance to the Regional Science Fair. In order to help students develop high quality projects and to stimulate their interest in science, Wachusett holds Science Seminar meetings every Tuesday night. Interested students take an entrance examination in order to be admitted to Science Seminar. For the first hour of these meetings, a scientist from the community speaks to seminar members about his/her work. The second hour consists of meetings between students and their science project advisors for help and guidance in the process. Many students have done well at the Regional Science Fair, State Science Fair, International Science and Engineering Fair, and other fairs. Science Seminar is presided over by Carol Sullivan, a longtime teacher at the school, as well as a variety of advisers who are current or retired scientists in the field. Every week a prominent figure in the field of science is brought in to give a one-hour lecture on their chosen subject (subjects range from forensic science to the latest solar panel technology to the size of the universe), and then students break into groups to meet with their adviser and discuss their year-long science project. Theater Arts The Theater Company at Wachusett performed in the MHSDG One Act Play festival under the direction of Doug Ingalls for over 10 years, before Ingalls' passing in 2009, after which the school's Black Box Theater was renamed the Doug Ingalls Black Box Theater in honor of its long standing director. In 2003 Wachusett had its first ticket to the final round in Boston with Beyond Tolerance. This was followed in 2004 with Tom Jones, in 2005 with Medea, in 2007 with For Whom The Southern Belle Tolls, and in 2008 with \\"The Magdalene Laundries,\\" an original play written by Mr. Ingalls.

When war broke out in Korea three years later, Sasebo became the main launching point for the United Nations and the U.S. Forces. Millions of tons of ammunition, fuel, tanks, trucks and supplies flowed through Sasebo on their way to the U.N. Forces in Korea. The number of Americans in Sasebo grew to about 20,000; and some 100 warships and freighters per day swelled the foreign populations still more. After the Korean War ended, the Japan Self-Defense Forces were formed, and Japan Maritime Self- Defense Force ships began to homeport in Sasebo (Sasebo District Force).

Its historic buildings are the centrepiece of the University of Aberdeen's Old Aberdeen campus, often known as the King's or King's College campus. The focal point of the college, as well as its oldest building, is the late 15th century King's College Chapel. A number of other historic buildings remain, with others being subject to renovation and rebuilding in the 18th and 19th centuries. In the early 20th century, a great deal of expansion saw the university buildings increase around the historic college buildings. In the later 20th century, the university expanded dramatically in size, dominating Old Aberdeen and expanding out from the High Street with a number of modern buildings. History King's College quad King's College was the first university in Aberdeen, the third in Scotland and the fifth in the British Isles. In 1495, William Elphinstone, the relatively newly appointed Bishop of Aberdeen, petitioned Pope Alexander VI on behalf of King James IV to create the facility to cure the ignorance he had witnessed within his parish and in the north generally. A papal bull was issued in February 1495 (1494 in the calendar of the day) founding the university; a royal charter later that year recognised Aberdeen's status as equal to that of Scotland's two existing universities at Glasgow and St Andrews. As a former professor at the University of Paris, Elphinstone modelled the university very much on the continental European tradition. Hector Boece, a fellow professor at Paris, was awarded the status of first principal of the new institution. It would not be until 1509, with the issuance of a charter by Elphinstone, that university life at King's truly began. Construction of the chapel began in 1498; it was consecrated in 1509 and dedicated to St Mary. By 1514, the university had some forty-two members in the form of both staff and students. Following the Reformation, King's College was purged of its Roman Catholic staff but remained largely resistant to change in its methods. George Keith, the fifth Earl Marischal, however was a moderniser within the college and supportive of the reforming ideas of Peter Ramus. In April 1593 Keith founded a second university in the city, Marischal College. Initially, Marischal offered the principal of King's College a role in selecting its academics, however this was refused by the authorities of King's ‚Äì cited as the first blow in a future rivalry. In common with Marischal, King's College supported the Jacobite cause and following the defeat of the 1715 rising both were largely purged of their academics and officials. College buildings New Building, King's College The building work on the main buildings of the college began in April 1500 on marshy land, supported by large oak beams. The chapel is topped with an imperial crown, i.e. a closed crown, which appears to make a claim to imperial status for the Scottish monarchy. The original was lost in a storm in 1633, and the present crown is a recreation. King's College chapel retains more medieval woodwork than any other Scottish church, including the choir stalls and screen. The Cromwell Tower was a building built during the 1650s-60s during the period of the Commonwealth of England, Scotland and Ireland, although finished after Charles II had been reinstalled as King. It was used for accommodation and had an ornate turret at its top. It continues its function as an observatory to this day. Elphinstone Hall The 1930 construction of the Elphinstone Hall effectively created a two-quadrangle arrangement, connected to the original King's buildings. The Hall's front faces outwards, with its lawn effectively creating a central open space now bordered on the other sides by Old Aberdeen's High Street and the New Building (\\"New King's\\"), constructed in 1913. King's College is now within the university's main Old Aberdeen campus and retains its original and historic quadrangle which houses a large conference centre and the university's chapel. Elphinstone Hall is used for functions, dining, and examinations. The rear of King's College is now used as a sports pavilion. Notably the old college buildings now provide a focal point to the wider university campus. While small in comparison with some of the newer constructions and areas, the building maintains a great deal of importance. King's College Chapel King's College Chapel King's College Chapel is the main chapel used by the University of Aberdeen. Forming the north side of the original quadrangle of King's College, construction of the chapel began in 1498 and ended with the consecration of the building in 1509. The most notable architectural feature of the Chapel is its Crown Tower, which has become an icon of the university as a whole. The chapel is dedicated to the Trinity and the Blessed Virgin Mary in her Nativity, yet also commemorates a number of Scottish and British monarchs, as well as the patrons and founders of the university. The name particularly recalls the College's main patron, King James IV of Scotland. Particularly notable within the chapel are the choir stalls and rood screen, which date back to around 1509. These form the most complete mediaeval church interior in Scotland. Since 1928, the antechapel has been used as the university's war memorial: five hundred and twenty-four students of the university are commemorated on its walls, having fallen in the First and Second World Wars. Bishop Elphinstone, the College's founder, and Hector Boece, its first Principal, were buried at the foot of the chancel, although a larger tomb to Elphinstone is located outside the college. However, a later renovation of the chapel found the Bishop's body to be missing, its ultimate fate unknown. The design of the chapel, as well as its date of construction, were designed to evoke Solomon's Temple. The King's College Centre The King's College Conference Centre is a conference and events space within the King's College building, established in 1991 within the former university library, yet maintaining many of the original features of the buildings. The conference centre housed the Scottish Parliament between 28 and 30 May 2002 whilst the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland took over its usual annual residence at New College, Edinburgh (the assembly hall of which it had lent the Scottish Parliament during the time of the construction of the new parliament building in Holyrood). During this time, the parliament was addressed by Her Majesty, the Queen as part of her Golden Jubilee tour of the United Kingdom. Modern campus The university owns much of the land and buildings on the campus, but others are in private ownership as private houses, shops and businesses. Many of these serve the university community. There are also extensive lawns, trees and large displays of flowers. These green spaces are popular places to sit in summer for students and staff. The original buildings and High Street form the heart of the modern campus and are still used for teaching, to house academic departments, and other university activities. During the 20th century, the university purchased land around these buildings and constructed new ones to enable expansion. These buildings generally reflect the prevailing architecture of their period. The most recent building is the Sir Duncan Rice Library, completed in 2011.

PAX TV began on August 31, 1998. During the time between the sale of HSN and the founding of PAX TV, Paxson moved his headquarters from Tampa to West Palm Beach. However, the network never received anywhere near the ratings or advertising revenue of the other networks. In addition, PAX TV lost a few affiliates, such as when Paxson sold its Dayton, Ohio, and Green Bay, Wisconsin, stations to ACME Communications so that group could affiliate them with The WB (though PAX TV programming continued to air overnight on those stations for a few years), and the network was unable to offer their programming in some markets, like St, Louis, Charlotte and Pittsburgh.

Possibly sensing that NBCU would do so, and beset with lawsuits over the operation of i, Paxson resigned from the company he founded. In addition, Paxson became Ion Media Networks, and NBCU executive R. Brandon Burgess became the chief executive officer. In time, i was rebranded to Ion Television.

It is the centrepiece of the redevelopment of Portsmouth Harbour, which was supported by a National Lottery grant. Its shape was chosen by Portsmouth residents from a selection. The tower, designed by local firm HGP Architects and engineering consultants Scott Wilson and built by Mowlem, reflects Portsmouth's maritime history through its being modelled and named after a spinnaker, a type of sail that balloons outward. The tower was opened on 18 October 2005. The tower is owned by Portsmouth City Council, but operationally it is managed by Continuum Leading Attractions, a cultural attractions group based in York. Continuum also runs five other visitor attractions across the country. Following a commercial sponsorship deal with Dubai-based Emirates airline, the tower was renamed in July 2015. Structure The tower, at a height of , is times as high as Nelson's Column, making it one of the tallest accessible structures in the United Kingdom outside London. The tower is visible around Portsmouth, changing the horizon of the area. It can be seen from the Isle of Wight, the Manhood Peninsula, even Highdown Gardens in Worthing and Nine Barrow Down. The tower represents sails billowing in the wind, a design accomplished using two large, white, sweeping metal arcs, which give the tower its spinnaker sail design. The steelwork was fabricated by Butterley Engineering. At the top is a triple observation deck, providing a 360¬∞ view of the city of Portsmouth, the Langstone and Portsmouth harbours, and a viewing distance of . The highest of the three observation platforms, the Sky Deck, has only a wire mesh roof, so visitors are open to the elements. The windows extend above head height, so it is not possible to get a view unobstructed by glass. A glass floor is located on the first viewing deck at 100 metres above sea level. The tower has a design lifetime of 80 years.LUSAS, 4 November 2005. Spinnaker Tower, Portsmouth. Retrieved 17 September 2006. History The tower was originally called the Portsmouth Millennium Tower and was designed as a monument to commemorate the Millennium celebrations in 2000. The project was conceived in 1995 with an original opening date planned for late 1999. Due to political, financial, contractual and construction problems and extra funding requests by the builders Mowlem, construction didn't begin until 2001 and was completed in mid-2005. Because of the six-year delay in opening and not having been ready for the Millennium as planned, the tower was renamed Spinnaker Tower. The overall development project was over budget, with the tower costing ¬£35.6 million alone. Taxpayers were never intended to fund the tower, but Portsmouth City Council eventually contributed ¬£11.1 million towards construction. In March 2004, Portsmouth Council's former leader Cllr Leo Madden resigned as leader of the Labour Group on the council after a highly critical report of the council's handling of the project and its failure to exploit revenue opportunities, such as the Millennium. Barry Smith, the project's legal advisor, also retired after being suspended on full pay, mostly because of controversy over the contract with the builders, which at one point would have cost the council more to cancel than to complete. The tower has suffered from a number of issues since opening, including a malfunctioning external glass lift. During the final construction phase, a protester from the rights group Fathers 4 Justice scaled the tower wearing a high-visibility jacket and unfurling a banner in the process. Another incident happened a year later when a base jumper managed to get past site security and jumped off the Tower; he quickly ran off site after parachuting down. The tower was dedicated on 16 October 2005 and opened two days later. On opening day, the tower's project manager, David Greenhalgh, and representatives of Mowlem and Maspero were stranded in its malfunctioning external lift (built by Maspero) for an hour and a half. Abseiling engineers were called to rescue them. Some, including the franchise's chief executive, felt it was rather fitting that these particular people had been trapped. The external lift was removed during December 2012. Once open, the tower attracted crowds in excess of expectations, despite only the internal lift working, with more than 600,000 people visiting it in the first year. It is one of a number of observation towers around the world that have become popular, including Vancouver's Harbour Centre, Toronto's CN Tower, Blackpool's Tower, New York City's One World Trade Center (as well as the original Twin Towers) and Shanghai's Oriental Pearl Tower. In June 2006, the local press raised a concern that the tower might be forced to close. All public buildings in the UK require disabled access under the 1995 Disability Discrimination Act. With the external lift inoperative and only a single internal lift and stairs available as emergency escape routes, disabled people were not allowed to access the tower if they would be unable to use the stairs because a minimum of two escape routes are required by law. This problem was rectified by investing in an evacuation chair and training staff to use it. In the event of evacuation, should the internal lift be inoperable, those unable to navigate the 570 steps can use the evacuation chair. The Spinnaker Tower, being a landmark of southern England, features in the title sequence of the BBC South Today news programme. It also features on ITV News. In June 2009, the tower's operators succeeded in gaining permission for a freefall ride to be attached. As of 2015 this remains only a plan. In 2006, the tower won the RICS Project of the Year award and the RICS Regeneration award. Commercial sponsorship The tower being painted In May 2015, as part of a wider effort to \\"generate additional revenue by using the advertising potential of council-owned land and other assets\\", Portsmouth City Council proposed selling the tower's naming rights to a commercial sponsor. The proposed sponsorship deal would include the naming rights for the tower for at least five years, repainting and rebranding the tower in the sponsor's choice of colours and logos and new signage to be installed \\"no later than July 17\\" ahead of the 2015 America's Cup World Series. Dubai-based airline Emirates was reported to be the favoured sponsor, with the tower to be renamed as the Emirates Spinnaker Tower. On 5 June 2015, the city council confirmed that Emirates had been secured as the sponsor. Councillor Luke Stubbs said: \\"It's clearly a very good deal for the city and shows the benefit that Portsmouth is deriving from the America‚Äôs Cup... This also associates Portsmouth with a global brand and that can only be a good thing.\\" The tower was to be repainted in a red and white colour scheme‚Äîsimilar to that of local football rivals Southampton F.C.‚Äîas part of the rebranding but following a petition with over 10,000 signatures, Portsmouth City Council decided to rethink the change. Portsmouth City Council leader Donna Jones said: \\"We are working up a new design for the tower [which] will reflect the city‚Äôs heritage... I don‚Äôt want a tower in the city [that] no one likes the look of.\\" The new design, unveiled on 19 June 2015, featured a blue, gold and white colour scheme.

It was written by Angela Carter and Jordan. The film is based on the werewolf story of the same name in Angela Carter's 1979 short story collection The Bloody Chamber. Carter herself co-wrote the screenplay with Jordan, based on her own short story and her earlier adaptation of The Company of Wolves for radio. Carter's first draft of the screenplay, which contains some differences from the finished film, has been published in her anthology The Curious Room (1996). Plot The film begins in the present day, within a country house. A young girl named Rosaleen (Sarah Patterson) dreams that she lives in a fairytale forest during the late 18th century with her parents (Tusse Silberg and David Warner) and sister Alice (Georgia Slowe). But one night Alice is chased down and killed by wolves. While her parents are mourning, Rosaleen goes to stay with her grandmother (Angela Lansbury), who knits a bright red shawl for her granddaughter to wear. The superstitious old woman gives Rosaleen an ominous warning, to beware men whose eyebrows meet. Rosaleen returns to her village, but finds that she must deal with the advances of an amorous boy (Shane Johnstone). Rosaleen and the boy take a walk through the forest, but the boy discovers that the village's cattle have come under attack from a wolf. The villagers set out to hunt the wolf, but once caught and killed, the wolf's corpse transforms into that of a human being. Rosaleen later takes a basket of goods through the woods to her grandmother's cottage, but on her way she encounters an attractive huntsman (Micha Bergese), whose eyebrows meet. He challenges her, saying that he can find his way to her grandmother's house before she can, and the pair set off. The hunter arrives at Rosaleen's grandmother's house first, where he reveals his bestial nature and kills her. Rosaleen arrives later and discovers the carnage, but her need to protect herself is complicated by her desire for the hunter. In the ensuing exchange, Rosaleen accidentally injures the huntsman with his own rifle. Upon this blow, the hunter contorts in pain and transforms into his wolf shape. Rosaleen takes pity on the wounded beast, noting that his pack could leave him behind. She sits down, and begins petting the wolf kindly and tenderly while telling him a story. Ultimately the villagers arrive at the house some time later, looking for a werewolf within. Instead, they discover that Rosaleen herself has become a werewolf. Together, she and the huntsman escape to the forest, joined by a growing pack having chosen each other as mates. The wolves seem to stream into the real world, breaking into Rosaleen's house and gathering outside her bedroom. Rosaleen awakes with a scream as one leaps in through the window and sends her toys crashing to the floor, symbolizing the end of her childhood innocence. Perrault's Le Petit Chaperon Rouge is then heard being read, with the moral warning girls to beware of charming strangers. Granny's tales and Rosaleen's stories Throughout the course of the film, a number of stories are interspersed into the main narrative as tales told by several of the characters: * Granny's tale to Rosaleen‚ÄîA young groom (Stephen Rea) whose eyebrows meet is about to bed his new bride (Kathryn Pogson) when a \\"call of nature\\" summons him outside. He disappears and his bride is terrified to see wolves howling outside. A search the following day yields a wolf pawprint only. Years later, she remarries and has children, only to have her original husband finally return. Angered at her having children with a new husband, the groom transforms into his werewolf form, but is killed when the new husband (Jim Carter) returns. * Granny's second tale to Rosaleen‚ÄîA young man whose eyebrows meet, the bastard son of a priest, is walking through the enchanted forest when he encounters the Devil (Terence Stamp), anachronistically arriving in a Rolls-Royce chauffeured by the actress playing Rosaleen in a blonde wig. The Devil offers the boy a transformative potion, which he rubs onto his chest, causing hair to sprout rapidly. The boy is pleased, but shortly thereafter vines grow swiftly from the ground, twining around his legs and trapping him. He wails in protest and fear, his face distorting with his cries. His anguished visage appearing in Rosaleen's bedroom mirror at the end of that dream sequence. * Rosaleen's story to her mother‚ÄîA woman (Dawn Archibald) who lived in a valley \\"done a terrible wrong\\" by a rich, young nobleman (Richard Morant) turns up visibly pregnant at his wedding party \\"to put wrong to right\\". She calls out the nobleman and the rest of the nobles for their bigoted actions, and further denounces them by declaring \\"the wolves in the forest are more decent\\". She then reveals that she is a witch and magically transforms the groom, the bride, and the other nobles into wolves. They flee into the forest as the witch laughs, but afterwards the witch commands that the wolves \\"serenade\\" her and her child each night. * Rosaleen's story to the huntsman/wolf‚ÄîA she-wolf from the world beneath arrives at a village. Despite meaning no harm, she is shot by a villager. She reveals herself in her human form (Danielle Dax) to an old priest (Graham Crowden), who takes her in and bandages her wound. Although touched by the priest's kindness and actions, she feels that she is not fit to stay. Ultimately, after some time, she returns to her world through the village well.

This was Carter's first experience of writing for film. However, it was also only Jordan's second feature film as director. Whilst ultimately based upon the short story of the same name from The Bloody Chamber, the plot of the film bears closer resemblance to Angela Carter's 1980 adaptation of \\"The Company of Wolves\\" for radio, which introduced such elements as the additional stories being told within the narrative by the characters themselves, such as Granny. Originally, these stories had been placed before the main narrative. Carter and Jordan met in Dublin in 1982 to discuss extending Carter's radio drama adaptation of her own story, which Jordan called \\"too short for a feature film\\".Neil Jordan quoted in the production notes to Angela Carter's The Curious Room (London: Vintage, 1997), p 507. In an L.A. Weekly interview published to correspond with the film's US debut, Jordan said: \\"In a normal film you have a story with different movements that program, develop, go a little bit off the trunk, come back, and end. In this film, the different movements of the plot are actually separate stories. You start with an introduction and then move into different stories that relate to the main theme, all building to the fairy tale that everybody knows. The opening element of the dreamer gave us the freedom to move from story to story.\\" According to Jordan, it was he who suggested adding the frame story to the narrative: that of the dreaming girl Rosaleen in the modern day. This makes clear the story's focus on subconscious fears and desires. It also gives the film what Jordan called \\"a Chinese box structure.\\" This structure was supposedly based upon the structure of the film The Saragossa Manuscript, which both Jordan and Carter had seen. The script reached its third draft by July 1983.Mark Bell, production notes to Angela Carter's The Curious Room (London: Vintage, 1997), p 507. Carter's proposed ending for the film would have featured Rosaleen diving into the floor of her bedroom and being swallowed up as by water. In the DVD commentary for the film, Jordan notes that the limited technology of the time prevented the production of such a sequence, whereas later CGI effects would in fact make it quite simple.Neil Jordan, audio commentary to The Company of Wolves (ITC, 1984), (DVD: 2005). The original screenplay (as presented in The Curious Room) also featured an additional story being told by the huntsman, a very different final tale by Rosaleen (reminiscent of Carter's \\"Peter and the Wolf\\" from her collection Black Venus) and a scene set in a church with an animal congregation.Angela Carter, \\"The Company of Wolves\\" in The Curious Room (London: Vintage, 1997), p 185-244. The budget was provided by ITC Distributors. Principal photography The Company of Wolves was filmed in Shepperton Studios in England. The film's cast was primarily made up of British actors. Sarah Patterson made her screen debut, despite being much younger than the kind of actress the casting director had been looking for, and likely too young to understand some of the film's more adult concepts. Her youth also meant having to make special arrangements with her school in order for her to be away for nine weeks while shooting took place.Anonymous, \\"The Company of Wolves Behind the Scenes Dossier\\" (2005; insert with special edition DVD). Northern Irish actor Stephen Rea had already worked with director Neil Jordan in Angel and would later work with him again in The Crying Game, Interview with the Vampire and Breakfast on Pluto, amongst others. Jordan worked for several weeks in pre-production with artist filmmakers Nichola Bruce and Michael Coulson to create hundreds of detailed storyboard drawings. Also involved with production was production designer Anton Furst and his draftsman Nigel Phelps, who would later go on to work on Tim Burton's Batman. The film's visuals were of particular importance, as Jordan explains: > The visual design was an integral part of the script. It was written and > imagined with a heightened sense of reality in mind. In the DVD commentary, Jordan notes the difficulty of having to create the look of the film on a limited budget, having to create a fairytale forest out of essentially \\"twelve trees\\". He nevertheless succeeded in creating a sunless, mystical, wondrous and claustrophobic setting saturated with fantastic elements and symbols. The script calls for a great number of wolves to appear. Due to budgetary constraints and other factors such as cast safety, most of the 'wolves' shown in the film are in fact evidently Belgian Shepherd Dogs, mainly Terveurens and Groenendals, whose fur was specially dyed. In the DVD commentary for the film, Jordan notes the bravery of young star Sarah Patterson when acting amongst the genuine wolves. Using particular light angles, the eyes of both real and \\"shepherd\\" wolves are made to glow dramatically in the film. Jordan notes how Carter was \\"thrilled with the process\\" of making a film, as she \\"had never really been involved with one.\\" After the film, Jordan and Carter looked for other projects which they could work on together. However, no others came to fruition, partly because of Carter's later illness. According to Jordan, he and Carter discussed a possible adaptation of Vampirella, Carter's radio play which served as the original version of her short story \\"The Lady of the House of Love\\" from The Bloody Chamber. This is not to be confused with the actual film Vampirella, released in 1996 and based upon the comic book character of the same name. Release The film received its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival in Canada on 15 September 1984. It was released in the United Kingdom on 21 September and was released in the United States on 19 April 1985 where it was shown in 995 theatres. Distribution The film was distributed in the United States by Cannon Films. Jordan notes that Cannon pushed the concept of the film as primarily a horror film. Jordan maintains that it is not a horror film and that such a label might actually be misleading to audiences. Home video The film was later released on VHS in numerous countries. A Region 1 DVD release came several years later on 15 October 2002. A Region 2 special edition version of the film was released on 17 October 2005, approximately 20 years after the film's initial release in theatres. This special edition came in a metal case and included an audio commentary by director Neil Jordan, stills galleries, the film's theatrical trailer and a printed \\"Behind the Scenes Dossier\\". This special edition version was also released on Universal Media Disc for the Sony PlayStation Portable on 30 January 2006. The film was released on Blu-ray in 2007 in United Kingdom by ITV. Reception=Critical response Feminist critic Maggie Anwell decried the film for its over-emphasis on bloody werewolf special effects,Anwell, Maggie (1988), 'Lolita Meets the Werewolf: The Company of Wolves‚Äô in Lorraine Gamman and Margaret Marshment (eds), The Female Gaze: Women as Viewers of Popular Culture, London: Women‚Äôs Press, pp. 76‚Äì85. but another, Charlotte Crofts, argues that the film is a sensitive adaptation of Carter's reworking of Charles Perrault's Little Red Riding Hood fairy tale.Crofts, Charlotte (1999), 'Curiously Downbeat Hybrid or Radical Retelling?: Neil Jordan's and Angela Carter's The Company of Wolves‚Äô in Cartmell, Hunter, Kaye and Whelehan (eds), Sisterhoods Across the Literature / Media Divide (London and Sterling, Virginia: Pluto Press), pp 48‚Äì63; Crofts, Charlotte (2003), Anagrams of Desire: Angela Carter's Writing for Radio, Film and Television (Manchester University Press). In April 1985, upon the film's US debut, Roger Ebert gave the film three stars out of four, and called it a \\"disturbing and stylish attempt to collect some of the nightmares that lie beneath the surface of \\"Little Red Riding Hood.\\" Years later, Louise Watson, writing for BFI Screenonline, said Neil Jordan \\"evokes an eerie, dreamlike atmosphere for the film's heightened reality. Its otherworldly scenery and costumes seem to have been inspired by fairytale illustrations, mixed with the studio-bound visual style of Hammer horror. The Hammer-like theatrical forest creates a sense of brooding claustrophobia where no sunlight can reach, accentuating Rosaleen's trapped existence. An intensely visual film, teeming with rich symbolism and imagery, the BAFTA-winning settings and special effects dominate the film, often at the expense of the (perhaps deliberately) underdeveloped characters.\\" On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 80% based on , with a weighted average rating of 6.61/10. Box office performance Financially, the film only just broke even on its opening weekend in the US, having been made for approximately $2 million and taking $2,234,776 in 995 theatres. However, in total, the film took over $4 million in the US Awards and nominations Critics generally responded especially positively to the film's aesthetics. The film won one award for best film and best special effects at the 1985 International Fantasy Film Awards and was nominated for four BAFTAs for costume design, make up, production design/art direction and special visual effects.

Football career Born in Hurlford to James and Jessie Turnbull of 1 Gibson Street, Kilmarnock, Ayrshire, Turnbull started his football career with his hometown club, Hurlford Thistle. He later moved to Manchester City. In 1905, City was found guilty of malpractice relating to payments of its players, and the entire squad was suspended from playing football. When the ban was lifted on 31 December 1906, Turnbull moved to City's crosstown rivals Manchester United, along with Billy Meredith, Herbert Burgess and Jimmy Bannister. His first game for United came on the next day, 1 January 1907, against Aston Villa. Along with Meredith, he helped the club to their first championship in 1908 and the 1909 FA Cup, scoring the only goal in the final, against Bristol City. In 1908 alone, he would score 27 goals in 25 games. On 19 February 1909, Turnbull scored the first ever goal at Old Trafford, in a 4‚Äì3 loss against Liverpool. He would go on to score 100 goals for the club in 245 games. His final game for the Reds came against Sheffield United in 1915. Military career Turnbull enlisted in the 23rd Battalion of the Middlesex Regiment (2nd Football) during the First World War before being transferred to the 8th Battalion of the East Surrey Regiment. After being promoted to the rank of lance-sergeant, Turnbull was killed during the Battle of Arras on 3 May 1917 aged 32. Turnbull's body, if recovered, was never identified. He is commemorated on the Arras memorial. Match fixing Turnbull received a lifelong ban from football in 1915 along with several others players after being found guilty of match-fixing. He was posthumously re-instated in 1919. Family Turnbull was married and had four children. Two of Turnbull's sons, Alexander Jr. and Ronald, signed amateur forms with Manchester United in August 1932, but neither managed to follow in their father's footsteps and they were released before making an appearance for the club.

May 1895 in Klein Jenkwitz; ‚Ä† 3. October 1977 in Dresden) was a German press photographer and photojournalist. He is best known for his photographs of Dresden just after the end of World War II. Richard Peter was born and raised in Klein Jenkwitz, Silesia, working as a smith and a miner while dabbling in photography. He was drafted into the German army in 1914 to serve in World War I. After the war he settled in Halle and later in Dresden. He joined the labor movement and the Communist Party of Germany. During the 1920s and early 1930s he published his photographs in various left-wing publications. Because of this he was promptly barred from working as a press photographer when the Nazi Party rose to power in 1933. During the Third Reich he worked in advertising, before being drafted again to serve in World War II. Peter returned to Dresden in September 1945 to find the city destroyed after the bombing of Dresden in February 1945. His personal archive and equipment had been completely destroyed in the raids. Starting over with borrowed equipment, he began to document the damage to the city and the beginnings of its reconstruction. His photographs were published in 1949 in a volume called Dresden, eine Kamera klagt an (\\"Dresden, a photographic accusation\\", ). In 1949 Peter was expelled from the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, the successor of the Communist Party, when he investigated corrupt party officials. He continued to work as a freelance art photographer in Dresden until his death in 1977, and eventually won some international recognition for his work. Peter's more than 5,000 negatives and prints were acquired by the Saxon State Library in 1983.

Consisting of previously unreleased material, it was recorded with The Stray Gators on the support tour following 1972's highly successful Harvest. Due to Young's dissatisfaction with the tour, it was omitted from his catalogue and not released on CD until 2017. Nevertheless, Time Fades Away received much critical praise and was widely pirated after lapsing out of print because of the ensuing demand from fans. It was initially reissued on vinyl only as part of the Official Release Series Discs 5-8 Vinyl Box Set for Record Store Day in 2014. The album finally saw an official CD release in August 2017 as part of the CD version of the boxset. It was also made available as a digital download for purchase through the PonoMusicWorld website (closed), the iTunes store and Qobuz. In 2020 it is available on streaming platforms such as Spotify, Deezer and Apple Music. History Though \\"Love in Mind\\" dates from a 1971 solo tour, all other songs on the album are from the Harvest tour in early 1973. The program featured an acoustic solo set followed by an electric set with The Stray Gators. Longtime collaborator and former Crazy Horse guitarist Danny Whitten had been set to join the Gators as a second guitarist before being sent home from rehearsals after it became evident that he was in no condition to embark on the rigorous tour. He succumbed to a fatal combination of Valium and alcohol on the night following his dismissal.Michael St. John. Downtown: The Danny Whitten Story. Self-published 2012. Unlike Young's previous ensembles, The Stray Gators consisted of notable Nashville and Los Angeles session musicians; keyboardist Jack Nitzsche was the only member of the group who had worked with Young prior to Harvest. During the rehearsals, drummer Kenneth Buttrey demanded a salary of $100,000 (roughly $571,000 in 2017) to compensate for lost session work, leading Nitzsche (with support from Tim Drummond) to prevail upon the singer to extend this salary to the other band members. Although Young reluctantly acquiesced, Nitzsche would later reflect that \\"Neil got so pissed off ... I don't think things ever recovered after that.\\" In the wake of the relatively dulcet Harvest, audiences did not always react positively to the new songs, many of which were emblematic of the Gators' raucous and heavily electrified live sound. Struggling to cope with Whitten's death, Young lambasted band members' performances following concerts and scheduled soundchecks that were often cancelled on short notice. Such behavior frustrated Buttrey, who left the band and was immediately replaced by former Turtles/Jefferson Airplane percussionist Johnny Barbata. Having previously stepped in to replace Dallas Taylor on Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young's 1970 tour, Barbata ultimately performed on all of the Stray Gators selections on the album. At the instigation of Drummond, Young also developed a penchant for tequila, with the singer later remarking that \\"it does something else to me than alcohol usually does.\\" Other band members performed erratically: according to producer Elliot Mazer, Jack Nitzsche would often spew obscenities into his switched-off vocal microphone, while pedal steel/dobro player Ben Keith was so inebriated at one soundcheck that he could not recall the key of \\"Don't Be Denied\\", a song slated for the album. Following the loss of a pickup on his signature Old Black (a heavily modified 1953 Gibson Les Paul Goldtop), Young switched to a Gibson Flying V; according to Young, the guitar \\"wouldn't stay in tune\\" and had other problems. Biographer Jimmy McDonough has characterized Young's performances on the instrument as \\"the worst guitar playing of his career.\\" Alcohol abuse and strained singing would lead the singer to develop a throat infection in the final days of the tour. In a partial reunion of CSNY, Young hired David Crosby and Graham Nash to augment the harmonies and play rhythm guitar. Despite their integration, the band's repertoire remained confined to Young originals. Moreover, clashes among The Stray Gators continued, with Nitzsche complaining that he couldn't hear himself playing because Crosby's 12-string electric guitar overpowered the sound mix. Following sixty-two concerts over three months, the tour ended at the Salt Palace in Salt Lake City on April 3, 1973. Recording Time Fades Away was recorded directly from the soundboard to 16-track and mixed simultaneous to LP cutting using the Quad-Eight Compumix. While no master tape was created in the traditional sense, stereo tapes were in fact created while cutting to enable future remastering. Release Time Fades Away was released on October 15, 1973. The album reached #22 on the Billboard Charts, and quickly achieved gold status, selling over 1 million copies in both the US and UK. It was issued on vinyl, cassette and 8-track. The album's title track was briefly released as a single, with the B-side of \\"Last Trip to Tulsa\\", a live version of the song also taken from the Time Fades Away tour and unavailable anywhere else.

Reception Upon its release, Time Fades Away received positive reviews from Rolling Stone,Rolling Stone article: \\"1/time_fades_away Neil Young: Time Fades Away: Music Reviews.\\" The New York Times, and Robert Christgau of The Village Voice.Robert Christgau's official website: \\"Neil Young reviews.\\" In more recent years, it has been rated highly by AllMusic,AllMusic article: \\"[ Time Fades Away: Overview].\\" sputnikmusic,sputnikmusic article: \\"Time Fades Away review.\\" and Blurt Online.Blurt Online article: \\"Time Fades Away review \\" R.E.M. has cited Time Fades Away as a source of inspiration for New Adventures in Hi-Fi. On December 31, 2013, Widespread Panic played the following three songs from Time Fades Away: \\"Journey Through The Past\\", \\"Don't Be Denied\\", and \\"Time Fades Away\\" at a concert in Atlanta. Young's appraisal Neil Young commented on Time Fades Away in the original, unreleased liner notes for his 1977 triple-album compilation Decade: In 1987, Young told an interviewer that Time Fades Away was \\"the worst record I ever made ‚Äì but as a documentary of what was happening to me, it was a great record. I was onstage and I was playing all these songs that nobody had heard before, recording them, and I didn't have the right band. It was just an uncomfortable tour. I felt like a product, and I had this band of all-star musicians that couldn't even look at each other.\\"Thrasher's Wheat page: \\"Time Fades Away by Neil Young\\".Shakey by Jimmy McDonough, pp. 391. Young has rarely played songs from Time Fades Away live. \\"Don't Be Denied\\" was included in the 1974 CSN&Y; tour. In July 2008, he performed the record's title track at a concert in Oberhausen, Germany.Sugar Mountain page: \\"Neil Young ‚Äì 2008 setlists .\\" A 2014 documentary on Young was also named Don't Be Denied. Reissues Time Fades Away long remained the only officially released Neil Young album unavailable on compact disc. Young had often cited his unfavorable memories of the tour as the main reason that the record has not been reissued. In the mid-1990s, plans were made to release the album on CD using the HDCD encoding; several test pressings were made, and a release date of November 7, 1995 was announced. However, the CD release was shelved for unknown reasons.Side Street Records page: \\"Unreleased Neil Young compact discs 1988‚Äì1995.\\" In early 2007, Young's management reiterated that there were no plans to release the album on CD. Pristine vinyl copies are still available in used stores and on eBay, often with the fold-out liner notes still intact; some CDs from the 1995 test pressings exist, and copies of these CDs are circulated as bootlegs. Additionally, some fans have made CDs from the more readily available vinyl copies. In 2014, Young released a limited edition box set of vinyl records that includes the original Time Fades Away along with On the Beach, Tonight's the Night, and Zuma. From December of 2014, Young's first 14 albums, including Time Fades Away, were released as high-resolution downloads via the Pono digital music service, HDTracks and Qobuz. The album finally saw an official CD release in August 2017 as part of the CD version of Official Release Series Discs 5-8 boxset; unlike the vinyl reissue, it's not available to buy separately. In 2020 Time Fades Away is available on streaming platforms such as Spotify, Deezer and Apple Music. It is also available for streaming and download in high resolution audio on Young's Archives website. Time Fades Away II and Tuscaloosa In October 2009, Young told Guitar World that a disc titled Time Fades Away II will be included in the second volume of the Archives box set series, noting: \\"It's interesting because [Time Fades Away II] has a different drummer than what was on that album. Kenny Buttrey was in there for the first half, and Johnny Barbata came in for the second. It's a completely different thing, with completely different songs.\\"Guitar World interview with Neil Young. In January 2019, in an interview with Rolling Stone, Young mentioned the upcoming release of Tuscaloosa, a live album featuring the February 5th, 1973 show at Tuscaloosa, Alabama from the tour. The album was released on June 7, 2019. Young has since stated on his Archives website that Tuscaloosa is \\"as close as Time Fades Away II that we'll get\\".

(1990). Pinaceae. Drawings and Descriptions of the Genera. Koeltz Scientific Books . This species is also known as yellow spruce, West Virginia spruce, eastern spruce, and he-balsam.  Description  Foliage and cones Red spruce is a perennial, shade-tolerant, late successional coniferous tree that under optimal conditions grows to tall with a trunk diameter of about , though exceptional specimens can reach tall and in diameter. It has a narrow conical crown. The leaves are needle-like, yellow-green, long, four-sided, curved, with a sharp point, and extend from all sides of the twig. The bark is gray-brown on the surface and red-brown on the inside, thin, and scaly. The wood is light, soft, has narrow rings, and has a slight red tinge. The cones are cylindrical, long, with a glossy red- brown color and stiff scales. The cones hang down from branches.  Habitat  Dense red spruce forest in its native habitat at the summit of Spruce Knob, West Virginia Red spruce grows at a slow to moderate rate, lives for 250 to 450+ years, and is very shade-tolerant when young.http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/~adk/oldlisteast/#spp It is often found in pure stands or forests mixed with eastern white pine, balsam fir, or black spruce. Along with Fraser fir, red spruce is one of two primary tree types in the southern Appalachian spruce-fir forest, a distinct ecosystem found only in the highest elevations of the Southern Appalachian Mountains. Its habitat is moist but well-drained sandy loam, often at high altitudes. Red spruce can be easily damaged by windthrow and acid rain. Notable red spruce forests can be seen at Gaudineer Scenic Area, a virgin red spruce forest located in West Virginia, the Canaan Valley, Roaring Plains West Wilderness, Dolly Sods Wilderness, Spruce Mountain and Spruce Knob all also in West Virginia and all sites of former extensive red spruce forest. Some areas of this forest, particularly in Roaring Plains West Wilderness, Dolly Sods Wilderness as well as areas of Spruce Mountain are making a rather substantial recovery.  Related species  It is closely related to black spruce, and hybrids between the two are frequent where their ranges meet. Genetic data suggests that the red spruce peripatrically speciated from the black spruce during the Pleistocene due to glaciation.  Uses  Red spruce is used for Christmas trees and is an important wood used in making paper pulp. It is also an excellent tonewood, and is used in many higher-end acoustic guitars and violins, as well as musical soundboard. The sap can be used to make spruce gum. Leafy red spruce twigs are boiled with sugar and flavoring to make spruce beer. Also it can be made into spruce pudding. It can also be used as construction lumber and is good for millwork and for crates. Red spruce is the provincial tree of Nova Scotia. Red spruce cones from the Pisgah National Forest  Damaging factors  Like most trees, red spruce is subject to insect parasitism. Their insect enemy is the spruce budworm, although it is a bigger problem for white spruce and balsam fir. Other issues that have been damaging red spruce has been the increase in acid rain and current climate change. One of the consequences of acid rain deposition is the decrease of soil exchangeable calcium and increase of aluminum. This is because acid precipitation disrupts cation and nutrition cycling in forest ecosystems. Components of acid rain such as H+, NO3‚àí, and SO42- limit the uptake of calcium by trees and can increase aluminum availability. Calcium concentration is important for red spruce for physiological processes such as dark respiration and cold tolerance, as well as disease resistance, signal transduction, membrane and cell wall synthesis and function, and regulation of stomata. Conversely, dissolved aluminum can be toxic or can interfere with root uptake of calcium and other nutrients. At the ecosystem and community levels, Calcium availability is associated with community composition, mature tree growth, and ecosystem productivity. One study testing the effects of added aluminum to soil, found that P. rubens mortality rate increased under these conditions. During the 1980s, increased acid deposition contributed to a loss of high-elevation red spruce trees, due to leached calcium and decreased freezing tolerance. Additionally, the structure of the spruce needle enhances the capture of water and particles, which has been shown to add to soil acidification, nutrient leaching, and forest decline. However, more recently, reductions in acid deposition have contributed to red spruce resurgence in some mountain areas in the northeastern United States. This increase in red spruce growth has been associated with an increase in rainfall pH, which reduces bulk acidic deposition. This suggests that policies aiming to reduce atmospheric pollution in this area have been effective, although other species sensitive to soil acidification, such as sugar maple, are still continuing to decline.  Conservation  The Central Appalachian Spruce Restoration Initiative (CASRI) seeks to unite diverse partners with the goal of restoring historic red spruce ecosystems across the high-elevation landscapes of central Appalachians. The partners that make up this diverse group are Appalachian Mountain Joint Venture, Appalachian Regional Reforestation Initiative, Canaan Valley National Wildlife Refuge, Natural Resources Conservation Service, The Mountain Institute, The Nature Conservancy, Trout Unlimited, U.S. Forest Service Northern Research Station, U.S. Forest Service Monongahela National Forest, West Virginia Division of Natural Resources, West Virginia Division of Forestry, West Virginia Highlands Conservancy, West Virginia State Parks, and West Virginia University. Prior to the late 1800s, of red spruce were in West Virginia. In the late 1800s and early 1900s, a vast amount of logging began in the state and the number of red spruce dwindled to . Silviculture is being used to help restore the population of the lost red spruce. Significant efforts have been made to increase the growth of red spruce trees in western North Carolina. Most notably by Molly Tartt on behalf of the Daughters of the American Revolution. Tartt, a resident of Brevard North Carolina, embarked on a mission to find the lost red spruce Pisgah Forest that had been planted by the DAR as a memorial to the lives lost during the American Revolution. The forest, consisting of 50,000 trees was dedicated in 1940 and had until recently been forgotten until Tartt located and identified the forest.

It originally started in 1976, and for many years was based at the London Astoria. History G-A-Y originally began in 1976 in the Sundown club in the basement of the London Astoria (later LA2) as a Monday night event called Bang!. It was started by club promoters Norman Scott, Damien Tony and Jerry Collins, who worked as a DJ under the name Gary London. During the 1980s, Bang! (which had by then also expanded to Saturday night) and Propaganda (Thursday night) were run by gay club promoter and DJ Colin Peters (Peter Daubeney), whose brother Jamie continued as promoter for a period following his death. In the early 1990s, Bang! was acquired by DJ and promoter Jeremy Joseph, formerly employed by Peters, who oversaw its change of name to G-A-Y. At this point, G-A-Y expanded further from two nights a week to four, hosting at the LA2 on Mondays and Thursdays and the London Astoria on Fridays and Saturdays. It operated from the London Astoria music venue for 15 years until July 2008. The Boston Globe described it as \\"London's largest gay-themed club night\\", NME reported that it \\"attracts 6,000 clubbers each week\\", and The Independent described it as \\"the one London gig that really matters\\" for \\"today's pop stars\\". G-A-Y is associated with G-A-Y Bar and G-A-Y Late. A major stake in the brand was bought on 13 August 2007 by the MAMA Group. On Friday 3 October 2008, G-A-Y moved to the famous gay venue Heaven, which MAMA Group had acquired a few weeks earlier on 22 September 2008. The G-A-Y Album In 2000, a 40 track compilation album was released, featuring songs from some of the artists who had appeared at G-A-Y. A promotional campaign took place in the weeks leading up to release, including television and radio advertisements, a nationwide poster campaign and magazine advertisements in both the gay and teen press. On Saturday 1 July 2000, a show was held at G-A-Y to promote the release of the album. Seven acts who appeared on the album performed. These acts were Shola Ama, All Saints, Bananarama, Dina Carroll, Billie Piper, Honeyz and Louise. Each act performed only one song, apart from Louise, who also performed her new single \\"2 Faced\\". The G-A-Y album was released on Monday 3 July 2000 and peaked at number 18 in the UK compilations chart. G-A-Y brand The G-A-Y brand has expanded to two other bars in the same area: G-A-Y Late (located near the former Astoria site) and G-A-Y bar (located nearby in Soho's Old Compton Street). In April 2011, the G-A-Y brand arrived in Manchester's Canal Street gay village, with a G-A-Y bar opening in the former venue of Spirit Bar. The brand is now 100% owned by Jeremy Joseph.  Controversies  The current owner of G-A-Y, Jeremy Joseph, has attracted criticism at various points. On one such occasion, staff refused disabled comedian Rosie Jones - who has cerebral palsy - entry into one of his nightclubs. This was followed by a swift apology on Twitter; however, many other commentators came forth to comment on the policies of the club in the same article, stating that Joseph had denied entry to those who he thought were 'too old' or 'not gay'. In 2011, Joseph tweeted that straight people were not welcome to a One Direction gig at his London venue, stating: \\"My birthday wish is for little girls to realise that G-A-Y is a lesbian and gay club so there's only one direction and that‚Äôs no direction for them\\". Joseph was also embroiled in a scandal in which he was accused of racism by some social media users after blaming crime in Soho on 'Somalians'. Joseph apologised for his outbursts, but many commented that as a proponent of LGBT inclusivity, his own views on race were questionable, if not outright offensive.  Performances  Saturday nights at G-A-Y/Heaven have seen many performances from a wide selection of artists and genres. Acts to have appeared in the G-A-Y/Heaven include: *Anastacia *B*Witched *Britney Spears *Ellie Goulding *Fifth Harmony *Kylie Minogue *Lady Gaga *Little Mix *Madonna *Marina and the Diamonds *McFly *Olly Murs *One Direction *The Human League *The Wanted *Steps See also *Heaven (nightclub) *London Astoria  References External links *G-A-Y website Category:LGBT nightclubs in London Category:Music venues in London ","title":"G-A-Y"},{"id":"1495749","text":"Wolf Vladimir Vishniac (April 22, 1922 - December 10, 1973) was an American microbiologist.

Before 1964, she was frequently billed as Arline Sax or Arlene Sax. Casting directors, among other Hollywood insiders, called Martel the Chameleon because her appearance and her proficiency with accents and dialects enabled her to portray characters of a wide range of races and ethnicities. Early life Martel was born Arline Greta Sax on April 14, 1936 in The Bronx. She was the daughter of Austrian Jewish immigrants. Martel attended the Performing Arts High School in New York, on which the movie Fame was based, graduating in 1953. She later studied method acting and was a member of The Actors Studio. Career Martel was billed as \\"Arline Sax\\" during the early years of her television career. Two of her earliest appearances were in The Twilight Zone TV series. The first was the episode \\"What You Need\\" as a woman in the bar. The second was the episode \\"Twenty Two\\", as a nurse who repeatedly utters the sinister phrase \\"Room for one more, Honey!\\" at the entrance to a hospital morgue and at the door of a doomed airplane. Martel appeared in a 1960 episode of The Rebel, \\"The Hunted\\", in which she had a scene with Leonard Nimoy, before they were reunited in an iconic episode of Star Trek. She was also featured in two 1961 episodes of Route 66: \\"Legacy for Lucia\\", in which she had the title role of a Sicilian girl who inherits an American soldier's estate, and \\"The Newborn\\", in which she played a mother who dies in childbirth. She appeared in an episode of the TV series Hong Kong in 1961, opposite Rod Taylor. In 1962, she made the first of two appearances on Perry Mason, as Fiona Cregan in \\"The Case of the Absent Artist\\". In 1966 she guest-starred as Sandra Dunkel in \\"The Case of the Dead Ringer\\", in which, aside from his role as Mason, Raymond Burr played the murderer, Grimes. Other roles includes the princess Sarafina on Have Gun ‚Äì Will Travel, the evil witch Malvina on Bewitched, the French Resistance contact Tiger in five episodes of Hogan's Heroes (1965‚Äì71), a female cosmonaut on I Dream of Jeannie, and a Hungarian immigrant on The Fugitive episode \\"The Blessings of Liberty\\" (1966). Martel's best-known science fiction roles were in The Outer Limits episode \\"Demon with a Glass Hand\\" (1964) and in the Star Trek episode \\"Amok Time\\" (1967) as the scheming and duplicitous, but extremely logical, T'Pring, Mr. Spock's \\"wife\\", who is expected to become his consort. On Columbo, Martel played Gloria West, mistress of murder victim Tony Goodland (Bradford Dillman), in season 2, episode 2, \\"The Greenhouse Jungle\\" (1972), and the Salesgirl in the episode \\"A Friend in Deed\\" (1974). In 1974, she was billed as \\"Tasha Martelle\\" for the role of secretary Marty Bach in The Rockford Files episode \\"Trouble in Chapter 17.\\" She appeared as a featured actress in the Gunsmoke episode \\"The Squaw\\" (1975). Other shows on which Martel appeared included The Man from U.N.C.L.E., The Untouchables, Mission: Impossible, Here Come the Brides, The Wild Wild West, Battlestar Galactica, The Monkees, Mannix, and The Six Million Dollar Man. Martel also appeared in feature films, including Angels from Hell (1968) and Chatterbox (1977). She received top billing as the commandant in charge of a Russian road crew in Zoltan, Hound of Dracula (1978), although it was only a bit part, lasting less than five minutes. Martel semi-retired from acting in the mid-1980s, but continued to act sporadically. She appeared in several TV episodes and some unsold TV pilots in the early 2000s. She said that even in her early career, she got most of her work by word of mouth, not through talent agents. In her later years, she often said, \\"I don't have a good agent who will get me the plum roles.\\" Late-life roles included a Vulcan priestess in the Star Trek fan film \\"Of Gods and Men\\" in a scene with her \\"Amok Time\\" suitor Lawrence Montaigne reprising his role as Stonn, and as one of the narrators of the 2015 documentary film Unity, which was released a year after her death. Personal life and death Martel married and divorced three times. Her first marriage was to Robert Palmer, with whom she had one son, Adam Palmer. Her second marriage was to actor Jerry Douglas, with whom she had two children, Avra Douglas and journalist and designer Jod Kaftan. Her third marriage was to Matthew Schoen. She had three grandchildren. In her later years, Martel wrote a screenplay, Whisper Into My Good Ear, based on William Hanley's one-act play of the same title. She began work on a second screenplay, Mrs. Dally Has a Lover, also based on a Hanley play. Neither was produced. Martel was a regular at Star Trek conventions worldwide from 1972 to 2014. Her last convention appearance was at TrekTrax Atlanta in Atlanta, Georgia, on April 25‚Äì27, 2014, four months before her death. Martel battled breast cancer for the last five years of her life. On August 12, 2014, she died from heart bypass surgical complications at a hospital in Santa Monica, California. She was 78.

Shire to County to City  The entire area of South Hampton Roads was part of Elizabeth River Shire when it was formed in 1634. From this original shire (or county), in 1636, New Norfolk County was formed, which was divided again into Upper and Lower Norfolk counties in 1637. Lower Norfolk County was split in 1691 to form Princess Anne County and Norfolk County. The Ocean View area was to remain part of Norfolk County for over 225 years, until it and the adjacent Willoughby Spit area were annexed by the independent City of Norfolk in 1923. (Virginia has had independent city political subdivisions since 1871). A small portion of East Ocean View adjacent to the Little Creek Amphibious Base was added in a land-swap with the city of Virginia Beach in 1988.  Ocean View City: Trolleys, Famous Amusement Park  The area which became known as Ocean View City was originally a 360-acre (1.5 km) tract called the Magagnos Plantation which had extensive frontage on the Chesapeake Bay east of Willoughby Spit and west of Little Creek. The Ocean View area was surveyed and laid out with streets and lots as Ocean View City in 1854 by William Mahone, a young civil engineer who was building the Norfolk and Petersburg Railroad.

Taylor, about 30 years later, a narrow gauge steam passenger railroad service was established between Norfolk and Ocean View, a 9-mile long linehttp://www.norfolkhistory.com/ngnovrrdescrip.htm crossing what was then known as Tanner's Creek (later renamed Lafayette River). Originally named the Ocean View Railroad, it was later known as the Norfolk and Ocean View Railroad.http://www.norfolkhistory.com/ngnovrrdescrip.htm A small steam locomotive named the General William B. Mahone hauled ever increasing volumes of passengers, primarily on the weekends. The steam service was later replaced by electric-powered trolley cars, becoming both a popular resort and a streetcar suburb of the City of Norfolk. Initially, the improvements consisted of the swimming beach and cottages. The location was quite popular for Sunday outings from Norfolk. The popular Nansemond Hotel was built about 1928; it was destroyed in a fire in 1980.UPI Archives - Landmark Hotel Burned to Ground, 11/24/1980 With the advent of additional electric streetcars in the late 19th century, an amusement park was developed at the end-of-the-line and a boardwalk was built along the adjacent beach area. These were a favorite of sailors on leave from the Norfolk Navy Base. Buses replaced the streetcars in the late 1940s. In the mid 20th century, for a number of years, AM radio station WGH broadcast live from a booth under the roller coaster. Completion of the Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel in 1957 connected the Ocean View area to the Virginia Peninsula. However, it and other newer highways encouraged visitors to continue on to the Virginia Beach resort area on the Atlantic Ocean, a small city which boomed after merging with Princess Anne County in 1963. In particular, construction of nearby Interstate 64 and the Virginia Beach Expressway (now part of Interstate 264) made it easier for tourists from afar to bypass Ocean View en route to the Oceanfront area of Virginia Beach.  Decline, Reemergence  After several years of decline in the 1970s, during which Busch Gardens in Williamsburg opened less than an hour's drive away, Ocean View Amusement Park was closed after Labor Day, 1978 and was torn down soon after the filming of a 1979 made-for-TV movie called The Death of Ocean View Park, which starred Mike Connors of Mannix fame, Barry Newman, and Academy Award winner Martin Landau. A key scene featured blowing up the landmark wooden roller coaster \\"The Rocket\\". While there had been popular concern as to the structural integrity of the famous but aged wooden structure, early attempts to film its destruction with explosives met with failure. Finally, on the third attempt, and with a bulldozer off camera helping to pull the structure down, the landmark appeared to explode in a large fireball. Also, the 1977 movie Rollercoaster (with Timothy Bottoms), George Segal, Henry Fonda, and Richard Widmark, features \\"The Rocket\\", as well as other shots of the park in the opening sequences. In the early 21st century, as the entire coastal property market surged with new growth, redevelopment in the Ocean View community has resulted in new upscale residential properties replacing old beach cottages and small motels along the resort strip. Property values, especially bay front property, particularly in the East Beach neighborhood, have increased significantly in value. Today, U.S. Route 60 is the main roadway paralleling the bay along the resort strip on Ocean View Avenue. U.S. Route 460 begins at its junction in front of the site of the former amusement park, where a city park and a high rise condominium is now located.  East Beach  In a large-scale urban renewal project begun in the 1990s, the city of Norfolk invested over $50 million to develop, as part of a public-private partnership, an upscale new urbanist waterfront neighborhood named \\"East Beach\\" in East Ocean View. As part of the project, the city acquired and tore down more than 1,600 buildings across 100 acres, and relocated hundreds of low-income residents. The master plan for the neighborhood was designed by Andr√©s Duany with Duany Plater-Zyberk. The neighborhood is fashioned after classic Southeastern seaboard coastal villages, and includes 700 residences, neighborhood restaurants, boutique shops, a Bay Front Club, offices, parks and public places. In 2003, a massive beach restoration project was completed by the city, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the Virginia Port Authority, which involved a large-scale rebuilding of sand dunes, planting of vegetation, and the placement of 10 offshore breakwaters to slow erosion and protect the neighborhood from coastal storms. In 2007, the American Shore and Beach Preservation Association named East Beach one of the nation's top seven restored beaches.  Ocean View Fishing Pier  Not only was the Amusement Park well known to the region, so was Harrison's Fishing Pier. Owned by Bill Harrison and managed by Charlie Woodard. It was heavily damaged during Hurricane Isabel in September, 2003. A new pier was built, called the Ocean View Fishing Pier.http://www.superpages.com/bp/Norfolk-VA/Ocean-View-Fishing- Pier-L0127827373.htm Now owned by Ronnie Boone Jr., it continues to be an Ocean View landmark and attraction. This fishing pier is 1,690 feet long.

It is set in 2002/3 and Adrian is 33¬æ years of age. The life of the protagonist is covered for one year, with a short epilogue that jumps to a time one year later (to 2004). The title of the book refers to the Iraqi WMD that were used as justification for the Iraq War which began at this time. This is a recurring theme throughout the book. Plot summary The story also deals with an issue that has affected Sue Townsend directly; she was registered blind in 2001, as a result of long-term diabetes. Adrian Mole and the Weapons of Mass Destruction was typed by Townsend's husband from dictation. Critical reception In her review of the book, Mary Wakefield felt Mole's immature and angst-ridden personality has lost its appeal as he approaches middle-age, where it was endearing in a younger man.Wakefield, Mary (October 24, 2004), \\"Adrian Mole has become Mr Bean,\\" Telegraph. Retrieved December 27, 2017 Main characters=Bruce \\"Brainbox\\" Henderson Bruce was Adrian's old schoolmate in the first book. He was very clever although he couldn't grasp more philosophical concepts and dealt mainly with numbers. He never seemed to have many friends and was always seen with a calculator in his hand. He later started IdioTech, a company that specialises in 'technology for idiots'. At the end of the book he marries Marigold. Nigel Hetherington Nigel is Adrian's best friend. During the course of the novel he becomes blind. Unfortunately he has to give up working as a media analyst due to his condition, since this job essentially involves reading newspapers. Due to this and his situation in general, he becomes depressed and short-tempered. He often snaps at Adrian and is rude and contemptuous to him, despite Adrian's (often clearly misguided) attempts to involve him in his writer's workshop and cheer him up. He is given a guide dog for his condition, to which he develops an emotional attachment. Glenn Bott/Mole The son of Adrian Mole. Glenn, to his father's considerable annoyance, possesses none of his father's \\"intelligence\\" and opts to join the British Army. Stationed in Iraq, he is positively encouraged by his father to fight in a war with no foreseeable end. Towards the end, Adrian's opinion of the war has radically changed. Robbie Stainforth The best friend of Glenn, Adrian's son, and a private in the British Army, through which he is deployed to Iraq. He enjoys reading and becomes friends with Adrian's boss, Mr Carlton-Hayes, by exchanging letters. Mr Carlton-Hayes is keen to further his interest and sends him several books to read. He is killed in a bomb explosion near the end of the book, which upsets Adrian greatly. Marigold Flowers For a while she is Adrian's girlfriend, and later his fiance, but he loves her less each day. Adrian became engaged to her only because of the influence of her father, Michael. Marigold is described as needy, hysterical, mentally and emotionally unstable and a hypochondriac. She seems to always expect to get what she wants and proves to be manipulating Adrian. She even lies that she is pregnant with Adrian's child in a final attempt to make him marry her. At the end, however, she marries Bruce \\"Brainbox\\" Henderson. Daisy Flowers Daisy is Marigold's elder half-sister. She is the \\"black sheep\\" of the Flowers family, having embraced the materialistic lifestyle that they claim to renounce. She and Adrian are attracted to each other, and he eventually leaves Marigold in favour of her. Her father, Michael Flowers describes her as a Hedonist. Unlike the rest of the Flowers family, Daisy is popular with Adrian's friends and family. However, Daisy is temperamental, frequently drunk, and much to Adrian's annoyance swears in mostly every sentence. Michael Flowers Father of Daisy, Poppy, and Marigold. He is a powerful patriarchal figure, a vegetarian, a madrigal-singer, and a hater of modernity. He dislikes Mr. Carlton-Hayes, mostly because of a long-standing disagreement they have concerning J.R.R. Tolkien. Michael Flowers is a domineering character, who appears to like Adrian, and appears to attempt to groom Adrian to be his ideal son-in-law and surrogate son. Flowers is opinionated and usually ignores Adrian should he try argue his corner. After a life of left-wing piety Flowers later becomes a supporter of the right wing populist United Kingdom Independence Party. Pandora Braithwaite Adrian's childhood sweetheart. Formerly an Oxford academic, specialising in Eastern European languages, she has more recently become a politician and a Labour MP. There are some indications scattered through the novel that Adrian is still in love with her, as he was throughout most of the earlier books. Pandora also sent text messages to him saying she loved him but did that only when she was \\"drunk\\". Since The Cappuccino Years, Pandora has been the New Labour MP for Ashby-de- la-Zouch, and in this instalment resigns from her role as a prominent Parliamentary Private Secretary due to her disagreement with the government's invasion of Iraq in 2003, though she remains an MP. Mr Hugh Carlton-Hayes (Hughie) Adrian‚Äôs employer, always referred to as ‚ÄúMr Carlton-Hayes‚Äù. He runs a small independent bookshop, where Adrian works and helps to slightly modernise. Unlike many of Adrian's acquaintances, Mr Carlton-Hayes has a very kind nature and helps Adrian out of his depression at the end of the book. A veteran of World War II, he is in his late seventies and from an upper-class background. A running joke in the book is that Adrian does not know whether Mr Carlton-Hayes' partner Leslie is a man or a woman; this is never made clear. Although they are from different backgrounds, he and Adrian share an appreciation of literature, contempt for Michael Flowers, and a similar reservation about expressing their feelings. It is revealed in Adrian Mole: The Prostrate Years that Leslie is a man and implied they both left their wives for their relationship. Pauline Mole Pauline is Adrian's mother, and plays less of a role in the story than in previous books. Like Adrian, Pauline is inclined to spend using money she hasn't got. Pauline's desire to live in a converted building result in she and her husband George converting some pigsties. Adrian is frustrated by his mother and father refusing to grow old in appearance. George Mole Adrian's father. George is still unemployed, and appears to have given up resolving this. After injuring himself converting the pigsties, the balding George becomes disabled. Adrian appears to sympathise with his father more than in previous books. Other characters=Poppy Flowers Poppy Flowers is the middle Flowers sister. She is described as having particularly long hair (to the point in Adrian's opinion, where you feel awkward not commenting on it). Poppy is portrayed as being a moody and volatile character. Poppy is perhaps the middle ground between her sisters. Poppy on occasion allies with Daisy in criticizing the feeble personality and lifestyle of Marigold. It is mentioned that she is a Scientologist. Animal Animal is hired by Adrian's parents to convert their pigsties into a house. Animal is a man of few words, described by Darren (a friend of Adrian's) with the words, \\"He can't do a four-piece jigsaw... but he picks up a sledgehammer like it's a bag of feathers.\\" At the end of the book, when his work is done, he is still living with Adrian's parents, in an apparent m√©nage √† trois. Wayne Wong Wayne is a former school friend of Adrian's, now a proprietor of a Chinese restaurant, where he offers Adrian a discount. As such nearly every social occasion of Adrian's is held at the restaurant. Parvez Another former school friend of Adrian. Parvez is an independent financial adviser, who unfruitfully attempts to persuade Adrian to rein in his spending. Members of the Leicestershire and Rutland Creative Writing Group=Ken Blunt Ken is an anti-war, anti-American writer, whom Adrian befriends. Ken is married and believes it to be his duty to write about war, stating 'I can't stand the sort of writing that spends two chapters describing the colour of an Autumn fucking leaf'. Gary Milksop Gary is a feeble character who believes himself to be a talented writer. In reality, Gary has little aptitude to writing and cannot take criticism, hence the rest of the group constantly praise his mundane and lackluster writing. Gladys Fordingbridge Gladys is a pensioner who writes poems solely about cats. Her penchant for writing cat poetry annoys the rest of the group. When she is published, Adrian sees the opportunity to remove her from the group, and tells her she will have to leave the group once she renounces her amateur status. At the end of her diary, a poem of hers is published in the Times, which criticizes the lead up to the Iraq war.

The character has also appeared in Everybody Loves Raymond, Becker, and Cosby. The character is portrayed by Kevin James, whose stand-up comedy provided the comedic themes and general style of the show. Doug, a smart aleck, often immature \\"Average Joe\\", lives in Rego Park, Queens, with his wife Carrie Heffernan (Leah Remini), and his father-in-law Arthur Spooner (Jerry Stiller). Doug is a delivery driver for the International Parcel Service (a fictional version of United Parcel Service), a job Doug acquired by pretending to work there after lying to then-girlfriend Carrie about having a job. Background Doug was born on February 9, 1965, in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, while his mother Janet (played by Jenny O'Hara) and father Joe (Dakin Matthews) were attending a friend's wedding there. He had been told by his parents that he had been born in New York City, and only discovered the truth as an adult, in the episode \\"Dog Shelter\\". He has one sister, a physical education teacher named Stephanie, played by Ricki Lake. Doug's father owned a small hardware store in Queens, and his mother was a homemaker. References in a number of episodes indicate that the Heffernan home was a Catholic one, although Doug seems to have strayed from this after moving out. He lived with his parents until 27, before he moved into Richie's apartment. It also appears that Doug's father Joe had wanted Doug to assume control over the hardware store when he came of age, but Doug showed little interest in this venture. He was a chubby child and was even sent to \\"fat camp\\" by his parents. Doug's weight battle was frequently a subject of contention between himself and his wife, with Carrie encouraging him to eat healthier but Doug steadfast in his enjoyment of fried foods and snacks. In fact, Carrie's domineering personality over the more easygoing Doug was another frequent subject matter, with Doug often secretly defying her demands (over clothing and type of cologne, for example). Doug is an avid sports fan, supporting the New York Mets, New York Jets, New York Knicks, and the New York Islanders. Doug, in fact, would propose to Carrie at a Jets game. One year for Christmas, when he was given a Miami Dolphins Christmas ornament, Doug openly didn't like it because both the Jets and Dolphins played in the AFC East. (Despite the Jets‚ÄìPatriots rivalry becoming more intense during the show's run than the Dolphins‚ÄìJets rivalry, it was never mentioned on the show; however, the Monday Night Miracle did take place during the show's third season.) Doug's love for the Mets is reflective of James in real life; he named his daughter Shea Joelle after the then-home of the Mets, Shea Stadium. Doug attended St. Gregory's High School in Queens, where he befriended Spence Olchin; he also went to school with his cousin Danny. Doug played high school football as a St. Gregory's Commodore, and was a star player and starting fullback. He was All-County in football during his junior and senior years. Frequent references to this era show that Doug was very popular in school, and it is because of this that he thinks of high school as the best years of his life. Unlike other popular jocks who usually bully outsiders and geeks, Doug was never like that in high school and the main reason why he was liked. In the episode \\"Hi, School\\", Doug says to Carrie during an argument: \\"Oh I see what's going on; you're mad because I rocked in high school, and you didn't.\\" Carrie was the mean girl and rebellious teenager in high school and Doug was the slacker and sometimes outsider who wanted to be liked in high school. After graduation he went on to junior college (Nassau Community College, located on Long Island), but dropped out after eight days, without any clear plan. He tried out for the Nassau County Rebels, a semi-professional football team, but ultimately quit, because of politics. He later acquired a job as a bouncer at a bar. Around this time his friend Richie Ianucchi, a firefighter for the FDNY, introduced him to his future wife, Carrie Spooner. While dating Carrie, Doug inadvertently landed his final, and longest-standing, job as a truck driver for the fictional International Parcel Service (IPS). Doug's trademark phrase is \\"Shutty!\\" as a means of telling people to \\"shut up\\". Marriage Early in the series it was stated that Doug and Carrie had known each other in junior high. That story was re-written; the new plot stated that Doug and his friend Richie met Carrie at a club, then went on a double date that did not go well until the end. Doug first met Carrie's father, Arthur (Jerry Stiller), at a Thanksgiving dinner that went horribly wrong. Doug was nearly scared away by Arthur, who disapproved of the relationship, but later in this episode he and Carrie declare their love for one another. Doug and Carrie got engaged at a Jets game and married in 1995, prior to the start of the series. Initially, they lived with Arthur while searching for a house. After finding a house, Arthur's wife died and his home burnt down, and he was forced to move in with them. In Season 6, the loving couple decide to renew their vows to show their love and affection for one another. The idea came to be during a romantic dinner where Doug becomes inspired and courageously proclaims his love to his wife Carrie. Carrie is touched by the kindness of her husband and suggests to Doug that they should renew their vows. As the days roll on, the couple's initial enthusiasm towards renewing their vows quickly dwindles, they soon find that planning the wedding is becoming a hassle and much more troublesome that they had initially expected. Through mutual agreement, they call off the wedding, the couple call their friends and relatives to let them know of the cancellation, however to their surprise, the reaction of the relatives and friends is unexpected. Doug's mother is worried that there is something wrong with her son's marriage. Doug and Carrie's frustrations grow as rumors of their marriage complications are spread. They decide that the ceremony will go ahead and despite further complications (finding a chimp to serve as Doug's best man proves to be tough) Doug and Carrie renew their wedding vows. At the end of the series, Doug and Carrie adopt a baby girl from China. On the same day, Carrie realizes that she is pregnant. Friends Doug's best friend is fellow IPS driver Deacon Palmer (Victor Williams), who is married to Carrie's best friend, Kelly (Merrin Dungey). His other friends include lifelong friend, subway toll booth collector Spence Olchin (Patton Oswalt), a firefighter named Richie Ianucchi (Larry Romano), cousin Danny (Gary Valentine); dog walker Holly (Nicole Sullivan); and next door neighbor, bodybuilder Lou Ferrigno (played by himself). Another friend of Doug's, Ray Barone (Ray Romano) also appears as a guest on several episodes of the show; likewise, he has also appeared on several episodes on Romano's own show, Everybody Loves Raymond, as well as other New York-based CBS shows such as Cosby, The Nanny and Becker. After King of Queens In 2016, Doug resurfaced on several television spots for a new CBS sitcom starring Kevin James, called Kevin Can Wait. In these ads, he meets up with the man who played him and they have a short banter about the upcoming sitcom. In one ad, he suggests portraying a next-door neighbor to James' new character, and in another, while watching television and bringing up the fact that King of Queens is currently in reruns, he tempts James (who is about to eat a plate of carrot sticks) with a large bucket of fried chicken, which the actor eats.

Handicapping, in sport and games, is the practice of assigning advantage through scoring compensation or other advantage given to different contestants to equalize the chances of winning. The word also applies to the various methods by which the advantage is calculated. In principle, a more experienced participant is disadvantaged, or a less experienced or capable participant is advantaged, in order to make it possible for the less experienced participant to win whilst maintaining fairness. Handicapping is used in scoring many games and competitive sports, including go, shogi, chess, croquet, golf, bowling, polo, basketball, and track and field events. Handicap races are common in clubs which encourage all levels of participants, such as swimming or in cycling clubs and sailing clubs, or which allow participants with a variety of standards of equipment. Often races, contests or tournaments where this practice is competitively employed are known as Handicaps. Handicapping also refers to the various methods by which spectators can predict and quantify the results of a sporting match. The term is applied to the practice of predicting the result of a competition, such as for purposes of betting against the point spread. A favored team that wins by less than the point spread still wins the game, but bets on that team lose. In either case the handicapper is the person who sets the handicaps for the activity. Etymology The term handicap derives from hand-in-cap, referring to a system wherein players placed bets or money into the cap of a neutral arbiter to reach an agreement as to the relative values of items sought to be traded.\\"handicap, n.\\" The Oxford English Dictionary. 2nd ed. 1989. OED Online. Oxford University Press. 8 Oct. 2008 . Competition handicapping In a 'result adjustment' style handicap event, the outcome may be adjusted by some factor determined by the handicap. Some forms of car or yacht racing. In this case, the winner, on elapsed time, may differ from the fastest competitor when the times have been adjusted for the different competitors' handicaps. In a 'pursuit' style handicap race, all participants are clocked in a time trial before the race. When this takes place at the same event as the main race, it is known as the handicap. In the race itself, the participants do not all start at the same \\"Go\\"; the starts are staggered, based on the handicaps. The slowest swimmer, or cyclist, for example, starts first and the fastest starts last, making the end of the race (hopefully) close. An ideal handicap race is one in which all participants finish at the same time. UK Horse Racing. Accessed 5 February 2011. The winner is the person who beats his or her own time. Similarly, physically staggered starting positions can be used, for example, in greyhound racing a handicap race is where greyhounds (based on their ability) start from different starting traps set at different measurements from the finish line, and in human foot racing, for example, the Stawell Gift. Some motorsport events, especially in sports car racing, demand teams to stop the vehicle in the pitbox a fixed period of time depending on the drivers' classification, thus giving advantage to less skilled drivers. An example of a championship using this system is the International GT Open. The advantage of this system over ballast weight systems is that vehicles have the normal performance on track, so better drivers will be able to recover time and overtake slower drivers. Contrarily, horse race handicapping is implemented using extra weight. Horse racing A handicap race in horse racing is a race in which horses carry different weights, allocated by the handicapper. A better horse will carry a heavier weight, to give him or her a disadvantage when racing against slower horses. The handicapper's goal in assigning handicap weights is to enable all the horses to finish together (in a dead heat). The skill in betting on a handicap horse race is in determining which horse can overcome its handicap. British Horseracing Authority. Accessed 5 February 2011. In addition to the Daily Racing Form, other data sources include Brisnet, Equibase, The Ragozin Sheets, and Thoro-Graph. Golf Handicapping in the sport of golf enables players and teams of varying abilities to compete against one another. A golf handicap is a numerical measure of a golfer's potential or \\"average best\\". Better players are those with the lowest handicaps. Chess Types of chess handicaps include: * the stronger player surrenders a certain piece or pieces * the weaker player has extra moves at the beginning of the game * the weaker player has extra time on the chess clock * the odds-giver to deliver checkmate with a specified piece Go Handicapping in go includes the weaker player being given an advantage by placing a number of stones before the stronger player commences, and by final points adjustment. Shogi Handicapping in shogi is achieved by removing one or more pieces from the stronger player's side. Shogi (Japanese chess) and many of its variants have handicaps. GlidingPolo The polo handicap is an estimation of the player's worth to his or her team. It is an overall rating of a player's horsemanship, team play, knowledge of the game, strategy and horses. The difference between the total of the polo handicaps for the players on each team is then used to determine the minimum score difference for the better team to score to enable them to win. In polo, every player is awarded an individual handicap depending on performance. Handicap commissions of the national associations meet several times a year to decide players‚Äô handicaps. Argentina: 0 to 10 USA: C (-2), B (-1), B+ (-0.5), A (0), A+ (0.5), 1.0, 1.5, 2 to 10 England: -2 to 10 Sailing Handicaps for sailing vessels in sailing races have varied throughout history, and they also vary by country, and by sailing organisation. Sailing handicap standards exist internationally, nationally, and within individual sailing clubs. Sailing race handicaps may be based on vessel capability and-or crew experience, and today typically adjust the time a vessel takes to reach the finish point of the race. TennisMotorcycle speedway The Calculated Match Average is a handicap calculated for every motorcycle speedway rider. Outcome prediction=Middle and arbitrage bets There are strategies that involve differences in the lines on the same event at different books. One bet is called a \\"middle\\", which when a player finds two books that offer different point spreads for the same event. They will bet the more favorable spread at both books, and if the final score falls between the two, the bettor will win both bets. On the other hand, if the total falls outside the range of the \\"middle\\" the bettor only loses a small percentage of a bet (the \\"juice\\" or \\"vig\\" taken by the house). For example, Book 1 has Team A as a 3-point favorite, and Book 2 has team B as a 3-point favorite. If a player bets Team B at Book 1, and Team A at Book 2, he will win both bets if either side wins by 2 or less points, and will win one bet and lose the other (known as a \\"side\\") if either team wins by 3 points. Another strategy, known as arbitrage, or an \\"arb\\" or \\"scalp\\", involves finding different moneylines for the same event. In this case, the bettor will bet the more favorable line at both books, and have a guaranteed profit. For example, if Book 1 considers Team A to be worth +200 (2 to 1 underdog), and Book 2 considers Team B to be worth +200, a bettor can bet Team A at Book 1, and Team B at Book 2, and guarantee a 100% profit. This is a no-risk bet, as the player is guaranteed a profit no matter the result of the game. Famous handicappers The first very well known sports handicapper in American culture was Jimmy \\"The Greek\\" Snyder. During his career he worked for CBS on their Sunday morning show, The NFL Today. Because sports betting had a social taboo at the time, Snyder was not allowed to mention betting on games specifically. Instead, he would predict the score. Over the years the attitude towards sports betting, and handicapping in general, has changed. Billy Walters was profiled by 60 Minutes because of his handicapping abilities. Billy Walters, and other unknown members of the Computer Group, developed a system for handicapping games and beating Las Vegas sportsbooks. The Huffington Post covered Jon Price a reclusive sports bettor that hires Ph.D's and works off of algorithmic information for his predictions. ESPN wrote an article on Haralabos Voulgaris naming him as the one of the premier NBA handicappers in the world. He claims to have developed a system that uses advanced statistical analysis to predict the outcomes of games. In the past, very few people did any mathematical calculations when handicapping sporting events. Predictions were usually made from hunches or information not readily available to the public. However, with the advancement of technology computers powerful enough to run advanced simulation models now frequent homes and offices. Advanced statistics such as DVOA, Win Shares and Points per Possession are talked about in mainstream media. Brian Burke, author of The Fifth Down blog featured in the New York Times, wrote a formula using advanced statistical techniques that has shown consistency correctly predicting NFL winners. Handicapping, as a profession, is very similar to being a stock analyst. Like Wall Street did in the 1970s, the sports handicapping industry is undergoing a quantitative revolution. Many successful handicappers also use money management systems similar to financial investment professionals. The most popular, and mathematically superior, system is the Kelly criterion. It is a formula for maximizing profits and minimizing losses based on payout odds and win probability of the underlying asset.

The traditional inhabitants of Yarrawarrah are the Tharawal people, with Yarrawarrah being an Aboriginal word meaning mountain ash. Yarrawarrah is also the name of a ridge which was located in the vicinity between Heathcote and Waterfall.  History  A history of the Yarrawarra suburb is available at the Dictionary of Sydney Yarrawarra page, contributed by a Sutherland Shire Library local studies librarian, a summary of which follows. Prior to Yarrawarrah being recognised as a suburb by Geographical Names Board in 1971, the area was known as North Engadine. Charles McAlister, a pioneering developer of Engadine area took up the first portions of crown land in 1887, likely offered for sale due to the opening of the Illawarra railway line to Waterfall earlier in 1886. The initial residents of the area in the 1920s consisted of the returning soldiers and their families after World War I and then later families moving from inner Sydney suburbs during the Depression. In the 1930s families were relocated to the area from existing unemployment camps in Cook Park at Botany Bay. Through 1939 Industrialisation increased in the area with a clay and shale pit at the end of what is now Old Bush Road, although of limited impact other than to increase the visibility of the need of improved access. In 1952 bush fires caused significant damage further highlighting the limited access, and helped establish a new progress association in 1959 in front of the general store located on Old Bush Road. In 1962 the State Housing Commission announced it was planning a new suburb on 80 acres (32.3 hectares) of crown land between Loftus and Engadine and adjacent to the north Engadine settlement. In 1968, the a primary school was built on Old Bush Road, with a proposed name of Engadine North, however this was rejected by the Geographical Names Board, instead settling on Yarrawarrah (being an Aboriginal word for mountain ash and a nearby ridge line). This, the proposal of the new suburb being seen by some as potentially absorbing Engadine North, and a counter concern that Engadine itself could encompass the entire region to Old Bush Road, in 1971 led to the Geographical Names Board officially designated the area Yarrawarrah.http://www.sutherlandshire.nsw.gov.au/files/assets/website/documents/council/about- shire/suburb-origins.pdf ORIGIN OF THE NAMES OF SUBURBS AND OTHER PLACES In the 1970s changes to the way the Princes Highway was routed allowed further road access to the area which were completed in 1975. A final request for a Railway station was rejected by council in 1979. In 1983 Sutherland council allocated funds to build a new hall under the name of Yarrawarrah Community Hall. The North Engadine Scout Hall remained and is still adjacent to it. The new hall was opened in 1984. Through the 1990s the local community amenities continued to be developed with the local shopping village growing to provide for the growing demand of local residents.  Population  In the 2016 Census, there were 2,733 people in Yarrawarrah. 87.1% of people were born in Australia. The next most common country of birth was England at 3.7%. 92.7% of people only spoke English at home. The most common responses for religion were Catholic 32.2%, Anglican 25.0% and No Religion 23.4%.  Locale  Yarrawarrah borders the Royal National Park and contains many pockets of bushland. It is a hilly suburb stretching to the valley of Engadine, with several fire trail heads (Turrella, Fairy Creek). Yarrawarrah contains many streets named after places in Western Australia and South Australia, including Nullabor Place, Gibson Street, Wittenoom Place, Roebourne Street, Carnarvon Street and Exmouth Place, along with Aboriginal themes (animals, plants) and War themes (Victoria's Cross recipients, notable local veterans).  Local Amenities  Yarrawarrah has a small shopping village with a landmark windmill, containing a medical practice, pharmacy hair salon, Italian and Chinese restaurants, and a convenience store. The windmill itself has gained popularity in November 2009, boasting its own Facebook page and acting as a community forum. The Yarrawarrah Community Hall is also across the road from the shopping village with a main hall (90 standing, 70 seated) and meeting room (15 standing, 10 seated) available for hire, with adjacent North Engadine Scout Hall. Yarrawarrah Public School was established in 1968 is located behind the shopping village on Old Bush Road. The school has twelve classes. There are two Early Stage 1 (Kindergarten) classes, four Stage 1 classes (Year 1 and 2), three Stage 2 classes (Year 3 and 4), one Stage 2/3 class (Year 4 and 5) and two Stage 3 classes (Year 5 and 6). Yarrawarrah has two sporting ovals: * Old Bush Road Oval on Old Bush Road (home to the Engadine Lions Rugby Union Club and National Touch Rugby Australia games) * Yarrawarrah Reserve on the corner of Giles Street and Wheatley Road (home to Yarrawarrah Tigers Junior Rugby League Football Club and Yarrawarrah Tigers Junior Baseball Club) Yarrawarrah also has a community run, hobby Internet connected weather station.  Loss of Windmill and local Icon  In the fourth quarter 2018 a local resident attached a tether the windmill at The Windmill Shopping center to prevent it squeaking as it rotated. In high winds this tether became entangled around the blades causing them to become twisted. Strong winds on the night of the 13th of December 2018 resulted in the windmill becoming unsafe and was removed by contractors. The current \\"comet\\" windmill was quickly installed. It stands a little shorter than the original.  Transport  The Princes Highway is the main road that borders Yarrawarrah, to the east. There were originally requests to build a wooden railway platform in 1936, but it was never built, with road access being improved, further requests to build a train station in Yarrawarrah were raised in the 1970s, however the plans never went ahead, being refused by council in 1979. The closest train stations are Engadine and Loftus. Busses also service the area, notably Transdev 991 and 993 routes.

Romance studies or Romance philology (in French: √©tudes romanes; in Spanish: filolog√≠a rom√°nica) is an academic discipline that covers the study of the languages, literatures, and cultures of areas that speak a Romance language. Romance studies departments usually include the study of Spanish, French, Italian, and Portuguese. Additional languages of study include Romanian and Catalan, on one hand, and culture, history, and politics on the other hand. Because most places in Latin America speak a Romance language, Latin America is also studied in Romance studies departments. As a result, non-Romance languages in use in Latin America, such as Quechua, are sometimes also taught in Romance studies departments. Romance studies departments differ from single- or two-language departments in that they attempt to break down the barriers in scholarship among the various languages, through interdisciplinary or comparative work. These departments differ from Romance language departments in that they place a heavier emphasis on connections between language and literature, among others.

HM Prison Palen Creek was established in 1934. This was the first prison in the Commonwealth to have absolutely no security measures except the honour of prisoners selected to go there. Prisoners erected their own buildings (they lived in tents originally) and sold produce from prisoner maintained market gardens. In 1937, there was a daily average of 50 male prisoners at Palen Creek. Palen Creek now accommodates 170 prisoners. The centre is designed for low and open security male inmates. The operational focus of these activities places an emphasis upon the need to ensure that inmates address their offending behaviour. This is facilitated by programs including vocational training, industry based employment and general education aimed at increasing skill levels of literacy and numeracy. Staffing of the centre reflects a multi-disciplinary team-based approach to operational requirements, with the management structure founded upon functional area responsibilities and team management principles. The centre is now managed and linked to Wolston Correctional Centre in Brisbane.

The majority of Manyika comes from the eastern region of Zimbabwe. The dialect is widely spoken in Manicaland Province and in certain areas of Manica Province in neighbouring Mozambique. The Manyica dialect varies from region to region in Manicaland. Those from Nyanga, Nyamaropa, Nyatate and surrounding regions have a different tone and shaping of words compared to those from the Buhera and Bocha areas. There are inherent cultural norms in each of the sub-regions inhabited by the Manyika. Language The Manyika language is a dialect of the broader Shona language. Largely spoken by the Manyika people in the eastern parts of Zimbabwe and across the border in Mozambique. During colonization the term was taken to include all people from Manicaland an administrative province of eastern Zimbabwe. Other shona dialects that must stand alone were incorporated into the Manyika dialect by so doing forcefully marrying cultures that are not compatible. The Manyika are the people under chief Mutasa whose territory used to stretch into now Mozambique. To the south it is bordered by the Jindwi dialect also known as Chibocha. The Jindwi share borders with the Ndau in Chimanimani stretching down to Chipinge and have the Vahera to the west. The Ndau dialect is complicated on its own with people from the dry parts distinct from those from the highlands. The other cultures and dialects married into the Manyika dialect are Chiungwe which is for the people mostly under Makoni this dialect is clearly distinct form the others mentioned above. Nyanga also has a lot of other dialects that are distinct from Zezuru and the Chimanyika where they were married into. The Wanyama under chief Saunyama and the Wahwesa in Kairezi, the Tangwena in nyamaropa and the vabarwe are dialects that were included to make the manyika dialect. Stretching into Mozambique have a dialect that must be respected as it is different form other dialects it was grouped into. Variations in local vocabulary and word prefixes exist. In East Africa, manyika means \\"be known\\"; therefore, some people have Manyika as their surname. The prefix va- (used in Shona before male names to signify seniority and respect) is sa- in Manyika. It is also replaced by wa-; vanhu vakaenda vakawanda becomes wanhu wakaenda wakawanda. However, in some areas Zezuru and Karanga words have been completely altered when they are translated into ChiManyika; for example, the Zezuru word Nhasi (meaning \\"today\\") becomes Nyamusi in Manyika. The identification through cultures languages and artificial boundaries worked well in separating and dividing the Zimbabweans thus making it easier for the management and control of the administrative districts. This however failed to maintain and appreciate the religious and cultural norms of these dialects. This has been adopted by the current governments though these boundaries have been shifted the identification of these dialects as representing a culture is still to be considered. This has subsequently led to the abandonment and lack of appreciation of minority cultures by so doing killing the aspect of identity and belonging. History In 1695 Emperor Changamire Dombo overran the rich gold-producing kingdom of Manyika, descending to the lowlands on the eastern edge of the country to destroy the Portuguese market town at Masikwesi. Dombo now controlled the whole gold-producing territory from Butwa in the southwest to Manyika in the northeast.Terence Ranger, \\"Missionaries, Migrants and the Manyika: The Invention of Ethnicity in Zimbabwe\\" in Vail, Leroy, ed. (1988) The Creation of Tribalism in Southern Africa. London: James Currey. Another use for the word Manyika was developed by the Portuguese in the late 19th century. Claiming that the then-reigning Mutasa had made a \\"voluntary submission\\" to them in 1876, they expanded the area of Manyika on their maps to the enormous territory to which they laid claim: The greatly expanded Portuguese Manyika included the territory of Maungwe; the Portuguese treated the Makoni chiefs of Maungwe as independent sovereigns and made treaties with them. A third use of Manyika was that made by the British as a counter to claims by the Portuguese and the SaManyika people. In their attempt to gain control of \\"the Pungwe River route, which was the main water way to and from Beira\\", the British South Africa Company imposed \\"a treaty on Mutasa on 14 September 1890\\". The treaty \\"provided that no one could possess land in Manyika except with the consent of the BSA Company\\".Bhila, p. 237. When it was signed the company invented its own \\"Greater Manyika\\", the western boundaries of which lay deep inside Portuguese territory; areas such as Mazoe and Maungwe, to which the company made different claims, were excluded. Once the company's frontiers had been fixed by means of war and arbitration, there was no longer any need to inflate the power and territory of Mutasa. The kingdom of Manyika was divided between the two administrative districts of Umtali and Inyanga; much of its land was alienated to white farmers, and the administration was determined to advance a minimal definition of Manyikahood. \\"Umtassa's country and people are called Manyika\\", wrote Native Commissioner Umtali in January 1904. \\"They do not speak the same dialect as the other Mashonas\\". The desire to separate Mutasa from neighbouring peoples can be seen in early district reports from Umtali, in which Native Commissioner Hulley contendedt that the three chiefs in the district (Mutasa, Maranke and Zimunya) had distinct origins (even if there was a popular tendency to refer to his district as \\"Manicaland\\"). As far as the administrative district of Makoni was concerned, the Native Department emphasized the distinction between its people and the Manyika. In 1910 there was a boundary dispute between the Native Commissioners of Makoni and Inyanga districts. Native Commissioner Inyanga wrote Superintendent of Natives Umtali to explain why he was collecting tax from Africans on farms which lay just within the western border of Makoni district: The matter was decided; the Chief Native Commissioner determined that \\"the N.C., Inyanga deal with all Manyika natives and the N.C., Rusapi with all the Makoni\\".NAZ NUA 3/2/1 Superintendent of Natives Umtali to Chief Native Commissioner, 8 April 1910; comment by Chief Native Commissioner. The Native Department politically and culturally separated the Ungwe of Makoni from the Manyika. In 1915, a debate arose within the Native Department about the significance of the term mayiaini in relation to Manyika marriage customs. Llewellyn Meredith (who had been Native Commissioner in both Melsetter and Makoni districts, whose inhabitants were considered Manyika) expressed his opinion about \\"Manica customs and language\\", but was scorned by the Manyika specialists. Superintendent of Natives Umtali mocked Meredith's \\"18 years experience of Manyika customs gathered in other districts\\" and invoked the authority of Archdeacon Etheridge (the leading missionary expert on Mutasa's chiefdom). \\"I do not of course know\\", wrote Etheridge, \\"what word may be used in Chindau, or Chirungwe, the dialects spoken in Melsetter and Rusape [Makoni] districts, but as regards Chimanyika there is no question at all\\".NAZ NUA 3/2/2 Memorandum, \\"Mayinini\\", 20 December 1915.

The 125th Street subway station of the IRT Broadway ‚Äì Seventh Avenue Line can be seen overhead. 125th Street, co-named Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard, is a two-way street that runs east‚Äìwest in the New York City borough of Manhattan, from First Avenue on the east to Marginal Street, a service road for the Henry Hudson Parkway along the Hudson River in the west. It is often considered to be the \\"Main Street\\" of Harlem. Notable buildings along 125th Street include the Apollo Theater, the Adam Clayton Powell Jr. State Office Building, the Hotel Theresa, the Studio Museum in Harlem, the Mount Morris Bank Building, Harlem Commonwealth Council, the Harlem Children's Zone, the Church of St. Joseph of the Holy Family, and the former West End Theatre, now home to the La Gree Baptist Church. History The street was designated by the Commissioners' Plan of 1811 that established the Manhattan street grid as one of 15 east‚Äìwest streets that would be in width (while other streets were designated as in width).Morris, Gouverneur, De Witt, Simeon, and Rutherford, John (March 1811) \\"Remarks Of The Commissioners For Laying Out Streets And Roads In The City Of New York, Under The Act Of April 3, 1807\\", Cornell University Library. Accessed June 27, 2016. \\"These streets are all sixty feet wide except fifteen, which are one hundred feet wide, viz.: Numbers fourteen, twenty-three, thirty- four, forty-two, fifty-seven, seventy-two, seventy-nine, eighty-six, ninety- six, one hundred and six, one hundred and sixteen, one hundred and twenty- five, one hundred and thirty-five, one hundred and forty-five, and one hundred and fifty-five--the block or space between them being in general about two hundred feet.\\" Neighborhoods leftThe western part of the street runs diagonally between the neighborhoods of Manhattanville and Morningside Heights from the northwest from an interchange with the Henry Hudson Parkway at 130th Street. East of Morningside Avenue it runs east‚Äìwest through central Harlem to Second Avenue, where a ramp connects it to the Robert F. Kennedy (Triborough) Bridge. However, 125th Street continues to First Avenue, where it connects to the southbound FDR Drive and the Willis Avenue Bridge. West of Convent Avenue, 125th Street was rerouted onto what was, prior to 1920, called Manhattan Street. What remains of the original alignment of 125th Street was renamed La Salle Street at that time. The remaining blocks run between Amsterdam Avenue and Claremont Avenue. The New York Times lamented the name changes, noting that the new names had \\"somewhat doubtful nomenclature\\", and that the City's \\"Aldermen like French names\\" but gave no rationale for the moves otherwise.\\"Harlem Street Renamed\\" The New York Times (June 27, 1920) A block of the original 125th Street in this area was de-mapped to make the super- blocks where the Grant Houses projects now exist. A proposal to convert the street into a Trans-Harlem Expressway died when funds were diverted from the proposed 125th Street Hudson River bridge at the street's western end. Beginning in the late 1990s, many sections of 125th Street have been gentrified and developed with such stores as MAC Cosmetics, Old Navy, H&M;, CVS/pharmacy, and Magic Johnson Theaters. In collaboration with the community, the city has developed a plan for the 125th Street corridor focusing on reinforcing and building upon its strengths as an arts and cultural corridor. Fault line A rift in the crust runs along underneath this street from the East River to New Jersey and is known as the 125th Street Fault or the Manhattanville Fault. It is suspected to have caused a magnitude-5.2 earthquake in 1737, two smaller ones in 1981, and a 2.4 magnitude quake in 2001.\\"Small Earthquakes Strike New York City\\" Duke Geological Laboratory website The fault line skims across the top of Central Park and runs to Roosevelt Island to the southeast. It creates a fault valley deep enough to require the IRT Broadway‚ÄìSeventh Avenue Line () to use a trestle between 122nd and 135th Streets, even though the line goes underground at either end and remains at the same elevation above sea level throughout. Riverside Drive also crosses over the fault valley on a high viaduct.

Allan Skyway bridges the waters of Hamilton Harbour. Hamilton Harbour, formerly known as Burlington Bay, lies on the western tip of Lake Ontario, bounded on the northwest by the City of Burlington, on the south by the City of Hamilton, and on the east by Hamilton Beach (south of the Burlington Bay James N. Allan Skyway) and Burlington Beach (north of the channel). It is joined to Cootes Paradise by a narrow channel formerly excavated for the Desjardins Canal. Within Hamilton itself, it is referred to as \\"Hamilton Harbour\\", \\"The Harbour\\" and \\"The Bay\\". The bay is naturally separated from Lake Ontario by a sand bar. The opening in the north end was filled in and channel cut in the middle for ships to pass. The Port of Hamilton is on the Hamilton side of the harbour.  History  The bay was named Burlington Bay in 1792 by John Graves Simcoe, the first lieutenant governor of Upper Canada, for the former name of the town of Bridlington in the East Riding of Yorkshire, England.Rayburn, Alan Place Names of Ontario (University of Toronto Press), Toronto-Buffalo-London,1997, ), pg.48 Prior to this, the bay was also known as Washquarter, notably as a landmark to delineate the extents of the Between the Lakes Purchase negotiated between Simcoe and the Mississauga nation in 1792. Another early name for the bay, given by aboriginals was Macassa, meaning \\"beautiful waters\\". Access to the bay was important for the early water transportation and industrial development of the area, including Dundas, Ontario, which had an early but ultimately unrealized lead over both Burlington (Brant's Block) and Hamilton. Over the years, the bay was roughly treated by its littoral residents. Constant infilling, particularly in the North End of Hamilton, damaged fresh water streams and the wildlife they supported. Channel dredging tended to stir up natural and unnatural sediments, further disrupting the ecological land balance in the area. Chemical, industrial and thermal pollution, especially as a byproduct of the burgeoning steel industry after the 1890s, continued to degrade the environment. The water ways in Hamilton have not always been polluted. The north-end of the Harbour used to be a regular swimming spot for working-class families.MacDowell, Laurel Sefton. 2012. An environmental history of Canada. Vancouver: UBC Press. 192. The pollution of Hamilton Harbour water ways is caused by industrialization and, by proxy, urbanization, which came to be a major problem by 1917. Many working-class families were overcome by health hazards when dumping sewage into the inlets and the bay itself became a regular occurrence.Cruikshank, K., and N. B. Bouchier. 1998. \\"Dirty Spaces: Environment, the State, and Recreational Swimming in Hamilton Harbour, 1870-1946\\". SPORT HISTORY REVIEW. 29 (1): 59-64 Laurel Sefton MacDowell writes in her book An Environmental History of Canada that, \\"As early as the 1860s, a fishery inspector at Hamilton Harbour discovered that fish found along the shore tasted of coal oil and that dead ducks and muskrats were coated with oil from two refineries.\\" By the 1950s, city officials had deemed Hamilton Harbour unfit for any recreation use and shut down all beaches. In 1919, a Federal Order-In-Council changed the name of Burlington Bay to Hamilton Harbour. By the 1970s, the International Joint Commission, which governs water usage in the Great Lakes Basin, and other agencies began to recognize the need for action. Greater water quality awareness, improved pollution controls, and an economic downturn all served to improve conditions in the 1980s. In the 1990s, beautification and ecological control were well underway. These measures included sealing the Lax Lands, contaminated with heavy metals and other pollutants, under a cap of clay; landscaping Bayfront Park and Pier 4 Park; and keeping common carp from entering Cootes Paradise. The visible and measurable improvement in water quality in Burlington Bay was showcased in 1994 by the very public swim of Sheila Copps, a local MP and federal cabinet minister. Access and recreational use of the bayfront has improved, and swimming is now allowed at two beaches in the harbour: Bayfront and Pier 4. Hamilton Harbour is listed as a Great Lakes Areas of Concern in The Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement between the United States and Canada. Part of the remediation plan is to reclaim the harbour's wetlands.  Randle Reef  Randle Reef, a site in the southeast corner of the harbour, is considered the most dire of identified water pollution issues awaiting remediation in Canada. The environmental containment facility, about 7.5 hectares in size, covers in-situ about 130,000 m3 of sediments contaminated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and contain about 500,000 m3 of dredged PAH contaminated sediments. The containment facility was constructed in 2018 using two walls of steel sheet piling. Later in 2018, contaminated sediment surrounding the containment facility was dredged and placed inside the facility. The wastewater will be treated by an on-site water treatment system using sand filtration and granular activated adsorption and discharged back into the harbour. Last, an environmental cap will be built of layers of several materials including aggregates of various sizes, geotextile and geogrid, wickdrains, and surface materials (asphalt and/or concrete), placed sequentially from bottom to top in order to contain toxic sediment in the facility. The clean-up project will cost a total of $138.9 million and set to be completed in 2022, with the containment expected to have a 200-year lifespan. Environment and Climate Change Canada, and the Ontario Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change, each committed $46.3 million, with the final third of funding coming from the City of Hamilton ($14 million), the City of Burlington ($2.3 million), Halton Region ($2 million), the Hamilton Port Authority ($14 million), and Stelco ($14 million). Burlington Shipping Canal The opening from Hamilton Harbour to Lake Ontario is referred to as the Burlington Shipping Canal. It was purposed in 1824 and opened in 1826. Burlington Canal Lift Bridge is a lift bridge the spans over the canal. Infrastructure The bay today is crossed by two highways: 403 & Queen Elizabeth Way (QEW). The Burlington Bay James N. Allan Skyway (nicknamed \\"The Skyway\\") bridge, part of the QEW, crosses the border between Hamilton Harbour and Lake Ontario. The 403, York Street and a number of railways cross Hamilton Harbour on an glacial sandbar (similar in formation to the present day beach strip to the east) and separates Cootes Paradise from Hamilton Harbour. The harbour also houses the Port of Hamilton which is the busiest Canadian Great Lakes port and handles in excess of 10 million tonees of cargo per year.  Legend  The bay is thought by some to host a North American cryptid, described by witnesses as a large snake-like creature. A diver drowned in the bay during the filming of a low-budget horror film titled Marina Monster on August 21, 2005. References External links  * Hamilton Harbour (1826-1901), by Ivan S.

Advancement Born in London, the son of Andrew Stone, a London goldsmith. He was educated at Westminster School and Christ Church, Oxford. Having taken holy orders, his advancement in the Church was very rapid, mainly through the influence of his older brother Andrew Stone. Andrew's connections with George II made him able to promote the preferment of his brother George, who went to Ireland as chaplain to Lionel Sackville, 1st Duke of Dorset when that nobleman became Lord Lieutenant of Ireland in 1731. In 1733 Stone was made Dean of Ferns, and in the following year he exchanged this deanery for that of Derry. In 1740 he became Bishop of Ferns and Leighlin, in 1743 Bishop of Kildare, in 1745 Bishop of Derry, and in 1747 Archbishop of Armagh. During the two years that he occupied the See of Kildare he was also Dean of Christ Church, Dublin. Primate of All Ireland From the moment that he became Primate of All Ireland, Stone proved himself more a politician than an ecclesiastic. \\"He was said to have been selfish, worldly-minded, ambitious and ostentatious; and he was accused, though very probably falsely, of gross private vice.\\" His aim was to secure political power, a desire which brought him into conflict with Henry Boyle, the Speaker of the Irish House of Commons, who had organized a formidable opposition to the government. The Duke of Dorset's reappointment to the Lord Lieutenancy in 1751, with his son Lord George Sackville as Chief Secretary for Ireland, strengthened the primate's position and enabled him to triumph over the popular party on the constitutional question as to the right of the Irish House of Commons to dispose of surplus Irish revenue, which the government maintained was the property of the Crown. When Dorset was replaced by the Duke of Devonshire in 1755, Boyle was raised to the peerage as Earl of Shannon and received a pension, and other members of the opposition also obtained pensions or places; and the archbishop, finding himself excluded from power, went into opposition to the government in alliance with John Ponsonby. These two, afterwards joined by the primate's old rival Lord Shannon, and usually supported by the Earl of Kildare, regained control of affairs in 1758, during the viceroyalty of the Duke of Bedford. In the same year Stone wrote a remarkable letter, preserved in the Bedford Correspondence (ii. 357), in which he speaks very despondingly of the material condition of Ireland and the distress of the people. The archbishop was one of the \\"undertakers\\" who controlled the Irish House of Commons, and although he did not regain the almost dictatorial power he had exercised at an earlier period, which had suggested a comparison between him and Cardinal Wolsey, he continued to enjoy a prominent share in the administration of Ireland until his death, which occurred in London on 19 December 1764. According to Horace Walpole, his death was due to ruining his constitution by an excess of food and alcohol. Historical observations Although this \\"much-abused prelate,\\" as Lecky calls him, was a firm supporter of the English government in Ireland, he was far from being a man of tyrannical or intolerant disposition. It was due to his influence that in the anti-tithe disturbances in Ulster in 1763 the government acted with conspicuous moderation, and that the movement was suppressed with very little bloodshed. He constantly favored a policy of conciliation towards the Roman Catholics, whose loyalty he defended at different periods of his career both in his speeches in the Irish House of Lords and in his correspondence with ministers in London. Philip Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield told him that he was the only man with the political skills to rule Ireland, but in a dig at his irregular private life, said that it would help if he became a clergyman. Archbishop Stone, who never married, was a man of remarkably handsome appearance; and his manners were \\"eminently seductive and insinuating.\\" Richard Cumberland, who was struck by the \\"Polish magnificence\\" of the primate, speaks in the highest terms of his courage, tact, and qualities as a popular leader. Horace Walpole, who gives an unfavourable picture of his private character, acknowledges that Stone possessed \\"abilities seldom to be matched\\", and give him credit for charity and generosity; and he had the distinction of being mentioned by David Hume as one of the only two men of mark who had perceived merit in that author's History of England on its first appearance. He was himself the author of several volumes of sermons which were published during his lifetime. References *Richard Mant, History of the Church of Ireland, vol. ii. (London, 1840) *J. A.

He is the owner and executive chef of several restaurants: Mesa Grill in Las Vegas; Bar Americain in New York and at Mohegan Sun; Bobby Flay Steak in Atlantic City; Gato in New York, and Bobby's Burger Palace in 19 locations across 11 states. Flay has hosted several Food Network television programs, appeared as a guest and hosted a number of specials on the network. Flay is also featured on the Great Chefs television series. President Obama in 2009 Early life and education Flay was born on December 10, 1964, in New York City to Bill and Dorothy Barbara (McGuirk) Flay. He was raised on the Upper East Side neighborhood of Manhattan.Profile, biography.com; accessed June 2, 2015. He is a fourth generation Irish American and was raised Catholic, attending denominational schools. At age 8, Flay asked for an Easy-Bake Oven for Christmas, despite his father's objections; his father thought that a G.I. Joe would be more gender-appropriate. He received them both. Career Flay dropped out of high school at age 17. He has said his first jobs in the restaurant industry were at a pizza parlor and Baskin-Robbins. He then took a position making salads at Joe Allen Restaurant in Manhattan's Theater District, where his father was a partner. The proprietor, Joe Allen, was impressed by Flay's natural ability and agreed to pay his partner's son's tuition at the French Culinary Institute. Flay received a degree in culinary arts and was a member of the first graduating class of the French Culinary Institute in 1984. After culinary school, he started working as a sous-chef, quickly learning the culinary arts. At the Brighton Grill on Third Avenue, Flay was handed the executive chef's position after a week when the executive chef was fired. Flay quit when he realized he was not ready to run a kitchen. He took a position as a chef working for restaurateur Jonathan Waxman at Bud and Jams. Waxman introduced Flay to southwestern and Cajun cuisine, which came to define his culinary career. After working for a short time on the floor at the American Stock Exchange, Flay returned to the kitchen as the executive chef at Miracle Grill in the East Village, where he worked from 1988 to 1990. He caught the attention of restaurateur Jerome Kretchmer, who was looking for a southwestern-style chef. Impressed by Flay's food, Kretchmer offered him the position of executive chef at Mesa Grill, which opened on January 15, 1991. Shortly after, he became a partner. In November 1993, Flay partnered with Laurence Kretchmer to open Bolo Bar & Restaurant in the Flatiron District, just a few blocks away from Mesa Grill. Entrance sign to Mesa Grill in Caesars Palace, Las Vegas Mesa Grill at Las Vegas Flay opened a second Mesa Grill at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas in 2004, and in 2005 he opened Bar Americain, an American Brasserie, in Midtown Manhattan. He continued to expand his restaurants by opening Bobby Flay Steak in the Borgata Hotel Casino & Spa in Atlantic City, New Jersey. This was followed by a third Mesa Grill in the Bahamas, located in The Cove at Atlantis Paradise Island, which opened on March 28, 2007. The Las Vegas Mesa Grill earned Flay his only Michelin Star in 2008, which was taken away in the 2009 edition. Michelin did not publish a 2010 or 2011 Las Vegas edition, so the star could not be re-earned. Bolo Bar & Restaurant closed its doors on December 31, 2007, to make way for a condominium. Aside from his restaurants and television shows, Flay has been a master instructor and visiting chef at the French Culinary Institute. Although he is not currently teaching classes, he occasionally visits when his schedule permits. Flay established the Bobby Flay Scholarship in 2003. This full scholarship to the French Culinary Institute is awarded annually to a student in the Long Island City Culinary Arts Program. Flay personally helps select the awardee each year. Flay opened Bobby's Burger Palace (BBP) in Lake Grove, Long Island on July 15, 2008. The restaurant is located at the Smith Haven Mall. A second location opened on December 5, 2008 at the Monmouth Mall in Eatontown, New Jersey, and a third location opened March 31, 2009 in The Outlets at Bergen Town Center in Paramus, New Jersey. His fourth shop opened at the Mohegan Sun Casino in southeast Connecticut on July 1, 2009, which is also the location of his second Bar Americain, which opened on November 18, 2009. His fifth location of the burger chain opened in Philadelphia's University City on April 6, 2010. The sixth location of Bobby's Burger Palace opened in Washington, D.C., at 2121 K Street in Northwest on August 16, 2011. On December 5, 2011, Flay opened the ninth location of Bobby's Burger Palace in Roosevelt Field Mall in Garden City, New York. Flay opened the tenth and largest Bobby's Burger Palace site at Maryland Live! Casino in Hanover, Maryland, on June 7, 2012. Bobby's Burger Palace also has an 11th location, in College Park, Maryland. In total, BBP has nineteen locations in eleven states and the District of Columbia. The original Mesa Grill in New York closed in September 2013 following a proposed rent increase by the landlord. As of September 2019, Flay has an estimated net worth of $30 million. Television, film, and radio=Great Chefs Flay has been featured in several episodes of Great Chefs television including: * Great Chefs ‚Äì Great Cities * Mexican Madness DVD * Great Chefs Cook American Food Network Flay has hosted sixteen cooking shows and specials on Food Network and Cooking Channel: Flay served as a judge on Wickedly Perfect, The Next Food Network Star, and The Next Iron Chef. He has cooked on Emeril Live and Paula's Party. =Throwdown! with Bobby Flay= On Throwdown! with Bobby Flay, the chef challenges cooks renowned for a specific dish or type of cooking to a cook-off of their signature dish. On Episode 5 of Season 4, Harlem chef Melba Wilson and Bobby squared off over who had the best chicken and eggnog waffles. While being interviewed on \\"Conversations with Allan Wolper\\" on WGBO 88.3FM, Wilson confessed that she had been nervous because Bobby brought a cast iron skillet. Having grown up in a family that used cast iron skillets, Wilson was nonetheless forced to use a deep fryer because her restaurant was too small for a cast iron skillet. Towards the end of the anecdote, she explained, \\"Can I tell you? When he pulled out the skillet, it was a rough day. Girlfriend started sweating bullets. But at the end of the day, we threw down ‚Äì I don't know, I think it was the eggnog ‚Äì and I won.\\" =Iron Chef= Flay was an Iron Chef on the show Iron Chef America. In 2000, when the original Iron Chef show traveled to New York for a special battle, he challenged Iron Chef Masaharu Morimoto to battle rock crab. After the hour battle ended, Flay stood on top of his cutting board and raised his arms in what one journalist wrote was \\"in premature victory\\". As Morimoto felt that real chefs consider cutting boards and knives as sacred, and being offended by Flay's flamboyant gesture, he criticized his professionalism, saying that Flay was \\"not a chef\\". Flay went on to lose the battle. Flay challenged Morimoto to a rematch in Morimoto's native Japan. This time, Flay won. Flay and Morimoto, both Iron Chefs on Iron Chef America teamed ‚Äì took on and won ‚Äì against fellow Iron Chefs Mario Batali and Hiroyuki Sakai in the Iron Chef America: Battle of the Masters \\"Tag Team\\" battle. On a special episode of Iron Chef America originally airing on November 12, 2006, Flay and Giada De Laurentiis faced off against, and were defeated by, Batali and Rachael Ray. This was the highest rated show ever broadcast on Food Network. Flay and Michael Symon defeated the team of Iron Chefs Cat Cora and Masaharu Morimoto in a special episode titled \\"Thanksgiving Showdown,\\" which originally aired on November 16, 2008. On November 29, 2009, Iron Chefs Morimoto and Flay faced off one-on-one again in Battle Egg Nog. The battle, which featured ice-carvers, was won by Morimoto by a single point.

The population was about 68,000 in 2016. The area was possibly settled originally by Celts, but was later taken over by the Romans, who called the town Cambodunum. Kempten is the oldest urban settlement (town) in Germany.History of Kempten  History = Pre-Roman  The Greek geographer Strabo mentions in 50 BC a town of the Celtic Estiones named Kambodunon. This is considered the oldest written reference of any German city. So far no archaeological evidence could be found that this Celtic settlement really existed.  Roman era  In 15 BC Roman troops led by Nero Claudius Drusus and his brother Tiberius conquered and destroyed an existing Celtic settlement. Later the settlement was named Cambodunum. In the following years the city was rebuilt on a classical Roman city plan with baths, forum and temples. Initially in wood, the city was later rebuilt in stone after a devastating fire that destroyed almost the entire city in the year 69 AD. The city possibly served as provincial capital of Raetia during the first century before Augsburg took over this role. Extensive archaeological excavations at the end of the 19th century and again during the 1950s at what were then the outskirts of Kempten unearthed the extensive structural foundations. The city was again destroyed in 233 AD by the Alemanni, a Suebic tribe. The original site of Cambodunum was then abandoned and the settlement moved to a strategically safer location on the Burghalde hill overlooking the river Iller. In the middle of the 5th century the last Roman troops had left the area and the city was entirely taken over by the Alemanni.  Middle Ages  After the Romans abandoned the settlement, it was moved from the hill down to the plains located next to the river Iller. In written sources, the town appears as Cambidano. Being still predominantly Alemannic, the town once more was destroyed by the Franks in 683 as a consequence of the city's support of an uprising against the Frankish kingdom. Around 700 a monastery ‚Äî Kempten Abbey ‚Äî was built, the first in the Allg√§u region, founded by two Benedictine monks from the Abbey of Saint Gall, Magnus von F√ºssen and Theodor. Audogar was the first abbot of the new Benedictine monastery. Through the financial and lobbyist support of Charlemagne‚Äôs wife Hildegard, an Allemannic princess, the monastery managed to become one of the most privileged of the Frankish Empire. After several ravages by the Magyars, Ulrich of Augsburg, bishop of Augsburg and also abbot of Kempten, began the rebuilding of the monastery and the city in 941. In 1213, Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II declared the abbots members of the Reichstag and granted the abbot the right to bear the title of Duke. However in 1289, King Rudolf I of Germany also granted special privileges to the urban settlement in the river valley, making it the Free Imperial City of Kempten. In 1525 the last property rights of the abbots in the Imperial City were sold in the so-called \\"Great Purchase\\", marking the start of the co- existence of two independent cities bearing the same name next to each other. More conflict arose after the Imperial City converted to Protestantism in direct opposition to the Catholic monastery (and Free City) in 1527.  Renaissance and Baroque to Modern Age  During the turmoil of the Thirty Years' War (1632‚Äì33), both cities were destroyed by the imperial forces and the Swedish troops respectively. In 16521652 ‚Äì St Lorenz Basilika, Kempten, Bavaria, archiseek Roman Giel of Gielsberg, the Abbot of Kempten, commissioned the architects Michael Beer and Johann Serro from Graub√ºnden to build St. Lorenz Basilica as a new church to serve the parish and monastery, including a representative residence for the Duke-Abbots. This is acknowledged as the first large church built in Germany after the end of the Thirty Years' War. During the Napoleonic Wars the Duke-Abbey and Imperial City came under Bavarian rule (1802‚Äì03). Finally, in 1819, the two rival cities were united into a single communal entity. The city was the location of a subcamp of the Dachau concentration camp during World War II.List of subcamps of Dachau, Glosk.com Claude (Claudius) Honor√© Desir√© Dornier born in Kempten im Allg√§u (May 14, 1884 - December 5, 1969) was a German aircraft engineer and founder of Dornier GmbH. His legacy remains in the few aircraft named after him, including the Dornier Do 18 and the 12-engine Dornier Do X flying boat, for decades the world's largest and most powerful airplane.
