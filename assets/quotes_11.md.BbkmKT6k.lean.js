Developed by screenwriter Gene L. Coon in 1967 for the original Star Trek (TOS) series, Klingons were swarthy humanoids characterized by prideful ruthlessness and brutality. Klingons practiced feudalism and authoritarianism, with a warrior caste relying on slave labor. With a greatly expanded budget for makeup and effects, the Klingons were completely redesigned for Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979), acquiring ridged foreheads. In subsequent television series and in later films, the militaristic traits of the Klingons were bolstered by an increased sense of honor and strict warrior code similar to those of bushido. Klingons are recurring antagonists in the 1960s television series Star Trek, and have appeared in all subsequent series, along with ten of the Star Trek feature films. Initially intended to be antagonists for the crew of the USS Enterprise, the Klingons became a close ally of humanity in Star Trek: The Next Generation. In the 1990s series Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, humans and Klingons join with the Romulans to fight the Dominion. Among the elements created for the revised Klingons was a complete Klingon language, developed by Marc Okrand from gibberish suggested by actor James Doohan. Spoken Klingon has entered popular culture, even to the extent that some of the works of William Shakespeare and parts of the Bible have been translated into it. A dictionary, a book of sayings, and a cultural guide to the language have been published. According to the Guinness World Records, Klingon is the world's most popular fictional language as measured by number of speakers. Design =Conception= Two Klingon men and a Klingon woman as they appear in the Star Trek: The Original Series episode \\"Day of the Dove\\". The bronzed skin, facial hair, lack of ridged foreheads, and simple costumes are typical of The Original Series. The Klingons were created by screenwriter Gene L. Coon, and first appeared in the Star Trek episode \\"Errand of Mercy\\" (1967). They were named after Lieutenant Wilbur Clingan, who served with Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry in the Los Angeles Police Department. In the original television series (TOS), Klingons were typically portrayed with bronze skin and facial hair suggestive of Asian people, and possessed physical abilities similar to humans (in fact, Coon's only physical description of them in his \\"Errand of Mercy\\" script is \\"oriental\\" and \\"hard- faced\\"). The swarthy look of Klingon males was created with the application of shoe polish and long, thin moustaches; budget constraints limited creativity. The overall look of the aliens, played by white actors, suggested orientalism, at a time when memories of Japanese actions during World War II were still fresh. The production crew never came to an agreement on the name \\"Klingon\\"; Coon was adamant about keeping the name, and it persisted because no one else offered up a better name.Special Features, \\"Klingons: Conjuring the Legend.\\" The Klingons took on the role of the Soviet Union with the fictional government the United Federation of Planets playing the role of the United States. As such, they were generally portrayed as inferior to the crew of the Enterprise. While occasionally capable of honour, this depiction treated the Klingons as close to wild animals. Overall, they were shown without redeeming qualities‚Äîbrutish, scheming, and murderous. Klingons became the primary antagonists of the Enterprise crew, in part because the makeup necessary to make another alien race, the Romulans, was too time-consuming and costly.Reeves-Stevens, 35. For the first two seasons, no Klingon ships were seen despite being frequently mentioned. This was because of budget constraints; designer Matt Jefferies did not have the money to create a Klingon ship until the third season. When the episodes were remastered beginning in 2006, Klingon ships were digitally inserted into shots earlier than their original appearances. =Redesign= For Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979), the Klingons' appearance was radically changed. To give the aliens a more sophisticated and threatening demeanor, the Klingons were depicted with ridged foreheads, snaggled and prominent teeth, and a defined language and alphabet. Lee Cole, a production designer, used red gels and primitive shapes in the design of Klingon consoles and ship interiors, which took on a dark and moody atmosphere. The alphabet was designed as angular, with sharp edges alluding to the Klingons' militaristic focus. Costume designer Robert Fletcher created new uniforms for the Klingons, reminiscent of feudal Japanese armor. Certain elements of Klingon culture, resembling Japanese culture with honor at the forefront, were actually first explored with the script for the planned two-part \\"Kitumba\\" episode for the unproduced 1978 Star Trek: Phase II series. Writer John Meredyth Lucas said, \\"I wanted something that we had never seen before on the series, and that's a penetration deep into enemy space. I started to think of how the Klingons lived. Obviously for the Romulans we had Romans, and we've had different cultures modeled on those of ancient Earth, but I tried to think of what the Klingon society would be like. The Japanese came to mind, so basically that's what it was, with the Sacred Emperor, the Warlord and so on.\\" While no Klingon characters were seen in Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, their appearance as the central enemy in Star Trek III: The Search for Spock (1984) led to minor alterations. For the third generation of Klingons, the heavy, cragged head ridges of The Motion Picture were redesigned and made less pronounced. While Fletcher was happy with the original film uniforms, more had to be created as the old costumes had been lost, destroyed, or loaned out and altered irreparably. New costumes were fabricated, retaining the air of feudal Japanese design; Fletcher thought it was an important part of the Klingon authoritarian attitude.Reeves-Stevens, 226-228. New Klingon weaponry was designed, including an energy weapon and a special knife known as a d'k tahg. Michael Dorn and Robert O'Reilly as Worf and Gowron in an episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation, sporting Fletcher's costumes. Worf holds a knife known as a d'k tahg. The release of a new television series, Star Trek: The Next Generation, prompted a further revision in the depiction of Klingon culture, though Gene Roddenberry had wanted to avoid re-appearances of races from the old series. Set a century later than the original series, the USS Enterprise-D featured a Klingon crewmember, Worf. Makeup artist Michael Westmore needed a consistent reference to base the Klingon look on, as each individual Klingon was to have distinct head ridges. He found what he was looking for in a book of dinosaurs: observing dinosaur vertebrae laid out flat, Westmore cut the designs in half and modified them to suit each Klingon. Westmore designed his Klingons' beards to be Elizabethan, combining prehistoric and aristocratic elements to give audiences a feeling of depth from the appearance. Over time, Westmore and the other makeup artists designed different sizes of prosthetic headpieces which could be quickly applied and modified to save time; the amount of preparation to turn an actor into a Klingon decreased from around three hours to one. While important characters had custom headpieces, background actors used pre-made masks with minor touchup around the eyes and mouth. The Next Generation effects artist Dan Curry used his martial arts experience to create a flowing fighting style for the race. When the episode \\"Reunion\\" called for a special Klingon blade, Curry drew on Far East influences to develop a weapon known as the batleth. Curry, a collector of weapons, was annoyed by fictional weaponry that was designed to \\"look cool\\" but could not be handled practically. Curry combined elements of the Himalayan kukri, Chinese axes and fighting crescents to create a two- handed, curved weapon that has since been widely used in the franchise. The culture of the Klingons began to resemble revised western stereotypes of civilizations such as the Zulu, the Vikings, and various Native American nations ‚Äî as a proud, warlike and principled race. Whereas the TOS Klingons served as an allegory to contemporary totalitarian regimes, The Next Generation Klingons held principles more in line with Bushid≈ç; actor Michael Dorn stated that without the revision in Klingon culture, his character, Worf, would not have been a Starfleet officer. With the first Klingon-centric story in The Next Generation, the first-season episode \\"Heart of Glory\\", the Klingons once again became an important part of the Star Trek universe, and by the advent of the series Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, Klingons had become heroes rather than villains, though often at cross purposes to the Federation. The final Star Trek film to feature the entire cast from the original television series, Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country (1991) served to bridge the original series Klingons at war with the Federation to the time of The Next Generation, and presents a subtly different treatment of the race. At the time of the film's development, the Soviet Union was collapsing, and with the advent of glasnost, the old allegory of Klingons as Russians was becoming obsolete. The Klingons were redesigned to evoke the Nazis, with the red, white and black Klingon flag deliberately similar to that of the Nazi Party. The Klingons in the film liberally quote Shakespeare, a trait stemming from director Nicholas Meyer's comparison of the Empire's appropriation of Shakespeare to the Nazis' similar attempt in the 1930s. Meyer also felt it was apropos for Shakespearean actors such as Christopher Plummer and David Warner to speak the lines. The breakdown of the Klingons' empire because of a Chernobyl-like incident results in a new age for the Federation and Klingons, leading to the time of The Next Generation and later series where the two governments are trade partners and occasional allies.Kraemer, et al., 51. Starfleet members are shown to be highly bigoted against Klingons, who in turn feel that their way of life will be obliterated by peace. The Klingons were given new uniforms designed by Dodie Shepard, in part because there were not enough of Fletcher's The Motion Picture costumes to meet the demands of the film. Dorn described playing a Klingon as simple, joking that after hours sitting in a makeup chair, actors were highly motivated to get the dialogue right the first time. Repeat Klingon Robert O'Reilly told all neophyte Klingons that the most important part of speaking was to say the lines with belief and \\"go all the way\\". When O'Reilly and Dorn's character had a confrontation, makeup artists wiped spittle off each between takes, a consequence of the harsh-sounding language. Todd Bryant (Captain Klaa in Star Trek V: The Final Frontier) similarly noted that if an actor was projectile- spitting on others as he spoke Klingon, he was doing a great job. When filming The Undiscovered Country, Christopher Plummer asked director Nicholas Meyer to adapt his character's look, feeling the heavy forehead appliances looked rather fake. Instead, Plummer's character, General Chang, was made bald with subdued ridges and an eyepatch bolted to his skull. Plummer felt that the unique appearance helped \\"humanize\\" the character.Reeves-Stevens, 262‚Äì265. In contrast to white actors portraying the warriors, more recent Klingon roles have been predominantly played by black actors. For Star Trek: Discovery, the Klingon appearance was once again modified with more extensive facial and teeth prosthetics and elongated craniums. The new Klingons were initially bald, in contrast with the previous depictions, but this was retconned in season 2. The lack of hair was said to have been ceremonial during the time of war with the Federation, harking back to the tale of Kahless having cut off a lock of hair to forge the first bat'leth.https://www.newsweek.com/star-trek- discovery-season-2-klingons-hair-premiere-date-1160456 They also have black and purple skin color variations. =Change in appearance after TOS= According to the official Star Trek web site, the Klingons' varying appearance was \\"probably the single most popular topic of conversation among Star Trek fans\\". While the real reason for the discrepancy between The Original Series Klingons and their feature film and later television series counterparts was a lack of budget, fans took it upon themselves to contrive an acceptable canon reason for the sudden change. Among the fan theories, were that TOS Klingons were: * Humans raised as Klingons, similar to Janissaries (Christians kidnapped by the Ottoman Empire from ca. 1300s to 1800s) * Stripped of ridges via surgery for cosmetic or diplomatic reasons * Hybrids with a more human species, * Some subjugated race conscripted or deployed near the Federation border. Simple theories that the different Klingons were different racial breeds were complicated by the fact that the characters of Kang, Koloth, and Kor appeared with smooth features in the original series, yet had a ridged appearance in Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, and that Worf acknowledged the difference in appearances when the crew of Deep Space 9 returned to the 23rd century in the episode \\"Trials and Tribble-ations\\", but offered no explanation, saying merely, \\"We do not discuss it with outsiders.\\" A canonical explanation for the change was given in a two-part storyline on Star Trek: Enterprise, in the episodes \\"Affliction\\" and \\"Divergence\\" that aired in February 2005. Attempting to replicate experiments by humans to create augmented soldiers, Klingon scientists used genetic material from human test subjects on their own people, which resulted in a viral pandemic which caused Klingons to develop human-like physical characteristics. Dr. Phlox of the Enterprise formulated a cure for the virus, but the physical alterations remained in the populace and were inherited by offspring. Phlox indicated that \\"some day\\" the physical alterations could be reversed. The head scientist finally mentioned he would go into cranial reconstructive surgery, another nod to 'restoration' of the ridges for some Klingons. In the non-canon Star Trek: The Role Playing Game (FASA, 1982) the smooth-headed Klingons seen in the original series were called \\"fusions\\", in particular \\"human fusions\\", with \\"Romulan fusions\\" also existing. They were a deliberate blending of Klingon genes with those of other races in an effort to gain an understanding of, and thus advantage over, the other races. Human fusions were chosen for service on the Federation border due to the high number of humans present in the Federation. Fusions of both types were considered inferior to pure strain \\"Imperial Klingons\\" and were segregated. In the non-canon video game Star Trek Online, Klingons under the command of Ambassador B'vat once again attempt to fuse the DNA of other races with their own. In a chapter called \\"The Ultimate Klingon\\", the player character travels to the planet H'atoria in the Korvat System to infiltrate a secret Klingon research facility and discovers Amar Singh, a descendant of Khan Noonien Singh, has merged Klingon, Augment, and Gorn DNA to create a ferocious, mindless monstrosity the player must destroy. Singh is arrested and imprisoned at Facility 4028. Attributes =Biology= Klingons possess a robust and enduring biology as well as large and muscular statures. Klingons have been seen on multiple occasions possessing physical strength equal to or superior to that of Jem'Hadar and Hirogen, two other races possessing immense strength, and the half-human B'Elanna Torres proves more than a match for a Vulcan. Their anatomy is redundant and supernumerary; every organ has a backup, including an extra set of kidneys, an eight-chambered heart, a third lung, a secondary brain stem, as well as an extensive and hardy skeletal structure. This redundancy is evident even at the cellular level; for example, the Klingons have back-up synaptic networks in their nervous systems, allowing them to grow a new spine, as was demonstrated with Worf when his spine was surgically removed and replaced with a transplanted, genetically cloned new one. Their rapid metabolism allows injured Klingons to heal quickly. All of this makes Klingons extremely hardy and difficult to kill, as necessitated by their aggressive nature, and resistant to physical trauma, environmental exposure, and illness. Klingons alone have a natural resistance to \\"the Phage,\\" which plagues the Vidiians of the Delta Quadrant. Like Cardassians, they avoid cold temperatures. Klingons also have a heightened sense of smell as suggested in \\"Birthright, Part II\\" in The Next Generation, when Worf and a Klingon boy go hunting and can track an animal by scent. Klingon children are fierce and aggressive by nature; from as soon as they can walk, they are instructed into honing their hunting and combat skills, strengthening their physical prowess and agility. Like humans, they go through a form of puberty, which, as Picard puts it in Star Trek: Insurrection \\"hardly does it justice\\" and includes sudden bursts of hair growth, extreme mood swings, violent tendencies, and the Klingon equivalent of acne (called 'Gorch' in Klingon). =Culture= In comparison to The Original Series, Klingon culture is thoroughly examined in later series' episodes, part of a larger movement by Star Trek writers to deepen viewer understanding of the alien races of the franchise.Kraemer, et al., 60. The Klingons adhere to a strict code of honor, similar to feudal Mongolian or Japanese customs, although some, such as Gowron, appear to struggle to live up to their ideals. Their society is based on war and combat; ritual suicide is often preferred over living life as a crippled warrior, and may allow a warrior to die with honor. To be captured rather than killed in battle brings dishonor to not only the captive but his descendants. Death is depicted as a time for celebration, not grief. Klingons are depicted as a spiritual people. According to their legends, Klingons slew their own gods. The equivalents to heaven and hell are called Sto-Vo-Kor and Gre'Thor, respectively; in Sto-Vo-Kor, battle and feasting can be eternally won and shared, while those sent to Gre'Thor are condemned to eternal torture unless their honor is restored by living relatives. Those who do not die in battle may not enter Sto-Vo-Kor; relatives undertake quests to guarantee their deceased comrades entry into paradise. Despite believing in an afterlife, the Klingons perform a form of last rite. This consists of spreading the eyes open, humming in anticipation of the final breath and roaring skywards when the warrior dies, warning the dead a Klingon warrior is coming (as shown in \\"Heart of Glory\\"). Yet Klingons have no burial rites, and dispose of corpses by the most expedient means available, considering them \\"empty shells\\". The Klingons' spiritual leader is Kahless, a messianic historical figure who established early codes of honor and was the first Klingon emperor. His fabled weapon, the Sword of Kahless, is depicted as a unique batleth that serves as the Klingon equivalent of the Holy Grail. In the TNG episode \\"Rightful Heir\\", Kahless appears in the flesh to Worf, who had doubted his Klingon faith. This Kahless is revealed to be a clone, created in an attempt to bring Klingons together, and who is chosen to lead the Klingon people as a figurehead. =Language= Marc Okrand is the author of several books about the Klingon language, which he developed. The Klingons have their own language that was developed for the feature films, often described as \\"guttural\\". For The Motion Picture, James Doohan, the actor who portrayed Montgomery Scott, devised the initial Klingon-language dialogue heard in the film. For The Search for Spock, Marc Okrand, who created the Vulcan dialogue used in the previous film, developed an actual working Klingon language based on Doohan's original made-up words. Okrand was presented with a difficult task of contriving a language that sounded alien, while still simple enough for the actors to pronounce. While most constructed languages follow basic tenets of natural languages ‚Äî for example, all languages have an \\"ah\\" sound ‚Äî Okrand deliberately broke them. He chose the rarest form of sentence construction, the object-verb-subject form: the translation of the phrase \\"I boarded the Enterprise\\", would be constructed as \\"The Enterprise boarded I.\\" Okrand reasoned the language would be indicative of the culture - the Klingons' language focuses on actions and verbs, like Mongolian. Adjectives do not strictly exist; there is no word for \\"greedy\\", but there is a verb, qur, which means \\"to be greedy\\".Edwards, 4. The language does not contain the verb \\"to be\\", which meant Okrand had to create a workaround when director Nicholas Meyer wanted his Klingons to quote Shakespeare and the famous line \\"to be, or not to be\\" in The Undiscovered Country. Initially, Okrand came up with \\"to live or not live\\", but Plummer did not like the sound of the line. Okrand went back and revised the phrase to \\"taH pagh, taHbe' \\", roughly meaning \\"whether to continue, or not to continue [existence]\\". The Klingon language has a small vocabulary compared to natural languages, containing around 2,000 words after it had been created in the 1990s.Edwards, 5. After its initial creation, Okrand has frequently created new words, so that the total number of words has grown up to approximately 3,000. Okrand persuaded Pocket Books to publish The Klingon Dictionary in 1985; in it, Okrand elaborated on the Klingon language's grammar, syntax, and vocabulary. While Okrand expected the book to only sell as a novelty item, eleven years after publication it had sold 250,000 copies. Dedicated Klingon enthusiasts, some but not all of whom were Star Trek fans, created the Klingon Language Institute, which published multiple magazines in the language. While Paramount initially tried to stop the Institute from using its copyrighted language, the company eventually relented. The Institute has since published Klingon translations of Hamlet, Much Ado About Nothing, Tao Te Ching, Gilgamesh, and has translations of some books from the Bible on its website. The Bible proved to be difficult to translate, as Christian concepts like atonement‚Äîand words like God (until the recent addition of Qun meaning \\"god\\")‚Äîare not found in the Klingon vernacular. From time to time, Okrand has amended the \\"official\\" list of Klingon vocabulary due in part to requests from the Institute and other groups. Other Klingon groups run blood drives, bowling teams, and a golf championship. The Klingon language's prevalence is not limited to books; a three-disc video game, Star Trek: Klingon, requires players to learn the language to advance. In May 2009, a joint collaboration between the KLI, Simon & Schuster, and Ultralingua launched the Klingon Language Suite for the iPhone concurrent with the release of the new movie. The popularity of the language meant that in 1996 it was considered the fastest-growing constructed language, ahead of other languages such as Tolkien's Elvish or Esperanto. While the language is widespread, mastery of the language is extremely uncommon; there are only around a dozen fluent speakers of the language. Okrand himself is not fluent, and the actors who speak the language in the Star Trek series are more concerned with its expression than the actual grammar. According to the 2006 edition of Guinness World Records, Klingon is the most spoken fictional language by number of speakers, Klingon is one of many language interfaces in the Google search engine, and a Klingon character was included in the Wikipedia logo before its May 2010 update, when it was replaced by a Ge øez character. =Starships= As the Klingons are portrayed as a warrior culture, Klingon starships are usually depicted as warships, heavily armed with a variety of particle beam weaponry and antimatter warheads. Many Klingon ships also make use of cloaking technology to hide the vessel from view. The first Klingon ship design used in The Original Series, the D7-class battlecruiser, was designed by Matt Jefferies to evoke a predator's shape akin to that of a manta ray, providing a threatening and instantly recognizable form for viewers. The configuration of Jefferies' design featured a bulbous forward hull connected by a long boom to a wing-like main hull with the engine nacelles mounted on each wingtip. Later Klingon starships by other designers kept to this same overall configuration, although updated to reflect their respective time periods: Rick Sternbach's designs for The Next Generation and Deep Space Nine drew on elements of Starfleet ships features to reflect the alliance between the Federation and the Klingons,Star Trek: The Next Generation Companion, Larry Nemecek, pp. 146-47 while John Eaves' designs for Enterprise incorporated more rugged and primitive construction to make the vessels appear consistent with the earlier time period. =Homeworld= The Klingon homeworld has been given several names; according to Marc Okrand, the planet would have been referred to in several ways, just as Earth is referred to variously as \\"the world\\" or \\"Terra\\". Early Star Trek literature referred to the planet as Klinzhai, but The Next Generation episode \\"Heart of Glory\\" called the planet Kling. The film Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country established the name as Kronos; Okrand later devised the Klingon transliteration \\"Qo'noS\\". In Star Trek Into Darkness, the planet's name is both spelled and spoken by Starfleet personnel as Kronos. According to the non-canon \\"Klingon for the Galactic Traveler\\", Qo'noS (said to be in the Omega Leonis star system) is depicted as green when viewed from space. It includes a lone, huge land mass with a vast ocean, a severely tilted axis that causes wild seasonal changes, a turbulent atmosphere and extremes of both warm and frigid weather. The planet is also home to the Capital City of the Klingon Empire, which features prominently in several episodes of The Next Generation and Deep Space Nine. In Star Trek Into Darkness, one province of Qo'noS is depicted as an unpopulated and abandoned post-industrial sprawl. A moon, Praxis, about 1/4 of the diameter of Qo'noS is seen in orbit. Its destruction was a plot point in the film The Undiscovered Country, the after-effects driving the plot of the film and later events in the television series Star Trek: The Next Generation.

While his body lies on a public wake, both brothers sob and hug tenderly, after which one of them sneaks out of the funeral parlor, goes to the father's office, opens the office's safe and steals the cash inside it. On his way out, he's confronted by his brother, who points a gun at him. They exchange words about their individual relationship, as well as how they related to their father and how his widow would not deserve any part of the old man's estate. They start to argue and get into a physical confrontation. One of the brothers shoots the other, but the wounded one shoots back the other in return with a gun he pulls from his coat. At the end, all three family members lie in caskets at the funeral parlor as the young widow wickedly smiles at the camera. * Negocio redondo ‚Äì Don Marcos, the lead of a construction company (and a lecherous old man who constantly imagines women around him being naked) visits the local Roman Catholic archbishop. They are discussing the last details of a land plot's purchase. Don Marcos tries to outsmart the archbishop when they negotiate the contract's terms, but the archbishop proves to be a clever negotiator. Once they sign the contract and the deal is closed, Don Marcos returns to his office, but has second thoughts and asks his chauffeur to drive him back to the archbishop's office. He asks for a private audience to confess his sins, to which the archbishop agrees. Besides conceding on his lewd behavior, Don Marcos reveals the archbishop that the plot he has sold to the church is overvalued, since a major road will soon run through it. The archbishop threatens to sue him and his company, to which Don Marcos reminds him that this fact has been revealed to him under confession, and therefore, cannot be revealed under penalty of excommunion. The archbishop reluctantly absolves the manager of his sins, and Don Marcos returns to his office, expressionless. * La Gran Noche ‚Äì an aging prostitute is being teased by her fellow sex workers on the bordello they all work at. By now, no client asks for her services. One night, a handsome young man shows up, rejects the offers from the other prostitutes, and takes the aging one for a dance but not before earning general admiration from everyone by disposing of a drunk rude customer. They leave the premises under the surprised looks of all the attendants. They stop at a park, where she is dropped by the customer (the vignette has been acted silently up to this point). The customer dismisses her rudely after she pays him, but not before pulling a knife on her over a disagreement on money matters; it turns out she had paid him to act the entire time. When she sits at a bench to ponder her future, a gallant old man plays compliment to her \\"beautiful eyes\\", provoking a tender smile in her. * Entre doce y una ‚Äì Business partners Alberto and Carlos chat in their high rise building office as Carlos uncomfortably expects Alberto to abandon the place. Suddenly, Alberto's stunningly beautiful wife, Annette, appears at the scene to the apparent surprise of both men, after which they all go out together to lunch. After they get into an elevator car, a severe earthquake hits the city. The car loses power, and when they try to escape through a hatch on the top, they find the elevator's cables are frayed (and at least one has snapped). While they scream for help (and somebody offers to get them out in a matter of hours) tempers flare and the cables keep on snapping. Calmly resigned to a certain death and having some time to spend, the couple reveal each other their indiscretions. After Alberto confesses his infidelities, Annette tells him not only that she has also been unfaithful, she reveals that Carlos is her lover at the present time and that she came to meet him at the office while Alberto was supposed to be somewhere else when she arrived. Since nothing of that seemed to matter anymore, now that they are going to die, a repentant Alberto surprisingly forgives Annette and Carlos, hugging them in an emotionally tearful and tender final moment which is abruptly broken by an external voice shouting good news: help is coming ! Happiness and relief invades them, knowing they will survive the ordeal but after what seems to be a new beginning in life for them all, Alberto says that the way he behaved before was a weakness due to the death scare, that it means nothing now and starts hinting that everything changes, more so after what he already knows about his cheating wife and his partner. To the amazement of Carlos and Annette, who are sincerely regretful and remorseful about their actions, Alberto turns into his older vengeful self, angrily implying he wants to be by himself with nothing to do with them anymore. Both men fight, causing the elevator to shake as the remaining cable snaps, resulting in the elevator car plummeting down. * La Otra ‚Äì Fernando, a traveling salesman, appears in alternate scenes with two women. The older woman, Josefina, reminds him to take care of his health, offers him dinner, and looks after him at home; the younger one, Marie, is constantly interested in having passionate sex with him. He seems to be an absentee partner to both, and each one resents his absences. One day Marie finds Fernando with Josefina, and they have a quarrel; it turns out that Josefina, the older, domestically oriented woman, is the man's lover, while sex-hungry Marie is the wife. He then sets the record 'straight' by divorcing his young wife, marrying his older lover... and remains domestic to Josefina while still having frequent sexual episodes with Marie.

It held that for there to be an effective assumption of responsibility, there must be some direct or indirect conveyance that a director had done so, and that a claimant had relied on the information. Otherwise only a company itself, as a separate legal person, would be liable for negligent information. Facts Mr Williams and his partner approached Natural Life Health Foods Ltd with a proposal. They wanted to get a franchise for a health food shop in Rugby (i.e. they wanted to use the Natural Life brand to run a new store and pay Natural Life Ltd a fixed fee). Mr Williams was given a brochure with financial projections. They entered the scheme. They failed, and lost money. So Mr Williams sued the company, alleging that the advice they got was negligent. However, before the suit could be completed, Natural Life Health Foods Ltd went into liquidation. So Mr Williams sought to hold the company's managing director and main shareholder personally liable. This was Mr Mistlin, who in the brochure had been held out as having a lot of expertise. Mr Mistlin had made the brochure projections, but had not been in any of the negotiations with Mr Williams. The High Court allowed Mr Williams claim, and so did the Court of Appeal by a majority. The company and Mr Mistlin appealed to the House of Lords. Judgment The House of Lords held unanimously that Mr Williams' claim would fail. They emphasised that there had been no separate assumption of responsibility directly to Mr Williams, and no requisite reliance. Lord Steyn's judgment was as follows.

Factotum is both an arts organisation and artists' project that was formed in 2001 by Stephen Hackett and Richard West. They publish The Vacuum newspaper, put on exhibitions, publish books and make films. In the past they have also run a choir, staged contemporary dance events and organised talks. In 2005 Factotum won a Paul Hamlyn Award for the Visual Arts and participated in Northern Ireland's first showing in the Venice Biennale. In 2007 they were selected for the Irish Curated Visual Arts Award by the artist Mike Nelson. Factotum's work often involves collaborating with a wide range of other arts organisations, artists and writers.  Cultural history  Factotum are based in Belfast and their work is often about the city and its history. In 2003 they produced a book and CD called Belfast Songs in which a number of writers, including Glenn Patterson, Paul Muldoon and Leontia Flynn, each wrote about famous songs representing the city. Factotum's work is sometimes documentary or archival in nature, as in their 2005 photographic exhibition 'The English', which was largely made up of previously unseen photographs from the Imperial War Museum's archive of the British army in Northern Ireland in the 1970s and 80s. Their treatment of this historical material can involve an implied cultural criticism in the way it is recontextualised. The Factotum Choir, for example, sang a repertoire made up of songs in praise of Stalin (such as Ewan MacColl's \\"Ballad of Stalin\\"), corporate songs (\\"Fokker on the Wing\\") and national anthems for countries that no longer exist (such as Rhodesia). Factotum's exhibitions and publications can also be explicit in criticising attempts to rebrand and redevelop Belfast and the role of marketing and Public Relations in general, as in their 2008 show 'A Century of Spin' about PR photography.  Parody and satire  As well as presenting historical material, Factotum's work also frequently involves elements of satire and parody. A special 'Cobbled Quarter' supplement to The Vacuum closely resembled the corporate freesheet 'Laganlines' published by the Laganside quango to promote their newly branded 'Cathedral Quarter'. It included such events as 'Hermitfest' and the 'Festival of Pathetic Maritime Disasters' much like the facepainting and Titanic themed events in the quango's publicity material. Sometimes it is not easy to distinguish between documentary and spoof elements of Factotum projects. In 2006 they put on an exhibition about the Factotum Choir in the Project Arts CentreInformation about the Factotum Choir exhibition at the Project Arts Centre. in Dublin (subsequently toured to other venues). This exhibition contained film clips, artefacts (like record covers and a desiccated cat) and an extensive history of the Choir from the 1950s to 2000. Reviewers of the exhibition have been divided as to whether the material in the exhibition is genuine or fabricated.Article in Hot Press magazine about the Factotum Choir Exhibition. In 2009 Factotum organised an exhibition called 'Northern Ireland Unseen Offscreen' as part of the Belfast Film Festival. The exhibition was of posters for films made in Northern Ireland that were never completed or have subsequently been forgotten and included such titles as 'Cannibal Begorrah' (a horror film set in Fermanagh), 'An Ulster American Folk Park in London' (An 80s small town/ big city corporate drama), 'Dafty Wains Go Buck Mental' (An Ulster Scots gross-out comedy) and 'King Billy's Pink Adventure' (a 70s art house film). Reviewers of this exhibition have expressed scepticism as to how much, if any, of this material is genuine. The building once used had the \\"headless dog\\" image on the brickwork outside. The scions of Hilden Brewery family set up College Green Brewery (though, in fact, a restaurant and not a brewery - ales are supplied by Hilden Brewery) and used the image as the logo for their \\"Headless Dog\\" ale.http://marksalehouse.com/hildenbrewery.php  Ditching  In 2009 Factotum released the feature film Ditching, a story about two people going on a journey across Northern Ireland in a desolate post-apocalyptic future.

Called the \\"King of Czech comic books\\", from the late 1960s he was considered one of the top artists of Czech comics.Mal√° (2004), p. 268. He was highly influential as part of popular culture prior to 1989. He was the twin brother of Jan Saudek, internationally known as a photographer and painter.  Biography  Karel and Jan Saudek were born in Prague in 1935, twin sons of Gustav Saudek, who was Jewish, and his Czech (Slavic) wife. Both of their families originated in Bohemia; Gustav was born in Decin. After the Nazis invaded Czechoslovakia during World War II, the family was subject to the racial persecution the Germans directed against Jews and Slavs. K√°ja and his brother Jan were imprisoned with other Mischlinge (mixed-blood) children in the Nazi concentration camp Lu≈æa in Poland.Mr√°zkov√° (2005), p. 475. Many of their Jewish family members died in the Theresienstadt concentration camp in Czechoslovakia, where their father was deported in February 1945, but both brothers and their father survived to return to Prague and rebuild their lives. K√°ja Saudek in his atelier in the mid-1980s. Saudek had become familiar with American comics in his early years. He was first inspired mainly by the works of Walt Disney. After the war, as the Communists dominated government and society behind the Iron Curtain, enforced by the Soviet Union, Saudek was also influenced by American artists Robert Crumb and Richard Corben. He became a technical writer and in 1950s worked as a scene- shifter at the Barrandov Film Studios. There he met the actress Olga Schoberov√° and featured her as a model of his comic character \\"sexy Jessie\\", who became one of his best known characters. He and Olga dated for a time. In 1966, the film director Milo≈° Macourek used some of Saudek's comic drawings in the film Kdo chce zab√≠t Jessii? (Who Wants to Kill Jessie?), which featured Schoberov√° as Jessie. During his work on this film, Saudek met his future wife Hana. Saudek's works became increasingly popular in the Czechoslovakia. In the 1960s he created comics drawings for the magazine Popmusic Express (Underground Com-comix), as well as illustrations to the scripts by Jaroslav Foglar, Ond≈ôej Neff and others. He was influential in the expanding popular culture of the country. Saudek drew from family and friends in creating his comic characters. In 1969 he published a part of the comic series Muriel a andƒõl√© (Muriel and Angels). The album depicts the story of a young physician Muriel, who meets an angel Ro, coming from a distant future. Ro attempts to introduce her to a world without hate, evil people, or death. (He modeled Muriel on actress Olga Schoberov√° and used his brother Jan for the antagonist general Xenon.) The communist censors believed the story to be politically suspect and banned its publication. \\"P≈ô√≠bƒõh o lodn√≠ l√©ka≈ôce, je≈æ zachr√°n√≠ andƒõla, kter√Ω j√≠ p≈ôedstav√≠ svƒõt bez nen√°visti, zl√Ωch lid√≠ i smrti, vystra≈°il dobovou cenzuru, a tak komiks Muriel a andƒõl√©, nakreslen√Ω podle sc√©n√°≈ôe Milo≈°e Macourka, nakonec vy≈°el poprv√© a≈æ v roce 1991.\\" Saudek's style was considered to be too \\"American\\"; some of his critics labelled his work as an example of bourgeois kitsch. \\"V komunistick√©m ƒåeskoslovensku se Saudek c√≠til jako cizinec ve vlastn√≠ zemi, jeho tvorba byla p≈ô√≠li≈° \\"americk√°\\", jej√≠ kritikov√© ji oznaƒçovali za bur≈æoazn√≠ k√Ωƒç.\\" The complete cycle of Muriel was published in 1991, after the change in governments. In 1971 Saudek contributed to the film ƒåty≈ôi vra≈ædy staƒç√≠, drahou≈°ku (Four Murders is enough, Honey) with his comic drawings. At the beginning of the 1970s, Saudek worked as an illustrator for the Czechoslovak magazine Mlad√Ω svƒõt. His series Lips Tullian, inspired by 19th-century adventure stories, was banned by the party censors. They began to be more critical of Saudek's collaboration with the popular magazine, gradually restricting his work, and banning it altogether in the mid-1970s. \\"Spolupr√°ce s ƒçesk√Ωmi ƒçasopisy v≈°ak byla napad√°na \\"ofici√°ln√≠ kritikou\\" (to je kritikou s n√≠≈æ bylo zak√°z√°no polemizovat) a postupnƒõ p≈ô√≠kazy \\"shora\\" omezov√°na, a≈æ v polovinƒõ sedmdes√°t√Ωch let byla zlikvidov√°na √∫plnƒõ.\\" From 1976 to 1978, Saudek created a comics series to the theme of Thirty Cases of Major Zeman, a popular Czechoslovak action-drama television series. The original TV series was intended as political propaganda to support official communist positions. The Ministry of Interior rejected Saudek's adaptation and refused to allow publication, because the officials thought that the style seemed too \\"American\\" and there was too much \\"shooting\\" in it. \\"Spoleƒçnƒõ jsme to nosili na ministerstvo vnitra do kachl√≠k√°rny na Letn√© ke schv√°len√≠.

In 1979, Saudek began his collaboration with the Czech Speleological Society; the Society sponsored publication of several of his comics series in the following decade. In the 1980s Saudek also co-created a popular TV series, Okna vesm√≠ru doko≈ô√°n, together with Vladim√≠r ≈Ωelezn√Ω and Ji≈ô√≠ Grygar. The series was produced by the Slovak Television. At the beginning of the 1990s, following the fall of the communist regime in Czechoslovakia, many of Saudek's works were published in new editions. He collaborated with the comics journal Kometa (The Comet) and also with the erotic magazine NEI Report. Saudek continued his work. But in April 2006 he suffered a bad accident that left him in a coma. He was hospitalised in the Prague hospital Motol, and died on 26 June 2015.

Biography Born in Versailles in 1932, trained in Paris at Met- de-Penninghen's workshop (Julian Academy), then at the M√©tiers d'Art with Darnat, Pigot finally opted for painting. In 1956, she left for Africa and presented her first exhibition in Dakar, Senegal. She also taught plastic arts in Abidjan, Ivory Coast. These four \\"African\\" years leave an indelible imprint on her work. In 1964, she met Stanley William Hayter and worked 6 years on engraving techniques at his \\"Atelier 17\\"http://www.ateliercontrepoint.com/a171.html in Paris. This encounter had a decisive influence on the rest of her work, which can be defined as the search for the synthesis between the lyrical and geometric abstraction of the fifties and the contemporary figurative. She lived in seclusion from 1970 onwards in a village of the Dr√¥me in the south-east of France, where she opened a printmaking workshop. In 1982, she visited India and stayed in an ashram. Claude Pigot's work the gained in strength and matures into its own symbolism. In 1987, she moved to New York City and worked at the Printmaking Workshop of Robert Blackburn, lithographer, ex-student of S. W. Hayter, and leading figure of New-York printmaking. She also taught at The Children's Storefront, a tuition-free independent school in Harlem. She returned to France in 2000 and continued to create until about one year prior to her demise.

They are typically classified as oxisols (USDA soil taxonomy) or ferralsols (World Reference Base for Soil Resources). It is largely correct to say that latosols are tropical soils, but the reverse is not true because there are many soils in the tropics that are not latosolic. Latosols are red or yellowish-red in colour throughout and they do not have distinct horizons like a podsol. The red colour comes from the iron oxides in the soil. They are deep soils, often 20-30 m deep whereas podsols are 1-2 m deep. The soil generally contains a thin but very fertile layer of humus dropped from plants and animals in the forest above, followed by an infertile second layer due to rapid leaching in the high rainfall. The third level, weathered bedrock, is common to almost all soil types. The latosol is completely reliant on the rainforest to maintain fertility, as all nutrients leach away quickly when the forest is felled and the layer of humus is no longer being replaced.

Based on a story by Virginia Van Upp, the film is about a beautiful Viennese refugee seeking United States citizenship who arranges a marriage of convenience with a struggling writer. The film's title derives from the opening line of Christopher Marlowe's poem \\"The Passionate Shepherd to His Love\\" (\\"Come live with me and be my love\\"). Plot Johnny Jones (Lamarr), a native of Vienna, Austria who escaped after its annexation by Nazi Germany, is having an affair with the married Barton Kendrick (Ian Hunter), a publisher. One night an officer from the Department of Immigration finds her and tells her that she will be deported because her temporary passport expired three months ago. The investigator tells her that if she can be married within a week, she can stay. Bill Smith (Stewart), a down-on-his-luck writer, runs into Jones in a diner during a rainstorm. She explains to him that she needs to marry an American citizen within a week and since he is broke, she could pay him and they would both get what they need. She pays him $17.80 a week in exchange for marrying her. Two months later, Smith is writing a book about the odd circumstances of his marriage and becomes curious about Jones, considering he only sees her once a week when she gives him a check. Meanwhile, Jones is continuing her affair with Kendrick, but refuses to tell him how she has remained in the country. He tells Jones that he is leaving his wife and wants to marry Jones within two months. She tells Bill she wants a divorce right away, which he reluctantly agrees to. Smith finishes his book and sends it to Kendrick's publishing company, where Kendrick's wife Diane (Verree Teasdale) explains the book to Kendrick and he realizes that Smith is Jones' husband. Kendrick's chooses to publish the book and gives Smith $500 up front. After seeing Kendrick's reaction to the book, his wife realizes that he has been having an affair and that the book is real. Mrs. Kendrick decides to divorce him, but wants to make sure that Jones is actually in love with her husband first. Meanwhile, Smith buys a new car and coerces Jones to go on a trip with him before he will sign the divorce papers. She ends up falling in love with Bill while on vacation, after meeting his family. Kendrick comes to Smith's grandmother's house in the middle of the night and Jones is forced to make the decision about who she wants, and she picks Bill.

Retrieved at September 6, 2011 Biography = Early years and police career= Bogomil Bonev was born on September 18, 1957, in Radomir. He graduated Radmir Electronics Technical High School with a golden medal in 1977. After serving time as a soldier in the School for Officers from the reserve in Pleven, he graduated the Higher Officers Academy of the Ministry of Interior in 1981, being the top graduate of that year. For this reason, in spite of the existing practice at that time, he was appointed directly in the Criminal Department of the Sofia Police Directorate, where only very successful candidates are usually appointed after a long and prominent career in the lower level police departments. He served at this position from 1981 to 1990. In this department he worked in the position of a police inspector, dealing with heavy crimes. He has been promoted many times in position and rank for the successful solution of a number of cases involving murder and vault breaking. He graduated with distinction his second university education in 1987 in the Law Department of the Saint Kliment Ohridski Sofia University. =Political career= Bogomil Bonev became a member of Bulgarian Communist Party in 1975 at the age of 18. In 1990 (at the time of political changes in Bulgaria) he was reappointed on his own request in the position of an investigator of heavy crimes. Bonev was appointed Director of the Sofia Police Directorate of the Ministry of Interior in 1991 and shortly after that he became Chief Secretary of the Ministry of Interior in the government of Philip Dimitrov. At this position he was the youngest general, promoted to this rank by President of Bulgaria Zhelyu Zhelev. After the end of the fall of Philip Dimitrov's government, Bogomil Bonev resigned from the position of Chief Secretary of the Ministry of Interior on his own request. He started his legal practice and worked as a counselor of the parliamentary group of the Union of the Democratic Forces on national security issues. In January 1997 he became Secretary on National Security Issues to the newly elect President Petar Stoyanov. Minister of Interior In February 1997 Bogomil Bonev was appointed Minister of Interior in the temporary government with Stefan Sofiyanski as Prime Minister. After a very successful fight against organized crime Bogomil Bonev was appointed in the same position in the cabinet of Ivan Kostov, which was the second government of the democratic forces in R. Bulgaria. Thanks to Bogomil Bonev all the 56 criteria of the \\"Budapest process\\" were then met and this made it possible for Bulgaria to be taken out of the negative Schengen visa list in accordance with the unanimous decision of the Ministers of Interior of the member states of the European Community. Bonev introduced then the first national DNA laboratory in Central and Eastern Europe and AFP‚Äìan automated dactiloscopic system.Interview with Ivan Ivanov: DNA analysis are intentionally hindered , legalworld.bg He summoned a committee of experts from the FBI in the USA for their implementation. In his capacity of Minister of Interior, Bonev created the organization for and started the implementation of the new ID documents, which are even now assessed as the ones with the best defense in Europe. The most up-to-date information in the world on the defense of ID documents was used for their manufacture. In the meantime a competition was held, which was won by HP and Cappelen‚ÄìAustria for the sum of 80 million leva. Yet, the Bulgarian state did not pay any money for this thanks to the terms of the competition. This is one of the rare cases in Europe when such a competition is held without arising any doubts of corruption. In the end of 1999, after the European Committee adopted the resolution for the removal of the visa regime for Bulgaria, Ivan Kostov, Prime Minister at that time, decided to get rid of the Minister of Interior Bogomil Bonev because the latter had a considerably higher rating in society than the Prime Minister himself and his government. The intrigues, created by Atanas Atanasov, Director of the former State Security agency at that time, contributed to this. Atanas Atanasov is at present a key member of Ivan Kostov's new party. At the time when Ivan Kostov was Prime Minister, Atanasov wrote a report, which officially claimed to be directed against corruption within Ivan Kostov's government but was in fact concealing it.

Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades. As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Due to its temperate climate and proximity to the Pacific Ocean, areas west of the Cascade Crest very rarely experience temperatures below or above . During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger.

Raised for service during World War I, the battalion served in the trenches on the Western Front in France and Belgium from mid-1916 until the end of hostilities in November 1918. Following this, it was disbanded in May 1919. Later, in 1921, the battalion was re-raised as a part-time unit of the Citizens Force, based in New South Wales. The battalion remained on the order of battle until 1942, when it was merged with the 1st Battalion as part of a force reduction that was undertaken at that time in response to an over mobilisation of the Australian military in the early part of World War II. In 1948, the battalion was re-raised again and remained on the order of battle until 1960 when it was absorbed into the Royal New South Wales Regiment. History =World War I= The 45th Battalion was originally raised on 2 March 1916 as part of the expansion of the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) in Egypt, which was undertaken following the completion of the Gallipoli campaign. As part of this process, new battalions were formed from experienced cadre personnel that were drawn from the veteran battalions of the 1st Division and the New Zealand and Australian Division, along with freshly trained recruits that were transferred from Australia.Grey 2008, p. 99. Due to its association with the 13th Battalion, which provided the majority of the 45th's experienced personnel, the 45th Battalion consisted primarily of volunteers from New South Wales. Under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Sydney Herring, who had formerly commanded the 13th Battalion, the 45th Battalion was assigned to the 12th Brigade, 4th Division. After completing training in Egypt, the battalion was transferred to the Western Front in mid-1916. During the following two and a half years, the battalion fought in a number of major battles in France and Belgium. Members of the 45th Battalion in action at the Battle of the Hindenburg Line, during September 1918. (The man kneeling on the far left is believed to be Private Edward Lynch) Its first major battle came at Pozi√®res in August, where it undertook a defensive role, holding ground that had been captured by the Australian 2nd Division earlier in the fighting. Later, after spending a period behind the lines near Ypres in Belgium, during the Battle of Bullecourt the battalion was held back in reserve and did not take part in the fighting. In mid-1917, it suffered heavy casualties during the Battles of Messines and Passchendaele. In March 1918, during the German Spring Offensive, the battalion repelled repeated attacks that were concentrated upon breaking through the Allied line at Dernancourt. Later, when the Allies launched their own offensive, the Hundred Days Offensive, the 45th Battalion was heavily involved in the fighting that began on 8 August 1918, during which time it was credited with capturing a large number of German soldiers, as well as a number of artillery pieces and machine-guns. Its last major action was the Battle of the Hindenburg Line, on 18 September, when it seized outposts of the Hindenburg Line, around Le Verguier. Following this, the units of the Australian Corps were withdrawn from the line for reorganisation.Grey 2008, p. 108. Consequently, they did not take part in any further fighting before the armistice came into effect on 11 November 1918. Following the end of hostilities, the demobilisation process began and the battalion's numbers fell as men were repatriated to Australia. Finally, on 2 May 1919, the battalion was disbanded. During the course of the war the battalion lost 688 men killed and 1,707 wounded. Members of the battalion received the following decorations: four Distinguished Service Orders with one Bar, one Officer of the Order of the British Empire, 28 Military Crosses with one Bar, 14 Distinguished Conduct Medals, 140 Military Medals with seven Bars, six Meritorious Service Medals, 37 Mentions in Despatches and five foreign awards. The 45th Battalion's contribution to Australia's effort during the war was recognised by the awarding of 16 battle honours. In 2006, a critically acclaimed memoir by Edward Lynch (1898‚Äì1980), concerning his experiences as a private in 14 Platoon, D Company, 45th Battalion was published for the first time, under the title Somme Mud. =Inter-war years and World War II= In 1921, the decision was made to perpetuate the units of the AIF by reorganising the units of the Citizens Force so that they adopted the numerical designations of their related AIF units as well as their battle honours, traditions and unit colour patches.Grey 2008, p. 125. As a result of this decision, the 45th Battalion was re-raised in New South Wales. Headquartered at Arncliffe, the battalion was assigned to the 9th Brigade, 2nd Division.Palazzo 2001, p. 102. Upon formation, the newly raised battalion drew personnel from the 2nd and 5th Battalions of the 45th Infantry Regiment.Festberg 1972, p. 103. Territorial designations were adopted in 1927 and the 45th Battalion assumed the title of the \\"St George Regiment\\"; its motto - Quo Fata Vocant - was also approved at this time. Initially, the Citizens Force was maintained through the compulsory training scheme, but after 1922 the battalion's authorised establishment was reduced in response to large-scale budget cuts that occurred following the Washington Naval Treaty. In 1930, following the election of Scullin Labor government, the compulsory training scheme was suspended. The Citizens Force was renamed the \\"Militia\\" at this time and became a volunteer-only force.Palazzo 2001, p. 110. This had the effect of reducing the manpower available and many units were amalgamated or disbanded at this time as their numbers were reduced,Keogh 1965, p. 44. although the 45th Battalion avoided this fate. In 1934, the battalion was allied with The Welsh Regiment. After the outbreak of World War II in 1939, Militia units were expanded through the re-establishment of conscription and took part in home defence duties and training. In April 1941, the 45th Battalion was transferred to the 28th Brigade, 1st Division. In December 1941, following Japan's entry into the war, the Militia were called up for full-time duty and the units of the 1st Division were tasked with the defence of the Sydney area. In February 1942, the battalion was transferred again, this time to the 31st Brigade, 1st Division. By mid-1942, an over mobilisation of Australia's military forces had resulted in a manpower shortage in the Australian economy. In order to rectify this situation, the Australian government decided to amalgamate and disband a number of units from the Militia in order to free up their personnel and return them to the civilian workforce.Grey 2008, p. 184. As a result, in September 1942, the 45th Battalion merged with the 1st Battalion to form the 1st/45th Battalion. In 1944, that battalion was also dissolved, having not deployed overseas. =Post war= In 1948, Australia's part-time military force was re-raised under the guise of the Citizens Military Force (CMF). This force was formed on a reduced establishment of just two divisions.Grey 2008, p. 200. The 45th Battalion was re-raised on 1 April 1948 under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Paul Cullen. Once again it was assigned to the 2nd Division,Palazzo 2001, p. 209. but was attached at brigade level to the 14th Brigade. During this time it also took on the role of a machine-gun battalion.Kuring 2004, p. 227 and 297. Due to its links with Sydney, the newly raised 45th Battalion was closely associated with the disbanded 2/1st Battalion, a Second Australian Imperial Force unit, from where a large majority of the 45th Battalion's officers were drawn following the war.Grey 2001, p. 172. The battalion's regimental march, Men of Harlech was authorised in 1953. Initially the post-war CMF was maintained on a voluntary basis, however, in 1951 the compulsory training scheme was reintroduced.Grey 2008, p. 205. The scheme was suspended in 1959,Grey 2008, p. 207. however, and this led to a significant decrease in the strength of many units. The following year, the Australian Army adopted the Pentropic divisional structure and a large-scale reorganisation of the CMF structure followed. As a result, a number of infantry battalions amalgamated or disbanded altogether as the regionally based single battalion regiments were replaced by six new multi-battalion State-based regiments.Grey 2008, p. 228. As part of this change, the 45th Battalion was subsumed into the Royal New South Wales Regiment, providing the 3rd Battalion's 'A' and Support Companies.Palazzo 2001, p. 259.Kuring 2004, p. 299. The battalion's colours were laid up at St Paul's Church at Kogarah. The battalion's battle honours are perpetuated by the 4th/3rd Battalion, Royal New South Wales Regiment.

Up to now the theory has mainly been specified with regard to the European Union (EU), but could be made much more general. Hence state cartel theory should consider all international governmental organizations (IGOs) as cartels made up by states.  Terminology  The term cartel in state cartel theory means ‚Äì in very short words ‚Äì an alliance of rivals. It is used in a neutral, strictly analytical way, not as a degradation. The terminology has been predominantly adopted from the old historical cartel theory of pre-World War II Europe. But additionally these terms have been checked and sometimes adjusted in their meanings to be able to incorporate political and governmental functions as cartel functions of the combined states.  Methodical base and scientific background  State cartel theory is a hybrid design made up of two or more theories, assembled in an adequate way. The method of theory creation consists of three steps: # The starting material of a state cartel theory is the intellectual corpus of a broad existing theory of international relations. For instance the following theories might be adaptable: the realism, the neofunctionalist Europe-science, or even a Marxist imperialism theory. Their statements on the relationships between the industrialized nation states are called into question as these are thought to be ideologically biased and therefore these are marked up for revision and change. # The losses and vacancies are now to be refilled by another theory, the classical cartel theory of economic enterprises. This theory, made up mainly in Germany, was authoritative in Europe till the end of World War II and was pushed aside globally by the American anti-trust policy up to the 1960s. The classical cartel theory comprised an elaborate organizational theory of the cartel institution. Its knowledge of the relationships among the cartelized enterprises and between them and the common cartel institutions are now to be applied. Hence, the classical economic cartel theory serves as a tool kit for repairing the ideological deformations and corruptions of the existing theories of IR. # In a third step the transfer results were rechecked in the light of available facts of international relations and they were stated more precisely and with greater differentiation. In the final outcome a theory gets built, which ‚Äì like the cartel theory of economic enterprises ‚Äì based on the utilitarian image of man. Thus, state cartel theory is strictly determined by socio-economic factors. Since this approach prevents ideological influences it is not ‚Äì neither evidently nor in a hidden or subtle manner ‚Äì connected with the interests of any existing great power. The philosophical precondition of the specified knowledge transfer from cartel theory is the ‚Äì one century old ‚Äì insight, that there are striking analogies between combinations of states and combinations of economic enterprises (i.e. the cartels formerly legal and of a great number in Europe).Rudolf Hilferding, Das Finanzkapital, Frankfurt 1973 [Wien 1910], Vol. II, p. 279 These analogies are both institutionally and functionally adept.  History of the state cartel conception  The conception of international relations as potential cartel phenomena has a long tradition: * John Atkinson Hobson, a left-liberal British economist, suggested between 1902 and 1938, imperial antagonisms could be pacified in a system of 'inter-imperialism', if the great powers would \\"learn the art of combination\\" ('combination' or 'combine' were at those times used to designate cartels).John A. Hobson: Imperialism, London 1902, 311 * Karl Kautsky, the leading theoretician of social democracy before World War I, hoped since 1912, the great powers ‚Äì beginning with the British Empire and the Deutsche Reich ‚Äì would unite into a 'state cartel' giving them organization and reconciliation within an ultra-imperialism ‚Äì an idea, that was an illusion at that time.Holm A. Leonhardt, Zur Geschichte der Ultraimperialismus-Theorie 1902‚Äì1930. Die Ideengeschichte einer fr√ºhen Theorie der politischen Globalisierung [On the History of Ultra-Imperialism Theory 1902‚Äì1930], Institute of History, Hildesheim Universit√§t (Germany) * Early Commentators of the European unification described the organizational system of the Schuman Plan in 1950 as 'cartel-like'; the Corriere della Sera, a respected Italian newspaper, understood the aim of the proposal as to build a cartello anticartello, i.e., a states‚Äô cartel to eliminate the private cartels in the coal and steel sectors.Corriere della Sera, May 11th 1950, European Navigator The cartel concept for closer forms of inter-state cooperation was counteracted by just a range of actors: by Leninism, American anti-trust policy and European federalists (e.g., Jean Monnet). This conception was first blamed, then ignored, and by the 1960s increasingly forgotten.  Central conclusions and basic instruments  The breakthrough phase: The historical origin of a wider political cartelization is identified in the crisis of the capitalist system after World War II. The breakdown of the anarchic ‚Äì or imperialistic ‚Äì world system in 1945 marks the beginning of the comprehensive inter-state cartelization of the western world. The extreme material, political and human losses and sacrifices led the nations ‚Äì or more precisely: their ruling classes ‚Äì to the conclusion that war and protectionism should not be used any more as weapons against each other to assure the survival of the free western world. This culminated in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade coming into force rather than in service of mankind on 1 January 1948. The cartel relationship: The analysis of relations among the combined states is a basic instrument of state cartel theory. The aim is to identify the extent of their cooperation, of common interests on the one hand, and the amount of their competition, the dimension of divergence of their interests on the other hand. This is carried out essentially contrary to existing statements of the conventional theories of IR, e.g. the argument of interstate 'friendship' ‚Äì which is the idealist or functionalist position ‚Äì or a human drive for power ‚Äì which is the realist position. This way, the basic relationship between the cooperation seeking capitalist states can be recognized as a quite rational, but also difficult friendship-rivalry, a relationship of cooperation and antagonism. The Franco-German friendship can be seen as a paradigm for this and many examples of its ambivalence have been quoted. Hegemony analysis: The supremacy of the greater states ‚Äì like that of the bigger enterprises ‚Äì leads to overproportional assertiveness and thus to privileges for these actors obtained by persuasion or by force. On the other hand, integration brings about dependencies binding all participants. So there is a structure of symmetric and asymmetric connections, which can be found both inside and outside of the respective state cartels. The analysis of these complex forms of international relations is in the focus of state cartel theory and can lead to a global analysis of state cartels and state cartel effects. A not considered aspect is the \\"disrupter\\", often manifesting itself in opposition to real or perceived grievance brought to bear, at little relative cost, to its effect such as the attacks on the World Trade Center where two aircraft as weapons brought to sharp focus world attention the power of a new terror.  Institutions and theory of ideology  The organizational structure: In enterprise cartels the members' assembly was always the historically first and main institution of the combination. All further institutions had serving functions (secretary, bodies for market regulation, arbitration board) and were the result of the will and the needs of the members. This structure can be found alike in the combinations of states: the council of ministers or delegates is the members' assembly of the participating states (e.g. the Council of the European Union), it has a secretariat, there are operative commissions (e.g. the European Commission), and there can be an arbitration board/court (e.g. the European Court). Additional institutions could be developed ‚Äì in enterprise as in state cartels ‚Äì according to needs. On the democratic character of the European Union: The European Parliament is ‚Äì according to state cartel theory ‚Äì a less important, not really indispensable multifunctional communitarian institution of EU: The most obvious function is the orchestration of a European democracy; at this, the democratic pretensions of parties and citizens of the member states are to be served symbolically ‚Äì meaning: they often get sent to nowhere. Another function is the provision and application of more EU-expertise by the representatives of the single member states, being an additional channel to import national interests into the communitarian system. Finally, the European Parliament is able to influence the EU legislation slightly by its rights of participation: it can actually bias and improve decisions, which otherwise would be made exclusively by the mighty council, and this would often happen according to the notorious principle of the least common denominator. A significant increase in the rights of the parliament would challenge the system and pose the question: cartel or federal state. A process like this, which could really override the cartel-logic, could only develop with the support or at the instigation of a strong dominant group of member states. Theory of ideology: While national- imperialist ideologies of the pre-1945 era being abolished, international institutions (state cartels) today spread an ideology of interstate cooperation: \\"Since war and protectionism should fall away as means of policy, a different stile of contact becomes necessary between the partner states. [‚Ä¶] The nationalism of former days is repressed by an ideology of international understanding and friendship. The European Spirit gets evoked particularly in context of the European Union. The commandments of international understanding and European Communitarianship are the lubricant in the mechanics of the bargaining process in the state cartel. As ideologies they often make the relations look much better than they really are, but as appeals or instructions they could be eminently valuable. [‚Ä¶] The Origin of the communitarian ideology in its pure occurrence are the central institutions of the EU, its commission and its parliament.\\"  Functions and results of integration  The functional typology: The enterprise cartels of former times framed markets according to their interests, state cartels frame policies. While the aims of the standardization activities can be different, the methods and instruments of private and state cartels are often similar and always analogically comparable. Thereby the functional typology of the classical enterprise cartels is applicable also for interstate regulative communities. This typification by the purpose of the cartel can be demonstrated by means of the example of the European Union: * the European common agricultural market has instruments similar to a ‚Äì normally forbidden ‚Äì production cartel typically controlling prices and outputs. * the miscellaneous market regulations of EU, but also its health care and environmental standards, can be seen to correspond to standardization cartels, partially also to conditions cartels. * the settlements on maximum prices for cell phone calls within Europe constitute a supranationally decreed calculations cartel. The cartel gain: Cooperating within international institutions normally provides the participating states with substantial benefits. \\"The cartel gain of the EU consists of the various gains in prosperity, which result from economic integration and now make the member states adhere like being glued together. Any far-reaching disintegration, trying to go back to national autarchy, would invariably lead to an economic crisis, for which the Great Depression [in Europe] of 1929/33 should have been just a slight forerunner.\\" Transnational corporations and export-oriented national enterprises plus their employees and suppliers constitute a social power, which would hinder a breaking apart of the community. On the other hand, the cooperation in the state cartel is complicated because of distributional conflicts. Tendencies for crises: According to state cartel theory inter-state organizations typically develop severe problems and crises. The European Union is seen to be in a permanent crisis. The causes for this are thought to lie in the clashes of increasingly unbridgeable interests between the participating nations or just plain cupidity. The EU ‚Äì as a particularly advanced cartel combine ‚Äì would strike more and more against a systemic barrier of development, i.e. could only be upgraded effectively by a change-over of power, by a federal revolution, in which the cartel form will be conquered and a federal state ‚Äì with its considerable potentials for rationalization ‚Äì will be erected.  Compatibility with other theories of international relations  State cartel theory suggests: * an intense rivalry among the developed industrialized states for socio-economic reasons, * a partial (not complete) resolvability of these contradictions within the framework of international institutions or ‚Äì in other words ‚Äì by the cartel method, * the power of the nation states as the crucial force within international political relations. Thereby state cartel theory is partially in accordance or in opposition: * to the neofunctionalist Europe-science and the communitarian method of Jean Monnet: The belief in the resolvability of the inner-European divergences of interests, in the feasibility of an efficient and conciliable Europe, is criticized by state cartel theory as na√≠ve-idealistic. On the other hand, both integration theories agree with regard to the importance they attach to institution- building in state communities. * to Leninist imperialism theory: The allegation of antagonistic rivalry between the developed capitalist states should be wrong, certainly since World War II. These states could definitely cooperate enduringly and abstain from open violence in their relationships. But state cartel theory and imperialism theory accord in the belief that societal interests are caused by socio-economic factors, thus eventually depending on the economy. * to theories of International Relations with a pro- American bias: In the hegemony analysis of a state cartel theory it is always the look at the most powerful nations (i.e. globally the USA) which is most important. ‚Äì Whitewashing of America as 'good strong power' as done in realism (by Morgenthau: the USA were not in a consistent pursuit of hegemonyHans J. Morgenthau, Politics among nations : the struggle for power and peace, Boston 2006 (7. Ed.), p. 67‚Äì68) or the methodical deferment of the power aspect as in the mainstream of both regime theory and global governance approach would be contrary to a state cartel theory.

The people feast and afterwards divide into two teams to contest a stone throwing competition.

The Newars make a straw figure which they beat and drag around the streets.

Sonam Losar is celebrated by the Tamangs, Gyalpo Losar by the Sherpas and Tamu Losar is celebrated by the Gurungs. =Gai Jatra/Saa: Paru= This entirely Newar festival is held Bhadra. Newars who have lost loved ones during the year traditionally disguised themselves as cows and danced around the palace of the king. However, in modern times, the ceremony is performed only as a masked dance with the singing of songs. Gaijatra, the festival of cows, (gai means cow and jatra means festival in Nepali: ‡§ó‡§æ‡§à‡§ú‡§æ‡§§‡•ç‡§∞‡§æ, and Nepal Bhasa: ‡§∏‡§æ‡§™‡§æ‡§∞‡•Å) is celebrated in Nepal, mainly in Kathmandu valley by the Newars. It is also a grand festival in Jumla, celebrated by people of all caste . The festival commemorates the death of people during the year. During the festival, cows are marched in the streets and generally celebrated in the Nepalese month of Bhadra (August‚ÄìSeptember). It falls on the 1st day of the dark fortnight of Gunla according to the lunar Nepal Era calendar. Peoples also distributes food to others. The festival of cows is one of the most popular festivals of Nepal. The whole complex of Gaijatra festival has its roots in the ancient ages when people feared and worshiped Yamaraj, the god of death. However, the ironic sessions synonymous with the Gaijatra festival entered the tradition in the medieval period of Nepal during the reign of the Malla Kings. Hence, the present form of Gaijatra is a happy blending of antiquity and the medieval era. According to the traditions since time immemorial, every family who has lost one relative during the past year must participate in a procession through the streets of Kathmandu leading a cow. If a cow is unavailable then a young boy dressed as a cow is considered a fair substitute. In Hinduism, a cow is regarded as the most venerated among all the domestic animals. It is believed that the cow, revered as a holy animal by Hindus, will help the deceased relative's journey to heaven. According to the historical evidence, when King Pratap Malla lost his son, his wife, the queen, remained grief- stricken. The king was very sad to see the condition of his beloved queen. The king, in spite of several efforts, could not lessen the grief of his wife. He desperately wanted to see a little smile on the lips of his sweetheart, and so he announced that anyone who made the queen laugh would be rewarded adequately. During the festival of Gaijatra, the cow procession was brought before the grief-stricken queen. Then the participants began ridiculing and be-fooling the important people of the society. Finally, when the social injustices and other evils were highlighted and attacked mercilessly, the queen could not help but smile. The queen laughed and the king instituted a tradition of including jokes, satire, mockery and lampoon into the Gaijatra celebration. After the procession is over, in the afternoon, nearly everyone takes part in another age-old tradition in which the participants dress up and wear masks. The occasion is filled with songs and jokes. Mockery and humor of every kind become the order of the day until late evening. Hence, Gaijatra is a healthy festival which enables the people to accept the reality of death and to prepare themselves for life after death. According to Hinduism, \\"whatever a man does in his life is a preparation leading to a good life after death\\". Bagh Jatra This festival takes place on the 2nd of Bhadon. Dancers once dressed up in tiger costumes but today it is merely a repetition of the Gai Jatra festival. =Indra Jatra= Dancers The Indra Jatra festival begins on the 26th of Bhadon and lasts for eight days. This festival is held in early to mid September and marks the end of the rainy season. On the first day a lofty wooden post is erected before the king's palace or at other Darbur sites and dancers from all across Nepal perform with masks. If an earthquake ever occurred on the opening day of the festival this was considered a bad omen and the festival would have to be restarted. On the third day, young virgins are brought before the king and worshiped and then carried through Kathmandu, mounted on oars. The highlight is parading the Kumar Devi (living god) through Kathmandu on a special chariot built just this purpose. The chariots are parked outside the Kumar Devi's house at the Kathmandu Durbar Square. =Mohani= Mohani corresponds to Dasain and is one of the year's grandest celebrations for the Newars. The event involves family gatherings and outdoor functions, and lasts 10 days. =Bala Chaturdasi or Satbyu= Pashupati. This festival takes places on the 14th of Aghan, when people gather in the forest of Mrigasthali, near the temple of Pashupati to scatter an offering of rice, vegetables and sweetmeats. =Kartik Purnima= On the first day of the month of Kartik, many women go to the temple of Pashupati. There they remain for an entire month, fasting and drinking only water. Some women have died during the fasting but the majority generally survive and on the last day of the month, known as the purnima, the night is spent rejoicing the success of the fasting by singing and dancing into the night. =Ganesh Chauthi= The Ganesh Chauthi festival is held on the 4th of Magh, in honor of Lord Ganesh, the god of wisdom. The day is spent fasting and worshipping and in ended by feasting into the night. =Maghe Sankranti= Maghe sankranti is observed in the month of January on the first day of the month of Magh, bringing an end to the ill-omened month of Poush when all religious ceremonies are forbidden. On this day, the sun leaves its southernmost position and takes off for its northward journey, so Maghe Sankranti is similar to solstice festivals in many other traditions. People participate in holy bathing in this festival and auspicious foods like laddoo, ghee, sweet potatoes etc. are distributed. The mother of the house wishes good health to all family members. According to Mahabharata, king Bhishma, who had the power to control his own death, happened to choose to die on the day of Maghe Sakranti. Therefore, it is believed that to die on this day might achieve Moksha, a release from the rebirth cycle. =Basant or Sripanchami= Goddess Saraswati This festival takes place in the month of Magh or Fhagun in the honor of Goddess Saraswati, the goddess of learning. =Holi= The festival takes place on the last day of Fhalguna. In Nepal, a wooden post, known as a chir is adorned with flags and erected in front of the palace. It is burned at night, representing the burning of the body of the old year. =Maghe Purnima= The bathing festival where Newars bathe in the Bagmati River. during Magh. On the last day of the month, bathers are carried in a procession in ornamented dolis, lying on their backs with lighted lamps (known as chirags) on their chests, arms and legs. Other bathers bear earthen water pots on their heads, perforated with straws, through which water seeps down to sprinkle passers by. Traditionally the bathers wear green spectacles to protect their eyes from the sparks of the lamps they are in contact with. =PƒÅhƒÅn Charhe= During Pahan Charhe which is one of the festivals in Kathmandu, Luku MƒÅhƒÅdev (meaning Mahadev enshrined in the ground) is worshipped and portable shrines containing images of mother goddesses are paraded through the streets. =Ghode Jatra= Statue of Jang Bahadur in Kathmandu Traditionally on the 15th of Chait, all horses and ponies belonging to government servants were assembled at the grand parade ground and entered into a race in front of the king and top officials who are stationed around a central monument. The monument bore Sir Jung Bahadur's statue. After the event, gambling is allowed for two days and nights and the festival ends with an illumination of the monument. In 1875, Bahadur's statue and four dragon monuments were moved into a newly built temple in his honor, hence the location of the festival moved. =Jana BƒÅhƒÅ Dyah JƒÅtrƒÅ= Jana BƒÅhƒÅ Dyah JƒÅtrƒÅ is the chariot procession of Jana Baha Dyah, the Bodhisattva of compassion, which is held annually in Kathmandu. During the festival, the image of Jana BƒÅhƒÅ Dyah is removed from his temple at Jana Baha and installed in a car built in the shape of a tower on wheels. The chariot is drawn through the center of Kathmandu for three days. =Bunga Dyah JƒÅtrƒÅ= An image of Bunga Dyah (Rato Machhendranath) is placed on a tall chariot which is pulled in stages through the streets of Patan for a month in the longest chariot procession held in the country. =Kirat Festival= Limbu festivals Some festivals may be practiced within ethnic groups in Nepal.

It is a fictional fable about an extraordinary experience of a man called Charlie St. Cloud who is resuscitated following a car accident that kills his brother. Plot Charlie St. Cloud (age 15) and Sam (12) are two brothers with a love so strong, no force can separate them. When their mom leaves Charlie to babysit Sam, they decide to go to watch a 1991 Red Sox baseball game in Boston against the New York Yankees with their pet beagle, Oscar. They \\"borrow\\" their neighbor Mrs. Pung's Ford Country Squire. On the way there they cannot decide which CD to listen to. As they cross the General Edwards Bridge on the Saugus River, on the way home, Charlie decides to take a look at the moon to see if Sam was right about the moon being larger that night. Charlie does not see an 18-wheeler truck come and they end up tumbling twice crushing Oscar along the way. When they are dead, they find themselves close to the cemetery in Marblehead, the town where they live. Sam is scared and Charlie makes a promise that they will never abandon each other. However, Charlie gets resuscitated in an ambulance by a religious paramedic, Florio Ferrente and carries on living. Thirteen years later, Charlie, now 28, has grown up and is working at the Waterside cemetery. Every evening at dusk he goes to a nearby forest where he plays with Sam. Charlie has the gift of seeing ghosts. This serves him well as an undertaker, as he can talk with ghosts. In the town lives Tess Carroll, a yachtswoman who wants to make a round the world trip. A week prior to her departure, she directs her yacht into a storm to test it, not listening to her shipsman Tink Weatherbee, who told her not to go into the storm. The storm sucks Tess into its grasp and the ship flips, leaving Tess hanging on upside down. Tess appears at the cemetery where her dad is buried. While regarding her father's memorial, she hears a loud clanging noise, which is Charlie scaring away the geese by banging trash can covers together. She remembers Charlie from high school and wonders if he remembers her. They both talk and Charlie ends up asking Tess to come over for dinner that night. Both are not entirely sure of this arrangement for different reasons. Tess is concerned with the fact that she never really was a true believer in love, and Charlie is worried that this could come in between his promise to him and Sam. The next day while taking a walk with her dog, Bobo, Tess realizes that people ignore her when Bobo comes off his leash and nobody hears her saying to stop him. While at lunch together, three days later, an officer comes in to the coffee shop and states that Tess's boat, the Querencia, has gone missing and was never found. Charlie is shocked at the thought that Tess could be dead. He had heard of \\"middle ground\\" where spirits would stay until they were ready to pass over to the next level. He had seen many come and go quickly and others who liked to stay like his brother. In the meantime everyone in the town in possession of a boat, including Charlie, explores the harbor in order to look for Tess's body. Charlie questions his sanity because the night they shared together was so real and Tess was full of life. There was no way she could possibly be gone. Everyone gives up the search, but then Charlie feels that there is one place he has to go. With Sam's help, he finds Tess's body. Tess is transported to a hospital where the doctors stabilize her in a deep coma. A few months later, Charlie decides to quit his job and move on, bidding a final farewell to Sam, now 25 years old from crossing over. Charlie is now a paramedic at Engine 2 on Franklin Street.

He reveals that Tess and Charlie fall in love again and eventually marry and have two sons. It is also said that Charlie and his family will get a new beagle.

It was originally conceived to be similar in style and functions to KDE's Amarok 1.4, but uses the GTK+ widget toolkit rather than Qt. It is written in Python and utilizes the GStreamer media framework. Exaile incorporates many features from Amarok (and other media players) like automatic fetching of album art, handling of large libraries, lyrics fetching, Last.fm support, advanced tag editing, and optional iPod and MSC device support via plugins. Compared to typical music players, Exaile is able to handle large music libraries without requiring a massive importing of all music files into its own organizational structure. To facilitate this, Exaile allows users to organize their music library in a wide variety of ways. Such as by tags, group tags, smart playlists, genre, storage location, and more. In addition, Exaile supports plugins that provide features such as ReplayGain support, an equalizer with presets, previewing tracks via a secondary soundcard, and Moodbar integration.

Founded in the early 9th century, it survived until the late 11th century. History The exact date of the unit's establishment is uncertain: the Vita Ignatii, a hagiographic account of the life of Patriarch Ignatius of Constantinople, records that the unit was said to have been established by Emperor Nikephoros I (). A brief notice in the Chronicle of 811 fragment also records that in his ninth regnal year (which began on 1 November 810) Nikephoros I, in preparation for a campaign against the Bulgars, created a bodyguard for his son and heir Staurakios, recruiting into it the sons of the aristocracy. This date is generally accepted, although sigillographic evidence as to its establishment is vague, and could support a late 8th- century establishment. According to the Vita, Niketas, the grandson of Nikephoros and future patriarch Ignatius, was appointed as the regiment's first commander. The name of the unit derives from the Greek word , \\"able\\", and the Latin ending -atus. The unit is well attested in the 9th through 10th centuries. The first battle the unit participated in was the disastrous Battle of Pliska on 26 July 811 against the Bulgars, where Emperor Nikephoros I was killed. The unit is often recorded under Basil I the Macedonian (), and participated in another defeat against the Bulgars, at the Battle of Acheloos in 917. In the Cretan expedition of 949, 456 soldiers of the unit from Bithynia, as well as an unspecified number of members garrisoned in the European themes of Thrace and Macedonia took part. The unit's continued existence in the 11th century can not be safely attested, as the few occurrences are either modern emendations or may refer to a family name \\"Hikanatos\\". Like most of the tagmata, it probably ceased to exist sometime in the latter half of the 11th century. Structure According to John Haldon, the Hikanatoi were apparently modelled on the tagma of the Vigla. The regiment was headed by a domestikos (, domestikos t≈çn Hikanat≈çn), usually with the court rank of pr≈çtospatharios, although they could theoretically advance to the ranks of patrikios and anthypatos patrikios. His chief subordinate was the topotƒìrƒìtƒìs (\\"lieutenant\\"), of spatharokandidatos or spatharios rank, while the rest of the unit's officials were below the rank of spatharios. Following the pattern of the Vigla, there were a chartoularios (financial official), a number of komƒìtes (\\"counts\\") and their subordinate kentarchoi commanding the banda into which the unit was divided, a pr≈çtomandat≈çr (head messenger), and three classes of standard-bearers: the bandophoroi, sƒìmeiophoroi and doukiniatores. As with the other tagmata, the exact size of the unit and its subdivisions is a matter of debate, since it is chiefly based on Arab accounts, whose accuracy and veracity is open to question. Warren Treadgold, who accepts the Arab figures as accurate, considers the tagmata to have had a standard size of 4,000 men each, while Haldon, who considers their numbers inflated, considers a total of 4,000 for all tagmata more plausible. The lists of the Cretan expedition of 949, included in the De Ceremoniis of Emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogennetos (), include mention of 456 Hikanatoi, but it is unclear what part of the unit's strength they represent.

The Act used a mixture of governmental regulation and self-regulation, and created a Securities and Investments Board (SIB) presiding over various new self-regulating organisations (SROs). It was superseded by the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. Context The Act may be thought of as an ‚Äúemasculated Gower‚Äù. Professor Laurence Gower had been asked to produce a report on financial regulation, followed by a draft bill. He tended towards a tighter and more top-heavy regime. The Thatcher government became impatient with this process and pushed a second bill through in place of Gower with more emphasis on self- regulation but containing most of the regulatory content of the Gower bill.Rider et al, pp. 13-18. This relatively light approach to regulation followed a trend taking place in America under the Reagan administration.For background see: Paul Krugman, 'Reagan Did It' (31 May 2009) The New York Times Derivative products Section 63 of the Act abolished any oversight of the courts on derivative contracts, which might otherwise have been considered speculative and thus contrary to the Gaming Act 1845. This exemption was not changed in the new Financial Services and Markets Act 2000.Section 412 of the 2000 Act. Repeal The Act was repealed on 1 December 2001 by The Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Consequential Amendments and Repeals) Order 2001 and was superseded by the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. Under this, the SIB and SROs were merged to form the Financial Services Authority (FSA), and self-regulation took a back seat.

Family  Friedrich was the third son of Field Marshal Archduke Charles of Austria (1771‚Äì1847) and Princess Henrietta of Nassau-Weilburg (1797‚Äì1829). He never married and did not leave issue.  Military career in the Navy  Born in Vienna, Friedrich joined the Imperial Austrian Navy in 1837 at the age of sixteen. He threw himself into this career with much zeal and quickly rose to command a ship, sailing to the orient for the first time in 1839. = Oriental Crisis of 1840 = During the Oriental Crisis of 1840 between Egypt and the Ottoman Empire, Friedrich fought in the campaign against Muhammad Ali after the Convention of London. He served with the Austrian fleet off the Levantine coast as commander of the ship Guerriera. In that convention, the United Kingdom, Austria, Prussia, and Russia had offered Muhammad Ali hereditary rule of Egypt as part of the Ottoman Empire if he withdrew from the Syrian hinterland and the coast of Mount Lebanon. Muhammad Ali hesitated until British naval forces moved against Syria and Alexandria. After the British and Austrian navies blockaded the Nile delta coastline, shelled Beirut (on September 11, 1840), and after Acre had surrendered (on November 3, 1840), Muhammad Ali agreed to the terms of the Convention on November 27, 1840. From his ship Friedrich directed the assault on the citadels of Sidon and Beirut which soon fell. Following the bombardment of Acre on 3 November 1840, he personally led a small landing party of Austrian, British and Ottoman Turkish troops and took the citadel of Acre after the Egyptian garrison had fled. They hoisted the Turkish, British and Austrian flags over the citadel. For his exceptional leadership during the campaign he was appointed Knight of the Military Order of Maria Theresa. = Commander-in-Chief = In 1842 Friedrich sailed to Algeria and England. In 1844 he was promoted to the rank of vice admiral and took office as Commander-in-Chief of the Imperial Austrian Navy at the age of twenty-three. His appointment came after a mutiny by Venetian junior officers led by the sons of admiral Baron Francesco Bandiera. As Commander-in-Chief, Friedrich introduced many modernising reforms, aiming to make his country's naval force less \\"Venetian\\" but more \\"Austrian\\". In Austria there had until the end of the eighteenth century only been limited attempts at establishing a navy of its own. When the Habsburgs received the city of Venice along with Istria and Dalmatia following the Treaty of Campo Formio in 1797, this situation was changed considerably. The Venetian naval forces and facilities were handed over to Austria and became the basis of the formation of the future Austrian Navy. Until Friedrich's term as Commander-in-Chief it was however often felt that the force officially styled the \\"Austrian Navy\\" was in practice little more than Venetian crews and ships sailing under the Austrian flag. Friedrich had a keen private interest in the fleet, and with him the Austrian naval force gained its first influential supporter from the ranks of the Imperial Family. This was crucial as sea power was never a priority of the Austrian foreign policy and the navy itself was relatively little known or supported by the public. It was only able to draw significant public attention and funds during the three short periods of its history when it was actively supported by an imperial prince. Following Friedrich's example, the archdukes Ferdinand Maximilian (1832‚Äì1867) and Franz Ferdinand (1863‚Äì1914) would later become active campaigners for naval matters. The Austrian Chancellor Prince Klemens von Metternich proposed that Friedrich be named Grand Master of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, but this was rejected by Pope Gregory XVI.H.J.A. Sire, The Knights of Malta (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1994), 251.  Death  SMS Erzherzog Friedrich (1868) Friedrich's term as Commander-in-Chief of the Imperial Austrian Navy was cut short. He died of jaundice in Venice at the age of twenty-six, only three years after taking office. Some boats have been named for him including a large sailboat SMS Erzherzog Friedrich and the battleship SMS Erzherzog Friedrich (1902).  Ancestry   Notes   Further reading  Dauber, Robert L.

The Ordish‚ÄìLefeuvre system differs from conventional suspension bridges in that, while as with a conventional suspension bridge a parabolic cable supports the centre of the bridge, inclined stays support the remainder of the bridge's load. Each stay consists of a flat wrought iron bar attached to the bridge deck, and a wire rope connects the wrought iron bar to one of four octagonal support columns. Only two major bridges were built using the Ordish‚ÄìLefeuvre principle. Ordish was commissioned to build Albert Bridge in Chelsea, London, using the design in 1864, but the start of work on the bridge was delayed due to negotiations regarding the proposed Chelsea Embankment at the northern end of the proposed bridge. While plans for the Chelsea Embankment were debated, Ordish built the Franz Joseph Bridge over the Vltava in Prague to the same design as that intended for Albert Bridge. In 1870 work finally began on Albert Bridge, with construction expected to take roughly a year. In the event, construction took over three years, and the bridge opened with no formal ceremony on 23 August 1873, almost ten years after it had been authorised. Albert Bridge was augmented with conventional suspension chains in 1887 and with central supports in 1972 Albert Bridge was inspected in 1884 by Sir Joseph Bazalgette, Chief Engineer of the Metropolitan Board of Works, who found that the steel rods were already showing serious signs of corrosion. Over the next three years the steel staying rods were augmented with steel chains, giving it an appearance more closely resembling a conventional suspension bridge, and a new timber deck was laid. Albert Bridge continued to suffer serious structural weakness and in 1972 the Greater London Council added two concrete piers in the middle of the river, supporting the central span and turning the central section of the bridge into a beam bridge. Damaged through overuse during the Second World War, the Franz Joseph Bridge was demolished in the 1950s and replaced with a conventional bridge, leaving Albert Bridge the only surviving example of a significant bridge built using the Ordish‚ÄìLefeuvre principle.

He was born on Smith Street on the Buffalo's East Side on August 14, 1874. At 19, he became a foreman at the Pullman Palace Car Company, then known as the Wagner Palace Car Company, and took a job as a traveling salesman for the company. He then became a brewery solicitor, eventually becoming the highest paid brewery solicitor in Buffalo. He married Theresa M. Lauser on September 24, 1901. He opened a wholesale and retail liquor store at Broadway and Jefferson Avenue in 1912. He became president and general manager of the Mohawk Products Company; the merged Buffalo Brewing Company and the Cooperative Brewing Company formed during Prohibition to make near-beer. Schwab's rise in the Buffalo brewing industry was short lived because of the enactment of prohibition in 1919. Even though Schwab transitioned into the production of near beer he would take the opportunity to speak out against the Volstead Act whenever possible. \\"By this time, Frank Schwab had developed a personal style that delighted his friends and infuriated his enemies\\".Lay, Shawn \\"Hooded Knights on the Niagara: The Ku Klux Klan in Buffalo, NY\\" The Buffalo Brewing company, Schwab's brewery, was raided by Federal agents who found illegal beer resulting in an indictment for Schwab. Schwab was an unlikely candidate for mayor. He had no political experience, he was Catholic, and under federal indictment for illegal possession of alcohol. But in 1921, as a joke the Knights of St. John circulated a petition on behalf of Schwab for his mayoral candidacy.Murphy, Dan \\"Nickel City Drafts: A Drinking History of Buffalo, NY\\" He was elected Mayor on November 8, 1921, as the Republican candidate. During his term, in the summer of 1922, the last and most bitter street railway strike occurred; Schwab declared a transportation emergency and authorized the running of buses. Finally, the International Railway Company went open shop and the union was broken. In 1923‚Äì1924, the city purchased land for an airfield and, on September 27, 1926, Mayor Schwab laid the cornerstone of the administration building for the Buffalo Airport. Schwab was easily re- elected to a second term on November 4, 1925. He lost his bid for re-election on November 5, 1929, with Charles Roesch elected mayor. Schwab returned to active management of Mohawk Products Company. He died on April 23, 1946, and was buried in Mt. Calvary Cemetery.

They are also known as the \\"Packhorse Bridges\\" or (erroneously) the \\"Roman Bridges\\", and are recorded in the National Heritage List for England as designated Grade II listed buildings. The bridges are situated where Platts Lane crosses the River Gowy. An area of west of the Gowy, including the westernmost bridge, forms Hockenhull Platts Nature Reserve, managed by the Cheshire Wildlife Trust. Etymology Although the bridges are in England, they are not far from the Welsh border and it is likely that their name is derived from a combination of English and Welsh roots. Platt is an Old English word for \\"bridge\\" and is associated with \\"plank\\". \\"Hock\\" may come from the Welsh hocan which means to peddle or to sell abroad. Hen is Welsh for \\"old\\" and heol means a paved way or road. It is therefore possible that Hockenhull Platts means \\"the bridges on the old peddlars' way\\".Bowerman, p.42. History Platts Lane originally formed part of the medieval road from London to Holyhead.Bowerman, p.39. In 1353 when Edward, the Black Prince, crossed the bridges, he ordered that 20 shillings should be spent on their repair.Bowerman, p.41. In the 17th century the surface of the road was disintegrating so badly that posts were set into the road to prevent the passage of carts, and it could be used only by pedestrians and horses. Goods were carried by convoys of packhorses led by a driver (or jagger) walking in front.Bowerman, pp.42‚Äì43. The pioneer female traveller Celia Fiennes crossed the bridges in 1698, as did Thomas Pennant in 1780.Bowerman, p.40. The present bridges probably date from the latter part of the 18th century. In 1824 Cheshire County Council proposed to divert the road from Nantwich to Chester and make it pass along Platts Lane, which would have led to the destruction of the bridges. However the land on which they stood belonged to the Marquess of Westminster, and he refused permission for the road to be diverted. Present day Hockenhull Platts consists of three humpback bridges which are approached and connected by causeways. The bridges are constructed from tooled blocks of red sandstone. The parapets are plain and are surmounted by chamfered coping stones which are joined by iron ties. The carriageway is formed from a mixture of stone setts and cobbles. The central bridge crosses the River Gowy. Formerly the three bridges and causeways were necessary because the whole area was too marshy to be crossed by any other means. However, in the 20th century a scheme was carried out to lower the water level of the whole of the River Gowy to prevent possible flooding of Stanlow Refinery, which is situated near the junction of the river with the Mersey. As a consequence, the marshes were drained and the footings of the central bridge were raised on a concrete foundation. The Baker Way long-distance path crosses the three bridges. =Nature reserve= The area to the west of the Gowy, including the westernmost bridge, has been converted into a nature reserve which is managed by Cheshire Wildlife Trust in an agreement with Grosvenor (Eaton) Estates. The nature reserve covers an area of about and access is by permit only. The reserve includes a trail (the Mill Trail), and habitats include a poplar plantation, reedbed and species-rich wet meadows. The poplar plantation is sparse and its wet nature has created an unusual stand of common reed at the ground layer. The reserve is also rich in bird life, with over 64 species recorded, including three species of summer visiting warblers, including sedge warbler. Otters have been recorded along the banks of the Gowy. Associated archaeological findings Immediately to the south of the central bridge is an earthwork which is visible only when the sun is low. It consists of a low ditched rectangular mound and an adjacent ring ditch. It probably dates from the post-medieval period. The area is otherwise covered by irregular drainage channels. In the area of Hockenhull Platts but at an uncertain location, some time before 1940 a pair of prehistoric translucent worked flints were found, one white and the other grey.

It may involve a frontal assault by one part of the force, playing a slower-moving or more static role. The second phase involves a more mobile force that maneuvers around the enemy and attacks from behind or the flank to deliver a decisive blow.Gat, Azar. War In Human Civilisation. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006. 340. The \\"hammer and anvil\\" tactic is fundamentally a single envelopment, and is to be distinguished from a simple encirclement where one group simply keeps an enemy occupied, while a flanking force delivers the coup de grace. The strongest expression of the concept is where both echelons are sufficient in themselves to strike a decisive blow. The \\"anvil\\" echelon here is not a mere diversionary gambit, but a substantial body that hits the enemy hard to pin him down and grind away his strength. The \\"hammer\\" or maneuver element succeeds because the anvil force materially or substantially weakens the enemy, preventing him from adjusting to the threat in his flank or rear.Allan Millet and Williamson Murray, ed. 2010. Military Effectiveness, vol 3. p 302 Other variants of the concept allow for an enemy to be held fast by a substantial blocking or holding force, while a strong echelon or hammer, delivers the decisive blow. In all scenarios, both the hammer and anvil elements are substantial entities that can cause significant material damage to opponents, as opposed to light diversionary, or small scale holding units.Millet and Williamson, Military Effectiveness, vol 3 History =Antiquity= The Battle of Issus, where Alexander the Great used the tactic to defeat the Persian army The tactic was well-known in Antiquity, as the maneuver's origins are Hellenistic and also because it often relied on light cavalry, ubiquitous in the ancient world. The tactic also worked well, however, with the heavy cataphracts of the Eastern world. It was popular in a number of battles fought by the ancient Greeks and Romans. In addition to being used in many of Alexander the Great's battles, it was also used during the Second Punic War during the Battle of Cannae and the Battle of Zama.Gat, Azar. War In Human Civilization. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006. 340. Pompey attempted to use his left flank cavalry as an \\"anvil\\" to sweep away Caesar's numerically inferior cavalry and attack his flank. Caesar countered this by ambushing this force with his 4th line In 48 BC, Pompey the Great attempted to use it against Julius Caesar at the Battle of Pharsalus, in what was to be the decisive battle of the Great Roman Civil War. Caesar countered this by ambushing Pompey's \\"anvil\\" element,Battle of Pharsalus in a notable failure of the tactic. =World War II= Battle of Caen The British anvil in the east, held the bulk of the German armor fast and worked it over, until the American hammer was able to breakthrough in the west, destroying the German front. When the allies landed at Normandy, the strategy used by the commander of the British land forces, general Bernard Montgomery, was to confront the feared German panzers with constantly attacking British armies on the eastern flank of the beachhead. The role of the British forces would be to act as a great shield for the Allied landing, constantly sucking the German armour on to a great \\"anvil\\" on the left (east), and constantly grinding it down with punishing blows from artillery, tanks and Allied heavy bombers.Nigel Hamilton, 1983. Master of the Battlefield pg 628-769 As the anvil held the bulk of the German armor fast, this would open the way for the Americans to wield a great \\"hammer\\" in the west, on the right of the Allied line, breaking through the German defenses, where the Americans led by such commanders as Patton, could run free. The British role would thus not be a glamorous one, but a tough battle in a punishing cauldron of attrition, in and around the key city of Caen.Hamilton, 1983. Master of the Battlefield pg 628-769 The Germans had initially counterattacked the Normandy beachhead with powerful panzer and mobile forces hoping to drive to the sea by creating a wedge between the US and British armies. Failing this, they were then faced with a large, menacing British advance towards the strategic city of Caen, that threatened to collapse a great portion of their front, presenting a credible and very dangerous breakthrough threat. The British and Canadian divisions were not a secondary, defensively-oriented holding force, but aggressively sought to penetrate and destroy the German position. The Germans were thus forced to commit their strongest echelons in the theatre, the mobile panzer and SS units to avoid this peril. These were pulled deeper and deeper against the attritional anvil on the eastern flank; this slowly ground down their strength and capability. The bitter confrontation tied down and weakened the Wehrmacht, thus eventually paving the way for a crushing American breakthrough in the west. As General Montgomery signalled on June 25, 1944: ::\\"When the American attack went in west of St Lo at 1100 hours on 25 July, the main enemy armoured strength of six panzer and SS divisions was deployed on the eastern flank facing the British Army. This is a good dividend. The Americans are going well and I think things will now begin to move towards the plan outlined in M512.\\"Hamilton, Master of the Battlefield, p757 Montgomery's overall \\"hammer and anvil\\" conception of the battle eventually bore fruit, but it took two months of bitter fighting in and around the city of Caen, as documented in such books as Alexander McKee's Caen: Anvil of Victory.Alexander McKee's Caen: Anvil of Victory, 2012. =The Ashanti versus the British - 1874= Scene from Third Anglo-Ashanti War 1874 The colonial wars of the 1800s saw some African armies deploy hammer and anvil tactics. In 1874 a strong British force under Sir Garnet Wolseley, armed with modern rifles and artillery, invaded the territory of the Ashanti Empire. The Ashanti did not confront the invaders immediately, and made no major effort to interdict their long, vulnerable lines of communication through the jungle terrain. Their plan appeared to be to draw the British deep into their territory, against a strong defensive anvil centred at the town of Amoaful. Here the British would be tied down, while manoeuvring wing elements circled to the rear, trapping and cutting them off. Some historians (Farwell 2001) note that this was approach was a traditional Ashanti battle strategy, and was common in some African armies as well.Byron Farwell. 2001. The encyclopedia of nineteenth-century land warfare. WW Norton. p 56. At the village of Amoaful, the Ashantis succeeded in luring their opponents forward, but could not make any headway against the modern firepower of the British forces, which laid down a barrage of fire to accompany an advance of infantry in squares. This artillery fire took a heavy toll on the Ashanti, but they left a central blocking force in place around the village, while unleashing a large flanking attack on the left, that almost enveloped the British line and successfully broke into some of the infantry squares. Ashanti weaponry however, was poor compared to the modern weapons deployed by the redcoats, and such superior arms served the British well in repulsing the dangerous Ashanti encirclements.The Victorians at war, 1815‚Äì1914: an encyclopedia of British military history. By Harold E. Raugh. ACL-CLIO: pp. 21‚Äì37 As one participant noted: :\\"The Ashantees stood admirably, and kept up one of the heaviest fires I ever was under. While opposing our attack with immediately superior numbers, they kept enveloping our left with a constant series of well-directed flank attacks.\\"Charles Rathbone Low, A Memoir of Lieutenant-General Sir Garnet J. Wolseley, R. Bentley: 1878, pp. 57‚Äì176 Wolesey had studied and anticipated the Ashanti \\"horseshoe\\" formations, and had strengthened the British flanks with the best units and reinforced firepower. He was able to shift this firepower to threatened sectors to stymie enemy maneuvers, defeating their hammer and anvil elements and forcing his opponents to retreat.The Victorians at war, 1815‚Äì1914: pp. 21‚Äì37 One British combat post-mortem pays tribute to the slain Ashanti commander for his tactical leadership and use of terrain: :\\"The great Chief Amanquatia was among the killed. Admirable skill was shown in the position selected by Amanquatia, and the determination and generalship he displayed in the defence fully bore out his great reputation as an able tactician and gallant soldier.\\"Charles Rathbone. A Memoir of Lieutenant- General Sir Garnet J. Wolseley. 1878, pg 174 = Battle of Santa Cruz 1942 = During the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands the Japanese empire cornered USS Enterprise (CV-6) and USS Hornet (CV-8) and launched 10 torpedoes at both ships. Enterprise dodged all the torpedoes, but a bomb hit her boilers and the steering room causing her to spin in circles. Hornet was not so lucky 10 Kates cornered the vessel and two of them scored a direct hit crippling the vessel. If that were not enough a damaged Val did a kamakazi run and smashed into the port side near the bow. Hornet was in flames but would not go down, so Admiral Bull Halsey ordered Hornet scuttled. After several failed attempts by the Americans the Japanese succeeded in scuttling Hornet with 4 Long Lance Torpedoes launched from the Makigumo and the Akigumo. =Soviet sweep operations in Afghanistan= See also *Encirclement  References  Category:Military tactics ","title":"Hammer and anvil"},{"id":"23118780","text":"Multilayer maps have been produced of the Cap-Vert peninsula, the most westerly point of Africa. These maps are based on information about different geological layers, stored in digital form in a Geographical Information System (GIS). Maps are available at scales of 1/50,000 and 1/20,000. Carried out in 2009, this is the first mapping project of this type to be undertaken in Senegal and the products have a range of applications. Multilayered mapping Traditional mapping can represent only one surface and therefore implies a choice from the authors about the most pertinent information to highlight. For example, traditional geological maps, printed on paper, choose generally to show the substratum of rocks underneath unrepresented soil cover. Multilayered mapping holds different layers of information in a Geographical Information System and allows the representation of each layer or a combination of them at request. While the geological substratum may be of interest for scientists and explorers looking for mineral resources, the superficial formations are important for the urbanists and builders in need of construction material. Multilayered mapping may thus cater for the needs of both sectors. Scale of 1/50,000 The numerical multilayered mapping at 1/50,000 of the area of activity of the Cap-Vert to the west of the 16¬∞40‚ÄôW meridian, provides Senegal with her first geological maps at this scale. The multilayered mapping fully developed on the GIS presents layers of topography, substratum geology, geology of cover formations, aquifers hydrogeology, aquifer potential, piezometry, hydrogeochemistry, aquifer vulnerability, underground invasion by brackish waters, listing of mines and quarries, mineral resources‚Äô potential and ground occupation.

(1976). However, the new dispensation proposes different maps for the solid geology and for the soft cover. Additional layers concern: aquifer contamination by nitrates and pesticides, susceptibility to the phenomena of swelling and shrinking soils, and geotechnical ability.

The GIS is a dynamic, interactive tool with its layers ready for continuous updating. Geometrical modelling of the volcanic and sedimentary formations reveals an unsuspected dense faulting system on the eastern side of the peninsula. Present building above potentially risky areas, on the western coast of the peninsula, is bound to draw a renewed attention to geotechnics in the foreseeable future. Availability New geological maps of Senegal (2009) also exist at the scales of 1/500,000 for three quarters of the territory and of 1/200,000 for the left bank of the Senegal River.

Through many programmes and initiatives that support and encourage entrepreneurship, volunteerism, sports and healthy living, arts & culture and youth development, amongst others, the spirit is to ensure that no one is left behind and everyone benefits from the development. Environmentally, development of Iskandar Malaysia is through a Green-focused Agenda, whereby green and sustainable environment is one of the main agenda. ‚ÄòIskandar Malaysia Low Carbon Society Blueprint‚Äô is acknowledged locally and globally and has driven many stakeholders in the region to adopt various green programmes and initiatives that benefit the businesses and community. Iskandar Malaysia is also developed to be a Smart City which encompasses the 6 dimensions of Smart Economy, Smart Governance, Smart Environment, Smart Mobility, Smart People and Smart Living and, is proud of its achievement in the creation of this pilot program for Smart cities across Malaysia and the region. The development of Iskandar Malaysia is planned, promoted and facilitated by Iskandar Regional Development Authority (IRDA). History The special economic zone of Iskandar Malaysia grew out of a 2005 government requested feasibility study by the Khazanah Nasional which found that the development of such a zone would be economically, socially and developmentally beneficial.Iskandar Regional Development Authority & Iskandar Malaysia Information Pack, 23 February 2007, Khazanah Nasional, pg 3, retrieved 3 March 2009 The National SJER Planning Committee (NSPC), hearing Khazanah's findings, put it in charge of developing a sustainable, holistic approach to development in the region. Iskandar Malaysia was singled out as among the high-impact developments of the Ninth Malaysia Plan, put into action by the then Prime Minister of Malaysia (Abdullah Badawi) in March 2006 to cover the period of 2006 to 2010.Rancangan Malaysia Kesembilan, Ministry of Information Malaysia, retrieved 4 March 2009 In November 2006, the Prime Minister, Chief Minister of Johor, Abdul Ghani Othman and Khazanah revealed the Comprehensive Development Plan (CDP). Area The development region encompasses an area of 4,749 km2 covering Johor Bahru District, Kulai District and Pontian District. 5 local government authorities have jurisdiction over the covered area, including Johor Bahru City Council, Iskandar Puteri City Council, Pasir Gudang Municipal Council, Kulai Municipal Council, Pontian District Council. The population of Iskandar Malaysia is slightly over 2 million in 2020. Comprehensive Development Plan =Physical Development Plan= The Physical Development Plan (PDP) was designed to guide the development of land within Iskandar Malaysia to help promote the CDP's overall goals of economic development and quality of life. To that end, the CDP includes two major subdivisions among land zones, \\"Basic Zoning Districts\\" and \\"Special Overlay Zones\\". There are several dozen primary \\"Basic Zoning Districts\\" governing the use of land in commercial, residential, industrial and other sectors, including determining the density of development and what mixed use may or may not be allowed.Free Access Zone under IDR scrapped, MEERA VIJAYAN, 5 April 2007, The Star (Malaysia) Also governed by the \\"Basic Zoning Districts\\" are such special use zones as green space, wetlands, cemeteries and governmental developments. \\"Special Overlay Zones\\" are areas that require exceptional treatment. For example, the \\"Johor Bahru CBD\\" allows exceptions to general commercial plot ratio and height because the zone is the commercial and financial centre of Iskandar Malaysia and the capital city of Johor. Similarly, the \\"Iskandar Puteri Central Planning Area\\" is given special handling. Other \\"Special Overlay Zones\\" cover environmentally sensitive areas, historic areas, coastland, development around highways and rail stations and the \\"Water Catchment Zone\\" around the Sultan Iskandar Dam. =Commercial development= The commercial focus of the CDP is on six services identified as \\"pillars\\", including creative, educational, financial, healthcare, logistics and tourism. The CDP included the establishment of the Iskandar Investment Berhad (formerly the South Johor Investment Corporation Berhad), a commercial investment holding company created to oversee and encourage regional development.Iskandar Regional Development Authority & Iskandar Malaysia Information Pack, 23 February 2007, Khazanah Nasional, pg 4, retrieved 3 March 2009 The CDP promotes the \\"Strategic Catalyst Development\\" goals of developing waterfront areas, promoting tourism, expanding healthcare and iconic areas, and mixing commercial and residential development. It also incorporates a \\"Business Incentives and Support Package\\" (ISP) discussed by Prime Minister Badawi on 22 March 2007 which allows special incentives to encourage investment in certain concentrated hubs in the flagship zones. The specific zones involved were revealed in October 2007 and at that time included only Medini Iskandar Malaysia, which is a mixed-development zone incorporating leisure, residential, financial and high-end industrial components. Incentives include tax exemptions for qualifying companies for income from qualifying activities,IRDA Announces 10 Year Tax Relief For Developers In Node 1 of Iskandar Development Region, Iskandar Malaysia, 9 October 2007, Malaysia exemption from Foreign Investment Committee rules, and flexibilities under the foreign exchange administration rules, including those restricting the numbers of \\"foreign knowledge workers\\". =Doubling sizes= On 22 February 2019, Iskandar Malaysia will growth corridor which doubled in size and will include at least two new districts which is Kluang and Kota Tinggi.

The five major highways linking the Johor Bahru Central Business District to outlying suburbs are Tebrau Highway and Johor Bahru Eastern Dispersal Link Expressway in the northeast, Skudai Highway in the northwest, Iskandar Coastal Highway in the west and Johor Bahru East Coast Highway in the east. Pasir Gudang Highway and the connecting Johor Bahru Parkway cross Tebrau Highway and Skudai Highway, which serve as the middle ring road of the metropolitan area. The Johor Bahru Inner Ring Road, which connects with the Sultan Iskandar customs complex, aids in controlling the traffic in and around the central business district. Access to the national expressway is provided through the North‚ÄìSouth Expressway and Senai‚ÄìDesaru Expressway. The Johor‚ÄìSingapore Causeway links the city to Woodlands, Singapore with a six-lane road and a railway line terminating at the Southern Integrated Gateway. The Malaysia‚ÄìSingapore Second Link, located west of the metropolitan area, was constructed in 1997 to alleviate congestion on the Causeway. It is linked directly to the Second Link Expressway, Johor Bahru Parkway, the railway station, and the North‚ÄìSouth Expressway. Further expansion of other major highways in the city were currently in the process. Public transportation Larkin Sentral Bus Terminal Larkin Sentral, located 5 kilometres northwest of the city centre has direct bus services to and from many destinations in West Malaysia, southern Thailand and Singapore. Two types of taxis operate in the city; the main taxi is either in red and yellow, blue, green or red while the larger, less common type is known as a limousine taxi, which is more comfortable but expensive. Grab operates in the city. and GrabTaxi. The Johor Bahru Sentral railway station serves train services to Kuala Lumpur and Singapore. In 2015, a new shuttle train service operated by Keretapi Tanah Melayu (KTM) was launched providing transport to Woodlands in Singapore. =Air= The region is served by Senai International Airport which is located in Senai. Six airlines, AirAsia, Firefly, Malaysia Airlines, Malindo Air , Jin Air and Xpress Air, provide flights internationally and domestically. =Sea= Johor Port is located in the eastern part of Iskandar Malaysia in the industrial area of Pasir Gudang. It is a seaport for commodities and mineral resources seaport, as Johor is home to a large number of major commercial plantations.

He was a Sindh member in the Bombay Legislative Assembly before Sindh became a province in 1936. After the accession of Sindh to Pakistan in 1947, he became the first speaker of the Sindh Assembly. He remained speaker of Sindh Legislative Assembly and Minister for the Government of Sindh. Miran Mohammad Shah also served as the first ambassador of Pakistan to Spain after the independence of Pakistan. Political life Miran Mohammad Shah was an avid member of Sir Shah Nawaz Bhutto's United Party in 1936, while serving under him as Sindh member of the Bombay Legislative Assembly. When the United Party stood in the provincial elections in 1937, Hindu moneylenders and the Indian National Congress spent large amounts of money to secure Bhutto's seat. Never in the history of India had there been such extravagant amounts of campaigning efforts done to secure a single seat. In this moment of likely defeat, Syed Miran Shah was one of the closest allies Bhutto had against his opponent Sheikh Abdul Majid Sindhi. Although the party suffered defeat in the provincial elections, they still managed to accumulate a good number of seats in the provincial assembly. Although Miran Mohammad Shah, along with some other prominent Sindhis including G. M. Syed, Pirzada Abdus Sattar, Pir Ilahi Bux, Allah Bux Soomro and Muhammad Hashim Gazdar expressed full confidence in Bhutto's leadership, Bhutto nevertheless decided to abdicate in favour of Sir Ghulam Hussain Hidayatullah. =Relationship with Allama Iqbal= So entwined was he in the prospects of the Pakistan Movement that he was at personal terms with the Allama Iqbal. Upon confirmation of his pilgrimage for Hajj in Mecca, he wrote to Iqbal in order to share the news. Iqbal responded with a letter dated 2 December 1937 stating, \\"Thank God you are well and busy in the preparations for Hajj. May God bless you in this journey. I wish I could accompany you. But alas, for me tile days of separation are not over as yet. I am not worthy of being called to the shrine of the Holy Prophet.\\" Political lineage Miran Mohammad Shah is the maternal grandfather of Syed Naveed Qamar, the Federal Minister for Petroleum, formerly the Finance Minister of Pakistan. Cultural strides As well as being a politician, Miran Mohammad Shah was a prominent Sindhi literary personality. He laid the foundation for the Sindhi Adabi Board (SAB) in order to preserve the culture of Sindh and the Sindhi language along with G.M Syed, Ali Muhammad Rashidi, Agha Badaruddin and several others. After the imposition of martial law by General Ayub Khan and the enforcement of the One Unit, the ruling elite minimised the involvement of writers-cum-politicians and imposed an embargo on the SAB to prevent it from publishing radical literature. Miran Mohammad Shah was amongst the politicians that ceased to function as members thenceforth. The Government of Pakistan has named a road in Karachi after his name to pay homage to him.

Davidson, 1st Viscount Davidson, and Frances, daughter of Willoughby Dickinson, 1st Baron Dickinson. He was educated at Westminster School and Pembroke College, Cambridge. Between 1947 and 1949 he served in the Black Watch and the 5th Battalion of the King's African Rifles before going up to Pembroke College, Cambridge, where he was known for his thespian talents, being president of the Footlights in 1951.Who's Who 2007. A & C Black Publishers Limited, London, 2007.thepeerage.com In 1960 he embarked on a 15-year career in large-scale farming, as a director of Strutt and Parker (Farms) and Lord Rayleigh Farms. By 1965 he was on the council of the Country Landowners Association (now the Country Land & Business Association). In 1966 he was appointed chairman of the Royal Eastern Counties Hospital for the mentally handicapped at Colchester, a job he considered the \\"most frustrating\\" of his life. Tensions with the regional hospital board which was ultimately responsible for the hospital boiled over in 1971, ostensibly because of the way Mauritian employees had been treated, and the following March the board sacked five members of the management committee. Political career Davidson entered the House of Lords on the death of his father in 1970. He served in the Conservative administrations of Margaret Thatcher and John Major as a Lord-in-waiting between 1985 and 1986.

Called a \\"great, great writer\\" by Endre Ady, she was one of the most important female Hungarian authors, and an important member of the Nyugat generation. Her writing was inspired by J√≥zsef Kiss, Mih√°ly Szabolcska, and the writers' group of the periodical H√©t.  Personal life  Margit Kaffka was born on 10 June 1880 in Nagyk√°roly (today Carei, Romania) into a family of minor Hungarian nobility (see her family's genealogy in Records of the T√∂t√∂sy de Zepetnek Family). Her father was a public prosecutor, but died early and the family lived under reduced circumstances. She received a scholarship to study at the Sisters of Mercy teacher's training college in Szatm√°r and in return she taught for one year in Miskolc. She studied in Budapest, receiving a teacher's diploma from the Erzs√©bet Girls' School. She returned to Miskolc, where she taught literature and economics in a private girls' school, beloved by students. This is the period when her first writings, poems, and novels appeared. She subsequently became a full-time contributor to Nyugat, the most important periodical of the era. She married Br√∫n√≥ Fr√∂hlich, a forestry officer, on 17 February 1905. In 1907 her husband moved to the Ministry of Agriculture, enabling Kaffka to move away from Miskolc, a town she did not like. However, their marriage became stressed after a few years, and ended in a divorce. Kaffka worked as a teacher in Budapest between 1910‚Äì1915. During this time, she published her best known work, Sz√≠nek √©s √©vek (1912) (Colors and Years). She married for the second time in 1914 to Ervin Bauer, the younger brother of B√©la Bal√°zs. At the beginning of the First World War she left her teaching job to focus full-time on her literary work. She died in the 1918 flu pandemic along with her young son.  Literature  Her works dealt mostly with two main themes: the fall of the gentry, and the physical and spiritual hardships of the independent women in the start of the 20th century. She often wrote about her personal memories of great national crises, the glaring oppositions of the anachronistic society in Hungary. Her literary career can be divided into three chapters, from 1901 to the start of Nyugat in 1908, the second ending in the start of the war in 1918, and the third marked by the hard years after the war ending in her death. 1912 marked the release of her first, and most important novel, Sz√≠nek √©s √âvek (Colours and Years) dealing with the fate of the gentry class and women. Her second most famed work is Hangyaboly (The Ant Heap) collecting her memories from the years at Sisters of Mercy was published in 1917.

Thomas (born January 19, 1948) is an American filmmaker. He has been in the film and television business for over 30 years. A graduate of the USC Film School in production plus a Masters in screenwriting, he has produced and directed dozens of documentaries, feature films and commercials. Among his feature credits are such films as Tin Man, Arizona Heat, Banzai Runner, Healer and most recently, Hamal 18. Early life Thomas spent most of his early life on the sea, near his home town of Coral Gables, Florida. At the age of 14, Thomas was proficient enough in boating to be the youngest person to sail from Florida to the Bahamas. By age 15, he was hitch-hiking across the United States, Mexico, and Canada. Afterwards, he became fascinated with cameras, and began to work in still photography. Soon after, he was selling photos to the local newspaper and regional magazine. By his late teens, Thomas not only produced a local weekly radio show, but also worked as a cameraman for television stations and designed lighting for Miami nightclubs. He even organized a large rock concert starring The Byrds, Steppenwolf, and others. Thomas also became involved in local productions including such projects as Flipper (1964 TV Series) and Gentle Ben (1967 TV series) by Ivan Tors. Too young to legally work, Thomas was often paid under-the-table for doing jobs nobody else wanted to do. This sparked Thomas' passion in film, and soon after graduating high school he moved to Hollywood. At the USC School of Cinematic Arts, Thomas struggled alongside other to-be-famous film students like George Lucas, Ron Howard, and John Carpenter. After years of facing the constant threat of being kicked out, Thomas was one of five out of four hundred beginning students who graduated. Career =Early career= Thomas, unlike his peers, focused on Documentary film instead of the feature favored by his peers. Over the next decade, he made 37 documentaries, shorts, and television programs on a varied range of subjects such as aviation, genetic engineering, solar energy, and bluegrass music. He also photographed a land speed record attempt by Kitty O'Neil. During this period, he received many national and international awards for his work. His films were also shown at the Whitehouse and the Vatican. However, in 1983, Thomas decided to give feature films a shot. His first feature, Tin Man (1983), is the story of a deaf computer genius (Timothy Bottoms) who invents a computer which allows him to speak. The film was received with much enthusiasm and earned the title of Official U.S. entry at the San Sebastian International Film Festival. Thomas' next feature, Banzai Runner (1987), starring Dean Stockwell, centers around the death of a cop mixed up in a race involving a group of wealthy drivers and custom high- speed cars on a deserted desert highway. Banzai Runner went on to become the \\"‚Ä¶top selling (non-studio) video in the first year of its release.\\" according to Variety. The next film done by Thomas was Arizona Heat (1988), a film crossing cultural boundaries by pairing a tough cop with a lesbian cop in their mutual pursuit of a serial killer. Arizona Heat was also greatly successful. =Breaking from film= Tired from the grind of production, Thomas dropped out of filmmaking for three years. During this, Thomas faced emotional difficulties of having to put his mother into a rest home. The experience led to the eventual production of his next film, Healer (1994). A true story that chronicles the bizarre and often humorous lives of two paramedics in a retirement town. Earning the spot of opening night selection at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival, the films stars such actors as Tyrone Power Jr., David McCallum, Delane Matthews, and Turhan Bey. Tobey Maguire also makes an appearance in the film. Thomas then took another break and worked in Los Angeles at the Department of Children Protection Services. Contracted by IBM, Thomas witnessed juvenile justice and observed many cases of child abuse. For his work, he received a Commendation from the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. Thomas felt enriched by this experience and was inspired to once again work in film. Immediately attracted to the script, Thomas created his next film Hamal 18. This story follows a detective as he searches for a pedophile on the internet. Aside from creating films, Thomas also programmed specialized budgeting software for feature films, called Easy Budget. This program, developed from Thomas' own production experience, is sold all across the world. =Recent years= Thomas writes scripts for distributors and production companies as a script doctor. Thomas' writing work extends from The Los Angeles Times and The Hollywood Reporter, to VOA and NPR. Thomas published his first book \\"Making the Tin Man: How I Made My First Feature Film.\\" This first-hand account records the trials and tribulations Thomas experienced when making his first feature film. Thomas teaches filmmaking techniques at several colleges, universities, and local high schools. Most recently, Thomas acquired his master's degree in screenwriting, and is a recognized expert in the area of internet child safety. Personal life Today, Thomas enjoys spending much of his time with his wife and two daughters. Thomas has a passion for flying, being an instrument-rated pilot. He is also an active member in his community, participating in programs that deliver Christmas gifts to underprivileged children.

Hughes served in both the First and Second World War and is notable for his role in the care and rehabilitation of the victims of Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. Early history Hughes was born in Ventersburg, South Africa on 24 July 1892 and spent the first two years of his life in South Africa, after his father emigrated to take a medical post. When Hughes was two his father died from an infection caused by pricking his finger during an operation. Hughes and his mother returned to Britain, but at the age of seven Hughes was diagnosed with having curvature of the spine and at one time was confined to a spinal carriage. He was educated at Epsom College, and with his health issues behind him, threw himself into school life. After leaving school, like his father before him, Hughes decided to become a medical practitioner, and was accepted to University College Hospital in London.Starmer-Smith, p. 211. Military career =First World War= After graduating from College in 1915, Hughes joined the British Army and served in the First World War as a medical officer. He was attached to the Wiltshire Regiment from 1915 to 1918, and to the Grenadier Guards from 1918 to 1919. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) on 25 August 1916 while a subaltern and within four months had been awarded a Bar to his DSO. His DSO citation reads: His Bar citation is as follows: Hughes was heavily decorated during the First World War, and before its end he was awarded the Military Cross, the Croix de guerre avec palme and was several times Mentioned in Despatches; he was also seriously wounded on three separate occasions. With the end of the war, Hughes returned to his medical duties, becoming a General Practitioner in Chagford, but remained in the Army reserve at the rank of lieutenant. =Second World War= Group photo of London Medical students who went to Belsen Wellcome - Hughes is in the centre of the front row With the outbreak of the Second World War, Hughes was mobilised in 1939 and sent to France with the 5th Infantry Division. After the fall of France in June 1940, he spent his time training medical units for active service. By 1944 he had been promoted to brigadier and became Deputy Director Medical Services to the VIII Corps and the Second Army, and became the Chief Medical Officer in the advance, serving in this capacity throughout the North West Europe Campaign, including Operation Overlord. On 15 April 1945, while attached to the 11th Armoured Division, Hughes became the first Allied Medical Officer to enter the concentration camp at Bergen-Belsen. Hughes took control of the camp and the 4,600 German and Hungarian soldiers placed at his command by the German authorities. Hughes' two main issues were the control of disease, after an outbreak of typhus, and the distribution of food. To aid with the general health of the camp victims, Hughes took control of the local hospital, removing the German patients to treat his new charges. The hospital was later renamed the Glyn Hughes Hospital in his honour. The distribution of rations was a far greater problem, and with only 120 British troops, the German soldiers were ordered to assist in the control of food in the camp. On the first night of the liberation a riot broke out among the inmates over limited rations and the German guards reacted by shooting and killing several of them. To ensure this situation did not repeat itself, Hughes threatened to execute a German soldier for every inmate killed. In September 1945, Hughes was one of the main witnesses for the prosecution in the Belsen Trial.Brigadier H. L. Glyn Hughes, C.B.E., D.S.O., M.C. Case No. 10 ‚Äì The Belsen Trial, from Law-Reports of Trials of War Criminals, The United Nations War Crimes Commission, Volume II, London, HMSO, 1947 For his actions at Belsen, Hughes was awarded the Order of St. John of Jerusalem and the Legion of Merit. He also received a second Bar to his DSO, for actions during the attempted relief of Arnhem from the South, earlier in the campaign, where as the most senior surviving officer, he took command of the tanks. In 1945 he was appointed a CBE. With the end of the war, Hughes took up the position as Commandant of the RAMC depot in Crookham, with his final military post being an Inspector of Training.Hughes, Brigadier Hugh Llewellyn Glyn generals.dk Later career After leaving the forces in 1947, Hughes took up the first of his senior medical administrative posts, when he became the senior medical officer of the South East Metropolitan Hospital Board.Starmer-Smith, p. 212. In this position he played a prominent role in the administration of the newly created National Health Service, and again in 1952 with the formation of the Royal College of General Practitioners. He held several titles before his retirement, including Honorary Physician to the Queen, President of the Harveian Society and Medical Officer to the British Red Cross Society. He was the director of a general practice in South East London until his retirement in 1968. He was the subject of the British television series This Is Your Life in 1959 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews at the BBC Television Theatre. Rugby career Outside his professional career, Hughes was a very keen sportsman, with his main interest being rugby union. At Epsom College he was captain of the rugby XV, and as an adult played club rugby for Blackheath F.C.. During the 1912/13 season he was selected to play for invitational touring team the Barbarians, an association which would continue until his death. His first match for the Barbarians was during the 1913 tour in the traditional tour encounter with Penarth, before playing against Cardiff and Swansea. He played a total of 20 games for the Barbarians over nine tours, scoring a try against Newport in 1925Starmer-Smith, p. 111. and captained the team for three matches between 1919 and 1920. Hughes played for multiple rugby teams, most notably United Hospitals of which the University College Hospital was connected. He also represented several county teams, including Devon, Middlesex, London Counties and captained Exeter. After retiring from playing rugby, Hughes continued his association with rugby as a rugby administrator and referee. In 1936, like Tommy Vile before him in the 1927 tour, Hughes was chosen to act as referee in the Great Britain tour of Argentina. He wore his Barbarian jersey on the field during the tour. When in 1928, Emile de Lissa was made Vice-President of the Barbarians, Hughes was elected as Treasurer, and when Jack Haigh-Smith died suddenly in 1955, Hughes was made President of the club.A Brief History: Presidents Barbarianfc.co.uk Hughes remained President until his death in 1973, and held the post when the Barbarians famously beat the 1973 touring \\"All Blacks\\" at the Cardiff Arms Park. It was Hughes who blocked John Taylor from becoming a Barbarian in the 1973 match, branding him a \\"Communist\\" for refusing to face the South African rugby team for Wales during apartheid.John Taylor: Rebel with a Cause The Independent, 30 May 2009 Hughes died on 24 November 1973 in Edinburgh, three days after watching an international rugby game between Scotland and Argentina.

Austin (born c. 1929) Is an amateur weightlifter / powerlifter and member of the Maine Sports Hall of Fame. Life and career Austin lived in the Virginia section of Rumford all his school age years with an exception of a year when he lived in Boston. Dick took up weight training at age 13 and has continued that training habit to this day. In 1946 at the age of 17 he quit school and went to work for the Gulf Oil Co. in Chelsea, Massachusetts for one year. At age 20 he went to work for Oxford Paper Co., retiring in 1989. After working at Oxford for a few months he enlisted into the Army Airborne for 3 years. This was during the Korean War. He got into the 82nd Airborne Division and made 33 jumps in all. Jumping out of airplanes excited him; he says it was an enjoyable experience to say the least. From 4-6-51 to 4-6-54 and army life wasn‚Äôt for him. Food was lousy! He finished his schooling when he first got in and got his GED Equivalency Diploma. After an honorable discharge he returned home and went back to work in one month. In 1955 he married Annette Salatino, who died 12-14-05. They have 5 children and 12 grandchildren. It 1958 he broke all the existing two and one arm weight lifting records in Maine. Regular training took place until Mike Roy talked him into power-lifting competition. By 1980 he won his first world title and has continued on ever since, never once being defeated. He says, I wonder what it‚Äôs like to come in second? In his mind, that‚Äôs the first loser. He has a half dozen world and half dozen national titles and many of his records still exist. In fact, Sunday, April 5 he broke 2 world records but there wasn‚Äôt any listed. At 78 he finds it quite lonely in finding competition at his age. In 1998 a huge party at the Legion hosted by his sister- in-law, Lucy Day was given for him. It turned out to be a huge roast from all his close friends. From there he traveled to Austria with son Dicky and won a world title in which 16 countries competed. His forte, so to speak, in years past, especially, was training school kids. Jerry Perkins had some of his wrestlers train with him to develop added strength. It worked out well. Several hundred kids have trained at his gym for the betterment of their sports skills and after college and during they still come to train there, I hear the price is OK, advice on training is given freely and he enjoys sharing his knowledge with anyone willing to listen. For 38 years Alan Cayer has been lifting with Dick! He now possesses 3 World Titles and has made outstanding recognition in the Power-Lifting World. In 1999 Dick was inducted into the Maine Sports Hall of Fame.http://www.mshof.com/index.php?p=5&s;=3&id;=172 He presently is on the Board of Directors and also on the Honors and Selection Committee, whose job is to select potential incoming inductees.

Early life and education BonDurant attended Columbia University for one year before transferring to Cincinnati Christian University. He graduated from Cincinnati Christian University in 1936. Atlanta Christian College After several unsuccessful attempts by other parties to start a Christian college in the Atlanta, Georgia area, BonDurant and his wife, Sarah BonDurant (n√©e Presley), founded Atlanta Christian College in 1937. Financial resources were provided by Fulton County Judge T. O. Hathcock. BonDurant served as the college's first President until he resigned over a dispute with the trustees in 1947. Mid-Atlantic Christian University BonDurant then found employment as an evangelist of the Roanoke District Christian churches and churches of Christ in eastern North Carolina in 1947. The BonDurants founded Mid-Atlantic Christian University (known as Roanoke Bible College until 2009) in Elizabeth City, North Carolina in 1948 due to the extreme lack of preachers in the area at the time. Under his leadership, Mid-Atlantic Christian University received its first school accreditation in 1979 from the Association for Biblical Higher Education. BonDurant retired in 1986 and was succeeded by William A. Griffin.

The palace was constructed for the brothers Giovanni Giacomo, Pier Antonio, Vincenzo, and Francesco Civena. History The date \\"1540\\" engraved on the foundation medal, preserved in the Museo Civico di Vicenza, fixes the laying of the foundation stone to that year. The building was probably finished twenty-four months later, six months before the start of works on the Palazzo Thiene. The history of the palace includes being heavily modified by Domenico Cerato in 1750, being half destroyed by Allied bombardment during World War II (with the Teatro Eretenio at his side) and thence reconstructed only for its fa√ßade. Architecture Palazzo Civena was not included in the Quattro Libri dell'Architettura by Palladio (1570), but various autograph drawings by Palladio exist to document the several alternatives he elaborated during the design stage. Today‚Äôs distribution of internal spaces does not replicate Palladio‚Äôs definitive idea but is the fruit of Cerato‚Äôs heavy interventions, which prolonged the atrium and modified the stairs. The original plan, however, may be reconstructed thanks to a 19th-century survey published in 1776 by Ottavio Bertotti Scamozzi (according to whom it was obtained from the proprietors): the grouping of rooms in two nuclei placed to either side of the atrium, with a serliana providing the filter to the exterior, is very close to Palladio‚Äôs villa projects in the same years. The very early date of the project makes Palazzo Civena evidence of Palladio‚Äôs youthful activity and his architectural culture before the journey to Rome in 1541. As was already the case with the villa at Cricoli, this building marks a rupture with constructional praxis in Vicenza: the traditional polifora at the centre of the fa√ßade has been substituted with a regular sequence of bays, rhythmically articulated by paired pilasters. In this respect Palladio was evidently inspired by the Roman palaces of the early 16th-century (Cinquecento), but it is clear that this did not result from direct acquaintance: the building‚Äôs fa√ßade is devoid of any real plastic substance and seems cut from a sheet of paper. Moreover, all the elements of his architectural vocabulary derive from Venetian models, not Roman ones, above all the buildings realised by Giovanni Maria Falconetto in Padua.

Even though it was filmed in color, back then RAI's shows were still being shown in black and white, since they didn't convert to color TV until 1977. Plot Flora is a faded sciantosa (i.e. variety show diva), played by Anna Magnani, whose career has declined. When she receives an invitation to sing at an army base, she thinks she's singing to the front line soldiers, so she accepts the invitation. She and her assistant, Cristina, played by Rosita Pisano, are met at the train station by Tonino, a young soldier, played by Massimo Ranieri. He then drives the ladies to the army base, and then introduces them to his misfit band of musicians, including a very annoying horn player, who almost causes Flora not to want to sing for the soldiers, and a guitar player, who ruins a march song by blowing a kazoo at the end. Flora's set to take the stage, draped in an Italian flag and wearing a crown. But when the curtain opens, and she sees the severity of some of the soldiers' injuries, she gets instant stage fright. After two unsuccessful tries to get her to do the march song, Tonino tells the band to play \\"'O surdato 'nnammurato\\", which Anna Magnani herself beautifully sings. At that point, she has an epiphany and breaks down. After the performance, the base being under attack, Tonino helps Flora out of the building. Unfortunately, she and Cristina get separated, and towards the end of the movie, Flora realizes how much she mistreated Cristina, and decides to sacrifice herself by shielding Tonino from an enemy plane firing at his car.

It was formed on 23 April 1943 during World War II as the Australian Army Dental Corps, before being granted the 'Royal' prefix in 1948. Prior to its formation dentists were part of the Australian Army Medical Corps. The role of the RAADC is to provide dental care to army personnel in order to minimise the requirement for the evacuation of dental casualties, to conserve manpower and to reduce the burden of casualty evacuation. In the post-war years, the corps has provided personnel to deployments in Japan, Korea and Vietnam. It has also contributed to peace-keeping operations in Somalia, Rwanda, Bougainville and East Timor. History =World War I= Although it was officially formed in 1943, the corps has its genesis in an earlier formation that was raised for service during World War I as part of the Australian Army Medical Corps.Dennis et al 2008, p. 462. Prior to the war some efforts had been made to try to raise a dental service in the Australian military as part of the institution of universal military service as a result of lessons learned during the Sudan Expedition and the Boer War, however, these attempts had not come to fruition. Upon the outbreak of the war in 1914, there was no provision for establishment or organisation of dental services in the British Order of Battle, upon which Australia based its own Order of Battle at the time. Therefore, despite advice from dentists and requests from formation commanders at the outset of the war, the army thought there was no need for dental services, nor even for the supply of dental medicines or equipment.Tyquin (1993), p. 135 However, even though the Australian authorities initially saw no need to provide dental services to soldiers, a number of trained dentists volunteered for service and provided dental services on their own initiative.Kuusk (2006), p. 23. In the official absence of interest from the Army, many dentists and dental technicians volunteered as medical orderlies or even as infantrymen, in order to serve their country. Largely the services of dental volunteers were also rejected when the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force was raised for deployment against German possessions in the Pacific. However, the senior Australian medical officer, Lieutenant Colonel (later Major General) Neville Howse, approved the attachment of John Henderson, a fourth year dental student, to deploy with them. Henderson later transferred to the infantry and was killed at Pozi√®res in 1916, while serving as a captain in the 13th Battalion. He nevertheless has the distinction of being the first dentist to serve officially in the Army in that capacity. Later, as the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) was raised, a dental officer was recruited and situated in each military district with the remit of providing advice to senior medical personnel. They were not to carry out dental procedures, however, and as a result civilian dentists offered free services to soldiers while undertaking training in Australia. Upon the AIF's arrival in Egypt in 1915, General William Throsby Bridges argued the case for dentists to be attached to the army in the field, stating that it would reduce the instances of soldiers having to be evacuated from the field as 'dental casualties'. While some progress towards mitigating this was taken in January 1915 when the Australian Army Medical Corps (Dental) Reserve was approved, appointments were slow and consequently the AIF troops that deployed to Gallipoli did so without dental support. Dental health became a serious problem for the Australian army on the Gallipoli Peninsula, contributing as early as June 1915 to a significant number of medical evacuations from the front lines.Tyquin (1993), pp. 133-136. By July 1915, over 600 soldiers from the 1st Division alone had been evacuated as dental casualties.Kuusk (2006), p. 24. Not only were dental health problems debilitating in their own way, but the makeshift supply system at the time was not able to provide rations that could be consumed by men with poor teeth, missing teeth or broken dental plates. Furthermore, the untreated dental caries (rotten teeth) lead to systemic infections and digestive problems. In spite of these official restrictions, battalion and brigade commanders had soon realised there was a glaring shortcoming. They had begun to recognise that they had dentists in their own ranks, who were then transferred by their infantry commanders to the field ambulance services attached to their own infantry formations, to work under the Regimental Medical Officers commanding those field ambulance units. Prior to this, dentists in the ranks had also been treating their own comrades as best they could. Some dentists had brought their own equipment, the Red Cross provided some, while some makeshift dental equipment was also adapted from medical equipment available on the Peninsula.Tyquin (1993), p. 136. However, once the severity of dental health problems had become apparent, the Australian Army Medical Corps began to transfer qualified men from other arms of the service into a makeshift, poorly equipped, but officially sanctioned, dental service under the command of the Australian Army Medical Service. It was not until 6 July 1915, well into the Gallipoli campaign, that this small dental service, officially staffed and equipped, had been established at Gallipoli within the Australian Army Order of Battle.Dennis et al. (2008), p. 462. In June 1915, a strength of 39 personnel, consisting of 13 lieutenants and 26 senior non-commissioned officer and other ranks was authorised. In July 1915, six dental officers were dispatched overseas from Australia, while another four were appointed from personnel already stationed in Egypt. In December 1915 further progress was made when Howse, who was a firm believer in the requirement for dental personnel to provide for the needs of soldiers, was appointed Director General Medical Services AIF.Kuusk (2006), p. 25. In February 1916, a home establishment was created and the process of creating dental units began in April. Thirty-six dental units were formed at this time, and they were allotted between varying levels of medical facilities ranging from field ambulances to general hospitals and training bases. When the AIF divisions were transferred to France to fight on the Western Front, these units proceeded with the divisions, with three dental sections being allocated to each division and one unit to each field ambulance. As the war progressed, the importance placed upon dental health within the AIF increased and by early 1917 stricter standards were being enforced on recruits and dental officers were given the power to require personnel to be paraded for dental inspections. Initially, the ranks held by dental officers were honorary, but in June 1917 these were made substantive. To improve the management of the service, staff officers were appointed to oversee the units in France, the United Kingdom and Egypt.Kuusk (2006), p. 26. By the end of the war, there were 130 dental officers serving overseas, representing a ratio of one dental officer per 4,250 men. =Inter war years= By 1920, the dental service had been demobilised. During the interwar years, the focus of Australia's military planning was upon maintaining a reduced permanent force with a larger part- time military force.Keogh (1965), p. 35. The need for dental services was thus greatly reduced and, as a result, they were largely provided by civilian dentists that were also serving in the Militia, although a small number of permanent dental staff were retained on the establishment. Nevertheless, in 1928 an inspector of dental services was appointed, and although training opportunities were limited due to the economic hardships of the Great Depression,Keogh (1965), p. 44. throughout the interwar years the service developed its capabilities and corporate knowledge through a series of tactical exercises. =World War II= An Australian dental team works on a patient during the Siege of Tobruk, 1941. Following the outbreak of World War II, the small number of full-time dental personnel were augmented by Militia officers and civilian volunteers. Although early enlistment was low, as part of the mobilisation process, in October 1939 provision was made for the establishment of dental units consisting of one dental officer, two dental mechanics and one clerk orderly, who were to be placed within three field ambulances, one casualty clearing station, two general hospitals and one convalescent depot. Initially, dental equipment and supplies were insufficient for the tasks required, with a single division requiring an estimated 50,000 fillings, 40,000 extractions and 10,000 dentures, however, personnel managed to overcome this through the acquisition of stores from local areas. On 23 April 1943, authorisation was given for the service to split from the Medical Corps and for the formation of a separate corps known as the Australian Army Dental Corps. Upon the new corps' establishment, it was assigned a \\"burnt orange\\" hexagonal colour patch, however, this was later changed to a rectangular shape in November 1945. By 1944, the corps consisted of 435 dentists. Throughout the war, dental units were deployed alongside fighting troops into all theatres of operation in which Australians were deployed, including the Middle East and the Pacific, where they provided emergency treatment as close to the front line as possible, taking part in beach landings and also trekking overland on the Kokoda Track during the New Guinea campaign. On occasions dental supplies were dropped by parachute to forward units in the field.Walker (1952), p. 613. Within the operational setting the focus was almost exclusively on emergency treatment, however, and routine or preventative work was undertaken \\"only when the situation allowed\\". By October 1945, the corps had personnel spread across the gamut of organisational structures within the Army, including at formation, corps, line of communication, base and depot levels. Dental officers were also placed on the hospital ships, Manunda and Wanganella.Kuusk (2006), p. 27. Following the end of the war, the corps was slowly reduced as the demobilisation process took place, however, their status as service troops meant that they were retained for longer as there was a requirement for demobilising soldiers from other corps to receive dental treatment prior to discharge. A number of advances in clinical practice occurred during the conflict, with the development of acrylic resin for the manufacture of dentures, the involvement of dental surgeons in facio-maxillary surgery as part of the treatment of soldiers suffering from facial trauma‚Äîincluding plastic surgery and the fitting of moulds for epithelial inlays and skin and bone grafts‚Äîas well as developments in the manufacture of artificial eyes.Walker (1952), pp. 614‚Äì615. =Post war= During the post-war period, dental units were raised for service in Japan as part of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force in 1946. In 1948, Australia's part-time military force was re-raised under the guise of the Citizens Military Force (CMF),Grey (2008), p. 200. and dental units were raised in each State to provide support to CMF units. Regular Army units were also raised in each State, and at major training establishments.Kuusk (2006), p. 28. That year the corps gained Royal assent when they were granted the title of the Royal Australian Army Dental Corps in recognition of its service during the war. At this time the corps colour was changed to green, although it was changed back to burnt orange in 1961. Later, further Regular Army units were raised for overseas service during the Korean War, Confrontation and the Vietnam War.Kuusk (2006), pp. 28‚Äì29. Throughout the Cold War years, the corps was reorganised a number of times during 1960, 1970 and 1981; upon the adoption of the Pentropic divisional establishment individual units were assigned to divisions \\"on the basis of one unit per 5,000 troops\\",Kuusk (2006), p. 29. although they were not assigned as organic assets. Later, each division was allocated two dental units as organic assets; these were later combined into single units with a headquarters and 12 sections, equipped with light vehicles and trailers, and consisting of 14 officers and 42 soldiers of varying ranks. This represented a ratio of one section per 1,000 personnel. Throughout the 1990s, the corps contributed to various peacekeeping operations, including those in Northern Iraq, Somalia, Rwanda, Bougainville and East Timor. In 1995, dental units became part of the medical companies that were established within brigade administrative support battalions (BASBs), which were formed through the amalgamation of field ambulance, dental and psych units. The BASBs later became known as combat service support battalions (CSSBs) in 2001. These units are augmented by base level facilities located in each State, which are maintained by tri-service and civilian staff.Kuusk (2006), p. 30. Due to advances within the basic level of dental fitness required of Australian Army personnel, the current focus of dental care provided by the corps is on prevention, in order to minimise the requirement for the evacuation of dental casualties, to conserve manpower and to reduce the burden of casualty evacuation.

It was designed and prototyped in the early 1960s, by the 50 C/s Group (a European consortium for promotion of using 25 kV AC/50 Hz on railway routes.The consortium consisted of rail electrification expert companies Siemens, Alsthom, AEG, M.F.Oerlikon, Brown- Boveri and seven smaller firms) commissioned by the Hungarian government. It was further developed, debugged and series produced in the Ganz factory and operated by M√ÅV in Hungary. A total of 379 locomotives were built between 1963 and 1982 to replace the M√ÅV Class V40 and M√ÅV Class V60, as well as the widespread Class 424 steam locomotives. Nickname of the classic V43 1000 series is Szili (because it has silicon Semiconductor); V43 2000 series is Papag√°j (Parrot - because of the painting); V43 3000 series is Cirmos (Tabby - also because of the painting). Initially the ones produced in Germany, could operate on 16 kV AC supply as well. The V43 is the still the main workhorse for electric traction in Hungary. Its early generation semiconductor technology is now considered obsolete, but the type has good efficiency for both freight and passenger traction. The good efficiency is a result of a technical deficiency: the Hungarian series produced V43 examples are two tons overweight compared the German prototype owing to steel frame manufacturing differences. This requires the locomotives to constantly work near the edge of their power reserve when pulling and efficiency is coincidentally the highest in that region. Extensive preventive maintenance procedures developed by M√ÅV depots allowed the V43 to serve 40+ years reliably, despite of being maxed out most of the time.  GySEV  GySEV owns 14 V43 class locomotives. GySEV equipped a few of them with PZB I60R for operation on the Austrian lines of the company. The GySEV locos had several catastrophic crashes. V43 331 crashed at Neufeld, and V43 322 at Kom√°rom. Both locomotives were scrapped. V43 333 crashed with V43 326, and rebuilt using the mainframe of the damaged V43 1003.  Refit  From 1999 the series had two refitment sessions. The first session refits 56 locomotives (V43 2xxx) and equipped them with digital control system to cooperate with the modernised control cars (BDt 4xx series). They also had new suspension fitted. The second 30 locomotive (V43 3xxx) produced between 2007 and 2008. These locomotives equipped with ZWS control system to be remotely controlled from the control cars bought from DB (Bybdtee series). http://www.railfaneurope.net/list/hungary/hungary_mav_loc.html  Future  The V43 will is being gradually replaced in M√ÅV service by modern Bombardier TRAXX locomotives. Meanwhile a part of the fleet has received minimal upgrades to comply with EUROFIMA requirements and about half of all V43s are now equipped by modern \\"semi-pantograph\\" type catenary current collectors. From the middle of 2011 M√ÅV-Trakci√≥ started to change the class numbers to meet the new UIC standardizations. The V43 1xxx series changed to 431 xxx, the V43 2xxx to 432 xxx and the V43 3xxx to 433 xxx.

The earthwork is 4.5 miles long between the River Lark at Lackford and the Icknield Way. It is described by the Suffolk Historic Environment Record as having no direct dating evidence but \\"by analogy with other linear earthworks in the region it is usually assumed to be post Roman\\". Two sections of ditch remain visible, one to the north-east of the village and one to the south- east, covering a total of . An stretch south of Cavenham is designated as an SSSI. Access to the Black Ditches is limited, with no public right of way. History Cyril Fox thought Black Ditches was the most easterly of a series of five earthworks that defended the East Anglian kingdom of the Wuffings along the Icknield Way, the others being collectively known as the Cambridgeshire Dykes - Devil's Dyke, Fleam Dyke, Bran Ditch and Brent Ditch.Fox.C (1923) The archaeology of the Cambridge region: a topographical study of the Bronze, Early Iron, Roman and Anglo-Saxon Ages, with an introductory note on the Neolithic Age, pp.123-124. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press (available online). It is not as well preserved as the western defences. A small excavation in 1992 found that the Black Ditches had a ditch on either side of the bank. Only Iron Age pottery was recovered in this excavation. The total length of the ditches is around stretching from south of Cavenham towards Icklingham, although there is no evidence of the ditch crossing the River Lark at Icklingham. The Icknield Way crosses the line of the ditch towards the central area. In this area the ditch is generally no longer visible. The northern section of ditch remaining is around in length running across the eastern edge of Cavenham Heath towards the River Lark. The section is less well preserved, although up to high and wide in places. This section is not designated as an SSSI although it lies on the boundary of the Breckland Farmland SSSI.

He plays Michaelangelo, an unemployed stage actor in Naples, Italy. In 2009 the film was awarded with the Italian version of a Golden Globe Award for \\"Best Original Score.\\" That same year Massimo Ranieri won Best Actor at the Flaiano Intentional Prizes for his role in the film.  Plot Summary  Michaelangelo tries to make amends with his son, Francesco, who's still angry about his parents' divorce and feels that his father's acting career is more important to Michaelangelo than his own son. Francesco tells his father that he's going to go hang out with his friends, but he ends up getting involved in a Mafia killing, so he runs off to France. Michaelangelo becomes frantic and starts looking for his son. He visits his ex-wife, who tries to help him find Francesco. When he realizes Francesco's whereabouts, he goes to France and locates the boy. Unfortunately, it's not a happy reunion between father and son.. Michaelangelo loses his temper, slaps his son's face, and storms out. Francesco apologizes to his father, and the two continue roaming the French streets. Soon, they discover an old run-down theater, owned by an eccentrically faded French actress, Marie, played by Andrea Asti. Michaelangelo suggests that they start having performances in the theater. Marie accepts the offer on the condition that Michaelangelo teaches acting to a young group of street performers. He accepts the offer, and Francesco reluctantly agrees to join him. Michaelangelo visits the hangout of the French street performers, and forges a friendship with them, including an impromptu jam session. Unfortunately, the French police commissioner makes a couple of visits to the theater, first to interrogate Francesco about being in the country illegally as well as Marie, who claims she's a naturalized French citizen, and then end up taking a young Islamic man, Mohamed, into custody, claiming \\"it's a simple formaslity\\". But after roughing up the young man, he is released. But then, the second time, the whole swat team-like police force throws tear gas and starts shooting rubber bullets at Cecilia and her group. Michaelangelo starts to intervene when he witnesses the police start beating up a young unarmed male. The truly most touching scene of the film is when Francesco finally tells his father the truth about why he's wanted by the police and Michaelangelo and Francesco emotionally embrace each other.

Junik was occupied by the KLA early in the war and became a centre of arms smuggling from northern Albania due to its strategic location. The town was besieged by the Yugoslav Army (VJ) and Ministry of Internal Affairs (MUP) on 28 July 1998, and was the site of intense clashes for nearly three weeks afterwards. On 16 August, it was stormed by the Special Anti-Terrorist Unit, the special operations component of the MUP, forcing the remaining KLA fighters to flee into the surrounding hills and forests. Four MUP personnel and two VJ soldiers were killed in the battle, according to contemporary reports. The KLA suffered 13 fatalities. In addition, there were eight Kosovo Albanian civilian fatalities. An additional 12,000 Kosovo Albanian civilians were displaced. After Junik's fall, the United States expressed concern that government forces had planted landmines around the town. In direct response to the town's capture, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 1199 on 23 September 1998, calling for an end to hostilities in Kosovo. Background Following World War II, Kosovo was given the status of an autonomous province within the Socialist Republic of Serbia, one of six constitutional republics of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. After the death of Yugoslavia's long-time leader Josip Broz Tito in 1980, Yugoslavia's political system began to unravel.Judah, pp. 38‚Äì9 In 1989, Belgrade abolished self-rule in Kosovo, as well as Serbia's other autonomous province, Vojvodina, as part of Serbian President Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá's \\"anti-bureaucratic revolution\\". Though inhabited predominantly by ethnic Albanians, Kosovo was of great historical and cultural significance to the Serbs. Prior to the mid-19th century, Serbs had formed a majority in the province, but by 1990 represented only about 10 percent of the population. Alarmed by their dwindling numbers, the province's Serbs began to fear they were being \\"squeezed out\\" by the Albanians. As soon as Kosovo's autonomy was abolished, a minority government run by Serbs and Montenegrins was appointed by Milo≈°eviƒá to oversee the province, enforced by thousands of heavily armed paramilitaries from Serbia-proper. Albanian culture was systematically repressed and hundreds of thousands of Albanians working in state-owned companies lost their jobs. In 1996, a ragtag group of Albanian nationalists calling themselves the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) began attacking the Yugoslav Army (; VJ) and the Serbian Ministry of Internal Affairs (; MUP) in Kosovo. Their goal was to separate the province from the rest of Yugoslavia, which following the secession of Slovenia, Croatia, Macedonia and Bosnia- Herzegovina in 1991‚Äì92, became a rump federation made up of Serbia and Montenegro. At first the KLA carried out hit-and-run attacks: 31 in 1996, 55 in 1997, and 66 in January and February 1998 alone. The group quickly gained popularity among young Kosovo Albanians, many of whom favoured a more aggressive approach and rejected the non-violent resistance of politician Ibrahim Rugova. The organization received a significant boost in 1997, when an armed uprising in neighbouring Albania led to thousands of weapons from the Albanian Army's depots being looted. Many of these weapons ended up in the hands of the KLA.Judah, pp. 127‚Äì130 The KLA also received substantial funds from its involvement in the drug trade. The group's popularity skyrocketed after the VJ and MUP attacked the compound of KLA leader Adem Jashari in March 1998, killing him, his closest associates and most of his extended family. The attack motivated thousands of young Kosovo Albanians to join the KLA, fueling the Kosovar uprising that eventually erupted in the spring of 1998.Judah, pp. 138‚Äì41 Junik is a town in western Kosovo, bordering on Deƒçani to the north and ƒêakovica to the south. Following World War II, it became a municipality in its own right, but in 1962, it was dissolved and its territory divided between its neighbours. By 1998, Junik was mainly inhabited by Kosovo Albanians. The area was also home to approximately 700 Serbs. Junik was of great strategic importance because it was situated along the Ko≈°are valley corridor. This resulted in the town becoming the KLA's main conduit for weapons smuggling and distribution in western Kosovo early in the war. The area's mountainous terrain was also ideal for evading attacks by the VJ and MUP, and as a result, the KLA established its western Kosovo headquarters in the town. Junik was among the first towns caught up in the fighting between Yugoslavia's security forces and the KLA, becoming a flashpoint of the KLA's so-called First Offensive in April 1998.Pettifer & Vickers 2007, p. 117 The attack on the Jashari compound prompted the West to re-impose sanctions against Yugoslavia, which had been lifted following the signing of the Dayton Agreement in early 1996. By mid-June, the KLA was claiming to be in control of 40 percent of Kosovo. Battle Clashes between the KLA and the Yugoslav authorities in and around Junik commenced on 29 May 1998. By the following month, virtually all of Junik's 7,000 inhabitants were displaced. An additional 5,000 Kosovo Albanians from the surrounding areas who had previously sought shelter in the town were also dislocated. Around this time, the Yugoslav Air Force carried out a number of airstrikes in Junik and its vicinity. The KLA was believed to be in control of approximately 40 percent of Kosovo by this point but was prone to losing newly seized land as quickly as it had acquired it. On 24 June, U.S. diplomat Richard Holbrooke visited Junik and met with KLA fighters there. He proposed declaring a ceasefire and having the warring sides work towards a negotiated settlement, but the KLA rejected the offer. On 27 July, the VJ ambushed a column of fighters attempting to leave Junik and cross the Albanian‚ÄìYugoslav border, killing seven or eight. The following day, the VJ surrounded the town. Its encirclement coincided with an almost simultaneous offensive that wrested from the KLA a nearby highway that had been held by the insurgents for two months. Before being placed back into operation, the highway had to be cleared of improvised explosive devices. The VJ and MUP gave the insurgents, as well as civilians trapped within the town, one hour to leave Junik via two corridors, but the deadline passed without any response. Around sunset, the security forces and the KLA began exchanging mortar fire. Some contemporary accounts suggest that Junik's encirclement resulted in 1,000 KLA fighters being trapped within the town. Other accounts place the figure around 1,500. Shortly after Junik's encirclement, Milo≈°eviƒá spoke with a delegation of European Union representatives and offered to end the siege in exchange for international sanctions being lifted, but the two side's failed to reach an agreement. For more than two weeks, the VJ/MUP and the KLA lobbed mortar shells at each other, and exchanged sporadic bursts of gunfire. On 16 August, after a siege lasting nearly 20 days, the VJ and MUP took control of Junik, forcing the insurgents to abandon their weapons and retreat to the surrounding hills and forests. The storming of the town was spearheaded by the Special Anti-Terrorist Unit, the special operations component of the MUP. The assault was accompanied by the extensive use of helicopters and tanks. Aftermath At the time of its capture, Junik was the last major KLA stronghold in Kosovo. MUP spokesman Bo≈æidar Filiƒá said that with its fall, \\"the territory of Kosovo has been freed for movement in all directions.\\" The loss of its last major stronghold did not result in the KLA's demise. Instead of completely destroying the organization, the VJ and MUP only forced the KLA to retreat to northern Albania, from where it was able to regroup and resume its insurgency. Nevertheless, the political analyst Corinna Metz notes that the loss of Junik resulted in the KLA losing its of aura of invincibility among the Kosovo Albanian population. According to contemporary reports, four MUP and two VJ personnel were killed in the battle. The Humanitarian Law Center, a Belgrade-based non-governmental organization, lists 13 guerrillas, eight Kosovo Albanian civilians, and two MUP personnel as being killed. Among the dead was the KLA commander in Junik, Bekim Berisha, as well as deputy KLA commanders Bedri Shala, Elton Zherka, and P√´rmet Vula. Filiƒá said that there had been no civilian casualties because nearly all of the town's inhabitants had left before the battle. BBC News correspondent Jeremy Cooke described Junik's capture as \\"a major blow to the KLA\\". Western reporters who visited the town once fighting had stopped reported that the entire civilian population had fled. They found that some buildings had sustained heavy damage but most of the town remained intact. Albanian Foreign Minister Paskal Milo condemned the town's encirclement and capture as an act of \\"genocide and mass repression\\". The Vice-Chancellor and Foreign Minister of Austria, Wolfgang Schuessel, also condemned the assault. Rugova stated that the town's fall would reduce the likelihood of peace negotiations taking place. Adem Dema√ßi, a prominent Kosovo Albanian activist, said that the offensive \\"proved there was no alternative to independence for Kosovo.\\" Partly in response to the town's capture, on 17 August 1998, troops from 14 different NATO member states took part in military exercises in Albania, intended as a warning signal to the Yugoslav government. On 20 August, U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin accused Yugoslavia's security forces of planting anti-personnel mines around Junik.Krieger 2001, p. 101 Five days later, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees issued a statement confirming that the town's surroundings had been mined. In response to the battle, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 1199 on 23 September, calling for an end to hostilities in Kosovo.

This involves added micro- economic measures at the local level to complement macro-economic measures at the national level. LED encompasses a range of disciplines including physical planning, economics and marketing, all with the goal of building up the economic capacity of a local area to improve its economic future and the quality of life for all.http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTURBANDEVELOPMENT/EXTLED/0,,contentMDK:20185186~menuPK:399161~pagePK:148956~piPK:216618~theSitePK:341139,00.html Approach According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), national and local governments, as well as enterprises and other organisations have to rethink development strategies to cope with ongoing events such as globalization. In contrast to traditional development policies, Local Economic Development strategies promote local dialogue and enable people to be more proactive; help to make local institutions better contribute to development; make economic activity dependent on the comparative advantages of a specific territory, generating development by firms more capable to withstand changes in the global economic environment rather than top-down development imposed by national planners. ILO Website on LED Economic development activities in developing countries tend to be unidisciplinary, initiated and implemented by just one ministry or agency. An advantage of LED approaches is that they facilitate a multidisciplinary approach. South Africa has been particularly active in promoting the concept.http://led.public-hub.com/ The South African LED Network =LED in South Africa: pro-poor vs. pro-growth= Many LED interventions in South Africa have taken a direct pro-poor intervention, leading to questions regarding whether this approach is more effective in terms of poverty relief than the spin-offs of more pro-growth focused endeavours. The Microeconomic Reform Strategy is a central component of the 2005 policy guidelines for implementing LED in South Africa.World Bank- Netherlands Partnership Program (BNPP), 2005. \\"Investigation of Pro-Poor Local Economic Development in South Africa.\\" This strategy seeks to address the inequalities in the country and to build on the RDP (Reconstruction and Development Program), by focusing on issues of the geographical spread of activity, integration, black economic empowerment, knowledge-led growth, skills development and state responsiveness. In addition to the laws and policies directly supporting and encouraging pro-poor LED, other instruments, such as Integrated Development Planning, provide additional support for implementation. Integrated Development Planning is a key process used within LED, which looks toward the use of planning to situate pro-poor development and LED specifically.World Bank-Netherlands Partnership Program (BNPP), 2005. \\"Investigation of Pro-Poor Local Economic Development in South Africa.\\" The South African Forum for Effective Planning and Development in 1995 defined Integrated Development Planning as, ‚ÄòA participatory approach to integrate economic, sectoral, spatial, social, institutional, environmental and fiscal strategies in order to support the optimal allocation of scarce resources between sectors and geographical areas and across the population in a manner that provides sustainable growth, equity and the empowerment of the poor and the marginalised‚Äô(DPLG, 15).Department of Provincial and Local Government Affairs (DPLG), 2000: Local Economic Development: Guideline to Institutional Arrangements, Local Economic Development Manual Series Volume 1, DPLG, Pretoria. Integrated Development Planning In terms of what an 'Integrated Development Plan' (IDP) should include, the Municipal Systems Act clearly brings out the pro-poor dimensions of government thinking. The Act states that an integrated development plan must reflect:RSA, 2000a: Local Government Municipal Systems Bill, Government Gazette No. 21071 of 13 April 2000. * The municipal council's vision for the long-term development of the municipality. Special emphasis is to be placed on the municipality's most critical development needs * An assessment of the existing level of development in the municipality. This should include the identification of any communities which do not have access to adequate basic services * The council's long-term development vision and should consider the need for social and economic advancement of disadvantaged sections of the community * The IDP must describe in detail how the municipal council will realise its development objectives and the time frame within which those objectives will be realised * The council's spatial development framework, which should guide the way in which the physical area will be developed It is suggested that IDP can assist in the promotion of socio-economic development in at least three ways; first, in helping to attract funds from other spheres of government, donor organisations and investors through defining and packaging attractive projects and programmes; secondly in helping to create an environment that is conducive to private sector investment and the general promotion of LED; and thirdly, by proposing direct interventions in the economy through, for example, providing incentives, developing economic infrastructure, and buying, developing and leasing/selling land,(DPLG 2000, 25).Department of Provincial and Local Government Affairs (DPLG), 2000: Local Economic Development: Guideline to Institutional Arrangements, Local Economic Development Manual Series Volume 1, DPLG, Pretoria. Public participation A participatory approach to LED involves the inclusion of different stakeholders so that their views, concerns and issues can be included in the planning process. This is important because it is here that networks, partnerships and information sharing occur that make better, more practical, strategies possible..ND Ngubane, 2005: \\"Promoting Local Economic Development through Strategic Planning\\". Volume 1. Variables to be considered when conducting this inventory should reflect the components of a functioning economy, such as human and social capital, financial capital, physical capital and natural capital (UN Habitat,10).UN Habitat, Eco-Plan, 2005: \\"Promoting Local Economic Development through Strategic Planning\\". Volume 1. In South Africa, municipalities are specifically required to involve communities in the affairs of the municipality, to provide services in a financially sustainable manner and to promote development.RSA, 2000: Local Government Municipal Systems Bill, Government Gazette No. 21071 of 13 April 2000. For instance, public participation is a key element of the Systems Act, and municipalities are obliged to establish mechanisms for public participation and participatory governance. Conclusions There is entrenched policy support for pro-poor development in South Africa ‚Äì often being the primary focus of municipal vision/mission statements. In many cases it is treated as the partner of pro-growth/economic growth interventions. This situation is to be welcomed and reflects both local imperatives and responsiveness and local adherence to nationally identified objectives. Given the dual challenges faced by South African society of needing to address both chronic poverty, yet also to achieve economic growth and global competitiveness, from a policy perspective it would seem that the approach adopted by Mangaung, Cape Town and eThekwini is most appropriate. These municipalities took a middle of the road approach, focusing their LED strategy on addressing both issues of poverty and growth and the fundamental linkages between the two (World Bank, 2005, 75).World Bank-Netherlands Partnership Program (BNPP), 2005. \\"Investigation of Pro-Poor Local Economic Development in South Africa.\\" The following case studies present pro-growth endeavours that have led to tangible pro-poor driven growth:Johannesburg's Fashion District; eThekwini's regeneration projects; Ingwe's rail-based tourism initiatives.World Bank-Netherlands Partnership Program (BNPP), 2005. \\"Investigation of Pro-Poor Local Economic Development in South Africa.\\" These case studies show that pro-poor, community-based initiatives that are market linked, providing a viable product and operating in an economically effective fashion, can help disadvantaged community members to effectively participate in the market economy. Similarly, community-based service provision and labour-intensive employment is an effective mechanisms to extend services and create employment and business opportunities for the poor (World Bank, 2005, 78).World Bank-Netherlands Partnership Program (BNPP), 2005. \\"Investigation of Pro-Poor Local Economic Development in South Africa.\\" Land-use planning for LED Land-use planning and development control serve as measurable tools for LED. The assignment of property rights in land and third party enforcement are essential for the efficient operation of markets. Public intervention ensures the separation of incompatible land-uses, integrated planning and development of synergistic land uses, and the 'public goods' aspect of necessary public facilities, open space and infrastructure investment (Lai, 1994, 78-80).LAI WAI CHUNG, L. (1994), 'The eco- nomics of zoning: a literature review and analysis of the work of Coase', Town Planning Review, 65, 77-98. Land use planning and development control are essential for the existence and operation of land and property markets (Alexander, 48).A Transaction-Cost Theory of Land Use Planning and Development Control: Towards the Institutional Analysis of Public Planning E. R. Alexander The Town Planning Review , Vol. 72, No. 1 (Jan., 2001), pp. 45-75 For instance, the assignment of and control over land uses will generally reduce transaction costs and can create or enlarge markets (Lai, 1994, 91).LAI WAI CHUNG, L. (1994), 'The eco- nomics of zoning: a literature review and analysis of the work of Coase', Town Planning Review, 65, 77-98. The following are a list of public land use and development controls that the Ontario Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing lists as useful methods in promoting economic development.Ontario Municipal Affairs and Housing. \\"Municipal and Financial Tools for Economic Development Handbook\\". ;Zoning by-laws Zoning by-laws are used to specify matters such as density, uses of land, parking requirements and form-related standards ‚Äì including building heights, lot coverage, setbacks, minimum lot sizes, and other building envelope specifications. To keep pace with market conditions and to create higher-quality built environments, flexible and context-relevant standards can be implemented to support economic development goals. ;Height and density exchange Municipalities can require that facilities, services and matters, as set out in an official plan and by-law, be provided in return for an increase in building height and/or density. This exchange might include streetscape and design elements ‚Äì for example, protected bicycle parking, outdoor seating, non-slip pedestrian surfaces or public art ‚Äì in support of municipal placemaking and economic development objectives. ;Minimum and maximum standards More efficient built forms can be achieved through by-law standards for minimum and maximum building height and density. Community resources such as nearby services, public transit, utilities, and existing road and sidewalk networks and greenspaces, can be used more effectively while expanding the number of potential customers for area businesses.

The consequence is that said couple were never married in the eyes of the church and can get married again by a priest, which they normally would not be able to do if they had divorced.

In November 2016 Blume released the documentation Kollegah an Pal√§stina (Eine StreetCinema Dokumentation) on his YouTube Channel ALPHA MUSIC EMPIRE.. He traveled through the Palestinian territories, visited the West Bank barrier, the refugee camp Am'ari and supported a school. The documentation started a controversy in the German rap- scene.

They received the coveted German ECHO award for this album, and in reaction to this, several artists gave their ECHOs back. Other ventures =Fitness and fashion= In February 2014 Blume launched his own Fitness-Program named Bosstransformation. Two years later he launched the Bosstransformation 2, an updated version. In November 2015, Blume launched his own clothing line Deus Maximus. A year before his first Brand \\"Copayn\\" flopped.

Personal life Blume was studying law at the Johannes Gutenberg University in Mainz for some years. =Religious beliefs= At the age of 15, Blume came in contact with Islam through his Algerian stepfather. He converted to the religion in the same year. =Legal issues= During a concert of his \\"Imperator\\"-Tour in Leipzig there was a violent incident onstage. As is often the case with rap concerts, a rap battle between two spectators should be performed on the stage. One of the participants tried to grab Blume's sunglasses. As a result, Blume shoved the man, kicked him and punched him in the face. A few hours later videos of the attack were uploaded to YouTube and Facebook. An uninvolved person reported Blume to the police.

On 20 October 1908, a meeting was held at the Peer's ClubThe Peer's Club purchased the old Rokumeikan building in 1890, and renamed it The building was demolished in 1941, and its imposing, copper clad gates were destroyed by bombing in 1945. in Tokyo to discuss the formation in Tokyo of a society to equal the Japan Society of London. Viscount Hayashi was elected as chairman, and the British AmbassadorThe Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary from the Court of St. James's to Japan holds the presidency of the society for the duration of their appointment. was elected as its first president. The Ambassador proposed that the society be named \\"The Japanese and British Society\\", however those present chose the shorter \\"The British Society\\" instead. On 27 November 1908, \\"The British Society\\" held its inaugural meeting at the Imperial HotelThe original, wooden Imperial Hotel was built next to the Rokumeikan/Kazoku Kaikan in 1890, but was demolished and replaced by a stone and concrete structure designed by Frank Lloyd Wright in 1923, which in turn was demolished to make way for the current structure in 1968. in Tokyo, and at some point after 1910, changed its name to \\"The Japan- British Society\\". 1908 to the present day On 13 March 1935, Mr. Charles Sale of the Japan Society used the inauguration of a telephone service between Japan and the United Kingdom to send the Japan Society's greetings to the officers and council of the Japan‚ÄìBritish Society in Tokyo, and to their patron Prince Chichibu. During the Second World War, the society's activities were halted, and air raids destroyed much of their records. The society resumed its activities upon the conclusion of the Treaty of San Francisco in 1951. Large-scale festivals of Japanese culture were held in the U.K. in 1981 and 1991. In 1998, a reciprocal event, the UK98 festival, was held with the cooperation of the association to introduce British culture to Japan. The Society supported the Japan 2001 festival, which featured a series of events to introduce traditional and contemporary Japanese culture throughout Britain. The event's joint patrons were the Prince of Wales and the Crown Prince of Japan. In addition, the society began compiling a history of the organization in preparation for its centenary in 2008. In November, 2000, the society was reformed and established as a . Membership This body has over 2000 members and is supported by more than 120 corporate members. Membership of the Society is open to anyone with an interest in the cause of Japan-United Kingdom relations, and on the recommendation of a member of the Society or upon attending a membership interview. Imperial patronage Prince Fushimi Sadanaru became the first Royal Patron of the Society in 1910, after taking an active role in Anglo-Japanese relations. He travelled to the UK in May, 1907, to give Emperor Meiji's thanks to King Edward VII for bestowing The Most Noble Order of the Garter upon him. He was sent to England again after Russo- Japanese War in 1909, on a mission of thanks from the Japanese government for British advice and assistance during the war, and the Prince also represented Japan at the state funeral of King Edward VII on May 20, 1910, and met with the new King George V at Buckingham Palace. Later, Prince and Princess Chichibu were Honorary Patrons. Prince Chichibu was the second son of Emperor Taish≈ç and noted for his efforts to promote international relations. His promotion of rugby in Japan is remembered at the Chichibunomiya Rugby Stadium (Prince Chichibu Memorial Rugby Ground) in Aoyama. After his death, Princess Chichibu, eldest daughter of Ambassador Tsuneo Matsudaira, accepted the honorary patronage. She was active in Anglo-Japanese relations, visiting the UK in 1962 (in reciprocation for the first post-war visit by a member of the UK Royal family, Princess Alexandra of Kent, the previous year), and again in 1967, for the 75th anniversary of the Japan Society. Every year, the society holds the Princess Chichibu Memorial Lecture. Prince Tomohito of Mikasa was the Honorary Patron of the Japan‚ÄìBritish Society. He is the eldest son of Prince Mikasa, and an alumnus of Oxford University's Magdalen College. Events The Society provides a forum within which members of both nationalities meet for social and cultural exchanges on an informal and friendly basis. The Society's regular events are an Annual Dinner, a Gala Party, the Princess Chichibu Memorial Lecture and the Annual Golf Tournament for the Princess Chichibu Trophy. The society also holds many other events such as wine or sake tasting, trips to sporting events and theatrical performances, cultural lessons (such as English cookery), Business Forum meetings, and lectures. The society's Junior Group arranges social events to appeal to younger members, including the annual Christmas party, the Mochitsuki (rice pounding), Shinnenkai (New Year's party), pub nights, film viewings, barbecues, and cherry blossom viewing at the British Embassy. Activities The society has supported a number of exchange programs and offers opportunities for British and Japanese members to become acquainted with each other, including seasonal events and lectures. In the educational sphere, the society has supported English language study programs in Britain. Regional The Japan British Society The Japan‚ÄìBritish Society was founded in Tokyo in 1908 and gradually spread to many regional areas. As of August, 2009, there are 19 independent, regional Japan-British Societies outside Tokyo: Aichi, Aomori, Asahikawa, Ehime, Fukui,British-Japan Society of Fukui Fukuoka, Hakodate, Hiroshima, Hokkaido, Ishikawa, Iwate, Kagoshima, Kansai, Kumamoto, Miyazaki, Nagasaki, Shizuoka, Tohoku, Yamaguchi.

The series is a black comedy crime thriller, based on the novels of the crime writer Carlo Lucarelli. The series' visual style and plot contain many quotes from the popular crime and action movies of the 70s and 80s, where to three episodes night. Coliandro watch to Marted√¨, Mercoled√¨ e Venerd√¨ to Rai Premium. Plot Coliandro is a young detective that works in Bologna. His peculiar ability of being, at the same time, brave, reckless and particularly non observant put him in many dangerous situations. In most of the episodes Coliandro tries to investigate cases that his more skilled colleagues cannot solve and somehow he unintentionally gets involved in. This results in him being punished, taken off field work and assigned to ‚Äúboring‚Äù desk jobs such as issuing passports. During his unauthorized investigations he is often helped by two of his colleagues, Trombetti and Gargiulo, whereas his superiors dismiss his efforts and consider him a joke and a nuisance. Coliandro is ignorant, crude, and despised by all his colleagues except his partner Gargiulo, who is the only one seeing him the way he sees himself: a real-life version of Inspector Callahan. He often quotes from these and other American action and crime movies and tries to imitate the behavior of his idols. In every case Coliandro is helped by a girl (a victim or a witness) and he always hopelessly falls in love with her but he is, inexorably, dumped at the end of every case. Coliandro seems to be able to close every case with a combination of stubbornness and luck but at the end is always punished due to his ‚Äúunprofessional behavior‚Äù. The humor of the series is manifest in the difference between the way Coliandro sees himself and the way the rest of the world sees him. Coliandro's very name is a play on the Italian word coglione - a word literally meaning \\"ball\\", but most usually used with the meaning of \\"asshole.\\" (Others who meet him for the first time also often mispronounce his name in various ways making it \\"coriander\\" (the spice) or even \\"confetti.\\" At any rate, he must continually correct its pronunciation.) One notable characteristic of the \\"Coliandro\\" series is that all its episodes are shot in the city of Bologna, a wealthy town which is not really famous for crime, or its immediate surroundings.  Production  The series has hitherto consisted of seven seasons: season 1 to 3 have four episodes each, the fourth has 2, fifth and sixth 6 and the 7th 4. The first season was aired in 2006, the second and third in 2009, the forth in 2010, seasons 5 -7 in 2016-2018. Giampaolo Morelli (Coliandro), Alessandro Rossi (commissioner De Zan), Veronica Logan (prosecutor Longhi), and Giuseppe Soleri (agent Gargiulo, Coliandro's partner) reprised their roles in the second season; the rest of the cast was rotated.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003 as a part of the PWA-Era County Courthouses of IA Multiple Properties Submission. The current structure is the third courthouse to house court functions and county administration. History A small wooden structure that was built in 1847 was the first building used for court functions. The first term of court was held in a log cabin belonging to Rufus B. Clark and the second term was held in the storeroom of a schoolhouse. A courthouse was finally built in Independence in 1857 for about $10,000. Voters elected to build a new courthouse in 1880 for $7,500. Des Moines architects Dougher, Rich & Woodburn were retained to design a new courthouse. The county applied for and received a grant from the Public Works Administration (PWA) in 1938. This is one of ten courthouses in Iowa that received PWA funds. County voters approved a bond referendum for additional funding on June 6, 1938. Five houses were removed from an expanded courthouse square and groundbreaking for the new courthouse took place November 15, 1938. The cornerstone was laid on September 20, 1939, and C.C. Larsen Company of Council Bluffs, Iowa was responsible for the building's construction. The county board of supervisors received the completed building on March 22, 1940. The courthouse was dedicated on May 22 of the same year. Nearly 4,000 people attended the parade and heard the address by retired Rear Admiral Harry Yarnell, formerly of Buchanan County, who was the main speaker. The old courthouse was taken down after the new courthouse was dedicated, and landscaping was completed by autumn. A wing was added to the north end of the courthouse in 1976 to house the county's correctional facility. Subsequently, another addition was built on the south side of the historic building. Architecture The architectural style of the historic portion of the building is known as Depression Modern or PWA Moderne. The building features a symmetrical fa√ßade with a central section that is flanked by two lower sections. The exterior is clad in buff-colored brick with Bedford limestone trim. It rises three stories above a raised basement. A central corridor on each floor extends the length of the building, with the offices opening onto the corridors. The building features multi-colored terrazzo floors, marble wainscoting, and acoustic tiles. The five tall windows that extend from the second to the third floors of the main elevation mark the location of the courtroom, which was decorated in dark wood tones and Art Deco ornamentation. The building is located on the courthouse square on the north side of the central business district where the previous courthouse was also located. Two elements on the courthouse square, which itself is a contributing site, are contributing objects on the building's nomination to the National Register of Historic Places. with The first element is the building's original flagpole. The second is a replica of the Statue of Liberty (1950), which commemorates the 40th anniversary of the Boy Scouts of America.

She was twice married, and widowed; first to James Whitney, then to Sir William Herbert of Troy Parva, an illegitimate son of William Herbert, 1st Earl of Pembroke and one of his mistresses. She had five children. Blanche Milborne died 1557 before Queen Elizabeth I‚Äôs accession. Early life Blanche Milborne was one of the eleven co-heiresses (a son and daughter died young) of Simon Milborne and Jane (Baskerville) of Burghill, Herefordshire. Her eldest sister, Alice married Henry Myles and they were the parents of Blanche Parry. The family had widespread gentry connections; Sir William Herbert, 1st Earl of Pembroke (1st creation) married Ann Devereux, the niece of Simon Milborne‚Äôs mother, Elizabeth Devereux. Blanche was also connected to Queen Catherine Parr sharing Agnes Crophull as an ancestress making them second cousins. First marriage Blanche Milborne married James Whitney of Whitney and Pen-cwm; her dowry was the manor of Icomb in Gloucestershire which had belonged to her father and was inherited by their eldest son, Robert. James Whitney died on 30 July 1500, leaving Blanche with Robert aged thirteen years,Inquistion Post Mortem of James Whitney transcribed and translated by Michael A. Faraday and James, Watkin and Elizabeth who were younger. Elizabeth's daughter, Ann Morgan of Arkstone, Herefordshire, married Henry Carey, later Lord Hunsdon by licence on 21 May 1545, and the son of Mary Boleyn. Second marriage Between July 1500 and August 1502 Blanche remarried, becoming the second wife of Sir William Herbert of Troy Parva, an illegitimate son of Sir William Herbert, 1st Earl of Pembroke and one of his mistresses, Frond verch Hoesgyn. It was a Welsh household; although Blanche was English she would have also been Welsh- speaking. Lewys Morgannwg states that she and her husband welcomed King Henry VII, his Earls and possibly his Queen to Troy House, Mitchel Troy near Monmouth in August 1502. Blanche and Sir William had two sons Charles and Thomas, both of whom were eventually knighted and served as sheriffs of Monmouthshire. (Sir William also had an illegitimate son, Richard.) Thomas married Anne Lucy of Charlecote. In 1505, Sir William Herbert of Troy gave an undertaking to keep the peace with his half-brother, Sir Walter Herbert of Raglan, and with Henry Myles, his brother-in-law. He is recorded as being an annuitant of Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham at Thornbury Castle in 1508, Sheriff of Herefordshire in 1515 and was knighted between Easter and Michaelmas 1516. He died in 1524; Blanche and their son Charles were executors of his Will, in which Blanche was well provided for.Will of Sir William Herbert of Troy, National Archives, Kew A clause of the Will trusted that Henry Somerset (then Lord Herbert but succeeded as 2nd Earl of Worcester in 1526/7) would be \\"a good lord to my wife and children.\\" Sir William also requested that \\"Blanche will keep herself sole.\\" Royal court By the 1530s, Lady Herbert of Troy was in the Royal Household as shown by a later report, author not named (on the subversive activities of the Earl of Essex and Roger Vaughan in 1601) which has the preamble \\"My mother was chosen and brought to the Court by my Lady Herbert of Troy, to have been her Majesty's (Queen Elizabeth I's) nurse and had been chosen before all other had her gracious mother (Queen Anne Boleyn) had her own will therein‚Ä¶\\" Lady Herbert of Troy is mentioned at the christening of Prince Edward in 1537; when the procession reformed at the conclusion of the ceremony it was noted that, \\"Lady Elizabeth went with her sister Lady Mary and Lady Herbert of Troy to bear the train.\\"Letters & Papers King Henry VIII 1537 no 911 Lady mistress ca. 1537 to ca. 1546 Margaret Bryan was in charge of Princess Elizabeth when she was a baby but she transferred to Prince Edward when he was born. The evidence shows that Lady Bryan was succeeded by Lady Herbert of Troy; Prince Edward was also placed in her charge when he grew older for Lewys Morgannwg states that she was \\"in charge of his (Prince Edward‚Äôs) fosterage.\\" Lady Herbert of Troy‚Äôs position is confirmed by lists of personnel for Lady Elizabeth in the Letters and Papers of Henry VIII. Internal evidence suggests a range of dates for these lists from before 1536 to 1546. Lady Herbert of Troy‚Äôs name heads the earlier lists, followed by Kate Champernon who was appointed in 1536 as a governess. In 1545 Roger Ascham (whose page was John Whitney, possibly a relation of Blanche Milborne) wrote to Champernon asking that she commend him to \\"my good Lady Troy and all that company of gentlewomen.\\" However, the c.1546 household list for Lady Elizabeth does not mention Lady Herbert of Troy indicating that she retired from her position in late 1545 or early 1546; Elizabeth was then twelve years old. In 1549, Sir Robert Tyrwhitt wrote that \\"Ashley‚Ä¶was made her mistress (Lady Elizabeth‚Äôs) by the king her father‚Ä¶ But four of her gentlewomen confess that Ashley first removed Lady Troy‚Ä¶and then her successor (Blanche) Parry‚Ä¶\\". Lady Herbert of Troy had evidently intended her niece Blanche to succeed her but the post of Lady Mistress was given to Champernon (Blanche Parry remained as second in the household, succeeding Champernon when the latter died in 1565.)

Plot Fantastic Four member Mister Fantastic visits Attilan, city of the Inhumans, seeking the six Infinity Gems (each an artifact of great power). Lockjaw, an oversized dog and pet of the Inhuman Royal Family, finds the Mind Gem, which increases the animal's intelligence. Using telepathy to read Mr. Fantastic's mind, Lockjaw decides to find the remaining Gems. The pet encounters and recruits a number of other animal companions to heroes, including the cat Hairball, the diminutive dragon Lockheed, the falcon Redwing, the frog Throg, and the puppy Ms. Lion (actually a character from the animated series Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends). Courtesy of Lockjaw's ability to teleport, the group visit the prehistoric Savage Land and acquire the Time Gem and the aid of the sabretooth tiger Zabu. The Space Gem is found in the past, and after an underwater encounter and being swallowed by the whale-like Giganto, the group collect the Soul Gem and the Reality Gem. The animal team converge on the final Gem, the Power Gem, which is in the possession of the President of the United States' dog, Bo. The Titan Thanos, a previous owner of all six Gems when united as the Infinity Gauntlet, intervenes and kills Ms. Lion. The other animals are angered by this act and use the Gems to strand Thanos in an alternate dimension and subsequently revive their comrade. Retrieving the final Gem, the group decides to separate, but not before Throg advises that they now share a psychic link and will reunite if needed. Ms. Lion (resurrected by Hairball via the Soul Gem) dubs the group the Pet Avengers. The series concludes with Lockjaw presenting the Gems to a surprised Mr. Fantastic.

He was part of the Zois circle, a group of Carniolan scholars and intellectuals that were instrumental in the spread of Enlightenment ideas in the Slovene Lands. His translations of the Bible, based on the 16th-century translation of the Lutheran author Jurij Dalmatin, set the basis for the development of modern standard Slovene.  Life and work  Born in the Upper Carniolan town of Kamnik, then part of the Habsburg Monarchy (now in Slovenia), he studied in Jesuit schools in Ljubljana, Gorizia, and Graz. He was ordained a Roman Catholic priest in 1769 in Trieste, where he served until the Suppression of the Jesuits in 1773. He then became the personal secretary of Bishop of Ljubljana Karl Herberstein. Under Herberstein's influence, Japelj became sympathetic to Jansenist ideas. With the support of Bishop Herberstein, Japelj started translating religious texts into Slovene. He rejected the innovations of the Franciscan friar Marko Pohlin, and returned to the language of 16th-century Slovene Protestants, especially Jurij Dalmatin and Adam Bohoriƒç. Together with Bla≈æ Kumerdej, he began a new translation of the Bible in Slovene, based on Jurij Dalmatin's translation from the 1580s. In 1807, he started compiling a grammar of Slovene, which, however, remained unfinished. He also translated several poems by Metastasio, Kleist, Racine, Hagedorn, and Pope into Slovene. He also wrote some original poems in a mixture of Classicism, Roccoco, and Sentimentalism. In 1799, Japelj became the director of the seminary in Klagenfurt, where he also covered other positions in the ecclesiastical and civil administration. He died in Klagenfurt in 1807, shortly after being appointed bishop of Trieste.  Sources  *Janko Kos, Slovenska knji≈æevnost (Ljubljana: Cankarjeva zalo≈æva, 1982), 122-123.

It includes: *Preventing poaching *Preventing losses due to attack by predators. *Encouraging breeding, and sometimes captive breeding for release. Britain Until hand-held guns were invented, sport hunting was largely for the deer or wild boar (by hounds or bow-and-arrow, but √Ülfric of Eynsham's Colloquium written in Anglo-Saxon times speaks of the usual way to catch deer being to drive them into a net), or hare (by a fast dog); the Colloquium mentions two stags and a wild boar as a typical day's catch. What are now called game birds were caught by falconry, or had to be netted or snared or trapped or limed by a fowler employed by the owner of the hunting right. When the fowler used falconry, he seems to have needed to catch and train his hawks; the Colloquium mentions: *The fowler offering to sell a hawk in exchange for a swift dog. *That there are two sorts of hawks, the larger and the smaller, likeliest the goshawk and the sparrowhawk. Most game preservation and poaching centered on deer. The arrival of firearms changed bird-hunting. At first birds had to be stalked sitting, but changes in shotgun design in the 18th century made it possible to shoot them flying. The Long Affray, by Harry Hopkins, publ. 1985 Secker & Warburg, London, During the 18th and 19th centuries game preservation laws became ever more severe in favour of the rural gentry and their sport shooting rights. Game in Britain was mostly deer, hares, rabbits, pheasants, partridges, and grouse. Game caused much damage to crops, and a persistent complaint among the rural population was not being allowed to kill rabbits and hares to defend crops and garden vegetables. In Scotland farmers dreaded grouse invading ripening cornfields to eat the seeds, and deer in a few nights eating the whole of a crop of turnips intended as winter feed for cattle. Steady growth of industrial towns in the later 19th century gradually built up a stock of population who when called to court (as magistrates or as jury members) could not be relied on to automatically support the rural gentry's side of court cases. In 1880 pressure from farmers over damage to crops caused by game and hunting led Gladstone's government to pass the Ground Game Act. The book The Long Affray describes 38 violent fights in the 19th century and 3 in the 18th century, some with shooting and/or death, of gamekeepers plus their helpers versus poachers. Between 1833 and 1843 42 British gamekeepers lost their lives in such incidents. Between autumn 1860 and the end of 1861, over 40 gamekeepers were injured in Staffordshire, some grievously, in fights involving nearly 100 poachers. Mantraps and spring guns were often deployed against poachers, but often caught wrong people: for example, a parson \\"botanizing\\", and a naval admiral's 3 sons who entered a game covert for an innocent reason; if a hunted fox went into a game covert the foxhunt sometimes lost hounds to devices meant to catch poachers' lurchers, and horses by stepping in mantraps. In the 19th century, democratisation of local government in rural areas gradually reduced the power of the country squires. As the Industrial Revolution advanced, large gangs of coalminers and factory workmen sometimes made poaching forays in numbers that forced the gamekeepers' men to back off and watch, such as: *A gang of 60 or 70 poachers invaded Temple Newsam's game preserve near Leeds, shooting game up to the wall of the mansion. *A gang of 50 to 60 coalminers and ribbon-weavers invaded D.S.Dugdale's game preserve near Coventry and Nuneaton and advanced through a game covert in line abreast: 28 had guns, 12 had sticks, and the rest each knocked 2 stones together; 2 accompanied on horseback to direct the advance of the line. Through this time, selling game was illegal, but there was a widespread undercover system to transport legally shot and poached game (e.g. in the luggage compartments of stagecoaches) to traders in towns, much of it to Leadenhall Street in London. One thing that encouraged poaching was customers (including the caterers for the London Lord Mayor's Banquet) preferring game without shot damage and with no shot pellets embedded in its flesh: this favored game which had been netted or snared rather than shot. =Wildlife and game preservation= In Britain wild predators and scavengers were very badly affected by being shot by gamekeepers as \\"vermin\\" during the heyday of game preservation in the 18th and 19th centuries: for example, the gamekeepers' records of the Glengarry Estate in Scotland record killing in 3 years in the 19th century: *Mammals: 11 foxes, 198 wildcats, 246 martens, 106 polecats, 67 badgers, 301 stoats and weasels, 46 otters, 78 house cats *Birds of prey: 27 white-tailed sea eagles, 15 golden eagles, 3 honey buzzards, 18 ospreys, 63 goshawks, 285 common buzzards, 371 rough-legged buzzards, 83 hen harriers, 5 marsh harriers, 98 \\"blue hawks\\" (?= peregrine falcons), 7 orange- legged falcons, 275 kites, 11 hobby hawks, 78 merlin hawks, 6 gyr falcons, 462 kestrels, 35 \\"horned owls\\", 71 \\"fern owls\\" (?= short-eared owls) *Other birds: 1431 hooded crows, 475 ravens, 8 magpies =Relevant laws= *1389: King Richard II passed a law bringing in the Qualification law, which only allows men who own more than a certain value of land to hunt game. *1603: Trading in partridges and pheasants and deer was made illegal, but continued illegally through all the times following. *1723: Black Act (9 Geo. 1 c. 22), made it a hanging offence to appear armed in a deer park or warren, or to hunt or steal deer, with the face blackened or disguised. Repealed in 1827. *1803: Ellenborough's Act made it a capital offence to forcibly resist arrest. (Gamekeepers had power of arrest.) *1827: Lord Suffield's Bill made mantraps and spring guns illegal. *1828: The Night Poaching Act 1828, forbids poaching by night, still in force; introduces penal transportation as a penalty for poaching. *1831: The Game Act 1831, established close seasons, and removed the Qualification restriction. Game became the property of whoever owned the land that it was on at the time. Buying and selling game legalised. Still in force. *1862: The Poaching Prevention Act 1862 allowed police to stop and search anyone on the road for evidence of poaching. (In theory, this was allowed only if the suspect was coming from a game preserve area.) *1868: Penal transportation ceases as Western Australia (the last British colony to do so) refuses to accept any more penal transportees. *1880: The Ground Game Act 1880, gave land occupiers including tenants the unalienable right to take hares and rabbits on their land. Still in force. France Game preservation in France was enforced as severely and rigidly, until the French Revolution quickly violently ended the power of the rural gentry, and one of the revolutionary government's first actions was to sweep away the game preservation laws root and branch.

Following victory at Bannockburn in 1314, Robert the Bruce, King of Scotland, launched a series of raids into Northern England. Many areas along the Anglo-Scottish border were claimed by both Scotland and England, including Carlisle, which controlled access to North-West England. Carlisle Castle was a strong position, defended by a garrison commanded by Andrew Harclay, 1st Earl of Carlisle, an experienced veteran soldier. Despite their battlefield victories, the Scots lacked the expertise or resources necessary to sustain a lengthy siege; after failing to breach the walls, they withdrew on 1 August. Victory played an important part in Harclay's rise to prominence; he was later created Earl of Carlisle, before being executed in 1323.  Background  = Carlisle = The town of Carlisle and its castle was the western headquarters of the Scottish Marches, a buffer zone created along the Anglo-Scottish border. It controlled access to North West England, as Berwick did the North East, making it strategically important in the confrontations between Scotland and England. Previously held by the Scots, Berwick was captured by Edward I in 1296, and frequently changed hands until 1482, while Carlisle was besieged seven times between 1171 to 1461, the 1315 siege being among the most determined. Carlisle was first fortified in 72 CE, when a timber and earth Roman fort was built there; in 1092, William II of England constructed a stone castle on the same site, subsequently expanded by his successors. = Scottish Wars of Independence = The death of Alexander III in 1286, followed by his granddaughter Margaret, Maid of Norway in 1290, left thirteen claimants to the throne of Scotland. They agreed to allow Edward I of England to arbitrate, and in return accepted his claim of superior lordship over Scotland. However, his selection of John Balliol as king of Scotland was resisted by his rivals; when Edward attempted to exert his authority, Balliol was deposed and the Scots allied with France with France against England. Edward responded by invading Scotland in 1296, initially defeating the Scottish opposition, and starting the First War of Scottish Independence. Despite successes under William Wallace, the Scottish would find themselves still fighting the English in 1314 when Robert the Bruce, now King of Scotland, defeated Edward II of England at Bannockburn, uniting the nation under his leadership. Raids into Northern England, which had started in 1311 continued after Bannockburn. The exception at Carlisle may show that the Scottish were growing overconfident, or may have been part of a concerted plan to take the strategic border castles of Carlisle and Berwick. Aside from capturing castles, these expeditions into England were also intended to force Edward II to recognise Scottish independence.  The siege  = The English = Springalds were used to throw large bolts at the besiegers. Expecting Carlisle to be attacked following their defeat at Bannockburn, the English had strengthened the garrison there, and six months prior to the siege Andrew Harclay, as governor of the castle, commanded a few hundred regular soldiers. These would have been reinforced by men from the surrounding area seeking shelter within the walls. It is probable that Harclay and his men would have fought at Bannockburn the year before, and would have gained experience from border skirmishes with Scotland. The defenders were equipped with catapults and springalds capable of throwing large bolts and rocks down on to the besiegers. = The Scottish = Led by their king, Robert the Bruce, the Scottish army had proven themselves in battle at Bannockburn the year before, but were inexperienced in the art of siegecraft. Bruce's preferred tactics when taking a castle usually involved small, covert attacks at night to take the garrison by surprise. An exception was the siege of Edinburgh, when a large diversionary force provided cover for a smaller company to make it over the wall. Over the course of the siege of Carlisle the Scottish employed siege equipment typical of the era. = Conduct of the siege = Medieval siege tower Bruce arrived outside Carlisle on 22 July, and started by destroying the suburbs and spoiling the local crops. The Scots first attacked the gates, but they were thrown back after sustaining heavy losses; they then constructed a catapult, which proved unable to do much damage. They then built a siege tower and filled the castle moat with hay and other materials, in order to attack the walls directly. Both approaches were defeated by the weather, with the tower getting stuck, and the material filling the ditch being washed away. Attempts to gain entrance to the castle using long ladders, bridges over the moat, and the use of a sow, a mobile shelter used to provide protection to sappers trying to undermine the walls, would all come to no avail. In a last effort to take the castle, Bruce adopted the tactics used to capture Edinburgh, launching diversionary attacks while James Douglas attacked the walls from a previously unassaulted side. This too failed, and the siege ended on 1 August when the Scots withdrew, either in response to the rumoured approach of a relief column, or news of a defeat suffered by Edward Bruce in Ireland.  Aftermath  = Continued Scottish Raids = Despite their defeat in 1315, the Scots continued their attacks and besieged Carlisle again in 1316; these raids proved extremely lucrative, the people of northern England paying to avoid being attacked. They continued until 1322 when Edward II agreed a truce, although they were briefly restarted in 1327. The war ended in 1328 when Edward III of England signed the Treaty of Edinburgh‚ÄìNorthampton accepting Scottish independence. = Andrew Harclay = Royal charter awarded to Carlisle; Andrew Harclay throwing spears at the soldiers below Following the siege, Andrew Harclay received 1000 marks from King Edward for his service. His position as Sheriff of Cumberland was confirmed, while the town received a Royal charter; however, he was captured by Bruce late in 1315 and had to pay 2000 marks ransom. In 1319, Edward II appointed him Warden of the Western March, and in 1322 Earl of Carlisle. During the 1321 to 1322 Despenser War, Harclay led Royalist forces in the north; at the decisive Battle of Boroughbridge in March 1322, he deployed his infantry in the Scottish schiltron formation. The rebel forces were commanded by two of the most powerful noblemen in England, Thomas of Lancaster and the Earl of Hereford. Hereford was killed, Lancaster and another forty beheaded, while the Welsh leader Roger Mortimer was banished and deprived of his lands. This gained Harclay many enemies, and he was executed for treason in 1323, allegedly for attempting to make peace with Bruce.

His father was Artabazus II, and his mother a Greek from Rhodes. Youth in Macedonia Pharnabazus was the son of Artabazus, satrap of Hellespontine Phrygia. However, Artabazus was exiled after a failed rebellion against Artaxerxes III in 358 BC. From 352 to 342, the family went into exile to Macedonia, in the capital of Pella in Pella, under the rule of king Philip II (360-336), where they met the young Prince Alexander, future Alexander the Great. With Artabazus and Pharnabazus was Memnon of Rhodes, a Greek mercenary and relative by marriage. Artabazus, Pharnabazus and Memnon were later allowed to return to Persia, in 343 BC. Memnon obtained the command of the Persian navy in the Aegean sea in 334 BC, with Pharnabazus joining him. War against Alexander Location of Hellespontine Phrygia, and the provincial capital of Dascylium, in the Achaemenid Empire. When Alexander invaded the Persian empire, Memnon defended the strategically important town of Halicarnassus, which Alexander was then diverted to capture, forcing him to seek reinforcements. This allowed the Persians time to regroup, until Halicarnassus fell in the first months of 333 BC. Memnon and Pharnabazus then directed their strategy to disrupt Alexander's supply lines by taking Aegean islands near the Hellespont and by fomenting rebellion in southern Greece.Pierre Briant, From Cyrus to Alexander: A History of the Persian Empire, Translated by Peter T. Daniels, Eisenbrauns, 2006, pp.826-832. Memnon and Pharnabazus had a navy of about 300 warships, composed of Phoenician, Egyptian and Cypriot units, as well as thousands of Greek mercenaries and vast amounts of silver and gold. =Support of the Spartan king Agis III against Alexander= At around the same time, the Spartan king Agis III and the Athenian statesman Demosthenes organised forces to liberate their cities from the Macedonians. In the autumn of 333 BC, the Spartan King Agis III had met with the Persian commanders Pharnabazus and Autophradates, somewhere in the Aegean Sea, and revealed to them his plans for a war against Alexander--in Greece itself. The Persians agreed to support Agis; however, they could only spare him 30 talents and 10 ships. Agis also recruited the Greek mercenary survivors of Issus - who had served in the Persian army ‚Äì a force of 8,000 veterans. Memnon and Pharnabazus took Cos and Chios, but during the siege of Mytilene, the capital of Lesbos, Memnon died of a fever. Pharnabazus took control of the Persian forces in the Aegean, assisted by Autophradates. They captured Mytilene and the isle of Tenedos, which gave him control over the Hellespont. Pharnabazus further threatened Alexander's supplies by establishing a fortified position near Halicarnassus, which made the harbour inaccessible. He also took Samothrace, Siphnos and Andros and seized all Greek supply ships. However, after the Persian king Darius III lost the decisive Battle of Issus in November 333 BC, Pharnabazus became increasingly isolated. The Spartan king, Agis III, whilst still receiving ten ships and thirty talents of silver from the Achaemenids,Arrian, Campaigns of Alexander,p.125 withdrew from outright rebellion. Pharnabazus had to deal with rebellions in his conquered territory and many of his troops deserted him.Peter Green, Alexander of Macedon, 356-323 B.C.: a historical biography, 1974, p.254. His much reduced navy was defeated near Chios and Pharnabazus was captured. While being taken to Alexander, he managed to escape and went to Cos. Later life In 321 BC Pharnabazus commanded a squadron of cavalry for Eumenes, when the latter defeated Neoptolemus in the Wars of the Diadochi. 1878 engraving.Arrian, vii. 4; Plutarch, Parallel Lives, \\"Eumenes\\", 7; Diodorus Siculus, Bibliotheca, xviii. 30-32 What happened after his escape is not known. There is a gap in the records. It is assumed that he eventually submitted to Alexander, since in 324 BC, Artonis, the sister of Pharnabazus, was given in marriage to Eumenes by Alexander the Great.

Starting in 1934 the company produced a number of aircraft designs beginning with the Heston Phoenix and the Hordern-Richmond Autoplane. During the Second World War the company transitioned to being a sub-contractor, modifying Supermarine Spitfires amongst other types. After the war the company built aircraft components for companies such as de Havilland Aircraft. History Heston Aircraft Company Ltd was founded on 10 August 1934, being renamed from Comper Aircraft Company Ltd, that had moved to Heston aerodrome in March 1933, having previously built 40 Comper Swifts at Hooton Park aerodrome. Most of the directors of Comper Aircraft, including Nick Comper, resigned and gave up the assets to a new group of investors and directors. The new board was headed by Sir Norman J. Watson and included Brindley 'Bryn' R.S. Jones and George A. Lingham. Chief designer was George Cornwall, and Chief Test Pilot was Edmund G Hordern. On 8 November 1935, a new company was formed with the same name that took over the existing business and personnel. The company continued to support Comper aircraft and owners, but discarded its own Comper aircraft and assets.Smith (2002)Meaden (2005) The last surviving Heston Type 1 Phoenix II at Elstree aerodrome, Herts, in 1951 The first aircraft type to be designed and built by Heston Aircraft Company was the Heston Phoenix, a high-performance five-seat private owner and commercial aircraft, six of which were completed between 1935 and 1939. In 1936 the company built the Hordern-Richmond Autoplane, a twin-engined two-seat low-wing monoplane that had been designed by the firm's test pilot E.G. Hordern in collaboration with the Duke of Richmond and Gordon. The sole example was registered G-AEOG.Jackson (1974) Vol.3, p.255 In 1937 the company designed the Heston T.1/37 trainer, and the first of two prototypes flew at Heston in 1938 with serial L7706. It was not selected for production for the RAF.Jarrett (1991), p.754 In 1938 the company started work on the Heston Type 5 Racer which was to be used in an attempt on the world's air speed record. The aircraft had been designed by Napier & Son and had an estimated maximum speed of 480 mph. Registered G-AFOK, it first flew at Heston in June 1940 but was damaged on landing and a second example was not completed.Jackson (1974) Vol.3, p.253 In 1941 the company built the Boulton Paul P.92/2 half-scale piloted flying model of the Boulton Paul P.92, the full-scale contract for which had been cancelled in May 1940. The first flight of the sole P.92/2, serial V3142, was at Heston in early 1941.Meaden (2006) In 1947 the company designed and built the Heston JC.6, also known as the Heston A.2/45, that was intended to meet a Royal Air Force requirement for a new air observation post aircraft. Two examples were completed, serials VL529 and VL530 (not flown), but the competition was won by the Auster AOP.6.Lewis (1972), p.445 In 1948 the company built the Youngman-Baynes High Lift, and the sole aircraft first flew at Heston on 5 February 1948 with military serial VT789, later registered G-AMBL.Jackson (1974) Vol.3, p.337 Wartime aircraft and component design, modification and repair From early in its operations, the firm supplemented its aircraft construction by securing contracts for sub-assembly and components for aircraft. These included assemblies for the Vickers Wellesley in the late 1930s. During World War II, as a contractor within the Civilian Repair Organisation, Heston Aircraft Company was heavily engaged in repair and other support work on military aircraft. From late 1940, Heston Aircraft played a major role in modifying Supermarine Spitfires for the photographic reconnaissance task.Sturtivant (1997), pp.91‚Äì92 The company equipped the Spitfires with vertical and oblique cameras, additional fuel tanks, and modified cockpit canopies. Many marks of Spitfire were repaired at Heston throughout the war. Other types to be repaired and modified included the Fairchild Argus, Fairey Battle and the naval Vought SB2U Vindicator. Postwar aircraft modification Heston Aircraft was sub-contracted by de Havilland Aircraft to convert prototype de Havilland Hornets to Sea Hornet standards, for testing by the Fleet Air Arm. The first example, serial PX212, was completed to partial Sea Hornet F.20 standard but without folding wings. This was followed in January 1946 by serial PX219, that was fitted at Heston to full Sea Hornet F.20 standard with arrester gear, folding wings, tail-down accelerator gear and naval radio equipment.Thetford (1978), p.96 The company also converted two Hornet Is to Sea Hornet NF.21 night fighter standard. The first, serial PX230, first flew on 9 July 1946 with an A.S.H. radar scanner in its lengthened nose, but the folding wings and long dorsal fin fillet did not appear until the second aircraft, serial PX239, was converted. The modification involved fitting a second cockpit, to house the radar operator.Thetford (1978), p.98 Postwar aviation operations After the cessation of aircraft manufacture and modification, Heston Aircraft switched to a support role within the aviation industry, trading as Hestair. In early 1952 they were supplying components to de Havilland, Vickers-Armstrong and D. Napier & Son.Flight, 8 February 1952, p.23 In late 1953, the company was building passenger steps for BOAC de Havilland Comets and Bristol Britannias, and mobile servicing docks for BEA's Heathrow engineering base.Flight, 20 November 1953, p.688 Aircraft built *Heston Phoenix *Hordern-Richmond Autoplane *Heston T.1/37 *Heston Type 5 Racer *Boulton Paul P.92/2 *Heston JC.6 *Youngman-Baynes High Lift Notes References   * Smith, Ron. 2002.

He spent his entire football career at NAC Breda, from 1948 until 1971, when he retired from football. After his football career, Visschers was NAC Breda's team manager, one of the founders and a board member of the VVCS and a board member of the S.C.F. Jacques Visschers was a member of the KNVB‚Äôs arbitration committee and was a member of NAC Breda‚Äôs supervisory board. Visschers also was a member of the Order of Orange-Nassau and a member of honour of NAC Breda. Club career =Early years= Born in Amsterdam in 1940, Jacques Visschers only lived shortly in the Dutch capital. His father was originally from Breda and was temporarily transferred there for his work. At the age of 7 Visschers wanted to play for NAC Breda, but because he was Catholic, his neighbourhood supported Breda‚Äôs V.V. Baronie and he was too young, he did not join NAC Breda. When he turned 9 years old, he played his first youth match for NAC Breda.Jeroen Baldwin (2008), ‚ÄòNAC, a Way of Life‚Äô. Breda: van Ierland Uitgeverij, , page 14‚Äì18 During his younger career he played as an attacking midfielder. Cor Kools advised him at the age of 18 to become a striker. =Senior career= On March 6, 1960 Visschers made his debut for NAC Breda in the away match against Sittardia.John de Leeuw and Rob Lemmens (1992), ‚Äô80 jaar NAC‚Äô. In 1961 he became a semi professional football player, in which he earned 1500 guilders a year.http://www.derat.nl/int/nl/club/historiepersoonsinfo.asp?persid=286, Profile page on NAC Fanzine De Rat ONLINE In 1965 NAC was relegated to the Eerste Divisie, an event which Visschers held himself responsible for. ‚ÄúI always say it‚Äôs my fault. Normally I scored 10 to 15 goals a season. That season I only scored two goals‚Äù. At that time Visschers also thought about retirement. In his opinion football became too harsh and the technical players became the victim. On June 6, 1971 Visschers played his last match for NAC against MVV. After 282 matches, in which he scored 129 goals, he retired from professional football. Post-playing career After his football career Visschers worked in several roles in the financial sector. He ended up as a financial director for Nimox. Besides his work, he was still actively involved in football. From 1967 until 1977 he was a board member of the VVCS, the Dutch Association for Professional Football players. In 1978 Visschers was asked to join the KNVB‚Äôs arbitrary commission and later he joined the KNVB's financial commission. After his professional football career, Visschers was NAC's team manager. From the nineties onwards, Visschers postponed his voluntary activities and supported NAC Breda from the stands. In 2003 Visschers joined NAC's supervisory board, after the club was saved from near bankruptcy. From 2003 onwards, he was responsible for football affairs and scouting. Despite earlier denials towards fans and stakeholders by management and the Board members, it appeared at the end of season 2009‚Äì2010 that NAC's financial position was not stable. The club lost ‚Ç¨3.2 million that season, due to rebuilding the stadium and buying too expensive players. Board members Visschers, Willem van der Hoeven, and Bas Koomans resigned and Bas van Bavel became new chairman. Honours For his services to Dutch football,Visschers received the KNVB distinction De Nederlandse Leeuw (English: Dutch Lion). NAC's chairman Willem van der Hoeve granted Visschers NAC Breda's Member of Honour title for his services for the club.http://www.derat.nl/int/nl/nieuws/nieuwsitemnieuw.asp?id=13830, Newsarticle Member of Honour NAC Breda On August 24, 2008, Visschers was crowned as a member of the Order of Orange-Nassau.

Accessed Nov. 23, 2008. Upon Toon's debut, Publishers Weekly characterized the line as having the potential to revitalize the field of comics for kids: \\"Fran√ßoise Mouly is at it again.

Accessed Mar. 13, 2014. History The concept for Toon Books came to Mouly when her son Dash was learning to read, and his first-grade teacher assigned him \\"easy readers\\". Appalled by the lack of appeal of the educational material, Mouly instead spent time with her child and armloads of French comic books. In fact, one of the first releases in the Toon Books collection was Agn√®s Rosenstiehl's Silly Lilly, a.k.a. Mimi Cracra, a comic-book character familiar to millions of French toddlers. After proposing the Toon Books idea to major children books publishers from 2004 to 2007, and being rejected because the proposed books didn't fit existing categories, Mouly returned to her roots as a self- publisher. (She had founded her small press, RAW Books & Graphics, in 1977, and RAW Junior in 1999.) As she had done for the avant-garde comics and graphics magazine RAW, or the kids comics anthology Little Lit, both of which she co-edited, or for the covers of The New Yorker, Mouly gathered an array of talent for Toon Books. She published star authors (such as Harry Bliss, Art Spiegelman or Jeff Smith), veteran children's book authors (Geoffrey Hayes) as well as novice cartoonists (Eleanor Davis, the author of Stinky, was still in art school when Mouly contacted her). In fall 2012, Toon Books released its first Toon graphic novel, The Secret of the Stone Frog, by David Nytra. In 2014 Toon Books launched an imprint called Toon Graphics aimed at readers eight and up.  Distribution  When it first launched, Toon Books was distributed by Diamond Books, a unit of Diamond Comic Distributors dedicated to getting comics and graphic novels into the book trade. In 2010, Toon Books entered into a distribution partnership with Candlewick Press.Publishers Weekly staff. \\"Candlewick Partners with Toon Books: New imprint launches in October,\\" Publishers Weekly (Sep. 09, 2010). In late summer/early Fall of 2014, Toon Books launched a new line of TOON Graphics, an imprint for readers 8 and up and announced it'll be distributed after Jan. 1, 2015 by Consortium, a unit of Perseus, a move that reflects Toon's true status as a small but expanding independent publisher. TOON in the classroom Attitudes towards comics have radically changed since the 1954 Congressional hearings where they were denounced as the cause of juvenile delinquency. They are now touted by progressive librarians and educators as an effective tool for children to discover the pleasures of reading.Lyga, Allyson A. W. \\"Graphic Novels for (Really) Young Readers: Owly. Buzzboy. Pinky and Stinky. Who are these guys? And why aren‚Äôt they ever on the shelf?, \\" School Library Journal (March 1, 2006).Schwarz, Gretchen E. '\\"Graphic Novels for Multiple Literacies,\\" Journal of Adolescent & Adult Literacy (International Reading Association) (November 2002): \\"In an increasingly visual culture, literacy educators can profit from the use of graphic novels in the classroom.\\" As Art Spiegelman said, \\"Comics can be a gateway drug to literacy.\\" In the absence of any model or precedent, Mouly developed her own methodology to make sure the TOON Books would be well adapted to beginning readers' needs. She consulted with educators as she developed each individual book but also took rough drafts of the stories to schools, taking notes while watching children read.audio interview with Mouly on WKCR-FM, archived on the Teaching Graphic Novels blog (June 12, 2009) Responding to educators' and librarians' suggestions, Mouly has expanding the Toon Books line with bilingual versions (French publisher Casterman just released French-English Toon Books), audio versions (which will be developed into a novel multilingual tool for ESL and/or support for reluctant readers), as well as the first nonfiction Toon Book. Toon Books have been greeted enthusiastically by librarians, teachers, and parents looking for material for early readers. Early on, the Maryland State Superintendent of Schools, Dr. Nancy Grasmick, embraced Toon Books as part of the Maryland Comic Book Initiative. Other states' school systems are now considering Toon Books for their own Comics in the Classroom initiatives. The books are part of Renaissance Learning's Accelerated Reader Program and have been assigned Reading Recovery and Lexile levels, all of which are firsts for comics for young children. The Toon Books website offers free online learning tools for both students and educators. Downloadable lesson plans and activity sheets provide teachers with leveled lesson plans for kindergarten through third grade. Other tools include free online readers, videos, and games. The free \\"CarTOON Maker\\" invites readers to make their own cartoons. The online Readers Theater teaches educators how to get students to perform TOON Books. On the Toon site for kids, early readers can make paper puppets, watch videos, learn carTOON lessons from master cartoonists, and make their own cartoons. =The TOON Leveling System= The TOON into Reading program is divided into three levels:\\"Toon Books Level Correlations,\\" Toon Books website.

Life Yugoslavian stamp with Mihael Stroj's work Mihael Stroj was born the fifth of eight children to Anton Stroj and his wife Marija, n√©e Kokal. He spent his childhood in Ljubno in Upper Carniola. In 1812, his mother died of exhaustion. Shortly thereafter, his father remarried, sold his property in Ljubno and moved to Ljubljana with his family. Mihael Stroj attended the Glavna vzorna ≈°ola, where he completed the fourth class in 1817 with very good grades. He then joined the so-called artists‚Äô class, which he concluded in 1820 with distinction. He continued his schooling in Vienna, where he enrolled in the Academy of Fine Arts in 1821. The first of his works known to have survived, a sketch of a head and a self- portrait, date from this period. It is known that Stroj was still a student at the Academy of Fine Arts in 1825, but it is not known whether he concluded his studies there. In 1830, Stroj spent time in Zagreb, where he offered his services to the nobility and bourgeoisie as a portraitist. Because of the numerous commissions that he received, he remained in Zagreb. He lived in Croatia (with intermittent stays in Slovenia) until 1842. In this period, he painted not only a large number of portraits, but also works with religious content, including altar pictures for churches in Vugrovec and Nova Raƒça. In Croatia, Stroj was exposed to the ideas of Illyrism and associated with members of the Illyrian movement, including Stanko Vraz, Djuro Jelaƒçiƒá, the O≈æegoviƒá family and others. In 1841, Stroj married Margareta Berghaus, which whom he had five daughters. The following year, he returned to Ljubljana, where he continued to paint portraits of important members of the local bourgeoisie, although he also received further commissions from Croatia.

In 2013, the District administration reported that 124 pupils or 16.8% of the district's pupils received Special Education services, with 54.8% of the identified students having a specific learning disability. In 2012, the Benton Area School District administration reported that 122 pupils or 16.4% of the district's pupils received Special Education services, with 54.9% of identified students having a specific learning disability. In 2011, the Benton Area School District administration reported that 139 pupils or 18.2% of the district's pupils received Special Education services, with 56.8% of identified students having a specific learning disability. In 2010, the Benton Area School District administration reported that 135 pupils or 18% of the district's pupils received Special Education services, with 62% of identified students having a specific learning disability. In 2009, the district administration reported that 124 pupils or 16% of the district's pupils received Special Education services. In 2007, Pennsylvania Secretary of Education Gerald Zahorchak testified before the Pennsylvania House Education Committee regarding full day kindergarten. He claimed that districts which offered the program would see a significant decrease in special education students due to early identification and early intervention. He asserted the high cost of full day kindergarten would be recouped by Districts in lower special education costs. The District has offered full day kindergarten since 2003.PDE, Accountability Block Grant Report 2008-09, 2009 Benton Area School District has seen an increase in the percentage of special education students it serves. Each year the School Board has sought an exception to exceed its Act 1 Index limit, due to escalating costs for special education students. The requests have been approved in full, by the Pennsylvania Department of Education, each school year. The District engages in identification procedures to ensure that eligible students receive an appropriate educational program consisting of special education and related services, individualized to meet student needs. At no cost to the parents, these services are provided in compliance with state and federal law; and are reasonably calculated to yield meaningful educational benefit and student progress.Benton Area School District Special Education Information To identify students who may be eligible for special education, various screening activities are conducted on an ongoing basis. These screening activities include: review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech/language screening; and review by the Instructional Support Team or Student Assistance Team. By Pennsylvania law, the District has 60 calendar days, after receiving parental consent, to complete the evaluation. When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the District seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation. Parents who suspect their child is eligible may verbally request a multidisciplinary evaluation from a professional employee of the District or contact the building principal. Students in the Benton Area School District receive services through a combination of district operated programs and services contracted through the Central Susquehanna Intermediate Unit. Special education is designed to meet the needs of each exceptional student, including specifically designed instruction conducted in the classroom, home, community settings, hospitals, and other appropriate settings. By Pennsylvania law, the District has 60 calendar days, after receiving parental consent, to complete the evaluation. The IDEA 2004 requires each school entity to publish a notice to parents, in newspapers or other media, including the student handbook and website regarding the availability of screening and intervention services and how to access them. In 2010, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815,000 for special education services. This funding is in addition to the state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding. The Special Education funding structure is through the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) funds and state appropriations. IDEA funds are appropriated to the state on an annual basis and distributed through intermediate units (IUs) to school districts, while state funds are distributed directly to the districts. Total funds that are received by school districts are calculated through a formula. The Pennsylvania Department of Education oversees four appropriations used to fund students with special needs: Special Education; Approved Private Schools; Pennsylvania Chartered Schools for the Deaf and Blind; and Early Intervention. The Pennsylvania Special Education funding system assumes that 16% of the district's students receive special education services. It also assumes that each student's needs accrue the same level of costs.Browne, Patrick., Senate Education Committee Hearing on Special Education Funding & Accountability testimony, November 1, 2011 Over identification of students, in order to increase state funding, has been an issue in the Commonwealth. Some districts have more than 20% of its students receiving special education services while others have 10% supported through special education.Kintisch, Baruch., Public Hearing: Special Education Funding & Accountability Testimony, Education Law Center, November 11, 2011 The state requires each public school district and charter school to have a three-year special education plan to meet the unique needs of its special education students.Amy Morton, Executive Deputy Secretary, Public Hearing: Special Education Funding & Accountability Testimony, Pennsylvania Department of Education, November 11, 2011 In 2012, the Obama Administration's US Department of Education issued a directive that schools include students with disabilities in extracurricular activities, including sports.US Department of Education, U.S. Department of Education Clarifies Schools' Obligation to Provide Equal Opportunity to Students with Disabilities to Participate in Extracurricular Athletics, January 25, 2013 Benton Area School District received a $425,059 supplement for special education services in 2010. For the 2011‚Äì12, 2012‚Äì13, 2013-14 school years, all Pennsylvania public school districts received the same level of funding for special education that they received in 2010-11. This level funding is provided regardless of changes in the number of pupils who need special education services and regardless of the level of services the respective students required.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Investing in PA kids, April 2012 Additionally, the state provides supplemental funding for extraordinarily impacted students. The District must apply for this added funding. For the 2014-15 school year, Benton Area received $432,331 in state special education funding. For the 2016-17 school year, Benton Area School District received a 1.8% increase in state special education funding to $453,384.Pennsylvania Department of Education, BEF, Special Education Funding, RTL Grants 2016-17, July 2016 *2016-17 - $454,503 *2017-18 - $465,019, a 2.3% increasePDE, SPecial Education Funding 2017-18, 2017 =Gifted education= The District Administration reported that 27 or 3.80% of its students were gifted in 2009.PDE, Gifted Students as Percentage of Total Enrollment by School District/Charter School, July 2010 At Benton Area Elementary School, the program focuses on experiences directly related to general classes, expanding on current instructional material. Acceleration through the grade level content is provided by a gifted instructor, utilized enrichment opportunities, and advanced content related activities. The program is based on the interests of the student, allowing them to develop critical thinking skills. Secondary level students (7‚Äì12) are provided the opportunity to participate in Honors and Advanced Placement courses. Additional enrichment activities are provided by the gifted instructor based on student interest. Gifted students also have the ability to pursue higher education courses through dual enrollment and online programs. They can pursue interests through distance learning courses and projects developed to utilize skills and challenge academic performance. Students are permitted to pursue grade level acceleration leading to early graduation. By law, the District must provide mentally gifted programs at all grade levels. The referral process for a gifted evaluation can be initiated by teachers or parents by contacting the student's building principal and requesting an evaluation. All requests must be made in writing. The principal acts as the case manager for the referral process. A 60 calendar day time-line begins when the signed Permission to Evaluate form is received. To be eligible for mentally gifted programs in Pennsylvania, a student must have a cognitive ability of at least 130 as measured on a standardized ability test by a certified school psychologist. Other factors that indicate giftedness will also be considered for eligibility. Through the strategic planning process, the Superintendent must ensure that the school district provides a continuum of program and service options to meet the needs of all mentally gifted students for enrichment, acceleration, or both. The district's program is based on student needs and provides differentiated curriculum using acceleration, enrichment and pull-out options. Wellness policy Benton Area School Board established a district wellness policy in 2006 ‚Äì Policy 246.Benton Area School Board Policy Manual The policy deals with nutritious meals served at school, the control of access to some foods and beverages during school hours, age appropriate nutrition education for all students, and physical education for students K-12. The policy is in response to state mandates and federal legislation (P.L. 108 ‚Äì 265). The law dictates that each school district participating in a program authorized by the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq) or the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1771 et seq) \\"shall establish a local school wellness policy by School Year 2006.\\" =Highmark Healthy High 5 grant= In 2011, Benton Area School District received funding through a Highmark Healthy High 5 grant. Benton Area High School received $4,848 which was used to purchase equipment to implement the Benton Wii Play 60 program to enhance current physical education programming.Highmark Foundation, 2011 School Challenge Grants, 2011 Beginning in 2006, Highmark Foundation engaged in a 5-year, $100 million program to promote lifelong healthy behaviors in children and adolescents through local nonprofits and schools. Bullying policy The Benton Area School District administration reported there were three incidents of bullying in the District in 2013. Additionally, there was one assault on a student and no sexual incidents involving students. The local law enforcement was involved in nine incidents at the schools, with four arrests. The Benton Area School District administration reported there were no incidents of bullying in the Bistrict in 2009. The Benton Area School Board has provided the district's antibully policy online. All Pennsylvania schools are required to have an anti-bullying policy incorporated into their Code of Student Conduct. The policy must identify disciplinary actions for bullying and designate a school staff person to receive complaints of bullying. The policy must be available on the school's website and posted in every classroom. All Pennsylvania public schools must provide a copy of its anti-bullying policy to the Office for Safe Schools every year, and shall review their policy every three years. Additionally, the district must conduct an annual review of that policy with students. The Center for Schools and Communities works in partnership with the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime & Delinquency and the Pennsylvania Department of Education to assist schools and communities as they research, select and implement bullying prevention programs and initiatives. Education standards relating to student safety and antiharassment programs are described in the 10.3. Safety and Injury Prevention in the Pennsylvania Academic Standards for Health, Safety and Physical Education. Enrollment In 2016, enrollment declined to 674 pupils Kindergarten through 12th grade one year earlier than projected by the Pennsylvania Department of Education. Enrollment was projected to decline to 680 students by 2017<Pennsylvania Department of Education, Benton Area School District Enrollment Data and Projections, January 2010 According to Pennsylvania Department of Education enrollment reports, there were less than 750 students enrolled in K-12 in 2009‚Äì10 school year at Benton Area School District. There were 65 students in the Class of 2009. The district's class of 2010 had 55 students. Approximately 5‚Äì10% of the district's students graduate from Columbia-Montour Vocational Technical School. In 2015, the administration reported enrollment had declined to 697 pupils. In 2008, Benton Area School District administrative costs were $790 per pupil. The lowest administrative cost per pupil in Pennsylvania was $398 per pupil.Fenton, Jacob., Pennsylvania School District Data: Will School Consolidation Save Money?, The Morning Call, February 2009 A study of Pennsylvania public school spending, conducted by Standard and Poor's, examined the consolidation of Benton Area School administration with 4 neighboring districts: East Lycoming School District, Millville Area School District, Northwest Area School District and Sullivan County School District. The study found that consolidation of the administration with an adjacent school district would achieve substantial administrative cost savings which varied by district. The study found that consolidation with Millville Area School District would save taxpayers $1,433,719 a year. Consolidation with East Lycoming School District would have saved $1,678,358 a year. The savings came from consolidating administrations without closing any local schools. According to a 2009 school district administration consolidation proposal by Governor Edward Rendell, the excessive administrative overhead dollars could be redirected to improve lagging academic achievement, to enrich the academic programs or to reduce property taxes.Edward Rendell, Governor and Mary Soderberg, Secretary of the Budget., 2009‚Äì10 Executive Budget Facts Pennsylvania School District Consolidation, February 2009 Consolidation of two central administrations into one would not require the closing of any local schools. The Governor's proposal called for the savings to be redirected to improving lagging reading and science achievement, to enriching the academic programs or to reducing residents' property taxes. Over the next 10 years, rural Pennsylvania school enrollment was projected to decrease 8 percent. As the enrollment declined, per pupil administrative costs of the schools continued to rise. In March 2011, the Pennsylvania Institute of Certified Public Accountants released a report finding that the state would save hundreds of millions of tax dollars by cutting the number of school administrations in half through consolidation, with no impact on programs offered to students. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has one of the highest numbers of school districts in the nation. In Pennsylvania, 80% of the school districts serve student populations under 5,000, and 40% serve less than 2,000. This results in excessive school administration bureaucracy and not enough course diversity.2009‚Äì10 Executive Budget Fast Facts. Pennsylvania Office of the Governor In a survey of 88 superintendents of small districts, 42% of the 49 respondents stated that they thought consolidation would save money without closing any schools. Budget Pennsylvania public school districts budget and expend funds according to procedures mandated by the General Assembly and the Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE). An annual operating budget is prepared by school district administrative officials. A uniform form is furnished by the PDE and submitted to the board of school directors for approval prior to the beginning of each fiscal year on July 1. Under Pennsylvania's Taxpayer Relief Act, Act 1 of the Special Session of 2006, all school districts of the first class A, second class, third class and fourth class must adopt a preliminary budget proposal. The proposal must include estimated revenues and expenditures and the proposed tax rates. This proposed budget must be considered by the Board no later than 90 days prior to the date of the election immediately preceding the fiscal year. The preliminary budget proposal must also be printed and made available for public inspection at least 20 days prior to its adoption. The board of school directors may hold a public hearing on the budget, but are not required to do so. The board must give at least 10 days‚Äô public notice of its intent to adopt the final budget according to Act 1 of 2006.Pennsylvania General Assembly, Taxpayer Relief Act, Act 1 of the Special Session of 2006, June 27, 2006 In 2016, the average teacher salary in Benton Area School District was $50,324 a year. The District employed 72 teachers and administrators, with a top salary of $110,000. Benton Area School District teacher and administrator retirement benefits are equal to at least 2.00% x Final Average Salary x Total Credited Service. (Some teachers benefits utilize a 2.50% benefit factor.) After 40 years of service, Pennsylvania public school teachers and administrators can retire with 100% of the average salary of their final 3 years of employment. According to a study conducted at the American Enterprise Institute, in 2011, public school teachers‚Äô total compensation is roughly 50 percent higher than they would likely receive in the private sector. The study found that the most generous benefits that teachers receive are not accounted for in many studies of compensation including: pension, retiree health benefits and job security. In 2014-15, the state mandated District contribution to the teacher pension fund rose to 21.40% of employee salaries and in 2015-16 it rose again to 25.84% of total District salaries. In 2017-18, the mandated contribution rate for state and local taxpayers is 32.57% of each teacher's salary. In 2013, the average teacher salary in Benton Area School District was $50,866 a year, while the cost of the benefits teachers received was $22,203 per employee, for a total annual average teacher compensation of $73,070.

Reserves In 2008, Benton Area School District reported an unreserved designated fund balance of zero and an unreserved-undesignated fund balance of $2,330,463.00. In 2010, Benton Area School District Administration reported $933,005 in the unreserved-undesignated fund balance. The District reported zero in its unreserved-designated fund in 2010. Pennsylvania public school district reserve funds are divided into two categories ‚Äì designated and undesignated. The undesignated funds are not committed to any planned project. Designated funds and any other funds, such as capital reserves, are allocated to specific projects. School districts are required by state law to keep 5 percent of their annual spending in the undesignated reserve funds to preserve bond ratings. By law the state limits the total unreserved-undesignated fund balance at 8% of the annual budget for school districts that have budgets over $19 million a year. According to the Pennsylvania Department of Education, from 2003 to 2010, as a whole, Pennsylvania school districts amassed nearly $3 billion in reserved funds.Murphy, Jan., Pennsylvania's public schools boost reserves, CentreDaily Times, September 22, 2010 In 2014, the Board reported reserves of $1,658,769.PDE, Investing in Pennsylvania Students 2014, July 2014 In 2015, the District reported $2,216,651 in reserve funds.Pennlive.con, PA School District Reserves, 2017 Audit In January 2010, the Pennsylvania Auditor General conducted a performance audit of the Benton Area School District.

Tuition Students who live in the Benton Area School District's attendance area may choose to attend one of Pennsylvania's 157 public charter schools. A student living in a neighboring public school district or a foreign exchange student may seek admission to Benton Area School District. For these cases, the Pennsylvania Department of Education sets an annual tuition rate for each school district. It is the amount the public school district pays to a charter school for each resident student that attends the charter and it is the amount a nonresident student's parents must pay to attend the Benton Area School District's schools. The 2012 tuition rates are Elementary School - $8,707.03, High School - $9,914.11. Benton Area School District is funded by a combination of: a local earned income tax 1.1%, a local property tax, a real estate transfer tax 0.5%, and grants coupled with substantial funding from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the federal government. Interest earnings on accounts also provide nontax income to the District. In the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, pension income and Social Security income are exempted from state personal income tax and local earned income tax, regardless of the level of the individual's personal wealth. The average Pennsylvania public school teacher pension in 2011 exceeds $60,000 a year plus they receive federal Social Security benefits: both are free of Pennsylvania state income tax and local income tax which funds local public schools. Effective 2016, active duty military are also exempted from paying the local earned income tax in Pennsylvania. =State basic education funding= According to a report from Representative Todd Stephens office, Benton Area School District receives 33.5% of its annual revenue from the state.

Race to the Top grant Benton Area School Administration did not apply for the Federal Race to the Top grant. According to the PDE, the school would have received up to $600,000. School district officials determined that abiding by 'Race to the Top' requirements would cost more than the district would receive. Participation required the administration, the school board and the local teachers' union to sign an agreement to prioritize improving student academic success.

A mill is $1 of tax for every $1,000 of a property's assessed value. Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the commonwealth as it creates a significant disparity in taxation within a community and across a region. On the local level, Pennsylvania district revenues are dominated by two main sources: 1) Property tax collections, which account for the vast majority (between 75‚Äì85%) of local revenues; and 2) Act 511 tax collections, which are around 15% of revenues for school districts. Property taxes, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, apply only to real estate - land and buildings. The property tax is not levied on cars, business inventory, or other personal property. Certain types of property are exempt from property taxes, including: places of worship, places of burial, private social clubs, charitable and educational institutions and all government property (local, state and federal). Additionally, service related, disabled US military veterans may seek an exemption from paying property taxes. Unlike other states, under Pennsylvania state tax policy, natural gas and oil pipelines are exempted from property taxes. A new major transmission gas pipeline is being installed in the District called the Atlantic Sunrise pipeline. Pipeline companies prohibit development within the 100 foot wide right-of-way, there by limiting future development options for the landowner. This limits future potential property tax revenues for the school district, by constraining future land development. Benton Area School District is adversely impacted in this way.The Nature Conservancy ‚Äì Pennsylvania Chapter, Natural Gas Pipelines Pennsylvania Energy Impacts Assessment, December 16, 2011The Nature Conservancy, Marcellus Shale Gas Development in Bradford County, December 16, 2011 When a Pennsylvania public school district includes municipalities in two counties, each of which has different rates of property tax assessment, a state board equalizes the tax rates between the counties.State Tax Equalization Board, State Tax Equalization Board About US, 2011 In 2010, miscalculations by the State Tax Equalization Board (STEB) were widespread in the Commonwealth and adversely impacted funding for many school districts, including those that did not cross county borders. *2015-16 - 49.0000 mills. *2014-15 - 49.0000 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Real Estate Tax Rates by School District - 2014-15 Real Estate Mills, 2015 *2013-14 - 46.2020 millsPennsylvania Department of Education, Real Estate Tax Rates by School District 2013-14 Real Estate Mills 2014 *2012-13 - 43.0582 mills. *2011-12 - 42.0902 mills *2010-11 - 41.5000 mills. *2009-10 - 41.5000 mills. *2008-09 - 41.5000 mills. *2007-08 - 41.5000 mills. *2006-07 - 41.5000 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, 2006 *2005-06 - 41.0000 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, 2005 The average yearly property tax paid by Columbia County residents amounts to about 2.72% of their yearly income.

According to the Tax Foundation, Pennsylvania ranked 11th in the U.S. in 2008 in terms of property taxes paid as a percentage of home value (1.34%) and 12th in the country in terms of property taxes as a percentage of income (3.55%).New Census Data on Property Taxes on Homeowners, Tax Foundation, September 22, 2009. Act 1 Adjusted index The Act 1 of 2006 Index regulates the rates at which each school district can raise property taxes in Pennsylvania. Districts are not allowed to raise taxes above that index unless they allow voters to vote by referendum, or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index for the 2011‚Äì2012 school year is 1.4 percent, but it can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a public school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year. In June 2011, the Pennsylvania General Assembly eliminated six exceptions to the Act 1 Index. Several exceptions were maintained: 1) costs to pay interest and principal on indebtedness incurred prior to September 4, 2004 for Act 72 schools and prior to June 27, 2006 for non-Act 72 schools; 2) costs to pay interest and principal on electoral debt; 3) costs incurred in providing special education programs and services (beyond what is already paid by the State); and 4) costs due to increases of more than the Index in the school's share of payments to PSERS (PA school employees pension fund) taking into account the state mandated PSERS contribution rate.

The homestead exclusion allows homeowners real property tax relief of up to one half of the median assessed value of homesteads in the taxing jurisdiction (county, school district, city, borough, or township). Benton Area School District residents may also qualify for the Pennsylvania Property Tax/Rent Rebate program. It is provided for several groups of school district residents, including: low income residents aged 65 and older; widows and widowers aged 50 and older; and people with disabilities age 18 and older. The income limit is $35,000 for homeowners. The maximum rebate for both homeowners and renters is $650. Applicants can exclude one-half (1/2) of their Social Security income, consequently people who have an income of substantially more than $35,000 still qualify for a rebate. Individuals must apply annually for the rebate. This tax rebate can be taken in addition to Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief.Elias, Joe., Pennsylvania Treasury Department to issue $238 million in property tax rebates, The Harrisburg Patriot-News, June 30, 2012 The Property tax/rent rebate program is funded by revenues from the Pennsylvania Lottery.

The main feature of this area is the Parish of the Immaculate Conception (Inmaculada Concepci√≥n) which began as a Franciscan monastery in the 16th century. The entrance to the cloister area contains murals related to the early evangelization efforts of this order. They include scenes such as Hern√°n Cort√©s greeting the first Franciscan missionaries in Mexico, the martyrdom of some of the first young converts to Christianity and even a scene where the monks are flogging Cort√©s. The church itself inside has suffered the theft of a number of its antique pieces. The name Ozumba comes from Nahuatl meaning ‚Äúover the streams of water‚Äù. ‚Äúde Alzate‚Äù was added to the formal name in honor of the scientist Jos√© Antonio Alzate y Ramirez Santillana who was born here. History Font from the Ozumba church The first human inhabitants were hunter-gatherers of various ethnicities. Later, the presence of the Olmecs helped to form the first sedentary agrarian societies. After this, the Nahua eventually became the dominant ethnicity. Most of these Nahuas were of the Xochimilca and Chichimeca tribes. By the 16th century, the area was firmly under the control of the Aztec Empire as a tributary province. After arriving to the Valley of Mexico, the first Spanish crossed through here on their way to Tenochtitlan. The peoples here allied themselves with the Spanish in 1521 against the Aztecs, an alliance which allowed the people here to suffer less modification of their lifestyles than in other parts of early New Spain. However, this area remained a tributary province with tribute going to the Spanish instead of the Aztecs. The area was divided into encomenderos, but the natives maintained much of their communal farmland despite efforts by hacienda owners to confiscate them. During the colonial period, the main town in this area was Chimalhuacan, generally called Chimalhuacan-Chalco. The village of Ozumba was founded in 1525 by Francisco Atlanlzincuilzin, who was its first leader. Evangelization was done by the Franciscans at the end of the 16th century, when the monastery was most likely established here. The earliest parts of the building date from this time. The first formal church parish was established here in 1606, according to the first records of baptism, which dates from 1621. In this book, which extends to 1650, the baptisms of the indigenous are recorded in Nahuatl and those of the Europeans in Spanish. Ozumba was under the religious jurisdiction of Tlalmanalco. The bishops and other administrators eventually ceased being monks, with these duties handed over to regular clergy. From 1773 to 1813, a large number of priests were assigned to the parish, which only two staying long term. During the Mexican War of Independence, Morelos‚Äô success in Cuautla forced viceroy Felix Calleja to retreat to Ozumba with more than 200 wounded. After Independence and the erection of the State of Mexico, Ozumba became a municipality in 1825, when the area had about 4,000 inhabitants. ‚Äúde Alzate‚Äù was added to the official name in 1879. From 1860 to 1870, the area was plagued by a bandit group known as Los Plateados. The first train arrived in 1882, connecting Ozumba with the outside world, especially Cuautla and Mexico City. This contact resulted in the replacement of Nahuatl with Spanish as the dominant language. During the Mexican Revolution, Ozumba was on the border of lands controlled by the government and those controlled by the rebels, leading to significant violence here, including the derailment of the train by Zapatista troops. Ozumba remained mostly in government hands, but the Zapatistas attacked frequently, capturing it for brief periods on two occasions. The violence ended in 1917, and the town has been mostly quiet since. The original municipal palace was demolished in the 1950s and replaced with the current one. The municipal market was constructed in the 1970s. Violence returned to the town when gunmen, presumably from ‚ÄúLa Familia Michoacana‚Äù drug cartel, shot up municipal president Luis Alfredo Galicia Arrieta's house in the town in the middle of the night in December 2009. The town View of Popocatepetl The town of Ozumba is located on Fed 115 south of Amecameca. It is part of the ‚ÄúVolcano Route‚Äù (a tourism promotion of the State of Mexico) which includes the municipalities of Chalco, Tlalmanalco, Amecameca and Nepantla. The town and municipality experience ash and small quakes from the Popocat√©petl volcano from time to time. For this reason, it is one of the 20 communities near the active volcano subject to emergency evacuation procedures in the event of an eruption. These procedures affect 60,000 people in fourteen municipalities in Mexico State alone. The town has narrow streets whose layout dates back to the colonial era. The main plaza is a simple layout with an open area for concerts and other events and a kiosk of simple design. It is surrounded by stands offering street food such as tacos and quesadillas. However the most of the town's activity focuses on the Nuestra Senora de la Inmaculada Concepcion Church with its large atrium. Many come here to rest, and children are allowed to play in the area as well as to see the murals painted in the side entrance. Facade of the church The Church of Nuestra Se√±ora de la Inmaculada Conception began as a Franciscan monastery established in the 16th century. Only the side entrance and columns of the church date from the 16th century. The rest, including the church, dates from the 17th century to the early 18th century. This latter construction was due to the dilapidated condition of the original church, which was rebuilt, starting in 1696. The tower was constructed in 1717 by architects Juan Perez and Juan Ventura. Baptismal records indicate that this monastery church became the parish church of the area in the 17th century. The facade has undergone some changes since it was first built. Today, it consists of three bodies crowned by a crest. In the first two bodies there are images between the columns. The third body is decorated with a stone image of the Virgin Mary. The crest contains in image of God, the Father looking down on those entering the church with hands spread in blessing. The tower contains stone and plaster decorative elements. The two main features are the main altarpieces and the high choir on the right hand side. This is one of the few of its kind remaining in Mexico and it is completely made of intricately carved wood. Main altar The main altarpiece completely covers the wall behind the main altar. The center part of the cut out and replaced by a Neoclassical one. Its restoration to a more original appearance is relatively recent and based on research by the INAH to determine what it probably looked like. In the center of the altarpiece is an image of the Immaculate Conception, surrounded by images of the saints associated with the life of the Virgin Mary as well as Franciscan friars such as Anthony of Padua, Diego de Acala Obispo, Francis of Assisi and Bernardino of Siena and others such as Saint Dominic and Augustine of Hippo. Two sculptures are missing... those of Saint Cecilia and King David due to theft. Although extremely ornate, this piece is considered to be part of the ‚Äúsober‚Äù Baroque tradition. The entire altarpiece is gilded and the main feature is the repeating Solomonic Baroque columns. Other colonial altarpieces in various styles line the nave and stand in the side chapels, some with paintings by well known Mexican artists such as Juan Correa and the Arellano family. The altarpiece of the Passion of Christ was begun in 1741. Its sculpting was finished in 1746 and was gilded between 1749 and 1753. It was originally dedicated to Jesus the Nazarene until the 19th century. This sculpture was then moved to the second body. There used to be seven archangels here but only two remain. The Chapel of the Third Order has a more traditional altarpiece, with two bodies approachable from three sides. It contains niches, some of which are now empty. These contained images such as those of San Hugo and the Immaculate Conception. The altarpiece was done by a sculptor named Domingo and contains two of his paintings. At the top are paintings done by someone named Arellano. Some aspects of the altars are modern such as the statue of Th√©r√®se de Lisieux. Originally, there was a statue of Anthony of Padua here. Unfortunately, this church, along with a number of others in the area, has suffered the theft of artwork. This have included statues of saints, altar items and paintings such as ‚ÄúThe Transit of the Virgin‚Äù which was stolen in the 1990s. Mural of the \\"Martyred Children\\" The monastery area is to the right of the church. The main entrance is a ‚Äúporter√≠a‚Äù or an arched, colonnaded entry. Inside this porter√≠a are murals depicting scenes from the early evangelization efforts by the Franciscans in Mexico. It has been theorized that this porter√≠a originally served as the monastery's chapel and where evangelization efforts were concentrated. This would explain the six major scenes which are depicted on the walls. These murals are all that is left of the monastery's original decoration from the 16th century. The murals were retouched in the mid 19th century. They are one of the earliest examples of Rubens motif in the New World and contain one of the very few depictions of Peter of Ghent. On the left hand side is a depiction of Hern√°n Cort√©s greeting the arrival of the first twelve Franciscan monks to arrive to Tenochtitlan-Mexico City. These friars had walked barefoot from Veracruz on the Gulf coast, 250 to the east. Cort√©s greets them on the causeway leading into the city as the head of a retinue of conquistadors and high ranking Aztec nobles. The Aztecs show surprise when Cort√©s and the other Spaniards bow to the monks. To the right of the main door is a depicted of the ‚ÄúNi√±os M√°rtires‚Äù or child martyrs of Tlaxcala. According to the story, in 1527, Axotecatl, one of the four lords of Tlaxcala, sent his sons to be educated by the Franciscans. Then the boys returned, they had converted to Christianity and began to smash native idols and scolding their father for his polygamy and drinking. The lord beat one son, who the Spaniards named Cristobal, and then burned him to death. The other two boys fled but continued to preach until they met a martyr's fate. This scene not only shows martyrdom but also shows how the Franciscans invested in childhood education and even suggests that they may have loved the boys more than their own parents. To the far right is a relative rare scene of Cort√©s being flagellated, which depicts a story from Texcoco. According to the story, an Indian missed mass and was punished by public flogging, prompting an angry response from the native community. To pacify the situation, Cort√©s arranged with the friars to arrive late to Mass and to receive the flogging in front of the natives. The idea was to show that the punishment was impartial. However, the Franciscans also viewed Cort√©s flogging as voluntary and as a sign of his piety. The depiction has two messages, one of the special relationship between the Church and the Spaniards as well as the acceptance of public punishment. Above the doorframe is an image of Francis of Assisi holding three globes that support an image of Mary Immaculate as Mar√≠a de √Ågreda writes the Mystical city of God and Duns Scotus writes a defense of the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception. This image would appear in later monasteries such as the Mission Landa in the Sierra Gorda of Quer√©taro, at a college in Zacatecas and another college in Mexico City. Although most are (semi) abandoned and not restored for tourists, the town has a number of other architectural and historic sites. The abandoned train station is on the Mexico City-Cuautla section of the Ferrocarril Interocianico (Inter-Ocean Railway) which connected Acapulco with Veracruz. The station was built in 1895. Casa de Cultura Jos√© A. Alzate has temporary art and other exhibits as well as classes in dance, painting, music, theater and other arts. It is named after Jose Antonio de Alzate y Ramirez Santillana, who was baptized here in 1737. He was a scientist with influence in the social, political and economic fields during the intellectual movement of Mexico in the 18th century. The scientist's childhood home is also located here. Colonial era constructions include the Juan Rulfo house, the Casa de la Nueva York and the Chapel of San Francisco, one of the oldest churches in the municipality. Rodolfo Ortega house is representative of the architectural style of the municipality. The municipal market is located on the main road in front of the church. It is a typical rural market of Mexico State selling basic necessities such as foods, seed, grain and even cattle. Particularly during the rainy season, this market, as well as many others in the area, also offers up to 90 species of edible wild mushrooms. These are most often sold by older women in areas just outside the market building. The value of mushrooms in this region of Mexico helps to maintain traditional ethnobiological knowledge. The most common prepared food items sold in the food stalls are barbacoa and moronga, a type of blood sausage prepared in various ways. Principal festivities here is the Feast of the Nuestra Se√±ora de la Inmaculada Concepcion on 8 December, the anniversary of the municipality on 23 June and the Festival of the Gremios on 15 August. On feast days, traditional dances include Concheros, Moros y Cristianos and Marotas. There is one institution of higher education located here called the Universidad Alzate de Ozumba. The municipality Municipal palace As municipal seat, the town of Ozumba is the governing authority for thirteen other named communities. Together the municipality has a total population of 24,055 (2005) over 65% of which lives in the town proper. The municipality covers a territory of 48.92km2. It is bordered by Ayapango, Amecameca, Atlautla, Tepetlixpa and Juchitepec as well as to the south by the state of Morelos. The most important geographical feature of the area is the Popocatepetl volcano although it lies outside of the municipality proper. Much of the land here was tempered by past lava flows. The town is surrounded by many ravines and the municipality's territory is very rugged. The ravines are formed by small streams, whose water flows and swirls into spirals. This is what gives the area its name. Most ravines align northeast to southwest. The highest elevation is the Xoyacan Mountain which separates it from Amecameca and Ayapango. Another major elevation is the Chimal or Huilotepec Mountain which also forms part of its border, separating it from Tepetlixpa. The Cuautepec Mountain separates the municipality from the state of Morelos. Between the town of Ozumba and Chimalhuacan there is a small elevation which is locally known as the Cerrito (small mountain) and it is one of the few elevations in the center of the municipality. The only natural surface water is found in ravines and springs. The most notable ravines are called the Tlapunatlaco, the San Bartolo, and the San Francisco. The north and central parts of the municipality have a temperate climate (C(w2) (w) b(i)g), while the lower southern part has a somewhat warmer climate (A) C(w2) (w) a(i¬¥)). Most of the wild vegetation here is pine and oak forest, which has been heavily exploited by man. Fauna includes armadillo, cacomixtle), rabbits, bobcats, bats, skunks, hummingbirds, doves, butterflies, scorpions and spiders. Sixty five percent of the land here is used for agriculture with most of the rest being developed. Some of the main crops are produced in family orchards and include walnuts, capulins, avocados, Mexican hawthorns, peaches, apricots, apples, and others. A number of commercial flowers and medicinal plants are also grown here. Agriculture is still the most important economic activity, with some livestock and some logging done at the foothills of the Popocatepetl volcano. The only industry is small workshops which produce farm implements, saddles, fireworks and boots .Despite agriculture's importance, just under half the municipality's population is engaged in commerce. The municipality has two main attractions, a variety of natural areas and parks and its architectural heritage consisting of early colonial churches and monasteries completed before the end of the 17th century. The community of San Mateo Tecalco has both. The largest park Parque Olla and there are year-round fresh water springs at Pozas de Santa Maria. It also has one of the oldest churches in the municipality. Just south of the municipal seat is the community of San Vicent Chimalhuacan, which is often called Chimalhuacan- Chalco or just simply Chimal. Natural attractions here include the Parque El Salto with its small waterfall, gardens and caves located just west of the Dominican monastery. This area is popular with local tourists despite the lack of facilities. Another natural area is the Parque La Herradura, which is a forested area in the foothills of the Popocatepetl volcano. The most important architectural attraction here is the former Dominican monastery which dates from the 16th century. It has a wide church with thick buttresses. The main entrance is sculpted in sandstone containing the coats of arms of Castilla and of the Dominican order. The complex overall is a mix of Moorish and Plateresque styles. A plaque states that Sor Juana In√©s de la Cruz was baptized here in 1651 although she was really baptized in 1648. The baptismal font dates from 1542. This church has been converted into a cultural center due to the annual celebrations held here to commemorate the birth of Sor Juana In√©s de la Cruz. The parish church for the community is the Church of San Vicente Ferrer which was once the richest church in the municipality. Today it has a small archeological museum containing carved stone, ceramics, clay figures, utensils and more from the pre-Hispanic era. The Arco de los Conejos and Los Guardias are colonial era monuments marking the entrance to San Vicente Chimalhuacan. One good idea and recomendaci√≥n is to be helped by experts in the area. Some of them offer very affordable exclusive promotions for \\"pueblear\\" in Mexico. They can help you with ideas, tips and destinations that are fun, interesting and at the same time secure for all the family. There are options such as Puebleando ando that is specialized in town tourism through Mexico and can very helpful when traveling to the country. . There are a number of other attractions in the more rural areas of the municipality. The Pozas del Alvaresco and the Pozas de Atzinco are natural springs which emit water during the rainy season. The Hacienda de Actopan is located just east of the town and is available to rent for functions. The Hacienda de Actempan is located east of the town and is semi abandoned. The Puente de los Aztecs is a pre-Hispanic era bridge located in a rural area of the municipality.

His first job immediately after graduation was at Digital Equipment Corporation where he initially worked on VAX performance evaluation and then on Alpha performance evaluation. As a consequence of his performance evaluation work, he became a pioneer in the quantitative approach to computer architecture. In conjunction with the development and application of various performance analysis techniques, he contributed a variety of research and advanced development ideas that were incorporated into various VAX and Alpha designs. He is well known, along with his co-author Douglas W. Clark, for a seminal paper on the quantitative analysis of processor architectures,A Characterization of Processor Performance in the VAX-1 l/780, Joel S. Emer, Douglas W. Clark, 1984, lEEE which was published in the 11th International Symposium on Computer Architecture. That paper also contained the result that the VAX-11/780's performance was actually 0.5 MIPS instead of 1 MIPS as was previously claimed by DEC. That result helped popularize what Clark called the iron law of performance that related cycles per instruction (CPI), frequency and number of instructions to computer performance. Dr Emer has also contributed to simultaneous multithreading (SMT), memory dependence prediction via store sets, and soft error analysis, and led the development of the Asim simulator.

While the town of Villa del Carb√≥n is the largest in the municipality, it is not the oldest. The municipality contains a number of villages of Otom√≠ and Nahua origins, in which much of the indigenous culture still survives. The municipality's territory was defined in 1714 when a region known as Chiapan, split into what is now Chapa de Mota and Villa del Carb√≥n. At that time, however, the community which is now a municipal seat did not have an official name; it was known first only by the name of its church Nuestra Se√±ora de la Pe√±a de Francia, and later by being a major supplier of charcoal. This would lead to the name of Villanueva del Carb√≥n de Nuestra Se√±ora Santa Mar√≠a de la Pe√±a de Francia, which eventually shortened to Villa del Carb√≥n. The major portions of the municipality's glyph, which serves as it coat-of-arms, does not reflect the town of Villa del Carb√≥n but rather two of its oldest communities: Taxhimay and San Lorenzo Pueblo Nuevo. The municipality covers an area of 356.14 km2 and has a total population of 39,587 (2005 census). Of this total, 8,029 live in the municipal seat of Villa del Carb√≥n and the rest live among the other 57 communities which rely on the seat for government purposes. The municipality border the municipalities of Jilotepec, Jiquipilco, Tepotzotl√°n, Nicolas Romero, Chapa de Mota and Morelos in Mexico State, with Tepej√≠ del R√≠o, Hidalgo State bordering it to the north. The municipality is divided into three \\"barrios\\" or districts named Pendo, Centro, and Taxhihu√©. Today, the municipality's economy is based primarily on tourism, as it has a number of streams, rivers and dams suitable for water sports, trout-fishing and camping facilities. It is also the home of a nationally recognized charreada(a type of rodeo) venue, that hosts major events. The municipal seat A traditional structure in the municipal seat The town of Villa del Carb√≥n lies near the center of the municipality at an altitude of 2,600 meters above sea level and has a population of 8,029 (2005 census). Most of the houses and other buildings in this town have white facades with pitched roofs covered in Spanish-style clay tile. The roads in the center of town are of cobblestone. The main church of the town is called the Temple of Nuestra Se√±ora de la Pe√±a de Francia. It was constructed between 1700 and 1740 and is the origin of this particular community in the municipality. The church was originally constructed to house an image of the Virgin Mary called \\"La Virgen de la Pe√±a de Francia,\\" which is one of only two brought to Mexico from Spain. The other is in Salamanca, Guanajuato. Those living around the church were not part of a named town, they were only known as \\"those who make charcoal.\\" People looking to locate this community were directed to the church of the community that made charcoal (and is the origin of the town's name). This Virgin is black, like charcoal, and over time, many miracles became attributed to her. For this reason, this image was hidden by the local people for many years in fear that the authorities would take it from them. Today, however, she is plainly on display at the main altar. The church itself is a typical one for the early 18th century and reminiscent of Romantic style. In 1904, Crisp√≠n Montiel painted the cupola of the church with Biblical personages. The large trees on the church property date back to the founding of the municipality. To the side of the church is the Luisa Isabel Campos de Jim√©nez Cant√∫ Municipal Park, which contains an open-air Greek-style theatre, surrounded by pine trees. Across from the church is the main town plaza called Plaza Hidalgo, which was built and named in 1906 in preparation for the upcoming centennial of Mexico's Independence. The kiosk in the center was the site of the town's fountain, which used to provide potable water for the community. The kiosk contains the tourist information center for the municipality. The plaza was remodeled during town renovation work in the 1960s and 1970s, which is when the current palms and giant eucalyptus trees were planted. Casa de Cultura Dr. Jorge Jim√©nez Cant√∫ Aside from the church, the plaza is surrounded by the old and new municipal palaces, a number of residential structures with shops on the ground floors. The old municipal building site is now the Casa de Cultura Dr. Jorge Jim√©nez Cant√∫. The original municipal palace was built at the end of the 17th century and was of Neoclassical architecture. By 1926, the old building had deteriorated enough to warrant demolition. A new, two-story building was constructed and inaugurated in 1931. This center contains the municipality library, an auditorium and a continuing education center. Due to its traditional architecture and surrounding scenery, the town was included as one of the Pueblos con Encanto (Towns with Charm) program of the State of Mexico. The town has been actively seeking to take advantage of it, advertising itself as such and participating in the Pueblos con Encanto Bicentenario (Bicentennial Towns with Charm) program in preparation for Mexico Bicentennial of Independence in 2010. Other communities in the municipality While the town of Villa del Carbon is the largest community in the municipality, it is not the oldest. The oldest communities in the municipality are Cachihuapan, Taxhimay, Temanacoya y Zacapexco. Zacapexco is located to the West of the municipal seat and is old enough to be mentioned in the Huamantla Codex which was written in the 16th or 17th century as one of the Otom√≠ groups to have left the cave in Chiapan to settle on the Zacatepexco Hill. The name Zacatepexco is from Nahuatl meaning \\"where there is a staw bed.\\" Another ancient community is the village of Taxhimay, located North of the municipal seat. Its name come from Otom√≠ and means \\"pasture of white sheep,\\" as it is one of the few areas in the municipality with significant pasture land. To the north of this community is the Taxhimay Hacienda, which was owned by a major textile family from Tepeji del R√≠o. In 1931, the Taxhimay Dam was built near here, which completely inundated the small village of San Luis de las Peras. This hacienda provided the space to the villages resettlement. The oldest communities of this municipality are of Otom√≠ or Nahua ethnicity. The Otom√≠ arrived to this area first and their most representative villages are Taxhimay, Piequexhim√≥ and San Lorenzo Pueblo Nuevo. The later Nahua villages are represented by Cachihuapan, San Luis An√°huac, Temanacoya and Xajay. Both sets of communities retain many of their cultural roots. There is a story that when the communities of San Luis Taxhimay (Otom√≠) and San Luis An√°huac (Nahua) were being \\"refounded\\" as Spanish colonial villages, there was a dispute between them as to who should become the custodian of which of two saint images: one of Saint Louis, King of France and one of Our Lord of Lament. The story states that the dispute was finally settled by a coin toss, with the first image going to San Luis An√°huac and the latter to San Luis Taxhimay. Geography and climate The municipality of Villa del Carb√≥n is located in the north of Mexico State, northwest of Mexico City. Much of the territory consists of rugged hills and mountains, with the high point being Cerro de la Bufa, at 3,600 meters above sea level. These hills and mountains join with the Sierra de Tepotzotl√°n to the east. These mountains here are known at the Sierra de Monte Alto. These mountains are covered in conifer forests and account for 58% of the municipality. Semi-arid rolling hills cover 34% and only about 9% is flat land, generally found in small isolated patches. The high altitude of between 2,300 and 3,600 meters gives the municipality a temperate climate, with freezing temperatures not uncommon in the winter. The highlands have a wet climate, while the lower hills can be semi-arid. Significant winds are present in much of the municipality. The relatively abundant rains at the high elevations give rise to a large number of small fresh-water springs, which create small streams that eventually join into the municipality's four rivers: the San Jeronimo, Las Animas, Los Sabios and El Oro. There is one other \\"river\\" called the \\"R√≠o Seco\\" (Dry River) which flows only during the rainy season. Most of the bodies of water here have been created by the El Llano, Taxhimay, Benito Ju√°rez and Molinitos Dams, with only one natural lake called Santa Catarina. History Early human settlement in the Villa del Carb√≥n area is demonstrated by cave paintings at a rock shelter located near the San Jeronimo River. The first known ethnicity to settle here are the Otom√≠, who called this area \\"N√±onthe\\" (top of the hill) Evidence of their early occupation is found in the way of primitive ceramic and human and animal figurines. These Otom√≠ would be joined by other nomadic groups, who eventually synthesized their language and mythology. As they did so, this area became known as the Otom√≠ region of Chiapan, which rough correlates with the modern-day municipalities of Villa del Carb√≥n and Chapa de Mota. This region, along with neighboring Xillotepec (today Jilotepec) had significant influence in the early Mesoamerican world, as it was located where commercial traffic between Tula and Teotihuacan passed. This would lead to a number of fortifications and other structures. Remains of these can be found today such as the fortifications at Ca√±ada and Taxhimay, the ceremonial mound at El Mogote and a highly deteriorated and overgrown set of buildings known as Iglesias Viejas (Old Churches). The oldest currently existing communities are still Otom√≠ in character. This is because unlike their early neighbors, the Mazahuas and the Matlatzincas, the Otom√≠ favored areas with rugged terrain, so they dominated this area until about the 12th century. Later, Nahua people would come and settle in the area. By the 15th century, however, the Aztecs (a Nahua people) would dominate this area, making the Otom√≠ a tributary people. This would end with the Spanish Conquest of the Aztec Empire in the early 16th century. In the late 16th century, a number of Spanish families began renting lands from local chiefs here on which to raise cattle and sheep. These ranches would lead to more Spanish immigration to the area, who intermarried with the local population. During most of the colonial period, until 1714, the Chiapan area remained intact as an entity. In 1714, the area was split in what are now roughly the municipalities of Chapa de Mota and Villa del Carb√≥n. At that time, however, the community which is now the municipal seat was only known by through its church as the \\"Congregation of Santa Mar√≠a de la Pe√±a de Francia.\\" Later in the colonial period the community also became known as a major supplier of charcoal to surrounding communities such as San Pedro Atzcapotzaltongo, Mag√∫, Ca√±ada de Cisneros and even Mexico City. This activity gave it the moniker of \\"Villa Nueva del Carb√≥n de nuestra Se√±ora Santa Mar√≠a de la Pe√±a de Francia\\" (New Village of Charcoal of Our Lady of Holy Mary of the Hill of France. It also gave rise to a number of legends. In order to identify the community, one would be directed to the Villa Nueva, en donde hacen carbon\\" (the New Village, where they make charcoal), which eventually led to the place being marked on maps simply as \\"El Carb√≥n\\" and verbally, the phrase became contracted to Villa del Carb√≥n. When the Mexican War of Independence broke out in 1810, Villa del Carbon and the surrounding communities did not immediately join in with Miguel Hidalgo's cause. Support came after the nearby Battle of Monte de las Cruces in 1810, which Hidalgo won. After that, many from here decided to join Hidalgo's army. One notable participant from the municipal seat is Jos√© Manuel Correa, aka, Jos√© Mar√≠a Correa who fought with Pino, Arriaga, and Chito Villagr√°n and defeating the royalist commander Andrade en Venta Hermosa in 1811. In the years immediately following Independence, this municipality suffered from the lack of political stability, which led to high crime rates, especially highway robbery. The rugged terrain here was ideal for these marauders to prey upon travelers and protect themselves from authorities. Finally in 1834, President Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna ordered Commander Francisco de Medina Troncoso y Ruizg√≥mez to the region to combat the bandits, who had become extremely brazen. These forces fought with the bandits at their fortifications around Villa del Carbon, managing to overrun them in five days. In celebration, the bells of the church of Villa del Carb√≥n rang out. Another important event in the history of Villa del Carb√≥n is the arrival of the captured Melchor Ocampo in 1861 to be imprisoned at the Los Fresnos House. Later, he was transferred to Tepeji del R√≠o, Hidalgo, where he was eventually executed. During the French Intervention in 1863, Villa del Carb√≥n sided with the Maximilian, forming a regiment led by Colonel Patricio Garnada to fight for the emperor. The municipal seat was burned later in 1863 by Cuellar, including the priest's house. During the Mexican Revolution, there is some evidence that the town had recurrent problems the Liberation Army of the South, such as the severing of telegraph lines. During the Cristero War, the town lost one of its leaders in 1928. In 1931, the town was electrified and was reached by its first highway, connecting the municipal seat to San Mart√≠n Cachihuapan. In this same year, the new municipal palace, zocalo and municipal park were built. The municipal palace's clock was installed in 1943. In the 1920s and 1930s a number of ejidos such as San Lorenzo el Viejo, San Luis Anahua and Monte de Pe√±a were created. Economy =Tourism= Tourism is the major source of income for the municipality, based on its natural resources. The various small streams fed by fresh-water springs converge into four rivers in the territory. These rivers were dammed in the first half of the 20th century, originally for agricultural purposes but they have become an important source of tourism, including ecotourism revenue. There are four main dams that attract tourists: Taxhimay, El Llano, Molinitos and Benito Ju√°rez. These dams offer a number of activities, such as mountain biking, hiking, rappelling, swimming, jet skiing, kayaking, canoeing, sailing and sport fishing, especially for trout. Accommodations here include tent and RV camping facilities and rustic cabins. The largest and most important dam economically is the Taxhimay Dam. It was constructed in 1934, flooding the valley and covering the small community of San Lu√≠s de las Peras, leaving only the church tower and part of the cupola visible above the water. Canoe tours to visit the tower and cupola are available. In addition to offering the activities listed above, it also hosts the annual XTERRA Triathlon. The El Llano Dam is 20 km from the town of Villa del Carb√≥n and is located within a state park, which is also part of the Zacapexco ejido. The area has a relatively cold climate and the dam is surrounded by conifer forests. This area hosts the \\"Extremetour\\" event organized by Raid Mexico . It also boasts a cabin large enough to accommodate twenty people. Two smaller dams, the Benito Ju√°rez and Molinitos are still primarily also offer many activities but on a smaller scale. Trout has become an important economic resource. The large number of rivers and streams that feed into dams have created places to fish for trout as well as trout-farming. In locations like the Taxhimay Dam, boat rentals for fishing include cooking what you catch. Trout-farms raise and sell the fish to locales inside and outside of Villa del Carb√≥n. There are also a number of restaurants dedicated to cuisine based on trout and other forest products. These restaurants are mostly located were rivers run near the highways to Mexico City and Atlacomulco. Female participants in charreada In and around the municipal seat, charreada is a major part of the local culture and competitions here have gone national. The main sponsor of these events is the Villa de Carb√≥n Charreada Association, which has gained statues in the charreada world over the years. This association now hosts national-level competitions at the Lienzo Charro Cornielio Nieto, located just outside the town of Villa del Carb√≥n. One particular group of note is the Escaramuza Charra (a group of twelve women who perform choreographed equine displays). This group has placed in the top three in many regional and national-level competitions and placed fifth in the national championships of 2005. Villa del Carb√≥n main charreada events take place on March 10 (founding of the municipality), September 16 (Mexican Independence) and December 8 (Feast day of the patron saint of Villa del Carb√≥n). On these days, the events are accompanies by musical events, dances, craft expositions and regional cuisine. =Handcrafts= With ranches and charreadas an important part of Villa de Carb√≥n's history and culture, crafts related to these, especially leather-making and leather products. Principal goods made are boots, leather jackets, hats and other items related to the needs of horsemen. Crafts-production employs significant percentage of the municipality's residents. The most important item produced here is called \\"botines,\\" which is a kind of ankle-high boot associated with charreada. Villa del Carb√≥n is one of the last locations in Mexico to be a significant producer of this footwear and they are exported to many locations in the country. Another craft practiced here is the making of knit items such as scarves, ponchos, wraps, sweaters,etc. These are mostly available at the tianguis (temporary market) that pops up on weekends at Plaza Hidalgo in the town center. Lastly, the town also has a number of \\"rompope\\" (a sweet egg liqueur) producers. Rompope was brought to Mexico by Spanish friars and its production here originated with the monasteries they established. Over time, however, its production fell into secular hands.

At in elevation, it is the highest point in Chelan County, and the highest non-volcanic peak in Washington and the Cascade Range as a whole. Bonanza Peak's prominence is , making it the 26th most prominent peak in Washington. The nearest higher peak is Glacier Peak, to the southwest. Bonanza Peak is flanked with three large glaciers: Company Glacier to the north, Mary Green Glacier to the east, and Isella Glacier to the south.USGS topographic maps accessed from USGS GNIS website History Bonanza Peak was originally named North Star Mountain, with a minor mountain to the southwest given the name Bonanza Peak. The USGS‚Äô first topographic map of the region in 1904, however, mistakenly interchanged the names and the USGS naming was retained. Bonanza Peak was first summited in 1937 by Curtis I. James, Barrie James, and Joe Leuthold, all members of the Mazamas. Climate Lying east of the Cascade crest, the area around Bonanza Peak is a bit drier than areas to the west. Summers can bring warm temperatures and occasional thunderstorms. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Precipitation runoff from the mountain and meltwater from its glaciers drains to nearby Lake Chelan via Agnes, Company, and Railroad Creeks, Geology Martin Peak at Bonanza (right), and Glacier Peak. The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. These climate differences lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. Glacier Peak, a stratovolcano that is southwest of Bonanza Peak, began forming in the mid- Pleistocene.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

It was located north of Doyle, roughly at the location of present-day Herlong. It was named after David Rayl, who built a hotel/store at the site in 1915. The location was the junction between the Western Pacific Railway and the ill- fated narrow gauge Nevada-California-Oregon Railway (NCO), and Rayl, in addition to constructing the hotel, filed claims for and persuaded the postal service to name the post office after himself, rather than, as preferred by the railroad, Hackstaff (the family name of a relative of the company president). In 1917, Rayl tried to persuade the senators from California to establish a training base at the site, and while the proposal was supported by the surrounding states, it was not accepted. At about the same time, the NCO sold the right-of-way south of the junction to the Western Pacific, which took up the track and relaid it to standard gauge. In the fall of 1920, Rayl leased his business to one Cyrus Helman, who also became assistant postmaster. This relationship led to strife in 1922 when Rayl found accounting discrepancies with the postal receipts; he also had sold the goods in the store to Helman, but had received only half of the payment due. A lawsuit ensued, whose outcome is unclear: in the end it was dismissed by the court in 1930 because a trial date had never been set. In the meantime, the post office was renamed to Hackstaff in 1922, but it closed the same year. This was also the year when the NCO ended service between Rayl and Wendel and the Western Pacific moved its crews to Doyle. Rayl held on to the property until 1942, when it he sold it for $1,000 for the construction of the Sierra Army Depot.

He was the son of a carpenter and a pawnbroker from St Giles in the Fields, and was educated at Westminster School between 1715 and 1721 thanks to the help of Zachary Pearce. On 10 June 1721 he matriculated to Trinity College, Cambridge, graduating with a BA in 1724. He became a fellow of Trinity College in 1727, and a member of Gray's Inn the same year. Clarke was evidently knowledgeable in Roman law, and was mentioned in a poem called the causidicade as a possible Solicitor General in 1742.Foss (1870) p.167 He became a King's Counsel (KC) in 1740, and in 1742 left Gray's Inn to join Lincoln's Inn, which he became a bencher of in 1754. In 1747 he was elected a Member of Parliament for St Michael's, and in 1754 was returned for Lostwithiel. After the death of the Master of the Rolls, Sir John Strange, Clarke was offered the position. The job was originally offered to William Murray, later Lord Mansfield, but he turned it down. If he had accepted, Clarke might instead have succeeded Murray as Attorney General for England and Wales. Clarke was officially appointed on 25 May 1754, and was knighted at the same time. In June 1754 he was invested as a Privy Councillor (PC). Clarke evidently discharged his duties \\"with great credit\\" for ten years, until his death in office on 13 November 1764. He was buried in the Rolls Chapel, now the main library of King's College London. Clarke was a close friend of the Earl of Macclesfield, and this friendship combined with his unclear parentage started rumours that Clark was in fact Macclesfield's son. In his will, Clarke left his Flitcroft-designed home,Colvin (2008) p.382. Branch Hill Lodge, to Macclesfield.

There were accusations of intense Hinduphobia along with the racist hate crimes. Rallies were organised in Melbourne and Sydney, and intense media coverage of the perceived hate crimes commenced in India, which were mostly critical of Australian and Victorian Police. The Australian government initially called for calm as it began an investigation into the crimes. In June 2009, the Victoria Police Chief Commissioner, Simon Overland, stated that some of the crimes were racist and hinduphobic in nature, and others were opportunistic. A subsequent Indian Government investigation concluded that, of 152 reported assaults against Indian students in Australia that year, 23 involved racial overtones. Background Indian students were at the time and are currently the second largest group of international students studying at a tertiary level in Australia. From 2004 to 2009 the number of Indians studying in Australia rose from 30,000 to 97,000 with 45,000 of these living in Melbourne, 32,000 in Adelaide and the remainder shared between Sydney, Brisbane and Perth. Some students come from rural areas in India, with most coming to Australia to seek permanent residency and citizenship. According to a 2009 government survey, 70% of foreign students want permanent Australian residency. To qualify for residency, International graduates must be offered a job that uses their degree. In 2009 the percentage of International students granted residency was, NSW:41%, Victoria:37% and SA:5% (South Australia has a larger number of domestic graduates seeking work compared to other states). South Australia is the only state that has a program to help students find work. --Source:The Advertiser 19 September 2009 Page 5.

A member of the NSW upper house, Gordon Moyes, cited changing victim demographics for the suburb, \\"What has happened over the last few years is that a number of Indian students, attracted by fairly cheap accommodation, have come into the area, the target - always the soft targets - moved from elderly people walking on the street to Indian students with laptops.Harris Park violence 'going on for years' Sydney Morning Herald 10 June 2009.

New South Wales Police have stated that Indians are not over represented in Australian crime statistics.; ABC News, Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 8 June 2009 This view was supported by Sydney-based United India Association president Dr Prabhat Sinha, who took the view that the attacks were not necessarily racially motivated. He said: \\"They become soft targets by groups of four to six drug users, for example, who just want cash.\\"Bhandari N Indian students in Australia attacked DNA, Mumbai, 10 November 2006 The Victorian State Premier, John Brumby, has stated that internal police statistics show that Indians are not over represented in assaults. However, according to the Police Commissioner, Simon Overland, people belonging to a broad statistical category of \\"South Asian appearance\\" (which includes Indians) are over represented in robberies. In either case, the Victorian police refuse to release these statistics to public scrutiny, the stated reason being that they are \\"problematic: as well as 'subjective and open to interpretation'\\". Newspaper columnist Greg Sheridan said that Victorian Premier John Brumby was in \\"indolent denialism\\" regarding these incidents by saying that \\"Assaults on Indian students are under-represented as a population share.\\" According to Sheridan, the Victorian Police had initially denied gathering statistics on crime by ethnicity, then reversed that and said they did collate such statistics, but said that they were unreliable. Sheridan was concerned that there was also systematic under-reporting of all crime in Victoria as claimed in the Victorian Ombudsman report \\"Crime Statistics and Police Numbers\\". =Educational, policing and safety issues= An editorial in the Geelong Advertiser suggested that education institutions should take more consideration of safeguarding student safety, and other factors including inadequate policing numbers and liquor licensing should be addressed. The Ministerial Council on Education, Employment, Training and Youth Affairs said it would conduct a national quality crackdown on education and training providers, in particular smaller education providers that have been the target of student complaints. The People's Republic of China has also expressed concern over student safety in Australia.Aid Sought for Students,Crikey wrap: Indian press on Australia‚Äôs racism According to official figures, more than 130,000 Chinese students are currently studying in Australia. New Zealand has responded to these attacks and subsequent incidents. The education sector in New Zealand has moved to distance itself from attacks on Indian students, saying they were \\"totally different societies\\". The Chief Executive of the New Zealand Education Trust, Robert Stevens, has stressed to prospective students from India that New Zealand \\"is a different country from Australia - in the nicest possible way\\", and is striving to market New Zealand to Indians in this manner.We're different, New Zealand tells Indian studentsOz Racial Attacks:NZ tries to lure Indian students Education authorities in New Zealand are hoping recent attacks on Indian students in Australia will make New Zealand a more attractive option.Indian students 'safe in New Zealand', news.com.au =Need for a mechanism to prevent attacks on Indians abroad= Domestically, the Indian government declared that it would formulate a policy to deal with racial discrimination against Indians abroad. As part of the initiative to create an institutionalised mechanism to prevent racist attacks on Indians abroad, Vayalar Ravi, the head of the overseas Indian affairs ministry, has been tasked to protect the Indians in Australia. Ravi has called for a report on these incidents from the Indian High Commission in Australia.Vayalar Ravi takes charge of overseas Indian affairs ministry  Aftermath  There was a 46% drop in Indians applying for student visas for Australia from July to 31 October 2009 compared to the same period in 2008, and a total drop of 26% in student visa applications to Australia from all countries (including India). A study (completed before the deaths of Nitin Garg and Ranjodh Singh) forecast a 20% drop in Indian students expected to study in Australia in 2010, compared to 2009, partly due to a reduction in the number of visas allowed to be granted, stiffening of the regulations associated with them, the strength of the Australian dollar, and a clampdown on unscrupulous migration agents and colleges. After the attacks of 2009 and the deaths in Jan 2010, its expected to fall even further than the 20% drop. In response, Victorian police were given new powers to conduct stop-and-search operations without the need for warrants. The former head of its elite Special Air Service (SAS) regiment and current National Security Adviser, Duncan Lewis, was charged with leading a taskforce to examine the attacks on Indian students. Lewis chaired the task force‚Äôs first meeting and coordinated Australia‚Äôs response to the assaults. The Victorian government is considering enacting hate crime legislation that would consider prejudicial motivation as a factor in sentencing.Ex-SAS head to lead response to Indian attacks = Bollywood reaction = Bollywood's largest labour union declared that its members would refuse to work in Australia until attacks on Indian students there are stopped.Bollywood union boycotts Australia over attacks Dinesh Chaturvedi, the general secretary of the Federation of Western India Cine Employees Association, has declared that their associates have been instructed not to shoot films in Australia as \\"the situation is not normal over there\\".Bollywood says NO to Australia, Rediff.com In response to the issue, Bollywood star Amitabh Bachchan turned down an honorary doctorate from the Queensland University of Technology. Fellow Indian actor, Aamir Khan, has condemned the attacks, stating that, \\"[It is] most disturbing to hear about racist attacks on Indians living in Australia. Quite a shame. While this doesn't mean that all Australians are racists, the frequency and seriousness of such attacks, I think, calls for an extra ordinary reaction from the Australian authorities, and while we want action to be taken by authorities in Australia, equally we should remember all the various crimes against foreigners who visit India.\\" = Student numbers = Overall, the number of foreign students coming to Australia over the period 2009-2011 declined. Factors included; a steep rise in the value of the Australian dollar, decreasing the country's attractiveness relative to its main competitors in Britain and the United States; a tightening of government regulation of the education and of visa requirements contributed to this decline; and reported concerns over safety. An Australian Council for Educational Research study found higher education visas for Indian students fell from 34,200 in 2007-08 to 9750 in 2011-12.The Age In 2010, Federation of Indian Students in Australia (FISA) says that 30,000 Indian students have left Australia in the last year, and claims \\"race attacks is one of the major reasons behind the exodus. Other significant factors include that there are no jobs and students can't survive without that. Denying permanent residency to many Indians despite fulfilment of conditions has also been a reason.\\". The number of applications for student visas by Indians rose from 4000 in 2011 to 7700 in 2012 but there was a downturn on successful applications. = Safety of international students research project = In order to establish reliable statistics for the examination of the safety of international students, the Australian Institute of Criminology is undertaking a research project on the safety of international students living in Australia. The project is intended to compare the rate of crime against international students with the rate of crime against the broader Australian population. The Australian Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC) is releasing data to Australian police jurisdictions and the Australian Institute of Criminology as part of a data- matching exercise which will enable identification of international students who have been victims of crime (Australian police jurisdictions do not collect statistics on victims' citizenship or visa status). = Crimes Against International Students Report by the Australian Institute of Criminology = In 2011, the Australian Institute of Criminology released a study entitled Crimes Against International Students:2005-2009. This found that over the period 2005-2009, international students were less likely to be assaulted than the average person in Australia. Indian students experienced an average assault rate in some jurisdictions, but overall they experienced lower assault rates than the Australian average. = Indian immigration to Australia = As of 2012 the number of Indians migrating to Australia has increased to such an extent that Indians are now the most numerous nationality moving to Australia per year, overtaking China and the UK.

Biography The initial members of the band were seven friends who first met via the indie-centric Bowlie internet message board, and came together as a band after a request by Martin Hall for bandmates into Mogwai, The Libertines, Snow Patrol and Yeah Yeah Yeahs. Although none of the potential members were fans of those bands, common ground was found in the likes of Belle & Sebastian, The Wedding Present, Pulp, New Order, Dexys Midnight Runners and XTC. These influences were absorbed into the band's sound, and exemplified by the use of two lead vocalists in John Waring and Sharon Leach, as well as the unusual inclusion of two keyboards along with two guitars and a rhythm section and (initially) saxophone. After a brief period of rehearsal as a septet, Jessica Shaw left the band (later to resurface in as drummer/ bass player in Give It Ups), and the remaining six members played their debut set at The Pleasure Unit in July 2005. With all members of the band able to play more than one instrument, early gigs were marked by onstage instrument-swapping between songs, and Andrew Newman's home-made synthesiser sound, best heard on early recordings Cat Hits Car and Blackpool. Their debut 7\\" single \\"Shiftwork\\" b/w Cat Hits Car was released on their own Barryland Records in 2006, attracting critical acclaim. The single was ignored by mainstream radio due to the opening word of the song being profanity, but gained many plays on internet and student radio, most notably on Rachael Neiman's show on Dandelion Radio. Around this time, they also released the song \\"Blackpool\\" on The Kids At The Club, a popular compilation of up-and- coming bands put together for How Does It Feel To Be Loved Records. Dan Morton left the band in early 2006 (although he continued to make occasional appearances as an additional percussionist at gigs), and was replaced by Kerry Edmonds, a gifted drummer also proficient in keyboards and guitar. With this lineup, the band recorded the bulk of their debut album at Soup Studios in London, under the auspices of Simon Trought (ex-Tompaulin). The band also undertook tours, supporting the likes of Cannonball Jane, The Loves, Saturday Looks Good To Me, Great Lakes and Ladybug Transistor. Kerry Edmonds eventually left the group at the end of 2006, followed shortly after by Andrew Newman in May 2007. The band recruited former drummer for The Scaramanga Six James Agnew as a replacement from Kerry Edmonds, but decided not to replace Andrew Newman and to continue as a quintet in an effort to streamline their live sound (but restricting their between-song instrument-swapping forays in the process). This lineup of the band endured for the remainder of the band's lifetime, with Agnew adding more multi-instrumental capabilities, further songwriting contributions and a third lead vocal. Following on from performing at the inaugural Indietracks Festival in 2007, Cherryade Records agreed release the band's debut album Sex With Strangers in 2008 as well as offering an appearance on the label's annual A Very Cherry Christmas compilation, which featured \\"Diamond White Christmas\\". By the time the album was released in July 2008, most of the recordings were nearly two years old, from a previous lineup, and the band had begun recording new tracks in their current guise. There was little activity during 2008 due to outside commitments, but still saw the release of split 10\\" single with Wintergreen and a further appearance on the Very Cherry Christmas release, this time Perfect Christmas Snow (Perfect Christmas Kiss) (featuring lead vocals from John, Sharon and James), for which the band received their highest critical notices yet. A further split single followed in February 2009, this time on Cloudberry Records, with The Pale Corners. The track Berry Buck Mills Stipe was premiered in a live video on YouTube in early 2008, which led to the band's signing to Universal Records in The Philippines. 2009 also saw James and Sharon (along with Spearmint guitarist James Parsons and Scritti Politti's Rhodri Marsden) release the album 'Now I'm The Big Sister' as tELLEY. For live appearances, the band also featured Thom on bass. Following on from an acclaimed appearance on a recent Bruce Springsteen tribute album, the band confirmed a further appearance on an upcoming Jonathan Richman tribute album released by Fortuna Pop! Records, covering \\"Pablo Picasso\\". During February 2010, the band created an entirely new album as part of the 2010 RPM Challenge, with plans to release it as a download-only effort, whilst continuing work on the follow-up to Sex With Strangers. The first full release on Cherryade Records since Sex With Strangers, an EP entitled \\"There's Been A Murder\\" was released on 6 April 2010. Lead track \\"Taggart\\" was premiered on Tom Robinson's BBC 6 Music Introducing show in January 2010. Following a final album, and a support slot with long-term influence The Features, the band split in 2011. Thom Allott, Sharon Leach and Dan Morton all later joined indie band A Fine Day For Sailing, while James Agnew (now on guitar and lead vocals), John Waring and Thom Allott (later replaced by Martin Hall) reconvened as The Horses of Instruction (also featuring Jake Chivers, former drummer for A Fine Day For Sailing).

(1608 feet) deep.(BC Parks, 2011). Exploration Arctomys Cave was discovered in 1911, and first reported in the Canadian Alpine Journal in 1912 by mountaineer A.O. Wheeler who, accompanied by Conrad Kain, Byron Harmon George Kinney and 'Curly' Phillips, had descended to a waterfall at a depth of about 80 metres, stating that: \\"Beyond that the going is wet and the exploration was not carried further, as there was no change in the character of the subterranean shaft.\\" There is no record of subsequent visitation until 1971 - 1973 when cavers from the McMaster University Climbing and Caving Club, Guelph University Caving Club, Alberta Speleological Society and some visiting British cavers explored and surveyed the cave to its maximum depth of -522 metres. Passages above the entrance were surveyed by British and Canadian cavers in 1983 resulting in the current vertical range of 536 metres. Arctomys Cave was the deepest known cave in Canada for many years, until surpassed by Bisaro Anima Cave in 2017 with its depth of 670 metres. Characteristics Arctomys Cave is formed in the steeply-dipping Mural Formation limestone of the Early Cambrian Gog Group. The top half of the cave (The Endless Climb) descends relatively steeply, but at a depth of about 400 metres the cave becomes more horizontal with several pools, and ends at a sump. Despite its great depth, the cave includes only five pitches up to 15m deep. Although most of the cave is undecorated, the Straw Gallery has flowstone and relatively long soda straws. Accident in 1991 Arctomys Cave is the site of Canada's most extensive cave rescue attempt. On October 17, 1991, Rick Blak, an experienced caver and park ranger at Mount Robson Provincial Park, was struck by a falling boulder deep in the cave and perished. 110 people were involved in the complex recovery of his body.

The legislation was promulgated by Juan √Ålvarez Mendiz√°bal, who was briefly prime minister under Queen Isabel II of Spain. The aims of the legislation were varied. Some of its impulses were fostered by the anticlerical liberal factions engaged in a civil war with Carlist and other reactionary forces. The government wished to use the land to encourage the enterprises of small-land owning middle class, since much of the land was thought of as underused by monastic orders. The government, which refused to compensate the church for the properties, saw this as a source of income. Finally, wealthy noble and other families took advantage of the legislation to increase their holdings. Ultimately, the desamortizaci√≥n led to the vacating of most of the ancient monasteries in Spain, which had been occupied by the various convent orders for centuries. Some of the expropriations were reversed in subsequent decades, as happened at Santo Domingo de Silos, but these re- establishments were relatively few. Some of the secularised monasteries are in a reasonably good state of preservation, for example the Valldemossa Charterhouse; others are ruined, such as San Pedro de Arlanza.

Plot The novel is set in the Landes, a sparsely populated area of south-west France covered largely with pine forests. As it opens, a court case is being dismissed. The main character, the titular Th√©r√®se, has been tried for poisoning her husband Bernard by overdosing him with Fowler's Solution, a medicine containing arsenic. Despite strong evidence against her, including prescriptions she forged, the case has been dropped; the family closed ranks to prevent scandal and Bernard himself testified in her defence. On the journey home, Th√©r√®se reflects at length on her life so far, trying to understand what brought her to continue poisoning her husband after she observed him taking an accidental overdose. She suggests that her actions were part of an \\"imperceptible slope\\", caused in part by the pressures of motherhood and marriage and the stifling life of a Catholic landowner's wife in 1920s rural France. However, neither Th√©r√®se nor the narrator provides a clear explanation for her behaviour. Th√©r√®se assumes that she will be able to leave her husband quietly now that the case is over. Instead, Bernard announces that she is to live at his family house, in an isolated spot in the pine forest, at Argelouse. He effectively confines her there, giving out that she suffers from a nervous complaint, and making the occasional public appearance with her to quell any gossip. His concern is that the forthcoming marriage of his younger sister Anne, to a suitor approved by the family, is not prevented by any scandal. He allows Th√©r√®se no company other than unsympathetic servants, keeps their daughter away from her, and threatens to send her to prison for the poisoning if she does not cooperate. Th√©r√®se lives mainly on wine and cigarettes, falls into a passive stupor and takes to her bed. When she is ordered to attend a dinner party for Anne, her fianc√© and his family, she does so, but her emaciated appearance shocks the guests. Bernard decides that the scandal will never be fully forgotten unless Th√©r√®se is allowed to disappear without controversy. He promises she can leave after Anne's wedding, and moves back to Argelouse to supervise her recovery. The wedding over, he takes Th√©r√®se to Paris and bids her farewell. There will be no official separation and no divorce, and she has an allowance to live on. She is free to go. Analysis The book is characterised by some unusual structural devices, including a long internal monologue which often switches perspective, revealing the thoughts of several characters. The vast majority of characters in the book are seen as quite unpleasant people; Th√©r√®se's father is revealed to be a callous sexist more concerned with protecting his political career than looking after his daughter, while Bernard himself is portrayed as an emotionally unavailable man obsessed solely with hunting and serving the needs of the family. As in much of Mauriac's work, physical imperfection signifies moral destitution and most characters have some sort of flaw ‚Äì phrases such as \\"hard black nails\\", \\"short bow legs\\" and \\"fat little Hippolitus\\" all describe various male characters, just within the first few chapters. Th√©r√®se herself is proud of her intelligence and self-perceived wisdom, as well as apparently having an unrequited crush on former childhood friend and sister-in-law Anne ‚Äì at one point destroying a love letter from Anne to a local Jewish man. Critics have suggested that this could parallel with Mauriac's own struggles with sexuality. Mauriac commented on the novel's structure in an interview in The Paris Review in 1953. He said: \\" ... in Th√©r√®se Desqueyroux I used some devices that came from the silent films; lack of preparation, the sudden opening, flashbacks. They were methods that were new and surprising at that time\\".Fran√ßois Mauriac, The Art of Fiction No. 2, The Paris Review, March 1953. Accessed 4 December 2010 Sequels The character of Th√©r√®se recurs in other works by Mauriac, including The End of the Night, Th√©r√®se and the Doctor and Th√©r√®se at the Hotel. Development history In 1925, Mauriac asked his brother Pierre for documents about the trial in Bordeaux, in 1906, of Madame Canaby, who had attempted to poison her husband. She was acquitted, but convicted of forging prescriptions. Literary significance and reception The novel is Mauriac's best known work, and was described as \\"outstanding\\" in the biography that accompanied his Nobel Literature Prize citation.Nobel Lectures, Literature 1901‚Äì1967, Editor Horst Frenz, Elsevier Publishing Company, Amsterdam, 1969. Accessed 29 November 2010 On 3 June 1950 Le Figaro named it as one of the winners of the \\"Grand Prix des meilleurs romans du demi-si√®cle\\", a prestigious literary competition to find the twelve best French novels of the first half of the twentieth century. Nominations were judged by a distinguished French literary jury chaired by Colette, and the winners were included the following year in a specially published and illustrated collection. In 1999 it came 35th in a national poll to find the 100 best French works of the 20th century. Mauriac also attracted negative criticism. Jean-Paul Sartre famously attacked his work in 1939, accusing him of denying his characters free will and, like God, imposing external fates and moral judgements on them. He singled out the character of Th√©r√®se Desqueyroux as an example of this; Mauriac had recently published The End of the Night, stating in its preface that he wished to \\"save\\" Th√©r√®se, prompting Sartre's attack.Sartre, J.-P., \\"M. Fran√ßois Mauriac et la libert√©\\", Nouvelle revue Fran√ßaise, February, 1939 Adaptations The novel was filmed as Th√©r√®se Desqueyroux by Georges Franju in 1962, with Emmanuelle Riva as Th√©r√®se.Th√©r√®se Desqueyroux (Character).

The approach has been developed based on the theoretical work of George Herbert Mead and Mikhail Mikhailovich Bakhtin. Overview Dialogism makes several assumptions.(Linell, 2009). It assumes that human communication entails the interaction of diverse perspectives and is embedded in a socio- historical context, that the meaning of a communication can be different to the various participants, that it is important to examine the consequences of a communication, and that each participant in a communication is, to some degree, orienting to the orientation of the other. Dialogical analysis is an interpretative methodology which closely analyzes spoken or written utterances or actions for their embedded communicative significance. Questions typically asked during a dialogical analysis include: What does each interactant think about themselves, the other and what the other thinks of them? What do the given utterances and actions imply about the given activity or participants? Why was a given communicative act performed - why did it need to be said? What was the alternative that the utterance was trying to dispel? People are often borrowing words, phrases and ideas from other people, and accordingly, dialogical analysis often asks: who is doing the talking? Specifically, which voices and echoes are evident in the given utterance? Although dialogical analysis tends to focus on discourse, it is distinct from discourse analysis and conversation analysis because its focus goes beyond the question of how people speak and what they achieve by speaking. Dialogical analysis uses dialogue as a metaphor for understanding phenomena beyond communication itself, such as the self (see dialogical self), internal dialogues, self-talk, misunderstandings, trust and distrust,(Markova & Gillespie, 2007) the production of knowledge,(Jovchelovitch, 2008) and relations between groups in society. Recently there have been attempts to formalize the move from dialogism, which is often quite theoretical, to a systematic methodology for data analysis. These approaches focus upon 'sensitizing questions' that facilitate a dialogical analysis(\\"Gillespie & Cornish, 2014\\") and step-by-step procedures for analyzing multivoicedness.(\\"Aveling, Gillespie & Cornish 2015\\") See also * Dialogical self * Interfaith dialogue * Philosophy of dialogue References Further reading * Linell, P.

Herrmann chose unusual instrumentation for the film including violin, cello, and bass (all three electric), two theremin electronic instruments (played by Samuel Hoffman and Paul Shure), two Hammond organs, a large studio electric organ, three vibraphones, two glockenspiels, two pianos, two harps, three trumpets, three trombones, four tubas, and extensive percussion including cymbals and tam-tam.Score analysis by Bill Wrobel, on www.filmscorerundowns.net Unusual overdubbing and tape-reversal techniques were used, as well. 20th Century Fox later reused the Herrmann title theme in the original pilot episode for Irwin Allen's 1965 TV series Lost in Space. Danny Elfman noted The Day the Earth Stood Stills score inspired his interest in film composing, and made him a fan of Herrmann.  Remake soundtrack  Tyler Bates was brought in to compose the score for 2008 remake of The Day the Earth Stood Still after Derrickson heard his work on The Devil's Rejects and Slither. Bates decided that instead of imitating the original score by Bernard Herrmann he would try and convey the message of the new film, which was different, and assumed that most people would not even realize it was a remake. He said: The origins for the sound on the new score came from Bates attending the filming of a few scenes with Reeves and Smith. When he got back to Los Angeles he created a loop on his GuitarViol to which Derrickson responded \\"I think that‚Äôs the score!\\" when it was played for him. Taking just a piece of the original score, Bates utilized the theremin, which Herrmann heavily used for the original film. Bates and the theremin player he hired used the instrument in a manner reminiscent of a sound effect, especially during Klaatu's surgery.

Location Bounded roughly by Fort Street at the southeast end and Nuuanu Avenue at the northwest, its older, low-rise, brick and stone buildings, surrounded by contemporary, concrete high rises, serves as an open-air, human-scale architectural museum of the city's commercial development between the 1850s and the 1930s. Its architectural styles range from nondescript 19th-century commercial through Richardsonian Romanesque, Italianate, and Mission Revival. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. Directly to the north is Chinatown, another historic district. Notable buildings =Melchers (1854)= The earliest structure is Melchers Building at 51 Merchant Street, built in 1854 for the retail firm of Melchers and Reiner. Its original coral stone walls are no longer visible under its layers of stucco and paint, and it now houses city government offices, not private businesses. =Kamehameha V Post Office (1871)= The Kamehameha V Post Office at the corner of Merchant and Bethel Streets was the first building in Hawaii to be constructed entirely of precast concrete blocks reinforced with iron bars. It was built by J.G. Osborne in 1871 and the success of this new method was replicated on a much grander scale the next year in the royal palace, Alii≈çlani Hale. The old post office building was separately added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. =Bishop Bank (1878)= The Bishop Bank Building at 63 Merchant Street was the earliest of the Italianate (or Renaissance Revival) structures on the street, built in 1878 and designed by Thomas J. Baker (one of the architects of Iolani Palace). Its distinctive features include a corner entrance, arched windows and doors, fine masonry work, and brick pilasters below an ornamental cornice and parapet along the roofline, all of which are obscured to some extent by its current exterior of monotone white stucco. In 1925, Bishop Bank moved to much larger quarters along \\"Bankers Row\\" on Bishop Street, and later changed its name to First Hawaiian Bank, now one of the largest in the state. =T.R. Foster Building (1891)= The T.R. Foster Building at 902 Nuuanu Avenue was built by Thomas R. Foster, one of the founders (in 1882) of the Inter-Island Steam Navigation Company. In 1880, Foster had purchased the estate of the renowned botanist William Hillebrand (1821-1886), which was bequeathed to the city as Foster Botanical Garden at the death of his wife, Mary E. Foster (n√©e Robinson), in 1930. The architectural style of the two- story T.R. Foster Building resembles that of the one-story Royal Saloon Building across the street, which was built in 1890 on the site of a former corner bar. Both are modestly Italianate brick buildings, with pilasters, cornices, and balustrades along the streetside rooflines. The Royal Saloon ceased to be a bar during Prohibition, but both buildings were renovated during the 1970s and now house O'Toole's Irish Pub and Murphy's Bar & Grill. =Bishop Estate (1896)= The bare stone face of the tiny Bishop Estate Building at 71 Merchant Street is a fine example of the stolid Richardsonian Romanesque style that was popular when it was built in 1896. Its architects were Clinton Briggs Ripley and his junior partner, C.W. Dickey, a well- connected local boy with a fresh degree in architecture from M.I.T., and it initially housed the executive offices of not only the Bishop Estate, but also the Charles Reed Bishop Trust and the Bernice P. Bishop Museum. Constructed of dark lava from the Estate's own quarries, its notable features include arches above the lower door and window frames, four rough stone pilasters on the upper level, and a corniced parapet along the roofline. =Judd Building (1898)= The Judd Building at the corner of Merchant and Fort Streets combines elegant features of Italianate architecture with businesslike functionalism. Designed by Oliver G. Traphagen, newly arrived from Duluth, Minnesota, it boasted Hawaii's first passenger elevator when it opened in 1898. A fifth floor was added on top in the 1920s, the interior was remodeled in 1979, and the ground floor has also been reconfigured. However, the exterior of the middle three floors reflects Traphagen's original design, with arched windows, simulated keystones, and decorative wreaths and floral designs. Built on land that used to house the medical offices of Dr. Gerrit P. Judd,Wilcox, Gaylord (1972). Business and Buildings: Downtown Honolulu's Old Fashioned Block Hawaiian Journal of History 6:3-27. the new building served as the first headquarters of Alexander & Baldwin, and also of the Bank of Hawaii until 1927. The bank bought the building in 1998, and A&B; repurchased it in 2000. =Yokohama Specie Bank (1909)= Overseas branches of the Yokohama Specie Bank (Ê®™ÊµúÊ≠£ÈáëÈäÄË°å Yokohama Sh≈çkin Gink≈ç, est. 1880) were chartered to act as agents of Imperial Japan. The Honolulu branch was the first successful Japanese bank in Hawaii. The building at 36 Merchant Street dates from 1909 and was designed by one of Honolulu's most prolific architects, Henry Livingston Kerr, who considered it not just his own finest work, but the finest in the city at the time. The brick and steel structure is L-shaped, with a corner entrance and a courtyard in back. Its Italianate design includes a triumphal arch over the main door, copper window casings, glass wainscoting, marble trim, and paintings inside by a local artist. Bank personnel received Japanese-speaking, Chinese-speaking, and English-speaking customers in separate areas. On the day that Pearl Harbor was bombed, the building was taken over by the Alien Property Custodian, the first floor became a warehouse for confiscated possessions, and extra showers, toilets, and holding cells were installed in the basement to accommodate up to 250 drunken military personnel. The bank's former customers spent years trying to get their money back, and never managed to collect interest on their old deposits until the 1960s. The building was renovated in the 1980s by local restoration architect Spencer Leineweber and became home to Honolulu Magazine from 1982 to 2001. It currently serves as a preschool and childcare center. =Honolulu Police Station (1931)= The last significant old structure in the district was the old Honolulu Police Station at 842 Bethel Street, which occupies the whole block of Merchant Street between Bethel Street and Nuuanu Avenue. Built in 1931 at a cost of $235,000, it replaced an earlier brick building on the same site that dated from 1885, during the era of the notorious Walter Murray Gibson, so the new structure is also known as the Walter Murray Gibson Building. Architect Louis Davis designed it in a Spanish Mission Revival style that matches very well that of the newly built city hall, Honolulu Hale (1929). (Davis had designed the ornately Chinese New Palama Theatre two years earlier. It was leased in the 1970s to show Filipino films and renamed Zamboanga Theatre.) Building materials include 11 tons of marble from France, mahogany from the Philippines, and sandstone from Waianae. It served as the headquarters of the Honolulu Police Department until the latter moved to the old Sears building in Pawaa in 1967. It was renovated in the 1980s and now houses other city offices.

Early life A native of Dublin's East Wall, she was educated locally at Mount Carmel school. After completing a BA at University College Dublin, she then went on to work as an English and History teacher and guidance counsellor in a secondary school in Baldoyle, a position she held for 30 years. Political career She was a member of Tony Gregory's local political organisation in the 1970s, first canvassing for him and later serving as his election agent. She was co-opted onto Dublin City Council for the North Inner City local electoral area from September 2008 to June 2009, after the retirement of Mick Rafferty. After the death of Tony Gregory, she won the resulting by-election which was held on the same day as the local elections where she also won a seat on Dublin City Council, for the North Inner City local electoral area. Marie Metcalfe was co-opted to take the seat due to the dual mandate rule; subsequently Anna Quigley replaced Metcalfe on Dublin City Council, who was in turn replaced by Mel MacGiob√∫in in March 2014.http://www.dublincity.ie/sites/default/files/content/YourCouncil/CouncilMeetings/Documents/030314Minutes.pdf MacGiob√∫in failed to be elected at the local elections held in May. O'Sullivan was re-elected to the D√°il at the 2011 general election. She joined the D√°il Technical group which gave independents and minor parties more speaking time in D√°il debates. She described a proposal for political gender quota legislation as \\"tokenistic\\" and that women were able to get themselves nominated for election. In December 2015, Maureen O'Sullivan and fellow independent TDs Clare Daly and Mick Wallace each put forward offers of a ‚Ç¨5,000 surety for a 23-year-old man being prosecuted under terrorism legislation in the Special Criminal Court in Dublin charged with membership of an illegal dissident republican terrorist organisation. After the 2016 general election she unsuccessfully stood for election as Ceann Comhairle. She joined a technical group aligned with Independents 4 Change, while remaining outside the Independents 4 Change party. O'Sullivan was criticised by the brother of late TD Tony Gregory, over an allegedly false claim made in her election literature. On 16 January 2020, O'Sullivan announced she would not be standing in the February 2020 general election.

Role in BOLD Singleton is a former 24-year member of the New Orleans City Council. In last election to the body was in 1998, when he and Eddie L.

Chris Bonura, Look Who's Talking ... Jim Singleton, New Orleans CityBusiness, 2002 June 10.

The dynamics have meant that BOLD, although explicitly the Black Organization for Leadership Development, supports white candidates when expedient, from the BOLD perspective, for the overall good of the African-American community. Thus Singleton and BOLD have at times been sympathetic to white candidates (such as Stacy Head and Helena Moreno) when the alternative has been Jefferson or a member of the Progressive Democrats.

The Virgin of the Navigators () is a painting by Spanish artist Alejo Fern√°ndez, created as the central panel of an altarpiece for the chapel of the Casa de Contrataci√≥n in Alc√°zar of Seville, Seville, southern Spain. It was probably painted sometime between 1531 and 1536. Carla Rahn Phillips has suggested that it represents Christopher Columbus as a European magus-king reinforcing \\"the notion that the Spanish Empire represented the fulfillment of biblical prophecy to bring the Christian message to all the peoples of the world. The painting is a version of the common iconography of the Virgin of Mercy, in which the Virgin Mary protects the faithful under the folds of her mantle. This was well known from many paintings such as the Madonna of Mercy by the Italian painter Piero della Francesca (1445). In this iconography, the Virgin Mary is always the largest figure in the picture, towering above those being protected.Leslie Levin, 1998 Metaphors of Conversion in Seventeenth-century Spanish Drama page 28 Sometime before 1536, officials at the Casa de Contrataci√≥n commissioned the painting as the central panel of an altarpiece that they installed in the Hall of Audiences, so that the room could also serve as a chapel. Scholars date the painting to 1531‚Äì36.\\"16th century AD\\", Carla Rahn Phillips, Renaissance Quarterly, fall 2005 Background By the Age of Exploration, Mariology had expanded in Europe and many Catholics perceived the Virgin Mary as the symbol of motherhood and of all that was good, gentle and merciful.Heather Millar. 'Spain in the Age of Exploration', Marshall Cavendish, 1999, pp. 46-47 These sentiments were expressed in Marian art from that period (see History of Mariology). European navigators, especially the Portuguese, praying for a safe return to their homes, carried this sentiment to South America. They established churches dedicated to Our Lady of Navigators.Candice Lee Goucher, 2007 World History: Journeys from Past to Present page 102Vicente del Rio, 2009 Contemporary Urbanism in Brazil , page 189 Description The entire altarpiece in the Alc√°zar of Seville In The Virgin of the Navigators, Mary is depicted spreading her mantle over the Spanish.

Originally a general newspaper, it became noted for its sports coverage, and later for its theatrical content. History The Era was established in 1838 by a body of shareholders consisting of licensed victuallers and other people connected with their trade. The journal was intended to be a weekly organ of the public-house interest, just as the Morning Advertiser was then its daily organ. In the first two or three years of its existence, its political stance was broadly Liberal. Its first editor, Leitch Ritchie, proved too liberal for his board of directors, and in addition to editorial clashes, the paper was a commercial failure. Ritchie was succeeded by Frederick Ledger, who became sole proprietor as well as editor. He edited the paper for more than thirty years, gradually changing its politics from Liberalism to moderate Conservatism. Politics, however, ceased to be a major concern of The Era. Its great features after it came into the hands of Ledger were sport, freemasonry and the theatre. A contemporary observer remarked, \\"To the latter subject it has always devoted a very large part of its space. In relation indeed to the amount and accuracy of its theatrical intelligence, it far surpasses every other weekly journal.\\"The Waterloo Directory of English Newspapers and Periodicals: 1800-1900 at 19th Century British Library Newspapers, Gale Group (requires subscription) In an 1856 advertisement, The Era claimed to be the \\"largest Newspaper in the World, containing Sixty-four Columns of printed matter in small type. It is the only Weekly Newspaper combining all the advantages of a first-rate Sporting Journal, with those of a Family Newspaper. Literature and the Metropolitan and Provincial Drama has more space allotted to them in the Era than in any other Journal. The Operatic and Musical Intelligence, Home and Continental, is always most copious and interesting.\\" The Era became regarded as \\"Invaluable for reviews, news, and general theatrical information and gossip. Also of value are the assorted advertisements by and for actors and companies\\" The theatrical historian W. J. MacQueen-Pope described The Era as \\"The Actor's Bible\\", with the theatrical coverage gradually assuming prominence over all else: The Era was the longest running theatrical trade paper and continued to publish until the beginning of World War II, although its popularity and importance had long since declined.

Louisa Anne Beresford, Marchioness of Waterford (n√©e Stuart; 14 April 1818 ‚Äì 12 May 1891) was a Pre- Raphaelite watercolourist and philanthropist. Biography Born in Paris, she was the wife of Henry Beresford, 3rd Marquess of Waterford, younger sister of Charlotte, Countess Canning, daughter of Charles Stuart, 1st Baron Stuart de Rothesay and the former Lady Elizabeth Margaret Yorke. The family home was at Highcliffe Castle, and had been in Stuart possession since about 1770 when Louisa's great-grandfather, John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute (a founder of Kew Gardens), while out botanising, discovered the cliff-top viewsite overlooking Christchurch Bay, and commissioned the architect Robert Adam, to design High Cliff, a sumptuous Georgian mansion, with grounds laid out by Capability Brown. His fourth son, Lieutenant-General Sir Charles Stuart, inherited High Cliff, but landslips virtually destroyed the house, and he sold the greater part of the estate. Years later Louisa's father who had had a long and distinguished career, been honoured with a knighthood, and raised to the peerage by George IV in 1828, bought back the land and between 1831 and 1835 built the house that became known as Highcliffe Castle, and which has been described as \\"the most important remaining example of the Romantic Picturesque style of architecture.\\" Charles Stuart made use of the architect William Donthorne, a founder member of the Royal Institute of British Architects, to design Highcliffe Castle. Incorporated in the design was carved medieval stonework from the Norman Benedictine Abbey of St Peter at Jumi√®ges and from the Grande Maison des Les Andelys, both of which structures had fallen into disrepair after the French Revolution. Also included in the structure were a 16th-century oriel window and stained glass window. Her father was appointed British Ambassador at Paris shortly before marrying Elizabeth Margaret Yorke on 6 February 1816. Louisa's childhood in Paris was marked by the early tuition she received in the arts, in keeping with being a great-granddaughter of the writer Lady Mary Wortley Montagu. Art, religion and philanthropy, would feature prominently in her life. Despite being an accomplished amateur artist, her paintings did not appear in galleries until the 1870s. Showing great concern for the welfare of her tenants on her Northumberland property, she redesigned the village of Ford, designed and built a school, and founded a temperance society. Over a period of 22 years between 1860 and 1882, she decorated the school hall with life-sized watercolours on paper, which had been applied to canvas and mounted on the interior walls and gables. The images portrayed biblical scenes, and used the village residents as models. The village school was in use until 1957, but is now known as the Waterford Gallery or Lady Waterford Hall. Gleeson White described her talent in his work Children's Books and Their Illustrators Louisa was tutored by Dante Gabriel Rossetti and attended drawing classes held by John Ruskin, together with Lady Trevelyan and Kate Greenaway, and had introduced Rose La Touche to him. It is believed that she modelled for Sir John Everett Millais in several of his works, and her beauty has been accredited as one of the inspirations of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. On 8 June 1842 she married Lord Waterford and settled in Curraghmore House in County Waterford, until he died in a horse riding accident in 1859. The marriage produced no children. The erosion losses at Highcliffe were considerable and had been reckoned at about a yard a year ‚Äì the coast path was in constant need of maintenance due to cliff falls. Louisa wrote in her Recollections to the age of 12 that part of the problem was landsliding in the clays and to combat this she introduced an extensive drainage system in the cliffs to keep the clays dry. In about 1880 the problems of erosion of Highcliffe prompted her to seek an engineering solution. A prime cause was The Run, the river outflow from Christchurch Harbour, which because of its proximity to the cliffs, greatly increased the erosion. She arranged for the placing of limestone and granite-porphyry blocks near the Castle, with the idea of deflecting the course of The Run rather than directly opposing it. This groyne eventually disappeared and by 1931 only a few of the blocks were still visible at low tide. In his 1893 work, the Victorian biographer, Augustus Hare (1834‚Äì1903), wrote The story of two noble lives : being memorials of Charlotte, Countess Canning, and Louisa, Marchioness of Waterford ‚Äì Her grave lies next to the Church of St Michael in Ford Village. Its stone was designed in 1891 by George Frederic Watts, and the slab by Watts's wife Mary Seton Watts. It is a Grade II Listed Building protected by law.

Margaret was twenty years old, and Henry was twenty-four. Margaret brought Henry Ligny-en-Barrois as her dowry, however, by a clause in the marriage contract, it remained under the feudal suzerainty of the county of Bar. In contempt of this, Henry paid homage in 1256 to Theobald II of Navarre, in his capacity as Count of Champagne. Margaret's brother, Theobald II of Bar, took advantage of the conflict then raging between Frederick III of Lorraine (their cousin) and the bishops of Metz. Henry V was a partisan of the duke and so Theobald took the side of the bishop. Henry was captured in battle at Pr√©ny on 14 September 1266. On 8 September 1268, King Louis IX arbitrated between the two counts and Henry was freed and repossessed of Ligny, but under the suzerainty of the Barrois.

Lady Frola claims that her son-in-law Mr. Ponza went insane when her daughter, his wife, died four years ago, then remarried. Lady Frola claims he fantasizes that his new wife is his old wife. Mr. Ponza claims that Lady Frola could not accept her daughter‚Äôs death, went mad, and only survives by believing that his second wife is her living daughter. The townspeople attempt to learn the truth as the play progresses. Characters * Lamberto Laudisi * Lady Frola * Mr. Ponza, her son-in-law * Lady Ponza * Councillor Agazzi * Lady Amalia, his wife and sister of Lamberto Laudisi * Dina, their daughter * Lady Sirelli * Mr. Sirelli * The Prefect * Commissioner Centuri * Lady Cini * Lady Nenni * a waiter in the Agazzi's home * other Ladies and Gentlemen Plot Mr. Ponza and his mother-in-law, Lady Frola, escape to a quiet provincial town after a terrible earthquake in Marsica. It is rumored Ponza is married, but no one has ever seen Mrs. Ponza. The Ponzas stay on the top floor on a nearby block, while Lady Frola lives in a stylish apartment. The trio is subject of many rumours. Townspeople see Giulia Ponza as a monster who prevents her mother-in- law from leaving the house. So, Mr. Ponza's boss, Councillor Agazzi, goes the prefect to bring out the truth and clarify the matter. Lamberto Laudisi defends the new arrivals from the curiosity of the village, stating the impossibility of knowing each other and, more generally, absolute truth. Lady Frola becomes the object of a real investigation on the life of her family. Mr. Ponza is under the same investigation, during which declares the insanity of his mother-in-law. He explains Lady Frola went insane after the death of her daughter Lina (his first wife), and he convinced Lady Frola that Giulia (his second wife) is actually her daughter and is still alive. To preserve the illusion, they had to take a number of precautions that made everyone suspicious. The townspeople are stunned but reassured by the revelation. Lady Frola soon learns of Ponza's story and claims he is crazy, at least when considering Giulia as his second wife. Lady Frola said her daughter Lina Ponza had been in an asylum, and she would not have accepted at home if they had not performed the second marriage, as if it were a second woman. Everyone is stunned, not knowing what to think, except Laudisi, who bursts into laughter. The search for evidence to determine the truth is actually the opportunity to Laudisi to unravel the meaning of this, while arguing with his own reflection in the mirror: > Oh dear! Who is insane among us? Oh I know, [pointing at himself] I say YOU! > Who goes there, face to face, we know well the two of us. The trouble is > that, like I do, others do not see you ... For others you become a ghost! > And you see his as insane? Regardless of the ghosts who haunt them, they are > running, full of curiosity, behind the ghosts of others! In an attempt to solve the riddle, Councillor Agazzi arranges a meeting between mother-in-law and son-in-law: the resulting scenes are full of frenzied violence, in which Mr. Ponza screams at his mother-in-law. He later apologizes for his attitude, saying that it was necessary to play the part of the madman to keep alive the illusion of Mrs. Frola. In the last act, after a vain search for evidence among the survivors of the earthquake, they seek out the first wife of Mr. Ponza at Agazzi asylum. They find a woman with her face covered by a black veil, who claims to be the daughter of Mrs. Frola and the second wife of Mr. Ponza. She says, \\" I am the one to be believed.\\" Laudisi, after a laugh, says with a look of mocking challenge: \\" And now, gentlemen, who speaks the truth? Are you happy?\\" Translations Initial English translations have been titled Right You Are (if you think so). In 2003 Franco Zeffirelli commissioned a new translation/adaptation by Martin Sherman entitled Absolutely {Perhaps} and performed at Wyndham's Theatre in Dublin. References Sources * Baccolo, L. L.

It is thought to be the deadliest construction accident in U.S. history.  Background  Pleasants Power Plant with its two cooling towers shown here in 2015. During the 1970s, many coal-powered power plants were being built in the valley along the Ohio River. The Allegheny Power System was building another, larger plant at Willow Island, which would have two electric generators with a total capacity of 1,300 megawatts. This was in addition to the two smaller units that were already installed there. By April 1978, one natural draft cooling tower had been built, and a second was under construction. One of the contractors, New Jersey-based Research-Cottrell, was well known for constructing such towers around the country. The usual method of scaffold construction has the base of the scaffold built on the ground, with the top being built higher to keep up with the height of the tower. The scaffolding on the Willow Island cooling tower was bolted to the structure it was being used to build. A layer of concrete was poured; then, after the concrete forms were removed, the scaffolding was raised and bolted onto the new section. Cranes atop the scaffolding raised buckets of concrete. One lift of concrete was poured each day.  Collapse  On April 27, 1978, tower number 2 had reached a height of . Just after 10:00 a.m., as the third bucket of concrete was being raised, the cable hoisting the bucket slackened, and the crane pulling it up fell toward the inside of the tower. The previous day's concrete then started to collapse. Concrete began to unwrap from the top of the tower, first peeling counter-clockwise, then in both directions. A jumble of concrete, wooden forms, and metal scaffolding fell into the hollow center of the tower. All fifty-one construction workers on the scaffold fell to their deaths. Immediately following the collapse, other construction workers onsite began digging for their coworkers. Fire departments from Belmont, Parkersburg, Vienna, and St. Marys in West Virginia, and Marietta in Ohio, were called in. Ambulances from Parkersburg and Marietta hospitals were also dispatched. The Volunteer Fire Department in Belmont was turned into a temporary morgue. Many of the men were only able to be identified by the contents of their pockets. All but one worker were identified by co-workers.  Investigation  The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) investigation team arrived at the site the day of the accident. A team from the National Bureau of Standards (now called the National Institute of Standards and Technology) arrived two days later. A number of safety lapses caused the collapse: * Scaffolding was attached to concrete that had not been given time to sufficiently cure. * Bolts were missing, and the existing bolts were of insufficient grade. (See Bolted joint) * There was only one access ladder, thereby resulting in an escape restriction. * An elaborate concrete hoisting system had been modified without proper engineering review. * Contractors were rushing the construction. On June 8, 1978, OSHA cited Willow Island contractors for 20 violations, including failures to field test concrete and anchor the scaffold system properly. The cases were settled for $85,500, or about $1,700 per worker killed. OSHA referred the case to the United States Department of Justice for criminal investigation. A grand jury was convened, but no charges were filed.  List of the dead  * Joseph V. Bafile, Washington, Pa. * James B. Blouir, St. Marys * Robert W. Blouir, St. Marys * Steve D.

Mexico City, 1894/1897? ‚Äì d. Mexico City, March 27, 1971) was a Mexican painter, known for his ‚Äúmelancholy‚Äù depiction of Mexico rather than the more dominant political or festive one of the Mexican muralism movement. This is especially true of his ‚Äúwhite stage‚Äù which is marked by cold colors and tragic scenes focusing on human figures which are skeletal or ghost-like. His work influenced Mexican films such as La perla. Life Manuel Rodr√≠guez Lozano was born in Mexico City, with his birth year placed between 1894 and 1897. He was from a wealthy family, the son of Manuel Z. Rodr√≠guez and Sara Lozano, who were interested in art and music and entertained visitors such as poet Amado Nervo. When he was eleven, he enlisted in the military service and took examinations to enter the diplomatic corps. However, he eventually abandoned both. He then began to paint on his own in 1910, moving on to attend the Academy of San Carlos under teachers such as Germ√°n Gedovius and Alfredo Ramos Mart√≠nez. However, he left the school after a short time for unknown reasons. In 1913, Rodr√≠guez Lozano married Carmen Mondrag√≥n, later known as Nahui Oll√≠n. The two met at a dance and she became smitten with him. At first he was not interested but her father, General Manuel Mondrag√≥n, was a powerful man politically, and this changed the artist‚Äôs mind. However, shortly after the marriage, General Mondrag√≥n was involved in the Decena tragica and the assassination of Francisco I. Madero, which forced the entire family into exile into Europe for eight years. At first the couple lived in Paris, but with the outbreak of World War I, the family moved to Spain. His time in Europe, especially Paris, put him in touch with avant garde artists such as Matisse, Braque and Picasso as well as writers such as Andr√© Salmon, Jean Cassou and Andre Lothe, who influenced his art. However, his relationship with Nahui Oll√≠n was problematic. She did not like his bohemian friends and accused him of being a homosexual. The couple had a child in 1914, but the infant died shortly after birth. Rodr√≠guez Lozano stated that his wife smothered the child but her family denied it. The couple separated when Rodr√≠guez Lozano returned to Mexico in 1921. In the early 1920s, Rodr√≠guez Lozano had an amorous relationship with Abraham √Ångel, who was also his student. √Ångel died in 1924 from a cocaine overdose, which may have been intentionally suicidal. In 1928, he began a relationship with Antonieta Rivas Mercado. She was in love with him, ignoring his relationships with men. She did much for his career but the two never became sexual. She committed suicide in 1931. The deaths of his child, √Ångel and Rivas Mercado, along with his incarceration in 1940, left scars and made his art darker. Rodr√≠guez Lozano died in Mexico City on March 27, 1971 from heart failure. He was buried at the Pante√≥n de Dolores in Mexico City. Career Piedad en el desierto at the Palacio de Bellas Artes After Rodr√≠guez Lozano returned from Europe to Mexico in 1921, he exhibited his work at the Department of Fine Arts and in San Carlos. The following year, out of necessity, he accepted a position as a drawing teacher for elementary schools, introducing a technique developed by Adolfo Best Maugard . In 1923, Roberto Montenegro introduced Manuel to Francisco Sergio Iturbe, who became his patron and protector. During the early 1920s, he began to teach two students, Abraham √Ångel and Julio Castellanos, as well as promote their artwork. In 1925, the three traveled to Argentina to present at the Museo Provincial de Bellas Artes. The three then traveled to Paris to exhibit at the Cercle Paris Amirique Latine. Along with these two he had two other important students, Tebo and Nefero. In 1928, he began a relationship with Antonieta Rivas Mercado, the daughter of a prominent architect. The two founded the Ulises Theater, the headquarters for the Contempor√°neos group and an important meeting place for artists and intellectuals such as Salvador Novo, Isabela Corona and Celestino Gorostiza. The organization not only put on plays for which Rodr√≠guez did set design, it also edited and published books such as Dama de corazones by Xavier Villaurrutia and Los hombres que disperse la danza by Andr√©s Henestrosa. At the request of Carlos Chavez, Rodr√≠guez Lozano convinced Antonieta to help form council to found a Mexican symphony orchestra, and he founded El ballet de la paloma azul. From 1932 to 1933 he painted Los tableros de la muerte, commissioned by Iturbe, and in 1935 he finished Il Verdaccio, one of his most important works. In 1940, Rodr√≠guez Lozano was appointed as the director of the Escuela Nacional de Artes Pl√°sticas, and then invited artists such as Diego Rivera, Antonio M. Ru√≠z, Manuel √Ålvarez Bravo, Luis Ortiz Monasterio and Jes√∫s Guerrero Galv√°n to work with the school. As director, he founded the magazines Artes Pl√°sticas and promoted meetings outside his house which was attended by artists and intellectuals such as Alfonso Reyes, Dolores del R√≠o, Rodolfo Usigli and Nelson Rockefeller as a center of intellectual life in Mexico City. However, there were internal political struggles and his tenure was ended with an accusation of theft against him. The school received a request to lend engravings by Albrecht D√ºrer and Guido Reno for the 400th anniversary of the founding of the Colegio de San Nicol√°s in Michoac√°n. Rodr√≠guez Lozano requested the works but then they disappeared and he was held responsible for the theft, imprisoned in Lecumberri prison . During his time in prison he painted a mural and worked on materials that were later published in a book. After four months he was released and renounced everything he had before. The engraving reappeared without explanations in 1966. During his career, the artist created two murals. The first was while he was in Lecumberri, called Piedad en el desierto, notable as the start of his ‚Äúwhite‚Äù stage of artistic production. This work was later moved to the Palacio de Bellas Artes and restored in 1967. In 1945 he painted the mural El holocaust, in Iturbe‚Äôs house, now the Isabel la Cat√≥lica building. For just these two murals some critics have stated that he should be considered among the best of Mexico‚Äôs muralists. In 1948 he was invited by the University of Paris and the Mus√©e de l'Homme to exhibit at the Mus√©e de l'Orangerie. He stopped painting in the 1950s although there is a portrait of Alfonso Reyes from 1960. In 1960, he published an anthology of his essay as Pensamiento y pintura. The National Museum of Mexican Art has thirty of his paintings. Rodr√≠guez Lozano‚Äôs work was recognized with a retrospective as part of Mexico City‚Äôs 1968 Summer Olympics, as well as another posthumously in 2011 at the Museo Nacional de Arte. In 2011, a book titled Manuel Rodr√≠guez Lozano. Pensamiento y pintura 1922-1958 was published, based on the work by the artist. He was a member of the Sal√≥n de la Pl√°stica Mexicana. Artistry Rodr√≠guez Lozano began his career at the time that Mexican muralism was being established as the main artistic movement in the country. Jos√© Vasconcelos invited the artist to participate in the government projects being sponsored but the Rodr√≠guez Lozano refused because he did not believe that art should be used for political messages. His depictions of subjects did not follow the movement either, preferring more poetic interpretations, and for much of his career did not heavily rely on Mexican archetypes, believing that his work was ‚ÄúMexican‚Äù no matter what. His work does show some influence from European art movements, from the time he spent on the continent, especially from the work of Giorgio de Chirico and Pablo Picasso. However he does not follow any of these trends faithfully either, leading his work to be characterized as Cubist and Surrealist . While this led to rejection of work by contemporary art critic Luis Cardoza y Arag√≥n, later critics such as Raquel Tibol and Berta Taracena have been more positive, both noting that his work depicted a melancholy Mexico rather than a festive one. While his subject matter was generally related to life in Mexico, especially its suffering, he also did a number of portraits such as those of Jaime Torres Bodet, Daniel Cos√≠o Villegas and Rodolfo Usigli, with one done of Antonieta Rivas Mercado after her death. Rodr√≠guez Lozano‚Äôs work is divided into three distinct periods. The first focused on Mexican archetypes and lasted from 1922 to 1934. These figures were often life-sized or monumental, with solid and thick forms focusing on folkloric content with embellished realism. These compositions are simplistic, with restricted but rich color to evoke nostalgia, but without being purely decorative. The second stage is called the monumental stage, lasting from 1935 to 1939. These works depicted everyday life in Mexico, with exaggerated proportions and gigantic figures for poetic effect. These figures included prostitutes, laborers, and people of poor neighborhoods. Some are nudes and some seem to look off into the horizon. Towards the end of this period, his colors become paler. Although he began some of the tendencies earlier, his last stage, known as the ‚Äúwhite stage‚Äù is marked by the creation of the mural Piedad en el desierto while the artist was imprisoned in Lecumberri. In this stage, colors pale to cold lilacs, blues, grays and light pinks, revolving around white with the only dark and profound colors appearing in night skies. Scenes here are tragic, with dramatic expressions of anguish, desolation and desperation, expressing both misery and grandeur. Works still focus on human figures, but these evolve from robust to elongated, sublime and almost skeletal or ghost-like, with forms styled to their fundamentals. Often these figures are androgynous or mix elements of male and female. Mexican archetypal elements still appear, such as the use of the rebozo to indicate pain and suffering. This use later influenced cinema productions such as the film La perla by Emilio Fern√°ndez. During this stage Rodr√≠guez produced over thirty paintings and two murals, lasting until he retired from painting in the mid 1950s.

It was written by James Oliver Curwood and was followed in 1917, by a sequel, Baree, Son of Kazan. Plot Kazan, one quarter wolf and three quarters husky, travels to the Canadian wilderness with his owner Thorpe where they meet man named McCready who Kazan recognizes as someone who abused him in the past. When McCready attacks Thorpe's wife Isobel, Kazan kills McCready and then runs away fearing the harsh punishment for killing a man. He later encounters a wolf pack of which he becomes the new leader, and has a mate, Gray Wolf. One day the pack comes across a sick, old man, Pierre Radisson, his married daughter Joan and her baby girl. Seeing the woman, Kazan turns against his pack, protecting the family from the other wolves. Eventually the pack, with the exception of Gray Wolf, runs away. Joan and her father take Kazan with them and nurse his wounds. After he has recovered, his new owners leave for Pierre's cabin in Churchill. Gray Wolf follows them at a distance hoping to be reunited with Kazan. Pierre dies on the journey, leaving his daughter, her child and Kazan alone to reach the cabin. That winter Kazan spends the day with Gray Wolf while sleeping at the cabin at night. That spring Gray Wolf has had three cubs. Kazan begins staying longer with Gray Wolf, even hunting for her. One day, when he returns from one of his hunts, Kazan finds a lynx fighting with Gray Wolf. Kazan attacks the lynx and soon kills it but then discovers his cubs are dead and Gray Wolf is now blind. Few days later, Joan and her husband are ready to leave. They have decided to take Kazan with them and he is tied up so he can't escape. However, as the family is ready to go, they see Gray Wolf by the river howling to Kazan who immediately runs to her. The pair stay together, narrowly escaping a forest fire that ravages the wilderness. They are then captured by Henry Lottie, a trapper, and his companion, Paul Wayman, a former hunter, now an environmentalist and animal lover. Wayman buys the wolves from Lottie and sets them free. The wolves return to their old lair where Gray Wolf gives birth to a male cub, Baree. The now two thirds wolf-one third dog pup who leaves his parents after a few months, ready to survive on his own. A large colony of beavers shows up at the nearby river and begins building a dam despite the wolves' attempts to run them off. One day Kazan accidentally kills his only ally against the intruders, a large river otter, after mistaking her for one of the beavers. Eventually the entire area around the couple's territory is flooded and they are forced to leave. They head north together until they are separated by Sandy McTrigger, a gold digger and possible murderer. He captures Kazan with the plan to use him in fights. However, when Kazan and his opponent, half great dane, half mastiff known as Dane, face each other, they silently agree not to fight, thus earning the respect of an old man, Professor McGill, who buys off the two dogs from their owners. McGill and the dogs prepare for their journey to Fond Du Lac and soon leave. Several days later, Mctrigger, who apparently had tracked them down, tries to sneak on them, but is heard and attacked by Kazan. Using the opportunity, Kazan runs away just as McGill shoots Sandy multiple times, thus killing him. The story continues with Joan and her husband, who have returned to the wild with their daughter. Soon after they see Kazan again away in the distance, who joins them for a moment, only to leave when he hears Gray Wolf howling for him. The book ends with the reunited pair who once again hunts together side by side under the moon.

On its website, he presents a series of Life Lessons, #3 being ‚ÄúWork Hard.‚Äù As part of this lesson, he recalled, ‚ÄúThomas Jacquez...would rise at 9:00 AM every morning and go for a run. Whether it was pouring rain or scorching hot, Tom would roll out of bed for a morning jog.‚Äù Jacquez made the Bruins starting rotation as a freshman in 1995. However, he missed most of his sophomore year after an emergency appendectomy in February 1996. ‚ÄúI had a bad stomach ache for a day,‚Äù he said a year later. ‚ÄúI thought it was food poisoning. It progressively got worse as the night went on. The next morning, I went to the emergency room. When something like this happens and prevents you from doing something you love, it is real hard mentally and physically. You don‚Äôt realize how much you appreciate something until you can‚Äôt do it anymore. I don‚Äôt take anything for granted anymore. Every outing I‚Äôm pitching like it could be my last one. I‚Äôm giving it 100 percent every time.‚Äô‚Äù Weighing the medical risks, Thomas was prepared to return if the Bruins needed him, but instead he got back in action during the summer of 1996 with the Cotuit Kettleers of the Cape Cod Baseball League. He went 2-1, 2.14 and got his nickname \\"Hawk\\" from his host family. He then rebounded strongly as a redshirt sophomore, posting a 10-4 record with a 3.06 ERA and leading the Bruins with 129.1 innings pitched. UCLA won the NCAA‚Äôs Midwest Regional tournament, although Harvard surprised Jacquez in the opener, winning 7-3. The Bruins made it to the College World Series as the #4 seed before losing two tough games to Miami and Mississippi State. Professional career On the recommendation of area scout Mark Ralston, the Phillies selected Jacquez in the sixth round of the 1997 amateur draft (he was eligible because he had junior standing). He said in 2011, ‚ÄúMy childhood dream was to pitch in the major leagues. By leaving early, I was able to take one step closer to achieving my goal.‚Äù A couple of weeks later, he signed and reported to Batavia in the NY-Penn League. After going 2-1 with a 2.42 ERA in four starts, he went to Piedmont of the Class A South Atlantic League in July. There he was 2-4, 4.97 in eight starts. For 1998, Jacquez rose to Clearwater in the Florida State League (high Class A) where he posted 9-11, 4.50 as he started 28 of 29 games. Late that July, he pitched a one-hit shutout and gave up no walks. He did enough to rise to the next level, Double-A Reading, in 1999. After a win over New Britain in late May, the Reading Eagle wrote, ‚ÄúFar from overpowering, Thomas Jacquez uses control and finesse...Jacquez started to laugh Sunday afternoon when an out of-town reporter anointed him the new ace of the Reading Phillies staff. ‚ÄòI wouldn‚Äôt say that,‚Äô said Jacquez.‚Äù He had already yielded 11 homers that season and added, ‚ÄúEvery game is a battle for me. I‚Äôm a groundball pitcher. If I get the ball up, you saw what happens.‚Äù For the first time, Jacquez also began to pitch more often as a reliever; he started 14 times in 38 games and earned a promotion to Philadelphia‚Äôs Triple-A affiliate, the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Barons, for the last week of their season. The Philadelphia Daily News indicated on August 30 that he might even get a September call-up to the big club, but that was not the case (although he pitched well in three relief appearances for the Barons). Jacquez started the 2000 season back at Reading, but after posting a 2.96 ERA in 13 games, he climbed to Scranton/Wilkes-Barre once again (despite an 0-3 record). With the Barons, he got four saves behind primary closer Kirk Bullinger, going 5-1, 1.98 in 35 games with one start. Baseball Prospectus wrote, ‚ÄúHis progress this year as a reliever is apparently a product of minor-league pitching coach Gorman Heimueller‚Äôs work with him.‚Äù In early September, Jacquez got his call to the big leagues as Philadelphia purchased his contract. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs here to give us an extra arm in the bullpen,‚Äù said manager Terry Francona. After 2000, Jacquez played in the minor leagues for several seasons. He played for Scranton/Wilkes-Barre in 2001 before joining the Chicago White Sox farm system for the 2002 season. That year Thomas had season-ending Tommy John surgery. Jacquez played for the Charlotte Knights and Great Falls White Sox over 2002 and 2003. He entered the Baltimore Orioles farm system and played for the Bowie Baysox in 2004, after which he voluntarily retired from pro baseball due to shoulder injury. Personal life Thomas returned to get his college degree and graduated with honors in 2005 with a BA from University of San Francisco (USF) . From 2005-2014, he worked at a private, independent college preparatory high school, The Urban School of San Francisco, where he coached baseball and taught Spanish and Service Learning. He has also served as a site director for seven years with Aim High, a San Francisco educational non-profit that provides summer academic and social learning opportunities for low income middle school youth. He served on the Aim High Board of Trustees for four years. Thomas earned his MA in 2013 from USF and has been accepted as a doctoral student. His private practice, Pitchinthezone.com was born one year into his doctoral program.

Beginning in the Monashee Mountains to the north, the Upper Adams River flows mainly southward and eventually reaches Adams Lake. The Lower Adams River begins at the southern end of the lake and flows into the extreme western end of Shuswap Lake. The river is one of the most important sockeye salmon breeding areas in North America. The run occurs in mid-October and can bring millions of fish to a concentrated area near the river mouth. Excavations of Secwepemc villages on the river have shown a long tradition of habitation and salmon fishing in the area. The river also served as an important transportation route for early logging operations in the watershed. Course Drainage basin of the Adams River The headwaters of the Adams are several unnamed glaciers at roughly elevation in the north-east region of the Monashee Range of the Columbia Mountains. The upper portion of the river flows roughly south and southwest through wetlands and passes through two small lakes, Tumtum and Mica. It has sections of rapids and whitewater, and flows over cataracts below Tumtum Lake. Its flow drops by per kilometre in certain sections. After travelling for and entering the Shuswap Highland, it enters the northern end of Adams Lake. Adams Lake is roughly along its north-south axis, and reaches a maximum depth of , making it the 24th deepest lake in the world. The Lower Adams issues from the extreme southern end of the lake and travels through a narrow valley. It empties into Shuswap Lake near the community of Squilax. From Adams Lake to the Shuswap, the Lower Adams drops in elevation. =Tributaries= Tributaries of the Upper Adams include: *Oliver Creek *Dudgeon Creek *Sunset Creek *Fisher Creek Adams Lake and the Lower Adams are fed by: *Cayenne Creek *Sinmax Creek *Momich River *Hiuihill (Bear) Creek *Nikwikwaia (Gold) Creek History =Secwepemc= The Secwepemc people have lived in the Adams River valley for millennia. A 1977 study by the provincial government along the lower river found sixty-six sites with evidence of habitation dating to 2000 BCE. The abundance of the salmon run made the river an important food source and trade commodity for First Nations people in the region. Ethnographer James Teit records that the people of the Adams River area formed a sub-group of the Secwepemc called the \\"Sxste'lln\\", now known as the Adams Lake Indian Band. The Sxste'lln moved between summer and winter camps at the outlet of the lower river and the Little River area near Chase. The river's namesake, Chief Sel-howt-ken (baptized as Adam by Oblate missionaries) was a Sxste'lln leader in the 1860s. Like more than 200 of his people, he died in the 1862 smallpox epidemic. =Adams River Lumber Company= Bear Creek flume, c.1910 Although prospectors, surveyors, and trappers had travelled the region in the 1800s, the first large scale activity in the river valley by Europeans was logging. J.P. McGoldrick, an experienced lumberman from Spokane, established the Adams River Lumber Company in 1909. He licensed large tracts of timber along both the Upper and Lower rivers, as well as the surrounding plateau. McGoldrick's company is described as the first major industrial operation in the British Columbia Interior. A camp was built on the upper river and logging operations began at Tumtum Lake. The cut logs were run down the river, then towed in booms by the company owned sternwheeler Helen down Adams Lake. The logs then were run down the Lower river to the mill at Chase. In 1908, Adams River Logging constructed a \\"splash dam\\" at the outlet of the Lower Adams. This dam allowed operators to raise the water level of Adams Lake. When sufficient logs had been collected above the dam, the gates were opened and the resulting flood carried the logs to Shuswap Lake. This proved to be destructive to the salmon run as it damaged the gravel beds the fish use to spawn. In order to move logs from the plateau above the Lower river, Adams River Lumber constructed several flumes. The flumes were elevated wooden troughs filled with water that floated logs down to the valley bottom. The largest of these was at Bear Creek. It incorporated trestles up to high and was capable of moving of logs per month. It was the largest flume in North America at its peak. The structures were dismantled after the areas became logged out. Although logging continues in the region, the Adams is no longer used for log transport. Ecology Logger falling a Western red cedar on the Upper Adams, c.1910 =Flora= Much of the ecology of the watershed has been affected by wildfires and forestry, and is considered to be in a seral phase. The river travels through several different vegetation zones. In its upper reaches, the Adams flows through the Interior Cedar Hemlock zone. These forests are similar to the coastal forests of British Columbia and contain old-growth trees up to 1000 years in age. Old-growth stands along the river also contain rare species of lichen, likely isolated by the last Ice Age. The floodplain of the Upper Adams contains wetland species of deciduous trees such as black cottonwood as well as a dense layer of shrubs including black twinberry, red-osier dogwood, and thimbleberry. The lower river is dominated by the drier Interior Douglas Fir vegetation zone. Other conifer species present are Ponderosa pine, Engelmann spruce, and alpine fir. The area around the river mouth has been altered by human activities such as farming and livestock grazing. =Fauna= Sockeye salmon Adams River sockeye travel from their spawning grounds to the South Thompson River, then into the Fraser River, and enter the Pacific. From the Strait of Georgia, they spend three years in the open ocean following Arctic currents to Alaska and the Aleutian islands. They then retrace their route to the Adams, completing a round trip of over . They complete the arduous trip upstream, including navigating the swift waters and rapids of the Fraser Canyon, in just seventeen days. They do not eat during this period; instead they rely on fat reserves stored up from heavy feeding in the Strait of Georgia in the late summer. It is at this point that the salmon take on their distinctive red hue, with the male fish also developing large humped backs and aggressive hooked mouths. How they are able navigate back to their natal river is not fully understood, but a highly developed olfactory system is believed to play a part. The alluvial gravel deposits that form the Adams river bottom are ideal for the development of salmon roe and alevins. The temperature and neutral Ph of the water is also well-suited to the sockeye. Shuswap Lake, below the river, is called a \\"nursery lake\\" by biologists due to its high concentration of picoplankton, a food source for young salmon. Sockeye spawn in a side channel of the Adams River Dominant runs The Adams River run occurs every year, but every fourth year (called a \\"dominant\\" year), the numbers are much higher. 2018 was the most recent dominant run. According to Canada's Department of Fisheries and Oceans, the Fraser River sockeye run of 2010 was the largest since 1913, numbering an estimated 34 million fish. At least 3,866,000 of these fish returned to the Adams River to spawn. There is no clear consensus as to why the Adams stock has rebounded so remarkably (1991 saw an estimated return of 718 fish). In the Globe and Mail, Simon Fraser University biologist John Reynolds said \\"[predicting salmon numbers] is massively complex, even for a scientist.\\" Other fauna The Adams River valley supports large populations of mule deer, with smaller herds of white-tail deer. Black bears are common in the watershed. The bear population grows substantially during the fall as they gather from adjacent valleys to feed on the spawning salmon. In the upper river valley, moose are common, and the headwaters of the river contain grizzly bear habitat. Several species of aquatic mammals are found on the river, including beaver, mink, and river otter. The river's mouth has populations of Canada geese and swans. Other waterfowl include mallards, green-winged teal, and goldeneye. The river supports Bald eagle and osprey populations, whose eyries can be seen high up in black cottonwood and dead conifers. Grouse, especially ruffed grouse, are numerous throughout the valley. Protected areas The Adams passes through the 5,733 hectare Upper Adams River Provincial Park and the 1,076 hectare Ts√∫tswecw Provincial Park, which provides trails and platforms for salmon viewing. Human visitors to Ts√∫tswecw Provincial Park were estimated at 160,000 in 2010. Conservation in the watershed owes much to Roderick Haig-Brown, a Canadian conservationist, writer and a member of the International Pacific Salmon Fisheries Commission.

Henryk Hechtkopf Biography Henryk Hechtkopf was an artist whose legacy is a rare collection of paintings in a variety of media, as well as illustrations for many children's books and Stories of The Tzadikim. Henryk Hechtkopf's work encompasses a range of subjects and artistic styles: biblical scenes and portraits, surrealism and abstract expressionism. His work is interesting not only by its own merits but because of the life story that stands behind it. Henryk Hechtkopf was born to a Jewish family in Warsaw in 1910, the younger child of two. His father was a merchant, and his mother a midwife. Hechtkopf studied in the Hebrew Gymnasium \\"Chanoch\\" and then in Warsaw University. After obtaining his law degree, Hechtkopf became the first Jewish jurist to article at the Polish Supreme Court. From early on, his artistic talent was evident. At the age of 23, his work was consistently selected to appear in the exhibitions of the \\"Jewish Society for Promotion of Art.\\" Hechtkopf was also a filmmaker. He was involved in the making of several films before the outbreak of World War II, including Poland's first animated film. While Hechtkopf's work was always very strongly informed by his Jewish background, drawing on religious symbolism and Jewish life in the Shtetl, his experiences during WWII were to have a profound impact on his work. At the beginning of the war, he retreated with the Polish army east into the Soviet Union, where he was captured and sent to work in a series of forced labor camps. After the war, he returned to Poland to find that his whole family had been massacred in the Holocaust. Hechtkopf 's drawings in the weeks following his return to Warsaw portrayed the ruins of the ghetto and the city which surrounded it. Twenty-four of these works were purchased by the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial in Israel. Yehudit Shendar, the art curator of Yad Vashem has commented on the strong impact that Hechtkopf's work has on the viewer, as a first-hand account of destruction and despair. Hechtkopf designed in 1949 the first Polish stamp commemorating the Holocaust, and won first prize in an international competition for posters on the theme of Holocaust and heroism. After the war, Hechtkopf was offered a position as a judge in Warsaw, but decided instead to move to ≈Å√≥d≈∫, which was then the center of artistic life in Poland. In ≈Å√≥d≈∫, he met his wife Alicja Zielinska. She has a sister Teresa Materne (Zielinska), who lives in ≈Å√≥d≈∫ (Poland) to this day. When his wife died on 15 September 1989, Henryk keep good contact with the wife's sister. He helped establish the Jewish artist's society in ≈Å√≥d≈∫, which he headed from 1946 to 1950. He also taught film at the ≈Å√≥d≈∫ film school, where Roman Polanski numbered among his students. Before leaving Poland for Israel in 1957, Hechtkopf directed together with Jan Batory, Poland's first post-war non-documentary successful film, \\"Forbidden Melodies\\" (1956). Upon his arrival in Israel, Hechtkopf settled in Bat Yam, where he remained for the rest of his life, working as a painter and as an illustrator of books. While he employed different styles and techniques, his strong sensitivity and particular identity are evident in all his work. His wife died in 1989. Henryk Hechtkopf died in July 2004, at the age of 94. While they left behind no heirs, Hechtkopf claimed that his paintings were his children.

Forming on December 30, 2001, Cyprien quickly strengthened in a slightly favorable environment. By January 2, the storm attained its peak intensity with winds of 100 km/h (65 mph) according to M√©t√©o-France and 95 km/h (60 mph) according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center. Later that day the storm made landfall in Morombe, at a weaker intensity, and dissipated early on January 3\\\\. Throughout the affected areas, Cyprien destroyed 957 structures, leaving 1.16 billion Malagasy franc (2002 MGF; US$181,000) in damages. No fatalities were reported; however two people were listed as missing. Meteorological history On December 26, a cold front exited Mozambique in southeastern Africa into the Mozambique channel. Upon reaching open waters, the front developed an area of convection and later a circulation just inland from the coast on December 27\\\\. The front dissipated but the circulation remained as a distinct low pressure area. Although there was high wind shear in the area, good divergence allowed for convection to continue developing. On December 30, M√©t√©o-France (MFR), the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center, designated the system as a tropical disturbance. Over the next two days, convection became increasingly organized, with banding features developing by December 31. That day, MFR upgraded the disturbance to a tropical depression, and around 0900 UTC, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert. Decreasing wind shear and moderate outflow would allow the system to intensify into a tropical storm. On January 1, 2002, the JTWC classified the depression as a tropical storm, designating it as Tropical Cyclone 08S. The system rapidly organized shortly after and was further upgraded to a moderate tropical storm by M√©t√©o-France at 0600 UTC, at which time the Meteorological Service of Madagascar gave it the name Cyprien. In response to a mid to upper- level subtropical high pressure area, the storm tracked in a general eastward direction at 16 km/h (10 mph). Several hours after being named, the JTWC assessed Cyprien to have reached its peak winds of 95 km/h (60 mph 1-minute winds). QuickSCAT satellite passes indicated areas of 100 km/h (65 mph) winds early on January 2, prompting M√©t√©o-France to upgrade Cyprien to a severe tropical storm, with winds peaking at 100 km/h (65 mph 10-minute winds). By this time, the central barometric pressure fell to 980 hPa (mbar). Later on January 2, the combination of the subtropical ridge to the north, an approaching mid-latitude trough and moderate to strong westerlies caused Severe Tropical Storm Cyprien to turn towards the southwest. Slight weakening took place shortly before the storm made landfall in Morombe; maximum winds decreased to 50 mph (85 km/h 10-minute winds). Increased wind shear and interaction with land caused the deep convection to become substantially displaced to the east from the center of circulation. Early on January 3, Cyprien was downgraded to a tropical depression by both agencies; however, some areas were still reporting gale-force winds. It turned to the northeast over land, dissipating late on January 3. Impact and aftermath The precursor to Cyprien dropped heavy rainfall in Mozambique, including in Beira. Due to the low-intensity of the storm, damages in southwestern Madagascar were moderate. Cyprien produced wind gusts as strong as . Heavy rains also fell throughout the region, peaking at . The hardest hit area was the city of Morombe; a total of 900 people in the city were affected by the storm and two people were reportedly missing. Following an assessment of the storm's impact, 180 homes and 16 administrative buildings were found to have been destroyed by Cyprien. Damages in the area amounted to 1.1 billion Malagasy franc (2002 MGF; US$172,507). North of Morombe, the city of Morondava also sustained significant damage; roughly 1,000 people were affected and 661 homes were destroyed. Numerous homes were inundated by floodwaters. Officials reported that floodwaters persisted until January 9. Damages in the city amounted to 60 million MGF (2002 MGF; US$9,287). In all, damages from the storm amounted to 1.16 billion MGF (2002 MGF; ~US$181,000). Following Cyprien, the Government of Madagascar did not request international assistance in post-storm recovery. By January 10, a cargo plane carrying 65 million MGF (2002 MGF; US$10,062) worth of relief supplies was deployed to the affected regions. The supplies, consisting of medical supplies, tents, and one tonne of rice, were given to local authorities to be distributed to the affected population. Sanitary items were also distributed by the government to avoid an outbreak of water-borne diseases such as diarrhea and cholera.

Career After producing several experimental video art pieces, Tsuchiya first came to prominence with A New God, a personal documentary shot on video about his relationship with a right- wing, neo-nationalist punk rock band. Even though Tsuchiya is on the left, he ended up marrying the singer for that band, Karin Amamiya, who has since emerged as a spokesperson for disaffected Japanese youth in the media. The New God won an award at the 1999 Yamagata International Documentary Film Festival. His next work, Peep \\"TV\\" Show, was a fictional post-9/11 tale of numbed young people seeking the \\"real\\" on a violent, voyeuristic internet site. Eight years passed before he made his next film, GFP Bunny, which won the award for best film in the Japanese Eyes section at the 2012 Tokyo International Film Festival.

In 1906, Hortonville graduated its first senior class, which consisted of 17 students. During this time, athletic events were held at the Hortonville Community Hall and Opera House, where due to the temperature of the facility, the teams earned the nickname \\"Polar Bears\\".http://www.hasd.org/schools/hs/HHS%20Centennial%20Book%202005.pdf In 1953, the Hortonville Union High School District was formed which consolidated the existing high school with the surrounding rural school districts. The high school relocated to its current location in 1956. In 1962, an addition to the building connected the high school to the elementary and middle schools located to the north. At this time, the separate elementary and high school districts were combined and the high school was renamed Hortonville High School. Major additions occurred in 1965, 1976 and 1984, during which time the building housed the entire district.http://www.hasd.org/schools/hs/HHS%20Centennial%20Book%202005.pdf Since 1991, five elementary and middle school buildings were constructed within the district, with the vacated space in the original building being converted after extensive remodeling into high school use.

The school's football field underwent renovations in 2018. =1974 Teachers' strike= During the 1974 school year, teachers belonging to the Hortonville Education Association, a teachers union, went on strike following months of unsuccessful contract negotiations with the school board. At this time, strikes by teachers were illegal under state law. The strike received national attention as the 84 striking teachers were replaced by strikebreakers and classes resumed, a move that was unprecedented at the time. Thousands of union activists convened on Hortonville to join the picket lines, which led to political unrest within the community. The case ultimately went to the United States Supreme Court.http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,911300-1,00.html The union claimed that the disciplinary hearings held by the Hortonville Board of Education were prejudiced because of the board's role as the bargaining unit for the district. In a 6-3 decision authored by Chief Justice Warren E.

The plants at Westminster were moved to Chelsea in 1676. Great Gate of the Physic Garden, Oxford Petersfield Physic Garden A physic garden is a type of herb garden with medicinal plants. Botanical gardens developed from them. History Modern botanical gardens were preceded by medieval physic gardens that originated at the time of Emperor Charlemagne. Gardens of this time included various sections including one for medicinal plants called the or . Pope Nicholas V set aside part of the Vatican grounds in 1447 for a garden of medicinal plants that were used to promote the teaching of botany, and this was a forerunner to the academic botanical gardens at Padua and Pisa established in the 1540s. Certainly the founding of many early botanic gardens was instigated by members of the medical profession. The naturalist William Turner established physic gardens at Cologne, Wells, and Kew; he also wrote to Lord Burleigh recommending that a physic garden be established at Cambridge University with himself at its head. The 1597 Herball, or Generall Historie of Plantes by herbalist John Gerard was said to be the catalogue raisonn√© of physic gardens, both public and private, which were instituted throughout Europe. It listed 1,030 plants found in his physic garden at Holborn, and was the first such catalogue printed. The garden in Oxford, founded by Henry Danvers, 1st Earl of Danby, with Jacob Bobart the Elder as Superintendent, dates to 1632. Begun in Westminster and later moved to Chelsea, the Apothecaries founded the Chelsea Physic Garden in 1673, of which Philip Miller, author of The Gardeners Dictionary, was the most notable Director. By 1676, the position of \\"Keeper of the Physic Garden\\" was held by the Professor of Botany at the University of Edinburgh.

Career  Schoen currently serves on the Advisory Council of Represent.Us, a nonpartisan anti-corruption organization. It was reported in 2019 that he joined Mike Bloomberg's exploratory 2020 presidential campaign as a pollster.Costa, Robert, = Consulting work = While still at Harvard, Schoen first worked as an independent political consultant for Louis Gigante, who ran for New York City Council in 1973. In 1977, he founded the political consulting firm Penn, Schoen & Berland with political strategists Mark Penn. Michael Berland joined the firm in 1987. Schoen worked for the political campaigns of politicians including Jay Rockefeller, Richard Shelby and Evan Bayh. Following the 1994 United States elections, President Bill Clinton hired Dick Morris, who brought on Schoen and Penn. Schoen worked on the 1996 campaign as well in survey analysis. Schoen also began doing corporate work beginning in the 1980s. In 2000, Ukrainian steel oligarch Victor Pinchuk hired Schoen on a $40,000 per month retainer. In 2004, Schoen introduced Pinchuk to Hillary Clinton. He also did work for the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2008 and later became associated with the People United Means Action movement of disaffected Clinton supporters who refused to support Barack Obama.Benen, Steve, \\"Clinton pollster urges senator to go relentlessly negative\\" , Salon.com, April 16, 2008.Greenwald, Glenn, \\"Douglas Schoen and Hillary's slimy pollsters\\", Salon.com, September 27, 2008.

Schoen left the firm later to work for news media. In 2010, Schoen hosted a fundraiser for Republican congressional candidate John Gomez. Pinchuk donated $13.1 million to the Clinton Foundation in the years after Schoen's introduction. In 2011, Schoen registered as a foreign agent lobbying on behalf of Pinchuk. Between September 2011 and November 2012, Schoen arranged nearly a dozen meetings between Pinchuk and senior State Department officials, including Melanne Verveer. In September 2015, Pinchuk donated $150,000 to the Donald J. Trump Foundation in exchange for a 20-minute video appearance by Donald Trump shown at a policy conference that year in Kiev. Michael Cohen solicited Schoen for the donation from Pinchuk, which was the largest outside donation the Trump Foundation received that year. In March 2017, former Trump aide Monica Crowley registered as a foreign agent working for Pinchuk under Schoen's direction. = Media = Schoen became a political analyst for Fox News and a columnist for Newsmax. In 2010, he authored a book on the Tea Party movement with Scott Rasmussen.

Retrieved 2020-04-02.  Views  Schoen has identified as a member of the Democratic party, but has frequently criticized the party and taken positions on various political topics at odds with the party's views. Schoen's critics have called his identification as a Democrat \\"phony\\" and calculated to help his Fox News career. Steve Benen called Schoen the quintessential \\"Fox News Democrat\\" and said he is \\"actively hostile towards [Democrats] and the party‚Äôs agenda.\\" Schoen says that lower taxes would be a successful Democratic strategy, opposed President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act, and said that President Obama should not run for reelection in 2012.

Pyg was created by Grant Morrison and Andy Kubert, and debuted as a corpse in the alternate reality story Batman #666 (July 2007) before being introduced as a recurring character in the mainstream DC Universe two years later in Batman and Robin #1 (June 2009). Professor Pyg was re-introduced following DC's The New 52 comics relaunch in 2011, appearing throughout the continuity and the subsequent DC Rebirth relaunch that began in 2016. The character's in-world real name is Lazlo Valentin, a scientist who suffered a schizophrenic breakdown that led him to become a supervillain who wears a pig mask. Morrison intended Pyg to seem disconnected from reality, believing him to be one of the \\"weirdest, most insane\\" characters in Batman comic books. Pyg is an obsessive perfectionist who sees human beings as broken individuals; he commonly kidnaps people and uses surgery and chemicals to permanently change them into mind-controlled automatons known as Dollotrons, and sometimes into human‚Äìanimal hybrids instead. Morrison took the name \\"Professor Pig\\" from the song \\"Pygmalism\\" by Momus and Kahimi Karie; the name \\"Pyg\\" is also being shorthand for \\"Pygmalion\\", referring both to the mythical sculptor who fell in love with his own creation and the 1913 stage play, both of which serving as parallels for Lazlo Valentin and his love for his Dollotron creations. The character's origin story alludes to real-life animal testing carried out in the mid-twentieth century. He has a makeshift mother made of nails and boards, from which he associates auditory hallucinations commanding him to constantly improve his surgical work. Pyg began making substantial appearances in other media in 2013 with the animated series Beware the Batman and has since appeared in video games, television, and film. The character has been received by entertainment journalists as a strange and disturbing addition to Batman's list of enemies. Publication history =Creation and debut= Writer Grant Morrison stated a new Batman villain must have \\"a gimmick. Creepiness. A distinctive look ... You kind of evolve those themes into new forms\\". Professor Pyg and his mind-controlled Dollotrons first appeared as crucified corpses in the 2007 story Batman in Bethlehem by Morrison and artist Andy Kubert, published in Batman #666 by DC Comics. The story is set in a future in which Bruce Wayne's son Damian helms the Batman vigilante persona. Although Morrison had developed a detailed backstory for Pyg, he was unsure the character would be used again. The name \\"Professor Pyg\\" originates from the song \\"Pygmalism\\" written by Momus for Kahimi Karie, \\"Pyg\\" being shorthand for Pygmalion. The first storyline of the Batman and Robin series that ran from June to August 2009 saw the character's debut in the main DC Universe. The storyline, titled Batman Reborn, focuses on Dick Grayson, who takes over the Batman mantle after Bruce Wayne is pronounced dead and partners with a younger Damian Wayne, who is now Robin. In the story, Lazlo Valentin was an \\"extreme\\" circus mob boss until something turned him into Professor Pyg, leading him to begin funding his scientific experiments by selling narcotics to the criminal underworld. Batman and Robin learn from interrogating his underlings, members of a gang called the Circus of Strange, that Pyg is planning to spread a mind- control virus across Gotham City to hold the population for ransom. Pyg is stopped and placed in Blackgate Penitentiary but medics cannot save his infected minions known as Dollotrons. =Return and expanded backstory= Batman and Robin #13, published in July 2010, marked Professor Pyg's return as part of the Batman and Robin Must Die storyline. Pyg had been working for the supervillain Doctor Simon Hurt during the events of Batman Reborn and a virus has contaminated the population without Batman (Dick Grayson) or the public realizing it. Grayson discovers this as the virus becomes active. He is swarmed by a mob of infected people in the city streets. Pyg uses the virus as a diversion to escape Blackgate Penitentiary. The following issue focuses on Professor Pyg's business relationship with Doctor Hurt, who says he has \\"challenged [Pyg] to outline his personal vision for Gotham\\". As the virus spreads across the city, riots occur under Hurt's command. The story concludes with Bruce Wayne returning to stop Doctor Hurt after being trapped in the timestream. The infected civilians are quarantined and Professor Pyg is captured and transferred to Arkham Asylum. The character's backstory, including his origin, is significantly expanded upon in Batman Incorporated: Leviathan Strikes! (December 2011). Lazlo Valentin was a scientist working for a corrupt United Nations agency known as Spyral and was driven insane by a product that he was developing, which mimics some effects of Alzheimer's disease. Lazlo develops paranoid schizophrenia, leading to drug abuse and self-inflicted surgeries that turn him into Professor Pyg. Lazlo fathered a son named Janosz Valentin, who serves the criminal organization Leviathan and claimed his father taught him to be immune to pain. =The New 52= In September 2011, DC Comics rebooted their line of comic books under the New 52 banner, establishing a new continuity while keeping landmark stories intact. This timeline's iteration of Professor Pyg, still Lazlo Valentin, was introduced in Batman #1 (September 2011) among other established Batman villains during an escape riot at Arkham Asylum, which was thwarted by Batman (Wayne) and Nightwing (Grayson). He continued to make cameo appearances as an Arkham Asylum inmate in later comics. In the storyline Forever Evil, the inmates of Arkham Asylum and Blackgate Penitentiary battle for control of Gotham. Pyg and his Dollotrons briefly gain control over a district of the city but are usurped by Bane. He is later forced by Scarecrow to ingest the steroid Venom to combat the usurper. In October 2013, a prequel to Batman in Bethlehem titled Damian: Son of Batman, in which an older Damian Wayne succeeds his father as Batman, was written by Andy Kubert under the New 52 imprint. Having plotted the mini-series in 2008, Kubert wanted to return to that timeline, saying, \\"I had always wanted to write. In talking with editor Mike Marts, he suggested I come up with a mini-series I would like to write and draw. I really loved that Batman and the whole world that Grant [Morrison] dreamed up. So I thought it would be fun to do a story of how Damian actually becomes that #666 Batman.\\" An aging Pyg appears in the second issue and his henchmen in the third. Batman (Damian) attempts to stop him from experimenting on kidnapped children but Pyg's Dollotrons expel Batman from the area. Pyg is never caught. The character plays a larger role in the first volume of the weekly series Batman Eternal, which ran from April to August 2014, beginning with a brief confrontation with Batman in the first issue. Carmine Falcone attempts to take over Gotham City's criminal underworld, initiating a gang war with Penguin. To provide a distraction, Falcone frames Batman for the destruction of Professor Pyg's laboratory. Angry his work has been destroyed, Pyg sends his remaining Dollotrons to assault Batman, who persuades Pyg that Falcone was responsible. Pyg retaliates by destroying the laboratory of one of Falcone's paid scientists. He later turns several people into human‚Äìanimal hybrids, whom he labels his \\"farm hands\\", and finds Falcone. After the farm hands kill Falcone's guards, Pyg straps Falcone to a table with the intention of operating on him but Batman intervenes. He is arrested and sent to Arkham Asylum under the supervision of Dr. Achilles Milo. In Convergence, the New 52 crosses over with the previous iteration of the DC Universe, during which Pyg's pre-New 52 counterpart is killed. Pyg is also featured in a chapter of the anthology digital comic series Sensation Comics, featuring Wonder Woman. During Robin War, a crossover between several Robin-related publications published from December 2015 to January 2016, Pyg uses an abandoned theatre for his criminal activities while working for the supervillain Brother Blood. Pyg escaped a confrontation with the Teen Titans. =Debut in other media= Professor Pyg, voiced by Brian George, became a recurring villain in the 2013 animated series Beware the Batman, which was intended to focus on lesser-known members of Batman's rogues' gallery to set it apart from previous Batman television shows. He appears alongside Mister Toad (Udo Kier), a humanoid toad, as eco-terrorists who hunt people for what they deem to be crimes against the animal kingdom. Pyg is still portrayed as a surgeon, transforming his victims into human‚Äìanimal hybrids. The character later appeared in a side quest of the 2015 video game Batman: Arkham Knight, in which he is voiced by Dwight Schultz. Pyg is described as \\"a gifted scientist who suffered a schizophrenic break\\" that caused him to develop his persona. In the game, Pyg uses his Circus of Strange business as a front for abducting people to turn into Dollotrons. After leaving behind a trail of corpses of failed experiments, Pyg is investigated and apprehended in a confrontation with Batman, the player character. Pyg also made minor appearances in the animated series Batman: The Brave and the Bold and the video game Injustice 2. Lazlo Valentin played by Michael Cerveris makes his live-action debut in the fourth season of the television series Gotham. The character is introduced under his Professor Pyg alias as a vigilante who slaughters corrupt policemen and dresses their corpses with pigs' heads. Executive producer Bryan Wynbrandt described him as the \\"big villain\\" of the first half of the season. The character's modus operandi later expands; he targets the wealthy, who he claims \\"fed on the poor of Gotham\\". Police captain James Gordon learns \\"Professor Pyg\\" is a persona used by Valentin, a contract murderer who impersonates serial killers. He is hired by crime figure Sofia Falcone in a conspiracy to turn the corrupt police against kingpin Oswald Cobblepot and usurp his criminal empire. Falcone kills Valentin to keep the conspiracy quiet. =DC Rebirth and introduction in film= In May 2016, DC Comics again relaunched their entire line of comic books under the DC Rebirth brand, restoring elements of the DC Universe that were erased under the New 52 while maintaining the continuity. Pyg re-appears in 2017's Nightwing #18, operating in Paris and creating Dollotron versions of Grayson and Damian Wayne, known as Deathwing and Robintron. Grayson and Wayne overcome Pyg, who tells them he created Deathwing and Robintron for Simon Hurt. He later appears in Harley Quinn #43-44 and Batgirl and the Birds of Prey. He appears again in Batwoman #11, in which Batwoman saves her ally Julia Pennyworth from Pyg after Alice leaks her secret identity to him. Professor Pyg is among the villains who feature in the intercompany crossover The Shadow/Batman, in which Batman and The Shadow team up to combat a conspiracy. Pyg makes his film debut voiced by James Urbaniak in the 2018 animated film Suicide Squad: Hell to Pay, in which he is depicted as an underground surgeon-for-hire for supervillains. In the limited series Doomsday Clock, a sequel to the seminal 1986 Watchmen, Pyg is among the supervillains who attend an underground meeting held by Riddler. In a story in DC's 2018 Halloween anthology Cursed Comics Cavalcade, Damian Wayne teams up with the zombie Solomon Grundy against Professor Pyg, after he kidnaps a group of children. In January 2019, the Mister Miracle creative team Tom King and Mitch Geralds reunited for Batman #62, which was promoted as a \\"special issue\\". Pyg holds Batman captive, as he recalls the mythical Pygmalion and considers how he psychologically mirrors Pyg. Characterization and symbolism Professor Pyg is usually characterized in comic books as someone who is suffering from severe mental illness. Co-creator Grant Morrison envisioned him as \\"one of the weirdest, most insane characters that's ever been in Batman [comics]\\" and said, \\"we hear a lot about Batman facing crazy villains but we tried to make this guy seem genuinely disturbed and disconnected ... Professor Pyg isn't from another world; he's from here, but he's very, very sick\\". Taking inspiration from the works of David Lynch, Morrison wanted the visuals in Batman Reborn, illustrated by Frank Quitely, to feel like a real world crossing over with a world of schizophrenia, paranoia, and the use of narcotics. He stated when Batman and Robin are facing Pyg and his Dollotrons, they are dealing with \\"the eerie, creepy, mentally-ill dark corners of life\\". The character uses drugs, lobotomy, and doll masks permanently molded onto people's faces to turn them into genderless Dollotrons, which he believes are perfected human beings. The name Pyg is a shortening of Pygmalion, George Bernard Shaw's play that was adapted into the musical My Fair Lady starring Rex Harrison, which tells the story of a professor's attempt to convert a street urchin into an educated, high-society woman. According to Morrison, \\"Movie enthusiasts will know that Rex Harrison also played Doctor Doolittle, who by strange coincidence was famed for teaching barnyard animals to speak proper, so our Professor Pyg mixes all these characteristics and influences together to create a monster who wants to make everything and everyone 'perfect,' as he sees it\\". On the DC Comics website, journalist Meg Downey notes parallels between Professor Pyg's view of his Dollotrons and the Greek mythological figure Pygmalion, who carved a statue of a woman out of ivory that was so realistic and beautiful he fell in love with his creation. Morrison referred to the character's experiments to force biology to conform to his will as an \\"attempt to dominate and redefine the feminine principle\\", comparing it to the wire mother experiments performed by psychologist Harry Harlow on infant monkeys and to the proto-mother mythologies of Mesopotamia and ancient Babylon: \\"The shattered mind of Lazlo Valentin has mashed all of these connections into a frightening personal 'mythos', constructed to justify his deranged activities as Professor Pyg\\". Morrison also said Pyg's deranged rants in Batman and Robin Must Die allude to animal experimentation carried out in the US in the mid-twentieth century, including Harlow and John B. Calhoun's Rockville barn rat population research, which collectively influenced the character's origin story. In the comics, Pyg has a makeshift mother constructed from boards and nails from which auditory hallucinations continuously compel him to improve his work. In Batman #62, Bruce Wayne compares Pyg's love for his work to his own fixation with vigilantism, having built up his ideals and philosophies since he witnessed his parents being murdered as a boy. Pyg was adapted differently from the comics in the television series Beware the Batman; developer Glen Murakami said, \\"it's not like we're trying to change it, but we only have 22 minutes to tell that story. The theme that we went in with Pyg and Toad was kind of Wind in the Willows, but they also became like a twisted [Sherlock] Holmes and Watson. It felt like it flowed, it felt like it had a theme. That seemed more important for that to track rather than all the backstory.\\" Chris Sims of the journalism website ComicsAlliance said the changes are \\"about as far from melting people's faces, stripping in front of a wire mother and dosing Gotham City with a psychotropic drug as you're likely to get\\". According to Comic Book Resources writer Kieran Shiach, the Arkham Knight iteration is a very accurate facsimile of the original comic book portrayal, the major difference being the character's new enthusiasm for opera music. Pyg's in-game attributes label him a perfectionist and an amateur opera vocalist. Before his confrontation with Batman, during which Pyg describes his surgical operations as \\"fixing\\" his victims who are unique and broken, Batman is warned by Alfred Pennyworth that Pyg is \\"unhinged, even by Gotham's standards\\". After Pyg's capture, he claims his mutilated victims are works of art, and while in a police lockup, he expresses concern for how they are being treated. In the television series Gotham, Lazlo Valentin is portrayed as a contract killer who impersonates other serial killers. He creates an elaborate persona of a murderer under the Professor Pyg alias to aid Sofia Falcone's rise to power in Gotham City's criminal underworld. Actor Michael Cerveris said of the faux persona, \\"Professor Pyg is a brilliant and chameleon-like person who has a highly developed sense of what's right and wrong‚Äîit just might not be a sense of right and wrong that corresponds with everybody else's\\". Executive producer John Stephens said the character was chosen for the show because \\"He hits that sweet spot of being grotesque and terrifying, but also a little bit in that fairy-tale-esque world\\". Cerveris said Pyg takes delight in his actions and sees himself as a mirror image to James Gordon, who also wants to end corruption in the Gotham City Police Department. Pyg spells his name with a \\"y\\" as an homage to Pygmalion and because he wants to remake Gotham City in his own image. He also wants to make Gordon into a better version of himself; according to Cerveris, \\"He is almost looking at Gordon as an ally, like 'I'm on your side, Jim'. And Jim is saying, 'No, you're actually a sociopath'. So it works in many ways as a seduction on Pyg's part as he tries to pull (Jim) in.\\" In early episodes of Gotham, Pyg claims to have suffered at the hands of Gotham City's elite, implying a troubled past for the Pyg persona and a vengeful motive. Cerveris stated Pyg is aware of his actions but may not be comfortable with himself, which may be partly because he is covering his true identity. Layers of his disguise are continuously stripped down and reapplied. Hailing from the southern United States, Valentin uses implanted, shifting metal plates and facial reconstruction to help him hide his true identity. Before the Pyg persona is revealed to be fake, Cerveris said he lacks his alter ego's trademark surgical prowess because it was intended to focus more on his relationship with the city and James Gordon, and that the Dollotrons are not the sole purpose of his existence. Cerveris also said the Dollotrons might be a later part of Valentin's life because the show is about the origins of the Batman mythos. Design Professor Pyg's traditional pig mask was adapted into one more resembling the flesh of a pig that, according to Michael Cerveris, gave it a more disturbing and comedic quality. Professor Pyg most commonly wears a pig mask, a makeshift surgical outfit, and a butcher's apron. Much of his original wardrobe in the comic books was designed by Frank Quitely and is a homage to the Edwardian suits worn by Rex Harrison in My Fair Lady. The television series Gotham was planned feature a pig mask that more closely resembled the comic book version but it was deemed \\"a little too cheery and pink\\". Executive producer Danny Cannon decided the mask should look like decapitated pig flesh. Cerveris found the change to be simultaneously comical and disturbing; he had some difficulty acting in the mask due to its weight and the heat underneath, and because it blocked his peripheral vision. According to Cerveris, \\"the mask is a really freeing aspect, and I felt naked when I didn't have the mask on, and couldn't really be Professor Pyg\\". Pyg retains his apron from the source material. Merchandise Professor Pyg's opera suite titled \\"Ode to Perfection\\" was composed by David Buckley for the Batman: Arkham Knight soundtrack. An action figure of the character was released as part of the third series of Arkham Knight figures from DC Collectibles in February 2016. Critical response Meg Downey said Professor Pyg is one of Batman's most disturbing villains. In 2015, IGN writers Jesse Schedeen and Joshua Yehl ranked Professor Pyg as the twenty-third-greatest Batman villain of all time and in a separate editorial, Schedeen called Pyg \\"one of the crazier and more unusual\\" Batman villains created by Grant Morrison. Beth Elderkin of io9 called the character \\"one of the weirdest villains to come out of the Batman canon\\" while Bustle referred to him as \\"one of the comics' modern masterpieces, and one of its most horrifying creations\\". David Pepose of Newsarama praised the inclusion of Professor Pyg and Jason Bard in Batman Eternal for emphasizing elements of the DC Universe that were underused following the New 52. Comic Book Resources's Mike Fugere said the character is a \\"bigger monster\\" than Solomon Grundy, an undead creature within the DC Universe who Fugere calls \\"terrifying\\". He cited the comic book Cursed Comics Cavalcade #1 as his reason, a story in which Grundy tries to stop Pyg from mutilating a group of children. According to Fugere, Pyg is \\"basically Hannibal Lecter on steroids and is a reminder that not all superhero comics are for kids\\". He also said Grant Morrison accomplished his goal of making Pyg one of the weirdest and most insane characters in Batman comic books. In 2017, John Stephens said Professor Pyg is one of his favorite recently-created Batman villains for being demented, grotesque, and funny. Because the character was created recently, he also said Pyg is more contemporary than the classic rogues and did not have to be revitalized as much. When it was announced Professor Pyg would appear on Gotham, Digital Spy commented, \\"Gotham season 4 is going to introduce its most disturbing villain ever, so forget about sleeping ever again\\". Charlie Ridgely of Comicbook.com stated Pyg's appearance on Gotham proved he is \\"one of the most disturbed\\" villains who has served as an antagonist to Batman.

Ayres (July 1838 ‚Äì 31 July 1913) was a British-born South African ornithologist. Ayres is commemorated in the names of the Ayres' hawk-eagle (Hieraaetus ayresii), Ayres' cisticola (Cisticola ayresii), and the white- winged flufftail (Sarothura ayresi). Early life and career Ayres was born in Hereford, England, to John Ayres, the mayor of Hereford, and Helene Duschesne in July 1828. He and his family emigrated to Natal as part of the great influx of British settlers to South Africa in 1850. Two years later, Ayres joined a group of colonists departing for the gold fields of Australia, but was unsuccessful and returned to Natal a few years later to farm in what is now the Pinetown district, just inland of Durban. The scientific name of the white-winged flufftail (pictured) honours Ayres; he discovered the species near Potchefstroom. Natal period Ayres became one of the colonists in Natal who augmented their incomes by collecting and preparing items of natural history, which were sold to ardent and often well-funded naturalists in western Europe. Most new bird species shot by Ayres were named by Dr. K. J. G. Hartlaub of Bremen in Germany. Some of the species named by Hartlaub on Ayres's specimens were from the Port Natal area or just inland, including the ashy flycatcher, Muscicapa (Alseonax) caerulescens, and the green twinspot. Ayres shot the type of the elusive forest-dwelling orange thrush, Turdus (Zoothera) gurneyi, in Town Bush, Pietermaritzburg, and was instrumental in obtaining the type of Gurney's sugarbird, Promerops gurneyi, somewhere in Natal, which was described by Jules Verreaux in 1871. Ayres's main patron was John Henry Gurney Sr., of Norwich, England, who consulted Hartlaub on taxonomy. Gurney disposed some of his material to R. Bowdler Sharpe of the British Museum (Natural History), in South Kensington, London, and others. Transvaal period In 1865 Thomas and his brother Jack moved to the Transvaal, where they farmed, panned for gold, brewed and collected birds for sale. He and his brother also hunted and traded with the Boer settlers. He settled down at Potchefstroom, where he ultimately died. Here he did much to encourage the young Austin Roberts, who was to become a well-known zoologist. The slaty egret and white-winged crake, S. ayresi, were new species that he obtained in this region.

Within just a few minutes the fire caused the collapse of a roof section which fell on the children, infants and employees below. One of the first responders on the scene reported that all children were unconscious or dead and there were no sounds of children crying. Firefighters took two hours to contain the blaze. \\"They told me that this happened in a matter of five minutes,\\" said Hermosillo Mayor Ernesto G√°ndara. \\"According to what our people saw, there was an explosion followed immediately by flames,\\" reported Daniel Karam, the director of the Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS). \\"We began to smell smoke and the alarm went off. But it was explosive and there was no chance to get more children out,\\" stated Mar√≠a Adriana Gasca Sandoval, a daycare aide. Over 142 children were attending the day care center at the time of the blaze, according to Sonora Governor Eduardo Bours, \\"There were 142 children in the nursery, 35 have died, and another 41 are hospitalized.\\" The daycare center had passed an inspection on May 26, the week prior to the blaze. The number of enrolled children, 142 as well as the 6 staff members providing care for them were also within the approved ratio of caregiver to children for day care centers. Reports two days after the blaze revealed, however, that although the warehouse had windows, they were mounted too high and did not provide access to the daycare center for rescue operations. A fire department officer unofficially reported that the converted warehouse building had only one operational exit. One mother claimed a second exit was locked and the key could not be found. A desperate passerby, Francisco Manuel Lopez Villaescusa, drove his Silverado truck through the walls to gain entrance and knocked three holes into the building. By Sunday, Sonora state Health Minister Raymundo L√≥pez Vucovich announced, \\"In the past few hours three more have died. Twelve of the 22 hospitalized children are in a dangerous condition.\\" Subsequent hospital care Many of the injured were cared for in hospitals in Guadalajara, Jalisco. Although 15 medical specialists were flown in to treat the victims, some children were moved to hospitals in other cities in the state of Jalisco which had doctors with specialties in children's burns. One boy could not be moved for further treatment as he has been declared brain dead. Two children were taken to a Shriner's burn hospital in Sacramento, California, USA, for treatment. \\"A lot of it is how deep the burn is and where it's located and how bad is the smoke inhalation,\\" said Dr. Tina Palmieri, assistant chief of burns for the hospital. She reported that there was only a 50 per cent chance of survival for one of the three-year-old girls who sustained burns to over 80 per cent of her body. This girl was accompanied by her father and arrived in California by Mexican military transport. Her mother, who had herself been working in the day care center, was taken to a Ciudad Obreg√≥n hospital after pulling her daughter and several other children out of the fire. The second patient, a young boy, began a series of skin graft surgeries on Sunday June 7, reported Dr. David Greenhalgh, chief of burn treatment at the Sacramento hospital. Both of these patients were listed in critical condition, monitored for infection, and unable to talk because breathing tubes had been inserted. In the aftermath Sonora state Health Minister Raymundo L√≥pez Vucovich issued updates. He reported that some of the hospitalized children had been suffering from kidney failure due to severe loss of body fluids caused by the burns. Others in the hospital had respiratory symptoms from smoke inhalation. The burns on some of the victims were so bad authorities had problems identifying them. Javier Alexis Pacheco, aged two, was rushed to the hospital for treatment for burn injuries. There were communication mishaps, however. Four-year-old Herm√°n V√°squez, with burns on 75 per cent of his body, was rushed to Ch√°vez Hospital but his family did not find out where he was until 6 p.m. that evening. Remembrances of victims \\"Anti monument\\" to victims in front of Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social central offices. It was installed on June 5, 2017 by victim's families. Deaths occurred from smoke inhalation, burns, and trauma from the roof collapse. Stories of the victims appeared in news stories. Camila, a three- year-old girl perished in the fire from asphyxiation. Mar√≠a, Julio, F√°tima, Carlos, Sof√≠a and Dafne were among the 41 pre-schoolers who were mourned at several funeral ceremonies that took place on the Saturday following the blaze. The parents of two-year-old Mar√≠a Magdalena Mill√°n, among those buried Saturday, attached a Dora the Explorer balloon to the cross marking her grave, while her mother cried out, \\"I love you and I don't want to leave you here!\\" Germ√°n Le√≥n battled his injuries, but died Saturday morning, just days after his fourth birthday. The family of 2-year-old Daniel Alberto Goyzueta Cabanillas, who died of smoke inhalation, held a funeral late Saturday afternoon for the boy. The family of 2-year-old Camila Fuentes Cervera also held her funeral Saturday. Grief and bereavement Pope Benedict XVI sent a telegram to Archbishop of Hermosillo Jos√© Ulises Mac√≠as Salcedo offering his condolences, \\"Together with spiritual closeness, concern, and wishes for a speedy and total recovery of those injured in the lamentable incident....With these sentiments, the Supreme Pontiff, in these moments of sadness, imparts from the heart the comfort of an apostolic blessing, as a sign of comfort and hope in the Risen Lord.\\" Mexican President Calder√≥n stated, ‚ÄúI want to express in the name of the federal government, of all Mexicans and of me personally, our condolences to the mothers and fathers for this tragic accident.‚Äù Neighbors conducted a candlelight vigil the morning of June 7 at the University of Sonora in Hermosillo. Day care center ownership The ABC daycare was federally funded but privately operated. The government's Social Security Institute provided a contact for operation. Two state officials resigned in the aftermath of the incident but were not arrested. Their two wives co-owned the daycare center.  Investigation  President Felipe Calder√≥n placed federal attorney general Eduardo Medina-Mora in charge of the investigation to ascertain the cause of the fire. The President visited the scene and was said to be \\"enormously saddened.\\" \\"This has been a painful tragedy for all Mexicans. I have ordered the federal prosecutor to as soon as possible carry out investigations to help us know exactly what and how it happened, and to work out corresponding responsibility,\\" said Calder√≥n. The investigation determined that the cause of the fire was a malfunctioning of the air conditioning unit in the neighboring warehouse. Also, the warehouse was not equipped with fire extinguishers or smoke alarms. \\"The fire was caused by the overheating of an air conditioner due to continuous and prolonged use,\\" said Attorney-General Eduardo Medina Mora. The air conditioner melted its aluminum housing and spread to license plates and paper work in the state government warehouse. The warehouse was closed and empty when the fire started. There were later suspicions that the warehouse fire was started intentionally. The investigation revealed that the child care center's fire alarms did not alert staff to the fire because they were installed below a brightly colored ceiling tarpaulin. It is believed that smoke filled the area between the warehouse's high roof and the false ceiling created by the tarp. When the tarp caught fire, smoke and flames collapsed onto the slumbering daycare infants and instantly filled the daycare with thick smoke. Investigations further revealed that in 2005 the day care center owners had been advised to remove the tarp, widen the main entrance, and increase auxiliary fire exits to bring them up to fire regulation size. Subsequent safety inspections passed without the work being carried out and contracts were re-awarded for the continued operation of the center. The center was not equipped with water sprinklers which would have automatically engaged in the event of a fire. A marked emergency exit was bolted shut and one mother at the child care reported that no one was able to obtain the key. Hermosillo Fire Department Chief Mart√≠n Lugo reported that, although the facility had recently passed a safety inspection, the fire alarms for the building were not installed correctly. Parents stated that although the daycare had 20 on staff, only six were on duty on the Friday of the blaze. In addition, the center was set up for pre-school children aged two to four, but Governor Bours had reported that younger infants were being cared for in the center. \\"We always have to be open to improvements, especially when we have a tragedy that has so moved us,\\" said director Karam of the Social Security Institute, who admitted that their security requirements may need to be overhauled in light of the fact that the daycare passed safety inspection on May 26. Aftermath Fourteen northern Sonora state finance department officials came under investigation and seven were arrested in connection with the fire for negligent homicide. \\"They are employees and officials with the Finance Department who have a direct responsibility for the warehouse where the fire started.\\" The state Finance Department filed a negligence civil lawsuit against the day care owners and the Social Security Institute. The highest official in the Social Security Institute resigned and others were suspended. Delia Irene Botello Amante, the last person imprisoned for the incident, was released from jail in Hermosillo on January 1, 2014. In September 2016 it came to light that the alleged letter sent to the daycare center in 2005 had been falsified by state officials in an attempt to divert attention from the government, since the fire had actually began in an adjacent warehouse used by the state ministry of finance to store documents. A theory that was investigated was that the fire was intentionally started in the warehouse with the purpose of destroying potential evidence of excessive debts incurred by Eduardo Bours during his term as governor. A federal judge ordered the Sonora Attorney General's office to launch an investigation into both Bours and his former Attorney General Abel Murrieta Guti√©rrez for document falsification as well as altering the scene of the crime. The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS) sue Bours on May 22, 2019 for negligence in the investigation of the fire.

Due to Oxford's vicinity to much of the war, many buildings in town and on campus were utilized by forces, including the observatory which served as a hospital. In addition, Chancellor Barnard, a northerner, resigned and left Oxford. However, it was the former chancellor's relationship with General William Tecumseh Sherman that spared both the observatory and the university from Union troops burning it down.

He has been credited with making the first computer graphics, utilizing an oscilloscope as the creation medium for abstract art. In 1953 he released what he called \\"Oscillons\\" (or oscillogram designs) along with a corresponding thesis entitled \\"Electronic Abstractions\\" via a gallery exhibition of fifty pictures of the same name at Sanford Museum in Cherokee. Laposky is often credited as the pioneer for electronic art, more specifically in the analog vector medium. Early life He was born September 30, 1914 on a farm south of Cherokee to Peter Paul and Leona Anastasia (Gabriel) Laopsky. His siblings were named George and Raymond. At age four, his family relocated to Colorado Springs, Colorado. In 1931, Laposky's mother died.Uncredited/Undated report from Cherokee County Archives \\"CA-22\\" In 1932, Laposky graduated from St. Mary's High School and shortly thereafter, the family returned to Cherokee, where he began working as a sign painter and draftsman.George Shane, \\"Laposky Deals in Big Figures\\", Des Moines Sunday Register, Aug 18, 1946  Career  = Military service = Laposky joined the United States Army and was inducted into Fort Des Moines in 1942. He scored 134 in his army general classifications test, which placed him up in the upper give percent of what the army classified as \\"the ability to learn rapidly\\"; his mechanical aptitude test was 145. He was sent overseas with the 43rd Infantry division headquarters general staff section (G-3) assigned as a map draftsman (T-4). As a technical sergeant, he was wounded in the right foot during a Japanese bombing raid at Rendona Island, Solomon Islands, (New Georgia Munda airfield campaign) in July 1943 (for which he received the Purple Heart). He spent 10 months in army hospitals in New Zealand and Alabama. He was discharged with disability in May 1944 after two years of service, returning to his home in Cherokee, Iowa. = Art = Laposky returned to his original work, but was no longer able to climb ladders as is required by a sign painter, so he focused on lettering smaller cards and draftsman and student of mathematics, providing many Magic Number Squares to the Ripley's Believe it or Not! syndicated newspaper feature. He owned a sign shop in Iowa and dabbled in art in his spare time. Envisioning \\"painting with light\\".Alison Drain, \\"Laposky's Lights Make Visual Music\\" Symmetry Vol 4 Issue 3, pp 32-33 He took extension courses in elementary drafting from the University of Chicago. =Electronic Abstractions= In 1946, Laposky began working with photographic pendulum tracings and harmonograph machine patterns. In 1947, he read an article in Popular Science which proposed the use of television testing equipment, such as oscilloscopes, to generate simple decorative patterns, based on in formula similar to that which governs pendulum curves. This stoked his imagination and he began to investigate the proposal.\\"Andrew Kagan, \\"Ben F. Laposky: A Midwestern Pioneer of Amsolute Light Form\\", Arts Magazine, June 1980 In 1950, Laposky used a cathode ray oscilloscope with sine wave generators and various other electrical and electronic circuits to create abstract art, so called by the artist, \\"electrical compositions\\".Laposky, Electronic Abstractions, 1953 These electrical vibrations shown on the screen of the oscilloscope were then recorded using still photography. In later work he also incorporated motorized rotating filters of variable speed to color the patterns. Scripta Mathematica published the first Oscillon photographs in 1952. Laposky's work was featured in over 250 books, magazines, newspapers, advertising art work worldwide. An art portfolio in Fortune magazine in 1956 won a New York Art Directors Club gold medal for best editorial of the year. Laposky was interested in showing the designs or patterns based on natural forms, curves due to physical forces, or curves based on mathematical principles, such as various waveforms (sine-waves, square waves and Lissajous figures). According to the exhibit documentation, Laposky pointed out a parallel between his oscillons and music, the operator of an electronic setup playing a sort of \\"visual music\\". In 1952 Laposky displayed his work in a one- man show entitled \\"Electronic Abstractions\\" at Sanford Museum in Cherokee, Iowa. As a traveling exhibit, \\"Electronic Abstractions\\" was shown across the United States and in France at LeMons and other places by the Cultural Relations Section of the United States from 1952 to 1961. In total, Laposky's art was published more than 160 times and displayed at more than 200 exhibitions before the emergence of computer graphics upstaged him in the mid 1960s. Laposky cited and admired Naum Gabo, Joan Mir√≥, Piet Mondrian, Victor Vasarely, Kazimir Malevich, Fernand L√©ger, Marcel Duchamp, Alexander Calder and some of the Synchromism and Futurism artists.\\"Ben F. Laposky: A Midwestern Pioneer of Absolute Light Form\\", Andrew Kagan, Arts Magazine, June 1980 Some praise of the Oscillon work by Laposky: \\"The Oscillons are among the most sensually and spiritually exhilarating images of the entire history of human vision,\\". \\"The rhythm and balance in each piece reflect not only the artist‚Äôs vision but the ordered principles underlying the physical world.\\" Fred Camper, The Chicago Reader, August 2006http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/order-is- in-the-eye-of-the-beholder/Content?oid=923052 =Magic Squares= From 1934 through August 1946, Ripley's Believe It or Not! had printed 77 of Laposky's Magic Square number problems. In total 117 of Laposky's geometric number arrangements (\\"magics\\") were printed in the Believe it of Not newspaper feature. Laposky's work on these number matrices lead to his election for membership in the Mathematical Association of America in 1950. Laposky wrote about his magic square: \\"The crystallization in numbers of some small part of the beauty, harmony and rhythm or the universe.\\".\\"Sioux City Journal Sunday Magazine Section, Jan 24, 1937 It is likely that Laposky's early work in these Magic Squares and deeper introspection into their inner workings had profound influence on his latter work on Oscillons. Legacy Ben Laposky died in 2000 in Cherokee. His original one-man show of black and white Oscillons, along with 52 additional color images, is curated and controlled by the Salford Museum and Art Gallery. The museum's collection contains various commercial works and books in which Laposky was mentioned. None of the 10,000 negatives he claimed to have taken have ever been found, and only 101 mounted images of the original set of 102 remain. The original traveling show, along with some additional works, is maintained and periodically shown by the Sanford Museum and often travels to museums and universities internationally.

The song appears on the album's electric A-side, between \\"Outlaw Blues\\" and \\"Bob Dylan's 115th Dream\\". Like the rest of Bringing It All Back Home, \\"On the Road Again\\" was recorded in January, 1965 and produced by Tom Wilson. Musically, \\"On the Road Again\\" is a simple rhythm & blues rock number with a twelve-bar structure. The music is untidy, with a thrusting beat, harmonica breaks, and an opposing riff. Meaning The song's lyrics continue to address the myth of sensitive artist versus venal society that informs several other songs from A-side of the album, such as \\"Maggie's Farm\\", \\"Outlaw Blues\\", and \\"Bob Dylan's 115th Dream\\". The song also reflects other songs on the album, such as \\"Maggie's Farm\\" in that resistance to society is enacted through self-exile, removal and denial. This is particularly reflected in the lyrics: The song also previews the comic grotesques that will become more prominent on songs in later albums. The song reflects a paranoid version of dread of dealing with in-laws. The narrator wakes up in the morning and has to face a surreal world where his mother-in- law hides in the refrigerator, his father-in-law wears a mask of Napoleon and the grandfather-in-law's cane turns into a sword, the grandmother-in-law prays to pictures and an uncle-in-law steals from the narrator's pockets, in lyrics such as: Title inspiration The song's title echoes the title of Jack Kerouac's novel On the Road, which was a defining work of the Beat Generation. Dylan has acknowledged being influenced by Kerouac. However, it seems more likely that the title, and the song in itself, is a response to the song \\"On the Road\\", a traditional blues performed by the Memphis Jug Band with more serious lyrical content concerning an unfaithful woman.Memphis Jug Band References External links * Lyrics from Official Bob Dylan site Category:Songs written by Bob Dylan Category:Bob Dylan songs Category:1965 songs Category:Song recordings produced by Tom Wilson (record producer) ","title":"On the Road Again (Bob Dylan song)"},{"id":"23122856","text":"In physics, a gauge principle specifies a procedure for obtaining an interaction term from a free Lagrangian which is symmetric with respect to a continuous symmetry‚Äîthe results of localizing (or gauging) the global symmetry group must be accompanied by the inclusion of additional fields (such as the electromagnetic field), with appropriate kinetic and interaction terms in the action, in such a way that the extended Lagrangian is covariant with respect to a new extended group of local transformations.

If the testability of the software artifact is high, then finding faults in the system (if it has any) by means of testing is easier. Formally, some systems are testable, and some are not. This classification can be achieved by noticing that, to be testable, for a functionality of the system under test \\"S\\", which takes input \\"I\\", a computable functional predicate \\"V\\" must exists such that V(S,I) is true when S, given input I, produce a valid output, false otherwise. This function \\"V\\" is known as the verification function for the system with input I. Many software systems are untestable, or not immediately testable. For example, Google's ReCAPTCHA, without having any metadata about the images is not a testable system. Recaptcha, however, can be immediately tested if for each image shown, there is a tag stored elsewhere. Given this meta information, one can test the system. Therefore, testability is often thought of as an extrinsic property which results from interdependency of the software to be tested and the test goals, test methods used, and test resources (i.e., the test context). Even though testability can not be measured directly (such as software size) it should be considered an intrinsic property of a software artifact because it is highly correlated with other key software qualities such as encapsulation, coupling, cohesion, and redundancy. The correlation of 'testability' to good design can be observed by seeing that code that has weak cohesion, tight coupling, redundancy and lack of encapsulation is difficult to test. A lower degree of testability results in increased test effort. In extreme cases a lack of testability may hinder testing parts of the software or software requirements _at all_. In order to link the testability with the difficulty to find potential faults in a system (if they exist) by testing it, a relevant measure to assess the testability is how many test cases are needed in each case to form a complete test suite (i.e. a test suite such that, after applying all test cases to the system, collected outputs will let us unambiguously determine whether the system is correct or not according to some specification). If this size is small, then the testability is high. Based on this measure, a testability hierarchy has been proposed.  Background  Testability, a property applying to empirical hypothesis, involves two components. The effort and effectiveness of software tests depends on numerous factors including: * Properties of the software requirements * Properties of the software itself (such as size, complexity and testability) * Properties of the test methods used * Properties of the development- and testing processes * Qualification and motivation of the persons involved in the test process  Testability of software components  The testability of software components (modules, classes) is determined by factors such as: * Controllability: The degree to which it is possible to control the state of the component under test (CUT) as required for testing. * Observability: The degree to which it is possible to observe (intermediate and final) test results. * Isolateability: The degree to which the component under test (CUT) can be tested in isolation. * Separation of concerns: The degree to which the component under test has a single, well defined responsibility. * Understandability: The degree to which the component under test is documented or self-explaining. * Automatability: The degree to which it is possible to automate testing of the component under test. * Heterogeneity: The degree to which the use of diverse technologies requires to use diverse test methods and tools in parallel. The testability of software components can be improved by: * Test-driven development * Design for testability (similar to design for test in the hardware domain)  Testability hierarchy  Based on the amount of test cases required to construct a complete test suite in each context (i.e. a test suite such that, if it is applied to the implementation under test, then we collect enough information to precisely determine whether the system is correct or incorrect according to some specification), a testability hierarchy with the following testability classes has been proposed: * Class I: there exists a finite complete test suite. * Class II: any partial distinguishing rate (i.e. any incomplete capability to distinguish correct systems from incorrect systems) can be reached with a finite test suite. * Class III: there exists a countable complete test suite. * Class IV: there exists a complete test suite. * Class V: all cases. It has been proved that each class is strictly included into the next. For instance, testing when we assume that the behavior of the implementation under test can be denoted by a deterministic finite-state machine for some known finite sets of inputs and outputs and with some known number of states belongs to Class I (and all subsequent classes). However, if the number of states is not known, then it only belongs to all classes from Class II on. If the implementation under test must be a deterministic finite- state machine failing the specification for a single trace (and its continuations), and its number of states is unknown, then it only belongs to classes from Class III on. Testing temporal machines where transitions are triggered if inputs are produced within some real-bounded interval only belongs to classes from Class IV on, whereas testing many non-deterministic systems only belongs to Class V (but not all, and some even belong to Class I). The inclusion into Class I does not require the simplicity of the assumed computation model, as some testing cases involving implementations written in any programming language, and testing implementations defined as machines depending on continuous magnitudes, have been proved to be in Class I. Other elaborated cases, such as the testing framework by Matthew Hennessy under must semantics, and temporal machines with rational timeouts, belong to Class II.  Testability of requirements  Requirements need to fulfill the following criteria in order to be testable: * consistent * complete * unambiguous * quantitative (a requirement like \\"fast response time\\" can not be verification/verified) * verification/verifiable in practice (a test is feasible not only in theory but also in practice with limited resources) Treating the requirement as axioms, testability can be treated via asserting existence of a function F_S (software) such that input I_k generates output O_k, therefore F_S : I \\\\to O. Therefore, the ideal software generates the tuple (I_k,O_k) which is the input-output set \\\\Sigma, standing for specification. Now, take a test input I_t , which generates the output O_t, that is the test tuple \\\\tau = (I_t,O_t) . Now, the question is whether or not \\\\tau \\\\in \\\\Sigma or \\\\tau ot \\\\in \\\\Sigma . If it is in the set, the test tuple \\\\tau passes, else the system fails the test input. Therefore, it is of imperative importance to figure out : can we or can we not create a function that effectively translates into the notion of the set indicator function for the specification set \\\\Sigma . By the notion, 1_{\\\\Sigma} is the testability function for the specification \\\\Sigma. The existence should not merely be asserted, should be proven rigorously. Therefore, obviously without algebraic consistency, no such function can be found, and therefore, the specification cease to be termed as testable.  See also  * Testability  References  * Robert V.

Added to the International Cloud Atlas as a supplementary feature in March 2017, it is the first cloud formation added since cirrus intortus in 1951. The name translates approximately as \\"roughness\\". The clouds are closely related to undulatus clouds. Although they appear dark and storm-like, they almost always dissipate without a storm forming. The ominous-looking clouds have been particularly common in the Plains states of the United States, often during the morning or midday hours following convective thunderstorm activity.  History of observations  Margaret LeMone, a cloud expert with the National Center for Atmospheric Research has taken photos of asperatus clouds for 30 years, and considers it in her own words, a new cloud type. On June 20, 2006 Jane Wiggins took a picture of asperatus clouds from the window of a downtown office building in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. In March 2009, Chad Hedstroom took a picture of asperatus clouds from his car near Greenville Ave in Dallas, Texas. Soon after taking it, Wiggins sent her Cedar Rapids image to the Cloud Appreciation Society, which displayed it on its image gallery. Wiggins' photograph was posted on the National Geographic website on June 4, 2009. On July 23, 2013, Janet Salsman photographed them along the South Shore of Nova Scotia, Canada.

The photo was posted by NASA as the Astronomy Picture of the Day and shows great detail, partly because sunlight illuminates the undulating clouds from the side. Since 2006, many similar cloud formations have been contributed to the gallery, and in 2009 Gavin Pretor-Pinney, founder of The Cloud Appreciation Society, began working with the Royal Meteorological Society to promote the cloud type as an entirely new type in and of itself. The 2017 edition of the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) 's International Cloud Atlas included asperitas as a supplementary feature. Pretor-Pinney gave an invited presentation at the WMO in Geneva for the launch of the revised Cloud Atlas, on World Meteorological Day 2017. He has worked with scientists at the Department of Meteorology, University of Reading on possible mechanisms for the formation of asperitas, co-authoring a paper published in the Royal Meteorological Society's journal Weather. This described a series of sightings of the cloud, which were interpreted as being associated with the propagation of gravity waves through a pre-existing cloud layer.

It was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 1981 Cannes Film Festival. It is based on the novel of the same name by Doris Lessing. Plot After a near future economic collapse, England lies in ruins. Middle aged D (Julie Christie) struggles to survive in the failing city, where electricity is infrequent, water delivery scarce and trash pick up non-existent. As she rarely leaves her apartment, D takes in teenager Emily, allowing her to share D's apartment, in exchange for the girl's help. Emily soon begins to fall for Gerald (Christopher Guard) and leaves D to move in with Gerald. Gerald operates a makeshift refugee camp for the orphan and homeless children of the city. D is able to see Gerald's failing whereas Emily can not. In addition. D's grasp on reality is questioned as she can also travel back in time and observe a Victorian age family that resided in the same apartment. D may be witnessing the distorted history of the young woman currently in her care, as the child in the Victorian age is also named Emily, although whether these trips to the past are actually occurring or they are a fantasy is the mind of D a question left unanswered.

The street runs east of, and parallel to, Atlanta's Downtown Connector. It begins at Ponce de Leon Avenue in the north (north of which it continues as Monroe Drive), passing through the Old Fourth Ward, Cabbagetown, and Grant Park, and forming the border between Chosewood Park on the west and Boulevard Heights and Benteen Park to the east. It ends at McDonough Boulevard in the south, at the Federal Penitentiary. Boulevard is notable for being a center of high crime and drug activity in Atlanta, as well as the location of the highest concentration of Section 8 housing in the Southeastern United States. History It was not always so. In 1895, shortly after Boulevard was built, author Margaret Severance, in her book \\"Official Guide to Atlanta\\", described it as: \\"a beautiful avenue, [which] will be a great pride to Atlanta in years to come. Its height, width and number of magnificent homes, with their spacious lawns, assure every observer a boulevard that any city may point to with pride. This is one of the most desirable residence streets in the city.\\" Boulevard remained a white street through the 1910s even as the side streets became increasingly African-American. This trend was due to Blacks moving eastwards from the Sweet Auburn area, seeking to consolidate their businesses and residences into safe, primarily black areas after the traumatic Atlanta race riot of 1906. One institution in particular anchored the African-American presence on the neighborhood: Morris Brown College was founded in 1885 at Boulevard and Houston St. (now John Wesley Dobbs Ave.) and in 1922 expanded, acquiring the land at the southeast corner of Boulevard and Irwin St.A history of the African Methodist Episcopal Church, Charles Spencer Smith, Daniel Alexander Payne, p.354 The college moved to its present location at the Atlanta University Center in 1932;\\"Fountain Hall\\", City of Atlanta Urban Design Commission the site is now occupied by the Helene Mills Senior Center and the Mt. Zion Second Baptist Church. From the 1920s through the 1940s many of Boulevard's homes began to be purchased by prominent African- American \\"doctors, bishops, ministers [and]...attorneys\\".Black Atlanta in the Roaring Twenties By Herman Skip Mason, Jr., Herman Skip Mason Jr., p.75 The flight of better-off residents from Intown Atlanta also affected Boulevard and the houses were replaced with apartments, which eventually came to fall under \\"Section 8\\". Boston-based Continental Wingate manages 700 units of Section 8 housing on or near Boulevard in Old Fourth Ward. Many believe that redevelopment and gentrification on Boulevard and the immediately surrounding streets is inevitable, as most areas surrounding it now contain mixed-income or upscale housing. 2012 revitalization plan In January 2012, City Councilman Kwanza Hall revealed a seven-point strategy, \\"Year of Boulevard\\", marketed as \\"YoBoulevard!\\" to revitalize the Boulevard corridor in the Old Fourth Ward, which included:\\"Seven Prong Plan Unveiled For Boulevard\\", East Atlanta Patch, January 13, 2011 *An Atlanta Police Department mini-precinct within the Atlanta Medical Center that will house 12 officers exclusively dedicated to Boulevard *Wingate management to donate an apartment within the Bedford-Pine complex to serve as a processing and booking center for people who are arrested *Wingate cash contribution to the Old 4th Ward Security Patrol *Atlanta Workforce Development Agency and Mt.

The main characters are Raymond Jardine and Sean Delancy. Sean is a popular student, a starter on the high school basketball team. Raymond Jardine is the man with no luck and therefore is constantly scheming to get to the Greek Island Theamelpos that he calls \\"the luck place\\", in order to cure his absence of luck. Plot The plot of the novel revolves around Jardine bringing Sean Delancey, his English poetry project partner, into various schemes to ensure their arrival at Theamelpos for the summer. The central one of which involves winning an English-department contest based on their poetry unit. Along the way they encounter Ashley, a beautiful model who becomes the third member of their poetry project, and Cementhead (Steve Semenski), the luckiest student in the school. Sean and Raymond eventually ask Sean's grandfather to impersonate a (fictional) virtually-unknown poet, Gavin Gunhold, in order to bolster their poetry project for English class. A subplot revolves around the unmasking the school administration's coverups regarding a local government contract to use the school as a testbed for SACGEN (Solar Air Current GENerator), a (fictional) stand-alone power system project that is supposed to power the school using only renewable energy. The school building was disconnected from the electric power grid, and its central core was gutted to house the control room and the storage batteries. Unfortunately, the project barely functions, causing frequent blackouts, leading the students to refer to it as \\"The Windmill.\\" Unbeknownst to Sean and Raymond, their English teacher had removed the only bibliographical proof of Gunhold's demise from the local library in order to see how far they would go in their attempts to win the contest. This eventually leads to them conspiring with Sean's grandfather to demonstrate the unreliability of \\"The Windmill\\" by inviting the local news media to a poetry recitation at the school. Determined to continue the coverup, the school principal and government officials in charge of the project disregard the system engineer's warnings, leading to the catastrophic failure and subsequent explosion of the SACGEN unit. Following the demise of the SACGEN unit, and the unmasking of the student's forgeries of additional poems by Gunhold, the principal awards Sean and Raymond with the prize trip to Theamelpos in order to make them unavailable for comment during the construction of SACGEN-II. Reception A review in Canadian Family said the book was \\"a classic tale of teenage scheming\\" which \\"will keep readers laughing and engaged throughout\\". Tanya Boudreau of CM Magazine gave the book 3 out of 4 stars, opining that \\"Raymond and Sean are likeable, well-rounded characters who have memorable personalities and quirks\\".

At in elevation it is the highest in Skagit County and one of about ten of Washington's non-volcanic peaks above 9,000 feet high. It is ranked as the 14th highest peak in the state, and the third highest peak in North Cascades National Park. Description The mountain has two summits of nearly the same elevation, separated by a ridgeline of a few hundred feet. Sources differ over the exact height of the southwestern summit. The current United States Geological Survey quadrangle shows the southwest summit to have an elevation between 9080 and 9119 feet. According to Peakbagger.com the southwestern peak is the higher one, at , based on Edward Earl's pixel analysis of the height of the peak as derived from a digital photograph. The broader northeastern peak is agreed to be . Noted climber Fred Beckey also claims in his Cascade Alpine Guide books that the Southwest summit is two feet higher but gives no source for the claim and this approximation is second-hand since Beckey has never summitted Buckner. Most mountain climbers visit the southwest peak since it is arrived at first via the standard Horseshoe Basin route. Buckner Mountain, with a prominence of , is the 51st most prominent peak in Washington state. The nearest higher peak is Goode Mountain, to the east. Buckner Mountain is located on the border between Chelan and Skagit counties. It is connected to Horseshoe Peak, Boston Peak, and Sahale Mountain to the west by Ripsaw Ridge, which marks the county line for several miles. Cascade Pass is located a few miles south of Sahale Mountain. Boston Glacier, the largest glacier of the North Cascades, covers the entire region north of Ripsaw Ridge. South of Ripsaw Ridge the terrain slopes down into the vast Horseshoe Basin, from which some the headwater tributaries of the Stehekin River flow. Long high ridges extend from Buckner Mountain east to Park Creek Pass, and south to Booker Mountain and Park Creek Ridge. Other glaciers near Buckner Mountain include Thunder Glacier, to the north, and Buckner Glacier, to the south.USGS topographic maps accessed from USGS GNIS website Buckner Mountain marks the boundary between the Skagit River watershed, to the west, and the Columbia River watershed, to the east, via the Columbia's tributaries: Chelan River, Chelan Lake and Stehekin River. Buckner Mountain is named for Henry Freeland Buckner, who in the early 20th century managed a mining company which had claims in Horseshoe Basin, southwest of the peak. Climate Buckner from southwest Buckner Mountain is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in avalanche danger. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks and ridges, deep glacial valleys, and granite spires. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. These climate differences lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. North face of Buckner from the Boston Glacier During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area. Recreation Buckner Mountain is one of the more accessible high peaks of Washington, being located just east of Cascade Pass and a well-maintained trail. Boston Glacier, on the mountains northern face, has become one of the best known ice climbs in the North Cascades.

This film is based on the director's best-selling 1990 novel, which was translated into almost two dozen languages. Plot Alexandre (Vincent Perez) is frustrated with his fianc√©, Laure (Marine Delterme), whose idea of a romantic Valentine's Day gift is a pair of slippers. The passion and magic of their initial courtship has been replaced by routine and boredom. Needing to get away, Alexandre visits the beachfront cottage of his friends, Ti (G√©rard S√©ty) and Maude (Micheline Presle). There he meets a beautiful young woman, Fanfan (Sophie Marceau), who is Maude's granddaughter and a student at Maude's school, studying to become a perfumer or Nose. Although they sleep in the same bed that night, Alexandre avoids any physical contact. The next day they are joined by Ti and Maude, who become confidants to their guests. Fanfan takes Alexandre to an old abandoned house where they learn more about each other in the quiet comfort of her life \\"hideout\\". Back at his apartment, Alexandre discovers his fianc√© in the bedroom dressed as an Italian call girl, hoping the charade will excite his libido and rejuvenate their relationship‚Äîbut the charade does not work. Later at her parents' house, Alexandre becomes even more discouraged by Laure's father's talk of him joining the funeral business and the gloomy outlook on marriage. Meanwhile, Fanfan confesses to a friend that she is in love with Alexandre. For Alexandre, however, things are more complicated. He explains to Ti that his past relationships have all followed the same disappointing pattern‚Äîthe seduction and passion at the start is inevitably replaced with routine and boredom once a relationship becomes sexual. When asked what the alternative is, Alexandre offers his solution: Platonic love. To avoid the banality of \\"coupledom\\" in his new relationship with Fanfan, he will court her forever without ever revealing his love for her. He'll never kiss her or take their relationship to a physical level, reasoning that excitement is found in unfulfilled desire. He will stay with Laure physically, but will stay in love with Fanfan forever. Alexandre and Fanfan meet for a date at a beautiful upscale apartment, which Alexandre says belongs to his father. While Fanfan reveals personal and intimate details about her life, Alexandre prepares all her favorite foods, and the two share a romantic evening by candlelight. The perfect evening is interrupted, however, when the apartment's owner returns home with his wife, who proceeds to call the police as Alexandre and Fanfan make their escape. Alexandre blindfolds Fanfan and drives her to a television studio to a set designed to be Vienna in 1813. He dresses her in a ballroom gown, removes the blindfold, and they waltz together, gazing lovingly into each other's eyes. They end their magical evening with a bottle of champagne on an imaginary balcony overlooking an imaginary Vienna, with Alexandre proposing a toast to their \\"friendship\\". Fanfan is clearly disappointed and annoyed with Alexandre's talk of \\"friendship\\", and she asks to be dropped off at the home of her friend Paul‚Äîa sculptor doing a nude study of her. Alexandre returns home to an equally annoyed Laure, who suspects he's been with another woman. Alexandre admits it, but assures her that nothing will ever come of it. As Laure plans out their wedding, Alexandre can actually see them turning into her parents. Laure knows something is wrong, saying, \\"I wish I weren't yours so you would want me again.\\" Meanwhile, Fanfan complains to Maude about Alexandre's strange behavior. Unlike Alexandre, Fanfan believes in \\"eternal passion for life.\\" Fanfan learns from Maude that Alexandre has been living with Laure for five years. Alexandre and Fanfan continue to socialize as friends, but the \\"friendship\\" only creates more frustration. They meet at a restaurant and Fanfan gives him an ultimatum: he must choose between Laure and her. While Alexandre claims to want only friendship, Fanfan knows he is attracted to her by his scent. Later when she isn't looking, Alexandre pours sleeping powder in her drink, and she falls into a deep sleep on the ride home. She wakes up on the beach at the cottage, where Alexandre watches over her and applies suntan lotion sensually on her back. Tempted by the half-naked Fanfan, he moves to kiss her when suddenly Laure arrives by boat and announces that the wedding plans are set and that she is pregnant. After congratulating the couple, Fanfan leaves in disgust. Unable to concentrate on her studies, Fanfan fails her perfumer final exams. Meanwhile, Alexandre discovers that Laure lied about being pregnant, and after he throws away the wedding invitations, Laure calls off the wedding. Alexandre then sees Fanfan boarding a bus to Italy, and he chases after her. When he reaches the bus at the next stop, he does not get on, and the bus pulls away. Later, Ti warns him that Fanfan will not wait forever. When Alexandre learns that she will be in Italy for ten days, he sets in motion his next plan. He rents the apartment next to Fanfan's apartment, knocks out the dividing wall, and installs a two-way mirror so he can see into her apartment while remaining hidden. Back from Italy, Fanfan and Alexandre arrange to spend the weekend at the beach cottage as friends. At the train station, however, Fanfan surprises Alexandre by bringing her sculptor friend, Paul. Clearly disappointed and jealous, Alexandre tells her that he and Laure have broken up and that her pregnancy was a lie. Fanfan simply responds, \\"Too late.\\" At the beach, Paul announces that he and Fanfan are getting married, but back at the apartment, Alexandre discovers through the two-way mirror that their wedding plans were just a ruse to make Alexandre jealous, and that Fanfan is still in love with him. Later, after learning about the two-way mirror, Fanfan confronts Alexandre who is hidden behind the mirror. He confesses he did not get on the bus to Italy that day because he knew that in five years he would no longer be running after the bus. They kiss and embrace each other tenderly through the glass, but Fanfan says she needs more. \\"I need to feel you in me,\\" she says, but Alexandre cannot respond. Exasperated, Fanfan gives him another ultimatum: if he is not in her room by 10:00 pm, he'll never see her again. Alexandre does not show, and when he returns to his apartment, he sees that she's moved out and left a note that she is going to see her sister. Devastated that she's gone, Alexandre calls Maude only to find out that Fanfan's sister is dead, and she could not see her other than by committing suicide. Alexandre envisions trying to get to Fanfan through endless bridal veil, and cries for being too late to touch her living body. Just then the mirror is cracked‚ÄîFanfan has broken the wall of glass between them. The two kiss and embrace, and Fanfan tells him he has until the morning to win her back.

It belongs to the lute family of string instruments, and is guitar-like in function, but with a shape closer to that of the violin. The word cuatro means \\"four\\", which was the total number of strings of the earliest Puerto Rican instrument known by the cuatro name. The current cuatro has ten strings in five courses, tuned, in fourths, from low to high B3 B2‚ô¶E4 E3‚ô¶A3 A3‚ô¶D4 D4‚ô¶G4 G4 (note that the bottom two pairs are in octaves, while the top three pairs are tuned in unison), and a scale length of 500-520 millimetres. The cuatro is the most familiar of the three instruments which make up the Puerto Rican j√≠baro orchestra (the cuatro, the tiple and the bordon√∫a). A cuatro player is called a cuatrista. This instrument has had its prominent performers like Andr√©s Jim√©nez, Edwin Col√≥n Zayas, Yomo Toro, Iluminado Davila Medina and the maestro Maso Rivera. History El Cuatro Puertorrique√±o (1938): Guitar player above the swamp water. The workers' quarter of Puerto de Tierra. San Juan, Puerto Rico Very little is known about the exact origin of the cuatro. However, most experts believe that the cuatro has existed on the island in one form or another for about 400 years. The Spanish instrument that it is most closely related to is the vihuela poblana (also known as the Medieval/Renaissance guitar), which had four courses, two strings each for eight strings in total as well as the Spanish Medieval/Renaissance four course and the Spanish la√∫d, particularly in the Canary Islands. There was a \\"cuatro antiguo\\" which had four single strings, then eight strings in four doubled courses, and then the modern cuatro with five double courses. Despite the name, however, the origins are not clear. Types of Puerto Rican cuatros Musical Instrument Museum of Phoenix There are three main types of cuatro: cuatro antiguo of four orders and four strings, the \\"Southern\\" cuatro of four orders and eight strings, and the cuatro \\"moderno\\" of five orders and ten strings. * The four string cuatro antiguo: This is the original Puerto Rican cuatro. It was made from a single block of wood and used four gut strings. This instrument may have evolved from the vihuela poblana. It was used to mostly play j√≠baro music. * The eight string \\"Southern\\" cuatro: This cuatro evolved from the old four string cuatro. It was made like a guitar and had four pairs of steel strings. It was used to play salon genres like the mazurka, danza, waltz, polka, etc. * The ten string cuatro \\"moderno\\": This cuatro evolved from the Baroque era ten string bandurria and la√∫d from Spain. It is made from a single block of wood and it has five pairs of steel strings. It is the most commonly used today and is used to play j√≠baro music, salon genres, salsa, pop, rock, classical, jazz, and even American bluegrass and many more styles.  Cuatro shapes, sizes and variants.  A plan of three cuatro body designs. From left to right, the traditional cuatro antiguo design, the \\"Southern\\" soft waisted cuatro antiguo, and the modern \\"aviolinado\\" cuatro. A modern Puerto rican cuatro A Puerto Rican cuatro with a floating bridge. Sound Box designs: * The antiguo design: This box resembles a medieval keyhole, also known as cuatro cuadrao, or cuatro ara√±a. This shape has been found on some old dotars and citolas. Four string, eight string and ten string cuatros were made using this design. This was the very first design and it might be 400 years old. Sometimes some ten string cuatros are still made with this design. * The aviolinado design: This box resembles a violin. It is the most common shape used today. Eight string and ten string cuatros were made using this design starting in the 19th century. * The dos puntos design: This box looked like some old mandolinas made by Martin in the United States during the 20th century. However, it was first used in the 19th century in Yauco, Puerto Rico. Eight string cuatros were made using this design. * The tulip√°n design: This box looked like the antiguo design but with no straight lines and all curves and thus resembled a tulip. Eight string and ten string cuatros were made using this design during the 1900s near Yauco and Ponce. * The higuera design: This is the rarest design. This box was shaped like an organic oval. This was because the soundboxes were made from domed gourds instead of wood. Four string cuatros were made using this design in the 19th century in Puerto Rico by enslaved Africans on the island. Now they are made with ten metal strings and often have designs carved onto their backs. * Besides these, many other lesser known and one-of-a-kind designs also exist. Variants A \\"Thinline\\" Cumpiano Puerto Rican Cuatro In the 1950s, there was an effort to produce a \\"classical\\" ensemble of cuatros, with various-sized instruments taking on the role of the violins, violas, cellos, and double bases in a classical orchestra. To meet these roles cuatros of the aviolinado style were produced in four different sizes and tunings: Cuatro Soprano, Cuatro Alto, Cuatro Tradicional (the standard instrument, also called Cuatro Tenor), and Cuatro Bajo (Bass Cuatro): all have ten strings and are tuned in fourths. The project met with only limited success and today most of these variants are rare, with the cuatro tradicional surviving as the standard instrument. There is also a Cuatro L√≠rico (\\"lyrical cuatro\\"), which is about the size of the Tenor, but has a deep jelly-bean shaped body; a Cuatro Sonero, which has fifteen strings in five courses of three strings each; and a Seis, which is a Cuatro Tradicional with an added two string course (usually a lower course), giving it a total of twelve strings in six courses.https://stringedinstrumentdatabase.aornis.com/c.htm The Stringed Instrument Database: Chttps://atlasofpluckedinstruments.com/central_america.htm ATLAS of Plucked Instruments: Central Americahttps://instrumap.netlify.com/namerica.html Instrumap: North America Cuatro orchestras of Puerto Rico The original cuatro orchestra was the orquesta j√≠bara which consisted of a various number of different string instruments: *Puerto Rican Tiple *Cuatro Tradicional *Bordon√∫a At least two configurations of \\"classical\\" cuatro orchestra were formed in the 1950s and 1960s: *Primero Cuatro Concertino *Segundo Cuatro Concertino *Cuatro Bajo *Cuatro R√≠tmico *Cuatro Tradicional Or: *Cuatro Soprano *Cuatro Tenor *Cuatro Alto *Cuatro Bajo As noted, most of the instrumental variants are now rare, as are these classical groupings. There have been, however, modern efforts to revive the orquesta j√≠bara. \\"The Puerto Rican Cuatro Project\\" OUR CUATRO Vol. 2 William Cumpiano and Christina Sotomayor founded the Puerto Rican Cuatro Project, a non-profit organization dedicated to fostering the traditions that surround the national instrument of Puerto Rico, by means of gathering, promoting and preserving the cultural memories of Puerto Rican musical traditions, folkloric stringed instruments and musicians. The Cuatro Project is also dedicated to promoting and preserving the Puerto Rican d√©cima verse form and the traditional song as created by its greatest troubadours, living and past. Cumpiano, together with Sotomayor and Wilfredo Echevarr√≠a, wrote, directed and produced two DVD documentaries for The Cuatro Project. They are:OUR CUATRO Vol.1, the first feature-length documentary about the cuatro and its music and OUR CUATRO Vol. 2: A Historic Concert.

It is similar in shape and tuning to the ukulele, but their character and playing technique are vastly different. It is tuned in a similar fashion to the traditional D tuning of the ukulele, but the A and B are an octave lower. Consequently, the same fingering can be used to shape the chords, but it produces a different inversion of each chord. A cuatro player is called a cuatrista. History Venezuelan Concert Cuatro Its 15th-Century ancestor was the Portuguese Cavaquinho. The predecessor of the Venezuelan cuatro is the four-string Spanish guitar which disappeared in the 16th century after a short period of surging popularity. In the 1950s, Fredy Reyna documented the evolution of the renaissance guitar into the current Venezuelan Cuatro, and reinvented the cuatro as a solo instrument, equally capable of rendering traditional Venezuelan music as well as Renaissance pieces. The popularity of the instrument in Venezuela and elsewhere may be due to its apparent simplicity, having only four strings, as well as its compact size. The design and quality of its construction may vary widely, from rustic, inexpensive instruments, to the custom-built Concert Cuatro, comparable to the finest Classical Guitars. The cuatro is often said to be the Caribbean version of the ukulele (although the cuatro was invented three centuries earlier), having a similar sound, looks, and tuning; and being used in Venezuela, Trinidad, and throughout various other Caribbean spots. Playing The cuatro is particularly designed for strumming: the fingerboard finishes flush with the top of the instrument, and the upper half of the sound board is often completely covered by a scratch plate made from hardwood. Most of Venezuelan folkloric music relies on the cuatro as its rhythmic and harmonic base. It is used in most genres of the different regions of Venezuela, such as Joropo in the Llanos, Gaita in Zulia, Galer√≥n in the Oriente or calypso in Trinidad. A recent evolution in playing technique has made the cuatro a versatile instrument capable of handling, on its own, solo parts including both melody and harmony. The technical and musical knowledge and expertise required to be able to play the instrument in this way is astounding. The results have made Venezuelan traditional music leap to a whole new level of complexity, many times encompassing the utilization of jazz harmonic structures and melodic phrasing to enrich many traditional tunes. The cuatro is used in waltz, joropo, parang, calypso, and soca. Tuning There are several tunings possible on the cuatro, but they are mostly transpositions of the main tuning (below), which may depend on the accompanied singer's range or the tone of the harp the cuatro is playing with. The strings are tuned from top to bottom (using the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4), to these intervals: * strings 1 and 2 - perfect fourth * strings 2 and 3 - major third * strings 1 and 4 - major second The most popular tuning for the cuatro is A D F B, with the B string tuned to a major second interval from the A string (instead of the more \\"guitar-like\\" perfect fourth from the F). In 1948, Fredy Reyna altered the way the cuatro is strung and broke with reentrant tuning. His cuatro, called \\"solista\\" (soloist), was tuned in strict ascending pitch order. After trying many tunings, Reyna settled on E A C F as the one he used the most. In doing this, he (inadvertently at the time) arrived at the stringing and tuning of the Renaissance guitar. His work has been meticulously documented by Reyna himself, but it has not been widely adopted. A popular way to remember the tuning of the cuatro among Venezuelan cuatro players is to play each string individually from top to bottom, while singing the words Cam-bur pin-t√≥n in the same expected notes of the four cuatro strings. (Cambur Pint√≥n means Ripe Banana in Venezuela. The phrase is used mainly because its four syllables are long and because of its easy-to-remember nature). A variation is Hi-p√≥-cri-ta, playing the strings from bottom to top. The \\"Venezuelan\\" cuatro in other countries The cuatro is an important part of \\"m√∫sica llanera\\", belonging to the Venezuelan area known as \\"El Llano\\". As such, el cuatro is widely used in eastern Colombia. El cuatro is also used in Trinidad and Tobago to accompany musical bands at Christmas time singing about the birth of Christ. This type of music is called parang, from the word \\"parranda,\\" meaning \\"to make merry.\\" Parang music mixed with a calypso flavor has found itself deeply rooted in the culture of the people of this Caribbean country. The language used in the songs is mostly Spanish but Patois and English are used as well. This richly adds to the rhythmic sounds of this versatile instrument. The cuatro, under the name cuarta, is also very popular on the Dutch Lesser Antilles, Aruba, Cura√ßao and Bonaire, where it is used for different types of music, including the traditional tumba, waltz, danza, polka, calypso, bolero, march and several others.

He played college football for Arizona State University, and earned All-American honors. A second-round pick in the 1997 NFL Draft, he played professionally for the NFL's Detroit Lions and then the CFL's Toronto Argonauts. Roque was a color analyst for Fox Sports Arizona's broadcasts of Arizona State football games. Early years Roque was born on February 6, 1974 in San Diego, California, to Armando and Maria Roque. Shortly after Juan's birth, Armando and Maria moved to the Roques' native Mexico, living in Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz. When Juan was three, the Roques returned to the United States and eventually resided in Ontario, California. Roque attended Ontario High School and played on its offensive line. Coming out of high school, Roque was recruited by numerous colleges; these included USC and Washington State. Initially Roque verbally committed to USC but withdrew the commitment and decided to sign his letter of intent with Arizona State University to play for incoming head coach Bruce Snyder. Roque was initially recruited as a defensive lineman. College career Roque attended Arizona State University, where he played for the Arizona State Sun Devils football team from 1992 to 1996. He was moved to offensive tackle and redshirted during the 1992 season. By his sophomore season, 1994, Roque had gained a starting spot for Arizona State at left guard. In 1995 Roque was named an honorable mention preseason All-American by Street & Smith's. Following the season, he was named to the All-Pacific-10 Conference first team and was a second team All-American by The Sporting News. Before the 1996 season Roque was considered as a contender for the Outland Trophy as best interior lineman in the country. In May 1996 Roque graduated from Arizona State, earning a Latin American history degree. Roque started all 11 games for the Sun Devils that season, helping the team go 11‚Äì0 in the regular season. Notable victories that season were a 19‚Äì0 upset of number one- ranked Nebraska, a come from behind victory over UCLA, a double overtime win against USC, and a 56‚Äì14 rout of the University of Arizona in Tucson. Arizona State won the Pacific-10 Conference championship for the second time in school history and earned a Rose Bowl berth with a 35‚Äì7 victory against California. Roque received numerous honors that year. He was a consensus first-team All- American, All-Pacific-10 Conference first team member for the second year in a row, runner-up for the Lombardi Award, and an Outland Trophy finalist. Roque played in the Rose Bowl on January 1, 1997 against Ohio State University. The second-ranked Sun Devils, despite a strong effort by quarterback Jake Plummer, lost 20‚Äì17. After the college season ended, Roque was invited to participate in the 1997 NFL Combine in Indianapolis, Indiana and did so. Professional career During the 1997 NFL Draft Roque was selected by the Detroit Lions in the second round (35th overall). During his rookie year Roque played in 13 games. Against the Chicago Bears on Thanksgiving Day, Roque received an opportunity to start. During the game, Roque suffered a serious left knee injury that sidelined him for the remainder of the season. Roque did not play in 1998 as he spent the entire year on injured reserve due to lingering effects from the knee injury. In 1999 Roque earned a starting position at right tackle. He started the first two games and helped the Lions earn a 2‚Äì0 record. Roque did not see further playing time until the final two games of the regular season, but saw action against the Washington Redskins during a Wild Card playoff game in January 2000. Roque was released by the Lions before the 2000 season. In 2001 Roque signed a contract to play for the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League. Listed as a defensive lineman, Roque played in seven games for the Argonauts in the 2002 CFL season before the team released him.

According to one reviewer, applications are rare even though bismuth and bismuth compounds are the least toxic among the heavy metals and are relatively cheap.\\"Bismuth-Mediated Organic Reactions\\", Ollevier, T.

The main bismuth oxidation states are Bi(III) and Bi(V) as in all higher group 15 elements. The energy of a bond to carbon in this group decreases in the order P > As > Sb > Bi.C. Elschenbroich, A. Salzer Organometallics : A Concise Introduction (2nd Ed) (1992) from Wiley- VCH: Weinheim. The first reported use of bismuth in organic chemistry was in oxidation of alcohols by Challenger in 1934 (using Ph3Bi(OH)2).Organo- derivatives of bismuth and thallium Frederick Challenger and Oswald V. Richards, J. Chem. Soc., 1934, 405 Knowledge about methylated species of bismuth in environmental and biological media is very limited. Organobismuth heterocycles are bismole and bismabenzene. For reviews, see the cited articles  Preparation of Organobismuth(III) Compounds  Organobismuth(III) compounds can be prepared from BiCl3 by substitution with the corresponding carbon nucleophiles (generally of the form of a Grignard reagent or alkyl/aryl lithium species). Triaryl bismuth(III) compounds are typically crystalline solids that are not air and moisture sensitive and can easily be purified by recrystallization or chromatography, thus making them attractive reagents for organic synthesis. 370x370px Since formation of organobismuth (III) complexes require the formation of highly basic coupling partners, a limited number of functional groups (especially those that are base sensitive) can be incorporated on the bismuth center through alkyl metal addition. Recently, the Gagnon group has demonstrated that chemical modification of the substituents on the bismuth center can be achieved after formation of the organobismuth(III) center with aryl Grignards to form triaryl bismuth(III) complexes with sensitive functionalities such as alcohols, aldehydes, and ketones. thumb  Synthesis of Organobismuth(V) compounds  Organobismuth(V) complexes may be accessed directly from organobismuth(III) through oxidative addition to a halogen then displacement of the newly formed bismuth-halogen bond for a bismuth-carbon bond with an alkyl or aryl lithium or Grignard reagent. Alternatively, treatment of the organobismuth(III) with thionyl chloride also affords the dihalo-oranobismuth(V) complex. thumb Bi(V) easily forms an onium ion for example: : Ph5Bi + BPh3 ‚Üí Ph4Bi+[BPh4]‚àí or an ate complex for example: : Ph5Bi + PhLi ‚Üí Li+[Ph6Bi‚àí] The thermal stability of R5M compounds decrease in the order As > Sb > Bi and aryl compounds are more stable than alkyl compounds. Me5Bi decomposes explosively at 20 ¬∞C.  Organobismuth(III) Chemistry  The most common synthetic use of Bi(III) complexes is to transmetallate one of its substituents onto a different metal center such as palladium. One early example of this comes from the Barton group where triaryl bismuth(III) were shown to react with acylchlorides under Pd(0) catalysis to form a variety of phenyl ketones. More recently, the Barabe group demonstrated that tricyclopropylbismuth(III) reagents can react with aryl halides and triflates under Pd(0) catalysis in a similar fashion to afford a variety of aryl and heteroaryl cyclopropanes. Examples of Bi(III) transferring carbon to a new metal center Triphenylbismuth, unlike the related phosphorus, arsenic, and antimony compounds, undergoes mild redistribution with its trihalide to give the mixed derivatives such as diphenylbismuth chloride (Ph2BiCl).Derek H.R. Barton, Neerja Yadav Bhatnagar, Jean-Pierre Finet, William B. Motherwell \\"Pentavalent organobismuth reagents. Part vi. Comparative migratory aptitudes of aryl groups in the arylation of phenols and enols by pentavalent bismuth reagents\\" Tetrahedron 1986, Volume 42, Pages 3111-3122 Bismuth(III) iodide is a catalyst in the Mukaiyama aldol reaction. Bi(III) is also used in a Barbier type allylation of carbonyl compounds in combination with a reducing agent such as zinc or magnesium, possibly forming the active Bi(0) catalyst in situ. The cyclic compound bismole, a structural analog of pyrrole, has not been isolated, but substituted bismoles are known.Caster, Kenneth C. \\"Arsoles, stiboles, and bismoles\\" Clive W. Bird, ed. Comprehensive Heterocyclic Chemistry II (1996), 2, 857-902. Triaryl bismuth(III) compounds may also be employed in C-N bond forming transformations with an appropriate metal co-catalyst. For instance, Barton and coworkers demonstrated that amines could be N-arylated with a bismuth(III) reagent in the presence of copper(II) salt. thumb Organobismuth(V) chemistry Bi(V) compounds are strongly oxidizing due to the inert pair effect and relativistic effects. Oxidizing agents are Ph3Bi(OOtBu)2, Ph3BiCO3 and (Ph3BiCl)2O. Substrates for oxidation are oximes, thiols, phenols and phosphines.Organobismuth Chemistry Hitomi Suzuki, Yoshihiro Matano Elsevier, 2001 Compounds such as Ph5Bi and Ph3BiCl2 have been used in the arylation of arene compounds and 1,3-dicarbonyl compounds:Bismuth(V) reagents in organic synthesis Derek H.R.

A triarylbismuth(III) complex forms concomitantly. Regioselectivity of this transformation is guided by the directing ability of adjacent lewis basic functionalities. It is important to note that in the above arylation, a full equivalent of the pentavalent bismuth compound is required for the arylation reaction therefore leaving four ligands on bismuth inactive for further arylations. Catalytic manifolds of this chemistry are challenging due in part to the reoxidation of Bi(III) to Bi(V). For more examples of bismuth mediated arylations, see the cited review. thumb Bi(V) compounds can be accessed through Bi(III) compounds for example: : Me3Bi + SO2Cl2 ‚Üí Me3BiCl2 : Me3BiCl2 \\\\+ 2 MeLi ‚Üí Me5Bi Structure and properties Pentaphenylbismuth, Ph5Bi is square pyramidal like pentaphenylantimony, whereas pentamethybismuth is, as expected from VSEPR theory, trigonal bipyramidal.

The Albanian forces defeated the Ottoman army led by Mustafa Pasha during the battle and two months later peace was established between Albania and Venice. Background In 1447, Skanderbeg had gone to war with Venice. The Venetians had been using diplomatic tactics to weaken Skanderbeg's influence and power: they had been trying to convince the Ottomans to launch an incursion into Albania. The Ottomans, who had been besieging Svetigrad, could not peel away their forces to fight in the Albanian interior: Svetigrad blocked their way and Skanderbeg's army was camped nearby. Once the fortress had fallen, however, they could afford to send troops into Albania. Prelude and the battle Mustafa, after gathering his army, invaded Albania through upper Dibra. A guarding force was left under the command of Vrana Konti which was united by Skanderbeg's forces after leaving 5,000 troops to watch Dagno. The forces consisted of 15,000 Ottoman troops and 6,000 Albanian troops. The armies met and a battle between two champions took place with the Albanian champion winning. The armies engaged, but higher Albanian morale forced the Ottoman army to retreat. The Albanians chased the Ottomans, capturing Mustafa Pasha. Aftermath Mustafa Pasha had lost 3,000 men as well as being captured including twelve high officers. Skanderbeg learned from these officers that it was the Venetians who pushed the Ottomans to invade Albania. The Venetians, upon hearing of the defeat, urged to establish peace. Mustafa Pasha was soon ransomed for 25,000 ducats to the Ottomans.Scanderbeg: From Ottoman Captive to Albanian Hero by Harry Hodgkison, page 89 References and notes External sources * Category:Warfare by Skanderbeg Category:1448 in Europe Oranik Oranik Category:Conflicts in 1448 Category:1448 in the Ottoman Empire ","title":"Battle of Oranik (1448)"},{"id":"23123275","text":"Janiwala is a town of Toba Tek Singh District in the Punjab province of Pakistan.

Tacubaya, today Mexico City, July 8, 1893 ‚Äì d. Mexico City, January 23, 1978) was a Mexican artist's model, painter and poet.  Biography  Carmen Mondrag√≥n was the fifth of eight children of General Manuel Mondrag√≥n, Secretario de Guerra y Marina in 1913 and inventor of the Mondrag√≥n rifle. Her mother was Mercedes Valseca. Carmen Mondrag√≥n received a privileged, private education in Mexico. Afterwards, she spent from 1897 to 1905 in France, it was there she learned to speak French fluently. The professional activities of General Mondrag√≥n, who specialized in artillery design, led the family to Spain in 1905, where she met cadet Manuel Rodr√≠guez Lozano, whom she married on August 6, 1913. Although her father, General Mondrag√≥n, was exiled to Belgium following the Decena Tr√°gica, Carmen Mondrag√≥n moved to Paris with her husband,Las hijas del porfiriato (Spanish), July 25, 2007. where they met Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse and Jean Cocteau. Afterwards they moved to San Sebasti√°n, Spain, where Carmen's brother Manuel ran a photo studio. In San Sebasti√°n, she started painting. In 1921, Carmen and her husband returned to Mexico and separated. Whether they were ever officially divorced is unknown. Carmen Mondrag√≥n turned towards the artists' scene of Mexico City; becoming acquainted with Jos√© Vasconcelos and Xavier Villaurrutia. Additionally, she was interested in the Teatro Ulises movement. She had multiple sexual affairs. Her beauty is described as mesmerizing and erotic, and she was apparently the first woman in Catholic Mexico to wear a miniskirt. She became model of several notable painters and photographers, among others posing for some of Diego Rivera's murals, for Tina Modotti, Antonio Gardu√±o, Roberto Montenegro, Mat√≠as Santoyo, Edward Weston and in 1928 for Ign√°cio Rosas at the Escuela Nacional de Bellas Artes.Primera exposici√≥n para descubrir el valor de la obra de Agust√≠n Jim√©nez (second photo from top) in LaJornada, October 25, 2007. Especially her nudes became famous. When a former French teacher of her recognized her pictures, he published A dix ans sur mon pupitre (From my desk, at 10 years old), a book of 1924, which describes the 10-year-old pupil Carmen Mondrag√≥n within his teacher's sight. Carmen Mondrag√≥n had an intense love relationship with Gerald Murillo, also known as Dr Atl, who named her \\"Nahui Olin\\", a symbol of Aztec renewal meaning \\"four movement\\", the symbol of earthquakes. They lived together in the former La Merced Cloister. At this time she wrote her poems √ìptica cerebral, poemas din√°micos (1922) and Calinement je suis dedans (1923), finished several na√Øve paintings, and composed. As intensely as the love relationship began, it ended equally quickly in the mid-1920s. Later she denied it completely. After having several further affairs, she stepped out of public life in the 1940s. She gained greater recognition posthumously; following a similar trajectory of fame as that of Frida Kahlo's. Carmen Mondrag√≥n is considered a talented and revolutionary women who both embraced and shaped the 1920s and 1930s in Mexico through her activism and creativity. She has been likened to Guadalupe Mar√≠n, Antonieta Rivas Mercado, Frida Kahlo, Tina Modotti, Lupe V√©lez and Mar√≠a Izquierdo. Unlike Kahlo, her popularity was due more to her enchanting beauty than to her artistic and literary work. She reflectively described her work as intuitive.

She began by singing in Kashbad, although the band was already formed when she got involved and were looking for a female vocalist. After recording their first demo, she was heard by Fermin Muguruza who was amazed by her voice. He suggested to her that they record the vocals for the Negu Gorriak song Nire Baitan Daude Biak (Both are inside me), which appeared on the album Ideia Zabaldu (To Expand The Idea) (Esan Ozenki, 1995). Afterwards, the group was persuaded to play in the Festival Hitz Egin along with bertsolaris and bands like Su Ta Gar, Ama Say, Naci√≥n Reixa and Negu Gorriak themselves. Later they recorded three records for the label Esan Ozenki (Kashbad, 1996; Distantzia, 1997 y Hesiak, 1999). The group then separated and each of the members went their separate way. In 1999, Fermin Muguruza released his first solo work Brigadistak Sound System.

Brandon, then known as Brandon Nitro, began to use his given name of Gatson and became Brandon \\"Nitro\\" Gatson and set his sights of the top prize in the EWF, the Heavyweight Championship. Pursuit of the EWF Heavyweight Championship (2007) Brandon \\"Nitro\\" Gatson began to chase the EWF Heavyweight Championship in the Fall of 2007. He quickly ascended the Heavyweight rankings and finished in the top 5 of the Inland Title Series Battle Royal, earning him a berth in the annual Inland Title Series, a round robin style tournament, against Scorpio Sky, Ryan Taylor and Blackstar. The winner of the tournament would become the #1 contender for the EWF Heavyweight Title. Gatson finished the ITS tied for first with Scorpio Sky and the two would meet in an epic tie-breaker match at The Fight Before Christmas. Gatson would then go on to meet Bino Gambino on January 13, 2008 at Return to the Hudson and became the EWF Heavyweight Champion. He lost the title to Ryan Taylor on October 30, 2009. On July 6, 2012, he was defeated by Joey Ryan for the vacant EWF Heavyweight Championship. He defeated Ryan for the title on December 7, 2012. Defending the title and Scorpio Sky (2007‚Äì2009) Brandon \\"Nitro\\" Gatson quickly gained a reputation as a fighting champion, taking on anyone and everyone and becoming a fan favorite. At the same time Gatson was earning his reputation, Scorpio Sky, the runner-up in the 2007 ITS was earning his own devoted following and quickly rose up the Heavyweight rankings. Sky and Gatson teamed together on several occasions and developed a mutual respect and a friendship. Scorpio Sky then earned a shot at Gatson's Heavyweight Title after defeating Dan \\"The Man\\" Kobrick and Terex in a #1 contender's three-way dance.

During their Last Man Standing match at Excessive Force 2. Nicholls hit Gatson over the head five times with a steel chair, which resulted in a hairline skull fracture and cost him a month of his career. Gatson would have the last laugh however as, in August at Red Hot Summer, Scorpio Sky was forced to relinquish the EWF Heavyweight Title and Gatson was given the final spot in a four-way elimination match for the Heavyweight Title and won by outlasting Sonny Samson, Joey Ryan and Mikey Nicholls.

An over-canvassed boat, whether a dinghy, a yacht or a sailing ship, is difficult to steer and control and tends to heel or roll too much. If the wind continues to rise, an over-canvassed sailing boat will become dangerous and ultimately gear may break or it may round-up into the wind, broach or capsize. Any of these eventualities puts the safety of the crew and the vessel in danger. To over-canvass a sailing boat is considered unseamanlike and imprudent. In order to reduce sail, individual sails may be lowered or furled and existing sails may be reefed. Counter- intuitively, many boats will sail faster, and certainly more smoothly, comfortably and safely, when carrying the correct amount of sail in a strong wind than they would if over-canvassed and excessively rolling, heeling, carrying too much weather helm or repeatedly rounding up.  Definition  The decision to reduce sail, to avoid being over-canvassed, is made at sea based on a number of factors. There are folklore sayings, such as, \\"Any fool can set a sail, but it takes a sailor to take it down\\" and, \\"The best time to reef is when you first think about it; when you think it's time to shake it out, have a cup of tea first\\". The fact is, that the definition of being over-canvassed depends on a number of factors. These include the design, form and stability of the boat hull, the age and strength of the sails and gear, the direction of the wind relative to the course, the size, experience and state of the crew, the state of the sea as well as the purpose of the voyage. Warning signs that a well-found, well-crewed sailing vessel may be over-canvassed include excessive weather helm, excessive speed, any uncontrolled rounding up or broaching, excessive slamming into or falling off of waves, excessive heel or excessive rolling. If the purpose of the journey does not include racing, or if there is any kind of damage or minor emergency on-board, or if the boat is old or if the crew is ill, or tired or short-handed, then the meaning of 'excessive' may be reduced in any of these cases.  Safety  The most important reason to avoid being over-canvassed in a blow is the safety of the boat, its gear and its crew. Frank Mulville said that, \\"With the wind fair a man is master of his boat and has the power to drive her as hard as he wishes - even to the point of destruction.\\" He went on to say, \\"In a contrary wind a well found yacht is master. She has more stamina to windward than any man by himself\\". Von Haeften says that, \\"It is impossible to tear working sails in good condition by wind pressure alone. If it happens, nevertheless, it will either be down to some sail-handling mistake so that the sail has been chafed or caught up somewhere, or to the fact that the sail was old and worn out\\". There are many stories of gear breakage from a parted shackle leaving a sail to flap wildly to shrouds giving way to bring a mast down. A wildly heaving deck that is heeled, rolling or broaching beyond what is normally expected, can pitch a crew member overboard into the sea, or lead to a fall and subsequent injury. Such issues of crew safety are always paramount.  Comfort  A single- or short-handed crew must conserve energy and take even more care of personal safety when the boat is unlikely to be handled, or brought back for a rescue, in their absence or incapacitation. Reducing sail early and thoroughly may be more important in these cases, especially when far from land. Friends out for a sail or a cruise, rather than a race, will be more impressed by a comfortable, stable voyage than one in which the eager skipper's personal best for angle of heel is exceeded several times.  Speed  The correct amount of sail for the conditions, with all that that implies will lead to improved boat performance compared to the over-canvassed state.

Background In the preceding decades, Muhammad Ali had expanded and strengthened his hold on Ottoman territory, beginning with Egypt where he acted as a viceroy for the Sultan. Called upon to assist the Ottomans in the Greek War of Independence, Muhammad Ali in return demanded parts of Ottoman Syria to be transferred to his personal rule. When the war ended and the Porte failed to keep its promise, Muhammad Ali launched a military campaign against his Ottoman masters and easily took most of the Syrian lands. =Syrian War= Extent of Muhammad Ali's rule in 1840 In 1839, the Ottoman Empire attempted to retake Syria from Muhammad Ali but was defeated by his son, Ibrahim Pasha in the Battle of Nezib. Thus, a new war between Muhammad Ali and the Ottomans escalated, with the latter once again failing to wage it successfully. In June 1840, the entire Ottoman navy defected to Muhammad Ali, and the French planned to offer full support to his cause.Efraim Karsh, Inari Karsh, Empires of the Sand: The Struggle for Mastery in the Middle East, 1789-1923, (Harvard University Press, 2001), 36-37. On the verge of total collapse and defeat to Muhammad Ali, an alliance of European powers comprising Britain, the Austrian Empire, Prussia and Russia decided to intervene on behalf of the young Sultan Abd√ºlmecid I. Convention of London By the Convention of London, signed on 15 July 1840, the Great Powers offered Muhammad Ali and his heirs permanent control over Egypt, Sudan, and the Eyalet of Acre, provided that these territories would nominally remain part of the Ottoman Empire. If he did not accept the withdrawal of his forces within ten days, he would lose the offer in southern Syria; if he delayed acceptance more than 20 days, he would forfeit everything offered.Geoffrey G. Butler, Simon Maccoby, The Development of International Law, p. 440 The European powers agreed to use all possible means of persuasion to effect the agreement, but Muhammad Ali hesitated, believing in support from France.Efraim Karsh, Inari Karsh, Empires of the Sand: The Struggle for Mastery in the Middle East, 1789-1923, (Harvard University Press, 2001), 38. =French position= The French under the newly formed cabinet of Prime Minister Adolphe Thiers sought to increase French influence in North Africa following their conquest of Algeria. For this, supporting Muhammad Ali's so far successful revolt seemed suitable. Counter Admiral Julien Pierre Anne Lalande was dispatched to the Mediterranean to eventually join forces with the defected Ottoman fleet.Efraim Karsh, Inari Karsh, Empires of the Sand: The Struggle for Mastery in the Middle East, 1789-1923, (Harvard University Press, 2001), 37. But France became politically isolated when the other Great Powers backed up the Sultan, and Thiers wasn't prepared to bring the country into open war with Britain. France switched sides and aligned against Muhammad Ali in October 1840. Military campaign in the bombardment of Acre, 1840 In September 1840, the European powers eventually moved from diplomatic means to military action. When French support for Muhammad Ali failed to materialize, British and Austrian naval forces in the eastern Mediterranean moved against Syria and Alexandria.H. Wood Jarvis, Pharaoh to Farouk, (London: John Murray, 1956), 134. Alexandria was the port where the defecting Ottoman fleet had withdrawn. After the Royal Navy and the Austrian Navy first blockaded the Nile delta coastline, they moved east to shell Sidon and Beirut on 11 September 1840. British and Austrian forces then attacked Acre. Following the bombardment of the city and the port on 3 November 1840 a small landing party of Austrian, British and Ottoman troops (which were led personally by the Austrian fleet commander, Archduke Friedrich) took the citadel after Muhammad Ali's Egyptian garrison in Acre had fled. Long-term results After the surrender of Acre, Muhammad Ali finally accepted the terms of the Convention on 27 November 1840. He renounced his claims over Crete and the Hijaz and agreed to downsize his naval forces and his standing army to 18,000 men, provided that he and his descendants would enjoy hereditary rule over Egypt and Sudan ‚Äî an unheard-of status for an Ottoman viceroy.Morroe Berger, Military Elite and Social Change: Egypt Since Napoleon, (Princeton, New Jersey: Center for International Studies, 1960), 11. A firman, subsequently issued by the sultan, indeed confirmed Muhammad Ali's rule over Egypt and the Sudan. He withdrew from Syria, the Hijaz, the Holy Land, Adana, and Crete, and handed back the Ottoman fleet.

Geography = Location= The nature park lies mainly in L√ºchow-Dannenberg and, after being extended in 2006, covers the majority of this rural district. It has an area of about and belongs to some of the most sparsely populated areas in Germany. The park originally included two very different geographical regions from which it derived its name: *the ridge of Drawehn in western L√ºchow-Dannenberg *the banks of the Elbe River (German: Elbufer) in northern L√ºchow-Dannenberg and partly in L√ºneburg district Both landscapes were formed by the ice age. The Drawehn is an end moraine from the penultimate glaciation - a heap of rock debris pushed by the ice sheet and left behind at the end of the glacier. The Elbe valley by contrast was a meltwater channel from the last ice age. History The park was founded in 1968. It is part of the Elbe River Landscape (Flusslandschaft Elbe), which was designated as a biosphere reserve by UNESCO in 1997 and overlaps with the Lower Saxon Elbe Water Meadows Biosphere Reserve (Nieders√§chsische Elbtalaue Biosph√§renreservat). On 1 June 2006 the protected area of the nature park was increased to , almost double its previous size. In Germany the mere designation of an area as a nature park does not make it a strict nature conservation area, but is first and foremost to promote tourism. Flora and fauna The vegetation of the nature park varies depending on the relief and soil composition. The higher, sandy podsol soils supported extensive areas of heath until the 18th century. Today, following afforestation, they are covered by large pine forests. On clayey soils there are the remnants of a natural deciduous forest vegetation, especially in the G√∂hrde. The better soils have been turned into arable fields. The banks of the Elbe are under special protection as breeding, stopover and winter sites on the bird migration routes between Siberia and Africa. During the summer months more than 150 species of bird breed here and white and black storks, cranes, herons and white-tailed eagles can be seen. In autumn and winter migrating cranes, ducks, geese and swans may be observed. The lower Middle Elbe basin with its rich water meadow is also of outstanding important for amphibians such as the European fire-bellied toad, the European tree frog and the moor frog.

A post office opened in Fairview in 1873, with Francis Braden as the first postmaster. The post office name in Coos County led to complications in Fairview in Multnomah County, where the post office at the Fairview railway station was temporarily named Cleone to avoid using the same name for two different post offices.

The museum had chosen a nickname, \\"BoMu\\", before it was terminated. Theme The Museum proposed to bring the region's 400-year history into focus, inspiring local residents and visitors from across the globe to explore Boston‚Äôs rich heritage, historic sites and cultural attractions. A museum and marketplace concept was in development, with additional plans for a low-lying pedestrian bridge to serve as a gateway to the museum and a critical connector of park parcels along the Rose Kennedy Greenway. The proposal included five core exhibition galleries, a gallery for national touring exhibitions, an all-purpose theater space, educational spaces, a City Room, a ground-floor marketplace, and a green roof. =Educational mission= The Boston Museum planned to broaden and deepen the appreciation of Boston as a \\"living classroom\\" and campus for thematic learning through partnerships with other historic sites and cultural institutions, sharing best practices and working in concert to create new programming and enrichment activities for educators and students throughout the region. It also hoped to reach out to national audiences through extensive use of electronic links and new media technology. The Boston Museum planned to be a transformative educational experience for learners of all ages and styles. Its galleries would have used a wide variety of approaches aimed at engaging families, school children and adults at all stages of life. Most importantly, the stories visitors encountered would have had personal resonance, whether of ancestors arriving on Long Wharf or their own physical relationship to the place of Boston. Location If designated by the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority, the museum would have been built on Parcel 9 in Downtown Boston, adjacent to the Rose Kennedy Greenway, Faneuil Hall, the Quincy Market, and abutting from the downtown Haymarket. The Boston Museum would have built a pedestrian bridge on Parcel 12, which would have directly connected the Greenway to the Museum. In October 2005 the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority designated the project as the official developer for Parcel 12. Structure The planned building was to have been designed by Cambridge Seven Associates. Since beginning in approximately March 2010, Rose Kennedy Greenway planners believed the Greenway was better suited for natural attractions than for large buildings, Boston Museum planners, including CEO Frank Keefe began looking for another location off the Greenway. The original planned building was designed by Moshe Safdie and Associates and was estimated to cost $124 million. The proposal included exhibition galleries, theater spaces, a series of education and meeting rooms, a grand hall for large public meetings and a grand concourse. The building would also have featured restaurants and an information center, as well as green space. The Safdie Proposal was superseded by a new plan calling for a different design due to Parcel 12 site conditions. The need to build over two highway ramps would have added such additional cost that the Boston Museum Project sought permission to construct a smaller alternate project on Parcel 9 \\"The Haymarket\\". Parcel 12 would then have been used as the site of a sculptural bridge leading pedestrian traffic across to be able to enter the museum or walk on toward North Station. =Core galleries= * Place Over Time would have told the story of the ecological and economic transformation of Massachusetts. * Conscience and Confrontation would have explored the periodic eruption of political contention ruling Massachusetts, which has often set an agenda for political change across the nation and the globe. * People of the Bay would have explored the succession of cultures, from native peoples through the latest wave of immigrants, as they created personal, family, community, and inter-group experiences in this region. * Innovation Odyssey would have focused on the region‚Äôs many breakthroughs and ‚Äúfirsts‚Äù that have had a global reach, spreading liberty and the abolition of slavery, advancing the causes of universal education and expanded health care, igniting both the Industrial Revolution and the Information Age. * Sports Town was envisioned as an entry point for visitors who might not see themselves as typical museum-goers. They would have been drawn into the gallery - and the museum beyond - because exhibit content would have related to their lifelong passion of sports, which had many \\"firsts\\" is Massachusetts. Termination In November 2012, the Massachusetts Department of Transportation rejected the Boston Museum's bid to be designated as the developer of Parcel 9, adjacent to the Rose Kennedy Greenway, a site created by the Big Dig highway construction project. In January 2013, the Board of the Boston Museum voted to terminate its efforts to build a museum and to disband the organization.

St Bartholomew's Parish Church stands on high ground to the west of the town. The first Saxon church was founded before the end of the 9th century as a \\"minster\\", or main church of a Saxon royal estate that included an area which later became the parishes of Seaborough, Wayford and Misterton. This church was replaced after the Norman Conquest with a larger stone cruciform building, with a central tower. This was almost completely rebuilt and enlarged in the late 15th and early 16th centuries. This is, for the most part, the church building visible today. It is an excellent example of the Perpendicular style with many unusual and individual features. These include the west front, the nave, the six-light aisle windows and the Tudor-style chapels and windows in the north east corner. The building material is golden-coloured Ham Hill stone, quarried a few miles north of Crewkerne. There is a notable pair of 'green man' carvings within the church. No major alterations have been made since the Reformation in the 1530s and 1540s, but there have been many changes to the interior to accommodate various phases of Church of England worship. Among these are an oven used for baking communion bread in the south east corner of the north chapel. During the Civil War, considerable damage was done including the destruction of nearly all of the medieval stained glass. William III of England worshipped in the church following his landing in the Glorious Revolution of 1689. By the early 19th century, all the medieval furnishings, except the Norman font had disappeared. New pews were made and the west galleries were added in 1808‚Äì11. The latest restoration that has left the church interior visible today, took place in the late 19th century; it was more sympathetic to the church's architectural character than many Victorian restorations. At this time, the central section of the west gallery was removed to reveal the great west window and the organ was relocated to the south transept. The pews date from around 1900 and have attractive carved bench-ends. Christ Church, a chapel of ease to St Bartholomew's, was built on South Street in 1852‚Äì54 to the designs of James Mountford Allen. The church was declared redundant in 1969, and demolished in 1975 to make way for the residential Christchurch Court.

In 1994 after the County of Hawaii announced plans to build an 80 stall parking lot, Hawaiian Kupuna (elders) helped form a group known as the La‚Äôaloa Ohana (family). This led to agreements being made to create a Hawaiian Cultural/Educational center in 1995. In June 1995 more than 13 members of the La‚Äôaloa Ohana were arrested for attempted camping, even though according to police reports a majority of ohana had left the park, prior to its closing. The ohana continued to advocate for complete Preservation Planning and in 1997 a detailed Community based Preservation Plan was completed. The effect of this Plan was that only 25 parking stalls could be developed. While the County of Hawaii said in the 1997 Environmental Impact Statement that they would install protective measures for the Historic site prior to any construction, in 2000 they built the parking lot, and as of 2014 the Protective measures have yet to be completed. In August 2014, based on the continued advocacy by La‚Äôaloa Ohana members, the State of Hawaii Historic Preservation Division, supported by the Department of Land and Natural Resources Conservation Investigators, forwarded to the Mayor of the County of Hawaii a scathing letter and demand they implement all of the Protective measures, or potentially they could face millions of dollars in fines. In December 2014 the County of Hawaii is currently starting to implement the Preservation Plan. Unfortunately many of the historic sites have now been severely damaged. Based on the ongoing and tireless efforts of members of the La'aloa Ohana, on May 10, 2017 the County of Hawaii announced it would be closing the parking lot at La'aloa Beach Park on May 17, 2017, indefinitely, due to the ongoing desecration caused by the parking lot. Please visit the La'aloa Beach Park Facebook page for additional information, we look forward to your kokua. It is located on Alii Drive in the Kona District at coordinates .

Uzdunrobita was founded on August 19, 1991, as a joint venture between a group of American investors, the International Communications Group, with a 45% stake; and the government of what was then the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic, with a 55% stake. When Uzbekistan declared independence several weeks later, the registration of the joint venture was shifted from Moscow to Tashkent, with the government stake taken over by the independent Uzbek government. Shortly thereafter, to overcome a shortage of capital, the American investors sold more than half their stake to a group of Pakistani investors, for $2 million and a stake in a Pakistani pay-phone company. The Uzbek government additionally provided free equipment and use of its engineers and staff. The American investors included a group from Perry, Ga, that consisted of a dentist, an eye doctor, an insurance man, an engineer and a stockbroker organized by the red-haired Brian L.

Gulnora Karimova gained control of the firm in the late 1990s or early 2000s, and by 2005 it was 74% owned by Russia's MTS, which paid $121 million for the stake. In 2006 it was reported to have 250,000 subscribers, ahead of Daewoo Unitel, which had 100,000, and a number of much smaller firms. The company launched an LTE network on 2.6GHz in July 2010, and receive a license to expand it on 700MHz in December 2010. In August 2012, the government of Uzbekistan revoked the company's operating license and arrested several of its top management, citing repeated regulatory violations. MTS protested the action as a \\"shakedown\\", but was unable to effectively oppose it, and moved to write down its stake.

URL: https://books.google.com/books?id=_wMGAAAAQAAJ There are two other dedications to Saint Twrog: at Bodwrog in Anglesey and at Llandwrog. When Twrog first arrived in the village, the valley would have been very marshy, which provided him with the wattle that he would have needed to build his cell. Out the church near to the belfry door is a large stone known as Maen Twrog (maen being the Welsh for stone). Twrog is reputed to have thrown the stone from the top of Moelwyn crushing a pagan altar in the valley below; it is said that his handprints can still be seen in the stone. The parish of Maentwrog gets its name from this stoneThe Lives of the British Saints: The Saints of Wales, Cornwall and Irish Saints By S. Baring-Gould, John Fisher, Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion (London, England) Edition: illustrated Published by Kessinger Publishing, 2005, . URL: https://books.google.com/books?id=0jLjYgygkB0C The yew trees in the churchyard are said to be over 1300 years old. They were a feature of the ancient pagan burial places, their evergreen leaves being a symbol of immortality; however, 1300 years ago the site would have been Christian not pagan. Another use of the yew trees was for military purposes as the yew timber was excellent for making bows, but because of the poisonous nature of the yew trees they were not popular among the people and were therefore grown in relative safety in places such as churchyards. The church that was on the site before 1896 was dedicated to Saint Mary, which has a connection to the Cistercian monks who were very numerous in the Maentwrog valley at one time. In the village there is also Saint Mary's well and across the valley is Llyn Mair (Saint Mary's Lake). In 1504, the church was described as a chapelry attached to the extensive parish of Ffestiniog. During the years 1572 to 1624, the notable Edmwnd Prys was rector of the church. He translated the metrical psalms into Welsh, and the present west window commemorates his work.A topographical dictionary of Wales, a continuation of the topography of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland by Nicholas Carlisle Published 1811. URL: https://books.google.com/books?id=ATITAAAAQAAJ The church was rebuilt in 1814 on the old foundations and was described as a neat stone edifice and was rectangular with a square embattled tower. There was no chancel at that time, the altar being placed in front of the present altar rails, with the door and porch being on the north side. On the west wall of the church there were three small windows. In 1896 a new chancel was built along with a baptistery and new stained glass windows were installed consisting of the east and west windows and the small \\"Good Shepherd\\" window. The vestry window \\"Son of Consolation\\" is in memory of William Edward Oakeley, benefactor of the parish, with whose help the church was restored in 1896, his wife Mary Oakeley executed the beautiful carvings. During this alteration, the bell was replaced by an eight tubular bells and the present organ was installed at the same time. The old bell was installed in the village school tower. The architect responsible for the alteration work to the church in 1896 was John Douglas who was also responsible for the design of the lych gate. There are some memorials on the north side of the church and on both sides of the altar which were transferred from the 1814 church, and there is a carving of Saint Twrog on the pulpit. A fragment of Edmwnd Prys' pulpit also remains. The parish register goes back to 1695. Outside in the graveyard are three Celtic Cross style memorials to members of the Oakeley family. There is also a very old attractive church entrance gate which opens on the main road in Maentwrog.
