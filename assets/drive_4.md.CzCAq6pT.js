It was the first non-Italy-based battle of the War of the Second Coalition. The battle resulted in the victory of the Austrian forces, under the command of Archduke Charles, over the French forces, commanded by Jean- Baptiste Jourdan. The battle occurred during Holy Week, 1799, amid rain and dense fog. Initially, the French were able to take, and hold, Ostrach and the nearby hamlet of Ho√ükirch plus several strategic points on the Ostrach marsh. As the engagement began, Habsburg numerical superiority overwhelmed French defenses. By evening, the French left wing was flanked and Jourdan's men retreated from Ostrach to the Pfullendorf heights. On the next morning, as Jourdan considered a counter-attack, the weather broke, and he could look down on the Austrian battle array. The numbers and dispositions of the Austrians convinced him that any attack would be useless, and that he could not hope to maintain his position in the heights. As he withdrew, a portion of his right flank was cut off from the main force. Although casualties appeared even on both sides, the Austrians had a significantly larger fighting force, both on the field at Ostrach, and stretched along a line between Lake Constance and Ulm. French casualties amounted to eight percent of the force and Austrian, approximately four percent. The French withdrew to Engen and Stockach, where a few days later the armies engaged again, this time with greater losses on both sides, and an Austrian victory. Background Initially, the rulers of Europe, such as Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor, viewed the revolution in France as an event between the French king and his subjects, and not something in which they should interfere. As the rhetoric grew more strident, however, the other monarchies started to view events with alarm. In 1790, Leopold succeeded his brother Joseph as emperor and by 1791, he considered the situation surrounding his sister, Marie Antoinette, and her children, with greater and greater alarm. In August 1791, in consultation with French √©migr√© nobles and Frederick William II of Prussia, he issued the Declaration of Pillnitz, in which they declared the interest of the monarchs of Europe as one with the interests of Louis and his family. They threatened ambiguous, but quite serious, consequences if anything should happen to the royal family.Timothy Blanning. The French Revolutionary Wars, New York: Oxford University Press, pp. 41‚Äì59. The French Republican position became increasingly difficult. Compounding problems in international relations, French √©migr√©s continued to agitate for support of a counter-revolution abroad. Chief among them were the Prince Cond√©, his son, the Duke de Bourbon, and his grandson, the Duke d'Enghien. From their base in Koblenz, immediately over the French border, they sought direct support for military intervention from the royal houses of Europe, and raised an army.Blanning, pp. 44‚Äì59. On 20 April 1792, the French National Convention declared war on Austria. In this War of the First Coalition (1792‚Äì1798), France ranged itself against most of the European states sharing land or water borders with her, plus Portugal and the Ottoman Empire. Although the Coalition forces achieved several victories at Verdun, Kaiserslautern, Neerwinden, Mainz, Amberg and W√ºrzburg, the efforts of Napoleon Bonaparte in northern Italy pushed Austrian forces back and resulted in the negotiation of the Peace of Leoben (17 April 1797) and the subsequent Treaty of Campo Formio (October 1797).Blanning, pp. 41‚Äì59. The treaty called for meetings between the involved parties to work out the exact territorial and remunerative details, to be convened at Rastatt. The French demand for more territory than originally agreed upon stalled negotiations. Despite their agreement at Campo Formio and the ongoing meetings at Rastatt, the two primary combatants of the First Coalition, France and Austria, were highly suspicious of the other's motives. Several diplomatic incidents undermined the agreement. The Austrians were reluctant to cede the designated territories and the Rastatt delegates could not, or would not, orchestrate the transfer of agreed upon territories to compensate the German princes for their losses. Ferdinand of Naples refused to pay tribute to France, followed by the Neapolitan rebellion, invasion by France, and the subsequent establishment of the Parthenopean Republic. Republican uprising in the Swiss cantons, encouraged by the French Republic with military support, led to the establishment of the Helvetic Republic.Blanning, pp. 230‚Äì232. Other factors contributed to the rising tensions as well. On his way to Egypt in 1798, Napoleon had stopped on the Island of Malta and forcibly removed the Hospitallers from their possessions. This angered Paul, Tsar of Russia, who was the honorary head of the Order. The French Directory, furthermore, was convinced that the Austrians were conniving to start another war. Indeed, the weaker the French Republic seemed, the more seriously the Austrians, the Neapolitans, the Russians and the English actually discussed this possibility.John Gallagher. Napoleon's enfant terrible: General Dominique Vandamme, Tulsa: University of Oklahoma Press, 2008, p. 70. Prelude Archduke Charles of Austria had taken command of the army in late January. Although he was unhappy with the strategy set forward by his brother, the Holy Roman Emperor Francis II, he had acquiesced to the less ambitious plan to which Francis and the Aulic Council had agreed: Austria would fight a defensive war and would maintain a continuous defensive line from the Danube to northern Italy. The archduke had stationed himself at Friedberg for the winter, east-south-east of Augsburg. The army was already settled into cantonments in the environs of Augsburg, extending south along the Lech river.Blanning, p. 232; Gunther E. Rothenberg.

As winter broke in 1799, on 1 March, General Jean-Baptiste Jourdan and his army of 25,000,John Young, D.D. A History of the Commencement, Progress, and Termination of the Late War between Great Britain and France which continued from the first day of February 1793 to the first of October 1801, in two volumes.

Instructed to block the Austrians from access to the Swiss alpine passes, the Army of the Danube would ostensibly isolate the armies of the Coalition in Germany from allies in northern Italy, and prevent them from assisting one another; furthermore, if the French held the interior passes in Switzerland, they could use the routes to move their own forces between the two theaters. The Army of the Danube, meeting little resistance, advanced through the Black Forest in three columns, through the H√∂llental (H√∂lle valley), via Oberkirch, and Freudenstadt, and a fourth column advanced along the north shore of the Rhine.Blanning, p. 232. Although Jourdan might have been better advised to establish a position on the eastern slope of the mountains, he did not.Rothenberg, pp. 49‚Äì50. Instead, he pushed across the Danube plain and took up position between Rottweil and Tuttlingen, and eventually pushing toward the imperial city of Pfullendorf in Upper Swabia. French troops wintered in France and crossed the Rhine, moving toward Ostrach in March 1799; Austrian troops wintered in Bavaria, crossed the Lech, and approached Ostrach from the east. News of the French advance across the Rhine took three days to reach Charles at Augsburg. The Austrian Vorhut (advance guard), 17,000 men under the command of Field marshal Friedrich Joseph, Count of Nauendorf, crossed the Lech in three columns, the first at Babenhausen, marching in the direction of Biberach, the second, and strongest, at Memmingen, marching in the direction of Waldsee, and the third at Leutkirch, heading in the direction of Ravensburg. The main force of 53,000 men, under the command of the Archduke, crossed the Lech by Augsburg, Landsberg and Schongau, and six battalions of 6,600 men crossed the Danube at Ulm. An additional force of 13,000 troops under the command of Lieutenant Field Marshal Anton Szt√°ray marched toward Neumarkt in the direction of Rednitz.Smith, p. 147. Eventually, 10,000 men under the command of General Friedrich Freiherr von Hotze marched north from Feldkirch in Switzerland, but they did not arrive in time to participate at either the battle at Ostrach, or for the subsequent battle at Stockach.David Hollins, Austrian Commanders of the Napoleonic Wars, 1792‚Äì1815. London, Osprey, 2004, pp. 18‚Äì19. Locale Ostrach was a small village, with a population of 300. The village belonged to the Cistercian Imperial Abbey of Salem, an influential and wealthy ecclesiastical territory on Lake Constance. The village was largely dedicated to farming, although a stretch of the imperial post road connected it and Pfullendorf. A wide, flat plain, marshy in places, stretched between the base of the Pfullendorf heights and the village; low lying hills ringed the valley, which was creased by a small stream from which the village takes its name.Jean-Baptiste Jourdan. A Memoir of the operations of the army of the Danube under the command of General Jourdan, taken from the manuscripts of that officer, London: Debrett, 1799, p. 164. Ostrach itself lies almost at the northern end of this plain, but slightly south of the Danube itself. The two armies faced each other across this small and, at that time of that year, very soggy valley.Young, p. 228. Dispositions By 7 March, the first Austrian soldiers arrived in Ostrach.Blanning, p. 232; Ruth Broda. \\"Schlacht von Ostrach:\\" j√§hrt sich zum 210. Mal Feier am Wochenende. Wie ein Dorf zum Kriegsschauplatz wurde. In: S√ºdkurier vom 13. Mai 2009 The French advance guard arrived by the 9th, under command of General Fran√ßois Joseph Lefebvre; in the forward line, the 25th Demi-brigade and Light Infantry positioned themselves between Ostrach and Ho√ükirch; Lefebvre also had three battalions each of the 53rd and 67th Demi- Brigades of light infantry, twenty squadrons of hussars, chasseurs, and dragoons, and field artillery pieces.Smith, p. 147; Jourdan, pp. 140‚Äì144; Broda, S√ºdkurier. By 12 March, the village and the surrounding farms were filled with Lancers (Ulanen) and Hussars (Hussaren) and by the 17th, the Austrian advance guard had established forward posts at Buchau, Altshausen and Waldsee.Broda. S√ºdkurier. The remainder of Charles' army, at this point nearly 110,000 strong, had established itself along a line from Ulm to Lake Constance.Phipps, pp. 49‚Äì50; Young, p. 227. By 18 March, Jourdan had formed his headquarters at Pfullendorf, on the heights above Ostrach. In front of him stood the largest part of his cavalry and half of his infantry. The center, including the 4th Regiment of Hussars, the 1st of Chasseurs √† Cheval, and two squadrons of the 17th Dragoons, lay behind Ostrach, under command of General Klein. Jourdan distributed them in three columns, the strongest on the post road by Saulgau, another on the road in the direction of Altshausen, and a third at the hamlet of Friedberg.Phipps, pp. 49‚Äì50; Young, pp. 227‚Äì228. The flank of Lefebvre's division, with 7,000 men, commanded by Laurent Saint-Cyr extended to the Danube; by the time skirmishing began, Vandamme, was still in the environs of Stuttgart, with 3,000 men, looking in vain for Austrian forces that might be stationed there, and he played no part in the battle.John Gallagher. Napoleon's enfant terrible: General Dominique Vandamme. Tulsa: University of Oklahoma Press, 2008, , pp. 76‚Äì77. The far right, under command of Ferino, angled south from Pfullendorf to Lake Constance, or the Bodensee. The cavalry reserve of 3,000 under General Jean-Joseph Ange d'Hautpoul included a battalion of the 53rd Demi-Brigade, and waited in close column in the environs of Pfullendorf.Young, pp. 220‚Äì228; Jourdan, pp. 140‚Äì144 Battle Jourdan considered his position superior to the Austrian's, protected as he was by the marshy plain between his positions and the Austrian front, and he thought he had another three days to consolidate his positions. His forces occupied Ho√ükirch, and a couple of other points he considered strategic: the causeway (post road) that passed Saulgau (today Bad Saulgau), the village of Altshausen east, and the hamlet of Friedberg, to the north- north-east of Ostrach. These positions created a perimeter around Ostrach. He was unaware that the Archduke had arrived by forced marches from Augsburg to the vicinity of Ostrach; Jourdan thought the main force of Charles' army was still at least three days' march away.Jourdan, p. 178. By the middle of Holy Week in 1799, more than a third of Charles' army, 48,000 mixed troops, was positioned in a formation parallel to Jourdan's, and his 72,000 remaining troops were arrayed with the left wing at Kempten, the center near Memmingen, and the right flank extended to Ulm.Phipps, pp. 49‚Äì50; Young, pp. 220‚Äì228.  Skirmishing  As the armies assembled in their positions, the flanks and forward outposts encountered one another in several skirmishes; indeed, they had been skirmishing for seven days, until 19 March, when the outposts of both armies nearly overlapped.Edward Cust (Sir). Annals of the wars of the eighteenth century, compiled from the most authentic histories of the period. London: Mitchell's military library, 1857‚Äì1860, p. 166. On the right wing, General Ferino's men encountered an Austrian column of volunteer infantry and some light cavalry from one of the border Hussar regiments, and took 70 and 80 prisoners, respectively, including several officers. All of this happened without the Austrians knowing that there was an official declaration of war. On 20 March, a French emissary arrived at camp of Prince Schwarzenberg, a major general commanding a brigade of the advanced guard. The emissary asked if he possessed a declaration of war from Vienna, and upon being informed that Schwarzenberg had received no such declaration, informed him that the armistice established at Campo Formio was ended, and there existed between France and Austria a state of war. General Jourdan reportedly began a general attack when the emissary left,From the Hamburgh Mail. \\"Private Correspondence\\", Hamburgh, 2 March 1799, reported in The Times, 8 April 1799, pg. 3; col A. although other sources do not bear out the scale of the attack.Phipps, pp. 49‚Äì50. Ostrach and the nearby villages. Initially, the strength of the French advance guard pushed the most forward of the Austrian right to Saulgau and Ratzenreute, east of Ostrach, backing the Austrian main army against the Schussen river.Jourdan, p. 146. Jean Victor Tharreau's mixed brigade of infantry, light infantry and cavalry encountered the Austrians at Barendorf, and forced them to give up the ground; immediately, Charles sent reinforcements, and the Austrians regained what they had lost. At the center of the French line, at Ho√ükirch, east-south-east of Ostrach, General Lefebvre's column attacked the Austrians in an action that lasted most of the day. The Austrian line included several seasoned Grenzer (border) regiments, the Vecsy Hussars, and some lancers; although Lefebvre's initial assault caused confusion in the Austrian ranks, the Lancers counter-attacked with ferocity and, joined by the Grenzers and the Hussars, pursued the French along the Ostrach river valley, and cut up four squadrons of the 8th Regiment of Chasseurs √† Cheval.\\"Private Correspondence\\", The Times, 8 April 1799. Lefebvre's column was forced out of the hamlet by the Austrians, who had four battalions, 1200 horse, and six cannons.Phipps, pp. 49‚Äì50; Jourdan, pp. 145‚Äì149. After bringing up additional reinforcements‚Äîseveral light artillery, Chasseurs √† Cheval, Hussars, and the 17th Regiment of Dragoons, Lefebvre was able to take the village again. By 0500 of 21 March, however, he sent word to Jourdan that he was being attacked on all posts by the Austrians, and they must soon expect a general engagement.Jourdan, pp. 144‚Äì145.  General engagement  Charles had divided his force into columns, and at close to 1000, the Austrians attacked in force, with simultaneous assaults upon multiple positions. With Nauendorf's advance force moved with 11 battalions and 20 squadrons on Saint Cyr's position .Cust, p. 166. Following behind with the main force of the right column, F√ºrstenberg had little difficulty pushing the French out of Davidsweiler and advanced on Ruppersweiler an Einhard to the northwest. His force pressured elements of Saint Cyr's thinly manned line, and the entire line fell back slowly, to maintain contact with its flanks. Maximilian, Count of Merveldt's force, attacking on Saint Cyr's far left flank, continued to pressure the line, which started to crumble. Further south, Olivier, Count of Wallis took a column of 18 battalions and 42 squadrons and attacked the Adjutant General Fran√ßois-Xavier Octavie Fontaine's French line at Riedhausen, between Ostrach and Ferino's column at Salem. In the maneuvering, the cross-fire trapped French forces; at Riedhausen, unable to take cover, they were cut down from both sides.Jourdan, p. 160. Charles himself took a main column along the high road, a causeway that passed by Saulgau,Thomas Graham, 1st Baron Lynedoch. The History of the campaign of 1796 in Germany and Italy. London, 1797. p. 70. to attack Lefebvre on points between Ho√ükirch and Ostrach. In this deployment of his force, Charles sought to dislodge the center of the French line from its position in Ostrach, separating the wings from the main body of force and overcoming both separately.Graham, p. 69. The convergence of the two columns on the French at Ostrach demonstrated the advantage of the superiority of Austrian numbers. From every angle, the Austrians threatened to overwhelm the French. Jourdan wrote that his men disappeared under a cloud of red coats.Although the Habsburg Infantry wore white coats, some grenadier and hussar units wore red. Jourdan himself says that the coats were red, and an English source confirms this. Jourdan, p. 145. Times, 5 April 1799. Battalion after battalion of Austrians threw themselves against the French defenses.Jourdan, pp. 145‚Äì146. By late morning, Charles' troops pushed the French out of Ho√ükirch, and into Ostrach, which the French nearly lost until Jourdan sent reinforcements. The fighting remained fierce until about 1600, when the French pulled back toward Pfullendorf, encouraged by Austrian cavalry. Once out of Ostrach, and established on the road at and around Pfullendorf, the French formed a new perimeter, reinforced by reserves of Soulham, and enjoyed the benefit of altitude from which they could fire down upon the attacking Austrians. Despite the punishing musket fire, Charles' strategy worked. The far right wing (Ferino's force), which had not been attacked yet, fell back to Salem Abbey, to maintain communication with the French center.Graham, pp. 67‚Äì68. At the Pfullendorf heights, the fight began anew. Charles sent two strong columns of eight battalions each across the Ostrach stream. The French poured fire on the Austrians, who took heavy losses, but did not give up the ground. In the night, F√ºrstenberg broke through the French line to Einhard, flanking Jourdan's main force and cutting off Saint Cyr. Further south, Wallis threatened to do the same to Fontaine and Ferino.Cust, p. 166; Sir Archibald Alison. A History of Europe from the Commencement of the French Revolution in 1789 to the Restoration of the Bourbons. New York: A.S. Barnes, 1850, p. 115; Phipps, pp. 49‚Äì50. As darkness fell, so ended the first day of fighting.Graham, p. 68.  Withdrawal  As Jourdan was deciding whether or not to attempt another foray, the fog lifted and revealed the scene below him. He wrote later, : > \\"... [W]e discovered an immense line of cavalry and infantry. It may be > said, without exaggeration, that the troops which engaged our advanced guard > amounted to twenty-five thousand men. I now perceived the absolute > impossibility of making any further resistance against such a superior > force, as well as the danger that threatened the division, from the > advantage which the enemy had gained on the left. I therefore ordered > General Soult to fall back with the division to the post before Pfulendorf > [sic].\\"Jourdan, p. 159. He was wrong; the Austrians engaged with the French advance guard numbered closer to 50,000, and constituted the main body of Charles' army, not its advance guard.Phipps, pp. 78‚Äì79; Young, pp. 229‚Äì231. In the night, Charles also had moved additional troops to renew the attack on the Pfullendorf heights at daybreak. On 21 March, at 2200, Jourdan ordered the wounded to be transported to Schaffhausen in Switzerland, via Stockach. The main army then began its own retreat in the early morning of 22 March. The reserve division of d'Hautpoul left first, and pulled back via Stockach to Emmingen ob Egg. According to Jourdan, the retreat occurred in perfect order, and was supported in particular by a company of sappers, who blew up the bridges in the face of enemy fire, and then fought like grenadiers.Jourdan, pp. 159‚Äì60. The Austrians outflanked Saint Cyr's forces on the right flank and General Ferino, at the southernmost point, retreated to Salem, to maintain the line with the remainder of the French force.Phipps, pp. 49‚Äì50; Jourdan, p. 178. When the first division pulled back to Bodman, on the northern tip of the √úberlingen- finger of Lake Constance, a portion of the force was encircled and cut off by the 2nd Lancers of Karl Philipp, Prince Schwarzenberg's brigade, and more than 500 were taken prisoner. Roland Kessinger, '\\"Die Schlacht von Stockach am 25. M√§rz 1799\\". Zeitschrift f√ºr Milit√§rgeschichte. Salzburg: √ñst. Milizverlag, 1997‚Äì. [2006], p. 3. Other sources are less sanguine in their assessment of Jourdan's retreat. Jourdan's forces, especially his left flank, were severely pressed; the French line collapsed upon itself at both ends as the soldiers fell back. A dispatch to Paris, later reported in the Times, claimed that the French intent had been betrayed to the Austrians by a deserter,\\"Engagements Between The Grand Armies of the Archduke and General Jourdan.\\" The Times, Friday, 5 April 1799; pg. 2; col A. but there is some evidence that this was Jourdan's mendacious attempt to explain the apparent surprise with which the Austrians attacked.Graham, p. 72. A British report claimed that the French commander had two horses shot from under him,Times, 5 April 1799. but Jourdan himself reported that only one horse was shot, and he was thrown, stunned, to the ground.Jourdan, p. 161; Cust, p. 166. Lefebvre received a musket ball in the wristThe Times 5 April 1799. Other sources report he lost his arm: See \\"Private Correspondence\\", The Times, 8 April 1799, pg. 3; col A. and had to be carried from the field; command of his division was given to the rising star Jean-de-Dieu Soult. Furthermore, a sizable portion‚Äîsources are not clear on how many‚Äîof the French right wing (Ferino's force) had been cut off from its main force, and made prisoner. Finally, General Friedrich Freiherr von Hotze was quickly making his way north with 10,000 men from Feldkirch and prepared to attack Jourdan's army from the south.Phipps, pp. 49‚Äì50; Young, pp. 229‚Äì231. Aftermath Eventually, Jourdan withdrew first to Messkirch (sometimes spelled M√∂√ükirch or Me√ükirch), and when that city was no longer defensible, fell back to Stockach, and then again Engen, but he wrote that the armies had been well-matched; French valor, he wrote, overcame servitude.Phipps, pp. 49‚Äì50 Young, p. 228; Jourdan, p. 178. His men had taken many Austrian prisoners, and he knew also that many Austrians lay dead or wounded on the field of battle. His army itself had losses, but their valor in death matched the ambitious tyranny of the Austrians: Charles had driven his army hard, he wrote, and the Austrians would not pursue the gallant, liberty-loving French; Charles' failure to pursue the French affirmed Jourdan's perception that his had not been a defeat followed by retreat, but rather a strategic withdrawal. Jourdan probably did not know that Charles had been ordered to maintain a continuous and orderly defensive line with troops to the south. Jourdan's own assessment did not match that of his superiors in Paris, who recognized that the loss of twelve percent of the fighting force, versus less than four percent for the adversary, did not amount to a draw.Phipps, pp. 49‚Äì50 Young, p. 230. Furthermore, this first attempt to cut the Austrians off from access to the upper Rhine and Lake Constance had not succeeded.Phipps, pp. 49‚Äì50; Young, p. 231. There were other considerations, primarily that Jourdan simply did not have enough men to fight not only this battle but the subsequent ones as well.Adolphe Thiers. The history of the French revolution. New York: Appleton, 1854, v. 4, p. 370. Located at The architect of the monument was the Hohenzollern state conservator, Wilhelm Friedrich Laur. For his own part, the Archduke did not push his troops to pursue and capture the enemy, or even harass their retreat. Charles' slow pursuit might have been due to his own disgruntlement with Vienna's overarching defensive strategy and the undoubted difficulty of the battle itself, conducted with troops wearied by a forced march of , fighting in rain, fog, and on normally boggy terrain made more soggy by the heavy spring rains and snow melt. Regardless, he more than made up for these shortcomings within the week.Blanning, pp. 232, 264; Phipps, pp. 49‚Äì50. Five days after Jourdan's departure from Ostrach and Pfullendorf, the French and Austrian armies continued the fight at Stockach. This time, the decision could not be argued: The Army of the Danube could not hold the territory and withdrew into the Black Forest.Blanning, p. 264. The battle at Ostrach had been difficult, as Jourdan pointed out, due largely to the dense fog and terrible weather that hampered his observation of his enemy's movements, yet the same fog that blinded him to the Austrian movements did not seem to hamper Charles.Phipps, pp. 49‚Äì50; Young, pp. 228‚Äì230. The fog and rainy weather did play a role, however. On a local level, in the damp night of the 20th, which was Gr√ºndonnerstag, (German: Green Thursday, or Maundy Thursday), the Danube overflowed, backing up into the Ostrach, and causing it to burst its own banks. The flood trapped 300 civilians between the two armies intent on destruction; suspecting what was to come, Ostrachers huddled in their cellars, and hoped for the best and gasping for breath as the battle thundered overhead. Amazingly, none were killed, although they spent Easter Sunday caring for the wounded, and helping to bury the 4,000 or so soldiers who died in the battle. Broda, S√ºdkurier. Battle monument Prior to 1903, a simple wooden cross commemorated the battle site, located on the so-called Buchbuhl, a hill overlooking the village, and the plains to the southeast, where much of the fighting occurred. In 1903, a monument was erected to honor the battle. In 1945, when French troops arrived in the region, they closed the monument; the local pastor encouraged them to reopen it, calling it a chapel.

WWI Raffaele Rossetti (12 July 1881 ‚Äì 24 December 1951) was an Italian engineer and military naval officer who sank the main battleship of the Austro-Hungarian Empire at the end of World War I.Official Biography of Raffaele Rossetti He was also a politician of the Italian Republican Party. Biography Born at Genoa, Raffaele Rossetti graduated as engineer from the University of Turin in September 1904. He went to study in the Italian Naval Academy of Livorno, where become lieutenant for the Italian Navy Engineering Corps. In December 1906 he graduated in the speciality of \\"naval mechanics engineering\\" at the Politecnico di Milano. In 1909 was promoted to captain and in 1911 went to Libya during the Italo-Turkish War with the cruiser Pisa. During the first years of World War I worked as Director of the Navy Arsenal in La Spezia and was promoted to major. While working there he started to create a new weapon, based on his idea of a torpedo manned by a person, to be linked to enemy vessels underwater and explode under the ship hull. This weapon was called \\"mignatta\\" (leech) and was the precursor of the maiale of World War II and the actual human torpedo. Illustration of the mignatta (leech) manned submersible used to mine the SMS Viribus Unitis, Nov. 1918 On 1 November 1918 Rossetti used his \\"mignatta\\" to assault with Raffaele Paolucci the formerly Austrian battleship Viribus Unitis, which, unknown to them (the transfer had taken places a few hours before the action, when Luigi Rizzo had already left his base) had already changed hands to the newly established State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs and renamed Jugoslavija. After entering Pola harbour undetected, Rossetti and Paolucci placed limpet mines below the hull of the battleship; they were discovered and captured, and they informed the crew that the ship was going to sink, although they did not reveal that they had placed mines on the hull. The explosions were delayed, and the crew started reboarding the ship, believing they were lying. Shortly thereafter, the mines exploded, causing the Jugoslavija to capsize and sink, with heavy loss of life. Rossetti and Paolucci were awarded the Italian Gold Medal of Military Valor. Photos of the \\"mignatta\\" and the Viribus Unitis sinking This event is generally known as Raid on Pula. In 1919 Raffaele Rossetti retired as colonel. With the advent of the Italian Fascism, he became a member of the Italian Republican Party (PRI). He also founded the Anti-fascism movement \\"Italia libera\\" together with Giovanni Conti, Randolfo Pacciardi and others. In 1925 he was assailed by Fascist squads, and decided to move to France. Here he was part of the directive of Giustizia e Libert√†, an anti-fascist movement of Italian activists in Paris. In 1930 he exited the movement and, together with Cipriano Facchinetti, founded another anti-fascist movement, La Giovine Italia. In 1932 he was elected secretary of the exiled PRI, but the following year he was replaced by Pacciardi. During the Spanish Civil War, Rossetti moved to Barcelona, and collaborated with local radio by running anti-fascist slogans. In retaliation, the Italian government revoked his Gold Medal won during World War I. This measure was annulled after the Fascist government was ousted and Italy became a Republic after the end of World War II. He died in Milan in 1951.

Non-RAID drive architectures also exist, and are referred to by acronyms with similarity to RAID, several tongue-in-cheek * JBOD (derived from \\"just a bunch of disks\\"): described multiple hard disk drives operated as individual independent hard disk drives. * SPAN or BIG: A method of combining the free space on multiple hard disk drives from \\"JBoD\\" to create a spanned volume. Such a concatenation is sometimes also called BIG/SPAN. A SPAN or BIG is generally a spanned volume only, as it often contains mismatched types and sizes of hard disk drives. * MAID (derived from \\"massive array of idle drives\\"): an architecture using hundreds to thousands of hard disk drives for providing nearline storage of data, primarily designed for \\"Write Once, Read Occasionally\\" (WORO) applications, in which increased storage density and decreased cost are traded for increased latency and decreased redundancy.  JBOD (abbreviated from \\"Just a Bunch Of Disks\\"/\\"Just a Bunch Of Drives\\") is an architecture using multiple hard drives exposed as individual devices. Hard drives may be treated independently or may be combined into one or more logical volumes using a volume manager like LVM or mdadm; such volumes are usually called \\"spanned\\" or \\"linear  SPAN  BIG\\".Manage spanned volumesUsing spanned volumes A spanned volume provides no redundancy, so failure of a single hard drive amounts to failure of the whole logical volume. Redundancy for resilience and/or bandwidth improvement may be provided, in software, at a higher level.  Concatenation (SPAN, BIG)  Diagram of a SPAN/BIG (\\"JBOD\\") setup. Concatenation or spanning of drives is not one of the numbered RAID levels, but it is a popular method for combining multiple physical disk drives into a single logical disk. It provides no data redundancy. Drives are merely concatenated together, end to beginning, so they appear to be a single large disk. It may be referred to as SPAN or BIG (meaning just the words \\"span\\" or \\"big\\", not as acronyms). In the adjacent diagram, data are concatenated from the end of disk 0 (block A63) to the beginning of disk 1 (block A64); end of disk 1 (block A91) to the beginning of disk 2 (block A92). If RAID 0 were used, then disk 0 and disk 2 would be truncated to 28 blocks, the size of the smallest disk in the array (disk 1) for a total size of 84 blocks. What makes a SPAN or BIG different from RAID configurations is the possibility for the selection of drives. While RAID usually requires all drives to be of similar capacity and it is preferred that the same or similar drive models are used for performance reasons, a spanned volume does not have such requirements.  Implementations  The initial release of Microsoft's Windows Home Server employs drive extender technology, whereby an array of independent drives are combined by the OS to form a single pool of available storage. This storage is presented to the user as a single set of network shares. Drive extender technology expands on the normal features of concatenation by providing data redundancy through software ‚Äì a shared folder can be marked for duplication, which signals to the OS that a copy of the data should be kept on multiple physical drives, whilst the user will only ever see a single instance of their data. This feature was removed from Windows Home Server in its subsequent major release. Greyhole, a disk-pooling application, implements what it calls a \\"storage pool\\". This pool is created by presenting to the user, through Samba shares, a logical drive that is as large as the sum of all physical drives that are part of the pool. Greyhole also provides data redundancy through software - the user can configure, per share, the number of file copies that Greyhole is to maintain. Greyhole will then ensure that for each file in such shares, the correct number of extra copies are created and maintained on multiple physical drives. The user will only ever see one copy of each file.  MAID  MAID (abbreviated from \\"massive array of idle drives\\") is an architecture using hundreds to thousands of hard drives for providing nearline storage of data. MAID is designed for \\"Write Once, Read Occasionally\\" (WORO) applications. Compared to RAID technology, MAID has increased storage density, and decreased cost, electrical power, and cooling requirements. However, these advantages are at the cost of much increased latency, significantly lower throughput, and decreased redundancy. Drives designed for multiple spin-up/down cycles (e.g. laptop drives) are significantly more expensive. Latency may be as high as tens of seconds.Cook, Rick (2004-07-12). \\"Backup budgets have it MAID with cheap disk\\" Retrieved on 2008-07-15 MAID can supplement or replace tape libraries in hierarchical storage management. To allow a more gradual tradeoff between access time and power savings, some MAIDs such as Nexsan's AutoMAID incorporate drives capable of spinning down to a lower speed. Large scale disk storage systems based on MAID architectures allow dense packaging of drives and are designed to have only 25% of disks spinning at any one time.

Tech Valley began as a marketing name for the eastern part of the U.S. state of New York, encompassing the Capital District and the Hudson Valley. Originating in 1998 to promote the greater Albany area as a high-tech competitor to regions such as Silicon Valley and Boston, the moniker subsequently grew to represent the counties in New York between IBM's Westchester County plants in the south and the Canada‚ÄìUnited States border to the north, and has since evolved to constitute both the technologically-oriented metonym and the geographic territory comprising most of New York State north of New York City. The area's high technology ecosystem is supported by technologically-focused academic institutions including Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and the State University of New York Polytechnic Institute. Tech Valley grew from encompassing 19 counties straddling both sides of the Adirondack Northway and the New York Thruway, and with heavy state taxpayer subsidy, has experienced significant growth in the computer hardware side of the high-technology industry, with great strides in the nanotechnology sector, digital electronics design, and water- and electricity-dependent integrated microchip circuit manufacturing, involving companies including IBM in Armonk and its Thomas J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, GlobalFoundries in Malta, and others. As of 2015, venture capital investment in Tech Valley had grown to US$163 million. Westchester County has developed a burgeoning biotechnology sector in the 21st century, with over US$1 billion in planned private investment as of 2016, earning the county the nickname Biochester. History The name \\"Tech Valley\\", or \\"Techneurial Valley\\" as was originally used, is usually credited to Wallace \\"Wally\\" Altes, a former president of the Albany- Colonie Regional Chamber of Commerce (\\"the Chamber\\"), while the shortened name from \\"Techneurial\\" to \\"Tech\\" was the idea of Jay Burgess. In 1998, the Albany- Colonie Chamber began using Tech Valley as a marketing name for an initial ten-county area centered on New York's Capital District to show in name the merging of entrepreneurial activity and high-tech companies in the region. Tech Valley then evolved into a 19-county region in eastern New York stretching from the Canadian-US border to the northern suburbs of the city of New York. The 19 counties were Albany, Clinton, Columbia, Dutchess, Essex, Franklin, Fulton, Greene, Hamilton, Herkimer, Montgomery, Orange, Rensselaer, Saratoga, Schenectady, Schoharie, Ulster, Warren, and Washington. That region was 15,637 square miles, about 270 miles north-south at its longest and about 80 miles east-west at its widest. In 2010, those 19 counties had a population estimate in 2010 of 2,312,952, a 9.2 percent increase over the 2000 census; population density was 148 people/sq. mile. 51 percent of the population was female, with 48.2 percent male. 88.5 percent of the population was White, 6.2 percent Black, 4.9 percent Latino, 1.5 percent Asian, with a median age of 37.5 years. From the inception of the name, the Chamber stated that it would not limit the label of Tech Valley to just the Capital District; rather, Tech Valley was envisioned as running from IBM's Westchester County plants and headquarters north to Saratoga Springs and west up the Mohawk Valley. Early businesses that used the Tech Valley name helped spread the word, businesses such as Albany Molecular Research Inc. (AMRI) who used the phrase in its job recruitment material, MapInfo Corporation, Tech Valley Communications, Tech Valley Office Interiors, and Tech Valley Homes Real Estate. The first use of the phrase by a business may have been the accounting firm Urbach, Kahn, & Werlin in 1998, which put the Tech Valley name and logo on its postage meter, shortly before that the Chamber had begun instituting a new telephone greeting, \\"Albany-Colonie Chamber. Tech Valley. May I help you\\". Also in 1998, Rupprecht & Patashnick put \\"Made in New York's Tech Valley\\" stickers on all its air quality sensors for the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) national monitoring network. In 2000, Tech Valley license plates became available, with three numbers and the letters TEC, for a $34.50 fee, they were the first plates in New York that had a website on them- techvalley.org. Initially, the name Tech Valley was derided as over-enthusiastic self- boosterism, but SEMATECH's decision in 2002 to relocate its headquarters to the University at Albany, SUNY began Tech Valley's rise in the public's perception. In 2004, however, when Bill Gates was asked by an Albany Times Union reporter what he thought about Tech Valley, he responded that he had no idea where that was; two years later though, $400,000 from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation was used to fund the Tech Valley High School. Capchips.com is website with clippings of events and other news related to technology in Tech Valley.. [20] Luring a chip-fab plant The goal of luring a computer chip fabrication plant (chip fab) was one of the earliest goals of, and reasons underlying, the Tech Valley name. The plan to get a chip fab to the Capital District predates the Tech Valley slogan. In 1997, New York set out submissions for possible chip fab sites that it could whittle to 10 sites around the state that would be pre-approved and pre-permitted for a chip plant. Years before that the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute's RPI Tech Park had been visited by semiconductor companies, but they had chosen not to build. The renewed interest by the region in luring them was spurred by the research centers and training of specialists for the industry by area colleges such as the University at Albany, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and Hudson Valley Community College. Responding to the state's request for potential sites, Rensselaer County proposed the same RPI Tech Park site; Schenectady County proposed two sites, one of which was in Hillside Industrial Park in Niskayuna; Saratoga County proposed two sites; and Albany County proposed three sites, two in Bethlehem and one in Guilderland. The state ultimately decided on 13 sites it would aggressively promote, most of which were in Tech Valley. As one of the thirteen sites chosen, the RPI Tech Park site originally met little opposition from the town of North Greenbush in which it sat. As time progressed opposition grew in response to concerns about potential impacts on traffic and the environment. The RPI Tech Park site, which by October 1999 had become one of only nine sites still being marketed by the state, ended when the North Greenbush town council voted to terminate the review process. A site in Wallkill, Orange County was the first site in Tech Valley and in the entire state to receive pre-approval for a chip fab. In 2002, the Saratoga Economic Development Corporation (SEDC) began to tout its proposed tech park, to be named the Luther Forest Technology Campus, as a site for a chip plant. It would be there that GlobalFoundries, a spin-off of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), decided to build a $4.2 billion chip fab, ground breaking was in July 2009. The State of New York gave nearly $1.4 billion in cash and tax incentives, the largest such package in state history. New York's incentive package was the same as that offered by Russia, China, and Brazil; though it was not the deciding factor it meant that any region not offering the package was out of contention for the fab. The deciding factor on picking Tech Valley was the $5 billion College of Nanoscale Science and Engineering at the SUNY Polytechnic Institute and the resulting \\"high-tech ecosystem\\" put in place during Governor George Pataki's administration. Tech Valley Chamber Coalition The Tech Valley Chamber Coalition is an organization that is made up of 24 local chambers of commerce from 19 counties of Tech Valley. Those 24 chambers represent over 21,000 businesses, schools, and organizations that employ more than 531,000 workers. It was formed in June 2002 and manages the Tech Valley Portal, and publishes an annual publication called Images of Tech Valley.

She was considered by one source to be one of the most important leaders in library science in the 20th century.Kniffle, Leonard; Sullivan, Peggy; McCormick, Edith:(1999). 100 of the most important leaders we had in the 20th century. American Libraries, Page 38 Biography Mary Virginia Gaver was the oldest of three children born to Clayton Daniel Gaver and Ruth Lydia Clendenning Gaver. She was born on December 10, 1906 in Washington D.C.Pioneers and Leaders in Library Services to Youth: A Biographical Dictionary. (2009). Westport: Libraries Unlimited, Inc. Her siblings were brother, Perry, who died of an injury while attending Virginia Tech, and Lydia, a history teacher at Stratford College. Mary's father relocated the family to the mill town of Danville, Virginia located in Pittsylvania County. Her father's family had owned and operated Gaver Woolen Mill in Hillsboro, Virginia in the 1800s. She arrived in Danville in 1912 and lived there for much of her life. It was her life in the impoverished area that influenced her and shaped much of what she did later in her career as an educator, author and a librarian. Gaver's interest in books was displayed when she was very young. Since her mother was a teacher, she had grown up in a family where books were an important component to education and enrichment. While still a young child, she discovered that many of the local school children in Schoolfield Virginia, which is a suburb of Danville, did not have access to books. To help alleviate this situation, she convinced her mother to help collect money to start a school library in this nearby town. Mary Gaver and her mother solicited donations door-to-door and gathered $100 that was then graciously matched by executives at Dan River Mill, where her father was executive secretary to the president, for a total of $200.Obituary (1992). [obituary]. Wilson Library Bulletin, 66(February). This was enough to get a good start on a school library for the area children. Education Gaver attended the local public schools until she enrolled in fifth grade at the Randolph-Macon Institute, which was a private girls school.Dictionary of American Library Biography, Second Supplement (2003). (3rd Edition). Westport: Libraries Unlimited, Inc. After graduation, her mother wanted her to attend the prestigious Trinity College which is currently known as Duke University. Although she had earned a scholarship to cover the cost of her education at Trinity, she chose to further her education at Randolph-Macon Women's College.Pioneers and Leaders in Library Services to Youth: A Biographical Dictionary. (2009). Westport: Libraries Unlimited, Inc. At the age of 21, she received a B.A. with a major in English and two minors that included Bible and the organ. Gaver's education continued while she was employed full-time and often took classes during the summers. She earned a B.S. in library sciences in 1932 from Columbia University and went on to earn an M.S. in library sciences, also at Columbia in 1938.Florence, B., & Jarvis, E. (2002). Celebrating the Contributions of Women in Youth Library Services Retrieved September 20, 2009, from . Miss Gaver did take additional classes later in her career and was awarded an honorary doctoral degree by Columbia. Career She followed in her mother's footsteps and became an English teacher at a local high school. She quickly found out that it was not the job for her. While having an extensive background in English, she encountered problems with the management of her classroom. Her principal recommended that she transfer to a position in the school's library the following school year.Pioneers and Leaders in Library Services to Youth: A Biographical Dictionary. (2009).

That summer she not only worked in a library, but she also got some training at George Washington University to help improve on the fact that she had no formal schooling in library sciences. This unplanned job transfer, led to a long career as a librarian and advocate for the development of school libraries. She worked at George Washington High School for 10 years before she earned her degree in library science. While working as a librarian during The Depression, she became aware of the funding problems of the library systems. Due to this, Gaver decided to dedicate her life not only to improving funding for the library systems but to get training in the schools to help improve the skills of the staff as well as the library skills of the children. Gaver taught at many different schools and colleges, including 12 years (1942‚Äì1954) at the New Jersey State Teachers College. In addition, she was an associate professor, then a professor, at Rutgers University for the Graduate School of Library Services for which she held that position for 17 years from 1954‚Äì1971. In 1970, while at Rutgers University, Gaver served as a committee member of the Rutgers University Council on Children's Literature.About RUCCL and One-on-One Plus (2009).

A. (1995). The Pioneers: A Few Good Men and Women, World Libraries (Vol. 6). During her time at Rutgers, she worked on several projects to help improve the library system. She was passionate about her work and wanted others to realize the importance of a well trained library staff and the benefit it had on the students' educational outcomes. Her work included, but is not limited to, the following projects: Every Child Needs a School Library, 1957; Effectiveness of Centralized School Library Services (Phase I), 1959‚Äì1960; Standards for School Library Programs, 1960; Are You Ready?, 1960; Creative Elementary School Library, 1962; Effectiveness of Centralize Library Service in Elementary Schools, 1963; and Libraries for the People of New Jersey, 1964. Miss Gaver also held many prominent positions including serving as president for not only the New Jersey Library Association (1954‚Äì1955) but for both the American Association of School Librarians (1959‚Äì1960) and the American Library Association (1966‚Äì1967). In addition to her leadership roles in various organizations, she earned several awards throughout her lifetime.

The company has docks in Mackinaw City and St. Ignace. Shepler's provides ferry and freight service to Mackinac Island. History Entrance to the new ferry dock at Mackinaw City (June 2019) In 1945, Captain William H. Shepler, a native of Mackinac returned to Michigan after service in World War II. He already had a full captain's license and began to captain the massive (600-person capacity) Algoma, between Mackinaw City and Mackinac Island. He also operated a small snack bar for passengers waiting for the ferry. Capt. Shepler decided to offer a more distinctive service with smaller craft to and from Mackinac Island. In the winter of 1950, he built his own Bay Craft kit boat in Cheboygan, a cabin cruiser with twin gas engines with a capacity of 24 passengers. The vessel was christened the Miss Margy after Shepler's wife, Margaret. The Mackinac Bridge was completed in November 1957. During its construction, crowds came to watch the progress, increasing the need for tour boats. During the winter of 1953, he built a second kit boat, a high-speed cruiser, the Billy Dick, named after the captain's son William Richard. The fleet expanded over the years. Following the decline in ferry traffic across the straits, Shepler purchased beach frontage on Mackinac Island, and constructed a dock to provide service between the island and the mainland. In May 1988, Capt. William H. Shepler died and his wife Margaret passed away in October 2004. His son, William R., took over the operation with the help of his three children. At that time there were two competitors: Star Line and Arnold's; the latter ceased operations in late 2016. As of 2019, \\"Bill\\" remained the CEO of Shepler‚Äôs and Chris Shepler was President of the company. In 2015, the company added a new 85-foot long vessel with a triple engine and 281-person capacity; the new Miss Margy was built in Onaway in Northern Michigan. The vessel has a top speed of about 40 mph. A news report at the time stated that \\"Sheplers employs 210 with 50 full time and transports 350,000 visitors to Mackinac Island each year\\". By 2015, the company was running two ferries from St. Ignace, and two from Mackinaw City and had a total of six boats. The newly expanded dock at Mackinaw City was unveiled in April 2019 at the start of the season. In addition to the ferry service in 2019, the company was offering Lighthouse Cruises through the Straits of Mackinac and on Lake Michigan as well as other sightseeing options. An announcement in June 2019 stated that Shepler's had ordered a $4 million, 210-passenger ferry with four jet drives; this vessel was expected to begin operation the following summer. Fleet The Shepler's fleet consists of seven ships: * The Welcome, , built in 1969, 120-person, twin-engine * Felicity, , built in 1972, 150-person, twin-engine * The Hope, , built in 1975, 150-person, twin-engine * Wyandot, , built in 1979, 265 person, twin- engine * Capt. Shepler, , built in 1986, 265-person, twin-engine * Sacre Bleu, , built in 1940s (originally the Botany Bay and Put-in-Bay), 25 -person cabin, 300-person deck, twin engine, steel-hulled boat purchased in 1996, updated in the winter of 2013 freight, passenger and ice breaking capabilities. beam, 99-ton displacement * Miss Margy, , built in 2015, 281-person, triple-engine The vessels currently in use by Shepler‚Äôs, with the exception of the Capt. Shepler, Sacre Bleu, and Miss Margy, were named after vessels that sailed the Straits area in the late 17th century.

According to the Handbook of Texas, the community had a population of 150 in 2000. It is located within the Greater Austin metropolitan area. History Texas Historic Commission Placard St. John Colony started with a group of Black farming families who came to the community from Webberville and purchased land here in the early 1870s. Since their leader was the Reverend John Henry Winn, the town was first called Winn's Colony. After the building of the St. John Regular Missionary Baptist Church was established, the community was renamed. The community's boundaries were somewhat hazy but included an area of up to 2,200 acres of land. 40 families lived in the community in the 1980s and had three churches. In 2000, the population of the community was estimated as 150. Geography St. John Colony stands on Farm to Market Road 672 ten miles northeast of Lockhart in northeastern Caldwell County. Education St. John Colony had a school district with the same name in the 1870s. It was the community's main school district until the community became a part of the Lockhart Independent School District in the 1960s.

He finished racing with a record of 6-3-6 in 17 starts and career earnings of $1,216,760. Eddington was best known for his wins in the Grade I Pimlico Special and the Grade II Gulfstream Park Handicap as well as his in-the-money showing in the Grade I Preakness Stakes.Pedigree Online, Thoroughbred Database;. As a yearling, he was sent to Ocala, Florida, to the master horsemen Art Fisher.  Two-year-old season  Eddington was a late-developing colt and only raced once as two-year-old. He placed second in his first time out.  Three-year-old season  At age three, Eddington won his maiden race and an allowance, both at Gulfstream Park. He started the year by winning the Grade III Calder Derby at nine furlongs on the turf at Calder Race Course on New Year's Day. He also finished in the money in five graded stakes races later that year. On the road to the Triple Crown, Eddington placed third in New York City's two biggest prep races at Aqueduct Racetrack. He finished third to Saratoga County in the $250,000 Grade III Gotham Stakes. Then he was third in the $750,000 Grade I Wood Memorial Stakes to Tapit. Trainer Mark Hennig then entered Eddington in the $1,000,000 Grade I Preakness Stakes at Pimlico Race Course. As the field of eleven stakes winners went into the club house turn, Derby runner-up Lion Heart led while eventual Horse of the Year Smarty Jones sat off his flank as Eddington fell back to a stalker's position in sixth. Going into the far turn, Lion Heart sprinted out to a three- length lead as most of the field bunched up. As the field hit the top of the stretch, Smarty Jones passed Lion Heart and widened his lead with every stride. Eddington was seventh but started closing on the leaders except Smarty Jones, who broke a 130-year-old record for largest winning margin in the Preakness . Rock Hard Ten finished second and Eddington finished third, earning $100,000. Later that summer, Eddington closed late again to place third in the Grade I Travers Stakes at Saratoga Race Course to Belmont winner Birdstone.

PlanB has been manufacturing and selling premium skateboard hard goods and apparel since 1991 . History=1991-1993: Formation, Johnson's \\"super team\\", Questionable The original Plan B Skateboarding team was founded in 1991 by Mike Ternasky who had departed from the H-Street company that he had formerly managed with Tony Magnusson. Ternasky, to the dismay of Magnusson, also managed to convince numerous team riders to assist with the development of the new brand. The company was formed as part of the Dwindle Distribution company, at that time overseen by Steve Rocco and Rodney Mullen, and Mike's intention was to create a \\"super team\\", with riders such as Way, McKay, Mullen, Mike Carroll, Matt Hensley, and Rick Howard. Rocco explained in a 2012 interview that \\"The story of Plan B is a difficult one to tell. Everybody, you know, had a different idea of what Plan B was, or was to become, depending on, you know, Mike's vision that he was giving you at the time.\\" Johnson's intentions have been compared to the \\"Dream Team\\" concept that came to fruition in the American professional basketball league, the NBA. At that time, riders were progressing at such a rapid pace that Mike was able to draw upon a pioneering movement to fulfill his aspirations. For example, Way quit his position on the Powell-Peralta team, a decision for a professional skateboarder at the time due to the reputation of the company, due to the inability of the company to support his rate of development. Way has stated that \\"Brian was one of those guys that he would know, you know, if somebody had that potential before anyone else could ever see it, you know?\\" Ternasky was dissatisfied with the skateboarding industry at the time, an industry primarily composed of older business owners who were no longer directly involved with skateboarding, and proceeded to initiate a \\"rebirth\\" of the industry, providing the team riders in his new company with a level of freedom that had not been witnessed up until the formation of Plan B. Rocco further explained, \\"People just wanted to be a part of it because it was so rad.\\" After forming the foundations of the Plan B company, Ternasky proceeded to exert a potent influence upon the team riders, with Mullen's relationship with Ternasky of particular significance. At the time, the origins and defining core of Mullen's skateboarding, freestyle skateboarding, was losing popularity at a rapid rate and Mullen was forced to seriously consider the viability of his future as a professional skateboarder. Both Stacy Peralta and Rocco had attempted to persuade Mullen to adapt to street-style skateboarding, but he was initially resistant; however, Ternasky expressed to Rocco that he believed that he could facilitate the transition, but Rocco replied, \\"Yeah right! You'll never get him to be able to do that stuff.\\" However, a strong bond developed between the two and photographer, Jacob Rosenberg, explains, \\"So, what happened with Mike and Rodney was that he saw something in Rodney, and he made a couple of comments, and I think he saw like, \\"Holy shit, he could really do this if he committed to it.'\\" Mullen subsequently filmed street-style parts for three videos, Questionable (1992), Second Hand Smoke (1993), and Virtual Reality (premiered June 11, 1993 at La Jolla Museum of Contemporary arts), while Ternasky was at the helm of the company. Mullen also introduced two newly invented tricks in Questionable, the kickflip underflip and the casper slide. Rocco expressed the belief that Ternasky's work with Mullen was \\"just flat-out amazing\\" and \\"changed everything\\". Former team rider Sean Sheffey has described his relationship with Ternasky in the following manner: If there was something that we were having a problem with, you know, sit down and speak with us about these things and \\"Why isn't this going on?\\", or \\"What's the problem here?\\", or \\"You need to get this out of your life\\". It's like a real steady father-figure, boss, big brother, you know, really great man. Professional skateboarder Pat Duffy who, like McKay and Way, was a member of the original team and has continued on as a Plan B rider for the company's second phase has maintained Ternasky's influence throughout his entire career, stating: > I was always, like, nervous, like, what if, what do people think of me? Look > at all these people look at me, I can't, I couldn't deal with it, you know? > You know, he would like take me aside and calm me down, and \\"Listen man, all > you gotta do is just go do what you do. Don't worry about, you know?\\" And it > was just like, you know, I've held onto that for years, you know, for a long > time. At the time of the release of the Questionable video in 1992, the Plan B team consisted of Rodney Mullen, Danny Way, Colin McKay, Rick Howard, Mike Carroll, Matt Hensley, Pat Duffy, Ryan Fabry, Sean Sheffey, and Sal Barbier. Upon the release of Virtual Reality in the following year, Tony Ferguson and Aaron Artis were added to the team. Second Hand Smoke, the final video of the Ternasky era, saw the addition of Jeremy Wray, Pat Channita, and Ronnie Bertino to the team, following the departure of Howard, Carroll, Sheffey, and Hensley. 1994-1997: Ternasky's death, Revolution In 1994 Ternasky was killed in a car accident, leaving the ownership of the company mainly in the hands of Johnson with some of the ownership going to Way, McKay, and Michael Ternasky's wife. The group decided to temporarily shelve both the company and the team in 1998 following a period of gradual dissolution. McKay has explained, \\"That was just the end of that Plan B right there. Everything that happened after that, until it was, like, laid to rest for just a minute, was, to me, just doesn't really count. It just wasn't the same, trying to run Plan B, skate at the same time, and, be that young. It was just, you know, it was a tough thing.\\" Ternasky's death was an incredibly significant event for both the skateboarding community and those people who were intensively involved with the Plan B brand; Danny Way stated in a December 2012 interview, \\"Mike was always like a brother to me. He definitely installed in me a lot of stuff that will be permanently in my mind. When I'm really pushing myself sometimes, I have to remember sometimes, like, you know, I really will bring him up in my head and remember certain things he used to say to me and, and, that's, you know, sometimes how I get shit done.\\" Mullen has also spoken publicly about his relationship with Ternasky and explained in a 2002 interview, \\"He was such a great person. He would lift you so high and that is why Plan B was what it was. And it was clear once Mike was gone that it was never the same.\\" A fourth Plan B video was produced in 1997, entitled The Revolution, featuring Johnson, Way, McKay, and Mullen, but this was the final video project associated with the first phase of the company. The team roster for the Revolution video was: Rodney Mullen, Brian Johnson, Danny Way, Colin McKay, Rick McCrank, Brian Emmers, Matt Hensley, Pat Channita, Pat Duffy, and Jeremy Wray. 2005-2010: Relaunch, Billabong deal Around the year 2005, rumors had emerged regarding the resurrection and relaunch of Plan B by both Way and McKay. Second-phase team member Paul Rodriguez has referred to this period as a time when Way and McKay were talking about \\"bringing back the dream; awakening the giant.\\" Fellow recruit, and professional skateboarder for Plan B, PJ Ladd, has stated, \\"I had heard about it. That there was like a rumor that Plan B was maybe gonna come back and I think it had gotten around how much a fan of it I was as a kid.\\" In 2005, with the financial backing of Syndrome Distribution, Way and McKay reformed Plan B Skateboards, maintaining their roles as company co- owners, as well as professional skaters. Way has explained, \\"For the sake of what we were a part of, I think Colin and I, you know, didn't want to let go of the formula that gave us the motivation that pumped out all of those videos and stuff that we were able to pump out.\\" Way has revealed that, while he and McKay are the co-owners of the relaunched company, they have adopted the business model that they learnt of from Ternasky during his time running the first phase of the company. Following the re-recruiting of original team rider Duffy, Rodriguez, Ladd, and Ryan Gallant were the recruited riders from the contemporary skateboarding generation. Rodriguez has explained: \\"The way I looked at it, Danny Way himself called me and asked me to ride for this company that he spent his career and put his hobby on the line for ... He's putting trust in me to continue that legacy. That's huge. That's an honor. I don't even know what I could compare that to. That's the highest compliment someone could receive. For me, it just felt right.\\" Ryan Sheckler, who has referred to Way as a \\"legend in every aspect of skateboarding, and one of the main dudes I look up to in my life.\\", was then recruited, followed by Brian Wenning. The initial amateur rider who was recruited was Ronson Lambert; following Lambert's departure, Felipe Gustavo, a then-unknown skateboarder from Brazil, and Scott Decenzo were recruited in 2010. In November 2012, in response to a question asking whether he has been surprised by the relaunch, Rocco replied: \\"Am I surprised that Plan B got resurrected? No, not at all. I mean, the potential, it's, you, know, it's always been there; it's just, you know, how do you harness it, and focus it, and then move it forward. And hopefully they can, you know, carry on, like, Mike's legacy for him.\\" Torey Pudwill, at that time, was with Almost Skateboards, the company that he had achieved professional status with. He was recruited to the professional ranks of the re-launched company in 2010, following the departure of professional riders Wenning and Gallant. As of December 2012, Wenning co-owns and rides for Lockdown Skateboards and Gallant is a professional rider for Expedition Skateboards. On March 5, 2010, Billabong International Limited confirmed an exclusive ten-year licensing agreement with Plan B. Paul Naude who at the time was President of Billabong North America, stated, \\"Plan B is an authentic, progressive brand and this arrangement will allow its management to focus on its core capabilities while leveraging the global infrastructure of the Billabong group\\". At the core of the deal was the unification of the Element and Plan B brands under the Branch Distribution company, but after an initial website launch, the company did not develop further in the public realm and a website did not exist at the beginning of 2014. In late March 2010, the brand also announced a partnership with the Paul Schmitt Stix Factory for the manufacturing of its skateboard decks. 2010 onward: New ownership, Rodriguez's departure, Branch distribution, True In March 2012, Brian Johnson gave part of the Plan B Skateboard company to his son, Morgan Johnson. After about a year of success, Morgan brought his friends, Ramy and Mark Farah into the company and in recent years, the company has developed new headquarters in Landover, Maryland. In early 2013, a bidding process for Billabong continued following the company's collapse in the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis and a failed expansion into the retail industry. As of April 10, 2013, a AUD287 million offer from a consortium was under consideration by the owners of Billabong, but the proposal remained conditional. The inaugural Plan B full-length video has been a topic of discussion among the global skateboarding community for a prolonged duration of time, as promotional footage has been released (entitled Superfuture) and the company has been in existence for a significant period of time, with a renowned team established during this time period. A late-November episode of the internet-based, weekly program, Skateline, broadcast on the Thrasher Magazinechannel, showed footage of company co-owner and team rider, Danny Way, stating that the video would be made according to a schedule determined by the company regardless of external pressure. Way is filmed speaking directly to the camera, in response to Gary Rogers, the host of the program: \\"Gary, you need to chill out man. Gary, you need to chill the fuck out. We're gonna drop this video when we say we're gonna drop it.\\" Veteran professional skateboarder, Chris Miller, has stated: \\"They're filming a video part every time they go out on the weekend to a contest. Now you gotta go out and do it in the street. Now you gotta go out and do it on a level that, like, way above and beyond that. So it's gotta be tough; it's gotta be, it's gotta be really hard. But I think that this is the crew to do it.\\" In regard to the Plan B team (as of December 2012) and the filming of the video, McKay has stated: \\"They're just so self-motivated man. Like, if we're together, great, we'll all do our thing and go somewhere and film; and like, if they're on their own, everyone has their own program that they're on. You just know that everyone's handling business wherever they are.\\" Way explained in December 2012: > With the history, or the legacy, of our prior videos, and being > Questionable, our first video, we haven't had a full-length video with our > team and I think our team is a team that would mirror the team we had > originally when we launched Plan B, but in a modern-day way. I might be > crazy, but I think we do have the formula to make a video that should be > historical like the original Plan B video was. On January 4, 2013, a teaser video was released, featuring Pudwill performing an upward tailslide-to-kick flip-out on a ledge, stating that the Plan B video is due for release in summer of 2013. The video is the first in a series of teasers that will be released during the period leading up to the video release date. In late February 2014, Sheckler posted a picture on Instagram of the whole team standing together captioned: \\"Vid coming out Nov 2014\\". Director of the video, Erik Bragg, participated in an interview with Red Bull on July 18, 2014 and confirmed the completion of the video: \\"We‚Äôre almost done, I promise.

Belongs to Consejo Nacional para la Cultura y las Artes. The complex was built by the Jesuits starting in the 1580s. Here, were founded three centers of learning: a school to teach indigenous languages to Jesuit evangelists, a school for Indian boys and the College of San Francisco Javier, to train Jesuit priests. The complex comprises three sections: the College area, with dormitories, library, kitchen, domestic chapel etc.; the Church of San Francisco Javier; and the Church of San Pedro Apostol. The former college and the Church of San Francisco Javier have been converted into the Museo del Virreinato, with the former college area housing a large collection of art and ordinary objects from the colonial era, and the Church of San Francisco Javier housing one of the most important collections of Churrigueresque altarpieces in Mexico. The Church of San Pedro Apostol is the only part of the entire complex that is still used for religious purposes. The College of San Francisco Javier The Jesuits arrived in Mexico in 1572, too late for the evangelization of most of the populace of central Mexico, most of which had already been done by other orders such as the Franciscans, Dominicans, and Augustinians by the 1580s. However, the Jesuits did find a need in education. The Jesuits arrived to Tepotzotl√°n in the 1580s and took up residence in local structures. A local Indian leader, Mart√≠n Maldonado, became impressed with the Jesuits, who had already started a school to teach indigenous languages to priests. Maldonado made a large donation to the Jesuits in order begin a school for Indian boys. This school was named San Mart√≠n and the boys were taught religion, reading and writing in Spanish and music. In the mid 1580s the training of Jesuit priests was moved from the San Pedro y San Pablo College in Mexico City to a new facility called the College of San Francisco Javier. These schools would make Tepotzotl√°n one of the most prestigious educational centers in New Spain. The school complex continued to grow during the 17th century, and the adjoining Church of San Francisco Javier was begun in 1670. The school continued to increase in prestige and size until 1767, when the Jesuits were expelled from all Spanish-held territory, and the Spanish Crown took possession of all Jesuit-held properties. The college was abandoned for eight years until Archbishop Alonso Nu√±ez de Haro y Peralta put it under the care of ordinary priests and renamed it the Real Colegio de Instrucci√≥n Retiro Voluntario y Correcci√≥n del Clero Secular. This institution not only trained new priests, it served as a retirement community for elderly or disabled priests. It also served as a place to send priests who had \\"committed some kind of error.\\" The Jesuits returned to former Spanish territories in the mid 19th century but there were not enough of them to take over the institution in Mexico even though it was offered. In 1859, the Reform Laws declared the complex as property of the nation although the Church of San Francisco Javier still kept offering Mass. Because of the poor conditions at penitentiaries at this time, it was decided to use former monasteries and convents for this purpose. However, in spite of the fact that the complex was turned over to the State of Mexico in 1871, the local populace would not permit it to be used as a jail. Later, such would be considered again by Porfirio D√≠az, but it never came to pass. During the Mexican Revolution, the school was still functioning with Father Gonzalo Carrasco as the dean. General Coss ordered the expulsion of the priest and his company as it was rumored that they were trying to reform a monastic order. Knowing that Carrasco was a painter, Coss ordered him to paint a portrait of Venustiano Carranza and renounce his collar. Carrasco refused and was sent to the prison in Teoloyucan, and the students were sent to Mexico City. Soldiers then occupied the complex, sacking it. The college was abandoned by the Jesuits for good in 1914 and the church was opened to the public. Rumors persisted that great treasures were buried on the complex grounds, forcing the complex to allow searches in 1928, 1931, 1932 and 1934, which caused damage to the main church. The complex was declared a national monument in 1933. The complex is one of the few in Mexico that has been preserved completely intact, including its altarpieces and artworks. In 1961, restoration work was begun on the church and college complex by then president Adolfo L√≥pez Mateos and in 1964 it was inaugurated. Most of the museum's collection came from the old Museum of Religious Art which was part of the Mexico City Cathedral. The precious metal objects were donated by the National Museum of History and a pre-Hispanic blanket was donated by the Museo Nacional de Antropolog√≠a. Other objects in the collection were donated by private parties. The museum Main altar of the college's domestic chapel Most of the complex is taken up by the Museo del Virreinato situated in what used to be the College of San Francisco Javier. The Museo is considered to be one of the most impressive in the country due both to its collection and to the aesthetics of the building that houses it. Remodeling of the college began in 1961 and finished three years later under the direction of then-president Adolfo L√≥pez Mateos. It was inaugurated with much the same look and permanent collection that it has today. The complex contains a number of interior courtyards, such as the Aljibes and the Naranjo, as well as a domestic chapel, library, dormitories, refectory, and kitchen. A wide arched passageway in the back of the complex leads to the extensive gardens area of more than 3 hectares, filled with gardens, sculptures and the original Salta de Agua fountain, which marked the end of the old Chapultepec aqueduct. Much of its collection is made of liturgical pieces from the old Museum of Religious Art which was part of the Mexico City Cathedral. These are distributed among the many rooms of the college complex. There are pieces done in ivory, wood and a paste made from corn stalks among other materials. Religious vestments that were in the Religious Art museum include chasubles, dalmatic stoles, capes and bags for corporals and maniples. Work in precious metals, especially silver, include a wide variety of monstrance and tabernacles, chalices, reliquaries, naviculas, crosses, censers, candlesticks, and ciboria. It now houses important artworks and other objects relating to the colonial period of Mexico. It contains twenty paintings by Crist√≥bal de Villalpando, as well as creations by Juan Correa, Mart√≠n de Vos, Miguel Cabrera, the Rodr√≠guez Ju√°rez brothers and Jos√© de Ibarra. The collection is one of the largest from the Mexican colonial era. These paintings exhibit a variety of techniques and are almost all of religious themes. Sculptures include works done in \\"estofado\\" and \\"encarnado,\\" two techniques that were popular at the time. There are also realistic pieces with hair, glass eyes and real teeth. There are exhibits of non-religious everyday items from the colonial period such as silverware and other objects of precious metals, textiles and tools. Among the ceramics on display are pieces created in the Majolica and Talavera styles, in addition to Asian pieces brought via the Manila galleon. The museum's collection of furniture traces the evolution of styles during this period and includes tables, chairs, stools, lecterns, and desks with metal and mother-of-pearl inlay. Numerous tools, arms and other horsemanship items are found here such as irons, harnesses, swords, guns, locks, stirrups, spurs, trunks, chests, helmets, and complete suits-of-armor. There is a collection of lacquered and inlaid objects from Michoac√°n and Chiapas which date from the 17th century. The museum has fine example of rare feather art, as well as interesting glass objects, mostly from Spain, France, England and Germany. The book collection of about 4,000 volumes is concentrated in the old college library. The volumes date from the 16th to the 19th centuries, written in various languages with different types of binding. Museum services include guided tours, a library specializing in colonial history and a book store. The Hoster√≠a del Convento is a lodging and restaurant facility located within the complex. Every year, this hostel sponsors \\"posadas,\\" which are a type of pre-Christmas pageant, as well as nativity plays. This tradition was revived in 1963 and fills the air with songs and fireworks. These events are accompanied by pi√±atas and \\"ponche\\" a hot, spiced fruit drink. Church of San Francisco Javier Main altar of the Church of San Francisco Javier, part of the Museum complex The Church of San Francisco Javier was begun in 1670 and finished in 1682. Design of the building is attributed to Jos√© Duran. The layout of the church is of typical Latin cross design with a cupola with a pendentive. The groin vaults of the church preserve decorative motifs. In the pendentive is a mural from the 17th century which is identified as Saint Aloysius Gonzaga with tiger lilies as a symbol of purity, Saint Stanislaus Kostka with the infant Jesus in his arms, Francis of Borgia with a skull, and Ignatius of Loyola with the Jesuit standard. In the 18th century, these paintings were covered by oils of the Four Evangelists. They were moved to the ante-choir in the 1960s. The facade of the church of San Francisco Javier was constructed between 1760 and 1762 of grey stone and covered the original facade from the 17th century. This facade is attributed to architect Ildefonso Iniesta Bejarano. The facade summarizes the themes that are presented in the altarpieces inside. The most prominent image is of the Virgin Mary as the Great Patroness of the Jesuits. At the crest is an image of the Archangel Michael. The ornamentation of its facade continues up through the bell tower which dates from the 18th century and the use of the \\"estipite\\" (inverted truncated pyramid) column here is very evident as the decoration of the facade continues up the tower. The tower is topped by an iron cross. This facade is considered to be the most important of the Churriguerisque style in Mexico. The large atrium in front of the museum complex is called the Plaza de la Cruz, which contains an atrium cross made of stone and carved with scenes from the Passion of Christ. The Church of San Francisco Javier is no longer used for religious services and is now part of the museum. This church contains one of the most important collections of Churrigueresque altarpieces in Mexico. These feature the Baroque estipite column and were done in the 18th century by Higinio Chavez. All were done in white cedar and covered in gold leaf. In the main altarpiece is a painting of God, the Father at the crown done by Miguel Cabrera, Underneath is an image of the Immaculate Conception with Saint Joachim and Saint Anne on the sides. Underneath this is an image of John the Baptist with Saint Joseph next to him. The altar also includes images of two martyrs who died in Japan. In the center of the altarpiece is the image of Company of Jesus co-founder Saint Francis Xavier with a flaming heart shown on his chest, symbolizing divine love. The main altar and the side altars are related thematically. Those on the presbytery side are dedicated to two of the most important Jesuit saints (Saints Ignatius of Loyola and Saint Joseph) and the altars on the other side are dedicated to those of the Third Order of the Company of Jesus, such as Francis of Borgia, shown with a crowned skull, Aloysius Gonzaga and Stanislav of Kotska. One other altarpiece is dedicated to the Virgin of Guadalupe and was completed in 1756. This altar contains an image of this Virgin as she appeared to Juan Diego as well as other saints associated with harvests, such as Saint Barbara. In the second section of the nave is the Chapel of the Virgin of Loreto, which has a portal that is a replica of the house of Loreto. In the back of the temple is the Alcove of the Virgin and the Chapel of the Relic of Saint Joseph. The House of Loreto is, by tradition, considered to be the home of the Virgin Mary, and behind it there is an alcove dedicated to the Virgin of Loreto. Near here is a very small room dedicated to a relic supposedly of Saint Joseph. Next to this is the presbytery and the sacristy, which is filled with oil paintings. The Church of San Francisco Javier, the Loreto Chapel and the Alcove of the Virgin of Loreto are considered to be works of art in themselves. Church of San Pedro Apostol To the left of the Church of San Francisco Javier is the Church of San Pedro Apostol with its main entrance facing the atrium and done in Neoclassic style. It is the only part of the museum complex that still preserves its religious function and services.

Life Perrone Compagni joined the Italian Army at an early age and was a career soldier. However after reaching the rank of lieutenant he was demoted to private during the First World War for incompetence.Philip Rees, Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right Since 1890, 1990, p. 294 His first political activity was in the Association Italia e Vittorio Emanuele, a minor liberal group before in November 1920 he switched to the fascists, becoming political secretary in Florence. Given his noble background Perrone Compagni came to represent the conservative wing of fascism that looked out for the interests of landowners and magnates in opposition to the more proletarian wing that followed the rough and ready leadership of the likes of Tullio Tamburini. Perrone Compagni became an important figure as Italy stood on the brink of takeover by Benito Mussolini when he was appointed one of the four commandants-general of the fascist squads. His importance was emphasised in the March on Rome when he commanded the Tuscan contingent of the fascist squadrons. Under Mussolini's government Perrone Compagni enjoyed wide power, particularly in Tuscany where he was effective head of the fascist machine. Such was his power in the region that he was given the nickname of 'Grand Duke' in Tuscany.Frank Snowden, The Fascist Revolution in Tuscany, 1919-22, 2004, p. 160 His high profile made him a target for anti-fascists however and he was wounded in an ambush in Perugia not long after the takeover. He would go on to serve as prefetto of Reggio Emilia from December 1926 to January 1930 before being appointed a Minister of State in 1932.

He was the first Bishop of Austin, Texas (1948-1971). Biography Louis Reicher was born in Piqua, Ohio, to Jacob and Marie (n√©e Krebsbach) Reicher. He attended St. James's College in Ontario, Canada, from 1905 to 1911. After returning to Ohio, he studied at Mount St. Mary's Seminary in Cincinnati for a year before going into work for U.S. Steel. In 1916, he was accepted as a seminarian in the Diocese of Galveston, Texas, and entered St. Mary's Seminary in La Porte. He was ordained to the priesthood by Bishop Christopher Edward Byrne on December 6, 1918. Reicher then served as chancellor of the Diocese of Galveston from 1918 to 1947. During this period, he also served as chaplain to Dominican Sisters in Galveston, vicar for religious, member of the Administrative Council, and founding pastor of St. Christopher's Church in Houston from 1923 to 1941. He was raised to the rank of Domestic Prelate in March 1935 and a Protonotary Apostolic in July 1940. Using an initial capital of $3,000 saved from his career as a steelworker, he made several wise investments and eventually became a millionaire. He used his personal assets to place the diocese on sound financial ground, and maintained those conditions throughout the Great Depression. On November 29, 1947, Reicher was appointed the first Bishop of the Diocese of Austin by Pope Pius XII. He received his episcopal consecration on April 14, 1948 from Bishop Christopher Byrne, with Bishops Joseph H. Albers and Mariano Simon Garriga serving as co-consecrators. On the following May 13, he was installed by Archbishop Robert Emmet Lucey at St. Mary's Church in Austin; in attendance were former Governor Dan Moody, Governor Beauford H. Jester, and Mayor Robert Thomas Miller. During his tenure, he built or restored over 200 churches and facilities, including a chancery office, Holy Cross Hospital, Newman Centres on five college campuses, and six church- sponsored, low-rent housing projects. Between 1962 and 1965, he attended the Second Vatican Council, where he contributed to the conciliar document on religious freedom, Dignitatis Humanae. He was a strong opponent of communism and supporter of the Civil Rights Movement. After twenty-three years of service, Reicher resigned as bishop on November 15, 1971. He retired to his ranch on Lake Austin, where he later died at age 93.

The town is the seat of Niobrara County. The town was founded in July 1886, by Frank S. Lusk, a renowned Wyoming rancher, partner in the Western Live Stock Company, and stockholder in the Wyoming Central Railway. Cattle ranching remains the primary industry in the town of Lusk. The population was 1,567 at the 2010 census. The town of Lusk is known for being the county seat of the least populated county in the least populated state in the US. History The Black Hills Gold Rush brought fortune seekers to the Wyoming Territory. Within two years, the stage coach route between Cheyenne, Wyoming and Deadwood, South Dakota delivered freight, including salt pork and whiskey. The boom also brought armored stage coaches and gold bricks, along with Indians and thieves.Benedict, Jeff. No Bone Unturned: The Adventures of a Top Smithsonian Forensic Scientist and the Legal Battle for America's Oldest Skeletons, HarperCollins Publishers, page 1, 2003. The Cheyenne‚ÄìDeadwood route operated from 1876 to 1887, when it was replaced by the Wyoming Central Railway. Frank S. Lusk Frank S. Lusk (1857‚Äì1930) was a renowned Wyoming rancher and stockholder in the Wyoming Central Railway. Initially residing in Cleveland, Ohio, he moved to Denver, Colorado in 1876 and built the Western Live Stock Company under a partnership agreement and established a ranch east of Greeley. In 1877, Lusk traveled to the Wyoming Territory for the first time on personal business and left highly impressed with the people and the area. In 1879, eastern Colorado had grown to the point that Lusk, along with his partners began exploring options outside of the area. His thoughts were recorded in the 1923 Annals of Wyoming: Quarterly Bulletin: > My partners were favorable to moving into eastern Colorado near the Nebraska > state line but I remembered the people I had met earlier in Wyoming and > those I had subsequently met were a fine class of people and I decided we > would go to Wyoming. > > ‚ÄîFrank S. Lusk Lusk and the Western Live Stock Company arrived in the Wyoming Territory in 1880 via Denver, establishing the Node Ranch, about east of present-day Lusk. A year later, he bought some land about outside of Lusk, which included the Running Water Stage Station. Buildings on the land included a stone barn and shelters that had been used by the Cheyenne‚ÄìDeadwood stage route. Lusk established a hay ranch on the property. He organized his horse ranch at the site of what would later become the town of Lusk. Lusk Post Office After establishing his three ranch properties, it became clear that the nearest post office was located in Rawhide Buttes, southeast of the hay ranch, actually Route 20. Collecting the mail required a ride of round trip. In response, one of the partners in the Gilmer and Salisbury Express Stage told Lusk that he should set up a post office at the ranch, which would provide for delivery of the mail, rather than requiring him to make the ride to Rawhide Buttes. When Lusk sent in the application to the Post Office Department, everything was complete, but he didn't indicate a name for the post office. When asked about it later, Lusk told the star route representative that he was \\"busy and told him to do whatever he thought would, without a doubt, establish a post office for us. He told me he had suggested that it be called 'Lusk' and in due course of time it was so established\\". Wyoming Central Railway Lusk Water Tower, built in 1886 to provide water for steam locomotives In 1886, the Fremont, Elkhorn and Missouri Valley Railroad wanted to extend their line west from Nebraska toward Casper, Wyoming, in order to transport coal. The territorial laws at that time required railroad companies to incorporate within the territory, before they were allowed to build or operate lines in the area. In order to meet the requirements allow construction and ownership, the Wyoming Central Railway was established as a dummy corporation. While Frank Lusk had been a successful cattleman, he was named as a director and only resident stockholder of the company. Letters of incorporation listed the base of operations as Lusk, Wyoming. While Lusk was the only post office in Wyoming on the entire (proposed) line and was named as the place of business of the company in its incorporation papers, it wasn't officially established until July of that year, when railroad engineers laid the first plat for the town. That same year, the towns of Douglas, and Casper were officially established in the same manner by Lusk, on behalf of the Wyoming Central Railway. After the turn of the century, there was another mining boom. Silver was discovered in the hills surrounding Lusk, which brought a steady stream of miners to the area. By the 1950s, growth in the area stabilized when cattle ranching usurped mining as the primary industry of the town. In 1952, the Lusk Baptist Church sent letters to Representative William Henry Harrison III and Senators Joseph C. O'Mahoney and Lester C. Hunt protesting the creation of diplomatic relations with Vatican City through the appointment of Mark W. Clark. Geography Lusk is located at (42.760674, -104.452729).

Melbourne was settled on 30 August 1835 by a party of free settlers from Van Diemen's Land. The party was led by John Lancey aboard the schooner Enterprize, and was funded by the businessman John Pascoe Fawkner. The settlement followed a treaty with the indigenous Aboriginal group, the Wurundjeri of the Kulin nation alliance, which was negotiated by John Batman on behalf of the Port Phillip Association. Melbourne differs from Australia's other early colonial cities, in that it was founded by businessmen and free settlers - without the permission of The Crown. However, it was later transferred as a settlement of The Crown on 4 March 1837. Foundations Artist's impression of the signing of Batman's Treaty John Pascoe Fawkner Batman's Treaty In April 1835, John Batman, a prominent grazier and a member of the Geelong and Dutigalla Association (later Port Phillip Association), sailed from Launceston on the island of Van Diemen's Land (now the State of Tasmania), aboard the schooner Rebecca, in search of fresh grazing land in the south-east of the Colony of New South Wales (the mainland Australian continent). He sailed across Bass Strait, into the bay of Port Phillip, and arrived at the mouth of the Yarra River in May. After exploring the surrounding area, he met with the elders of the indigenous Aboriginal group, the Wurundjeri of the Kulin nation alliance, and negotiated a transaction for 600,000 acres (2,400 km2; 940 mi2) - which later became known as Batman's Treaty. The transaction - which is believed to have taken place on the bank of Merri Creek (near the modern day suburb of Northcote), consisted of an offering of: blankets, knives, mirrors, sugar, and other such items; to be also tributed annually to the Wurundjeri. The last sentence of Batman's journal entry on this day became famous as the founding charter of the settlement. Upon returning to Van Diemen's Land, Batman's treaty was deemed invalid by the Governor of New South Wales, Richard Bourke, under the Proclamation of Governor Bourke in August. It was the belief of Governor Bourke, as well as the Governor of Van Diemen's Land, George Arthur, that the Aboriginal people did not have any official claims to the lands of the Australian continent. The proclamation formally declared, under the doctrine of terra nullius, that The Crown owned the whole of the Australian continent and that only it alone could sell and distribute land. It therefore voided any contracts or treaties made without the consent of the government, and declared any person attempting to rely on such a treaty to be trespassing. However, at the time the proclamation was being drawn up, a prominent businessman from Van Diemen's Land, John Pascoe Fawkner, had also funded an expedition to the area; which sailed from George Town aboard the schooner Enterprize. At the same time, the Port Phillip Association had also funded a second expedition; which sailed from Launceston aboard the Rebecca. Fawkner's fait accompli The settlement party aboard the Enterprize entered the Yarra River, and anchored close to the site chosen by Batman, on 29 August. The party went ashore the following day (near what is the modern day William Street; on what is now Melbourne Day) and landed their stores, livestock and began to construct the settlement. The Association party aboard the Rebecca arrived in September after spending time at a temporary camp at Indented Head, where they encountered William Buckley - a believed-dead, escaped convict; who had been living with the indigenous Aboriginal group, the Wathaurong of the Kulin nation alliance, for 32 years. Batman was dismayed to discover the settlers of the Enterprize had established a settlement in the area and informed the settlers that they were trespassing on the Association's land. However, under the Proclamation of Governor Bourke, both the parties were in fact trespassing on Crown land. When Fawkner - noted for his democratic nature - arrived in October, following tense arguments between the two parties, negotiation were made for land to be shared equally. As Fawkner had arrived after the two parties, he was aware of the Proclamation of Governor Bourke - which had gained approval from the Colonial Office in October. He knew that cooperation would be vital if the settlement was to continue to exist fait accompli. Land was then divided, and the settlement existed peacefully, but without a formal system of governance. It was referred to by a number of names, including: \\"Batmania\\" and \\"Bearbrass\\" - of which the latter was agreed upon by Batman and Fawkner. Fawkner assumed a leading role in the establishment of Bearbrass; which, by early 1836, consisted of 177 European settlers (142 male and 35 female settlers). The Secretary of State for the Colonies, Charles Grant, recognised the settlement's fait accompli that same year, and authorised Governor Bourke to transfer Bearbrass to a Crown settlement. Batman and the Port Phillip Association were compensated ¬£7,000 for the land. In March 1837, it was officially renamed Melbourne in honour of the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, William Lamb (the Lord Melbourne). Founders conjecture Since its early settlement there has been some conjecture around who is the rightful founder of Melbourne. Many believe Batman to be the rightful founder - as he negotiated a treaty and lease of land from the Wurundjeri. However, it has been brought into question whether the Wurundjeri properly understood Batman's intentions. Others believe Fawkner to be the rightful founder - as he funded the first settlement party to the area, aboard the Enterprize, and was fundamental in establishing order within the early settlement. However, as both men were not present at the establishment of the settlement itself, some also believe that Fawkner's expedition leader, John Lancey, and the settlers aboard the Enterprize, to be the rightful founders of Melbourne. At the time of the settlement's transfer to Crown ownership, the government acknowledged Batman as its founder and paid him for the land - even though his treaty with the Wurundjeri was deemed invalid. Later, historians acknowledged Fawkner as its founder - as he had the vision for a settlement, whereas Batman's interests were initially commercial. Melbourne Day today To mark the founding of Melbourne, its citizens celebrate with an annual series of week- long activities, and offers from local businesses, leading up to 30 August (Melbourne Day). On the morning of Melbourne Day, the flag of Melbourne is raised by the Lord Mayor of Melbourne at Enterprize Park - a small park on the north bank of the Yarra River (close to William Street, on Flinders Street) where the first settlers aboard the Enterprize went ashore to establish the settlement. A special message from the Mayor of Launceston in Tasmania is couriered across Bass Strait aboard the Spirit of Tasmania, and delivered to the Lord Mayor of Melbourne on the morning of Melbourne Day - acknowledging the historical connection of the two cities. The Committee for Melbourne Day acknowledges Batman, Fawkner and Lancey as all influential in the foundations of Melbourne, which is reflected in the Melbourne Day celebrations. A replica of the Enterprize (launched in 1997) plays an important role in the celebrations, as do the Melbourne Awards - which are held on the eve of the official celebrations. The replica of the schooner Enterprize, launched in 1997 The 'Enterprize' replica The original schooner Enterprize was built in Hobart in 1829 by William Pender. It was used as a cargo vessel till 1835, after which it was purchased by John Pascoe Fawkner to carry a settlement party to the future site of Melbourne. It was captained by Peter Hunter. After the settlement, the ship was then used as a trading vessel till 1847 - when it was wrecked on the shoal of the Richmond River in northern New South Wales. Planning for the construction of a replica began in 1989. Construction of the $2.5 million replica began in 1991, with the keel laid at the Melbourne Maritime Museum. It was completed at the Old Ports and Harbour Yard in Williamstown, and was officially launched by Felicity Kennett - the wife of the Premier of Victoria, Jeff Kennett, on the 160th Melbourne Day in 1997. The replica took six years to build and was constructed using traditional 19th century methods. It was constructed using Australian-grown timber, including: Jarrah, Huon Pine, Kauri, Celery Top Pine and Ironbark - much of it recycled. The ship's two masts are local California Redwood, its sails are traditional hand-sewn flax and its rigging is traditional tarred hemp. The Melbourne Awards Since 2003, the Melbourne Awards are awarded to people and organisations whose vision and hard work has helped shape Melbourne. The awards honour a diverse range of contributions, focusing on the people and organisations who have gone above and beyond the call of duty for the city. The winners are selected through an independent judging process, which in turn gives the nominees access to industry leaders and professionals who then often become ambassadors for the achievements they witness.

Incumbent Governor Frank O'Bannon, a Democrat, was re-elected over Republican David M. McIntosh with 57% of the vote. Libertarian Andrew Horning also ran and received 2% of the vote. O'Bannon's victory was the fourth consecutive election in which a Democrat was elected Governor of Indiana, the longest winning streak for that party in the state since the Civil War. As of , this is the most recent election in which a Democrat was elected Governor of Indiana. Primaries=Republican Congressman David M. McIntosh faced John Price in the May 2 Primary Election. Former gubernatorial candidate George Witwer had previously declined to run and instead endorsed McIntosh. McIntosh's central campaign theme was a 25% cut in property taxes, which drew ire from many of his opponents. McIntosh also called for replacing the ISTEP Plus standardized test and merit-based evaluations of teachers in his \\"Kids First\\" education plan, released on March 3, 2000. Price's campaign was based largely on his \\"Price Plan\\", a 70-page booklet outlining a 27-step program for running the state government. In the Primary election, Price was defeated soundly by McIntosh, who won 71% of the vote. Democratic Incumbent Governor Frank O'Bannon ran unopposed for his party's nomination. He won 272,213 votes statewide and 100% of the vote. Other Candidates Libertarian Andrew Horning entered the gubernatorial race on March 23, pledging to eliminate state property taxes. Horning had run for Mayor of Indianapolis in 1999 and received four percent of the vote. Horning pitched himself as an alternative to the two major parties, both of which he blamed for \\"the embarrassing state of education in Indiana\\". General Election=Campaign Throughout the campaign, McIntosh made his proposed 25% tax cut his signature issue. O'Bannon attacked the plan as potentially harmful to education, which was his top talking point during the fall campaign. O'Bannon unveiled a $310 million education plan on July 19 which drew scorn from both sides because of the inclusion of lottery money in the proposed funding. Despite this, O'Bannon maintained a steady lead over his opponent, with a September 1 poll showing him leading McIntosh by 21 points. This was partially credited to public distrust of McIntosh's tax policies, with polls showing \\"deep skeptisism\\" of the proposed 25% cut, according to the Indianapolis Star. Results O'Bannon won the election with 57% of the vote. McIntosh trailed far behind at 42%, with Horning carrying just 2% of the vote.

On July 2, 1981, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places. The courthouse is the fourth structure to house court functions and county administration. History Bradford was established as the first county seat for Chickasaw County in 1854, and a log structure was built for a courthouse. One of the first functions in the new building was to move the county seat to the more centrally located town of New Hampton, which was finalized in 1857. The following year people in the southern part of the county objected and suggested a place such as Forest City, different from the Forest City in Winnebago County, was a better location. An election was held and once again the decision was made to move the county seat. However, it was discovered that the poll book had bee tampered with and the decision was fought in the courts with New Hampton being the eventual winner. The first courthouse there, a frame structure, was not completed until 1865. A four-room brick addition was built in 1876. The courthouse was destroyed in a fire on March 26, 1880, but the records were saved. The people in New Hampton contributed $5,000 for a new courthouse so as to keep the county seat in the city. The brick and stone structure was completed in 1881 for $10,500. It featured a clock tower that rose above the main facade. Two wings were added to the building in 1905 and 1906 for about $4,200 each. The present courthouse was built from 1929 to 1930. It was designed by the Waterloo, Iowa architectural firm of Ralston & Ralston. Its style is Stripped Classicism that is strongly influenced by the Moderne and the Art Deco styles. with It was constructed of Bedford stone for about $134,000. Its significance is derived from its association with county government, and the political power and prestige of New Hampton as the county seat.

It broke records of popularity in Pakistan. One TV critic in a major English- language newspaper in Pakistan says, \\"This is one of the oldest and greatest dramas in the history of Pakistani television\\".Old but not forgotten: Top 10 Pakistani dramas to re-watch now Dawn (newspaper), Published 13 March 2015, Retrieved 27 July 2018  First production in 1969  Initially, Khuda Ki Basti was produced in November 1969 by Pakistan Television 26 episodes of 25 minutes each, by producer Ishrat Ansari. Some episodes were produced by Rasheed Umar Thanvi at Karachi TV -- that small and historic studio \\"A\\" which still stands galore at the center. There was an advisory committee of Pakistan Television comprising a panel of famous intellectuals: Faiz Ahmed Faiz, Jamiluddin Aali besides Shaukat Siddiqui to ensure the perfection of the adaptation of the novel into drama.  Second production in 1974  In 1974, Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto had directed re-telecast of Khuda Ki Basti as it was Bhutto's favorite serial with mass appeal and message. But the Pakistan Television had some problems as the video tape recordings of the drama on spool in 1969 had long been erased due to new videotape scarcity and the need to re-record some other new programs on those spools. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto insisted that the serial must be re-telecast even if fresh recording is essential. The 1974 version of re-recorded Khuda Ki Basti was 50-minute episodes which lasted 13 weeks and created the same impact that the 1969 version did. It was Khuda Ki Basti and nothing else for the viewers. TV directors Bakhtiyar Ahmed and Qasim Jalali did a fine job. This time around, the entire serial has been well maintained by Pakistan Television with a repeat telecast in 1990 which termed the adaptation of Shaukat Siddiqui‚Äôs novel Khuda Ki Basti as \\"Mother of All Serials\\" at Pakistan Television Corporation.

Nevertheless, they point out, in line with the exploitation genre, Sone delivers some \\"chillingly savage\\" moments. Allmovie agrees that the film is \\"not for the timid\\", but judges that it was one of Nikkatsu's better Roman Pornos of 1972. Dealing with societal alienation, self-destruction and violence, the film works with themes that director Hisayasu Sat≈ç would make his own in the 1980s and 1990s. Director Ch≈´sei Sone worked as an assistant director to Seijun Suzuki during the 1960s. He is probably best known for the first two episodes of the Angel Guts series, which he directed in 1978 and 1979. Lead actress Keiko Tsuzuki had a leading role in Yasuharu Hasebe's Kurosawa satire, Naked Seven (1974).Weisser, p. 285. Availability Lusty Sisters was released theatrically in Japan on November 29, 1972.

The show was syndicated by Group W Productions to Westinghouse-owned television stations in Boston, Baltimore, Pittsburgh, Cleveland, and San Francisco, as well as to other stations in Washington D.C., New York, and Los Angeles. It was scheduled at the same time as NBC's The Tonight Show, then hosted by Jack Paar. Westinghouse, which was only a broadcaster that syndicated its programs through Group W, attempted to compete with NBC, which had had a monopoly on late-night television since Steve Allen had originated The Tonight Show in 1954. PM East/PM West was never accessible in Chicago, Illinois, the American South, the Southwestern United States, the Pacific Northwest or in the states of Florida or Texas. Episode status Audio recordings of some of Barbra Streisand's appearances constitute nearly all that survives. The sole episode known to exist in its entirety (available for viewing at the UCLA Film and Television Archive) is the February 12, 1962, broadcast, which was a tribute to George Schaefer.http://barbra-archives.com/tv/60s/pm_east_streisand.html It features actors who worked with Schaefer, including Boris Karloff (who is interviewed by Davidson), Ed Wynn, and Ethel Griffies. Streisand does not appear, nor does anyone mention her name. In 2018, someone uploaded to YouTube a clip that lasts 4 minutes 46 seconds from an episode in which the guests include comedian Dick Gregory and Victor Lownes, an executive with the company that later became known as Playboy Enterprises.

The representatives of this genus are mostly relatively small, and measure a few millimeters to about one centimeter. They move, as is common for the bugs of the subfamily Emesinae, with their back and middle legs. The raptorial front legs serve to capture prey. With them, the prey is captured, then bitten through with the mandibles and carried away. Then it is drained, which can sometimes take half an hour. Emesopsis prey on a variety of insect groups, ranging from beetles, bugs, flies, to springtails. Habitat and distribution The species of the genus Emesopsis be found both in agricultural and forest ecosystems. They occur primarily in tropical Asia (e.g. India, Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam, Japan, New Guinea) and Australia (e.g. E. bunda in Queensland).

It was acquired by Stratasys in June 2013. , MakerBot has sold over 100,000 desktop 3D printers worldwide. Since 2009, the company has released 6 generations of 3D printers, with the latest being the Replicator+ and Replicator Mini+. It was the leader of the desktop market with an important presence in the media but its market share is in decline.Fortune: Why makerbot and 3d systems are losing the desktop 3d marketCONTEXT: Q1 2017 Global 3D Printer Market Findingsstatista: worldwide 3d printer model market distribution (units) MakerBot also founded and operates Thingiverse, the largest online 3D printing community and file repository.  History  MakerBot founders (left to right) Adam Mayer, Zach Smith and Bre Pettis with the final MakerBot Cupcake prototypes. Smith was one of the founding members of the RepRap Research Foundation, a non-profit group created to help advance early research in the area of open-source 3D printers. Bre Pettis got inspired during an art residency in Vienna with Johannes Grenzfurthner/monochrom in 2007, when he wanted to create a robot that could print shot glasses for the event Roboexotica and did research about the RepRap project at the Vienna hackerspace Metalab.Interview in 'Open Design Now', published by Waag Shot glasses remained a theme throughout the history of MakerBot.CNN about Bre Pettis printing shot glasses at SXSW 2013 The company started shipping kits in April 2009 and had sold approximately 3,500 units . Demand for the kits was so great in 2009 that the company solicited MakerBot owners to provide parts for future devices from their own MakerBots. Seed funding of $75,000 was provided by Jake Lodwick ($50,000) and Adrian Bowyer and his wife, Christine ($25,000). In August 2011, venture capital firm The Foundry Group invested $10 million in the company and joined its board. In April 2012, Zachary Smith was pushed out, involving disagreement on adherence to open-source principles, and likely also about integration with Stratasys. Private security led out 100 employees laid off around the same time. On June 19, 2013, Stratasys Incorporated announced that it had acquired MakerBot in a stock deal worth $604 million, with $403 million in stock paid up front, based on the current share value of Stratasys. The deal provided that MakerBot would operate as a distinct brand and subsidiary of Stratasys, serving the consumer and desktop market segments. When acquired, Makerbot had sold 22,000 printers. Bre Pettis moved to a position at Stratasys and was replaced as CEO by Jennifer Lawton, who in 2015 was succeeded by Jonathan Jaglom, then in January 2017,Makerbot announces resignation of CEO Jonathan Jaglom, appoints company president Nadav Goshen as successor Nadav Goshen. In April 2015, it was reported that in an effort to integrate MakerBot's activities better with those of Stratasys, Jaglom laid off around 100 of 500 employees and closed the existing three MakerBot retail locations. Then, 80 other employees were laid off in October 2015.Business insider: Makerbot layoffs 3d printing 2015 10 In February 2017, MakerBot's newly minted CEO Nadav Goshen laid off more than 40% of the workforce and changed the position of the company from consumer focused to two verticals based; professional and the education sector. This lay off was coined the \\"Valentine's Day Massacre\\" as it happened the day after. Overnight MakerBot went from 400 employees to under 200 worldwide.  Products  A MakerBot printing a cylindrical object MakerBot's first products were sold as do it yourself kits, requiring only minor soldering, with an assembly process compared to assembling IKEA furniture. Current models are designed as closed- box products, with no assembly required. MakerBot printers print with polylactic acid (PLA), acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), high-density polyethylene (HDPE), and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA).  Cupcake CNC  MakerBot Cupcake CNC; Forerunner to the Thing-O-Matic The Cupcake CNC was introduced in April 2009 as a rapid prototyping machine. The source files needed to build the devices were put on Thingiverse, allowing anyone to make one from scratch. The Cupcake CNC featured a usable build volume of 100 mm x 100 mm x 130 mm (L/W/H) and has outside dimensions of 350 mm x 240 mm x 450 mm. Because of the open source nature of the product, any suggestions for improvements came from users. During its primary production run (April 2009 to September 2010), the Cupcake CNC kit was updated several times to incorporate new upgrades into each successive version.  Thing-O-Matic  Fully Assembled Thing-O-Matic with MK6 Stepstruder Extrusion Head Introduced in September 2010 at Maker Faire NYC, the Thing-O-Matic was MakerBot's second kit. It shipped with many of the aftermarket upgrades that had been built for Cupcake. The stock Thing- O-Matic included a heated, automated build platform, an MK5 plastruder, a redesigned z-stage and upgraded electronics. It featured a build volume of 100 mm x 100 mm x 100 mm (4\\" x 4\\" x 4\\") and outside dimensions of 300 mm x 300 mm x 410 mm (12\\" x 12\\" x 16\\" L/W/H). The device interfaces via USB or a Secure Digital (SD) card. The Thing-O-Matic was discontinued in the spring of 2012. MakerBot agreed to support the Thing-o-Matic until their supply of parts was exhausted. Assembly instructions are available online through the MakerBot Wiki. The Thing-O-Matic is open-source hardware and is licensed under the GNU GPLv3. As such, the Thing-O-Matic can be heavily altered and improved by users. Some MakerBot operators developed upgrades to the platform that were later incorporated into factory kits. MakerBot has credited those early innovators in their documentation, some of the companies were inspired by MakerBot and created innovations in 3D printing like 3D printed dress.  Replicator  In January 2012 MakerBot introduced the Replicator. It offered more than double the build volume of the Thing-o-Matic at 22.5 cm x 14.5 cm x 15.0 cm (8.9\\" x 5.7\\" x 5.9\\" L/W/H). Other features included a dual extruder allowing two-color builds, an LCD screen and a control pad. The Replicator was sold pre-assembled with no kit version available. It was the last open-source MakerBot printer.  Replicator 2 Desktop 3D Printer  MakerBot Replicator 2 Desktop 3D Printer In September 2012, MakerBot introduced the Replicator 2. This newest model again increased the build volume, this time to 28.5 cm x 15.3 cm x 15.5 cm (11.2\\" x 6.0\\" x 6.1\\"L/W/H) and can print at 100 ¬µm per layer. The dual extruder was changed back to a single extruder head, while the upgraded electronics, LCD, and gamepad remained similar to the original Replicator. Unlike previous models, the Replicator 2 can print only using PLA plastic, which comes sold in sealed bags with desiccant to protect it from moisture. The Replicator 2 is sold only pre-assembled.  Replicator 2X Experimental 3D Printer  Alongside the Replicator 2, MakerBot also released the Replicator 2X. The 2X model was intended as an experimental version of the 2 that includes a completely enclosed build area, redesigned dual-extruders, and a heated aluminum build platform ‚Äì all of which enable printing with ABS plastic and dual-material printing.  Digitizer Desktop 3D Scanner  MakerBot Digitizer In August 2013, MakerBot released the Digitizer, a 3D scanner. The product was designed to allow MakerBot users to scan physical objects and turn them into digital, 3D printable models. The accompanying software allowed models to be edited, printed immediately, or uploaded to Thingiverse.  5th Generation Replicator Desktop 3D Printer  In January 2014, MakerBot released its Replicator Desktop 3D Printer with a build volume of 25.2 cm x 19.9 cm x 15.0 cm (9.9\\" x 7.8\\" x 5.9\\" L/W/H). This Fifth Generation Replicator features WiFi enabled software that connects the printer to MakerBot desktop and mobile apps.  Replicator Mini Compact 3D Printer  Also in January 2014, MakerBot released the Replicator Mini with a build volume of 10.0 cm x 10.0 cm x 12.5 cm (3.9\\" x 3.9\\" x 4.9\\" L/W/H), layer resolution of 200 ¬µm, and a positioning precision of 11 ¬µm on the x and y-axis and 2.5 ¬µm in the z-axis.  Replicator Z18 3D Printer  Released alongside the Replicator Mini and 5th Generation Replicator, the Z18 offers a build volume of 30.0 cm x 30.5 cm x 47.5 cm (11\\" x 12\\" x 18\\" L/H/W), totaling over 2,000 cubic inches.  METHOD and METHOD X 3D Printer  In December 2018, MakerBot introduced the METHOD 3D Printer as a bridge between desktop accessibility features and industrial 3D printing technologies. This new 3D Printer incorporated 15 Stratasys patents (MakerBot's parent company) and 15 new patents from MakerBot. The new 3D Printer has a Circulated Heated Chamber (60 ¬∞C) Dual Extruders, uses soluble PVA supports and has a network of 21 sensors monitoring all aspects of 3D Printing process. The Method has as spring steel build plate allowing for easy removal of 3D prints. The Method has dry-sealed humidity and temperature monitored material bays and was launched with the capability of printing in PLA, Tough‚Ñ¢ and PET-G. An ultra rigid metal frame construction reduces flexing during printing, allowing precision layer resolution of 20 to 400 micron and dimensional accuracy of +/- 0.2mm. Connectivity is WiFi; Ethernet; USB cable; USB drive. The build volume of the new Method with dual extrusion is 19L * 19W * 19.6H cm This new platform allowed Makerbot to follow with the release of the METHOD X in August 2019, which includes a heated build chamber (100 ¬∞C) capable of printing with real ABS material, using SR-30 support material and with more 3D Printing materials in development https://www.makerbot.com/3d-printers/method/  MakerBot Innovation Center  Envisioned as a solution for major clients, the MakerBot Innovation Center incorporates hardware (optimized suite of 3D Printers), SAAS workflow software, training services, and enterprise support. The first Innovation Center was established in February 2014 at SUNY New Paltz. Customers are largely universities such as University of Maryland, Florida Polytechnic, UMass Amherst, and Xavier University. Many Innovation Centers increase their surrounding community's access to 3D printing.  Manufacturing  Until mid 2016, manufacturing was performed in its own facilities in New York, then it was contracted to Jabil Circuit. The New York manufacturing personnel was laid off, while development, logistics, and repair operations remain in New York.The verge: Makerbot manufacturing  Services  MakerBot hosts the online community Thingiverse, where users can upload 3D printable files, document designs, and collaborate 3D printing projects and on open source hardware. The site is a collaborative repository for design files used in 3D printing, laser cutting and other DIY manufacturing processes.  Media coverage  MakerBot was featured on The Colbert Report in August 2011. They sent a bust of Stephen Colbert, printed on a MakerBot 3D printer, into the stratosphere attached to a helium filled weather balloon. Netflix published in September 2014 the documentary Print the Legend about Makerbot history.  Controversies  Due to its detachment from open source community, the departure of its founders, reliability problems with the 'smart extruder' and questionable users clauses on the Thingiverse site,Hackaday: 3d printering the problem of Thingiverse there have been many recent controversiesTridimake: Do not buy Makerbot 3d printers around Makerbot.

This led to a class action lawsuitMakezine: Makerbot faces class action lawsuit over faulty extruders which was dismissed.3D printing Industry: Class action Makerbot dismissed3dprint.com: Makerbot lawsuit dismissed Ultimately, Makerbot replaced the failing extruder with a new version.The Verge: New Makerbot smart extruder  Closed source hardware  Around September 2012 the company stated that for their new Replicator 2 they \\"will not share the way the physical machine is designed or our GUI\\". This departure from the previous open-source hardware model was criticized by part of the community, including co-founder (and now former employee) Zachary Smith. In 2014, the company faced significant criticism when it filed patent applications for designs that some claimed had been invented by members of its community and published to Thingiverse, such as the quick release extruder. Community members accused MakerBot of asserting ownership over their designs when those designs had been contributed with the understanding that they would remain open source. Then-CEO Bre Pettis released a statement dismissing these critics, citing patents that had been filed for unique inventions prior to any community-created designs, namely that the patent for the quick release extruder was originally filed in 2012 while the open source design was first published to Thingiverse in 2013.

It is a historic building located on Fifth Street North in Bismarck, North Dakota, United States, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. It was built by prominent businessman and political powerhouse Edward Patterson in 1906 as a second-class hotel to his other property, the high-class Northwestern Hotel.\\"Hotel: Three Story One to be Built by E.G. Patterson Next Spring\\" - The Bismarck Tribune 3 Feb, 1906 The four-floor, 76-room hotel was named after the Soo Line Railroad which had arrived in town in 1902 and whose depot was located several blocks away. It was briefly the tallest building in Bismarck. History Edward Patterson chose Fargo architect Milton Earle Beebe to design the hotel. Beebe had previously designed the Patterson Block for him, also listed on the National Register and located around the corner from the Soo on Main Street. The basement and first two floors were constructed of reinforced concrete with the upper walls being tied to concrete facing blocks pressed at the construction site.\\"Concrete Foundation\\" - The Bismarck Tribune 29 Jun, 1906 The third and fourth floors were constructed entirely of 6-inch cement blocks with wood framing due to the fourth floor possibly being a last-minute addition. The facade is faced with glazed \\"Spot-Iron\\" Hebron pressed brick manufactured by the Hebron Brick Company in Hebron, North Dakota. The building originally sported a tall brick pediment stating the name of the Hotel and the date of construction but this was removed sometime after the 1930s. When completed in early 1907 the building was advertised as \\"absolutely fireproof\\" recalling the fire that had destroyed most of downtown Bismarck in 1898.\\"Advertisement for the Soo Hotel\\" - The Bismarck Tribune 2 Feb, 1909 Following the construction of the adjacent McKenzie Hotel in 1911, built by Patterson and owned by Alexander McKenzie, a close friend of Patterson's, the two hotels were connected to allow patrons of the Soo access to the McKenzie's dining facilities. After McKenzie's passing in 1922, Patterson acquired his hotel and would rename it the Patterson Hotel in March 1927.\\"McKenzie Hotel Name is Changed\\" - The Bismarck Tribune 4 Mar, 1927. At the same time Patterson renamed the Soo hotel the Princess. This supposedly was a jab at his arch-rival in the Bismarck business and political world, Edmond A. Hughes, who shortly before had been involved in renaming the Van Horn Hotel, two blocks west, the Prince Hotel. In the mid-1930s, Patterson renamed the Princess the Patterson Hotel Annex. Although it remained a separate hotel, guests had to check in at the Patterson Hotel desk. Around 1950 the hotel came under new ownership and was renamed The Dakotan. At this time the building was separated from the Patterson and as part of a major interior remodel had its own lobby re-constructed as well as having its own elevator installed in the building's light shaft.\\"Hotels Completing Building, Remodeling Projects.\\" - The Bismarck Tribune 14 Mar, 1950 With the construction of Interstate 94 in 1964 business began to decline in downtown Bismarck and by the end of the 1970s, the Dakotan closed for business.

A Roman Catholic, Kanzler was thus a member of the Centre Party and served this party in the Landtag of Bavaria as representative for Lichtenfels from 1905 to 1918.Philip Rees, Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right Since 1890, 1990, p. 205 Noted for his anti-communism he organised a B√ºrgerwehr or militia against the communists in Rosenheim in 1919. This group grew into the Freikorps Chiemgau, for a time the largest single Freikorps in Germany, under the command of Kanzler who became known as the 'White General'. Kanzler became an ally of the rightist militant Georg Escherich and soon led his own Organisation Kanzler or 'Orka' in imitation of Escherich's Orgesch. Like his ally he became close to Richard Steidle in Austria and helped him in the organisation of the Heimwehr. Kanzler stood down from his Freikorps roles in 1921 and later became a member of Carl Spruner von Mertz's Bayerischer Heimat- und K√∂nigsbund, a monarchist group that was outlawed in 1933 after the formation of the Nazi Party regime. Indeed, Kanzler had been an early leader of this group, which - beyond a nostalgically sentimental attachment to the House of Wittelsbach - had little function, before giving way to General von Krafft.James Donohoe, Hitler's Conservative Opponents in Bavaria: 1930 - 1945 ; a Study of Catholic, Monarchist, and Separatist Anti-Nazi Activities, Brill Archive, 1961, p. 106 Kanzler had little in common with the Nazis and was jailed for treason during the Third Reich for attempting to promote monarchism and for co-operating with the Black Front of Otto Strasser.

History The Cassatt Quartet was founded in 1985 by four young artists at Juilliard who were inspired by the work of artist Mary Cassatt. It won the Coleman Chamber Music Competition one year later, and two top prizes in the Banff International String Quartet Competition in 1989. At that time the quartet consisted of Laura Goldberg and Muneko Otani, violins; Sarah Adams, viola; and Anna Cholakian, cello. Founding members included cellist Anna Cholakian and violinist Laura J. Goldberg. Goldberg went on to join the Juilliard pre-college teaching faculty and later left the quartet.Juilliard Focus on Art, by Greta Berman She later founded Arts Ahimsa, a group that uses music and the arts to promote non-violence. In 1991 the quartet, composed of Muneko Otani, Laura Goldberg (violin); Michiko Oshima (viola); Anna Cholakian (cello) performed for the soundtrack of the TV Show Fishing with John. That work appears in a CD produced in 1998.

Artistic style The duo's music blends Okinawan folk songs with Western dance music and dub, and they often collaborate with native Okinawan singers and other musicians. Though their music may at times sound like a DJ's mix of dance tracks with min'y≈ç tracks, it consists mostly, if not entirely, of compositions composed, performed and recorded as original, new pieces. It may draw extensively from traditional lyrics, tunes, and chords, it is never simply mixed from pre-existing recordings by other artists, and always includes considerable original elements. The pair started out incorporating vocals and other elements via sampling, on later albums and other releases they have worked directly with Okinawan artists, recording vocals and other elements live in the studio.Heifetz, Sari. \\"A Pair of Westerners Who Are Reshaping Okinawan Fusion.\\" Global Rhythm Magazine. February/March 2003. pp20-21. The duo has released four albums, and their music has been included in Buddha Bar compilation albums and used on a variety of television programs, documentaries, and other media. Though questions could be raised about Westerners appropriating Okinawan music, the duo's reception in Okinawa by locals has been described as \\"ecstatic\\". The duo first tested their music in dance clubs in Okinawa, and were well received, the natives even dancing traditional kachashi dances to it.Renton, Jamie. \\"Beats of Okinawa.\\" Folk Roots Magazine. November 2002. pp. 43-45. In an interview in 2003, Taylor expressed that \\"we are both sensitive to the fact that Okinawan music is an important part of Okinawan culture, and we certainly don't want to disrespect it or commercialize it in a cheap way for profit. However, I'm confident we haven't done either.\\" Taylor cites Rinken Band, the Nenes, and Champloose, the leading bands of the 1970s Uchinaa pop boom, among the duo's influences. Just as those bands took up electric guitar and other \\"modern\\" instruments and sought to replicate the traditional folk songs, so Taylor notes that he and Gordon saw potential in doing something similar using computer equipment. Most of Ryukyu Underground's albums and singles are released by the label Respect Records (Japan). Background Gordon grew up in Newcastle upon Tyne, in England, and was a fan of David Bowie and early punk music.Martin, Ian. \\"Ryukyu Underground do it with feeling.\\" Japan Times. 24 April 2009.

He first started playing music in the early 1980s, primarily on synthesizer but is said to have been \\"out of sync with the mods and metalheads around him\\", before shifting to DJing and organizing events in Manchester. In an interview with the Japan Times, he describes this as \\"a good time to be in Manchester,\\" but by the late 1980s, he was tired of the aggressive scene there. Leaving England, Gordon spent some time in Denmark, where he found a more open and welcoming environment for his music. One of his tracks, a remix of the theme to the television show \\"Twin Peaks\\", was No. 1 on the Finnish charts for a time. Gordon eventually left Denmark and after four years traveling through Asia and Australasia ended up in Okinawa, where in 1998 he met the American Jon Taylor, who was there doing doctoral research on the environmental problems faced by the islanders. Taylor had previously been a member of The Subjects, an electronic group, and had played guitar for several reggae groups, including U-Roy and The Ethiopians.\\"Ryukyu Underground: Kajimaya.\\" Global Noize: Six Degrees Records official blog. Gordon describes Taylor as having been the one to motivate him into starting Ryukyu Underground and taking it seriously.

The site contains a variety of architectural features including platforms, plazas, retaining walls or terraces, funerary areas, ramps, and paved roads.  Location  Las Mercedes is located 90 m above sea level in Mercedes District, Gu√°cimo, Lim√≥n Province, Costa Rica between the rivers Dos Novillos and Parismina, which are tributaries to the Reventaz√≥n River. Dos Novillos River is 700 m to the southeast and Parismina is 2.5 km to the northeast of the site.  Description  With a size of 25 hectares, Las Mercedes is divided into 3 large complexes: Las Mercedes-1, Las Mercedes-2, and Las Mercedes-3. However, only Las Mercedes-1 has been extensively studied. Recent excavations at Las Mercedes-1 (L-289 LM-1) have revealed that it has an area of 5 hectares and consists of 7 platforms, 2 plazas, 6 retaining walls or terraces, 7 walls, 4 funerary areas, 1 ramp, and is where the 2 roads converge.V√°zquez Leiva & Chapdelaine 2009: 37  Chronology  Investigations in this part of the site have determined that the site was occupied from circa 1500 BC to circa AD 1500 and that monumental architecture began being constructed around AD 1000. We know that the former inhabitants of Las Mercedes were still living there at the time of the initial Spanish arrival because a number of glass beads of historic European origin have been found during excavations. This indicated that trade may have occurred between the Las Mercedes inhabitants and the Spanish.Segura 2009 Platforms In all, Las Mercedes has at least 15 platforms. Three of these platforms are located around a principal/central platform (known as the Hartman Platform), and are united by intra-site causeways. The Hartman Platform (R1) is 6 metres tall and has a diameter of 30 metres. It was first excavated by C. V. Hartman who removed two 1.85 mtale stone male \\"warrior\\" figurines among other artifacts. Today these sculptures are housed at the Museum of Ethnography, Sweden. Three of the 15 platforms have been studied more extensively. Platform R12 is circular, 1 metre tall, and has a 28-metre diameter. Moreover, this platform is accompanied by 7 metre wide, 30 metre long ramp or causeway (R11), which connects to a stone terrace (R10). The second most studied platform (R9) is actually two conjoined platforms with a figure eight shape. The circular part has a 25-metre diameter and the oblong part measures 22x20 metres. The third of these platforms (R14) has an irregular shape \\"like a peanut\\" according to archaeologist Ricardo V√°squez.Segura 2009 All of these platforms, circular or not, are thought to have been covered with conical shaped huts made out of organic materials that have decomposed without a trace. Causeways Las Mercedes is the home of two well-documented stone-paved roads, named The Iroquois Causeway and The Pocora Causeway for the present-day towns they lead towards from the main architectural complex of the site. With widths ranging between 5 and 8 meters, they follow a northwest to southeast path,V√°zquez Leiva & Chapdelaine 2009: 37 running perpendicular to the river drainage system.Ibid.: 27 The research to date has registered much data about The Pocora Causeway, whereas our knowledge of The Iroquois Causeway will never be complete due to its alteration and partial destruction over the years. The straight stone-paved Iroquois Causeway has been followed for about 660 m at the edge of the EARTH University reserve that contains the site. However, researchers predict that it extended as far as the Iroquois settlement.37 Although The Iroquois Causeway has not been followed in its totality, it may be presumed that it is of a comparable length to The Pocora Causeway, based on their similarity in design.65 The Pocora Causeway begins in the main complex and extends for an indefinite distance, going beyond the zone southeast of the complex, where it was not possible to clear vegetation during the 2005 field season. The Pocora Causeway continues for more than 300 m, running parallel to a secondary road, which connects to the Dos Novillos River. This causeway was raised above the surface as a protective measure against flooding. When The Pocora Causeway reaches its southeast extent, it comes to an end intersecting with a small stream known as Santa Emilia. Just before it reaches the stream The Pocora Causeway is flanked by an architectural complex consisting of two low walls with circular halves on the southeast side (R31 & R32), resembling those of the main complex.41 A set of stairs (R33) between the circular structures, descends to the stream.42 There may have once been a suspension bridge across Santa Emilia, connecting the two roads and the two architectural complexes. Such suspension bridges may have once also crossed the channels of the rivers Dos Novillos and Iroquois, too.Benfer 2009: 36 The researchers think that this road system included a stone drainage system to reduce the effect of water flow across the road surfaces, however none have been identified.V√°zquez Leiva & Chapdelaine 2009: 64 In the area near the stream Santa Emilia a footpath with a width of 3 meters was defined by a linear depression in the land‚Äôs surface. This unnamed footpath extends in the same general direction as the road, and was followed as far as 150 m. However, it seems to disappear about 400 meters before reaching Destierro River.Ibid.: 43 Both the Iroquois and Pocora causeways offered formalized, controlled, and ceremonial access to the central part of Las Mercedes-1 architectural complex. The roads go in opposite directions from the center of the site along a route perpendicular to the hydrographic system. The geographic context of Las Mercedes-1, located between streams and rivers on all sides, has raised the question of whether the sphere of influence of a chiefly political center might be bounded by hydrographic systems. It might have been that these surrounding hydrographic systems served defensive functions as naturally existing barriers. The Pocora Causeways does not communicate directly with another archaeological site, but is aiming towards Williamsburg (L-58Wb) 3.5 km to the southeast of Las Mercedes-1. While the causeway ends 1.5 km before reaching Williamsburg, a footpath has been archaeologically identified that may extend the rest of the way connecting these sites.64 Viewing these roads as part of one extensive construction project sharing the same constructive techniques, it is obvious that the cost of the roads to the former inhabitants of Las Mercedes-1 must have been great.Benfer 2009: 37 A lot of time and manpower were required for the preparation of the terrain, the quantity of stone, the volume of fill, and the amount of other construction materials that must have been transported for the construction of these magnificent roads.V√°zquez Leiva & Chapdelaine 2009: 65Benfer 2009: 35-37 Funerary Areas The first cemeteries were excavated by C. V. Hartman in 1896Hartman 1901 and subsequently by Alanson Skinner during the winter of 1916-1917.Lothrop 1926: 451-467 Hartman excavated a total of 17 graves in four different circular funerary platformsHartman 1901 and Skinner also excavated in 4 different cemeteries.Lothrop 1926: 451-467 Both of these excavations revealed rectangular, box-shaped, stone-lined graves, most of which had cobblestone walls with both a flat limestone floor and roof. Hartman only found the remains of human bones in one of the graves.Hartman 1901: 28 Most of the graves he excavated contained ceramic vessels and other burial goods. The ceramics were said to have shown wear marks indicating that they were once employed as cooking utensils or for some other utilitarian purpose. Some of the other contents of graves recorded by Hartman include two stone celts and a European-manufactured bead of blue glass. The latter indicates that the builders of the grave were alive during the 16th century.Hartman 1901 Skinner's excavations revealed ceramic vessels in the graves along with such other grave goods as incense burners, stone disks, meteoric iron gravers, flint stone knives, greenstone earspools, jade ornaments, a copper bell, carved stone statues and tables, celts, and even some gold or tumbaga objects.Lothrop 1926: 451-467 Site Significance Recent excavations at Las Mercedes are helping archaeologists understand the role it once served to the indigenous peoples of Costa Rica before 1502 when Christopher Columbus arrived in Costa Rica. Archaeologists now believe that Las Mercedes was a political center, like Guayabo de Turrialba. The site is associated with the H√ºetar, a Chibchan-speaking people. After analyzing the artifacts uncovered during the 2009 field school archaeologists are relatively certain that Las Mercedes served as a powerful political center for the region‚Äîprobably the center of a chiefdom.Solana B. 3 May 2009 The 2009 excavations also provided evidence contrary to the assertion that all platforms in Costa Rica are circular, because both a figure-eight-shaped platform and a peanut-shaped platform were excavated.Segura 2009  History of Excavations at Las Mercedes  In 1871 Las Mercedes was bisected by the construction of the railroad connecting the country's capital to Puerto Lim√≥n on the Caribbean coast. Today part of the site is protected within the campus of the Escuela de Agricultura de la Regi√≥n Tropical H√∫meda or EARTH University.V√°zquez Leiva & Chapdelaine 2009: 29 1871: Minor C. Keith & the Railroad to the Atlantic Las Mercedes was first discovered in 1871 during the construction of the railroad to the Caribbean Sea from the Costa Rican Central Valley, as it was directly in the path of railroad construction.Segura 2009 Minor C. Keith, the American commissioned to construct the railroad (and the principle founder of the United Fruit Company), came across a gold artifact at Las Mercedes. This discovery inspired Keith to not only conduct non-scientific excavations at Las Mercedes, but also to collect artifacts from all over Costa Rica. Eventually Mr. Keith collected 16,608 artifacts, some of which were auctioned off after his death. Most of these artifacts, some of which are from Las Mercedes, are now housed by the Brooklyn Museum and the American Museum of Natural History in New York, the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., and the Ethnography Museum in Sweden.Aguilar Bonilla 2007 During his life Mr. Keith presented some artifacts to museums. For example, several large stone sculptures were presented to the National Museum in Washington.Hartman 1901: 7 1896: Carl Vilhelm Hartman The first archaeological excavations were done by C. V. Hartman, a Swedish botanist and anthropologist in 1896.Segura 2009 Hartman's descriptions of his various excavations include an early depiction of the architecture around the principal platform, descriptions of the stone figures he uncovered, descriptions of the architecture of 17 graves found in four different platforms, a description of a \\"cache\\" of ceramics in a rectangular sunken chamber, details about an area of concentrated worked stone that may have been a stone cutters work place, a description of a clay pit, and detailed listings of the artifacts found in each grave or other excavation area.Hartman 1901 File:Large Mound near Mercedes 3, map.jpgalt=Plan by Hartman for the great mound and walls, Las Mercedes, 1896.Plan by Hartman for the great mound and walls, Las Mercedes, 1896.

Winter of 1916-1917: Alanson Skinner During the winter of 1916-1917 Alanson Skinner conducted archaeological excavations at Las Mercedes, Anita Grande, and Costa Rica Farm Site. His excavation notes indicate that he excavated parts of four cemeteries and one \\"mound\\" or platform, and lists off the artifacts found in each excavation. Skinner's description was the first to note the existence of the causeways. He also mentions that others like Alpizar (who worked for Mr. Keith) and J. H. Wilson had excavated at the site.Lothrop 1926 May and June 2005: Ricardo V√°zquez, Claude Chapdelaine, & the University of Montr√©al Field-School After Skinner completed his excavations only a few minor archaeological investigations were conducted at Las Mercedes until 2005. During May and June 2005 Ricardo V√°squez, an archaeologist from the Museo Nacional de Costa Rica, and Dr. Claude Chapdelaine with a group of his students from the University of Montr√©al, Canada conducted an archaeological field-school. Their work focused on a area of the central sector of Las Mercedes. By the end of the field- school, the team's stratigraphic excavations and mapping labors resulted in drawing of a general site plan, digital mapping of the most outstanding architectonic features, dating the site's earliest occupation to around 3,000 years ago, and the beginnings of carbon 14 based chronology for the site.Museo Nacional de Costa Rica 2009V√°zquez Leiva & Chapdelaine 2008 January and February 2009: Ricardo V√°zquez, Robert M.

He is best known for his novels set in the American West, including the \\"Barnaby Skye\\" series. Wheeler was the 2001 recipient of the Owen Wister Award for lifetime contributions to Western literature, and is a six-time Western Writers of America Spur Award winner. Early life Born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Richard Wheeler was raised in the suburb of Wauwatosa in a family descended from New England Puritans. Following graduation from Wauwatosa High School in 1953, Wheeler moved to California in the mid-1950s for three years. At first intending to be a playwright, he studied at the Pasadena Playhouse, later taking acting lessons and trying his hand at being a screenwriter. While in California he supported himself by working in a Hollywood record store and as a freelance photographer. Meeting with little success, he returned to his native Wisconsin and attended the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Professional career Wheeler returned to the west after attending the University of Wisconsin, working at a succession of newspapers including the Nevada Appeal, Phoenix Gazette, Oakland Tribune, and Billings Gazette. In 1972 he switched careers and became a book editor for a number of publishers, most notably Walker & Company. Inspired by both the westerns he was editing and the frequent layoffs in the industry which left him with free time, Wheeler penned his first novel, Bushwhack, published by Doubleday in 1978. He wrote five more novels in the 1970s and 1980s while still working as a book editor, before turning his attention to writing full-time in 1987. Two years later he won the first of five Spur Awards from the Western Writers of America with his 1989 book, Fool's Coach. Personal life Wheeler was married to Sue Hart, a professor at Montana State University Billings, who died in the summer of 2014.

Everts (1816February 16, 1901) was the first federal tax assessor for the Montana Territory and a member of the 1870 Washburn‚ÄìLangford‚ÄìDoane Expedition, which explored the area which later became Yellowstone National Park. He became lost in the wilderness for 37 days during the expedition and a year later became more widely known after writing about his ordeal for Scribner‚Äôs Monthly. History Everts was one of six brothers born in Burlington, Vermont to a Great Lakes ship captain. During the American Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln appointed Everts the first Assessor of Internal Revenue for the newly created Montana Territory, a position he held between July 15, 1864 and February 16, 1870. \\"Thirty-Seven Days of Peril\\" In 1870, President Ulysses S. Grant's administration replaced Everts in his role as tax assessor. After months of unemployment in the frontier territory, Everts took the opportunity to accompany an expedition led by Henry D. Washburn and Nathaniel P. Langford into the still largely unexplored wilderness that would later become Yellowstone National Park. The Washburn‚ÄìLangford‚ÄìDoane Expedition of 1870 was the second official survey of the Yellowstone region in less than two years. After falling behind the rest of the expedition on September 9, 1870, Everts managed to lose the pack horse which was carrying most of his supplies. Without food or equipment, he attempted to retrace the expedition's route along the southern shore of Yellowstone Lake in the hopes of finding his companions. He ate a songbird and minnows raw, and a local thistle plant to stay alive; the plant (Cirsium foliosum, commonly known as elk thistle) was later renamed \\"Evert's Thistle\\" after him. As well as the lack of food, Everts faced the coming autumn weather, including early snowstorms, and at one point was stalked by a mountain lion. Everts' party searched for him for more than a week, setting signal fires, firing guns into the air, and leaving notes and caches of supplies for Everts along the lake. Though a site near the lake had earlier been designated as a meeting point in case one of the party members became lost, Everts, for unknown reasons, never showed. The expedition returned to Fort Ellis by early October. His friends in Helena offered a reward of $600 to find his remains. On October 16, more than a month after his separation from the group, two local mountain men ‚Äì \\"Yellowstone Jack\\" Baronett and George A. Pritchett ‚Äì found Everts, suffering from frostbite, burn wounds from thermal vents and his campfire, and other injuries suffered during his ordeal, so malnourished he weighed only . Baronett and Pritchett were part of a search party which had been sent from Montana to find Everts' remains. They discovered him, mumbling and delirious, more than from where he had first become lost. One man stayed with Everts to nurse him back to health while the other walked for help. Everts' rescuers brought him to Bozeman, where he recovered. The next year, Everts' personal account of the experience, \\"Thirty-Seven Days of Peril\\", was published in Scribner‚Äôs Monthly. The story of his survival became national news and contributed a great deal of publicity to the movement to preserve the Yellowstone area as the country's first national park. In spite of their assistance, Everts denied Baronett and Pritchett payment of the reward, claiming he could have made it out of the mountains on his own. Henry D. Washburn named a peak near Mammoth Hot Springs \\"Mount Everts\\" shortly after Everts' rescue. During the expedition, Washburn had named a peak in the Thorofare region south of Yellowstone Lake for Everts but later changed it to the current peak, believing it to be near the location of the rescue. In fact Everts was rescued much farther north, near Blacktail Deer Creek. Later years After the two expeditions and the fame from his article, Everts was offered the position of first superintendent of the newly established Yellowstone National Park, but he declined since it did not include a salary. He later moved to Hyattsville, Maryland and worked in the U.S. Post Office. He died there in 1901, in his home, of pneumonia.

In 1905, there was a confluence of international events leading to the loss of Chos≈èn Korean sovereignty, and by 1910, Japan formally annexed Korea outright. The Japanese, having already defeated Qing China (1895) and signed an alliance with the United Kingdom (1902), defeated Imperial Russia (1905), and came to an understanding with the United States (the Taft-Katsura Agreement of 1905) to respect each other's colonial \\"Spheres of Influence\\" in the Pacific. In these chaotic times, an eclectic group of Koreans find refuge in the quintessentially American pastime. Plot The film plays out as a flashback, experienced by a young Korean boy, as he, like his great-great grandfather prepares to play baseball. The flashback opens with the protagonist of the film, Yi Ho-chang, and his friend in a field. The two are supposed to be studying; however Yi Ho-chang is preoccupied with his soccer ball, which he accidentally kicks into a nearby property. Ho-chang climbs the gate to retrieve his ball, and finds himself within the walls of the American Christian missionary school. There he discovers a much smaller and harder ball, which he comically mistakes for his shrunken soccer ball. At this point a Christian missionary appears and explains to the confused Ho-chang that he is in fact holding a baseball. Ho-chang quickly flees the premise; however his fascination with the new sport ensures his return for further investigation. Ho-chang, accompanied by several interested Koreans return to the school to join the YMCA baseball league. The unlikely group, and their female coach, Min Jung-rim prove to be successful, and quickly become the pride of their town. Throughout the film Ho-chang falls madly in love with his un-interested female coach, adding to the comic relief. One day while headed to practice the team is confronted by a group of Japanese soldiers, who claim that their practice ground is a new Japanese training camp. To settle the dispute one of the team members, Oh Dae-hyeon, who went to school in Tokyo with the Japanese Officer, suggests a competitive game of baseball. The game would not only settle the dispute, but it would also be a way for the Koreans to establish themselves against Japan, and for the players to further prove themselves to the skeptics of their town. Meanwhile, a more serious dispute is going on between the Korean diplomats and the revolutionary thinkers, over the signing of the Eulsa Treaty that officially made Korea a protectorate of Japan. Coincidentally, Oh Dae-hyeon and Min Jong-rim are members of the Anti-Eulsa League, an organization formed in protest of the Five Eulsa Traitors, which one of their teammate's, Kwang-tae, father belongs to. Due to all of the suppressed tension, the YMCA team loses to the Japanese, also losing their chance to dignify themselves in the face of their suppressors. Devastated over the loss, the team members decide to abandon baseball and return to more practical roles in society. Ho-chang fulfills his fathers wish and takes over the family school, despite his desires to become a great baseball player. In the end, the team reunites for one final and quite dramatic rematch against the Japanese. The Koreans victory in this rematch symbolizes their unity in baseball, and their ability to come together despite the social and cultural issues facing the changing country.

The events, which took place prior to the film, denote what took place historically and how a Japanese occupation came to Korea are listed as follows. The forceful opening of Japanese connections by the Americans between 1852 and 1854 by Commodore Matthew Perry had caused an internal restructuring of government by the Japanese known as the Meiji Restoration that began in 1868. Prior to Perry's arrival, the Japanese would only permit trade with the Dutch (East India Company) and any foreigner found in Japanese territory was, in most cases, promptly executed, often by beheading. During the Meiji restoration, Japanese focused on industrialization of Japan to reignite the Imperial glory of Japan, a country also known as Nippon. As with most imperial governments of the early 20th century, militarization and conquest through industrial and technological prowess ensured a place in the handful of nations that took part in global leadership. At the time, Britain was one of the most powerful nations on Earth and had the best Navy. Russia's government, an autocracy ruled by Czar Nicholas II, had been undergoing industrial development some years and now Russia was making way to expand its borders. As vast as Russia's territory is, most of its population lives in the warmer western borders of the nation. Between 1897 and 1898, Russia had arrived in Port Arthur, Manchuria and succeeded in securing a lease with the Chinese to use the harbor. China at that time was under the bindings of a non- exclusivity agreement with what was then known as the Great British Empire that forbade them to purchase goods from other countries. This agreement also led to the Boxer rebellion that ended in 1901. China had become rather weak after the Ming Dynasty and continually made concessions to foreign nations in trade rights and permission to settle inside its borders. Thus, it was taken for an easy target by many foreign nations, including Russia and Japan. Japan has had a historically unpleasant sentiment towards for China and Korea and with the Meiji restoration and militaristic buildup of Japanese forces, Japan sought to expand its borders much like Russia did. The western nations were extending each of their hands and negotiating or conquering more territory and resources. In almost direct relation to the west, Japan flexed its imperial capacity as well. Korea was a buffer zone between Japan and the Chinese mainland and provide an access conduit to all measure of logistical and consumable resources. If Japan was able to hold control or sovereignty over Korea, it would tactically ensure the safety of the Japanese homeland from attack and therefore was considered a highly valuable asset. In 1875, Japan had forced Korea to declare itself as an independent nation apart from China through force and open its borders. Korea traditionally had been a protectorate nation under Chinese authority. Over time after it became clear what this meant for Korea and China, Qing China attempted to recant the declaration against Japan and in August 1894 Japan began fighting with Qing (Chin) forces over the Korean Peninsula, known as the First Sino-Chinese war (1894‚Äì1895). The film YMCA Baseball takes places after these events have occurred and Japan has occupied Korea as a protectorate state of Japan. The Japanese have a highly invested interest in maintaining control of Korea and make every attempt to prohibit any inkling of resistance or possibility of uprising by the Korean people as portrayed by the film although somewhat overly exuberant. Korea's future lay uncertain and coincided with national sentiment of oppression towards the Japanese. With the Chosun dynasty ending and large western and other foreign influence there were two sentiments shared among the Korea people. Korea could either modernize or go back to the traditional ways of its historic past. Westerners and Japanese had made settlements in Korea; Missionary schools and military outposts respectively, and took full advantage of the fact Korea was in the midst of the twilight of its greatest dynasty, the Chosen. With the West to traveling and settling Asia, western culture and customs spread in turn. As the film's title states, YMCA baseball was a part of this divergence. George Williams founded the YMCA on June 6, 1844, in London, England; YMCA is an acronym for Young Men's Christian Association that began among evangelists. Known for its promotion of sports, it was actually also a missionary organization in conjunction with the Church and run locally and this would most likely have been encouraged even as far away as Korea. Baseball was first introduced in Korea in 1905 by Phillip L. Gillett, a missionary who introduced the sport to members of a YMCA in Seoul. Western missionaries of the YMCA colluded with the Japanese to abolish traditional Korean values and indoctrinate Korean youths to Japanese values and customs. This led many Koreans to study in Tokyo and this is represented by a few characters in the film. Indoctrination of the youth would steer Korea in the direction of modernization; Japan had been undergoing a surge of industrial production and western adoption and the West had already gone through several phases of industrialization. By subverting the youth of Korea to fall in line with more modern and foreign sentiments, in a way ensured the future relations with Korea and the inevitable outcome of this is a struggle between traditional Korean culture and values, and that of new influence. The remark about the Japanese first encountering baseball some thirty years earlier however, was accurate (1872).

Schulz's Peanuts franchise and developed by WildWorks for the Xbox Live Arcade service on the Xbox 360. It was announced on November 10, 2008 and released on June 2, 2010. An unofficial sequel to the 2006 video game Snoopy vs. the Red Baron, it features a similar World War I setting. Snoopy is tasked with defeating several members of the Flying Circus, a special flight squadron in the Luftstreitkr√§fte, and its commander, Manfred von Richthofen, also known as the Red Baron. The game was well-received by critics, where it drew comparisons to Crimson Skies. Critics praised the amount of content and polish in the game and stated it was well worth its price. As of year-end 2011, the game has sold over 122,000 copies. Gameplay Snoopy Flying Ace features online play over Xbox Live for up to 16 players. The gameplay is similar to that of another arcade-style flight combat series Crimson Skies. The primary gameplay revolves around dogfights using biplanes and triplanes. Players can also fly into stationary turrets and control them. Two-player cooperative is supported via splitscreen, and two players can play through the entire campaign together. Acrobatic maneuvers such as barrel rolls and immelmanns can also be performed. Players can select and customize one of several Peanuts characters, who have several outfits to choose from, or select and play as their Xbox Live avatar. Planes can also be customized, from visuals to weaponry. Each plane is equipped with machine guns, and other weapons such as missiles, an EMP blast, and floating mines can be equipped. Weaponry can also be changed during gameplay after players respawn. The game supports up to 16 players over Xbox Live, and features eight online game modes. Pigskin is an airborne rugby involving passing a ball among planes to reach the opposite goal without being shot down. The traditional Deathmatch and Team Deathmatch modes also appear, known in-game as Dogfight and Team Dogfight. Capture the flag is also available. Players can earn bonuses by gaining kill streaks in multiplayer; one example is that Woodstock will appear on the back of the plane and attack enemies from the rear after four kills in a row. Plot Snoopy Flying Ace is a fictional story set in 1917 Europe and northern Africa during World War I. Snoopy, a famous Allied fighter pilot, must combat the Imperial German Army Air Service. His primary target is a specialized group of pilots dubbed the Flying Circus, and its commander, Manfred von Richthofen, otherwise known as the Red Baron. The game features several characters from the Peanuts franchise, some belonging to the Royal Flying Corps in the Allied members of the French army faction, others to the German Empire in the Central Powers of the Austro-Hungarian Empire faction. During multiplayer matches players can choose any character, regardless of faction alignment during the campaign. The player's Xbox 360 avatar can also be used during gameplay, and is aligned to the faction of the player's choice. Development and marketing Snoopy Flying Ace was announced on November 10, 2008. Smart Bomb Interactive began development for the title with no publisher and no set platforms. It was later announced at Tokyo Game Show on September 24, 2009 that Microsoft Studios would be publishing the game for Xbox Live Arcade on the Xbox 360. It was shown in March 2010 at the Penny Arcade Expo where more features of the game were revealed. It was released on June 2, 2010. In promotion of the game, several Snoopy Flying Ace-themed avatar items were released on the Xbox Live Marketplace on June 8, 2010. A downloadable content pack dubbed Suppertime of Destruction was released on August 25, 2010. It features two additional planes, five additional multiplayer modes, three new weapons, and several new character costumes and plane skins. Smart Bomb Interactive stated that the inspiration for Flying Ace came from their well-received 2006 title, Snoopy vs. the Red Baron. \\"We were very proud of that game and it was a critical success, but the budget and time constraints that came from the publisher [Namco] left us feeling that we could have done a lot more. So we went to United Media and representatives of the Schulz family, and we licensed the property ourselves\\" stated Clark Stacey, Vice President for Smart Bomb Interactive. \\"But of course, it was Charles M. Schulz‚Äôs original strips of Snoopy as the World Famous WWI Flying Ace that are the ultimate inspiration\\" added Stacey. The game was developed using Bombshell, Smart Bomb Interactive's game engine and toolset. Reception Snoopy Flying Ace received \\"favorable\\" reviews according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. It also received an Editor's Choice award from IGN's Arthur Gies, who called it \\"both the best dogfighting game of this console generation and one of the most exciting multiplayer titles to come out this year.\\" As of August 2010, Snoopy Flying Ace has sold over 84,000 copies and as of year-end 2010, the game has sold over 110,000 copies. 2011 sales exceeded 122,000 units. Several reviewers stated that the game's price was a great value. Critics gave universally positive remarks in regards to gameplay. Eduardo Reboucas of Game Revolution said the game was \\"extremely easy to pick up\\", and added \\"Weapons are also varied and offer plenty of combinations for a lot of different tactics.\\" Eurogamer's Kristan Reed echoed his remarks and stated that \\"simplified objectives and stripped-down controls to make it instantly accessible to everyone.\\" Joe Donato of GameZone praised the dogfights and added \\"combat is a thrill.\\" 1UP.com's Chris Pereira also agreed and stated \\"it's a more accessible, trimmed-down version of Crimson Skies at a bargain price.\\" He was critical of the single player AI, however, and added \\"enemies evade your attacks so frequently that it feels like the game is just trying to artificially lengthen each encounter.\\" Reviewers also universally praised the online gameplay. Official Xbox Magazine (UK)s reviewer stated Snoopy Flying Ace \\"plays incredibly well on Xbox Live.\\" Brett Todd of GameSpot called the online play \\"intense\\" and \\"frenzied.\\" Like 1UP.com's Chris Pereira, however, Todd criticized the AI, stating that dogfights can occasionally become shallow. Todd also felt the game could have used even more focus on Peanuts characters. The Escapists John Funk called it \\"a whimsical, imaginative take on World War I that has you fighting for freedom and for fun. The missions get repetitive, and there are only three types of planes with different skins, but the combat itself is entertaining, the weapons are cool, the multiplayer is a ton of fun ‚Äì and it's jam-packed with lovable charm.\\" The game's graphics also received generally high marks. Game Informers Annette Gonzalez praised the environment and characters and stated \\"Charles M. Schulz‚Äô characters are impressively realized in the video game space.\\" The reviewer from Official Xbox Magazine (UK) called it a \\"great looking shooter.\\" Game Revolution's Eduardo Reboucas agreed, and added the game had \\"undeniable charm everywhere.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Category:2010 video games Category:Microsoft games Category:Video games based on Peanuts Category:Steampunk video games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:World War I video games Category:Fiction set in 1917 Category:Video games set in the 1910s Category:Xbox 360 Live Arcade games Category:Xbox 360-only games Category:Xbox 360 games Category:Flight simulation video games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games ","title":"Snoopy Flying Ace"},{"id":"24497363","text":"Richtree Market is a Canadian restaurant chain, which approximates the style of a European market.

His client list is far too long to include in this summary. No one person has had a greater impact on the development of contemporary music concert promotion and exclusive entertainment event planning for facilities throughout North America as Klotzman. It was in the late fifties, at the age of 13 ¬Ω that Klotzman began his journey into the business of Entertainment. Beginning as a DJ for Radio, record hops and even Bar Mitzvahs, Klotzman knew early on that this was going to be his chosen career. His determination, tenacity, and creativity soon catapulted him to the top of his field. Klotzman was always an innovator and forged a new era in concert touring, \\"the National Mega concert tour\\". He utilized arenas formerly exclusively used for Sports events as concert halls for the greatest Musical performers. He developed a network of exclusive venue representation and coordinated the country for the Artists. He sent the Artist across the country in customized buses leading convoys of truckloads of show gear traveling from city to city. Klotzman has produced over 25,000 live entertainment events over a period of 50 years. Now Klotzman heads the multimedia production and promotion consulting firm, Dick Klotzman Presents. He is currently working as a consultant in the Entertainment Industry for various firms throughout the country. Litigation In 1987 Klotzman was convicted of tax evasion, and sentenced to 3.5 years in prison. This conviction was for an action begun by the IRS in 1975. Assistant U.S. Attorney Herbert Better said Klotzman bilked two promoters in Anchorage, Alaska, of a $200,000 deposit in March 1985 during rock star Prince's Purple Rain Tour. Using an assumed name, Klotzman promised to set up a Prince concert in Anchorage, but instead pocketed the money. He also kept a $120,000 deposit from an Austin, Texas, promoter and $100,000 each from promoters in Indianapolis and Denver in 1981 and 1982 to arrange concerts by Ross, Better said. Those concerts were never held. The company that staged Prince's shows sued Klotzman in April 1985 for $10.5 million, charging he defrauded several promoters by promising to deliver Prince for concerts and collecting deposits to guarantee appearances. At that time it was discovered that Klotzman was bipolar and had been unmedicated for 45 years. Much of his self-destructive behavior during those years are directly attributable to the disease. In 1996 Klotzman was wrongfully arrested in connection with theft by deception charges. However, all charges were quickly dismissed and found to be without merit. He has been successfully medicated for the past 20 years.

A native of Ghent, he first came to politics as a member of the Frontpartij, along with the likes of Ward Hermans and Joris Van Severen.Philip Rees, Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right Since 1890, 1990, p. 134 In 1931 he joined the likes of Van Severen and Wies Moens in launching Verdinaso (The Verdinaso (Verbond der Dietse Nationaal-Solidaristen - Union of Diets National Solidarists) was an authoritarian and fascist-inspired political party in Belgium and the Netherlands during the 1930s), and was installed as deputy leader of the group the following year and head of the militia in 1937. Fran√ßois succeeded Van Severen as leader of Verdinaso after Van Severen's execution in 1940, taking the movement in a new, pro-Nazi Germany direction and merging them into the Flemish National Union.

The Hebrew volute is endemic to Brazil, where it is collected both for food and for its shell, which is highly desired for ornamental purposes. Recent studies indicate that natural populations of Voluta ebraea may be suffering declines due to overfishing and overexploitation. Distribution This sea snail is found only along the north and northeastern Brazilian coast in the littoral zone. This species is endemic to those areas. It is present in many Brazilian states and regions, including Par√°, Maranh√£o, Cear√°, Rio Grande do Norte, Para√≠ba, Pernambuco, Alagoas, Sergipe, Bahia and Abrolhos Marine National Park. Shell description Dorsal (left) and ventral (right) views of a shell of Voluta ebraea A shell of Voluta ebraea at the Houston Museum of Natural Science The shell length of this species may reach and exceed 200 mm, up to 220 mm, although lengths from 100 mm to 150 mm are more common. Voluta ebraea has a somewhat robust and solid shell, with a slightly elongate contour. It is colored cream externally, with a complex series of darker-reddish brown markings and lines that are said to resemble Hebraic figures. The interior of the shell can vary in color from pale to strong orange. The protoconch is rounded, and presents two whorls. The shell as a whole has seven slightly convex whorls. Those whorls (including the body whorl) are ornamented by several posteriorly-oriented sharp spines. The outer lip is thick, and the aperture is relatively long and narrow. As is the case in other volutes, the columella presents an array of strong oblique columellar folds (also known as plicae, 9 to 11 of them in this species), which are more conspicuous anteriorly.The corneous, claw-like operculum partially covers the shell aperture. Sexual dimorphism can be observed in the shells of this species: the shells of the males tend to be more elongate with a smoother outer surface, whereas the shells of the females are generally wider and more nodulose. The angle of the spire also differs between males and females. Anatomy The Hebrew volute has a pale ivory colored body, ornamented by numerous irregular and intertwined thin dark-red to brown colored lines, and several small spots of the same color along the sides of the foot. Some of the most distinct external features are its very large foot, and a long siphon. This species presents a Steoglossan type radula, composed of a single row of rachidian or central teeth. Each one of these teeth exhibits several smaller acute denticles or cusps. The radula is considered to be similar, though larger than that of the music volute, a similar but distinct species. Ecology Much is yet to be revealed about the ecology of V. ebraea, as studies on that subject are fairly recent and/or rather scarce. Habitat The Hebrew volute dwells in sandy bottoms, among coral and rocks, and usually shows a preference for sandy substrata. It may be found from shallow water to depths around 40‚Äì70 m and is commonly taken by shrimp trawlers. Life cycle Like other members of the clade Neogastropoda, Voluta ebraea is dioecious, which means each individual organism belonging to this species is distinctly male or female. It is also sexually dimorphic, which means there is a difference in form between individuals of different sex within this species. Feeding habits As is the case in several other volutids, the Hebrew volute is carnivorous and predatory. It is known to feed on the cardiid bivalve mollusk Trachycardium muricatum in the wild, whereas in captivity it has been reported to feed on the sea snails Stramonita haemastoma (a muricid carnivorous gastropod) and Tegula viridula (a top snail). Biological interactions The Hebrew volute is known to be a prey of the Bocon toadfish, Anphichthys cryptocentrus. Human use The flesh of Voluta ebraea is edible, and it is locally collected for food in many areas. Its shell is also considered a popular and beautiful decorative object, and is sold as souvenir in local markets and craft stores in several regions of Brazil. Conservation Though little is known about the conservation status of this species, it is believed that both overfishing and overexploitation are exeting a negative effect on natural populations. The Hebrew volute may occur in shallow water, which tends to facilitate its harvesting by the locals. Thus it is currently not observed in many areas in which it was known to be numerous before. It is not uncommon for Hebrew volutes to be accidentally caught in bottom gill fishing nets and traps set by commercial fishing boats. The imposex phenomenon has been observed in the Voluta ebraea. The development of masculine sexual organs in the females exposed to organic tin compounds, such as tributyltin (TBT), may have several negative consequences for entire populations of this species, from sterilization of individuals to the complete extinction of those populations. Such compounds are biocide and antifouling agents, commonly mixed in paints to prevent marine encrustations on boats and ships. Therefore, it is not uncommon for high concentrations of such compounds to be present in the sea water near shipyards and docking areas, consequently exposing the nearby marine life to its deleterious effects.

On May 10, 2013, the AIDS Healthcare Foundation (AHF) submitted 70,000 signatures to qualify a City of Los Angeles ballot measure, the \\"City of Los Angeles Public Health Protection Act,\\" on creating a separate Los Angeles City Public Health Department to be placed on the June 2014 ballot. AHF claims that the Department of Public Health has fallen short in managing several public health issues, including tuberculosis and syphilis, accusing it of having a corrupt, bloated and inefficient bureaucracy. However, the Los Angeles City Council has opposed this proposal, as Los Angeles City has contracted for public health services with the County since 1964, as part of a consolidation effort to reduce duplication and improve efficiency of services, and the City's desire to transfer financial responsibility for public health services to the County tax base. The city is considering a lawsuit over the validity of the AHF- backed ballot initiative, as it does not have the necessary funds or expertise to effectively enforce public health laws. The annual costs of operating an independent public health department would be roughly $261 million. On September 17, 2013, the County Board of Supervisors also voted unanimously to oppose that ballot measure. AHF is a longtime County contractor with a strained relationship to the County--an audit in August 2012 found that AHF had overbilled the Department of Public Health by more than $1.7 million. On January 13, 2015, the Board of Supervisors by unanimous decision approved the concept of integrating all health departments: Department of Health Services (DHS), Mental Health (DMH), and Public Health (DPH) to create a unified health agency (Health Agency). It was later motioned by Micheal D. Antonovich in August 11, 2015. The cities of Long Beach and Pasadena have their own public health departments, while the City of Vernon has a health department.

He specialized in period-piece drama and is particularly remembered for a string of hit British television shows, including Within These Walls, Lillie, We'll Meet Again and Edward the Seventh, as well as for his acting, most specifically as Dr. Nick Williams on British television's first medical soap opera, Emergency - Ward 10 in 1960‚Äì62. Early years A native of the town of Larkhall in South Lanarkshire, Butler was born into a well-educated family, with his parents working as teachers. At the age of 18, as World War II came to an end, he enrolled at the University of St Andrews, but ultimately abandoned his studies before attaining a degree, upon becoming interested in acting with the university drama society. He subsequently trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art and began his performing career in West End revues. In 1956, at the age of 29, he played a prison officer in Joan Littlewood's Theatre Workshop production of Brendan Behan's The Quare Fellow. Career highlights In 1959, he married actress Norma Ronald and, by the early 1960s, was supplementing his acting career with scriptwriting. Following a 1966 divorce, his 1969 marriage to Mary McPhail lasted for the remainder of his life and produced two daughters. By 1971, he had mostly given up acting and began to devote all of his energies to turning out teleplays. One of his first successes in the historical genre was 1972's The Strauss Family followed by many other productions, including The Duchess of Duke Street in 1976‚Äì77, 1978's Disraeli, starring Ian McShane and his 1986 Primetime Emmy Award-winning Lord Mountbatten: The Last Viceroy with Nicol Williamson in the title role. Circumstances also permitted an occasional return to acting, as in his own teleplays of the 1974‚Äì78 prison television series Within These Walls, in some episodes of which he played the penal institution chaplain, Rev. Henry Prentice. During this time, he was nominated for an Academy Award for his historical screenplay of 1976's Voyage of the Damned, depicting the 1939 attempt by 937 Jews to escape the looming Holocaust via a ship traveling from Hitler's Germany to Havana, but denied permission to disembark in Cuba or in the United States. Death Butler died in London at the age of 78. He is buried in the section of modern graves in the north-east quadrant of the eastern half of Highgate Cemetery in north London.

He fought in many battles under Napoleon Bonaparte in Italy and Egypt. In one celebrated battle, he rallied his troops to defend the key Monte Negino redoubt against the Austrians. He saw limited service during the Napoleonic Wars. His surname can be found among the names inscribed under the Arc de Triomphe. Early career Born on 16 March 1759 in Saint- Fortunat-sur-Eyrieux in Ard√®che department, Rampon joined the French royal army in 1775. By the outbreak of the French Revolution he attained the rank of sergeant-major. In 1792, he was promoted to sous-lieutenant and fought against the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia. Posted to the Army of the Eastern Pyrenees, he was appointed chef de brigade (colonel) and fought in the War of the Pyrenees. Taken prisoner by the Spanish near Port-Vendres in December 1793, he remained incarcerated until October 1795.Chandler, p 358. Chandler says West Pyrenees. However Port-Vendres is in the East Pyrenees. Italian campaign Rampon Defending Monte-Legino In November 1795, Rampon was named commander of what soon became the 32nd Demi-Brigade. During the Montenotte Campaign he gained fame by his gallant defense of Monte Negino (or Legino) on 11 April 1796, where his soldiers repelled the attacks of a superior Austrian force. He rallied his men by making them swear an oath to \\"conquer or die\\".Boycott- Brown, p 211 The next day, he led his demi-brigade at the Battle of Montenotte, and later in the week he fought at the Second Battle of Dego. For his actions, General Bonaparte appointed him a brevet general of brigade. While in Andr√© Mass√©na's division, Rampon played a major role at the battles of Lonato and Castiglione in August. On another occasion, he took care to protect local villagers from marauding French soldiers, according to one account.Boycott-Brown, p 414 On 4 September he led the 32nd demi-brigade at the Battle of Rovereto.Boycott-Brown, p 425 On 15 September he fought in the action of La Favorita-San Giorgio during the Siege of Mantua. He performed \\"particularly well at Arcola where his men repelled a counterattack.\\"Chandler, p 358 He also led his demi-brigade at the Battle of Rivoli on 14 January 1797 and in the clash at La Favorita two days later. He was described by Louis Desaix as, \\"square figure ... not a thief, big, leans backward; very dark skin\\".Boycott-Brown, p 187 Egyptian campaign After fighting in Switzerland under Guillaume Brune in 1798, where he Forced the crossing of G√ºmmenen, he joined Bonaparte's Egyptian expedition. During this episode, he fought at the Battle of the Pyramids, the Siege of El Arish, the Siege of Jaffa, the Battle of Mount Tabor and the Siege of Acre. After the latter action, he assumed command of the division when its commander Louis Bon was killed. After Bonaparte abandoned the army, Rampon participated in the Battle of Heliopolis in March 1800. During the Battle of Alexandria on 21 March 1801, he led the French center.Smith, p 195 He returned to France in 1801, having been named a general of division in 1800. In 1802 he took a seat in the Senate and retired from the army. Empire and Restoration During the Napoleonic Wars, Emperor Napoleon placed Rampon in several positions of trust. He became a Count of the Empire in 1808 and commanded the Camp of Boulogne in 1809. In 1814 he held the fortress of Gorinchem (Gorkum) in the present-day Netherlands until 7 February, when he was compelled to surrender to the Prussians. Rampon rallied to Napoleon during the Hundred Days and thereafter the Bourbons held him in ill-favor until 1819 when his noble title was restored. He died on 2 March 1842 in Paris. The name RAMPON is engraved on Column 24 of the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. Rampon's son, Joachim Rampon (1805‚Äì1883), was a Deputy of Ard√®che during the July Monarchy and again in the French Third Republic, and then was a Senator of Ard√®che from 1876 until his death.

Inequalities and quantifiers are specifically disallowed. Sentential logic is the subset of first-order logic involving only algebraic sentences. The notion is very close to the notion of algebraic structure, which, arguably, may be just a synonym. Saying that a theory is algebraic is a stronger condition than saying it is elementary. Informal interpretation An algebraic theory consists of a collection of n-ary functional terms with additional rules (axioms). E.g. a group theory is an algebraic theory because it has three functional terms: a binary operation a * b, a nullary operation 1 (neutral element), and a unary operation x ‚Üí x‚àí1 with the rules of associativity, neutrality and inversion respectively. This is opposed to geometric theory which involves partial functions (or binary relationships) or existential quantors - see e.g. Euclidean geometry where the existence of points or lines is postulated. Category-based model-theoretical interpretation An Algebraic Theory T is a category whose objects are natural numbers 0, 1, 2,..., and which, for each n, has an n-tuple of morphisms: proji: n ‚Üí 1, i = 1,..., n This allows interpreting n as a cartesian product of n copies of 1. Example. Let's define an algebraic theory T taking hom(n, m) to be m-tuples of polynomials of n free variables X1,..., Xn with integer coefficients and with substitution as composition. In this case proji is the same as Xi. This theory T is called the theory of commutative rings. In an algebraic theory, any morphism n ‚Üí m can be described as m morphisms of signature n ‚Üí 1. These latter morphisms are called n-ary operations of the theory. If E is a category with finite Cartesian products, the full subcategory Alg(T, E) of the category of functors [T, E] consisting of those functors that preserve finite products is called the category of T-models or T-algebras. Note that for the case of operation 2 ‚Üí 1, the appropriate algebra A will define a morphism A(2) ‚âà A(1)√óA(1) ‚Üí A(1) See also *Algebraic sentence *Algebraic definition References * Lawvere, F.

He is currently playing for Churchill Brothers in the l-League as a left back Early career Born in Namakkal, Tamil Nadu, Mohanraj started Playing for Sports Authority of India in Chennai. He went for the under-16 and under-19 state selections, and didn't get selected for either. After that, he went for a trial at the Tata Football Academy, and didn't get through. But Carlton Chapman, the assistant coach there, told me he had a good left foot, and sent him for a trial at (I-League 2nd Division side) HAL, Bangalore. Finally, the HAL coach Krishnaji Rao gave him chance. Career After his stint at HAL, Mohanraj signed for Mohun Bagan at the beginning of the 2007-08 season. He enjoyed a very successful stint with Mohun Bagan where he won the Indian Federation Cup in 2008, followed up with the ONGC Super Cup and runner-up in the I-League in 2009. In 2012-13 with Pune F.C. he picked up yet another I-League runner up medal. Sporting Goa On 5 February 2014 Mohanraj signed for Sporting Clube de Goa on loan from Mumbai Tigers as their club was disbanded. He made his debut for Sporting Goa on 16 February 2014 in the I-League match against Pune F.C. at the Balewadi Sports Complex in which he started and played the whole match and also earned a yellow card in the 66th minute as Sporting Goa drew the match 1-1. International Mohanraj won the 2009 Nehru Cup with the Indian national team. He was also the captain of the India U-18 team that toured Germany and played against the Academy teams of VfB Stuttgart, FC Augsburg and Munich 1860, before participating in the 2008 AFC U-19 Championship tournament in Iran.

The genus was revised in 2018, with several new species added and some older species transferred to other genera, based on phylogenetic analyses. Taxonomy Erast Parmasto first described Dentocorticium in 1968 as a section of Laeticorticium, a defunct genus that was classified in the Corticiaceae. Dentocorticium was raised to generic status by M.J. Larsen and Robert Lee Gilbertson in 1974. Dendrodontia and Fuscocerrena were shown to be synonyms of Dentocorticium in a 2018 phylogenetic analyses. Dendrodontia was circumscribed by Kurt Hjortstam and Leif Ryvarden in 1980 to contain Dendrodontia bicolor (formerly Grandinia bicolor). Fuscocerrena was created by Ryvarden in 1982 to house Fuscocerrena portoricensis. Description The fruit bodies of Dentocorticium fungi are annual. They range from effused (crust-like), to effused-reflexed (crust-like with edges curling to form rudimentary caps) or cap-like, with a texture ranging from membranous, to leathery or soft corky. The spore-bearing surface are often tooth-like, bumpy with tubercles, or spiny. In some species the surface is poroid, daedaleoid (maze-like), and sometimes develops irregular ridges or hyphal pegs (bundles of hyphae that project from the hymenium). Dentocorticium has a dimitic or trimitic hyphal system. The generative hyphae have clamp connections. There are brown skeletal hyphae present in the subiculum (a layer of loosely intertwined hyphae forming a mat covering the substrate and underlying the fruit body), spine trama, and hyphal pegs. Microbinding hyphae may be present in the subiculum or the substrate. Dendrohyphidia are present. Cylindrical to somewhat spindle shaped cystidia may be present. Basidia are club shaped and have four sterigmata. Spores are ellipsoid to cylindrical in shape, translucent with thin walls, and smooth. They do not react with Melzer's reagent, and acyanophilous (having cell walls that do not readily absorb cotton blue stain).

The type collection was made in Cuba by Murrill and Franklin Sumner Earle, for whom the genus is named. Murrill also noted the presence of the fungus in Nicaragua, Mexico, and Jamaica. In a study of species described by Murrill, Leif Ryvarden determined that Earliella cubensis was the same species as Trametes scabrosus (Pers.) Cunn., a possibility mentioned by Murrill himself. Ryvarden and Robert Lee Gilbertson transferred Trametes scabrosus to Earliella in 1985. Chemistry The chemical constituents and antioxidant activity of the essential oil extracted from fruit bodies of Earliella scabrosa has been characterized. The chemical 3-methyl-2-butanol is present in the highest concentration, accounting for nearly 50%. This is followed by diacetone alcohol (10.57%), azulene (8.01%), toluene (4.36%), palmitic acid (4.01%) and linoleic acid (4.01%). Pathogenicity In 2017, a case report documented E. scabrosa as the cause of cutaneous fungal septic emboli in an immunocompromised child, which, despite antifungal treatment, later resulted in death. A year later, the fungus was determined to be the cause of a human eye infection (endophthalmitis) resulting after intraocular lens implantation. It was successfully treated with a vitrectomy.

A year later, he raised Epithele to generic status, maintaining the same two species. Hypochnus dussii later became the type of the genus Tubulicium. Daisy Boquiren revised the genus in 1971, accepting 13 species. Later contributions to the systematics of Epithele were made by J√ºlich (1976), Boidin and Lanquetin (1983), Boidin and Gilles (2000), and Hjortstam and Ryvarden (2005). In 2013, Karen Nakasone emended the generic concept to include Epithele bambusae (a species without hyphal pegs), and accepted 17 species.

The fruit bodies of Favolus species are fleshy with radially arranged pores on the underside of the cap that are angular and deeply pitted, somewhat resembling a honeycomb. Taxonomy The naturalist Palisot de Beauvois was the first to use the name Favolus in his 1805 work Flore d'Oware et de Benin, en Afrique. His type species was Favolus hirtus, a fungus first collected in Africa. Elias Fries used the name as a subgenus of Polyporus in 1821. Seven years later, Fries used the name Favolus for a different genus, with the tropical species F. brasiliensis as the type. Fries's concept of the genus was later accepted as it was published in one of the sanctioning works of mycology. Favolus hirtus is now called Trametes hirta, and Beauvois' concept of Favolus is placed in synonymy with Trametes. The generic name Favolus is derived from the Latin favus meaning honeycomb. Until relatively recently, many works have considered Favolus to be synonymous with Polyporus. Based on molecular phylogenetic analysis, Favolus species were shown to form two genera, and several species were transferred to Neofavolus in 2013. This reorganization was accepted and verified in later studies. Description The fruit bodies of Favolus fungi are annual, and have a stipe that is situated laterally to substipitate or almost sessile. The shape of the cap is spatulate (with a broad, rounded end), reniform (kidney shaped) to dimidiate (divided into two equal parts). The texture of the cap surface can be smooth, or may have minute hairs, sometimes with stiff tufts or spiny scales toward the base. Often featuring radial grooves, the cap surface is variable in colour. The stipe is cylindrical to flattened or reduced. The internal tissue of the fruit body (context) has a tough and fleshy to leathery texture when fresh, becoming leathery to corky or brittle when dried. Pores on the underside of the cap are large to small, and either regular or radially elongated. Favolus has a dimitic hyphal system, containing both generative and skeletal-binding hyphae. The generative hyphae are either with or without clamp connections. Skeletal- binding hyphae are usually dominating, arboriform (tree-like), and hyaline. The cap cuticle is not differentiated into distinct layers; if present it comprises non-agglutinated parallel hyphae that are up to 50 Œºm thick. Basidia are club-shaped, four-sterigmate. Spores are cylindrical to navicular (boat- shaped), thin-walled, smooth, and hyaline. Favolus differs from Neofavolus in the features of the cap surface. In Neofavolus, it is smooth to scaly, with a cutis made of hyaline to brown, parallel and agglutinated, generative hyphae that are distinct from contextual hyphae, which mainly comprise non- agglutinated skeletal-binding hyphae.

Compared to other emissions reductions instruments Emissions reduction currency is different from an emissions credit. The value of an emissions credit is determined by a national cap in emissions and the degree to which the credit confers a right to pollute. The ultimate value of an emissions credit is realised when it is surrendered to avoid punitive fines for emitting. Emissions reduction currency is also different from a voluntary carbon offset where a payment is made, typically to fund alternative energy or reforestation, the emissions reduction or sequestration resulting from which is used to reduce or cancel the payers responsibility for emissions produced by themselves. The value of an offset is in its being held by the purchaser and applies only for the period and purpose against which the offset applies. An emissions reduction currency, by contrast, is purely an incentive for behaviour change by individuals or groups. As such the currency creates an additional economic benefit for emissions reductions separate from the cost imposed by national emissions caps or the voluntary cost assumed by the purchaser of a voluntary offset. Emissions reduction currencies are not exchangeable within national cap and trade systems and as such do not confer any right to pollute. While no emissions reduction currency system has achieved the scale of emissions crediting systems, there are a number of small scale schemes in operation or being set up. In addition there are a number of approaches that are currently hypothetical being promoted by a number of organisations, academic institutions and think tanks. Emissions reduction currency systems conceptually are inclusive of carbon currency systems but also include schemes that reduce emissions in incidental ways such as through waste reduction and community education. History The idea of a global wealth system based on alternative energy production was first suggested by Buckminster Fuller in his 1969 book Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth. This idea was piloted by Garry Davis who distributed these \\"kilowatt dollars\\" at the 1992 Earth Summit held in Rio de Janeiro.YouTube interview with Garry Davis by Kiwah.orgGarry Davis Blog 'Isn't it time for world money' Edgar Kempers and Rob Van Hilton launched the Kiwah (kilowatt hour) currency at the Copenhagen Climate Summit in 2009. Categories of emissions reduction currency systems Emission reduction currency systems can be designated as belonging to one or more of five categories: Carbon title schemes Introduction of sustainable land management practices in tropical rainforest and other high carbon environments can lead to abatement of emissions from land clearing that might have otherwise occurred or from additional CO2 sequestration. Land purchased and managed for these purposes can be used to create an independently tradeable carbon right,Western Australian Carbon Rights Act of 2003 which may or may not be recognised within an emissions credit scheme. For example, aboveground biomass resulting from land use changes can currently be converted to recognised emissions credits under the Kyoto Protocol Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). Increases in soil carbon for reasons other than reforestation either through changes to land management practices or through the burial of biochar are currently not included in emissions credit systems such as the CDM. These certificates of legal title can be traded as a form of currency independently of their use as an offset, yielding additional economic benefits. This use is suggested by The Carbon Currency Foundation.Official Carbon Currency Foundation Website Another emissions reduction currency system proposed on this basis is the ECO, a project of The Next Nature Lab which is an initiative of Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands.The Next Nature Lab website Promotional discount schemes An emissions reduction currency system based on promotional discount is one where participants are rewarded for reducing their emissions by gaining points which can be redeemed for discounts from businesses advertising in the system. RecycleBankOfficial Recyclebank Website is one such scheme where participants weigh recycled materials in specially designed disposal bins that identify themselves to scales embedded in garbage collection vehicles. Recyclebank is also funded by municipal governments that purchase and operate the required equipment, allowing RecycleBank to operate as a private for profit company. Another similar scheme is GreenopolisGoodCleanTech.Com review of Greenopolis that works through social media websites such as Facebook. EarthAid uses specialised software that publishes utility bills from companies in an online format that participants can share with family and friends. Reduced energy consumption earns reward points that can be redeemed for prizes at businesses in the EarthAid rewards network.The Washington Post ‚Äì Eureka! Get Paid For Paring Down Home Energy Costs Allocation schemes An emissions currency reduction system based on allocation is one where all individual participants are awarded an equal allotment of emissions currency. Participants then trade goods and services with one another to obtain enough of the currency to cover their actual emissions. The objective of an allocation scheme is to obtain social parity between participants with regards to emissions reductions. Technically an emissions crediting scheme, an allocation scheme is classed as an emissions reduction currency system because the trading of the currency between individuals as parity is sought can create a secondary market of trading where the currency can act as a medium of exchange, and this trading creates an additional positive economic value associated with emissions reductions. The Global Resource BankGlobal Resource Bank Official Website is one organisation advocating such a global allocation scheme. Emissions rationing schemes Otherwise known as personal carbon trading, an emissions reduction currency system based on rationing presumes a standard ration of emissions allowable for an average citizen that incrementally decreases over time. Participants using less than the rationed amount receive a currency that can be traded with those emitting more than the allowed amount. All participants pledge to in total remain below the average with a net positive value in the scheme. Carbon Rationing Action Groups (CRAGs), started in the United Kingdom, has a global network of groups. CRAG participants use a standard average for the country as a basis for the rationed amount. Participants emitting at above rationed levels must pay those below it in national currency.The Ecologist ‚Äì A rational approach to carbon Norfolk Island, Australia is in the process of implementing an island-wide voluntary personal carbon trading scheme designed by Southern Cross University Professor Garry Egger,Sydney Morning Herald ‚Äì Islanders lead world on personal carbon test scheme Community based currency schemes A community based emissions reduction currency scheme is a C4 type local currency in which local currency issues are backed by the emissions reductions of the schemes members. The local currency, when accepted for trade by other members or local businesses, thereby rewards participants for their efforts at global warming prevention. These currencies may have various degrees of convertibility into carbon saved, renewable energy, or national currency. The Edogawatt is a form of emissions reduction currency used in Edogawa, Tokyo that is an initiative of the local J≈çdo Shinsh≈´ Jukou-in temple. In this scheme, the temple and devotees purchase solar panels and sell the excess power to the Tokyo Electric Power Company. The temple then takes the difference between the price paid by the Tokyo Electric Power Company and the price paid for natural energy in Germany and sells Green Power Certificates as a fund raiser for the temple. Purchasers of the Green Power Certificates are given 30 Edogawatt bills per certificate. \\"These are currently being used among people ... as a certificate of debt or obligation in exchange for baby- sitting, carrying loads, translating and other small jobs. They have provided an incentive for creation of a mutual aid society within the community and we would like to make them a tool for deepening interpersonal relationships and trust.\\" http://www.qoin.org/what-we-do/past-projects/kyoto4all/ Kyoto4All was a 2006 report written by Peter van Luttervelt, David Beatty and Edgar Kampers for the Dutch Ministry of Environment (then named VROM). The study described a series of monetary models to connect citizens-consumers to the climate change targets of the post-Kyoto period. The Maia Maia Emissions Reduction Currency System,International database of complementary currencies is a scheme developed in Western Australia. The system currency is known as a \\"boya\\", named after the indigenous Nyungar people's word for rock trading tokens used by them. Each boya is based on 10 kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalent global warming prevention which is equates to a $100 tonne CO2-e Social Cost of Carbon, which approximates a middle estimate from peer reviewed studies. The first issue of boya occurred on 30 January 2011 in Fremantle, Western Australia at an event hosted by the International Permaculture Service and the Gaia Foundation of Western Australia. Other issuers of Boya include the University of Vermont and in Australia, primary schools, non-profit organisations, and a neighbourhood association. The Liquidity Network,Liquidity Network Home Page an initiative of the Foundation for the Economics of Sustainability is proposing to introduce a community run emissions reduction currency in the County of Kilkenny in Ireland. The proposal is currently before council for consideration. Monetizing schemes A monetised emissions reduction currency is backed by the financial value of emissions credits or certified under a regulatory scheme or other financial products derived from them. These credits can be converted into fiat currency through transferring ownership of the underlying assets such as selling the emission credits into cap and trade markets. The Ven is a virtual currency issued by the Hub Culture social media network. The value of Ven is determined on the financial markets from a basket of currencies and commodities. The Ven may be categorised as an emissions reduction currency because carbon futures are included as one of the commodities used to value the currency. Carbon MannaOfficial Carbon Manna home page is a proposed scheme that will use proceeds from pre-selling credits from bundled emissions reduction projects to reimburse users directly or to enroll them in the successful mobile phone currency M-PESA being used in developing countries to reduce monetary transaction costs and hedge against currency fluctuations.Richard Seireeni Transforming the African Brand Through Sustainability ‚Äì Huffington Post Notes Category:Local currencies Category:Emissions reduction Category:Carbon finance Category:Economics and climate change Category:Environmental issues in Ireland ","title":"Emissions Reduction Currency System"},{"id":"24497807","title":"Wade Bowen"},{"id":"24497808","text":"Flabellophora is a genus of poroid fungi in the family Steccherinaceae.

This fungus is found fruiting singly or in groups on trunks or logs of hardwood trees, primarily oaks. The fruit body consists of a mass of small overlapping hoof-shaped caps arising from a common core. It is initially dull yellow-brown with tan petal-shaped margins, aging to dark brown. Taxonomy Globifomes was circumscribed by William Alphonso Murrill in 1904. The type was originally described as Boletus graveolens by Lewis David de Schweinitz in 1822. The type specimen was collected in Georgia and sent to Schweinitz for identification. The generic name combines the Latin word globus (\\"globe\\") with the name Fomes. Polyporus botryoides, described by Joseph-Henri L√©veill√© in 1846, was deemed by Murrill to be \\"probably not distinct\\" from Globifomes graveolens. The common name of the fungus, sweet knot, refers to the odor of some specimens of freshly cut tissue. Most fruit bodies, however, do not have this odor. Description Murrill described the characteristics of the genus as follows: \\"Hymenophore large, woody, encrusted, perennial, epixylous, compound; context ferruginous, pinky, tubes cylindrical, thick-walled, stratose; spores ovoid, smooth, ferruginous.\\" The fruit bodies of the fungus measure between wide and tall, and consist of small overlapping stipe-less caps originating from a central core. Caps have a leathery to rigid texture with a slightly velvety surface and radial wrinkles on the edges. Adjacent caps can be fused together and have petal-shaped projecting margins. Initially dull yellow-brown with a tan margin, they mature to become dark brown to greyish black in age. The fibrous and tough flesh is yellowish brown and up to thick.

Taxonomy The genus was circumscribed by mycologists Leif Ryvarden and Jorge Eduardo Wright in 1982, with Poria setulosa as the type species. They included an additional three species: the new combinations M. cavernulosa and M. hexagonoides, and the new species M. mexicana. Six new species of Megasporoporia were introduced by Chinese mycologists between 2004 and 2009 as a result of taxonomic studies of wood-inhabiting fungi in China. Molecular analysis showed that Megasporoporia nested within the \\"core polyporoid clade\\", a grouping of polypore fungi roughly equivalent to a more narrowed but still broad concept of the family Polyporaceae. Later analysis that included the more recently described Chinese species revealed that the genus was not monophyletic and could be divided into four clades. In 2013, two of these monophyletic clades were segregated from Megasporoporia and circumscribed as the new genera Megasporia and Megasporoporiella. Description Megasporoporia have crust-like fruit bodies, with large or small pores, and spores that are typically greater than 10 Œºm long. It features a dimitic hyphal system with clamped generative hyphae and dextrinoid skeletal hyphae. Characters that can be absent or present in the hymenium include small rhomboid or bipyramidic crystals, dendrohyphidia, hyphal pegs, and cystidioles or cystidia.

Taxonomy The genus was circumscribed by American mycologist William Murrill in 1905 with Microporellus dealbatus as the type species. Murrill intended to the genus to contain polypores with stipes. The generic concept was emended in 1985 by David and Rachenberg. After examining the type of Polyporus dealbatus, they reported for the first time the presence of dextrinoid skeletal hyphae and incrusted cystidia, a unique combination of characters in the Polyporales. Ryvarden and Dhandha had previously (1975) used this combination of characters to erect Cystostiptoporus, a genus that had Cystostiptoporus indicus as the type species. Due to the Principle of Priority, the earlier-published name is preferred, and Cystostiptoporus was therefore sunk into synonymy with Microporellus. In 1987, E. J. H. Corner further emended Microporellus by including species without cystidia, and also some trimitic species. Decock broadened the genus in 2001 by including two species with stipes: Microporellus celtis, and M. peninsularis.

ITFC is located on the Eastern border of Bwindi Impenetrable National Park in Ruhija village, Rubanda district of South Western Uganda. The long history of ITFC's work in ecological and sociological research has established it as a leading post graduate research institution and field station. With over 200 publications about conservation in the region and a wealth of national, regional and international partners and donors - ITFC's work in conservation has influenced the direction of conservation the world over, and more specifically in the Albertine Rift ecoregion. The Bwindi Impenetrable Forest is a tropical moist broadleaf forest in the Afromontane Albertine Rift montane forests ecoregion. It is primarily protected within the Bwindi Impenetrable National Park (BINP). History The IFPC became the ITFC - a semi autonomous academic unit of Mbarara University of Science and Technology in 1991, the same year in which Bwindi Impenetrable National Park was established. The Establishment of Bwindi Impenetrable and Mgahinga National Parks was after a successful recommendation by ITFC (then IFCP), Mbarara University of Science and Technology and other conservation partners after they expressed the danger that Bwindi and Mgahinga Forests faced if not quickly gazetted as National parks.  Work  As part of their work, ITFC carries out ecological research and monitoring on the state on both plants and animals all around the Albertine Rift ecoregion. This puts makes places such as Mount Rwenzori National Park, Queen Elizabeth National Park, Semuliki National Park, Mount Elgon National Park, Mgahinga National National Park, Bwindi Impenetrable National Park and the Greater Virunga Landscape.

Species in the cosmopolitan genus cause white rot. There are about 10 species in the genus, with newest member described from European Russia in 2007. Pachykytospora species have fruit bodies that are resupinate (growing flat on the substrate surface), with light brown tubes. They are characterized by their uneven, ellipsoid spores, and the Polyporus-like skeletal-binding hyphae. Taxonomy The genus was circumscribed by Czech mycologists Franti≈°ek Kotlaba and Zdenek Pouzar in 1963. The type species, P. tuberculosa, was originally described as Boletus tuberculosus by Augustin Pyramus de Candolle in 1815. Species originally described as a member of Pachykytospora but later transferred to other genera include: Pachykytospora major G.Y.Zheng & Z.S.Bi 1989 (now in Megasporoporia); Pachykytospora nanospora A.David & Rajchenb. 1992, Pachykytospora nepalensis T.Hatt. 2002, and Pachykytospora thindii Natarajan & Koland. 1993 (now Haploporus). Norwegian mycologist and polypore authority Leif Ryvarden suggested that due to its large, grooved spores, Pachykytospora was in a phylogenetically isolated position in the Polyporaceae, although it shows some affinity to the genus Megasporoporia, with which it shares the same hyphal system and type of rot. Unlike Pachykytospora, however, Megasporoporia has smooth spores. In a 2007 publication, Zmitrovich and colleagues suggested that there are nine species in the genus (and they described a tenth, P. wasseri); in 1994, Ryvarden and Robert Lee Gilbertson indicated five species. Yu-Cheng Dai and colleagues treated Pachykytospora as a synonym of Haploporus in a 2002 publication. Description The fruit bodies of Pachykytospora species are resupinate- adnate or have stunted, nodule-like caps. The pore surface is white, pallid, brown or has pinkish-violet tinges, while the pores measure 2 to 5 per millimetre. The hyphal system is di- to trimitic: the generative hyphae are hyaline (translucent), thin-walled, and have clamp connections, while the skeletal hyphae are pale yellow, thick-walled, and have a lumen ranging from transparent to nearly solid; the binding hyphae are often indistinct, ranging from hyaline to pale yellow. Depending on the species, cystidia can be either present or absent. The spores are ellipsoid and thick-walled, with indistinct, irregular bumps and low longitudinal ridges; the surface ornamentations become conspicuous after the spores have been stained in methyl blue. Mature spores are sometimes smooth and hyaline. Habitat and distribution The type species, P. tuberculosa, is known from Europe, Asia, and North America. In Europe it fruits almost exclusively on oak. P. papyracea is widespread, known in Asia, Africa, Oceania, and North and South America.

This genus is distinguished from most other polypores because of its brilliant red-orange color. Modern mycology recognizes five distinct species of Pycnoporus: the type P. cinnabarinus, P. coccineus, P. palibini, P. puniceus, and P. sanguineus. These species are divided somewhat by morphology, biogeography, and DNA sequence. Biogeography Pycnoporus cinnabarinus occurs in cooler, temperate regions within Europe and North America. Pycnoporus sanguineus occurs in warmer, tropical regions within South America, North America, and Asia. Pycnoporus coccineus occurs in temperate areas of Australia and New Zealand. Pycnoporus puniceus is a rare species found in Southeastern Asia and Malaysia. Description Fruiting bodies are typically sessile, corky, slightly tomentose to glaborose. on fallen hardwood logs, but can be on coniferous trees as well. These fungi live in diverse habitats, but are typically located near a source of water. Pileus length x width x height (thickness) can range from 1‚Äì9 cm (l) x 1‚Äì7 cm (w) x 0.2‚Äì2 cm (h). Colors range on the scale of paprika red to flame orange but almost always are vibrant. Spores are white, oblong, somewhat pointed, 2-3 x 4-6 um. KOH reactions yield a dark brown to black color for most specimens but can bleach out (turn white) the pileus of a few specimens over longer time periods. Specimens typically retain their strong red-orange color for long periods of time, especially when dried and stored properly. Yet some turn dingy brown or gray and fade in color over time. The red colour of Pycnoporus species comes from pigments that are chemically related to phenoxazinone, including cinnabarin, tramesanguin and cinnabarinic acid. Identification In order to identify the species of Pycnoporus a few characteristics must be carefully observed. To distinguish between P. cinnabarinus and P. sanguineus one must note the thickness of the pileus. P. cinnabarinus has a fruiting body ranging from 5 to 15 mm in thickness while P. sanguineus ranges from 1‚Äì5 mm thick. Additionally P. sanguineus typically contains darker red pigments that do not easily fade. Several collected specimens of P. cinnabarinus show pale orange pigmentation in areas with direct sunlight. Lastly, P. cinnabarinus contains larger pores per mm (2-4) than P. sanguineus with 4-6 pores per mm. Uses Pycnoporus fungi are used heavily for industry because of their ability to produce powerful lignolytic enzymes that break down lignin and tough polysaccharides in wood and paper. The major enzyme that differentiates this fungus from other white rotters is laccase and under the correct conditions Pycnoporus can produce large concentrations of this enzyme. Pycnoporus fungi also produce copper and iron metalloenzymes that are involved in the chemical transformation of aromatic compounds found in plant cell walls. Other uses have been reported in Australia. Aboriginal peoples have used it for curing mouth sores, ulcers, and teething of infants. References Eggert, C, Temp, U, & Eriksson, K-EL.

The genus has a cosmopolitan distribution, although most species are found in the Northern Hemisphere. Skeletocutis causes a white rot in a diverse array of woody substrates. Their fruit bodies grow as a crust on the surface of the decaying wood. Sometimes the edges of the crust are turned outward to form rudimentary bracket-like caps. Skeletocutis is primarily distinguished from similar genera of wood-rotting fungi by microscopic features, especially by the sausage-shaped to ellipsoid spores, and spiny crystals covering certain hyphae in the pore tissue. The genus was circumscribed by Czech mycologists Franti≈°ek Kotlaba and Zdenek Pouzar in 1958, with Skeletocutis amorpha as the type species. Description=Macroscopic characteristics The fruit bodies of Skeletocutis are annual to perennial. They are resupinate (crust-like) to pileate (that is, with a cap). When caps are present, their colour is typically white, cream-pink, or lilac, although the fruit body tends to discolour somewhat when dry. The pores are small and round to irregular in shape. Many Skeletocutis species have a zone of dense cartilaginous tissue above the tube layer; this zone has a gelatinous texture when fresh. Bisected fruit body of S. nivea Pores of S. nivea Microscopic characteristics The hyphal system is dimitic to trimitic. The generative hyphae have clamps, and are often encrusted with spiny crystals, particularly in the dissepiments (tissue that is found between the pores). The skeletal hyphae are hyaline (translucent). Although typically only the generative hyphae of Skeletocutis fungi have incrustations, three species are reported to have apical incrustations on the skeletal hyphae: S. alutacea and S. percandida, and S. novae-zelandiae. ≈¢ura and colleagues suggest that the \\"taxonomy of these species is poorly worked-out.\\" Cystidia are absent in the hymenium, but cystidioles are present in most species. The spores are smooth, hyaline, and have an allantoid (sausage-like) to cylindric to ellipsoid shape. They do not have reaction with Melzer's reagent. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club shaped to barrel shaped and four spored, measuring 8‚Äì15 by 4‚Äì5 Œºm. Although the majority of Skeletocutis species have thin-walled spores, six species have spores with thick walls: S. alutacea, S. bambusicola, S. borealis, S. krawtzewii, S. percandida, and S. perennis. Ecology, habitat, and distribution Skeletocutis causes a white rot in a diverse array of woody substrates. Although the majority of species are found growing on the dead wood of various conifer and hardwood genera, some are known to grow on the dead fruit bodies of other polypores. For example, S. brevispora feeds on Phellinidium ferrugineofuscum, while S. chrysella eats Phellinus chrysoloma. The tropical Chinese species S. bambusicola grows on dead bamboo. S. percandida has been reported growing on exotic bamboos cultivated in France. In the Daxing'anling forest areas of northeastern China, S. ochroalba has been found growing on charred wood after forest fires, and may be a pioneer species for this substrate. In the southern part of the Russian Far East, S. odora is common in aspen forests. It is often found fruiting in association with other fungi, including Fomitopsis rosea, Crustoderma dryinum, Leptoporus mollis, and Phlebia centrifuga. S. odora favours large logs more than in diameter. This species is part of the community of fungal successors of decaying wood. A Finnish study found that it fruited most frequently in the third stage (medium decay) of wood decomposition of Norway spruce (Picea abies). In this stage, which occurs about 20‚Äì40 years after the death of the plant, the decay penetrates more than into the wood, while the core is still hard. S. carneogrisea and S. kuehneri are successor species that grow on the dead fruit bodies of the polypores Trichaptum abietinum and T. fuscoviolaceum. Skeletocutis has a cosmopolitan distribution, although most species are found in the Northern Hemisphere. Leif Ryvarden considered 22 species to occur in Europe in his 2014 work Poroid Fungi of Europe. Viacheslav Spirin reported 13 species in Russia in 2005. Twenty-two species have been recorded in China. Conservation S. odora is used as an indicator species in Estonia In Europe, Skeletocutis odora appears on the national Red Lists of threatened fungi in 5 countries and is one of 33 species of fungi proposed for international conservation under the Bern Convention. Its natural habitat is threatened by deforestation and loss of thick fallen logs typical of old-growth forests. In Estonia, S. odora and S. stellae are used as indicator species to help assess whether forest stands should be protected. They are associated with old-growth forest areas that have been minimally impacted by humans. In contrast, S. lilacina is found exclusively in selectively logged forests, while S. stellae inhabits both types of forest. The Argentinian species S. nothofagi, known only from Tierra del Fuego, has been proposed for inclusion in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species due to its highly restricted distribution and rare occurrence. Taxonomy The genus was circumscribed by Czech mycologists Franti≈°ek Kotl√°ba and Zdenƒõk Pouzar in 1958 with Skeletocutis amorpha (originally described as Polyporus amorphus by Elias Magnus Fries in 1815) as the type and only species. The generic name Skeletocutis is derived from the Ancient Greek word (skeleto, \\"dried up\\") and the Latin word cutis (\\"skin\\"). Other genera that feature encrustations in the hyphae of the dissepiment edges include Tyromyces and Piloporia. Molecular analyses has shown the close phylogenetic relationship between Skeletocutis and Tyromyces. These two genera group together in the tyromyces clade, on a branch lying outside of the core polyporoid clade, or in the \\"residual polypore clade\\" of Tom≈°ovsk√Ω and colleagues. Sidera lenis was formerly placed in Skeletocutis. Two species formerly placed in Skeletocutis, S. lenis (P.Karst.) Niemel√§ and S. vulgaris (Fr.) Niemel√§ & Y.C.Dai, were transferred to the new genus Sidera based on molecular analysis. Although Sidera is placed in a different order (Hymenochaetales), it shares many characteristic features with Skeletocutis, including whitish resupinate basidiocarps (in many species) with small pores, and narrow skeletal hyphae. In contrast with Skeletocutis, however, the hyphae in Sidera comprising the dissepiment edge are smooth or covered with only a few faceted crystal clusters. In 1963, Polish mycologist Stanislaw Domanski circumscribed the genus Incrustoporia (typified by Poria stellae) to contain several polypores featuring encrusted hyphae at the dissepiments. In 1969, John Ericksson and √Öke Strid added Polyporus semipileatus Peck to the genus. The taxonomic placement of this fungus had long before confused mycologists, who had given it a variety of scientific names. Three years before, Pouzar created the genus Leptotrimitus to contain this fungus, as he was not satisfied with other possible generic placements. The main distinguishing feature of Leptotrimitus was the presence of trimitic hyphae. In 1971, Marinus Anton Donk reunited Incrustoporia and Leptotrimitus, as he did not believe that the trimitic character alone was a sufficient criterion for delineating a new genus when so many other characters were identical. Jean Keller studied the ultrastructure of the encrusted hyphae of Incrustoporia species using electron microscopy. He determined that, with the exception of I. carneola, the crystallizations were similar in all instances. The crystals of I. carneola were in the shape of small regular parallelepipeds‚Äîclearly distinct from the spiny crystal structures characteristic of the rest of Incrustoporia. Because Skeletocutis was published earlier, it had priority over the generic name Incrustoporia, and so Keller transferred the remaining six species to Skeletocutis in 1989: S. alutacea, S. nivea, S. percandida, S. stellae, S. subincarnata, and S. tschulymica. Incrustoporia carneola was transferred to Junghuhnia as J. carneola. The inclusion of several monomitic species by Alix David in 1982 (S. azorica, S. jelicii, S. portcrosensis and S. subsphaerospora) was controversial, as mycologists Leif Ryvarden and Robert Lee Gilbertson (1993, 1994) and Annarosa Bernicchia (2005) transferred them to or accepted them in Ceriporiopsis. Later molecular work demonstrated that two of these monomitic species, S. azorica and S. subsphaerospora, are phylogenetically much closer to the Skeletocutis-Tyromyces sensu stricto group of species than to Ceriporiopsis, and the current concept of Skeletocutis includes monomitic species. S. jelicii and S. portcrosensis remain in Ceriporiopsis. Species A 2008 estimate placed around 30 species in the widely distributed genus. , the nomenclatural database Index Fungorum accepts 41 species. *Skeletocutis africana Ryvarden & P.Roberts (2006) ‚Äì Cameroon *Skeletocutis albocremea A.David (1982) ‚Äì Russia *Skeletocutis alutacea (J.Lowe) Jean Keller (1979) ‚Äì United States, Europe *Skeletocutis amorpha (Fr.)

It was circumscribed by mycologist Petter Karsten in 1881. The type species is the widely distributed Tyromyces chioneus, commonly known as the white cheese polypore. The phylogenetic position of Tyromyces within the Polyporales is uncertain, but it appears that it does not belong to the \\"core polyporoid clade\\". Tyromyces is polyphyletic as it is currently circumscribed, and has been described as \\"a dumping place for monomitic white-rot species with thin- walled spores.\\" The genus name is derived from the Ancient Greek words (\\"cheese\\") and (fungus\\"). Description Tyromyces fungi have fruit bodies that are pileate (i.e., with a cap) to resupinate (crust-like). Fruit bodies are short-lived, and often mostly white, but turning a darker colour when dry. The colour of the pore surface is usually white to cream, sometime with greenish tinges. Like the cap surface, it darkens when dry. Microscopic characteristics The hyphal system is either monomitic (meaning the fungus contains only generative hyphae, which in this case have clamps) or dimitic, containing both generative and skeletal hyphae. The spores are smooth, thin- walled, and hyaline (translucent). They are allantoid (long with rounded ends) to ovoid (egg-shaped), and are non-reactive with Melzer's reagent. There are no cystidia in the hymenium, although there may be cystidioles (sterile cells of about the same diameter and shape as an immature basidium that protrude beyond the surface of the hymenium). Tyromyces are white rot fungi with a cosmopolitan distribution.

It is about two British escaped prisoners of war. It was shot at Pinewood Studios and on location in Marseille. The film's sets were designed by the art director Arthur Lawson. Plot In 1943, Dave (Stephen Boyd), an officer, and Jim (Tony Wright), escape from separate prison camps and are paired together by the underground. They are taken to Marseille by a fishing boat captain to wait for the right opportunity to try for Britain. While they wait, local woman Lise (Anna Gaylor) falls in love with Dave. He is attracted to her, but is engaged. Meanwhile, Emile Blanchard (Eugene Deckers) refers those desperate to leave France tohis associate Dr. Martout (James Robertson Justice), unaware Martout is a serial killer who grows rich from his crimes. This character parallels the real life French poisoner Marcel Petiot. Jewish undertaker Schlip and ex-Vichy official Bourdin (George Coulouris) become his latest victims. Given an ultimatum by his displeased superiors to do something about the French Resistance, the German military commander of the city decides to evacuate and demolish the crime-infested Old Quarter, where Dave and Jim are hiding, with only two hours warning. Dave wants to wait for the fishing captain, but Jim chooses to try Dr. Martout. When the captain does show up, Dave goes to fetch Jim, barely saving him from becoming Martout's 100th victim. Martout escapes in his car, but in his haste, crashes and is killed. With buildings blowing up right and left, the pair make their way, with Lise's help, to the boat and freedom.

Background  Robert Fleming Heizer was born July 13, 1915, in Denver, Colorado, to Ott and Martha Madden Heizer. He spent most of his childhood in Lovelock, Nevada, where his lifelong interest in the cultures of Native Americans began. As a young boy, he collected artifacts in and around where he lived, but he did not participate his first archaeological excavation until he was at Sacramento Junior College (1932‚Äì34).Robert Heizer Obituary Wiley Online Library When he graduated from Lovelock High School (1932) in a class of eleven students, he was not eligible to attend the University of California at Berkeley, as some of the requirements were not offered at Lovelock High. He was registering for classes at Sacramento Junior College when a faculty member heard that he was interested in archaeology and took him out of line to meet the president of the college, Jeremiah Beverley Lilliard, who was similarly interested; subsequently he became a prot√©g√© of Lilliard. After two years, Heizer went on to the University of California at Berkeley, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts with high honors in 1936. There was little interest in local archaeology at Berkeley then, and Heizer dug with the only graduate student at the time, Waldo Wedel.Kroeber, C. B., 1981. A dedication to the memory of Robert F.

While in the graduate program, Heizer worked with many professors including Alfred L. Kroeber, who had Heizer write his dissertation on Aboriginal Whaling in the Old and New World. In 1941, Heizer received his doctorate from Berkeley. In 1940, he married Nancy Elizabeth Jenkins, and they had three children‚Äîtwo sons, Stephen and Michael, and one daughter, Sydney. Robert and Nancy Heizer were divorced in 1975.Hester, T. (1996). Robert Fleming Heizer. Washington, D.C.: The National Academic Press  Career  Upon receiving his doctorate, Heizer taught for a year at the University of Oregon. During World War II, he worked at the Kaiser Shipyards in Richmond, California, as a marine pipefitter. After the war, he taught at the University of California, Los Angeles (1945‚Äì46) and then began his thirty-year career at Berkeley, going from Assistant Professor (1946) to Associate Professor (1948) and finally full Professor (1952). While teaching, he worked closely with both undergraduate and graduate students, who helped inspire A Guide to Field Methods in Archaeology (1949) and The Archaeologists at Work (1959). He also organized and directed the University of California Archaeological Survey (1948‚Äì60), which conducted many major excavations and various field studies around the state and produced 75 volumes in its Reports series. Dr. Heizer retired from teaching in 1979 and died later that year at the age of 64.  Awards and honors  Heizer received many awards and honors during his lifetime. He received an Honorary Doctorate of Sciences from the University of Nevada in 1965; two Guggenheim fellowships in 1963 and 1973; a year as a fellow in the Center for Advanced Study in Behavioral Science from 1972‚Äì1973; an award for having distinguished scholarly contributions from the Southwestern Anthropological Association in 1976; awarded the Henry R. Wagner Medal of the California Historical Society in 1977; and was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1973.  Key excavations and studies  Heizer's excavations included the Cooper-Molera Adobe Project in Monterey County, California, from 1971 to 1978. He did work in the Sacramento Valley from 1936 to 1939,Baumhoff, M. A., 1980. Robert Fleming Heizer, 1915‚Äì1979. Am.

Robert Heizer. onlinenevadaencylclopedia. from http://www.onlinenevada.org/robert_heizer His primary area of study was the Great Basin of the United States. Heizer decided early on that more was going on in the west 10,000 years ago, although in the 1950s and 1960s it was widely accepted that there was not much going on. He had never traveled out of the United States until he went to Tabasco to work at the La Venta site in 1955, examining the Olmec society with his colleague Philip Drucker, who had contacted him about his findings there.Drucker, P, Heizer, R, & Squier, R. (1959). Excavations at La Venta. Washington: US Government Print. There they found large stone monuments in the shapes of faces and statues. They also uncovered a shrine that was buried on purpose because of its sacredness. One of his lesser known, but highly important studies was the continuation of the work of C. Hart Merriam. Merriam spent a great deal of his life doing fieldwork on the Native Americans of California. After his death Merriam's family donated all his materials to the Anthropology Department at the University of California at Berkeley where Heizer and Kroeber took over the studies. Heizer had over 1,000 of Merriam's articles published so others could learn from them.  Research emphases  Most of Heizer's research was in prehistoric and historic Native American peoples of the western United States, particularly in Nevada and California. He conducted numerous analyses of preserved materials from the caves in Nevada, particularly fossil feces or coprolites, which helped determine what the human diet consisted of and dietary changes over time. Heizer also helped lay the groundwork for scientific applications in archaeology. This research included involvement with radiocarbon dating during the 1950s, and trace elements analysis of obsidian artifacts in the 1960s and 1970s. He was never one to focus exclusively on theory, but was interested in discovering basic facts and methods in research areas of interest. Heizer also used neuron activation analysis to determine trace elements on samples from his excavations in Mexico, one of the applications of this method. He then used the same idea when he tested petroglyphs.  Selected works  Heizer wrote hundreds of different works in the course of his lifetime. He wrote 415 papers, reprinted papers, reports and prefaces. He also wrote 30 books (authored and co-authors) and 53 different book reviews, and was a part of 2 films.

She is former director, former president, and founder of First Nations Development Institute and the founder of First Peoples Worldwide. Personal life Born in Akron, Ohio, to a Swedish American father and a Cherokee mother, Adamson grew up in Akron and spent summers with her Cherokee grandmother in Lumberton, North Carolina where she learned about the history and culture of her Cherokee people. She holds a master of science in economic development from the Southern New Hampshire University in Manchester, New Hampshire, where she teaches a graduate course on indigenous economics.  Career  After graduating from Firestone High School in Akron in 1967, she studied philosophy at the University of Akron and then took courses in law and economics at Piedmont College in Georgia. Adamson left college in 1970 to work on western reservations to help end the practice of removing Native American children from their homes and placing them in government or missionary-ran boarding schools in the hope of destroying their connections to their native languages and cultures. From 1972-1976, she was a member of the board of directors of Denver, Colorado's Coalition of Indian-Controlled School Boards, where she worked toward synthesizing and facilitating policy reform at the national level. The Coalition worked to \\"wrest control of Indian schools from the U.S. government and Christian religious groups that had been running them for more than 100 years.\\" Her work contributed to the Indian Self- Determination Act of 1975. In 1982, she became founder and president of First Nations Development Institute in Falmouth, Virginia to promote economic development by founding commercial enterprises on reservations. In 1986, she served as an adviser on rural development for the United Nations (UN) during their Decade of Women. She became the adviser for the UN's International Labor Organization International Indigenous Rights from 1988-1989. She has also served on the board of directors for the National Center for Enterprise Development and the Council on Foundations. In 1992, she became an adviser for the Catholic Conference's Campaign for Human Development. She has also served on the President's Council on Sustainable Development/Sustainable Communities Task Force. Her work led to the first microloan fund in the United States associated with a reservation, the first tribal investment model. This was a national movement for reservation land reform, and legislation on federal trust responsibility for Native Americans. Adamson's international work created the Lumba Aboriginal Community Foundation in Australia. It enabled the Sans Tribe to secure its traditional homelands in Botswana, Namibia, and southern Africa. She launched a strategy (that includes Alcoa, Texaco, Rio Tinto, Merck, Ford, and Occidental) with investment criteria that protect the rights of indigenous peoples and has been adopted by a mutual fund, an index fund, and investment advisors. She established a scholarship program for native people at the Yale School of Organization and Management and at the Carlson School of Management at the University of Minnesota. She convinced the World Bank to create the First Global Indigenous Peoples' Facility Fund to make small building grants. She was appointed by the Obama administration to serve a three year term on the U.S. Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative Advisory Committee to increase the transparency in the reporting on natural resource extraction. Adamson serves on the board of directors for the Calvert Social Investment Fund and the Calvert Small Cap Fund which are known for socially-responsible investing and co-founded a fund there. She is on the board and trustee for Tom's of Maine, Inc. She is on the boards of Corporation for Enterprise Development, The Bay Foundation, Josephine Bay Paul and C. Michael Paul Foundation, The Bridgespan Group, and First Voice International. She is a founding member of Native Americans in Philanthropy, Funders Who Fund Native Americans, and International Funders for Indigenous Peoples.. She has been a member of the editorial boards of Indian Country Today, Native Americas, and for Akwe:kon Journal. In 2016, the Standing Rock Sioux asked her to develop and coordinate an investor engagement strategy to pressure the builders of the Dakota Access Pipeline to change the planned route which was to pass near a river used for potable water near their reservation. She was able to secure statements from ESG investors with over $1.7 trillion in invested assets requesting that the banks funding the pipeline support the tribe's request to reroute the pipeline. Her efforts helped to embolden activists who forced shareholder resolutions to require that the environmental and social risks were more adequately disclosed (including at Marathon Petroleum, Enbridge, and Wells Fargo) and encouraged over 500 NGOs to pressure the banks financing the pipeline with three major banks pulling out of the syndication (BNP Paribas, DNB ASA, and ING) and ten other banks supported strengthening the Equator Principles.  Awards  In 1996, she was awarded the Robert W. Scrivner Award from the Council on Foundations for grant-making and the National Center for American Indian Enterprise Development's Jay Silverheels Award.

A History of Taxidermy. Art, science and bad taste (Morris, 2006) states that Van Ingen factory processed more than 43,000 tiger and leopard trophies in less than 90 years of operation. Van Ingen & Van Ingen taxidermy today are still found throughout the world in the form of head mounts, full mounts, flat animal rugs, and rug mounts with heads attached. The Van Ingen & Van Ingen firm was established by Eugene Van Ingen in the 1890s. His sons later ran the business until it closed in 1999. Van Ingen & Van Ingen served the highest in international nobility as well as the Maharajas of India, preserving their \\"shikar\\" hunting trophies in the most lifelike poses and in the utmost beauty, with attention to detail like no other in their time of operation.  Work  Close up of a snarling Van Ingen mount Van Ingen & Van Ingen's work was synonymous with quality and fine workmanship, constructing moulds, mannikins, glass eyes, tongues, teeth and even whiskers for jobs of all different sizes of big cat skins and hunting trophies that customers would bring to them. The \\"snarling\\" open mouth expression of finished big cat mounts was one of the Van Ingen's trademark qualities, a feature rigorously studied and made possible only by special head moulds which had specific built grooves on the nose area. Glass eyes were imported from Germany, hand painted individually by a factory workman each pair painted specifically for each individual taxidermy mount. Van Ingen constructed mannikins and moulds of all sizes meaning they could produce mounts of consistent quality for a variety of poses from head mounts to full mount life size pieces. Heyday Van Ingen tiger heads mounted on the wall of Indian palace In its heyday, Van Ingen & Van Ingen was one of the biggest taxidermy businesses in the world. Factory records reveal that Van Ingen & Van Ingen would process over 400 Tigers per year from the 1930s till the late 1960s limited to not only tigers and leopards, but also bears, lions, other species of cat, ungulates and even African game. Film stars, viceroys and senior military men were numbered among their customers, but at least a third of the taxidermy was done for the Indian nobility. The firm employed over 150 workers time to support the high workload, with jobs from cleaning, skinning, salting, pickling, mounting, carpentry, finishing, decorating and offloading. Work began to decline in the late 1960s, following the banning of hunting in India.They preserve wild spoils year after year The firm remained lightly active until 1999 when it closed.They preserve wild spoils year after year Legacy In 2004, Pat Morris travelled to Mysore to document what would remain left of the taxidermy firm meeting the last survivor of business management Joubert Van Ingen. Morris would go on to author and publish the book Van Ingen & Van Ingen - Artists in Taxidermy in 2006 Taxidermy Law Library which outlines the quality, complexity and history of what once was one of the world's largest taxidermy firms. The book also contains actual photocopies of the factory workbook records of the Van Ingen work flow. The Van Ingen & Van Ingen book, Van Ingen & Van Ingen, Artists in Taxidermy, Mysore (Morris, 2006) is considered the main source for information of the firm with studies of original factory records that reveal the abundance of wild leopards and tigers once found in the wild.Library Catalog One of the three brothers De Wet Van Ingen (now deceased), still holds the record for the largest Mahseer ever caught on a rod.Flyfish Library A cast of the original fish caught was donated to the Regional Museum of Natural History (RMNH), Siddarthanagar, Mysore by Joubert.

It stars Joanne Samuel, Lou Brown, Bunney Brooke, John Bluthal, and Vincent Ball. Plot The story starts in sequence with 16-year- old Alison Findlay (Samuel) and her two friends playing a seemingly innocent ouija board game. Upon contacting a spirit, who is later revealed to be Alison's dead father (she never knew her actual parents), the girls discover that Alison is in danger. The spirit then possesses one of the girls and warns her not to return home for her 19th birthday. The girl is immediately killed after a bookcase collapses onto her. Less than three years later, Alison and her boyfriend Pete (Brown) return to her homeplace to celebrate her 19th birthday with her Uncle Dean (Bluthal) and Aunt Jenny (Brooke), who raised her after her parents died in car crash when she was just a newborn baby. Her homecoming is not quite what she expected as she makes a strange discovery in their backwoods and has disturbing nightmares. Even stranger is her Grandmother Thorn, whom she meets for the first time. Her relatives soon take a disliking to Pete, and attempt to prevent him from seeing Alison. However, he is persistent and simply will not stop coming to see their niece. In a desperate attempt to keep Alison away from him, they regularly drug her and she becomes \\"ill\\". In order to get Pete to believe them, they have a false doctor (Ball) come over and pretend to diagnose her. He prescribes that Alison stay at home and avoid leaving. Later that night, Pete breaks into their house and tries to rescue her. However, as they are leaving, the doctor and her Uncle Dean subdue and drug the both of them. As a side effect to the drug, they are able to convince Alison into lying and informing the police that Pete - as a pestering, frightening ex-boyfriend - will not leave her alone. He is then arrested and charged with attempted kidnapping and breaking-and-entering. Yet, the next morning he is released on bail. After researching several newspaper clippings and briefly studying Celtic occult, he determines that her aunt and uncle (along with the doctor and other relatives) plan to forcibly sacrifice Alison for a demonic female spirit called \\"Mirna.\\" Mirna's soul is in manifested in Grandmother Thorn's body. As Ms. Thorn is aging quickly and Alison is in her youth, they plan to switch bodies between the two. It is revealed that this ritual has been practised for over 200 years. When it is time for Alison's birthday party, Pete desperately tries to save Alison. But upon arrival, he discovers that he is too late and that Mirna has possessed Alison. Mirna shoots Pete, killing him instantly. When Alison wakes up, she realizes what has transpired and the films ends with her screaming. Production The film was shot in Sydney and other New South Wales locations, over three weeks in January and February 1979. Release Alison's Birthday was released in Australia on 26 December 1981. Critical response Meaghan Morris of the Sydney Morning Herald deemed the film a \\"letdown\\" overall, but conceded that it was \\"well made, mildly entertaining, and occasionally funny.\\" The film was nominated for various Australian film awards, including one for \\"Best Performance For a Male\\" for Vincent Ball.

History History of this site starts with the Lord Buddha‚Äôs 3rd arrival to the island but legends on the area called Badulla begins from 19th ‚Äì 18th century BC. Some names of places in the area, e.g. Seetha Eliya, Seetha Kotuwa, Ravana Ella, etc., refers to the Seetha and Ravana - the main characters in the Indian episode titled Ramayana. So it is believed that said war had taken place in this locale, where was the capital of then powerful king named Ravana who ruled the island. Buddhists believe that this site has been visited by Gautama Buddha, and it is regarded as one of the Solosmasthana, the 16 sacred places in the country. On the 8th year after attaining the Enlightenment, the Lord Buddha made His 3rd visit to Kelaniya on the invitation by a king of Naga people named Maniakkitha. During this visit, a local chieftain named Indaka invited Lord Buddha to visit his place in Badulla. At the end of sermons made by Lord Buddha there, Indaka had wanted something to worship in memory of Lord Buddha's visit. The Lord Buddha is said to have given him a few of His hairs and a few drops of sweat that turned into pearls (mukthaka). Indaka had enshrined these sacred hair and pearls in a stupa, believed to be the stupa here. Indaka, the chieftain of then Deva people is now regarded as a deity, reigning the Namunukula mauntain range and Muthiyangana Raja Maha Viharaya. This site is not cited in well known historical chronicles such as Mahavamsa, Bodhi Vamsa or DhƒÅtuvansa but mentioned in the Samantapasadika which is older than the former documentaries. It states, \\"The Lord Buddha visited this island thrice. Third time He arrived with 500 monks. Being entered into Nirodha Samapatti (attainment of ceasing of feeling and perception) He stayed here...\\", turning the site into most sacred religious one for the Buddhists. This is also regarded as one of 32 Buddhist religious sites wherein the saplings bred from Anuradhapura Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi have been planted. Refurbishment King Devanampiya Tissa (307 - 266 BC) further developed the original stupa and turned the site into a temple complex. Thereafter King Jettha Tissa I (266 - 276 AD), King Dhatusena (459-477 AD), King Vijayabahu I (1055‚Äì1110 AD) and King Parakramabahu I (1153‚Äì1186 AD) have renovated the stupa. Attractions Thorana Shrine room of the temple The site consists of (a) Thorana (b) Makara thorana (c) Main image house (d) Center image house (e) Sath sathi viharaya (f) Statue of deity Indaka (g) Statue of Maithri bodhisathva (h) Stupa and (i) Bo trees (Bodhi). Thorana This thorana (pandol) is at the entrance to the temple. It has six levels and Makara (dragon) is visible on the second level. Makara thorana This has been built at the entrance to the main image house. Image houses There are two image houses ‚Äì main and center. Ancient appearance of these two buildings has been vanished due to refurbishment in 1960's and 1970's. The stupa The present stupa was constructed with the height of and diameter of on the ruins on ancient one in 1956. Bo trees There are four Bo trees (Bodhi) remaining in the temple. One is named after Maliyadeva Thera, a disciple believed to be the last one who had attained the state of Arhant in Sri Lanka. Another Bo tree is called Ananda bodiya as it had been brought from Jetavana monestey in Sravasti in India wherein a Bo tree with the same name still remains. Another Bo tree which remains in this site has been considered as it originated from Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi and planted by King Devanampiya Tissa.

History The aria was written in late 1766 in Salzburg when Mozart was ten years old. The author of the lyrics is unknown. It was the first composition by Mozart since his family's return to Salzburg, and was first performed on 21 December 1766 as part of an entertainment marking the anniversary of the consecration of Archbishop Sigismund von Schrattenbach. Instrumentation The work is scored for two oboes, two bassoons, two horns, two trumpets, timpani, strings and tenor. Libretto Or che il dover m'astringe, In scelte e corte rime Grato mostrarmi a qual onor sublime, Di cui ci ricolmaste, o prence eccelso, Ne' miei pensieri immerso Ricerco un buon concetto. Rumino colla mente, Penso, ripenso, e poi non trovo niente. Febo e le Muse in mio soccorso imploro; Compariscono tutte a me dinanzi, Confuse in volto e colle cetre infrante. D'un simile scompiglio Le chiedo la ragion, tacer le miro, E dopo mille al pi√π sospir cocenti Una cos√¨ ripose: Riverendo pastor, t'accheta, e in simil Giorno non obbligarci a dire il nostro Scorno; sulle rive della Salza ogni Nostro potere, ogni saper fu crine Da quella luce onde il suo prence √® cinto. Tali e contanti sono Di Sigismondo i merti, Che i nostri ingegni incerti, Non sanno qual riverendo cor. Se la piet√† si canta; La giustizia non cede, Ch'ogni virt√π, riverendo, Siede in trono suo cor. Now that duty compels me, in select and brief verses, to show my gratitude for that eminent honour with which you have overwhelmed us, august prince, I delve deep into my thoughts for an inspiration. I rack my brains, consider, reflect, but find nothing I involve Phoebus and the muses to my aid; they all appear before me shamefaced and with broken lyres. I ask the reason for such confusion, and see them mute; and after a thousand or so burning sighs one thus replies: Revered shepard, be appeased, and on such a day do not force us to confess our shame. On the banks of the Salzach, all our power, all our wisdom was as nothing to that light with which your prince is surrounded. So great and so many are Sigismund's merits that our paltry minds cannot know that illustrious heart. If this compassion is hymned, it is not at the expense of his justice, for every virtue, Excellency, is enthroned in your heart.

Li Yun's brief reign was ended when Zhu's subordinate Wang Xingyu rebelled and killed Zhu. Li Yun fled to the domain of the warlord Wang Chongrong, who executed him and presented his head to Emperor Xizong. Background It is not known when Li Yun was born. He was a great-grandson of Li Guang (ÊùéÂÉô) the Prince of Xiang, who was a son of Emperor Suzong, and his grandfather Li Xuan (ÊùéÂÆ£), at one point, was created the Prince of Yiwu.New Book of Tang, vol. 82. In 885, during the reign of Emperor Xizong, the powerful eunuch Tian Lingzi came under dispute with the military governor (Jiedushi) of Hezhong Circuit (Ê≤≥‰∏≠, headquartered in modern Yuncheng, Shanxi), Wang Chongrong, over Tian's attempts to take back control of the salt ponds in Hezhong Circuit for the imperial government, as well as the rudeness that Tian's adoptive son Tian Kuangyou (Áî∞Âå°Á•ê) displayed when being sent as an emissary to Hezhong. Tian Lingzi had Emperor Xizong issue an edict transferring Wang to Taining Circuit (Ê≥∞ÂØß, headquartered in modern Jining, Shandong). In anger, Wang refused, and allied himself with the ethnic Shatuo military governor Li Keyong of Hedong Circuit (Ê≤≥Êù±, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi). Tian reacted by aligning himself with Zhu Mei the military governor of Jingnan Circuit (ÈùúÈõ£, headquartered in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi) and Li Changfu the military governor of Fengxiang Circuit (È≥≥Áøî, headquartered in modern Baoji, Shaanxi). The imperial forces under Tian's control joined Zhu's and Li Changfu's troops in attacking Wang; Wang and Li Keyong fought back and, in a battle around the new year 886, defeated the Tian/Zhu/Li Changfu coalition forces. With Li Keyong's and Wang's forces approaching the capital Chang'an, Emperor Xizong and Tian initially fled to Li Changfu's headquarters Fengxiang, and then to Xingyuan (ËààÂÖÉ, in modern Hanzhong, Shaanxi). Meanwhile, Zhu and Li Changfu, fearing Li Keyong and Wang, also turned against Tian and Emperor Xizong, sending forces to try to seize Emperor Xizong, but were unable to.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 256. When Emperor Xizong fled Chang'an, Li Yun followed him to Fengxiang, but was unable to catch up with Emperor Xizong's further flight to Xingyuan. When he was at Zuntu Station (ÈÅµÂ°óÈ©õ, near Fengxiang), he was captured by Zhu's soldiers and taken back to Fengxiang. By this point, Zhu had become convinced that Tian was a bad influence over Emperor Xizong who could never be eliminated and that he would receive the support of the other warlords if he supported a new emperor, and he consulted with the chancellor Xiao Gou, who was also unable to catch up with Emperor Xizong's flight. Xiao opposed, but Zhu ignored his opposition and forced the imperial officials who were at Fengxiang to submit a petition supporting Li Yun to take over the throne. Li Yun initially, however, only accepted the title of regent. In addition to the imperial officials at Fengxiang, the military governor Gao Pian of Huainan Circuit (Ê∑ÆÂçó, headquartered in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu), Wang, and the senior official Cui Anqian (who was then at Hezhong) also submitted petitions supporting Li Yun. Zhu's forces escorted the imperial officials and Li Yun back to Chang'an, in anticipation of Li Yun's officially taking the throne. Li Keyong, however, refused Zhu's and Li Yun's overtures and continued to send petitions to Emperor Xizong at Xingyuan; Zhu's erstwhile ally Li Changfu, angry that he was shut out of the newly formed government, also submitted a petition of support to Emperor Xizong. Brief reign In winter 886, after the imperial officials further urged him to take the throne, Li Yun did so. He offered Emperor Xizong, in exile, the title of retired emperor (Taishang Huang). Meanwhile, though, by this point, Tian Lingzi had abandoned his powerful post as the commander of the Shence Armies (Á•ûÁ≠ñËªç) and sent himself to Xichuan Circuit (Ë•øÂ∑ù, headquartered in modern Chengdu, Sichuan) as its eunuch monitor of the army ‚Äî as his older brother, Chen Jingxuan, was Xichuan's military governor. Tian's successor Yang Fugong issued an announcement to the Guanzhong region (i.e., Chang'an's surroundings) that anyone who could execute Zhu Mei would be given Zhu's post as the military governor of Jingnan. Zhu's officer Wang Xingyu, enticed, and also in fear because he was unable to complete the mission that Zhu gave him ‚Äî capturing Xingyuan and seizing Emperor Xizong ‚Äî decided to act. He marched back to Chang'an, catching Zhu by surprise, and killed Zhu. The officials Pei Che and Zheng Changtu, whom Li Yun had commissioned as chancellors, escorted him to Hezhong. However, by this point, Wang had agreed to again submit to Emperor Xizong, and while he initially feigned to welcome Li Yun, he instead seized and beheaded Li Yun. He delivered Li Yun's head to Xingyuan to be presented to Emperor Xizong. Initially, Emperor Xizong was to hold a grand celebration over Li Yun's death, but on the advice of the ceremonial scholar Yin Yingsun (ÊÆ∑ÁõàÂ≠´), who pointed out that the death of an imperial clan member was not a good reason to celebrate, Emperor Xizong instead ordered Li Yun posthumously demoted to commoner rank and had the head buried.

It was known as The Normal Pennant in 1898 (a reference to the California State Normal School), The Quill in the 1920s and El Portal in the 1930s. The name Reed Magazine started in 1948 when the publication was known as The Reed. At that time, the magazine was put together by SJSU's literary society, Pegasus, with help from the Associated Student Body. There is some dispute about the origin of the journal's name, with some saying that it honors James F. Reed, a survivor of the Donner Party and prominent local citizen. Others say that name of Reed was derived from a quote by Blaise Pascal: > Man is but a reed, the most feeble thing in nature; but he is a thinking > reed.... All our dignity consists in thought. By it we elevate ourselves, > and not by space and time, which we can never fill. Let us make it our task, > then, to think well: here is the principle of morality.  Notable contributors  *Jacob M.

They are credited with stealing more than $100,000 in gold and over 100 horses, killing at least 19 people, and having outrun three posses and killed three lawmen. Republished with introduction and additional translation by Luis Leal as Life and Adventures of the Celebrated Bandit Joaquin Murrieta: His Exploits in the State of California, Arte Publico Press, 1999. The gang is believed to have killed up to 28 Chinese and 13 Whites. On May 11, 1853, Governor of California John Bigler signed a legislative act creating the \\"California State Rangers,\\" led by Captain Harry Love (a former Texas Ranger). Their mission was to capture the \\"Five Joaquins,\\" named above. The California Rangers were paid $150 a month and stood a chance to share a $5000 reward for the capture of Joaquin Murrieta. On July 25, 1853, a group of Rangers, led by Captain Love, encountered a band of armed Mexican men near Panoche Pass in San Benito County, 50 miles from Monterey. A confrontation took place, and two of the Mexicans were killed. One was claimed to be Murrieta, and the other was thought to be Three-Fingered Jack. A plaque (California Historical Landmark #344) near the intersection of State Routes 33 and 198 now marks the approximate site of Murrieta's headquarters in Arroyo de Cantua, where he was presumably and officially ruled by the State of California to have been killed. However that claim was soon disputed and has continued to be. However the result of that skirmish was that the gang was broken up, and its activities ended. Some of the members returned to Sonora, although many of the gang's members remained in California, some continuing their criminal carriers, many others became vaqueros on California ranches or followed other walks of life.  Members  Of the Joaquins named by the bill of the California state legislature, three were actual leaders in the gang, two others were only members. * Joaquin Murrieta, a Sonoran, born in Pueblo de Murrieta, Sonora, was the head of this group of bandit bands.Frank F.

Jesus Valenzuela was member of the gang not a leader. After he killed a fellow Mexican in a gold camp he promised his brothers he would return to Sonora but he spent the money they gave him for the trip and stayed in California, running with the band of Tres Dedos. A garbled form of his alias, Joaquin Ocomorenia became known to the State Legislature and was put on the list of the Five Joaquins. * Joaquin Valenzuela, born in Pueblo de Murrieta, cousin of Joaquin Murrieta and his brothers, stepbrothers and cousins.

Additionally he drove them south for the trade in horses from California to Sonora, along with his brother Teodoro Valenzuela whose own band took the droves from Joaquin near the Rancho Cucamonga then drove them over the Sonoran Desert for sale in Sonora. * Joaquin Botellier, according to the state of California listed as one of the Five Joaquins, actually Joaquin Botellas, a Sonoran, born near Real de los √Ålamos, came to Alta California before the Gold Rush. He mined with Joaquin Murrieta, in Murphy's New Diggins and took up Murrieta's cause against the American mob that lynched Murrieta's elder stepbrother Jesus Carrillo and whipped Joaquin, on the false accusation of the theft of a mule. Botellas became an active member of Joaquin's personal band of the Gang. * Joaquin Carrillo, born in Spain, as Joaquin Manuel Carrillo before his father moved to Ures, Sonora from Spain. He was the younger brother of Jesus Carrillo. At age five, he along with his older brother would acquire the Murrieta name after his widowed mother remarried the Sonoran Joaquin Murrieta of Pueblo de Murrieta, soon to be the father of the famous Joaquin. Both were older Carrillo stepbrothers of Joaquin Murrieta and his younger brothers. Joaquin Carrillo Murrieta came to California before 1848 and wrote his stepbrother, Joaquin to bring members of the family to California when gold was discovered. He rode with Joaquin Murrieta to avenge his brother Jesus' lynching by a mob at Murphy's New Diggins and occasionally at other times. He operated the Murrieta rancho in Ca√±ada Molina Vallejo with Joaquin Murrieta's brother-in- law Vincente Jesus F√©liz and both watched over Rosa F√©liz, Murrieta's wife who lived there following the attack on her and her husband Joaquin by American claim jumpers in their gold claim.

History The company, originally named Cincinnati Opera Association, gave its first performance, Flotow's Martha, on Sunday, June 27, 1920. During its early years, the company was under the direction of Ralph Lyford, an American composer and conductor whose single opera Castle Agrazant would receive its world premiere at Cincinnati Music Hall on April 29, 1926, following Lyford's departure from Cincinnati Opera in 1925.Hipsher (1927) p. 306 From 1956-1990 the company ran a singing competition known as the American Opera Auditions. Andrew Foldi as Dr. Dulcamara and Bruce Cooper as his assistant Cochise in Act 1, Scene 2 of Cincinnati Opera's 1968 \\"Wild West\\" production of L'elisir d'amore directed by James de Blasis. For most of its first fifty years, Cincinnati Opera's performances were held at the Cincinnati Zoo Pavilion. During that time, many prominent singers appeared in the company's productions including Pl√°cido Domingo, Beverly Sills, Norman Treigle, Sherrill Milnes, Montserrat Caball√©, Jan Peerce, Robert Merrill, Roberta Peters, Shirley Verrett, Lawrence Tibbett, Richard Tucker, Martina Arroyo, James Morris, Elinor Ross and Barbara Daniels. In 1972, Cincinnati Opera moved its performance base to Cincinnati Music Hall,Winternitz & Bellman, p. 190 a 3,417-seat theater listed as a National Historic Landmark by the U.S. Department of the Interior. In its 2016 and 2017 seasons, while Music Hall was being restored and renovated, Cincinnati Opera performed throughout the Aronoff Center for the Arts instead. The Opera returned to Cincinnati Music Hall for its 2018 season, and has performed there since. The Opera under James de Blasis James de Blasis became the company's Resident Stage Director in 1968. He then served as its General Director from 1973 to 1987. In 1988 he became its Artistic Director, a post which he held until 1996. Under his tenure, the company produced rare operas such as Franco Alfano's Risurrezione in 1983 and Weinberger's Schwanda the Bagpiper in 1986. It also added musicals to its repertory in an effort to broaden its audience base. One of the highlights of the de Blasis era was a new interpretation of Donizetti's L'elisir d'amore which changed the setting from the Basque region of Spain in the 1820s to the \\"Wild West\\" of late 19th century Texas. The production was filmed by PBS and nationally televised in 1968. The company under Nicholas Muni In 1996, the internationally-known stage director Nicholas Muni succeeded James de Blasis as Artistic Director of the company. Under his leadership Cincinnati Opera further enlarged its repertory with many company premieres outside the standard repertory including Jan√°ƒçek's Jen≈Øfa, Britten's The Turn of the Screw, Debussy's Pell√©as et M√©lisande, Bart√≥k's Bluebeard's Castle, Schoenberg's Erwartung, Heggie's Dead Man Walking, Strauss' Elektra, Poulenc's La Voix Humaine, Weill's The Seven Deadly Sins, Ullmann's The Emperor of Atlantis, and the U.S. premiere of Peter Bengtson's The Maids.Gelfand (1 October 2004) The company also performed its first mainstage commission, Richard Danielpour's Margaret Garner (co-commissioned with Michigan Opera Theatre and Opera Company of Philadelphia). The Cincinnati performances coincided with the opening of Cincinnati's National Underground Railroad Freedom Center and starred Denyce Graves in the title role. The company under Evans Mirageas In 2006, Evans Mirageas, an influential casting director and former head of Decca's Artists & Repertoire division, became Cincinnati Opera's new Artistic Director. Following his first season with the company, Opera News magazine listed him as one of the \\"25 Most Powerful Names in U.S. Opera\\".Driscoll and Kellow (August 2006) The 2008 Summer Festival, the first to be fully programmed by Mirageas, included the French version of Donizetti's Lucia di Lammermoor plus the company premiere of Daniel Cat√°n's Florencia en el Amazonas. The company's 2009 season featured four operas set in Spain: Le Nozze di Figaro, Don Carlo, Carmen, and the regional premiere of Osvaldo Golijov's Ainadamar. The 2010 season presented a 90th Anniversary Gala Concert, featuring, among others, guest hosts Ryan Seacrest and Sherrill Milnes and singers Maria Luigia Borsi, Angela Brown, Christine Brewer, Denyce Graves, and Richard Leech. Following in 2011 was John Adams's A Flowering Tree, while the 2012 season offered the company's first performances of Porgy and Bess and Piazzolla's Mar√≠a de Buenos Aires. In 2012 Mirageas announced an expansion of the company's season to \\"festival\\" format featuring grand opera performances in Music Hall; lectures, films, and recitals in Memorial Hall; outdoor concerts in Washington Park; and small- scale productions in the 750-seat Corbett Theater at the School for Creative and Performing Arts. Performances in the Corbett Theater have included Philip Glass's Galileo Galilei (2013) and Francesco Cavalli's 1651 opera La Calisto (2014), and the world premiere of Ricky Ian Gordon and William M. Hoffman's Morning Star. While Cincinnati Music Hall was closed for an extensive renovation, Cincinnati Opera's performances took place at the Aronoff Center for the Arts. The company's 2016 season featured the world premiere of Fellow Travelers by composer Gregory Spears and librettist Greg Pierce and a new production of Tosca by Robert Perdziola. Its 2017 season consisted of La Boh√®me, a company premiere of Frida by Robert Xavier Rodr√≠guez, a silent film- styled The Magic Flute, and a production of Missy Mazzoli's new opera Song from the Uproar. Cincinnati Opera moved back to Cincinnati Music Hall for its 2018 season, and performed Verdi's La Traviata, a new production of Wagner's The Flying Dutchman, the U.S. premiere of Another Brick in the Wall: The Opera, a new production of Monteverdi's L'incoronazione di Poppea, and a company premiere of Laura Kaminsky's As One, a coming-of-age opera about a transgender woman.  Opera Fusion: New Works  Opera Fusion: New Works (OF:NW) was developed in 2011 as a collaborative partnership between Cincinnati Opera and the University of Cincinnati College-Conservatory of Music (CCM). The organization is dedicated to fostering the development of new American operas, and has developed nine pieces to date through a rigorous residency and workshop process. This collaboration is jointly led by Marcus K√ºchle, Director of Artistic Operations at Cincinnati Opera, as well as Robin Guarino, the J. Ralph Corbett Distinguished Chair in Opera at CCM.

The ground-floor entrance is at right, and the twin domes are above the aviaries on the third floor of the structure. The Farnese Gardens (), or \\"Gardens of Farnese upon the Palatine\\", are a garden in Rome, central Italy, created in 1550 on the northern portion of Palatine Hill, by Cardinal Alessandro Farnese. They were the first private botanical gardens in Europe; the first botanical gardens of any kind in Europe were started by Italian universities in the mid-16th century, only a short time before. Alessandro Farnese was appointed Cardinal Deacon of the Roman Catholic Church in 1534 at the age of 14, by Paul III, his grandfather, who had been elected to the papacy two months previously. He is remembered for being an antiquarian who assembled the greatest collection of Roman sculpture assembled in private hands since antiquity, the famous Farnese Collection.Now mostly in Naples, after passing by inheritance to the Bourbon-Parma kings; it ranked with the papal collections in the Cortile del Belvedere, and the city's own collection housed at the Campidoglio. In 1550, when Farnese acquired a northern portion of Palatine hill (historically the oldest of Rome's seven hills) he had ruins from a Roman palace of Tiberius at the northwest end of the hill top filled in, and converted to a summer home. The site overlooks the Roman Forum and is near the Arch of Titus. The garden was divided into the classic style of quadrants with a well or a fountain at its centre, deriving from the design of the Roman peristilium palaces of the area, as re-created by the noted architect Vignola. History of Palatine Hill.History of the Farneses and the garden. The villa's design was first attributed to Michelangelo but later to Vignola and Rainaldi. The gardens were arranged in terraces. Steps from terrace to terrace ran past the Ninfeo della Piogga (a nymphaeum) to end in the Teatro del Fontanone. Aviaries were situated in the center Casina, which boasted frescoes. Walking paths at the base of the Domus Tiberiana included underground passages and ancient sculptures. Though little of the Farnese Gardens survives today, some remnant structures may be seen. Location of the Farnese family gardens, now known only as a remnant. The gardens became popular again in the 18th and 19th centuries as Grand Tour travelers visited Rome. From the name of these gardens is derived the name of the plant Acacia farnesiana and from its floral essence, the important biochemical farnesol.

It is headquartered in Barcelona Brief history of AELC History The organisation was formerly instituted on 31 October 1977, following a 1975 resolution at a congress of Catalan culture to form a professional association of Catalan writers, with the participation of more than 100 writers from all of the Catalan-speaking territories, that is to say, Catalonia, the Valencian area, the Balearic Islands, and as well with the written participation of another 100 writers who could not personally attend the ceremony. From 1977 to 1988, the AELC developed the representative functions of the literary vitality of the Catalan countries with the desire to articulate a program that would be an instrument of dialogue and relation with the new political powers that constituted what was known as the Spanish democratic transition. One of the primary objectives was to re-vitalize the idea of the Institute of Catalan Letters, an institution that had been active during the 1930s until the end of the Spanish Civil War. The AELC proposed the creation of an infrastructure that recognized the aspirations of its associates and defended their interests. In 1988 the autonomous government of the Generalitat of Catalonia decreed to finally restore the ILC. Since then the AELC has centered its activities primarily on aspects of the writer's union and its claims, while leaving questions of representation to the ILC. Activities The AELC divides its activities into two large blocks that revolve around two axes: professional activity and cultural activity, and it has three basic axes of operation: * To protect the professional, cultural, and intellectual interests of writers. In this context, we'd like to emphasize the important work realized by the AELC since 1988, the year in which the Generalitat of Catalonia made the Institute of Catalan Letters (ILC) a functioning entity. During this period (1977‚Äì1991, with the writer Guillem-Jordi Graells as Secretary) important judicial activity took place. Above all, the AELC participated in the elaboration of the Law of Intellectual Property. The AELC actively intervened in the administration of the Value Added Tax (VAT) and generally, in all that related to the fiscal concerns of the writer. We must not forget that up until that time the act of writing was not considered a professional activity but rather an exclusively vocational one. This intervention meant that one year later a landmark agreement was reached with the federation of publishers, in respect to both authors' as well as translators' contracts. In 1991 screenwriters' contracts were negotiated and established, with the agreement of Televisi√≥ de Catalunya (TVC). With these instruments, writers have become professionals of cultural production in Catalonia. * To Promote Catalan literature in national and international society, and to help in the professional, technical, and cultural development of its members. In this context, one of the most popular initiatives has been the Meetings of Writers which, like the AELC, has joined together authors from all corners of the Catalan linguistic realm; specifically from the three autonomous regions within the Spanish state: the Valencian country, the Balearic Islands, and Catalonia. It is important to note that the AELC is the only cultural association whose scope includes the entire linguistic territory. This fact is a reflection of a complex political situation derived from the fact that each autonomous community has its own government with its own distinct politics and manner of acting. * To represent Catalan writers in a collective manner before public, private, community, state, national and international institutions. the AELC president is Bel Olid. Past AELC presidents include: Josep M. Castellet, Josep M. Llompart, Joan Fuster, Avel¬∑l√≠ Art√≠s-Gener, Jaume Fuster, Ant√≤nia Vicens, and Jaume P√©rez Montaner and Guillem-Jordi Graells.

Eugenio Pacelli (the future Pope Pius XII) visited the United States for two weeks in October‚ÄìNovember 1936 as Cardinal Secretary of State and Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church. At the time, Pacelli was the highest ranking Catholic official ever to visit the US.The New York Times. 1936, October 9. \\"Cardinal Pacelli, Papal Envoy, Here\\". p. 1. Although he did not visit the US as Pope, he was the first Pope who visited the US at any time in his life. Pacelli met with President Franklin D. Roosevelt, investigated Roosevelt's radio critic Rev. Charles Coughlin, and visited New York City, Washington, D.C., Boston, Saint Paul, MN, and Chicago. The media nicknamed Pacelli \\"The Flying Cardinal\\" due to his five-day coast-to-coast air tour. Pacelli planned to silence Coughlin for Roosevelt in exchange for his support against Communism and, more importantly, in an attempt to achieve diplomatic recognition of the sovereignty of Vatican City.Arnoldo Cortesi. 1936, October 2. \\"Pacelli Reported Seeking Aid of U.S. in Anti-Red Drive\\". The New York Times. p. 1. Monsignor Giuseppe Pizzardo, the Secretary of Extraordinary Affairs, served as acting Secretary of State during Pacelli's absence. Pope Pius XI also cut short his vacation at Castel Gandolfo to return to the Vatican during Pacelli's absence. Itinerary=Arrival SS Conte di Savoia, which waited for him in New York for his return voyage. It was customary for Pacelli to take an annual vacation, and he changed his plans from Switzerland at the last moment. According to The New York Times, no secretaries or officials accompanied Pacelli, only Enrico Galeazzi, his gentleman-in-waiting and a Vatican City architect. In fact, The New York Times failed to report the presence of Sister Pascalina Lehnert, the secretary and confidant of Pacelli since the time of his nunciature to Germany.Cornwell, 1999, p. 176.

Charles Coughlin, a prominent radio critic of Roosevelt's, was silenced by Pacelli's visit. Pacelli arrived in New York on October 8 and first met with Cardinal Patrick Joseph Hayes and Apostolic Delegate Amleto Giovanni Cicognani, along with many other Catholic bishops, clergy members, and prominent laymen. Pacelli delivered a brief and vague prepared statement to reporters and brushed off questions about Coughlin and potential diplomatic recognition of the Vatican. Before Pacelli had even met with Coughlin, all of the candidates of Coughlin's Union party withdrew their candidacy for New York public office; rumors circulated that Pacelli's visit was related to their withdrawals.The New York Times. 1936, October 10. \\"Coughlin's Ticket Quits in the State\\". p. 5. In New York, Pacelli was the guest at Inisfada, the Manhasset, Long Island home of Genevieve Garvan Brady, the widow of Nicholas Frederic Brady, one of New York's wealthiest public utility directors and financiers; a large papal donor in her own right, she was created a Dame of Malta and a papal Duchess.The New York Times. 1936, October 2. \\"Mrs. Brady to Meet Prelate\\". p. 13.

His speech before the National Press Club was broadcast. Earlier that day, Pacelli interrupted a train trip to spend a one-hour visit in Baltimore. After being greeted by Archbishop Michael J. Curley and a gathering of Baltimore clergy, he went immediately to the Cathedral of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, where they knelt in prayer at the main altar for several minutes and then visited the crypt of Cardinal James Gibbons. Pope Pius XI raised the Cathedral to the rank of a Minor Basilica a few months later. Air tour Pacelli then embarked on a five-day coast-to-coast air tour covering seven cities, departing from Roosevelt Field on Long Island on a plane chartered from United Airlines.The New York Times. 1936, October 24. \\"Pacelli Starts Tour of Nation Tomorrow\\". p. 19. Accompanying Pacelli on the plane were Bishop Spellman, Basil Harris, the VP of United States Lines, Galeazzo, Cavenaugh, Kelly, and one of Mrs. Brady's advisers. The cities included were: South Bend, Indiana, Chicago, St. Paul, Minnesota, San Francisco, Los Angeles, St. Louis, Cincinnati, Syracuse, and New York City.

At a press conference with reporters, Spellman reiterated to the press corps that they were prohibited from asking any questions about Coughlin, which he assured them Pacelli would not answer.

Significance=American perceptions of Fascism According to D'Agostino, \\"historians have neglected to consider how Pacelli's visit communicated to observers that the Holy See and Fascist Italy shared a special relationship\\".D'Agostino, 2004, p. 247. Not only did Pacelli travel with Italy's new ambassador, Fulvio Savich, but the two became close companions during the lengthy voyage. At the wishes of Foreign Minister Galeazzo Ciano, Mussolini's son-in-law, Italian consular officials were invited to dine with Pacelli when he joined the Cardinals of Philadelphia, Boston, and Chicago. Vatican-US relations In their meeting, Pacelli secured from Roosevelt a promise to appoint a US representative to the Holy See.Dalin, 2005, p. 58. No such diplomatic link had existed since 1870, when the Risorgimento seized the territories of the Papal States, all but ending the papacy's temporal power. The Senate had withdrawn the stipend for such a diplomat in 1867, seeing little value in maintaining the outpost. Roosevelt appointed an informal \\"personal envoy\\", which did not require Senate approval. By the time of the meeting, the Senate opposition was primarily rooted in Protestant objections, rather than cost.Cornwell, 1999, p. 177. Roosevelt did not fulfill his promise until December 1939, when he appointed Myron Charles Taylor as his personal representative to Pius XII; Taylor's appointment was renewed by Truman and lasted until 1950.Dalin, 2005, p. 59. The Wartime Correspondence Between President Roosevelt and Pope Pius XII were published in 2005 with the foreword and notes of Taylor. Coughlin and the 1936 election 1936 landslide victory occurred during Pacelli's visit. Both Pius XII's defenders and critics have implied the existence of a deal between Pacelli and Roosevelt to silence Father Charles Coughlin, the leading Catholic critic of the New Deal, in exchange for diplomatic recognition of the Vatican. According to Cornwell, \\"an unspoken quid pro quo of the visit was an exchange of favors between Pacelli and President Roosevelt. Roosevelt wanted help quelling the Catholic radio priest Father Charles Coughlin, who preached weekly and subversively to an audience of fifteen million Americans\\". Dalin, otherwise a critic of Cornwell, is content to repeat the claim that Pacelli played a \\"behind-the-scenes role in silencing\\" Coughlin, for his own part wishing to emphasize Coughlin's personal anti-Semitism.Dalin, 2005, p. 57. Indeed, on November 8, shortly after Pacelli's departure, Coughlin announced that he was making his final radio broadcast. Of course, it remains unclear what, if anything, Pacelli might have said to Coughlin to induce such a change. Although Dalin claims that Coughlin's (and thus Pacelli's) role in the presidential election was potentially decisive, Roosevelt's victory was in fact a foregone landslide (carrying every state but Maine and Vermont).Dalin, 2005, p. 58.

For over two centuries, there had been a bitter debate regarding the nature of Christ: the orthodox Chalcedonian position defined Christ as having two natures in one person, whereas Monophysite opponents contended that Jesus Christ possessed but a single nature. At the time, the Byzantine Empire had been at near constant war for fifty years and had lost large territories. It was under great pressure to establish domestic unity. This was hampered by the large number of Byzantines who rejected the Council of Chalcedon in favour of Monophysitism. The Type attempted to dismiss the entire controversy, on pain of dire punishment. This extended to kidnapping the Pope from Rome to try him for high treason and mutilating one of the Type's main opponents. Constans died in 668. Ten years later his son, Constantine IV, fresh from a triumph over his Arab enemies and with the predominately Monophysitic provinces irredeemably lost, called the Third Council of Constantinople. It decided with an overwhelming majority to condemn Monophysitism, Monotheletism, the Type of Constans and its major supporters. Constantine put his seal to the Council's decisions, and reunited such of Christendom as was not under Arab suzerainty.  Background = Political background  Byzantine Empire in 648 under Constans II In 628, the Christian Byzantine Empire and the Zoroastrian Sasanian Empire of Iran ended a harrowing twenty-six-year-long war. Both states were completely exhausted. The Byzantines had had the majority of their territory overrun and a large part of it devastated. Consequently, they were vulnerable to the sudden emergence of the Islamic Rashidun Caliphate in Arabia; the Caliphate's forces invaded both empires only a few years after the war. The Muslim, also known as Arab, forces swiftly conquered the entire Sasanian Empire and deprived the Byzantine Empire of its territories in the Levant, the Caucasus, Egypt, and North Africa. By 642, the Muslim armies had conquered all of Syria and Egypt, the richest parts of the Byzantine Empire.Norwich, pg. 300‚Äì02 For a variety of reasons, the Byzantine population of Syria did not put up much resistance.Hugh N. Kennedy notes that \\"the Muslim conquest of Syria does not seem to have been actively opposed by the towns, but it is striking that Antioch put up so little resistance\\". (Kennedy 1970, 611; Kennedy 2006, 87) High taxes, the power of the landowners over the peasants, and the recently ended war with the Persians were some of the reasons why the Syrians welcomed the change. \\"The people of Homs replied [to the Muslims], 'We like your rule and justice far better than the state of oppression and tyranny in which we were. The army of Heraclius [Byzantium] we shall indeed ... repulse from the city.Al-Baladhuri, The Battle of the Yarmuk (636) and after Another key reason for the welcome of the Arabs as rulers by the Christian Syrians and Egyptians, is that they found the strict monotheism of Islam closer to their own Monophysite Christian position than the hated doctrine of Constantinople, which they perceived as bitheism.Norwich 1988, pp. 304‚Äì05 On 11 February 641 Heraclius, emperor for 31 years, who had pulled the Empire back from the brink of ruin, died. In the following three years, the Empire endured four short-lived emperors or usurpers before seventeen-year-old Constans II, grand-son of Heraclius, established himself on the throne of the diminished realm.Lilie et al pp. 70‚Äì71 In 643‚Äì644, Valentinus led a campaign against the Arabs, but his army was routed, he fled, and his treasury was captured. In 644 or 645, Valentinus attempted to usurp his son-in-law's throne. He failed, the populace of the capital lynching his envoy Antoninos before killing Valentinus himself.-->The Byzantine Empire seemed to be tearing itself apart with internecine strife, while the \\"human tsunami\\"Howard-Johnston (2006), xv of Arab conquest swept on.  Theological background  Pope John IV Maximus the Confessor The Council of Chalcedon, the Fourth Ecumenical Council, was held in 451 and laid the basis of Christological belief; Christ was a single person possessing two natures: a perfect God and a perfect man united \\"unconfusedly, unchangeably, indivisibly and inseparably\\".Norwich, pp. 156 This was viewed as outright heresy by Monophysites who, briefly, believe that Jesus Christ is \\"one person and one hypostasis in one nature: divine\\".Martin Lembke, lecture in the course \\"Meetings with the World's Religions\\", Centre for Theology and Religious Studies, Lund University, Spring Term 2010. Monophysite belief was widespread in Egypt and, to a lesser extent, Syria.After Chalcedon ‚Äì Orthodoxy in the 5th/6th Centuries The Byzantine state had repeatedly attempted to stamp it out. Emperor Heraclius spent the last years of his life attempting to find a compromise theological position between the Monophysites and the Chalcedonians. What he promoted via his Ecthesis was a doctrine which declared that Jesus, whilst he possessed two distinct natures, had only one will; the question of the energy of Christ was not relevant.Bury 2005, p. 251. This approach seemed to be an acceptable compromise, and it secured widespread support throughout the east. Pope Honorius I and the four Patriarchs of the East ‚Äì Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch and Jerusalem ‚Äì all gave their approval to the doctrine, referred to as Monothelitism, and so it looked as if Heraclius would finally heal the divisions in the church.Norwich, p. 309 The Popes in Rome objected. Pope Honorius I died in 638 and his successor Pope Severinus condemned the Ecthesis outright, and so was forbidden his seat by Constans until 640. His successor Pope John IV also rejected the doctrine completely, leading to a major schism between the eastern and western halves of the Catholic Church. When news of the Pope‚Äôs condemnation reached Heraclius, he was already old and ill, and the news is said to have hastened his death.Norwich, p. 310 Meanwhile, there were problems in the province of Africa. Since the fall of Egypt it was in the front line against Arab expansionism. Nominally a Byzantine province, in practice Africa was all but independent and a hotbed of dissent to Constantinople's Monotheletist policies. The threat of imminent invasion increased the local bishops' antipathy to Monophysitism, knowing that its adherents in Syria and Egypt had welcomed the invading Arabs. The compromise policy of Monotheletism was disliked as giving comfort to those seen theologically as heretics and politically as potential traitors. A monk named Maximus the Confessor had long carried on a furious campaign against Monotheletism, and in 646 convinced an African council of bishops, all resolutely Chalcedonian, to draw up a manifesto against it. This they forwarded to the new pope, Theodore I, who in turn wrote to Patriarch Paul II of Constantinople, outlining the heretical nature of the doctrine. Paul, a devoted Monothelete, replied in a letter directing the Pope to adhere to the doctrine of one will. Theodore in turn excommunicated the Patriarch in 649, declaring Paul a heretic. The divisions in Byzantine society and the open opposition to imperial authority were starkly exposed.Treadgold, p. 312Bury, p. 292  Constans issues the Type  Constans II Constans II was a young man of seventeen, and he was supremely indifferent to the religious debates convulsing the Church.Bury, p. 293 However, he was certainly concerned about the effect the arcane debate was having on his empire. A key reason for the parlous position of the Byzantine Empire was the religious divide. He had just established an uncertain truce with the Arabs, and badly needed to rebuild his forces and to gain the full support of his empire. So he issued an imperial edict, called the Type () in 648.Modern historian Salvatore Consentino suggests that it may have been issued as late as spring 649.(Consentino, pp. 153‚Äì54) This edict made it illegal to discuss the topic of Christ possessing either one or two wills, or one or two energies; or even to acknowledge that such a debate was possible. He declared that the whole controversy was to be forgotten. During the proceedings of the Lateran Council of 649 the text of the Type was read out in full and so is preserved in the recorded Acts. The first section expresses concern that some subjects of the empire consider Christ to have had one will, and some that he had two. This is discussed, and concluded with the observation that the debate is dividing society and that Constans intends to put a stop to this.Price, R., The Acts of the Lateran Synod of 649, Liverpool: 2014, 262‚Äì263. The Type goes on to deny people \\"the licence to conduct any dispute, contention or controversy\\", explaining that whole matter has been settled by the five previous ecumenical councils \\"and the straight forwardly plain statements... of the approved holy fathers\\". The right of any individual to interpret their findings is explicitly forbidden. \\"The situation that existed previously... is to be maintained everywhere, as if no quibbling had arisen over them.\\" There is to be an amnesty for any past comments on the topic, and all writings regarding it are to be destroyed. In the third and final section, various penalties were prescribed for anyone who disobeys the imperial decree. Bishops or clerks of the church are to be deposed. Monks are to be excommunicated, while public servants or military officers are to lose their office. Private citizens of senatorial rank would have their property confiscated. Finally, if any of the great mass of the citizenry so much as mentioned the topic, they would face corporal punishment and banishment for life.Norwich, p. 317  Opposition  Pope Martin I, the first pope since 537 consecrated without imperial approval In Rome and the west, the opposition to Monotheletism was reaching fever pitch, and the Type of Constans did nothing to defuse the situation; indeed it made it worse by implying that either doctrine was as good as the other. Theodore planned the Lateran Council of 649 to condemn the Ecthesis, but died before he could convene it; his successor, Pope Martin I, did. Not only did the Council condemn the Ecthesis, it condemned the Type as well. After the synod, Pope Martin wrote to Constans, informing the emperor of its conclusions and requiring him to condemn both the Monothelete doctrine and his own Type. However, Constans was not the sort of emperor to take such a rebuke of imperial authority lightly.Norwich, p. 318 Constans sent a new Exarch of Ravenna, Olympius, who had authority over all Byzantine territory in Italy, which included Rome. He had firm instructions to ensure that the Type be followed in Italy, and to use whatever means necessary to ensure that the Pope adhere to it.Bury, p. 294 Arriving while the Lateran Synod was sitting, he realised how opposed the west was to the emperor's policy and set up Italy as an independent state; his army joined his rebellion. This made it impractical for Constans to take effective action against Pope Martin, until after Olympius died three years later.Ostrogorsky, p. 107 Constans appointed a new Exarch, Theodore I Calliopas, who marched on Rome with the newly loyal army, abducted Pope Martin and brought him to Constantinople where he was tried for high treason before the Senate; he was banished to Chersonesus (present-day Crimea) and shortly after died as a result of his mistreatment.Bury, p. 296 In an unusual move, a successor, Pope Eugene I, was elected in 654 by the College of Cardinals while Martin I still lived. The new pope normalized relations with Constantinople, and although he avoided pressing the issues of the Christological controversy, he ceremonially refused to accept a letter from the Patriarch of Constantinople when the imperial emissary attempted to deliver it.Ekonomou, 2007, pp. 159‚Äì161. Constans viewed settling the dispute as a matter of state security, and persecuted anyone who spoke out against Monotheletism, including Maximus the Confessor and a number of his disciples. Maximus was tortured over several years; he lost his tongue and his right hand as Constans attempted to force him to recant. Constans even personally journeyed to Rome in 663 to meet with the Pope, the first emperor to visit since the fall of the Western Roman Empire.Ostrogorsky, pp. 107‚Äì09  Condemnation  Miniature 45 from the Constantine Manasses Chronicle, 14th century, showing the Sixth Ecumenical Council With Constans' death in 668, the throne passed to his son Constantine IV. Pope Vitalian, who had hosted the visit of Constans II to Rome in 663, almost immediately declared himself in favour of the doctrine of the two wills of Christ, the orthodox Chalcedonian position. In response, Patriarch Theodore I of Constantinople and Macarius, Patriarch of Antioch, both pressed Constantine to take measures against the Pope. Constantine, however, was fully occupied with military matters and saw no profit in reigniting this debate. In 674, the Arabs commenced the great siege of Constantinople which lasted four years before they were defeated. With the pressure from external enemies at least temporarily relieved, Constantine was able to turn to church affairs. With the predominately Monophysitist provinces permanently lost to the Arabs, he was under less pressure to support any compromise which included their position.Ostrogorsky, pp. 111‚Äì15 Arab expansion He decided to put the Monotheletic question to a Church Council. Constantine suggested this to the Pope in 678, and the proposal was welcomed.Bury, p. 314 This council, the Sixth Ecumenical Council, met for ten months from 680 to 681. It hosted 174 delegates from every corner of Christendom. The Patriarchs of Constantinople and Antioch were present in person, while the Pope and the Patriarchs of Alexandria and Jerusalem sent representatives. It held 18 plenary sessions; Constantine chaired the first 11, carefully expressing no opinion. On 16 September 681, it nearly unanimously condemned the Monotheletic doctrine and the Type of Constans, with the exception of two delegates. Constantine personally signed the final declaration and was hailed as Destroyer of Heretics. Monotheletism was outlawed, and the non-Arab Christian world was united.Norwich, pp. 326‚Äì7Ostrogorsky, p. 115 One of the patriarchs anathematised (excommunicated) as heretics for their support of the Type was Pope Honorius.Ostrogorsky, p. 114 The issue of a Pope being disowned by his own successors has caused difficulty for Catholic theologians ever since, especially when discussing papal infallibility.Norwich, p. 326 Pope Leo II later replaced the finding of heresy with one of negligence, and Catholic theologians have since argued that Honorius's pronouncements never met the criteria for ex cathedra statements as defined by the First Vatican Council.

From 2002 to 2013, the game was played at Arrowhead Stadium, home to the Kansas City Chiefs. The games were played at the teams' home field, due to being unable to reach terms with the Kansas City Chiefs, from 2014 to 2018. The game is set to return to Arrowhead Stadium in 2019. Overview While at Arrowhead, the Fall Classic drew more than 20,000 fans each year (including 26,695 in 2004), the largest attendance of any regular-season NCAA Division II sporting event. Since 1991 the two MIAA rivals have appeared in 15 NCAA Division II National Football Championship title games. Pittsburg State is 2‚Äì3 winning in 1991 and 2011, and was runner up in 1992, 1995 and 2004 (in addition it polled #1 in 1961). Northwest is 6‚Äì4, winning the titles in 1998, 1999, 2009, 2013, 2015 and 2016 and was runner up in 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008. In addition to the regular season games the two teams have also played each other in 2004, 2005, 2008 and 2011 in Division II playoff games. The two teams have combined for at least a share of all but two MIAA championships since 1989. In every matchup at Arrowhead except 2003, at least one of the teams was ranked in the Top 10 in Division II. In 2013, 2012, 2011, 2009, 2008, 2006 and 2004 both teams were in the Top 10 including 2004 when they were #1 and #2. On February 11, 2014 Northwest Missouri State announced on their website that they were unable to reach terms with the Kansas City Chiefs to continue the use of Arrowhead Stadium for the contest. Northwest won ten of the thirteen games played at Arrowhead Stadium. Game results A During the 2004, 2005, 2008, and 2011 college football seasons, the Bearcats and Gorillas played twice; in this case, the second meeting was in the playoffs. All other seasons that the two teams played twice was considered a regular season game.

History Introduced at the 1936 Paris Motor Show, the Friedrich Geiger designed car was a development of the 500K, itself a development of the SSK. Available as a both a two- and four-seat cabriolet, four seater coup√© or seven seater limousine (with armoured sides and armoured glass), it was one of the largest cars of its time. The straight-8 cylinder engine of the 500K was enlarged in displacement to . It was fed by twin pressurized updraft carburetors, developing a . In addition, there was an attached Roots supercharger, which could either be engaged manually for short periods, or automatically when the accelerator was pushed fully to the floor. This increased power to , enabling a top speed of . Power was sent to the rear wheels through a four-speed or optional five-speed manual gearbox that featured synchromesh on the top three gears. Vacuum-assisted hydraulic brakes kept the car under the driver's control. The 540K had the same chassis layout at the 500K, but it was significantly lightened by replacing the girder-like frame of the 500K with oval-section tubes - an influence of the Silver Arrows racing campaign. To meet individual wishes of customers, three chassis variants were available, as for the 500K: two long versions with a wheelbase, differing in terms of powertrain and bodywork layout; and a short version with . The long variant, termed the normal chassis with the radiator directly above the front axle, served as the backbone for the four-seater cabriolets, the 'B' (with four side windows) and 'C' (with two side windows), and for touring cars and saloons. The shorter chassis was for the two-seater cabriolet 'A', set up on a chassis on which radiator, engine, cockpit and all rearward modules were moved back from the front axle. The Sindelfingen factory employed 1,500 people to create the 540K, and allowed a great deal of owner customisation, meaning only 70 chassis were ever bodied by independent builders. Owners included Jack L. Warner of Warner Brothers film studios. With the outbreak of World War II in 1939, the proposed further boring-out of the engine to for a 580K was aborted, probably after only one such car was made. Chassis production ceased in 1940, with the final 2 being completed that year, and earlier chassis were still being bodied at a steady rate during 1940, with smaller numbers being completed in the 1941-1943 period. Regular replacement bodies were ordered in 1944 for a few cars. Special saloon (W24) Mercedes-Benz 540K (W24) On top of the normal and roadster cars, 12 special cars were developed on an extended chassis length with a wheelbase. All of these cars were developed for the Nazi hierarchy, as six seater convertible saloons. To allow for armour plate, these cars had developed De Dion rear suspension. Due to their higher weight, their maximum speed was . After the assassination attempt on Reinhard Heydrich in Prague at the end of May 1942, the Reich Chancellery would only use armoured cars for ministers and leaders of friendly powers. Beside 20 large Mercedes- Benz 770s, in 1942 they ordered an additional 20 540Ks developed as two door armoured saloons. These were delivered during 1942 and 1943. A further order for 17 armoured saloons was placed in late 1943, and these were delivered in April 1944. One of these cars was given as a gift from Adolf Hitler to Ante Paveliƒá, leader of the Independent State of Croatia. After the war, this car was captured and used first by Ivan Krajacic, and then by Josip Broz Tito. Hermann Goering's \\"Blue Goose\\" In 1936, Mercedes-Benz introduced the 540K special, designated 540Ks. Based on the shorter wheelbase chassis, its body was carefully crafted. Its price tag of 28,000 Reichsmarks, some RM6,000 above the price of standard models, meant only 32 were ever built. In 1937, Reichsmarschall Hermann Goering ordered a 540Ks, in his favourite colour of sky blue with his family crest on both doors. It included armour-plated sides and bulletproof glass. Nicknamed the \\"Blue Goose\\", Goering was often photographed in the car. On May 4, 1945, the US Army, C Company, 326th Engineers, 101st Airborne Division 'Screaming Eagles' entered Berchtesgaden, and on finding the car took possession. Major General Maxwell Taylor used the car as his command vehicle in West Germany until it was commissioned by the US Treasury. Shipped to Washington, D.C., it successfully toured the United States in a victory bond tour. In 1956, the car was auctioned off by the US Army at the Aberdeen Proving Grounds in Maryland and sold to Jacques Tunick of Greenwich, Connecticut, with a high bid of $2167. In 1958, Tunick sold the car to the private collection of veterinarian Dr. George Bitgood Jr., who had it repainted in black and the chrome re-plated. Kept private, Bitgood only displayed it once, at the 1973 county fair in Durham, Connecticut. After Bitgood's death, the \\"Blue Goose\\" was shown by his family in June 2002 at the 101st Airborne Reunion at Fort Campbell, Kentucky. The car was then sold to Carnlough International Limited of Guernsey, on the agreement that it be restored to its condition \\"as found\\" at Berchtesgaden.

Her first husband was John de Lacy, 2nd Earl of Lincoln, by whom she had two children. He was created 2nd Earl of Lincoln by right of his marriage to Margaret. Margaret has been described as \\"one of the two towering female figures of the mid-13th century\\".Mitchell p.42 Family Margaret was born in about 1206, the daughter and only child of Robert de Quincy and Hawise of Chester, herself the co-heiress of her uncle Ranulf de Blondeville, 6th Earl of Chester. Hawise became suo jure Countess of Chester in April 1231 when her brother resigned the title in her favour. Her paternal grandfather, Saer de Quincy, 1st Earl of Winchester was one of the 25 sureties of the Magna Carta; as a result he was excommunicated by the Church in December 1215. Two years later her father died after having been accidentally poisoned through medicine prepared by a Cistercian monk. Life On 23 November 1232, Margaret and her husband John de Lacy, Baron of Pontefract were formally invested by King Henry III as Countess and Earl of Lincoln. In April 1231 her maternal uncle Ranulf de Blondeville, 1st Earl of Lincoln had made an inter vivos gift, after receiving dispensation from the crown, of the Earldom of Lincoln to her mother Hawise. Her uncle granted her mother the title by a formal charter under his seal which was confirmed by King Henry III. Her mother was formally invested as suo jure 1st Countess of Lincoln on 27 October 1232 the day after her uncle's death. Likewise her mother Hawise of Chester received permission from King Henry III to grant the Earldom of Lincoln jointly to Margaret and her husband John, and less than a month later a second formal investiture took place, but this time for Margaret and her husband John de Lacy. Margaret became 2nd Countess of Lincoln suo jure (in her own right) and John de Lacy became 2nd Earl of Lincoln by right of his wife. (John de Lacy is mistakenly called the 1st Earl of Lincoln in many references.) In 1238, Margaret and her husband paid King Henry the large sum of 5,000 pounds to obtain his agreement to the marriage of their daughter Maud to Richard de Clare, 6th Earl of Hertford, 2nd Earl of Gloucester. On 22 July 1240 her first husband John de Lacy died. Although he was nominally succeeded by their only son Edmund de Lacy (c.1227-1258) for titles and lands that included Baron of Pontefract, Baron of Halton, and Constable of Chester, Margaret at first controlled the estates in lieu of her son who was still in his minority and being brought up at the court of Henry III and Eleanor of Provence. In 1243, Margaret inherited the manor of Grantchester on the death of her mother Hawise. Edmund was allowed to succeed to his titles and estates at the age of 18. Edmund was also Margaret's heir to the Earldom of Lincoln and also her other extensive estates that included the third of the Earldom of Pembroke that she had inherited from her second husband in 1248. Edmund was never able to become Earl of Lincoln, however, as he predeceased his mother by eight years. As the widowed Countess of Lincoln suo jure, Margaret was brought into contact with some of the most important people in the county of Lincolnshire. Among these included Robert Grosseteste, Bishop of Lincoln, the most significant intellectual in England at the time who recognised Margaret's position as Countess of Lincoln to be legitimate and important, and he viewed Margaret as both patron and peer. He dedicated Les Reules Seynt Robert, his treatise on estate and household management, to her.Mitchell, p.32 Margaret died in 1266, and left her estates to her grandson, Henry de Lacy, Earl of Lincoln.  Marriages and issue  Sometime before 21 June 1221, Margaret married as his second wife, her first husband John de Lacy of Pontefract. The purpose of the alliance was to bring the rich Lincoln and Bolingbroke inheritance of her mother to the de Lacy family.Carpenter, p.421 John's first marriage to Alice de l'Aigle had not produced issue; although John and Margaret together had two children: * Maud de Lacy (25 January 1223- 1287/10 March 1289), married in 1238 Richard de Clare, 6th Earl of Hertford, 2nd Earl of Gloucester, by whom she had seven children. * Edmund de Lacy, Baron of Pontefract (died 2 June 1258), married in 1247 Alasia of Saluzzo, daughter of Manfredo III of Saluzzo, by whom he had three children, including Henry de Lacy, 3rd Earl of Lincoln. She married secondly on 6 January 1242, Walter Marshal, 5th Earl of Pembroke, Lord of Striguil, Lord of Leinster, Earl Marshal of England, one of the ten children of William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke and Isabel de Clare, 4th Countess of Pembroke. This marriage, like those of his four brothers, did not produce any children; therefore when he died at Goodrich Castle on 24 November 1245, Margaret inherited a third of the Earldom of Pembroke as well as the properties and lordship of Kildare. Her dower third outweighed any of the individual holdings of the 13 different co-heirs of the five Marshal sisters which meant she would end up controlling more of the earldom of Pembroke and lordship of Leinster than any of the other co-heirs; this brought her into direct conflict with her own daughter, Maud, whose husband was by virtue of his mother Isabel Marshal one of the co-heirs of the Pembroke earldom.Mitchell, p.33 As a result of her quarrels with her daughter, Margaret preferred her grandson Henry de Lacy who would become the 3rd Earl of Lincoln on reaching majority (21) in 1272. She and her Italian daughter-in-law Alasia of Saluzzo shared in the wardship of Henry who was Margaret's heir, and the relationship between the two women appeared to have been cordial.Mitchell, p.34-35 Death and legacy Margaret was a careful overseer of her property and tenants, and gracious in her dealings with her son's children, neighbours and tenants.Mitchell, p.39 She received two papal dispensations in 1251, the first to erect a portable altar; the other so that she could hear mass in the Cistercian monastery.Mitchell, p.40 Margaret died in March 1266 at Hampstead. Her death was recorded in the Annals of Worcester and in the Annals of Winchester. She was buried in the Church of the Hospitallers in Clerkenwell. Margaret was described as \\"one of the two towering female figures of the mid-13th century\\"; the other being Ela, Countess of Salisbury.Mitchell, p.42 NotesReferences *, OUP Google Books accessed 28 September 2009 * Cawley.

Epyx, Inc. 862 F.2d 204, 9 U.S.P.Q.2d (BNA) 1322 (9th Cir. 1988), is a court case in which Data East, a video game manufacturer, contended that Epyx, a competing video game manufacturer, licensed and distributed a video game, World Karate Championship, that infringed on the copyright of a video game developed by Data East, Karate Champ. After a district court sided with Data East, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit court on appeal reversed the decision of copyright infringement. This judgment was based on the lack of \\"substantial similarity\\" between the games, because the identified similarities were inherent to all karate video games. Background and facts of the matter Data East, a video game company, released the Karate Champ video game in late 1984. It was initially released as a coin-operated arcade game, and subsequently in October 1985 as a home computer game. In April 1986, Epyx, another video game company, licensed and began distributing a competing and similar home computer video game under the title World Karate Championship, rebranded from the original International Karate title, which it had licensed from a British developer System 3. Both Karate Champ and World Karate Championship depicted a karate match between two opponents. There were several similarities between the two games; combatants each wore white and red, referees looked the same in each game, the allowed moves were similar, and the scoring mechanisms were based on increments and bonus points. Data East alleged that World Karate Championship, and thus Epyx, infringed on their copyright, trademark, and trade dress established by Karate Champ. District Court opinion The United States District Court for the Northern District of California held that Epyx infringed on Data East's copyright, due to the qualitative similarities in the appearance of the games. There was no infringement on trademark or trade dress. The district court then enjoined Epyx from copying, distributing, or preparing any derivative works from the copyrighted work. Additionally, all World Karate Championship games were recalled. The case was appealed by Epyx to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Arguments on appeal Data East asserted that Epyx infringed on their copyright. In order to demonstrate that there is copyright infringement, it is necessary to prove ownership of a copyright and copying of the work. It was not disputed that Data East owned the copyrights for Karate Champ. However, there was no evidence of direct copying of Karate Champ. Thus, in order to demonstrate that their copyright had been infringed, Data East had to show that * Epyx had access to the copyrighted work prior to creating their own work * their work exhibited \\"substantial similarity\\" to the copyrighted work. In the appeal, Epyx disputed that the two games exhibited substantial similarity. Judgment The Ninth Circuit reversed the district court's finding of copyright infringement by failing to find a substantial similarity between the two games. This judgment was reached based on the notion that \\"no substantial similarity of expression will be found when the idea and its expression are inseparable.\\" In order to determine whether a substantial similarity between the two works existed, the Ninth Circuit applied the \\"extrinsic-intrinsic test\\".Krofft, 562 F.2d at 1164. The purpose of this test is to determine if both the ideas and the expression of those ideas are substantially similar in the two works. Both of these tests must pass in order for a finding of substantial similarity to be reached. The extrinsic test, which determines if the ideas embodied by the works are the same, was used to determine that the ideas (\\"a martial arts karate combat game conducted between two combatants\\") were similar or identical. Next, the intrinsic test, regarding the \\"total concept and feel of the works\\", was used to determine the similarity of the expression of that idea. Because copyright protection cannot be extended to all elements of an expression, such as expressions that are indispensable or standard to the idea (i.e. Sc√®nes √† faire), the court performed an analytic dissection of the similarities between the two games to determine if the similarities were not simply the use of common ideas, and thus protected by copyright. The court found the following similarities: *A. Each game has fourteen moves. *B. Each game has a two-player option. *C. Each game has a one-player option. *D. Each game has forward and backward somersault moves and about-face moves. *E. Each game has a squatting reverse punch wherein the heel is not on the ground. *F. Each game has an upper-lunge punch. *G. Each game has a back-foot sweep. *H. Each game has a jumping sidekick. *I. Each game has low kick. *J. Each game has a walk-backwards position. *K. Each game has changing background scenes. *L. Each game has 30-second countdown rounds. *M. Each game uses one referee. *N. In each game the referee says \\"begin,\\" \\"stop,\\" \\"white,\\" \\"red,\\" which is depicted by a cartoon-style speech balloon. *O. Each game has a provision for 100 bonus points per remaining second. The similarities were judged by the court to \\"encompass the idea of karate\\" and necessarily follow from the idea of a karate video game. Thus, the district court was in error because it did not limit the scope of the copyright protection to the unique elements, such as the background and the score keeping. Furthermore, the Ninth Circuit decided that even those elements were dissimilar, concluding that a 17.5-year-old boy (the average age of a consumer of the video game) \\"would not find the games substantially similar\\". Because the idea and expression are inseparable, the court found that there was no substantial similarity and no copyright infringement. Consequences The Data East case is a significant judgment because \\"it is the first time in the computer industry that a look-and-feel lawsuit has been decided in favor of the defendant\\".Epyx Chairman and CEO David Morse in Epyx wins appeal on karate gale copyright lawsuit - PR Newswire, December 5, 1988 The litigation of copyright infringements based on look-and-feel similarities was fairly new, and previous cases had been settled out of the court, to the benefit of the presumed copyright holder. For example, in 1985, Digital Research had to change some aspects of their Graphics Environment Manager (GEM) product and agreed to pay Apple a financial compensation as part of a settlement that would keep them out of court.Digital's new look in Computer Horizons (Computer Briefing): Trade unionists under screen stress - The Times (London), October 8, 19851989 Starts with writs aplenty; 1988 was a bad legal year in the computer industry, but 1989 could be worse - Sydney Morning Herald (Australia), January 9, 1989 The opinion of the judges in the Data East case has been cited in several other major look-and-feel cases, even those that do not necessarily involve parties from the software industry. Screen display copyright policies after Data East Subsequent cases that cite this case contend over the copyright of the graphical user interfaces, such as in Apple Computer, Inc. v. Microsoft Corporation. In this case, the ninth circuit Court of Appeals rejected the argument of Apple that the extrinsic-intrinsic test had gone too far and should have not happened at all because \\"[The district court] should have recognized protectability of arrangements and the total concept and feel of the works under a substantial similarity standard.\\" As in Data East, the court ruled for the defendant, considering that \\"almost all of the similarities spring either from the license or from basic ideas and their obvious expression\\", i.e. that the sc√®nes √† faire doctrine invalidates the copyright infringement claim. In 1994, Data East faced a copyright infringement claim from Capcom U.S.A. and a preliminary injunction to stop distributing the video game Fighter's History.Capcom U.S.A. Inc. v. Data East Corp., 1994 WL 1751482 (N.D. Cal. 1994) Although Data East had clearly used Capcom's game Street Fighter II as a reference in the development of its own game, the preliminary injunction was denied. Under the analytic dissection of the work, the court only found unprotectable similarities, once again relying on the sc√®nes √† faire doctrine. Data East's largest objection in court was that their 1984 arcade game Karate Champ was the true originator of the competitive fighting game genre, which predated the original Street Fighter by three years. Effects outside the software industry An opinion that cites this case outside the computer industry is Pasillas v. McDonald's Corporation. In this case, the plaintiff, the creator of a latex Halloween mask depicting a man in the moon, claims that the advertising campaigns of McDonald's, also depicting a mask with a man in the moon, infringed on his copyright. The court refers to the \\"Aliotti line of cases\\" for deciding this case. In particular, the intrinsic test of substantial similarity of expression leads the judges to conclude that the very treatment of the idea of a man in the moon is the only source of similarities, and that those similarities are not substantial, explicitly stating the Data East sc√®nes √† faire doctrine that \\"no copyright protection is afforded to elements of expression that are indispensable or standard in treatment of idea\\". Criticism Independent observers noted that the intrinsic-extrinsic test used by the Ninth Circuit almost always led to a rejection of the copyright infringement accusation.I. Intellectual Property: A. Copyright: 3. Derivative Works: a) Substantial Similarity Test: Tiffany Design, Inc. v. Reno-Tahoe Specialty, Inc. in Berkeley Technology Law Journal Annual Review of Law and Technology, 2000, 15 Berkeley Tech. L.J. 49 The extrinsic test is performed by a non-expert observer, who will eventually decide on the presence of a substantial similarity. Indeed, \\"a lay observer may mistakenly determine that two user interfaces are similar because they appear similar, even though the details of their implementation may be very different\\".It walks like a duck, talks like a duck, but is it a duck? Making sense of substantial similarity law as applied to user interfaces - Ellen M. Bierman in Seattle University Law Review, Fall 1992, 16 Puget Sound L. Rev. 319 Another criticism of the extrinsic-intrinsic test is the \\"failure to consider medium and market needs.\\" For instance, the printing and the information industry do not share some of the same characteristics. Namely, the marginal costs of copying data in the information industry are typically insignificant compared to the printing industry. These characteristics could be kept in mind when deciding on a substantial similarity, since there are no clear guidelines for making this decision, but \\"the preservation of the balance between competition and protection reflected in the patent and copyright laws\\".

Life  Lekert, an illiterate shoemaker, was active in the Bund since his youth. On May 24, 1900 he led a group of people in an attack on a police station in Vilnius and released three arrested workers. He was caught and exiled to Yekaterinoslav. He escaped in 1902 and came to Vilnius. On May 18, 1902 he carried out an unsuccessful assassination attempt of the governor of Vilnius, General Victor von Wahl.Hirsz Abramowicz, Eva Zeitlin Dobkin, Dina Abramowicz, Jeffrey Shandler, David E.

Later von Wahl was responsible for repressive measures directed at Vilnius's workers, and the Bund in particular. Von Wahl ordered the arrest and flogging of a number of Jewish and Polish workers who had taken part in the May Day parade in 1902.Dovid Katz, \\"Words on Fire: The Unfinished Story of Yiddish\\", Basic Books, 2007, pg. 260, Because of the practices of his administration, plots for his assassination began to be formed soon after his arrival. Lekert, together with several other Bund members began watching von Wahl's movements, bought weapons and trained in forests outside of Vilna. However, most of the formal plans fell through and Lekert's attempt was made without any preparation. Lekert, who was working as a shoemaker at the time, fired a pistol twice at the governor as von Wahl was exiting the circus show, wounding him in the leg and arm. Lekert was immediately arrested, beaten, then transferred to the city's prison. Under pressure from the Minister of the Interior, Vyacheslav von Plehve, Hirsh Lekert was tried by a military court. He was convicted and sentenced to death by hanging. At his trial, Lekert, despite the advice of a local rabbi, refused to ask for forgiveness and gave an eloquent speech on the dignity of the Jewish worker. The sentence was carried out on June 10, 1902.

History After the Austro-Prussian War, in the autumn of 1866, victorious Prussia annexed four former allies of the defeated Austrian forces north of the Main line: Hanover as well as Hesse, Nassau, and the Free City of Frankfurt. While the former kingdom was incorporated as the Province of Hanover without any referendum or consultation; protests by the affected population led to the foundation of the anti-Prussian German- Hanoverian Party. Upon the Hanoverian surrender after the Battle of Langensalza on 29 June 1866, the kingdom was occupied by Prussian troops and formally annexed on September 20. During the Luxembourg Crisis between Prussia and France in spring 1867, a rising number of Hanoverian soldiers gathered at Arnhem in the Netherlands at the behest of exiled King George V and his newly established court at the Villa H√ºgel in Hietzing near Vienna. However, when a war was once again averted by the Treaty of London signed on May 11, the Dutch government ordered all foreign troops to leave the country. After being raised as a sizeable force, the Legion migrated to Switzerland, where its numbers swelled to 700. King George V, who never abandoned his claim to the Hanoverian throne, continued to maintain the Legion at his own expense while in exile in France. In February 1868 the unit moved from Switzerland to France at the same time as George V and Marie of Saxe-Altenburg celebrated their silver wedding anniversary in Paris. In 1869 the Prussian House of Representatives passed a law sequestering the funds of the former King of Hanover (Welfenfonds) in retaliation for his enmity and deployment of the Guelphic Legion. The Guelphic Legion was formally dissolved on 15 April 1870. Each of the 1,400 legionnaires received 400 francs upon discharge and additional traveling expenses as needed. Many returned to Hanover, but some migrated to the United States or to other parts of Europe. George V, unreconciled and embittered, died in Paris on 12 June 1878.

She was born in San Pedro Garza Garc√≠a, Mexico. During the 1930s, she spoke publicly and demonstrated on behalf of Mexican Americans about their education in the United States. She and her husband, Pedro Hernandez Barrera, founded Orden Caballeros de America on January 10, 1929. She organized the Asociaci√≥n Protectora de Madres in 1933. In 1970 she was active in the Raza Unida Party. Early life Mar√≠a Rebecca Latigo de Hern√°ndez was born in 1896 in Garza Garc√≠a near Monterrey, Nuevo Le√≥n, Mexico. Her father was a professor. As a young adult, she taught at an elementary school whilst she lived in Monterrey, Mexico.  Career  The Hern√°ndez family owned and ran a grocery store and bakery. She fought and wrote against the segregation, racial oppression, and poor education that the Mexican American children were receiving. In 1929, the Hern√°ndez family helped to organize and found the Order of the Knights of America, or the Orden Caballeros de America. The Order of Knights of America was a committee dedicated to political and civil activists in order to help Mexican Americans as well as Mexican immigrants. They helped with matters including educational and social, but the organization was largely focused on educational matters. The main audience targeted by their organization was Mexican American business owners. However, they also set a goal to help both male and female school aged children. In 1932 Mar√≠a Rebecca Latigo de Hern√°ndez was the first Mexican female announcer on the radio. In 1933 she helped open an association to help expecting mothers, which was known as Asociaci√≥n Protectora de Madres. In 1934 Mar√≠a, along with her husband and children, helped to manage an organization which helped to create safe places, and better the education for the West Side Mexican Communities. It was named La Liga de Defensa Pro-Escolar. In connection to her radio career, she spoke to promote Council 16 of the League of United Latin American Citizens on a program called the \\"Voz de las Americas\\". The league became well managed in December 1934. She supported the efforts of the league in 1940,and then again in 1947. During the years with the league, she helped to encourage equality for all Mexican Americans, no matter where they were from or where they were living. In 1938 she began working with the pecan-shellers' strike, with a cause for women workers' rights. The strike had begun as a way for women to obtain safer working conditions as well as increased salaries. In 1939 she was included in a group of women, who were able to visit then Mexican President, L√°zaro C√°rdenas. The women went to communicate the goodwill between Mexicans from Mexico and Mexican Americans in the United States. In 1945 \\"M√©xico y Los Cuatro Poderes Que Dirigen al Pueblo\\" (En: Mexico and the Four Powers that Lead the People) was published. In this essay, she said that domestic sphere founded society. It also stated that mothers were the creators of nations. Close to the time that her essay was published, she was also involved in organizing Club Liberal Pro-Cultura de la Mujer. In 1968 she was a regular guest on San Antonio television, informing the public about education and social progress. In 1969, Mar√≠a Rebecca Latigo de Hern√°ndez was appointed the position of Treasurer of the order's board of directors, as well as the President of Circulo Social. In 1970 she grew her political activities by joining the Raza Unida Party. She served as a key-note speaker at the Raza Unida's Statewide Conference, located in Austin, Texas.  Personal life  Hern√°ndez was married in 1915 at the age of 19 to Pedro Hern√°ndez Barrera. They were married in Hebbronville, Texas. They moved to San Antonio, in 1918, where they settled down, and their family eventually grew to include 10 children. She died of pneumonia on January 8, 1986. She is buried in the plot of the Orden Caballeros de Am√©rica outside of Elmendorf, Texas. Legacy She was featured as the subject of Google Doodle on July 29, 2018.

The best-known are mail user agents (MUAs, aka, email clients) and mail transfer agents (MTAs, programs that transfer email between clients), but finer divisions exist. More precisely, this is a technical way of referring to functions performed by various programs, considering them as software agents: a given program may perform several functions, but while it is performing a given function (such as mail transfer), it is referred to as a mail transfer agent. These terms are most often used within internet standards, and technical discussions of email infrastructure, not by end-users. While the individual terms are widely used in internet standards and RFCs, there is no widely used umbrella term for these programs, though such a program may informally be referred to generically as an MxA, 'x' being a wildcard, as the programs are referred to by acronyms of this form, such as MUA and MTA, with 'x' depending on role. Email servers are built from one or more software packages, each of which carries out the functions of one or more MxA.  Classification  The finest and most expansive classification in current use is into five functions in addition to the mail exchanger (MX): * Mail user agent (MUA) * Mail submission agent (MSA) * Mail transfer agent (MTA) * Mail delivery agent (MDA) * Mail retrieval agent (MRA) The traditional division is into client-side (MUA) and server-side (MTA, notably sendmail), with the flow given as: :MUA ‚Üí MTA ‚Üí ‚Ä¶ ‚Üí MTA ‚Üí MUA, Other divisions have been made to draw distinctions that some have found useful, which are detailed as follows. A detailed flow of a message through these various agents is given at , and may be summarized as :MUA ‚Üí MSA ‚Üí MTA ‚Üí ‚Ä¶ ‚Üí MTA ‚Üí MDA ‚Üí‚Üí MRA ‚Üí‚Üí MUA, with the arrow styles changing to distinguish between push steps (‚Üí) and pull steps (‚Üí‚Üí). Another source gives the flow as: :MUA ‚Üí (MSA) ‚Üí MTA ‚Üí ‚Ä¶ ‚Üí MX ‚Üí MDA ‚Üí‚Üí MRA/MUA, Programs such as fetchmail which retrieve email from a server but do not provide a human interface for viewing or other client tasks are referred to as MRAs ‚Äì they provide retrieval but no other client functions. Traditionally and in internet standards (such as the recent RFC 5598) these are referred to as a type of MUA, because they are client-side and hence outside the scope of internet standards, and indeed many MUAs perform MRA functions. However, traditional Unix email readers such as elm, Pine, or mutt would often not include MRA functions (or only optionally), reading email that had already been delivered to a mailbox file (formally, delivered by an MDA). Broadly and traditionally, any program that transfers mail between the ends (all server-side functions) is an MTA. More finely and more recently, the endpoints of the chain have been distinguished, with the initial client-server step referred to as submission, and the final server-client step referred to as delivery. The motivation for distinguishing the MSA role has largely been security, with MUA-MSA interactions (initial submission) receiving greater scrutiny than MTA-MTA (server-server) transfers.

Their means of transport is mainly by bicycles. The village has no electricity, and insufficient water supply from rained water points. There is one primary and one secondary school. When there is a full moon, they dance traditional dances. The available medical facility is a small clinic that is too small to accommodate villagers in a large numbers. Villagers tend to use traditional medicine in case of illness as sometimes the clinic runs out of medicines, so the percentage of cholera is higher than elsewhere in Republic of Congo.

It originally weighed , and was later cut to a cushion-shaped brilliant, which is currently on display at the Mine Museum in Kimberley. The discovery of diamonds in South Africa led to the Kimberley Diamond Rush, and marked the beginning of the Mineral Revolution. Discovery and identification The Eureka Diamond was found near Hopetown on the Orange River by a 15 year old boy named Erasmus Stephanus Jacobs in 1867. Soon afterward, Schalk Van Niekerk entrusted the stone to John O'Reilly, who took it to Colesberg to inquire as to its nature and value. The stone came under the view of the acting Civil Commissioner Lorenzo Boyes, who on seeing that the stone cut glass declared: \\"I believe it to be a diamond.\\" The stone was then sent by mail in an ordinary paper envelope to Dr. William Guybon Atherstone, the colony's foremost mineralogist, in Grahamstown. Atherstone confirmed that it was a 21.25 carat (4.250 g) diamond (although some sources put the weight at 24 carats (4.800 g). ). First purchase to current time The Eureka was put on display at the 1867 Paris Exhibition, although some sources claim that this was a glass replica, and that the real diamond was sent on to Windsor for inspection by Queen Victoria. On its return to South Africa, the Eureka was bought for ¬£500 by the Governor of the Cape Colony, Sir Philip Wodehouse. Sir Philip took it with him to the United Kingdom, where it remained for 100 years, during which time it was cut. On 16 April 1946, the Eureka was sold in London at a Christie's public auction as part of a bangle, for ¬£5,700.

Four wins followed including the Group 3 Media Cup and Group 3 Golden Mile where he beat the likes of Sir Lincoln, Terrorway and Mr Feelgood in a blistering time of 1.51.4. In his next start he was beaten an eyelash by Smoken Up in the Group 1 Len Smith Mile. A couple of placings behind Make Mine Cullen closed out the season for him. At seven years Captain Joy entered his seven-year-old season with much anticipation following a great preparation. The major Victorian Cups followed by the Interdominions in Sydney were his initial goals. He headed up to Queensland with the Group 1 Queensland Pacing Championships in mind. He finished 3rd in this race behind Washakie. Making his way back to Victoria he suffered a minor leg injury which hasn't ruined his season but did rule him out until after the Interdominions. He should return to racing in April/May 2013.

In 2019, he and Rob Epstein were nominated for an Academy Award for their work in the documentary film End Game. Career Jeffrey Friedman grew up in New York City, where his mother was an actor and his father taught undergraduate English literature and edited and published a small literary magazine. He began studying acting when he was nine, and at twelve, he acted professionally in two off-Broadway productions. He played Emil in \\"Emil and the Detectives\\" and a schoolboy on the first day of integration in Little Rock, Arkansas, in \\"Black Monday\\" by Reginald Rose. Friedman began his film training by apprenticing in the editing rooms of such films as Marjoe (Academy Award, Documentary Feature, 1972) and William Friedkin's The Exorcist (1973). Other early credits include the pole-vault segment directed by Arthur Penn and edited by Dede Allen for Visions of Eight (1973) about the 1972 Munich Olympics, and Raging Bull (Academy Award, Film Editing, 1980), edited by Thelma Schoonmaker and directed by Martin Scorsese. Friedman has been making films with Rob Epstein since 1987, when they formed the production company Telling Pictures in San Francisco, California. Friedman and Epstein's first film together was Common Threads: Stories from the Quilt, inspired by the NAMES Project AIDS Memorial Quilt. Narrated by Dustin Hoffman, Common Threads recounts the first decade of AIDS in America through stories of five individuals featured in the Quilt. The film won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature for Common Threads in 1990 as well as a Peabody Award. Common Threads was preserved by the Academy Film Archive, in conjunction with Milestone Films and Outfest, in 2019. Their film The Celluloid Closet, based on the book by film historian Vito Russo, depicts a 100-year history of homosexual characters in Hollywood movies. Narrated by Lily Tomlin, The Celluloid Closet had its world premiere at the Venice Film Festival and was featured at the Toronto, New York, and Sundance Film Festivals (at which it received the juried Freedom of Expression Award) and at numerous international festivals, including Berlin, Tokyo, and Sydney. It received a Peabody Award and a duPont-Columbia journalism award alongside a News & Documentary Emmy for directing. In 2000, they directed and produced Paragraph 175, a film that explores the untold history of homosexuals during the Nazi regime in Europe. Narrated by Rupert Everett and filmed in Germany, France and Spain, it had its US premiere at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2000, where it was awarded the documentary Grand Jury Prize for directing, followed by a European premiere at the Berlin Film Festival in February, where it won a FIPRESCI award (F√©d√©ration Internationale de la Presse Cin√©matographique). They wrote, directed, and co-produced Howl (2010), starring James Franco as the poet Allen Ginsberg, featuring Jon Hamm, David Strathairn, Mary-Louise Parker, Jeff Daniels, Alessandro Nivola, Treat Williams, and Bob Balaban. Howl, which was executive produced by Gus Van Sant, premiered on opening night at the Sundance Film Festival, followed by the Berlin and London International Film Festivals. It was released theatrically and on home video by Oscilloscope Laboratories in the US and internationally by The Match Factory. Howl received a 2011 Freedom of Expression Award from the National Board of Review.

Radio signals were received from their aircraft for 12 hours after their departure from Sydney, but despite a number of purported sightings in New Zealand, and many land searches in the intervening years, no trace of the aviators or their aircraft has ever been found.  Lieutenant John Moncrieff  John Robert Moncrieff was a New Zealander by adoption, being born at Lerwick in the Shetland Islands on 22 September 1894. Educated at Leith Academy in Scotland, he emigrated to New Zealand early at the age of 16 and trained as a motor engineer.HOOD, Captain George ‚Äì Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand He enlisted in the armed forces in December 1917, and took a flying course with the Canterbury (NZ) Aviation Company at the Sockburn aerodrome (later renamed Wigram Aerodrome). Qualifying for his wings after the 1918 Armistice brought an end to the First World War, he resumed his former position as second in charge in a motor garage in Wellington.Rudge, C.J., 2001, 'Missing! Aircraft missing in New Zealand 1928‚Äì2000', Adventure Air, Lyttelton, New Zealand,  Captain George Hood  George Hood was born on 24 June 1891 in Masterton, the principal town of the Wairarapa district in the south-eastern part on the North Island of New Zealand. Educated in Masterton, he was the son of a local farmer and was fascinated with flying from boyhood.Hood Aerodrome ‚Äì Masterton District Council The First World War provided the opportunity for him to become an aviator. Leaving New Zealand in 1914 as a sergeant with the 9th (Wellington East Coast) Squadron of the Wellington Mounted Rifles Regiment, Hood transferred to the Army Service Corps in Egypt. He saw service with the New Zealand Expeditionary Force in Egypt and France. At the end of 1916 he transferred to the Royal Flying Corps, qualifying as a service pilot on 13 October 1917. Thirteen days later he was seriously injured in a crash while flying a DH5, which resulted in his lower right leg being amputated. Despite this he maintained an interest in aviation, and took every opportunity to continue flying on his return to New Zealand.  The Trans-Tasman attempt in context  Moncrieff had been wanting to fly the Tasman Sea for some time. In 1925 the Southland Times newspaper announced that Moncrieff was to \\"attempt a flight from Australia to New Zealand in a four- seater, 450 hp open-sea reconnaissance machine made by William Beardmore and Company\\". It was estimated about ¬£8,500 would be needed to purchase the aircraft and to cover expenses, but little came of this proposal and Moncreiff's project lapsed for the time being. However, in 1927 several notable ocean crossing flights were successfully completed. In May Charles Lindbergh won the Orteig Prize by flying non-stop 3,600 miles/5,800 km. from New York to Paris in a single-engined Ryan monoplane;Lindbergh, C.A., 1953, 'Spirit of St. Louis', John Murray, Albemarle St, London in June, lieutenants Lester J. Maitland and Albert Hergenberger flew 2,400 miles/3,860 km. from Oakland, California to Honolulu, Hawaii in a three-engined Fokker C-2 named 'Bird of Paradise'. Then, in October, Captain Dieudonne Costes and Lieutenant Commander Joseph Le Brix flew 2125 miles/3,420 km. across the South Atlantic from Senegal to Port Natal in Brazil in a single-engined Breguet XIX.World Aviation in 1927 AERONAUTICS: Satisfaction ‚Äì TIME These flights raised aviation's profile and generated considerable interest among the general public.  Preparations  After Lindbergh's flight, Moncrieff again proposed a trans-Tasman flight. On gaining some financial backing from an uncle, Moncrieff secured the assistance of Captain Ivan Kight, a well-known barrister and solicitor from Dannevirke, a rural town in the Tararua District. Kight had qualified as a pilot in 1916 and, like Moncrieff and Hood, was a founding member of the New Zealand Air Force, constituted as part of the Territorial Force (New Zealand) in 1923. Kight became heavily involved in raising finance, organising the flight and dealing with the Australian and New Zealand governments. Hood, who at the time made a living driving a taxi in Masterton, came into the scheme at a later date, finding generous support from people in the Wairarapa. As the subscription list grew, Kight cabled Ryan Airlines Inc. in California for quotations on an aircraft similar to that used by Lindbergh during his trans-Atlantic flight. After Lindbergh's flight, Moncrieff, Kight and Hood felt confident that a Ryan monoplane would be suitable for the 1,430 mile/2,300 km Tasman flight, even though Lindbergh's custom-built Spirit of St. Louis differed significantly from the production version of the Ryan Brougham that was ordered for the Tasman flight.  The Aotearoa  The aircraft ordered for the flight was a slightly modified early model Ryan B-1 Brougham high-wing monoplane, powered by a 220 hp/165 kW nine-cylinder air- cooled Wright J-5 radial engine. The standard aircraft had five seats, arranged as two pairs front and rear, with a single fifth seat behind the rear pair; but to give the necessary range an extra fuel tank was fitted in the cabin in the place normally occupied by the front left seat, giving a total fuel capacity of 200 gallons/900 litres, and a flight duration of about 20 hours. The extra fuel tank created an unforeseen problem as it precluded any chance of pilots changing places in the air. This restricted the control of the aircraft to one person for the duration of the flight, and meant any other crew members were essentially passengers. The aircraft was named Aotearoa ‚Äì usually translated as \\"the land of the long white cloud\\" ‚Äì as the most widely known and commonly accepted MƒÅori name for New Zealand.AOTEAROA ‚Äì Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand It was registered G-AUNZ, thus referencing both countries of departure and destination in its official designation. The Aotearoa was reassembled at Point Cook, Melbourne after delivery and was test- flown by Moncrieff on 29 December 1927. On 2 January Aotearoa took off for Richmond, near Sydney, piloted by Moncrieff and with Hood, Kight and Aircraftman F. Ward from No 1 Squadron of the Royal Australian Air Force on board. Several hours later they landed near Bong Bong, an hour short of their destination and uncertain of their position. During the flight they believed they were sending radio messages, but found on landing that their radio had not been working at all. On arrival at Richmond the following day, the engine was checked and adjusted, and the radio and generator overhauled. After a further short test flight on 7 January, Moncrieff ordered the aircraft to be fuelled for the flight to New Zealand. While all these preparations were going on there were a number of exchanges between the Australian and New Zealand governments over the suitability of the Aotearoa for the flight. In September 1927 the Australian aviation authorities had prohibited a Lieutenant K. M . Frewen from attempting a flight from Hobart, Tasmania to Bluff unless Frewen used a seaplane, in the belief that a landplane was not suitable for long- distance flights over water. The Australian federal authorities then went further when they announced that they \\"intended to prevent the carrying of passengers in any machine that was not either a seaplane, a flying boat, or an amphibian on any flight over the sea for a greater distance than 50 miles\\". The Aotearoa was a landplane, with no ability to land on the sea. After a somewhat confused and confusing exchange of messages, the matter was finally clarified on 3 January, when the Australians announced that a veto on the flight had been lifted after an exchange of cables with the New Zealand government. It had always been the intention that the aircraft would carry only two people on the Tasman flight. As Moncrieff had been the only person to pilot the Aotearoa, and the trip was his idea, he was the obvious choice as pilot. On 6 January, Kight and Hood tossed a coin to decide who would be the second crewman, with Hood winning the toss. The flight was expected to take about 14 hoursToday in History  NZHistory.net.nz, New Zealand history online so a take-off in the early morning hours was necessary to enable a landing in daylight at Trentham Racecourse, the chosen destination in the Hutt Valley north of Wellington. With the aircraft and the crew ready, and the way cleared by the aviation authorities, attention turned to the weather. On the evening of 9 January, conditions were assessed as 'particularly favourable' and Moncrieff and Hood went to Richmond to prepare the aircraft. After further weather information from New Zealand and ships at sea, they decided to take off on their flight.  The flight  The engine was started at 02:00 Sydney time on Tuesday 10 January 1928, but an over-supply of engine oil caused oil to spray on to the windscreen. This was quickly fixed, but press reporters insisting on last-minute interviews further delayed take-off and the Aotearoa did not become airborne until 02:44 (05:14 New Zealand time), immediately turning on course for New Zealand. The take-off on the Tasman flight was only the aircraft's fifth since being reassembled after delivery. Thirty-two minutes later, at 05:46 NZ time, the officer of the watch on the trans-Tasman steamer Maunganui, 12 miles east of Sydney Heads, heard \\"the soft regular whirr\\" of an aircraft engine passing overhead, although he did not see the aircraft itself. The timing and the position of the steamer indicated an aircraft ground speed of 90 mph/145 km/h, about right for the intended flight. For simplicity, Moncrieff and Hood had planned to fly a rhumb line course, intending to make landfall at Farewell Spit at the western entrance to Cook Strait. This was not the shortest course ‚Äì that would have required more complicated navigation to fly a great circle course ‚Äì but the difference over the trans-Tasman flight was not prohibitive. Unexpected winds could cause a drift north or south of the intended course, making an exact landfall unlikely, but the Aotearoa carried no flight instruments that could detect or compensate for such a drift. The radio had no navigational capability or function. Arrangements for radio contact were for the aircraft to send out a continuous tone for five minutes every quarter of an hour, as the pilots had only a rudimentary knowledge of Morse code. This schedule was not adhered to, for the tone was heard for longer periods at irregular intervals. At 17:22 NZ time, when the aircraft had been in the air for just over 12 hours, and should have been within about 200 miles of New Zealand, signals from the Aotearoa ceased abruptly.  The wait  Excitement mounted in New Zealand during the day, and by early evening an estimated 10,000 people had arrived at Trentham to greet the airmen, including Dorothy Moncrieff and Laura Hood, the aviators' wives. With the cessation of radio signals hopefulness gave way to anxiety, although the relatively poor reliability of airborne radio at the time did not necessarily mean that loss of signal equalled the loss of the aircraft. Searchlights were used to illuminate the clouds that were building up, and rockets were still being sent up at 01:40 on 11 January, but the crowd waited in vain. Moncrieff, Hood, and the Aotearoa were never seen or heard from again.  Sightings and the searches  Search activity for Hood and Moncrieff drawn on 1885 map of New Zealand There were many reports of supposed sightings of the aircraft during the evening and night of 10 to 11 January, of varying degrees of credibility. Most claimed to see the lights of the Aotearoa, although Kight affirmed the aircraft carried no navigation lights or flares, and the only source of light apart from the aircraft's exhaust was a small pocket torch that would not be seen at any distance. Some of the most apparently reliable sightings could be interpreted as the Aotearoa making landfall north of the intended track near Cape Egmont, tracking along the Southern Taranaki coast, and then cutting across the South Taranaki Bight to the coast near Paekakariki, intending to round Cape Terawhiti and fly up Wellington Harbour to the Hutt Valley. This would have been a valid scenario if the aircraft had drifted north of its intended trans-Tasman course. Starting on 11 January, air, sea and land searches were carried out for many days in the hope of finding the aviators alive at sea, or on a remote beach, or at least of finding some wreckage that might indicate their fate. Nothing was found at the time. Many land searches have been made since then, mostly centring on Mount Stokes, at the highest point in the rugged bush-covered Marlborough Sounds area, based on a number of supposed sightings in the area. No evidence has ever been found of the Aotearoa's wreckage, or any other trace of the aviators. A chance sighting of what may have been plane wreckage in dense bush near Totaranui in what is now Abel Tasman National Park by youths in the 1960s led to a full-scale search of the area in 2013. No wreckage was found.Anderson, C. \\"Lost in the long white cloud,\\" stuff.co.nz 14 July 2013. Retrieved 13 September 2013. The occurrence of supposed sightings around the time and approximate place of an expected arrival mirrored generally similar events after the first attempted Paris-New York flight by Nungesser and Coli in May 1927, where many reports of sightings were made in North America, and land searches are still carried out from time to time.  Legacy  The Aotearoa was the first aircraft to go missing in or near New Zealand. While other aircraft had crashed, until Moncrieff and Hood's flight, none were lost without trace. In 1931 the Masterton aerodrome was renamed Hood Aerodrome, the name it still bears today. A number of streets throughout New Zealand are named 'Moncrieff' or 'Hood' as memorials to the pioneers.  The first successful flight  On 11 September 1928 two Australians, Charles Kingsford Smith and Charles Ulm, achieved what Hood and Moncrieff had died attempting, when they landed the Southern Cross at Wigram, Christchurch.

He was the eldest son of Domnitor Alexandru Ioan Cuza, by his mistress Maria Catargi-Obrenoviƒá, and adopted by Cuza's wife Elena Rosetti-Cuza. His father's rule was the earliest political union between the two Danubian Principalities (Wallachia and Moldavia), which was to form the Kingdom of Romania in 1881. When Alexandru Ioan was ousted and replaced with Carol of Hohenzollern (1866), Alexandru Al. Ioan followed him into exile. He settled back in Romania after his father's death, attempting to create a current of opinion against Carol. He later helped journalists Alexandru Beldiman and Grigore Ventura in founding the anti-Carlist newspaper AdevƒÉrul. Through their biological mother, Alexandru and his brother Dimitrie were half-brothers of Milan I Obrenoviƒá, the King of Serbia, and of General Radu Catargi. Beginning 1888, when Dimitrie Cuza died, Alexandru was the last surviving direct male heir of the Cuza family. After his death, the Cuza estate, including the manor of Ruginoasa, passed through his widow onto the Moruzis and the BrƒÉtianus. Biography=Adoption scandal Sa»ôa Cuza and his younger brother Dimitrie were born from a liaison between the Domnitor and his mistress Maria, the Moldavian-born aristocrat, previously married into the House of Obrenoviƒá. Their maternal grandfather was Costin Catargi(u), a great landowner and Moldavian separatist, who had opposed Cuza's arrival to the throne in 1859. Theodor RƒÉ»ôcanu, \\"Ex-regina Natalia a Serbiei n'a murit?\\", in Universul Literar, Nr. 21/1938, p.7 (digitized by the Babe»ô-Bolyai University Transsylvanica Online Library) They were also half- brothers of Milan, the future Serbian King, who was Maria's eldest son.Filitti (2005), p.5; Kellogg, p.31 On the Catargiu side, their uncle Alexandru and cousin Alexis were noted career diplomats.Filitti (2005), p.5-6 Domnitor Cuza's legal marriage, to Elena \\"Doamna\\", produced no heirs. The ruler and his legitimate wife were virtually separated by 1866, and, sources attest, were at best friendly to each other.Chiper, p.173-174 Roxana Roseti, \\"Elena Cuza, minunata »ôi demna principesƒÉ\\", in Jurnalul Na»õional, March 1, 2004 The boys were successively adopted by the reigning couple: Alexandru on (that is, shortly after the Domnitor had effected a coup, deposing his critics in Parliament), Dimitrie on November 17/5, 1865.Chiper, p.173, 175; Kellogg, p.31 Both boys were baptized Romanian Orthodox, having as their godfathers the Domnitors associates, Cezar Librecht (the Postmaster General) and Iordache Lambrino.Nicoleta Roman, \\"Copilul »ôi familia √Æn Valahia primei jumƒÉtƒÉ»õi a secolului al XIX-lea\\", in Lumini»õa DumƒÉnescu (ed.), 9 Ipostaze ale copilƒÉriei rom√¢ne»ôti: istorii cu »ôi despre copiii de ieri »ôi de azi, International Book Access, Cluj-Napoca, 2008, p.94. Their acceptance into the family came just as Cuza's authoritarian reign descended into administrative chaos, and as the monarch himself was calming his nervous states with alcohol and womanizing.Kellogg, p.12-13 The adoption act was especially alarming for the growing camp of anti-Cuzists, many of whom were dedicated supporters of rule by a foreign prince. As noted by scholar Frederick Kellogg: \\"On some Romanian palates, Cuza's amorous affair smacked of a scheme to establish a native dynasty with bastards as heirs to the crown.\\"Kellogg, p.13 Among those who suggest that Cuza intended to make Sa»ôa his successor is researcher Alexandru Lapedatu, who also concluded that, at the time, Cuza was overreaching, isolated, \\"surrounded and adored by his favorites\\". Dan Mircea MazƒÉlu, \\"Aspecte ale domniei lui Al. I. Cuza √Æn opera istoricului Alexandru Lapedatu\\" , in the December 1 University of Alba Iulia Annales. Series Historica, 13 (2009), p.149 According to historian Barbara Jelavich, while some in Cuza's party did look to Maria Obrenoviƒá's sons as the natural successors to the throne, \\"there was so much opposition to the idea of a native prince, as well as to Cuza himself, that this alternative had little chance of success.\\"Barbara Jelavich, Russia and the Formation of the Romanian National State, 1821-1878, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge etc., 2004, p.147. She continues: \\"By 1865 Cuza had won a formidable array of opponents on both the right and left.\\" Gender historian Nicoleta Roman uses the Cuza family as a study case of illegitimacy and adultery in the two principalities. She notes that the adoption was probably accepted by Elena after her husband's pressures. This is also reported by military historian Constantin Chiper, according to whom Elena Cuza was at first \\"revolted\\" by the monarch's requests, and remained \\"profoundly depressed\\" by his affair.Chiper, p.174 The truth concerning Sa»ôa's birth was a matter of public record, and a subject of great irritation for Elena's clan, the Rosettis. According to Roman: \\"Contemporaries knew about [the liaison] and did not refrain from condemning the great prince's immoral behavior, nor from turning the subject into a scandal where the mother was the main culprit.\\" Nevertheless, both Alexandru and Dimitrie were officially introduced as orphans. In one such version of events, they were presented as Bucharest children, rescued from the 1864 flood.Chiper, p.173-174; Filitti (2005), p.5 According to Cuza's own account, the boys had \\"no known parents\\"‚Äîthis definition is preserved in Cuza's testament of January 1873, whereby Elena and the two male heirs are each granted a third of the Cuza family estate.Filitti (2006), p.7-8 The document nominated Metropolitan-Primate Calinic Miclescu and Efrem Ghermani as, respectively, caretaker of the estate and tutor of the Cuza boys.Filitti (2006), p.8 With Elena's acquiescence, Maria had been by Alexandru Ioan's side during much of his career, and was found with him when, in February 1866, a \\"monstrous coalition\\" conspiracy deposed and exiled Cuza. Sorin Semeniuc, \\"Cuza a ie»ôit prin budoar din istorie\\" , in Ie»ôeanul, January 4, 2005Filitti (2006), p.7; Kellogg, p.13 During Cuza's arrest, the conspirators separated Cuza and Maria from Elena, who was left with the two boys.Chiper, p.175 In the end, Cuza was pressured into exile. Elena decided to join him, even as the Rosettis (some of whom had participated in the coup), asked her to sue for a divorce. The Cuzas moved periodically, from Austria-Hungary to the Kingdom of Italy, then to the German Empire, at Heidelberg.Chiper, p.175-176 Although Cuza was no longer welcome in Romania, his wife and the two boys made occasional returns to their domain at Ruginoasa.Grigora»ô, p.14 Maria Obrenoviƒá followed the Cuzas into exile, accompanied by her nephew Efrem Ghermani.Filitti (2006), p.7 In Vienna, she gave birth to another son, Radu. Purportedly fathered by a Russian officer (Konstantinovich), he was given the family name Catargi, and grew up to become a Romanian Land Forces general. Entrepreneur and political adventurer The deposed ruler died in May 1873 at Heidelberg, leaving his last will to be contested by a collateral Cuza line. Elena, Alexandru and Dimitrie moved to France, sharing their house with the Domnitors former secretary, Frenchman Arthur Baligot de Beyne.Chiper, p.176 In 1875, a Bondrea Cuza and a Mrs. Figa opened a legal case against the adoption at the Suceava County court, and implied that they were going to expose Sa»ôa and Dimitrie's true parentage; in the end, the plaintiffs failed to attend the procedures, and the case was annulled. A year later, Maria Obrenoviƒá, having been told that she had cancer, committed suicide aged 41. Her belongings were left to Milan, Maria's legitimate son, who renounced all claims to them in 1879.Filitti (2005), p.5 Elena Cuza continued to care for her husband's progeny, creating a family home for them at Ruginoasa, where they were often joined by her relatives, the Lambrino family.RƒÉ»ôcanu, \\"Ruginoasa\\", p.6 In the mid-1870s, the Cuza children again left Ruginoasa to pursue their studies abroad. Alexandru Al. Ioan himself graduated from the University of Paris Faculty of Law, and took some additional lectures in History. The Ruginoasa manor was again left unattended until 1879, when, as the new co-owner of the place, Alexandru took over the administrative chores. An inveterate card player, he gambled away much of its revenue. During those years, his Obrenoviƒá half-brother (married to the Romanian Natalia Ke»ôco) had taken power in the Principality of Serbia, replacing his assassinated uncle Mihailo III; Milan himself ultimately abdicated in 1889. Alexandru Al. Ioan Cuza, obeying his adoptive mother's wish,Grigora»ô, p.15 also entered politics. His younger brother, who suffered a debilitating disease of the lungs, was living in Paris, and showed no interest in politics. Alexandru's interest was in generating opposition against Cuza's foreign-born replacement, Carol of Hohenzollern (King of Romania after 1881). As \\"Prince Cuza\\", Alexandru Al. Ioan participated in the election of January 1888, winning a seat in the Assembly, for Mehedin»õi County, Third College. He placed first after ballotage, having rallied with the opposition Conservatives.\\"Balotagele Colegiului III\\", in Epoca, January 28 (February 9), 1888, p.1 He soon after relinquished his seat. This decision is attributed by Chiper to political adversity: \\"the name he carried was a danger for his father's enemies who [...] launched on a furious campaign against his person\\". In a letter he sent from Cannes on February 13, Cuza noted that he would have wanted to represent the peasantry and champion their cause, but that the Assembly Presidency was likely to be taken by one who had betrayed his father.\\"Scrisoarea Prin»õului Alexandru Cuza\\", in Epoca, February 28 (20), 1888, p.1 In August 1888, Cuza financed AdevƒÉrul, an anti-Hohenzollern sheet that had first seen print in 1871. Florentina Tone, \\"Adevƒïrul la Bucure»ôti\\", in AdevƒÉrul, December 17, 2008 Published by Beldiman and Grigore Ventura, it stated as its main goal the \\"foreign dynasty\\"'s removal, demanding elective monarchy and the universal male suffrage. Reputedly, Alexandru considered himself a likely candidate to the position of elective monarch. Later in 1888, a widespread anti-Carlist riot shook the Romanian countryside, and myths about Sa»ôa's direct involvement began to spread. A peasant rebel, who escaped into the Principality of Bulgaria, spoke about a shady connection between the Cuzas, as proponents of land reform, and Russian interests in Romania. He claimed that: \\"Cuza's son has visited the Tsar of Russia and the latter ordered him to write to all villages so that they should kill their boyars and demand their rights [...]. Russia's emperor [...] gave money to Cuza's son, who went and bought two storage rooms full of wheat in CƒÉlƒÉra»ôi, that the inhabitants were supposed to divide among them, but the boyars hid [that wheat].\\" Cornel Coman, \\"Cum s-a ratat rƒÉscoala, √Æn CƒÉlƒÉra»ôi\\", in Express de CƒÉlƒÉra»ôi, March 4, 2012 According to anti-Carlist journalist Alexandru Beldiman, who was soon to be Cuza's political associate, the rebellion was entirely instigated by the Russians. Some time later, Sa»ôa Cuza withdrew from public life, and settled in Ruginoasa. He had by become the only recognized male heir: also at Ruginoasa, Dimitrie had shot himself after an unhappy love affair.Grigora»ô, p.15; RƒÉ»ôcanu, \\"Ruginoasa\\", p.6. A slightly conflicting account in Chiper, p.176 As the one surviving son, Alexandru enjoyed ownership over most of Ruginoasa and the traditional Cuza demesne of Barbo»ôi. Against Elena Cuza's wish, Alexandru married fellow aristocrat Maria Moruzi (born 1863). The beautiful daughter of Alecu Moruzi and Adela (a Sturdza noblewoman), she was described by her contemporaries as a prototype of 19th-century Moldavian aristocracy. Simina Stan, \\"Casa Vasile Pogor: o re»ôedin»õƒÉ boiereascƒÉ din Ia»ôii secolului al XIX- lea\\", in Jurnalul Na»õional, September 12, 2009 He bequeathed to her his entire share in the Cuza estate. The decision was controversial, not least of all because Maria's ancestor, an 18th-century Moldavian Prince by the name of Constantine Mourousis, had put to death Sa»ôa's own ancestor, Ioni»õƒÉ Cuza.Grigora»ô, p.15; RƒÉ»ôcanu, \\"Ruginoasa\\", p.7 Already diagnosed with heart trouble, Alexandru fell ill with tuberculosis. According to some, his disease was a quickly progressing form, contracted during his wedding voyage. Others however note that both Alexandru and Dimitrie had suffered from \\"chest illness\\" for many years, and had taken little care of themselves. In late 1889, six months into their marriage, the couple was visiting the Kingdom of Spain. The main Cuza line was abruptly ended when Alexandru Al. Ioan died in Madrid.Chiper, p.176; RƒÉ»ôcanu, \\"Rugioasa\\", p.6 His body was transported back to Ruginoasa, and buried alongside the tombs of his father and brother. Posterity As noted in 1938 by publicist Theodor RƒÉ»ôcanu (a distant relative of the figures involved), Sa»ôa Cuza made little or no effort to provide for Elena Cuza, and never \\"returned in kind her mother's love\\". She was tolerated for a while on Ruginoasa premises, before Maria Moruzi-Cuza pressured her into leaving,Chiper, p.176; Grigora»ô, p.15 and then took her to court over the validity of Alexandru's last will.RƒÉ»ôcanu, \\"Ruginoasa\\", p.7 The former consort of the Domnitor died in 1909, having spent her final years in Piatra Neam»õ town.Chiper, p.177 Although the Cuza line was entirely extinguished with all collateral relatives dying childless, it was still invoked as a means to earn popularity within the anti-Carlist movement. During the 1890s, agitator Alexandru Bogdan-Pite»ôti was passing himself off as Cuza's son, in what was probably a bid to earn the peasants' attention.Paul Cernat, Avangarda rom√¢neascƒÉ »ôi complexul periferiei: primul val, Cartea Rom√¢neascƒÉ, Bucharest, 2007, p.43. ; Constantin Coroiu, \\"Pluta de naufragiu (2)\\" , in Evenimentul, December 30, 2002 As of 2011, the last known Cuza descendant was Dimitrie Callimachi, who inherits the claim from his ancestor Maria Cuza, sister of the Domnitor, but states that \\"the monarchy is an antiquated institution in Romania.\\" Alexandra Jeles, \\"Descendentul lui Cuza: Regalitatea este o institu»õie depƒÉ»ôitƒÉ\\", in Rom√¢nia LiberƒÉ, May 10, 2011 Another public scandal involving Maria Moruzi took place ca. 1897, when it became known that she was pursuing an affair with the young engineer Ion I. C. BrƒÉtianu (later a major political figure). This controversy had its own political connotations: BrƒÉtianu's father, Ion BrƒÉtianu, was a National Liberal representative in the 1866 conspiracy to topple Cuza. Rumors leaked to the press and the affair, together with the running Cuza‚ÄìMoruzi lawsuit, created a sensation: AdevƒÉrul itself began referring to the estate as Ru»ôinoasa (\\"Place of Shame\\"). The affair resulted in an unwanted pregnancy, and Maria was compelled to marry BrƒÉtianu. Their marriage broke local taboos: it lasted just one day, ending in as hasty a divorce. The couple's son was Gheorghe I. BrƒÉtianu, later a historian and politician, who lived at Ruginoasa until 1938. His mother shared ownership of the manor, and, in 1912, sold the corresponding property in Barbo»ôi to socialite Elena Volenti. Maria Moruzi died in 1921, having by then served as president of the Romanian Red Cross. The Ruginoasa buildings, part of which had been donated to Elena Cuza's Caritatea Hospital, were heavily damaged during the World War II air raids on Romania. In 1945, financial pressures led Gheorghe BrƒÉtianu to sell the Ruginoasa domain, which eventually became an administrative complex of the Romanian Railways Company (CFR). Under communist rule, the state nationalized and retained it as cultural patrimony. During 2003, CFR unsuccessfully sued the Romanian state for damages.

After the four-year cycle of Principalship of the Samavesam of Telugu Baptist Churches ended in the academic year 1989‚Äì1990, the Andhra Evangelical Lutheran Church's cycle of Principalship began. Besides Victor Paul, there were four other faculty from this Church Society teaching in the College at that time, namely, B. W. David Raju, AELC, B. C. Paul, AELC, G. Sampurna Rao, AELC, and C. Yesupadam, AELC. Since the participating Church agency decides the name of the Principal, the Board of Governors of the College left the decision to the Andhra Evangelical Lutheran Church, then under the presidency of K. Nathaniel, AELC, which chose to nominate Victor Paul to the Principalship of the ecumenical seminary for a term of four years.Cf. Andhra Christian Theological College Then Chairperson of the Board of Governors of the College, S. E. Krupa Rao of the Convention of Baptist Churches of Northern Circars appointed Victor Paul as Principal of the College for a term of four years. As Principal, Victor Paul was able to prove himself as an able Administrator following the footsteps of his predecessors and advocated the Ordination of women. One of the early women graduates of the United Theological College, Bangalore, Johanna Rose Ratnavathi, AELC,Peoples Reporter, Volume 26, Issue 5, 2013, p.8. and a founding member of the Association of Theologically Trained Women in India was a three-time Dean of Women during the tenure of Victor Paul. In the final phase of Victor Paul's tenure as Principal, he contested the bishopric of the Andhra Evangelical Lutheran Church and proceeded on leave from the College. To fill the vacancy, the AELC then nominated Victor Paul's companion G. Sampurna Rao, AELC, as Principal of the College. Church leadership When the term of K. Nathaniel, AELC, as President of the Andhra Evangelical Lutheran Church ended, Victor Paul contested and was elected in 1993 as the ninth president of the Andhra Evangelical Lutheran Church headquartered in Guntur.Cf. Andhra Evangelical Lutheran Church In 1997, before Victor Paul's term ended, he returned to Secunderabad to teach at the Andhra Christian Theological College then headed by R. Yesurathnam, CSI. Victor Paul retired in 2000.

Blizzard Entertainment, Inc and Vivendi Games, Inc., 629 F.3d 928 (9th Cir. 2010), is a case decided by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. At the district court level, MDY had been found liable under theories of copyright and tort law for selling software that contributed to the breach of Blizzard's End User License Agreement (EULA) and Terms of Use (ToU) governing the World of Warcraft video game software.MDY Industries, LLC v. Blizzard Entertainment, Inc, Order (D. Ariz. Jul. 14, 2008). The court's ruling was appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which reversed the district court in part, upheld in part, and remanded for further proceedings. The Court of Appeals ruled that for a software licensee's violation of a contract to constitute copyright infringement, there must be a nexus between the license condition and the licensor‚Äôs exclusive rights of copyright. However, the court also ruled, contrary to Chamberlain v. Skylink, that a finding of circumvention under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act does not require a nexus between circumvention and actual copyright infringement. Background Information Blizzard Entertainment created and operates a popular online world video game known as World of Warcraft (WoW). WoW is a massively multiplayer online role- playing game, in which players control characters and complete a variety of tasks, such as exploring the landscape and performing quests. As players continue to play and succeed in their tasks, their characters gain various talents and skills. Michael Donnelly, the founder of MDY Industries, LLC, created a software bot called Glider to play WoW for its users. Thus, Glider users were able to advance their WoW characters unattended. MDY sought a declaratory judgment that the Glider program did not infringe upon rights owned by Blizzard. Blizzard contended in a counterclaim and a third-party complaint the following seven claims: *tortious interference with contract *contributory copyright infringement *vicarious copyright infringement *violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) *trademark infringement *unfair competition *unjust enrichment Opinion of the District Court On July 14, 2008, Judge David G. Campbell of the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona granted and denied in part the parties' motions for summary judgment. The Court granted summary judgment in favor of Blizzard with respect to MDY's liability for tortious interference, contributory copyright infringement, and vicarious copyright infringement. The court granted summary judgment in favor of MDY on a portion of the DMCA claim and on the unfair competition claim. In its ruling on Blizzard's contributory copyright infringement claims, the district court first considered whether purchasers of WoW were legal \\"owners\\" of the client software. According to 17 U.S.C. ¬ß 117, owners of computer programs are allowed to create copies or adaptations of the computer program if it is an essential step towards utilization of the program.Copyright Law of the United States of America and Related Laws Contained in Title 17 of the United States Code, ¬ß 117. Limitations on exclusive rights: Computer Programs The Court agreed with Blizzard's arguments that WoW purchasers were not legal owners of the game software but instead licensees. As licensees, players are required to make use of the software within the scope of the End User License Agreement. In the terms of that agreement, Blizzard specifically prohibited \\"the use of bots or third-party software to modify the WoW experience.\\" Thus, the Court found that players who use the Glider program violated the ToU and were not licensed to use WoW. As with most software, the client software of WoW is copied during the program's operation from the computer's hard drive to the computer's random access memory (RAM). Citing the prior Ninth Circuit case of MAI Systems Corp. v. Peak Computer, Inc., 991 F.2d 511, 518-19 (9th Cir. 1993), the district court held that RAM copying constituted \\"copying\\" under 17 U.S.C. ¬ß 106.Copyright Law of the United States of America and Related Laws Contained in Title 17 of the United States Code, ¬ß 106. Exclusive rights in copyrighted works The Court found that since the prohibition on botting was a prohibition related to Blizzard's copyright interest in WoW, users of Glider infringed Blizzard's copyright when played the game in violation of the license. The Court believed MDY to be encouraging and profiting from this copyright infringement, and therefore found MDY secondarily liable for the infringement. The district court also ruled that Glider users had violated the Digital Millennium Copyright Act by using Glider to circumvent Blizzard's Warden program, a security application that controls access to the World of Warcraft game environment. Appeal MDY Industries appealed the judgment of the district court, and a judgment was delivered by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals on 14 December 2010. In the ruling, the summary judgment against MDY for contributory copyright infringement was reversed. The court ruled that \\"for a licensee's violation of a contract to constitute copyright infringement, there must be a nexus between the condition and the licensor's exclusive rights of copyright. Here, WoW players do not commit copyright infringement by using Glider in violation of the [terms of use]\\". In the judgment, the Ninth Circuit considered Chamberlain v. Skylink (in the Federal Circuit), but declined to follow that case, stating that \\"were we to follow Chamberlain in imposing an infringement nexus requirement, we would have to disregard the plain language of the statute\\". The court therefore upheld the judgment that MDY violated the provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act against trafficking in copyright circumvention technologies, at least with regard to the dynamic nonliteral elements of Blizzard's content, i.e., those portions provided by the World of Warcraft servers. The summary judgment for tortious contract interference was vacated and remanded to the district court for further consideration because the requirements for summary judgment - that as a matter of law, judgment could only possibly be found in favor of one party even when all disputed facts are considered in a light most favorable to the other party - were not met.

A prop forward, he made over 100 appearances for Gateshead Thunder, and captained the Malta national rugby league team. Career Chris started his rugby career at Blaydon RUFC at 15 years old. Having stints at Newcastle Falcons Academy and representing his county. In 2000 he joined the British Army, Royal Signals Corps. During his six years service he represented the Royal Corps of Signals in both rugby union and league as well as representing the army rugby league at U-21 level and the combined services academy. Chris started his amateur rugby league career at Newcastle Knights ARLFC having two seasons under coach and Gateshead Thunder player Steven Rutherford. Chris then moved to the north east's highest amateur team Gateshead Storm RLFC playing with Storm greats such as Harry Gee and Andrew Pybus. He enjoyed 3 seasons with Gateshead Storm as well as stints with Union sides Blaydon and Winlaton before eventually being given a trial at Gateshead Thunder. RLFC by coach Dave Woods. Chris featured in a few games in the 2007 season most notably receiving man of the match against Celtic Crusaders in the final game of the season, Chris also was rewarded with a one- year contract for the 2008 season. In 2008 Gateshead Thunder, transformed from a bottom of the league side to a National League Two winning side attaining promotion to the newly named Championship. Chris was awarded the most improved player for 2008 and was given a new one-year deal for 2009. Chris started the 2009 season well playing 18 consecutive games scoring his first ever Gateshead Thunder. try against Rochdale Hornets in the Northern Rail Cup and adding to his tally with a well taken try in front of the sky sports cameras against the Sheffield Eagles. Chris spent the last part of the 2009 season as Gateshead's 18th man. Chris finished the 2009 with some positive news, signing a 2-year contract extension and receiving a call up to the Malta national rugby league team for a friendly international against touring English side Bamber Bridge RLFC. Chris made his d√©but for the Malta national rugby league team on 3 October 2009 in the 36‚Äì28 win over Bamber Bridge RLFC and was named vice- captain by caretaker coach Anthony Micallef. Chris also scored his first try for the country and added the extras from the resulting kick. After the holding company of Gateshead Thunder decided to wind up all contract were cancelled, Chris re-signed for the newly formed Gateshead Thunder side to play in Championship One in 2010. In 2010 Chris made 24 appearances for Gateshead Thunder, only missing one game for a Malta fixture against Norway. On 4 June 2010 Parker helped Malta come from 10-0 down mid way through the first half to defeat Norway, 30-20 to take the Rugby League European Federation Bowl at the Victor Tedesco Stadium, Hamrun. In 2011 Chris Parker was named the 2009-2010 Ray Morris Medal Winner by the Malta Rugby League (MRL), commonly known as Maltese Player of the Year. He also took over the reins of the Maltese National Team Captain from the retiring Daniel Grima, the first game under his captaincy saw the Maltese team put in a strong performance in their first game of the European Shield against Germany on 24 July 2011 but unfortunately the German side were too strong for the 15-man Maltese Squad taking the game 36-12, Parker scoring one of the Maltese two tries. In their second game of the Euro Shield Malta faced Norway running away with a 64-24 win missing out on the Euro shield by a points difference of 1. Parker captained Malta to a 24 - 12 victory against Denmark in 2012, the game being the first of a two-game series between the countries. In the second leg in Copenhagen 29 September 2012, Malta took the series with an emphatic 12 - 74 win with Captain Parker amongst the try scorers on the day. In May 2012 after making 5 appearances for Gateshead Thunder Chris decided to call it a day and retire from semi- professional rugby, he returned to his roots and joined North East Conference side Gateshead Storm as player/assistant coach and U13s Head Coach. In his first season back at Gateshead Storm Chris helped them reach the 2012 North East cup final and despite tearing his pectoral away from the bone he picked up the man of the match award against Jarrow Vikings . In 2012 Parker has also stepped up his efforts to help the Malta by setting up the Maltese Exiles, a side made up of Maltese Heritage rugby league players who play in fixtures around the UK in an effort to raise awareness of the MRL, the exiles were 34 - 12 winners in their first ever game against Leeds Akkies, Parker scoring a try in the fixture. Parker then took the Maltese exiles to the Un-official Exiles world Cup held in Leeds (8/09/12) where the Exiles finished 3rd in the Competition losing out to top spot in their group in a thrilling match against Fiji UK. Coaching career In 2012 Parker finished his first season as Head Coach of the Gateshead Storm Under-13s with the Under-13s North East Cup winners and the North East 9s winners to his name and was awarded the 2012 Under-13s Coach of the year at the North East Junior Presentation awards at the stadium of light,Sunderland. Parker was appointed head coach of Newcastle University Rugby League for the students 2012-2013 season and got off to a winning start in his first game beating Liverpool John Moores University 76-0. The Newcastle University side continued on a 10-game unbeaten run seeing off Leeds Mets 2nds 4-19, Edge Hill 18-0, Liverpool 12-20, Sheffield 62-18, Liverpool John Moore 16-23, Leeds Mets 2nds 42-14, Edge Hill 12-22 and a 42-12 victory over Liverpool to seal the league title. The Newcastle side also dispatched Nottingham Trent Uni 16-32 in the quarter finals of the cup but Leeds Met Uni were too strong in the semi-finals, Newcastle losing 60-0. A tough Stan Calvert game saw Newcastle lose to Northumbria University 32-16. During the 2013 pre-season Gateshead Storm Head Coach Gareth Barron relocated to London and Parker was promoted to the Head Coach position of the Gateshead Storm open age side. He would combine this role with that of the U14s to ensure their continued progress. In his first Season in charge of Gateshead Storm Open Age Parker guided his side to the 2013 North East Premier League Leaders' Shield, were crowned 2013 North East Cup Winners with a 24-16 win over Jarrow Vikings before sealing the treble with a 33-16 win again over Jarrow Vikings in the North East Premier Grand Final at Peterlee Pumas, Helford Rd. The Gateshead Storm season continued with a 24-0 bye against Northampton Demons Academy, a 62-12 victory over Telford Raiders and a heartbreaking 28-22 defeat by South West London Chargers in the Harry Jepson Trophy final at Butts Park arena, Coventry. 2013 also saw Chris having a major input into the U14s talent pathway. He coached the South of Tyne to an impressive victory over the North of Tyne. 17 South of Tyne players were selected to join the Tyne & Wear squad to face Durham. Parker also joined the Tyne & Wear squad to help prepare them for the game against Durham, the game ended 4 tries apiece. Parker took control of his first Maltese side when the Malta XIII played 1 Mercian Regt (The British Army) on 8 July 2013 at Melita FC, Pembroke, Malta. Parker took the role of Captain/Coach taking the teams pre-game sessions and making the final call on the teams selection. The Maltese side won a tough game 26-24 with Chris scoring two tries, helping his side win the 2013 DoveCare+Men Summer Trophy. Chris has also been coaching rugby union side Blaydon at U13s (2011‚Äì2012) and U14s (2012‚Äì2013).

The method relies on methods of functional analysis and topology. As well as being used to prove the existence of a solution, direct methods may be used to compute the solution to desired accuracy.  The method  The calculus of variations deals with functionals J:V \\\\to \\\\bar{\\\\mathbb{R}}, where V is some function space and \\\\bar{\\\\mathbb{R}} = \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\cup {\\\\infty}. The main interest of the subject is to find minimizers for such functionals, that is, functions v \\\\in V such that:J(v) \\\\leq J(u)\\\\forall u \\\\in V. The standard tool for obtaining necessary conditions for a function to be a minimizer is the Euler-Lagrange equation. But seeking a minimizer amongst functions satisfying these may lead to false conclusions if the existence of a minimizer is not established beforehand. The functional J must be bounded from below to have a minimizer. This means :\\\\inf{J(u)u\\\\in V} > -\\\\infty.\\\\, This condition is not enough to know that a minimizer exists, but it shows the existence of a minimizing sequence, that is, a sequence (u_n) in V such that J(u_n) \\\\to \\\\inf{J(u)u\\\\in V}. The direct method may broken into the following steps # Take a minimizing sequence (u_n) for J. # Show that (u_n) admits some subsequence (u_{n_k}), that converges to a u_0\\\\in V with respect to a topology \\\\tau on V. # Show that J is sequentially lower semi-continuous with respect to the topology \\\\tau. To see that this shows the existence of a minimizer, consider the following characterization of sequentially lower- semicontinuous functions. :The function J is sequentially lower-semicontinuous if ::\\\\liminf_{n\\\\to\\\\infty} J(u_n) \\\\geq J(u_0) for any convergent sequence u_n \\\\to u_0 in V. The conclusions follows from :\\\\inf{J(u)u\\\\in V} = \\\\lim_{n\\\\to\\\\infty} J(u_n) = \\\\lim_{k\\\\to \\\\infty} J(u_{n_k}) \\\\geq J(u_0) \\\\geq \\\\inf{J(u)u\\\\in V}, in other words :J(u_0) = \\\\inf{J(u)u\\\\in V}.  Details = Banach spaces  The direct method may often be applied with success when the space V is a subset of a separable reflexive Banach space W. In this case the sequential Banach‚ÄìAlaoglu theorem implies that any bounded sequence (u_n) in V has a subsequence that converges to some u_0 in W with respect to the weak topology. If V is sequentially closed in W, so that u_0 is in V, the direct method may be applied to a functional J:V\\\\to\\\\bar{\\\\mathbb{R}} by showing # J is bounded from below, # any minimizing sequence for J is bounded, and # J is weakly sequentially lower semi-continuous, i.e., for any weakly convergent sequence u_n \\\\to u_0 it holds that \\\\liminf_{n\\\\to\\\\infty} J(u_n) \\\\geq J(u_0). The second part is usually accomplished by showing that J admits some growth condition. An example is :J(x) \\\\geq \\\\alpha \\\\lVert x \\\\rVert^q - \\\\beta for some \\\\alpha > 0, q \\\\geq 1 and \\\\beta \\\\geq 0. A functional with this property is sometimes called coercive. Showing sequential lower semi-continuity is usually the most difficult part when applying the direct method. See below for some theorems for a general class of functionals.  Sobolev spaces  The typical functional in the calculus of variations is an integral of the form :J(u) = \\\\int_\\\\Omega F(x, u(x), abla u(x))dx where \\\\Omega is a subset of \\\\mathbb{R}^n and F is a real-valued function on \\\\Omega \\\\times \\\\mathbb{R}^m \\\\times \\\\mathbb{R}^{mn}. The argument of J is a differentiable function u:\\\\Omega \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}^m, and its Jacobian abla u(x) is identified with a mn-vector. When deriving the Euler-Lagrange equation, the common approach is to assume \\\\Omega has a C^2 boundary and let the domain of definition for J be C^2(\\\\Omega, \\\\mathbb{R}^m). This space is a Banach space when endowed with the supremum norm, but it is not reflexive. When applying the direct method, the functional is usually defined on a Sobolev space W^{1,p}(\\\\Omega, \\\\mathbb{R}^m) with p > 1, which is a reflexive Banach space. The derivatives of u in the formula for J must then be taken as weak derivatives. The next section presents two theorems regarding weak sequential lower semi-continuity of functionals of the above type.  Sequential lower semi-continuity of integrals  As many functionals in the calculus of variations are of the form :J(u) = \\\\int_\\\\Omega F(x, u(x), abla u(x))dx, where \\\\Omega \\\\subseteq \\\\mathbb{R}^n is open, theorems characterizing functions F for which J is weakly sequentially lower-semicontinuous in W^{1,p}(\\\\Omega, \\\\mathbb{R}^m) with p \\\\geq 1 is of great importance. In general one has the followingDacorogna, pp. 74-79.: :Assume that F is a function that has the following properties: :# The function (y, A) \\\\mapsto F(x, y, A) is continuous for almost every x \\\\in \\\\Omega. :# The function x \\\\mapsto F(x, y, A) is measurable for every (y, A) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^m \\\\times \\\\mathbb{R}^{mn}. :# There exist a\\\\in L^q(\\\\Omega, \\\\mathbb{R}^{mn}) with H√∂lder conjugate q = \\\\tfrac{p}{p-1} and b \\\\in L^1(\\\\Omega) such that the following inequality holds true for almost every x \\\\in \\\\Omega and every (y, A) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^m \\\\times \\\\mathbb{R}^{mn}: F(x, y, A) \\\\geq \\\\langle a(x) , A \\\\rangle + b(x). Here, \\\\langle a(x) , A \\\\rangle denotes the Frobenius inner product of a(x) and A in \\\\mathbb{R}^{mn}). :If the function A \\\\mapsto F(x, y, A) is convex for almost every x \\\\in \\\\Omega and every y\\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^m, :then J is sequentially weakly lower semi-continuous. When n = 1 or m = 1 the following converse-like theorem holdsDacorogna, pp. 66-74. :Assume that F is continuous and satisfies :: F(x, y, A)  \\\\leq a(x,  y ,  A ) :for every (x, y, A), and a fixed function a(x, y, A) increasing in y and p, and locally integrable in x. If J is sequentially weakly lower semi-continuous, then for any given (x, y) \\\\in \\\\Omega \\\\times \\\\mathbb{R}^m the function A \\\\mapsto F(x, y, A) is convex. In conclusion, when m = 1 or n = 1, the functional J, assuming reasonable growth and boundedness on F, is weakly sequentially lower semi-continuous if, and only if the function A \\\\mapsto F(x, y, A) is convex. If both n and m are greater than 1, it is possible to weaken the necessity of convexity to generalizations of convexity, namely polyconvexity and quasiconvexity.Dacorogna, pp. 87-185.

In 1925, the Ursuline Sisters of the Roman Union sent four European Sisters to carry out educational works in Thailand at the invitation of Archbishop Rene Perros, Head of the Catholic Mission in Siam. In 1926, Sister Marie Bernard Mancel, the second superior of the Ursuline Order in Thailand decided to purchase a piece of land of about 18 rai (just under 3 hectares) with a large house. Mater Dei School was therefore set up and was the only educational institution on Ploenchit Road. Its wooden building had two prominent towers, one housing boarding students while another was the residence of the Sisters with a small chapel located inside. In 1927, the Sisters built a new two-storey school with constructed entirely of teak wood. It was separated by a clean and crystal clear pond from the old building. Classrooms were set up based on the British system, enrolling students from Kindergarten to Form V and comprising two departments- the English and the French departments. The school accepted both day and boarding students and was considered to be the first school to offer Kindergarten level. February 2, 1928 was designated as the day Mater Dei was officially founded while classes commenced on February 6, 1928 with forty five students. Initially, two Sisters were assigned to accompany the students to and from Rajprasong since the area was rather deserted. Although Mater Dei was an all-girls school, it enrolled boys from Kindergarten to Primary 2 as well. One of those students was Prince Ananda Mahidol who enrolled in 1930 and was given 273 as his student ID number; in 1935 he became King of Thailand, until his mysterious death in 1946. He was succeeded as King by his brother, Prince Bhumibol Adulyadej, who joined the school in 1932 and was given 449 as his student ID number. In 1932, there was a change in the curriculum. Students in Secondary school were to learn three languages - English, French and Thai - while those in Primary School would study only two - English and Thai. In 1936, Mater Dei changed its curriculum to conform to that of the Ministry of Education. The Ministry opened a Pre-University School in order to prepare students for university education. It ordered other schools to discontinue classes for the last two years in the Secondary level, thus reducing the number of years for Secondary education. Mater Dei, therefore, opened a Finishing Course in 1939 which required three years to complete. In pursuing this course, students learned about proper etiquette so they would grow up to be well-rounded adults. No emphasis was placed on vocational training, but students were taught both domestic science and job skills. This course was later discontinued. In 1944, during World War II, following the advice of the Ministry of Education, the school evacuated students to a safe shelter, its newly opened school in Hua Hin, Prachuab Khirikhan Province. It was moved back to the original location in 1945 when the war was over and the Japanese occupiers had left. Due to the constant increase in the number of students and the poor condition of the old buildings which made teaching difficult, the Sisters decided to build a new 3-storey building in 1960. Situated to the west and parallel to Lang Suan Road, the building had eleven classrooms and three activity rooms. In 1962, another building comprising eight classrooms was built and the old wooden building was demolished. In 1964, Mater Dei received the \\"Outstanding School\\" Award and the same award was given to the school for three consecutive years. On the 3rd year, it also received a royal plaque. In 1969, with the old auditorium being in disrepair, a new one was built in its place- the upper floor housing the auditorium and the lower floor housing the dining hall. To commemorate the 50th anniversary of the founding of Mater Dei School, the \\"50th Memorial Building\\" was opened in 1981. It is currently the school's gymnasium. The most recent building was constructed in 1992. It houses the Kindergarten and Secondary School. Its name, \\"Royal Celebration Building\\", was given by King Bhumibol to celebrate his 6th cycle (72nd) birthday. It was also to commemorate the founding of the school 72 years before. All along, the school has been given excellent support from the \\"Mater Dei School Alumni Association Under the Royal Patronage\\" and the \\"Parents and Teachers Association\\" in the areas of human resource development, education, as well as the construction of new buildings to accommodate and provide quality education. At present, the school accepts students from Kindergarten 3 to the final year of Secondary School. In general, the number of students in each class is limited to forty eight, except for Kindergarten where there are thirty students in each class. There are four rooms for Kindergarten and three each for Primary and Lower Secondary. As for Upper Secondary, students have a choice of three curriculum: Science, Art and Science, or Art and Language in which students choose to learn French. Mater Dei's motto is \\"Serviam - We Shall Serve\\" in line with the school's philosophy which is to \\"Educate the students so they become quality persons with high moral standards possessing wisdom and inner stability, and nurture them until they become well-rounded persons.\\" Notable alumni * Ananda Mahidol, King Rama VIII of Thailand * Bhumibol Adulyadej, King Rama IX of Thailand\\"The Making of a Monarch\\".

While British, Harrison spent most of his career overseas, and mainly in the Middle East. His works include the British Representative's Residence, Amman, the High Commissioner's Residence, Jerusalem, the Rockefeller Museum, Jerusalem, 1935, and Nuffield College, Oxford. Life Harrison was born in Kent in 1891. One of his ancestors was the renowned novelist Jane Austen for whom he was named. His upper-middle-class family pushed him to pursue a career in the military. After attending Sandhurst, he was commissioned as a Lieutenant in the British Army and found himself in the trenches at the Battle of Passchendaele, near Ypres in Flanders, Belgium, during World War I. The horror of what he saw convinced him that he wanted no part of either the military nor the war. When he informed his commanding officer that he intended to resign from the service and return to England, the officer told him that he could be court-martialed for refusing orders and desertion. Undeterred, Harrison replied, \\"So be it.\\" Harrison's decision created a problem for the officer who apparently knew the young lieutenant's family and did not wish to suffer the indignity of having one of his junior officers court-martialed. Harrison, for his part, had no desire to create a scandal or crusade as a pacifist. He merely wanted no part of killing other human beings. The officer and Harrison eventually reached a compromise: Harrison could resign his commission and serve as stretcher bearer for the remainder of the campaign. Later in life, in recounting his experiences in that ghastly battle, he described how the greatest danger that the stretcher-bearers and medics faced was the ubiquitous mud. The battle was fought largely in swamp land during periods of unusually heavy rainfall. To step off the board walks‚Äîwhich were necessitated by the conditions‚Äîwhile carrying the dead and wounded from the front was to risk literally drowning in mud. At the end of his life, as time past and present merged in his mind, he relived the terror of that experience, confusing those around him with his stretcher-bearing comrades and warning them of the treacherous mud. Austen St.Barbe Harrison in Katounia, 1960s photo by Dimitri Papadimos After the war, he travelled to Canada where he studied architecture at McGill University, Montreal in Canada. He also pursued his favourite hobby: hiking. Later in life, while living in Jerusalem, he once walked from Amman, Jordan, to Cairo. Harrison completed his architectural studies at the School of Architecture at University College, London. He joined the Department of Reconstruction for Eastern Macedonia after the First World War, where he was appointed Assistant Architect and Town Planner; his tasks included planning Nigrita and other settlements in Greece. His next position (from 1923 onwards) was as Chief Architect to the Department of Public Works in the civil administration of British Palestine, which led to him designing various edifices in places such as Jerusalem and Amman.Colvin, p. 168 As the Chief Architect in Palestine from 1923 to 1937, Harrison was responsible for a number of buildings, none more impressive than the Rockefeller Museum. The Museum, which was recently renovated, is an excellent example of Harrison's art. While the exterior is a wonderful amalgam of modern trends from the 1930s and traditional middle eastern themes, the interior is no less inspiring. Harrison once said that architecture is the \\"sculpting of space\\" and the museum is a testament to that sentiment. In designing the museum, he collaborated closely with Eric Gill, a widely renowned designer of the time. Much of the detailed work both inside and outside the museum are Gill's designs. Harrison also befriended George Horsfield, the Chief Inspector of Antiquities in Transjordan, and John Crowfoot, the second Director of the British School of Archaeology in Jerusalem.Hood, p. 212, 214 The Central Post House of Jaffa on the Sderot Yerushalayim, designed by Austen Harrison in 1931 During his nearly 15 years in Jerusalem, he came to know many of the most famous residents and visitors to Palestine, including Albert Einstein. When Einstein visited Jerusalem in 1923, Harrison invited him to his home, presumably to discuss Einstein's plans for what would eventually become Hebrew University. Einstein repaid Harrison's hospitality by playing his violin for the architect. Harrison was also a great admirer of Arab culture‚Äîparticularly, traditional Arabic architecture and design. He counted many Arabs among his friends and was outraged by the terms on which the British ended their mandate in Palestine. He felt that British policy favoured Jewish citizens over resident Arabs and sowed the seeds of escalating conflict into the future. He resigned his position in protest in 1937 and moved to Cyprus, leaving behind Jerusalem, a city that he loved and whose people and culture (their architecture, in particular) had shaped his life. After a donation to the University of Oxford from Lord Nuffield, Harrison next was appointed as architect for the newly established Nuffield College, Oxford, but the donor rejected his first plans for the college (which were heavily influenced by medieval Mediterranean buildings and traditional Arab design) and refused to allow his name to be associated with them, saying that they were \\"un- English\\".Colvin, p. 171Colvin, p. 174 Harrison modified the design so that the college looked like \\"something on the lines of Cotswold domestic architecture\\", as Nuffield wanted. Harrison's rejected design has been described as Oxford's \\"most notable architectural casualty of the 1930s\\".Colvin, p. 166 Nuffield College seems to have been the only building in Britain that he designed; his other work included the University of Ghana, and a report (in 1945) on the planning of Valletta, Malta. While living in Cyprus in the 1950s, Harrison befriended the writer Lawrence Durrell and helped Durrell who was struggling to support his family as a teacher. Durrell's wife was suffering a mental illness and it fell to Durrell to care for his children and his wife. One of the fruits of Durrell's writing is his book about Cyprus, Bitter Lemons, that is dedicated to Harrison. He subsequently moved to Athens. There he lived with his adopted family of Dimitri Papadimos, photographer, who he had met in Cairo in the 1930s and who was \\"War Photographer\\" for the Greek Forces that fought by the side of the Allies during II World War. Dimitri's wife Liana or as she was known in the resistance (Spitha) Eleni Frangia during the occupying of Greece by the Nazi and their son Ioannis (Yani). He died at the family home in 1976.

He was the host of the notable TV crime show India's Most Wanted. He was the editor of the news magazine Bureaucracy Today' After his wife Anju died in 2000, Ilyasi was charged under Section 304B of the Indian Penal Code for dowry death. He also got involved in a legal battle with his in-laws for the custody of his daughter. Ilyasi was acquitted in a passport case, while the charges 498A and 304B were also not proven and Ilyasi was discharged for the aforesaid charges in the trial court. Later, he was charged with murdering his wife after 14 years of the incident. On December 20, 2017, he was convicted for the murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. On 5 October 2018, Delhi High Court acquitted him, stating that there was no evidence against him on record to sustain the conviction. Life Suhaib Ilyasi is the son of Jameel Ilyasi, who was the head of All India Imams Organisation and who was known to have close personal relations with the then RSS Chief Sanghchalak KS Sudershan. Suhaib Ilyasi is an elder brother of Imam Umer Ilyasi who is said to be close to the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) and present RSS Chief Mohan Bhagwat. Marriage Ilyasi met Anju at Jamia Millia Islamia, a university in Delhi, where both were studying at the Mass Communication Research Centre, in November 1989. Anju's father was K. P. Singh, then head of metallurgy department. Both families were opposed to the relation, however they got married in London in 1993 under the Special Marriage Act. They lived in London until October 1994. Upon returning to India, Anju used to live in Ilyasi's house and returned to London after 6 months to brother. Her brother Prashant who was working in London at the time, later said that Anju was considering divorce at the time, but he convinced her to stay in the marriage. In April 1994, Ilyasi came to London, the couple reconciled and they returned to India after a month. The next year their daughter Aaliya was born. During their stay in London, they had arrived at the idea of a television similar to the British show Crimestoppers, which they named India's Most Wanted. Initially, Anju was the anchor in the television pilots, but by the time the show went on air on Zee TV in March 1998 Ilyasi had become the anchor. Around this, Anju left again and went her sister in Canada. India's Most Wanted was initially planned for 52 episodes but it was renewed by Zee TV. Later Ilyasi moved the show to Doordarshan under the name Fugitive Most Wanted. Zee TV which owned the copyright continued to produce India's Most Wanted and Manoj Raghuvanshi became the host. Ilyasi went to Canada in October 1998 to persuade her to return. IIyasi converted his software firm Aaliya Productions, into a private limited company and put 25% shares in Anju's name. Anju returned in February 1999. They bought a new apartment at the same time in Mayur Vihar, in east Delhi, for and spent 10 months redecorating. They moved into the house in December 1999. They planned to celebrate Anju's 30th birthday on 16 January with a grand party. Conviction for Wife's Murder On 10 January 2000, Ilyasi called two police constables who were guarding his house at 11:15pm, and told them that his wife had stabbed herself and asked them to call an ambulance. The policemen were there because Ilyasi had claimed that he was getting death threats from the underworld due to his show. Anju was taken to a nearby nursing home and later to the AIIMS, New Delhi, where she was declared dead on arrival. Anju Ilyasi had died from excessive bleeding from wounds, which were described as self-inflicted in the initial forensic report, ruling out murder. The Central Forensic Science Laboratory report said that six fingerprint characters were found but 13 were required to match it to a person. Both the stab wounds were downwards and backwards, left to right on the accessible parts of the abdomen. The T-shirt she was wearing was not torn. Ilyasi claimed that they were having an argument recently. He was playing with his child in another room, when Anju picked up an imported butcher's knife and stabbed herself. Anju's mother was in Canada at the time of death. Anju had visited her father hours before her death. Ilyasi moved into his in-laws' residence ostensibly to help them with the grief. On 17 January, police filed the case as a suicide. The Charge On 15 February 2000, his wife's sister Rashmi Singh, who ran a Montessori school, arrived from Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. After month, Rashmi filed a police complaint saying that Anju was tortured for dowry and that she was driven to suicide. On 28 March, Ilyasi was arrested and charged with dowry death (Section 304B of the Indian Penal Code), mental harassment (Section 498A) and destroying evidence (Section 201). On 30 March, the show's scheduled episode did appear on the Doordarshan channel. Following the arrest, Rashmi and her mother Rukma quarreled with their family and moved into a relative's house. Rashmi claimed that Anju had an unhappy marriage for 7 years. She had in 1997 during a visit she saw Ilyasi assault Anju. She said that the apartment in which they were living was purchased with money provided by her. which was proved wrong during the trial. She also said that she had purchased the apartment for Anju's safety, but later retracted the statement. Trial and custody battle On 14 April, Rashmi Singh gave an undertaking to the Delhi High Court that she won't take the child Aaliya without the court's permission. The court also asked her not take the child outside Delhi. The petition had filed by Ilyasi's parents that Rashmi might take the child to Canada. Then, Aaliya was two-and-a-half years old. On 2 June 2000, Ilyasi was granted bail by the Delhi High Court on a personal bail bond of and two sureties of the same amount. He was asked to submit his passport, not moved out of Delhi without permission, and not threaten the witness or tamper with evidence. On 11 July 2000, the Delhi High Court said that Rashmi and Rukma cannot take the custody of the child by force. The court said they may take a legal path to gain custody. Aaliya had been living with her father since 2 July. Ilyasi had complained that Rashmi had been trying to take away the child to Canada. He said that they had told him that they would charge him with threatening witnesses, if he did not give up custody. On 29 May 2001, the Delhi High Court allowed Ilyasi to travel outside Delhi. He had sought permission to go to Mumbai for work. The court said he may do so after informing the police of his plans two days in advance. In 2005, Rukma Singh appeal to a session court that a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe be started on the case. The court in August 2005 rejected the plea saying the plea filed after 5 years had no sufficient reason and was aimed at delaying the trial. In August 2010, Rukma's counsel told the court that additional murder charges (Section 302 of Indian Penal Code) should be added to the case. Her claims were supported by the prosecution. Sharma said the doctor who carried out the post mortem did not deny the possibility of homicide. Sharma also told the court that even though Ilyasi claimed to snatch the knife away from Anju, neither his nor Anju's fingerprints were found on the knife. Ilyasi argued that the doctor cannot be relied upon because he was later transferred from the mortuary department after allegation of unprofessional work. The sessions court rejected the plea for additional murder charges in February 2011 after finding no new material in the case. In an interview in 2012, Ilyasi said that the murder charges were being sought to take custody of his daughter, then 15. He said that he had not taken dowry as it was a love marriage and he had paid for the expenses. In another interview, he said that the Indian dowry laws were biased against men. In January 2013, the Delhi High Court stopped the proceedings of medical board. The police had formed a new medical board, as the previous board was split on its opinion whether it was murder. Ilyasi's counsel told them that the police had formed the new board without permission from the trial court, thus it was contempt of court. In March 2013, the Delhi High Court stayed the proceedings. The case was tried at a session court under section 498A/304B/302 IPC at Karkadooma District Court, New Delhi. Ilyasi was finally acquitted of all charges on 6 October 2015. On 20 December 2017, Ilyasi was convicted of murdering his wife by a Delhi court, which sentenced him to life imprisonment. On 5 October 2018, Delhi High Court acquitted him, stating that there was no evidence against him on record to sustain the conviction. Career In 1991, Ilyasi went to London to work as a cameraman for TV Asia. In 1995, he made the pilot for a crime show, with his wife. Initially, most channels were reluctant to take the show until Zee TV picked it. Ilyasi started the TV show India's Most Wanted in March 1998 on Zee TV. India's Most Wanted was initially planned for 52 episodes but it was renewed by Zee TV. The show at its peak had reportedly 10‚Äì12 TRP. About 30 criminals featured on the show were caught. Shri Prakash Shukla, a wanted hitman featured on the show, was killed by police. The police later said that Ilyasi took credit unduly and the police had worked for months on the case. Following the success of his show, Ilyasi said that he was getting threats and requested police security. In 1999, he played himself in the film Phir Bhi Dil Hai Hindustani. Later, he parted ways with his partner Vinod Nayar and went to start Fugitive Most Wanted on Doordarshan. Zee TV, which owned the copyright, continued to produce India's Most Wanted and Manoj Raghuvanshi became the host. After his wife's death, in 2003 he tried to make a film on Shri Prakash Shukla called Wanted No. 1 where he was supposed to play the lead character. But, the film failed to take off. He produced, directed and acted in another film, Kamyab Rasta (2004) called, co-starring Poonam Dariyanani. He then went to work with India TV, where he conducted several sting operations. Soon, he restarted India's Most Wanted on India TV. In 2005, actors Shakti Kapoor and Aman Verma were the targets of some of these sting operations. In July 2005, he announced plans to make a film on the sting operations. In March 2009, he started a magazine called Bureaucracy Today. He is also the editor-in-chief. In 2011, he began work a film called 498A: The Wedding Gift, which he said was based on a friend, Syed Makhdoom, who committed suicide in 2009, and not his own life. But, he has acknowledged that the same dowry law has also affected his life. Wasif Ali, of Save Indian Family Foundation, supported the film. The accused of the Nisha Sharma dowry case Munish Dalal, who was later acquitted, was involved in the making. The film was released in May 2012. In 2012, Yeh Zindagi Hai Gulshan, a TV serial produced by Ilyasi, was broadcast by Doordarshan. Suhaib Ilyasi is currently known to work on a feature film 'Ghar Wapsi'.

He trained a core group of Indian animators, whose first production was a film called The Banyan Deer (1957). Veteran animator Ram Mohan started his career at Films Division's Cartoon Unit. Another landmark animated film from Films Division is Ek Anek Aur Ekta, a short traditionally animated educational film released in 1974. The film is presented as a fable meant to teach children the value of unity, and was frequently broadcast on India's state-run television station, Doordarshan. The first Indian animated television series was Ghayab Aaya, which aired in 1986 and was directed by Suddhasattwa Basu. The first Indian 3D and VFX were done for the television series Captain Vyom by animation. The first Indian 3D animated film was Roadside Romeo, a joint venture between Yash Raj Films and the Indian division of the Walt Disney Company. It was written and directed by Jugal Hansraj. History The history of animation in India can be traced to the early 20th century. Precursors to modern animation such as shadow puppets and slide shows entertained audiences before the advent of the cinema. Pioneers such as Dadasaheb Phalke, Gunamoy Banerjee, K.S. Gupte and G.K. Ghokle kept the tradition of animation alive during the first half of the 20th century. Such individuals were usually self-taught and were inspired by foreign cartoons. Pre-Independence Even before the birth of animation, shadow-puppet traditions used images to tell stories. A notable example is tholu bommalata (\\"the dance of the leather puppets\\") from the state of Andhra Pradesh. The puppets used were large, had multiple joints, and were coloured on both sides. This meant that coloured shadows were projected onto the screen. Performances were accompanied by music. Folk tales and various epics such as the Mahabharata and Ramayana were dramatised. The Shambharik Kharolika was another means of entertainment that pre-dated the age of the cinema. A series of hand- painted glass slides were projected using an apparatus called the \\"magic lantern\\". Mahadeo Gopal Patwardhan and his sons were responsible for popularising the medium across parts of India in the late 19th century. Patwardhan initially took it up as a hobby after being inspired by his friend Madan Madhav Rao Vitale, who was an engineer. Eventually, elements such as dialogue, narration, lyrics and background music were added. The first public show was held on 20 February 1892 in Kalyan, Mumbai. The first grand tour ended on 27 December 1895 at the 11th session of the Indian National Congress in Pune. The slides depicted various tales from the Ramayana, Sita Swayamvar, Mahabharata, Sati Anasuya, Raja Harishchandra, Shekhar Dashratha and the circus. The circus slides were sponsored by the proprietors of the Chhatre's Grand Circus. Works by painters Raja Ravi Verma and Madhavrao Dhurandhar were also recreated. It is said that Raja Harishchandra's story in the form of an animated slide show was an influence behind prolific filmmaker Dadasaheb Phalke's first movie Raja Harishchandra, produced in 1913. Raja Harishchandra is notable for being India's first indigenous silent feature film. Often referred to as the father of Indian cinema, Phalke dabbled in animation as well. His 1912 short The Growth of a Pea Plant introduced the concept of time- lapse photography, with one frame shot per day. In 1915 he produced the animated short Agkadyanchi Mouj (Matchsticks' Fun). He had probably been inspired by √âmile Cohl‚Äôs matchstick film. This was followed by Laxmicha Galicha (animated coins), and Vichitra Shilpa (inanimate animation). Phalke was forced into making shorter works such as cartoons and documentaries since the war in Europe had slowed imports, including film. Unfortunately, animated works such as Agkadyanchi Mouj and Vichitra Shilpa have not survived the ravages of time. However, Phalke‚Äôs craftsmanship can still be seen in the title sequence of his last silent film, Setu Bandhan, made in 1932.\\"Glimpses of Indian Animation\\", directed by R. Swamy, Films Division of India, 1997. Accessed on 17 October 2016. May have originally been titled \\"The Complete History of Indian Animation\\". In 1934, the first Indian animated film with a soundtrack, On a Moonlit Night, was released. The film is often credited to composer and orchestra leader R.C. Boral, but this attribution may be erroneous. The Pea Brothers, directed by Gunamoy Banerjee and produced by New Theatres Limited, was released in Calcutta on 23 June 1934, making it the first Indian animated work to be released in theatres. The film was between 3 and 4 minutes long and used drawn black and white images. The plot consists of a pea-pod which opens up to release 5 peas, and from these peas emerge five small toy-like figures that play with one another. The film was basically an experimental attempt and hence lacked a proper storyline. It resembled the tradition of Disney and other foreign animators, whose films were released quite often in Calcutta. Pune-based Prabhat Film Company's Jambu Kaka was released in Bombay on 15 November 1934. The short features a jackal and was animated by Raghunath K. Kelkar. Around the same time, K.S. Gupte and G.K. Gokhle were teaching themselves animation by watching American cartoons. Their first experiment in animation was called Shikaar (\\"The Hunt\\"). Other shorts from the period include Bakam Bhatt by Kolapur Cinetoons, Lafanga Langoor (1935) by Mohan Bhavani, Superman's Myth (1939) by G.K. Ghokhle, and Akash Pataal (1939) by Mandar Malik. The shortage of raw film stock due to the Second World War may have caused filmmakers to choose animation as a medium.  Modern day  See: List of Indian animated television series From the early 2000s, many Indian cartoon channels started producing their own animated shows instead of completely being dependent on American and Japanese animated shows. For example the Indian produced series Chhota Bheem is not only famous in India but is also aired in Sri Lanka and Pakistan.

There are many reasons behind this increasing demand for Indian studios worldwide. The North American and European countries from the beginning show immense readiness to outsource their animation contents to companies in the Asian and Pacific Rim countries. The bulk animation in earlier years included 2D animation contents along with some 3D contents only. But now, the scenario has changed a lot. When compared with the past, Indian Animation Industry has gained its foothold in the International space by investing more in technology, moulding eminent artists and developing better infrastructure in film making. As we can see now, there are numerous Animation Studios, VFX, Game development and Film making institutes providing several high-end educational programs all over India. Students are also interested in overseas education because of the increasing opportunities and decent pay scale.Growth of 3D Animation in India Mumbai, Chennai, Trivandrum, Pune, Hyderabad, Kolkata and Bangalore have the major concentrations of Animation Studios in the country.

Early life  Cecile Laval Arnoux was born in Louisville, Kentucky on July 9, 1893, although some sources indicate 1891, 1897, and 1898. She had one sibling, a brother, Given Campbell Arnoux (1895‚Äì1966). Her father, Anthony Arnoux (1865‚Äì1932), was born in New York City and was a newspaper reporter. Her parents divorced, and Arnold's mother, Susan Campbell (1872‚Äì1930), remarried to Albert D. Evans in St. Louis, Missouri in 1902. After having 3 more children there, the family moved to Texas. Career Arnold, who was known for playing vamps, was a Ziegfeld Follies girl before moving to Mack Sennett's Keystone Studios in 1913. She appeared in at least fifty films with notable figures such as Charlie Chaplin, Roscoe \\"Fatty\\" Arbuckle, Mack Swain and Chaplin's half brother Syd until 1917. Perhaps her most memorable role is as the vamp in The Face on the Bar Room Floor. Arnold had multiple aliases, one of them being Cecele Arno, which she used when she was in the chorus of the 1916 Al Jolson show Robinson Crusoe, Jr. Personal life Arnold married her first husband, Chauncy Frank Reynolds, who was an actor at Keystone, in 1917. They divorced in 1919, and, while on a trip to China with her newspaper reporting brother, met David Toeg, a stock broker from a wealthy Syrian family. Toeg and Arnold married, and resided in Hong Kong together. According to Brent Walker's book, Mack Sennett's Fun Factory, she left Hong Kong for San Francisco in 1922 so her child could be born in America. She departed from Hong Kong on June 14, 1924 and her son, Robert Raphael Toeg, who was reportedly the result of an affair with Nicolai Nicolaivich Merkuloff (1905‚Äì1972), a Russian merchant, was born on March 15, 1925 in San Francisco. Curiously, some sources list Arnold's mother as the mother of Robert. Toeg and Arnold divorced sometime before June 18, 1931 according to Arnold's death certificate. Death Cecile died on June 18, 1931 of acute infective myocarditis. She is buried at Happy Valley Roman Catholic Cemetery in Hong Kong.

The song has a rhythmic style and lyrics about aspiring to a rich lifestyle. The song was released in promotion of the band's 1980 debut album House of Music. It was T. S. Monk's best-selling song and only charting single on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number 63. \\"Bon Bon Vie\\", particularly its horn intro, has been sampled by several hip hop artists.  Music and lyrics  According to Barry Lederer from Billboard, \\"Bon Bon Vie\\" is a midtempo funk/jazz song with a brassy beat. It has also been defined as a record of post-disco. T. S. Monk's bandleader Thelonious Monk, Jr., served as arranger, drummer, and lead vocalist for the song. It was co-written by Sandy Linzer, who produced its album House of Music. The song's lyrics are about aspiring to a rich lifestyle. Its chorus chants, \\"Give us the bon / give us the bon bon bon bon vie / give us the good life.\\" The song opens with a notable horn intro. The song's rough rhythmic style counterpoints its smooth harmonies. It also features lighthearted vocals, haunting scat riffs, and a backbeat constituted by brass, bongo, and hand-clapping.  Release and reception  After \\"Bon Bon Vie\\" was released, it charted at number 63 on the Billboard Hot 100 on March 28, 1981. It also reached number 11 on the Billboard Hot Soul Singles.

S. Monk's subsequent single \\"Candidate for Love\\". Stephen Holden from The New York Times wrote that producer Sandy Linzer \\"has found for T.S. Monk a flexible, melodic style that is halfway between Chic's disco and Dr. Buzzard's swing.\\" In The Village Voice, Robert Christgau praised \\"Bon Bon Vie\\" as \\"a rich song about aspiring to the rich life\\" and wrote, \\"I love not only the subtle Sandy Linzer lyric but also Thelonious Monk Jr.'s rough, high-humored vocal and incisive drumming, and its arrangement keeps giving up new pleasures.\\" He also took note of its musical aesthetic, calling it \\"ebullient on top and this far from desperation underneath\\". Christgau named it the second-best song of the 1980s in a decade-end list for The Village Voice.

Pictured is the infamous Dziennik (Journal) news cast, which attempted to slander capitalism in then-communist Poland using emotive and loaded language. Psychological manipulation is a type of social influence that aims to change the behavior or perception of others through indirect, deceptive, or underhanded tactics. By advancing the interests of the manipulator, often at another's expense, such methods could be considered exploitative and devious. Social influence is not necessarily negative. For example, people such as friends, family and doctors, can try to persuade to change clearly unhelpful habits and behaviors. Social influence is generally perceived to be harmless when it respects the right of the influenced to accept or reject it, and is not unduly coercive. Depending on the context and motivations, social influence may constitute underhanded manipulation. Theories on successful manipulation According to psychology author George K. Simon, successful psychological manipulation primarily involves the manipulator: (reference for the entire section) # Concealing aggressive intentions and behaviors and being affable. # Knowing the psychological vulnerabilities of the victim to determine which tactics are likely to be the most effective. # Having a sufficient level of ruthlessness to have no qualms about causing harm to the victim if necessary. Consequently, the manipulation is likely to be accomplished through covert aggressive means. According to Braiker Harriet B. Braiker (2004) identified the following ways that manipulators control their victims: * Positive reinforcement: includes praise, superficial charm, superficial sympathy (crocodile tears), excessive apologizing, money, approval, gifts, attention, facial expressions such as a forced laugh or smile, and public recognition. * Negative reinforcement: involves removing one from a negative situation as a reward, e.g. \\"You won't have to do your homework if you allow me to do this to you.\\" * Intermittent or partial reinforcement: Partial or intermittent negative reinforcement can create an effective climate of fear and doubt. Partial or intermittent positive reinforcement can encourage the victim to persist ‚Äì for example in most forms of gambling, the gambler is likely to win now and again but still lose money overall. * Punishment: includes nagging, yelling, the silent treatment, intimidation, threats, swearing, emotional blackmail, the guilt trip, sulking, crying, and playing the victim. * Traumatic one-trial learning: using verbal abuse, explosive anger, or other intimidating behavior to establish dominance or superiority; even one incident of such behavior can condition or train victims to avoid upsetting, confronting or contradicting the manipulator. According to Simon Simon identified the following manipulative techniques: * Lying (by commission) : It is hard to tell if somebody is lying at the time they do it, although often the truth may be apparent later when it is too late. One way to minimize the chances of being lied to is to understand that some personality types (particularly psychopaths) are experts at the art of lying and cheating, doing it frequently, and often in subtle ways. * Lying by omission: This is a subtle form of lying by withholding a significant amount of the truth. This technique is also used in propaganda. * Denial: Manipulator refuses to admit that they have done something wrong. * Rationalization: An excuse made by the manipulator for inappropriate behavior. Rationalization is closely related to spin. * Minimization: This is a type of denial coupled with rationalization. The manipulator asserts that their behavior is not as harmful or irresponsible as someone else was suggesting, for example, saying that a taunt or insult was only a joke. * Selective inattention or selective attention: Manipulator refuses to pay attention to anything that may distract from their agenda, saying things like \\"I don't want to hear it\\". * Diversion: Manipulator not giving a straight answer to a straight question and instead being diversionary, steering the conversation onto another topic. * Evasion: Similar to diversion but giving irrelevant, rambling, vague responses, weasel words. * Covert intimidation: Manipulator throwing the victim onto the defensive by using veiled (subtle, indirect or implied) threats. * Guilt trip: A special kind of intimidation tactic. A manipulator suggests to the conscientious victim that they do not care enough, are too selfish or have it easy. This usually results in the victim feeling bad, keeping them in a self-doubting, anxious and submissive position. * Shaming: Manipulator uses sarcasm and put- downs to increase fear and self-doubt in the victim. Manipulators use this tactic to make others feel unworthy and therefore defer to them. Shaming tactics can be very subtle such as a fierce look or glance, unpleasant tone of voice, rhetorical comments, subtle sarcasm. Manipulators can make one feel ashamed for even daring to challenge them. It is an effective way to foster a sense of inadequacy in the victim. * Vilifying the victim: More than any other, this tactic is a powerful means of putting the victim on the defensive while simultaneously masking the aggressive intent of the manipulator, while the manipulator falsely accuses the victim as being an abuser in response when the victim stands up for or defends themselves or their position. * Playing the victim role: Manipulator portrays themself as a victim of circumstance or of someone else's behavior in order to gain pity, sympathy or evoke compassion and thereby get something from another. Caring and conscientious people cannot stand to see anyone suffering and the manipulator often finds it easy to play on sympathy to get cooperation. * Playing the servant role: Cloaking a self- serving agenda in the guise of a service to a more noble cause, for example saying they are acting in a certain way to be \\"obedient\\" to or in \\"service\\" to an authority figure or \\"just doing their job\\". * Seduction: Manipulator uses charm, praise, flattery or overtly supporting others in order to get them to lower their defenses and give their trust and loyalty to the manipulator. They will also offer help with the intent to gain trust and access to an unsuspecting victim they have charmed. * Projecting the blame (blaming others): Manipulator scapegoats in often subtle, hard-to-detect ways. Often, the manipulator will project their own thinking onto the victim, making the victim look like they have done something wrong. Manipulators will also claim that the victim is the one who is at fault for believing lies that they were conned into believing, as if the victim forced the manipulator to be deceitful. All blame, except for the part that is used by the manipulator to accept false guilt, is done in order to make the victim feel guilty about making healthy choices, correct thinking and good behaviors. It is frequently used as a means of psychological and emotional manipulation and control. Manipulators lie about lying, only to re-manipulate the original, less believable story into a \\"more acceptable\\" truth that the victim will believe. Projecting lies as being the truth is another common method of control and manipulation. Manipulators may falsely accuse the victim as \\"deserving to be treated that way.\\" They often claim that the victim is crazy and/or abusive, especially when there is evidence against the manipulator. (See Feigning, below.) * Feigning innocence: Manipulator tries to suggest that any harm done was unintentional or that they did not do something that they were accused of. Manipulator may put on a look of surprise or indignation. This tactic makes the victim question their own judgment and possibly their own sanity. * Feigning confusion: Manipulator tries to play dumb by pretending they do not know what the victim is talking about or is confused about an important issue brought to their attention. The manipulator intentionally confuses the victim in order for the victim to doubt their own accuracy of perception, often pointing out key elements that the manipulator intentionally included in case there is room for doubt. Sometimes manipulators will have used cohorts in advance to help back up their story. * Brandishing anger: Manipulator uses anger to brandish sufficient emotional intensity and rage to shock the victim into submission. The manipulator is not actually angry, they just put on an act. They just want what they want and get \\"angry\\" when denied. Controlled anger is often used as a manipulation tactic to avoid confrontation, avoid telling the truth or to further hide intent. There are often threats used by the manipulator of going to the police, or falsely reporting abuses that the manipulator intentionally contrived to scare or intimidate the victim into submission. Blackmail and other threats of exposure are other forms of controlled anger and manipulation, especially when the victim refuses initial requests or suggestions by the manipulator. Anger is also used as a defense so the manipulator can avoid telling truths at inconvenient times or circumstances. Anger is often used as a tool or defense to ward off inquiries or suspicion. The victim becomes more focused on the anger instead of the manipulation tactic. * Bandwagon effect: Manipulator comforts the victim into submission by claiming (whether true or false) that many people already have done something, and the victim should as well. These include phrases such as \\"Many people like you ...\\" or \\"Everyone does this anyways.\\" Such manipulation can be seen in peer pressure situations, often occurring in scenarios where the manipulator attempts to influence the victim into trying drugs or other substances. Vulnerabilities exploited by manipulators According to Braiker's self-help book, manipulators exploit the following vulnerabilities (buttons) that may exist in victims: * the \\"disease to please\\" * addiction to earning the approval and acceptance of others * Emotophobia (fear of negative emotion; i.e. a fear of expressing anger, frustration or disapproval) * lack of assertiveness and ability to say no * blurry sense of identity (with soft personal boundaries) * low self-reliance * external locus of control According to Simon, manipulators exploit the following vulnerabilities that may exist in victims: * na√Øvet√© ‚Äì victim finds it too hard to accept the idea that some people are cunning, devious and ruthless or is \\"in denial\\" if they are being victimized. * over-conscientiousness ‚Äì victim is too willing to give manipulator the benefit of the doubt and see their side of things in which they blame the victim. * low self-confidence ‚Äì victim is self-doubting, lacking in confidence and assertiveness, likely to go on the defensive too easily. * over-intellectualization ‚Äì victim tries too hard to understand and believes the manipulator has some understandable reason to be hurtful. * emotional dependency ‚Äì victim has a submissive or dependent personality. The more emotionally dependent the victim is, the more vulnerable they are to being exploited and manipulated. Manipulators generally take the time to scope out the characteristics and vulnerabilities of their victims. Kantor advises in his book The Psychopathology of Everyday Life: How Antisocial Personality Disorder Affects All of Us that vulnerability to psychopathic manipulators involves being too: * dependent ‚Äì dependent people need to be loved and are therefore gullible and liable to say yes to something to which they should say no. * immature ‚Äì has impaired judgment and so tends to believe exaggerated advertising claims. * na√Øve ‚Äì cannot believe there are dishonest people in the world, or takes it for granted that if there are any, they will not be allowed to prey on others. * impressionable ‚Äì overly seduced by charmers. For example, they might vote for the seemingly charming politician who kisses babies. * trusting ‚Äì people who are honest often assume that everyone else is honest. They are more likely to commit themselves to people they hardly know without checking credentials, etc., and less likely to question so-called experts. * carelessness ‚Äì not giving sufficient amount of thought or attention on harm or errors. * lonely ‚Äì lonely people may accept any offer of human contact. A psychopathic stranger may offer human companionship for a price. * narcissistic ‚Äì narcissists are prone to falling for unmerited flattery. * impulsive ‚Äì make snap decisions about, for example, what to buy or whom to marry without consulting others. * altruistic ‚Äì the opposite of psychopathic: too honest, too fair, too empathetic. * frugal ‚Äì cannot say no to a bargain even if they know the reason it is so cheap. * materialistic ‚Äì easy prey for loan sharks or get-rich-quick schemes. * greedy ‚Äì the greedy and dishonest may fall prey to a psychopath who can easily entice them to act in an immoral way. * masochistic ‚Äì lack self-respect and so unconsciously let psychopaths take advantage of them. They think they deserve it out of a sense of guilt. * the elderly ‚Äì the elderly can become fatigued and less capable of multi-tasking. When hearing a sales pitch they are less likely to consider that it could be a con. They are prone to giving money to someone with a hard-luck story. See elder abuse. Motivations of manipulators Manipulators can have various possible motivations, including but not limited to: * the need to advance their own purposes and personal gain at virtually any cost to others * a strong need to attain feelings of power and superiority in relationships with others * a want and need to feel in control * a desire to gain a feeling of power over others in order to raise their perception of self-esteem * boredom, or growing tired of their surroundings, seeing it as a game more than hurting others * covert agenda, criminal or otherwise, including financial manipulation (often seen when the elderly or unsuspecting, unprotected wealthy are intentionally targeted for the sole purpose of obtaining a victim's financial assets) * not identifying with underlying emotions, commitment phobia, and subsequent rationalization (offender does not manipulate consciously, but rather tries to convince themselves of the invalidity of their own emotions) * Lack of self control over impulsive and anti social behaviour thus pre-emptive or reactionary manipulation to maintain image Psychopathy Being manipulative appears in Factor 1 of the Hare Psychopathy Checklist (PCL).  In the workplace  One approach to management in general identifies a very fine, almost non-existent dividing line between management and manipulation. The workplace psychopath may often rapidly shift between emotions ‚Äì used to manipulate people or to cause high anxiety.Faggioni M & White M Organizational Psychopaths ‚Äì Who Are They and How to Protect Your Organization from Them (2009) The authors of the book Snakes in Suits: When Psychopaths Go to Work describe a five-phase model of how a typical workplace psychopath climbs to and maintains power. In phase three (manipulation) the psychopath will create a scenario of \\"psychopathic fiction\\" where positive information about themselves and negative disinformation about others will be created, where one's role as a part of a network of pawns or patrons will be utilised and one will be groomed into accepting the psychopath's agenda. Baibak, P; Hare, R. D Snakes in Suits: When Psychopaths Go to Work (2007). Antisocial, borderline and narcissistic personality disorders According to Kernberg, antisocial, borderline, and narcissistic personality disorders are all organized at a borderline level of personality organization, and the three share some common characterological deficits and overlapping personality traits, with deceitfulness and exceptional manipulative abilities being the most common traits among antisocial and narcissism. Borderline is emphasized by unintentional and dysfunctional manipulation, but stigma towards borderlines being deceitful still wrongfully persists. Antisocials, borderlines, and narcissists are often pathological liars. Other shared traits may include pathological narcissism, consistent irresponsibility, Machiavellianism, lack of empathy, cruelty, meanness, impulsivity, proneness to self-harm and addictions, interpersonal exploitation, hostility, anger and rage, vanity, emotional instability, rejection sensitivity, perfectionism, and the use of primitive defence mechanisms that are pathological and narcissistic. Common narcissistic defences include splitting, denial, projection, projective identification, primitive idealization and devaluation, distortion (including exaggeration, minimization and lies), and omnipotence. Psychologist Marsha M. Linehan has stated that people with borderline personality disorder often exhibit behaviors which are not truly manipulative, but are erroneously interpreted as such. According to her, these behaviors often appear as unthinking manifestations of intense pain, and are often not deliberate as to be considered truly manipulative. In the DSM-V, manipulation was removed as a defining characteristic of borderline personality disorder. Manipulative behavior is intrinsic to narcissists, who use manipulation to obtain power and narcissistic supply. Those with antisocial personalities will manipulate for material items, power, revenge, and a wide variety of other reasons. Histrionic personality disorder People with histrionic personality disorder are usually high-functioning, both socially and professionally. They usually have good social skills, despite tending to use them to manipulate others into making them the center of attention. Machiavellianism Machiavellianism is a term that some social and personality psychologists use to describe a person's tendency to be unemotional, uninfluenced by conventional morality and more prone to deceive and manipulate others. In the 1960s, Richard Christie and Florence L. Geis developed a test for measuring a person's level of Machiavellianism (sometimes referred to as the Machiavelli test).Christie, R., and F. L. Geis. (1970) \\"How devious are you? Take the Machiavelli test to find out.\\" Journal of Management in Engineering 15.4: 17.

It showcases films, video art, performances, music, conferences and other special events with works from international artists. Dealing with questions about society, digital culture and media, the festival aims to tackle pressing questions from an interdisciplinary perspective. History The Impakt Festival started in 1988 as a festival for experimental arts. Since its first edition the Impakt Festival has been offering a variety of events including video and film screenings, exhibitions, conferences, talks, concerts and dance nights. Besides the annual Panorama program, which is still Impakt's official selection of recent film and video productions, the festival also has a thematic program that is focused on contemporary matters. Interdisciplinarity is embraced and efforts for balance and multi-perspectiveness is preferred. Over the years, the festival has taken the form of a more thematic program. Impakt also operates an artist-in-residency scheme, outside of the annual festival, along with year-round events. 1990s The 1990s editions were characterized by an, already proven, experimental research that formed a positive stimulus to the past image and soundculture and a necessary supplement to the mass media‚Äôs supply of entertainment.Impakt Festival catalogue 1994 During those editions were screened works from Vito Acconci, Bruce Nauman, Mathias Muller, Bruce Conner, Bill Viola, Kurt Kren, Dereck Jarman and William Wegman. 2000s As Impakt Festival's prestige as a European media art festival grew, the turn of the millennium saw a turn to focusing on a more specifically on an annual thematic program. Themes included: 2001 Group Formation 2002 Whatever Happened To All The Fun In The World? 2003 It's Happening Again: Fashion, Music, Politics 2004 Cultural Autopsy 2005 Adventures in Sound and Image 2006 The Great Outdoors 2007 Adventures in Sound and Image 2008 Yourspace 2009 Accelerated Living During the 2000s editions, works from Annika Larsson, Magnus Wallin, Norman McLaren, Miranda July, Matthew Barney and Reynold Reynolds were screened at Impakt Festival, in addition to many others. 2010‚Äìpresent=Impakt Festival 2010 Matrix City focused on the various different perceptions of what elements constitute a city and what a city should look like. Considerations, not only on geographical matters, but additionally on Utopianism were addressed through the programme. Impakt Festival 2011 2011 focused on the theme The Right to Know, in which Impakt dove into all dilemmas inherent in our modern data society, with conspiracy theories and cover-ups, digital dissidents and banned videos, data journalism and fear management, fine print messages and big secrets. The theme transpired to be extremely apt, as 2011 saw the onset of the Arab Spring and the prominence of WikiLeaks's rise.http://impakt.nl/festival/ The Centre for the Humanities (CfH) at Utrecht University, in collaboration with the department of New Media and Digital Culture and the Impakt Festival, initiated the CfH- Impakt Festival Fellowship. Mercedes Bunz acted as the festival fellow. Impakt Festival 2012 No More Westerns explored the decline in dominance of Western media culture. The programme explored shifting geopolitical landscapes on the world stage and aimed to preview the imminent changes in visual culture. Guest curators included Samantha Culp and Cher Potter, they stated that: \\"We hope to share some of the isolated charges and momentary signs we‚Äôve noticed that indicate a new and imminent awareness ‚Äì a set of cultural and social movements emerging from regions operating along alternative storylines to the west, in the spaces between pre-modernism and postmodernism\\". Speakers of note included Parmesh Shahani, along with another collaboration with The Centre for the Humanities (CfH) at Utrecht University. Impakt Festival 2013 In 2013 the Impakt Festival investigated capitalism and the current economic crisis under the theme Capitalism: Catch-22 It asked questions, such as: whether capitalism is at the root of crises or actually the driving force behind progress? And, are there any viable alternatives? Impakt selected three curatorial parties, representing a diverse programme: Amsterdam-based collective Monnik, British curator Benjamin Fallon and German film curator Florian W√ºst. Impakt Festival 2014 Soft Machines: Where the Optimised Human Meets Artificial Empathy celebrated Impakt Festival's silver jubilee,http://www.volkskrant.nl/beeldende-kunst/in-5-stappen-door-25-jaar- festival-impakt~a3777719/ in addition to probing the relationship between humanity and artificial intelligence.http://metropolism.com/previews/schrijf- ik-dit-of-schrijft-micro/english A.

Festival Components The main body of Impakt Festival is composed of its screening programmes.

She is also notable as a writer and journalist.Brooklyn Museum, Dinner Party Database. Life Cristina Trivulzio was the daughter of Girolamo Trivulzio and the Vittoria dei Marchesi Gherardini (member of the Gherardini family). Her father died soon after her birth and her mother remarried to Alessandro Visconti d'Aragona; she had a stepbrother and three stepsisters through this second marriage. By her own account \\"I was as a child melancholy, serious, introverted, quiet, so shy that I often happen to burst into tears in the living room of my mother because I realized that I was being looked at or that they wanted me to talk.\\"Aldobrandino Malvezzi Portrait of princess Christine de Belgiojoso by Th√©odore Chass√©riau (Petit Palais, mus√©e des Beaux-arts de la Ville de Paris) She married at 16, at the Church of St. Fedele in Milan on 24 September 1824. She was considered the richest heiress in Italy, with a dowry of 400,000 francs. Her libertine husband, Prince Emilio Barbiano di Belgiojoso, caused a separation soon after. They did not divorce and remained on cordial terms throughout their lives. She had begun associating with Mazzinian revolutionaries through her art teacher Ernesta Bisi and stepfather Marquis Alessandro Visconti d'Aragona.Encyclopedia of Italian Literary Studies This brought her to the attention of the Austrian authorities and she fled penniless to France. Her husband sent her money, and she bought an apartment close to the Madeleine, although she lived in relative poverty. Cristina Trivulzio Belgiojoso 1832, by Francesco Hayez-detail Eventually more money was sent, and she moved house and set up a salon. During the 1830s and 1840s her Paris salon became a meeting place for Italian revolutionaries such as Vincenzo Gioberti, Niccol√≤ Tommaseo, and Camillo Cavour. She also associated with the European artistic intelligentsia, including Alexis de Tocqueville, Honor√© de Balzac, Alfred de Musset, Victor Hugo, Heinrich Heine, Franz Liszt, and played an important influence in the initial singing career of \\"Mario the tenor\\" Giovanni M. de Candia. Other acquaintances were the historians Augustin Thierry and Francois Mignet who would play a major role in her life. It was at her salon that she hosted the famous March 31, 1837 duel between Liszt and Sigismond Thalberg to determine who was the greater pianist. Belgiojoso‚Äôs judgment was, \\"Thalberg is the greatest pianist, but there is only one Liszt.\\"MariaDewi.com In 1838, she had a daughter, Mary. The natural father was certainly not her estranged husband; it has been speculated that he may have been her friend Francois Mignet or her personal secretary Bolognini. In the 1848 Italian revolutions, she organized and financed a troop of soldiers and fought in the Milanese uprising against the Austrians for Italy's independence. After the insurrection failed, she returned to Paris and published articles in the influential magazine Revue des Deux Mondes describing the struggle in Italy. In 1849 she returned to Italy to support the Roman Republic formed in the Papal States by Mazzini and others. She became a hospital director during the brief life of the republic until it was suppressed by French troops. Cristina fled, accompanied by her daughter, first to Malta and then to Constantinople, from where she published an account of the republic and its fall in the French magazine Le National in 1850. She bought land in the remote Ciaq-Maq-Oglou area and then traveled to Syria, Lebanon and Palestine. Cristina published accounts of her experiences in the orient and found the condition of women there particularly disturbing. She published Of Women's Condition and of their Future (1866) in which she argues that deprived of education, women come to accept the oppressive conditions in which they find themselves. She lived in exile in Turkey for eight years before returning to Italy in 1856 and working with the statesman Camillo Benso Cavour for Italian unification which was achieved in 1861. In 1858 her estranged husband, Emilio‚Äîstill legally her spouse‚Äîdied. A few years later she was finally able to legitimize her daughter, Mary. Her final years were spent in retirement between Milan and Lake Como in the company of her daughter and son-in-law, Marquis Ludovico and her English governess Miss Parker, and her Turkish servant, a freed slave. During this period she continued to write and publish until her death at age 63.

Donna is less than popular with her co-stars and her producer and gets less fanmail than anyone else, including new cast member Crystal and long standing co-star Ralph Whatman. Ralph Whatman is the male lead in Dr Willoughby and whenever Donna Sinclair has bad publicity or is heading for a fall he wastes no time in trying to make the show his own. Emma Goodliffe is the shows producer, unable to cope with the stress she is begging to be removed from the show. She is even heard in one episode to be applying for a job in a supermarket only to be told she is over qualified. Crystal is the new girl, she is receiving more fan mail than Donna after just two weeks on the show, something which Donna cannot stand. She demands that producer Emma remove her from the show but her request is rejected leading to Donna to advise Crystal not to wear a bra in order to put off her male fans. Andy is the shows runner, he is at the beck and call of Donna. When Donna takes a shine to a new actor, she is furious when she walks into a store cupboard only to find that Andy is in there with him.

The treaty is by some considered \\"the worst political defeat\\" of Elector Frederick William I.MacKay (1997), p.213, referring to Opgenoorth, Friedrich Wilhelm Volume II, p.194 He was forced by France to give away the Swedish portion of what he considered his rightful Pomeranian inheritance,Clark (2006), pp.48, 50 despite having conquered it in a four-year campaign. Background Frederick William I, Elector of Brandenburg Sweden had allied with France in April 1672.Arnold- Baker (2001), p.97 At this time, Great Britain, the Electorate of Brandenburg, the Netherlands and Denmark were hostile towards Sweden. Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor had allied with the Netherlands and Spain against France on 30 August 1673, and declared war in early 1674.MacKay (1997), p.208 Subsequently, Frederick William I, Elector of Brandenburg joined the anti-French alliance. In support of Louis XIV of France, Charles XI of Sweden invaded Brandenburg in 1674, but was decisively defeated in the Battle of Fehrbellin in 1675.Heitz (1995), p.239 Denmark then invaded Swedish Scania. In the ensuing Scanian War, Brandenburg occupied the Swedish dominions in Northern Germany, Swedish Pomerania (except for R√ºgen) and Bremen-Verden, also Courland; Denmark occupied R√ºgenHeitz (1995), pp.239-241 but was defeated in Scania in the battles of Lund (1676) and Landskrona (1677). After the Treaties of Nijmegen (1678/1679) had ended the Franco-Dutch War, France was able to support Sweden again, and invaded the Brandenburgian Duchy of Cleves on the lower Rhine.Holborn (1982), p.79 Brandenburg, short of troops in the area and deprived of allies by the Nijmegen treaties, had no choice than to settle for peace with France at the expense of her gains from Sweden.Shennan (1995), pp.25-26 Likewise, Denmark-Norway had to conclude the Treaty of Fontainebleau with Sweden in September 1679. Negotiations Swedish Pomerania (blue) and the Electorate of Brandenburg with Brandenburgian Pomerania (orange) between the treaties of Stettin (1653) and Saint-Germain (1679) Brandenburg's ally Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor had concluded a separate peace with Louis XIV of France in February 1679, confirming the Treaty of Westphalia of 1648 which included the cession of Bremen-Verden and Swedish Pomerania to Sweden.MacKay (1997), p.211 Neither did Leopold I want Frederick William to become a \\"new king of the Vandals in the Baltics\\",MacKay (1997), p.212 nor did he want the Brandenburg-Pomeranian conflict to disturb his negotiations with France. Frederick William I had his diplomats offer France unconditional support, including military support and support against the Holy Roman Emperor, in return for Louis XIV letting him keep Swedish Pomerania. Furthermore, Frederick William I directly offered Sweden \\"some tons of gold\\" for Swedish Pomerania, and military support against Denmark-Norway. Louis XIV however neither had an interest nor a military need to fulfill any Brandenburgian wish. To the contrary, he had a strong interest that Sweden would not lose any territory as a consequence of her alliance and support for France. Frederick William was told that Sweden would lose Stettin \\"no more than Stockholm\\", and that \\"first we [France] will take Lippstadt, Minden will cause us no trouble, then Halberstadt and Magdeburg will fall to us one after the other, and finally we will reach Berlin\\". With Brandenburgian Cleves occupied and Minden sieged, France also refused another offer of Frederick William to cede his Rhine provinces in return for Swedish Pomerania. Provisions Louis XIV of France On 29 June 1679, Frederick William I, Elector of Brandenburg signed the treaty, thereby restoring Bremen-Verden and most of Swedish Pomerania to SwedenHeitz (1995), p.241 in return for a consolation payment from Louis XIV of FranceStearns&Langer; (2001), p.315 and the reversion of East Frisia. The French payment to Brandenburg was fixed at 300,000 talers, to be paid within the following two years.MacKay (1997), p.213 France subsequently managed to have Brandenburg accept this sum also to settle 900,000 talers of French debts. The Electorate of Brandenburg further gained the former Swedish eastern bank of the Oder river except for Gollnow and Damm. Gollnow was pawned to Brandenburg for 50,000 talers, bailed out by Sweden in 1693. Swedish Pomerania was to be cleared of Brandenburgian occupation forces within three months. The treaty also contained a paragraph that forbade Dutch forces to garrison in the Duchy of Cleves. Implementation and aftermath Charles XI of Sweden Stettin was restored to Sweden as the last Brandenburgian stronghold in December 1679. Denmark, who during the Scanian War had occupied R√ºgen, concluded a separate treaty with Sweden: In the Treaty of Lund of 26 September 1679, Denmark assured to return R√ºgen to Sweden until 20 October. Still in 1679, Brandenburg concluded a secret alliance with France: Brandenburg's sovereignty was to be respected by France for ten years and an annual 100,000 livres were paid in return for France's right for free passage through Brandenburgian territory.Shennan (1995), p.26 This alliance was in part due to disappointment of the Hohenzollern Elector of Brandenburg with the Habsburg Holy Roman Emperor,Clark (2006), p.50 who had approved of the treaty and opposed a strong Brandenburg. Aware of France' expansionism and what he called the \\"French yoke\\", Frederick William I nevertheless concluded that \\"only the protection of God and the power of the [French] King can bring us security\\", and that the Empire and the Emperor \\"were the first to leave us defenceless before our enemies\\". However, beginning in 1685, Brandenburg secretly started to form new, anti-French alliances.

It is believed to be the site of Gautama Buddha's first visit to the country, and is one of the Solosmasthana, the 16 sacred religious locations in Sri Lanka. Currently this temple has been declared as one of archaeological site in Sri Lanka. Buddha's visit Historical sources, including the ancient chronicle Mahavamsa, record that the Buddha visited the Mahiyangana area in the ninth month after he attained enlightenment, which was his first visit to the country. According to the Mahavamsa, Sri Lanka was inhabited by yakshas at the time. It says that the Buddha subdued the yakshas there and held a discourse on Dhamma with them. They were then sent to an island named Giri so that the country would be \\"purified\\" and Buddhism could be established there later on, where it would prevail \\"in all its glory\\". History A Yakka chieftain named Saman (who is now regarded as a deity) attained SotƒÅpanna (Sovan) after listening to the Buddha's discourse, and asked for a token from the Buddha that they could worship in his absence. The Buddha had given him a handful of hair from his head, which Saman later enshrined in a small stupa, in height. This was the first stupa to be built in Sri Lanka. After the parinirvana of the Buddha in 543 BC, an Arahant named Sarabhu brought the Lord Buddha's larynx, which had been recovered from the funeral pyre. This relic was also enshrined within the same stupa, which was enlarged to a height of . Several kings have since renovated and enlarged this stupa, including Dutthagamani who raised it to a height of . Other rulers such as Voharika Tissa, Sena II, Vijayabahu I and Kirti Sri Rajasinha have carried out repairs and maintenance work at the temple. In 1942, a society was formed for the renovation of the temple under D. S. Senanayake. Reconstruction work began in 1953 and ended in 1980 with the completion of a new pinnacle for the stupa.

He studied cameralistics at the Universities of Frankfurt (Oder) and G√∂ttingen. In Hamburg, where he visited a commercial college, Dohna became a friend of Alexander von Humboldt. In 1790 he joined the Royal Prussian War and Domain Chamber (Kriegs- und Dom√§nenkammer) in Berlin and was promoted to the Director of the regional chamber in Marienwerder in 1801.short BiographyBiography at Neue Deutsche Biographie After the Prussian defeat at Jena and Auerstedt in 1806 Dohna did not pay homage to Napoleon but just assured the local authorities wouldn't act against the French troops. Dohna was voluntarily detained as a hostage to secure his pledge. In April 1807 Dohna negotiated with Napoleon at the Finckenstein Palace on a French-Prussian separate peace and achieved a waiver of contribution payments of the province of West Prussia. On 4 August 1807 Friedrich Wilhelm III of Prussia appointed Dohna to the President of the Royal War and Domain Chamber. On proposal of Heinrich Friedrich Karl vom Stein Dohna became his successor as Prussian minister of Interior after Stein was forced to leave his office on French pressure in 1808. As such Dohna supported the foundation of the University of Berlin by Wilhelm von Humboldt. The Prussian estates at K√∂nigsberg in 1813. Dohna came into opposition to Karl August von Hardenberg and left office in November 1810. He returned to his estates in East Prussia and organized a meeting of the Prussian estates in K√∂nigsberg with Ludwig Yorck von Wartenburg on 5 February 1813 after the Convention of Tauroggen. Here Dohna was elected the Chairman of the Commission of People's Armament and organized the resistance against the retreating French troops after Napoleon's Russian campaign. Cooperating with Carl von Clausewitz he elaborated an adjustment to create the Prussian Landwehr, which was subsequently approved by the Prussian King on 17 March 1813, and was appointed to the Civil Governor of Prussian territory East of the Vistula.

Signwriting today  Traditional signwriters use methods closely related to those of their forebears in this craft and do not depend on technology - they are able to set out a sign with chalk and write it by eye in freehand. They do not rely on fonts and normally have their own individual lettering styles, yet also have the ability to render fonts closely to brand, as in architectural design briefs, for example. Designs are often created by hand on the drawing board and later combined with CAD software for preliminary layout production. The final execution is made by hand using brushes known as quills and similar signwriting 'pencils' and chiseled brushes. Specialist enamels are also employed to fashion a long-lasting finish along with the traditional use of gold leaf. Historically, signwriters drew or painted signs by hand using a variety of paint depending on the background i.e. enamel paint for vehicles and general signs, and water-based paints for short-term window signs. The term \\"modern signwriters\\" is misleading, as most do not use the traditional brush as method of application. Many use vinyl masking screens in order to replicate traditional signwriting. Modern print-based signage producers design and 'output' signs with the assistance of computer software and a range of equipment such as large format digital printers, plotters, cutters, flat bed routers and engraving machines. Signwriting and signmakers may offer many different processes to present the same lettering or images in different media, such as banners, metal engraving, LED or neon signs. Signs created with large-format printers may use solvent inks, water-based inks, latex inks or ultraviolet-curable/cured inks. The last material is the most modern, and can be printed directly onto many different substrates such as wood, metal and plastic, adhesive-backed or non-adhesive films. Adhesive-backed films are then laminated to another substrate. So called 'permanent' signage for use in shopfronts can be cut by machine or hand from acrylic or metal. However these deteriorate and lose pigmentation and surface polish after two to three years. Many traditional signwriters point out that a painted sign, by contrast, grows more beautiful with age, eventually becoming what's known as a 'ghost sign' as it fades revealing grounds, surfaces, brushstrokes and undercoats.  History  Signwriters were employed to paint signs for a wide variety of purposes. They required good hand-eye coordination as well as the ability to produce different styles of font, ornamentation and lettershapes.A brief history of signboards and sign writingRetrieved 10 September 2020 Bars, pubs and restaurants Signwriting for these establishments is typically elaborately painted, cast in metal or gilded, for the latter sometimes also for the menu case. This is typically done by signage machine specialists or by visual (manual) artists and/or metalworkers.

Majuba is Eskom's only power station that is not linked to a specific mine and it receives its coal from various sources. History Construction started in September 1983 and by April 1996 the first unit was connected to the grid. The last unit was commissioned in April 2001. Power generation Majuba has three 665 MW dry- cooled units and three 716 MW wet-cooled units with a total installed capacity of 4,110MW with a turbine Maximum Continuous Rating of 35.3% on the dry-cooled turbines and 37.7% on the wet-cooled units. Underground coal gasification In addition to coal, the Majuba Power Station is fired by syngas produced by underground coal gasification at the nearby Majuba demonstration facility on the Majuba coalfield. The pilot plant was commissioned in January 2007 and the first electricity was generated from the underground coal gasification gas on 31 May 2007. Produced syngas is transported from the facility to the power station by pipeline with a diameter of . There is a plan to build a 1,200 MW commercial generation facility. Silo Collapse On 1 November 2014, the plant was running under normal load when a visible crack was reported on Silo 20 by a member of the operating staff at approximately 12:30. Personnel in the area were subsequently evacuated. At 13:20, the silo collapsed and the plant's output was immediately reduced from 3600MW to 1800MW. Shortly after, the output was reduced further to 600MW.  Coal Supply  Majuba requires 14 million tonnes (14 Mtpa) of coal per annum which were originally supposed to come from a colliery built and operated by Rand Mines but that mine was decommissioned in 1993. An 8 Mtpa rail link branch from Palmfort was commissioned and, by 1996, was sufficient for the power plant owing to the delayed construction schedule. From 2003 Eskom implemented a policy of procuring coal from new emerging sources which resulted in delivery by road, since the location of the mines precluded their use of the Palmfort line, despite the fact that it was sufficient for Majuba's needs. In early 2000 Majuba started increasing its coal consumption by 2.2 Mtpa to a target of 14 Mtpa by 2010, based on forecasts of electricity demand growth. To accommodate this a 68 km rail line from Ermelo to Majuba was planned which would link up to the heavy haul export rail line from Mpumalanga to Richards Bay. The project was approved by the Eskom board in December 2004 with a cost-to- completion of R1,5-billion. The project ran several years late and was expected to be completed by March 2021 at a cost-to-completion of R8-billion. In addition, in December 2019 a coal tippler takeout conveyor caught fire at Majuba and since then all coal deliveries by rail had ceased.

The MCC program structure and admissions are similar to that of the Master of Business Administration and Master of Science in Management degrees. The equivalent of MCC at some universities is Master's in Communication, Master (of Arts) in Public Relations, Master (of Science) in Communication Management.  Admission  B-school MCC Admission Committees normally evaluate applicants based on resume, letters of recommendation, work experiences, as well as by a candidate's bachelor's degree GPA and GPA of graduate studies if applicable. Based on these indicators, the committee decides if the applicant can handle the academic rigor of the program and demonstrate considerable leadership potential. The committee also looks for applicants that can improve diversity in the classroom as well as contribute positively to the student body as a whole.  Programme structure  The MCC structure varies from program to program, but typically resembles one of the five major types of MBAs (distance-learning, part-time, accelerated, two-year, or executive). The MCC program for professionals often resembles one of a distance-learning, part- time, accelerated, or two-year MBA program. Most programs begin with a set of required courses and then offer more specialized courses two thirds of the way through the program.  Courses  Depending on the each university, the general management courses may include, but are not limited to the following courses: * Strategic Marketing * Reputation Management * Issues Management * Corporate Strategy * Organizational Behavior * Industrial Organization * Accounting * Data Analysis Some of the more subject-oriented topics (electives) in an MCC program include: * Corporate Branding * Integrated Marketing Communication * Business and Marketing Strategy * Business, Marketing, Advertising and Media Planning * Crisis Communication * Internal Communication and Change Management * Stakeholder Relations and Communication * Organizational Identity * Corporate Social Responsibility / Corporate Shared Value * Organizational Reputation Management * Sponsoring and Partnerships * Commercial Communication Law * Corporate Communication and Market Research Methods * KPIs and Performance Analytics * Public Affairs * and Issues Management Graduation requirements Graduation requirements are different for full-time MCC program from that for executive professionals. Total number of credits required for graduation in regular MCC program may differ from one university to another. However, usually the required number of credits for master program in countries practicing the Bologna system of education is no less than 120 ECTS. The number of credits for executive master programs is usually not less than 60 ECTS, depending on the university.  Europe  In 1997 the Corporate Communication Centre, an entity of the Rotterdam School of Management of the Erasmus University Rotterdam started with the Master of Corporate Communication program, developed by prof.dr. Cees van Riel. On a worldwide basis, it was the first program of its kind offered on a university level. Since then at least four other European universities have started offering MCC program. At present MCC is offered also at Aarhus University, IE Business School in Madrid, Spain (who also offers an Executive Masters of Corporate Communication degree), Sorbonne University, Universit√§t Leipzig, Universidad de Navarra, and Universit√† della Svizzera Italiana. In 2008 the Master of Corporate Communication Program at the Rotterdam School of Management was accredited by the NVAO,NVAO: \\"Besluit toets nieuwe opleiding\\", 2008 the Accreditation Organisation of the Netherlands and Flanders, to hold the Master of Science in Corporate Communication (MSc.

It includes Aragonese poetry, prose and novels. For Aragonese literature in Spanish, see Spanish literature.  Middle Ages  The Glosas Emilianenses (11th century) are the first written testimony in Basque and Aragonese languages. This is known from their finding but it is said that they are written in Spanish. This text has a lot of Aragonese-language features like the article o, a; the diphthongation of duenno, nuestro, sieculo, get (ye) and vocabulary such as honore and aiutorio. From the 11th century all Aragonese documents were written in Latin with Romance features, but it is not until the second part of the 13th century that there is generalization of the use of Aragonese language in all documents, a later date than in Castile or Occitania. From this century there are a lot of works written in Aragonese mixed with Spanish such as Raz√≥n feita d'amor, Lo Libre dels Tres Reys d'Orient or Bida de Santa Mar√≠a Egipciaca. There are still some Aragonese epics texts such as Cantar d'a Campana de Uesca. Prose works show better Medieval Aragonese: os Diez Mandamientos, Romance versions of Fueros d'Arag√≥n; the first examples of history texts in Aragonese such as Liber Regnum. In the 14th century,Johan Ferr√°ndez d'Heredia, Knights Hospitaller's Gran Master, translated some works into Aragonese in Avignon. He made this a language of culture. Other people like Johan de Balbastro or Johan de Tudela also made translations into Aragonese. For example, they translated Zeremonial de Consagrazi√≥n y Coronazi√≥n d'os reis d'Arag√≥n, a Cronica de San Chuan d'a Pe√±a, o Libro del Trasoro, o Libro de Marabiellas d'o Mundo and other works. The second half of the 14th century was the Golden Age of Medieval Aragonese. Since Fernando I of Trastamara Spanish replaced Aragonese as cultural language in Aragon as a castilianization process that ends in the 15th century. After that there are no texts left: only an Exim√©n Aznariz's poem, a book of refrains called Romancea Porverbiorum and a few poems in some Aragonese protocols. From the 15th century there developed a special singularity in this language's literature: Aljamiado in which Aragonese features could stand Spanish influence until their disappearance in 1610. Poema de Yu√ßuf (Poem of Joseph)  Modern era  Since 1500, Spanish has been the language of culture in Aragon: many Aragonese have highlights writing in that language, and in the 17th century the Argensola brothers said they were going to Castile in order to teach them Castilian. Aragonese language, converted in a rural language, and cornered in the Pyrenees, adopted a popular character. The 16th century was a dark century: we only have Aljamiado. In the 17th century there appeared some writers that used this language to characterize popular characters: for example, Ana Abarca de Bolea (Casbas' Abbess) used Semontano Aragonese in some poems. In a literary competition held at Huesca in 1650, Mat√≠as Pradas, Isabel de Rosas and \\"Fileno, monta√±√©s\\" participated with works written in Aragonese. From the 17th and 18th century there are \\"pastoradas\\" where the repat√°n will talk in Aragonese. The theme of the poetry of Ana Francisca Abarca de Bolea is mostly sacred and popular character. In one of them uses the Aragonese language, one of the rare examples of literature Aragonese linguistic features of the seventeenth century. One example is the \\"birth Albada\\" consisting of twenty couplets arromanzadas and Christmas themed, folklore and customs betrays (\\"sung by Pascual Gin√©s and the use of their village and are of the bagpipe '). The comment of the author, \\"the letter gave flare and admired the inventiveness and therefore be retained that ancient language used in Spain\\", indicating that it was not aware of the use of the Aragonese language. These poems were studied by philologists Manuel Alvar, Francho Nagore, M ¬™ Jos√© Manuel Angeles Field or Blecua. Here's an example of his \\"birth Albada\\": The 19th and 20th centuries see the rebirth of Aragonese literature, but its condition of minority language and without a standard reference will leave writers to write about their own topics, mainly parochial, in their own Aragonese dialectal variety. Thus, in 1844 appeared in Almud√©bar Aragonese the novel Vida de Pedro Saputo, written by Braulio Foz. The 20th century features: in Cheso Aragonese, Domingo Miral's comedies of manners and Veremundo M√©ndez poetry; in Ribagor√ßan Graus dialect, the popular writings of Ton√≥n de Baldomera and the verses of Cleto Torrodellas; in Semontano Aragonese, Pedro Arnal Cavero's comedies of manners and the popular Juana Coscujuela novel, A Lueca, istoria d'una mozeta d'o Semontano. After Franco's dictatorship, Aragonese literature was revitalized and now follows the standard model. In 1977, Francho Nagore La√≠n wrote the first grammar of the Aragonese Language. In 1972 √Ånchel Conte published the poetry collection called \\"No deixez morir a m√≠a boz\\". Eduardo Vicente de Vera published \\"Garba y augua\\" (1976) and \\"Do s'amorta l'alba\\", 1977. Years later the number of authors in Aragonese standard language grew (Francho Rod√©s, Chus√© Inazio Nabarro, Miguel Santolaria, Fernando Romanos, Chus√© Raul Us√≥n, Carlos Diest, Josep Carles La√≠nez, √ìscar Latas, Roberto Cort√©s Alonso, Ana Gim√©nez, Carmina Para√≠so Santolaria,...) as well as other authors in various local Aragonese dialects (Nieus Luz√≠a Dueso or Quino Villa in Chistau dialect; Rosario Ust√°riz, Mariv√≠ Nicol√°s, Emilio Gast√≥n or Pepe Lera in Cheso Aragonese, Ricardo Mur, Chus√© Mar√≠a Satu√© and Maximo Palacio Alto Galligo Aragonese, Chuana Coscujuela in Semontano Aragonese or Chus√© Mar√≠a Ferrer, Ana Tena, Toni Collada, Pablo Recio, Elena Chazal u Carmen Cast√°n's works in Ribagor√ßan Graus dialect. In addition, competitions that promote literary creativity in the Aragonese language have come to fruition including events such as the Premio Literario Billa de Sietemo and Premio de Relatos \\"Luis del Val\\".

For visual presentation of measurements, a XML-configured Windows status monitor application is available.  Hardware  The hardware is based on an Atmel AVR microcontroller which can be connected to a PC via a FTDI-USB-serial converter. An ATMega644 is used. The boards are powered by 6 V - 9 V AC and use an 18.4 MHz crystal oscillator. Use of an AC power source permits zero cross detection on the secondary side of the power supply and therefore phase control (PFC) for connected solid state relays. The microcontroller is pre-programmed with a boot loader. It is programmed by its USB port and does not require an external programmer. The faustino platform is geared towards measurement and control engineering by the hobby enthusiast. For that purpose, it is equipped with vibration resistant connectors, a wide temperature range (for example, silicone insulated leads are used), galvanic isolation of the PC interface and support for typical sensors such as ratiometric pressure sensors, thermocouples and a flow meter.

All three aviators were killed: the pilot and navigator of the Phantom and the pilot of the Pawnee. The Phantom pilot was a Royal Air Force Group Captain and station commander of RAF Coningsby. It was the first collision between a civil aircraft and a military fast jet in the United Kingdom low flying military training system. Aircraft The Pawnee registered G-ASVX was a single-engined single-seat crop spraying aircraft built in 1974. The Phantom serial number XV493 was a twin-engined two-seat, all-weather military strike/interceptor aircraft. Accident The Pawnee had departed earlier on 9 August 1974 from Southend Airport to a disused airfield at Broomhill, near Downham Market in Norfolk. Broomhill was used as a temporary base to refuel the aircraft and to load pesticide. At about 14:04 the aircraft had finished spraying a field south of Broomhill and was returning to replenish the pesticide hopper. The Phantom departed RAF Coningsby at 13:51 to fly a low-level navigation and reconnaissance flight at no lower than above ground level. The Phantom was following a standard low- flying route; the Pawnee pilot was aware that military low-flying routes were in the area but the exact routing was classified and not released by the military. About 14:08 about west of the village of Hilgay, and at an estimated height of around the Phantom, flying at a speed of about , struck the Pawnee on its right side. The Pawnee disintegrated, while the Phantom, on fire and shedding parts of its structure, continued on its heading for a further before it hit the ground inverted. All three aviators were killed: the pilot and navigator of the Phantom and the pilot of the Pawnee. Investigation Both aircraft were found to have been maintained correctly and were legally authorised for the flights. Farmwork Services, who had chartered the Pawnee, had informed the local police authority about their proposed operation and type of chemical to be used. Nothing in the regulations required them to inform the military although Farmwork Services had, as usual, informed nearby RAF Marham (an operational airfield about from the accident) that they would be spraying an extensive area of Norfolk between June and the end of August 1974. Investigation of the wreckage failed to determine if either had a working anti-collision light and it was only possible to determine the height of the accident by the use of eyewitness accounts. The collision occurred in good visibility at an estimated height above ground level of . The investigation could find no evidence to suggest that either of the pilots had a medical problem or that either aircraft had any defect that would have contributed to the accident. The rules of the air state that the Pawnee should have given way to the Phantom which was closing from the right. But it was accepted that at a closing speed of about the time needed by the Pawnee pilot to assess the situation and execute a manoeuvre was minimal. It was also a requirement of the Phantom pilot to make sure that he did not collide with the Pawnee but clearly in this accident the lack of time was an element. Also the military aircraft had only just turned on to the heading and with the Pawnee 15¬∞ to his left the view may well have been obstructed by the Phantom's canopy frame. While it accepted the need for the Royal Air Force to practise low level high-speed flying the investigation report was concerned about the lack of information on the military low-flying route available to civil pilots, particularly those involved with crop spraying, pipeline, and powerline inspection. Cause The investigation determined \\"The accident occurred because neither pilot saw the other aircraft in time to avoid collision. The 'see and be seen' principle was inadequate for preventing collision in the circumstances that existed. A significant feature which contributed to the accident was the absence of any system for co-ordinating military and civil low flying activities in the low flying areas and link routes.\\" Recommendations The accident report made seven recommendations: # That the location and vertical extent of the low flying areas and link routes should be made available. # Private pilots should be alerted to the nature of military low flying activities and the need to avoid them. #An advisory service be provided to enable civil pilots to co-ordinate their activities with the military. #That civil aircraft involved in low-flying activities should be painted as conspicuously as possible and fitted with high power collision warning lights preferably strobe type. Also recommended that the military consider fitment of strobe type high power collision warning lights to aircraft engaged in low level training. #The military review their need for airspace for low level high speed operations and withdraw any areas not needed. #That the upper limit of the military low flying link routes be limited to instead of , if not possible then should be considered. #That the rules of the air be amended to allow aircraft with the right of way to climb and if necessary pass over the other aircraft.

His finances were never securely based and he was forced into bankruptcy on three occasions. Early days (to 1857) Dickson was born in Berwick-on-Tweed in about 1819. He first appears in the historical record in Ireland in 1840 when he married Elizabeth McMurray of Drogheda. His first daughter Catherine was born the following year at Killyman in County Tyrone. He remained in Ireland until 1847, and judging by the places of birth of subsequent children he was on the move all the time ‚Äì Helen was born in County Sligo (1842), James in Dublin (1844) and Anna in Drogheda (1845). He appears to have been involved in some capacity under William Dargan on the construction of the Dublin and Drogheda Railway (1841-4) and the Great Southern and Western Railway (1845-7). There is also a possibility that he worked under Dargan on the Ulster Canal. In 1847 Dickson left Ireland and returned to England, settling at Wellington, Shropshire, for reasons that are still not entirely clear, but where he quite quickly established himself as a person of some influence, especially in the still relatively new field of railway engineering. In 1852 he went into partnership with one McKensie (or McKenzie) and founded the Shropshire Works on a site adjacent to the Shrewsbury and Birmingham Railway, between Wellington and Oakengates.Ken Jones, The Wenlock Branch, Wellington to Craven Arms (Usk : The Oakwood Press, 1998), p 37 According to a contemporary newspaper report, the Shropshire Works occupied a site of eight acres and possessed \\"appliances for making and constructing almost every article connected with a railway, from the simple block of wood that secure the rail to the sleepers, to the carriages which roll over them.\\"The Wellington Journal, August 1855, quoted by Jones, ibid. Dickson and McKensie were said to have sunk ¬£30,000 in the venture and some time before the publication of the report had completed 170 wagons for the Newport & Abergavenny Railway Company, \\"in a short space of two months,\\" and were engaged on the production of \\"a large number of passenger carriages\\" for the Great Western Railway company. Early in his time at Wellington, Dickson made the acquaintance of Alfred Darby (I), a member of the celebrated Shropshire iron-founding dynasty and the then manager of the family's Coalbrookdale Works. It seems likely that one reason Dickson chose to settle at Wellington is that he had successfully tendered for a portion of the Shrewsbury and Birmingham Railway line between Shrewsbury, Wellington and Oakengates, which was constructed during the years 1847-9. Two years after the opening of the S & BR, in February 1851, Dickson constructed, apparently at his own expense, a branch line from Waterloo sidings, east of Wellington, to the Ketley Ironworks and entered into an agreement with the latter to work all traffic, whether by rail or road, from the works to the S & BR.Jones, ibid. Dickson and McKensie worked on two further local railway contracts, the Madeley branch of the Shrewsbury and Birmingham Railway (completed in 1854) and the Ketley-Horsehay section of the Wellington and Severn Junction Railway (1855-7).D.

Pt VI ([London] : Union Publications, 1982), p 6 The latter contract undoubtedly owed much to Dickson's association with Darby and the Coalbrookdale Company, who were expected to subscribe to the line, and indeed the alignment made use of, and superseded, his earlier private railway to the Ketley ironworks for a short distance. Dickson had in fact surveyed the entire line from Ketley to Lightmoor, and given evidence before the House of Lords committee that examined the Bill, but was only awarded the contract for the northern portion of the undertaking, work on which was begun with much pomp and ceremony in August 1855. In October 1855 it was reported that the works were in active progress and that the cost of building the line would be about ¬£4,000 to ¬£5,000 per mile, but at a shareholders' meeting in March 1860 the Chairman revealed that the actual cost had been much nearer ¬£13,000 per mile. Dickson had tendered less than ¬£10,000 for the entire contract, from which it appears that he had woefully underestimated the cost.Jones, op. cit., pp 39-42 Unsurprisingly, in January 1857 he was made a bankrupt for the first time. Ironically, work on the Ketley-Horsehay line was in a sufficiently advanced state for a trial run to be made by shareholders in February 1857,Wellington Journal, 21 February 1857 and for it to be opened for goods and mineral traffic on 1 May of the same year. In addition to these works on his own doorstep, Dickson tendered unsuccessfully in 1855 for the Llanidloes and Newtown Railway.Ivor Bulmer-Thomas, Top Sawyer: a biography of David Davies of Llandinam (London : Longmans, Green, 1938), pp 33-4 Under the aegis of the Shropshire Works, he also operated a rolling stock business at this period and is known to have tendered for the supply of ballast wagons and wheels to the South Wales Railway in 1855 and to have supplied carriages to the Llanelly Railway in 1856Lawrence Popplewell, A Gazetteer of the railway contractors and engineers of Wales and the Borders 1830-1914 (Bournemouth : Melledgen Press, 1984), pp [12-13] and also wagons and brake vans to the Belfast and County Down Railway at much the same time.Edward M. Patterson, The Belfast & County Down Railway (Newton Abbot : David & Charles, 1982), p 35) In 1854 Dickson, in partnership with J.G. McKenzie, won his first contract in south Wales, an area that was to become his home for most of the rest of his life. This was for the Gyfylchi Tunnel on the South Wales Mineral Railway.The Cambrian 2 August, 9 August, 16 September 1854 The financial position of the railway company prevented an immediate start being made until 1856 when he was additionally offered a contract to construct the entire line. He started work in April 1856The Cambrian 28 March 1856 but made little progress and in September 1856 Brunel, the engineer of the SWMR, was instructed to pay off Dickson and re-let the contract. In July 1855 Dickson won a contract from the Swansea Harbour Trust for various work connected with the town's North Dock.The Cambrian 13 July 1855 This was followed by a number of further contracts in 1855-6 for related work. Most of the work was still uncompleted when he was declared bankrupt on 20 January 1857. He was described as 'Builder, Stone and Timber merchant, Brickmaker and Contractor for Public Works'.The London Gazette, 23 January 1857, p 264 Activities around Swansea and Neath (1857-1867) The period between Dickson's first and second bankruptcies was the most active and successful of his career with the construction of two railways (albeit of modest length) and the promotion of many other schemes which failed to materialise because his vision outstripped his resources. The methods which were adopted by Dickson and his backers in the financing of both these railways were typical of those employed on other 'contractors' lines', a phenomenon that was particularly prevalent at this period.For a discussion of 'contractors' lines' and their finances, including specific references to Dickson, see Harold Pollins, 'Railway contractors and the finance of railway development in Britain' in Railways in the Victorian economy: studies in finance and economic growth, ed. M.C. Reed (Newton Abbot : David & Charles, 1969), pp 212-28 Dickson was discharged on 3 June 1857The London Gazette, 9 June 1857, p 2044 and settled near Neath, presumably hoping to build on the contacts he had made in the area since 1853. During the years 1859-61 he claimed to have been involved in some way with the promotion of the Swansea and Neath Railway (the extension into Swansea of the Vale of Neath Railway), although it is not possible to establish the exact role that he played in this.Dickson's claims to have taken a leading part in the promotion of the Swansea & Neath Railway are based on his own statement in The Cambrian, 14 May 1886, p 8c, and on a further letter by Dickson quoted by E.E. Rowse, Proposed re-opening of Wind Street station and Swansea on the main line (priv. print, c1890) In 1861, having assembled a group of financial backers, Dickson promoted the Dulais Valley Mineral Railway, a scheme to build a short line from the Vale of Neath Railway at Neath up the Dulais Valley to Banwen with a view to opening up the coal reserves of the valley. It was authorised in 1862.25 & 26 Vict c. cxciii. Royal Assent 29 July 1862 The following year Parliament approved the extension of the railway to Brecon and the change of its name to the Neath and Brecon Railway.26 & 27 Vict c. cxxx. Royal Assent 13 July 1863 Where it crossed the Great Forest of Brecon the route of the extension followed the now disused Brecon Forest Tramroad which Dickson purchased in 1863. He saw the railway as potentially forming part of a link from the Midlands and north of England to south Wales and he probably had hopes of selling it on completion to one of the major English companies.For a history of the company, see Gwyn Briwnant-Jones, Denis Dunstone and Tudor Watkins, The Neath and Brecon Railway: a history (Llandysul : Gomer, 2005) Also in 1863, in partnership with one Russell, Dickson won a contract to construct the Anglesey Central Railway. As was typical of contractors' lines at this period, Dickson & Russell were willing to accept payment in shares.For a history of this company, although with little mention of Dickson's involvement, see J.M. Dunn, 'The Anglesey Central Railway', Railway Magazine, v 106 (1960) pp 225-30, 248 The construction and operation of these two lines were to occupy him until his second bankruptcy in 1867 but at the same time as he was working on their construction he was also preparing plans and for far- reaching extensions to the Neath and Brecon Railway. These included extensions from Sennybridge to the Central Wales Line at Llangammarch Wells27 & 28 Vict c. cccxvi. Royal Assent 29 July 1864 and a short line to connect the N&BR; to the Swansea Vale Railway near Ystalyfera27 & 28 Vict c. ccxciii. Royal Assent 29 July 1864 which was later to be constructed (although not by Dickson) as the Swansea Vale and Neath and Brecon Junction Railway. Both of these projects were authorised by Parliament in 1864, but a grandiose plan to extend the N&BR; into Swansea and build a central station in the town was rejected in the same session. In 1863 Dickson started to build St Andrew's Presbyterian church in Swansea for the benefit of the Scottish community in the town. It was completed in 1864 and opened on 12 August.F.C. Glover, 'The Founding of St Andrew's Swansea', Journal of the Presbyterian Historical Society of England, 13 (1966), pp 102-5 A renewed attempt to extend the N&BR; to Swansea was made in 1864, this time by purchasing the Swansea Canal and building the railway on its banks, but this too failed. Also in 1864 Dickson and others formulated plans to purchase the Oystermouth Railway at Swansea and build a main-line railway alongside it to a deep-water harbour at Mumbles. In pursuit of this goal he acquired the foreshore rights all round Swansea Bay from the Duke of Beaufort in June 1864 and in October reached an agreement with George Byng Morris, the mortgagee in possession, to purchase the Oystermouth Railway. However, his Mumbles Railway & Pier Bill of 1865 failed to win the approval of Parliament.Dickson's own version of his actions and purposes at this time is given in a statement by him published in The Cambrian 14 May 1886, and in a letter by him in the same paper, 4 June 1886 Further schemes with which Dickson was connected at this period were the Afon Valley Railway of 1865 running up the Afan valley from Port Talbot and the Aberdare & Central Wales Railway of 1866 which was intended to link the N&BR; to the Taff Vale Railway at Aberdare and so make the N&BR; part of a through route from the north of England to Cardiff as well as to Swansea. Both schemes were successful in obtaining Acts of Parliament28 & 29 Vict c. ccclxxvi, Royal Assent 6 July 1865 (Afon Valley R.); 29 & 30 Vict c. ccciv, Royal Assent 30 July 1865 (Aberdare & Central Wales R.) but no work was carried out on either. Further attempts to obtain authorisation for a railway to Mumbles and a deep-water harbour and for a central station in Swansea were once again unsuccessful. The Anglesey Central Railway was opened in stages between 1864 and 1867. The Neath and Brecon Railway was completed in 1866 and the formal opening took place on 13 September 1866The Cambrian 14 September 1866 although regular passenger traffic did not commence until 3 June 1867.The Times 5 June 1867 p 5e Dickson worked the traffic on both lines. A feature of particular interest was his use of the first Fairlie locomotives, Progress and Mountaineer, on the N&BR; and of Mountaineer on the ACR.The Locomotives of the Great Western Railway. Pt 10 : Absorbed engines 1922-1947 (Railway Correspondence and Travel Society, 1966), pp K235-7 He also made a start on the construction of the line from Sennybridge to Llangammarch Wells but this section was only partly finished when he was made bankrupt for a second time on 9 September 1867The London Gazette, 20 September 1867, p 5190 and was never completed. His finances had become overstretched and he was a belated victim of the collapse of the bank of Overend and Gurney in May 1866 which had resulted in the failure of a number of other railway contractors. Activities in the north of England (1867-1874) Dickson was discharged on 16 March 1868The London Gazette, 20 March 1868, p 1810 following which he moved to Liverpool. The reason for this is not clear. In 1866 Parliament authorised the Whitby Redcar and Middlesbrough Union Railway.Ken Hoole, The Whitby, Redcar and Middlesbrough Union Railway (Nelson : Hendon Publishing, 1981) No attempt was made to start construction until 1871 when a contract was let to Dickson. He started work in May 1871The Times 26 May 1871, p 10b but his lack of progress gave rise to concern and in December 1873 he was dismissed from the contract. A report then made by T.E. Harrison, the Engineer of the North Eastern Railway details bridges and viaducts that were badly designed and badly built, inaccurate surveying, poor workmanship, and bad design in general. One three-mile section had been built along the side of the cliffs and had already started to fall into the sea.K. Hoole, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain. Volume 4. The North East (Newton Abbot : David & Charles, 1965), p 26 The viaducts were built to Dickson's own design with tubular wrought-iron piers filled with concrete.'Viaducts on the Whitby, Redcar, and Middlesbrough Railway', The Engineer 14 March 1873, pp 151, 158 At the same time Dickson was also working on a contract from the Mersey Railway. This company had been incorporated in 1871 with powers to build a railway under the river between Liverpool and Birkenhead. Dickson was awarded a contractJohn W. Gahan, The Line beneath the Liners (Weston-super-Mare : Avon-Anglia, 1983) p 10 to sink shafts to the depth at which the boring of the actual tunnel could be undertaken by the Diamond Boring Machine Co. He started work in April 1872 by sinking a shaft on the Birkenhead side and by March 1873 this shaft had been sunk to full tunnel depth.The Cambrian 7 March 1873 In November 1873 the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board accepted a tender from Dickson for the enlargement and alteration of the Canada basin and other related works but it is doubtful if any significant progress was made.The Cambrian 5 December 1873 It is clear that Dickson was attempting to undertake contracts that were out of proportion to the financial resources that he could command. He was under- capitalised and suffered from cash-flow problems. Not surprisingly, he was declared bankrupt for a third time on 3 December 1874. Return to Swansea (1874-1892) By 1877 Dickson had returned to Swansea where he lived on the outskirts of Oystermouth. In that year the newly formed Swansea Improvements and Tramway Company reached an agreement with George Byng Morris, still mortgagee in possession, to take over the working of the Oystermouth Railway with a view to integrating it with the street tramways that they were constructing. Dickson (through his trustee in bankruptcy) challenged this in the courts, since he still claimed the right to complete the agreement he had made with Morris in 1865. The courts upheld his claim and the railway was put up for sale that autumn. It was bought by Dickson's associates on his behalf Dickson, by now discharged from bankruptcy, started to run a steam-hauled service along the line in 1878 and in 1879 formed the Swansea and Mumbles Railway to buy the Oystermouth Railway from him. However, under the terms of their agreement with Morris, the SITC also had the right to operate over the line and for the next ten or more years there was fierce and often acrimonious competition.Charles E. Lee, The Swansea & Mumbles Railway 2nd ed (Lingfield : Oakwood Press, [1954, repr with additions 1970]), pp 19-21 Dickson's involvement with the Swansea and Mumbles Railway ceased in 1885 when Sir John Jones Jenkins took a lease of the railway. He suffered what appears to have been a stroke in about 1890 and died on 13 June 1892. He was buried in his family vault in the churchyard at Wellington.

Its corporate banking activities range from advising, structuring, financing and co-investing across debt and equity in Northwest Europe with a focus on the Netherlands and Germany. The retail banking activities primarily consist of mortgage lending in the Netherlands and online retail savings products and services in the Netherlands, Germany and Belgium via the NIBC Direct brand. NIBC Bank N.V. is a 100 per cent subsidiary of NIBC Holding N.V., a listed entity which is in turn majority owned by a consortium of international financial institutions and investors organised by J.C. Flowers & Co.. NIBC has offices in The Hague, Amsterdam, Frankfurt, London and Brussels. As of 2016, NIBC Bank was the ninth-largest bank in the Netherlands in terms of total assets.  History NIBC was incorporated on 31 October 1945 as Maatschappij tot Financiering van Nationaal Herstel by the Dutch government along with a number of commercial banks and institutional investors to provide financing for the post-World War II economic recovery of the Netherlands. This entity was renamed De Nationale Investeringsbank (\\"DNIB\\") in 1971 and was listed on the Dutch stock exchange, now Euronext Amsterdam, from 1986 to 1999. During this time, DNIB focused on providing and participating in long-term loans and private equity investments. In 1996, DNIB started its retail business through the offering of white label residential mortgages. In 1999, DNIB was acquired by way of a public offer made through a joint venture company, NIB Capital, owned by two of Europe‚Äôs largest pension funds, ABP and PGGM. NIB Capital acquired 85 per cent of the shares in DNIB. The remaining shares remained owned by the Dutch government and were acquired by NIB Capital in 2004. The acquisition by NIB Capital in 1999 marked the beginning of DNIB‚Äôs evolution from a long-term lending bank to a bank offering advisory, financing and investment services. In 2005, a consortium of international financial institutions and investors organised by J.C. Flowers & Co., a U.S.-based private investment firm, purchased all the outstanding equity interests of NIB Capital. In connection with this acquisition, NIBC Holding N.V. was incorporated and NIB Capital, which was renamed NIBC N.V., became its wholly owned subsidiary. Subsequently, NIBC N.V. (as the non-surviving entity) merged into NIBC Holding N.V. (as acquiring company) and NIB Capital Bank became the holding's direct subsidiary. NIB Capital Bank subsequently changed its name to NIBC Bank N.V. In 2014, NIBC acquired Gallinat-Bank AG in Germany, which was later renamed to NIBC Bank Deutschland AG. NIBC‚Äôs Corporate Client Offering activities in Germany are being conducted predominantly from this entity. This entity funds itself in the German corporate and institutional market and is covered by the German Einlagensicherungsfonds (\\"ESF\\"). In June 2016 NIBC Bank finalised the acquisition of SNS Securities N.V. The activities of SNS Securities continue to be operated under the name NIBC Markets, which merged into NIBC Bank in June 2017. With the acquisition of SNS Securities, NIBC expanded its service offering with capital market solutions, equity and fixed income brokerage and research.

He played for SC Aufbau Magdeburg, later renamed 1. FC Magdeburg in the East German top flight, the DDR-Oberliga. He won the East German cup competition FDGB-Pokal three times and played for his country four times at junior level. Career Walter's footballing career began in 1947 in Burg bei Magdeburg where he played for BSG Lokomotive Burg (until 1954) and BSG Einheit Burg. In 1959 the talented attacker joined the regional focus club, SC Aufbau Magdeburg. The Magdeburg club had just won promotion to the DDR-Oberliga and 19-year-old Walter played his first match right on the first day of the 1960 season. After mixed results in the league, SC Aufbau won their first title in the 1963-64 season when they won the FDGB-Pokal. In the final against SC Leipzig on 13 June 1964 Walter played as an outside forward on the right flank and scored two goals, leveling the game after Magdeburg had already trailed 0‚Äì2. In the next season, SC Aufbau again reached the cup final and it was again Walter who scored an important goal: the 1‚Äì1 equalizer against SC Motor Jena. The match ended 2‚Äì1, with Magdeburg winning their second title. however, the 1965-66 season ended in disappointment when the club was relegated. Walter only played one year in the second-tier DDR-Liga, his 4 goals in 13 matches helping the club secure immediate re-promotion. After finishing third in the 1867-68 season Magdeburg and Walter won their third title, beating FC Karl- Marx-Stadt 4‚Äì0 in the FDGB-Pokal final. Walter scored his fourth cup final goal, making it 2‚Äì0 to Magdeburg. This remains a record which he shares with Jena's famed Peter Ducke. Between 1959 and 1962 Walter had played for East Germany's youth teams on four occasions. By winning the cup, Magdeburg qualified for the European Cup Winners' Cup, allowing Walter to gather more experience on international level. Altogether the club played 13 matches during Walter's career and he missed but one: The first leg in the quarter final match of the 1965‚Äì66 European Cup Winners' Cup against West Ham United. In the return leg, Walter scored for Magdeburg to take the lead, but in the end the club suffered a 1‚Äì2 aggregate defeat and the match remained Walter's last international competitive match. Joachim Walter stayed with 1. FC Magdeburg until the end of the 1969-70 season, playing in 278 competitive matches: 228 in the DDR-Oberliga, 13 in the DDR-Liga, 25 in the FDGB-Pokal and 12 in the Cup Winners' Cup.

Such materials can be sensitive to a number of factors, such as temperature, humidity, pH, chemical compounds, the wavelength or intensity of light or an electrical or magnetic field and can respond in various ways, like altering colour or transparency, becoming conductive or permeable to water or changing shape (shape memory polymers). Usually, slight changes in the environment are sufficient to induce large changes in the polymer's properties.M.Shahinpoor and H.-J. Schneider, Eds. Intelligent Materials; Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge UK, 2007.http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/eBook/978-0-85404-335-4M. Schwartz, Ed.

They are used for sensors and actuators such as artificial muscles , the production of hydrogels, biodegradable packaging, and to a great extent in biomedical engineering . One example is a polymer that undergoes conformational change in response to pH change, which can be used in drug delivery. Another is a humidity-sensitive polymer used in self-adaptive wound dressings that automatically regulate moisture balance in and around the wound. The nonlinear response of smart polymers is what makes them so unique and effective. A significant change in structure and properties can be induced by a very small stimulus. Once that change occurs, there is no further change, meaning a predictable all-or-nothing response occurs, with complete uniformity throughout the polymer. Smart polymers may change conformation, adhesiveness or water retention properties, due to slight changes in pH, ionic strength, temperature or other triggers. Another factor in the effectiveness of smart polymers lies in the inherent nature of polymers in general. The strength of each molecule's response to changes in stimuli is the composite of changes of individual monomer units which, alone, would be weak. However, these weak responses, compounded hundreds or thousands of times, create a considerable force for driving biological processes. The pharmacy industry has been directly related to the polymer‚Äôs advances. In this field, polymers are playing a significant role, and its advances are helping entire populations around the world. The human body is a machine with a complex system and works as a response to chemical signals. Polymers play the role of drug delivery technology that can control the release of therapeutic agents in periodic doses. Polymers are capable of molecular recognition and directing intracellular delivery. Smart polymers get into the field to play and take advantage of the molecular recognition and finally produced awareness systems and polymer-carriers to facilitate drug delivery in the body system. Stimuli Several polymer systems respond to temperature, undergoing a lower critical solution temperature phase transition. One of the better-studied such polymers is poly(N-isopropylacryamide), with a transition temperature of approximately 33 ¬∞C. Several homologous N-alkyl acrylamides also show LCST behavior, with the transition temperature depending on the length of the hydrophobic side chain. Above their transition temperature, these polymers become insoluble in water. This behavior is believed to be entropy driven. Classification and chemistry Currently, the most prevalent use for smart polymers in biomedicine is for specifically targeted drug delivery. Since the advent of timed-release pharmaceuticals, scientists have been faced with the problem of finding ways to deliver drugs to a particular site in the body without having them first degrade in the highly acidic stomach environment. Prevention of adverse effects to healthy bone and tissue is also an important consideration. Researchers have devised ways to use smart polymers to control the release of drugs until the delivery system has reached the desired target. This release is controlled by either a chemical or physiological trigger. Linear and matrix smart polymers exist with a variety of properties depending on reactive functional groups and side chains. These groups might be responsive to pH, temperature, ionic strength, electric or magnetic fields, and light. Some polymers are reversibly cross-linked by noncovalent bonds that can break and reform depending on external conditions. Nanotechnology has been fundamental in the development of certain nanoparticle polymers such as dendrimers and fullerenes, that have been applied for drug delivery. Traditional drug encapsulation has been done using lactic acid polymers. More recent developments have seen the formation of lattice-like matrices that hold the drug of interest integrated or entrapped between the polymer strands. Smart polymer matrices release drugs by a chemical or physiological structure- altering reaction, often a hydrolysis reaction resulting in cleavage of bonds and release of drug as the matrix breaks down into biodegradable components. The use of natural polymers has given way to artificially synthesized polymers such as polyanhydrides, polyesters, polyacrylic acids, poly(methyl methacrylates), and polyurethanes. Hydrophilic, amorphous, low-molecular- weight polymers containing heteroatoms (i.e., atoms other than carbon) have been found to degrade fastest. Scientists control the rate of drug delivery by varying these properties thus adjusting the rate of degradation. A graft-and- block copolymer is two different polymers grafted together. A number of patents already exist for different combinations of polymers with different reactive groups. The product exhibits properties of both individual components which adds a new dimension to a smart polymer structure, and may be useful for certain applications. Cross-linking hydrophobic and hydrophilic polymers results in formation of micelle-like structures that can protectively assist drug delivery through aqueous medium until conditions at the target location cause simultaneous breakdown of both polymers. A graft-and-block approach might be useful for solving problems encountered by the use of a common bioadhesive polymer, polyacrylic acid (PAAc). PAAc adheres to mucosal surfaces but will swell and degrade rapidly at pH 7.4, resulting in rapid release of drugs entrapped in its matrix. A combination of PAAc with another polymer that is less sensitive to changes at neutral pH might increase the residence time and slow the release of the drug, thus improving bioavailability and effectiveness. Hydrogels are polymer networks that do not dissolve in water but swell or collapse in changing aqueous environments. They are useful in biotechnology for phase separation because they are reusable or recyclable. New ways to control the flow, or catch and release of target compounds, in hydrogels, are being investigated. Highly specialized hydrogels have been developed for the delivery and release of drugs into specific tissues. Hydrogels made from PAAc are especially common because of their bioadhesive properties and tremendous absorbency. Enzyme immobilization in hydrogels is a fairly well-established process. Reversibly cross-linked polymer networks and hydrogels can be similarly applied to a biological system where the response and release of a drug is triggered by the target molecule itself. Alternatively, the response might be turned on or off by the product of an enzyme reaction. This is often done by incorporating an enzyme, receptor or antibody, that binds to the molecule of interest, into the hydrogel. Once bound, a chemical reaction takes place that triggers a reaction from the hydrogel. The trigger can be oxygen, sensed using oxidoreductase enzymes, or a pH-sensing response. An example of the latter is combined entrapment of glucose oxidase and insulin in a pH-responsive hydrogel. In the presence of glucose, the formation of gluconic acid by the enzyme triggers release of insulin from the hydrogel. Two criteria for this technology to work effectively are enzyme stability and rapid kinetics (quick response to the trigger and recovery after removal of the trigger). Several strategies have been tested in type 1 diabetes research, involving the use of similar types of smart polymers that can detect changes in blood glucose levels and trigger production or release of insulin. Likewise, there are many possible applications of similar hydrogels as drug delivery agents for other conditions and diseases. Other Applications Smart polymers are not just for drug delivery. Their properties make them especially suited for bioseparations. The time and costs involved in purifying proteins might be reduced significantly by using smart polymers that undergo rapid reversible changes in response to a change in medium properties. Conjugated systems have been used for many years in physical and affinity separations and immunoassays. Microscopic changes in the polymer structure are manifested as precipitate formation, which may be used to aid separation of trapped proteins from solution. These systems work when a protein or other molecule that is to be separated from a mix, forms a bioconjugate with the polymer, and precipitates with the polymer when its environment undergoes a change. The precipitate is removed from the media, thus separating the desired component of the conjugate from the rest of the mixture. Removal of this component from the conjugate depends on recovery of the polymer and a return to its original state, thus hydrogels are very useful for such processes. Another approach to controlling biological reactions using smart polymers is to prepare recombinant proteins with built-in polymer binding sites close to ligand or cell binding sites. This technique has been used to control ligand and cell binding activity, based on a variety of triggers including temperature and light. Smart polymers play an essential part in the technology of self-adaptive wound dressings. The dressing design presents proprietary super-absorbent synthetic smart polymers immobilized in the 3-dimensional fiber matrix with added hydration functionality achieved by embedding hydrogel into the core of the material. The dressing's mode of action relies on the ability of the polymers to sense and adapt to the changing humidity and fluid content in all areas of the wound simultaneously and to automatically and reversibly switch from absorption to hydration. The smart polymer action ensures the active synchronized response of the dressing material to changes in and around the wound to support the optimal moist healing environment at all times. Future applications It has been suggested that polymers might be developed that can learn and self-correct behavior over time. Although this might be a far distant possibility, there are other more feasible applications that appear to be coming in the near future. One of these is the idea of smart toilettes that analyze urine and help identify health problems. In environmental biotechnology, smart irrigation systems have been also proposed. It would be incredibly useful to have a system that turns on and off, and controls fertilizer concentrations, based on soil moisture, pH and nutrient levels. Many creative approaches to targeted drug delivery systems that self-regulate based on their unique cellular surroundings, are also under investigation. There are obvious possible problems associated with the use of smart polymers in biomedicine. The most worrisome is the possibility of toxicity or incompatibility of artificial substances in the body, including degradation products and byproducts. However, smart polymers have enormous potential in biotechnology and biomedical applications if these obstacles can be overcome.

Their first album, Shrinebuilder, was released in October 2009. History=Founding The band's origins were established around 2003‚Äì04, when Al Cisneros of the band Om contacted Scott \\"Wino\\" Weinrich and proposed that they form a new collaborative three piece group with Om drummer Chris Hakius. Cisneros named the band, and it was intended that Wino would be the only vocalist. A few years later, and after sporadically working on some music together, Cisneros enlisted Neurosis frontman Scott Kelly on guitar and vocals to round out the band to a four-piece. Of the request to join Shrinebuilder, Kelly added \\"He [Cisneros] told me that this would be the name when he asked me to join and I thought it was great. It makes sense to me. I think music is shrine, music is religion, music is a way of life. It has its own mythology, it has its own theology, it has its own gods.\\" As time passed, word and anticipation began to gather on the internet about this new act. Shrinebuilder were becoming well known, yet nothing had been heard regarding the act. In early 2008, drummer Chris Hakius decided to retire from playing music, and as a result, Dale Crover of Melvins was brought in to replace him. Over the next year the band sent computer files to one another, refining their material, and rehearsed when possible in various configurations of two or three in Baltimore, San Francisco, Ashland and Los Angeles. Debut album In January 2009 the full band met together for the first time to set about recording the material they had previously sketched out. Kelly documented the recording sessions via his blog site \\"We Burn Through The Night\\". The debut Shrinebuilder record was recorded in three days, with Crover and Toshi Kasai (collectively known as The Deaf Nephews) producing. Commenting upon the recording experience, Kelly stated, \\"The sheer weight of it all pushed this thing into another realm the moment the decision was made to do this. The fifth member of Shrinebuilder is the godhead. This record honours the traditions set forth by all those that walked through these endless halls before us.\\" Wino later added some additional guitar overdubs, and the album was released in October 2009. Following the album's release, the band announced a string of concerts, and the first Shrinebuilder track, \\"Pyramid Of The Moon,\\" was added to the band's Myspace page. On November 11, 2009, Club My War arranged and hosted the band's first live show in the United States at The Viper Room. The band played two sets and the show was praised by Scott Kelly as a success. Since that time Shrinebuilder have played sporadically as and when the members schedules have allowed. Whilst unable to fly over to Europe to tour during the Eyjafjallaj√∂kull volcano eruption of 2010, the band returned to LA and completed the writing stage of their second record. One year later the band performed on the main stage at the 16th Roadburn festival in Tilburg, the Netherlands which they had been set to appear at in 2010 had the volcano eruption not hindered flights. In an interview in late 2012, Kelly stated that he didn't know if there would be another Shrinebuilder album. In a May 2014 interview with Wino, he stated that \\"Cisneros is insane so Shrinebuilder is not going to happen.\\" Discography * Shrinebuilder (Neurot Recordings, 2009) Members *Al Cisneros (Om, Sleep, Asbestosdeath) ‚Äì bass, vocals *Scott \\"Wino\\" Weinrich (The Hidden Hand, Spirit Caravan, Saint Vitus, Place of Skulls, The Obsessed) ‚Äì guitar, vocals *Scott Kelly (Neurosis, Tribes of Neurot, Blood and Time) ‚Äì guitar, vocals *Dale Crover (Melvins, Altamont, The Men of Porn, Nirvana) ‚Äì drums References Category:Heavy metal supergroups Category:American doom metal musical groups Category:Musical groups established in 2008 Category:Stoner rock musical groups Category:Musical quartets ","title":"Shrinebuilder"},{"id":"24500644","text":"Najm ul-Din Abul-Qasim Ja'far bin al-Hasan bin Yahya bin al-Hasan bin Sa'id, famous as al-Muhaqqiq al-Hilli and al-Muhaqqiq al-Awwal ( 1205 ‚Äì 1277)Calder et al. (2003) Classical Islam: A Sourcebook, p.219 was an influential Shi'i Mujtahid born in the city of al-Hilla, Iraq. He played an important role in shaping Twelver Shi'ism's legal doctrines works. His legal manual, Shara'i ul- Islam, has been particularly influential, attracting more than thirty commentaries. Life Muhaqqiq was born in the city of al-Hilla, Iraq, where he would spend most of his life, to a family of prominent Shi'i jurists. He studied theology, fiqh and usul al-fiqh under his father. Muhaqqiq later became the leader of the Shi'i seminary there; when Nasruddin Tusi visited the town as the representative of Hulagu, he addressed Muhaqqiq as the representative of the city's scholarly elite. Intellectual Output Muhaqqiq produced an impressive scholarly corpus during his life, treating subjects ranging from fiqh and usul al-fiqh to ethics, theology, philology and even a few volumes of poetry. His most important work by far is Shara'i ul-Islam, a comprehensive manual of law. It is arguably one of the most important Shi'i legal works ever written, as shown by the large number (more than thirty) of commentaries written on it by later scholars. It has been translated into both Persian and Russian, and was used in British India as the standard statement of Shi'ite Muslim law. In the Shara'i, he divides the law into four distinct categories: acts of devotion (e.g. prayer, fasting), bilateral legal acts (e.g. marriage), unilateral legal acts (e.g. divorce) and rules (e.g. of inheritance). This classification was followed by later jurists.Kohlberg, E. ·∏§ELLI, NAJM-AL-DIN ABU‚ÄôL-QƒÄSEM JA øFAR. Encyclopedia Iranica. (http://www.iranica.com/ accessed 28.09.2009) Another important work of his is Ma'arij ul-Usul, written in the field of usul al-fiqh (jurisprudential methodology). In it, he stresses the centrality of the Shi'i jurist (mujtahid) during the time of the Occultation in deriving a proper understanding of the Shari'ah from the Qur'an, Hadith and statements of the Twelve Imams. In this way, Muhaqqiq's legal theory is heavily indebted to the classical Sunni approach to legal methodology. Whereas before him, it was the authority of the Hadith and not of the Mujtahid that was obeyed.Kohlberg, E. ·∏§ELLI,NAJM-AL-DIN ABU‚ÄôL-QƒÄSEM JA øFAR. Encyclopedia Iranica.

Little is known of his early life, but he was trained as a surveyor before arriving at the Swan River Colony as part of Thomas Peel's settlement scheme, on board Gilmore in December 1829. He brought surveying instruments with him, but at first he did not seek surveying work, preferring to establish himself as a farmer upon his grant. He was independently wealthy and had brought servants with him to work his land grant. But in February 1830 his camp was burnt out in a bushfire and he lost ¬£600 worth of goods, including most of his surveying tools. He used his remaining capital to support himself and his servants for the next year, but in 1831 he had no money left and had to release his employees from their agreements. In April 1831 he married Ann Smythe.  Timber merchant and saw- miller  Early land grants in the Swan River colony, 1839. Thomas Watson's grant is in the lower left, beside Thomas Peel's. Watson was granted 1000 acres of land at the southern end of Thomsons Lake, which he used to source timber. It corresponded roughly with today's Wattleup. In May 1833 he was advertising his timber for sale as \\"30 tons of very superior mahogany, in the log, well seasoned\\". The timber was tuart. He obtained an order for 50 tons of timber, but could not find the men to cut it and by the time he had enlisted a labour force the men who had placed the order had already left the colony. He attempted to obtain a government contract for his timber, and in the meantime transported planks to Thomas Peel's Clarence settlement to be exported. The export ships never arrived, and Watson gave up his attempts to work his timber grant. In 1839, his entire grant was bought for ¬£60 by George Leake, a Fremantle solicitor.  Surveyor  Due to his financial hardships, in 1831 he applied to the Governor for a job and was offered the position of temporary chainer in the Survey Department, which he carried on side by side with his timber enterprise. Later he worked for the Department of Council and Audit, assessing settlers' property holdings to calculate how much land to grant them, but this position became redundant as the flow of settlers fell to almost zero. Finally he took a position as a clerk in the Colonial Secretary's office for a very small wage, but eventually gave up his hopes of living in the Perth area and quit to head south. In 1834, Watson moved to the town of Mandurah, in order to participate in the extensive surveys scheduled for the Leschenault district. He was involved in several large surveys, including the original survey of the Bunbury town site, along with work in York and Mandurah itself. Evidence suggests that at least some of Watson's work was inferior in quality. Some of his surveys had to be re-done by others, and his Bunbury plans were discarded. In October 1835 he took a group of people intending to settle new land to the Murray River, near Thomas Peel's land. From there he continued on and completed a partial survey of the Murray River east to the Serpentine River and Pinjarra, recording the type of land, bush, flora and fauna he encountered along the way. The late 1830s saw Watson paid for two surveys; one unspecified in connection with roads and bridges to the southern districts, and one for a road from Fremantle to the Dandalup ford. It was stated that the roads that Watson and others had surveyed in these districts were \\"perfectly impassable for 7 or 8 months of the year\\" due to flooding . Watson is credited as having recorded the Aboriginal word \\"Kougee\\" in 1841, which became the word Coogee and refers to a lake and settlement area in Cockburn. Similarly he is credited as recording the name Banganup Lake in the Cockburn area during his 1841 surveys. He is also credited as naming The Spectacles in modern-day Kwinana in the same year. The maps of these surveys are held in the State Records Office of WA.  Mail carrier  Watson became the first mail contractor for the Murray District in 1841, receiving ¬£80 for the year to travel between Pinjarra and Bunbury. He surveyed the Pinjarra- Fremantle Road in the same year. He lost the tender in 1842, and focused on working the ferry crossing and running a hotel at Mandurah. In 1847 Watson's tender to carry mail between several south-west settlements was accepted by George Fletcher Moore, the Colonial Secretary. He was to carry mail once a month \\"from Fremantle to Albany via Mandurah, Australind, Bunbury, Busselton, and Kojonup; also a branch mail between Mandurah and Pinjarrah\\". Until this time, it had been assumed that the journey between Fremantle and Albany took two weeks. Watson discovered a new route and managed the journey in five days. He guarded the specifics of his new route for fear that the government would undercut him and he would lose his contract. Later that year his diary of one of these journeys was published in the colonial newspaper, describing the hardships of bushland, weather, and poor roads encountered along the way. He also took passengers on this route, and advertised his prices for parcels and transport between the towns he visited. A return trip between Fremantle and Mandurah cost 15 shillings, and a return trip between Fremantle to Albany cost ¬£8. Parcels under 1lb cost 1/6 to send to Albany, parcels over 1lb cost 4 shillings. During his time as mail carrier he continued to survey roads and build bridges, using soldiers stationed at Albany and Kojonup to carry out the work. In 1848 his report on the improvements of roads outside Albany was published in the newspaper. He was generally held to have performed his role well and was highly regarded at the end of his contract in 1849.

The common belief is that the foundation of this village was laid by Gopal Chauhan - 6th generation of Lav Dev. Some argue that Lav Dev was not Prithvi Raj Chauhan's but Krishna Chauhan's son who was a General in Prithvi Raj Chauhan's army and fell martyr in the second battle against Muhammad of Ghor commonly known in the history as Shahabuddin Muhammad Ghori or Muhammad Gauri. History A historic ‚ÄòShiv Dawala‚Äô and many old houses of small brick can roughly put the origin of this village back to as early as 16th century. It is quite probable that the ancestors of this village could be Ghorewaha Rajputs. Elders of this village also talk of ‚ÄòBundi‚Äô links which make them Hara (Hadha) Chauhan's. Whatever may be the case Sarhal Mundi is one of the very few Rajput villages of Doaba besides Karnana and Sahlon which H. A. Rose's book lists as Rajput. The practice of census data recording cast ceased in 1947 when India gained independence. Demographics This village is a nice mix of Sikh and Hindu Rajput families and many of its old inhabitants migrated to UK & USA. Late Thakur Des Raj Singh ji was the first person from this village to gain a prosecuting police officer's commission under the British and later retired as Prosecuting Deputy Superintendent of Police. He also won President's Gold Medal for his meritorious services. Thakur Kanwar Tek. C. Chauhan of this village was the first person to be selected as an I.A.S Officer. Another famous son of this village was Wing Commander Late Thakur Kuldip Chauhan. Besides the small temple adjoining it is the shrine of a NATH SIDDHA cult saint Bawa Utam Das who is credited with various miracles. Besides the names mentioned are the names of Mr Banta Singh who deserted the army and joined Indian National Army of Netaji Subash Chander Bose and Mr Ajit Singh of British army. Another person of note is Kanwar Gandharv Raj Chauhan Chief Executive Engineer, Civil Aviation, Saudi Arabia who established a medical centre in village‚Üí Source. Village Tehsil Records Overview Just like most villages of this area Sarhal Mundi may be much older in historic terms than most of us think it is as the word ‚ÄòMundi is found in ancient ‚ÄòTakka‚Äô language. Old excavations of ‚ÄòHarrapa‚Äô found around these villages of Phillaur also suggest that these areas have always been the hub of civilizations just the old has been replaced by the new. Some historians believe that from time to time Rajputs of these villages found new lands rather than submitting to invaders who ruled Northern India from time to time. Genealogical and physical attributes such as tall stature, good martial skills, fair colour as compared to others, stubborn nature, sense of adventure and travel and a belly full of fire makes Doaba Bist inhabitants of these villages more akin to Rajput ancestry. Sardar Gurdial Singh as quoted by H. A. Rose believes them to be of \\"good Rajput blood\\". Although some historians tend to follow the thinking that Rajputs are descendants of Huns but the controversial view that Rajputs are linked to Indus Aryans holds equally powerful logic as proposed by H.S.Olcot in his 'Aryan Origins' theory, general sharp Grecian/Mediterranean/Caucasian features hint at an Aryan/Scythic descent. No matter what the argument it has to be admitted that North India was the melting pot out of which Rajputs kept their traditions alive. Present day Sarhal Mundi is only a shadow of its old self with many houses under lock and key and disrepair as inhabitants live abroad. The total adult population of voting age is just 1152 (M 569 F583). There is a Government Elementary School, girls school and medical centre. There also are the ruins of a small fort of Sikh era. There is general belief of connection with State of Bundi, Rajasthan during reign of Maharao Raja Sir Singh Bhadur. Plans exist for a hospital now. The Shrine of Baba Uttam Das and the pond are still there reviving the old nostalgia. Baba Uttam Das was a 'sadhu' (a sage, a holy man) who long time ago happen to come to this village and settled by the old village pond. According to folklore, one evening, he went door to door asking for mustard oil with which he could light the 'diya' (lamp made of clay) for his evening prayer to Hindu deities but no one in the village gave him any oil. In his anger he said that from now on wards no mustard oil mill will work in this village. To date there has never been a 'Kohlu'(mustard mill) in this village from that day. This village is easily accessible by going to Phagwara and travelling approximately 8 miles by the side of a canal, the route used by many buses and cars.

It stars Jesse Eisenberg, Justin Bartha, Ari Graynor, Danny A. Abeckaser and Q-Tip. The film is inspired by a true story of a young Hasidic man who was lured into the world of international drug trafficking in the late 90s. Plot In 1998, Sam Gold (Jesse Eisenberg), is a mild-mannered 20-year-old Orthodox Jewish man who lives with his large family in the Borough Park section of Brooklyn. Sam works in his father Mendel's fabric store while studying to be a rabbi. He and his family hope to arrange a marriage for him with Zeldy Lazar (Stella Keitel). However, Sam's family is much poorer than the Lazars, and he worries he will be unable to provide for them. Sam and his best friend Leon (Jason Fuchs) accept a mysterious job offer from Leon's brother Yosef (Justin Bartha) and his boss, the Israeli Jackie (Danny Abeckaser). Under the auspices of visiting a rabbi in Atlantic City, Yosef sends them to Amsterdam, with instructions to wait for him. While there, the pair are given a briefcase, which Yosef says contains medicine, and are instructed to walk it through customs in New York. Back in New York, after a comment from Maxim, Yosef's muscle, the pair discover the briefcase contains pure ecstasy. Leon wants nothing more to do with Yosef or his operation, but Sam is attracted to the easy money and decides to continue. Sam becomes a participant in Jackie's operation, making trips to Amsterdam to pick up suitcases. He is paid to recruit other young Orthodox Jews as mules, who implicitly trust him as one of their own. Sam meets the liberal Jewish girl Rachel (Ari Graynor), Jackie's girlfriend, and drinks alcohol and takes ecstasy with the gang. When Sam brokers a business deal with European drug manufacturer Ephraim (Q-Tip) that Jackie almost abandoned, his influence in the organisation grows, as does his relationships with Yosef and Rachel, who both take interest in him. Meanwhile, Sam slowly leaves the yeshiva. His new job, which he originally covered up as legal importing of medicine, is well- known around his neighborhood, and his parents, fearing their family's reputation in the community, kick him out of the house. Sam discovers Yosef has been skimming money from Jackie through side deals, which Sam, fearing the repercussions, objects to. After escaping a failed deal, Sam goes to meet Jackie, who promptly leaves for a meeting at a nightclub. While alone, Rachel attempts to seduce Sam and encourage him to run away with her, but fails to do so. Jackie, in a meeting with Ephraim and Sam, wants to ship street ecstasy, which contains a higher percentage of other drugs, into America. When Sam voices his objections, Jackie rebuffs him, leading him to have an argument with Rachel. Sam attempts to convince Rachel to escape to Lithuania, but Rachel, having changed her mind about Sam, refuses. Sam then decides to continue with the operation despite the added risk; these drugs, carried by unwitting young Orthodox Jews, are picked up by drug-sniffing dogs and the mules are arrested. Sam, who no longer dresses like an Orthodox Jew, is not checked at customs with the mules and manages to escape. He goes to warn Yosef, who is high at a nightclub. Yosef suggests they drive to the West Coast to lay low with his cousin. Sam, not willing to go with Yosef's plan, returns to his childhood home in a panic. He is greeted there by Leon, now married to Zeldy and studying to become a rabbi as Sam was once intended to. Sam, realising that he will be arrested, weeps on his front steps as the sirens in the distance grow closer, until a police car pulls up. In the epilogue, it is revealed that Sam and his Orthodox mules received 28 months in a federal boot camp, where they became informants of Jackie and Yosef's operation. Over six months between 1998 and 1999, the operation managed to smuggle over one million ecstasy pills to America, via Sam and the other mules. Jackie and Yosef receive 16 years in prison on drug conspiracy charges, while Rachel also receives a year for participation. Sam and Mendel are then seen walking and talking during a visitation, implying that Sam has reunited with his family.

Formed in Australia in 1916, the battalion fought on the Western Front before being disbanded in 1919. It was later re-raised as a part-time infantry battalion in the Illawarra region of New South Wales during the inter-war years. During World War II, the 34th was amalgamated with the 20th Battalion and undertook defensive duties in Australia before being disbanded in 1944. Post war, the 34th was re-formed in the early 1950s before being subsumed into the Royal New South Wales Regiment in 1960. History=World War I The battalion was formed in January 1916 during an expansion of the AIF that took place after the Gallipoli campaign. Assigned to the 9th Brigade of the Australian 3rd Division, the majority of the battalion's personnel were volunteers that came from Maitland, New South Wales ‚Äì many of whom had been coal miners ‚Äì and as a result the unit became known as \\"Maitland's Own\\". Its initial recruits, though, came from north-west New South Wales, having marched from Walgett. After initial training, the 34th Battalion, with an authorised strength of 1,023 men, embarked in Sydney and sailed to Europe where the 3rd Division concentrated in the United Kingdom to undertake further training prior to joining the other four divisions of the AIF that had been transferred from Egypt in mid-1916. After five months of training on Salisbury Plain, the battalion arrived in France in November 1916, as the 3rd Division was transferred to the front over the course of several months. The division's move was not complete until February 1917, but the battalion was moved up to the front line soon after its arrival, taking up a position on 27 November 1916. Over Christmas, the Australians endured the worst winter Europe experienced in 40 years, and for the next two years the 34th Battalion served on the Western Front until the end of the war. Nevertheless, the battalion's first major action did not come until mid-1917 when the British shifted their focus towards the Ypres sector in Belgium and the 3rd Division was committed to the Battle of Messines as part of II Anzac Corps on 7 June. The 34th Battalion, along with the rest of the 9th Brigade, was tasked with leading the division's assault. Beginning their approach march late on 6 June, they were caught in a German gas bombardment that inflicted heavy casualties; nevertheless, they arrived at the line of departure on time and, after a number of mines were exploded in front of their positions, the assault began. The exploding mines destroyed a large part of the German line and as a result initial resistance was quickly overcome. By 5 am on 7 June, the division had gained the crest of the Messines Ridge and dug-in to defend against a possible counter-attack, with the 34th occupying a position around Grey Farm. Following Messines, the 34th was rotated between manning the front line and conducting training in rear areas, before joining the Battle of Passchendaele on 12 October. Despite beginning promisingly for the Allies, by the time the 34th arrived heavy rain had turned the battlefield into a muddy quagmire that hindered their advance and ultimately resulted in heavy casualties and limited gains; for the 34th the losses were particularly heavy, representing 50 per cent of its strength. Following Passchendaele, a reduced tempo period followed as the battalion was reformed throughout the remainder of 1917. In between resting, training and rotating through the front line, the 34th was used as labour in the rear areas as it was built back up to strength. In early 1918, after the collapse of the Russian Empire and the signing of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk allowed the Germans to concentrate their forces in the west, the Germans launched a major offensive on the Western Front. Striking significant blows against the British southern flank, the Germans pushed the Allies back towards the vital Amiens railhead. As the situation became desperate for the Allies, the 9th Brigade was thrown into the line around Villers-Bretonneux to stop the Germans from splitting the British Fifth Army and the French First Army to their south. The 34th Battalion subsequently took part in heavy fighting when the Australians counter-attacked at Hangard Wood on 30 March, before finally turning back the German attack on Villers-Bretonneux on 4 April. A peaceful penetration action was fought around Morlancourt by the 9th Brigade in early May 1918. Clarence Jeffries, the 34th Battalion's sole Victoria Cross recipient After blunting the German offensive, in August the Allies launched the Hundred Days Offensive, which ultimately ended the war, around Amiens. After joining the attack on 8 August, the 34th participated in the series of advances that followed. Its final action came around the St Quentin Canal in late September. The involvement of the Australian Corps in the earlier actions in 1918 had significantly depleted its battalions which had suffered heavy casualties that they had been unable to replace as the number of volunteers arriving from Australia had fallen. As a result, upon Australian Prime Minister Billy Hughes' request, it was subsequently withdrawn from the line for reorganisation and rest in October. It remained out of the line until the armistice came into effect in November. With the end of hostilities, the Australian units began to demobilise and their personnel were slowly repatriated back to Australia. As its numbers dwindled, the 34th Battalion was disbanded in May 1919. During the war, 481 men from the battalion were killed and 1,727 were wounded or gassed. Members of the 34th received the following decorations: one Victoria Cross, three Distinguished Service Orders, one Officer of the Order of the British Empire, two Members of the Order of the British Empire, 10 Distinguished Conduct Medals, 21 Military Crosses (including one Bar), 77 Military Medals (including three Bars), five Meritorious Service Medals, 31 Mentions in Despatches and seven \\"foreign\\" awards. Captain Clarence Jeffries was the battalion's sole VC recipient, receiving the award for actions during the First Battle of Passchendaele in 1917. A total of 14 battle honours were awarded to the battalion for the war. Inter-war years and subsequent service In 1921, during a re-organisation of Australia's part-time military forces ‚Äì the Citizen Forces ‚Äì designed to perpetuate the units of the AIF, the battalion was re-raised as an infantry battalion in New South Wales. In doing so, the battalion drew personnel from the 2nd Battalion, 34th Infantry Regiment, which drew its lineage from the 37th Infantry Regiment. In 1927, when territorial designations were introduced, the battalion adopted the title of the \\"Illawarra Regiment\\" and the motto Malo Mori Quam Foedari. In 1936, the battalion formed an alliance with The Border Regiment. Initially, a mixture of voluntary and compulsory service was used to maintain the strength of the Citizen Forces units; however, in 1930, the newly elected Scullin Labor government abolished the Universal Training Scheme, replacing it with a volunteer-only Militia. During World War II, due to the provisions of the Defence Act, which precluded Militia units from being sent outside Australian territory to fight, the battalion remained in Australia where it undertook defensive duties variously assigned to the 14th and 28th Brigades. Around November 1942, the battalion's machine gun company was detached and in conjunction with several other Militia machine gun companies, it was used to form the 6th Machine Gun Battalion. On 2 December 1943, the battalion was amalgamated with the 20th Battalion to form the 20th/34th Battalion; this unit was itself disbanded on 6 April 1944 without having been deployed overseas. After the war, Australia's part-time military force was re-organised in 1948 under the guise of the Citizen Military Force (CMF); however, the 34th Battalion was not re-raised until 29 October 1951. In 1953, the battalion adopted the regimental march Blaze Away and formed an alliance with the King's Own Scottish Borderers. On 8 March 1959, the battalion was granted the Freedom of the City of Wollongong, but the following year it ceased to exist when the Pentropic divisional establishment was adopted by the Australian Army, the infantry units of the CMF were re- organised into state-based regiments with former battalion-level organisations becoming company-level formations of Pentropic battalions. At this time, the 34th Battalion became part of the 3rd Battalion, Royal New South Wales Regiment, forming that unit's 'B' Company. Alliances The 34th Battalion held the following alliances: * United Kingdom ‚Äì The Border Regiment: 1936‚Äì51; * United Kingdom ‚Äì The Kings Own Scottish Borderers: 1953‚Äì59; * United Kingdom ‚Äì The Border Regiment: 1955‚Äì59 * United Kingdom ‚Äì The Kings Own Royal Border Regiment: 1959‚Äì60. Battle honours The 34th Battalion received the following battle honours: * World War I: Messines 1917, Ypres 1917, Polygon Wood, Broodseinde, Poelcappelle, Passchendaele, Somme 1918, Ancre 1918, Amiens, Albert 1918, Mont St Quentin, Hindenburg Line, St Quentin Canal, France and Flanders 1916‚Äì18.

Sunifiram is a molecular simplification of unifiram (DM-232). Another analogue is sapunifiram (MN-19). As of 2016, sunifiram had not been subjected to toxicology testing, nor to any human clinical trials, and is not approved for use anywhere in the world. Pharmacology The mechanism of action of sunifiram is unknown. Sunifiram, as well as unifiram, were assayed at a wide panel of sites, including the most important receptors, ion channels, and transporters, but showed no affinity for any of the sites. They specifically did not bind to the glutamate, GABA, serotonin, dopamine, adrenergic, histamine, acetylcholine, or opioid receptors at concentrations of up to 1 ŒºM. In addition, the drugs were tested on recombinant AMPA receptors and showed no potentiation of the receptors, indicating that they do not act as AMPA receptor positive allosteric modulators. However, they were able to prevent the amnesia induced by the AMPA receptor antagonist NBQX in the passive avoidance test, suggesting that indirect/downstream AMPA receptor activation may be involved in their memory-enhancing effects. It is reported that sunifiram stimulates CaMKII and PKCŒ± pathways, and that this action depends on the activation of glycine site of NMDA receptors. Sunifiram, as well as other nootropics such as piracetam, levetiracetam, and aniracetam are able to antagonize inhibition of glucose transport by barbiturates (e.g., pentobarbital), diazepam, and certain other drugs in human erythrocytes in vitro (Ki = 26.0 uM for sunifiram), and this action has been found to correlate with their potency in reversing scopolamine-induced memory deficits in mice. However, this action has been regarded as very unlikely to represent the main mechanism of action of sunifiram.

After the fall of communism and German reunification she was arrested and charged with murder in relation to the kidnapping and murder of Hanns-Martin Schleyer and his driver and police escort, and of murder attempt on Haig; she was found guilty on 22 June 1992 and sentenced to eight-and-a-half years' imprisonment. During her trial she cooperated with the police and prosecution and therefore received a reduced sentence. Following her release from prison on probation in 1997, she has worked as a photographer.

As a prolific road building pioneer, Bain was responsible for the planning and construction of more than 900 km of roads and mountain passes, many of them still in use today, over a career spanning from 1848 until 1888. These passes through the mountain ranges between the thin coastal plain and the interior of the former Cape Colony in South Africa, played a major role in opening up the vast hinterland of South Africa. Biography Bain was born in 1830 at Graaff Reinet, at that stage a frontier town in the Cape Colony in Southern Africa. His father, Andrew Geddes Bain, was born in Scotland and settled in the Cape Colony in 1816 at the age of 19. Bain and his six brothers and six sisters were educated largely at home like most settlers' children of that period. The children's education was interrupted by the outbreak of the War of the Axe in 1846, one of several frontier wars that raged during that era. Thomas served as a volunteer in the war and helped to guard women and children who sheltered in the church of the frontier town of Fort Beaufort. He married Johanna Hermina de Smidt in 1854. They had 13 children and enjoyed a long and happy marriage. Johanna was the ninth child of Willem de Smidt, the Secretary of the Central Road Board. Georgina Bain (16 November 1860 Knysna ‚Äì 6 December 1954), one of his daughters, married the Conservator of Forests, Joseph Storr Lister (1 October 1852 Cape Town ‚Äì 27 February 1927, and wrote Reminiscences of Georgina Lister. Career In order to cross the coastal mountain ranges of the former Cape Colony, Charles Michell (Surveyor-General, Civil Engineer and Superintendent of Works) and John Montagu (British Colonial Secretary for the Cape Colony) introduced an ambitious road building program. Their goal was achieved by the father-and-son combination of Andrew and Thomas Bain, whose civil engineering prowess effected a quantum leap in the quality and range of the road network of the 19th-century Cape Colony. Thomas served his apprenticeship from 1848 to 1854 as his father's assistant in the capacity of Assistant Inspector of Roads. In this capacity he was involved in the construction of Michell's Pass near Ceres and Bainskloof pass near Wellington. After passing first in the Government examinations in 1854, he was promoted to Roads Inspector for the Western Province. Thomas and his father's careers as road builders continued to be intertwined until Andrew's death in 1864. Bain built 24 major mountain roads and passes in the second half of the 1800s. His father built eight during the first half of the same century. One of the few passes in South Africa not built by a Bain during that period was Montagu Pass from George to Oudtshoorn, which was built in 1843‚Äì47 by Henry Fancourt White, a road engineer from Australia. Bain's first road construction project as newly promoted Roads Inspector was Grey's Pass (renamed Piekenierskloof pass after it was reconstructed in 1958), completed in 1858, that opened up the Olifantsriver valley to the Swartland and the Cape Town market. One of Bain's major achievements was the construction of the road on the coastal plain between George and the forestry town of Knysna. The project was started in 1867 and took 15 years to complete. This road linked Knysna to the more developed areas towards Cape Town and replaced the dreaded river crossing at Kaaimansgat which early travelers described with trepidation. This project was followed by a series of passes across the Langeberg and Outeniqua mountain ranges. These passes include the Robinson, Tradouw, Garcia and Burgers Passes as well as the Kogmanskloof road. Then followed the 185 km Tsitsikama road, linking the western and eastern portions of the Cape Colony through the indigenous forests of the coastal plain. This road involved the crossing of major ravines, including the Grootriver, Bobbejaansriver, Bloukransriver and Stormsriver gorges. In March 1873 Bain was appointed as district engineer in the Railway Department. Due to a lack of a suitable candidate to fill the position in the Road Department that he vacated, he rejoined the Road Department after 18 months. In 1877 he became an Associate of the Institution of Civil Engineers. Bain's crowning achievement was the Swartberg Pass that connects Oudtshoorn, the largest town in the Little Karoo, with Prince Albert beyond the Swartberg mountains in the open plains of the Great Karoo. Construction on the scenic 24 km long Swartberg pass started in 1884 and was completed in 1887. Bain was assisted by another road engineer, John Tassie, who built the last 6 km of the road leading out of the mountain pass into Prince Albert. At the same time, Bain was also in charge of the construction of the Schoemanspoort pass that connects the Swartberg pass with Oudtshoorn. Bain's last road building project was the construction of Victoria road in 1887 that connects Cape Town with Camps Bay across the neck between Table Mountain and Signal Hill. In 1888 Bain resigned from the Road Department and accepted the position of Irrigation and Geological Surveyor of the (Cape) Colony. His prolific career with the Road Department resulted in a remarkable heritage of some of the most scenic and impressive mountain passes in South Africa. He continued his prolific work tempo in his new capacity until his death. During his tenure he designed and completed a large reservoir, the Verkeerdevlei reservoir, amongst other projects.

They specifically did not bind to the glutamate, GABA, serotonin, dopamine, adrenergic, histamine, acetylcholine, or opioid receptors at concentrations of up to 1 ŒºM. In addition, the drugs were tested on recombinant AMPA receptors and showed no potentiation of the receptors, indicating that they do not act as AMPA receptor positive allosteric modulators. However, they were able to prevent the amnesia induced by the AMPA receptor antagonist NBQX in the passive avoidance test, suggesting that indirect/downstream AMPA receptor activation may be involved in their memory-enhancing effects.

Main actors are Luciano Castro, Julieta D√≠az and Arnaldo Andr√©, and it is one of the most successful TV programs from Argentina of 2009.Valientes, con un rating cada vez m√°s alto \\"Valientes\\", c√≥modo en la punta With a daily rating of nearly 27,4 points, it is the most successful production of Pol-Ka. It run from February 2009 to 2010. From April 16, 2010 the show was airing in Slovakia on JOJ Plus but due to poor ratings it was cancelled after 48 episodes, the rest of the episodes start broadcast on JOJ Plus from March 6, 2012 taking the slot at 4 AM.  Premise  The main idea of the telenovela is a plot of revenge by 3 brothers who used to live in the countryside, whose father was ruined by a businessman who took his farms. For this purpose they move to Buenos Aires and work near him, in order to become his friends and confidants, and avenge his father by sabotaging his political career. The love stories of the show torn the characters between their sentiments and their loyalty to the plan. The series replaced Por amor a vos on Channel 13 and was aired in the same time segment than the soap-opera Los exitosos Pells of Telefe. The idea was to confront the humoristic style of the later with a melodramatic telenovela.Una venganza para tres The dramatic tone of the series allowed a strong success among the male audiences, a rare event among Argentine telenovelas, which led to the high success of the program in audiences. The success of the series led to a spin- off theater play by the main actors, reprising the characters from the TV but inside a humoristic story. The ending of the series was followed by a \\"behind the scenes\\" production and a rerun of the last episodes. It was replaced by the soap opera Alguien que me quiera, of a less dramatic nature, but it didn't have much success. As a result, and attempting to keep the audience of Valientes, Alguien que me quiera was scheduled to another hour, and another series was created, Malparida. Heredia also works in this one, and it is also a story of revenge. Luciano Castro would also join Malparida some time afterwards. Plot The story is started by events set in the past, when the landlord Laureano Gomez Acu√±a tricks Roque Sosa, his employee in his farm, into giving him the lands he intended to inherit to his sons. Her wife Elisa Sosa is blackmailed to leave the country, and the 3 sons of Roque are sent to different locations. Roque Sosa dies shortly after. The main character of the story is Leonardo Sosa, one of the lost sons of Roque Sosa, who discovers the truth in his adulthood and intends to get revenge on Laureano. For this he locates his two brothers, Segundo and Enzo. Segundo was living at another farm and held under harsh conditions by his tutor, while Enzo was a criminal held in prison. Both of them are freed from those places by Leo, who designs new identities for themselves as Leonardo, Segundo and Enzo Morales. Then they install a car repair shop next to Laureano's home, with the intention of becoming known and confident with him, and then be capable to disrupt his business and political career. Leonardo soon discovers that Alma was his old girlfriend from childhood, but can't tell her his identity because she's confident with Laureano. He later finds out that Juana, daughter of Laureano, had fallen in love with him, and stays with her for getting more confident with Laureano. However, Juana was extremely jealous of Alma and keep attacking her and making complains to Leo. To avoid the risk of him leaving her, she lies about being pregnant. Juana and Leo get married soon afterwards. The Sosa took advantage of the new filial relation of Leo and Laureano to keep disrupting his activities, while Laureano ignored who was opposing him. Married with Juana but still loving Alma, Leo contacts her by internet as Leonardo Sosa and chats with her, while pretending to be at another country. When Alma requested to see him with a webcam, he requested Nicol√°s Ortega, an old friend from the Police, to chat with her posing as Leonardo Sosa, but it turned out against him when Ortega actually falls in love with Alma. However, when Laureano learns that Alma was dating Leonardo Sosa (ignoring as her the deception being done), he kidnaps and tortures him to death. When the kidnapping took place Nicolas's wallet was left behind, and with it Alma learns that he wasn't really Leonardo Sosa. Incapable of maintaining the lie of being pregnant, Juana sets up a situation to blame Alma of making her lost her pregnancy, but when Leo discovers the whole lie he lefts Juana, regardless of the plan. Alma was with Patricio by then, a new character added to the story, but reunites with Leo. By the time Alma learns about Leonardo and Ortega being friends, Leo tells her the whole truth, including his real identity and the plan to harm Laureano. In the meantime, Juana was hospitalized and later gets amnesia during an accident. She recovers her memory a while afterwards, but did not said so because of being better treated by others when they thought she did not remember past crimes. Two new characters are added to the story. Andy, a step-sister of Leo, joins the car repair shop, and Leo makes her a part of the plan immediately. Elisa Sosa, mother of Sosa brothers, is revealed to have faked her death, and while staying hidden from Laureano she was searching for her sons. She took part in a painting contest with her son, Enzo, but neither of them realized their relation because of using pseudonyms.

William Scoresby Routledge, FRGS (1859‚Äì1939) was a British ethnographer, anthropologist and adventurer. With his wife, Katherine Routledge, he completed the first ethnographies of the Kikuyu (East Africa) and the people of Rapa Nui (Easter Island). Early life William was first child of William Routledge and Anne Sophia Twycross, who met and married in Melbourne, Australia. He was named after the British arctic explorer and whaler Dr. William Scoresby, a family friend. Scoresby spent his early years at \\"Vaucluse\\" in Richmond, Victoria, before returning to England in about 1867 with his parents and three younger sisters following the death of his father‚Äôs brother and business partner. His family then lived at \\"Yarra-Yarra\\", at 3 Upperton Road, Eastbourne, Sussex. William was the first cousin of British seismographer, John Milne(1850‚Äì1913) who worked in Japan during the Meiji Restoration. His paternal family had roots in Nova Scotia where his great grandfather, Mr Justice Thomas Chandler Haliburton, was an MP, and author of an important history of the area: \\"Historical and Statistical Account of Nova-Scotia.\\" The two volumes were published by Howe in 1830.Haliburton (1830). Historical and Statistical Account of Nova-Scotia, 2 volumes, Howe. Education Following graduation in 1882 with a Masters from Christ Church, Oxford University, Routledge studied medicine at University College Hospital, London. In 1883 he won the Physiology prize. He was also elected to the Royal Geographical Society, and in 1888 received the Erichsen prize for practical surgery. He did not complete his medical degree. In later years he was elected to other clubs, namely the Royal Cruising Society of Antiquaries, the Geological Society, the Royal Anthropological Institute and as Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society (1900). The latter holds a collection of eight boxes of mostly unpublished field notes, sketches, maps, and photographs by the Routledges. In 1906 Scoresby Routledge married a fellow Oxford graduate, Katherine Pease and an extraordinary, yet troubled collaboration took place that lasted for 20 years producing an irreplaceable body of scholarly work that has for the most part stood the test of time. As an ethnographer and anthropologist Scoresby Routledge spent his life visiting and documenting primitive cultures that were changing and disappearing in the early 20th century. The Routledges both did so with an urgency that indicated that they understood how quickly the history of these cultures would be lost forever as the stirrings of globalization started to take place when western ideas were introduced in formerly isolated areas (with access to remote areas of the earth by new roads or by sea routes being a major factor). The Mi'kmaq (Mic-macs) of Newfoundland As an anthropologist he worked initially amongst the Mi'kmaq (Mic-macs) of Newfoundland. It was noted in The Times in 1915 that Scoresby Routledge was living with the Mic-macs in Central Newfoundland where he learned hunting and woodcraft. Scoresby Routledge later described in the book he co wrote with his wife Katherine on the Kikuyu, of traveling for four months on a beaver hunting expedition with the Mic-Macs in densely forested country. The Kikuyu of East Africa In 1902 Scoresby Routledge visited the Kikuyu tribe of Kenya, in the former British East Africa. He set up a fixed base camp at Fort Hall which was then a remote area located sixty miles to the north east of Nairobi. The camp included a stone room for photographic work. Information regarding native customs was gathered as he rode about the country with members of the tribe and in the evening when everyone was welcome at the big fire in front of his tent. World Cat. With a prehistoric people, the Akikuyu of British East Africa, by W Scoresby Routledge and Katherine Pease. London : E. Arnold, 1910. He gathered 36 artifacts on this trip which he presented to the British museum. In 1906 on a trip to Naples to view the ruins of Pompeii, he met Oxford scholar, Katherine Pease and they married shortly thereafter. Katherine and Scoresby returned to Africa together for another two years and in 1910 jointly published a book entitled \\"With a prehistoric people, the Akikuyu of British East Africa.\\" Katherine also embraced the anthropological work with enthusiasm and sensitivity stating that the destiny of the Kikuyu would be determined by the British Parliament and hoped that readers of the book in Britain would overcome indifference towards their fellow-subjects of the British Empire. She spoke in the introduction to the book of the urgent need for an exact and full record of native customs. She also observed that the impressions of both a man and a woman of similar topics were of great advantage. The Routledges covered various aspects of the culture with chapters on social and political life (where Katherine focused on the position of women), dress, land and agriculture, flocks and herds, food and cookery and warfare. Arts and crafts such as methods of hut building, firemaking, music and potterymaking were also recorded. Religion and folklore sections in the book recorded the beliefs of the Kikuyu about how they came to be who they were. 136 photographs and illustrations made a permanent record of Kikuyu people and their customs. A few key members of the Kikuyu tribe were singled out as invaluable to their research. The Routledges collected Kikuyu artifacts including quivers, arrows and other weapons, pottery, tools and body ornaments which were eventually donated to the British Museum and the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford. Scoresby Routledge‚Äôs perspective on their work in East Africa in the preface concluded with an observation that the study of the Kikuyu could offer the British an understanding and living reality of their Saxon ancestors, whose burial mounds were then being studied in England. Easter Island (Rapa Nui) Following a suggestion from the British Museum, the Routledges set out on an extraordinary expedition, (1914‚Äì1915). In 1913 they built a custom made yacht, which they named Mana or \\"Great Spirit\\". It was a magnificent 90-foot Schooner which they then sailed from Falmouth, England, taking more than a year on a sea voyage that crossed halfway across the globe under sail. En route to the Pacific they passed through the Patagonia Passage in South America, collecting artifacts that are now held at the Pitt Rivers Museum. In 1914, they finally arrived on Easter Island. The voyage of the Mana which eventually covered 100,000 miles only under sail led to Scoresby Routledge being awarded the Challenge Cup of the Royal Cruising Club, which had not been awarded since 1876. At the time there was growing public interest in the giant statues of the island, the moai and so the British media followed their story. It was unknown in 1914 how the statues came to dominate the spare landscape of the isolated Pacific island which is west of Chile and a total area of 164 km (63 sq miles).Katherine Routledge (1919). The Mystery of Easter Island: The Story of an Expedition, from Internet Archive. The Times of 1915 carried a report that described the Routledges arriving in England from Easter Island after voyages aggregating 100,000 miles in the schooner-yacht Mana. The article mentioned that there were 23 persons on board the yacht during its voyage. Katherine wrote a book describing the trip, \\"The Mystery of Easter Island: The Story of an Expedition\\" which went into a second publishing. She intended to write a more academic work in later years which never came about. Scoresby and Katherine were the first qualified scholars to carry out an archeological survey of the island. Much of their research has stood the test of time. Once again, the Routledges' timely visit to Easter Island preserved cultural and historic information that would otherwise have been lost. The material evidence of their expedition can be seen in the form of artifacts, papers, and photographic images. Polynesia Katherine and Scoresby later traveled to Mangareva and East Polynesia in 1921-1923 but the work they did was never published as their relationship became strained. They had hoped to determine the origin of the Rapa Nui before missionaries arrived there and the information, legends and traditions were lost. An example of their work there is reflected in the vocabulary cards held by the Royal Geographical Society and the large model of an outrigger canoe from Mangareva that is on display on the first floor of the Pitt Rivers Museum. Jamaica In 1920 Scoresby went on an expedition to cross the John Crow Mountains in Jamaica, as indicated by unpublished correspondence held by the Royal Geographical Society. In a brief account he gave to The Times newspaper on his return he described the difficulties of the perpetually moist limestone terrain, with narrow rock passages and lush vegetation impeding progress to the extent that the average rate of travel was a quarter of a mile per day. He also felt that but for the coincidence of a rare drought improving conditions, he would not have secured the assistance of local people. The expedition concluded before the drought ended on 20 April. Routledge crossed the range from the Rio Grande side to the east, accompanied by a party of Maroons and a sportsman visiting Jamaica, a Dr. Campbell. The final years Scoresby and Katherine separated in Sydney, Australia, in 1923, although for several years they periodically lived together in both London and \\"The Ewers\\", their home in the countryside of Hampshire. They finally parted company in 1928 when Katherine‚Äôs encroaching mental illness led to her being institutionalised. This brought to a sad end an extremely productive collaboration that provided invaluable research and preservation of the anthropology and ethnography of Kenya and Easter Island. Scoresby's grave at Putney Vale Cemetery, London in 2014 Scoresby preserved as much of Katherine‚Äôs work as could be found by donating it to both the British Museum and the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford.Pitt Rivers Museum, Collector: William Scoresby Routledge, Collected or donated by 1925.Pitt Rivers Museum Scoresby spent his last days on the island of Cyprus, living in a villa at Tjiklos, Kyrenia. His papers were discovered by the daughter of a friend on the island and were also sent to join the large collection already held by the Royal Geographical Society.Royal Geographical Society images. ROUTLEDGE, William Scoresby (1859-1939) and ROUTLEDGE, Katherine Maria (1866-1835) Scoresby died in London where he is buried at Putney Vale Cemetery. The lettering on his gravestone reads: Wm. Scoresby Routledge Explorer, Anthropologist, Only Son of Wm. and Anne Sophia Routledge Died in London, 31 July 1939, Aged 80 years. There is an added inscription on his grave in Latin, 'Quo Modo Lucem Diemque Omnibus Hominibus Ita Omnes Terras Fortibus Viris Natura Aperuit'. This translates as 'Like light and day to all men, thus nature opens all lands to brave men'.Erik Skytte, Findagrave website: William Scoresby Routledge. Biographies In 2003 Jo Anne Van Tilburg, of UCLA, an American archaeologist, well known for her research on Rapa Nui, wrote the biography of Katherine Routledge Among Stone Giants: the Life of Katherine Routledge and Her Remarkable Expedition to Easter Island. Although the book was somewhat interpretive of Scoresby's character, it was based on fact, and a large amount of researchJo Anne van Tilburg (2003). Among Stone Giants: The Life of Katherine Routledge and Her Remarkable Expedition to Easter Island, New York: Scribner's. .] Soon after another book was released written by Yale graduate Jennifer Vanderbes. In a comprehensive travel article written for the New York Times, A Faraway Land Steeped in Mystery in late 2003, she does not mention the Routledges. However her book, Easter Island, A Novel, shows more than a passing similarity to the story of the Routledges and Easter Island.Paul Bahn, Book Review, British Archaeology Magazine, January 2004Jennifer Vanderbes (2003) Easter Island: A Novel , New York: Random House. \\"A Faraway Land Steeped in History\\", Jennifer Vanderbes Both books were intriguing and displayed the fascination that writers and readers feel when coming across this great adventure set in the days when hidden worlds were first opening up to travellers and scientists and the general fascination that people feel to this day for Easter Island and its mysteries.

Plot summary Ship of Destiny continues where The Mad Ship left off and reveals some of the secrets that were hinted at in the first book and second books. Bingtown lies smoldering, the strata of its citizens as embattled with one another as they are against the invading Chalcedeans. Ronica Vestrit, the matriarch of a once-proud Trader family, finds herself destitute and labeled a traitor. She is the last of her line in the fiercely independent port city, and with nothing to lose but her life, resolves to remove the blight from the Vestrit name. As battles rage and infighting eats away at the heart of Bingtown, Ronica desperately tries to bring Old and New Traders, Three Ships folk and the ex-slave Tattooed together to save their city and themselves from being apportioned out to the greedy outsiders intent on destroying and looting their livelihoods. While Ronica's headstrong younger daughter Althea sails on the mad liveship Paragon in hopes of retrieving the family liveship, Vivacia, from the would-be pirate king Kennit, the other Vestrits find themselves in equally untenable positions. Althea's sister Keffria, still grieving over the disappearance of her seafaring husband and their eldest son, now mourns the apparent death of her daughter Malta, last seen in the bowels of a huge underground city as a massive earthquake struck the strange and wonderful Rain Wilds. With the sudden emergence from the ruined subterranean city of a single legendary dragon, Malta's betrothed, the native Rain Wilder Reyn, dares hope that he might yet find his love alive. The haughty Tintaglia, an arrogant and magnificent creature, has only one goal, and only one use for the otherwise insignificant humans: to keep her kind from extinction. Malta is alive, but damaged ‚Äî a wound to her head is bearing for fruit a disfiguring scar. Her beauty suddenly taken from her, the difficult girl comes into her own as a young woman, finding within herself a burning desire to make the most of her life. Held captive with the petulant figurehead ruler of Jamaillia known as the Magnadon Satrap, she discovers that her worth to their captors is only as high as her erstwhile companion's. When they are taken from the treacherous Chalcedeans by a ship of Kennit's pirate fleet, Malta takes a desperate gambit to not only preserve her own life but to try to salvage her ruined family. Wintrow, forcibly bound to the Vivacia by his father, has grown to love her. He's also grown to respect the destiny of her new captain, the pirate Kennit, and to secretly love Kennit's woman Etta. He stands behind Kennit in his quest to become King of the Pirate Isles, but when Vivacia learns the secret of her origins, the ship flees to a secret part of herself and Wintrow finds himself suddenly shut out of the most important relationship of his life. As the destinies of the Vestrit family members converge asea, escorted by a roiling tangle of monstrous sea serpents, the secrets of the liveships and of their humans collide, leaving the fate of their future teetering precariously in the balance. Reception Reviews of Ship of Destiny have varied, but were generally positive. Many reviewers have praised Hobb‚Äôs writing skill with one stating in Ship of Destiny she \\"has woven her storylines and subplots into an extraordinarily vivid and complex tapestry.\\" However, some reviewers felt the book was excessively long, referring to it as a \\"doorstop\\".

Often asked if he won a gold medal Martin replies, \\"I didn't come first and I didn't come last but I got a real good look at the bloke who did!\\" As a publicity stunt Martin busked in the City of Melbourne to raise sporting funds to represent Australia. Within 10 days of street performing \\"the hat was full\\" and Martin was on his way to the World Championships. Little did he know that this was to lead to a new career. In 1987 he retired from competition and started working full-time in the contemporary comedy rooms of Melbourne and Sydney alongside his coaching role with the Victorian Institute of Sport. Since 1987, he worked as a comedian, master of ceremonies and motivational speaker expanding his work to develop quirky, unique stand up comedy based around things that spin. He performed cowboy style spinning rope routines, unicycle feats and amazing yoyo routines, using traditional yoyos, high tech yoyos and even the manipulation of a yoyo that was not attached to the string. During the 1990s and beyond, Martin spent years developing and building his own unique props including two of the largest spinning tops in the world. The largest spinning top was nearly one meter high, powered up to a speed of 2200 rpm using an electric drill, with over 60 small led globes installed in the top to emit a dazzling light display. A prolific inventor, Martin designed and built a gyroscope that self propels along a string set up to run safely through or over the audience. Based in Riddells Creek, Martin has created a private museum featuring the greatest number of unique and collectable yoyos and spinning tops in Australia.

Their remains were discovered in the Tongtianyan Cave (ÈÄöÂ§©Â≤©) in Liujiang, Guangxi, China. The remains were excavated in 1958. The remains consist of a well-preserved adult cranium, a right innominate (hip bone), complete sacrum, multiple vertebrae, and two femoral fragments. All remains are believed to belong to one individual. Very little is known about the specimen due to a lack of academic sources published within the United States. There seems to be a discrepancy in determining accurate dates of the specimen due to the unknown stratigraphic context in which the remains were found. The remains are dated to the Late Pleistocene, most likely to about 67,000 years ago. High rates of variability yielded by various dating techniques carried out by different researchers place the most widely accepted range of dates with 67,000 BP as a minimum, but does not rule out dates as old as 159,000 BP. Any date prior to 50,000 years ago is surprising, as it would seem to predate the \\"recent dispersal\\" scenario of coastal migration (\\"Out of Africa II\\"). The remains have been considered in the context of a possible early dispersal which left Africa before 100,000 years ago, but which was extinct (or \\"retracted back to Africa\\") before the arrival of the \\"recent dispersal\\" wave.  Morphology  From the National Museum of Natural History  Regional population variation in sexual dimorphism hypothesis  Most scholars have interpreted the cranium of the specimen as male, but have encountered difficulties reaching a consensus in the sex of the pelvis. It is argued by scholar, Karen Rosenburg argues that this difficulty is indicative of regional variation in the degree of sexual dimorphism consistent with modern populations. The degree of morphology variation consistent with modern populations suggest that the fossils may not be as old as previously thought.  Cranium (1567 cc)  The cranium of the Liujiang specimen is one of the most complete to be found in China. The cranium was found filled with a stone matrix. The matrix filling the brain was scanned using computed tomography (CT) and turned into a reconstructed 3D image of the brain. The shape of the brain shares many similarities with modern humans including a rounded shape, wide frontal lobes, and enlarged brain height. One major difference between the Liujiang specimen and modern Chinese populations was the enlarged occipital lobes found on the Liujiang specimen. The common features between the Liujiang specimen and modern humans along with the cranial capacity of the skull (1567 cc) places the specimen within the range of modern humans.

Created by Ken Sugimori, Mr. Mime first appeared in the video games Pok√©mon Red and Blue and subsequent sequels, later appearing in various merchandise, spinoff titles and animated and printed adaptations of the franchise. Mr. Mime is voiced by Y≈´ji Ueda in Japanese and in English, was originally voiced by Kayzie Rogers and currently by Michele Knotz. Known as the Barrier Pok√©mon, Mr. Mime are gifted with the art of miming at a young age and as they mature they gain the ability to psychically generate invisible objects such as walls and other barriers. In the anime, a Mr. Mime appears as early on as a house cleaner and helper to Delia, protagonist Ash Ketchum's mother, while others are shown as entertainers or cooks. In the Pok√©mon Adventures manga, its abilities are utilized to create training rooms and surround an entire city with a barrier to prevent access from the outside world. Mr. Mime was powerful enough to beat Dialga and Mewtwo. His move psychic blast which is exclusive to Mr. Mime is the most powerful psychic type move. Mr. Mime's appearance has been heavily criticized by sources such as 1UP.com due to its humanoid design, as well as for combining the worst- perceived aspects of mimes and clowns. However, the character's design has also been praised by other sources in comparison to more common series characters. Design and characteristics Mr. Mime was one of 151 different designs conceived by Game Freak's character development team and finalized by Ken Sugimori for the first generation of Pocket Monsters games Red and Green, which were localized outside Japan as Pok√©mon Red and Blue. It was originally called \\"Barriered\\" in Japanese, but when Nintendo decided to give the various Pok√©mon species \\"clever and descriptive names\\" related to their appearance or features when translating the game for western audiences as a means to make the characters more relatable to American children, it was renamed \\"Mr. Mime\\", based on its masculine appearance and behavior and the name has persisted despite the introduction of female members of the species in later games. Appearing as an anthropomorphic creature, it has a pink head with red cheeks and blue, frizzy hair, a round, white body with a red spot in the middle, light-pink arms and legs are connected to its body by red spheres, white, five-fingered hands and blue feet that curl upward at the tips. Their hands are depicted with four fingers and an opposable thumb, with larger fingertips and red dots on their underside. However, game representations of the character featured only three fingers on each hand until the release of Pok√©mon Ruby and Sapphire. Mr. Mime are gifted with the art of miming at a young age, but as they mature, they gain the ability to make invisible objects by emitting energy from their fingers and minutely vibrating their fingertips to harden the air around them and form a wall. Barriers generated this way can repel harsh attacks and its gestures and motions can convince watchers that something unseeable actually exists; once this is achieved, the perceived item will materialize. Mr. Mime are very prideful of their pantomime acts and will heavily slap anyone that interrupts them while miming. Mr. Mime has a pre- evolution, Mime Jr., which evolves when mimicking other Pok√©mon. Appearances=In video games In the video game series, Mr. Mime can be acquired from an in-game trade in Pok√©mon Red and Blue and Pok√©mon FireRed and LeafGreen. It appeared in several sequels, including Pok√©mon Gold and Silver, Pok√©mon Diamond and Pok√©mon HeartGold and SoulSilver. In Pok√©mon Diamond and Pearl, Mr. Mime gains a new pre-evolved form, Mime Jr., which evolves when leveled up while knowing the move Mimic. In Pok√©mon Sword and Shield, Mr. Mime received a Galar-regional form of the Psychic/Ice type, which has a region- exclusive evolution, Mr. Rime, that evolves through leveling up. Gym Leader Sabrina uses a female Mr. Mime in every game she appears in except Pok√©mon Yellow, in which she does not have a Mr. Mime. In Pok√©mon Diamond and Pearl, Elite Four Lucian owns a Mr. Mime. Outside of the main series, Mr. Mime has appeared in the Pok√©mon Mystery Dungeon, the Pok√©mon Ranger games and Pok√©Park Wii: Pikachu's Adventure. In Pok√©mon Stadium 2, Mr. Mime stars in its own minigame called \\"Barrier Ball\\". Pok√© Balls appear on the field and by using Mr. Mime's Barrier, send the Pok√© Balls to the other player's fields. Mr. Mime also appears in Pok√©mon Go, but is a regional Pok√©mon that is catchable in Europe only. In other media In the anime, a Mr. Mime lives with Delia Ketchum. It does housework for her in exchange for room and board. Ash dressed as a Mr. Mime to inspire a real Mr. Mime who worked for a circus. Delia knew about this, so when a wild Mr. Mime came to her door and wanted lunch, she thought it was Ash in costume and provided it with food. When the real Ash showed up, still in costume, she was quite puzzled, but wound up keeping Mimey as her live-in maid. It will only listen to Delia and if anyone else, even Ash, gives it orders or asks it to do something, it will normally ignore them. It is unknown if Delia has actually captured Mimey, as she is never shown with its Pok√© Ball. When Ash and his friends returned to Pallet Town following the Orange Islands saga, it was revealed that Brock and Mimey had become rather competitive regarding household tasks while the two of them were sharing the house with Delia. In the Pok√©mon Adventures manga, Mr. Mime was first seen under the control of Sabrina, generating a Light Screen to seal off the whole of Saffron City. The same Mr. Mime was seen again during the Gym Leader faceoff, using its miming powers to trap Bugsy and defeat his Heracross. Mr. Mime has also appeared under the ownership of Crystal and has the ability to create invisible walls and rooms, much like Sabrina's Mr. Mime. It creates a training room for Ruby and Sapphire and Emerald to teach their Pok√©mon the ultimate moves Blast Burn, Hydro Cannon and Frenzy Plant. A Mr. Mime appears in the film Pok√©mon Detective Pikachu, getting interrogated by the title character (voiced by Ryan Reynolds) and Tim Goodman (Justice Smith). Critical reception Since appearing in the Pok√©mon franchise, Mr. Mime has received generally mixed to negative reception. 1UP.com named Mr. Mime the \\"Lamest Pok√©mon\\" in the franchise, stating \\"Mr. Mime makes you shake your head and question what reality we actually inhabit. Surely proto-human-clown-mime Pok√©mon don't arise in any ordinary universe.\\" In an analysis of the article on 1UP FM, the hosts agreed with the statement, describing him as hideous and \\"kinda a Krusty the Clown...malformed...thing\\". Retronauts stated similar, calling it out specifically as a \\"creepy son of a bitch\\" and a Pok√©mon that should not be part of the series due to its blatantly human appearance, further describing it as \\"everything that's wrong with mimes and clowns\\". GamesRadar named it one of the most \\"fugly Pok√©mon\\" in the series, describing it as \\"just...creepy\\", citing specifically its humanoid shape and dangling arms. However, they also noted that while one of the more weird characters in the series, it was also one of the more popular. IGN editor \\"Pok√©mon of the Day Chick\\" has expressed her dislike of the character in multiple articles, describing it as an \\"abomination\\" and jokingly alluded that designers were on drugs when they created it. GamesRadar editor Carolyn Gudmundson listed \\"humanoid\\" as one of the most overused Pok√©mon designs, listing Mr. Mime and Jynx as two of \\"the most infamous\\" examples. However, other sources have instead praised the character's appearance. In the book Gaming Cultures and Place in Asia-Pacific, David Surman defended Mr. Mime's design, suggesting that Sugimori developed it‚Äîalong with Jynx‚Äîto draw upon the humor of heta-uma (a term meaning bad/nice). The book notes that the designs \\"oscillate between the poles of good and bad\\" and as a result offer diversity within the game and invite scrutiny from players. The Coventry Evening Telegraph also praised its design, stating the character was \\"more interesting\\" in comparison to more commonly seen Pok√©mon such as Squirtle. Mr. Mime's role in Detective Pikachu was also met with praise. In an interview with GameSpot, lead actor [of the film] Justice Smith revealed that the Mr. Mime interrogation scene was one of his favorites. Patricia Hernandez of Polygon stated that \\"Mr. Mime practically steals the show\\" and \\"ended up in one of the best scenes of the whole movie.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Mr. Mime on Bulbapedia * Mr. Mime on Pokemon.com Category:Fictional mimes Category:Pok√©mon species Category:Video game characters introduced in 1996 Category:Fictional psychics Category:Fictional fairies and sprites Category:Video game characters with ice or cold abilities ","title":"Mr. Mime"},{"id":"24501466","text":"South Roanoke is a neighborhood located in southeast Roanoke, Virginia, surrounded roughly by the Roanoke River to the north and Mill Mountain to the east, centered on Crystal Spring Avenue. It borders the neighborhoods of Southern Hills on the south, South Jefferson on the north, and Mill Mountain on the east and Franklin-Colonial on the west. History The area of present-day South Roanoke was originally settled by Daniel Evans in the vicinity of Crystal Springs in 1750. This area would change ownership between several families through the late 1800s when the remaining property under the ownership of the McClanahan family was sold to the Roanoke Gas & Water Company in 1889. The following year the Crystal Spring Land Company began to develop the community with factories, homes and other associated land uses. Although the community originally sought to incorporate as a city, the area was annexed into the city of Roanoke from Roanoke County in 1915.

The film, a documentary-drama, follows the life story of Charlotte von Mahlsdorf, an East German transgender woman who survived the Nazis; the repression of the Communists and helped start the German gay liberation movement.Kuzniar, The Queer German Cinema, p. 111 The film is based on Mahlsdorf's autobiography: Ich bin meine eigene Frau, published in 1992, published in English as I Am My Own Woman (1995) and I Am My Own Wife (2004).Kuzniar, The Queer German Cinema, p. 104 Plot The trans woman Charlotte von Mahlsdorf recounts incidents from her eventful life. Now elderly, she runs the Gr√ºnderzeit Museum, fulfilling her dream of living as a woman from the turn of the 20th century. Scenes of her life are dramatized. Two actors play the young and middle-aged Charlotte and she plays herself in old age. Life was difficult for Charlotte, growing up as Lothar Berfelde in Nazi Germany during World War II. An effeminate boy, Lothar enjoyed cleaning and dusting at the home of a benevolent great uncle; an early desire to live as a woman finally found an outlet on a vacation to Eastern Prussia in the household of \\"aunt\\" Luise, a transgender man, who allows the youth to try out female outfits and dress at home as a girl, and giving Lothar the book The Transvestite by Dr Magnus Hirschfeld to read. Luise also respects the youth's privacy when he finds him having sex in the barn with a farm boy. Back in Berlin, after the death of a great uncle, the young Lothar is found at the complete mercy of his brutal father. Trying to save his mother and himself from his father's punishments and threats, Lothar bludgeons his father to death, a crime for which he is psychiatrically evaluated and imprisoned. The defeat of Germany during the war and the Allied invasion sets the boy free. Wandering through the street of Berlin, he barely escapes being killed as a deserter by German soldiers. By 1946 Lothar has come to identify herself as a feminine being in a masculine body. She lives now full-time as a woman under the name Charlotte von Mahlsdorf, \\"Charlotte\\" or \\"Lottchen\\" being similar to Lothar, and Mahlsdorf referring to the section of Berlin where she lives. She moves into the destroyed Friedrishfelde castle and spends years and a lot of hard work trying to restore it. But eventually, she is expelled by the East German authorities. Working as a domestic in the household of Herbert von Zitzenau, an elderly equestrian officer, she is seduced by her employer and they start a sexual relationship. She explains that she preferred older lovers feeling protected by them the way women do. That affair lasted several years until Zitzenau's health declined and death. Even though life for gays is difficult under the communist regime of East Germany, they find their way around. Cruising a public restroom, Charlotte meets Joechen, a lover with whom she could be a real woman. Their relation with sadomasochistic role-playing last for 27 years until Joechen's death. For more than 30 years Charlotte manages to live her life as a woman in East Germany. She preserves the entire contents of East Berlin's first (and only for many years) gay bar, after the DDR government closed the bar, and moved to demolish the building. Its contents were transferred to the Gr√ºnderzeit Museum in Mahlsdorf run by Charlotte and a lesbian couple. In 1989 the elderly Charlotte, very much active, takes a role in the first East German gay film: Heiner Carow's Coming Out. Its premiere coincides with the fall of the Berlin Wall. But even in a unified Germany Charlotte has to face many problems. The German government takes the Gr√ºnderzeit Museum and its contents from Charlotte's hands and she and her gay friends are attacked by neo-Nazis during the first joint East‚ÄìWest gay and lesbian gathering. In 1992 her labor is recognized when she receives the Cross of the Order of Merit from the government for furthering the cause of sexual freedom. Cast Two actors play the young and middle-aged Charlotte, and she plays herself in the later years. * Charlotte von Mahlsdorf - Herself * Jens Taschner ‚Äì Lothar age 15-17 * Ichgola Androgyn - Charlotte age 20-40 * Robert Dietl - Herbert von Zitzenau NotesReferences * Kuzniar, Alice A, The Queer German Cinema, Stanford University Press, 2000, External links * Category:1992 films Category:German films Category:1992 LGBT-related films Category:German biographical films Category:German LGBT- related films Category:Teen LGBT-related films Category:Films about trans women Category:Films directed by Rosa von Praunheim Category:LGBT-related films based on actual events ","title":"I Am My Own Woman"},{"id":"24501475","text":"Jiao Juyin (; 11 December 1905 ‚Äì 28 February 1975) was a Chinese director, translator, and theater theorist.
