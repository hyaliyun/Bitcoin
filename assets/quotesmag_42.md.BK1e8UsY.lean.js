Members of the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association, the Commodores played six home games in Nashville, Tennessee and finished the season with a record of 5-3 and 2-1 in conference play. Schedule Season summary =Michigan= On October 25, 1913, Michigan played Vanderbilt in Nashville, Tennessee. The game matched Michigan head coach Fielding H. Yost against his former player and brother-in- law, Dan McGugin. Owing to the relationship between Yost and McGugin, the two teams played nine times between 1905 and 1923, with Michigan winning eight times. Michigan won the 1913 game, 33‚Äì2, in the worst defeat for Vanderbilt since McGugin became the head coach. The game was marked by the Wolverines' most extensive use of the forward pass during the 1913 season. Michigan's air attack was described as showing \\"dazzling proficiency\\", as the forward passes were responsible for four of Michigan's five touchdowns. In the Detroit Free Press, E. A. Batchelor wrote: \\"Vanderbilt fairly gasped in amazement as the Wolverines shot the ball from one to another with the precision of baseball players.\\" =Virginia= Virginia blanked the Commodores 34-0\\\\. =Tennessee= Red Rainey scored Tennessee's touchdown.

The first down after, Hord Boensch threw a touchdown pass to Enoch Brown. Brown ran the last ten yards shaking off several defenders. Boensch kicked goal and won the game for Vanderbilt.

Due to its cultural and historical significance, the documents were declared as a National Cultural Treasure by the National Archives of the Philippines Director Victorino Manalo during the Second Baybayin Conference at the Museum of the Filipino People, Manila on August 22, 2014. It was the first declaration made the Philippines' national archives and the first paper document declared as a National Cultural Treasure. It is the fifth declared National Cultural Treasure for the University of Santo Tomas (UST) after the declarations on UST Main building, UST Central Seminary building, Arch of the Centuries and UST Open Ground.  Baybayin  Baybayin is an ancient Tagalog alphabet used in the Philippines even before the arrivals of the Muslims and Spanish colonizers. It has three vowels and fourteen consonants. As an alpha syllabic script, its character can either stand as a single consonant or vowel, or an entire syllable. It is still currently used by Palaw'an and Tagbanua ethnic groups of Palawan and the Hanunuo and Buhid Mangyan of Mindoro.  Description  The UST baybayin documents cover two legal real estate transactions in 1613 (labelled as Document A dated February 15, 1613) and 1625 (labelled as Document B dated December 4, 1625) which are the \\"longest and most complete documents completely handwritten in baybayin\\". The two documents are part of a book compilation of baybayin documents dubbed as the \\"biggest collection of extant ancient baybayin scripts in the world\\". They are also the oldest known deeds of sale for land in the Philippines during the Spanish colonization. The 1613 documents established Don Andres Capiit as the land owner after buying an irrgiated land in Tondo from Do√±a Catalina Baycan as described in Document A. He was married to Do√±a Francisca Longar who bought the land in Mayhaligue (now Santa Cruz, Manila) from Do√±a Maria Silang as described in the 1625 document (Document B). When Capiit died sometime between 1613 and 1625, Longar was remarried to Don Luis Castilla, who sold some lands to the University of Santo Tomas in 1629. When the ownership of Castilla was contested in court, he showed Documents A and B as proof of ownership. Since the university already acquired the land, the deeds of sale were later transferred into the university's custody. The baybayin documents were first shown in the public during the tricentennary of the university in 1911. That same year, the documents were first published in Libertas, a daily newspaper published by the university.  Management  The UST Miguel de Benavides Library The Archives of the University of Santo Tomas (Archivo de la Universidad de Santo Tomas, or simply UST Archives) at the Miguel de Benavides Library take care of the documents. The original baybayin documents are not available to the public and only replicas of the documents are made available through the university archives' bulletin board in the fifth floor of the Central Library.

Elements of the New Zealand Division scaled the fortified walls of the French town of Le Quesnoy and captured it from elements of the defending German 22nd Division. Beginning at 5:30 am, the New Zealand Rifle Brigade advanced from its starting positions east of the town, aiming to surround it and link up on the far side. By late morning, the linkup had been achieved and other elements of the New Zealand Division moved further west into the Mormal Forest, leaving the Rifle Brigade to capture the town itself. After mopping up outlying outposts, the New Zealanders moved up to the ramparts of the town, but were held back by machine-gun fire. Late in the afternoon, a scouting party located an unguarded section of the walls and the brigade's 4th Battalion managed to climb the ramparts and move into the town, quickly seizing it. The capture of Le Quesnoy was the last major engagement of the war for the New Zealanders. Prelude By mid-1918, the German Army had been fought to a standstill after its Spring Offensive and the Allies had sought to take the initiative. Accordingly, the Hundred Days Offensive began on 8 August, with an attack on Amiens which marked the beginning of a series of advances by the Allies that ultimately ended the war. By late October, the New Zealand Division, commanded by Major General Andrew Russell, along with part of the British Third Army, had advanced to the west of the town of Le Quesnoy. The Battle of the Sambre, which was planned to begin on 4 November, was the next phase of the Allied advance. The battle was to consist of a series of engagements mounted by the British First, Third and Fourth Armies across a front, extending from Oisy to Valenciennes, that were conceptualised to cut off the German line of retreat from the French Army front. IV Corps, with the New Zealand Division and the 37th Division, was to surround Le Quesnoy and its garrison of over 1,500 soldiers. The 37th Division was on the southern flank of the New Zealand Division while to its north, 62nd Division, of VI Corps, moved south to shorten the New Zealand front. The New Zealand Division was to extend the front line to and around Le Quesnoy and into the Mormal Forest. =Le Quesnoy= Positioned on high ground between the Ecaillon and Rhonelle Rivers, Le Quesnoy was a medieval town that had been fought over several times in previous centuries. It guarded a natural approach across plains to the north- east and had fortress walls with ramparts designed by S√©bastien Le Prestre de Vauban, a 17th-century military engineer. A moat surrounded the town and was in fact two distinct ditches, with high fortifications, effectively an outer rampart, separating them. The town could be entered by three roads, guarded by gates. Le Quesnoy had a population of 5,000 and had been in German hands since August 1914. The area was garrisoned by the German 22nd Division, which was well understrength; its Infantry Regiment 167 held the main defensive position, along the Cambrai railway line to the west of Le Quesnoy, and was supported by Infantry Regiment 82 to the south. Providing artillery support, the 22nd Division's artillery regiment was positioned to the east of Le Quesnoy. The town itself was defended by a battalion of the 83rd Reserve Infantry Regiment which had two companies on the western ramparts while another two companies were positioned on the south walls; some light machine- guns were also in the town as were three field artillery guns. The battalion was significantly reduced in fighting personnel; each company only had on average 17 men, and there were only around 120 to 130 defenders in the town, excluding medical personnel and wounded soldiers being treated. =Plan of attack= On 3 November, the New Zealand Division section of the front line was around in length, running southwards from a level crossing on the Valenciennes railway line. It was from the Cambrai railway, with the ramparts of Le Quesnoy a further to the east. The front line was manned by the four battalions of the New Zealand Rifle Brigade, commanded by Brigadier General Herbert Hart. The ramparts of Le Quesnoy clearly made a frontal attack undesirable and artillery could not be used on the town, due to the presence of the civilian population. Instead, it was intended that under the cover of a smokescreen, the town be enveloped from the north and south, thereby encircling it. Two New Zealand brigades were to be involved; Hart's Rifle Brigade was tasked with the capture of the town, while the 1st Infantry Brigade, under the command of Brigadier General Charles Melvill, was to push into the Mormal Forest. The division's flanks were held by the 62nd Division and the 37th Division, on the left and right respectively and these formations were to make corresponding movements forward. H. Stewart, 1921 The capture of Le Quesnoy was to be achieved through a series of advances, covered by artillery, by the battalions of the Rifle Brigade with some of the battalions of 1st Infantry Brigade in support. Beginning from the brigade's existing positions, the first advance was to involve the 1st, 2nd and 4th Rifle Battalions moving forward to a line defining an arc to the west of Le Quesnoy, including the railway line, which was designated the \\"Blue Line\\". Then the 1st Battalion of the 1st Infantry Brigade would push north-east around the town, while the 3rd Rifle Battalion went to the south-east. The advance westwards would culminate in the establishment of a new front line, designated the \\"Green Line\\" to the east of Le Quesnoy, which would be manned by the battalions of 1st Brigade. Once the \\"Green Line\\" had been formed, the Rifle Brigade was to move into the town, while the battalions of 1st Brigade were to advance further to the west up to the Mormal Forest. Battle The covering artillery barrage commenced at and three battalions of the Rifle Brigade moved off towards its first objective, the railway line, which established a continuous front west of Le Quesnoy. This was captured by A reserve company moved to the railway line to hold it, while the attacking battalions moved forward. A platoon of the reserve company had to deal with 150 Germans, who were retreating from the advance of the flanking 37th Division. Despite the advantage of numbers, the Germans quickly surrendered. By the battalions of the Rifle Brigade had surrounded Le Quesnoy and established a new front line to the east of the town. The 1st Infantry Brigade moved off to the Mormal Forest, leaving the Rifle Brigade to complete its planned move into the town. The German garrison, now reinforced with soldiers who had evaded capture by the New Zealanders and retreated into the town, did not make any indications of surrender. The 2nd Rifle Battalion probed from the north, while the 3rd Rifle Battalion did the same from the south-east, driving for the Landrecies road which led to one of the entry points into Le Quesnoy. German troops held a bridge on the road in force and were able to keep the New Zealanders at bay in this area. In the north, a small party reached the outer rampart dividing the moat along their stretch of the front. Gunfire from the main ramparts soon drove them off but Lieutenant Colonel Leonard Jardine, commanding the 2nd Rifle Battalion, co-ordinated the movements of his companies, which gradually moved forward. By mortar fire was able to be brought to bear on the main ramparts and this silenced the German machine-guns. Members of the New Zealand Rifle Brigade operating a mortar at the front near Le Quesnoy, 1918 In the meantime, the 4th Rifle Battalion, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Harold Barrowclough and positioned a distance from the west wall of the ramparts, had carried out scouting expeditions to explore the defences. Gradually, the German posts around the fortifications fell to the attacking platoons of the battalion. As on the northern side of the town, machine-gun fire from the ramparts prevented any further advance. One party reached the outer rampart but became pinned down by gunfire for several hours. By midday, the situation had settled into a temporary stalemate. In the afternoon, some German prisoners of war were sent into the town with an invitation to surrender but this approach was rebuffed, as had been a similar attempt earlier that morning. Second Lieutenant Leslie Averill, the intelligence officer for 4th Rifle Battalion, continued to investigate the defences. He was able to locate a route to a section of the ramparts that appeared unmanned and was not under fire from the defenders. He was ordered by Barrowclough to force an approach. With the benefit of covering mortar fire, Averill and a platoon of the battalion reserve company managed to cross the moat and found themselves at the inner ramparts. With the aid of a ladder supplied by the Divisional Engineers, Averill was able to ascend to the top of the ramparts, closely followed by the platoon commander. With his revolver, Averill fired at two Germans manning a guard post, forcing them to cover, and the rest of the platoon joined him. With an entrance through the defenses secured, Barrowclough and the rest of the battalion used the ladder and entered the town shortly afterwards. At the same time, a party from 2nd Rifle Battalion, seized the gate guarding the road into Le Quesnoy from Valenciennes and began entering the town from the north; subsequently, the Germans quickly surrendered. Aftermath A painting depicting the scaling of the walls of Le Quesnoy by Second Lieutenant Averill, executed in 1920 by George Edmund Butler, who was an official artist of the New Zealand Expeditionary Force Over 2,000 Germans were taken prisoner by the division, of whom 711 surrendered in Le Quesnoy. German casualties in the town were 43 killed and 251 men wounded and many more German troops were killed during the advance of the brigade to the ramparts. Four 8-inch howitzers, forty-two 4.2-inch guns and 26 field guns were captured by the 1st New Zealand Brigade. The New Zealand Division operation on 4 November was its most successful day on the Western Front. Of the 122 New Zealanders who died during the capture of Le Quesnoy, the Rifle Brigade sustained the most losses, with 43 killed (with an additional 250 men wounded). Other units of the New Zealand Division involved in the battle lost 79 men killed and about 125 wounded. An advance into the Mormal Forest was continued the next day by the 2nd Infantry Brigade but the capture of Le Quesnoy was the last major engagement of the war for the New Zealand Division. The New Zealanders began withdrawing to the rear area at midnight on 5 November. A few days after the capture of the town, the mayor of Le Quesnoy presented the Rifle Brigade commander, Herbert Hart, with the French flag that was raised over the town on the day it was captured from the Germans. The town retains links to New Zealand, with some streets named for prominent New Zealanders, including Averill. Since 1999, it has been twinned with Cambridge. A monument commemorating the liberation of Le Quesnoy by the New Zealand Division is set into the rampart wall, near where Averill scaled them.

He plays either at right back or as a central defender. Pandiani's career has alternated between the lower divisions of Spanish football, with Villarreal C, Atl√©tico Baleares, Marino de Luanco, Masnou, Real Avil√©s and mst recently Navarro, and the Uruguayan professional divisions, with Miramar Misiones, for which he played Primera Divisi√≥n football alongside his father, Walter Pandiani, and Canadian. He also spent half a season with Maltese Premier League club ƒ¶amrun Spartans. Life and career Pandiani was born in Montevideo, Uruguay, the eldest of three sons of Uruguay international striker Walter Pandiani. The family moved to Spain after Walter established his career there. Nico played in the youth system of CE Premi√†, and had linked up with the junior teams of Espanyol in 2012‚Äì13 pre-season as part of a trial, but then followed his father to Villarreal in August 2012, where he was to play for the club's C team. In January 2013, the pair moved on to Segunda Divisi√≥n B (third tier) club Atl√©tico Baleares, where son as well as father signed a first-team contract. Pandiani made his league debut on 14 April, as a second-half substitute in a 2‚Äì0 win away to Levante B, and played once more, starting the penultimate game of the season, a 2‚Äì1 defeat away at Sant Andreu, in which his father scored the opening goal. In late October 2013, Pandiani and Walter returned to Uruguay to join Primera Divisi√≥n strugglers Miramar Misiones, where Walter hoped to fulfil his dream of playing professionally in the same team as his son (Atl√©tico Baleares was not a professional team). Pandiani was ineligible to play in the Apertura, and he finally made his professional debut ‚Äì under his father's captaincy ‚Äì on the third matchday of the Clausura, on 16 February 2014 away to El Tanque Sisley. Miramar lost 1‚Äì0, and Pandiani failed to clear the ball that set up the goal for the hosts. He played once more before relegation was confirmed with five games still to play, and then started the remaining matches to bring his total appearances to seven. For the 2014‚Äì15 season, Pandiani returned to Spain and signed for Segunda B club Marino de Luanco. He made his debut on 20 September as a very late substitute in a 2‚Äì2 draw at Atl√©tico Astorga, and made 13 league appearances over the season. His team struggled throughout the campaign, and finished 15 points adrift at the bottom of the division. Pandiani left Luanco at the end of the season and returned to Uruguay, where he trained with and was reported to have signed for Canadian of the Segunda Divisi√≥n. Although expected to start the opening match of the season at the end of October, administrative issues related to international clearance prevented his appearance. A few days later, Spanish club Masnou announced his arrival on a contract to the end of the 2015‚Äì16 season. He scored twice from 23 Tercera Divisi√≥n appearances, mostly as a starter, before again returning to Uruguay. He re-signed for Miramar Misiones in September 2016, but played only three matches in the before signing definitively for Canadian for the , in which he was a first-team regular. Pandiani returned to Spanish football in January 2018, signing for Tercera Divisi√≥n club Real Avil√©s until the end of the season. He made 11 appearances before his contract expired, and then joined ƒ¶amrun Spartans of the Maltese Premier League, where he played only oncestarting in the 2‚Äì1 defeat away to Hiberniansbefore rejoining Real Avil√©s a year after first signing for them. Pandiani played regularly as Avil√©s finished in 14th place, and signed for another year. By mid-season, wages were in arrears, the team was shipping goals and defensive changes were needed. Pandiani was out of favour as well as suffering from a groin injury, and on the last day of the transfer window he moved on to another Tercera club, Navarro. He was only able to play four matches before the season was suspended because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Above all, he is remembered for the landscapes he painted in the north west of Zealand as a member of the artists' colony known as the Odsherred Painters. In 1932, he was one of the founding members of the Corner artists association. Much of his work can be seen at Odsherreds Museum of Art. Biography The adopted son of a customs official, Ejstrup was brought up in Buddinge, north of Copenhagen. A self-taught painter, he was unsuccessful in gaining admission to the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts but learnt wood engraving under Aksel J√∏rgensen in various periods from 1931 to 1937. He debuted in 1926 at the Kunstnernes Efter√•rsudstilling (Artists' Autumn Exhibition) and was a founding member of the Corner exhibition in 1932. In 1930, he settled in √Ösen near Ordrup in Odsherred together with Karl Bovin and later bought an old homestead near Skamleb√¶k where he lived until 1944. Thereafter, every year he spent extensive periods in Odsherred. Artistic style and works Ejstrup's evocative scenes of the peaceful countryside are painted with a rather limited palette. They often include buildings, outhouses, farm animals and the occasional human figure but most impressively they sometimes feature horses, often running or jumping about, giving the works a dramatic effect. By contrast, his figure paintings are more vividly coloured and have an expressive tone. His engravings include Tolv tr√¶snit fra byen (Twelve Woodcuts from the City, 1935). Ejstrup's paintings, woodcuts, sculptures and drawings can be seen in many of Denmark's art museums. Statens Museum for Kunst has a large collection of his works. His work has been widely exhibited in Denmark as well as in Glasgow, Oslo and Gothenburg. Ejstrup was awarded the Eckersberg Medal in 1954.

At the , Mount Alford recorded a population of 268. A store, school and church in the area were first built in the late 1880s. A cemetery, war memorial and other churches were established later.  Geography  Mount Alford General Store Mount Alford is a typical scenic Rim community surrounded by rich agricultural land. Teviot Brook passes just to the east of the town. Downstream is the Wyaralong Dam. Erosion along Blackrock Creek has prompted the Scenic Rim Regional Council and SEQ Catchments to implement on- farm infrastructure and land management practice changes to reduce sediment runoff and improve water quality. In the south west of the locality the land slopes upwards towards Mount Moon. Directly to the north and west of Mount Alford is Moogerah Dam and the Moogerah Peaks. The larger settlement of Boonah is located nearby with main roads linking to Ipswich and Beaudesert.  History  Mount Alford was previously known as Reckumpilla. It was renamed after Thomas Alford who managed Coochin Coochin station from 1868 onwards. A general store opened in the town in c1888 by August Anders. The building was rebuilt in 1913 upon sale by the Anders family. = School = War memorial at Mount Alford State School, 2016 St Peters Church of England, circa 1919Mount Alford Provisional School opened on 4 April 1888. On 1 January 1901 it became Mount Alford State School. A monument to those who served and who were killed in World War I was unveiled at the school on Saturday 25 May 1918 by John Douglas Story, (Undersecretary for Education in Queensland). It is the smallest \\"digger\\" statue on a war memorial in Queensland. = Anglican church = Memorial for Gertrude Augusta Bell, Bowman Park, Mount Alford, 2017 Plaque marking the location of St Phillip's Anglican Church and cemetery, Mount Alford, 2917 From 1898, Anglican church services were held at the school, led by A.J.C. Rivett. In April 1914, Mrs Gertude Augusta Bell of Coochin Coochin donated ¬£30 to commence a building fund for an Anglican church in Mount Alford. On 16 November 1918, Bishop Henry Le Fanu laid the foundation stone for the Anglican church on the northeastern corner of Reckumpilla Street and Cavanagah Street (). Tenders were called for a builder in January 1919; it was built by Mr Kelleher. St Peter's Anglican church was dedicated on Saturday 25 November 1919 by the Anglican Archbishop of Brisbane St Clair Donaldson. The church was made from wood with a shingle roof and all its furnishings were made from silky oak. It was 46 feet long and 26 feet wide with a chancel of 12 feet by 8 feet. The cost of the church was about ¬£900 of which ¬£150 remained unpaid when the church was opened. An Anglican cemetery was established with its first burial (Gertrude Augusta Bell) on Sunday 11 August 1946. The church held its last service on 25 December 1969. On 11 December 1873 it was decided to sell the church building for removal. In 2017, Bowman Park occupies the site of the church and cemetery. A plaque commemorates the church and a memorial commemorates the Bell family members who were buried there. = Lutheran Church = Former St John's Lutheran Church, Mount Alford, 2005 The first Lutheran services in Mount Alford were held in the School of Arts by Pastor Christian Wilhelm Seybold. On 23 October 1908, a meeting was held that decided to build a church. Mr Wissemann offered an acre of land. By December 1908, local Lutherans had raised ¬£120 towards a church building. The church was built by the Behrendorff family (Ambrosius Victor, Wilhelm Carl Johann, and Carl) using sawn timber for the Behrendorff sawmill. The finished church was 30 feet long and 24 feet wide and cost ¬£155 (including the fence). The Lutheran church in Mount Alford was opened and dedicated on 7 May 1909. The original trust for the church stipulated that only married men and widowers could be trustees (but not bachelors). An English Sunday School commenced on 26 August 1911 (most Lutheran churches conducted their activities entirely in German until World War I at which time many switched to the use of English to avoid suspicion about their loyalties). The first baptism in the church was W. Behrendorff. The first couple to be married in the church were Wilhelm Labuschewski and Mary Louisa Kaden on 27 September 1911. The church building was lined in 1936 for its 25th anniversary. A bible was presented by Mr and Mrs J. Gesler in 1943. In 1956 Charles Behrendorff made a baptismal font and a new altar was built in 1959. The pastors of the church (until 1988) were Christian Wilhelm Seybold, Rudolf Monz, Anton Hiller, Martin Frederick Prenzler, Alfred Hugo Schubert, Gerald David Dahlenberg, David Frederick Siegle, J. Perkins, R. Goldhardt, and K.D. Kotzur. The church subsequently closed and is in use as a private residence, but a notice over its doorway says \\"St John's Lutheran Church ‚Äì Estd 1909\\". = Methodist/Uniting church = The Methodist church opened in December 1921.

Coach Morrison was asked to fill in for Dan McGugin who was in the US Army at the time. Background The Commodores usual coach, Dan McGugin, was on leave from Vanderbilt for Army duty, leaving future Vanderbilt head coach Ray Morrison as the interim head coach. Coach Morrison played at Vanderbilt from 1908 to 1911 playing halfback and quarterback for McGugin. After leaving Vanderbilt as a player he moved to coaching; his first head coaching job was at SMU from 1915 to 1916 and from 1922 to 1934. Schedule Season summary =Tennessee= Vanderbilt program considers the game between the two schools as an official game, however, University of Tennessee does not since most of their team was enlisted in the military fighting in World War I. During the two-year period of 1917 and 1918 without varsity football, two unofficial teams were formed from Army recruits and students. One of these unofficial teams that represented the University of Tennessee was the Student Army Training Corps, which came to play in Nashville in 1918. There was a game played that afternoon on Vanderbilt's original Dudley Field. According to the Nashville Tennessean and the Nashville American, the game was to benefit the United War Work Fund. Reserved seats were $1.00. \\"When the Tennessee clan comes down from the eastern mountains and comes to Dudley Field around 2:30 o'clock today, the Commodores will have quite a little argument to settle with them. It dates back to the fall of 1916, when the Vol eleven surprised Vandy with a 10‚àí6 defeat and then crawled into their hole for two years gloating over their accomplishment. Yes, the Black and Gold must be vindicated today.\\" Grailey Berryhill The Journal and Tribune in Knoxville reported before the game, \\"It is expected that the Orange and White players will give a good account of themselves in the game today, when the S.A.T.C. eleven goes against Vanderbilt, at Nashville.\\" This is a clear reference to the football team representing UT as the Student Army Training Corps. Vanderbilt won the game by a score of 74‚Äì0 (both media guides report 76‚Äì0) and the Vols were always referred to as the University of Tennessee and not Student Army Training Corps. The Journal and Tribune reported on the game's results: \\"Against the University of Tennessee weak resistance, the Vanderbilt football eleven today ran rampant and piled up a score of 74‚àí0. (Grailey) Berryhill, the sensational Vanderbilt back, had one of the greatest days of his football career accounting for six of the eleven's dozen touchdowns against the Knoxville clan.\\" Sports writer Cicero Slack of the Tennessean wrote: \\"Crumbling the University of Tennessee eleven like to a page of tissue in the mailed fist of a giant, the Commodores yesterday out on Dudley Field walked over their prostrate foe to a 74‚àí0 victory and gained sweet revenge for the 1916 defeat.\\" Berryhill's six touchdowns are not in the Vanderbilt record book probably because this would not be considered the modern era. Frank Mordica's five touchdowns in 1978 are listed as the Vanderbilt record for most touchdowns in a single game. An authority on Vanderbilt football history was the late Nashville Banner sportswriter Fred Russell. In Russell's book Fifty Years of Vanderbilt Football published in 1938, he writes about the 1918 Vanderbilt‚ÄìTennessee football game: \\"Salient after salient was wiped out by Gen. Morrison's forces and Tennessee's reinforcements could not check the tide. The retreat turned into a bloody, hopeless rout. Berryhill was cited for bravery for his wonderful outflanking the enemy, by which he took six positions (touchdowns) single-handedly. The result was 76‚àí0.\\" Russell records the game in his book as a victory for the Commodores. =Sewanee= *Sources: Vanderbilt beat the rival Sewanee Tigers 40-0, a larger score than had been expected.

An African American, Buckles was a member of NASCAR's first Drive for Diversity class after cutting his teeth at the regional racing level. In 2006, Buckles planned to race in the ARCA Racing Series and Sprint Cup Series with a team owned by former NFL wide receiver Terance Mathis, but the deal ultimately fell through. Buckles has a degree in mechanical engineering from Southern Polytechnic State University, and has served as an instructor at the Richard Petty Driving Experience. History =Early career= Buckles began racing go-karts at age six. Driving in the World Karting Association, he won 22 races in his first year and 161 out of 252 total starts. For much of his career, he had to race out of his own pocket, getting the most out of second class equipment and holding his own with local legends. Buckles calls the son of Wendell Scott, Wendell Scott, Jr. his mentor. From 1995 to 1998, Buckles drove in the Sportsman and Late model divisions at Lanier Raceplex. In 1999, he competed in seven PARTS Pro Truck events at Concord Speedway, earning several top 5s and the \\"Hard Charger\\" award for passing the most trucks in a race. In 2000, he attended the Skip Barber Racing School and was the fastest in his class. In 2001, Buckles drove a Pontiac Late model in the NASCAR Weekly Racing Series for the Miller Racing Group, run by black owners Leonard W. Miller and his son Leonard T. Miller. According to the junior Miller, Buckles possessed the talent \\"to be the next Dale Earnhardt,\\" but that he needed \\"5,000 practice laps\\" to be ready for the Cup Series. In January, the team signed a one-year contract with Dr. Pepper, with the sponsorship rumored to be as high as $100,000. The deal involved the Rev. Jesse Jackson and his Rainbow/PUSH initiative. Buckles reached victory lane in July at Coastal Plains Speedway, the first black driver to win a NASCAR sanctioned event since Wendell Scott's legendary win (though Darrell Wallace, Jr. would go on to get the first series win in one of the three national series since Scott in 2013). After his victory, Morty was sent \\"straight to the podium...as other competitors 'waved rebel flags at [him] in defiance.'\\" Overall, Buckles finished in the top ten in 80 percent of his races. Buckles participated in an ARCA Racing Series test session at Daytona International Speedway in December 2001 for Bobby Gerhart in a number 7 Chevrolet. He clocked in at 50.356 seconds (178.727 mph), 19th fastest. Rich Woodland, Jr. would ultimately drive the car at the Daytona season-opener for 2002. =Drive for Diversity= In 2004, Buckles was selected to be part of NASCAR's first Drive for Diversity class for that season, driving the No. 54 National Guard Ford in the Late model division of the NASCAR Weekly Racing Series, splitting the year between Southampton Motor Speedway and Motor Mile Speedway in Virginia. Buckles drove for Belnavis Racing, owned by Roush Racing's chief diversity officer Sam Belnavis (Roush ran the National Guard sponsorship in the Cup Series). The team was also supported by Travis Carter Motorsports (which ran the No. 54 National Guard Ford in the Cup Series the previous season in a partnership with Belnavis). Buckles posted 15 top 10s in 19 races. Later in the year, Buckles participated in a recruitment combine for Roush Racing (now Roush Fenway Racing), frequently referred to as The Gong Show, at North Wilkesboro Speedway. Buckles returned to the program and the 54 car in 2005, but was one of several drivers to depart from the D4D program due to feeling limited by the equipment and resources provided to them. =Victory Motorsports= In July 2005, Buckles left the Diversity program to join former NFL wide receiver Terance Mathis and his new race team Victory Motorsports, planning to race in the Nextel Cup Series and ARCA Racing Series. Established Cup team Morgan-McClure Motorsports (which received support and engines from Hendrick Motorsports) would provide technical support for the new No. 04 Chevrolet. In a 2005 test session at Kentucky Speedway, Roush Racing Cup driver Carl Edwards noticed Morty's performance, saying \\"Where has this guy been hiding?\\" Mathis and the 34-year-old Buckles ambitiously planned 20 Cup races and a dozen ARCA races for 2006, but the deal never fully materialized. Buckles attempted one ARCA race at Nashville Speedway with ST2 Motorsports, failing to qualify in their No. 67 Dodge. Mathis would later attempt to purchase RJ Racing and their No. 37 Dodge team, but that deal would also fall through. Personal life Buckles has a wife Maria, also an engineer, and three children (Jada, Jordan, and Justin). Buckles and his father are family friends of former driver Ken Ragan and current Sprint Cup Series driver David Ragan, both of whom are also Georgia natives. The Buckles relationship with the Ragans goes back to the 1940s, when Morty Buckles' grandfather worked as a mechanic on the race team owned by Ken Ragan's father (David Ragan's grandfather).

They were treated with considerable respect and could enjoy high social positions. During the 1st Dynasty (c. 3150-2900 BC), dwarfs served and worked directly for the king and royal household, and a number have been found buried in subsidiary tombs around those of the kings. In fact, the rather high proportion of dwarfs in the royal cemeteries of the 1st Dynasty suggests some may have been brought into Egypt from elsewhere. Later, in the Old Kingdom (c. 2680-2180 BC), dwarfs were employed as jewellers, tailors, cup-bearers and zookeepers, could found families or be brought into one. Pygmies were employed as dancers for special occasions and religious festivals. The social position of dwarfs seems to have declined after the Old Kingdom. By the time of the New Kingdom (c. 1550-1070 BC) they were depicted in ridiculing ways, and while the papyrus \\"The wise doctrine of Amenemope, son of Kanakht\\" asks people not to treat them badly, this probably shows that they were subject to abuse. In Egyptian art, dwarfs and pygmies are depicted realistically which enables their identification as cases of nanism. The ancient Egyptians had three words and special hieroglyphs for dwarfs and revered several dwarf deities, in particular Bes, the god of the household and birth, and two dwarf forms of Ptah.  Terms and depictions  =Hieroglyphic writing= Tomb stele of the court dwarf Ser-Inpw (1st dynasty); origin: AbydosW. M. Flinders Petrie: The Royal Tombs of the First Dynasties. Part 1 (= Memoir of the Egypt Exploration Fund. Volume 18; ISSN 0307-5109). Egypt Exploration Fund, London 1900-1901, table XXXII., obj. 17. The ancient Egyptians used three terms to describe peoples with short stature: the first of these was Deneg, Daneg or Dag (depending on different transcriptions), which simply means \\"little human\\", \\"dwarf\\" and/or \\"pygmy\\". The Egyptian hieroglyphs used for these words could be combined with the determinative of a dwarf, alternatively the determinative was used alone. Stelae of the 1st Dynasty show only the determinative, implying that the determinative itself was read Deneg, Daneg or Dag and with the same meaning.William R. Dawson: Pygmies and dwarfs in ancient Egypt. In: Journal of Egyptian Archaeology. 24, 1938, , pp. 185‚Äì189.Veronique Dasen: Dwarfs in Ancient Egypt and Greece. Oxford University Press, Oxford (UK) 2013, , pp. 54‚Äì58, 107‚Äì149.Karl-Joachim Seyfried: Zwerg. In: Wolfgang Helck a.o.: Lexikon der √Ñgyptologie (L√Ñ), vol. VI. Harrassowitz, Wiesbaden 1986, , pp. 1432‚Äì1435. In later times, these words were often combined with further determinatives such as the one for \\"clothes/fashion\\" (Gardiner sign S38), literally describing a \\"fashion dwarf\\" (Egyptian Daneg-seret); or with the determinative of a dancer (Gardiner sign A32) for a \\"dancing dwarf\\" (Egyptian Daneg-ibaw). During the Middle Kingdom period, two new words concerning dwarfs and pygmies appeared: Nemw, meaning \\"malformed one\\" pointing to the genetic origin of Egyptian dwarfs as persons born with achondroplasia; and Hewa meaning \\"shepherd\\" or \\"cattle drover\\". =Depictions= The typical depiction of a dwarf in Egyptian art is realistic, showing a normally grown torso and head, but visibly shortened and slightly bent arms and legs. These proportions point to achondroplasia and hypochondroplasia as the conditions responsible for the dwarfism of the individual. Yet, there are also reliefs of small peoples with normal body proportions and it remains unclear if these representations show real pygmies or if these people are represented small in order to reflect their low rank or accentuate the main scene of the relief. The earliest known depictions of dwarfs in Egypt date to the early 1st Dynasty (c. 3100 - c. 2890 BC) and were found in the royal cemetery at Abydos. These are reliefs carved on private stelae placed in subsidiary tombs around that of the king. All surviving stelae are damaged and weathered, but the represented dwarfs can be seen to wear gold collars, fine linen skirts and carry insignia such as staffs of office and cloth seals, typical for high-ranking officials and priests. Depictions of dwarfs also appear in black-ink inscriptions on ceramics and earthen beer jugs. In addition, several ivory figurines showing male and female dwarfs were uncovered in Abydos. Again, many of these figurines show the dwarfs wearing gold collars, fine linen skirts and even fine stepped dreadlock wigs. Some of the female figurines are shown in a gesture typical for the birth in standing position and others clearly depict a pregnant woman. It is believed that these special figurines of female dwarfs were good luck charms for pregnant women intended to draw luck for the birth of healthy children.  Origins  The proportion of dwarfs in the royal cemetery in Abydos is much larger than in a normal population. Thus, it is possible that some of these dwarfs were bought from elsewhere - or even came to Egypt voluntarily as a land where they could expect to rise to a high social status. In support for this hypothesis, Hermann Junker,Hermann Junker: G√Æza V: Die Mastaba des Snb (Seneb) und die umliegenden Gr√§ber. Akademie der Wissenschaften in Wien: Philosophisch-historische Klasse, Denkschriften 71.2, Wien/Leipzig 1941, pp. 7-11. Jacques Jean Cl√©re and Hans Felix Wolf point to the Egyptian word Isww, meaning \\"I have bought (this)\\", and which often occurs in connection with dwarfs. However, it remains unclear if most of the dwarfs and pygmies were bought or if they \\"rented\\" themselves to institutions such as temples, shrines and even the pharaoh's court. Especially during the Early Dynastic Period (c. 3100-2680 BC) and Old Kingdom (c. 2680-2180 BC), it was common in upper-class households that important sums of some kind were paid whenever dwarfs performed public dances or other duties. Similarly, valuables were exchanged whenever dwarfs and pygmies switched their employer or there was a change of the head of the house. Evidently, in rare cases, nanism would appear naturally within a healthy, normally grown family. Thus not all dwarfs and pygmies were inevitably gained by bestowal or acquisition.  Differentiations  The Ancient Egyptians differentiated between \\"real\\" (genetic) dwarfs and pygmies, who arrived in Egypt, presumably as valuably exotic captives, from (again presumably) those areas of west Africa where members of this ethnic group still live (an enormous distance from the pharaonic kingdom, particularly given the lack of modern communications), though a possible origin for the dancing pygmies might have been modern day Sudan or Ethiopia (if they were formerly more widespread). Pygmies were exclusively hired on very special occasions for dancing and for acrobatic performances at temples and shrines. Dwarfs instead, were exclusively hired for highly skilled craftings and artistic duties. However, modern Egyptologists admonish for caution, the ancient Egyptian did not differ between dwarfs and pygmies to discriminate them, they simply chose their activities according to their skills.Brigitte Goede: Brief Pepis II. an Herchuf, Gouverneur von Elephantine, wegen eines Tanzzwergs. In: Gabriele H√∂ber-Kamel: Elephantine, das Tor zu Afrika. (= Kemet Heft 3/2005), Kemet Verlag, Berlin 2000, , pp. 23‚Äì25.  Social ranks and careers  = Social ranks = Dwarfs were treated with considerable respect in Ancient Egyptian society, notably during the Early Dynastic and Old Kingdom periods. Their natural nanism was seen as a celestial gift, and discrimination and social exclusion seem to have been unknown to the Egyptians. In most cases in which dwarfs were brought into a new family, they seem to have been accepted at once as full-fledged members. They were assigned special, exclusive duties, which were normally performed by the highest-ranked officials, such as priests and treasurers. Even in many royal households, next to the king, dwarfs were allowed to serve and work.Hans-Werner Fischer-Elfert: Lache nicht √ºber einen Blinden und verspotte nicht einen Zwerg! : √úber den Umgang mit Behinderten im Alten √Ñgypten. In: Max Liedtke: Behinderung als p√§dagogische und politische Herausforderung. Historische und systematische Aspekte (= Schriftenreihe zum Bayerischen Schulmuseum Ichenhausen, Bd. 14.), Klinkhardt, Bad Heilbrunn 1996, , pp. 93‚Äì116. The unusually high ranks and social positions that dwarfs enjoyed explain, for example, their important presence in subsidiary tombs around those of the 1st Dynasty pharaohs. These subsidiary tombs were reserved for the direct and most loyal servants of the ruler. To be allowed to be buried so close to the king shows how respected dwarfs were at that time. In the 6th Dynasty, during the reign of king Pepi II (2284-2184 BC), we know of a letter written by the then young king and addressed to his high official and prince Harkhuf who was sent to Elephantine in order to ask about the condition and whereabouts of a \\"dancing dwarf\\" (Egyptian Daneg ibaw). Harkhuf was ordered to bring the dwarf, which originated from the fabled Punt, to the palace of the king healthy and unharmed, no matter what the cost. The appointed passage includes that the king \\"desires to see the dwarf even more than to receive the precious gifts from Punt\\". The letter also reveals that before this event, already several dwarfs were brought from Punt into the royal household. = Family founding = Statue of the dwarf Seneb, his wife and children, 4th or 5th dynasty The best-known case of nanism in ancient Egypt is that of the high official Seneb, as a finely-carved statue-group of the dwarf and his family has survived in excellent preservation. Seneb worked during the late 4th Dynasty (c. 2613-2494 BC) or early 5th Dynasty (c. 2498-2345 BC), most possibly under king Shepseskaf and his successors. Seneb was married to a normally grown woman named Senet-ites. He had two daughters named Awib-en-Khufu and Semeret-Radjedef and one son named Ankh-ima-Radjedef, all of whom are represented as of normal stature. This shows that it was accepted that dwarfs might have families and healthy children. Note that the two children shown in front of Seneb's seat in the accompanying illustration are in the position where the legs of a 'normal' statue would be represented, thus lessening - though not concealing - his abnormal appearance. Because Seneb's father was normally grown, Seneb's case also proves that not all dwarfs were brought from foreign countries, nanism occasionally occurring - as would be expected from modern experience - within Egyptian families. In other cases, where persons also having short stature are depicted as servants of other dwarfs, it is possible that they were part of the same family. However, this remains a matter for conjecture, as it was not uncommon during the Old Kingdom period, that artists depicted the same person multiple time in one scene. They did this to show that the main character performed several duties at the same time. = Careers = As already mentioned, dwarfs were allowed to have several high ranked jobs and could move up the ranks during their career. Old Kingdom reliefs depict dwarfs performing mainly easy, rather creative jobs, because their shortened and fragile stature did not allow for hard or dangerous physical work. Unsurprisingly then dwarfs mainly worked as jewelers, tailors, cup-bearers and even as zookeepers. As at other periods, dwarfs were particularly valued as treasurers or jewellers, as their very distinctive appearance would make any dishonest dealings on their part that much more difficult to get away with. Zoo-keeping seems in fact, in the surviving evidence, the most common work performed by dwarfs. Royal zookeepers mostly took care of the king's pets such as hunting dogs, domestic cats and guenons. This may be because these animals were very easy to tame and would not become a danger to the dwarfs. A unique relief from the mastaba of the high official Nyankhnesw (6th Dynasty) shows a dwarf taking a leopard for a walk. In another tomb (that of the high official Nofer, also of the 6th Dynasty), one relief shows a dwarf and his guenon while the little ape pilfers grapes from a fruit basket and plays with his cord. Further Old Kingdom reliefs suggest that guenons literally assisted their keepers: in the tomb of Kaaper a unique relief depicts a dwarf and his guenon, as they both specify the clock for a pair of musicians. In contrast, depictions of dwarfs working themselves as musicians are very rare. Old Kingdom inscriptions reveal that dwarfs had the chance to be promoted in their professions and offices. High rank titles such as ‚Ä≥overseer of the dwarfs in the house-of-clothes‚Ä≥ and ‚Ä≥overseer of the goldsmiths‚Ä≥, and honorary titles such as ‚Ä≥friend of the king‚Ä≥, ‚Ä≥beloved of the king‚Ä≥ and ‚Ä≥head of the palace‚Ä≥ prove that dwarfs were socially treated on par with normally grown people. However, it remains unclear whether dwarfs were allowed to perform duties in temple services and rituals. The few reliefs showing dwarfs involved in feasts such as the Hathor feast and the Heb Sed allow no secure evaluation because the inscriptions give the names of the dwarfs, but do not explain their exact activity.  Later periods  In later periods, such as the Middle Kingdom (c. 2055-1710 BC) and the New Kingdom (c. 1550-1070 BC) the special respect shown to dwarfs seems to have lessened. Depictions of dwarfs from later periods show them in progressively more ridiculing ways. An Egyptian papyrus dating to the Ramesside era called \\"The wise doctrine of Amenemope, son of Kanakht\\" (papyrus B.M. 10474) includes appeals to not treat dwarfs and other handicapped people (such as blind people, cripples and autists) badly or to backbite over them. Scholars and historians evaluate Amenemope's humane doctrines as a public appeal against upcoming moral decay within Egyptian society.  Dwarf deities  The dwarf deity Bes as depicted on a relief at Dendera In Ancient Egypt, peoples worshipped several dwarf deities, the most important of which was Bes. His cult is archaeologically attested since the 12th Dynasty (c. 1991-1802 BC). The cult is thought to have originated in Nubia, modern day Sudan. Bes was the god of dreams, luck, dancing, and he was the protector of the household and its belongings. He was also a god of birth and was worshipped in birth houses alongside the goddess Heqet. Bes is always depicted with a normal torso and head, shortened legs and arms and with the ears of a lion. His most unmistakable feature is his frontal depiction, rather rare in Ancient Egypt, making Bes particularly recognizable (and probably pointing to a foreign origin for his cult). A further deity with nanism, but rarely depicted, was Ptah-Pahtaka (\\"Ptah, the strong\\"). He was worshipped as a special form of Ptah, the god of art, crafts and creativity. Another form of Ptah that was also depicted as a dwarf was Ptah-segem-panem (\\"Ptah, the listener\\"). The deity Thoth, god of time, knowledge, mathematics and the moon, was sometimes depicted as a baboon with the head of a human. This could have been an allusion to dwarfs.  Egyptian dwarfs known by their names  Egyptian dwarfs which became known by their names thanks to their tomb stela, reliefs and/or statues include: Nefer, Ser-Inpw, Hedju (all three of 1st dynasty), Ny-ankh- Djedefre (4th dynasty) and Seneb (late 4th or early 5th dynasty).

The church is in the parish of St John's, Diocese of Guildford, which in turn is in the Province of Canterbury. The local village is named after the church. History In the early nineteenth century a settlement was beginning to form around the location of present-day St Johns, with the area home to a large brick-making and nursery industry. A reminder of the brick-making remains today in the form of a 'Kiln Bridge' over the Basingstoke Canal. The canal was also influential in the growth of the community. Due to the inconvenience of travelling to the nearest parish church (St Peter's in Old Woking), the vicar of St Peter's, Rev'd Charles Bowles, amassed ¬£1,500 in order to serve the western end of the parish of St Peter's, i.e. the new community now known as 'St Johns'.http://www.stjohnswoking.org.uk/content/church-history Sir George Gilbert Scott, the Victorian architect who found fame through constructions such as St Pancras railway station, was commissioned by Bowles to design a simple church for the local community. A lithograph of Gilbert's plans remains in St John's Church today. On 24 June 1842, the church was consecrated by the Bishop of Winchester. The church is of a Gothic Revival Style, built with stone similar to that used to build churches in the thirteenth- century.http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=42992 =Present day= St John's stands in the conservative evangelical tradition of the Church of England, and the parochial church council (PCC) have endorsed GAFCON's Jerusalem Declaration. Additions =Additions to the Church= St John's Church itself has had many additions to it since its consecration. The original simple church was without aisles. However, between 1879 and 1883 aisles and vestries were adding, doubling the size of the church. It was in 1884 that the church and surrounding area achieved parish status. In 1904, the pitch pine balcony that was in place was removed, due to lack of use. Furthermore, the original organ was built by Henry Bryceson. Moreover, the reredos, Holy Table and oak panelling were made in Exeter and were installed in 1915, followed by the installation of a choir vestry, which was added in the 1930s. The organs was rebuilt in 1948.http://www.npor.org.uk/NPORView.html?RI=K00769 The baptism pool in the chancel, oak font, communion table and lectern was added in the modernisation of the church in 2002. The church hall was built in 1956 and was refitted as a Youth Centre in 1992. This church hall was followed by a series of extensions in the 1970s, with a lounge, narthex and offices being added. These were not the final work to the church, however, and in 2002, the lighting and heating was improved and the flooring and seating replaced. Furthermore, the welcome area of the church has been enlarged, forcing the porch to be rebuilt to accommodate. =Additions as a result of the Church= In the vicinity of the church, a number of structures were constructed as a result of the church's presence, e.g. a vicarage. Built to serve the vicars of St Peter's, a vicarage was built nearby to the church under Rev'd Charles Bowles. The building remains, however it was replaced with the current newer built in 1952. Furthermore, the Bowles family once again contributed to the local community, through the construction of a local school. Used until the 1970s, it was used for Sunday school and youth school. Furthermore, it was also used as the local Scout hut. Features =Windows= There are many features in the church that are of note. Firstly, the stained glass, made in Munich, is dedicated to the memory of the Rev'd Charles Bowles. It depicts the Crucifixion, with Jesus blessing children and raising the son of the widow of Nain. Moreover, a window at the main entrance, installed in 1979, tells the stories of Psalm 1 and Revelation 1. The window is surrounded by the Holy Spirit with the wind blowing through it. There are numerous other memorials around the church, as well as several other stained glass windows. =Other= The communion rail has the name of former cricketer and Bishop of Liverpool, David Sheppard, engraved. Furthermore, a carved oak pulpit, gifted to the church in 1899, replaced the original This was given to Holy Trinity Church in the nearby village of Knaphill. The kneelers in the church were hand-made by members of the local community and congregation; the kneelers depict a variety of images, including local images, spiritual images and (for the larger ones), the Seven Days of Creation. An interesting note is that the mosaic tiles on the floor were made by women inmates of the former Woking Prison, who also contributed towards the making of some of the tiles in St Paul's Cathedral. Graveyard The earliest readable gravestone is from the Waterer family, who were involved in the local nursing business. The graveyard was extended to the South and the East in 1885. Furthermore, there are many gravestone that could be of note. The graveyard contains the Grave of Lt. Edgar Oliphant Anstey; Anstey, who was killed during the final stand of the 1st Battalion 24th Regiment in the Battle of Isandlwana, is believed to be the first South Australian to die in an overseas battlehttps://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:St_johns_grave.jpg. Moreover, there is also a gravestone with the unusual name of 'David Goliath'. The graveyard also contains a weeping beech. There are two vaults to the Bowles family in the grveyard. In 1913, a new graveyard was opened and contains the war memorial, with the motto 'dulce et decorum est pro patria mori', which roughly translates from Latin as 'it is sweet and fitting to die for one's country'. Both graveyards are now closed for burials, although ashes can still be placed in the Garden of Remembrance. This was paired in 1996 with a Wall of Remembrance to commemorate those placed in the Garden of Remembrance.

Plot Tae-kyu (Kim Kang-woo) is a former professional baseball player who currently coaches for a minor league team. His girlfriend Joo-young (Kim Hyo-jin) runs a successful urology clinic. They've broken up once before then gotten back together, and now they're about to get married. But a week before their wedding, Tae-kyu learns something about Joo-young that makes him feel betrayed and jealous. Growing increasingly neurotic, he becomes obsessed with finding all about her exes and dating past. Chef Won-chul (Ok Taecyeon) and nail artist So-mi (Lee Yeon-hee) have been a couple for seven years and their wedding day is fast approaching. But feeling that something is missing in their life, So-mi suspects that Won-chul doesn't feel passionate towards her anymore and merely regards their relationship as a comfortable living arrangement. Several days before getting hitched, So-mi travels to Jeju Island for a nail art competition, and there she meets and becomes attracted to Kyung-soo (Ju Ji-hoon), a tour guide and webcomic writer. Geon-ho (Ma Dong-seok) is a sweet, middle-aged bachelor who owns a flower shop, and he's about to marry Vika (Guzal Tursunova), who hails from Uzbekistan. When Geon-ho is suddenly afflicted with erectile dysfunction, he goes to see Joo-young, a urologist, who tells him that there's nothing wrong with him physically and his impotency may be caused by stress. Since Vika is beautiful and much younger than him, Geon-ho struggles with feelings of inadequacy and starts to wonder if she's only marrying him to attain Korean citizenship. Dae-bok (Lee Hee-joon) works at Joo-young's urology clinic. He's recently began dating Yi-ra (Go Joon-hee), a wedding planner. Then one day, during a baseball game, Yi-ra tells him that she's pregnant, and Dae-bok immediately proposes. But as they prepare for their wedding, they keep arguing constantly. It isn't that Dae-bok is scared of becoming a father, but he senses from Yi-ra's cynical attitude that she doesn't feel their relationship has any kind of long-term future, so he desperately tries to change her mind.

It is one of the first planned residential parks, and garden city communities, in the United States. It is located in the southern section of the city, bordered by Neptune Park on the west, Shore Road and Long Island Sound on the south, and Downtown New Rochelle on the north. History Residence Park is situated on the former country estate of the wealthy 19th century New York City hotelier Simeon Leland. Leland, having traveled extensively throughout Europe studying the various hotel systems there, returned with a knowledge and experience that knowledge back to experience effected important changes in American hotel-keeping. The firm Simeon Leland & Company soon grew from a small scale family business with his brothers to a large financial enterprise, with such trophy properties as the Metropolitan Hotel in Manhattan. Smart entrepreneurs capitalized on the need for large, well-staffed and capably managed hotels. The Lelands were partially responsible for initiating and improving this minor revolution in American hotel operation. The sons of the Leland brothers continued the family trade and built a nationwide reputation. Leland purchased 40 acres overlooking New Rochelle Harbor as the site for his country home, eventually commissioning the architect William Thomas Beers to design a gothic revival castle in 1855. Actual construction of ‚ÄúCastle View‚Äù did not begin until 1856, when Leland‚Äôs increasing success as proprietor of the Metropolitan enabled him to afford the enormous cost of building and decorating his mansion. The sixty room residence Castleview took three years to complete (1856 -1859). Leland apparently was also interested in building up New Rochelle‚Äôs resort trade, for in 1861 he purchased David‚Äôs Island in Echo Bay, intending to build a hotel there. However, the Civil War intervened, and he leased the island to the Union Army for use as a military hospital. After the war the Lelands sold David‚Äôs Island to the government; later it became Fort Slocum. The Castle was Leland‚Äôs vacation home until 1872, when his lease on the Metropolitan Hotel expired. At that time the hotel‚Äôs new owner gave its lease to ‚ÄúBoss‚Äù William A. Tweed. Leland then retired permanently to New Rochelle and died shortly thereafter on August 3, 1872. Upon his death, Leland was deep in debt. His Castle had reportedly cost $35,000 to erect and was at one time valued at over $100,000. Sometime before his death he was forced to mortgage the entire property, and he died before the mortgage could be paid. Leland supposedly had requested that his wife use his $35,000 insurance policy to settle the mortgage, but for some reason she failed to do so, and the mortgage was foreclosed. Although the Castle was then owned by the Manhattan Life Insurance Company, Mrs. Leland continued to live there until March 1880. (includes map) and Accompanying three photos, exterior and interior, from 1967, 1975, and 1970s In 1884, Adrian Iselin, Jr., the son of millionaire businessman Charles Oliver Iselin, bought Leland Castle, its 40 acres, and an adjacent farm with the purpose of developing the land into a residential park.Historical and Landmarks Review Board - City of New Rochelle \\"Application for Nomination as a Local Historic District\\" Planning The Garden City Movement arose in England during the 19th century as a reaction to the crowding and pollution of cities as a result of its Industrial Revolution.The Garden City Movement While the movement had spread to United States by the 1920s, early residential developers had begun experimenting with the 'Garden City' concept way before it gained the title, including Adrian G Iselin, who planned \\"Residence Park\\" in 1885. The neighborhood can be viewed as the grandfather to suburban living in the modern American city. Prior to its existence, residential settings were limited to either very rural or very urban design extremes. Lots were fronted by no more than a ditch or a dirt road when not immediately in the urban environment, and when in the city, there was little to no natural space except for public parks.The Residence Park: Defining the \\"American Dream\\", by Michael Borbely In Residence Park, specific attention to public spaces, natural settings and visual beauty helped distinguish it from most other suburban developments. When creating the community, Iselin paid considerable attention to the layout and measurements of streets, the parkways, sidewalks, lighting, greenways, parks, and the overall landscape plan of the community. One of his fundamental goals was to create a community that blended in with the natural topography, designed around large garden areas, landscaped islands and traffic medians, and winding streets.New Rochelle, Barbara Davis The community had a strict set of conditions, covenants and restrictions that set minimum property costs, controlled what was built and established property setbacks. The residential architecture reflects several distinct styles popular around the turn of the twentieth century such as Queen Anne Style, Colonial Revival and Tudor. The neighborhood is largely intact today as its layout has not been altered, the landscaping of the common areas has matured, and virtually all the original residences remain.Historical and Landmarks Review Board - City of New Rochelle \\"Application for Nomination as a Local Historic District\\" Landmarks, sites and attractions Several historically significant structures are located within the area including the former country home of the American patriot and Huguenot Lewis Pintard, a National Historic Landmark.

It belongs to the Sistema Verdes Mares, one of the main media conglomerates in the country, which also includes TV Verdes Mares, FM 93 and Verdes Mares radios and the newspaper Di√°rio do Nordeste. The station is known for producing entirely local programming focused on the customs of the Northeast Region of Brazil.  History  = Early years (1998-2000) = The station opened on 1 July (or June 30, according to other sources) 1998, broadcasting on channel 22 in Fortaleza. Little programming information survives, but the station showed programs that did not display TV Verdes Mares, because it was affiliated with Rede Globo, which allowed only the news space. The station showed exclusive programming to its 4 million person audience. Initially activities began at 8 am and ended at midnight. A few months later, the schedule added hours. The station showed connections with the Brazilian Northeast in its themes, colloquial language and vernacular. = Via satellite (2001-2009) = On March 20, 2001, the station went national via satellite. Its signal reached across Brazil via Brasilsat (later moving to StarOne C2). The signal carried throughout South America, parts of Central America and the Caribbean. In 2003 relay stations reached all territories except Cear√° and at the same time, earned its first affiliates. In 2004, esmissora was replaced by five affiliates. In 2005, the station covered the territory from Cear√°, thanks to \\"twin stations\\" with the same name, covering parts of the western states of Rio Grande do Norte and Para√≠ba, north-west and north east of Pernambuco and Piaui. Between 2005 and 2007, it added dozens of affiliates and relays in several Brazilian states in the Northeast, North, Midwest and Southeast, and became the country's fastest growing network. The network succeeded in its intention to make a network with a different language, not seen before in the history of Brazilian television. It concentrated on talk shows, local production and low cost, with different personalities and singers of forr√≥ and other popular rhythms. It won a large audience in Brazil.Cristiano Celestino Dourado Borges, , Observat√≥rio da Imprensa, 10 de mar√ßo de 2009 = Outage = At midnight on 25 February 2009, TV Di√°rio went dark without.

It is in the same class of melatonin receptor agonists as ramelteon and tasimelteon. History and development TIK-301 was first developed at Eli Lilly and Co in Indianapolis, IN as LY-156735. In 2002, it was licensed by Phase 2 Discovery for further commercialization and worldwide development as PD-6735. In July 2007, the open Investigational New Drug (IND) was transferred to Tikvah Therapeutics Inc. in Atlanta, GA by Phase II Discovery, where it was renamed to TIK-301. Currently, clinical trials are ongoing there. Because it has been traded and sublicensed by multiple companies, it can referred to by all three names. Mostly recently and commonly, it is referred to as TIK-301. TIK-301 was in phase II clinical trials in 2002. In 2004, TIK-301 was designated an orphan drug by the FDA. In 2005, TIK-301 was expected to go into phase III trials. Pharmacodynamics TIK-301 is a high affinity nonselective MT1/MT2 agonist. Studies show that it is more potent and more effective than melatonin. Its affinity for MT1 is similar to that of melatonin (pKi =10.38, Ki=81pM) and its affinity for MT2 is slightly higher (pKi=10.38, Ki= 42pM). This enantiomer had higher affinity for the binding site compared to the racemic mixture. The MT1/MT2 Ki ratio is 1.9. This slight preference for MT2 receptor is common among melatonin derivatives with chlorine. TIK-301's action on MT1 and MT2 receptors contributes to its sleep-promoting effects because melatonin's effects at these same receptors is linked with maintenance of normal-sleep wake cycle. TIK-301 was shown to be effective at promoting sleep at various doses; there is a positive dose response relationship between dose and reduction in sleep latency. The EC50 of TIK-301 is 0.0479nM, compared to 0.063nM for melatonin. It also acts as an antagonist at serotonin receptors 5-HT2B and 5-HT2C. Pharmacokinetics TIK-301 is administered orally. Compared to melatonin, it has nine times greater bioavailability and six times greater area under the curve (AUC), which means the body retains more of an administered dose. TIK-301 was detected in blood plasma within 10 to 15 minutes of administration of a single oral dose and remains in a patient's system until 12 hours after the single dose. Plasma concentrations increased rapidly and peaked at 1 hour after the dose, independent of dose size. TIK-301's half-life is about 1 hour. This extended half-life may be partially due to the chlorine in its structure. Elimination constants depended on dose, 20 mg dose had a different elimination constant from all other doses above 35 mg. Treatment TIK-301 is intended to be a take-as-need drug for primary insomnia, circadian rhythm disorders, depression, as well as sleep disorders in blind individuals and can be used to alleviate neuroleptic-induced tardive dyskinesia in schizophrenia patients. In a phase I clinical trial, TIK-301 was shown to be effective as a chronobiotic at a dose of 5 mg/L, but not in lower doses. In a phase II trial for primary insomnia, patients experienced objective and subjective improvements in sleep latency at 20 mg (31% improvement), 50 mg (32%) and 100 mg (41%) doses. The sleep latency improvement at the 100 mg dose is comparable to FDA approved zolpidem's effects. Surprisingly, it showed no such effects in healthy patients when taken before bed. In a test of phase shifted circadian cycle, TIK-301 showed efficacy in readjusting phase shifts in all physiological systems. While it has been shown to be effective in phase shifting circadian rhythm and reduced sleep latency, it has not been shown to help sleep maintenance, even at doses of 20 mg or 200 mg. In addition to a sleep aid, TIK-301 has been found useful in treating other disorders. Because of its affinity for serotonin receptors, it has potential to serve as a possible antidepressant drug, similar to agomelatine. TIK-301 has also been considered for use in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) because of sleep disorder prevalence. TIK-301, as well as other melatonin agonists, has been reported to have potential in preventing or treating urinary incontinence, but have not been tested in humans for this purpose. It is also seen as a potential therapeutic agent for spinal cord injury (SCI); in low doses (10 mg/kg) it was seen to be benefit in rats after SCI, but in higher doses (100 mg/kg), it proved toxic. Side effects There were no major and serious side effects in phase I trials, and mild side effects such as diarrhea, conjunctivitis and laryngitis were observed in few cases. Unlike benzodiazepines sleep medications, TIK-301's novel mode of action at melatonin receptors reduce many common side effects of sleep medications like dependency. In addition, TIK-301 had no latent, morning after psychomotor impairments. A few patients reported cases of somnolence in clinical trials, which is consistent with the drug's soporific effects. Because of its receptor specific action, there are no associated changes in core body temperatures, heart rate or blood pressure as with other melatonin medications.

Biography O'Leary was born in Tralee, County Kerry, both his father (also named Arthur) and uncle Daniel having been talented musicians, too. Arthur Senior was said to be first cousin to Arthur Sullivan's grandfather in an obituary for O'Leary written by W. H. Grattan Flood.Musical Times, vol. LX (1919),p. 235. When young Arthur's talents were discovered at the age of ten, a visiting barrister, Wyndham Goold became his patron: in May 1844 he sent him to school in Dublin and secured private piano tuition. With financial backing from others, including John Stanford (father of Charles Villiers Stanford), and with letters of introduction from William Sterndale Bennett, O'Leary was able to study at the conservatory in Leipzig, where he arrived in 1847 to study piano (with Ignaz Moscheles), organ, violin, and harmony (with Julius Rietz). During this time he was invited several times to musical dinners where he met, besides Moscheles, Felix Mendelssohn-Bartholdy and Joseph Joachim.Fitzsimons (2008), p. 56; see Bibliography. He also attended Mendelssohn's funeral in 1847. Between February 1852 and December 1854 O'Leary studied the piano with Cipriani Potter and Sterndale Bennett at the Royal Academy of Music (RAM), London. He became an assistant professor at the RAM in 1856 and elected a fellow in 1864, teaching piano and composition. Among his more notable pupils were Alicia Adelaide Needham, Charles Villiers Stanford, and Arthur Sullivan. He also had other teaching positions in London at institutions including the National Training School for Music (from 1876), the Guildhall School (1880‚Äì1900), the Crystal Palace School of Science and Art (from 1886), and the Beckenham School of Music (from 1894). He resigned from the RAM and other positions in 1903. He was elected a member of the Philharmonic Society in 1875. O'Leary had married Rosetta Vinning on 5 November 1860 and they had two daughters, Catherine Wyndham and Annette Elizabeth. Annette married Harry Pye, son of Kellow Pye in 1897. Arthur and Rosetta both died in London (Rosetta in 1909), and they are buried in Aghadoe cemetery near Killarney, Ireland. Annette and Harry Pye had one son, Edmund Arthur Pye, born in 1902. He was educated at Epsom College and studied Medicine at Cambridge and St. George's Hospital, London. He married Dorothy Neville in London in 1928, separating after three years, having had one son. Edmund Arthur Pye left his medical career behind after the second world war when, along with his second wife Anne Welsh, he embarked on his better-known career as yachtsman and writer, using the name Peter Pye. His son Patrick Pye was raised in Dublin by his mother and became an artist. Selected compositions Arthur O'Leary's largest work is a symphony performed in London in 1853 and 1864. Although he wrote a number of other orchestral pieces, his main work consists of piano music and songs. Raymond Deane commented: \\"At the very least, he was a superior drawing-room composer who occasionally touched deeper chords.\\"See http://journalofmusic.com/focus/lament-arthur-oleary The following list is based on Fitzsimons (2008), p. 132‚Äì6 (see Bibliography below).

The creation of the association appears to have taken place in New York in 1961. During the 1960s, there was a steady demand for young British women to come to the U.S. and fill temporary or permanent secretarial positions. Reasons stated for the demand included a secretarial shortage in the U.S., better aptitude and seriousness for detail work among the British, and the perceived prestige in the U.S. of having an English accent answer the phone. For the British women who came over, there was a chance for better pay and advancement in the U.S. than within the British class system. The association's stated purpose was that it \\"offers assistance to members seeking jobs and apartments, and generally helps girls new to this country to settle in New York.\\" It also helped members navigate the New York social and dating scene, and the association threw parties of their own as well. The association is remembered for one unusual recorded vocal chorus effort, when they performed IBM corporate spirit songs on the 1969 album Paean. Also The album was the idea of the computer software and consulting company Advanced Computer Techniques, all of whose secretaries at the time came from England. The album's songs and recordings were judged as \\"quite endearing\\" by InfoWorld magazine some years later, and software design pioneer Larry Constantine subsequently described the association's role on the record with just one word: \\"indeed!\\" By 1971, the association had about 80 members. At meetings they discussed, or heard from speakers on, topics such as safety, cultural trips, vacations, and techniques for shorthand. A similar organization at the time was the Society of International Secretaries.

It was designed and developed by a team of seven students of various nationalities. Subtitled \\"Can I touch your Wiimote?\\", it is presented as a sex game without graphics. The game runs on a fully black screen, and the gameplay is based solely on sound information and haptics. A player needs to find a rhythm with his partner, and gradually accelerate to a target frequency, representing the orgasm. The game is playable with a keyboard or the Wiimote, and supports up to four players. Dark Room Sex Game was developed by students at the IT University of Copenhagen for the Nordic Game Jam. It was a competition of developing a game in a weekend, with the theme \\"Taboo.\\" The basic idea of the team is that \\"a play on the most erotic sex would be so devoid of any visual, forcing players to use their imagination\\". The game received positive reviews from the press, saying that the judge was \\"very fun.\\" It is considered an interesting title for the evolution of video games, because of its unique approach to sex in the gameplay. It won several awards, including the IndieCade 2008. Part of the team went on to create the indie game studio KnapNok Games, with Douglas Wilson forming his own studio Die Gute Fabrik.  Gameplay  Dark Room Sex Game is a rhythm-oriented party game about sex, completely devoid of graphics as it runs on a fully black screen. The game's menu consists entirely of sound: a voice gives information about the game and sets out the possible choices, with selections made via a keyboard. Three game modes are possible for one, two or four players. Six different voices are programmed into the game, but it is possible to define new ones. In each game, a voice is assigned randomly to each player. It is therefore possible to have a party with the voices of people of the same sex.Dark Room Sex Game Readme file, July 23, 2008 The goal of the game is to find a rhythm with the other player, and accelerate gradually until reaching orgasm. Players using the keyboard must press the keys on the numeric keypad, while those using a Wiimote must shake the controller following the rhythm. In the absence of graphics, players can only base their actions on the audio cues, in the form of lustful moans, and if necessary on the vibrations of the Wiimote. The game is divided into three distinct phases of the game. First is the phase known as \\"warm-up\\" match preliminaries. The second and third phases are more intense. Each voice has for each phase of the game five \\"positive\\" sounds, used when the rhythm is good; and the \\"negative\\" ones for when the rate is too high. There are also three orgasm sounds for each one of the voices available.  Development  Dark Room Sex Game was developed during the 2008 edition of Nordic Game Jam, an open competition where participants develop and produce a video game in the space of 48 hours. It was held from 1 to 3 February 2008 at the IT University of Copenhagen in Denmark, and attracted 150 participants. This edition's theme around which games were meant to be developed was \\"Taboo\\", with several other minor constraints imposed: the game had to be playable with a controller, support multiplayer and have a core game loop with a victory and a high score. The original game idea by Lau Korsgaard was to perform an erotic game devoid of graphics. He shared this vision with game developer Douglas Wilson and five other students who joined the project: Dajana Dimovska, Kennett Wong, Lars Bojsen-M√∏ller, Mads Lyngvig and Robin Di Capua. The game was originally intended to be played with a keyboard only, but the team was later inspired by the phallic shape and vibration features of the Wiimote. The team decided that this controller allowed to get a \\"dynamic of people looking at each other, not the screen, and also a certain about of physicality\\". However, the team does not consider that the Wii version is \\"better\\" than the other. The keyboard version forces players to be pressed close to each other, making this version more provocative in some aspects. The game was developed in Java, under the development environment Eclipse. The sound aspect operates on the software library FMOD. Interfacing with the Wiimote was the most difficult technical development. The connection with the Wiimote interface is made with a homebrew called \\"WiiRemoteJ API.\\" The Bluetooth connection is managed by a free library.

It is an independent academically accredited institution. The campus moved to its new premises in Netanya, Israel in 2010, and has several hundred students in its programs. Israel College of the Bible hosts a large Messianic library. The College has been accused by anti-missionary groups as being at the \\"forefront of missionary activity in Israel\\".Israel Now, Netanya local news site, 27 June 2012.  Description  Israel College of the Bible (ICB) was founded in 1990 and provides theological and practical training at a Bible school inside the country for Israelis who would previously have had to travel abroad for equivalent courses. It provides theological training for both Israelis and foreign students, and it provides ministry training and leadership development for followers of Jesus. The emphasis and the majority of programs are focused on training Israelis, both Jewish and Arab, but a Year in Israel Program is available to international students, and distance learning courses are available online in English. The college is accredited through the European Evangelical Accrediting Association and the Asia Theological Association, although Israel's Ministry of Education does not recognise its degrees. Israel College of the Bible celebrates the Jewish holidays and keeps an emphasis in the curriculum on their Jewish heritage, but claims to be \\"very inclusive, and live very harmoniously with our Arab brothers and sisters and our Gentile brothers and sisters\\". The \\"Linga\\" organisation of Arab Christians in Israel has also affirmed this connection and has celebrated the graduation of several Arab students who had gained their qualifications from the ICB. The primary language of the college is Hebrew, with some courses also taught in Russian and English. The teaching staff are all Israeli, including both Jewish and Arab, and the students also come from different ethnic and cultural backgrounds from within Israel. Additionally there are international students each year from countries around the world.  Academic scope  Israel College of the Bible faculty expertise is primarily in the areas of Bible and Theology, Jewish studies, Biblical Geography and Culture, Archaeology, Practical Ministry, and Leadership and Counseling. The college offers an international Bachelor of Theology, a Hebrew Bachelor of Theology, a \\"Year in Israel Program\\", a Bikurim program, a Bachelor of Arts degree and Master of Arts counselling. Semester credits can be applied to a certificate in Messianic Studies.

Additionally, ICB Tours has been developed to provide study tours for Christians wanting to visit Israel in the context of academic Bible study. Tours are led by \\"professional, Messianic guides\\". The college partners with local authorities in distributing food to the poor and elderly in the city.  Criticism  Messianic Judaism is typically seen negatively, and even as a threat, within Israel. The leading anti-missionary organisation, Yad L'Achim, declared the college to be at the \\"forefront of missionary activity in Israel\\".Israel Now, Netanya local news site, 27 June 2012. Rabbi Tzvi Wilhelm, rabbi of the Chabad synagogue north of Netanya, objected to teaching about Jesus, who broke away from many Jewish traditions and rabbinic law, terming the subject matter \\"idolatry\\". Rabbi Irwin Birnbaum, a former Conservative rabbi in Netanya, considers the activities of followers of Jesus in Israel to be \\"worse than the Holocaust\\", and that they are set on destroying Israel.

The Antioquia Railway () is a historic railway system in Colombia of freight and passenger trains that joined much of the central regions of the Antioquia department along the Magdalena river, and ultimately extended to provinces located south of the department, including Caldas and the Valle del Cauca. It took 55 years to build: from 1874 to its opening on 7 August 1929. The Antioquia Railway was for decades an important link among regions that had previously been isolated and was a large contributor to economic development in the region. With the construction of alternative forms of transportation, especially roads, the use of the train declined in the 20th century. The railway was officially sold in 1961. The railway was owned and operated by the department of Antioquia. Its purpose was to link Medell√≠n, the commercial center of the department, with the river port Puerto Berr√≠o, located by the Magdalena river. Prior to the railway, Antioquia was a region known only for its gold mining. After the region became more interconnected, there was a boom in almost all areas of the economy, including livestock and agriculture in the Nus region, textiles in the Medell√≠n valley, and coffee production in the whole department. The historic Medell√≠n station of the railway still exists in Plaza Cisneros. It is a neoclassical building designed by Enrique Olarte. The private, non-profit organization \\"Antioquia Railway Foundation\\" was started on 26 July 1986. Early history Plaque outside the La Quebrada Tunnel. It reads, \\"Constructed under the administration of Gov. Pedro Justo Berr√≠o. In the nineteenth century, Antioquia was then a sovereign state with six departments and its capital in Medell√≠n when the plans began for a railway. The government started to consider building a railway along the Magdalena river starting in 1864. The Magdalena river was then an important hub for import and export of goods. In 1874 the official construction contract was signed. Cuban engineer Francisco Javier Cisnero was hired to finish the construction of the railway in eight years. The biggest challenge for the railway construction was that Antioquia was geographically too steep, and the construction of railways in such difficult territory represented a huge undertaking for the technology of the late nineteenth century. The plan was for a railway bordering the river to start in Puerto Berr√≠o and end in the Barbosa district. The first track was built in October 1875. The railroad was completed before the global economic crisis of 1929, which closed capital markets and foreign credit to works such as this one (see Colombian economy and politics 1929‚Äì58). This was one of the last public works that the country was able to finance by going to international capital markets in the twenties. It was therefore providential to have managed to finish the railroad in those days, because a further delay would probably have meant a delay of twenty or thirty years in its completion. The novel transport system eased the work required to move the crops, since the trade began to be made much more quickly and at substantially lower costs. The railway initially spanned 58 kilometers, and then was expanded to 91 kilometers in length. By the end of its expansion, there were two main lines: the \\"Nus division\\" spanning 118 kilometers from Puerto Berr√≠o to El L√≠mon and the \\"Porce division\\" spanning 72 kilometers from Santiago to Medell√≠n. Between El L√≠mon and Santiago there was a geographical depression known as \\"The Break\\" (). =Early obstacles= There were many obstacles to getting the railroad into operation. The idea of a railroad was not readily accepted by the public. Replacing the mules and mule drivers for an unfamiliar steel machine was difficult for many people, because the new technology would undoubtedly involve unknown risks. The skepticism was not unwarranted. For example, the Number One Locomotive serving Medell√≠n was actually Number Two because the first one disappeared off the map after having fallen down an abyss. To avoid panic, the company painted the number \\"1\\" on the Number Two Locomotive, and this story was not communicated to the public until a hundred years later. =Thousand Days' War= The Thousand Days' War hurt the country and consequently the national railways, which had been developed simultaneously with Antioquia. Indeed, during this time the rail service in the country was suspended for three years, and because of the war they were destroyed, restored and then demolished, repeatedly over many seasons. However, Antioquia, given its isolation from the rest of the country, was relatively peaceful during this period of war. And as a result, this area rebounded more quickly than the rest of the country after the war. Postwar decline In 1903 Panama seceded from Colombia, and Colombia was compensated financially on 7 August 1922. The Central Bank was built from part of this money, but most of these funds were used to restore the railways since the time of the presidency of Rafael Reyes. However, the government gave priority to the construction of roads, especially since 1930. Since that time, investment in rail transport decreased by almost 90%. In 1934, difficulties in the Antioquia Railway started with the first railroad union strike, which had 63 petitions. In 1947, came a second strike. Roads, initially built to support the train, slowly began to pose a threat to its survival. =Competition by roads= The railroad begins to face strong competition from other transport modes. The preponderance of roads between 1930 and 1950 generated strong competition among transport modes and a price war. The purchase by the Antioquia Railway in 1951 of two Austrian Diesel locomotives, which then it had to sell to the National Railways in 1956 created a debt of USD $26,580, which jeopardized the financial stability of the company. Another thrust that killed the train was the construction of the Puerto Berrio-Medellin pipeline, because oil was previously transported by train. End of the railway and beginning of IDEA Medell√≠n Metro alongside old trains belonging to the Antioquia Railway Finally, the existence of the Antioquia Railway Company ended in 1961. By ordinance of 15 August 1961, Colombia approved the sale of the Antioquia Railway to the National Railway Company. The money from this sale, fortunately, led to the birth of the Institute for the Development of Antioquia, which was born by Order No. 13 of 28 August 1964; their initial capital monies were selling the Antioquia Railway to the nation. Two years after the completion of the sale, the fate of these resources was a matter of debate for the Departmental Government, headed by Dr. Mario Restrepo Aramburo who, with other illustrious characters like Peter Santamaria Antioquia, Uribe Restrepo and Jorge Luis L√≥pez de Mesa pushed for the initiative to establish the Institute for the Development of Antioquia ( [IDEA]). The entity has become a bastion of achievement for the department and much of the country. The IDEA is now architect of ambitious and gigantic development projects in Antioquia. =Aftermath= After the Antioquia Railway, the national railway company also began to decline. In 1988, by Act 21 there was the creation of the Empresa Colombiana de Ferrocarriles in order to upgrade and maintain roads and Societies Rail Transport (STF), which existed until 1999 and were in charge of managing the commercial train service; and finally the Social Fund liabilities National Railways which handled the pensions, benefits and allowances of workers. To this day, most of the country does not have a railway system. Indeed, Colombia has a large network of 3,600 kilometers of railways with only a few functional kilometers belonging to the coal mines of El Cerrej√≥n; the tourist train or railway Savannah Savannah, Turistren, which makes its way from Bogota to Zipaquir√° with just 52 km travel and ranging to the Jaime Duque (Brice√±o) park in Caro; the railroad Bogota - Peace River (Boyac√°), which corresponds to the Northeast Railway line by the national government to use cargo Pacific Railroad between Cali and Buenaventura; among others. Example of the effect of railway transportation As an example of the effect of the railway, transporting a piano overland from Nare to Medell√≠n lasted about 20 days and cost 265 gold pesos, while travel on rail lasted only one day and the cost was 8.4 gold pesos. In this regard indicates Gabriel Poveda: \\"Based on information in Antioquia and other parts of the country, PW Mac Greevy has calculated that the average freight bridle paths of Colombia in the period 1845-1880 was 41.6 cents per ton/kilometer. With the use of railways, the projected costs would be approximately 65% lower.Gabriel Poveda Ramos, Historia econ√≥mica de Antioquia, Biblioteca Luis √Ångel Arango Gallery File:Medellin - Estaci√≥n del Ferrocarril de Antioquia 5.jpgA preserved steam locomotive at the Medell√≠n station File:Estaci√≥n yl abandono.jpgThe abandoned remains from the Bello station File:Estaci√≥n del Ferrocarril Envigado.

Olesya, the most acclaimed piece of his Polesye cycle, did much to build Kuprin's literary reputation and warranted his move to Saint Petersburg.Pitlyar, I. Notes and commentaries. The Works of A.I.Kuprin in 9 volumes. Pravda Publishers. The Ogonyok Library. Moscow, 1964. Vol.2, pp. 479-494 According to the Kuprin scholar Nicholas Luker, \\"Olesya is the most charming of Kuprin's rural tales. Though meant at first to be only part of the Volhynia and Polesye cycle, this poetic story of the love between an urban intellectual and a beautiful country girl expanded into a full novelette of a significance far surpassing that of the other regional tales.\\" The story was one of Kuprin's favorites. Referring once to both Olesya and his later work \\"The River of Life,\\" he said: \\"There is life in it and freshness and... more of my soul than in my other tales.\\"Kiselyov, B.M. Speaking of Kuprin // Rasskazy –æ Kuprine. Moscow, 1964, p. 175. Background In 1897 Kuprin went first to Volhynia Province in the northwest Ukraine, where he worked as an estate manager, and then to the Polesye area in southern Belarus. In the winter of 1897-1898 he moved to Ryazan Province, where Olesya was written. Kuprin considered several months spent in Volhynia and Polesye to be most beneficial of his life. \\"There I absorbed my most vigorous, noble, extensive, and fruitful impressions... and came to know the Russian language and landscape,\\" he remembered. The story is autobiographical. \\"All this has happened to me,\\" Kuprin wrote mysteriously toward the end of his life.Afanasyev, V.N. Aleksandr Ivanovich Kuprin. Moscow, 1960, p. 43 History  Olesya was first published in Kiyevlyanin newspaper (Nos. 300, 301, 304, 305-308, 313-315, 318) in late 1898 (October 30 - November 17). This original version of the work, subtitled \\"From the Memories of Volhynia,\\" came out with an introduction alleging that this was the story told to the author by an Ivan Timofeevich Poroshin, now an old man, as he recalled his youthful love for the \\"real Polesye sorceress\\" Olesya. In 1905 the novel came out as a separate edition, published by M.O. Wolf's Publishing house in Saint Peterburg, as part of the Library of Russian and Foreign Authors series (Issues 18 and 19). For it Kuprin removed the introduction, but otherwise this second version bore no difference from the original one. In 1908, Olesya was included into the first edition of The Works by A.I.Kuprin which came out in the Moscow Book Publishers. Here Kuprin removed footnotes explaining details of the local dialect and changed several foreign words for their Russian analogues. Of the several minor additions one is of note: to Yarmola's words describing Manuylikha (Olesya's grandmother) \\"... But she was an outsider, anyway, from Katsaps\\" - \\"...or perhaps Gypsies,\\" was added. =Controversy= Published in Russkoye Bogatstvo (No 9, September 1898), \\"The Backwoods\\" was intended as the first work in the cycle, to be followed by Olesya. But the latter was not accepted by the journal, and Kuprin was obliged to place it elsewhere, finally serializing it in Kievlyanin 1898. (\\"The Werewolf\\" was published in Odesskie Novosti in 1901, this delay leaving the whole cycle incomplete.) The reason why Olesya was rejected by Russkoye Bogatstvo has never been explained. \\"It could be surmised that the magazine leaders disagreed with the way the peasants' mob (which tried to lynch Olesya) was portrayed there. Depicting the rural people as an ignorant, aggressive and cruel mob totally contradicted the Narodnik ideas which Russkoye Bogatstvo was at the time propagating,\\" biographer I.Pitlyar suggested. Summary Ivan Timofeevich seeks restorative peace in Polesye, but gets only intolerable boredom, from which the prospect of meeting a real witch offers a welcome diversion. Once, having lost his way in the woods, he hits upon a hut where abide an old woman and her granddaughter, hated and feared in the village for alleged sorcery. The narrator, who is deeply intrigued and touched by the girl's natural beauty, intelligence, insight and indeed some uncanny talents, becomes a frequent visitor, much for the displeasure of the old woman. Ivan and Olesya become close friends, then lovers, sharing deep and passionate mutual affection, doomed from the start - as Olesya's cards had foretold her. Both women live in constant fear of repression from the local authorities (their little house has been granted to them by a former landlord and now is to be retrieved by the new one) and aggression from the locals. Ivan manages to bribe a local policemen into leaving them alone for a while, but inadvertently himself causes great trouble. Before the parting which proves to be imminent (Ivan proposes, but the girl declines), Olesya, just to please her lover suggests that she'd go to the church - something she avoided all her life (\\"for it's for Him that our souls belong\\"). Ivan concedes that such a forfeit would indeed give him some satisfaction. After the service Olesya gets mobbed and beaten by the locals. Tearing off, she issues some threats. Next day hail falls and destroys the harvest. Horrified with the news brought by his servant, Ivan hurries to the forest hut only to see it abandoned, with just cheap red beads left to him hanging on a window as a memory token. Characters * Ivan Timofeyevich, \\"a shadowy but attractive figure whose ready irony at his own expense endears him to us,\\" \\"a noble- hearted but weak- willed urban animal whose hesitant nature contrasts sharply with the bold decisiveness of Olesya's rural temperament.\\" (Luker) Olesya the fortuneteller characterizes him neatly: \\"...though you're a good man, you're weak ... not a man of your word.\\" * Yarmola, Ivan's drunkard servant and hunting companion. * Manuylikha, Olesya's grandmother who'd been driven from the village as a witch. \\"Almost a Baba Yaga figure - the traditional witch of Russian fairy tales\\" - she proves to be an intelligent, although rather unpleasant woman. * Olesya. A girl brought up in the remote forests, untouched by civilization. An \\"idealized, romantic creation, the archetypal daughter of nature, as beautiful and free as the virgin forests to which she belongs\\" (Luker). Delightfully attractive as she is, Olesya is a mysterious creature acutely sensitive to the ever-changing moods of the forest around her. Her oneness with the wild beauty of nature lends her supernatural powers that Timofeyevich finds disturbing and sinister. She possesses the gifts of prophecy and hypnosis, and can unerringly foretell death. \\"Framed by the quietly evocative beauty of Polesye, his miraculous heroine stands out in brilliant relief against the somber hostility around her.\\" (Luker)  References  Category:Novels by Aleksandr Kuprin Category:1898 novels ","title":"Olesya (Kuprin novel)"},{"id":"43713104","text":"East London Business Alliance (ELBA) is a British business-community outreach charity promoting corporate social responsibility (CSR) and employee volunteering.

It was built in the latter part of the 15th century and the early part of the 16th century.Decies Journal No. 60. The work at Double Tower, Waterford. Ben Murtagh.p.1-17 Six of the original 17 towers survive to this day; the other five being Reginald's Tower, Beach Tower, Semi- Lunar Tower, French Tower, and Watch Tower (Waterford). The Double Tower is located on Castle Street, between the French Tower and the Watch Tower. All three towers are well-preserved, along with some parts of the old city wall between them.  Layout  The name Double Tower probably originates from the fact that there are two chambers inside it. One chamber contains a passageway which leads to the Benedictine Priory; the other, bigger chamber used to contain a flight of stairs leading to the upper floors and battlements. The Benedictine Priory was the priory of St. John and was owned by the Benedictine priory of St. Peter and Paul of Bath in England. Along with the citizens of Waterford, this priory funded the construction of the towers and walls in this part of the city. The Double Tower is oblong in plan, measuring 7m in length in the northwest-southeast direction, and 4.5m in width. Its height is 10.5m. It looks like mini-tower house, joined at either end by the city wall. However, habitation was not the primary function of this building. The city wall at either end abuts onto the exterior of the tower. This indicates that the tower was built earlier, and was originally a freestanding structure. During the Cromwellian siege of 1649, this tower and sections of the city wall were pounded with cannon fire. The tower was not built for this type of defence, so it required bolstering by half-filling with earth to take the impact of the cannon.Eamon McEneaney, Discover Waterford, (O'Brien Press), 2001, p.99  City wall  Parts of the parapet in the section of the city wall to the southeast of the tower have survived to this day. However, at the northwest end, the original stepped crenellations can still be seen rising upwards to abut onto the tower. This feature is a rare survival on the Waterford city wall. The remains of an overhanging wall walk can still be seen running along the inside of the wall between the Double Tower and the Watch Tower. However, the battlement does not survive along the top of the city wall to the northwest of the Double Tower. The Double Tower was built as a freestanding structure on the remains of an earlier gateway. The two adjoining sections of the city wall at either end were built later. It is likely that the section of the wall to the northwest that runs downhill from the French Tower was built first, and then the wall running southeast that goes to the Watch Tower. All three towers are visible from Castle Street.

Microinfarcts may be the second most important cause of dementia, after Alzheimer's disease.Microinfarcts ‚Äì Small Size, Big Impact . Hotchkiss Brain Institute. Retrieved September 1, 2014 Microinfarcts are microscopic lesions, of cellular death or tissue necrosis, which are a result of pathologies involving small vessels.

Microinfarcts take longer to affect neuronal death progress, at up to 28 days, rather than hours.Wang M, Iliff JJ, Liao Y, Chen MJ, Shinseki MS, Venkataraman A, Cheung J, Wang W, Nedergaard M. Cognitive deficits and delayed neuronal loss in a mouse model of multiple microinfarcts. J NeurosciPubMed. Microinfarcts can range in size from 0.2 to 2.9 mm. This ailment usually goes undetected in clinical-radiological, like structural MRI, studies and is known as a ‚Äúsilent pathology‚Äù. Depending on the size, large acute microinfarcts may be detected via a special imaging technique known as diffusion weighted imaging. Microinfarcts tend to occur at a high frequency, without specific regionalized locations. They are common in aging brains. This high frequency is thought to directly disrupt cognitive networks that are imperative to brain operation. Even though microinfarcts are usually undetectable, there is a general assessment of the cognitive status measured on a scale called the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR). Performance on this scale is associated with integrity of white matter, periventricular myelination, and cortical microinfarcts. Assessments of cortical microinfarcts have had the highest rates with being associated with cognitive degeneration.K√∂vari, Enik√∂, MD, Gabriel Gold, MD, Fran√ßois R. Herrmann, MD, MPH, Alessandra Canuto, MD, Patrick R.

Ahajournals.org Web. 20 Mar. 2016. This lower cognition specifically affects perceptual speed and memory (semantic and episodic). People with high frequency of this ailment tend to have greater chances of developing dementia.

ISA is dedicated to achieving a more sustainable built environment through the better measurement, benchmarking and understanding of building performance. Purpose With 40% of carbon emissions coming from the built environment, real estate owners, occupiers, developers and funders around the world are facing ever increasing demands concerning the need for greater sustainability in the use of existing buildings. ISA is a response to the growing legislative and economic pressure across the world to address building sustainability. It helps members to develop a common understanding of how their buildings perform, what measures can be taken to improve them and what this means in terms of value and return on their investment. ISA has a database of commercial building assets comprising information gathered from members with retail, office and other commercial buildings in more than 50 countries. The diversity and breadth of data acquired from members ‚Äì and in turn available to them ‚Äì provides a unique resource on which to base decisions on investing in their buildings. A key purpose of ISA is the provision of robust benchmarking services based on a very extensive and detailed body of data. ISA also promotes research on sustainability in the built environment. Activities Production of an Annual Report for each Founding and General Member, containing an assessment of the property data placed in the ISA database by members, which can help them to reduce CO2 emissions, preserve water resources and make well informed investment decisions. KPI Benchmarking ‚Äì the Annual Report contains an analysis of current ISA key performance indicators (KPIs), which include energy, CO2, waste and water ‚Äì at site, building and asset level ‚Äì by country and sector. This enables members to benchmark their property portfolio within their organisation and against other companies that have provided data. Reporting ‚Äì the KPIs are aligned to the Global Reporting Index Commercial Real Estate Sustainability Supplement (GRI CRESS) and the European Public Real Estate Association (EPRA) standards. This enables ISA members to incorporate their results into both their Annual Reports and Corporate Social Responsibility reports in a standardised way. Certification ‚Äì ISA provides a gateway for access to certification of the environmental performance of buildings in use through schemes such as BREEAM In-Use. Research ‚Äì ISA promotes scientifically based research into sustainability in the built environment for the benefit of members and the wider community. Organisation ISA is hosted by BRE Global Limited. The day-to-day running of the organisation is coordinated by BRE with Task Teams, drawn from the Membership, established to carry out specific activities as and when required. Current members include some of the largest corporations, developers, property owners and investors with worldwide interests.

Mildred was invited to get this equipment running but he demurred, and it lay idle for some time. Shortly after arrival on Kangaroo Island, Mildred, T. H. Beare and William Giles imported a batch of Merino ewes from Van Diemens Land, some of the first brought into the colony, though stock losses on the unusually long trip aboard the were considerable. The land he selected, on Fourth Creek, and where he lived for the rest of his life, turned out to be quite valuable, and made his fortune. Politics He served on the Adelaide Municipal Council from 1841 to 1843. He was one of the colonists who strenuously opposed bringing out boys from the Parkhurst prison. He contested the election for the Legislative Council seat of Burra without success, but in 1850 was appointed to the Main Roads Commission and later that year appointed Justice of the Peace, and in 1858 made a Special Magistrate. In 1851 sat for, but failed to win, one of the first elected positions on the Legislative Council. He represented Noarlunga in the first House of Assembly from 1857 to 1860, East Torrens from 1860 to 1865, and held a seat in the Legislative Council from 1866 to 1871.

She was an active member of the Communist Party of Great Britain between 1920 and 1933, and spent three periods in prison as a result of her agitation. She attended John Maclean's last meetings at the Scottish Labour College. She is remembered today as a prominent figure in Dundee's labour movement. She founded the Working Women Guild to fight for better health and social services in Dundee, securing a membership of over 300, and was heavily involved in October 1934 with the National Unemployed Workers Movement county march to Forfar, to lobby the County Council; contingents were raised from Dundee, Blairgowrie, Montrose, Ferryden, and Arbroath. More information about Mary Brooksbank can be found in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography  Early life  Mary Brooksbank was born in an Aberdeen slum, the oldest of either five or ten children, and came to Dundee when she was eight or nine years old. She began working illegally in Dundee's jute mills as a bobbin shifter by the age of 12, and had her first experience of trade unionism at the age of 14, when the girls at her jute mill successfully marched for a 15% pay rise. Mary's father, Sandy Soutar (who died in 1953, aged 86), was from St Vigeans, Arbroath, near Dundee, and had been an active trade unionist amongst the dock workers, working with James Connolly. Her mother, Rose Ann Soutar n√©e Gillan was a fisher lassie and domestic servant. It is said that the Soutar family was \\"effectively blacklisted in Dundee because of their trade union activities\\".  Political life  At 21, Mary Brooksbank rejected Roman Catholicism, became an atheist and was inspired by John McLean to join the Communist Party to fight for women's rights, equality, and the demise of capitalism. She is famously quoted as saying: > ‚ÄúI have never had any personal ambitions. I have but one: to make my > contribution to destroy the capitalist system.‚Äù She later drifted from the Communist Party as she was critical of Stalin, and became more sympathetic to Scottish nationalism. John Maclean, whose classes she attended in Glasgow, was a major proponent of an independent \\"Scottish workers republic\\".  Music  Family sing-a-longs nurtured Mary Brooksbank's love of music. She sang, played the violin and wrote songs. When money was low, she would ride the ferry from Dundee to Tayport and sing for money in the street. Most of her songs were about the life of the working-class mill workers of Dundee, mostly women. She called these songs \\"Mill Songs\\". They were full of detail and sympathy for the struggle with which these hard- working, poorly paid women were engaged just to feed and care for their families. Dundee Women's Trail: 25 Footsteps over 4 Centuries, Mary Henderson, 2008. Her most famous song was \\"Jute Mill Song\\" or \\"Oh Dear Me\\". Scots Language CentreJute Mill Song (Mary Brooksbank) Oh dear me, the mill's gannin' fast The puir wee shifters canna get a rest Shiftin' bobbins coorse and fine They fairly mak' ye work for your ten and nine Oh dear me, I wish the day was done Rinnin' up and doon the Pass it is nae fun Shiftin', piecin', spinnin' warp weft and twine Tae feed and clad my bairnie affen ten and nine Oh dear me, the warld is ill divided Them that works the hardest are the least provided I maun bide contented, dark days or fine For there's nae much pleasure livin' affen ten and nine Repeat 1 You can hear it sung by Mary Brookshanks and then by later folksingers at the Scots Language Centre: Scotslanguage.com - Work Songs. Her original notebook of songs and poems is held by the archives at the University of Dundee.  Death  Mary Brooksbank died at Ninewells Hospital in Dundee on 16 March 1978. A library in Dundee was named in her honour. When the library was closed, the Brooksbank Centre on Pitairlie Road was named after her. As well, a verse from her famous Jute Mill Song is inscribed in Iona marble on the Scottish Parliament Building's Canongate Wall, which displays quotations from many famous Scottish writers and poets.  In popular culture  A rearrangement of the \\"Jute Mill Song\\" or \\"Oh Dear Me\\" was created by the American artists Brian House and Sue Huang of collaborative Knifeandfork for a performance installation at West Ward Works and Verdant Works in 2016 for the NEoN Digital Arts Festival. A series of musicians situated along a path winding through the historic jute mills of the Blackness area of Dundee, Scotland passed along messages as encoded song fragments that were then decoded at end terminals.

Also referred to as gender-sensitive budgeting, this practice does not entail dividing budgets for women. It aims at dealing with budgetary gender inequality issues, including gender hierarchies and the discrepancies between women's and men's salaries. At its core, gender budgeting is a feminist policy with a primary goal of re-orienting the allocation of public resources, advocating for an advanced decision-making role for women in important issues, and securing equity in the distribution of resources between men and women. Gender budgeting allows governments to promote equality through fiscal policies by taking analyses of a budget's differing impacts on the sexes as well as setting goals or targets for equality and allocating funds to support those goals. This practice does not always target intentional discrimination, but rather forces an awareness of the effects of financial schemes on all genders. Gender budgeting can be characterized as a gender status and class-based policy.O'Hagan, A. 2015. Favourable conditions for the adoption and implementation of gender budgeting: Insights from comparative analysis. Politica Economica, 31(2), 233-252. As a gender status policy, gender budgeting has the purpose of doing away with power hierarchies that have conferred privileges to men and devalued the contributions made by women. Gender budgeting remedies the disadvantages and discrimination against women by incorporating them in the budgetary process and fighting marginalization and exclusion from economic, political, and constitutional processes. As a class-based policy, gender budgeting visualizes the sexual division of labor and exposed the consequent economic and social marginalization on women. Gender budgeting exposes such inequalities and sets the stage for the equalization of the status of women through the advancement of resources and civic rights to facilitate better access to services funded by governments. In public finance, there is insufficient evidence paid by policy makers and gender activists regarding the taxation section as gender activists should certainly be concerned about the revenue side of the budget.Valodia, I. 2009. Gender, poverty and taxation: An overview of a multi-country study of gender and taxation. Agenda: Empowering Women for Gender Equity, (81), 137-147. Retrieved from http://www.jstor.org/stable/27868988 There is a direct relationship between government expenditure and taxation; when there are no sufficient revenues, the expenditure programs will be unfunded and the chances to reach gender equity are less since taxes are the essence of government profits. Henceforth, countries with insufficiently low revenues are generally unable to enhance public and social services which increases the burden on women to provide more care and social provision. In turn, women tend to fall outside the income tax threshold as they earn lower incomes than men. It is implemented by ministry of women and child development.  Significance of Gender Budgeting  Gender budgeting primarily helps to dismantle gender inequalities. Gender inequalities are still visible in the modern society and are clearly demonstrated in entrepreneurship opportunities, labor participation, remuneration, education, health outcomes, governance, and personnel representation in top management positions.Downes, R., Von Trapp, L. and Nicol, S., 2017. Gender budgeting in OECD countries. OECD Journal on Budgeting, 16(3), pp.71-107, Retrieved from http://www.oecd.org/gender/Gender- Budgeting-in-OECD-countries.pdf While these disparities may be associated with traditional aspects especially on the cultural roles of men and women, they demonstrate inequalities in the allocation of public resources. The purpose of gender budgeting is to remedy such inequalities by ensuring that public policy is designed and delivered in an inclusive manner which recognizes women as key contributors to economic advancement. Gender budgeting requires the auditing of public budgets to incorporate the gender differences that are cemented in social systems of reproduction. Public budgets tend to ignore key social reproduction roles such as the maintenance of domestic spaces, human relationships, and bodies which is mostly done by women. The auditing of gender budgets allows for the visualization of women's unpaid work of social reproduction and its contribution to the well-being of the entire society.Addabbo, T., Lanzi, D. & Picchio, A. 2010. Gender budgets: a capability approach. Journal of Human Development and Capabilities, 11(4), pp.479-501, retrieved from https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Antonella_Picchio/publication/227620162_Gender_Budgets_A_Capability_Approach/links/00b495362673128758000000/Gender- Budgets-A-Capability-Approach.pdf  Main activities  Three principal activities have been recognized as gender budgeting sensitive: # At the institutional level, the goal is to understand policies promoted by governmental institutions and how these affect gender inequalities within a specific society. # Analysis of the institutional budget, in order to see whether gender mainstreaming activities are included. # Planning as well as implementing a gender-based budget that will focus on gender-related issues. Point 3 most likely includes the restructuring of the existing budget to deal with gender-related issues. Gender budgeting depends on including a gender perspective when addressing funding allocations and programs.  Emergence  The movement towards gender equity has gained impetus over the past 25 years throughout the world as the international community has dedicated itself publicly to promote gender equity realizing that equality between gender is essential for social development and economic growth.Rubin, M., & Bartle, J. 2005. Integrating Gender into Government Budgets: A New Perspective. Public Administration Review, 65(3), 259-272. Retrieved from http://www.jstor.org/stable/3542503 Early efforts towards gender budgeting were fronted by the 1966 International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights which required signatory states to put in place appropriate measures to advance economic rights and promote gender equality. The ‚ÄúInternational Bill of Rights for Women‚Äù or the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) was adopted in 1979 by the United Nations General Assembly setting an agenda for what constitutes as gender discrimination in hopes to take action to end it. In 1995, The 4th UN conference on Women was held in Beijing which endorsed the obligation taken to end discrimination against women. United Nations. 1995. Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action. Retrieved from www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/beijing/platform/ plat2.htm This particular platform called on governments to integrate gender equality into its implementation of all its budget processes to promote equal and appropriate resource allocation to foster equality. By 2004, 179 out of 191 UN member states bounded themselves to take action to tackle the problem.  Analysis  Gender budget analysis aims at finding out whether women and men can access the same opportunities equally. In gender budget analysis, gaps are addressed so that those who are disadvantaged become empowered. A gender-sensitive budget analysis contains how budgets recognize and answer the needs of men and women, whether they are children, young or adults.Balmori, H. H. 2003. Gender and Budgets, Overview Report. BRIDGE (development - gender) Brighton, Institute of Development Studies. http://www.eldis.org/v le/upload/1/document/0708/DOC19156.pdf (Accessed 5 July 2014.)Quinn, S. 2009. Gender Budgeting: Practical implementation handbook. Strasbourg, Council of Europe, Directorate General of Human Rights and Legal Affairs. Gender budget analysis plays a key role in highlighting discrimination against women and how money is distributed between two groups.Elson, D. 2005. Monitoring Government Budgets for Compliance with CEDAW: Report highlights and key conclusions. NY, United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM). http://www.iwraw- ap.org/resources/pdf/ MonitoringGovernmentBudgetsComplianceCEDAW_summary_eng.pdf (Accessed 5 July 2014.) This type of analysis contributes to finding solutions to gender discrimination and highlights empowerment or disempowerment among two distinct groups: men and women. Gender budgeting is not intended to look only at female budgets or policies but to rather examine the effects that gender has on all programs and policies. Depending on the country, there are specific processes that gender budgeting goes through. Nonetheless, in all cases, gender analysis and monitoring must be carried out in principle.Klatzer, E., & Stiegler, B. 2011. Gender budgeting - an equality policy strategy. (12), 8. The stages for gender analysis are as follows: i. Administration must prepare budget draft. ii. Parliament debates the budget. iii. Budget implementation should be monitored. iv. Budget implementation should be reported and accounted. In order for a gender budget to be successfully adopted and implemented, certain actions are considered necessary. These actions are divided into three phases: advocacy and agenda-setting, formal adoption, and implementation of the gender-aware budget. Advocacy and agenda-setting involves the creation of a pro-equality climate through commitment to gender equality and mainstreaming, advocating for political change, understanding the process of making budgets, pushing for favorable economic conditions, and supporting the implementation of a gender-quality framework. The formal adoption process encompasses the formulation of clear frameworks for gender budgets, engaging important actors such as government officials and politicians, and building the necessary political will. Lastly, the implementation phase covers the collection of evidence in practice, effecting political leadership, and coming up with strategies to promote continuity.  In practice  Gender budgeting in practice aims to prepare separate documents evaluating programs designed by the government for women in which the budget is then presented. These can come in different forms such as official budget proposals or just merely papers sketched from interest groups outside the government zone.Stotsky, J. G. 2007. Budgeting with Women in Mind. 9. 1\\\\. Expenditure effects evaluated: Expenditure is evaluated by disaggregating the spending of the government into categories beneficial for women and girls. 2\\\\. Revenue effects evaluated: Another recent initiative to assess revenue policies is by aiming to fully end discrimination against women in the personal income tax. Gender budgeting has been put to practice across many countries and its impacts assessed. The 2016 OECD Survey of Gender Budgeting Practicesis one of the few existing documentations of the extent of the implementation of gender budgeting and its impact. The survey revealed that 15 out of the 34 surveyed countries had already introduced gender budgeting while others had plans to introduce the concept in their budgetary processes. The process of gender budgeting tends to be varied across countries as there is lack of consensus on the most effective approach. Three broad categories of gender budgeting systems have been identified: # Gender-informed resource allocation where decisions on resource allocation are based on the impact that such distribution has on gender equality; # Gender-assessed budgets where the overall effect of the budget is subjected to gender analysis; and # Needs-based gender budgeting where needs assessments lay the foundation for key budget decisions to give an understanding of the existing gender disparities and which policy approaches can have the most impact on gender equality.  Developments  To overcome gender-blind policies and budgets many feminists and government officials from different countries took it upon themselves to analyze differences and propose budgets that are considerate of the inequalities women face financially. Developments have been in practice in the United States and all over Europe. In the United States there have been gender budgeting efforts in California and Georgia. San Francisco, CA began developing a gender sensitive budget in 1998; Fulton County, GA began gender budgeting efforts in 2007. In Georgia, gender budgeting researchers have gathered rich and useful data through interviews with policymakers concerned with gender equality and through multiple meetings involving a focus group composed of task members of different departments. In California, relevant data was collected through interviews, observations of a commission meeting, from non-profit organizations, and from the municipal website. In Europe, many countries have joined efforts in implementing gender sensitive budgets. Spain, Iceland, Italy, Germany, Austria, Turkey, and the United Kingdom have all conducted research, collected data, and practiced different methodologies concerning gender budgeting. Vienna University of Economics and Business organized a conference with twenty different countries; this allowed for the countries to share their conceptual ideas, theories, and experiences. This engagement transformed economic models to focus on feminist economics, which take gender relations into account.  Impact  The impact of gender budgeting is hard to pinpoint owing to the recency of the practice and the unavailability of adequate data to support its usefulness. In countries which have introduced gender budgeting, indicators of the usefulness of the practice have emerged in the stimulation of policy adoption to address gender inequality in such key areas as education, income disparities, security, health outcomes, social and economic welfare, political representation, and labor participation. With more data on gender budgeting becoming available with time, its impact will be assessed and feedback incorporated to the generation of better policies.  Challenges  When implementing gender budgeting into policy there are many challenges and limitations. Many countries struggle to introduce the concept of gender budgeting. Political, regional, and cultural factors are used as indicators to measure gender equality. These indicators are vital in the gender budgeting process; however, they fail to determine whether or not an ultimate goal has been reached. Also, gender budgeting is interdisciplinary, so different scholars struggle to accept techniques of gender budgeting. Feminists face the issue in trying to promote gender budgeting is creating connections and relationships with political actors that will pursue gender budgeting developments.

The neighborhood is located off the northern shore of Long Island Sound on Echo Bay. It was developed as an upper middle class enclave for families with heads of households employed in New York City and served as a model for the ideal suburban setting; harmonious architecture and exclusive amenities. The development appears to have been modeled on neighboring Larchmont Manor in the Town of Mamaroneck, yet on a smaller scale. That subdivision was conceived originally as an exclusive and convenient seasonal playground for New York‚Äôs wealthy upper classes, with its 6-acre waterfront park. In 2008, a New York State Certified Local Government grant allowed the 'Historical and Landmarks Review Board' to hire an historic preservation firm to conduct extensive research on the historic and architectural significance of Sutton Manor. For both its physical attributes and social aspects, Sutton Manor is a significant historic resource for the community and deserving of its protection through designation as a local historic district under the city code. Although not currently listed on the National Register of Historic Places, Sutton Manor meets all of the criteria and is clearly eligible for designation. Development At the turn of the 18th century, most of the waterfront acreage in the northeast section of New Rochelle was owned by one of its original settlers, Huguenot Louis Guion. Another of the French refugees, Alexander Allaire, purchased much of it in 1748. The lands eventually came into the hands of James Pitcher, Commissary of Musters in the British Army, who owned it until the outbreak of the Revolutionary War. For some unknown reason his property was not confiscated and he was able to leave it to his nephew, Thomas Huntington. The portion of the property that is now Sutton Manor, came into the possession of Thaddeus Davids in the late 1830s. At the time, Davids was the head of one of the largest ink companies in the country. He built a country home in the middle of the parcel, naming it \\"Echo Place\\" to reflect its frontage on Echo Bay. He also bought an island off New Rochelle‚Äôs southern shore that still bears his name. Davids had a large family of 12 children born to 3 different wives. His second son, George W. Davids, eventually brought the family business to ruin. The company and Thaddeus Davids, individually, were forced to dispose of all assets, which resulted in the 1884 sale of Echo Place to George W. Sutton to be enjoyed as a country retreat by his family. After Sutton‚Äôs death in 1894, the property was rented out until his heirs decided to develop the property. In 1904, George W. Sutton, Jr. formed the 'Sutton Manor Realty Company', selecting civil engineer and architect Lawrence E. Van Etten to draw up the subdivision plan of 50 home sites for the property. Van Etten designed about 100 subdivisions in Westchester County between 1890 and 1950, as well as several golf courses including the Wykagyl Country Club here, Pelham Country Club and Knollwood Country Club in Elmsford. Architecture Sutton Manor exemplifies an upper middle class enclave, attractive to professionals desirous of tasteful surroundings. The vast majority of houses that comprise the neighborhood are essentially intact to their initial construction dates. Sutton Manor retains its original plan and amenities, while the architecture of the homes exhibit the array of stylistic choices available during the 1904 ‚Äì 1927 time frame, primarily Colonial Revival, Craftsman, Tudor Revival, Mediterranean, Bungalow, and Art Moderne. Many of them are early examples of styles that were just being introduced. Three of the dwellings predate the neighborhoods development and are associated with the Thaddeus Davids property, \\"Echo Place\\", thus physically linking the community to an even earlier period. It was a subdivision that served as a model for the \\"ideal suburban setting\\" ‚Äî harmonious architecture and exclusive amenities. Adding to the significance of this collection of early 20th century houses is that many represent the work of prominent New York architects and builders including Chester A. Patterson, William Liance Cottrell and Charles Lupprian, as well as one nationally prominent architect, John Russell Pope. Residents With its proximity to New York City, many of the Manor's residents were involved in activities of regional, statewide and national significance, which instigated frequent mention of the \\"exclusive Sutton Manor\\" in The New York Times. Beginning with Thaddeus Davids, an important ink manufacturer from before the Civil War and for whom Davids Island is named, the property has been home to important financiers, bankers, attorneys, industrialists, inventors, engineers, politicians, public servants, artists of every ilk, actors, and other notable figures. Well known yachtsmen, boat designers and enthusiasts made Sutton Manor home as well. Notable former residents include: Rowland Hughes, Director of the U.S. Office of Management and Budget; Lee Parsons Davis, New York State Supreme Court Justice and District Attorney of Westchester County; prominent early Twentieth Century American artists Coles Phillips and Ernest Albert; Tony Award-winning actress Frances Sternhagen; and actor Thomas Carlin.

Biography Gradi was born in Zadar in 1825, where he attended the Gymnasium. After studying law in Padua, his judicial career led him to Dubrovnik, Split, Zadar, Rijeka and Kotor, then part of the Habsburg Monarchy. Following retirement, he settled in Dubrovnik, devoting himself mainly to literature and politics. Apart from law, the scope of his erudition included classical, Italian and old Serbian literature. Gradi was a miscellaneous writer, and his articles, sketches, polemics, poems and dramatic texts in both Italian and Serbian were published in supplements, calendars, pamphlets and books. He focused on the philological problem of the composition of Gunduliƒá's Osman. His passion for old Ragusan writers and folk tradition urged him to write exclusively in Serbian in his mature years. His verse deals with patriotic and current political themes, advocating for the idea of the unity of South Slavs (Yugoslavism), whom he considered one nation composed of several tribes. His position on the Serb origin of the Slavonians, Dalmatians and Ragusans gave rise to considerable controversy with the adherents of the pro-Croatian People's Party and pro-Italian Autonomist Party. During his service in Rijeka, his collection of poems Il poeta et il genio della terra appeared in print (1864). Despite an impressive level of erudition, he was not an original writer and failed to produce a major literary work, his importance today being primarily cultural and historical. The reason for this most certainly lies in the predominantly occasional character of his texts, often imbued with political ideas which have become anachronistic. Nik≈°a Gradi died in Dubrovnik in 1894 and was buried in Boninovo Cemetery in Dubrovnik.

The only continental territory in Latin America to remain under European control into the 21st century, Guiana has not seen the same political developments as most countries in the region. Still, anarchism has existed to some degree, mainly through the presence of political prisoners deported to the colony. In the modern era, anarchism has had a minor presence in the Guianan political milieu. History Located on the northern Atlantic coast of South America and inhabited by Amerindians indigenous peoples, Guiana was first encountered by Europeans in 1498 when Christopher Columbus reached it, naming the region the \\"Land of Pariahs\\". Several attempts to colonize Guiana were made by European states, all of them failing, until the late 17th century when France somewhat successfully colonized the region. While it switched hands many times during the next few centuries, it eventually returned to the French. The history of French Guiana since colonization can be said to largely have been defined by imprisonment, escape, and rebellion. Many slaves brought from Africa in the region escaped between the mid-17th century and onwards, forming independent maroon communities together with indigenous tribes. Contemporary communities of escaped slaves in neighboring Brazil, such as Palmares (1605‚Äì1694) and its leader Zumbi, have sometimes been upheld by modern anarchists as examples of early anti-colonialism, decentralization, and democracy. These communities of free escaped slaves often waged war against the French colonial settlements. Additionally, slave revolts were relatively frequent. A prominent was one in 1796, when riots broke out after plantation owners refused to obey the abolition of slavery enacted by the French First Republic. After the execution of the same man that had carried out said abolition, Maximilien de Robespierre, in 1794, 193 Jacobin supporters - political radicals whose involvement in the French Revolution and one-time alliance with the revolutionary sans-culottes had an immense impact on the later development of revolutionary and libertarian thought - were deported to Guiana. They were the first of many political prisoners to come. When in 1797 Jean-Charles Pichegru and others were sent to the colony as prisoners, they found that only 54 of the deportees were still alive, the rest had either succumbed to tropical diseases or escaped. Another slave revolt came in 1804, when Napoleon reintroduced slavery in France's American colonies. After the French Revolution of 1848, in which early anarchists like Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and Joseph D√©jacque participated, slavery was again abolished, leading to a massive increase in the maroon population. From the mid-19th century, French Guiana became one of France's primary penal colonies, seeing a massive influx of both criminal and political prisoners over the next century. One early prisoner was Louis Charles Delescluze, arrested and deported in 1853, who after his release in 1859 became associated with the International Workingmen's Association, later becoming a prominent leader of the revolutionary libertarian socialist Paris Commune. The Communard, who was killed on the barricades, wrote an account of his imprisonment in Guiana; De Paris √† Cayenne, Journal d'un transport√©. Most political prisoners were placed on the √éles du Salut, especially the notorious Devil's Island, which was active as a prison between 1852 and 1953. It became controversial for its reputation of harshness and brutality. Violence between prisoners was common, tropical diseases were rife, and guards were often corrupt. While most prominently known for its connection to the Dreyfus affair, many French anarchists were imprisoned on the island as well, during the late 19th and early 20th century. Many of them were illegalists, engaging in propaganda of the deed and individual reclamation. The most prominent anarchist imprisoned in French Guiana was the illegalist Cl√©ment Duval (1850‚Äì1935), who - unable to work after being wounded in the Franco-Prussian War - turned to theft. Duval, a member of the Panther of Batignolles, was first sentenced to death for burglary (and stabbing the policeman arresting him repeatedly), but later had the sentence commuted to hard labor on Devil's Island. He spent the next 14 years in prison, attempting escape over 20 times. In April 1901, he succeeded and fled to New York City, where he lived until the age of 85. His memoirs were published in 1929, titled Outrage: An Anarchist Memoir of the Penal Colony. In 1894, an anarchist-led prison revolt broke out on Devil's Island. The troubles began in September, when a jailer killed the anarchist Francois Briens. On 21 October, the jailer was stabbed to death. In the following manhunt, Achille Charles Simon - an accomplice of the executed bomber Ravachol - was shot after being found hiding, as were the anarchists Marsevin, Lebault and Jules Leon Leauthier (the later of which had been sentenced for trying to stab the Serbian Minister in Paris to death). In the following chaos, the guards killed numerous anarchist prisoners, among them Dervaux, Boesie, Garnier, Benoit Chevenet, Edouard Aubin Marpaux, Mattei, Maxime Lebeau, Mazarquil, Henri Pierre Meyrveis, Auguste Alfred Faugoux, Thiervoz, and Bernard Mamert. Others died long after, due to the rough conditions and torture, among them Mamaire and Anthelme Girier. Other anarchist prisoners in French Guiana included Marius Jacob, an illegalist burglar who spent fourteen years in Cayenne and was one of the inspirations for the author Maurice Leblanc's character Ars√®ne Lupin, the Bonnot Gang members Jean De Boe (who after his escape in 1922 fled to Brussels, becoming a noted anarcho- syndicalist) and Eug√®ne Dieudonn√© (who was pardoned, after escaping prison in December 1926), and Paul Roussenq, who spent a whole twenty years in Guiana on charges of military insubordination, later visiting the Soviet Union (becoming a firm critic of it) and being interned by Vichy France. =Contemporary= French Guiana remains part of France, now as an overseas department and region, not a separate territory. It remains the only territory in continental Latin America that have not been decolonized by its associated European power, and has little autonomy from France itself. The region's political situation is dominated by Guianese Socialist Party, in addition to other left-wing parties like the Democratic Forces of Guiana, Walwari, and the Decolonization and Social Emancipation Movement. In 2004 the French anarcho-communist movement Alternative libertaire established a local group in French Guiana. Alternative Libertaire Guyane is engaged in primarily anti-colonialism, but also labor struggles, immigrant rights, housing issues, and so on.

The main features of her literary works are a suggestive style, characterized by a dynamic, modern, and very distinctive approach to language, including aspects of authenticity, openness when describing intimate scenes, and insights into the psyche of the main characters. Her style draws the reader into the story and allows them to be an interested, silent observer, sharing the same perspective as the main characters in the story.

The exotic environment of the Amazon Basin features in this mystical story with a surprising culmination; Jumaroro combines suspense, exoticism and mystery. As the plot develops, the book poses numerous questions; the reader's imagination, curiosity, and expectations are aroused, as well as a feeling of something unexplainable, right up until the dramatic ending, when the answers to the above take the reader's breath away. Jumaroro is credited as the novel that introduced Lauerov√°'s work to a wider audience. = A Harsh Ovation (2012) = This second poetry collection is a selection of poems from 2010 to 2012. The paradoxical title itself suggests the direction and content of the verses, which include painful and depressing themes. In her poems, Lauerov√° deliberately ignores superficial and earthly subjects; the focus of her poetry is the human soul and, as in the first collection of poems Michael2007, there are deep spiritual overtones. The poems are accompanied by full-colour illustrations by Monica Sedl√°≈ôov√°, a talented young Czech artist currently living in England. This edition is limited to 1000 copies and each one has been personally signed by the author. = The Lurker (2012) = A chamber thriller partly set in Prague's underground Metro system which offers the delicate, chilling yet human story of a mysterious and ugly man without a past. As usual, the d√©nouement is surprising and readers will again be confronted with the author's fascination with the depths of the human mind and an empathetic insight into the feelings of others. Lauerov√° retains her authentic literary style, enriched by a new, increasingly dark poetic flavour that gives The Lurker a completely unique touch. = Sexy Strategy (2015) = After a three-year hiatus, Sylva Lauerov√° returned with Sexy Strategy.

The appeal of this mystical story is enhanced by the enchanting backdrop of Prague, and set in an anonymous and wild metropolis where the underground metro is not only the most popular means of transport but the axis in which the fates of its inhabitants are intertwined; the fates of those who have yet to realise how a brief encounter with a strange, taciturn and disfigured man will change their lives forever.Komiks.cz. komiks.cz [online].

Voiced by: Kyle McCarley (English), Tetsuya Kakihara (Japanese) = Story = Disgaea 5 takes place in a universe with many Netherworlds, each of which is ruled by an Overlord who has a unique Overload ability, which can also be used in battle as a special attack. Prior to the story's events, Tyrant Overlord Killidia was a bloodthirsty demon who grew up in and became the Overlord of the ruthless Netherworld Cryo Blood. One day, he fought Goldion, a martial arts master who created the Ultimate Demon Technique fighting style. After Goldion defeated Killidia, he decided to make him his pupil, changing his name to Killia. Killia then fell in love with Goldion's daughter Liezerota, slowly becoming a kinder person as a result. Lieze's brother Void, who has the power to steal Overloads, became jealous of Killia's family bonds, and believed he should be the heir to the Ultimate Demon Technique. However, he did not realize that Goldion selected Killia because Void's impure heart would prevent him from learning the Final Skill. Unable to master the Final Skill due to the inner conflict with his current and former self, Killia fled Goldion, but Lieze followed him. In an ensuing battle between Killia and Void, Lieze was presumed killed protecting Killia, though she was really just put in stasis with Void's power. Void stole Killia's Overload and changed his name to Void Dark, forming an army - the Lost - to find a means of reviving Lieze. Killia, now having lost his full powers, joins up with the Overlord Seraphina to fight the Lost. Using Seraphina's base, they ally with several other Overlords to form the Rebel Army and rescue numerous Netherworlds from The Lost. In the process, they encounter Void Dark's second in command, Demon General Bloodis. They later realize that Bloodis is actually Goldion, but brainwashed. Killia and Zeroken attempt to use the Final Skill to purge the evil from Bloodis, and unknowingly succeed, but Goldion keeps this a secret in order to protect them from Void Dark. Void Dark sends magical spears to many Netherworlds to absorb their energy, and the rebel army destroys them one by one. While doing so, the members of the group come across their respective homeworlds and overcome the obstacles in their hearts to gain or enhance their overloads. Killia overcomes his fear of becoming his past self and accepts it in full, becoming able to use the Final Skill on his own. The rebel army finally attacks Void Dark's base. There, Goldion sacrifices his life in battle to teach Killia the technique's secret Ultimate Skill, revealing the truth. The group finally encounters Void, who is defeated with said skill, but not before reviving Lieze. She goes berserk due to the uncontrolled amount of dark power inside her, but Killia saves her by combining the Ultimate Skill with the Overloads of his friends. With The Lost defeated, the Netherworlds begin rebuilding and the group disperses. Killia and Lieze live peacefully in the fringes of the Netherworlds, and after the game's credits, the Rebel Army meets again to deal with new threats, with Lieze joining them. Gameplay Battle interface screenshot The game involves the player traveling across different Netherworlds in an attempt to bring the Overlords and heirs of each different world to join forces together to fight against Void Dark.

While initially scheduled to release in April 2018, it was delayed until the summer, and ultimately to October 2018 due to an unspecified \\"issue\\", despite the game's demo - accidentally containing the full game - having already been released and quickly pulled from Steam. Despite the supposed issue, the unlocked demo was later distributed on piracy sites, allowing the entire title to be played illicitly. The unclear reasons for the delay, as well as the removal of all network features, including the Strategy Assembly and Netherworld Edit Shop, again due to unspecified \\"irreconcilable platform differences\\", resulted in the release being called a \\"months-long debacle\\" by Kotaku. Reception The game sold 22,725 physical retail copies within its first week of release in Japan. The game has received largely positive reviews, with an aggregate score of 80/100 on Metacritic for its original PS4 version. By January 5, 2018, the Nintendo Switch version has sold more than 200,000 copies worldwide. By April 2018, the Nintendo Switch version has sold nearly 200,000 copies in the west alone.

Sagara subdivision consists of Sagara, Soraba, Hosanagara and Shikaripur taluks. City Municipal Council Sagara city is one of the 74 Karnataka Municipal Reforms Project (KMRP) City in Karnataka. Sagara ULB was started in 1931 and became a City Municipal Council (CMC) grade two in the year 2007. The ULB consist of 31 wards with the respective number of councillors. The population of the city was 64,550 at the 2011 census and total area is 19.71 sq. km. Etymology Sagara derives its name from Sadashiva Sagar, which is a lake. Sadashiva Nayaka, ruler of Keladi dynasty built a lake in between Keladi and Ikkeri. Sadashiva Sagar is now called Ganapathi Kere (Ganapathi Lake). It is a subdivisional headquarters headed by a subdivisional magistrate and Fifth additional District Magistrate.  Economy  The economy of Sagara is mainly driven by areca nut (betel nut), paddy, spice and forest products trade. Betel nut is the major cash crop grown in the area. Along with areca nut, spices like pepper, clove, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cocoa are grown. The economy of the city is highly volatile and is dependent on the variation in the pricing of these agriculture products. Sagara APMC is one of the main market for areca nut in Karnataka. Sagara has a relatively high number of Gudigars ‚Äì families that for generations have been engaged in sandalwood and ivory carving. The Gudigar men make idols, figurines and knickknacks like penholders, agarbathi stands, cuff links, photo frames and paper clips; the women are adept at making garlands and wreaths out of thin layers of scraped sandalwood.

It is approximately 30 km by National Highway 206. Jog falls is located 30 Km from Sagara and 100 km from Shivamogga. It is also known as Gerusoppa Falls or Jogada Gundi in Kannada. It is the second-highest plunge waterfall in India. The drive from Shimoga to Jog falls is scenic and lush with greenery all around, clouds and mist floating among the green hills is a typical sight. July‚ÄìAugust is the best time to visit Jog falls. ;Nipli Falls ;Honnemaradu Honnemaradu is situated on the banks of the backwaters of the Sharavati river. A big water mass extends up to the Chakra dam. It is about 35 km from Sagara city towards Jog and 10 km from Talaguppa. Indian Institute For Adventure Applications is a training school situated here which uses adventure as a platform for learning. Boating at Honnemaradu ;Holebaagilu Holebaagilu is situated on the banks of the Sharavati River about 30 km from Sagar. One has to take a diversion from B. H. Road towards Ikkeri Road to get there. The Sharavati backwaters of Linganamakki dam has submerged acres of land. It is in Kolur Grama Panchayat limits. One has to take a flatboat to get across the backwaters to reach the other side where Sigandooru is. ;Sharavati Wildlife Sanctuary Sharavati Wildlife Sanctuary is in Sagar Taluk, Karnataka. It is 350 km from Bangalore. Located near Jog Falls, the sanctuary covers the Sharavati Valley Region, near the western border of Karnataka. It is spread over an area of 431 km. The sanctuary is nourished by the Sharavati River. Linganamakki reservoir spread over an area of 128.7 km is a part of this sanctuary. Wildlife near Sagar ;Linganamakki dam Linganamakki dam is built across the Sharavathi river and is 6 km from Jog Falls in Sagara taluk. It is the main feeder reservoir for the Mahatma Gandhi hydro-electric project. It has two power generating units of 27.5 MW ;Dabbe Falls,Sagara Dabbe Falls is located near Hosagadde in Sagar taluk. On the road from Sagara to Bhatkal, Hosagadde lies about 20 km from the town of Kargal. From Hosagadde a walk of 6‚Äì8 km into the forest leads to Dabbe Falls. = Places of worship = ;Marikamba Temple The Marikamba Temple is located in Sagara City, in the Indian state of Karnataka. It features the image of the goddess Marikamba, a form of Durga or Parvati. The temple was built in the center of the city during the reign of Venkatappa Nayak who ruled over Keladi and Ikkeri kingdom during the 16th century. Marikamba was the family deity of the Nayaka dynasty. Historical lake - Ganapathi Kere in Sagara City 360 Panaroma View ;Keladi A Shiva temple of historical importance is located 6 km from the city. One has to take a diversion at Sorab Road. There is a museum containing old manuscripts written during the Keladi dynasty. ;Sigandooru Sigandooru is a holy place of Goddess Chaudeshwari. A large temple of Goddess Chaudeshwari is here. This Goddess is a highly believed deity in Sagar and the surrounding taluks as a protector against theft and robbery. Coupons for entry will be distributed on first- come, first-served basis. ;Varadapura (Varadahalli/Vaddalli) This place is 6 km from the city where one has to take a diversion from Jog Road soon after the end of the city limits. It is known for the samadhi of Sri Sridhara Swami who was among the great saints of 20th century. ;Ikkeri This place is of historic importance due to the presence of a temple dedicated to Lord Shiva. One has to take a diversion at B. H. Road and travel 6 km. Aghoreshwara Temple ;Kalasi [Kalase or Nadakalasi or Nadakalase] Nadakalasi is a small village about 8 kilometers away from Sagara in Shivamogga district of Karnataka. One has to travel along Sorab Road for 6 km and take a diversion. Hidden in its densely populated flora and fauna is a temple complex from the Hoysala times. Baleyanna Vergade (Heggade), a local ruler who had accepted the mighty Hoysalas as the overseeing authority of his regions during that time, has constructed two temples next to each other in 1218 AD, during the rule of Veera Ballala II. The temples are a mix of Hoysala and Dravidian temple architectures, but the Hoysala influences are there to be seen in abundance. The larger of the two temples is the Mallikarjuna Temple dedicated to the Mallikarjuna Shiva Linga in its only sanctum sanctorum. A highlight of this temple are the smooth looking lathe turned pillars inside. They seem to have such a fine finish despite the fact that the stones used don't appear to be the best quality soap stones that we witness at Belur or Belavadi. The main shikhara is of Kadamba Nagara style. The Rameshwara Temple at Nadakalasi is less extravagant, but equally well decorated, and has, to its credit, a Sala slaying the lion statue next to its Shikhara. The main deity is the Rameshwara Linga, but it has been referred to as Sadashiva in the past. Nadakalasi's closeness to Sagara hasn't still ensured its visibility on the tourist map, although, equally closer towns of Keladi and Ikkeri enjoy better recall among visitors. ;Varadamoola Varadamoola is 6 km from Sagara City. River Varada originates at this place. Varada flows through the town of Banavasi before joining Tungabhadra. ;Shettisara This place has a Shani temple and Laxminarayana Temple. In Shanashewara Temple it is claimed God will come on Human body. Ganapathi temple This temple is a unique feature of the scenic beauty of sagara beside a lake(Ganapathi kere). where temple and mosque are together side by side, this symbolises social harmony among peoples of sagara. ;St Joseph's Church, Sagar http://www.stjosephchurchsagar.org/ Sports * Major sports played are Cricket and Volleyball. **Lot of state level tournaments are organised in summer and winter to tap the potential of youth. **Community sports events are also organised * Football, kabaddi are also seen playing Major roads passing through Sagara taluk * National Highways: **NH-206 * State Highways: **SH-50 passes through Jog, Mavinagundi, Siddapur, Chandragutti, Sorab. **SH-62 passes through Siralakoppa and Sagar. **SH-77 passes through Sorab, Masur, Sagar, Hosanagar. Rare disorders ;Handigodu syndrome Handigodu joint disease (HJD) is a familial skeletal disorder. Handigodu, near Sagara is one of only two places in the world where this disorder is to be found ‚Äì the other being northern Zululand, South Africa. Severe precocious, progressive degenerative osteoarthropathy causes marked physical handicap by adulthood. The clinical and radiological manifestations are very similar to MJD (Mseleni joint disease) and they are sometimes believed to be the same entity. ;Kyasanur Forest disease Kyasanur Forest disease, also known as Monkey Disease is a rare endemic tick-borne viral haemorrhagic fever which was first noticed in Kyasanur village, near Sorab. Arecanut Palm at the Plantation IN the month of november 2018 to march 2019 this disease caused a serious problems to the peoples life f \\"ARALAGODU\\" Village. Many people died because of this virus.and some get cured by taking early treatment There is no permanent medicine to cure this virus but we can avoid the disease by applying DMP oil (available in nearby GOVT HOSPITALS) to the hands and legs when we go to forest areas . All the people of the affected village are advised to take injections given (in two stages) by the health department to avoid the entry of the virus into the body. This is a disease usually arises from the DEAD MONKEY and \\"TICKS\\" are the carrier of this virus. TICKS will inject the virus from the dead monkey and when this ticks bites the human the virus gets injected into the human body prevention - as soon as you get to know a monkey is died in your area/village inform the FOREST DEPARTMENT officers and they will come and burry the dead monkey and spray some chemicals to avoid the spread of virus.

The site was excavated between 2001 and 2003 by primary excavators Dougald O‚ÄôReilly of the Australian National University, Pheng Sitha and Thuy Chanthourn. The excavation was intended to discover more about Iron Age life in Cambodia. Discovery The site was discovered in 2000 during roadworks, that linked Phum Snay village with National Road 6. Investigations revealed the presence of a number of ancient burials associated with material including bronzes and semiprecious stones. Immediate widespread looting by the local inhabitants over an area of made a full assessment of the extent of the archaeological remains difficult. Excavations started in February 2001 on a 15 x 5 m area.  Chronology  The site dates roughly between 500 BC and AD 500. These dates were not obtained from stratigraphy as many of the artifacts and burials were disturbed by looting.Oxenham, M., & Tayles, N. (Eds.). (2006). Bioarchaeology of Southeast Asia (Vol. 43). Cambridge University Press. Chronology was therefore determined by comparison to other nearby sites with similar grave goods and mortuary rituals.  Human remains  A general analysis was done of the 134 individuals identified through the minimum number of individuals method. Twenty-one burials in total were exhumed that contained human remains. The researchers noted pathological lesions in photos and written descriptions. A few specimens were x-rayed but the images yielded limited results. The majority of the injuries listed were cranial lesions. These were categorized into two groups: those caused by sharp force trauma (henceforth referred to SFT) which left small focused circles or lines and those caused by blunt force trauma (BFT,) resulting in round depressions in the scalp. SFT lesions are generally caused by sharp edged weapons, such as knives, swords and axes. Projectiles, such as arrows or those used by a slingshot should also be considered as SFT objects or items. BFT lesions result from clubs, cudgels and hammers. Perimortem injuries were identified as separate from healed injuries because they often had bone flakes adhered to the edges of the fractures. Researchers were careful to distinguish between lesions caused by violence and those caused by infectious disease.  Results  =Traumatic lesions= Out of the sample discovered at Phum Snay, 23.4% of the individuals showed signs of traumatic lesions, a number that is much higher than any other site in Southeast Asia.Domett, K. M., O'Reilly, D. J. W., & Buckley, H. R. (2011). Bioarchaeological evidence for conflict in Iron Age north-west Cambodia. Antiquity, 85(328). Both BFT and SFT were present within the skeletal remains, but there was a much higher rate of healed lesions than perimortem lesions. Some individuals had more than one lesion present upon the cranium. Within a sample of fifteen individuals, seventeen BFT lesions could be seen. These BFT lesions were rounded in shape, ranging in diameter from roughly 4 to 22 mm. Estimations suggest that injuries acquired by the individuals at the site were much higher than the remains can represent because a majority of assaults probably caused soft-tissue injuries, which would not be preserved in the archaeological record. =Burials= Within the Phum Snay site, two types of burials were found. These include bodies that were stretched out lying flat and pits where remains were simply in piles.Lapteff, S. V. (2013). Early Iron Age Burial Practices of the Ancient Khmer People: The Phum Snay Necropolis, Northwestern Cambodia. Archaeology, Ethnology and Anthropology of Eurasia, 41(2), 137-145. The burials contained a variety of grave goods, including ceramic vessels, bronze ornaments (bangles, rings, and bells), and a large quantity of animal bones.O'Reilly, D. J., von den Driesch, A., & Voeun, V. (2006). Archaeology and archaeozoology of Phum Snay: a late prehistoric cemetery in northwestern Cambodia. Asian Perspectives, 45(2), 188-211.Glover, I., & Bellwood, P. S. (Eds.). (2004). Southeast Asia: from prehistory to history. New York: RoutledgeCurzon. The proportion of left forelimbs of hooved animals suggest a very particular sacrificial practice of animals within the burials. Researchers found that the manner of the burials and the goods contained within were closest in relation to the √ìc Eo culture of the Mekong Delta. =Weapons= Another major find within Phum Snay was the high percentage of burials containing weapons. The graves contained swords, daggers, spearheads, and projectile points. Due to the context of burials with high rates of traumatic lesions, the presence of these weapons indicates possible military formation, and certainly an increased level of violence than is seen in other sites within Southeast Asia. The weapons and tools found within the site were made of iron with bronze adornments. This solidified the site's place within the Iron Age because iron weapons and tools had many advantages over bronze, such as the high abundance of iron within the Earth, which made the spread of iron very rapid.Kipfer, B. A. (2007). Dictionary of artifacts. Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishing Also present in the burials of a number of young adult males were ornamental shoulder decorations, which further support the idea of a violence-oriented society. The lack of blunt objects within the burials is slightly puzzling due to the higher rate of BFT lesions than SFT lesions, but this could be explained if the individuals at Phum Snay wore helmets for protection. =Health= The health of the people living at Phum Snay was also determined from the burials. Rates of attrition, caries, and abscesses in the teeth of the human remains gave an idea of their dietary habits. The main result from the dentition was the presence of a social structure regarding male and female roles within the community. Rates of dental caries in females were higher than the males, which may be attributed to a sexual division of labor.Domett, K. M., & O'Reilly, D. J. W. (2009). Health in Pre-Angkorian Cambodia: a bioarchaeological analysis of the skeletal remains from Phum Snay. Asian Perspectives, 48(1), 56-78. If the men are out hunting, they are receiving a higher level of protein in the food they are consuming, while the females may be eating more cariogenic foods if they are back tending the fields and surrounded by starches and carbohydrates. =Morphological comparisons= Measurements were taken on the cranial and dental morphologies of the individuals found within Phum Snay to compare them with those of modern Cambodia, Vietnam, Thailand, and Laos.Matsumura, H., Domett, K. M., & O'REILLY, D. J. (2011). On the origin of pre-Angkorian peoples: perspectives from cranial and dental affinity of the human remains from Iron Age Phum Snay, Cambodia. Anthropological Science, 119(1), 67-79. The morphological similarities were found from Q-mode correlation coefficients of cranial and dental metrics. The findings indicated that the morphology of individuals at Phum Snay were significantly different than any of the other groups being compared. Overall, the modern groups have less robusticity than is found in the Phum Snay morphologies.  Archaeological significance  The high rates of traumatic lesions and weapons within the burials at Phum Snay suggest a society that values warriors. Fighting was an important part of life to the people, which could be indicative of increasing competition over access to exotic exchange items during the Iron Age. Furthering this idea is the general location of Phum Snay, right outside the Angkorian capital. Increasing competition over resources could have been the driving force behind the formation of a hierarchical society and organized state. The differences in morphological features between the human remains at Phum Snay and other modern Southeast Asian areas lends itself to the two-layer hypothesis. The people at Phum Snay were less affected by the substantial gene flow received by other areas of Southeast Asia.

Van Winkle of Parkersburg began as the Northwestern Railroad's secretary in 1852 and served as its President through the American Civil War.Toomey p. 134 Rival routes Although western Virginia farmers (as well as timber and mine interests) had long wished a railroad to transport their produce and raw materials for sale to eastern cities, the Virginia General Assembly had heavily favored the interests of its ports, especially Richmond, Virginia (on the James River) and Norfolk, Virginia (the major civilian port at Hampton Roads). Thus it had subsidized the James River Canal, as well as various central Virginia railroads which in 1850 were renamed the Virginia Central Railroad. However, neither Virginia corporation was able to finish planned construction across the Appalachian Mountains. The canal route planned early in the century would have connected to the Kanawha River, which joined the Ohio River at Parkersburg, but digging proved expensive, as was continual cleanup of flood debris and damage. The Virginia Central Railroad spun off the Blue Ridge Railroad to reach the Shenandoah Valley mid-century, but was only able to reach Clifton Forge by 1857, far short of crossing the Appalachians. Meanwhile, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O;) had chosen a less mountainous route to connect to the Ohio River valley. Its route to some extent paralleled the National Road, which crossed the Ohio River at Wheeling. Because the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal was its rival for shipping coal (early coal fields were developed in western Maryland), it had refused to allow the B&O; to lay track along the canal's right of way. Thus, the B&O; chose a route on the other side of the Potomac River through Harpers Ferry, Virginia. Still, crossing mountains increased costs and caused delays, as did financial panics, and the B&O; needed a charter extension in 1847 from the Virginia General Assembly. As part of the compromise that allowed the B&O; to reach Wheeling, the B&O; would also lay track to Grafton, where eventually it connected with the Northwestern Virginia Railroad.James D. Dilts, The Great Road: the Building of the Baltimore & Ohio, the Nation's First Railroad, 1828-1853 (Stanford University Press 1993) pp. 366-367 Thus, the B&O; reached Wheeling in 1853 and expected the Northwestern Virginia Railroad to reach Parkersburg in about a year, although that line actually opened in July, 1857. Trackage connected to St. Louis, Missouri, eventually superseding the still-dangerous Ohio River steamboats.Dilts p. 396 Meanwhile, another rival line, the Pennsylvania Railroad (which moved passengers and freight to Philadelphia) sought connections to western Virginia at Wheeling (via the Hempfield Railroad) as well as to Marietta, Ohio (10 miles north of Parkersburg; via the Pittsburgh and Connellsville Railroad).Dilts p. 367 American Civil War Both Union and Confederate forces recognized the strategic importance of the Northwestern Virginia Railroad as well as the B&O.; As the American Civil War began, CSA General Robert E. Lee initially vowed to protect the railroad, and sent first CSA Major Francis M. Boykin Jr., then CSA Col. George A. Porterfield (a Virginia Military Institute graduate from Charles Town across from Harpers Ferry) to recruit at Grafton. Neither had much success, however, nor did CSA Major Alonzo Loring at Wheeling. Instead, local Grafton lawyer George R. Latham commanded the local militia, which after Virginia voters (but not those in western Virginia) approved secession on May 23, took the train to Wheeling and became Company B of the Second Virginia Volunteer Infantry (U.S.). Moreover, the Clarksburg Resolution called for western Virginians to meet at Wheeling; 400 men (including Latham) met at what became the Wheeling Convention on May 13 and agreed to work against the upcoming secession vote. Meanwhile, President Lincoln appointed George B. McClellan (who had resigned from the Regular Army in 1857 to run railroads, first as chief engineer of the Illinois Central Railroad then as President of the Ohio and Mississippi Railroad), as commander of the Department of the Ohio. McClellan quickly moved to protect the railroads in his jurisdiction, sending troops and cannon to Marietta to protect the rail line to Cincinnati, as well as massing forces across the Ohio River to protect the B&O; in the event Virginia voted for secession. In response, Porterfield burned two bridges on the main B&O; line (at Farmington and Mannington) and one on the Parkersburg line. McClellan responded by sending B&O; freight agent Benjamin F. Kelley, who had moved to Wheeling in 1826 and commanded the local militia, to Grafton to protect the rail lines (as well as repair the bridges, which proved relatively easy because the underlying iron trusses had survived). Col. James Steedman and the 14th Ohio Regiment were also sent to protect Grafton, traveling via the railroad from Parkersburg. The pincer movement caused Porterfield to abandon Grafton on May 28 and move his 500 men to Philippi, where they received about 400 reinforcements. Kelley planned to attack the Confederates and drive them away from the vital railroads, and soon Brig. Gen. Thomas A. Morris of Indiana arrived, along with Col. Ebenezer Dumont and the 7th Indiana Infantry. The Confederates, realizing themselves vastly outnumbered, fled, leaving more than 750 muskets, ammunition, wagons, horses, medical supplies and tents behind, so the Battle of Philippi (West Virginia) would sometimes be called the \\"Philippi Races.\\" Gen. Lee soon replaced Porterfield with CSA Gen. Robert S. Garnett. However, Col. Kelley was shot in the chest during the battle, becoming one of the six Union casualties. Meanwhile, the Union victory secured Grafton and a regiment was stationed at Rowlesburg to protect the crucial Tray Run Viaduct.Toomey p. 48-54 On July 11, Gen. McClellan would defeat CSA Gen. Garnett's force at the Battle of Rich Mountain and thus secure the Staunton- Parkersburg Turnpike as far as Cheat Mountain.Toomey pp. 55-56 Kelley would thereafter face many challenges rebuilding western Virginia railroad infrastructure destroyed by Confederate bushwhackers, but as he recovered was promoted to Brigadier General and given command of the Railroad Division with headquarters at Grafton.Toomey pp. 78-79 The Northwestern Virginia railroad and its rail yard and machine shops at Grafton were also a probable objective of the Jones-Imboden Raid in April 1863. Raiders destroyed the 3-span bridge across the Monongahela River at Fairmont, West Virginia due north of Grafton (the largest on the line), but the rail yards protected by Mulligan's Brigade, the First and Eighth Maryland and Miner's Indiana battery were not attacked.Toomey pp. 151-152 Nor was well-defended Rowlesburg, nor Clarksburg, the largest Union supply base in western Virginia, defended by 5000 men in fortified positions.

The storyline was one of the dramatic events of Neighbours in 2014 and saw many characters' fates left in question, including long standing characters Paul Robinson (Stefan Dennis) and Lou Carpenter (Tom Oliver). The storyline was conceived following the success of 2013's wedding explosion and was shot in June 2014. Several wind and rain machines were used to create the storm and tornado effects. A promotional trailer for the storyline was released on 15 August 2014. The plot saw residents of Ramsay Street in Erinsborough prepare for a storm. As the storm set in, many residents were unaware of the eventual severity of the storm, especially when it developed into a tornado only minutes before it hit the area. Daniel Robinson (Tim Phillipps) and his girlfriend Amber Turner (Jenna Rosenow) were out in Amber's car taking photos of the storm when they were whipped up by the tornado; Daniel's uncle, Paul was also out driving looking for Daniel when the tornado hit. The power was lost to Ramsay Street and Georgia Brooks (Saskia Hampele) vanished from her house while she was recovering from a throat operation, leaving her family worried for her whereabouts. As the storm worsened, Lou Carpenter became trapped under a fallen beam at Harold's Store and his friend Susan Kennedy (Jackie Woodburne) was forced to perform an emergency tracheotomy on him when he began choking on a piece of food. Plot News reaches Erinsborough that a storm is approaching and the residents begin preparations. Mark Brennan (Scott McGregor) and his housemate Paige Smith (Olympia Valance) give into their growing feelings for one another and they have sex. Bailey Turner (Calen Mackenzie) watches the news reports with interest when a severe weather warning for Erinsborough and the surrounding areas is issued. His sister, Amber Turner (Jenna Rosenow), and her boyfriend Daniel Robinson (Tim Phillipps), head out into the storm to take photographs after Daniel argues with his uncle Paul Robinson (Stefan Dennis) over his lack of interest in climbing the career ladder. As the storm hits, Georgia Brooks (Saskia Hampele) goes missing suddenly along with her fianc√© Kyle Canning's (Chris Milligan) dog, Bossy. Kyle heads out into the storm looking for them when it suddenly develops into a tornado, while Paul goes looking for Daniel and Amber, seeking to make amends for their argument. Georgia and Bossy shelter with Kyle's grandmother, Sheila (Colette Mann), but Kyle remains missing. Daniel and Amber's car is swept up by the tornado, but they manage to escape and take refuge in the local garage. Paul's car is hits by a runaway skip. Daniel and Amber rescue Paul and they shelter together as the storm worsens. Daniel proposes to Amber and she accepts. At Harold's Store, Lou Carpenter (Tom Oliver) shelters from the tornado with his friend Susan Kennedy (Jackie Woodburne). The cooling system in the roof collapses, trapping Lou, while a piece of food he was eating becomes lodged in his throat. As a result, Susan is forced to perform an emergency tracheotomy to save his life, before he is rushed to hospital. Paul is treated for broken ribs and the cracking of his prosthetic leg. Georgia and Bossy find Kyle trapped in a portable toilet, that was swept up by the tornado. As the clean up operation begins, Lou inadvertently reveals to Matt Turner (Josef Brown) that his wife Lauren (Kate Kendall) kissed Brad Willis (Kip Gamblin). Matt and Brad's wife, Terese (Rebekah Elmaloglou), struggle to forgive their partners. Meanwhile, Daniel and Imogen Willis (Ariel Kaplan) rescue an injured wombat, and Nate Kinski (Meyne Wyatt), an Afghanistan war veteran, helps Susan overcome her post traumatic stress. Production =Conception and development= Executive producer Jason Herbison first teased the storyline in June 2014, telling Digital Spy's Daniel Kilkelly that the cast and crew were in the middle of filming \\"a major event\\" that would screen later in the year. He quipped \\"think natural disaster.\\" Herbison later said the natural disaster storyline would be \\"huge\\" and full of stunts and action. He added \\"The cast and crew are excited to get out there in the elements and do something different.\\" The storyline was conceived following the success of 2013's wedding explosion, which saw two characters die. Jackie Woodburne, who plays Susan Kennedy, commented that as many of the show's storylines were about human drama, it was good to mix things up every now and then. On 15 August 2014, it was announced that a tornado would hit Erinsborough, resulting in \\"long term repercussions for Ramsay Street\\", while a number of on-going storylines would \\"come to a head as the danger escalates\\". A few days later the first characters to be involved in the tornado plot were revealed to be newcomer Daniel Robinson (Tim Phillipps) and his girlfriend Amber Turner (Jenna Rosenow), whose \\"honeymoon period\\" comes to a halt by a revelation during the storm. As Amber and Daniel experienced their first full argument, the storm intensified and the tornado ripped the roof off their car, forcing them to seek shelter in the garage. At the same time, Daniel's uncle, Paul (Stefan Dennis), tried to find him and Amber, after realising that he overstepped the mark by telling Amber about Daniel's ex-girlfriend and how she inspired his tattoo. When the visibility got worse, Paul ended up hitting something with his car. Shortly after, he collided with runaway skip and had to be rescued by Daniel and Amber. When a shelving unit collapsed in the garage, Daniel pulled Amber out of the way and became \\"inspired by the near miss\\", so he proposed to her. It was later announced that long standing character Lou Carpenter (Tom Oliver), would be placed in a life-threatening situation when the tornado causes the roof of Harold's Store to collapse on him, while a piece of food becomes lodged in his throat. Fellow long standing character Susan Kennedy (Woodburne) was trapped with him and when she could not lift the beam to help, she called her husband, Karl (Alan Fletcher). Woodburne explained \\"Karl tells Susan she's done everything she can. He wants her to focus on keeping Lou as calm and comfortable as possible. He can't breathe, so that's all she can do.\\" However, Susan cannot stand back and watch Lou die, so she performed an emergency tracheotomy with guidance from Karl over the phone. Other characters caught up in the storm included Lauren Turner (Kate Kendall), who was forced to shelter with Brad Willis (Kip Gamblin). The \\"chemistry between them is stronger than ever\\" as they discussed their daughter and the kiss they shared a few months previously. Georgia Brooks (Saskia Hampele) and Bossy the dog went out into the storm, causing her fianc√©, Kyle Canning (Chris Milligan), to try to find them. However, they turned up safe and Kyle disappeared, with viewers being shown his abandoned mobile phone in a gutter. Milligan commented \\"People are panicking. They're worrying about what's happened to him in the storm.\\" =Filming= The scenes were filmed during the winter and Stefan Dennis commented that the shoot was very cold. It also rained during the week, which added to the effects. Several wind and rain machines were used to create the storm, while three large wind machines used at the same time helped to create the tornado. Large hoses were used to create the torrential rain. Various pieces of debris were also thrown around the sets. Of shooting the scenes, Dennis said, \\"In the past we've had an explosion or a fire or a car crash or a bomb, where as this was rain and hail and wind and tornado and things falling apart and buildings falling over - so there was an awful lot of special effects all at the same time.\\" Dennis stated that scenes brought back some bad memories of the time he was caught up in a real tornado in Queensland in the 1960s. Rosenow and Phillipps had to do some stunts during their scene in the car, and Rosenow admitted that they got soaked from all the rain. She also said that the scenes were \\"epic to film\\" and the night shoots were fun. Promotion and broadcast Neighbours released a promotional trailer for the storyline in Australia. The trailer features Daniel, Amber, Toadie, Paul, Karl and Imogen caught up in strong winds on Ramsay Street. The trailer ends with the tagline \\"The tornado is coming\\", which is then blown away by the winds. The first picture of the tornado's destruction was released exclusively to entertainment website Digital Spy. with five more promotional pictures released four days later. Neighbours also released behind the scenes videos, which showed how some of the scenes were shot. The week-long storyline began airing on 29 August 2014, with residents preparing for the storm, unaware of how severe it would be. It developed into a tornado in the following episode. In the UK the storyline will be broadcast from 15 September 2014. Reception =Ratings= The first episode of The Erinsborough Tornado was watched by 329,000 Australian viewers, making Neighbours the top rated program on digital multichannels that night. The second episode achieved 325,000 viewers in Australia, making Neighbours the third-highest rated show on digital multichannels. The third episode featuring the aftermath of the tornado made Neighbours the second most watched show on digital multichannels, with 304,000 Australians tuning in. =Critical response= The storyline received a mixed reaction from critics. Prior to the storyline airing, Siobhan Duck from the Herald Sun said it \\"sounds far-fetched\\". David Knox agreed with Duck, saying \\"congrats to the writers of Neighbours who have dug deep with a storyline that goes beyond the bizarre\\". While Em Rusciano, a social commentator for TV Week believed it was unrealistic. Her colleague, Stephen Downie, disagreed and argued, \\"compared with Toadie's (Ryan Moloney) ability to bed hot chicks, a tornado is probably one of the more believable Neighbours storylines.\\" A reporter for The Sun-Herald gave the storyline a mark of two and a half out of five. Ben Pobjie from The Sydney Morning Herald gave the storyline a mixed review. He thought no one would be bored while there was a tornado around, which was probably why Neighbours were > delivering a whole week of thrilling tornado action. Obviously, in these > modern times, a televised tornado that doesn't contain sharks seems a little > bit passe, but in Neighbours terms, it's big news, as Ramsay Street has > never before been hit by a tornado ‚Äì unless you count Madge's personality. > Boom! Pobjie observed that the episode broadcast on 1 September contained mostly \\"background rumbling and rain noises\\" and viewers had to wait until the end for \\"some hardcore storm opera\\". The Age's Craig Mathieson thought the premise of the storyline worked because it got him watching the show again, but it was not very compelling and there were too many predictable scenes. He commented, > for all the production effort involved ‚Äì there was a tidy master shot of an > upended power pole across a crushed car roof, and some nifty handheld camera > work ‚Äì what was disappointing about Tornado Week on Neighbours was how > neatly it was rolled out. The loss of normality tested the emotional > commitment of the characters, as they huddled together, shared confidences > and professed their love for each other. Not to sound churlish, but I wanted > Lou dead. He joked that an earthquake storyline in 2015 might bring back viewers. A contributor to Inside Soap included the storyline in their feature on \\"Soap's Top 10 stunts!\\". They thought it was not the \\"most convincing storm\\", but it was more exciting than the average Monday lunchtime. They also said, \\"The special effects weren't much cop, but super Susan's life-saving efforts are worth a few points. Is there anything she can't do?\\" In 2016, The Daily Telegraph ranked the storyline at Number Ten in the serial's Twelve Most Shocking Moments.

Biography Sturgeon was born about 1781, and was admitted to the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich as a cadet in May 1795. He was commissioned as second lieutenant in the Royal Artillery on 1 January 1796. He became lieutenant on 21 August 1797. He served in Pulteney's Ferrol Expedition in 1800, and in the Egyptian Expedition, and was wounded in the Battle of Alexandria on 13 March 1801. On 25 June 1803 Sturgeon was transferred to the Royal Staff Corps with the rank of captain, and became major in it on 1 June 1809. He served throughout the war in the Peninsula, always showing himself \\"a clever fellow,\\" as Lord Wellington described him (in a letter to Lord Liverpool, 19 December 1809). At the Siege of Ciudad Rodrigo, his effort and ability from the commencement of the siege were very conspicuous. He reconnoitred the breaches before the assault, and guided a column which was told off, at his suggestion, to make a demonstration on the right of the main breach. The column afterwards joined the stormers at that breach. Sturgeon was specially mentioned in Wellington's despatch, both for his services during the siege and for his construction of a bridge over the √Ågueda, which was an indispensable preliminary to it. He was made brevet lieutenant-colonel on 6 February 1812. Sturgeon was again specially mentioned in the Salamanca despatch, and was sent three months afterwards to make a bridge at Almaraz. In April 1813 he was placed in charge of the corps of guides, and the post-office and communications of the army. In February 1814 he took a prominent part in the bridging of the Adour, and was one of the officers praised by General Hope in his report for the zeal they showed in the execution of that project. C. J. Napier, who speaks of it as a \\"stupendous undertaking, which must always rank among the prodigies of war\\" in his War in the Peninsula, attributes its conception to Sturgeon. A few weeks afterwards, on 19 March, Sturgeon was killed by a bullet as he was riding through a vineyard during an action near Vic-en-Bigorre. Napier described him as \\"Skilled to excellence in almost every branch of war, and possessing a variety of accomplishments, he used his gifts so gently for himself and so usefully for the service that envy offered no bar to admiration, and the whole army felt painfully mortified that his merits were passed unnoticed in the public despatches\\". cites Napier According to Asenath Nicholson, Sturgeon married the daughter of famed Irish lawyer John Philpot Curran in Cork at the seat of a Mr. Penrose who owned the manor house Woodhill. After Sturgeon's death in battle, Irish poet and songwriter Thomas Moore composed his She is far from the land in honor of the unlucky couple. Some scholars believe that James Joyce has this Moore song in mind when he composed his short story The Dead.Nicholson, Asenath. Annals of the Famine in Ireland in 1847, 1848 and 1849.

It is a historical neighborhood for Orlando residents of African descent, and suffered greatly during the Jim Crow era of institutionalized racism. In 2015, the unemployment rate was reported as 23.8% and median household income was $15,493. The area was developed as a segregated African-American community. It was built in the 1880s by Orlando's fourteenth mayor, James B. Parramore, as a development \\"to house the blacks employed in the households of white Orlandoans.\\" While the historic east border of Parramore was Division Avenue (which marked the line where African-American residents living in the west could not cross into the east after sundown), Interstate 4 was constructed directly between Parramore and the prosperous and mostly white neighborhoods of central downtown, just east of Division Avenue and just west of the railroad tracks. Parramore's \\"official\\" boundaries (according to the city of Orlando) extend to Interstate 4, but the regions in between Division and the interstate are generally not residential, hosting such facilities as the Amway Center and the Bob Carr Performing Arts Centre. Smaller businesses are, of course, located on the west side of Division Avenue and include grocery stores, barber shops, and soul food restaurants. Many of the issues facing Parramore historically and currently can be traced to institutionalized or even unintentional neglect from the city and county governments, exacerbated by the fact that the city limits of Orlando do not extend all the way through, and therefore one block might be dependent on city services while being bordered on three sides by blocks that depend on county services. The western border of Parramore is Orange Blossom Trail, a thoroughfare where violence and other crimes are common. Orlando officially considers Parramore to be three separate neighborhoods: Lake Dot (between Colonial Drive and Amelia Street), Callahan (between Amelia Street and Central Boulevard), and Holden/Parramore (between Central Boulevard and Gore Street). All three are bounded on the east by Interstate 4 and on the west by Orange Blossom Trail. A soccer stadium, Orlando City Stadium, was built in Parramore along West Church Street between Glenn Lane and Terry Avenue.

He is best known for co-developing tow-in surfing with Laird Hamilton, Dave Kalama and a handful of other surfers in the mid-1990s. Early life Kerbox was born in 1956 in Indianapolis, Indiana. His family moved to Kailua, in eastern Oahu, in 1965. Surfing renown Shortly after having moved to Hawaii, in 1966, Kerbox began surfing. He was ranked in the top ten in 1977, 1978 and 1980. He won the 1978 World Cup at Sunset Beach and the 1980 Surfabout in Sydney. His development of tow-in surfing, along with fellow surfers Dave Kalama, Laird Hamilton and others, paved the way for surfers worldwide to catch waves which were previously thought to be out of reach, either because they were far from natural breaks like beaches and coasts or because they were too big. The first few tow-in sessions were done using Kerbox's 15-foot Zodiac motorboat. In more recent years, Kerbox has been an advocate for standup paddle boarding, also known as SUP. Tow-in surfing Surfers are towed out to a breaking wave via a PWC (personal watercraft, such as a Jet Ski) or a helicopter. The surfer holds a line attached to the motorized vehicle. He or she is then set into place, at which point he or she drops the line and surfs the wave. Prior to the development of the tow-in method, surfers were generally unable, on their own, to catch waves topping much more than 20'. With the advent of the tow-in method, surfers were able to catch waves two and three times that height, or even taller. Driver and surfer generally trade roles during a surfing session, which helps to build both rapport and trust in a situation which can quickly turn dangerous for both. Tow-in is generally thought to have revolutionized big wave surfing. Kerbox and other professional surfers were featured in Susan Casey's 2011 non-fiction volume The Wave. Modeling career In 1977, famed photographer Bruce Weber saw a photograph of Kerbox in a surfing magazine and persuaded him to come to New York City to try his hand at modeling. Kerbox subsequently modeled in major national advertising campaigns for Levi's, Ralph Lauren and United Airlines. Personal Kerbox has three sons.

The film stars Helen Twelvetrees, Robert Armstrong, Charles Bickford, Marjorie Peterson and Maude Eburne. The film was released on January 19, 1932, by RKO Pictures.  Plot  In New York City, chorus girl Flo slips into a speakeasy saying she is being followed and orders a drink. A man is buzzed into the speakeasy and it turns out he was following Flo. The two know each other and the man tells Flo must return with him to South America. Flashback to Sadie's Place in South America a few years ago. Flo is stranded and broke when the dance troupe's contract is canceled. Sadie introduces Flo to McTeague, a wildcatter with a large bankroll, to steal his money to get back to New York. When the theft is discovered McTeague drags Flo to where she lives. Flo had passed the money to her friend who assisted the theft by leaving and was to meet Flo back at her apartment. Flo soon realizes her friend has run off without her and is threatened by McTeague that he will have her thrown in prison. After pleading (while on the floor with some breast and leg exposed) McTeague is inspired to hire her as his housekeeper. She grudgingly accepts. McTeague takes Flo to his home in the jungle where he continues to harass her. Babe, a pilot and Flo's boyfriend, who left Flo for a two-week assignment the day that Flo met McTeague. Babe lands his plane that needs repairs at McTeague's. Babe is unaware of Flo's presence, but she knows he is there and sneaks to him that night. Sadie sent Babe to rescue Flo and they pretend to not know each other. Earlier during a night of binge drinking McTeague had told Flo he knew where the richest oil fields are and one day he would be king! Babe finds a chance to tell Flo that McTeague is a crook and they need to find the information on the oil. The next day Babe takes off on his seaplane but lets Flo know he'll be back for her. Before Babe leaves he says he'll probably see him again in Panama. McTeague seems puzzled about the reference and leaves Flo alone to visit the natives and before leaving gives her a loaded gun in case of trouble. Babe returns for Flo but won't leave until he find the papers regarding the oil. In his excitement over finding the papers he reveals HE is the criminal and would never marry her. Intent on getting away, Flo threatens to shoot Babe and does when he tries to leave. McTeague realizes the Panama reference and heads back home where he finds Babe dead. Flo believes she killed Babe and McTeague lets her believe it. He puts Babe's body in his plane and sinks it. McTeague sends Flo to New York. Back to the present, Flo learns she didn't kill Babe. It was McTeague who shot Babe through the heart. McTeague tries to explain why he let her believe she killed Babe. Flo refuses his offer of making it up to her. She tells McTeague she has no need of his money and points to a Rolls Royce parked on the street. She tells him it belongs to the richest oilman and its hers too. Flo leaves McTeague and approaches the car and asks the driver to let her get in and drive around the block. The driver refuses and she walks down the street forlornly. The owner of the car approaches and the driver tells the man he has something on his tie. The owner is McTeague and he tells the driver to follow Flo. Flo stops at a window to adjust her out of date clothing. She turns to walk away as the feet of a man are shown approaching, presumably McTeague. = Cast = *Helen Twelvetrees as Flo *Robert Armstrong as Babe *Charles Bickford as McTeague *Marjorie Peterson as Pearl *Maude Eburne as Sadie *Paul Hurst as Al *Reina Velez as Chacra *Hans Joby as Pilot  References   External links  * Category:1932 films Category:American films Category:American black-and-white films Category:English-language films Category:RKO Pictures films Category:Films directed by Ralph Murphy Category:Films made before the MPAA Production Code Category:1932 drama films Category:American drama films Category:Films scored by Arthur Lange ","title":"Panama Flo"},{"id":"43714969","text":"is a video game developed by Japanese video game company Felistella for the PlayStation Vita.

The game is the fourth entry in the Luminous Arc series, and the first in the series not developed by Imageepoch, who suffered financial troubles around the time of the game's development, ultimately leading to a 2015 bankruptcy filing. While Felistella made changes to the gameplay, it ultimately still retains the core gameplay mechanics of a tactical role-playing game.

Development The Luminous Arc series of games started as a trilogy of tactical role-playing games: Luminous Arc, Luminous Arc 2, and Luminous Arc 3. All three entries were developed by Imageepoch, published by Marvelous Entertainment, and released between 2007 and 2009 on the Nintendo DS handheld video game platform. Outside of some rumors of the series moving to the PlayStation Portable, which never materialized, the series laid dormant until 2014. The game was first announced in August 2014, as part of the \\"Sony Computer Entertainment Japan Asia Press Conference 2014\\", Sony's pre-Tokyo Game Show conference. However, the game would not be developed by Imageepoch, but rather Felistella, as Imageepoch was going through financial troubles that eventually lead to their closure in 2015. Similarly, Felistella had previously taken over in continuing the Summon Night tactical role-playing game series of games with Summon Night 5, on behalf of Flight-Plan, who had closed in 2012. The game's producer was announced to be Yoshifumi Hashimoto, producer of the Rune Factory series of video games. The game was released on August 6, 2015 in Japan. The game has not been announced for release in English or any other regions yet.

Early years Horace Wolcott Robbins was born in Mobile, Alabama, on 21 October 1842. His father came from Rocky Hill, Connecticut, descended from the first settlers there, and his mother came from Norwich, Connecticut. The family moved to Baltimore, Maryland when Robbins was aged six. He studied at Newton University in Baltimore, where he was given drawing lessons by August Weidenbach, a landscape painter from Germany. In 1859 Robbins studied under James McDougal Hart in New York City. He graduated from Newton University in 1860 and set up his own studio. During the American Civil War (1861‚Äì65) he served in the 22nd New York Regiment at the Battle of Harpers Ferry in 1862. Career Horace Robbins was elected to the Century Association in 1863 and became an associate of the National Academy of Design in 1864. He exhibited at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, Philadelphia (1862‚Äì64) and at the Boston Art Association and the Brooklyn Art Association. Hugh Bolton Jones studied under Robbins for a few months. In 1865 Robbins joined Frederic Edwin Church on a visit to Jamaica and the West Indies. He then traveled to England, the Netherlands and Paris, where he set up a studio and studied with Th√©odore Rousseau. He married Mary Phelps of Simsbury, Connecticut at the American Legation in Paris. He went on a sketching trip in Switzerland in 1866, spent more time in a studio in Paris, and returned to New York late in the fall of 1867. He settled into a routine of painting seven or eight landscapes each year. Soon after returning to America Robbins began spending his summers in the Farmington Valley in Connecticut, making paintings of the river and woods. He built a studio near that of his friend and teacher James Hart in the Adirondack Mountains of upstate New York. He joined the American Watercolor Society, Artists' Fund Society and New York Etching Club. Robbins was elected a full member of the National Academy of Design in 1878, and in 1882 became the Academy's recording secretary. He became a trustee of the New York School of Applied Design for Women and a fellow at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. While continuing to paint, in 1890 Robbins attended Columbia Law School. In 1892 he was admitted to the New York State Bar. Horace Wolcott Robbins died in 1904 in New York City. Work Robbins specialized in watercolor landscapes, although he also painted in oils. His pictures of the White Mountains showed a picturesque pastoral countryside, civilized through roads, cleared hills and fields, but far from the squalor of the city. A biographer in 1878 wrote, \\"There was a slight mannerism in Mr. Robbin's early works, which he appears to have dropped entirely within a few years, and is rapidly gaining in an independence and originality that much better becomes him.\\" An 1881 biographer said, \\"His works are spirited and refined, his artistic sympathies are in line with those of Mr. F.E. Church and Mr. Sanford Gifford, and his style is descriptive and original. The Adirondack Museum, New York has a collection of his work.

The images were initially believed to have been obtained via a breach of Apple's cloud services suite iCloud, or a security issue in the iCloud API which allowed them to make unlimited attempts at guessing victims' passwords. Apple claimed in a press release that access was gained via spear phishing attacks. The event, which media outlets and internet users referred to under names such as the \\"fappening\\" (a portmanteau of \\"fap\\", a slang term for masturbation, and \\"happening\\") and \\"Celebgate\\", was met with a varied reaction from the media and fellow celebrities. Critics felt that the distribution of the images was a major invasion of privacy for their subjects, while some of the allegedly depicted subjects denied their authenticity. The leak also prompted increased concern from analysts surrounding the privacy and security of cloud computing services such as iCloud‚Äîwith a particular emphasis on their use to store sensitive, private information. Etymology \\"The Fappening\\" is a jocular portmanteau coined by combining the words \\"happening\\" and \\"fap\\", an internet slang term for masturbation. Though the term is a vulgarism originating either with the imageboards where the pictures were initially posted or Reddit, it didn't take long before the event was referred to by this name even in respected media such as the BBC. The term has received criticism from journalists like Radhika Sanghani of The Daily Telegraph and Toyin Owoseje of the International Business Times, who said that the term not only trivialized the leak, but also, according to Sanghani, \\"[made] light of a very severe situation\\"; both articles used the term extensively to describe the event, including in the headlines. \\"Celebgate\\" is a reference to the Watergate scandal.  Procurement and distribution  The images were obtained via the online storage offered by Apple's iCloud platform for automatically backing up photos from iOS devices, such as iPhones. Apple later reported that the victims' iCloud account information was obtained using \\"a very targeted attack on user names, passwords and security questions\\", such as phishing and brute-force attack guessing. It was initially believed that the images were obtained using an exploit in the Find My iPhone service. Court documents from 2014 indicated that one user created a fake email account called \\"appleprivacysecurity\\" to ask celebrities for security information. The photos were being passed around privately for at least a couple of weeks before their public release on August 31. There are claims that unreleased photos and videos exist. The hacker responsible for the leak, who described themselves as being a \\"collector\\", distributed the leaked images on the image boards 4chan and Anon-IB in exchange for Bitcoin. Ultimately, the images were widely circulated online via other channels, including Imgur and Tumblr. Celebrity gossip blogger Perez Hilton also re-posted some of the photos on his blog, but soon took them down and issued an apology, saying \\"he had acted in bad taste\\". A major center of activity was the link-sharing website Reddit, where a subreddit was created for sharing the photos; in a single day, it amassed over 100,000 followers. Reddit administrators were criticized for allowing this to take place in an alleged violation of their anti-doxing rules. As McKayla Maroney claimed to be under 18 at the time the photos of her were taken, Reddit staff took photos of her down and warned that anyone re-posting them, or underage photos of Liz Lee which had been circulating prior to this incident, would be permanently banned from the site and could be prosecuted for distributing child pornography. On September 7, citing copyright issues, Reddit banned its TheFappening subreddit, also saying the workload of dealing with them had become too much. Reddit banned another subreddit named \\"Fappening\\" on the same day.  Content and affected celebrities  Kate Upton and Justin Verlander confirmed the authenticity of leaked photos The original release contained photos and videos of more than 100 individuals that were allegedly obtained from file storage on hacked iCloud accounts, including some the leakers claimed were A-list celebrities. Shortly after the photos were leaked, several affected celebrities issued statements to either confirm or deny the photos' authenticity. Celebrities who have confirmed the photos' authenticity include Jennifer Lawrence (confirmed by her publicist), Kate Upton and her husband Justin Verlander (confirmed by Upton's lawyer), Mary Elizabeth Winstead (confirmed on Twitter), Jessica Brown Findlay (confirmed by spokesman), Kaley Cuoco (confirmed via Instagram), and Kirsten Dunst, who also criticized the iCloud service. Jill Scott confirmed on Twitter that one of the leaked photos was of her while stating that another was fake. Celebrities who have denied the photos' authenticity include Ariana Grande and Yvonne Strahovski. Olympic gymnast McKayla Maroney initially denied the images' authenticity on Twitter, then later confirmed that the photos were legitimate while also stating she was underage at the time they were taken. Victoria Justice denied that the photos were authentic but later stated on Twitter that she was pursuing legal actions and found the leak to be a massive invasion of not just her privacy, but of the privacy of all the celebrities affected by the leak. Reports in October indicated that Nick Hogan was the first male star to be directly targeted by hackers; however, Hogan denied the pictures' authenticity. According to security expert Nik Cubrilovic, in addition to the photographs, other personal information such as text messages, calendars, address books, phone call logs and any other data stored on their phones and backed up to the service were also likely stolen. On September 20, 2014, a second batch of similar private photos of additional celebrities was leaked by hackers. On September 26, 2014, a third batch was also leaked, which was dubbed as \\"The Fappening 3\\".  Reaction  Actress Lena Dunham pleaded on Twitter for people not to view the pictures, saying doing so \\"violat[es] these women over and over again. It's not okay.\\" Actress Emma Watson condemned not only the release of the photos, but also \\"the accompanying comments [on social media] that show such a lack of empathy.\\" Actors Seth Rogen and Lucas Neff also spoke out against the hackers and people who posted the pictures. Justin Verlander, then a pitcher for the Detroit Tigers, told the media prior to a game against the Cleveland Indians that he keeps his private life private and would rather focus on the Tigers' race with the Kansas City Royals for the AL Central title than be a distraction to his teammates.Justin Verlander addresses scandal ESPN.com (September 2, 2014) Security analysts have stated that the breach could have been prevented through the use of two-factor authentication, while a Forbes writer recommended turning off the iCloud \\"Photo Stream\\" feature (which uploads photos taken with an iOS device to iCloud servers automatically) entirely. Apple CEO Tim Cook announced the company would increase security for iCloud In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Apple CEO Tim Cook stated that in response to the leaks, the company planned to take additional steps to protect the privacy and security of iCloud users in the future. Notifications will be provided whenever data is restored to a device via iCloud and after logging into iCloud via a web browser, in addition to existing notifications when a user's iCloud password is changed. Additionally, Apple will broaden and encourage the use of two-factor authentication in future versions of its software and operating systems, such as the then-upcoming iOS 8. In conclusion, he emphasized that \\"we want to do everything we can do to protect our customers, because we are as outraged if not more so than they are.\\" Jennifer Lawrence contacted authorities and her publicist has stated that the authorities will prosecute anyone who posts leaked images of her. Forbes columnist Joseph Steinberg questioned whether the reactions by law enforcement and technology providers indicated that celebrities were being treated differently from ordinary Americans, which, in the case of law enforcement, may be illegal. On October 1, 2014, Google was threatened with a lawsuit by lawyer Martin Singer for $100 million on behalf of unnamed victims of the leaks, alleging that Google had refused to respond to requests for the images to be removed from its platforms (including Blogger and YouTube), \\"[failing] to act expeditiously, and responsibly to remove the images\\", and \\"knowingly accommodating, facilitating, and perpetuating the unlawful conduct\\". In an interview with Vanity Fair, Lawrence called the leak a \\"sex crime\\" and a \\"sexual violation\\" and added, \\"anybody who looked at those pictures, you're perpetuating a sexual offense and you should cower with shame\\". This view was contrasted by another victim of the hack, Emily Ratajkowski, who told GQ, \\"A lot of people who were victims of [the hack] said anyone who looks at these pictures should feel guilty, but I just don't think that's fair\\", and \\"I'm not sure that anyone who Googles it is necessarily a criminal. I think the people who stole the photos are\\".  Investigation  The FBI said that it was \\"aware of the allegations concerning computer intrusions and the unlawful release of material involving high profile individuals, and is addressing the matter.\\" Similarly, Apple stated that it had been investigating whether a security breach of the iCloud service was responsible for the leaked photographs, as per the company's commitment to user privacy. On September 2, 2014, Apple reported that the leaked images were the result of compromised accounts, using \\"a very targeted attack on user names, passwords and security questions, a practice that has become all too common on the Internet\\". In October 2014, The FBI searched a house in Chicago and seized several computers, cell phones and storage drives after tracking the source of a hacking attack to an IP address linked to an individual named Emilio Herrera. A related search warrant application mentioned eight victims with initials A.S., C.H., H.S., J.M., O.W., A.K., E.B., and A.H., which supposedly point to stolen photos of Abigail Spencer, Christina Hendricks, Hope Solo, Jennette McCurdy, Olivia Wilde, Anna Kendrick, Emily Browning, and Amber Heard respectively. According to law enforcement officials, Herrera was just one of several people under investigation and the FBI carried out various searches across the country. =Guilty pleas= In March 2016, 36-year-old Ryan Collins of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, agreed to plead guilty to one count of unauthorized access to a protected computer to obtain information resulting in an 18-month sentence. While no victims were named in the court documents, numerous media outlets connected Collins' case to The Fappening. During the investigation, it was found that Collins phished by sending e-mails to the victims that looked like they came from Apple or Google, warning the victims that their accounts might be compromised and asking for their account details. The victims would enter their passwords, and Collins gained access to their accounts, downloading e-mails and iCloud backups.Prosecutors find that ‚ÄòFappening‚Äô celebrity nudes leak was not Apple‚Äôs fault March 15, 2016, Techcrunch In October 2016, Collins was sentenced to 18 months in prison.Hacker who stole nude photos of celebrities gets 18 months in prison October 27, 2016, The Guardian In August 2016, 28-year-old Edward Majerczyk of Chicago, Illinois, agreed to plead guilty to a similar phishing scheme, although authorities believe he worked independently and he was not accused of selling the images or posting them online. On January 24, 2017, Majerczyk was sentenced to nine months in prison and was ordered to pay $5,700 in restitution to cover the counseling services of one unnamed celebrity victim. Emilio Herrera, also from Chicago, had first been named in the press in 2014; he pleaded guilty to one count of unauthorized access to a protected computer to obtain information in October 2017. Herrera had accessed the accounts of unnamed celebrities and others but was not accused of being involved in leaking or sharing the photos and videos he obtained. He was sentenced to 16 months in jail in March 2018. In April 2018, 26-year-old George Garofano of North Branford, Connecticut, pleaded guilty to one count of unauthorized access to a protected computer to obtain information. Garofano's attorney said he had been led into the phishing scheme by criminals. On August 29, 2018, a federal court sentenced Garofano to eight months in prison. On October 22, 2018, Christopher Brannan, a former Virginia teacher, became the fifth man to be convicted in relation to the hacking. Brannan pled guilty to federal charges of aggravated identity theft and unauthorized access to a protected computer. Through a phishing expedition, he hacked more than 200 people. In addition to his celebrity victims, Brannan targeted his underage sister-in- law, as well as teachers and students at the school where he used to teach. Brannan was sentenced to 34 months in prison on March 1, 2019.

Digital reproductions. Historical background The year in which the novella was written ‚Äì 1908 ‚Äì was the 45th anniversary of the Polish January Uprising against the Russian Empire. Therefore, Gloria Victis is perceived as a tribute to the fallen and to all the people who fought for independent Poland. Because of the revolution in Russia and the cease of censorship resulting from it , Orzeszkowa was able to write Gloria Victis without using superfluous metaphors, so that it could be easily understood.Encyklopedia szkolna - jƒôzyk polski, ed. Agnieszka Nawrot, Krak√≥w 2009 Summary The novella, which tackles the problem of the January Uprising, is narrated by nature (wind, trees and flowers). It all begins with wind, which after 100 years of travelling around the world came to see his old friends at a glade by the forest. When he reached them, they told him that he missed an important event. When he heard that, he started strolling around the place. He felt the smell of blood and heard the echoes of the killed. After that he asked his friends about the reason of all this and they told him about the uprising. One day a division of insurgents arrived at the glade and set a camp there. They were young people who were proud to fight for their homeland. The leader of the division was Romuald Traugutt ‚Äì a heroic Polish general who was executed for actions connected with the retrieving of Polish independence. The trees liked few of the insurgents and the biggest attention was given to Mary≈õ and Jagmin. Mary≈õ lived nearby and was known to the trees. He had a sister ‚Äì Anielka and Jagmin was his friend. Before the uprising Jagmin and Anielka became very close to each other and the day when the boys decided to join the uprising was one of the saddest in the life of Anielka. The battles began and the insurgents were winning. Their victory didn‚Äôt last long and the camp was finally attacked by the Russians. The insurgents were fighting hard, but the enemy was too strong. Mary≈õ and Jagmin died. The first one because of the wound he received, the second one because he got shot when trying to help Mary≈õ. This place was forgotten by everyone and only once the mass grave was visited. It was Anielka who came to see the place where her loved ones died and after a short visit she left the glade never to return. The wind was weeping for almost all the story, but when the flowers finished the story it left the glade screaming ‚Äì ‚ÄúGloria victis!‚Äù. Orzeszkowa Eliza, Gloria victis, Warszawa 1986 The Title ‚ÄúGloria victis‚Äù is a phrase strictly connected with the plot and means ‚ÄúGlory to the vanquished‚Äù. It is the opposite of the Latin phrase ‚ÄúVae victis‚Äù ‚Äì ‚Äúwoe to the vanquished‚Äù. Repetytorium maturzysty - j. polski, ed.

Founded in 1973 by Jack and Dolores Cakebread in Rutherford, California, the winery produces approximately 200,000 cases of wine per year. History Jack and Dolores Cakebread met in high school in Oakland, California and were married in 1950. After Jack completed his military service during the Korean War, the couple settled in Oakland with their three sons, Steve, Dennis, and Bruce. Jack Cakebread, who had worked on his family's orchard in Contra Costa County, worked with his father at Cakebread's Garage in Oakland. He also developed an interest in photography. In 1972, while taking photographs for Nathan Chroman's book Treasury of American Wines, Jack and Dolores Cakebread offered to purchase the Sturdivant Ranch in Rutherford, California. The Sturdivant family accepted their offer, and soon the Cakebreads were attending winemaking classes at the University of California, Davis, where they learned from local vintners Louis M. Martini and Robert Mondavi. Within a year the Cakebreads planted their first Sauvignon Blanc on AxR1 rootstock. During the first few years, Jack and Dolores divided their time between the garage and establishing the winery on the weekends. In 1974, the original winery was completed and Cakebread Cellars produced its first wine: 157 cases of 1973 Chardonnay. The following year, they crushed their first Cabernet Sauvignon grapes at Keenan Winery. In 1976, they released the first Cakebread Cellars Cabernet Sauvignon ('74 vintage), and their first vintage of Zinfandel, produced at Las Domingus Ranch on Howell Mountain. The original winery was enlarged in 1977, and Mondavi enologist Larry Wara was hired as a wine consultant. The following year, Cakebread produced three Cabernets for '78 vintage: JTL1, Napa Valley, and Lot 2. In 1979, Bruce Cakebread joined the family business as a full-time winemaker after graduating from the University of California, Davis. That year, five fermenters were installed outside the front barn. Cakebread Cellars front entrance The 1980s saw significant growth at Cakebread Cellars. In 1980, a new winery building was constructed. Designed by architect William Turnbull, Jr., the building's design won awards from the California Architects Association in 1981, the East Bay Architects Association in 1982, and the AIA & Wood Council in 1983. Cakebread also produced its first Rutherford Reserve vintage in 1980. The following year, the winery's first employee Tod Dexter was hired; he would stay with Cakebread for eight years, and then go on to start his own wine label, Dexter Winery, in Morington Penn near Melbourne. In 1982, Jack Cakebread acquired an adjacent 12-acre ranch and planted Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc. After introducing state-of-the-art neutron probe technology to maximize vineyard production, Cakebread Cellars began marketing internationally in the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, Hong Kong, and Singapore in 1984. In 1985, the Cakebread's remodeled their 100-year-old winery home with a state-of-the-art kitchen and comfortable guest accommodations. That year, Jim May became Cakebread's first resident chef. In 1986, Dennis Cakebread joined the family business, managing finance, sales, and marketing. In the fall of 1986, Cakebread hosted its first American Harvest Workshop to showcase prominent chefs and artisan food purveyors from around the country. The following year, the American Harvest Workshop became an annual fall event. Cakebread Cellars wine tasting During the 1990s, Cakebread Cellars underwent significant growth and established its reputation as a producer of world-class wines. In 1990, Jack Cakebread served as president of the Napa Valley Vintners Association, and the following year Cakebread produced their first Merlot. Cakebread's early success built a loyal following and enabled Cakebread to continue purchasing top vineyards. Soon their sons Bruce and Dennis joined the family business full-time. In 1994, they introduced their first Pinot Noir and Rubaiyat. That year they completed replanting of all 75 acres damaged from phylloxera. Due to the development of sub-AVA of Oakville and Rutherford, the 1993 and 1994 vintages of Rutherford Reserve were changed to \\"reserve\\". In 1995, Cakebread introduced Three Sisters and Benchland Select, and purchased a 60-acre former apple orchard in Anderson Valley and began developing this vineyard for Pinot Noir and Chardonnay. In 1996, the winery started purchasing fruit in Carneros from Foster Road and then Tinsley Ranch. The following year, the third phase of the winery expansion project was completed, allowing for further expansion with the purchase of an adjacent winery and vineyard. Also that year, Dennis Cakebread served as president of the Napa Valley Vintner Association. In 1998, Cakebread purchased 200 acres on Howell Mountain and began developing these hillside vineyards into what would become Dancing Bear Ranch. Cakebread Cellars 2002 Cabernet Sauvignon The past fifteen years have seen the continued expansion and refinement of Cakebread Cellars. In 2000, Cakebread completed its Oakville winery facility. The following year, the family purchased the adjacent 1.7 acre McKay parcel. In 2002, Bruce Cakebread became president and chief operating officer of the company, and Julianne Laks became winemaker. The first vintage of Dancing Bear Ranch was produced that year. In 2003, Cakebread acquired the 27-acre Foster Road Vineyard in Carneros and the 40-acre Maple Lane Vineyards in Calistoga. In 2004, University of California, Davis graduate Toby Halkovich was hired as viticulturist. That year, the winery purchased Tinsley Ranch in Carneros, the Cuttings Wharf Road Vineyard, and Suscol Springs Ranch in southeast Napa. In 2006, the winery purchased its Milton Road property in Carneros, and the following year the east addition to the main building was completed with tasting areas and lab space. In 2008, Cakebread acquired its Arroyo Creek Vineyard. In 2009, Dennis Cakebread became vice-chairman of the Board of Directors, and the Suscol Springs Vineyard produced its first commercial wines. The following year, Bruce Cakebread served as president of the Napa Valley Vintners. In 2012, Cakebread purchased Annahala Vineyard in Anderson Valley. That same year, the company initiated plans to pave a new parking lot, relocate the bottling line, add new storage space, and build a new visitor facility. Vineyards Cakebread Cellars currently produces wines from eleven estate vineyard properties located throughout Napa Valley and one location in the Anderson Valley. Following the initial purchase of the first 22-acre parcel in Rutherford in 1972, the family acquired additional vineyard parcels throughout Napa Valley and the North Coast.

The film stars Carmen Miranda, Dircinha Batista and Aloysio de Oliveira. It was Miranda's last film in Brazil, before she moved to Hollywood.Splendors of Latin Cinema  Plot  In Banana da Terra the actor Oscarito plays a man in charge of a publicity campaign for bananas who decides to kidnap the queen of Bananol√¢ndia, played by Dircinha Batista. She is taken to Rio and promptly falls in love with character played by Alo√≠sio de Oliveira, a member of Carmen Miranda's backing group, the Bando da Lua. The action unfolds in the glamorous realm of Rio's radio station and casinos, thus providing the perfect pretext for inclusion of a variety of musical numbers.  Production  In 1939 Sonofilmes released the musical comedy Banana da Terra, which like many of its musical predecessors, belonged to the tradition of carnival films that included hit songs and were released just before the annual celebrations. According to the Jornal do Brasil newspaper, Banana da Terra was to premiere on 10 February at the MGM-owned cinemas in Rio and S√£o Paulo, the Pedro II cinema in Petr√≥polis, in the state of Rio de Janeiro, and the Guarani cinema in Salvador, Bahia, as well as in Recife, Porto Alegre and Ribeir√£o Preto. Negotiations were also underway to show the film in the state capitals Curitiba and Belo Horizonte. Thanks to the links between Alberto Byington Jr, Wallace Downey's associate, and Hollywood, this Sonofilmes production was distributed by MGM in Brazil, and consequently premiered in the luxurious Metro Passeio in Rio. Banana da Terra proved to be a great commercial success and to markedly influence the chanchada tradition, not least by combining self-deprecating humour with a tongue-in-cheek critique of Hollywood clich√©s. The plot of movie, first and foremost a construct to link together the various musical numbers, revolves around the imaginary Pacific island of Bananol√¢ndia, an allegorical tropical paradise, which was faced with the problem of a surplus of bananas. In this self-parodic comedy Brazil adopts the reflected identity of the exotic island of plenty. These include \\"A Jardineira\\" by Benedito Lacerda and Humberto Porto, sung by Orlando Silva, which proved to be the carnival smash of the 1939 celebrations, and \\"Sei que √© covardia\\" by Ata√∫flo Alves and Claudionor Cruz. Banana da Terra is best remembered for Carmen Miranda's rendition of the Dorival Caymmi song \\"O que √© que a baiana tem?\\", dresses in the \\"baiana\\" costume, in keeping with the song's lyrics. It is said that the composer went to Miranda's house where he taught her performance. But it was Miranda who made the look her own and used it to launch her international career as the embodiment of a pan-Latin American identity. Banana da Terra was to be Miranda's last Brazilian film; it was when performing its hit song \\"O que √© que a baiana tem?\\" at Rio's Urca casino that she was \\"discovered\\" by the show business impresario Lee Shubert and taken to Broadway, and subsequently to Hollywood.

Okiemute invites them both to eat at the restaurant while Akpos also experiences another culture shock when he sees a lady footing the bill on a couple's date. Akpos is also amazed to hear some disaffected customers complaining about the restaurant's service in Nigerian pidgin. They discuss foreign baby droppers who come to give birth in the U.S. On sighting a beautiful lady, Kimberly (Karlie Redd), Akpos reveals his intention to date her but Okiemute cautions him about her strict father. They drive to the beautiful residence of a Nigerian friend in diaspora, Uncle Wilson (Kesse Jabiri). They are welcomed by Wilson's wife (Vivica A. Fox), who instantly recognizes their accent. They adore the residence's interior design before being welcomed by Wilson. They experience yet another culture shock when they see Wilson performing traditional African female roles (food preparation, babysitting, housekeeping etc.) while his wife gives him instructions. Akpos, eager to displays his feelings tries to confront Wilson but is restrained by Richard. After narrating their love story, Akpos has the biased opinion that Wilson is under a spell from his wife. Akpos tries to convince Wilson that his wife's \\"domination\\" is abnormal. Akpos finally decides to leave the house, almost revealing his annoyance to Wilson's wife but for Richard's timely intervention. They attend a Sustainable earth conference in which the same minister they met is also attending. Akpos makes a weird but humorous comment to everyone's surprise. At the lunch, they sight Kimberly and Akpos urges Richard into starting a conversation. It turns out well despite Akpos' blunders and Richard's interference. She gives Richard a contact and they leave just in time for her father, Odiye (Richard Mofe Damijo), a U.S.-based Nigerian who owns the restaurant, to show up. Akpos sometimes disturbs Richard and affects his concentration in their residence. Richard decides to visit the restaurant again to await Kimberly but Akpos shows up unexpectedly. He persuades Richard that he will be supportive of his date. After ordering food, he takes the initiative by signaling to Kimberly when she arrives. Unaware that they were visitors and not residents, Kimberly mentions Akpos' comment at the conference and her father's interest to meet him and possibly engage him in an stand-up comedy contract. Richard tries to discourage the proceedings but Akpos maintains an interest and requests further information on the remuneratory aspect of the proposed contract, despite knowing it was a violation of his visa to work during their visit. After the contract is awarded and Akpos commences work at the restaurant, he narrates it to Richard who cautions him that it was illegal to work and might be arrested if discovered. Undaunted by the risks, he refuses to quit the job. While leaving for their residence in a taxi, it dawns on Richard that he has left his wallet with cash behind. As a result of their situation, Akpos recommends that they flee on dropping from the taxi. Unknown to them, the driver understood their conversation and threatens them with a gun before dropping them half-naked on the streets in annoyance. Kimberly and her father comes to their aid and drives them home. They are treated with good hospitality while Odiye narrates his family story, citing his late American wife, Joyce (Kimberly's mother), ordeal and journey from Nigeria to the United States, advising them not to be discouraged by setbacks in life. Kimberly prepares dinner and invites them all to the table. They meet for the first time and are introduced to Odiye's immigration lawyer, Clara (Lynn Whitfield). They converse and Akpos makes additional blunders but succeeds in making them laugh. Clara, impressed by Akpos' sense of humour decides to see him perform at the restaurant. While leaving for their residence, Akpos reveals his interest in dating Clara to Kimberly. Kimberly reveals that Clara is much older than she looks, but Akpos doesn't give up on starting a date with her. Richards tries to make romantic advances but Kimberly reminds him that they are still under her father's watchful eye. Richard and Akpos drives home in the car. Later, Akpos proceeds to date Clara and succeeds in winning her affection. He teaches her some Nigerian pidgin and slangs. Richard also gets along well with Kimberly on a date but unlike Akpos, he reveals their visitor status in the United States. On another day, Richard converses with his mother and uncle James via Skype and is surprised to learn that his former girlfriend, Ese is assisting his mother at home, at work and making future wedding arrangements. He tries to convince his mother that they have ended their relationship and mentions his new found love, describing Kimberly. When Akpos accompanies Richard to collect a portraiture gift for Kimberly and waits outside, Akpos disappears before he comes out, having strolled into a gang of street gamblers. As soon as Richards notices his sudden disappearance, he searches for him. Akpos has already engaged himself in a gambling session by the time Richards finds him. On discovery, Richard cautions him that the gang of gamblers might be prone to committing crime. Akpos convinces him to go and meet Kimberly at home and leave him with his gambling as everything will be fine. Richard reluctantly leaves. Kimberly notifies Richard on phone about their dating arrangements and her intentions to Skype with his mother when she gets home. Richard gives her an incentive to proceed as planned. Kimberly enters the house and awaits Richard. Meanwhile, Akpos gambling spree has gone sour and after deciding to leave with his winning, he is threatened with a gun by one of the gamblers. Other members of gang try to restrain the attacker while Akpos displays his aggressive behaviour and breaks a bottle on his head, threatening and chasing his attacker as a defensive measure. The attacker and his gang flees to avoid the dangerous scene when the cops' siren signals are heard nearby. At Richard's residence, Kimberly decides to pick the Skype video call. On sighting Richard's mum, she introduces herself. Richard's mum, not familiar with the American way of greeting, considers Kimberly rude. Ese, who happened to be nearby immediately describes herself in the mum's presence that she is Richard's wife. Richard's mum leaves the conversation to attend to her cooking and tells Ese not to tamper with the laptop. Ese agrees but continues the Skype video conversation and tries to convince Kimberly that she will be used and dumped by Richard. She proceeds by showing her proof of their \\"marriage\\" with intimate pictures of her with Richard. Kimberly becomes heartbroken and drives away from the house in tears. She refuses to pick Richard's calls and hints him of her discovery of his secret past. After fleeing the gambling scene, Akpos is arrested by the cops before he reaches home. He manages to notify Richard on phone requesting Clara's intervention on the case. Richard reprimands him for his actions and agrees to involve Clara. Akpos leaves the phone hanging and barely ends his conversation in an attempt to flee erotic advances from a prison inmate. Clara approaches Akpos in the cell and tries to clarify the situation, discussing with the legal officials as a representative lawyer. In the middle of Akpos conversation with the officials, it is discovered that Akpos also violated his visa, making his case more severe and punishable by law. He is finally granted bail and scheduled for a court hearing. In court, he persists in defending his actions and commits more blunders in the process. He is cautioned to keep silent by Richard or risk going to Jail. Clara also reiterated that he keep silent while she spoke. To avoid prosecution, the presiding Judge agreed that the total income Akpos has earned will be sufficient as compensation for his legal and visa violation if the money is donated to charity under supervision. In order to avert further violation pending his stay in the United States, Clara decides to keep him under her watchful eye and takes him to her house to cook him dinner. Akpos expresses his appreciation for her timely intervention and falls in love with her. He requests for her bedroom and carries her inside. Afterwards, Clara overhears Akpos conversing on phone implying that his relationship with Clara will facilitate his green card and American citizenship. Clara becomes furious that Akpos might have taken advantage of her influential position and after reminiscing about the recent past, she ejects Akpos immediately from her house and threatens to call the police if he refuses to leave. Akpos leaves. Richard, on the other hand has been disturbed since Kimberly stopped communicating. He attempts to clarify the situation and explain to Kimberly but her father, Odiye intervenes and orders him to leave his daughter alone, reiterating the stereotyped bad image many young Nigerian men portray to the Western world. Odiye comforts his daughter when Richard leaves. Richard in an attempt to converse with his mother on Skype, sees Ese and talks to her angrily about her interference in his relationship with Kimberly. He also learns about Akpos' eviction from Clara's house. Akpos reluctantly donates his earnings to charity. As their departure date to Nigeria draws nearer, they make additional tours in the country and take photographs. At the airport, as the men prepare to board their flight back to Nigeria, they are surprised to see Kimberly and Clara who after further clarifications had both made up their minds to follow them back to Nigeria to meet their relatives.

Most critics note that the comedy in the film is filled with cliches and stereotypes, and that the film seems like a remake of Osuofia in London (2003), the Jenifa franchise, or a hybrid of both. Nollywood Reinvented gave a 24% rating, commenting: \\"For the length of the approximately 2hr long movie, there was a competent joke in every part for at least the first hour and a half. But that's about where the greatness of the movie begins and ends. There is hardly any originality or attempt to make it less predictable\\". The Daily Independent comments that the comedy in the film is filled with clich√©s and stereotypes, but a proper story eventually emerge. It concludes that \\"he [Ayo Makun] has sent a strong message with this effort that a good quality comedy film can be made\\". Wilfred Okiche of YNaija cited that the film has \\"filmmaking errors and production glitches\\", but admits to the film being funny. He says Ayo Makun isn't \\"a rounded actor\\", calls the film an hybrid of Osuofia in London (2003) and The Return of Jenifa (2011), and concludes: \\"...there is no single, continuous plot but a series of sketches and happenstances cobbled together to make up a movie. The pacing moves breezingly enough to obscure the lack of a substantial story but it does little to hide the deficiency with continuity as the scenes just clash noisily into the other. The jokes are gold‚Äîthough failing unsurprisingly only when AY attempts stand up. 30 Days in Atlanta is funny, but poorly made\\". Today's Woman magazine gave the film 3 out of 5 stars, commenting: \\"The beginning scenes were cliche, predictable and reminded me a little too much of Osuofia in London. However, once we passed this phase, the movie was in actual fact hilarious. Babatunde Lasaki on 360Nobs gave 6 out of 10 stars and comments: \\"A usual story retold in an unusually funny manner. Definitely not a contender for innovation or ingenuity, but I will say a comic relief from the many bland productions of 2014. 30 Days in Atlanta is a fine movie, not a MUST see, but definitely worth two hours of comedic fun. Obehi Bassey of True Nollywood Stories states that Ayo Makun's acting skills is non-existent, says the film is needlessly dragged, but concludes: \\"30 days in Atlanta remains a movie worth seeing. Entertaining from the get go, it doesn't let go. It's a comedy that is funny without being annoying and melodramatic. Plus it has some really memorable scenes. Kemi Filani comments: \\"if you are having a bad day and you need something to get you up and alive, 30 Days in Atlanta is the movie for ya....kudos to comedian AY\\". =Box office= 30 Days in Atlanta went on to break all box-office records for 2014. Awards The film received 10 nominations at the 2014 Golden Icons Academy Movie Awards.

It was written some time between 1733 and 1743, and published in 1743 in Nancy by former king of Poland Stanis≈Çaw Leszczy≈Ñski. While Leszczy≈Ñski himself claimed authorship, some modern scientists believe it was rather ghost written by someone of his retinue, possibly Mateusz Bia≈Ç≈Çozor. One of the most important political works of Enlightenment in Poland, it is possible that the French translation of the work, La Voie Libre, influenced Jean Jacques Rousseau. Heavily influenced by Stanis≈Çaw Dunin-Karwicki's Egzorbitancje and De ordinanda Republica, the treatise called for deep reform of Poland's political system, economy and a social reform. Free Voice's author proposed that Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth's royal election laws be changed to allow only local candidates for the throne (\\"Piast kings\\") and that the landed gentry abandon their faith in divine providence as the only force able to deliver the fatherland from all dangers. It further called for reclamation of all Crown land to repair the royal treasury, limiting the liberum veto laws, eliminating landless gentry from participating in the Sejm and Sejmiks, and that the szlachta be covered by a 10% income tax as until the late 18th century the gentry was virtually exempted from all taxes. As to military reforms, the author proposed that the Pospolite ruszenie system be abolished and replaced with a standing army of 100,000 men at arms. Finally, the treatise was one of the first political pamphlets to propose abolition of serfdom in Poland, granting the serfs with civil (\\"personal\\") rights and replacing serfdom with rent.

Biography  He was born in 1762, the second son of Major Wiltshire Wilson of Wollock Grange, Northumberland, formerly of the 1st Royal Dragoons, and a daughter of Ralph Phillips of Colchester. After passing through the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich, Wilson received a commission as second lieutenant in the Royal Artillery on 9 July 1779. Wilson went to the West Indies in 1780. He was promoted to lieutenant on 28 February 1782. From the West Indies he took a detachment of artillery to Canada in 1786, and in 1790 he returned to England. He served in the Duke of York's Flanders Campaign in 1793, and was for some time attached with two 6-pounder guns to the 53rd Foot. He was employed in May, June, and July at the Siege of Valenciennes, which capitulated on 28 July. He was dangerously wounded at the initial attack on Dunkirk on 24 August. In October he was thrown into Nieuport with his two guns in company with the 53rd Foot and two Hessian battalions, where they were attacked by the whole French army under General of Brigade Dominique Vandamme. Vandamme met with an obstinate resistance, the sluices were opened, and his siege batteries inundated, and when abandoning the regular attack he attempted a night assault on 25 October, his front was so limited between the river and the inundation that Wilson, with his two guns placed to command the enemy's approach, was able by firing rapidly into the advancing foe over one hundred rounds of grape and round shot, to create such fearful havoc that the French withdrew just at the critical time when enlarged gun-vents and distorted muzzles were rendering Wilson's guns useless. The arrival of British forces on 29 October caused Vandamme to raise the siege on the following day, leaving his battering guns behind. The successful defence was ascribed by all concerned to the artillery and the 53rd Foot. Wilson's services were rewarded by promotion to the rank of captain-lieutenant, on 1 November 1793. In consequence of the gallantry displayed by the fishermen of Nieuport, the Duke of York incorporated them into a company of artillery, and gave the command of it to Wilson in June 1794. Wilson took part in the Battle of Tournay on 23 May 1794. He commanded the artillery at the defence of Nieuport that year, when General Diepenbrook with 1,500 men held the French army of 40,000 men under General of Brigade Jean Victor Marie Moreau at bay for nineteen days. On the capitulation Wilson became a prisoner of war, and was not exchanged for nine months. He commanded the Royal Artillery in the Quiberon Expedition under Major-General Welbore Ellis Doyle in 1795. Shortly after the capture of Isle Dieu he returned to England. In 1796 he was promoted to captain and went to the Cape of Good Hope with a company of artillery, but returned home the following year. In May 1798 he was part of the Ostend Expedition under Major- General Sir Eyre Coote, where he was again taken prisoner and sent to Lille. He was exchanged in 1799. In 1800 he was sent to the West Indies, where he remained for five years, in the last three of which he commanded the artillery. He commanded the artillery at the capture of Saint Lucia on 22 June 1803, of Tobago on 30 June 1803, and of Surinam on 5 May 1804. While in the Indies, he was promoted to the brevet rank of major on 29 August 1802, to regimental major on 20 July 1804, and to lieutenant-colonel on 10 March 1805. On his return to England in 1806, Wilson commanded the Royal Artillery in the Northern District until 1810, when he went to Ceylon to command his regiment there. While there, he was given the brevet rank of colonel in 1813, and the substantive rank the following year. He returned home in 1815, and two years afterwards went to Canada, where he commanded the Royal Artillery until 1820. While in Canada, he was promoted to major-general on 12 August 1819. He was appointed colonel-commandant on 21 January 1828, and promoted to lieutenant- general on 10 January 1837. His services were rewarded in 1836 by the distinction of a Knight Commandership of the Royal Guelphic Order (as typical for Knight Commanders of the order, he was also made a Knight Bachelor). He died on 8 May 1842 at Cheltenham.  Family  Wilson was twice married: first in 1789, to a daughter of John Lees; and secondly in 1825, to a daughter of Jacob Glen of Chambly, near Montreal. There was no children from either marriage.

History =Creation= In 1986, Conrail filed for abandonment of trackage in and around Middletown, Connecticut: the so-called \\"Middletown Cluster\\". The Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection purchased the rail facilities in this area for $3.4 million in state bonds; in 1987 it was transferred to the Connecticut Department of Transportation. The Valley Railroad was named the designated operator, and set up the Central Connecticut Railroad as a subsidiary. The railroad was contracted to do the restoration of the tracks, road beds, and highway crossings and to restore rail service on the Wethersfield Secondary between Middletown and Hartford, and between Middletown and Maromas, the northern end of the Valley Railroad's property. The DEP was responsible for contracting the repair of the Middletown Swing Bridge over the Connecticut River to Portland. =Independence= Operations began on March 26, 1987, with transfers arranged with Conrail at Cedar Hill, New Haven. Business was at above projected levels until 1990, when traffic dropped by one third due to the recession, in addition to the closure of a major customer. As a result, the Valley Railroad sold the CCCL to a group of investors. The same year, a sludge-hauling contact with the City of Middletown was signed, and in 1992, a large steel operation began providing business to the railroad. This kept the railroad from falling to bankruptcy. =Buyout= After years of profitable operation, the railroad looked for expansion. The Wethersfield Secondary was only operated as far north as Cromwell, and the railroad looked to extend operations up to the Connecticut Southern Railroad's Hartford Terminal at the north end of the line. The state awarded the rights to the CCCL, and subsequently the Providence and Worcester Railroad bought the company and began their operations in April 1998. This was around the time Conrail was bought and split between CSX Transportation and Norfolk Southern.

Biography Born in Kalundborg, R√∏rup studied at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts under Ejnar Nielsen and Sigurd Wandel, graduating in 1930. He debuted in 1928 at the Kunstnernes Efter√•rsudstilling (Artists' Autumn Exhibition). In 1927, he moved into a house in K√•rup Bakker in Odsherred as one of the first to join Karl Bovin and Kaj Ejstrup in the group of artists known as the Odsherred Painters. In 1937, he married the artist Ellen Krause who also became a member of the artists' colony. Until 1940, he was mainly a figure painter but he then extended his scope to landscapes. His early paintings are rather dark but after spending some time in France studying the works of the Impressionists, his palette became brighter and his colours more intense, forming a webbing of light and shade. He increasingly developed an Impressionistic style approaching Pointillism. From 1942, he was a member of the Corner artists association, where he also exhibited. He travelled widely in the 1950s, producing many drawings and sketches in various European countries. In 1950, together with his wife, R√∏rup bought a dilapidated homestead in √Ösen near Ordrup in Odsherred where he spent the rest of his life. R√∏rup's paintings have been exhibited across Denmark and in Rostock, Stockholm and Ukraine. In 2014, his R√∏dvinsselskabet (Red Wine Party, 1967) was one of the highlights of the Hverdagen er en fest (Every Day is a Party) exhibition at Odherreds Museum.

Ocean Wave is perhaps best known for transporting summer vacationers from Portland, Oregon to seaside resorts near Ilwaco, Washington during its service on the Columbia River. This vessel is also known for being the first ferry placed in service by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. Construction Ocean Wave was built at Portland, Oregon by J.H. Steffen for the Ilwaco Railway and Navigation Company. Ocean Wave was a side- wheeler type of steamboat, designed by Jacob Kamm, a wealthy business man who had extensive experience in steamboats. In early July 3, 1891, Jacob Kamm and his son, Charles T. Kamm, were rushing to complete the work on the new steamer, in an effort to have the vessel running by July 15, 1891, as the low water in the river could prevent the river steamer then on the route, the T.J. Potter, from making the scheduled time to Ilwaco. On July 15, 1891, it was reported that Ocean Wave had been launched, that the boat had cost $70,000 to construct, and that it bore a ‚Äústriking resemblance to the T.J. Potter‚Äù The new steamer would make connections with the Ilwaco trains and probably would be run in opposition to the Union Pacific's boat on the Portland-Ilwaco route. Specifications As completed in 1891, Ocean Wave was , with a beam of and depth of hold of These dimensions were measured over the hull. The size of the deck, which was built on outriggers or supporters attached to the hull, and the cabin structure (called the ‚Äúhouse‚Äù) on the deck, were different, and often much wider, particularly for side-wheelers. The house was 56 feet wide at its maximum, necessarily overhanging the hull by 8 feet maximum on each side. The extreme length of the vessel was reported to have been 203 feet. The overall size of the vessel was 724.40 gross tons and 507.34 net tons. The merchant vessel registry number was 155207. Ocean Wave had two steam engines had a cylinder diameter of 18 inches and a stroke of 84 inches. The engines were manufactured by James Rees and Co., of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and were of the independent balance puppet valve type. The engines were designed to generate 190 nominal horsepower, turning the side wheels at twenty-two to twenty-five revolutions per minute. The side wheels themselves were in diameter, and the planks mounted on the wheel that bit into the water (called ‚Äúbuckets) were feet long. The steam engines coupled to the stern wheels were expected to be readily capable of driving the boat at a speed of 18 miles per hour. The boat was reported to have cost $75,000. There were accommodations for 115 passengers in state rooms, with berthing for 75 more. Operations on the Columbia River Ocean Wave, in a drawing published in 1894, clearly based on the leading photograph in this article. The first pilot of Ocean Wave was Capt. Lester A. Bailey (b.1850), who had previously commanded the large sidewheeler Olympian on the route from Portland to Ilwaco. Others who served on Ocean Wave on the Ilwaco route were Charles T. Kamm, as master, and Joseph Hayes, as chief engineer. In 1889, the Ilwaco Railway and Navigation Company had built a narrow gauge railroad on the Long Beach Peninsula, then generally called the \\"North Beach.\\" The company depended heavily on summer vacationers coming from the Portland area and other parts of Oregon. Ocean Wave was built to help transport vacationers to the company's dock at Ilwaco, Washington. The dock, which was in Baker's Bay, near Cape Disappointment, was in shallow water, and steamers could not get near the dock if the tide was too far out. Because the trains needed to arrive at the dock at same time as the steamers, the IR&N; became known as the \\"railroad that ran by the tide.\\" Starting in 1891, Ocean Wave made tri-weekly trips from Portland to Astoria and Ilwaco. One historian described how it might have appeared when the steamer met the train at Ilwaco: The steamer was also available for excursions. On Saturday, August 15, 1891, Ocean Wave was chartered for an excursion by the Signal Corps of the First Regiment of the Oregon Native Guards. Fireworks were set off when the boat departed from the Taylor Street dock in Portland at 9:00 pm. About 300 people were on board. A band was embarked on the steamer, and played a tune, ‚ÄúOut on the Ocean Wave‚Äù, as several thousand people gathered along the river to witness the boat's departure. Ocean Wave arrived at Astoria, Oregon at 9:00 a.m. the next day, and disembarked some of the passengers, then proceeded to Ilwaco, where the steamer met the narrow gauge train at the dock. On the afternoon of June 13, 1893, Ocean Wave came downriver from Portland, Oregon to Astoria, and then crossed across the Columbia to Ilwaco, Washington.Item, Daily Morning Astorian, June 14, 1893, page 4, col. 2. Later, Ocean Wave made its first trip of the summer from Portland direct to Ilwaco on July 3, 1893. The steamer was ‚Äúcrowded with Portlanders who intend spending the summer at the North Beach.‚Äù On July 21, 1893, the Oregon City Transportation Company, a steamboat concern, announced that through September 30, it would sell tickets to all points on North Beach, traveling on Ocean Wave with baggage being checked and transferred at no extra charge. On August 4, 1893, it was advertised that tickets on the steamers Telephone, Lurline, Ocean Wave and the tug Illwaco were interchangeable. On June 30, 1896, Ocean Wave arrived with the first group of vacationers for the season on the beaches. On the same day, the Oregon Railway and Navigation Company and the White Collar Line reached an agreement whereby there would be two steamers, Ocean Wave and T.J. Potter, running twice daily between Astoria and Portland. A rail link between Portland and Astoria was under construction at the time, but had not yet reached Astoria. Completion of the rail link was expected to be soon, if the steel for the rails were to be delivered. Passengers for Gearhart and Seaside, Oregon would be landed at Flavel rather than a landing known as ‚Äúthe old bridge‚Äù until trains ran into Astoria. The roundtrip fare from Portland to Ilwaco would be $3.50 during the 1896 summer season. Ownership issues Advertisement published August 18, 1895, showing Ocean Wave as part of the White Collar Line. In July 1895 the board of directors of the Ilwaco Railway and Navigation Company, known as the IR&N;, voted to lease Ocean Wave to the Columbia River and Puget Sound Transportation Company, also known as the CR & PSN and commonly referred to as the White Collar Line. At that time the CR & PSN had on the Columbia River two fast and well-known sternwheelers Telephone and the Bailey Gatzert. One of the IR&N; company directors, Jacob Kamm, did not agree with this decision, and he placed a maritime lien (called a ‚Äúlibel‚Äù) on Ocean Wave for $17,851 for services provided by Kamm's firm, the Vancouver Transportation Company. While Kamm and Loomis were both on the board of directors of the IR&N;, a disagreement between them had arisen, reportedly because Ocean Wave, designed by Kamm, had proven to be a slower boat than Loomis had wanted. If the lien had remained in place, it would have forced Ocean Wave to be tied up during the entire summer season when the boat would otherwise be at its most profitable. Kamm stated that if Ocean Wave were to be released from the libel, he would place his own steamboats, Lurline and Undine, in opposition. The editor of the Daily Astorian looked forward to such an event, which would generate a rate war among the steamboats supplying service between Portland and Astoria. As of July 16, 1895, the dispute was still not settled, and Ocean Wave was still not running on its most profitable route, the Portland-Astoria-Ilwaco run. The matter was resolved soon thereafter, when Louis A. Loomis (1830-1913), the chief founder of IR&N;, went to San Francisco to obtain a loan of $85,000. Loomis estimated it would take over $64,000 to pay off all of the claims of Jacob Kamm. Loomis had been convinced that no one in the state of Oregon would lend him the money to pay Kamm's claims, so he had gone to San Francisco for the money. The rumor Astoria was that Loomis obtained the funds from the Morgan Oyster Company, who were also substantial stockholders in the IR&N.; With the proceeds of the loan, Loomis was able to pay off Kamm. Sheriff Sears of Multnomah County, released the lien. With the lien gone, the lease of Ocean Wave to the CR&PSN; went through. Ocean Wave began running on July 18, 1895. Thereafter Ocean Wave was operated on the Columbia River, and advertised, as one of the steamboats of the White Collar Line. Transfer to Puget Sound Ocean Wave prior to 1900, apparently out of service. In December 1897, Ocean Wave was sold to a syndicate who intended to bring the steamer north to Puget Sound. Another source states the vessel was chartered to Cook and Co., a Puget Sound concern. On December 7, 1897, President Loomis of the IR&N; handed over Ocean Wave to Capt. Charles Clancy, who was to take the steamer down the Columbia River and around the Olympic Peninsula to Puget Sound. According to one non-contemporaneous source, the reason for the sale was that Ocean Wave was not in the same speed class as the primary competition, T.J. Potter. The boat was reported to have been under powered and therefore somewhat slow in actual service. Other sources state or suggest that the reason for the sale was to permit Ocean Wave to be used in the shipping boom triggered by the Klondike Gold Rush. Ocean Wave saw some service running from Puget Sound to Vancouver, British Columbia under Gary (or Cary) W. Cook (b.1862). According to one source, when the bottom fell out of the Klondike market, Ocean Wave was left with nothing to do. In December 1898, Ocean Wave was taken from Tacoma to the Fraser River in British Columbia to be placed in lay up for an indefinite time. The owners were reported to have been afraid to keep the vessel in the ‚Äúteredo-invested water‚Äù of Puget Sound.  Purchase by Santa Fe Railroad  Ocean Wave in service, unknown location on either the Columbia River or Puget Sound, sometime between 1891 and 1899. By 1899, the Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railroad had completed its transcontinental line with its western terminus at Point Richmond. To complete the final part of the line to San Francisco, the railroad needed a steamer to carry its passengers across the bay. Santa Fe had a new ferry boat ordered and under construction at Union Iron Works but this would not be complete in time. With no suitable local steamer available, the railroad's traffic manager, W.A. Bissell, asked Capt. John Leale, of the Southern Pacific ferry lines, to go to Pacific Northwest to attempt to locate an appropriate vessel. Leale's employer, Southern Pacific, was willing to cooperate with the Santa Fe, and so Leale went to the Pacific Northwest to look for a boat. Leale first went to Portland, Oregon, and then to Puget Sound, where he met Gary W. Cook. Cook took Leale north to New Westminster, British Columbia, where Cook had had the Ocean Wave docked, and offered the boat to Leale Leale liked the strong build of the vessel, so bought Ocean Wave for his own account, subject to the conditions that it be delivered to San Francisco and it be able to raise steam and turn its wheels over under its own power once it arrived there.  Transfer to San Francisco Bay  At 9:30 pm, on Saturday, May 20, 1899, Ocean Wave departed Port Angeles, Washington under the tow of the powerful ocean-going steam tug Richard Holyoke. Ocean Wave was not built to operate on the open sea, so before the transfer, it had to boarded up to protect against breaking waves. Water ballast was pumped into the hull. The weather was good and Holyoke arrived with the tow a day earlier than expected, on May 24, 1899. Once the boat arrived, and met with Santa Fe's approval following inspection, the railroad purchased the vessel from Leale. Reconstruction Ocean Wave following reconstruction as a ferry in 1900. On arrival in San Francisco, Ocean Wave was tied up to the Washington Street wharf. Modifications had to be made to refit Ocean Wave for ferry service. Within one-half hour, carpenters had begun to work on the vessel. There were fifty staterooms on the main deck and over one hundred on the upper deck, all of which had to be removed, to convert the upper deck into a single large passenger lounge (called a ‚Äúsaloon‚Äù) and the lower deck into a freight area. The bow had to be reconfigured to allow boarding over the front of the vessel at the ferry landing slips in the bay. Later the steamer was sent to Hay and Wright's shipyard at Oakland Creek.\\"Ocean Wave‚Äôs New Business\\", Sunday Oregonian, April 8, 1900, part 2, page 22, col. 1. When complete, Ocean Wave would be a ‚Äúsingle ender‚Äù ferry, like the San Rafael which was then operating on the bay. Once in service, Ocean Wave and San Rafael would be the only single-ender ferries running on the bay, with all the rest being double-enders. In May 1899, it was reported that the time necessary to accomplish the reconstruction work would be about two months, and would be done about August 1, 1899. However, Ocean Wave was in the yard for seven months, and was finished a few days before April 8, 1900. Ferry operations Ocean Wave in ferry service on San Francisco Bay, sometime between 1900 and 1911. Unknown sailing ship in background. Santa Fe planned for Ocean Wave to meet its passenger trains at Point Richmond, then transported the passengers and their associated luggage and freight across San Francisco Bay to the Market Street ferry terminal. However, difficulties in completing the rail line to Point Richmond prevented Ocean Wave from being immediately placed into this service. Instead the boat was used at first to haul supplies from San Francisco to Point Richmond. When the rail line to Point Richmond was complete, Ocean Wave began service as a ferry. The first trip occurred on July 6, 1900, when Ocean Wave departed from the Ferry Building in San Francisco, and reached Point Richmond 40 minutes later, where passengers and baggage were transferred to an eastbound Santa Fe train, which would be the first ever to reachnChicago over an entirely Santa Fe-owned right of way. In charge of Ocean Wave on this trip were Capt. John Lauritzen as master and Chief Engineer Ed Mahoney. Ocean Wave‚Äôs engines were too light to handle the heavy traffic on the Point Richmond run. The new ferry that had been building at Union Works, was launched and named San Pablo. When San Pablo was placed into service in December 1900, Ocean Wave was switched from the primary boat on the line to the spare or \\"relief\\" boat, used when the principal vessel was under repair or otherwise unavailable. Santa Fe operated the two boats together for about ten years. In May 1908, the Santa Fe Railroad arranged to have Ocean Wave take a number of excursion trips around San Francisco Bay to view the arrival of the Great White Fleet. According to an advertisement for the excursions: Accidents and casualties Over the years Ocean Wave was involved in a number of accidents, some of which resulted in loss of life. These occurred both on the Columbia River system and in San Francisco Bay. =Columbia and Willamette river incidents= In January 1893, on the Willamette River, the sternwheeler Telephone, while making a landing to pick up some hogs at the North Portland stockyards, ran into an anchored ship, breaking the ship's bow sprit. Telephone backed away from the ship, and in so doing collided with Ocean Wave, smashing the sternwheel on Telephone. Damage to Ocean Wave was about $200 and, to Telephone, about $500. On Sunday night, August 18, 1895, at 11:30 pm, Ocean Wave while en route from Ilwaco to Portland, ran into and sank a pleasure yacht with five people on board. Two of the yacht's occupants, John Weatherwax and Ed Wagner, were drowned. The captain of Ocean Wave reported that the sailboat had no light showing and there was heavy smoke, presumably from the Ocean Wave, prevailing at the time. On September 25, 1895, the case was investigated by the Steamboat Inspection Service and the officers of Ocean Wave were exonerated of all blame. On September 6, 1897, deck hand Dell Elbon fell overboard from Ocean Wave as the steamer was passing through the Burnside Bridge. Elbon was 21 years of age, and had been working as non-union employee during a wage dispute on the Ocean Wave when he fell from the boat. Elbon's father alleged that his son's death was linked to the labor dispute and that he had been struck on the head prior to going into the water. The coroner found no evidence of a blow to the head however. =San Francisco bay incidents= On November 27, 1901, a cylinder head blew out on Ocean Wave while the ferry was on the 8:00 a.m. run, causing a deckhand to be slightly scalded by escaping steam. The engines became useless as a result, but the tug Reliance towed Ocean Wave to and from Point Richmond on the day of the incident, so there as no delay or inconvenience in the ferry service. The ferry Amador was to take the place of Ocean Wave until repairs could be effected. During a severe wind storm on February 25, 1902, Ocean Wave was blown off its moorings at Point Richmond and drifted about one- half mile into shallow water where it was grounded. A tug as well as the ferry San Pablo tried to pull Ocean Wave back into deeper water, but were unsuccessful. Finally it was decided to put a crew aboard the stranded ferry, and they started a fire in the boiler. With steam up, Ocean Wave was able to get clear under its own power. The ferry then went to San Francisco for repairs, but the damage was not very great. On July 8, 1910, a carpenter, Petrus A. Erickson, was believed to have fallen overboard from the Ocean Wave. Erickson was thought to have fallen into the bay from the paddle wheel housing where he had been working when the ferry left San Francisco bound for Point Richmond on the afternoon of the 8th. Erickson's body was initially reported to have been found ten days later, on July 18, 1910, floating beneath Broadway wharf No. 2. This body was to have been turned over to Erickson's brother. However, the body recovered on July 18 seems not to have been that of Erickson's. On August 19, 1910, Peter Nelson, the lighthouse keeper at Lime Point Lighthouse, found a body in the surf. Based on the clothing on the body, which had been in the water a month or more, Coroner F.E. Sawyer ruled that the body might be that of Erickson. Later years By 1911, Ocean Wave was not able to compete with newer and more powerful double-ended ferries that were running on the bay. The ferry was laid up at Antioch, California and sold back to Captain Leale, who intended to scrap it. However, when the First World War created a demand for shipping, Ocean Wave was sold to the United States Shipping Board, which used the vessel for about three and one-half years as a receiving ship to house recruits into the Sea Training Service to be trained as merchant seamen. The boat's engines were removed to make room for more recruits. In the 1920s the boat was sold again to be used as a floating restaurant. The boat later gradually disintegrated. According to another source, the boat was burned in 1934 on the mud flats of southern San Francisco Bay, near San Mateo.

Svindersvik lies just outside the city limits of Stockholm. It was built in the 1740s for Claes Grill, and today belongs to the Nordic Museum. It is open to the public through guided tours. History Map of Svindersvik from 1774 Svindersvik derives its name from Johan van Swinderen, a Dutch industrialist who was the first owner of the area; he erected a number of pitch factories in the vicinity in the 1640s. The whole area was bought in 1721 by the brothers Abraham and Carl (Carlos) Grill, members of the Grill family of industrialists. It passed through inheritance to Claes Grill (I), active in the Swedish East India Company in 1736, and it was he who decided to build a country residence on the location. From the outset, it was designed as a country residence and not a permanent home. In this capacity, it is unique for its time and one of the oldest preserved residences in Sweden of this kind. Claes Grill commissioned architect Carl H√•rleman to design the house. H√•rleman created a Rococo edifice with inspiration from contemporary French architecture, and in a similar style to Svartsj√∂ Palace, also by H√•rleman. Construction started in the 1740s, but were probably not finished by the time of Claes Grill's death in 1767. The terrace, for example, was added sometime between 1748-49 and 1784, as can be deducted from comparing two paintings of Svindersvik from these different dates. After the death of Claes Grill, it passed to his daughter Anna Johanna and her husband, Henric Wilhelm Peill. They sold it in 1780 to Catharina Charlotta Ribbing, the widow of Charles De Geer, one of the richest men in Sweden. She was a close friend of the king, Gustav III of Sweden, who visited Svindersvik several times. She ordered the construction or substantial expansion of an additional pavilion by the water, intended as a place for festivities. When she died in 1787, Svindersvik passed to her youngest son Louis, who sold it in 1791. It then successively passed between a number of different owners until 1949, when it was bought by the Nordic Museum. Architecture Svindersvik is a small ensemble consisting of a number of buildings. Apart from the main building and the aforementioned pavilion, there is a kitchen wing, a formal garden and an orchard. The design of the main building is very clearly derived from contemporary French Rococo architecture, and its layout is very similar to designs for country residences published by Charles √âtienne Briseux; indeed, it has been suggested that the original floor plan may have been identical to one of Briseux' designs, published in 1743. From the exterior the main building appears to be a one-storey house, although it is a two-storey house (a similar design was adopted by H√•rleman for Svartsj√∂ Palace). The entrance is reached by a flight of double stairs, and set in the centre of the fa√ßade which protrudes in the way of an avant-corps with rusticated lesenes and pediment. On the opposite side, facing the Baltic Sea, a three-sided avant-corps instead serves to mark the symmetrical centre of the building. The layout of the floor plan is very symmetrical, in accordance with Rococo ideals. The entrance leads to a hall that occupies both storeys and is crowned by a roof lantern supplying light. The central part of the building houses the dining room; to the left of this is an antechamber and to the right the so- called parade bedroom. The interior decoration is largely intact or, in a few cases, restored with 18th century furniture. The dining room is decorated in a strict form of classicism with pilasters and painted festoons, executed in grisaille technique. The furnishings are however simple. The antechamber is more pronouncedly Rococo in character, with exotic, Chinese wallpapers, a testimony of Claes Grill's work at the Swedish East India Company. The furnishings are here also richer. The parade bedroom is to a certain degree a reconstruction, with furniture from the time. Here also the wallpaper is Chinese. On the second floor, there is an intact 18th century billiards room. The kitchen in the wing to the main building has unusually also remained almost completely unchanged since the 18th century. The pavilion contains a set of interior of slightly later date, from the time of king Gustav III. It contains, among other things, a cocklestove which is probably the tallest in Sweden (). The walls of the main room of the pavilion are decoratively painted with Ionic pilasters between which are decorative elements depicting medallions, vases, birds and antique figures. It also contains an unusually large chandelier.

The film stars Edna May Oliver, Jill Esmond, Ken Murray, Roscoe Ates, and Kitty Kelly. The film was released on February 5, 1932, by RKO Pictures. It was based on the 1929 play Ladies of the Jury, written by John Frederick Ballard. Plot Middle-aged Mrs. Livingston Baldwin Crane (Edna May Oliver) is selected to serve on a jury for the murder trial of French ex-showgirl Yvette Gordon (Jill Esmond), accused of killing her rich, much older husband. The prosecutor calls only two witnesses, a doctor and Mrs. Gordon's maid, Evelyn Snow. Snow testifies that after she found Mrs. Gordon kneeling beside the body of her husband holding the murder weapon, a gun, her employer offered to pay her to say that Mr. Gordon committed suicide. Mrs. Gordon, on the other hand, claims that Snow demanded money to tell the police that story. On the witness stand, Mrs. Gordon says she went away for a week to get away from Mr. Gordon for a while, then returned to an angry, suspicious husband who threatened her with a gun. She states they struggled, and the gun went off by accident. During the testimony, Mrs. Crane asks several questions of the witnesses, much to the annoyance of Judge Henry Fish. She discovers that Snow was recommended to Mrs. Gordon by Chauncey Gordon, Mr. Crane's nephew and sole relative (and heir if Mrs. Gordon is convicted). When the jury retires to consider a verdict, Mrs. Crane casts the sole \\"not guilty\\" vote. When asked why, she replies, \\"Woman's intuition.\\" After much convincing and several votes, the count is ten to two in favor of acquittal. During the deliberations, the wealthy Mrs. Crane manages to (illegally) pass a note to her maid Suzanne, instructing her to hire a detective agency to investigate further. When Mrs. Crane overhears a couple of the jurors debating whether to switch their votes back to guilty, she recommends they reenact the death at the scene. In the Gordon mansion, Chauncey Gordon refuses to pay Snow any more money until after Mrs. Gordon is found guilty. When they see the jury drive up, Snow hides Chauncey in a secret compartment. However, the jurors find the secret compartment and him by accident. Furthermore, a telegram arrives, stating that the detective agency has found out that Chauncey paid Snow $10,000. As a result, the jury find Mrs. Gordon not guilty. Cast *Edna May Oliver as Mrs. Livingston Baldwin Crane *Jill Esmond as Mrs. Yvette Gordon *Ken Murray as Spencer B.

History In 1839, Heinrich Iager purchased of farmland expanding to s forming Maple Lawn Farms. In 1938, the farm began its current free-range turkey operations under the \\"Sho-Nuf\\" brand name. In 1970 the farm owned by C. Ellsworth Iager and Sons won the Progressive Breeders Dairy Award. The farm was nationally recognized in 2004 for the registered Holsteins used in its dairy operations. Ellsworth Iager(1916-1987) took advantage of cheap POW labor through 1945. In 1986, the Iagers took a higher land-lease option from J.J.M Inc. developers. The fencing was torn down and the neighboring Hines farm tenants were forced to liquidate their livestock due to the sudden reduction of grazing land. In 1987, farm owner, land developer, appraiser and relator, Ellsworth Iager died. In the late 1990s, Fulton sat between the heavily developed areas of eastern Howard County, with water and sewer service, and the preserved western areas which used well water. Developer Greenebaum & Rose Associates proposed a dense 1168-unit mixed use project for a portion of the farm. In January 1998, Councilman Darrell Drown felt that the zoning would take only a night or two, and accommodated the developer with expedited hearings. The first phase of zoning faced multiple contentious votes and 32 record-length hearings between pro-development and rural supporters. In 2013, the Howard County Department of Planning and Zoning sought to expand water and sewer service so that the remaining Maple Lawn property could be developed at maximum density. A 7000-person referendum attempt was launched and suppressed by the landowners' attorney, William Erskine, who sits on the economic development agency as well as the same law firm as County Executive Ken Ulman's father. In September 2014, The Iager family hosted Ken Ulman on the remaining undeveloped Maple Lawn Farm parcel to become \\"Farmer for a Day\\". A homeowners association is responsible for residential facilities and maintenance and upkeep of the community center and parkland.

The firm of Cummings and Conrad were selected to design and build a three-story, brick school at a cost of just over $100,000. Work on the structure continued through early 1915. The builders had to contend with the farm at the rear of the property that is now Ty Cobb Stadium. They also had to put up with visitors to the adjoining Casino Park. Ithaca architect Fred Thomas designed a new four-story addition to the school that merged elements of the original building. The new addition added 135,000 feet of space at a cost of $6.2 million. The modular design could change as needs shifted in the future. Work began in 1972, and the project was complete by 1974. The modern addition included laboratories, art and music rooms and health classrooms. Demographics In the 201415 school year, the Union-Endicott student body was 53% male, 47% female, 79% White, 7% Black, 7% Hispanic, 3% Asian, 0.1% American Indian/Alaskan Native, and 5% Multiracial. There was a total enrollment of 1,165 students.

Behind the Upper Inn valley and the Hohe Munde; right: the Wetterstein Mountains The Seefeld Plateau () is a montane valley and basin landscape in the North Tyrolean Limestone Alps about 500 metres above the Inn valley in the Austrian state of Tyrol. The plateau covers the valley basin around the villages of Seefeld in Tirol and Scharnitz as well as the valley of Leutaschtal.  Location  The Seefeld Plateau runs northwards from the edge of the Inn graben at the Zirler Berg. It lies at a height of around in the North Tyrolean Limestone Alps between the Wetterstein Mountains to the northwest, the Mieming Mountains to the west and the Karwendel to the east. The Seefeld Saddle (), a mountain pass and saddle south of Seefeld, forms a watershed, north of which the plateau drains towards the Isar and south of which it drains into the Inn.  Geology and flora  View from Leithen of the Zirler Berg (centre: wooded) The dominant rocks of the Seefeld Plateaus are Wetterstein limestone and main dolomite with scattered occurrences of bituminous slate. A branch of the ice age Inn Glacier scoured out several basins and left lakes behind such as the Wildsee, the M√∂serer See and the Wildmoossee as well as numerous raised bogs like the Reither Moor that were formed by the silting up of lakes. The plateau lies in the montane altitude zone. On its slopes are fir and beech mixed woods interspersed with spruce. The meadows around the villages are mainly false oat-grass pastures that are used as hay meadows or for grazing.  Economy and transport  View from the Gschwandtkopf looking northeast towards Seefeld in Tirol With around 1.74 million overnight stays per year, evenly divided between winter and summer (as at 2013), tourism is by far the most important economic factor on the Seefeld Plateau. The area has developed itself into a centre for Nordic skiing and was the venue for Nordic competitions in the Winter Olympics of 1964 and 1976, the 1985 Nordic Ski World Championships and many other major events. In summer the Karwendel Alps are a major attraction for hikers and mountain bikers. The plateau may be reached on the Seefelder Stra√üe (B 177) road that runs over the Seefeld Saddle from the Inn valley as well as other state roads. The Mittenwald Railway also runs across the plateau from north to south, stopping at several stations including Scharnitz, Seefeld and Reith.

It has two peaks: the west top (2,662 m) and the east top or Mundekopf (2,592 m).  Location  The Hohe Munde rises north of the village of Telfs in the Inn valley. To the east is the Seefeld Plateau and the Leutasch village of Moos. To the north it is separated from the Wetterstein Mountains by the valley of Gaistal. To the west, the Mieming Chain stretches away into the distance. Beyond the saddle of Niedere Munde (2,059 m) is the next peak in the chain, the 2,469 metre high Karkopf, followed by the 2,719 metre high Hochwand.  Ascent  The mountain may be climbed on an easy but strenuous tour from Moos via the Rauth Hut (1,605 m). The cable car from Moos to the Rauth Hut (the Mundelift) is no longer working. On the eastern slopes of the Mundekopf extensive avalanche defences have been built to protect the village of Sagl. These were finished in August 2014. Sure-footed and experienced climbers can also climb the Hohe Munde from Telfs - branching off in Stra√überg to the saddle of the Niedere Munde - via the western ar√™te, a route graded as UIAA I. There are several climbing routes up the north and south faces below both the east and west tops, some of which are difficult. A ski tour is possible over the steep (up to 45 degrees) east side in the spring. However, this requires safe firn conditions and a very early start.  Drama and television  In 1990, the drama Munde by Felix Mitterer was premiered on the Hohe Munde. In 2009 the Tatort episode, Baum der Erl√∂sung, was partly filmed in the summit area of the Hohe Munde.

Online edition. A & C Black, Oxford University Press, 2014. Retrieved 2 September 2014. was a British Harley Street physician whose home in Guernsey was occupied by the Germans during the Second World War. In his spare time, Byam was a noted philatelist who was added to the Roll of Distinguished Philatelists in 1949.Background notes on The Roll of Distinguished Philatelists September 2011, Roll of Distinguished Philatelists Trust, London, 2011. Archived here.  Early life  Byam was the only son of Major General William Byam. William Byam junior was educated at Wellington College, Berkshire, and studied medicine at St George's Hospital, London.  Royal Army Medical Corps  Byam entered the Royal Army Medical Corps in 1904 and reached the rank of lieutenant colonel. He served in the Egyptian Army, 1908‚Äì16, including South East Sudan in 1912, for which he was awarded the Order 4th class Medjedieh. He was a member of the British Red Cross Unit to Bulgaria in 1912 for which he was awarded the Order 4th class St Alexander of Bulgaria, and the New Zealand Expeditionary Force, 1914‚Äì16, for which he was awarded the Order 3rd class Nile. In his autobiography, The Road to Harley Street (1963), Byam described his army service during the First World War and his research into trench fever, conducted at the Hampstead Heart Hospital. Trench fever was a major cause of illness amongst soldiers during the war and the method of transmission was uncertain. Byam contributed a chapter on the condition to Lloyd's Lice and their Menace to Man (London, Hodder & Stoughton, 1919). Byam developed a deep interest in Egypt during his service there, later even decorating a room in his Harley Street house in an Arab style. He donated the contents of that room, complete with hand-painted ceiling and wood panelling, to the Egyptian Embassy in London.  Philately  Byam took up philately in 1923 as a method of relaxation from his stressful medical practice and joined the Royal Philatelic Society London (RPSL) in 1924.\\"Dr. William Byam, O.B.E.\\", J.H.E.G., The London Philatelist, Vol. 72, No. 852, December 1963, pp. 207-208. He decided to specialise in the philately of Egypt, a country he knew well, and founded the Egypt Study Circle in 1935.Who Was Who in British Philately, Association of British Philatelic Societies, 2014. Retrieved 1 September 2014. Archived here. The Egypt circle was the first philatelic study circle to be established anywhere in the world and following a paper given to the 1938 Philatelic Congress of Great Britain titled \\"Organisation of a Study Circle\\", many other collectors were inspired to establish study circles in their own areas of specialism. During the Second World War, Byam's home in Guernsey was requisitioned for the use of German officers, and all his philatelic trophies and medals were stolen. They were never recovered. Fortunately, Byam's stamp collection remained in England and was safe. It was sold by auction in 1961.  Philatelic honours  Byam received many philatelic honours. In 1931 the RPSL awarded him the Tapling Medal for his research into the postage due stamps of Egypt and in 1956 the Tilleard Medal for his display of the 1872‚Äì75 postage stamps of that country. He also won nine gold medals at international philatelic exhibitions. Byam was the first foreigner to be appointed a \\"Member of Honour\\" by the Societe Philatelique d'Egypte. He was a fellow of the Society of Postal Historians and president of the Oriental Philatelic Association of London.  Death  Byam died 25 October 1963. He was survived by his wife and two daughters.

In 1853, it was asserted that there were 4,000 miles of telegraph lines in Great Britain, 27,000 miles in the United States, and it was expected that 4,000 miles of telegraph lines would soon be built in India. The telegraph lines required repeater stations and/or repair stations. In addition to stations along traditional telegraph lines, there were also a number of notable wireless telegraph stations that were important for communication to and from ships.

It turns east, takes in the left tributary Depot Creek, passes into the northwest corner of geographic Levack Township, Greater Sudbury, flows over a series of rapids, heads around both sides of a small hill, and reaches its mouth at the Onaping River, upstream of the community of Levack. The Onaping River flows via the Vermilion River and the Spanish River to Lake Huron.

The International style structure, with clean and simple lines, is a fine representative example of post-World War II construction in Spartanburg. Cecil also is known locally for the design of Spartanburg City Hall and the main branch of the Spartanburg Post Office, all three of which were for years considered eyesores. The Schuyler building has found itself placed on the National Historical Register recently in time for the grand reopening of the building. The building formerly housed subsidized families: low-income and elderly residents. Of late it has been refurbished as 'upscale' studios and one bedroom units.

Whilst the normal route aims to find the way with the least difficulty, the climber attempting a direttissima faces the challenge of ascending the mountain in a more \\"direct\\" way. Definition The term stems from Italian climber, Emilio Comici, who said: > \\"I wish some day to make a route, and from the summit let fall a drop of > water, and this is where my route will have gone\\"Venables, Stephen (2008). > First Ascent, Firefly. There are usually many climbing routes to the summit of a mountain and it often takes days of studying to work out which route might be suitable. Sometimes the theoretical considerations turn out to be impracticable or inexpedient in hindsight. But the alpinist who decides to climb a mountain peak or rock face direttissima may only depart slightly from the vertical line to the summit during his ascent. History Reinhold Messner wrote that diretissimas \\"always existed - so long as the mountain permits it\\", but in the 1960s they \\"infiltrated the entire field of climbing\\" due to the advance of drilling bolts and other equipment. In 1971, he stated \\"People are drilling more and more and climbing less and less.\\" The pursuit of direttissima routes lost its importance since at least the 1980s as the emphasis switched to the different styles of climbing, such as redpoint, on-sight and flash. Examples There are many direttissime that will probably never be climbed, one of which is (not least because of avalanche risk), the direttissima of the East Face of the Kangshung on Mount Everest. A famous direttissima in Europe is the vertical route up the Eiger North Face which is reserved for very experienced climbers.Gillman, Peter and Haston, Dougal (1966).

It was adopted in 2014 and became effective in January 2018. It was the subject of a joint project with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), which issues accounting guidance in the United States, and the guidance is substantially similar between the two boards. History A main purpose of the project to develop IFRS 15 was that, although revenue is a critical metric for financial statement users, there were important differences between the IASB and FASB definitions of revenue, and there were different definitions of revenue even within each board's guidance for similar transactions accounting for under different standards. The IASB also believed that its guidance for revenue was not sufficiently detailed. The IASB began working on its revenue project in 2002. The boards released their first discussion paper describing their views on accounting for revenue in 2008, and they released exposure drafts of a proposed standard in 2010 and 2011. The final standard was issued on 28 May 2014. Revenue model The IFRS 15 revenue model has five steps: #Identify the contract with a customer #Identify all the individual performance obligations within the contract #Determine the transaction price #Allocate the price to the performance obligations #Recognize revenue as the performance obligations are fulfilled Relative to previous accounting guidance, IFRS 15 may cause revenue to be recognized earlier in some cases, but later in others. =Identify the contract with a customer= According to IFRS 15, the following criteria have to be met before a contract can be identified; # both parties have to approve the contract and are committed to perform; # and the entity can identify each party‚Äôs rights and obligations in terms of the contract; and # there are clear payment terms in the contract, and the contract has ‚Äúcommercial substance‚Äù. =Identify all the individual performance obligations within the contract= A good or service that is to be delivered in terms of a contract with a customer qualifies as a performance obligation if the good or service is ‚Äúdistinct‚Äù. In this context a good or service is distinct if: * The stipulated item can be consumed by the customer, either on its own, or in combination with other items that are regularly available to the customer; and * The promise to transfer goods or services to a customer can be separately identified from other transfers stipulated in the contract. =Determine the transaction price= In most cases the transaction price to be paid will be stipulated in the contract and quite easy to calculate; however certain circumstances require that a transaction price should be estimated by other methods. Firstly, an entity has to measure the amount of non-cash consideration in a contract in terms of IFRS 13: fair value measurement. Secondly, a contract can have variable consideration (for example, the transaction price is subject to settlement discount should the client pay within a certain time frame). In this case, the transaction price can be calculated by two methods: * The most likely amount: the amount that of considerations that has the highest probability of realizing will be measured as the transaction price, or * Expected value approach; in this case the weighed average of possible amounts will be measured as the transaction price. Both of the above-mentioned are estimates, and should the estimates change, the entity will apply the change prospectively in terms of the criteria of IAS 8. Lastly IFRS 15 requires that the entity should test for the existence of a ‚Äúsignificant financing component‚Äù in the contract, this will occur if: ‚Äúthe timing of payments agreed by the parties to the contract provides the customer or the entity with a significant benefit of financing the transfer of goods or services to the customer‚Äù If the above-mentioned is applicable, the transaction price will be adjusted to eliminate the effect of this benefit. This is simply done by calculating the net present value of the payments (if the satisfaction of performance obligations is prior to the payment date), or by calculating the net future value (if the payment date is prior to the satisfaction of performance obligations). The difference (between the amount recognized after adjustment for a significant financing component and amount of consideration to be received) is simply recognized as interest income/ expense in terms of the accrual basis of accounting as mentioned in IAS 1. =Recognize revenue as the performance obligations fulfilled (Service)= An entity can recognize revenue when performance obligations have been settled, a performance obligation has been settled when the customer has received all the benefits associated with the performance obligation, and is able to use and enjoy the asset to his or her own discretion. =Performance obligations settled over time= The performance obligations will be settled in the measure of progress towards completion, the measure of progress can be either based on the inputs (in the case of manufactured goods), or the output method. Recognition of a contract asset IFRS 15 introduced a new accounting term: contract asset. It is an asset corresponding to accrued revenue when the payment from a customer is conditional not only on the passage of time and hence a typical trade receivable cannot be recognised.  Effective date  (Kit) IFRS 15, as amended, is effective for the first interim period within annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The FASB‚Äôs standard (ASC 606) is effective for public entities for the first interim period within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 (nonpublic companies have an additional year).

Biography Becerra claimed to have been born on August 31, 1887, to parents who were singers. As The Daily Telegraph writes, this would have meant that \\"She was 27 when World War One erupted, 75 when John F. Kennedy was shot and over 100 when the Berlin Wall came down.\\" From 1910 to 1917, Becerra claimed to have fought as a leader of the Adelitas in the Mexican Revolution. The Adelitas were a group of women who joined with their husbands in battle. During the revolution, she was purportedly romantically involved with Margarito Maldonado, a revolutionary leader, who she said gave Becerra an old rifle that she still owned in 2014. Becerra recounted that Maldonado was \\"one of the great loves of her life.\\" It has been reported that Becerra outlived her five children and several of her 20 grandchildren, but, as last reported, she still had 73 great-grandchildren and 55 great-great-grandchildren. Oldest living person Becerra claimed to have lost her birth certificate in a move in 1974, meaning she could not conclusively prove her age. Since she did not have her birth certificate, the Guinness World Records could not verify Becerra's claim and instead recognized Misao Okawa (1898-2015) as the world's oldest living person, and Jeanne Calment (1875-1997) as the longest- lived person in history. After her death on March 19, 2015, some media outlets reported that the Mexican government had confirmed that she was 127 at the time of her death, but no officials have so far confirmed this.

Background Born in Manila, he was the fifth son of Tomas Arguelles, a known pre-war Filipino architect, and Carmen Corcuera. Carlos followed in his father's footsteps and graduated in 1940 from the architecture program in the University of Santo Tomas. He continued his studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology where he earned his bachelor's degree in architecture in 1941. The outbreak of World War II interrupted his masteral studies as he enlisted in the army, eventually assigned to be alongside Manuel Quezon and the Philippine Commonwealth government-in-exile in Washington, D.C. and as an intelligence officer under General Chuck Parsons in Australia. He returned to MIT after the war to complete his master's degree in architecture, which he obtained in 1946. He died on August 19, 2008 in Manila, Philippines  Career  Arguelles returned to the Philippines in 1949 and began his architecture career in the country as an associate of Gines Rivera, the architect behind the planning of the Ateneo de Manila University campus being built at that time in Loyola Heights in Quezon City. He also began teaching at the UST College of Architecture and served as its dean from 1953 to 1959. Arguellles first came into prominence in Philippine architecture thanks to his role as chief architect of Philamlife Homes in Quezon City, the first gated community in the country, as he designed many of the bungalow houses which were suited to the Filipino middle-class lifestyle. He would then move on to design other notable landmarks, including Philamlife's headquarters in Ermita in 1962 and the Manila Hilton right across it in 1968. He was also involved with a number of professional societies such as the American Institute of Architects and the Philippine Institute of Architects, as well as socio-civic and religious organizations such as Rotary Chamber of Manila, Philippine Motor Association, Men of the Sacred Heart of the Sanctuario de San Antonio Parish.

He has been credited with raising the profile of the breed in the UK by The Kennel Club, and has appeared in photographs alongside his owners' son Prince George of Cambridge. History Lupo was bred from Ella, a dog owned by Michael and Carole Middleton, the parents of Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge. He is a working-type English Cocker Spaniel. Lupo was born in a litter just prior to Christmas 2011, and was given to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, who at first denied owning the dog to the media. His name was finally divulged after the Duchess of Cambridge visited Oxford and told Abubakr Hussain, a child at Rose Hill Primary School. = Origin of name = The name \\"Lupo\\" is from the Italian word for wolf and derived from Latin. It was reported that the Duchess has named the dog after the family of her paternal great grandmother, Olive Christiana Middleton n√©e Lupton; the Lupton family crest has wolves on it. The dog continued to accompany the Duchess of Cambridge while her husband was deployed with the Royal Air Force to the Falkland Islands, and the pair appeared on the front cover of Hello magazine. While the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were awaiting the birth of their first child, they relocated to the Duchess' family home in Berkshire, along with Lupo. While there, the media reported that he managed to get his head trapped in a set of gates, requiring the local fire brigade to be called out. A spokesperson from the Royal Berkshire Fire and Rescue Service explained that \\"The special unit from Reading was dispatched along with an appliance from the nearest station, Newbury. Our crew got to the manor but were told as they arrived at the gates that the dog, which had got its head stuck, had been freed just a few moments earlier.\\" Lupo was used to select the name of the Duke and Duchess' first child; they scattered pieces of paper with various names on the floor with the dog stopping at George. Following the birth of Prince George of Cambridge, Lupo was featured in one of the first official photographs. He was subsequently featured in a family portrait with the Duke and Duchess and Prince George in March 2014. He did not travel with his owners on their tour of Australia and New Zealand in 2014. Cultural influences The Kennel Club have attributed the raised profile and interest in English Cocker Spaniels to Lupo. There was an increase of 50% in the searches on their \\"Find A Puppy\\" website in the months following the Royal couple's announcement of their ownership of Lupo. This increased interest has also had the effect of an increase in thefts of English Cocker Spaniels. Aby King is signed to a four-book deal to write about the fictional adventures of Lupo for children. She was inspired following walks in Kensington Palace Gardens with her own Cocker Spaniel, and the death of her fianc√©. The first book is called The Adventures of Lupo the Royal Dog: The Secret of Windsor Castle and was released in September 2014.

Five were flown but the type never reached operational status because of structural concerns raised by a fatal accident. Design and development The parasol wing of the J 23 had a thick airfoil section, a straight leading edge and a trailing edge which curved forwards to elliptical tips. In the central region the wing became thinner and the chord decreased in front of the cockpit. It was of wooden, two spar construction and plywood covered apart from the ailerons. These were angled, fabric covered and small but slotted to improve their efficiency. Parallel pairs of airfoil section flying struts ran on each side from the lower fuselage to the wing spars at about one third span. Over the fuselage a pair of N-form cabane struts leaned inwards to meet at the wing's centre. Like the wing, the fuselage and empennage of the J 23 were wooden structures. The elliptical cross section fuselage consisted of pre-shaped, stress bearing plywood panels around a light framework of frames and stringers. The pilot's open cockpit was just aft of the trailing edge, from where he could see both over the wing and through the narrow gap between wing and fuselage. The six cylinder BMW IIIa engine had a fixed pair of machine gun over it in the forward fuselage and its honeycomb radiator was in the nose, with the propeller shaft set low. This was a high compression engine which could only develop full power at altitude, enabling the J 23 to fly high and fast. Its top speed was claimed to be at but at . The m/22 were synchronized, firing through the propeller. At the rear the ply covered fin was surprisingly small and low, though the fabric covered rudder extended down to the keel. The rudder carried a trim tab. The J 23's cantilever, low aspect ratio, D-shaped, ply covered tailplane was mounted on top of the fuselage, carrying balanced elevators with cut outs for rudder movement. Its fixed undercarriage had mainwheels on a rigid axle, rubber sprung from the crosspiece between two tall V-form legs mounted on the fuselage at the same points as the interplane struts. The axle and crosspiece were enclosed within an airfoil section fairing, which provided some additional lift. The J 23 first flew in June 1923 and was tail heavy, a fault rectified by an increase in length (several sources, e.g. put the length at about but L'A√©rophile, a year after the first flight, gives ). By July five examples had been built and all appeared at the Gothenburg International Aero Show late in that month. On 10 August 1923 one set a Swedish altitude record of . Military testing proceeded until 15 March 1924, when there was a fatal, structural wing failure on one J 23. Though work on the aircraft continued and some modifications like an increase in tail area were made, the J 23 was thereafter seen as too fragile for service use. Work had also been proceeding on the J 24, similar to the J 23 but with a much more powerful Hispano-Suiza 8F V-8 engine. Following the J 23 accident, the sole J 24 was converted into a single bay biplane designated the J 24B. It was flown in 1925 but, overweight, its performance was not good enough to interest the military.

He twice served as a member of the Vermont House of Representatives, and served as an associate justice of the Vermont Supreme Court from 1980 to 1985.Obituary: Wynn Thomas Underwood, Barre-Montpelier Times-Argus, October 25, 2005.Sam Hemingway, Ex- Supreme Court justice dies, Burlington Free Press, October 22, 2005. Biography Underwood grew up on a farm in Sudbury, Vermont. He attended the one-room Hill School in Orwell and then Brandon High School and Berkshire School in Sheffield, Massachusetts. Underwood attended Dartmouth College for two years before enlisting in the U.S. Army during World War II; he fought with the 87th Mountain Infantry Regiment ski troops (later merged into the 10th Mountain Division). After returning home, Underwood traveled the Caribbean as a freelance writer until returning home to Vermont. In 1947, at the age of twenty-one, he was elected as a Democrat to the Vermont House of Representatives as the representative of Sudbury. He was one of the youngest members of the Vermont General Assembly. Using the G.I. Bill, Wynn attended Boston University Law School, receiving his J.D. in 1952. Wynn served his legal apprenticeship with Asa Bloomer in Rutland, and then practiced two years with Osmer C. Fitts in Brattleboro before opening his own law office in Middlebury. Wynn was elected state's attorney for Addison County, serving from 1955 to 1957. Wynn then joined the law firm of Conley, Foote & Underwood in Middlebury from 1957 to 1962, and then formed his own law firm, Underwood, Lynch & Ketcham in Middlebury 1962 to 1972. Wynn was chairman of the Middlebury selectboard from 1967 to 1972. Wynn was president of the Vermont Trial Lawyers Association from 1969 to 1970 and was president of the Addison County Bar Association from 1968 to 1970. Wynn was counsel to U.S. Senator George Aiken in 1965 for the nation's first rural water bill, benefiting Addison, Bridport, and Shoreham. President Lyndon B. Johnson invited Wynn to the White House for the signing of the bill. In 1970, Wynn was again elected to the Vermont House of Representatives, from Middlebury, Weybridge, and Ripton. During his term, a vacancy opened on the Vermont Superior Court, and Wynn was named to the position by joint election of the House and Senate. Wynn served on the Superior Court from 1972 to 1980. In one of his best-known cases, Wynn presided over a landmark 1977 Chittenden Superior Court case in which the plaintiff, who was paralyzed in a skiing accident, won a $1.5 million judgment, which at the time was believed to be the largest in the state's history. Underwood ruled that the case could proceed, and that the inherent risks of skiing did not automatically bar a recovery. In a 1980 interview, Underwood said that as a result of this ruling, he received \\"poison-pen letters from the length and breadth of the United States.\\" In 1980, Governor Richard A. Snelling appointed Wynn to the Vermont Supreme Court as an associate justice, succeeding Rudolph J. Daley. Wynn served in that position from 1980 to 1985. He was known for his pro-individual rights philosophy. After Snelling selected Frederic Allen, who was not previously a judge, to be chief justice in late 1984, Wynn abruptly resigned, stating that was disappointed in being passed over. The vacancy created by Underwood's resignation allowed the incoming governor, Democrat Madeleine Kunin, to make an appointment in her first year in office. Wynn was elected president of the Vermont Bar Association, served from 1981 to 1982. Wynn later served as vice chairman of the Judicial Conduct Board from 1991 to 1996. Underwood died at the age of 83, on October 20, 2005, at his home in Shelburne, after a long illness.

Biography  Dinu Grigoresco was the grandson of Nicolae Grigorescu, one of the leading Romanian painters of the nineteenth century. He studied at the Fine Arts Academy of Bucharest before leaving for Paris in 1939, where he won a scholarship to the National School of Fine Arts. He would spend the rest of his life in France. He initially studied under L√©on Sabatier and Nicolas Untersteller, though it was the two years that he spent in Andr√© Lhote‚Äôs studio that most influenced his work. A member of the lyrical abstraction group, he moved in the artistic and literary circles of postwar Paris, befriending, among others, Francis Gruber, Jean Dewasne, and Constantin Brancusi.Edwin Constantin Fianu, ‚ÄúDinu Grigoresco √† Montr√©al,‚Äù Magazin‚ÄôArt, 2.1 (1989) : 46. In 1956, he exhibited for the first time at the Salon des Surind√©pendants in Paris. Beginning in 1957, he also contributed regularly to the Salon des R√©alit√©s Nouvelles. France's Ministry of Culture purchased the painting that he exhibited at the 1974 edition of that salon for the Mus√©e d‚ÄôArt Moderne de la ville de Paris. Grigoresco participated in group exhibitions in Munich (1960) and Luxembourg (1972) and his work was featured in solo exhibitions at the Galerie du Haut-Pav√© in Paris (1957), as well as in Nantes (1975, 1982, and 1986) and in Montreal (1989). Under the influence of Andr√© Lhote, his paintings were initially marked by cubism, though they gradually evolved towards lyrical abstraction.Ionel Jianou, ‚ÄúGrigoresco, Dinu- Alexandre,‚Äù in Romanian Artists in the West: Anthology, ed. Ionel Jianu (Los Angeles, American Romanian Academy of Arts and Sciences, 1986) : 79. His work falls into two distinct periods. In the first period, black predominates and the artist shunned galleries and the commercialisation of his work. The death of his spouse marked a moment of deep rupture in his art, however. Grigoresco abandoned painting for several years and destroyed part of his inventory of artwork. In the early 1970s, the artist resumed his work. Upward circular movements continue to predominate in this second artistic phase, but the pictorial synthesis is brighter.Ibid.

During 1667 Gantimur, along with his relatives and forty elders of his tribe, went over to the Russians to seek an alliance. An immediate attempt made by the Qing authorities to secure his return by force was unsuccessful, and special envoys sent by order of the Kangxi Emperor were also unsuccessful persuading Gantimur to come back to the side of the Qing. In 1684, Gantimur was baptized as a Christian into the Russian Orthodox Church and entered the ranks of the Russian nobility with the title and name of Prince Peter Gantimurov. The government in Moscow put him in charge of some of the Tungus and Mongol tribes of the newly acquired Transbaikal region. For permanent residence he chose Nerchinsk.

Paul Snape, who helped lead the University of Michigan to the NCAA Division I Men's Soccer Championship College Cup Final Four, was named men's soccer head coach at Butler University in January 2011. He became the sixth men's head coach in Butler's soccer history. The former Michigan Associate Head Coach is in his fourth year with the Bulldogs, and he's guided the Bulldogs through three different conferences. Snape led the Bulldogs from the Horizon League to the Atlantic 10 Conference and then to the Big East Conference. In his first season at Butler, Snape guided a young Butler team to a 7‚Äì8‚Äì3 record. His first collegiate victory as a head coach came against his former team, the Michigan Wolverines men's soccer, in the opening game of the 2011 Michigan Invitational. Prior to the match, he received an NCAA Tournament ring in a special ceremony honoring Michigan's Final Four team. In 2012, Snape led the Bulldogs to a 5‚Äì8‚Äì5 record against a schedule that included seven NCAA Tournament teams, and last season Butler recorded an 11‚Äì8‚Äì1 mark while competing in the BIG EAST. The Bulldogs' 2013 season ended with an overtime loss in the semifinals of the BIG EAST Championship. Snape joined Butler's staff after spending eight seasons at Michigan. He served as an assistant coach for the Wolverines for six seasons, before being promoted to Associate Head Coach in 2009. He helped lead Michigan to four NCAA Tournament appearances, including a berth in the 2003 Elite Eight and this year's Final Four appearance. Michigan finished the 2010 season with a school-record 17‚Äì5‚Äì3 final ledger and its first-ever Big Ten Tournament title. In addition to his coaching experience at Michigan, Snape served for one season as head coach of the Michigan Bucks in the USL Premier Development League. He guided the team to the Elite Eight of the league in 2005. He's also served as an assistant coach for the Michigan Olympic Development Program (2001‚Äì07) and as a youth coach for the Michigan Rush SC (2006‚Äì08), Vardar SC U.S. Soccer Development Academy(2003, 2009‚Äì10), Birmingham Bloomfield SC (2002‚Äì06) and Bloomfield Force SC (1999‚Äì2002). Snape came to Michigan following a seven-year playing career with the Michigan Bucks. He helped lead the Bucks to five divisional titles (1997‚Äì2000, 2003) and a regional crown in 1997. The Bucks reached the third round of the 2003 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup. Snape was selected to the PDL All-League Team in 1997 and 2000. A 2000 graduate of Oakland University, Snape was a four-year letterwinner and two-year men's soccer captain (1999 & 2000) for the Grizzlies. He was a three-time Mid-Continent Conference first team All-League selection and a three-time All-Region performer, 1998‚Äì2000. He was a conference Academic Award Winner in 1999 and 2000. Following his senior season, he was selected to play in the 2001 Senior Bowl. Snape holds a National ‚ÄúA‚Äù Coaching License from the United State Soccer Federation, and he's a member of the National Soccer Coaches Association of America, the United States Soccer Federation and the United Kingdom Professional Footballers‚Äô Association.

The circuit topology of a linear polymer refers to arrangement of its intra-molecular contacts. Examples of linear polymers with intra-molecular contacts are nucleic acids and proteins. For defining the circuit topology, contacts are defined depending on the context. For proteins with disulfide bonds, these bonds could be considered as contacts. In a context where beta-beta interactions in proteins are more relevant, these interactions are used to define the circuit topology. As such, circuit topology framework can be applied to a wide range of applications including protein folding and analysis of genome architecture. In particular, data from Hi-C and related technologies can be readily analysed using circuit topology framework. For a chain with two binary contacts, three arrangements are available: parallel, series and crossed. For a chain with n contacts, the topology can be described by an n by n matrix in which each element illustrates the relation between a pair of contacts and may take one of the three states, P, S and X. Multivalent contacts can also be categorised in full or via decomposition into several binary contacts. Similarly, circuit topology allows for classification of the pairwise arrangements of chain crossings and tangles, thus providing a complete 3D description of folded chains. Circuit topology has implications for folding kinetics and molecular evolution and has been applied to engineer polymers including protein origami. Circuit topology along with contact order and size are determinants of folding rate of linear polymers. The topology of the cellular proteome and natural RNA reflect evolutionary constraints on biomolecular structures. Topology landscape of biomolecules can be characterized and evolution of molecules can be studied as transition pathways within the landscape.  Further reading  * A.

The group is known for its socially-conscious lyrics and strong live performances. Ben Hugues at Uber Rock says that \\"Live, they are an explosive ball of energy with perfect soulful vocals from Delila and rock 'n' roll chaos from the fingers of Edgey, a man who literally rips the strings from his guitar on a nightly basis.\\" The duo started writing protest song and playing small gigs when Pires was studying for a degree in political science. He mentions Howlin' Wolf, Bob Dylan, Pete Seeger, Buffy Sainte-Marie and Woody Guthrie among their musical influences. The group can get very political, with songs about the situation of the First Nations in the United States, war, working class poverty and the abuse of power. A streak of hope runs through the revolutionary lyrics. Says Pires: \\"The point of the song Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Indian Blood, is that ultimately it will be the youth who free society, whether it‚Äôs the inner child in us or the actual youth who just get so sick of this whole mess that we‚Äôre in. The American Revolution was supposed to liberate people and it just ended up oppressing many for hundreds of years after and the song is about how the youth are going to take all the risks and ultimately take over. We‚Äôre promoting total liberation and we can achieve it in our lifetime, that‚Äôs optimistic!\\" Paz has always been an environmentalist: \\"Very early in my life, I think grade school. I started getting involved with Green Peace and environmental causes around 3rd grade. I knew that we weren‚Äôt living in a very natural way. I used to get little kid books that were about indigenous cultures and felt that we should live as nomads.\\" In January 2013, they released a 5-song EP titled \\"New York, I Do Mind Dying\\". Rage Against the Machine guitarist Tom Morello introduced the band to his bandmate, drummer Brad Wilk, who subsequently joined the band between 2014 and 2015. Their debut album, We Will Reign, was released on August 19, 2014. The album was produced by Brendan O'Brien and Brendan Benson. That was to be their last production with Epic Records (a Sony label), with which they broke to preserve their editorial independence. The band made their network television debut on August 27, 2014, playing \\"Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Indian Blood\\" on the Late Show with David Letterman. They opened for Robert Plant in the fall of 2014 to support his Lullaby and... The Ceaseless Roar tour. In 2015, they joined The Who on the European leg of their 'The Who Hits 50' tour.
