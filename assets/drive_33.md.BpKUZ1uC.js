The company was formed in 1998 through the acquisition and merger of the leasing firms Cargowaggon and International Wagon Services (Tiphook). Touax acquired the operations of GE Capital Rail Services in 2015.Touax acquires 2 000 GE wagons History Cargowaggon Gmbh was founded in Frankfurt, Germany by Swiss shipping company Danzas Holding AG, to undertake trans-European shipment of customers rail cargo. The company specified and purchased wagons from mainly German manufacturers, which were then sub-leased or hired to customers. The company was started through an invitation to manufacture and manage new rail vehicles for Ford Europe in 1979, to allow transportation of motor vehicle sub- assemblies between various European factories. By 1997 jointly owned by Australian business services company Brambles Industries, and Danzas, the company was purchased by GE Capital Services. In May 1998, GE bought International Wagon Services Ltd in Bromley, Kent United Kingdom, , via connection,ebscohost.com which operated 2,100 railway wagons under the Tiphook brand. By 1999, the newly named GE Rail Services had integrated Cargowaggon GmbH and International Wagon Services Ltd/Tiphook Rail Ltd, resulting in a company with offices in the UK, Germany, France, Italy and Sweden. The company had in excess of 4,600 wagons, of which 2,000 were suitable for Channel Tunnel traffic. In 1999 the fleet includes wagons for intermodal, automotive, infrastructure, construction, steel, hazardous and general cargoes. Railway wagons=British Rail VGA British Leyland had used rail to transport a wide range of car parts between their various factories, particularly engines. In the late 1960s, BR modified some of its very large four wheeled ferry vans in the late 1960s, sub coded under TOPS as VQX. Via taut weather proof vinyl side curtains, these wagons allowed easy access to load a number of palletised engines. Ford started using the same wagons in the UK, including on cross- channel traffic to Germany. In the late 1970s, Ford had sub-contracted its inter-factory transport to Danzas. As the UK had the most restrictive loading gauge in European railways, the two jointly approached British Rail to agree a new design, which resulted in Ford placing an order for private owner wagons with Cargowaggon to make a replacement for the ageing VQX. The result was a twin-axle sliding door all metal van. The design proved so successful, that in the early 1980s Ford again approached Cargowaggon for a new design, this time a slightly longer twin-axle sliding door all metal van, which was adapted by British Rail to become the VGA. Cargowaggon IGA So successful was the project for Cargowaggon, they extended the project. The problem of the twin axle design was that although its short length meant that it easily fitted on the cross-English Channel rail ferry, its long wheelbase restricted the minimum radius on which it could be used. The resultant longer length wagon, based on a twin EVA bogie, twin axle design, the IGA spawned three basic variants: *Curtain sided *Sliding metal door *Open flat waggon The Cargowaggon IGA is now the most commonly used trans-European railway wagon, particularly popular since the opening of the Channel Tunnel, resulting in a design which has been improved over the developing years as opposed to replaced.

It describes the actions of party as well as its point of view on issues and events in the Philippines. It serves as the national publication of the CPP, with other regional publications focusing on specific regional news. Ang Bayan is published semimonthly on the 7th and 21st of each month with additional \\"special issues\\" when an important event occurs. It is always originally published in Filipino but is subsequently translated into English, Cebuano, Ilokano, Waray and Hiligaynon.  History  Ang Bayan was founded by CPP Founding Chairman Jose Maria Sison, under the nom de guerre Amado Guerrero on May 1, 1969, following the events of the First Great Rectification Movement and the formation of the New People's Army. Guerrero saw the need for a periodical to propagate the Party's basic principles and program for revolution. Ang Bayan was first published every few months on mimeograph and consisted of four sections: editorials, local news, international news, and CPP documents. Its first issue was published in Central Luzon. From its inception until 1975, Guerrero served as the editor-in-chief of the paper, while also contributing heavily to the articles being published. From 1969 to 1972, Ang Bayan served chiefly as the vehicle for the theoretical foundations of the CPP. Its news articles, through Guerrero's writing, also defied conventional journalistic convention and were politically loaded. It also defied conventions in construction of leads, writing reports, and so on, owing to the volunteer nature of the publication, its purpose as a propaganda tool, and Guerrero's own lack of experience as a journalist. In 1976, editorship passed on to Antonio Zumel, a veteran journalist and organizer. Zumel was President of the National Press Club from 1969 to 1971 until he was forced underground due to the declaration of Martial Law in 1972. Zumel instituted reforms in the Ang Bayan and expanded the editorial team, getting other veteran journalists to write with him. Guerrero's involvement was lessened but he still played a key role in guiding the political line of the publication. Under Zumel, Ang Bayan was published biweekly. The birth of Rebolusyon, the CPP's theoretical journal, also freed Ang Bayan from theoretical discussions which were the norm under Sison. Writers for regional publications were also deputized as Ang Bayan correspondents under Zumel. Zumel also ensured that style conventions and basic journalistic principles were followed in news published by Ang Bayan. He also introduced soft news and human-interest stories in the publication. In 1998, Ang Bayan was being published quarterly. A decision was made and the publication began to be published online through the National Democratic Front's official website. Gregorio Rosal, or Ka Roger, headed the shift in online work. By 2001, issues of Ang Bayan were being published along with statements from the CPP, NPA, and NDF through its website, Philippine Revolution Web Central. This also allowed Ang Bayan to be published more frequently, owing to the ease of news-gathering and access, leading to the present schedule of bimonthly publication.  Distribution  During the early years of Ang Bayan, the CPP's Central Publishing House (CPH) produced anywhere from 500 to 1,000 copies per issue. This was eventually decentralized to different regions as the Party grew in size and strength. The CPH began focusing on creating stencil master copies and distributing them to regional bases to be reproduced using V-type silkscreens, increasing overall reproduction. Today, issues of Ang Bayan can readily be found online through the CPP's official website.

Designed by architect Mortimer Dickerson Metcalfe in the Mediterranean Revival style, it was built by Thomas R. Clarke. In 1969 it became vacant and, except for several attempts to reopen it as a retirement hotel, it remained so until 1981 when it was converted into a condominium, the Palm Beach Hotel Condominium. On April 21, 2010, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places as No. 10000212. Part of the fourth floor is now occupied by an Orthodox synagogue, the New Synagogue of Palm Beach.New Synagogue home page History The original Palm Beach Hotel was constructed in 1902 and located on the shoreline of Lake Worth, where the Biltmore Condominiums stand today. The hotel burned down in March 1925 in the same fire that destroyed The Breakers for a second time. Embers from the flames at The Breakers blew across the island and landed on the Palm Beach Hotel, igniting a fire. The Palm Beach Hotel burnt rapidly, with the some 160 guests reportedly only able to retrieve small items. After the fire, the hotel's owner, Sidney Maddock, left Palm Beach and never returned. Maurice Heckscher built a new hotel at the site for approximately $7 million. Opened in February 1926, this 550-room hotel would be known as the Alba Hotel, before being renamed the Biltmore Hotel in 1934. Mortimer Dickinson Metcalfe designed and Thomas A. Clarke built the Palm Beach Hotel at its current location, with construction beginning on May 1, 1925. The site of the new Palm Beach Hotel was originally a dirt road lined by wooden shacks as part of The Styx, a section of town where African-American hotel staff lived until the 1910s. The Palm Beach Hotel reopened on January 9, 1926. More than 1,000 people attended the festivities for the grand opening and danced to a musical accompaniment by the Strauss Orchestra of New York, including Mengo Lazarus Morgenthau, brother of Henry Morgenthau Sr. A story by The Palm Beach Post on the following day included the following description of the building: \\"Three stories in height and 400 feet [121.92 meters] in length, the hotel provides each of the 320 rooms an outlook either on Lake Worth or the ocean. The spacious dining room, surrounded by a low wall, gives a sunken garden effect.\\" Unlike some other hotels in Palm Beach, the Palm Beach Hotel did not often attract particularly wealthy guests.

Biography Thomas E. McNamara was born in New Haven, Connecticut in 1940. He was educated at Manhattan College, graduating with a B.A. in 1962. He then attended the University of Notre Dame, receiving an M.A. In 1965, McNamara joined the United States Foreign Service. As a diplomat, he was at various times stationed in Paris, Lubumbashi, Bukavu, Moscow, and Bogota. In the 1970s, he was active in the negotiation of several major arms control agreements, serving in the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency in 1974 and 1975. From 1980 to 1983, he was Deputy Chief of Mission at the United States Embassy to Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo) in Kinshasa. From 1983 to 1986, McNamara was a Deputy Director of the Bureau of Politico-Military Affairs. In 1986, President of the United States Ronald Reagan appointed McNamara to the United States National Security Council as Director of Counterterrorism and Counternarcotics. President Reagan nominated McNamara as United States Ambassador to Colombia in 1988. He held this post until 1991, at which time President George H. W. Bush appointed him as Special Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs and Senior Director for International Programs and African Affairs on the staff of the National Security Council. He served as Acting Coordinator for Counterterrorism 1992-1993. McNamara became Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs in July 1993, and then, following nomination by President Bill Clinton and Senate confirmation, became Assistant Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs on October 12, 1994. He held this office until January 9, 1998. He also served in 1997 and 1998 as Special Negotiator for Panama Canal Reversion. McNamara retired from government service in 1998, becoming President and CEO of the Americas Society and the Council of the Americas in New York City. Following the September 11 attacks, McNamara, as an expert in counter-terrorism, returned to government service as Senior Advisor for Counter Terrorism and Homeland Security to the Secretary of State until July 2004. Following passage of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, President George W. Bush on March 15, 2006 appointed McNamara Program Manager for the Information Sharing Environment reporting through the Director of National Intelligence to the President and the Congress. He is the third recipient of the National Intelligence Distinguished Public Service Medal. References *Appointment of Thomas E.

The boundary problem occurs because of the loss of neighbors in analyses that depend on the values of the neighbors. While geographic phenomena are measured and analyzed within a specific unit, identical spatial data can appear either dispersed or clustered depending on the boundary placed around the data. In analysis with point data, dispersion is evaluated as dependent of the boundary. In analysis with areal data, statistics should be interpreted based upon the boundary.  Definition  In spatial analysis, four major problems interfere with an accurate estimation of the statistical parameter: the boundary problem, scale problem, pattern problem (or spatial autocorrelation), and modifiable areal unit problem. The boundary problem occurs because of the loss of neighbours in analyses that depend on the values of the neighbours. While geographic phenomena are measured and analyzed within a specific unit, identical spatial data can appear either dispersed or clustered depending on the boundary placed around the data. In analysis with point data, dispersion is evaluated as dependent of the boundary. In analysis with area data, statistics should be interpreted based upon the boundary. In geographical research, two types of areas are taken into consideration in relation to the boundary: an area surrounded by fixed natural boundaries (e.g., coastlines or streams), outside of which neighbours do not exist, or an area included in a larger region defined by arbitrary artificial boundaries (e.g., an air pollution boundary in modeling studies or an urban boundary in population migration). In an area isolated by the natural boundaries, the spatial process discontinues at the boundaries. In contrast, if a study area is delineated by the artificial boundaries, the process continues beyond the area. If a spatial process in an area occurs beyond a study area or has an interaction with neighbours outside artificial boundaries, the most common approach is to neglect the influence of the boundaries and assume that the process occurs at the internal area. However, such an approach leads to a significant model misspecification problem. That is, for measurement or administrative purposes, geographic boundaries are drawn, but the boundaries per se can bring about different spatial patterns in geographic phenomena. It has been reported that the difference in the way of drawing the boundary significantly affects identification of the spatial distribution and estimation of the statistical parameters of the spatial process. The difference is largely based on the fact that spatial processes are generally unbounded or fuzzy-bounded, but the processes are expressed in data imposed within boundaries for analysis purposes. Although the boundary problem was discussed in relation to artificial and arbitrary boundaries, the effect of the boundaries also occurs according to natural boundaries as long as it is ignored that properties at sites on the natural boundary such as streams are likely to differ from those at sites within the boundary. The boundary problem occurs with regard not only to horizontal boundaries but also to vertically drawn boundaries according to delineations of heights or depths (Pineda 1993). For example, biodiversity such as the density of species of plants and animals is high near the surface, so if the identically divided height or depth is used as a spatial unit, it is more likely to find fewer number of the plant and animal species as the height or depth increases.  Types and examples  By drawing a boundary around a study area, two types of problems in measurement and analysis takes place. The first is an edge effect. This effect originates from the ignorance of interdependences that occur outside the bounded region. Griffith and Griffith and Amrhein highlighted problems according to the edge effect. A typical example is a cross-boundary influence such as cross-border jobs, services and other resources located in a neighbouring municipality. The second is a shape effect that results from the artificial shape delineated by the boundary. As an illustration of the effect of the artificial shape, point pattern analysis tends to provide higher levels of clustering for the identical point pattern within a unit that is more elongated. Similarly, the shape can influence interaction and flow among spatial entities. For example, the shape can affect the measurement of origin-destination flows since these are often recorded when they cross an artificial boundary. Because of the effect set by the boundary, the shape and area information is used to estimate travel distances from surveys, or to locate traffic counters, travel survey stations, or traffic monitoring systems.Kirby, H. R. (1997) Buffon's needle and the probability of intercepting short-distance trips by multiple screen-line surveys. Geographical Analysis, 29 64‚Äì71. From the same perspective, Theobald (2001; retrieved from) argued that measures of urban sprawl should consider interdependences and interactions with nearby rural areas. In spatial analysis, the boundary problem has been discussed along with the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP) inasmuch as MAUP is associated with the arbitrary geographic unit and the unit is defined by the boundary. For administrative purposes, data for policy indicators are usually aggregated within larger units (or enumeration units) such as census tracts, school districts, municipalities and counties. The artificial units serve the purposes of taxation and service provision. For example, municipalities can effectively respond to the need of the public in their jurisdictions. However, in such spatially aggregated units, spatial variations of detailed social variables cannot be identified. The problem is noted when the average degree of a variable and its unequal distribution over space are measured.  Suggested solutions and evaluations on the solutions  Several strategies for resolving geographic boundary problems in measurement and analysis have been proposed.Martin, R. J. (1987) Some comments on correction techniques for boundary effects and missing value techniques. Geographical Analysis 19, 273‚Äì282.Wong, D. W. S., and Fotheringham, A. S. (1990) Urban systems as examples of bounded chaos: exploring the relationship between fractal dimension, rank-size and rural-to-urban migration. Geografiska Annaler 72, 89‚Äì99. To identify the effectiveness of the strategies, Griffith reviewed traditional techniques that were developed to mitigate the edge effects: ignoring the effects, undertaking a torus mapping, construction of an empirical butter zone, construction of an artificial butter zone, extrapolation into a buffer zone, utilizing a correction factor, etc. The first method (i.e., the ignorance of the edge effects), assumes and infinite surface in which the edge effects do not occur. In fact, this approach has been used by traditional geographical theories (e.g., central place theory). Its main shortcoming is that empirical phenomena occur within a finite area, so an infinite and homogeneous surface is unrealistic. The remaining five approaches are similar in that they attempted to produce unbiased parameter estimation, that is, to provide a medium by which the edge effects are removed. (He called these operational solutions as opposed to statistical solutions to be discussed below.) Specifically, the techniques aim at a collection of data beyond the boundary of the study area and fit a larger model, that is, mapping over the area or over-bounding the study area.Ripley, B. D. (1979) Tests of \\"randomness\\" for spatial point patterns. Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B 41, 368‚Äì374. Through simulation analysis, however, Griffith and Amrhein identified the inadequacy of such an overbounding technique. Moreover, this technique can bring about issues related to large-area statistics, that is, ecological fallacy. By expanding the boundary of the study area, micro-scale variations within the boundary can be ignored. As alternatives to operational solutions, Griffith examined three correction techniques (i.e., statistical solutions) in removing boundary- induced bias from inference. They are (1) based on generalized least squares theory, (2) using dummy variables and a regression structure (as a way of creating a buffer zone), and (3) regarding the boundary problem as a missing values problem. However, these techniques require rather strict assumptions about the process of interest.Yoo, E.-H. and Kyriakidis, P. C. (2008) Area-to- point prediction under boundary conditions. Geographical Analysis 40, 355‚Äì379. For example, the solution according to the generalized least squares theory utilizes time-series modeling that needs an arbitrary transformation matrix to fit the multidirectional dependencies and multiple boundary units found in geographical data. Martin also argued that some of the underlying assumptions of the statistical techniques are unrealistic or unreasonably strict.Martin, R. J. (1989) The role of spatial statistical processes in geographic modeling. In D. A. Griffith (ed) Spatial Statistics: Past, Present, and Future. Institute of Mathematical Geography: Syracuse, NY, pp. 107‚Äì129. Moreover, Griffith (1985) himself also identified the inferiority of the techniques through simulation analysis.Griffith, D. A. (1985) An evaluation of correction techniques for boundary effects in spatial statistical analysis: contemporary methods. Geographical Analysis 17, 81‚Äì88. As particularly applicable using GIS technologies,Haslett, J., Wills, G., and Unwin, A. (1990) SPIDER: an interactive statistical tool for the analysis of spatially distributed data. International Journal of Geographical Information Systems 3, 285‚Äì296.Openshaw, S., Charlton, M., and Wymer, C. (1987) A mark I geographical analysis machine for the automated analysis of point pattern data. International Journal of Geographical Information Systems 1, 335‚Äì350. a possible solution for addressing both edge and shape effects is to an re-estimation of the spatial or process under repeated random realizations of the boundary. This solution provides an experimental distribution that can be subjected to statistical tests. As such, this strategy examines the sensitivity in the estimation result according to changes in the boundary assumptions. With GIS tools, boundaries can be systematically manipulated. The tools then conduct the measurement and analysis of the spatial process in such differentiated boundaries. Accordingly, such a sensitivity analysis allows the evaluation of the reliability and robustness of place-based measures that defined within artificial boundaries.BESR (2002) Community and Quality of Life: Data Needs for Informed Decision Making. Board on Earth Sciences and Resources: Washington, DC. In the meantime, the changes in the boundary assumptions refer not only to altering or tilting the angles of the boundary, but also differentiating between the boundary and interior areas in examination and considering a possibility that isolated data collection points close to the boundary may show large variances.

Within the state of Louisiana, the highway travels from the national southern terminus at the junction of Interstate 20 (I-20), US 167, and Louisiana Highway 146 (LA 146) in Ruston to the Arkansas state line at Junction City. The route is entirely concurrent with US 167 within Louisiana and northward to El Dorado, Arkansas. From the diamond interchange with I-20 in Ruston, located roughly midway between the cities of Minden and Monroe, US 63 winds through the piney hills of rural Lincoln and Union parishes. The highway passes through several small communities, including Vienna, Dubach, Bernice, and Lillie. The point in Junction City where US 63 and US 167 cross the state line also forms the junction of two Louisiana parishes, one Arkansas county, and three congressional districts. US 63 is Louisiana's most recent U.S. Highway designation, although it has existed outside the state since 1926. Its southern terminus was previously located in Memphis, Tennessee, carried into the city from Turrell, Arkansas via I-55. In 1999, the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) approved a relocation and extension of the route south from West Memphis, Arkansas over existing U.S. and state highways to its current terminus in Ruston, Louisiana. US 63 is currently the only U.S. Highway in Louisiana with the same number as an active state highway, although LA 63 is located at a sufficient distance to prevent confusion to motorists. Route description=Ruston to Bernice From the south, US 63 begins at a diamond interchange with I-20 (exit 85) in Ruston, a city in Lincoln Parish. The interstate connects with the metropolitan areas of Shreveport to the west and Monroe to the east. US 63 heads north through the interchange overlapping the routes of both US 167 and LA 146\\\\. It is initially a divided four-lane highway with twin overpasses across I-20 via the one-way pair of North Trenton and North Vienna Streets. Almost immediately beyond the interstate, however, the travel lanes converge as North Trenton Street widens to an undivided four-lane highway with a center turning lane. US 63 proceeds in this capacity through the suburban area north of downtown Ruston and into the small rural town of Vienna. Here, LA 146 departs to the west, but US 63 will remain paired with US 167 throughout the remainder of its distance in Louisiana. Heading north through Vienna, the center lane gives way to a grassy median, and the highway begins to wind gently through the pine forests of northern Louisiana on a broad right-of-way. After passing through an area known as Unionville, US 63 enters Dubach and becomes locally known as McMullen Street. The right-of-way narrows and regains its center lane through the small town. Passing one block to the west of the old Main Street, US 63 briefly overlaps LA 151 as the latter zigzags between Annie Lee and Hico Streets. North of Dubach, the highway widens again and crosses into Union Parish about north of LA 545. Bernice to Junction City In Union Parish, the highway enters another small town known as Bernice, where it divides onto the one-way pair of Cherry Street (northbound) and Plum Street (southbound). During this stretch, US 63 overlaps LA 2, which zigzags through town between 8th Street and 4th Street. LA 2 is a rural cross-state route connecting with Homer to the west and Farmerville to the east. North of 4th Street, US 63 begins to overlap LA 2 Alt., which utilizes the highway to connect to its parent route. About six blocks later, the one-way pair converges, and US 63 proceeds as an undivided four-lane highway with center lane until LA 2 Alt. turns off to the west toward Haynesville. Regaining its median and wide right-of-way, US 63 travels due north through the village of Lillie. Here, it intersects the northern terminus of LA 15 just west of Spearsville. North of Lillie, the highway curves to the northwest and travels for about before reaching the larger village of Junction City. US 63 turns due north as the median is replaced by a center lane for the final time. Simultaneously, the highway begins to travel along the Union‚ÄìClaiborne parish line while following South Main Street. The intersection of Main and Fifth Streets forms the northern terminus of LA 9, another connection to Homer, Claiborne's parish seat. Just two blocks later, at an intersection with Third Street, US 63 crosses the state line into the Arkansas portion of Junction City. Here, a roadside marker identifies the community as being located \\"at the junction of 2 states, 1 county, 2 parishes, and 3 congressional districts.\\" US 63 proceeds north toward El Dorado, Arkansas still co-signed with US 167. Route classification and data US 63 is classified by the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development (La DOTD) as an urban principal arterial in Ruston and as a rural principal arterial northward. Daily traffic volume in 2013 peaked at 18,900 vehicles in Ruston near the I-20 interchange and generally remained between 2,500 and 5,000 vehicles otherwise. The posted speed limit is along the rural divided four-lane segments, reduced to along undivided four-lane portions and through most towns. It is reduced even further to within the city of Ruston and the town of Bernice. History=Extension into Louisiana US 63 was designated in November 1926 as one of the original routes of the numbered U.S. Highway system. It initially traveled from a junction with US 61 at Turrell, Arkansas (a point northwest of Memphis, Tennessee) to Des Moines, Iowa. In 1999, the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) approved a relocation and extension of the route that moved its southern terminus to its present location in Ruston, Louisiana. At this point, US 63 had terminated in Memphis proper by way of a concurrency with I-55. The change pulled the route back out of Tennessee and extended it southward from West Memphis, Arkansas for approximately over existing U.S. and state highways. The portion south of El Dorado, including its entire distance within Louisiana, overlapped part of US 167\\\\. In accordance with this decision, the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development (La DOTD) added US 63 shields to the existing signage installations along US 167 between Ruston and the Arkansas state line. As of 2016, however, US 63 has not been added to the exit signage on I-20 at the new southern terminus. US 63 is Louisiana's most recent U.S. Highway designation, and it became the first within the state to terminate at an interstate highway. It is also the state's only U.S. Highway with the same number as a current state highway (LA 63). In the past, state highways were renumbered when the introduction of a U.S. Highway caused such a duplication. However, LA 63 exists in a different region of Louisiana with confusion to motorists being highly unlikely. TIMED improvements Upon its extension into Louisiana in 1999, US 63 was a two-lane highway outside of the Ruston city limits. However, plans had been underway for over a decade to widen the entire corridor to four lanes as part of an improvement project for the concurrent US 167\\\\. In 1989, the Louisiana Legislature approved the Transportation Infrastructure Model for Economic Development, or TIMED, program. Declared as \\"the single largest transportation infrastructure improvement program\\" in the state's history, it was initially funded from a 4¬¢ per gallon gasoline tax which allowed an estimated completion date around 2031. After falling far behind schedule by the late 1990s, the legislature approved the first of several bond measures to fast-track the program, which included the widening of US 167 from Alexandria to the Arkansas state line (including the US 63 concurrency). The work was carried out in stages throughout the 2000s and into the following decade. In rural areas, the existing right-of-way was broadened to carry a divided four-lane highway with a wide median. The original road bed generally followed the present southbound lanes. In towns and other developed areas, the highway was widened to carry four travel lanes and a center lane with the major exception being the town of Bernice, where a one-way pair was used. Minor deviations from the original right-of-way occurred in Lincoln Parish between Vienna and Unionville, where a series of curves were straightened somewhat. Several portions of the old road survive as dead-end local roads in this area. The widening of US 167 was one of the last TIMED projects to be completed when it was opened to traffic in the summer of 2014.

Within the state of Louisiana, the highway travels from the national southern terminus at US 425/LA 15 in Clayton to the Arkansas state line north of Lake Providence. US 65 parallels the west bank of the Mississippi River through the northeastern portion of Louisiana. It traverses four parishes. Newellton, Tallulah, and Lake Providence, which constitute the largest towns along the route. In Tallulah, US 65 has a junction with Interstate 20, the principal highway across northern Louisiana. I-20 connects to a bridge across the Mississippi River at Vicksburg, Mississippi, which is the only automobile crossing between Greenville and Natchez. The Natchez‚ÄìVidalia Bridge was part of US 65 prior to 2005 when the designation was replaced by that of US 425 between Clayton and Natchez. During the years 1936 to 1951, US 65 was more than double its present length as it overlapped US 61 from Natchez south to New Orleans. Route description=Clayton to Tallulah From the south, US 65 begins at a junction with the concurrent US 425/LA 15 in Clayton, a small town in northern Concordia Parish. US 425/LA 15 travels along a widely spaced four-lane one-way pair through town en route to its immediate destinations of Ferriday and Sicily Island. US 65 heads northeast from this junction as an undivided two- lane highway and crosses into Tensas Parish. An intersection with LA 568 at Azucena leads to Lake St. John, an oxbow lake of the nearby Mississippi River. Soon afterward, US 65 passes through the western edge of Waterproof, the first of several towns on the route located along the river's west bank. Several minor state highways, such as LA 3209 (Church Lane), connect US 65 with Waterproof's main street. Continuing northeast, US 65 bypasses St. Joseph, the parish seat. However, a junction with LA 128 at Avondale provides access to the town. Just north of St. Joseph, US 65 passes to the west of Lake Bruin, another oxbow lake. Points of interest in this area include Lake Bruin State Park and the Winter Quarters State Historic Site. US 65 proceeds through the western edge of Newellton, a town situated on Lake St. Joseph, a third oxbow lake of the Mississippi River. LA 4 (Verona Street) leads into the center of town and also connects to the city of Winnsboro in neighboring Franklin Parish. After passing through Somerset, US 65 crosses into Madison Parish at a point known as Quimby. US 65 winds gently through southern Madison Parish for before entering Richmond, a small village adjacent to the parish seat, the city of Tallulah. The highway passes through an interchange with I-20 at exit 171, connecting with Vicksburg, Mississippi and Monroe, Louisiana. Entering Tallulah proper, US 65 crosses a bridge over Walnut Bayou and curves northeast onto the undivided four-lane thoroughfare of Bayou Drive, flanked by the bayou and a residential neighborhood. Tallulah to Arkansas state line Heading into the business section of Tallulah, US 65 divides onto the one-way pair of Cedar and Chestnut Streets, thus becoming a divided four-lane highway briefly. One block after crossing the Kansas City Southern Railway (KCS) line, the route intersects US 80 (East Green Street), which serves local traffic along the I-20 corridor. The travel lanes of US 65 converge as the highway heads out of Tallulah and begins to follow alongside the Delta Southern Railroad (DSRR) tracks. North of Tallulah, US 65 travels through an extended stretch of open farmland. Immediately after crossing into East Carroll Parish, the highway passes through the tiny community of Sondheimer. At a point known as Alsatia, US 65 intersects LA 580, which heads west toward Poverty Point, a UNESCO World Heritage Site located near the village of Epps. Continuing due north, US 65 passes through such rural points as Transylvania and Hollybrook before entering the parish seat, Lake Providence, which is located on an oxbow lake of the same name. After crossing the corporate limits, US 65 immediately divides onto the one-way pair of Sparrow and Scarborough Streets. In the center of town, the route turns left onto Lake Street and becomes an undivided two-lane highway again. US 65 takes on the character of a scenic drive as it travels out of town hugging the shore of Lake Providence. Along this stretch is a junction with LA 2 at its eastern terminus, connecting with Oak Grove and Bastrop. Departing from the lake shore, US 65 curves due north and rejoins the straight alignment of the DSRR tracks for its final in Louisiana. The highway crosses into the state of Arkansas just north of Gassoway and proceeds toward Eudora en route to Little Rock. Route classification and data US 65 alternates between a rural and urban principal arterial over the course of its route, as determined by the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development (La DOTD). Daily traffic volume in 2013 peaked at 10,400 vehicles in Tallulah. The remainder of the route generally averaged between 2,200 and 5,800 vehicles with a low of 1,840 reported near the Arkansas state line. The posted speed limit is for most of the route but is reduced as low as within corporate limits. Within Louisiana, the entirety of US 65 serves as part of a National Scenic Byway known as the Great River Road. This byway consists of a network of roads that parallel the Mississippi River through ten states. The Louisiana portion encompasses several state highways, extending as far south as Venice near the mouth of the river. History=Original route and southern extension US 65 was designated in November 1926 as one of the inaugural routes of the numbered U.S. Highway system. It was routed entirely along the existing State Route 3, one of Louisiana's original state highways created only five years earlier. Known as the Scenic Highway, it paralleled the west bank of the Mississippi River through the northeastern portion of the state and served as an important connection between the capital cities of Louisiana and Arkansas. Like Route 3, US 65 once extended further south to Vidalia, a small city opposite Natchez, Mississippi. At the time, a ferry carried the route across the river to connect with US 61, the principal route to New Orleans. In 1934, the US 65 Lakes-to-Gulf Highway Association was formed to promote travel between Minneapolis‚ÄìSt. Paul and New Orleans. One of its principal objectives was having US 65 officially extended from Natchez south to New Orleans. Two years later, the designation was applied to the entire route of US 61 south of Natchez as it traveled back into Louisiana and passed through Baton Rouge en route to its terminus in New Orleans. This change extended US 65 a distance of and allowed motorists to follow a single highway number from New Orleans to Little Rock, Arkansas. It came three years after US 61 was almost entirely relocated between New Orleans and Baton Rouge from its original path alongside the winding Mississippi River onto the modern, streamlined Airline Highway. This routing remained in effect until 1951 when the Louisiana Department of Highways eliminated such lengthy U.S. Highway concurrencies, and the southern terminus of US 65 was moved back to Natchez. Early improvements and paving When originally designated in 1926, US 65 was a gravel-surfaced highway throughout its route in Louisiana. Hard-surfacing of the highway was promised by Huey P. Long during his successful 1928 gubernatorial campaign and also by state senator and Louisiana Highway Commission chairman, O.K. Allen. By 1930, the perceived lack of initiative in fulfilling this promise drew much criticism from the pair's political opponents based in northeastern Louisiana. However, in October of that year, bidding was opened for 31 contracts in the \\"largest letting for road and bridge construction in the history of the state\\" up to that time. This included the paving of an stretch of US 65 in East Carroll Parish between Lake Providence and Transylvania that was completed the following year. The remainder of the highway south to Vidalia was provided for soon afterward and was completed by the summer of 1932. This left only the portion between Lake Providence and the Arkansas state line to be hard-surfaced, which was not carried out until the spring of 1938. While the earlier paving projects had closely followed the established gravel alignment, this last project straightened the highway north of Lake Providence by following the Missouri Pacific Railroad line (now the Delta Southern Railroad). The original route had hugged the shore of two oxbow lakes known as Lake Providence and Old River between Highland and Millikin. Natchez‚ÄìVidalia Bridge In 1940, US 65 received a major improvement when the first Natchez‚ÄìVidalia Bridge was constructed across the Mississippi River, replacing a ferry service that had existed for over a century. The bridge's construction was primarily advanced by the state of Mississippi and the local governments of Adams County and the city of Natchez. The project was financed through matching loans totaling almost $3,800,000 from two New Deal programs, the Public Works Administration and the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, which were approved in June 1936 and October 1938, respectively. A toll equaling that of the existing ferry would be charged only until the loans were repaid. Under this arrangement, the Louisiana Legislature aided the project by passing a special bill in June 1938 allowing the bridge to be exempt from state taxes. The location chosen for the new bridge was nearly the same as the ferry landing on the Louisiana side. Construction began in December 1938, and the bridge was officially opened to traffic with great ceremony on September 26, 1940. US 65 shared the new bridge with US 84, which had been extended into Louisiana in 1934. The cantilevered through truss structure was designed by the engineering firm of Ash, Howard and Needles, which had been responsible for the US 80 bridge at Vicksburg a decade earlier. In 1952, the bridge's debts were paid off, and the toll was eliminated on the twelfth anniversary of its opening. While the Natchez‚ÄìVidalia Bridge was under construction, virtually the entire town of Vidalia consisting of about 1,000 citizens, was demolished and rebuilt several blocks away from the river bank. This allowed for the construction of a setback levee that would enable the widening of the river at Natchez and reduce the pressure of the current on its banks, which was cited as a great hazard to both towns. The moving of Vidalia increased the construction cost of the bridge from its original estimate of $2,500,000 to $4,000,000. Route relocation and further improvements Between about 1949 and 1962, virtually the entire route of US 65 was relocated onto a streamlined alignment south of Tallulah, often following the now-abandoned Missouri Pacific Railroad line. This work was accomplished in several stages, beginning with the construction of a new alignment between Ferriday and Waterproof in 1950. The new route traveled through Clayton, bypassing what is now LA 568 along the shore of Lake St. John. At the same time, the town of St. Joseph was bypassed, eliminating a sharp loop through the town that is now part of LA 128 and LA 605. In 1953, US 65 was straightened through the Newellton area, moving the route slightly outside of the town and bypassing another section of the current LA 605 along the shore of Lake St. Joseph. A small loop through the town of Waterproof was bypassed around 1958 and is now another part of LA 568. This was roughly concurrent with the slight straightening of the route through Vidalia, which eliminated some modest curves and bypassed what is now known as Murray Drive. The streamlined alignment between Waterproof and St. Joseph was opened by 1960, and in Madison Parish between Quimby and Tallulah around 1962. Further improvements to US 65 during the mid- to late 1960s involved widening the highway to four lanes through Tallulah and between Vidalia and Ferriday. The four-lane highway was extended from Ferriday to Clayton around 1982 while construction was underway on a second span of the Natchez‚ÄìVidalia Bridge. By the late 1970s, daily traffic counts of 20,000 vehicles on the narrow two-lane span had necessitated the planning of a new crossing. Construction costs for the second span were estimated at $41 million, and the work was completed between 1985 and 1988. The new bridge was officially dedicated on June 21, 1988 and carried two-way traffic briefly while the original bridge was reconditioned. Each bridge then began to carry two lanes of traffic, creating a four-lane highway crossing of the Mississippi River at Natchez. The only major change to US 65 since this time occurred when US 425 was extended from Bastrop, Louisiana to Natchez, Mississippi largely over the existing alignment of LA 15\\\\. US 65 was truncated to its present southern terminus in Clayton as the US 425 designation replaced it between Clayton and Natchez. This change was approved by the American Association of State Highway Officials (AASHTO) in 2005. Major intersectionsBypass route U.S. Highway 65 Bypass (US 65 Byp.) ran in a general north‚Äìsouth direction around Baton Rouge, the capital city of Louisiana. It entirely duplicated the path of US 61 Byp. and existed during the period that US 65 was co-signed with US 61 between New Orleans, Louisiana and Natchez, Mississippi. The route followed the recently constructed Airline Highway around what was then the outside of town, allowing through traffic from the south and east to access the Mississippi River Bridge while avoiding the downtown area. The bypass is now part of mainline US 61 and US 190\\\\. From the south, US 61/65 Byp. began in an area known as Nesser, which was at that time located outside the Baton Rouge city limits. It traveled northwest on Airline Highway as it branched off of mainline US 61/65 (Jefferson Highway). Directly east of the downtown area, the route intersected US 190 (Florida Boulevard) at a traffic circle that has since been replaced by a cloverleaf interchange. With mainline US 190 heading west directly into Downtown Baton Rouge, Airline Highway continued northwest as US 61/65/190 Byp. and intersected State Route 37 (Greenwell Springs Road). The route proceeded to make a bend around the northeast side of the city and crossed State Route 36 (Plank Road). Heading due west a short distance, the bypass rejoined all three mainline U.S. Routes at an interchange with Scenic Highway. From this junction, US 61/65 headed north toward Natchez, Mississippi while US 190 continued west across the old Mississippi River Bridge toward Opelousas co- signed with US 71.

The American Viola Society offers a variety of services to its members and violists worldwide, including the Primrose International Viola Competition, the Gardner Composition Competition, and the Dalton Research Competition; publications, including the Journal of the American Viola Society, the AVS Studio Blog, Teacher's Toolbox, and score downloads; a Viola Bank offering loans of instruments; and a National Teacher Directory. The society has regularly hosted International Viola Congresses as well as American Viola Society Festivals. History In 1971, Myron Rosenblum founded the American Viola Research Society, a subset of the Viola-Forschungsgellschaft, now the International Viola Society (IVS). The organization changed its name in 1978 to the American Viola Society to better reflect the interests of its members. In 1979, David Dalton founded the Primrose International Viola Competition in honor of the great Scottish-American violist William Primrose. That same year, the American Viola Society co-commissioned George Rochberg's Viola Sonata in celebration of Primrose's seventy-fifth birthday. In 1985, the AVS began publishing the Journal of the American Viola Society (JAVS), an outgrowth of the AVS Newsletter that it had previously produced. The JAVS has been a leading source of viola research; notably publishing several articles on the genesis and revision of B√©la Bart√≥k's Viola Concerto. Upon retirement of David Dalton as longtime editor in 1999, JAVS established the David Dalton Viola Research Competition for student members of the society. Primrose International Viola Competition The Primrose International Viola Competition (PIVC) is an international music competition for viola players sponsored by the American Viola Society and named for the 20th-century virtuoso William Primrose. The PIVC has been held regularly since 1987, often in conjunction with biennial meetings of the North American Viola Congress. Eligible participants are 29 years and younger of any nationality. The competition involves three rounds during a week-long festival in which entrants perform a required work as well as several choices from a viola repertoire list that includes solo works, sonatas, concertos and transcriptions by Primrose. Maurice Gardner Composition Competition The AVS inaugurated the biennial Maurice Gardner Composition Competition in 2009. The first winner was pianist/composer Rachel Matthews, whose work Dreams for Viola and Piano was premiered by violist Scott Slapin and the composer at the 2010 International Viola Congress. ;Maurice Gardner Composition Competition laureates * 2010 ‚Äì Rachel Matthews: Dreams for viola and piano (2008); Ourtext Edition * 2012 ‚Äì Michael Djupstrom: Walimai for alto saxophone (or viola) and piano (2005); Bright Press * 2014 ‚Äì Matthew Browne: Exit, Pursued by a Bear for viola solo (2012); Maestoso Music * 2016 ‚Äì Qi Jing: Sonata for solo viola, Threnody (2013) AVS Publications In 2010 the American Viola Society began digital publication of sheet music under the AVS Publications name.

Nationally, US 80 stretched from San Diego, California to Tybee Island, Georgia, going through southern New Mexico from El Paso, Texas, through the towns of Las Cruces, Deming and Lordsburg before entering Arizona. US 80 was a modest long (compared to US 80 in Arizona which was almost long) and was eventually replaced by Interstate 10 leading to the complete removal of US 80 in New Mexico. State Road 80 is a remnant of this route. History Early US 80 sign. Beginning in 1909, New Mexico started using a numbering system for its highways. The first of these was New Mexico Territorial Road 1 (later State Road 1 or NM 1). NM 1 was joined by NM 4 the same year. NM 1 ran from the Texas state line in Anthony north to the Colorado state line near Raton. Further to the west, NM 4 ran from the Arizona state line near Rodeo to a junction with NM 1 in Las Cruces. By 1923, the western end of NM 4 was truncated to Lordsburg. The route between Lordsburg and Rodeo was taken over by NM 42. In 1917, the Dixie Overland Highway was established from San Diego, California to Savannah, Georgia, extending through New Mexico. This auto trail entered New Mexico from the east through Texas, going through Roswell back into Texas to El Paso, before heading back into New Mexico through Mesilla Park, Deming and Lordsburg before aiming southwest into Arizona towards Douglas. Between 1920 and 1923, the Dixie Overland was joined by the Bankhead and Old Spanish Trail highways west of El Paso. By 1925, the Joint Board on Interstate Highways under the Secretary of Agriculture and American Association of State Highway Officials (AASHO), proposed a numbered transcontinental highway system across the country. The proposed system was approved on November 11, 1926. All of NM 4, part of NM 42, the southernmost section of NM 1 became part of U.S. Route 80. Child route US 180 was established between US 80 in Arizona and US 85 in Caballo. The state highway system within New Mexico was renumbered and reworked extensively to accommodate the new U.S. Highway System by 1927 into well marked State Road system. Many overlapping State Road designations along the new U.S. Highways were truncated or eliminated. NM 1 was greatly truncated to make way for US 80 and US 85 while NM 4 and NM 42 were fully decommissioned in favor of US 80 and US 180. An abandoned section of 1960s US 80 in Rodeo. Changes to the routing of US 80 began in 1926. An older routing to Cambray via Aden from Mesilla Park was abandoned in favor of a route through Las Cruces. From 1934 to 1935, the route was slightly altered between Arizona and Road Forks, eliminating an exceptionally long curve over the railroad tracks in Rodeo for a more modest curve into town. The route between Cambray and Deming was also straightened out. US 80 was moved onto a newer road further south from the railroad tracks and straightened out between Road Forks and Deming. Later changes included the bypassing of the route through Cambray between Deming and Las Cruces and the older alignment from Gage to Deming. In the 1950s, a new section of US 80 was constructed around the older route between Anthony and Las Cruces, bypassing many of the towns along the Rio Grande. Changes to the U.S. Highway system after 1926 somewhat affected US 80. Between 1932 and 1935, US 70 was realigned heavily due to the extension of US 60 into New Mexico. The re-routing made US 70 concurrent with US 80 between Lordsburg and Las Cruces and eliminated the original US 180. US 260 was established along part the earlier route of US 70 and NM 11 to US 80 in Deming. In 1944, US 180 was re-established heading west through part of New Mexico along US 62 to US 80 in El Paso. In 1961, US 180 was extended over US 80 from El Paso to Deming and replaced US 260. The establishment of the Interstate Highway system marked the beginning of the end of US 80. By 1965, Interstate 10 had replaced large section sections of US 80. Between 1964 and 1969, US 80 was removed entirely from California. Arizona followed by retiring most of its portion of US 80 on October 28, 1977. On October 6, 1989, the AASHTO approved Arizona and New Mexico's request to remove US 80 from Arizona and most of New Mexico. US 80 had its western terminus truncated to Anthony near the Texas border. In 1991, both New Mexico and Texas requested the removal of US 80 between Anthony and Dallas, citing US 80 as being un-needed, due to being consistently multiplexed with I-10, I-20 and I-30. On October 12, 1991, the AASHTO agreed to this proposal and truncated US 80 to its current western terminus at I-30 in Dallas, Texas. Route description An abandoned 1930s Texaco gas station on NM 418 (old US 70/US 80) west of Deming. US 80 entered New Mexico at the Texas state line in Anthony. Prior to 1956, US 80 used the current routing of SH 20 and NM 478. From there, US 80 continued north through Berino and Vado into Las Cruces. After 1956, US 80 followed present day NM 460 and the western I-10 frontage road, before rejoining the older alignment in Las Cruces. Originally, US 80 continued north on Main Street through the heart of downtown Las Cruces. For a while, the city made Main Street into a Pedestrian street. As of 2016, Main Street is no longer pedestrian only and is now passable by car. From Main, US 80 used Las Cruces Avenue, Hadley Avenue, Valley Drive and Picacho Avenue (US 70) to head west out of Las Cruces. At later dates, US 80 bypassed this route and took Main Street straight to Picacho Avenue. US 80 continued west on Picacho Avenue to I-10. Airport Road, the north frontage road was part of US 80. Past Exit 127, US 80 took I-10's current routing to Exit 116. The older routing took NM 549 west.

This bisected road is still accessible by crossing I-10 at Exit 102 and taking Micro Road northeast to the now abandoned alignment. US 80 continued west on NM 549 then west on I-10 Business Loop and through Deming, New Mexico. In 1926, US 80 used Do√±a Ana Road, De Baca Road and NM 377 before rejoining NM 549. The later routing of US 80 used I-10 from Exit 116 to the I-10 Business Loop. Postcard of the Hub Motel and Cafe on US 70 and US 80 in Deming. Though US 80 later took Pine Street through town and followed I-10 west towards Lordsburg, New Mexico. The roadbed of this route sometimes appears as frontage roads on the northern and southern sides of the Interstate. The older alignment followed Spruce Street west then took NM 418 out of town to Exit 62. Along I-10 heading west to Lordsburg, sections of old US 80 are sometimes visible on the northern side of the Interstate next to the railroad tracks. In Lordsburg, US 80 took Motel Drive through town before returning to the route of I-10. There are some old motels and businesses from the era of US 80 left within Lordsburg. An older abandoned US 80 is still visible between I-10 and the railroad tracks west of town. In Road Forks, I-10 splits away from US 80 which headed south. I-10 between Road Forks and Arizona was once NM 14, which along with SR 86 in Arizona, created a time saving bypass around US 80 between Road Forks and Benson, Arizona. Today, what was US 80 between Arizona and Road Forks is now known as NM 80. Older sections of highway can be viewed alongside the current road, including an old gradual curve in Rodeo. South of Rodeo, US 80 travelled across the Arizona state line and continued west along SR 80 to Douglas. Major intersections This list follows the 1951 alignment.

Lenta.ru Accessed 26 June 2010. people were confirmed to have died with at least 99 others injured and as many as a further 24 unaccounted for. History The mine, owned by Russian company Raspadskaya, is the largest underground coal mine in Russia, producing 10% of the country's coking coal. It has a history of accidents and safety problems. In March 2001, another methane explosion killed four miners and injured six. The mine was shut down for two weeks in 2008 due to safety violations and a worker was killed after part of the mine collapsed in January 2010. Incident The first blast occurred at 20:55 Moscow Summer Time (16:55 UTC) with the second at 01:00 MST (21:00 UTC). The explosions were confirmed by investigators to have been caused by methane gas. A secondary explosion was reported approximately four hours later, with 20 rescue workers now among those missing. The second explosion caused a collapse of the mine's ventilation shaft, drastically reducing the flow of fresh air into the mine. Rescue efforts were suspended after the second blast. By 18 May 2010, 66 people were confirmed to have died, at least 99 injured and 24 remained trapped underground. The Russian emergencies minister confirmed that rescue efforts were ongoing, saying \\"There is always a chance of recovery.\\" Rescue work resumed late on May 9 after methane levels had dropped below safety limits and, at the peak of the operation, 560 people were involved with aid being sent from other parts of Russia. Aftermath Aman Tuleyev, governor of Kemerovo Oblast, has taken charge of the rescue operation. The mine was evacuated after the first explosion and 282 people escaped to the surface. The Russian Energy Ministry has set up a task force to deal with the aftermath of the incident while President Dmitry Medvedev ordered a report from his emergencies minister and a junior energy minister, Vladimir Azbukin visited the scene. Medvedev ordered Prime Minister Vladimir Putin to head a government commission dealing with the aftermath of the incident. The mine company agreed to pay 1 million Russian rubles in compensation (approximately US$ 33,000) to the families of the dead with additional assistance from the state. A government spokesman released a statement in which he said \\"families of the deceased, children of miners will get all the necessary assistance. The government has already discussed the issue with the mine's owners\\". The event occurred the day before Victory Day and officials in the nearby town of Mezhdurechensk, where many of the mine's employees live, cancelled planned celebrations for the following day. A criminal investigation was launched into the incident by Russian authorities and post-mortem examinations were carried out on the bodies of the miners to establish a precise cause of death. The tragedy provoked civil unrest in nearby Mezhdurechensk. Coal miners rallied and occasionally clashed with police, 28 were arrested.Al Jazeera: Russians arrested in mine protest Governor Tuleyev met with the protesters and agreed with some of their demands.ITAR-TASS: Kemerovo reg governor blames coalmine owners for tragedy  The appeal of \\"The Union of Kuznetsk Basin Residents\\"  On 16 May a new movement \\"The Union of Kuznetsk Basin Residents\\" issued an appeal to the President, the people of Russia and to those who live in the region. The authors made five demands: release the detained in the town of Mezhdurechensk, increase miners' minimum salaries threefold, stop persecution of the independent trade union, withdraw the police forces brought from other regions, and introduce monthly meetings of the town administration with the residents. The authors said that they would wait for the reply from the President until 21 May. Then, if their demands were not satisfied, they promised to start political actions.

In the U.S. state of Kansas, US-83 is a main north-south highway that runs from the Oklahoma border north to the Nebraska border. In 1927 the highway that first became known as US-83 was established as K-22. Then between 1930 and 1931, US-83 was extended into Kansas along K-22, which was decommissioned. Then between 1941 and 1944, US-83 and US-183 were swapped within Nebraska and a small portion into Kansas. US-83 was changed to turn north just northeast of Selden and the former alignment of US-83 from northeast of Selden to US-183 east of Woodruff became US-383, now K-383. Route description US-83 enters the Sunflower State, overlapped with US-270 in Seward County, approximately south of Liberal. From here it continues north to Liberal where it intersects US-54 and US-270 ends. North of Liberal, US-83 begins a concurrency with US-160, and the highways remain joined until reaching Sublette, the seat of Haskell County. US-83 and US-160 split north of Sublette; US-160 heads west toward Ulysses, and US-83 continues north toward Garden City. US-50 and US-400 westbound approaching northern end of US-83 overlap At Garden City, US-50 and US-400 join US-83 for a brief concurrency on a bypass around the east and north sides of the city while US-83 Business follows the former routing through downtown. All three routes cross K-156, also known as Kansas Avenue, in the northwest portion of the city. At the north end of the US-50/US-83 Business route, US-83 splits and heads north toward Scott City, while US-50 and US-400 remain joined through the rest of the state. The highway passes through largely unpopulated areas of Finney County and Scott County before reaching a junction with K-96 in downtown Scott City. In northern Scott County, K-4 has its origins at US-83, heading east toward Healy, and US-83 traverses through rolling farmlands until reaching Oakley, the seat of Logan County. US-83 reaches US-40 less than a mile west of I-70, and the two highways jog west for a brief multiplex before US-83 splits and crosses I-70. North of I-70, US-83 intersects US-24 then curves northeast, east of Gem in Thomas County. US-83 continues its northeasterly track through Rexford and Selden. After passing through Selden, US-83 intersects the southern terminus of K-383 and the northern terminus of K-23. From here, US-83 turns north, crosses into Decatur County then continues north and intersects US-36 in Oberlin. Oberlin is the last area of significant population the highway passes in Kansas; the next city is McCook, Nebraska. History In 1927 the highway that first became known as US-83 was established as K-22. Then between 1930 and 1931, US-83 was extended into Kansas along K-22, which was decommissioned. Between July 1938 and 1939, US-183 was altered to follow US-36 east to K-1 in Phillipsburg, which created a short overlap between US-83 and US-183 near Norton. Then between 1941 and 1944, US-183 and US-83 were swapped within Nebraska and a small portion into Kansas. US-83 was changed to turn north just northeast of Selden and US-183 was changed to continue north past Phillipsburg, which eliminated the overlap between the two in Norton.

Although once common in British and American cookbooks, it is now most common in Japan, where it can be found in most restaurants and convenience stores. Coffee jelly can be made using instant mix or from scratch. It is served in restaurants and caf√©s. History Recipes for coffee jelly appear in cookbooks published in England as early as 1817. The earliest recipes call for coffee to be mixed with calves' foot jelly and sometimes call for isinglass or other clarifiers. After the introduction of packaged gelatin, most recipes call for the gelatin to be dissolved in the hot coffee and then molded. In the early 20th century coffee jelly was promoted as a healthier alternative to hot coffee, as it was thought the gelatin would absorb excess acid in the stomach. Jell-O launched a short lived coffee gelatin mix in 1918, but the dessert never gained widespread popularity outside of New England. Today, coffee jelly may still be found in Rhode Island, Massachusetts and other New England states. Durgin-Park restaurant in Boston, which opened in 1827, still offers coffee gelatin made with leftover coffee from the previous day. Japanese coffee jelly was developed during the Taish≈ç period (1912‚Äì1926) in imitation of European molded jellies. It appealed to modern young men with tastes for Western fashion and rose in popularity along with caf√© culture. Coffee jelly has remained popular in Japan and is still widely available. Starbucks launched a coffee jelly frappuccino in Japan in 2016. Description Japanese coffee jelly is made from sweetened coffee added to agar, a gelatin-like substance made from algae and called ' in Japanese. In European and American recipes, traditional gelatin is used rather than agar. It is often cut into cubes and served in a variety of dessert dishes and beverages. Cubes of coffee jelly are sometimes added to milkshakes, at the bottom of an ice cream float, or to garnish an ice cream sundae.

Two days before, the National Constituent Assembly issued a decree that King Louis XVI would retain his throne under a constitutional monarchy. This decision came after Louis and his family had unsuccessfully tried to flee France in the Flight to Varennes the month before. Later that day, leaders of the republicans in France rallied against this decision, eventually leading royalist Marquis de Lafayette to order the massacre. Jacques Pierre Brissot was the editor and main writer of Le Patriote fran√ßais and president of the Comit√© des Recherches of Paris, and he drew up a petition demanding the removal of the king. A crowd of 50,000 people gathered at the Champ de Mars on 17 July to sign the petition, and about 6,000 signed it. However, two suspicious people had been found hiding at the Champ de Mars earlier that day, \\"possibly with the intention of getting a better view of the ladies' ankles\\"; they were hanged by those who found them, and Paris Mayor Jean Sylvain Bailly used this incident to declare martial law. Lafayette and the National Guard under his command were able to disperse the crowd. Georges Danton and Camille Desmoulins led the crowd, and they returned in even higher numbers that afternoon. The larger crowd was also more determined than the first, and Lafayette again tried to disperse it. In retaliation, they threw stones at the National Guard. After firing unsuccessful warning shots, the National Guard opened fire directly on the crowd. The exact numbers of dead and wounded are unknown; estimates range from a dozen to 50 dead.  Context  When Louis XVI and his family fled to Varennes, it set off political turmoil: people felt betrayed and had anger towards the king. Earlier, information had been received by the assembly that there was potentially a plan for the king to flee. The idea that Louis planned on fleeing the Tuileries palace began in early 1791 and was one of the causes of the Day of Daggers on 28 February 1791. The escape event was not subtly planned, and enough suspicions were aroused in those working in the palace that the information trickled down to newspapers. The Marquis de Lafayette promised on his own life that such a thing was untrue, and was proven wrong when the king did try to escape. Lafayette and the Assembly created a lie that the king had been kidnapped. Ultimately the king and his family were brought back, and the assembly decided that he needed to be a part of the government if he agreed to consent to the constitution. At the time of the massacre, divisions within the Third Estate had already begun to grow. Many workers were angered by the closing of various workshops, which took away jobs, leaving some unemployed. Higher skilled journeymen were also angered due to a lack of increase in wages since the beginning of the Revolution. The attempted flight of the king only increased the tensions between groups. The massacre was the direct result of various factions reacting to the decree by the Constituent Assembly in different ways. The Cordeliers Club, a populist group, chose to create a petition for a protest. This was initially backed by the Jacobins, though support was withdrawn at Robespierre's suggestion. The Cordeliers proceeded by creating a more radical petition calling for a republic and planning a protest that would help gain more signatures. Based on records of the petition and of the dead bodies, the crowd was made up of individuals from the poorer sections of Paris, some of whom may not have been able to read. The organisers seemed to desire representation of Paris as a whole, rather than any specific section.  Results  After the massacre, the republican movement seemed to be over. Two hundred of the activists involved with the movement were arrested after the massacre, while others had to go into hiding. Organisations stopped meeting and radical newspapers no longer published. However, they were not deterred for long. Lafayette, the commander of the National Guard, was previously long revered as the hero of the American Revolutionary War. Many French looked up to Lafayette with hope, expecting him also to lead the French Revolution in the right direction. One year before, on the very same Champ de Mars, he played a prominent ceremonial role during the first F√™te de la F√©d√©ration (14 July 1790), in memory of the 1789 Storming of the Bastille. However, Lafayette's reputation among the French never recovered from this bloody episode. The people no longer looked towards him as an ally or supported him after he and his men fired deadly shots into the crowd. His influence in Paris diminished accordingly. He would still command French armies from April to August 1792, but then fled to the Austrian Netherlands where he was taken prisoner. In 1793, Bailly, the former mayor of Paris, was executed, with one of the charges against him being the instigation of the massacre. Contemporary news report The following is an excerpt of a news report about the incident printed in the Les R√©volutions de Paris, a republican newspaper in support of the anti-royalists who had assembled on the Champ de Mars: :Blood has just flowed on the field of the federation, staining the altar of the fatherland. Men and women have had their throats slashed and the citizens are at a loss. What shall become of liberty? Some say that it has been destroyed, and that the counter revolution has won. Others are certain that liberty has been avenged, and that the Revolution has been unshakably consolidated. Let us impartially examine these two such strangely differing views. ... :The majority of the National Assembly, the department, the Paris municipality, and many of the writers say that the capital is overrun by brigands, that these brigands are paid by agents of foreign courts, and that they are in alliance with the factions that secretly conspire against France. They say that at ten o'clock on Sunday morning, two citizens were sacrificed to their fury. They say these citizens insulted, molested and provoked the National Guard, assassinated several of the citizen soldiers; that they went so far as to try to kill the Commandant-General. And finally they say that they gathered at the Champ de Mars for the sole purpose of disturbing public peace and order, getting so carried away that perhaps it was hard to restrain themselves two hours later. From this point of view, it is certain that the Paris municipality could have and should have taken the severe measures that it did. It is better to sacrifice some thirty wretched vagabonds than to risk the safety of twenty-five million citizens. :However, if the victims of Champ de Mars were not brigands, if these victims were peaceful citizens with their wives and children, and if that terrible scene is but the result of a formidable coalition against the progress of the Revolution, then liberty is truly in danger, and the declaration of martial law is a horrible crime, and the sure precursor of counterrevolution. ... :The field of the federation . . . is a vast plain, at the center of which the altar of the fatherland is located, and where the slopes surrounding the plain are cut at intervals to facilitate entry and exit. One section of the troops entered at the far side of the military school, another came through the entrance somewhat lower down, and a third by the gate that opens on to the Grande Rue de Chaillot, where the red flagThe red flag was a widely understood signal that martial law had been declared and that normal civil policing was suspended. Under martial law, the National Guard was permitted to discharge their weapons when ordered. was placed. The people at the altar, more than fifteen thousand strong, had hardly noticed the flag when shots were heard. \\"Do not move, they are firing blanks. They must come here to post the law.\\" The troops advanced a second time. The composure of the faces of those who surrounded the altar did not change. But when a third volley mowed many of them down, the crowd fled, leaving only a group of a hundred people at the altar itself. Alas, they paid dearly for their courage and blind trust in the law. Men, women, even a child, were massacred there, massacred on the altar of the fatherland.Les R√©volutions de Paris, no. 106, (16‚Äì23 July 1791), 53‚Äì55, 63, 65‚Äì66. Text of the petition The following is the text of the manifesto which was being read and signed by French citizens in the Champ de Mars on the day of the massacre, 17 July 1791: :THE undersigned Frenchmen, members of the sovereign people, considering that, in questions concerning the safety of the people, it is their right to express their will in order to enlighten and guide their deputies, :THAT no question has ever arisen more important than the King's desertion,The previous month, on 20 and 21 June 1791, the king and his family had, with the connivance of others (some of them foreign), escaped from Paris in an attempt to reach the fortress of Montm√©dy in the northeast. There, they expected to find an enclave of royalists in sufficient numbers to ensure their safety and, perhaps, to mount a counter-revolution. They were, however, promptly apprehended at a place called Varennes in the Argonne and returned to Paris. :THAT the decree of 15 July contains no decision concerning Louis XVI, :THAT, in obeying this decree, it is necessary to decide promptly the future of this individual, :THAT his conduct must form the basis of this decision, :THAT Louis XVI, having accepted Royal functions, and sworn to defend the Constitution, has deserted the post entrusted to him; has protested against that very Constitution in a declaration written and signed in his own hand; has attempted, by his flight and his orders, to paralyze the executive power, and to upset the Constitution in complicity with men who are today awaiting trial for such an attempt, :THAT his perjury, his desertion, his protest, not to speak of all the other criminal acts which have proceeded, accompanied, and followed them, involve a formal abdication of the constitutional Crown entrusted to him, :THAT the National Assembly has so judged in assuming the executive power, suspending the Royal authority and holding him in a state of arrest, :THAT fresh promises from Louis XVI to observe the Constitution cannot offer the Nation a sufficient guarantee against a fresh perjury and a new conspiracy. :CONSIDERING finally that it would be as contrary to the majesty of the outraged Nation as it would be contrary to its interest to confide the reins of empire to a perjurer, a traitor, and a fugitive, [we] formally and specifically demand that the Assembly receive the abdication made on 21 June by Louis XVI of the crown which had been delegated to him, and provide for his successor in the constitutional manner, [and we] declare that the undersigned will never recognise Louis XVI as their King unless the majority of the Nation express a desire contrary to the present petition.

When Microsoft eventually lost interest in OS/2 as well, it based its further high-end strategy on Windows NT. Video games *Half-Life 2: Episode Three - The trilogy of episodes following Half-Life 2 was intended to be concluded by the end of 2007. Although the first two episodes were released in a relatively timely fashion, the final installment never surfaced. Despite sporadic assurances from developer Valve that the sequel is in development, there has been no information about the game or when it may see a release, and many rumors regarding it state that it won't be an episodic sequel but rather a full-on sequel. there has been no official announcement - the game is currently the most infamous case of gaming vaporware. Despite continued fan demands for information on development, Gabe Newell, Valve's director, has not commented on the game. *Commander Keen: The Universe Is Toast! was intended to be a continuation of the Commander Keen series, with the story picking up after the events at the end of the sixth episode, but it never progressed beyond the early stages of development, due to id Software moving on to Wolfenstein 3D and then Doom. However, Tom Hall, the series' creator, has stated that he can continue it if he ever regains its intellectual property. *Star Fox (arcade) was originally announced alongside Star Fox: Assault as an arcade counterpart. However, while Assault was released in 2005, Arcade was never mentioned again in public beyond its initial announcement. *Stars! Supernova Genesis was feature complete in August 2000, but the developers were unable to find a publisher. *The Grinder, a first-person shooter that was to be released on the Wii and ported to Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in the fall of 2011, was announced by High Voltage Software around the time it released The Conduit and Conduit 2, two graphically advanced first-person shooters for the Wii. However, The Grinder failed to meet this scheduled due date, and High Voltage Software has remained relatively silent about what had happened to it.http://games.ign.com/articles/995/995409p2.html#9 Years later, it was discovered that the game had been quietly abandoned, though not officially cancelled, after the developers had trouble trying to make the game appealing enough as a new intellectual property. *Six Days in Fallujah, a tactical shooter and video game adaptation of the Second Battle of Fallujah in November 2004, was developed by Atomic Games and was ready to be released around 2010. However, the game's intended publisher, Konami, refused to release the game due to the controversy surrounding it. Since then, no publisher has come forward to pick up the game, and aside from multiple assurances from Atomic Games' president that the game was not canceled, no significant word was heard about whether or when Fallujah would ever be released at all. *Ghostwire: Link to the Paranormal, an augmented reality horror video game, was being developed by A Different Game and was due to be released in late 2010 by Majesco for the Nintendo DSi and intended to leverage its camera system. However, Majesco inexplicably backed out from the game, which was then put on indefinite hold. No further information has been given about the game's fate. *Beyond Good and Evil 2 - announced for the first time in 2008 as prequel to the 2003 released, critically acclaimed, yet commercially unsuccessful game Beyond Good and Evil. Rumors of the release actually happening were fed by a few trailers and concept art as well as statements made by Michel Ancel and Ubisoft. In 2016 the magazine Wired presented the game with their vaporware award. *Star Citizen - initially announced and funded via Kickstarter in 2012, neither the game nor its spinoff Squadron 42 have been released It is the largest crowdfunded project to date, having raised almost $300 million in backer money. Surfaced vaporware Products which once were considered to be vaporware which eventually surfaced after a prolonged time: * 3G * Bluetooth * IBM Watson, a health care system preceded by 2 years of marketing videos * Windows Vista (then, \\"Windows Code Name 'Longhorn'\\") * Mac OS X, the long- awaited \\"next generation Mac OS\\" that finally shipped replacing the announced and later abandoned Copland, Gershwin and Taligent operating system attempts.Vaporware: Why Apple Doesn't Blog. Roughlydrafted.com (December 7, 2006). * GNU Hurd, After more than 20 years, it's still considered \\"not ready\\" by developers. * Lockitron was a device to allow a door deadbolt to be remotely controlled via Bluetooth or over the Internet. After a successful crowdfunding effort that raised over $1.5 million worth of pre-orders, Apigy experienced significant delays delivering a product in substantial numbers. Apigy eventually delivered thousands of the devices before ceasing production and introducing a new model of Lockitron. Video games * Duke Nukem Forever \\\\- Initial game development was announced in April 1997 with a scheduled launch of 1998, with a trailer of the game shown at E3 1998. It was delayed however, and another promotional trailer was released with new graphics with a release date set for November 2001. However, more delays forced the game to be pushed back to unknown date. The game was not heard of again until it was officially announced in late 2010, and was finally released on June 10, 2011, 15 years after initial development. However, the game was met with mixed to negative reviews and was regarded as a failure. See also Development of Duke Nukem Forever. * Daikatana - Daikatana was first announced at E3 1997, and it was shown with promotional images and software, and was planned to be released on that year, with the game already being finished. However, the controversial tagline of the game: \\"John Romero's about to make you his bitch!\\", generated a lot of controversy, and John Romero's incredulous behavior and lavish lifestyle caused much of the original Ion Storm's team to jump ship and form Gathering of Developers. Further unrest was when the game was delayed again to switch from the original Quake engine to Quake II engine in November 1997, and the game was rescheduled for release in March 1998. However, it took over a year for the game to be fully switched in a new engine, and the release date was pushed back to February 1999, a deadline that was missed again. A demo was released in March 1999, which was considered to be of poor quality. The game was again shown at E3 1999, but the now outdated Quake II engine and the inability to show more than 12 frames a second (at a time when 30 frames were industry standard) caused a disaster for Ion Storm development team. Eidos, Ion Storm's parent company, which already invested $44 million in the development of Daikatana, had enough and took majority ownership of the company. The game was finally released in 2000. Today, it is considered to be one of the worst games of the 2000s in general, and one of the worst cases of vaporware due to the hype generated by Romero. * S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl ‚Äì Originally announced in 2001, the game experienced numerous delays.Top 10 Tuesday: Modern Vaporware. Pc.ign.com (April 11, 2006). Beta builds of the final product have been distributed to numerous game review sites.First impressions ‚Äì S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl. Eurogamer On March 3, 2007, THQ announced that the game had gone gold and was released on March 20, 2007, though it was leaked three days earlier. * Team Fortress 2 was announced in 1999 and took 8 years to be released. With a complete change in gameplay and art direction, the North American release took place on October 9, 2007. * Black Mesa was announced as a full remake of Half-Life in 2004. The first release date given by the developers was 2009, but development continued until 2012, when the first fourteen chapters were released on modding website Mod DB. It was greenlit for distribution on Steam on September 11 of the same year, before being released as an early access product on May 5, 2015, with numerous features from the mod improved upon in the Steam release, and with the blessing of Valve, owners of the Half-Life franchise, to sell the product; something quite unique among fan-made remakes. The final chapters of the game were released in 2019, meaning that the project only fully exited its vaporware state a full 15 years after its initial announcement. This remake was designed so as to become a better alternative for Half-Life: Source since it lacked new features other than the fact that it used the newer, revamped Source Engine. Due to its long development time (eleven years), the modification became notable for its delays, and dwindling updates on the status of its completion. The delays led to Wired awarding Black Mesa high spots on their \\"Vaporware Of The Year\\" lists in 2009 and 2010. * Rodea the Sky Soldier was planned to be released on the Wii and Nintendo 3DS, with the Wii version ready to be released in 2011. However, the game remained unreleased for a few years with no significant word on its official status. Finally, in 2014, Kadokawa Games, a candidate publisher for the game, confirmed that NIS America will release the game the following year, although it would only be available on Nintendo's eighth- generation systems, the Wii U and the 3DS, as the Wii was partially discontinued and already falling into disuse around that time. Consequently, the original Wii version would not be available for individual purchase and was instead included with early shipments of the Wii U version. The game was released in Japan on April 2, 2015, then became available to the rest of the world on November 10. * Bethesda Softworks' reboot of Doom originally began development as a sequel to Doom 3 in May 2008, but was completely restarted in 2011 and later considered vaporware. It was finally showcased at E3 2015 as a reboot, and was released on May 13, 2016. * The Last Guardian began development in 2007, and was formally announced at E3 2009. Very little information was released after this until it was reintroduced at E3 2015; it was then released on December 6, 2016. * Final Fantasy XV was first announced in May 2006 as Final Fantasy Versus XIII and was originally part of the Fabula Nova Crystallis Final Fantasy series. There was little word on the game from Square Enix, however, until E3 2013, when it was revealed it had been rebranded as the next main installment in the Final Fantasy series. The game was released worldwide on November 29, 2016. * Mother 3 * Grimoire: Heralds of the Winged Exemplar was a game developed by Cleve Blakemore, a former Wizardry 7 developer, starting in the early 1990s. Blakemore announced release dates that did not transpire for the game at least 4 times, the first being in 1997. A 2010 Indiegogo campaign asked for $250,000 for development, claiming a release date of May 2013, but only raised $10,598. This was followed by a Steam page launch, including a purported July 7, 2017 release, which failed to happen. The game was instead released on August 5, 2017, after over 20 years of development. * Shaq Fu: A Legend Reborn, a new-and-improved sequel to the infamous 1994 game Shaq Fu, was announced in 2014, the game's 20th anniversary, and was intended to be released on the PC, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Wii U, Xbox 360 and Xbox One. The game was crowdfunded on Indiegogo, with backers raising over $450,000 to have the game produced by Saber Interactive.Indiegogo - Shaq-Fu: A Legend Reborn Aside from an announcement that development was nearly completed in late 2016, there was no further word about the game's developmental status or release timetable for roughly four years since its announcement and funding. In 2018, the developers confirmed that they had been busy revising A Legend Reborn to resolve unexpected licensing issues and plan to release it in the coming months, but only on the PS4, Xbox One, PC and the new Nintendo Switch, due to the last- generation systems becoming obsolete at this time. Eventually, they confirmed that the game will finally be released on June 5, 2018.

Centuries earlier, it had been a Native American camp site, and the birthplace of powerful chief Powhatan (d.1618). On the night of April 3, 1865, as Richmond burned due to fires set by evacuating Confederate forces, Richmond mayor Joseph C. Mayo traveled in a horse-drawn buggy along Main Street (which becomes the Osborne Turnpike) alongside the James River about a mile past Rockett's Landing, where he came upon Union cavalry encamped at Tree Hill (near the intersection with New Market Road toward Williamsburg). He delivered a note surrendering the city and requesting help restoring order and protecting people and property.http://www.henricomonthly.com/news/a-tree-falls History Tree Hill Farm has been occupied for more than two centuries, during the colonial era by the Chickahominy tribe of Native Americans. In 1778, Henrico County clerk (and future delegate in the Virginia General Assembly) Miles Selden of the Selden family purchased the property and by 1785 constructed a horse racing track, one of the first such in America. During his 1824 farewell tour of the former colonies he helped liberate, the Marquis de Lafayette visited the racecourse. His daughter Patsy and her husband William Roane inherited Tree Hill plantation in 1837. In 1855, Franklin Stearns bought the plantation from the Roanes. Although a Unionist (and imprisoned as well as placed in house arrest various times during the American Civil War), Stearns allowed cattle belonging to the Confederate's Chimborazo Hospital to graze on the property,Southern Historical Society papers, p. 90 available at https://archive.org/stream/southernhistoric3619sout/southernhistoric3619sout_djvu.txt for which the Confederate government paid him.

Mayo surrendered the city of Richmond to Union forces on the night of April 2‚Äì3, 1865 by giving two Union majors a note telling the Union commander that the Confederates had evacuated and begging him to preserve order, as well as protect Women, children and property. The Union officers conveyed the document to General Godfrey Weitzel, who ordered troops to extinguish the flames, as well as traveled downtown to city hall to accept a formal document at 8:15 a.m. The Burlee family bought the farm from Stearns' children in 1910, and successive generations kept it as a farm until recently.

The Fourth World (also known as Hell) is the inner level where Demons live. People who serve this world are referred to as Puppets. The Sixth World is the outer level where Gods live. 90% of people worship these Gods, living by their morals and rules. The Fifth World is the space in between those worlds where common people live. It is divided into the lower level, which encircles the Fourth World, and the upper level, which is encircled by the Sixth World.

It was used as a school until 1978, and was then converted to senior housing. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on August 2, 1990. Description and history The former Byram School is located in westernmost Greenwich, set on a knoll near the Byram River. The property is bounded on the northwest by United States Route 1, from which it is not visible, by town-owned family housing to its north, and by town athletic facilities to the south, from which it is separated by a stand of mature trees where a war memorial is located. It is a large brick building with load-bearing masonry walls built out of brick with limestone trim. Colonial Revival features include brick corner quoining, a cornice studded with modillion blocks, and a fully pedimented gable above the main building entrance, in which there is a round window topped by a garland. The entrance is flanked by engaged Corinthian columns and topped by an elaborate scrolled pediment. The school was designed by Errol Coffin, a local architect, and was completed in 1926, replacing an older wood-frame structure located across US 1 from this site.

In the 1960s, much of its interior decorative material was removed as part of renovations to modernize the building for code. It served as an elementary school until 1978, and was converted to senior housing in 1987-89. and See also *National Register of Historic Places listings in Greenwich, Connecticut References Category:School buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Connecticut Category:National Register of Historic Places in Fairfield County, Connecticut Category:Colonial Revival architecture in Connecticut Category:School buildings completed in 1925 Category:Buildings and structures in Greenwich, Connecticut ","title":"Byram School"},{"id":"27288545","text":"The Five Pound Man is a 1937 British comedy crime film directed by Albert Parker and starring Judy Gunn, Edwin Styles, Frank Allenby and Charles Bannister.BFI.org Cast * Judy Gunn - Margaret Fenton * Edwin Styles - Richard Fordyce * Frank Allenby - Claud Fenton * Charles Bannister - Eustace Grant * Esma Cannon - Lucy * G.H.

It is best known for its role in Gabriel's Revolution. The main farmhouse was built in the late eighteenth century and is a well preserved example of small Virginia plantations of the time. It was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. The estate is now owned and operated by Henrico County as the Meadow Farm Museum. History Starting in the early eighteenth century, Meadow Farm was owned by several generations of the Sheppard family. The Sheppard family raised livestock and grew crops such as tobacco, wheat, and corn. In 1800, two slaves named Tom and Pharaoh informed then owner Mosby Sheppard about a planned slave revolt in August of that year. Mosby Sheppard informed then governor James Monroe, who halted the rebellion before it could begin. Mosby Sheppard later served in the Virginia Militia for the War of 1812. Doctor John Mosby Sheppard, son of Mosby Sheppard, later inherited the estate. John Sheppard, who's life and time period is depicted at the now museum, practiced medicine on the site and his medical office still stands today. John Sheppard's grandson, General Sheppard Crump, was last of the Sheppard family to live at Meadow Farm. After Sheppard Crump passed away, his widow lived in the house until eventually donating the property to Henrico County. Architecture The main dwelling at Meadow Farm is a story-and-a- half frame house. The house is a well preserved farm house of its time and important interior details survive such as the stairs and banisters, mantels, baseboards, and floors. The house has a gabled roof with exterior end chimneys. There is Greek Revival porch on the house which dates to the 1840s. Later additions were made to the house, such as a shed wing and a large two story wing on the rear. Meadow Farm Museum A cow at Meadow Farm Museum, 2020 The 1860 period living history farmsite and museum presents programs and exhibits on the culture of the rural South.

In the U.S. state of Kansas, US-183 is a main north-south highway that runs from the Oklahoma border north to the Nebraska border. Between 1930 and 1931, US-183 was extended south into Kansas to US-83 in Dresden. Then between July 1938 and 1939, US-183 was altered to follow US-36 east to K-1 in Phillipsburg, then south along K-1 to US-160. Then continued west along US-160 to K-34 in Sitka, which it followed south from Sitka to the Oklahoma border. Between 1941 and 1944, US-183 and US-83 were swapped within Nebraska and a small portion into Kansas, which straightened their alignment and eliminated the overlap between the two in Norton. The former alignment of US-83 from northeast of Selden to east of Woodruff became US-383, now K-383. Route description US-183 northbound from K-156 US-183 enters Kansas in Clark County and turns east at Sitka, where it begins a multiplex with US-160, entering Comanche County, where it passes through Protection. The highways stay paired as it turns north to pass through the Comanche County seat, Coldwater. At Coldwater, US-160 turns back to the east, and US-183 continues its northerly track. US-183 running concurrently with US-160 in southern Comanche County. US-183 at north end of overlap with US-56 northeast of Kinsley Entering Kiowa County, US-183 reaches a junction with the multiplexed east-west route, US-54 and US-400, where it passes through Greensburg. In southern Edwards County, the highway makes a brief turn to the west before meeting up with US-56 in Kinsley, the Edwards County seat. US-56 and US-183 turn northeast before the highways split after entering Pawnee County. US-56 continues northeast toward Larned, and US-183 straightens out to pass through largely unpopulated areas in Edwards County. In Rush County, US-183 intersects two primary east-west Kansas state highways, K-96 in Rush Center and K-4 in LaCrosse. US-183 reaches the largest city along its route in Kansas, Hays, where a western bypass of the highway provides direct access to Gross Memorial Coliseum and Fort Hays State University. US-183 is known as Vine Street in Hays and contains numerous businesses. US-183 runs through town for three miles (5 km) before crossing Interstate 70, which is heavily traveled in Hays with traffic between Denver and Kansas City. The interchange of US-183 and I-70 has been designated as the CW2 Bryan J. Nichols Fallen Veterans Memorial Interchange. North of Hays, the highway has been resurfaced and realigned for to Plainville, one of two towns in Rooks County US-183 serves. At Plainville, US-183 has a junction with K-18. US-183 continues north to Stockton, the Rooks County seat, where US-24 crosses. The highway enters Phillips County approximately north of Stockton. US-183 meets US-36 west, and the highways join for a multiplex through the city of Phillipsburg. The highways split in downtown Phillipsburg, and US-183 has one last junction with K-383 before exiting the state south of Alma, Nebraska.

In South Carolina, the highway runs north to south from the Georgia state line near Clarks Hill to the North Carolina state line near Chesnee. While in the state, the highway passes through Greenwood, Laurens, Woodruff, and Spartanburg. The highway mostly travels through rural parts of the Piedmont region of the state. Route description US Route 221 enters McCormick County from Georgia from the top of the J. Strom Thurmond Dam at the southeastern edge of Lake Strom Thurmond. The first site in the state is the Thurmond Lake Overlook. Almost instantly curves to the north but then to the east before seeming to terminate at South Carolina State Highway 28 in Clarks Hill, South Carolina (which is part of the Savannah River Scenic BywaySavannah River National Scenic Byway (South Carolina Scenic Byways)), but in reality turns left and joins the road in a concurrency. US 221/SC 28 runs north and northwesterly often being flanked by a railroad line along the east side as it passes through Modoc where it encounters the Hamilton Branch State Park and Recreation Area, and later Parksville which contains the Parksville State Recreation Area. The road widens to four lanes as it enters Plum Branch and after a road to the Plum Branch Yacht Club, has a blinker light intersection with the western terminus of South Carolina Highway 283 and a local road named Collier Street. Shifting a bit further away from the coast it eventually enters the town of McCormick. From McCormick, it leaves SC 28, and briefly joins a concurrency with U.S. Route 378 until that route breaks away at East Gold Street. From there it continues northeasterly into the woods. After crossing the McCormick-Greenwood County Line, US 221 joins a concurrency with South Carolina Highway 10 south of Bradley. Along the way, US 221/SC 10 runs along the south side of the same railroad line it flanked the west side of since the SC 28 concurrency. After the intersection with Callison Road, and later two other local streets, SC 10 branches off to the northwest towards Verdery, and US 221 leaves the Sumter National Forest. Twelve miles later, it runs into the city of Greenwood. Along the way it is joined by another concurrency with U.S. Routes 25/178, and runs south and east along the edge of the city, then turns east onto South Carolina Highway 72. From Greenwood, U.S. Route 221 continues northeasterly to the city of Coronaca and after crossing a bridge over the Saluda River the concurrency with SC 72 comes to an end. From there US 221 turns north and runs through Waterloo. U.S. Truck Route 221 bypasses the city of Laurens on the east side. After the truck route ends, it continues northeast and then northwest before the interchange with Interstate 385 in rural Laurens County. Returning more toward the northeast, it reaches Enoree and curves to the northwest until reaching Woodruff and curves back to the east-northeast proceeding to intersect Interstate 26 in rural Spartanburg County. Almost immediately after I-26, U.S. Route 221 turns north and continues through the center of the city of Spartanburg serving as the terminus of Interstate 585 before intersecting Interstate 85 just north of the city. Shortly after I-85 it crosses a bridge over the Pacolet River. It continues to the city of Chesnee before exiting the state in a rural area of Cherokee County. The southern terminus of US 221 Alt. intersects the main route in the city of Chesnee and exits the state a few miles to the east of the main route. History Established in 1932, US 221 was connected from North Carolina, from north of Cowpens National Battlefield to Greenwood, connecting the cities of Spartanburg, Woodruff, Laurens, and Waterloo. In 1941, US 221 replaced South Carolina Highway 110 (SC 110), going due north from Chesnee to the North Carolina state line; its former route became US 221 Alternate. In 1954, US 221 was extended south to Bradley and McCormick, then south over the Clarks Hill Dam into Georgia; this replaced part of SC 10 and part of SC 670\\\\. Between 1962 and 1964, US 221 bypassed Roebuck. Between 1968 and 1970, US 221 was rerouted onto the Greenwood Bypass and its current routing south of US 25/US 178, replacing the remaining part of SC 670\\\\. The old route through Greenwood became SC 72 Business and an extension of SC 10. Junction listSpecial routes There is one truck route and one alternate route in South Carolina.

In his book published in 1937, Hall Gleason comments on the appearance of Thatcher Magoun as follows: \\"Her figurehead was a life-like image of the father of ship building on the Mystic.\\" Voyages According to Hall Gleason, Thatcher Magoun made five passages from Boston to San Francisco. For this route, the clipper's fastest journey was completed in 113 days, and its slowest in 152 days. Moreover, in 1869, Thatcher Magoun made seven passages from New York to San Francisco, averaging 96 days per voyage. On one of its voyages from New York to San Francisco, Thatcher Magoun carried locomotives CP 88, 89, and 95 for the Central Pacific Railroad company. This voyage began July 10, 1868, and lasted 117 days. Namesake Thatcher Magoun established the first shipyard in Medford, MA on what is known today as Riverside Avenue, opposite the end of Park Street. In 1803, Magoun laid the keel of his first vessel, the Mt. Aetna, the model of which he had made a few years before. He continued building ships at this location until 1836; eventually his yard was to be the only one in Medford with a ship house. Magoun amassed significant wealth by building 84 vessels over the course of his career. He specialized in big ships and brigs, which are 250 tons and larger in size, built for Old China Trade. According to the maritime historian Admiral Samuel Eliot Morison, Magoun's reputation was \\"second to none among American shipbuilders.\\" ReferencesExternal links * *The New Clipper Ship Thatcher Magoun of Boston Category:Individual sailing vessels Category:California clippers Category:Age of Sail merchant ships of the United States Category:Merchant ships of the United States Category:Merchant ships of Norway Category:Ships built in Medford, Massachusetts Category:1855 ships ","title":"Thatcher Magoun (clipper)"},{"id":"27288746","text":"Cunard is an unincorporated community in Fayette County, West Virginia, United States.

In the state of Kansas, US-281 is a main north-south highway that runs from the Oklahoma border north to the Nebraska border. US-281 passes within to the east of the Geographic center of the contiguous United States, which its connected to via K-191 (Kansas highway) (K-191). Between 1933 and 1936, US-281 was extended south into Kansas to US-36 south of Lebanon. Then between July 1938 and 1940, US-281 was extended south into Oklahoma. Route description US-281 enters the state at Hardtner in Barber County and passes through Medicine Lodge, Pratt, St. John and Great Bend, the only city along the route in Kansas which has more than 7,000 people. Along its venture through southern Kansas, US-281 intersects several major east‚Äìwest routes: first US-54 and US-400, which heads east to Wichita and west to Dodge City, Garden City and Liberal; US-50, which veers east to Hutchinson and west to Garden City; and US-56, heading to Dodge City westbound and Overland Park eastbound. Following a four-mile (6 km) concurrency with K-4 near Hoisington, the highway intersects I-70 at Russell before joining K-18 near Paradise for an concurrency. The two highways split at Luray, and US-281 turns north into Osborne County, passing through the town of Osborne before joining US-24 and K-9 for another concurrency. US-281 joins US-36 at Smith Center, turning east before the two highways split; US-281 turns north for its final stretch in the state, passing through Lebanon. All sections of US-281 in Kansas are two-lane. The last stretches of the highway overlaid with bricks, through downtown Pratt and Hoisington, were recently resurfaced with concrete. History=Early roads and establishment Between 1933 and 1936, US-281 was extended south into Kansas to US-36 south of Lebanon, which replaced the former K-65. In a March 3, 1936 resolution, a 10 mile section of K-8 (modern US-281) was realigned north of Russell. Then between July 1938 and 1940, US-281 was extended south into Oklahoma, which replaced K-8. Realignments In a June 6, 1936 resolution, US-281 was slightly realigned north of Lebanon to eliminate two sharp turns. In a December 5, 1939 resolution, it was realigned from K-18 southward to the new alignment that was approved in the March 3, 1936 resolution, which completely straightened its alignment between Russell and K-18. In a July 10, 1946 resolution, a roughly section was realigned from US-160 southward, near Medicine Lodge, to eliminated several sharp curves. This realignment created a short overlap with US-160. In an August 28, 1946 resolution, US-281 was realigned by Luray to eliminate several sharp curves and turns. In a December 9, 1948 resolution, an approximately section of US-281 was realigned in Great Bend. In a September 27, 1950 resolution, US-281 was realigned in and north of Lebanon to eliminate four sharp curves. In another September 27, 1950 resolution, US-281 was realigned just south of the Nebraska border to eliminate two sharp curves. In a January 11, 1951 resolution, an approximately section of US-281 was realigned northwest of Sawyer, which eliminated a sharp turn and two railroad crossings. In a February 14, 1951 resolution, a roughly section of US-281 was realigned northwest of Kiowa to eliminate eight sharp curves. In a January 28, 1954 resolution, US-50S (modern US-50) was realigned between US-281 and Stafford to eliminate several sharp curves, which created a short overlap with US-281. The overlap lasted a little over a year, then in a September 14, 1955 resolution, US-50S was realigned to continue west from US-281. In Pratt, US-54 originally overlapped US-281 from 5th Street to 1st Street. Then in a January 4, 1956 resolution, US-54 was realigned to cross US-281 and follow 1st Street. In a December 22, 1958 resolution, a section of I-70 was planned along with a diamond interchange to connect to US-281. In another December 22, 1958 resolution, a short section of US-281 was realigned northwest of Portis to eliminate three sharp curves. US-281 originally continued past Iliff Street along US-160 to Main Street where it turned north. It continued north to Stolp Avenue where it turned west and continued to Iliff Street where it turned north. Then in an August 24, 1966 resolution it was realigned to turn north of US-160 at Iliff Street. US-40 Business, which overlaps US-281 in Russell, was originally known as US-40 Alternate until 1981. K-14 originally overlapped US-281 from the Oklahoma border to K-2, then in a December 21, 1994 resolution K-14 was truncated to US-160 in Harper. In a November 15, 2013 resolution, US-40 Business was decommissioned, which eliminated the overlap with US-281. In mid 2019, work began to convert the junction with US-50 to an enhanced roundabout. The roundabout includes outer diamond shape lanes for oversized loads to bypass the roundabout. The former intersection with US-50 was dangerous as only US-281 traffic had to stop and therefore was the location of several injury and fatal accidents. Between 2002 and 2012, there were 21 accidents, resulting in one fatality. On March 4, 2020, traffic was rerouted, from a four-way stop and temporary asphalt detour, onto the permanent concrete outer roads for the roundabout. The roundabout was completed and opened up to traffic on May 22, 2020. Venture Corporation from Great Bend, was the primary contractor for the $5.2 million project. Major intersectionsAlternate route U.S. Route 281 Alternate was a long alternate of U.S. Route 281 running within the northeastern and eastern portions of Great Bend, Kansas. US-281 Alternate was formed in 1955 and was decommissioned about 1983. Since then it has been known as US 281 Bypass, which is mostly unsigned, two-lane surface highway bypasses downtown Great Bend. The only visible indication of this being a bypass is via street signs along intersecting streets; thus it is not a true bypass route, but a local street that is named as a bypass. Route description 281 Bypass begins its journey near the intersection of 10th (US-56/K-96/K-156) and Pine Streets. 10th Street, which is normally east‚Äìwest, travels slightly southwest-northeast for one block with its intersection with the bypass. The bypass travels mostly to the northwest until near Park and Frey Streets. Then, it steers towards the north-northwest. After intersecting with 22nd Street, 281 Bypass starts to curve to the west until it intersects with 24th Street. It remains unsigned on 24th Street until its northwestern terminus with its parent route on Main Street (US-281). The northwestern terminus of U.S. Highway 281 Bypass is directly adjacent to Brit Spaugh Park in Great Bend.

In the U.S. state of Kansas, US-283 is a main north-south highway that runs from the Oklahoma border north to the Nebraska border in the western part of the state. Along the way it intersects many major routes including US-50, US-56 and US-400 in Dodge City, Interstate 70 (I-70) and US-40 in WaKeeney. It also intersects US-36 and K-383 in Norton. In 1927, the highway that would become US-283 was established as K-21 from the Oklahoma border north to the Nebraska border. In 1933, US-283 was extended north from Oklahoma over K-21 to US-50S and US-154 in Dodge City. By 1936, it had been extended further north to K-96 in Ness City, further along K-21. Between 1938 and 1940, US-283 was extended north to US-36, US-83 and US-183 in Norton. Between 1941 and 1945, US-283 was extended north into Nebraska, resulting in K-21 being completely decommissioned. Route description US-283 enters from Oklahoma south of Englewood in Clark County, and passes through largely unpopulated areas of the county until joining up for a brief concurrency with U.S. Route 160. Following the split, US-283 continues north through Minneola before making its way into Dodge City, the only town with a population of more than 3,300 the highway passes through in the Sunflower State. US-283 and US-56 approaching US-50 north of Dodge City At Dodge City, US-283 jogs east. It meets with U.S. Route 400, but the two highways do not stay joined for long; US-400 splits and heads southeast towards Greensburg, while US-283 continues eastbound past the Dodge City Regional Airport. After passing the airport, the route then bends northeast before joining U.S. Route 50 and U.S. Route 56 for a brief stint. US-50 and US-56 split east towards Kinsley, and US-283 resumes a due northerly course through open fields before reaching Jetmore, where K-156 crosses in an east- west direction. K-156 heads to Garden City westbound and Great Bend eastbound. The highway continues on another stretch through sparsely populated farmland before reaching Ness City and K-96, the first of two junctions in Ness County. The other junction in the county is at K-4 near Ransom. The highway reaches Interstate 70 in WaKeeney, and makes a brief jog east through downtown WaKeeney before turning back to the north. US-283 between Ransom and I-70 was closed for much of 2006 as part of a major reconstruction program. The highway continues north to Hill City, where it crosses U.S. Route 24. The route stays on course until it reaches southern Norton County, where it has a brief concurrency with K-9. At the split, K-9 continues west to Lenora, and US-283 resumes a straight northerly direction until the city of Norton, where after crossing U.S. Route 36, it reaches Nebraska later. With the exception of small sections in Dodge City, all portions of US-283 in Kansas are two-laned. History In 1927, the highway that would become US-283 was established as K-21 from the Oklahoma border north to the Nebraska border. In 1933, US-281 was extended north from Oklahoma over K-21 to US-50S and US-154 in Dodge City. By 1936, it had been extended further north to K-96 in Ness City along K-21. Between July 1938 and 1940, US-283 was extended north to US-36, US-83 and US-183 in Norton. In an August 7, 1941 resolution, a section of K-21 was realigned at the Nebraska border to eliminate two sharp curves. Between 1941 and 1944, US-283 was extended north into Nebraska, resulting in K-21 being completely decommissioned. Also between 1941 and 1945, US-83 and US-183 were swapped within Nebraska and a small portion into Kansas, which straightened their alignment and eliminated their overlap in Norton. The former alignment of US-83 from northeast of Selden to east of Woodruff became US-383. Realignments In an August 20, 1935 resolution, US-283 was slightly realigned along its overlap with US-160 to eliminate a few sharp curves. In a February 26, 1958 resolution, a section of I-70 was approved from Collyer east to Ogallah, which included a new diamond interchange to be built at US-283 to serve Wakeeney. K-383 was assigned to the portions of former US-383 in Kansas from US-83 near Selden to a concurrency with US-183 at the Nebraska state line in 1981. In an April 1, 1981 resolution, US-283 Spur was redesignated as US-40 Business in WaKeeney. In another April 1, 1981 resolution, US-156 was redesignated as K-156 in Jetmore. In an August 24, 1981 resolution, US-50 Alternate along the north side of Dodge City became a new alignment of US-50, and the former US-50 that overlapped US-283 and US-56 through Dodge City became US-50 Business. In a December 1, 1994 resolution, US-400 was established in Kansas, which created an overlap with US-283, US-56 and US-50 Business from the south end of the overlap with US-50 Business to the former K-129. In an April 25, 2008 resolution, the overlap with US-50 Business in Dodge City was removed as it was decommissioned. Also the overlap with US-400 was changed to run from the southern end of US-283's overlap with US-56 north to where US-400 originally turned east off US-283 and US-56. Major intersectionsFormer spur U.S. Route 283 Spur (US-283 Spur) was a spur route that existed in WaKeeney. It began at a diamond interchange with I-70 and US-40 exit 128, and traveled north and ended at US-283. US-283 Spur first appears on the 1963-1964 State Highway map. In an April 1, 1981 resolution, US-283 Spur was redesignated as US-40 Business (US-40 Bus.) in WaKeeney.

The two structures were built on an existing textile mill complex in the 1870s. The mill and its depot, in the Gothic Revival and Queen Anne architectural styles respectively, were unusually decorative for functional buildings of that era. Today they are a commercial and retail complex for the Glenville neighborhood of Greenwich. In 1990 they were listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Thirteen years later, when the Glenville Historic District was listed on the Register in 2003, the buildings were a contributing property. Buildings The two structures are located on a lot between Pemberwick Road on the west and the Byram River on the east, where the dam that powered the mills is still present. To the north is the commercial center of Greenwich's Glenville neighborhood, with the large former Glenville School, now the Western Greenwich Civic Center, to the east, behind a housing development. On the west side of the street the land rises sharply through wooded bluffs to a residential neighborhood; another one is on the other side of the river, where the land rises more gently to the state line and Rye Brook, New York, a half- mile (1 km) away. To the south Pemberwick continues through woods along the Byram. The \\"new\\" mill building, the larger of the two, sits on the river. It is a three-story, brick building with a two-story northern wing. Because of a regrading it now appears to be two stories on the east. A central tower rises to a fourth story, its top above the ground. Intricate brickwork and decoration characterizes all the main block's facades. The round-arched windows on both floors have as their springlines belt courses made of three rows of brick laid as two rows of headers with black stretchers in between. This is complemented by a reverse in the arches themselves, where the black bricks are recessed. Pilasters rise between the windows, topped by squares of projecting brick. A dentilled cornice runs just below the roofline. The tower, and all but the east roofline, are crenelated at the top. Additionally machicolation supports the flared top of the tower. Diapered brick spells out \\"1881\\", the year of construction, in one of the entablatures. Smaller towers are located at the corners of the building. A pedestrian plaza separates the mill building from the depot to the east. It is a one-and-a-half-story structure of brick, in less decorative patterns. Its gabled roof has broad overhanging eaves pierced by gabled dormer windows on the west. Both the dormer gables and the braces at the main gable peaks are braced with wood in a lacy foliate pattern, more intricate at the gable peaks than the dormers. The latter have visible rafter ends. History Glenville had grown up around a mill on the Byram since first being settled in the mid-18th century. By 1814 at the latest a textile mill, the Byram Manufacturing Company, had been established at the present site. It went through a variety of owners over the next several decades, none of them able to make it successful in the long term. After an 1874 foreclosure, William Tingue of Paterson, New Jersey, purchased the mill. He formed Tingue, Hous and Company, doing business as Hawthorne Woolen Mill. An insurance survey done in 1875 notes that the buildings were \\"substantial and in good repair\\"; it is not known then why he chose to demolish and replace them within a few years. The depot, probably the first of the two to be built, was to have been served by a railroad, shown as planned on 1867 maps, connecting Port Chester, New York, and Ridgefield, Connecticut. Those plans were eventually abandoned. The construction of the new mill, which replaced a building described by the 1875 insurance survey as similar in size, suggests that Tingue had been able to make the mill very profitable. His success may also have led him to choose such high-style designs for the buildings, to show the importance of the mills to the community and his commitment to them, as owners of such buildings at the time sometimes did. The intricate patterning on the mill facade suggests a great deal of thought went into the composition; the woodwork trim on the depot shows a Stick/Eastlake influence. In 1892 the company changed its name to the Hawthorne Mills Company. Five years later, in 1897, it was recorded as operating with 20 sets of cards and 70 broadlooms. The American Felt Company, a New Jersey-based concern that operated mills in four states, acquired Hawthorne in 1899. Its success continued, with first Irish and later Polish immigrants who lived nearby staffing the mills. In 1939 it had 24 card sets, five pickers and 200 employees total. After World War II it went into decline along with the New England textile industry as a whole. American Felt closed the mill in the 1970s. It has since been converted into a residential and commercial complex. The interiors of the buildings were completely renovated and partitioned, but the exteriors remain relatively intact.

The dinghy was originally designed by Arthur Caldwell in Melbourne Australia during the mid-1970s as a home built plywood sports sailing dinghy that could be sailed on his local waters of Port Philip Bay. Because of the Bay's large size and reliable fresh winds, swells of one metre and more are common and provide a challenging environment for the bay's dinghy sailors. With the help of some of those local dinghy sailors, early Impulses were developed into sailing dinghies well suited to Melbourne's local waters. They were also found to plane very well on calmer waters which made them popular at various sailing locations throughout Australia and over the following three decades the Impulse's design has been further refined so that along with a process of fine tuning the class rules, a stable and forgiving yet fast dinghy has evolved. Today Impulses are sailed and raced in many off-the-beach sailing clubs in all states of Australia. South Australia, Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland hold yearly Impulse state championships and once a year Impulse sailors from around Australia meet in one of these four states to race at the Impulse 4.0 Metre Sports Dinghy nationals. At the 2019/2020 Australian Championship, Michael Brown won his 8th title, in a record fleet of 55 boats. Design The dimensions, performance and yardstick of an Impulse Sports Dinghy are similar to the popular Laser dinghy and you can often see both classes of dinghy involved in close club racing. Although they have their similarities, the Impulse has some significant differences to the Laser including: * A new Impulse can be constructed at home by an amateur boat builder, while a new Laser must only be purchased from one of the sanctioned Laser manufacturers. This means that the initial cost of a new Laser can be more than double the cost of building a new Impulse. * The Impulse's minimum hull weight of 47 kg is lower than the Laser's at 56 kg. * Unlike the Laser, the Impulse has hard chine construction, which gives the Impulse a gently V keeled and flatter wetted surface than the rounded Laser hull. This hull shape gives the Impulse more heeling stability on the water than the Laser making it more stable in rough and windy conditions. * Due to the lower weight and improved stability described in the two previous points, an Impulse is less physically demanding to sail than a Laser and it is more common to see older sailors racing competitively in Impulses than you usually see sailing in Lasers due to the athletic ability needed to sail a Laser well. * The Impulse's triangular sail shape and boom length were originally very similar to the Laser's, but a more modern sail shape was developed and ratified during the 1980s which saw the Impulse's sail given a broader head than a Laser's sail and consequently the Impulse's boom could be shortened. A shorter boom has meant that the Impulse can heal much more than a Laser before the boom touches the water. As well as slowing the boat down, a boom touching the water can lead to a capsize. * Impulses have four full length battens in their sails as opposed to the Laser's three partial battens and the stiffness of the Impulse's battens can be varied to suit the sailor's weight and the prevailing conditions. * Because the Impulse class rules allow for variations in the rotating mast's bracing and rigging including variations in the rigging attachment points at both the mast and the hull, this allows the Impulse sailor the option of tailoring the rig to better suit their weight and common sailing conditions. Lasers have no mast stays nor any external mast bracing. * The Impulse class rules allow the sailor to individualise the way they run the main sheet between the boom and deck, while Lasers have a fixed main sheet route which can't be varied. * There are several sail trim adjustments that can be built into the Impulse's rigging and hull giving an Impulse sailor more options trim the sail on the water than those available to Laser sailors. Construction A competitive Impulse Dinghy's hull can be built at home with commonly available tools by an amateur boat builder or it can be purchased ready to sail from a professional boat builder. The most common home building techniques are either: * Using the stitch and glue method of hull construction with boat building materials such as marine grade plywood, selected timber, fibreglass and epoxy. * Making a fibreglass hull from a private or Impulse association mould and adding plywood and/or fibreglass bulkheads and deck. * Purchasing a fibreglass hull at various stages of completion from a professional boat builder and finishing the boat at home. Many Impulse sailors also assemble their own masts and rigging to suit their individual needs using components provided through their state Impulse association and commercial chandlers. It is a testament to the hull's design and construction techniques that Impulse dinghies built in the late 1970s and 1980s are still sailing competitively today, more than three decades after they were constructed. The future Impulse dinghies have experienced a slow but steady growth in popularity since they were first seen on Australian waters in the 1970s. As new building materials and methods have become available as well as new professional boat builders producing competitive Impulses during the mid to late 2000s, Impulse fleet numbers have been steadily increasing in every state and national event over recent years. In 2011 the smaller (D2) sail has started to appear in Impulse fleets and this smaller sail should encourage younger and lighter sailors into the Impulse, especially when sailing under more challenging conditions. Once ratified at a national level, the 6.6 sail is expected to help in the expansion of Impulse fleets. Use of this smaller sail has been ratified but uptake has been slow. Perhaps the increasing number of older sailors in the class, which has accompanied increasing class numbers overall, will eventually lead to increased adoption of the smaller sail.
