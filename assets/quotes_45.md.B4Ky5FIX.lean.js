Without the benefit of a formal education in the arts, he was the youngest exhibitor at The Exhibition of the Royal Academy of Arts. Background Vernon March, son of George Henry March and his wife Elizabeth Blenkin, was born in 1891 in Kingston upon Hull, in the East Riding of Yorkshire, England. His father was a seed crusher foreman (oil miller) in Yorkshire. By 1901, the March family had moved to Battersea, London, England, where his father worked as a builder's clerk. Vernon was the youngest of nine children, eight of whom had careers as artists. Three of the March siblings became sculptors, Sydney, Elsie, and Vernon. The other five siblings who chose a career in the arts were Edward, Percival, Frederick, Dudley, and Walter. Vernon's ninth sibling was his sister Eva Blenkin March. Their parents George and Elizabeth both died in 1904. At the time of the 1911 census, all nine of the March siblings, as yet unmarried, were living together in their 17-roomed home called \\"Goddendene\\" in Locksbottom, Farnborough, Kent, England. Two of the siblings eventually married, Eva and Frederick, and produced a total of three children between them. Vernon's sister Eva married Charles Francis Newman in 1916. They had one child, a daughter, Heather. His brother Frederick married a native of Scotland, Agnes Annie Gow, in 1926. They had two children, Elizabeth and Cecil. Vernon served with the Royal Flying Corps after enlisting on 8 March 1916. He was discharged less than one year later, on 24 January 1917, with a rank of Air Mechanic 2nd Class. Career Diamond War Memorial in Derry, Northern Ireland Christian missionary portion of the Samuel de Champlain Monument The March family established studios at the family home of Goddendene in Locksbottom, Farnborough. In 1911, Vernon exhibited two of his works at The Royal Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts Annual Exhibition. Between 1907 and 1927, he exhibited seven times at The Exhibition of the Royal Academy of Arts, with a total of twelve works. Vernon had the distinction of being the youngest exhibitor at the Royal Academy of Arts, as he was just sixteen when his sculpture of Psyche was exhibited and purchased on the third day of the event in 1907. Years later, the prodigy was awarded the commission for a war memorial in Cape Town, to honour the fallen of World War I. The Cenotaph memorial has a sandstone base and columns, with bronze plaques and figures. It features winged Victory holding a laurel wreath, and standing on top of a globe, a serpent of evil under her feet. The winged figure on the tall central column is flanked by two South African soldiers on shorter columns. The Cenotaph is located on Heerengracht Street. It now commemorates not only the fallen soldiers of World War I, but also World War II and the Korean War. It is the site of the annual Armistice Day wreath-laying ceremony and procession. The Cenotaph was originally unveiled in Adderley Street on 3 August 1924. Street widening in 1959 required that the memorial be moved and reoriented. At that time, additional plaques commemorating the soldiers of World War II and the Korean War were added. The Cenotaph was then unveiled for the second time on 8 November 1959. The Cenotaph was relocated again in 2013, from Adderley Street to Heerengracht Street, to make way for a new MyCiTi bus station. While the Samuel de Champlain Monument in Orillia, Ontario was installed in 1925, a year after the Cape Town memorial, the process began years earlier. Charles Harold Hale was known as \\"Mr. Orillia\\" due to his myriad accomplishments on behalf of the city. The idea of a monument to Champlain in the city of Orillia was his brainchild. Hale championed the cause and obtained funding for the project. The competition in 1912 for the design garnered twenty-two entries from three countries, Canada, England, and France. The winning entry was submitted by twenty-year-old Vernon March. The initial target date for completion of the monument was August 1915, to honour the 300th anniversary of Champlain's visit to Huronia. However, World War I delayed the project. The Champlain monument was finally unveiled on 1 July 1925 in Couchiching Park in Orillia, Ontario. On a central pedestal stands a twelve foot tall bronze Champlain in full court attire. Below him on one side there is a robed priest holding a cross above Canadian natives. This side symbolises Christianity. On the side symbolising Commerce, there is a fur trader examining a pelt with two additional natives. A war memorial dedicated to the citizens of Derry, Northern Ireland who lost their lives in World War I was first considered by public leaders in 1919. After several years of efforts at obtaining the necessary funding, the design and location of the monument were approved by the local war memorial committee in April 1925. Vernon March won the commission to build the memorial that he and his brother Sydney March had designed. The Diamond War Memorial is of bronze and Portland stone. In the center, a winged Victory holds aloft a laurel wreath. The tall column on which she stands has the names of the fallen on four sides. At the base of the monument there are two bronze figures on shorter columns, a soldier on one side who represents the Army and a sailor on the other who represents the Navy. The cenotaph is located on The Diamond in the center of the walled city of Derry. It was unveiled on 23 June 1927. National War Memorial of Canada National War Memorial of Canada In 1925, Vernon participated in an open, world-wide competition to design and build the National War Memorial of Canada. He was one of seven finalists out of a total of 127 entrants. The seven finalists then submitted scale models of their designs. Vernon was awarded the commission in January 1926 with his entry of \\"The Great Response of Canada.\\" His design included Liberty holding a torch and winged Victory a laurel wreath, both bronze figures at the top of a granite arch. Below, a cannon is present at the rear of the monument. In front of the cannon, there are twenty-two bronze soldiers under the arch, representing the branches of the Canadian military forces that existed during the First World War. Work on the monument had not yet been completed when Vernon died of pneumonia in 1930. Six of his siblings completed the bronze statues for the monument. They moulded the figures in clay and cast them in plaster. Then, the bronzes were finished in their foundry at Goddendene. The family completed the work by July 1932. However, construction of the arch in Canada could not commence because the site in Ottawa had not yet been prepared. The bronze memorial groups were mounted on a base instead, and shown at Hyde Park in London. After six months, they were then transferred to the studio in Farnborough where they remained until they were shipped to Canada in 1937. After a contract was won by Montreal contractors E.G.M. Cape and Company in December 1937, the arch and base for the monument were constructed in Ottawa. Sydney March directed the construction with the assistance of his brothers. The monument, including installation of the bronzes, was finished on 19 October 1938, and landscaping of the area surrounding the memorial commenced. Everything was completed in time for the Royal visit the following spring. The National War Memorial of Canada commemorates the Canadian response during World War I. King George VI performed the unveiling of the monument on 21 May 1939 during a ceremony with an audience of an estimated 100,000. Image:Base of National War Memorial.jpgFront Image:National War Memorial 2010.jpgSide Image:Canadian National War Memorial, back side.jpgRear Other collaborative works Lewes War Memorial One of the first monuments on which the March siblings collaborated was the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers South African War Memorial; however, Vernon was still a child when it was built and erected. Another project on which the family collaborated was the Lewes War Memorial at School Hill on High Street in Lewes, East Sussex, England. Vernon was the main sculptor for the monument. There is a central obelisk of Portland stone topped by a globe. A bronze winged Victory stands on top of the globe with her arms raised, a laurel wreath in one hand. Two other bronze angels sit near the base of the monument, one on each side. There are adjacent shields, also of bronze, which list the names of the fallen soldiers of World War I. The Lewes War Memorial was unveiled and dedicated on 6 September 1922. It was rededicated on 1 March 1981, to include the deceased soldiers of World War II. On 29 October 1985, the monument was listed as a Grade II structure on the National Heritage List for England. A Grade II structure is deemed to be nationally important and of special interest. The March family also worked together on the war memorial at Sydenham, London, England. Sydney March was the main sculptor for the monument which is now a tribute to the deceased soldiers of both World War I and II who were employees of the Sydenham South Suburban Gas Works. The memorial in front of Livesey Memorial Hall in the London Borough of Lewisham features a bronze figure of Victory standing atop a globe on a wreathed base, with serpents at her feet. Bronze plaques listed the names of fallen soldiers. The plaques also gave the names of those from the company who served in the wars. The Sydenham War Memorial was unveiled by Lord Robert Cecil on 4 June 1920. Also referred to as the Livesey Hall War Memorial, the monument was listed as a Grade II structure on the National Heritage List for England on 30 August 1996. In October 2011, three of the plaques from the front of the monument were stolen. Death Vernon March died of pneumonia at age 38 on 11 June 1930 in Farnborough, Kent, England. Most of the members of his family, including his parents George and Elizabeth, were interred at Saint Giles the Abbot Churchyard in Farnborough. In 1922, his brother Sydney March had sculpted the bronze angel monument that marked the family grave. Vernon was buried in the family plot on 14 June 1930. His last surviving sibling Elsie March died in 1974. Legacy National War Memorial in the Royal Canadian Legion Hall of Honour in the Canadian War Museum. Saint Columb's Cathedral houses miniatures of the Diamond War Memorial. The April 2011 edition of the Chelsfield Village Voice, the monthly newsletter for Chelsfield, Bromley, described a talk that local historian and author Paul Rason had given the previous month to the area historical society. The subject of the lecture was the March family of artists. The talk was accompanied by photographs of the March family home of Goddendene in Locksbottom, Farnborough. The presentation also included images of the bronze statues of the National War Memorial of Canada. In 2011, an exhibition was held at the Bromley Museum at The Priory in Orpington, Bromley. The exhibition featured the work of local artists, and included scale models by members of the March family. A black and white, silent movie filmed in 1924 followed the March artists as they worked in their studios at Goddendene, and has been reproduced by British Path√©. The original model for the National War Memorial is displayed in the Royal Canadian Legion Hall of Honour in the Canadian War Museum in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. The National War Memorial of Canada has been the site of Canada's annual National Remembrance Day celebration since 1939, the only exception being those times when construction near the site precluded it. Annual Armistice Day celebrations also take place at Vernon March's Cenotaph war memorial in Cape Town, South Africa and include wreath-laying ceremonies and processions. The autumn 2010 edition of The Pot, the annual newsletter of the Huronia Chapter of the Ontario Archaeological Society, revealed that the Champlain Monument at Couchiching Park in Orillia had been the site of a ceremony which took place on 16 October 2010. In celebration of the 400th anniversary of the first European visitor to the area, a chapter member played √âtienne Br√ªl√©. Events included a flag ceremony, an interview skit, and musical performances. The day's events were a precursor to more elaborate festivities scheduled for 2015, to celebrate the 400th anniversary of Champlain's first visit to Orillia. Vernon March's Diamond War Memorial in Derry, Northern Ireland has been the inspiration for the Diamond War Memorial Project. The project began in 2007, one of the primary goals being to research the lives of those inscribed on the memorial and disseminate the information. In the process, hundreds of additional names, never inscribed on the memorial, have been uncovered. Miniatures of the Diamond War Memorial are displayed at Saint Columb's Cathedral.

The soil of this AVA is volcanic and very porous which allows it to cool down quickly despite the increased sunlight.

This follows a move from rented premises at 27 Seaside Road, between AJ's Cafe and the South Holderness Resource Centre. History and background \\"Seaside Radio Ltd\\" was originally set up by former Holderness Gazette editor Lyz Turner in 2003, along with volunteers such as Carl Slaughter and Luke Cullen. It was part of a community based communication and entertainment radio project. However, Seaside FM actually dates back to Easter 2001 when a temporary broadcast was set up in Keyingham in a property next to the old Junior School. Several youngsters had regular slots including Sean Hunter, Tom Fisher, Darren Spencer, and Ben Fisher, amongst others. Known then as Seaside Radio, the signal was also picked up in both Withernsea and the borders of Kingston upon Hull. After the broadcast, it was thought that Seaside Radio could be developed further. A further number of small broadcasts took place in various places around the East Coast including Bridlington and Filey.rememberfileybutlins.co.uk/radio.html As well as radio broadcasting, the station also provided editing and training services for the community, which was seen as an important part of the regeneration of the area. Seaside FM also had a mobile training facility in the form of a converted camper van fully equipped with a dual CD player, MiniDisc player, mixing desk, video cameras, still cameras, and recording equipment. In November 2005, Ofcom awarded the station a full-time licence on the frequency of 105.3 MHz. On 7 December 2006, Seaside FM passed an Ofcom inspection and was given the green light to start broadcasting. After four years building Seaside FM from scratch and gaining charity status for the social enterprise, Turner stood down as Station Manager in September 2007, after obtaining all licences. In early 2007 the transmitter tower was erected before the arrival of the new manager. Irishman Justin Macartney then took over on 3 September 2007. Following a second Ofcom inspection visit, Seaside FM 105.3 launched on 5 October 2007. Macartney stayed in charge of Seaside FM for the first five-year licence term. The SHoRes Centre took over responsibility for the licence and a second five-year OFCOM licence was offered and accepted. A third five-year licence has now been offered by OFCOM. 105.3 Seaside FM continues to broadcast its popular, unique mix of well known songs, chat and local information, and is supported more by the local community than ever before.

When questioned about the expenditure, Kanemaru replied that they were provided out of \\"sympathy\\". Background Under the 1960 SOFA agreement, the support Japan was required to provide for US Forces Japan (USFJ) was limited to the provision of \\"facilities and areas\\" for use: However, with the rising of the yen against the dollar increasing the cost of maintaining forces in Japan and Japan's rapid economic growth increasing the ability of the Japanese to contribute, the United States began to pressure Japan in the mid-1970s to increase its financial support.Chiez≈ç definition for Omoiyari Yosan Origins of the Term The Japanese government first agreed to provide additional support in 1978 by assuming responsibility for the welfare payments of Japanese nationals employed by the USFJ. When questioned in the Diet about the new appropriation in June, Kanemaru made a series of statements in which he repeatedly used the word \\"omoiyari,\\" which means sympathy or consideration: *On June 6, he asked \\"given how indispensable the US-Japan relationship is and the situation with the strengthening of the yen versus the dollar, isn't it alright to have sympathy if we do this not because America is requesting it, but rather to increase the sense of trust between us?\\"Êó•Á±≥Èñ¢‰øÇ„Åå‰∏çÂèØÊ¨†„Åß„ÅÇ„Çã‰ª•‰∏ä„ÄÅÂÜÜÈ´ò„Éâ„É´ÂÆâ„Å®„ÅÑ„ÅÜ„Åì„ÅÆÁä∂Ê≥Å„ÅÆ‰∏≠„Åß„ÄÅ„Ç¢„É°„É™„Ç´„Åã„ÇâË¶ÅÊ±Ç„Åï„Çå„Çã„ÅÆ„Åß„Å™„Åè„Å¶„ÄÅ‰ø°È†ºÊÄß„ÇíÈ´ò„ÇÅ„Çã„Å®„ÅÑ„ÅÜ„Åì„Å®„Åß„ÅÇ„Çå„Å∞„ÄÅÊÄù„ÅÑ„ÇÑ„Çä„Å®„ÅÑ„ÅÜ„ÇÇ„ÅÆ„Åå„ÅÇ„Å£„Å¶„ÇÇ„ÅÑ„ÅÑ„Åò„ÇÉ„Å™„ÅÑ„Åã Diet minutes from 1978/6/6 (Japanese) *On June 8, \\"It's because I think that some sympathetic consideration here can improve the US-Japan relationship...

Although initially handled on an ad hoc basis, since 1987 the US and Japanese governments have signed a series of Special Measures Agreements (SMA) formally establishing the Japanese commitment of support. The most recent SMA, covering the five-year period from 2011‚Äì2015, was signed in January 2011. The agreements cover the categories of expenses that will be paid for by the Japanese government rather than specify specific monetary amounts.Text of the agreement The most significant expansions in Japanese support have been: * partial assumption of welfare costs for Japanese employed by USFJ (since 1978) * establishment of the Facilities Improvement Program (FIP) which provides funds for the maintenance and upgrade of facilities and areas provided to USFJ (since 1979) * partial assumption of labor costs for Japanese employed by USFJ (since 1987) * partial assumption of utility costs for USFJ (since 1991) * assumption of USFJ training relocation costs (since 1996)Ministry of Defense 2008 White Paper These expanded costs have become Japan's most significant contribution to the US-Japan security alliance. In 2002 Japan's contributions represented more than 60% of all allied financial contributions to the US and covered 75% of USFJ's operating costs.US Department of Defense - Allied Contributions to the Common Defense 2003 The appropriation amount steadily increased from 1978 to 2001, but has since declined due to pressures placed on the Japanese government (see Opposition below). The 2012 Japanese defense budget allocated ¬•186.7 billion for cost sharing (¬•144.4 billion of which are SMA-related payments.)MOD White Paper 2012 This represents a 0.5% increase from the previous year and a 10.4% decrease from 5 years earlier.MOD estimates for support costs Opposition With the downturn in Japan's economic fortunes and the ending of the Cold War, criticism by opposition parties and the public have increased. In 1998 former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa proposed ending the budget in 2000 when the then-current SMA expired due to Japan's \\"severe financial crisis.\\"Kenneth B. Pyle, \\"Japan's Immobilism\\" NBR Analysis 9:4 When the 2008 SMA came to a vote in the Japanese Diet, it was opposed by the opposition Communists, Democrats (DPJ), and Social Democrats, leading to its failure to pass the House of Councillors. Although the House of Representatives later overrode the decision, the opposition managed to create a one-month gap between the prior Agreement's expiration and the new one's passage, the first gap since the support was established in 1978.\\"ÊÄù„ÅÑ„ÇÑ„Çä‰∫àÁÆóÔºöÂèÇÈô¢Âê¶Ê±∫„ÄÅÊù•ÊúàÁô∫Âäπ„Å∏ ÂõΩ‰ºöÂàù„ÄÅË°ÜÈô¢ÂÑ™‰Ωç,\\" Mainichi Shimbun 25 April 2008 In explaining their opposition, the Democrats stated that the Japanese government needed to \\"negotiate from the viewpoint of the Japanese people,\\" while criticizing the government for destabilizing the lives of the bases' Japanese workforce.„ÅåÂõΩÊ∞ë„ÅÆÁ´ãÂ†¥„Å´Á´ã„Å£„Å¶‰∫§Ê∏â„ÇíÈÅÇË°å„Åó„Å¶ DPJ explanation for its vote against the SMA (Japanese) Shortly after becoming Prime Minister of the first non-LDP government since 1996, Yukio Hatoyama promised a \\"comprehensive review\\" of the sympathy budget.Kyodo News article The 2011 SMA was presented with few changes by his DPJ successor, however, and passed with LDP support.ÂåÖÊã¨ÁöÑ„Å™„É¨„Éì„É•„Éº Ryukyu Shimpo article See also *U.S.‚ÄìJapan Status of Forces Agreement *Japan‚ÄìUnited States relations Notes Further reading Category:Government of Japan Category:Japan‚ÄìUnited States relations Category:United States military in Japan ","title":"Omoiyari Yosan"},{"id":"13625238","text":"David Stuart (born 19 December 1965) is a Canadian actor, best known for his work as Pete in the Supernatural Season 7 episode The Girl with the Dungeons and Dragons Tattoo.

D., & Wallace, J.E. (2009) Leisure as a Coping Resource: A Test of the Job Demand- Control-Support Model. Human Relations 62 (2), 195-218. doi:10.1177/0018726708100357Esteve, R., San Martin, J. & Lopez, A.E. Grasping the meaning of leisure: Developing a self-report measurement tool. Leisure Studies, 1999, 18, 79‚Äì91. Leisure satisfaction is the positive perceptions or feelings that an individual forms, elicits and gains as a result of engaging in leisure activities and choices. What can contribute to leisure satisfaction is to what degree an individual is currently satisfied with their leisure experiences and activities. An individual might attain positive feelings of contentment and happiness that result from the satisfaction of needs.(Beard & Ragheb, 1980) Participation in leisure activities and leisure satisfaction are inextricably linked to an individual's health. Caldwell (2005) suspects that leisure activities may be associated with a number of defensive traits that enhance a person's resiliency to negative life experiences.Caldwell, L.L. Leisure and health: Why is leisure therapeutic? British Journal of Guidance and Counselling, 2005, 33, 7‚Äì26. Some aspects of leisure activities that can act as protective factors include: \\"[the activity] being personally meaningful, intrinsically interesting and/or challenging; offering social support and friendships; contributing to a sense of competence and/or self efficacy; offering a sense of personal control, choice and self-determination; and being relaxing and/or distracting the individual from negative life events.\\" Leisure activities, although ranging in types, have also proven to be beneficial to health cross-culturally.Spiers, A., & Walker, G.J. (2009). The Effects of Ethnicity and Leisure Satisfaction on Happiness, Peacefulness, and Quality of Life. Leisure Sciences, 31, 84‚Äì9. doi:10.1080/01490400802558277 Subjective well-being In a study by Hribernik and Mussap (2010), leisure satisfaction was found to predict unique variance in life satisfaction, supporting its inclusion as a distinct life domain contributing to subjective well-being.Hribernik, J., & Mussap, A. J. (2010). Research note: Leisure satisfaction and subjective well-being. Annals of Leisure Research, 13(4), 701-708. Additionally, relationship status interacted with age group and gender on differences in leisure satisfaction. The relationship between leisure satisfaction and life satisfaction, however, was reduced when considering the impact of core affect (underlying mood state). This suggests that leisure satisfaction may primarily be influenced by an individual's subjective well-being level as represented by core affect. This has implications for possible limitations in the extent to which leisure satisfaction may be improved beyond pre-existing levels of well-being and mood in individuals. In another study conducted by Brajsa-Zagnec et al. (2010), subjective well being (SWB) was defined as a combination of an individual's emotional reactions, satisfaction with specific aspects of one's life, and satisfaction with one's whole life. Many studies have been conducted to determine what specific leisure activities are linked to SWB. Research identifies other groups of leisure activities ranging from three to eleven to sixteen groups. There is no overall agreement regarding what specific groups of leisure activities predict SWB, but some researchers agree that leisure activities contribute to SWB and that the relationship between the two is complex.Brajsa-Zganec, A., Merkas, M., & Sverko, I. (2010). Quality of life and leisure activities: How do leisure activities contribute to subjective well being?. Soc Indic Res, 102, 81-91. Data was collected from a group of Croatian citizens ranging across various age groups. The participants estimated their SWB and time spent participating in leisure activities. These leisure activities included active socializing and going out (sports, going to clubs, eating dinner out etc.), visiting cultural events (reading books, going to concerts, going to movies etc.), and family and home activities (going to church, visiting family, watching television etc.). The results of the study found specific leisure activities to be a predictor of SWB across age groups. For people ages 31‚Äì60 participation in visiting cultural events, family leisure activities, and active socializing and going out contributed to SWB. A significant positive correlation was found between family leisure activities and SWB of men and women across different age groups. This study concluded that participation in leisure activities lead to SWB, though the importance of such specific leisure activities vary across different age and genders. Essentially, people may improve their SWB by participating in leisure activities, especially in family and home activities. Family leisure activities and quality of life A study conducted by London et al. (1977) was about job and leisure satisfaction contributing to quality of life (QOL). QOL was determined by asking the participants \\"How do you feel about your life as a whole\\" twice during the run of the study. As well, the participants were asked to fill out a survey that measured feelings about leisure, work, and life. It was found that activities that had to do with families and people they socialize with was significant to QOL. Overall non-job related activities (leisure activities) can be more important and a better predictor of QOL as opposed to variables of job related activities. People should consider the importance of the amount of time spent in leisure activities.London, M., Crandall, R., & Seals, G.W. (1977). The contribution of job and leisure satisfaction to quality of life. Journal of Applied Psychology, 63: 3, 328-334. Family leisure activities and family life satisfaction In a study conducted by Agate et al. 2009, participants required a child and parent from a family to fill out an online survey which measured the amount of involvement in family leisure activities and the satisfaction with involvement of family leisure activities. It was found that families' involvement in leisure activities is the best predictor for overall family life satisfaction, even more than the amount of time spent together. In early adolescent years, the amount and the satisfaction of family leisure experiences are important to the perceptions of satisfaction with family life that the adolescents will develop later on in life. Zabriskie and McCormick (2003), the study that Agate modeled his off of, also concluded that involvement in family leisure activities was the single strongest predictor of satisfaction with family life. As well, benefits of participation in family leisure activities are better communication skills among the family, better problem solving strategies, development of life and social skills, and better overall satisfaction with family life. Overall research has provided evidence for significant correlations between leisure satisfaction and satisfaction with family life.Agate, J. R., Zabriskie, R. B., Agate, S. T., & Poff, R. (2009). Family leisure satisfaction and satisfaction with family life. Journal of Leisure Research, 41: 2, 205-223. Leisure activities and marital satisfaction Not much empirical data has been collected regarding leisure activities and marital satisfaction. But with the research that has been conducted, it has been found that leisure activities influence marital satisfaction positively.Orthner, D. K. (1975). Leisure activity patterns and marital satisfaction over the marital career. Journal of Marriage and the Family, 91-102. Happily married men and women were likely to value spending time together, enjoy activities done together, and agree on recreation needs. Some research has focused on the compatibility between married couples and this influence on the types of leisure activities they choose and the relationship between their overall marital satisfactions. Some research that focused on the relationship between leisure companionship and marital satisfaction found these couples tended to participate in activities that both partners enjoyed.Crawford, D. W., Houts, R. M., Huston, T. L., & George, L. J. (2002). Compatibility, leisure, and satisfaction in marital relationships. Journal of Marriage and Family, 64, 433-339. In a study conducted by Orthner et al. (1975), the overall amount of time spent together in leisure activities is positively related to marital satisfaction for both males and females. Participants filled out a questionnaire measuring the pattern of interaction between spouses during leisure time and how much time is spent in individual, parallel, and joint leisure activities. It was found that wives spent more time alone in leisure activities than husbands across the marital career, but this individual participation was negatively correlated with marriage satisfaction. As well, the scores for marriage satisfaction were more stable for wives than husbands over time. Overall, this study concluded that the benefit of participating in leisure activities as a married couple is improved communication. Marital participation in leisure activities is the most critical during the first years of marriage and after 18‚Äì23 years of marriage when the marital relationship is reestablishing itself. Research regarding compatibility in spouses and the relationship between leisure activities and marital satisfaction have found that the couples who are less compatible are more prone to pursue leisure activities separately than highly compatible couples. This study concluded that the more spouses liked the leisure activities they were participating in, the higher their marital satisfaction was. Essentially the results of this study determined that couples participating in leisure activities together positively correlated with their marriage satisfaction. Psychological functioning The importance of leisure activities has been studied in various aspects of life. One of the most prevalent aspects of life studied with importance of leisure satisfaction is for people with psychological issues. Some psychological issues can consist of common concerns such as stress or more complex concerns such as clinical disorders. Whether a person experiences stressors at work, through depression or brain injuries, leisure satisfaction may ease the stress regardless of the type. Stress in the workforce is a common issue many people face in their lifetime, however, leisure activities may help lower a person's stress levels and increase their satisfaction. When someone engages in enjoyable leisure activities, their moods tend to increase, which in turn, allows them to better accept everyday stressors. When faced with difficult job situations one must be able to achieve adequate free time to truly enjoy their leisure activity of choice. Another important aspect of leisure activity is the type performed, whether is it an active or passive activity. Joudrey & Wallace (2009) conducted a study that statistically found the importance of active leisure activity. Passive leisure activities were suggested to give workers an ability to \\"escape\\", which in end could cause depressive moods. However, workers participating in active leisure showed considerably higher levels of mental health. People with mental disabilities often lack the ability or confidence to participate in social events, such as leisure activities. However, studies such as the one conducted by Lloyd, King, Lampe, & McDougall (2001) have been performed to prove the true importance of leisure among patients with mental disabilities. The results from their study showed a strong positive relationship between leisure satisfaction and the patients' met needs.Lloyd, C., King, R., Lampe, J. & McDougall, S. (2001). The Leisure Satisfaction of People with Psychiatric Disabilities. Psychiatric Rehabilitation Journal, 25(2), 107-113. The results basically state that the more leisure patients experienced, the more likely they felt their social, education and psychological needs were met. The study concluded that leisure is as important for people with psychiatric disabilities as it is for the general public. As Lloyd, King, Lampe, & McDougall (2001) explained, the general public may view an event, such as a leisure activity, as unsatisfactory, but to a mental patient a leisure activity can greatly raise their average happiness. Prvu, J. (1999) conducted a study among brain injury patients. Results showed that patients involved in the leisure activity program that helped increase leisure skills and knowledge of community resources also provided patients with an increase in self-confidence and leisure participation, which in turn increased leisure satisfaction.Prvu, J.

He came up with a factitious site that appeared to be set up by a man who was madly in love with a young woman named Julie, Fortheloveofjulie.com, which generated millions of page views as well as the attention of the Los Angeles Police Department, Santa Monica Police Department and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. Fortheloveofjulie.com was Street's first foray into interactive web-based media and led to several other sites including My Son Peter (a site by a man who plays hide-and-seek with his son who has been dead), Zach Mango (Jon Cryer's character in The Trouble with Normal), and Fight Club (Tyler Durden's behind-the-scenes online journal.)  Viral videos and podcasting  Street at the 2009 Streamy Awards French Maid TV was created in 2006 when Street expanded his interactive storytelling to include advertising built into the storyline. Aimed at the 18- to 24-year-old male demographic, French Maid TV consists of short (2-6 minute) videos that teach skills like CPR, How to Share Music, How Barter Online, and How to Share Photos. Each video is sponsored and the distributed on the Internet and via podcast, where the spread virally. By using Revver and having sponsored videos, Street has been able to successfully monetize his content The six episodes have been viewed over 20 million times, have been featured iTunes and as one of YouTube‚Äôs top videos. The Association for Downloadable Media is the newly formed industry association focused on providing standards for advertising and audience measurement for episodic and downloadable media. Street was nominated for chairperson at the Open Meeting held at the 2007 Podcast and New Media Expo. He declined the nomination in favor of the other candidates. Since he became well known for FrenchMaidTV.com, he feared the association may not have been taken seriously with him as chairperson in the inaugural year.

While any situation described by a Schr√∂dinger field can also be described by a many-body Schr√∂dinger equation for identical particles, the field theory is more suitable for situations where the particle number changes. A Schr√∂dinger field is also the classical limit of a quantum Schr√∂dinger field, a classical wave which satisfies the Schr√∂dinger equation. Unlike the quantum mechanical wavefunction, if there are interactions between the particles the equation will be nonlinear. These nonlinear equations describe the classical wave limit of a system of interacting identical particles. The path integral of a Schr√∂dinger field is also known as a coherent state path integral, because the field itself is an annihilation operator whose eigenstates can be thought of as coherent states of the harmonic oscillations of the field modes. Schr√∂dinger fields are useful for describing Bose‚ÄìEinstein condensation, the Bogolyubov-de Gennes equation of superconductivity, superfluidity, and many-body theory in general. They are also a useful alternative formalism for nonrelativistic quantum mechanics. A Schr√∂dinger field is the nonrelativistic limit of a Klein‚ÄìGordon field. Summary A Schr√∂dinger field is a quantum field whose quanta obey the Schr√∂dinger equation. In the classical limit, it can be understood as the quantized wave equation of a Bose Einstein condensate or a superfluid. =Free field= A Schr√∂dinger field has the free field Lagrangian : L = \\\\psi^\\\\dagger \\\\left(i{\\\\partial\\\\over \\\\partial t} + { abla^2 \\\\over 2m}\\\\right)\\\\psi. When \\\\psi is a complex valued field in a path integral, or equivalently an operator with canonical commutation relations, it describes a collection of identical nonrelativistic bosons. When \\\\psi is a grassmann valued field, or equivalently an operator with canonical anticommutation relations, the field describes identical fermions. =External potential= If the particles interact with an external potential V(x), the interaction makes a local contribution to the action: : S = \\\\int_{xt} \\\\psi^\\\\dagger \\\\left(i{\\\\partial \\\\over \\\\partial t} + { abla^2\\\\over 2m}\\\\right)\\\\psi - \\\\psi^\\\\dagger(x) \\\\psi(x) V(x). If the ordinary Schr√∂dinger equation for V has known energy eigenstates \\\\phi_i(x) with energies E_i, then the field in the action can be rotated into a diagonal basis by a mode expansion: : \\\\psi(x) = \\\\sum_i \\\\psi_i \\\\phi_i(x). \\\\, The action becomes: : S= \\\\int_t \\\\sum_i \\\\psi_i^\\\\dagger\\\\left( i{\\\\partial \\\\over \\\\partial t} - E_i\\\\right) \\\\psi_i \\\\, which is the position-momentum path integral for a collection of independent Harmonic oscillators. To see the equivalence, note that decomposed into real and imaginary parts the action is: : S= \\\\int_t \\\\sum_i 2\\\\psi_r{d\\\\psi_i\\\\over dt} - E_i(\\\\psi_r^2 + \\\\psi_i^2) after an integration by parts. Integrating over \\\\psi_r gives the action : S= \\\\int_t \\\\sum_i {1 \\\\over E_i} \\\\left({d\\\\psi_i\\\\over dt}\\\\right)^2 - E_i \\\\psi_i^2 which, rescaling \\\\scriptstyle \\\\psi_i, is a harmonic oscillator action with frequency E_i. =Pair potential= When the particles interact with a pair potential V(x_1,x_2), the interaction is a nonlocal contribution to the action: : S = \\\\int_{xt} \\\\psi^\\\\dagger \\\\left(i{\\\\partial \\\\over \\\\partial t} + { abla^2 \\\\over 2m}\\\\right)\\\\psi - \\\\int_{xy} \\\\psi^\\\\dagger(y) \\\\psi^\\\\dagger(x)V(x,y) \\\\psi(x)\\\\psi(y). A pair-potential is the non-relativistic limit of a relativistic field coupled to electrodynamics. Ignoring the propagating degrees of freedom, the interaction between nonrelativistic electrons is the coulomb repulsion. In 2+1 dimensions, this is: : V(x,y)= {j^2\\\\over y-x}. When coupled to an external potential to model classical positions of nuclei, a Schr√∂dinger field with this pair potential describes nearly all of condensed matter physics. The exceptions are effects like superfluidity, where the quantum mechanical interference of nuclei is important, and inner shell electrons where the electron motion can be relativistic. =Nonlinear Schr√∂dinger equation= A special case of a delta-function interaction V(x_1,x_2) = \\\\lambda \\\\delta(x_1 - x_2) is widely studied, and is known as the nonlinear Schr√∂dinger equation. Because the interactions always happen when two particles occupy the same point, the action for the nonlinear Schr√∂dinger equation is local: : S = \\\\int_x \\\\psi^\\\\dagger \\\\left(i{\\\\partial \\\\over \\\\partial t} + { abla^2 \\\\over 2m}\\\\right)\\\\psi + \\\\lambda \\\\int_x \\\\psi^\\\\dagger\\\\psi^\\\\dagger \\\\psi\\\\psi The interaction strength \\\\lambda requires renormalization in dimensions higher than 2 and in two dimensions it has logarithmic divergence. In any dimensions, and even with power-law divergence, the theory is well defined. If the particles are fermions, the interaction vanishes. =Many-body potentials= The potentials can include many-body contributions. The interacting Lagrangian is then: : L_i = \\\\int_x \\\\psi^\\\\dagger(x_1)\\\\psi^\\\\dagger(x_2)\\\\cdots\\\\psi^\\\\dagger(x_n) V(x_1,x_2,\\\\dots,x_n)\\\\psi(x_1)\\\\psi(x_2)\\\\cdots\\\\psi(x_n).\\\\, These types of potentials are important in some effective descriptions of close-packed atoms. Higher order interactions are less and less important. =Canonical formalism= The canonical momentum association with the field \\\\psi is : \\\\Pi(x) = i \\\\psi^\\\\dagger. \\\\, The canonical commutation relations are like an independent harmonic oscillator at each point: : [\\\\psi(x), \\\\psi^\\\\dagger (y)] = \\\\delta(x-y). The field Hamiltonian is : H = S - \\\\int \\\\Pi(x) {d\\\\over dt}\\\\psi = \\\\int { abla \\\\psi^2 \\\\over 2m} + \\\\int_{xy} \\\\psi^\\\\dagger(x)\\\\psi^\\\\dagger(y)V(x,y)\\\\psi(x)\\\\psi(y) \\\\, and the field equation for any interaction is a nonlinear and nonlocal version of the Schr√∂dinger equation. For pairwise interactions: : i{\\\\partial \\\\over \\\\partial t} \\\\psi = -{ abla^2\\\\over 2m} \\\\psi + \\\\left(\\\\int_y V(x,y)\\\\psi^\\\\dagger(y)\\\\psi(y)\\\\right) \\\\psi(x). \\\\, =Perturbation theory= The expansion in Feynman diagrams is called many-body perturbation theory. The propagator is : G(k) = {1 \\\\over i\\\\omega - {k^2\\\\over 2m} }. \\\\, The interaction vertex is the Fourier transform of the pair-potential. In all the interactions, the number of incoming and outgoing lines is equal. Exposition =Identical particles= The many body Schr√∂dinger equation for identical particles describes the time evolution of the many-body wavefunction œà(x1, x2...xN) which is the probability amplitude for N particles to have the listed positions. The Schr√∂dinger equation for œà is: : i{d\\\\over dt} \\\\psi = \\\\left(\\\\frac{ abla_1^2}{2m} + \\\\frac{ abla_2^2}{2m} + \\\\cdots \\\\+ \\\\frac{ abla_N^2}{2m} + V(x_1,x_2,\\\\dots,x_N) \\\\right)\\\\psi \\\\, with Hamiltonian : H = \\\\frac{p_1^2}{2m} + \\\\frac{p_2^2}{2m} + \\\\cdots + \\\\frac{p_N^2}{2m} + V(x_1,\\\\dots,x_N). \\\\, Since the particles are indistinguishable, the wavefunction has some symmetry under switching positions. Either #\\\\psi(x_1, x_2, \\\\dots) = \\\\psi(x_2, x_1, \\\\dots) \\\\qquad\\\\quad \\\\text{for bosons} , #\\\\psi(x_1, x_2,\\\\dots) = -\\\\psi(x_2,x_1, \\\\dots) \\\\qquad \\\\text{for fermions} . Since the particles are indistinguishable, the potential V must be unchanged under permutations. If : V(x_1,\\\\dots,x_N) = V_1(x_1)+ V_2(x_2) + \\\\cdots + V_N(x_N) \\\\, then it must be the case that V_1=V_2=\\\\cdots=V_N . If : V(x_1 ... ,x_N) = V_{1,2}(x_1,x_2) + V_{1,3}(x_2,x_3) + V_{2,3}(x_1,x_2) \\\\, then V_{1,2} = V_{1,3} = V_{2,3} and so on. In the Schr√∂dinger equation formalism, the restrictions on the potential are ad-hoc, and the classical wave limit is hard to reach. It also has limited usefulness if a system is open to the environment, because particles might coherently enter and leave. =Nonrelativistic Fock space= A Schr√∂dinger field is defined by extending the Hilbert space of states to include configurations with arbitrary particle number. A nearly complete basis for this set of states is the collection: : N;x_1,\\\\ldots,x_N\\\\rangle \\\\, labeled by the total number of particles and their position. An arbitrary state with particles at separated positions is described by a superposition of states of this form. : \\\\psi_0 0\\\\rangle + \\\\int_x \\\\psi_1(x) 1;x\\\\rangle + \\\\int_{x_1x_2} \\\\psi_2(x_1,x_2)2;x_1 x_2\\\\rangle + \\\\ldots \\\\, In this formalism, keep in mind that any two states whose positions can be permuted into each other are really the same, so the integration domains need to avoid double counting. Also keep in mind that the states with more than one particle at the same point have not yet been defined. The quantity \\\\psi_0 is the amplitude that no particles are present, and its absolute square is the probability that the system is in the vacuum. In order to reproduce the Schr√∂dinger description, the inner product on the basis states should be : \\\\langle 1;x_11;y_1\\\\rangle = \\\\delta(x_1-y_1) \\\\, : \\\\langle 2;x_1 x_2  2;y_1 y_2\\\\rangle = \\\\delta(x_1-y_1)\\\\delta(x_2-y_2) \\\\pm \\\\delta(x_1 -y_2)\\\\delta(x_2-y_1) \\\\, and so on. Since the discussion is nearly formally identical for bosons and fermions, although the physical properties are different, from here on the particles will be bosons. There are natural operators in this Hilbert space. One operator, called \\\\scriptstyle \\\\psi^\\\\dagger(x), is the operator which introduces an extra particle at x. It is defined on each basis state: : \\\\psi^\\\\dagger(x) N;x_1 ... x_n\\\\rangle = N+1; x_1, ...,x_n, x\\\\rangle \\\\, with slight ambiguity when a particle is already at x. Another operator removes a particle at x, and is called \\\\psi. This operator is the conjugate of the operator \\\\psi^\\\\dagger. Because \\\\scriptstyle \\\\psi^\\\\dagger has no matrix elements which connect to states with no particle at x, \\\\psi must give zero when acting on such a state. : \\\\psi(x) N; x_1 ... ,x_N \\\\rangle = \\\\delta(x-x_1) N-1;x_2 ...,x_N\\\\rangle + \\\\delta(x-x_2)N-1;x_1,x_3...,x_N \\\\rangle + \\\\ldots \\\\, The position basis is an inconvenient way to understand coincident particles because states with a particle localized at one point have infinite energy, so intuition is difficult. In order to see what happens when two particles are at exactly the same point, it is mathematically simplest either to make space into a discrete lattice, or to Fourier transform the field in a finite volume. The operator : \\\\psi^\\\\dagger(k)= \\\\int_x e^{-ikx} \\\\psi^\\\\dagger(x) \\\\, creates a superposition of one particle states in a plane wave state with momentum k, in other words, it produces a new particle with momentum k. The operator : \\\\psi(k) = \\\\int_x e^{ikx} \\\\psi(x) \\\\, annihilates a particle with momentum k. If the potential energy for interaction of infinitely distant particles vanishes, the fourier transformed operators in infinite volume create states which are noninteracting. The states are infinitely spread out, and the chance that the particles are nearby is zero. The matrix elements for the operators between non-coincident points reconstructs the matrix elements of the Fourier transform between all modes: # \\\\psi^\\\\dagger(k) \\\\psi^\\\\dagger(k') - \\\\psi^\\\\dagger(k')\\\\psi^\\\\dagger(k) =0 \\\\, # \\\\psi(k)\\\\psi(k') - \\\\psi(k')\\\\psi(k) =0 \\\\, # \\\\psi(k)\\\\psi^\\\\dagger(k') - \\\\psi(k')\\\\psi^\\\\dagger(k) = \\\\delta(k-k') \\\\, where the delta function is either the Dirac delta function or the Kronecker delta, depending on whether the volume is infinite or finite. The commutation relations now determine the operators completely, and when the spatial volume is finite, there are no conceptual hurdle to understand coinciding momenta because momenta are discrete. In a discrete momentum basis, the basis states are: : n_1, n_2, ... n_k \\\\rangle \\\\, where the n's are the number of particles at each momentum. For fermions and anyons, the number of particles at any momentum is always either zero or one. The operators \\\\scriptstyle \\\\psi_k have harmonic-oscillator like matrix elements between states, independent of the interaction: : \\\\psi^\\\\dagger(k)..,n_k,\\\\ldots\\\\rangle = \\\\sqrt{n_k+1}\\\\, ...,n_k+1,\\\\ldots\\\\rangle : \\\\psi(k)  ...,n_k, \\\\ldots \\\\rangle = \\\\sqrt{n_k}\\\\, ...,n_k-1,\\\\ldots\\\\rangle So that the operator : \\\\sum_k \\\\psi^\\\\dagger(k)\\\\psi(k) = \\\\int_x \\\\psi^\\\\dagger(x)\\\\psi(x) counts the total number of particles. Now it is easy to see that the matrix elements of \\\\scriptstyle \\\\psi(x) and \\\\scriptstyle \\\\psi^\\\\dagger(x) have harmonic oscillator commutation relations too. # [\\\\psi(x),\\\\psi(y)] = [\\\\psi^\\\\dagger(x),\\\\psi^\\\\dagger(y)] = 0 # [\\\\psi(x),\\\\psi^\\\\dagger(y)] = \\\\delta(x-y) So that there really is no difficulty with coincident particles in position space. The operator \\\\scriptstyle \\\\psi^\\\\dagger(x) \\\\psi(x) which removes and replaces a particle, acts as a sensor to detect if a particle is present at x. The operator \\\\scriptstyle \\\\psi^\\\\dagger abla\\\\psi acts to multiply the state by the gradient of the many body wavefunction. The operator : H= - \\\\int_x \\\\psi^\\\\dagger(x) { abla^2 \\\\over 2m } \\\\psi(x) \\\\, acts to reproduce the right hand side of the Schr√∂dinger equation when acting on any basis state, so that : \\\\psi^\\\\dagger i{d\\\\over dt} \\\\psi = \\\\psi^\\\\dagger {- abla^2 \\\\over 2m} \\\\psi \\\\, holds as an operator equation. Since this is true for an arbitrary state, it is also true without the \\\\scriptstyle \\\\psi^\\\\dagger. : i {\\\\partial \\\\over \\\\partial t} \\\\psi = {- abla^2 \\\\over 2m} \\\\psi \\\\, To add interactions, add nonlinear terms in the field equations. The field form automatically ensures that the potentials obey the restrictions from symmetry. =Field Hamiltonian= The field Hamiltonian which reproduces the equations of motion is : H= { abla \\\\psi^\\\\dagger abla\\\\psi \\\\over 2m} The Heisenberg equations of motion for this operator reproduces the equation of motion for the field. To find the classical field Lagrangian, apply a Legendre transform to the classical limit of the Hamiltonian. : L = \\\\psi^\\\\dagger \\\\left(i {\\\\partial \\\\over \\\\partial t} + { abla^2 \\\\over 2m} \\\\right)\\\\psi \\\\, Although this is correct classically, the quantum mechanical transformation is not completely conceptually straightforward because the path integral is over eigenvalues of operators œà which are not hermitian and whose eigenvalues are not orthogonal. The path integral over field states therefore seems naively to be overcounting. This is not the case, because the time derivative term in L includes the overlap between the different field states. =Relation to Klein-Gordon field= The non-relativistic limit as c\\\\to\\\\infty of any Klein-Gordon field is two Schr√∂dinger fields, representing the particle and anti-particle. For clarity, all units and constants are preserved in this derivation. From the momentum space annihilation operators \\\\hat{a}_\\\\mathbf{p},\\\\hat{b}_\\\\mathbf{p} of the relativistic field, one defines :\\\\hat{a}(x)=\\\\int d\\\\Omega_\\\\mathbf{p}\\\\hat{a}_\\\\mathbf{p}e^{-i p\\\\cdot x},\\\\quad \\\\hat{b}(x)=\\\\int d\\\\Omega_\\\\mathbf{p}\\\\hat{b}_\\\\mathbf{p}e^{-i p\\\\cdot x}, such that \\\\hat\\\\phi(x)=\\\\hat a(x)+\\\\hat b^\\\\dagger(x). Defining two \\"non-relativistic\\" fields \\\\hat{A}(x) and \\\\hat{B}(x), :\\\\hat{a}(x)=\\\\frac{e^{-i m c^2 t/\\\\hbar}}{\\\\sqrt{2mc^2}}\\\\hat{A}(x),\\\\quad \\\\hat{b}(x)=\\\\frac{e^{-i m c^2 t/\\\\hbar}}{\\\\sqrt{2mc^2}}\\\\hat{B}(x), which factor out a rapidly oscillating phase due to the rest mass plus a vestige of the relativistic measure, the Lagrangian density L = (\\\\hbar c)^2\\\\partial_\\\\mu\\\\phi\\\\partial^\\\\mu\\\\phi^\\\\dagger - (mc^2)^2\\\\phi\\\\phi^\\\\dagger becomes :\\\\begin{align} L &= (\\\\hbar c)^2(\\\\partial_\\\\mu\\\\hat{a}\\\\partial^\\\\mu\\\\hat{a}^\\\\dagger + \\\\partial_\\\\mu\\\\hat{b}\\\\partial^\\\\mu\\\\hat{b}^\\\\dagger + \\\\ldots) - (mc^2)^2(\\\\hat{a}\\\\hat{a}^\\\\dagger + \\\\hat{b}\\\\hat{b}^\\\\dagger + \\\\ldots) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\frac{1}{2mc^2}\\\\left[(\\\\hbar c)^2(\\\\frac{-imc}{\\\\hbar}\\\\hat{A} + \\\\partial_0\\\\hat{A})(\\\\frac{imc}{\\\\hbar}\\\\hat{A}^\\\\dagger + \\\\partial^0\\\\hat{A}^\\\\dagger) - (\\\\hbar c)^2\\\\partial_x\\\\hat{A}\\\\partial^x\\\\hat{A}^\\\\dagger + (A\\\\Rightarrow B) + \\\\ldots - (mc^2)^2(\\\\hat{A}\\\\hat{A}^\\\\dagger + \\\\hat{B}\\\\hat{B}^\\\\dagger + \\\\ldots)\\\\right] \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{2m}\\\\left[ \\\\frac{imc}{\\\\hbar}(\\\\partial_0\\\\hat{A}\\\\hat{A}^\\\\dagger-\\\\hat{A}\\\\partial^0\\\\hat{A}^\\\\dagger) + \\\\partial_\\\\mu\\\\hat{A}\\\\partial^\\\\mu\\\\hat{A}^\\\\dagger + (A\\\\Rightarrow B) + \\\\ldots \\\\right] \\\\end{align} where terms proportional to e^{\\\\pm 2 i m c^2 t/\\\\hbar} are represented with ellipses and disappear in the non-relativistic limit. When the four-gradient is expanded, the total divergence is ignored and terms proportional to \\\\frac{1}{c} also disappear in the non-relativistic limit. After an integration by parts, :\\\\begin{align} L_A &= i\\\\hbar\\\\hat{A}^\\\\dagger\\\\hat{A}' + \\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{2m}\\\\left[\\\\frac{1}{c^2}\\\\hat{A}'{\\\\hat{A}'}^\\\\dagger - \\\\partial_x\\\\hat{A}\\\\partial^x\\\\hat{A}^\\\\dagger \\\\right] \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= i\\\\hbar\\\\hat{A}^\\\\dagger\\\\hat{A}' + \\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{2m}\\\\left[ -(\\\\partial_x(\\\\hat{A}\\\\,\\\\partial^x\\\\hat{A}^\\\\dagger) - \\\\hat{A}\\\\,\\\\partial_x\\\\partial^x\\\\hat{A}^\\\\dagger) \\\\right] \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= i\\\\hbar\\\\hat{A}^\\\\dagger\\\\hat{A}' + \\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{2m} \\\\hat{A}\\\\,\\\\partial_x\\\\partial^x\\\\hat{A}^\\\\dagger . \\\\end{align} The final Lagrangian takes the form : L = \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left[ \\\\hat{A}^\\\\dagger(i\\\\hbar\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t} + \\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2 abla^2}{2m})\\\\hat{A} + \\\\hat{B}^\\\\dagger(i\\\\hbar\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t}+ \\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2 abla^2}{2m})\\\\hat{B} + \\\\text{h.c.} \\\\right] .

The resulting dials are now collectively known as radium dials. The luminous paint used on the dials contained a mixture of phosphor and radium, a product that the Radium Dial Company named Luna. However, unlike the US Radium Corporation, Radium Dial Company was specifically set up to only paint dials, no other radium processing took place at the premises.  History  The Radium Dial Company was started in 1917 and was in full production of painted dials by 1918. The company was a division of the Standard Chemical Company based in the Marshall Field Annex building in Chicago. In 1920 the company relocated to Peru, Illinois to closer proximity to the clock manufacturer and major customer, Westclox. By 1922 the company had moved to a former high school building in Ottawa, Illinois where it remained until the mid-1930s. At the highest point in production (around 1925), the Radium Dial Company employed around 1,000 young women who turned out around 4,300 dials each day. The company was headed by Joseph A. Kelly Sr.. Kelly opened up a new corporation called Luminous Processes Inc. a few blocks away from the Radium Dial Company in Ottawa, Illinois shortly after closing down the Radium Dial Company.

It is centred on the historic city of Makhanda in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa. The diocese extends to East London, in the east and Port Alfred to the south.  History  = Founding = Very early in his episcopate the first bishop of Cape Town, Robert Gray saw the necessity for a division of his diocese. The wars in the Eastern Province stressed the need for a missionary bishop to the natives harrying the borders, and in 1851 Gray brought the question before a synod of clergy. He realised in his canonical visitation of 1850 that Natal and Kaffraria must be separate sees, for precipitous mountains made communication in those days almost impossible. Saint Helena, too, with the islands of Ascension and Tristan da Cunha, needed more regular spiritual help and supervision than a bishop at Cape Town could give. Therefore, in 1852 Bishop Gray went to England to ask advice about such a division, and to beg for men and money for new sees. In spite of painful illness he spoke all over England, 300 times on that visit, to let churchmen know the need of reduction in the size of his diocese which stretched north to the Orange River and eastward to the Great Kei River. With the help of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel the new sees of Grahamstown and Natal were created with the money the bishop had begged. John Armstrong became the first bishop of Grahamstown and John William Colenso went to Natal. The two sees were constituted under Letters patent in 1853 and, a fortnight later, Gray received his new Letters patent for his diminished See of Cape Town and as Metropolitan of South Africa. In 1866, N. J. Merriman was Archdeacon of Grahamstown and Henry Kitton Archdeacon of British Kaffraria. = Early development = The story of the foundation of the Grahamstown diocese under its first bishop, John Armstrong, is very different from that of Natal. Archdeacon Merriman had already set the key of missionary enthusiasm, courage, and self-devotion to which the new diocese was tuned. He arrived in Grahamstown in 1848 and his journeys on foot through his huge archdeaconry are famous. He offered to be the first missionary to the Xhosas, but Bishop Gray could not spare him as archdeacon, and wished him to be the first bishop; this his humility refused. The Grahamstown diocese bordered on the often-debated and altered boundary between the Colony and Kaffraria. From the time of the first Kafir War of 1779, skirmishes, massacres, raids, and counter-attacks had taken place on both sides of the River Fish or Keiskama or whatever the authorities had decided the Kafirs must not cross. Different governors had tried to subdue the invading Xhosas by force of arms, but they had returned, and the problem seemed to be insoluble when either the astuteness of Moshesh, or merely the credulity of the natives when their witch-doctors speak, brought about their own undoing by the tragic cattle-killing of 1857. Then Galekas, Gaikas, Tembus, at the bidding of a witch-doctor and his niece, slew their cattle, believing that, when that was done, their chieftain ancestors would appear and lead them to victory against the hated white men. Instead, famine came and death from starvation, and though Sir George Grey, Governor and High Commissioner, 1854-1861, sent food, and missioners housed all they could, the numbers in British Kaffraria alone fell from 184,000 to 37,000, and the Kafir power disappeared as it seemed for ever. This wise Governor had realised before this catastrophe that, owing to the Crimean War (1854), it was impossible for Britain to spare troops to keep the natives behind the boundary lines of their territories, and he had settled German legionaries and others in the confiscated native reserves on military tenure, and had also offered large Government grants to the various missions to build churches, industrial schools, hospitals, believing that educating the natives was cheaper than sending troops to shoot them. Many new mission schools were being built by Methodists with these grants, and both Bishop Gray and the new Bishop of Grahamstown realised the enormous opportunity given to the Church to found missions to the ama-Xhosa. Both bishops wrote imploring S.P.G. to send men. As soon as possible after his arrival Bishop Armstrong visited Umhalla, of whom Bishop Gray had written on his visitation in 1850: \\"I have undertaken to found a mission in Umhalla's country midway between King William's Town and the Kei river. The chief has about 10,000 people under him, and here we hope to begin work.\\" The chief had granted to the Church a site for a mission near the deserted Fort Waterloo. Mr. Clayton was the first missionary there, and the stone of the first church for the Xhosas was laid on St. Luke's Day, 1854, and the mission took that evangelist saint as its patron. From there the bishop travelled up the Booma Pass, where many British troops had been ambushed and massacred, to Keiskama Hoek, a military station, with Mr. Dacre as its chaplain. Here in the fastnesses of the Amatolas lived the Gaikas, under their lame chief Sandile, but when they were expelled their land was given to the Fingoes, who had helped the British in the Xhosa wars. The Fingo chief gladly heard the bishop's proposal for a mission among his people, where they would learn about Christianity, and also about better ways of agriculture. The chief offered land not far from the Hoek, and Mr. Dacre nobly began work in the time he could spare from his military duties. He made the invaluable water-furrow for the mission lands, still in use, and by his influence paved the way for the first resident missionary there, H. B. Smith, who arrived in September, 1855. Sir George Grey granted 693 acres of land to this mission, which was called St. Matthew's. During Bishop Armstrong's second journey in 1855, he visited Sandile, who at once consented to have Church missions in his land, and offered a site near his kraal on the Kabusie river. This was eventually called St. John's. There still remained the great Kreli, who lived further east across the Kei, and to see him the bishop travelled through bare country, with scarcely a human being, or an animal, or even a green bush, to be seen for miles, and the hot sun beating down was paralysing. A police horse was lent to him, which saved him from the almost intolerable jolting of the waggon over the rough veld, and after nearly a week's journey he reached the banks of the White Kei, across which, nearly seven miles away, was the king's kraal. Here, with fifty men, Kreli came to visit the bishop. He very readily agreed to have missionaries in his country, though his 600,000 people were not in any way under British rule. A little later the great mission station of St. Mark's was founded by Henry Waters. = Later developments = The Diocese of Grahamstown has been divided three times in its history; three independent daughter diocese have been formed: * Diocese of Mthatha (formerly Diocese of St John's) in 1872 * Diocese of Port Elizabeth in 1970 * Diocese of Ukhahlamba in 2009 = List of bishops =  Diocesan structure  The diocese is split into 11 archdeaconries; each of which comprises a number of parishes: {  valign=\\"top\\" = Archdeaconry of Albany = Archdeacon: the Reverend Canon Cynthia Webstock * St Barnabas, Alicedale * St Barnabas, Namato, Port Alfred * St Cyprian, Highlands * St James, Southwell * St John the Evangelist, Bathurst * St Mary, Cuylerville * St Paul, Port Alfred * St Peter, Sidbury = Archdeaconry of Alice = * Church of the Resurrection * Holy Trinity Fort Beaufort * St Andrew Bedford * St Bartholomew Alice * St John Fort Beaufort * St Matthew Keiskammahoek * St Michael Adelaide * St Patrick Hogsback = Archdeaconry of East London Central = Arhdeacon: Ven.

Built in 1739, it is the sole colonial-era building which survived the various wars that Norfolk has witnessed. The church has played host to several different denominations throughout its history. Originally an Anglican church, the building was home to a Baptist parish in the early-19th century and was finally converted back into an Episcopal church. and Accompanying photo History =Tenants= During the Revolutionary War, the Church of England was disestablished in Virginia and replaced with the Protestant Episcopal Church in America. The Elizabeth River Parish of this new church was divided in 1797 by two feuding congregations. One faction formed Christ Church (which later became Christ and St. Luke's Church), while the other retained the building until 1803, when it was acquired by Baptists. The Episcopalians reclaimed the building in 1832, and Bishop Richard Channing Moore reconsecrated it under the name Saint Paul's. =In wartime= Cannonball in the wall of Saint Paul's Episcopal Church Following his defeat at the Battle of Great Bridge, Lord Dunmore attacked Norfolk from the sea as he fled Virginia on January 1, 1776. In retaliation, patriots set fire to the homes of loyalists; however, the fire became unmanageable, and nearly the entire town was destroyed by the flames. The church was the only major building in the city to escape substantial damage in the assault, though a cannonball (purportedly fired by the Liverpool) did strike its wall. By the 1830s, the cannonball was no longer embedded in the wall. However, it was discovered buried in the yard of the church, and returned to its original resting place in the 1840s, and remains there today. During the Civil War, the building acted as a chapel for the Union army, and was returned after the surrender of Robert E. Lee, though it required extensive repairs. Visiting the church while in Norfolk during World War II, Lord Louis Mountbatten is reputed to have said that Dunmore's cannonball \\"damn near missed\\" its target.  Notable ceremonies  General Douglas McArthur requested to be buried in Norfolk, Virginia, where his mother had been born and where his parents had married. Accordingly, his funeral service was held in St Paul's and his body was finally laid to rest in the rotunda of the Douglas MacArthur Memorial (the former courthouse in Norfolk) on 11 April 1964.

In certain taxation regimes a deposit need not be declared as part of the gross income of the receiving party (person or corporation) until either the depositing party or an arbitrator agrees the funds may be used for the intended purpose. The United States Supreme Court ruled in Commissioner v. Indianapolis Power & Light Co. (1990) that a deposit differs from an advance payment because the depositing party has dominion over the funds and retains the right to insist upon repayment in cash. On the other hand, the party making an advance payment retains no right to insist upon the return of the funds as long as the recipient fulfills the contractual agreement.Commissioner v. Indianapolis Power & Light Co., 493 U.S. 203 (1990) The rationale behind the court‚Äôs decision is that the recipient of the deposit does not enjoy ‚Äúcomplete dominion‚Äù over the funds and is subject to an express obligation to repay so long as the customer fulfills his or her legal obligations. Additionally, both the timing and the method of refund are largely within the control of the depositing party, as he or she can choose to insist upon repayment in cash or apply the deposit to purchase services. The recipient‚Äôs right to retain the funds of the deposit is contingent upon events that are outside of his or her control. Although the recipient may receive an economic benefit from the deposits ‚Äì i.e. interest ‚Äì the prospect that income will be generated provides no ground for taxing the principal. However, any income that the recipient may earn through the use of the deposit money will be taxable. In leasing Security deposits are required most often by lessors of automobiles, apartments, and commercial real estate. The security deposits required by many residential landlords of their tenants are the source of much dispute and litigation. Many states and municipalities have enacted laws that specifically regulate the landlord's ability to withhold tenant security deposits after a tenant moves out. Some states and cities require that interest be paid to the tenant as it is earned on the security deposit. A landlord's deductions from a tenant's security deposit must be reasonable. The landlord may make deductions for missing rent payments and for damages beyond ordinary wear and tear, which is the subject matter's depreciation or deterioration in value by reasonable and ordinary use by the tenant. Examples of non-deductible wear and tear include: paint retouching, minor cleaning, small tack holes, and nicks and scratches. Examples of deductible damages include large or excessive holes in the wall, carpet stains, and broken doors and windows. If a landlord wrongfully withholds a tenant's security deposit, the tenant may be entitled to additional damages beyond the amount of the security deposit. These may include statutory damages for violation of a local statute on consumer collection practices, damages that may be two or three times the amount of the deposit (in some states, such as California), consequential (resulting) damages, interest, and in more rare instances punitive damages. In some legal regimes the deposit has to be placed with an independent escrow agent or licensed deposit taker such as a bank so that the risk of fraud is reduced and the funds earn interest at a fair market rate. Often car rental and car leasing companies will require a deposit to protect themselves against possible damage to the car. Once the car is returned, it is checked for any possible damage, and if damage is found, funds are deducted from the deposit to cover the repairs and the loss of value. In the United States of America, Washington DC, Alaska, Illinois, and Wisconsin have notably more tenant-friendly legislation than states like Indiana or Michigan, for example. The cities of Madison, Wisconsin, and Chicago, Illinois, have substantially greater protection of tenants' security deposit rights than the surrounding areas.Madison's General Ordinance Chapter 32 and Chicago's Residential Landlord Tenant Ordinance. Studies have shown that landlords often improperly withhold security deposits after tenants move out, and often get away with it because it's too much trouble to fight.https://www.cityofberkeley.info/uploadedFiles/Rent_Stabilization_Board/Level_3_-_General/8.a.11_Tenants%20Together%20Report%20on%20Security%20Deposits.pdf In metropolitan cities of India like Chennai, Bangalore, Mumbai or others, there is security deposit to be given upfront to the landlord before renting/leasing an apartment. This security deposit amount can range anywhere from 3- 11 months, depending upon city's norm. With rentals soaring high in metropolitan cities, this amount becomes exorbitant.Economic Times\\"Retrieved 5.01.2019 Hence, anyone shifting an apartment or moving cities in lieu to job change, finds it difficult financially. It is a dent on savings as this cost is not borne by the company that has helped the shifter's movers and packers. The recent changes to the condominium and cooperative laws in New York have created limits for the regulations behind security deposits. Cooperative boards can no longer charge more than one month of prepaid maintenance and another month's maintenance as a security deposit restricting the amount to be owed before moving in.https://cooperator.com/article/recent-changes-to-co-op- condo-laws/full#cut https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/21/nyregion/rent-laws-new- york.html See also * Collateral (finance) * Damage deposit * Deposit (finance) * Earnest payment * Escrow * Key money * Lease External links * Why Do Landlords Take a Deposit?

Educated at North Adelaide Grammar School, in 1881 Sandover attained first-class honours in the senior public examination. His older brother, William Sandover, Jnr., (c. 1856 ‚Äì c. 22 May 1921) had moved to Western Australia around 1880 and opened a chemist's shop and hardware store, and called on Alfred to help him run the business, W.

Alfred arrived in Fremantle in 1884, and initially found the dust, the glare, and temperature of 41 ¬∞C (106 ¬∞F), unbearable; he determined to return as soon as his contract term elapsed, yet Sandover eventually decided to remain in Western Australia for the rest of his life. The company prospered: gold was discovered at Coolgardie and Kalgoorlie, and the 1890s saw a huge demand for machinery and all kinds of hardware which W. Sandover & Co. was able to supply. On 11 July 1895, Alfred Sandover married Rose Allen at St. Georges Church in Malvern, Victoria, and in 1896 they bought an property in Claremont, which they named \\"Knutsford\\". In 1921, Sandover provided for the Western Australian Football league the medal for the fairest and best footballer during the regular season. The medal is awarded annually in the week before the grand final with a descendant of Sandover present for the presentation.

The appellation extends over a flat expanse of well-drained gravel soil between the Vaca and Mayacamas Mountains. Oakville AVA is known for its success with Bordeaux varietals, which have produced wines of rich texture, firm tannins, and notes of mint and herbs. Geography and climate The soil of the Oakville AVA is the result of sedimentary deposits from the hills that form Napa Valley. The soil is gravelly and sandy, with exceptionally good drainage. The portion of the AVA between State Route 29 and the Silverado Trail is a mix of clay and well- drained sandy loam. Oakville AVA has a warm climate well-suited to wine grape production. Wind and fog arriving from San Pablo Bay can affect the morning and evening hours, but their effects are limited by the intervening Yountville Mounts. History H. W. Crabb planted the first vineyard here in 1868, on of land close to the Napa River that he named To Kalon, Greek for \\"most beautiful\\". By 1877, Crabb had planted and was producing 50,000 gallons (189,250 liters) of wine per year. By 1880, his vineyard had increased to . The historic To Kalon Vineyard, owned by the Robert Mondavi Winery, Andy Beckstoffer and four other owners, is still producing grapes today. In 1903, the United States Department of Agriculture established an experimental vineyard station in Oakville. Known as \\"Oakville Station\\", the vineyard is operated by the University of California at Davis. Oakville AVA was officially declared a sub-appellation of Napa Valley in 1993.

Action against the CSS Virginia Whitehall saw her final action on 8 and 9 March 1862 against the Confederate ironclad CSS Virginia, the former Merrimack. On 8 March, federal gunboats, including Whitehall, attempted to draw the Rebel vessel away from Union warships anchored off Newport News, Virginia. Failing this, Whitehall engaged Confederate steamers Yorktown and CSS Jamestown, inflicting minor damage. During the Battle of the Monitor and Merrimack on 9 March 1862, Whitehall and the rest of the Union fleet abstained from direct battle, preferring to fire long-range, ineffective shots at Virginia. Whitehall suffered three casualties and had parts of her upperworks burned by Confederate shot during the two days of activity. Whitehall destroyed by fire Early on the morning of 10 March 1862 at Old Point Comfort, Virginia, a flash fire swept and totally destroyed Whitehall. There were no casualties.

However, his primary focus was on contemporary classical music and with always an interest in championing work he believed was underappreciated, such as that of Artur Schnabel and Armin Loos. Executor As the copyright holder for his parents' work, Zukofsky gained a reputation as a restrictive and contentious guardian of his property rights, joining a list of literary estates that have taken a controlling and often confrontational position with regard to scholars, of which perhaps the most notorious has been the James Joyce estate.Max, D.T.

The letter evidences his strong animus against academics and suspicion of their motives. On the other hand, he kept the considerable body of his father's work in print and supported the publication of several volumes of correspondence, so that there has been far better access to the work than at any time during his father's lifetime.

The dam has been in service for 70 years and was recently placed on the USACE's \\"Urgent\\" dam safety classification list and plans are currently being drafted that would allocate funds for dam stabilization.  History  Construction of the Mohawk Dam was started in April 1935 and was completed in September 1937. The dam was authorized by the Flood Control Act of 1938 and was built as a dry dam along with 13 other dams in the Muskingum River Watershed for flood control and water conservation. The dam was built right across the right-of-way of the Walhonding Canal, which ran from Coshocton to Cavallo.US Army Corps of Engineers. Mohawk Dam. Accessed online: 7 October 2007. The dam has always operated as a dry dam, holding back water only during a flood and releasing it slowly downstream.

Future  The dam has been in service for 70 years but was only built with the expectation that it would function for around 50 years before sedimentation and erosion weakened the dam. The dam has weakened and several safety issues have arisen, which is why the USACE has placed it on its list of the nation's most at-risk dams, where it ranked seventh most at-risk in 2006. In 2007, the dam was classified as \\"Urgent\\", which is the second- highest classification level of the dam safety rating system used by the USACE. This classification indicates that the dam is a high federal priority for repairs since failure of the dam during a flood is moderately uncertain.Muskingum Watershed Conservancy District.

The MWCD estimates that if the Mohawk Dam were to fail during a flood, the water normally held back could cost 307 people their lives and up to $449 million in property damage. According to the MWCD, the dam's greatest problem is the inherent downstream seepage that occurs with most earthen dams. In the case of the Mohawk Dam, this condition is exacerbated by the fact that it was built on highly permeable land, which could cause instability if too much water were to seep through the lower part of the dam. A rehabilitation and repair plan to stabilize the structure has not yet been established, nor has an official cost-estimate been prepared. Funds were set aside by Congress in 2006 and 2007 to analyze the current state of the dam and gather data for a rehabilitation report. The MWCD serves as the local sponsor of the rehabilitation projects and must pay 3.45 percent of the costs. The remainder will be paid by the federal government. In order to pay for their share, the MWCD will levy an assessment of the properties in its 18-county district, requiring those property owners to pay for the dam improvements throughout the entire watershed. The total local-share cost to be paid by the MWCD for the work on four of the dams, including the Mohawk Dam, is estimated to be between $95 million and $135 million.

The film was directed by Ren Xudong and produced by the August First Film Studio. It is considered to be one of the first movies to discuss the use of tunnels in war. Plot =Prologue= The movie begins with the ringing of a large bell, in Gao village, causing the villagers to all gather in the village square. They await the return of Chuanbao, the village militia Sergeant, and the village elder. The twosome arrive with Chuanbao carrying the village elder on his back. The village elder explains that they were attacked by Japanese forces in the middle of a meeting and has been seriously wounded as a result. With a few parting words instructing his successor, Laozhong, to \\"keep holding on\\", he dies. =First confrontation= The movie then cuts to a fighting scene between large numbers of Japanese and Chinese forces. Against superior firepower, the main Chinese army retreats while leaving local resistance militias in place to harass the enemy. Local villagers hide in tunnels below the surface of the village in order to escape the Japanese attackers. The Japanese seem to have some familiarity with this tactic as they search for and attempt to kill the occupants of these tunnels. The attack concludes with capture of a number of villagers and a flaming village being burnt as a result of raiding by the Japanese. Some time afterward, Chuanbao and a few militia are shown discussing their next course of action against the Japanese. One of the soldiers complain about having \\"too few people and too few weapons\\" but Brother Gao manages to restore the confidence of his men by rallying them for an attack. However, he is stopped by a middle aged woman, Xia Lin, who seems to hold authority over him. She tells them to meet back in the village for a village meeting. After reading aloud On Protracted War, a strategy literature by Mao Zedong, the villagers decide to begin digging extensive tunnels beneath the village in preparation for more fighting against the Japanese. Meanwhile, the Japanese hear of these resistance plans and plan a night raid on the village. The Japanese are almost able to sneak in completely undetected, but were accidentally discovered by Laozhong while he was outside for a stroll. Laozhong is able to ring the village bell, sounding the alarm, allowing the rest of the villagers to enter into the safety of the tunnels. The Japanese raiders surround Laozhong and the Japanese General Yamada shoots Laozhong. Before he dies, Laozhong is able to use a grenade to kill several Japanese soldiers. The Japanese are initially unable to find anymore villagers so they begin to look for the tunnels by digging into the ground. Upon finding the tunnels, they pour water, spew smoke and potentially poison gas into the tunnels. After trying to plug up the smoke and gas, Chuanbao realizes that they can't hold out forever. In consultation with Xia Lin, he decides to go to the surface through a secret tunnel in order to draw away the Japanese. He secretly shoots at Yamada's hip, wounding him. Meanwhile, other nearby villages come to give aid by setting off fireworks which mimic the sounds of gunfire in order to intimidate the Japanese. Collaborationist Chinese Army General Binghui suggests that the Japanese retreat and Yamada grudgingly agrees. =Second confrontation= Some days later, Chuanbao is shown to be surveying the damage done to his village by the Japanese raid. Chuanbao despairs at the destruction but meets Uncle Pingyuan and is comforted by him. After conversing with Uncle Pingyuan, Chuanbao resolves to see the conflict through to the end and is advised by Pingyuan to read more of Maozedong's strategy literature. As Chuanbao reads the literature, he is inspired by a quote \\"To protect yourself is to better destroy the enemy. To destroy the enemy is to better protect yourself.\\" He brings this concept before the rest of village and receives unanimous support. They decide to try making the tunnels into an offensive option against the Japanese soldiers instead of only using them as hiding places. Over at least one winter season, the tunnels develop defensive sophistication meant to defend against flooding, poison gas and infiltrators. Additionally, there are offensive capabilities devised in order to attack Japanese soldiers on the surface. The tunnel design is taken on by several neighboring villages. Additionally, the villagers are told that communist reinforcements are also returning to the area. The Japanese hear of this and use the opportunity to send in spies posing as the communist reinforcements in order learn more about the tunnel defenses. The impostor reinforcements plan to gather all the local resistance leaders and then capture them all by surprise. However, before they are able to initiate the plan, Chuanbao realizes their plot. He tricks some of them to split up and enter the tunnels and kills the spies one by one in the enclosed space. During this time, the real Communist forces arrive and apprehend the remaining spies. Japanese troops arrive to facilitate the capture, but are swiftly repelled by the Communist's reinforcement regiment. With all the major elements of the Chinese forces present, the Chinese forces prepare for an imminent counterattack by the Japanese. The ensuing engagement between 300 Japanese forces and local militia result in a total victory for the Chinese. Initially, the Chinese militia are overwhelmed by Japanese artillery, but the Japanese infantry take heavy casualties when trying to finally take the village and are forced to retreat. =Final confrontation= In the aftermath of the previous victory, the militia continue expanding the tunnel network. They begin to expand outside the village and eventually reach the vicinity of the Japanese villages; all the resistance villages are also interconnected. Chuanbao makes a joke about \\"undermining\\" the entire Japanese base. Meanwhile, the Japanese forces have fortified and reinforced their base positions making direct assault by the Chinese forces extremely difficult. The Chinese try to draw out the dug in Japanese with a diversionary attack on a lesser defended base. However, General Yamada of the Japanese sees through the plot and, hoping they'll score an easy victory at the village, directly attack the militia village, The communist command realizes the Japanese plan, but is confident that the forces stationed in the village are sufficient for defense. They instead use the absence of the Japanese main force as an opportunity to assault the previously fortified Japanese base. In preparation for the inevitable Japanese retreat, the Chinese prepared troops to ambush the Japanese on the way. In the tunnels beneath the Japanese base, the Chinese militia place explosives to take out key defensive positions. With preparations complete, the primary Chinese army commences with the assault. As predicted, the Japanese main force begins to retreat upon hearing of the Chinese assault and are caught directly in the ambush in the open fields. Hundreds of armed Chinese militia are shown to be attacking the surprised Japanese forces. By the end, General Yamada is shown to be trapped in a brick kiln. Surrounded by Chinese forces and all alone, it is implied that the Japanese forces have been completely routed. The movie concludes with a festive celebration by the victorious Chinese.

The area's protected status has been remarked upon by former Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas:  Recreational activities  Residence at the refuge headquarters * Wildlife photography and observation are the most popular refuge activities. There are permanent blinds throughout the refuge. * Hiking is encouraged, but trails are not maintained, though most of the terrain permits cross-country hiking. * Backpacking is the only way to experience remote parts of the refuge. * Camping is free, but there are no reservations, and there is a 14-day limit. Generators and power equipment are prohibited. * Bicycling is limited to roads open to motor vehicles, but the rough roads require sturdy bikes. * Fishing is allowed in a few locations, with an Oregon fishing license. * Hunting is permitted for a very limited number of deer, pronghorn and bighorn sheep. * Rock collecting is limited to per day, only surface objects may be collected, Digging and blasting are not allowed. The nearby Bureau of Land Management Sunstone mine is a source for the Oregon state gemstone.  Logistics  None of the refuge's roads are paved, and most are not passable by passenger autos. A few roads are graded, but most are dirt ruts (\\"jeep trails\\"). No services are available within the refuge, except compressed air, potable water, and a restroom at the refuge's headquarters. The nearest fuel and grocery is in Plush, west, and Frenchglen, east. Lakeview, southwest, is the nearest city with basic services such as vehicle repair, lodging, and medical care. Accommodations are available in Frenchglen.  Wildlife  Pronghorn The diverse habitat supports diverse wildlife: There are 239 bird species, 42 species of mammal, and at least eight species of reptile, including rattlesnake, bull snake, eastern yellowbelly racer, and various lizards. Residents active year round include deer, bobcat, coyote, pronghorn, bighorn sheep, marmot, squirrel, and rabbit. Most birds are seasonal. Golden eagle, sandhill crane, colorful sage grouse, and numerous migratory species. The pronghorn are North America's fastest land animal, capable of speeds up to , run free across the upland sagebrush at the east side. Bighorn sheep prefer the rocky cliffs of the refuge's west side. Numerous shallow lakes, grassy spring fed meadows attract the greatest variety of species. Bighorn sheep were eliminated by disease and hunting in this area by 1915. Reintroduction began in 1954 from British Columbia stock. There are now approximately 300 bighorn sheep.  Cattle Grazing  Cattle grazing in the refuge caused damage including overgrazing, eroded stream banks, trampled springs, damaged aspen groves, and destroyed wildlife habitat. In 1994 cattle grazing was banned inside the refuge. A study published in 2015 described the recovery of the landscape after cattle were removed, the return of vegetation including aspens, rushes, and willows, and the restoration of riparian areas.

It was composed in 1923, with lyrics by Cecil Mack and music by James P. Johnson, who first introduced the stride piano method of playing. The song was featured in the American black Broadway musical comedy show Runnin' Wild, which had its premiere at the New Colonial Theatre in New York on October 29, 1923.Runnin' Wild The music of the dockworkers from South Carolina inspired Johnson to compose the music. The dance known as the Charleston came to characterize the times. Lyrics, though rarely sung (an exception is Chubby Checker's 1961 recording), were penned by Cecil Mack, himself one of the most accomplished songwriters of the early 1900s. The song's driving rhythm, basically the first bar of a 3 2 clave, came to have widespread use in jazz comping and musicians still reference it by name.Hughes, Fred (2002). The Jazz Pianist: Left Hand Voicings and Chord Theory, p.6. . Harmonically, the song features a five-chord ragtime progression (I-VI7-II7-V7-I).Weissman, Dick (2001).

Ginger Rogers dances to the music in the film Roxie Hart (1942).https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Myq6hg2gcWw In the movies Margie (1946) and It's a Wonderful Life (1946), the song is played during school dance scenes. In the movie Tea for Two (1950), with Doris Day and Gordon MacRae, the song is a featured production number.The New York Times: Tea for Two (1950) The song appears during the end credits of the 1981 film The Evil Dead. A version performed by Enoch Light and the Charleston City All Stars is used in Woody Allen's 2011 film Midnight in Paris, which largely takes place in the 1920s. The track \\"Bang Bang\\" from the 2013 film The Great Gatsby, performed by Will.I.Am, samples the song.

These \\"purposes and principles\\" reflect a premise that the effectiveness of the United Nations would be enhanced with broad guidelines to guide the actions of its Organisations and member states. However, some members were concerned that these proposals granted what they considered overly broad discretionary powers for the organs of the United Nations in the Dumbarton Oaks Conference proposals. And the adopted purposes and principles have been seen as reflecting the compromise achieved. Article 1: Purposes of the United Nations The adopted purposes of the United Nations reflect a premise that are the effective Dumbarton Oaks proposals. I.e. :\\" # To maintain international peace and security, and to that end: to take effective collective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to the peace, and for the suppression of acts of aggression or other breaches of the peace, and to bring about by peaceful means, and in conformity with the principles of justice and international law, adjustment or settlement of international disputes or situations which might lead to a breach of the peace; # To develop friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples, and to take other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace; # To achieve international co-operation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural, or humanitarian character, and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion; and # To be a centre for harmonizing the actions of nations in the attainment of these common ends.\\" Article 2: Principles of the United Nations \\"The Organization and its Members, in pursuit of the Purposes stated in Article 1, shall act in accordance with the following Principles. # The Organization is based on the principle of the sovereign equality of all its Members. # All Members, in order to ensure to all of them the rights and benefits resulting from membership, shall fulfill in good faith the obligations assumed by them in accordance with the present Charter. # All Members shall settle their international disputes by peaceful means in such a manner that international peace and security, and justice, are not endangered. # All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations. # All Members shall give the United Nations every assistance in any action it takes in accordance with the present Charter, and shall refrain from giving assistance to any state against which the United Nations is taking preventive or enforcement action. # The Organization shall ensure that states which are not Members of the United Nations act in accordance with these Principles so far as may be necessary for the maintenance of international peace and security. # Nothing contained in the present Charter shall authorize the United Nations to intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state or shall require the Members to submit such matters to settlement under the present Charter; but this principle shall not prejudice the application of enforcement measures under Chapter Vll.\\" Article 2, clauses 3-4 essentially prohibit threat or use of force as well as war (except in self-defense; The right to self-defense is reaffirmed in Article 51, which states, \\"Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defense if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations ...\\"). Article 2, clauses 4-5 essentially prohibits also (support of) activities against the territorial integrity or political independence of another state (including covert operations).

He was known as the ‚ÄúMaster of Yunqi‚Äù, after a monastery restored in his honor. He was born in Hangzhou into a family with the surname Shen. Zhu was an excellent student, although he never succeeded along the path of officialdom. His first connection to Buddhism was that of the Pure Land variety. After failure in the official examinations he became a monk at thirty-one despite the existence of his second wife, who later became a nun. Zhu Hong died at the age of eighty-one. Zhu Hong is best remembered for his persistent hostility to Roman Catholicism. Zhu's writings are a direct rebuttal to the Jesuit Matteo Ricci (Âà©Áë™Á´á). Traditional Buddhist monasticism had declined by Zhu Hong's age. The English translation of heshang (ÂíåÂ∞ö) as ‚Äúmonk‚Äù by the late Ming is perhaps inappropriate. A better rendition might be ‚Äúpriest‚Äù as it is often used in Japan to describe those specialist practitioners of funeral rites and memorial services. Zhu Hong himself complained that ‚ÄúMonks are also geomancers, diviners, physiognomists, physicians, gynecologists, potion makers, spirit healers and alchemists. All of the above entail the extreme demise of Buddhism (Sanbi, p. 12b).‚Äù The Jesuit entry into sixteenth century China placed them in the middle of such conditions. For Zhu Hong and other Buddhists the Jesuits were an additional headache to a long list of serious problems. Zhu Hong's rebuttal of Catholicism was the first of a longer and ever-growing response. At the first stage of anti-Catholicism the Buddhists had a weak grasp of the religion. Zhu's Tianshuo (Â§©ËØ¥, Explanation of Heaven) appeared in his Sanbi collection in 1615. Matteo Ricci's monumental theological work Tienzhu shiyi (Â§©‰∏ªÂØ¶Áæ©) had already appeared in 1596. Zhu Hongs polemic coincided with the political appointment of Shen Que (Ê≤àÈö∫, d. 1624) as vice minister of rites in Nanking (Nanjing) and his initiation of an anti-Catholic campaign from official circles in 1616. Zhu Hongs collected essays, the Zhuzhuang suibi was written and published in three sections, the Chubi (ÂàùÁ¨î), Erbi (‰∫åÁ¨î) and the Sanbi (‰∏âÁ¨î), modeled after the classic Song period collection Rongzhai suibi. Zhu Hong's first collection was published in 1600 at age 70, the second and third at age 81 in 1615.

Wales Island is bounded on the north by the Pearse Canal and Wales Passage, and by Tongass Passage and Portland Inlet to the south. The international boundary between Alaska and British Columbia bisects Pearse Canal over a distance of , such that the view from the north-west shore of Wales Island looks out over Alaska, specifically, Fillmore Island in the Misty Fjords National Monument. Within Canada, Pearse Island lies to the northeast. In August 1793, during his exploration of the west coast of North America in HMS Discovery, Captain George Vancouver named Wales Point, at the entrance to Portland Inlet, after William Wales, master of the Royal Mathematical School at Christ's Hospital, London. Both Wales and Vancouver had accompanied Captain James Cook on his second circumnavigation of the globe in , 1772‚Äì75. At the time, George Vancouver was a young midshipman, and William Wales was the ship's astronomer. Vancouver later credited Wales with teaching him the necessary navigational skills which enabled his own explorations of the Pacific region in the early 1790s. Vancouver also accompanied Captain Cook on his third and final voyage, 1776‚Äì79. In 1871, an official at the British Hydrographic Office named Wales Island in association with the point of land named 78 years earlier by Captain Vancouver.  History  For an obscure island in a remote corner of the B.C. coast, Wales Island was to play a pivotal role in the often contentious Alaska Boundary Dispute between Canada and the United States. This dispute had its roots in the 1825 treaty signed by Russia and Great Britain, which attempted to define, in principle more than fact, the boundary that lay between Alaska and what was then the west coast of British North America. Included in the terms of this treaty was the stipulation that the southernmost boundary of Alaskan territory would advance northwards through Portland Canal to the 56th parallel north. This demarcation was claimed to have placed Wales Island firmly in Alaskan territory. Imperial Namu leaving Wales Island Cannery, 1947 There the matter lay until Russia sold Alaska to the United States in 1867, and British Columbia became a province of Canada four years later, in 1871. Between this period and the final settlement of the boundary question in 1903, survey crews from both Canada and the United States actively explored, mapped and charted the high mountains, deep fjords, glaciers and bogland of this rugged terrain, often in collaboration. In 1896, the military intervened in the form of the United States Army Corps of Engineers, which constructed four stone houses in the Portland Canal area. This was done to strengthen America's claim to the Canal as the southernmost boundary of Alaska. One of these sturdy structures was built on the south shore of Wales Island, while another, on the border between Stewart, BC and Hyder, Alaska, can still be seen today. Two years later, the potential mineral wealth of the far north, as revealed by the Klondike Gold Rush of 1898, convinced both Canada and the United States that a new Alaska boundary treaty was urgently required. This renewed interest in the region led eventually to the signing of the Hay-Herbert Treaty in January, 1903. The terms of the treaty provided for a tribunal to settle the boundary question in precise geographical language. Thus, over the next several months, the Alaska Boundary Tribunal, with Canadian, American and British representatives, duly measured, mapped and deliberated, before delivering its award in October of that year. Among the many consequences of this final demarcation of the boundaries of the Alaskan Panhandle was the result that Wales Island now belonged to British Columbia. In 1902, while Wales Island was still claimed to be in U.S. territory, a salmon cannery was built on the east shore of Pearse Canal, on the north-west side of the island. But as a result of the 1903 Tribunal Award, the American owners of the cannery forfeited possession of their facility, which by then had produced more than 3500 cases of canned salmon. Wales Island Cannery, Pearse Canal, 1948At the same time, Hidden Inlet Cannery, situated further north on the west shore of Pearse Canal, had suffered a reverse fate, and was now in Alaskan territory. In 1910, Merrill DesBrisay, the former Canadian owner of Hidden Inlet Cannery purchased Wales Island Cannery and rebuilt it. For the next 14 years, DesBrisay and Company operated the plant before selling to the Canadian Fishing Company in 1925. Wales Island Cannery had its peak production of 50,000 cases of salmon in the 1924 season. It produced its final pack of 26,000 cases in 1949, the last of eleven canneries to operate in the Nass River-Portland Canal area. For several years thereafter, the plant functioned as a summer gillnet station before being abandoned in the late 1950s. Today, a fly-in fishing lodge (Eagle Pointe) occupies the site of the former Wales Island Cannery. Coda: In 1936, the U.S. Congress granted $100,000 to the former American owners of Wales Island Cannery, as compensation for the loss of their property 33 years earlier.  Ecology  Wales Island lies on the northern edge of the Hecate Lowland Ecosection, a once heavily glaciated band of narrow lowland rain forest and coastal archipelago that stretches from Portland Inlet in the north to Queen Charlotte Strait in the south. Hecate Lowland terrain is generally rough and rocky, with wide areas of muskeg wetland and bog forest. Tree species include western red cedar, yellow cedar, mountain hemlock and fir. Salal, ferns, berry bush and skunk cabbage are commonly found undergrowth. Lowland climate in the Wales Island region is dominated by frontal flows from Dixon Entrance, resulting in frequent wind storms and heavy rainfall. Waterfowl are found in abundance throughout the protected inlets and estuaries that indent Wales Island's coastline of . Species include murre, grebe, murrelet, gull, tern, loon, auklet, petrel and eagle. The island's topography affords a profusion of breeding and nesting habitat for a wide variety of seabirds, and is an integral component of the Pacific coast migratory flyway.

According to Chapter II of the UN Charter, in order to be admitted to the UN, a country must first be recommended by the UN Security Council and then approved by vote of the UN General Assembly. In addition, the admission must not be opposed by any of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council (China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States), sometimes referred to as the Permanent Five or P5. Admission to membership in the UN is regarded as an important indicator of sovereignty and legitimate statehood, especially for microstates. Some states have governments that are unofficially recognized as independent, such as Taiwan, but have not been admitted to the UN due to a veto by a P5 member. During the Cold War, the United States and Soviet Union did not allow rival blocs to be admitted to the UN. When they began letting those countries join, it led to a period of great expansion of UN membership, especially as the number colonies gaining independence increased. Chapter II also provides for the suspension and expulsion of member states, and for the restoration of rights, by the UN General Assembly upon recommendation from the UN Security Council.

She was approximately four years old when she disappeared on January 18, 2001. DCF did not discover her disappearance until two years later, when she was not found living at the home of caretaker and alleged godmother or grandmother, Geralyn Graham. Rilya was placed into her care by DCF after Rilya's cocaine-abusing mother, Gloria Wilson, had her parental rights terminated. Despite varying accusations regarding Rilya's parentage and how she came to be in Graham's care, the true relationship between the two is unclear. Details involving disappearance The last recorded welfare check of Rilya was in early January 2001, by social worker Deborah Muskelly. Graham initially told investigators that on January 18, 2001, an unidentified African-American woman claiming to work for the Florida Department of Children and Families (DCF) took Rilya for an unspecified evaluation; this was the last time she supposedly saw Rilya. Despite this, Graham continued to cash checks from the state for Rilya's care. She further claimed that Muskelly was aware of Rilya's disappearance. Graham was later jailed for identity fraud and Medicaid fraud for accepting payments on behalf of Wilson after she was missing.\\"Missing girl's caretakers charged\\". CNN.com, August 19, 2004. Authorities denied that any state worker had ever taken Rilya for medical testing.\\"Former Caregiver Charged with Murdering Rilya Wilson\\" . WESH.com, March 17, 2005. They claimed to have first learned of Rilya's disappearance on April 25, 2002, the date she was officially reported missing. In March 2002, Muskelly and her supervisor resigned after allegations of fraud surfaced. Muskelly faced 41 criminal charges regarding her time with DCF, including grand theft. Muskelly pled guilty to one count of official misconduct, and was given five years' probation; the remaining charges were dropped. She never faced charges directly relating to Rilya's disappearance. Manville Cash, a man currently incarcerated for auto theft and drug charges, was listed as the girl's \\"prospective father\\" on documents terminating Gloria's parental rights. In early 2002, Cash told authorities he last saw Rilya at the home of Pamela Kendrick, Cash's aunt and sometimes mistakenly referred to as Graham's sister. Kendrick briefly had custody of Rilya in 2000 before she was removed amid allegations of neglect. In August 2004, Graham was charged with kidnapping and three counts of child abuse, and Kendrick with two lesser counts of child abuse. Kendrick testified against Graham at her trial, claiming that both of them had spanked Rilya with switches and had locked her in a dog cage and in the laundry room. Trial of supposed killer In March 2005, a grand jury indicted Graham after she allegedly gave a detailed confession to Rilya's murder. Graham had confessed to inmate Robin Lunceford, who testified at trial over four days. In her testimony, Lunceford revealed that Graham admitted to killing Rilya because the child was \\"evil\\" and was plagued by \\"demons\\" from previous abuse. Her body was supposedly buried in a ravine close by a place Graham regularly visited for fishing and cookouts. Two other inmates also testified that Graham, while behind bars, suggested she killed the child. Evidence of Rilya's abuse was presented at the trial, including the dog cage witnesses said Graham used to punish Rilya, and testimony about the girl's lengthy confinement in a small laundry room. Pamela Kendrick testified that Geralyn regularly tied Rilya to her bed using plastic restraints so she would not get up during the night. Graham alleged that a woman who claimed to work for DCF said she was removing Rilya from the home for evaluation and never returned. In January 2013, the jury convicted Graham of kidnapping and child abuse, but deadlocked 11-to-1 on the charge of murder. On February 12, the judge sentenced Graham to 30 years for kidnapping plus 25 years for aggravated child abuse. Two other abuse sentences‚Äî25 years and five years, respectively‚Äîwill be served concurrently for a total of 55 years behind bars. Prosecutors had sought the maximum of life plus 65 years. At 67 years old at the time of sentencing, Graham will end up serving a life sentence. The case led to the resignation of DCF director Kathleen Kearney and the passage of several reform laws, including a new missing-child-tracking system and the contracting out of foster child casework to private organizations. Lawmakers also made it illegal to falsify records of visits between caseworkers and foster children.

The obelisk belonged to Egyptian Pharaoh Psamtik II. History It was erected by the emperor Augustus, with the 30-meter Egyptian red granite Obelisk of Montecitorio, that he had brought from Heliopolis in ancient Egypt. The obelisk was employed as a gnomon that cast its shadow on a marble pavement inlaid with a gilded bronze network of lines, by which it was possible to read the time of day according to the season of the year. The solarium was dedicated to the Sun in 10 BCE, 35 years after Julius Caesar's calendar reform. It was the first solar dedication in Rome.Robert E. A.

The obelisk itself was set up to memorialize Augustus' subordination of Egypt to the control of the Roman empire.

The starling is remembered for the anecdote of how Mozart came to purchase it, for the funeral commemorations Mozart provided for it, and as an example of the composer's affection in general for birds. Purchase The first record of the starling is the entry Mozart made in his expense bookThe expense book was part of a new campaign of personal organization that Mozart undertook in February 1784; at the same time he began a catalog of every musical work he completed. The expense book was maintained only for a year, but the musical catalog was kept to his death in 1791 and usefully serves musical scholarship to this day. Source and further details: Abert (2004:727‚Äì728). when he bought it on 27 May 1784: :Starling bird 34 Kr. : \\\\relative a' { \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"recorder\\" \\\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\\\tempo 4 = 145 \\\\key g \\\\major \\\\time 2/2 \\\\partial 4 b8 c d4 d d \\\\tempo 4 = 45 g\\\\fermata \\\\tempo 4 = 145 fis fis gis gis a a a8 b c a b2 } :That was beautiful!Original German: \\"Vogel Stahrl 34 Kr. ... Das war sch√∂n!\\" ‚Äì Deutsch (1965) The music Mozart jotted down in the book is fairly close to the opening bars of the third movement of his Piano Concerto No. 17 in G, K. 453, which Mozart had completed a few weeks earlier (12 April). Presumably Mozart taught the bird to sing this tune in the pet store, or wherever it was that he bought it.For other theories of why the bird sang from Mozart's concerto, see chapter 6 of Haupt (2017). According to Mozart's transcription, the starling incorrectly inserted a fermata on the last beat of the first full measure, and sang G instead of G in the following measure. Correcting for those, the tune would have been: : \\\\relative a' { \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"recorder\\" \\\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\\\tempo 4 = 145 \\\\key g \\\\major \\\\time 2/2 \\\\partial 4 b8 c d4 d d g fis fis g g a a a8 b c a b2 } Heartz (2009:99‚Äì100) Mozart probably was not joking when he made the transcription, because starlings are known to have a very strong capacity for vocal mimicry.See and (in this encyclopedia) the article starling. To the ears of West and King, many elements of Mozart's A Musical Joke (1787) also \\"bear the vocal autograph of a starling\\".. They base this insight on the description of A Musical Joke in a record jacket note. Demise The bird Mozart brought home lived as a pet in his household for three years and died on 4 June 1787.Deutsch (1965:225). Mozart buried the creature in the garden with (as contemporary biographers observed) considerable ceremony. The notes taken by Georg Nikolaus von Nissen (the second husband of Mozart's wife Constanze) for purposes of writing his biography of the composer described the ceremonies thus: > When a bird died, he arranged a funeral procession, in which everyone who > could sing had to join in, heavily veiled ‚Äì made a sort of requiem, epitaph > in verse.Translation from Deutsch (1965:225). The same event is described by Franz Niemetschek, who had also interviewed Constanze: > He often wrote verse himself; mostly only of a humorous kind. [fn.:] This > was the case, among others, at the death of a much-loved starling, which he > had given a proper gravestone in his hired garden, and on which he had > written an inscription.

Mozart's funeral poem is translated by Robert Spaethling into vernacular English as follows. Hier ruht ein lieber Narr, Ein Vogel Staar. Noch in den besten Jahren Mu√üt er erfahren Des Todes bittern Schmerz. Mir blut't das Herz, Wenn ich daran gedenke. O Leser! schenke Auch du ein Thr√§nchen ihm. Er war nicht schlimm; Nur war er etwas munter, Doch auch mitunter Ein lieber loser Schalk, Und drum kein Dalk.\\"Dalk\\": Austrian for \\"ignorant, stupid, childish\\" Ich wett', er ist schon oben, Um mich zu loben F√ºr diesen Freundschaftsdienst Ohne Gewinnst. Denn wie er unvermuthet Sich hat verblutet, Dacht er nicht an den Mann, Der so sch√∂n reimen kann. ‚ÄîJune 4, 1787. Mozart Here rests a bird called Starling, A foolish little Darling. He was still in his prime When he ran out of time, And my sweet little friend Came to a bitter end, Creating a terrible smart Deep in my heart. Gentle Reader! Shed a tear, For he was dear, Sometimes a bit too jolly And, at times, quite folly, But nevermore A bore. I bet he is now up on high Praising my friendship to the sky, Which I render Without tender; For when he took his sudden leave, Which brought to me such grief, He was not thinking of the man Who writes and rhymes as no one can.Spaethling (2000:392‚Äì393) West and King note, based on their extensive experience, that starling pets interact closely with their human keepers, often causing their owners to bond with them. Thus, Mozart's expression of sorrow, though comic, is likely to have been quite sincere. Spaethling offers further background: > Mozart's poem on the death of his beloved pet bird ... is humorous, > bittersweet, and self-reflective at a time of great loss and grief. His > father had passed away, a close friend had died young, and he himself was > deeply involved with Don Giovanni, his darkest comedy.Spaethling (2000:392) Other birds There is evidence that the starling Mozart acquired in 1784 was hardly the only pet bird whose company he enjoyed. At age 14 Mozart wrote home from Naples to his sister Nannerl in Salzburg (19 May 1770) when he was on a journey with his father Leopold: > Write me, how is Mr. Canary? Does he still sing? Does he still pipe? Do you > know why I am thinking of the canary? Because there is one in our anteroom > that makes the same little sounds as ours.Quoted from Friedrich Kerst and > Henry Krehbiel (2016) Mozart: The Man and the Artist Revealed in His Own > Words. Reprint by Dover Publications. A later letter, written by Nannerl to her mother at home in Salzburg as she visited Munich in 1775 with Wolfgang and Leopold, indicates other birds in Mozart's childhood home: > Thank God we are quite well. I hope that Mamma too is very well. A propos, > are the canary, the tomtits, and the robin redbreast still alive, or have > they let the birds starve?Translation from Emily Anderson (2016) The Letters > of Mozart and his Family, new edition updated by Stanley Sadie and Fiona > Smart. Springer, p. 263. A sad tale from 1791 is told by Mozart's biographer Hermann Abert, concerning another canary that might been a successor to the starling, being in Mozart's family when the composer lay on his deathbed. > It was with great reluctance that he agreed to have his pet canary removed, > first to the adjacent room, then even further away, because he could no > longer bear the sound of its singing.Abert, Hermann (2016:1307) Notes References *Abert, Hermann (2016) W.

It is written and illustrated by Paul Pope. Characters *Baruch Wane, the Batman: By day, Baruch is a wealthy socialite/cubist painter and closeted Jew to the public. By night, he is the mysterious Batman, a foe to all criminals and unjust minds. *Robin: Baruch's female aide. In 1938, she was training to help Baruch fight crime. By 1998 she had written an unpublished series of memoirs. *Komissar Garten: The police komissar who had helped confiscate the works of Ludwig von Mises and has a \\"friendship\\" with Baruch Wane, unaware that he is both Jewish and the Batman. Plot summary In Berlin, Germany in the year 1938, wealthy socialite Baruch Wane learns from his friend Komissar Garten that the police have confiscated the library, works, and notes of Austrian economist Ludwig von Mises, due to his stance against the Nazi Party policy of Adolf Hitler and the Third Reich. Unbeknownst to Garten, Baruch is actually the mysterious Batman who has been terrorizing the wealthy members of the Nazi Party. Years ago, when Baruch was still a child, he watched his Jewish parents get beaten to death by an anti- semitic mob. From that point on, Baruch swore that he would avenge their deaths and spend the rest of his life on a war against all criminals and injustice. As he grew up, he developed his mind and his body, and upon inheriting his parents wealth and estate, he became inspired by a bat which flew into his home and decided to use this symbol as a means to frighten criminals. The following night of his visit with Garten, Baruch suits up and heads down to the trainyard in order to steal back Mises's works. He tries to stop the train, but when Garten's men surround him, he instead blows up the train so that way Mises's works and ideals do not fall into the wrong hands. The following is an excerpt from the unpublished memoirs of Baruch's assistant, Robin. \\"...Ludwig Von Mises escaped to the United States when the Nazis ransacked his apartment in 1938. It was his landlady, a friend of his mother's, who told the authorities Von Mises was working on a new book which challenged Nazi social and economic policies. They slowed him down, but they couldn't stop him. He continued work on a book which was eventually published in '49, called 'Human Action', now considered one of the great libertarian works of our times. Von Mises anti-authoritarian ideas were first a threat to the Nazis, then the Soviets, and to all increasingly regulatory governments in our own times. He was against socialism in all its many forms. He was an advocate of individual liberty, free speech, and free thinking... and so, should I add, the Berlin Batman. The Batman, as we all know, got better at what he does, and the legends of his exploits continued to grow to this day. Collected editions The Berlin Batman was republished alongside the Batman: Year 100 mini-series, also written and illustrated by Pope.

This list may have some overlap with list of jam band music festivals. Reggae festivals may include classic reggae and related or derivative genres such as ska, dancehall, dub, hip hop, ragga, reggae fusion, and drum and bass. Reggae originated in Jamaica in the late 1960s, influenced by Rastafarian culture, Jamaican dance music, traditional mento and calypso music, as well as American jazz and rhythm and blues, and evolved out of the earlier genres ska and rocksteady. By the 1970s, large festivals in Jamaica were being held featuring notable reggae bands, and the Wonder Dream Concert in 1975 in Jamaica was one of the first internationally noted festivals to focus on reggae. In 1979 Reggae Geel became the first reggae festival in Europe, and these concerts soon spread to other locales, becoming popular in regions such as Northern California. With the introduction of the electronic reggae genre ragga in the 1980s, reggae began to be featured at electronic music festivals as well.

Article 102 Article 102 bans secret treaties. Under this article, all international treaties must be registered with, and published by, the UN Secretariat. The article also states that secret treaties concluded in violation of this provision are unenforceable before UN bodies. Secret treaties were believed to have played a role in the events leading to World War I. Accordingly, U.S. President Woodrow Wilson had proposed banning them in the 1910s, and the League of Nations had created a special bureau of treaty registration under the League of Nations Secretary-General and had set aside a section of the League of Nations Journal for treaty publication.Will Insure End of Treaty Secrecy; League of Nations to Publish Them in Official Organ, Already Begun. Session Likely This Year Wilson Will Summon It, Following Coming Council Meeting at Rome, The New York Times, May 13, 1920. Article 18 of the Covenant of the League of Nations held that \\"Every treaty or international engagement entered into hereafter by any Member of the League shall be forthwith registered with the Secretariat and shall as soon as possible be published by it. No such treaty or international engagement shall be binding until so registered,\\" so Article 102 is basically a continuation of this policy. Article 103 Article 103 states that members' obligations under the UN Charter override their obligations under any other treaty. Thus, countries cannot use other treaties (such as the North Atlantic Treaty) to override their UN Charter obligations, a fact that has been used to question the legality of military actions conducted under regional treaty organization auspices, such as the 1999 NATO bombing of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.An Evil Little War, AntiWar.com. Similarly, the Greek Cypriot and Greek governments claimed that Turkish military intervention, although authorized under the 1960 Treaty of Guarantee to maintain the status quo in Cyprus (see Cyprus dispute), was banned by UN Charter's prohibitions against the use of force, which were supreme under Article 103.The Cyprus Question and the Turkish Position in International Law, Zaim M. Necatigil, 2nd ed., p. 127, 1993. Article 103 was also used by the UN Security Council, in passing Resolution 1696, to trump Iran's right to uranium enrichment under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.The Security Council on Iran: Fiddling While the Middle East Burns? , Daniel Joyner, JURIST, August 2, 2006. Article 103 is analogous to the League of Nations Covenant Article 20, which held that \\"The Members of the League severally agree that this Covenant is accepted as abrogating all obligations or understandings inter se which are inconsistent with the terms thereof, and solemnly undertake that they will not hereafter enter into any engagements inconsistent with the terms thereof.\\" The intent of both articles was to establish a \\"super-treaty\\" in much the same way that the supremacy clause of the United States Constitution establishes the Constitution as the supreme law of the land.

The project was cancelled in November 2009, after being refused approval by federal Environment Minister Peter Garrett. Planning The dam was proposed to stretch from the Traveston Crossing Bridge near Amamoor, 160 kilometres (99 miles) north of Brisbane, south and affect the areas surrounding Bergins Pocket and Kandanga. The dam would have affected major transport arteries through the area, including the North Coast Railway Line and the Bruce Highway. The planned damming of the Mary River was not a popular idea with local residents who would have been directly affected by its construction, nor for the wider national and international community concerned about the impact on the many endangered and vulnerable species living in the river. There was strong opposition to the dam from the wider and international community based on environmental concerns related to the endangered Mary River cod, Mary River turtle, giant barred frog, Cascade tree frog, Coxen's fig parrot, the vulnerable Queensland lungfish, tusked frog, honey blue-eye fish, the Richmond birdwing butterfly and the Illidge's ant blue butterfly. There were also fears for the dugong, a globally vulnerable species. It was alleged that reduced fresh water flows to the Great Sandy Strait would have affected the growth of seagrass, the Dugong's primary food source. The Mary River turtle and the Queensland lungfish attracted particular attention regarding their conservation. The turtle, whose only known home is the Mary River, is a cloacal ventilator ('bum breather' - it uses oxygen from water taken in through its tail), and is listed in the top 25 most endangered turtle species in the world. The Lungfish also has great significance to evolutionary biologists. It requires the rapids in order to breed, and much of its breeding habitat had already been interrupted by other dams in Queensland. Professor Jean Joss of Macquarie University stated, in a submission to the Senate Inquiry 2007: \\"The Mary River dam would almost certainly push the lungfish to 'Critically Endangered,' and in the long term will lead to its extinction in the wild.\\" The Mary River Cod, which only lives naturally in the Mary River system, is already Critically Endangered. It is completely protected, and it is illegal to fish them. Some believed that it was necessary to create more jobs in the area and to enhance South East Queensland's water security; however many others in the Gympie business community believed they would have their jobs destroyed, with many industries badly affected, particularly industries such as dairy farming. People in the farming industries in the area, who would have lost their farms with the construction of the dam, considered the area to be amongst the best food-producing land in Australia. Fishermen in the Tin Can Bay area relying on flows into the Great Sandy Straight were also concerned about the environmental impact of reduced flows to their area on the sustainability of their region and industry. Farmers downstream from the dam believed the dam would have had a devastating economic impact. Chairman of the Greater Mary Association, Darryl Stewart, stated: \\"Estimated annual economic downturn in the downstream communities could be around 500 million, especially affecting agriculture, fishing and tourism. And there would be serious social consequences. The downstream effects of this proposed dam will be far worse than the effects in the dam footprint.\\" The Mary River flows into the Great Sandy Strait, near wetlands of international significance recognised by the International agreement of the Ramsar Convention and Fraser Island World Heritage Area, which attracts thousands of visitors every year. Construction delays Other than road building, dam construction did not go ahead while Commonwealth approval was pending. Construction of the dam was delayed by four years. In 2007, the Federal Government of Australia held a Senate Inquiry on the issue. In November 2008 the Federal Senate passed a non-binding motion seeking to permanently stop the dam's construction.  Opposition to the dam  The proposed dam aroused opposition from many groups and organisations, from local farmers and fisherman to environmentalists and politicians (both nationally and internationally). Fraser Island Defenders Organisation, John Sinclair, stated, \\"The dramatic reduction and almost total blockage of environmental flow into this most significant estuary will heavily impact on these very sensitive aspects of marine ecology.\\" The Australian Conservation Foundation campaigned for the protection of species such as the Mary River Turtle, the Queensland Lungfish and the Mary River Cod. The Gubbi Gubbi Aboriginal people, whose land would have been affected by the dam, were offered an agreement by the Queensland government worth more than $1 million, which the Gubbi Gubbi people flatly refused. Regarding the Mary River Dam Dr Eve Fesl stated, ‚ÄúWe said we would have nothing to do with it. We‚Äôre not going to sign away our history, our culture, the Mary Valley. No way,‚Äù and, ‚ÄúThey couldn‚Äôt give a damn about the Mary River. They saw the dollar signs and they wet their pants,‚Äù she said. She also stated, \\"Our whole history and culture will be washed out if that dam is built. But not only that, a number of threatened species could be wiped out.‚Äù Greens Senator Bob Brown said, \\"the dam should be opposed because it would flood thousands of hectares of prime food-producing land near Brisbane, Aboriginal heritage sites and the main nursery for the world famous Australian Lungfish. I've told the minister there is no way he should allow the major breeding ground for the Queensland Lungfish or the Mary River Turtle, or Mary River Cod, to be obliterated.\\" \\"If the rest of Australia knew what damage was being proposed on the Mary River, they would stand up and stop this dreadful dam!\\" Sunshine Coast Government MPs and environmentalists \\"called on the State Government to scrap the Traveston Dam after it yesterday revealed plans for desalination plants at Marcoola, Kawana and Bribie Island.\\" Sunshine Coast Regional Council Mayor Bob Abbot \\"told thedaily.com.au the announcement confirmed what the Mary River council of mayors had been saying more than a year ago - that the Traveston Dam should be scrapped - and that alternatives such as desalination properly explored.\\" Fiona Simpson stated, \\"this strategy and the Water Commissioner‚Äôs comments left no doubt that the Traveston Dam was a political decision and desalination was a better and more reliable option.\\" A University of Technology, Sydney report stated that \\"the proposed Traveston Dam near Gympie could pump up to 400,000 tonnes of greenhouse emissions into the atmosphere each year\\" and ‚Äúeven desalination, itself a last resort in a severe drought, would result in fewer emissions at 280,000 to 350,000 (annual tonnes) to yield the same quantity of water\\". According to the Australian Conservation Foundation, \\"Eighty five per cent of Brisbane residents agree 'the Queensland Government should consider alternatives to building Traveston Dam' according to a poll released by the Australian Conservation Foundation\\". The independent expert Associate Professor Keith Walker says that the mitigation and offset strategies such as the Freshwater Species Conservation Centre were inadequate, risky and ill-defined and that the proposed fish and turtle ladders were unproven. \\"Don't Murray the Mary\\" Environmental campaigner Steve Posselt, who protested the dam by kayaking 861 kilometres (535 miles) to raise awareness of the environmental impact of damming the Mary River, stated that \\"Traveston Crossing Dam will be less than 2m deep over a great percentage of its area. Evaporation is somewhere between per annum. Wivenhoe Dam is not a deep dam and suffers similarly from significant greenhouse gas generation. The longer the water level is low between fills, the more vegetation regeneration occurs. There is no escaping the fact that on an average annual basis large volumes of methane are produced when this vegetation rots. Methane is more than twenty times more powerful as a greenhouse gas than CO2(Carbon dioxide).\\" The Great Sandy Strait depends on the Mary River to sustain its complex ecosystem. Fraser Island is the largest sand island in the world and is also of huge significance to Aboriginal Australian history. The Great Sandy Strait lies between the western fringes of World Heritage Listed Fraser Island and the south-east Queensland coast. Most of its eastern side is within the World Heritage Area and its beauty and unique ecology attract thousands of tourists annually. It is listed under the Ramsar Convention as a Wetland of International Significance and is also one of Australia‚Äôs most important nesting sites for migratory trans-equatorial shorebirds.

It originally aired on October 1, 2007.  Plot  Lily and Marshall explain they are writing their 'death folders' containing useful information should either of them die and a letter to one another, but Marshall tells Ted and Barney that he forgot to write his letter. Ted and Barney play on Marshall's superstitious nature by insisting he will not die before writing it, forcing Marshall to knock on wood, throw salt over his left shoulder, and spin around three times, before leaving. Future Ted narrates that Robin needed time away following their break-up and we see her on vacation with Gael, saying she felt up-tight in New York. Back in the bar she claims to be a different person, but Barney says Robin is still the same, adding that she will realize this and dump Gael soon. When Gael joins them, the gang use formal language in order to continue their conversation without letting on, which makes Gael ask if they are talking about baseball. Marshall writes his letter to Lily, pouring his heart (and tears) out over many pages. Once finished, he decides to read Lily's letter to him and is angry to discover it is not as heart-felt as his (it contains information on her teacher's pension and a reminder to cancel Vogue.) At the bar, Gael is surrounded by women while Ted and Barney lament how easy it is for Gael to get girls simply by being from out of town. This gives them the idea to pose as tourists outside MacLaren's and they strike up a conversation with two passing girls. The girls agree to show the guys around the following day and Barney suggests they meet up outside MacLaren's but the girls think it's a lame bar. Ted tries to defend his favourite watering hole, without revealing he is a New Yorker. Inside, Lily asks Robin how things are going with Gael and Robin reveals she has become annoyed doing things at home that she loved on holiday, such as being hand-fed her food by Gael (dropping spaghetti on her sofa) and him sweeping the table clear to make love to her (breaking her laptop). Robin says she won't complain and go with the flow. However, when she is in the shower later, someone uses her toilet and, initially thinking it is Gael, she is shocked to discover it is actually a strange Australian backpacker (Damon Gameau). Robin goes to speak to Gael, but discovers he has invited the backpacker and his friends to stay with them indefinitely. Marshall starts an argument with Lily over her loveless letter. They exchange a quick hug after Lily mentions this is their first fight as a married couple before Marshall continues to storm out. The girls (Colleen and Lindsay) take Ted and Barney to a potato restaurant. When the girls go to the bathroom, Ted says they have met the \\"two lamest New Yorkers of all time\\", but Barney convinces Ted to continue with the plan and the girls decide to take Ted and Barney to a friend's party. Robin reveals she ate a marijuana-laced Blueberry muffin that one of the backpackers had baked, causing her to say some inappropriate things on the air. She tries to lay some ground-rules but the group is watching the television and so Robin decides to lie down as she is still \\"pretty baked\\". Ted, Barney, Colleen and Lindsay are in a cab on their way to the party. Ted questions where they are going and is terrified to learn they are heading for the South Bronx. His fears are confirmed as they end up giving descriptions to the police of three guys who have apparently mugged them. Marshall quizzes Lily over why she couldn't write a love letter like he did and Lily states it is because she cannot bear to think about not being with him, and that he would just open the letter and read it as soon as she has finished writing anyway. Marshall promises he won't, so Lily agrees to write her letter, but Marshall asks her to make the letter \\"dirty\\" and slip in some Polaroids. Back on the street, Ted and Barney are invited back to the girls' place but Ted finally snaps when he finds out the girls are actually from New Jersey. Ted chastises the girls about not being from New York and derides New Jersey due to his deep seated hatred for the state. He tells them to go home, which they do getting a lift from the cops. Ted and Barney try to get the same courtesy but the police officer refuses by stating he is from \\"Newark, born and raised\\". Robin is woken by the sound of bongo drums and confronts 'vacation Robin' in the living room who tells her that she has lost her way since coming home. Robin retorts by saying that her vacation self is boring, lame, and getting sand everywhere. As the two are about to kiss, Robin is really woken by drums and finds the group of travellers playing in the living room. She finally gets rid of them by brandishing her gun but the shouting wakes Gael and Robin tells him they have to break up. Barney toasts the return of the real Robin while she mentions that 'vacation Robin' popped up in her dreams again and that \\"that chick knows what I like\\". Lily finishes her letter and makes Marshall swear not to read it until she is dead. Older Ted narrates that he kept his promise until November 2029 when an older, balding Marshall opens the letter (implying that Lily has died) to find Lily's words telling him he is busted. Marshall calls Lily, older and very much alive, into his office and they argue. Marshall says Lily also broke her promise as there are no naked pictures in the envelope for him; Lily says she will take some photos ‚Äì but Marshall doesn't want them anymore, which offends Lily and sparks an argument.

Biography Paul Gilson was born in Brussels. In 1866, his family moved to Ruisbroek in the Belgian province of Brabant. There he studied theory with the organist and choir director Auguste Cantillon, and began writing works for orchestra and choir. His first official training came from 1887‚Äì1889 under Fran√ßois-Auguste Gevaert in composition and under Charles Duyck in harmony and counterpoint at the Brussels Conservatory, and in 1889, he was awarded the Belgian Prix de Rome for a cantata, Sina√Ø, which was very well received. As the winner of the prize he was able to spend time in Bayreuth (1892), Paris (1893‚Äì4) and Italy (1895). A large orchestral work, La mer, which was first performed in Brussels on 20 March 1892, established Gilson as a national musical figure and also gave him success abroad, though not in Paris. In 1899 he became professor of composition at the Brussels Conservatory; he won the same post at Antwerp in 1904 but quit both after becoming inspector of music education in 1909, a post he would keep until 1930. Although he was a very prolific composer, his output decreased after 1905, after which Gilson wrote increasingly about music, in theory, criticism, and composition. In 1925, a group of Gilson's students who called themselves Les Synth√©tistes (including Ren√© Bernier, Francis de Bourguignon, Th√©o De Joncker, Marcel Poot, Maurice Schoemaker, Jules Strens and Robert Otlet) first formed, declaring allegiance to Gilson's ideas about music. Along with Poot and Schoemaker, he founded La revue belge musicale in 1924; he was the chief editor until it folded in 1939. He also wrote pamphlets for Belgian radio. Gilson corresponded regularly with Russian composers C√©sar Cui and Mitrofan Belyayev. He died in his native city of Brussels.  Honours  * 1932 : commander in the Order of Leopold.Royal order of 15.9.1934 Music Gilson was somewhat conservative in his musical outlook. Some of his work is indebted to Wagnerian harmony, and his books on harmony and instrumentation also bear this out. La Mer, the score which gave him his greatest success, is a set of four impressionistic movements (\\"symphonic sketches\\") in sonata form which were originally intended to illustrate verses by a French-speaking poet, Eddy Levis. Generally considered to form a programmatic symphony depicting the sea, Gilson's score (also known as De Zee) predated Claude Debussy's work of the same name by a decade. Despite being finely crafted, his later works such as the oratorio Francesca da Rimini tended to be somewhat conventional, lacking the originality displayed in the orchestration of La Mer. An exception is the brilliant Variations symphoniques (originally scored for brass ensemble), which is also the composer's only major work without literary associations.

Flanker is a position in the sport of rugby union. Each team of 15 players includes two flankers, who play in the forwards, and are generally classified as either blindside or openside flankers, numbers 6 and 7 respectively. The name comes from their position in a scrum in which they 'flank' each set of forwards. They compete for the ball ‚Äì most commonly in rucks and mauls. Flankers also assist in pushing in a scrum, but are expected to detach from the scrum as soon as the ball is out to get to the play before the opposition's forwards. Flankers also participate in line-outs, either being lifted to contest or win possession, or to lift other players. Flankers are usually the key participants in the tackling process. The flankers, especially the openside, are often the fastest forwards on the team but still relied upon for tackling.  Naming  Flankers can be known by several different names. Historically, they were often called wing-forwards, although this name had a more specific meaning in New Zealand when they used a now-archaic scrum formation.Before it was outlawed in the 1930s, New Zealand used a 2‚Äì3‚Äì2 scrum formation that used seven forwards and not eight. The wing- forward did not participate in the scrum and would feed the ball in the scrum instead of the half-back. This term is rarely used any more, but the terms breakaway, flank, and flank forward are sometimes used. Collectively, the flankers and the number eight can also be known as the back-row forwards ‚Äì referring to their scrum positions ‚Äì or as loose forwards because they are loosely bound to the scrum.  Role  Flankers are the position where the player should have all-round attributes: speed, strength, fitness, tackling and handling skills. Flankers are always involved in the game, as they are the players most commonly involved in winning the ball in open play, especially the openside flanker. Blindside flankers tend to be bigger, but not as fast as their partners on the openside. In open play, flankers will often stand behind the backs, supporting them. If any ball is dropped by the backs, the flankers' job is to clear up messy ball and start a new phase of play. Because they are always close to the ball, they are often first to the breakdown. Flankers do less pushing in the scrum than the tight five, but need to be fast as their task is to break quickly and cover the opposing half-backs if the opponents win the scrum. At one time, flankers were allowed to break away from the scrum with the ball but this is no longer allowed and they must remain bound to the scrum until the ball is out. Flankers also have to defend at the back of the scrum if the opposition wins the ball and the opposing number 8 decides to pick and go (i.e. pick up the ball from the back of the scrum and drive forward with it). New Zealand openside flanker Richie McCaw, who was nominated for World Rugby Player of the Year a record eight times from 2002 to 2012, described three key roles for the flanker: > * \\"My main role as a flanker is, defensively, to tie in with the back line > to ensure that the defence works well. * On attack I think my primary role > at first phase is to look after our ball. You attack the back line and I'm > usually the first person there to make sure we secure that ball. * Thirdly I > put pressure on break downs and make sure I disturb their ball and try to > turn their ball over.\\" =Openside and blindside= New Zealand blindside flanker Reuben Thorne detaches from a scrum to tackle England's Shaun Perry. The two flankers do not usually bind to the scrum in a fixed position. Instead, the openside (occasionally known as the strong side) flanker attaches to the scrum on whichever side is further from the nearer touchline, while the blind-side (occasionally known as weak side or closed side) flanker attaches himself/herself to the scrum on the side closer to the touchline. Since most of the back play is usually on the open side, where there is more space, it is usually the openside flanker's job to be the first to any breakdown of play and to get his/her hands on any loose ball (or to cause a breakdown by tackling the ball carrier or otherwise hurrying him into error). At a scrum where the ball has been won by the opposition, the openside flanker often has the best view of when the ball is out and is able to break away and close down the opposing ball-carrier, reducing the time available for a pass or kick. Openside flankers are often smaller and quicker than their blindside counterparts. The blindside flanker has the job of stopping any move by the opponents on the blind (or 'narrow') side from a scrum. Blindside flankers are often responsible for cover defence from set pieces and may play a more physical role at the line-out, where they may well be used as a jumper. They can also be used for breaking their opposition line in open play using their speed and strength to break tackles. Most countries prefer a quicker openside flanker with the ability to get off the scrum quickly so that he can scavenge for the ball. In South Africa, however, it is preferred for the blindside flanker to be quicker as it is often their duty to carry the ball, meaning they prefer the person running with the ball being quicker rather than the person trying steal it. Flankers are not always assigned specific roles as opensides and blindsides. For example, Scotland flankers Finlay Calder and John Jeffrey played left and right, rather than open and blind. French teams tend not to make a distinction between the two roles, and their flankers also usually play left and right rather than open and blind: thus, Serge Betsen often wore the number 6 but would pack down on either the open or blind sides of the scrum, and will often harass the opposition fly-half in the manner of an openside; like Calder and Jeffrey for Scotland, Betsen and Olivier Magne formed an outstanding left-right partnership for France.

Some of their releases could be classified as progressive rock or art rock, experimental music, industrial, ambient, or new age. No new releases appeared after 1998. History Sky Records was founded in 1975 by G√ºnter K√∂rber after he left Metronome Musik, the parent company of influential krautrock/Kosmische label Brain Records. K√∂rber was able to sign several former Brain Records recording artists to his new label, most notably Cluster just as they began a successful collaboration with Brian Eno. The success of the albums Cluster & Eno in 1977 and After the Heat in 1978 helped put Sky on a solid financial footing. Other former Brain artists signing with Sky included Thirsty Moon and Michael Rother shortly after his departure from Neu! and Harmonia. Along with several subsequent Cluster albums, group members Dieter Moebius and Hans-Joachim Roedelius also released several solo albums and collaborations on Sky. Other notable artists who recorded for the label include Conrad Schnitzler, Asmus Tietchens, Harald Grosskopf, Adelbert von Deyen, Nik Tyndall, Earthstar, Serge Blenner, Insane Jane, and Dieter Sch√ºtz. The 1990s mainly saw reissues of earlier albums from the catalog on CD. The label was dissolved in 1997. G√ºnter K√∂rber died in 2013.

The music is mainly instrumental, with a classical, symphonic, and at times tribal Celtic sound. The music is interspersed with brief narrations and sound effects that relate a tale of high fantasy. The overall theme is laden with elements popularized in sword and sorcery stories and games, such as wizards, warriors, dragons, elves, witches, dwarves and trolls. These and other dark fantasy archetypes are represented visually in the artwork that accompanies the disc, and are also strongly suggested by the musical compositions.Album summary from Kitley's Krypt The instrumentation includes heavy-sounding drums, gong, bagpipe, harp, acoustic guitar and fiddle, and features appropriate sound effects such as war horns, deeply reverberating chants, swords clashing, chainmail clanking and the war cries and stamping feet of what sounds like thousands of men heading into battle. The album begins and ends with some brief narration in the manner of furthering the story. Nox Arcana took their concepts of musical storytelling even further with Blood of the Dragon by incorporating an actual quest into their music and CD packaging.

The film was released on 11 January 2001 alongside Daggubati Venkatesh's Devi Putrudu and Chiranjeevi's Mrugaraju. Plot There are two neighboring villages in Rayalaseema. Goons head one village, and Raghupati Naidu (K. Viswanath) heads the other. As Raghupati Naidu is peace-loving, his village is dogged by the misdeeds of goons from the neighboring village. In order to save the future of his village, Raghupati Naidu asks one male kid from each family to be given for the purpose of saving the village. Raghupati Naidu selected his fourth son Narasimha Naidu as his family's contribution towards the security of the village. All these kids will be trained and prepared to protect the village. After 15 years, enters Anjali (Preeti Jhangiani). She is the niece of Jaya Prakash Reddy, who happens to be from the goons' village. He later settled in another village. Narasimha Naidu sets up a Naatya ashram to teach classical dance to the students. Anjali falls in love with Narasimha Naidu at first sight. She joins him as a student and tries to make him fall in love with her. Later on, she comes to know that Narasimha Naidu is already married and has a child who is growing in up the ashram. Narasimha Naidu is a widower as his wife Sravani (Simran) is no more. Anjali tries to get closer to the kid so that she can marry Narasimha Naidu. Anjali's parents fix up the marriage of Anjali with one of their relatives. When Anjali's uncle comes to know that she is in love with a widowed dance master, he attacks him and threatens him that he would kill the kid. When they find Anjali missing, the entire battalion of goons invades the ashram of the dance master, only to find that he fled. Narasimha Naidu, after coming to know that goons were coming to attack him, vacates the ashram and boards a train. At the same time, Anjali too boards the train, though Narasimha Naidu rejects it. Then a fleet of 16 white Sumos containing goons chase the train using a parallel road. They overtake the train and stop it forcibly at a station. Then, around 100 armed goons surround the train and vie for Narasimha Naidu's blood. After a couple of minutes, Narasimha Naidu gets down the train, shows his back to them, and then turns around. The moment the goons realize that the dance master is none other than Narasimha Naidu, they leave all their arms and run away to save their dear lives. Then Narasimha Naidu tells his past to Anjali. Raghupati Naidu realizes that no parents in the village are willing to marry off their daughter to Narasimha Naidu since he is meant for sacrificing for the village's safety. At that point of time, Raghupati Naidu selects a beautiful girl called Sravani for his son. But Sravani is too sensitive and hates anything to do with violence. Hence, Raghupati Naidu asks Narasimha Naidu to act as a soft guy who has the liking for classical dance. After marriage, Sravani realizes the fact and decides to live with it. Narasimha Naidu's three elder brothers arrive along with their families. Narasimha Naidu has a lot of love and adulation for his brothers, though they treat him very badly, which Narasimha Naidu takes in a good sense. After a few days, Sravani blasts at the guys who are mocking Narasimha Naidu. Then they complain about Sravani to Narasimha Naidu. Being upset about this, Narasimha Naidu sends Sravani to her parents' place. At her parents' place, Sravani gives birth to a kid. Narasimha Naidu's brothers are still upset with the insult that is made to them by Sravani and decides to leave back to the USA. They arrange for the police security and they refuse for Narasimha Naidu to accompany them. During this period, the goons plan to kill Narasimha Naidu's brothers, wife, and son. Then, Narasimha Naidu arrives at the railway station and saves his brother's family. His wife manages to save her son, but in the process, she is killed. In the present, Narasimha Naidu beats all the goons and marries Anjali.

It is located in the commune of Lumigny-Nesles-Ormeaux in Seine-et-Marne, about southeast of Paris. The park covers an area of . Of the 41 recognized species of felines in the world, the park has 30 different species and subspecies, with a total of 140 cats. The park opened to the public on October 14, 2006. Originally, the majority of the animals came from the Parc d'Aulneau, which was deemed too small to house this many animals. History *1998: The Parc d'Aulneau opens. *2005: The Parc d'Aulneau becomes too small and a new place is sought. *2006: The location of the park is chosen at the height of Fortelle at Nesles in Seine- et-Marne. *2007: The park accommodates a wildcat, two leopard cats, two sand cats, a Siberian tiger, two margays, two oncillas and two rusty-spotted cats. Visiting the park A cheetah at the park The park's philosophy is to provide for the well-being of the animals, and to provide an environment conducive to their reproduction. The enclosures were studied in depth to ensure the optimal environmental conditions of each animal. The park is divided into four geographic areas. Each animal's area is accompanied by an illustrated board with the name and description of the animal, the specifics of the animal's enclosure, and the dangers to the animal in its natural environment. =European circuit= The European circuit begins at the enclosure of the cheetahs. There are only two enclosures in this circuit, located in the woods, and they are occupied by wildcats (Felis silvestris silvestris) and Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx lynx). =African circuit= Map of the park At the start of the visit one begins with the Southern African cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus jubatus) which have an enclosure roomy enough for them to run. At the end of the cheetah enclosure, the European circuit begins to the left. By going straight on the African circuit and travel along the enclosure of the African lions (Panthera leo melanochaita). At the end of the enclosure one can either turn and start the Asian circuit to the right or start the American circuit to the left. The African circuit continues to the left and the first enclosure is occupied by servals (Leptailurus serval). On both sides of the way we first see the sand cats (Felis margarita), then the African wildcats (Felis lybica gordoni) and the Persian leopards (Panthera pardus tulliana), and finally the caracals (Caracal caracal). The circuit concludes with the white lions (Panthera leo melanochaita), a rarity in zoos, followed by the black panthers (Panthera pardus) and finally the lion (Panthera leo). Soon the park will have black-footed cats (Felis nigripes) - their enclosures are currently ready and are holding the fishing cats. =American circuit= One of three jaguarundi The American circuit starts at the end of the Katanga lion enclosure. The first habitat of this circuit holds the ocelots (Leopardus pardalis), and next to it is the jaguar (Panthera onca) enclosure. The path continues past the enclosures of the margays (Leopardus wiedi), Geoffroy's cats (Oncifelis geoffroyi), the oncillas (Leopardus tigrinus), and the pumas (Puma concolor). Finally one arrives at a dead end, to admire the jaguarundis (Herpailurus yaguarondi) which are very rare in European zoos. The path ends with the enclosures of the bobcats (Lynx rufus) and the jaguars. =Asian circuit= A leopard cat (P. b. euptailurus) from eastern Siberia The Asian circuit starts at the other end of the Katanga lion enclosure. The first felines on this path are the Sumatran tigers (Panthera tigris sumatrae), followed by the enclosure of the rusty-spotted cats. Further on is the rare Sri Lanka leopard (Panthera pardus kotiya), the Asian golden cats (Catopuma temmincki), the Asian leopard cats (Prionailurus bengalensis bengalensis), the jungle cats (Felis chaus), and the fishing cats (Prionailurus viverrinus). The path continues with large enclosures containing tigers (Panthera tigris, particularly Siberian tigers), Amur leopards (Panthera pardus orientalis) and Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx wrangeli). The path ends with the eastern Siberian and Mongolian leopard cats (Prionailurus bengalensis euptilura), clouded leopards (Neofelis nebulosa), snow leopards (Panthera uncia) and Pallas's cats (Otocolobus manul). =Lemurs= Lemurs gathered in the park In addition to the felids, there is a large lemur population in the park. Many lemur species are represented, including the ring-tailed lemur (Lemur catta), the red ruffed lemur (Varecia rubra), the crowned lemur (Eulemur coronatus), and the red-bellied lemur (Eulemur rubriventer). Many of the lemurs roam freely about the park, and occasionally interact with visitors.

Railway platform height is the built height ‚Äì above top of rail (ATR) ‚Äì of passenger platforms at stations. A connected term is train floor height, which refers to the ATR height of the floor of rail vehicles. Worldwide, there are many, frequently incompatible, standards for platform heights and train floor heights. Where raised platforms are in use, train widths must also be compatible, in order to avoid both large gaps between platform and trains and mechanical interference liable to cause equipment damage. Differences in platform height (and platform gap) can pose a risk for passenger safety. Platform ramps, steps, and platform gap fillers together with hazard warnings such as \\"mind the gap\\" are used to reduce risk and facilitate access. Platform height affects the loading gauge (the maximum size of train cars), and must conform to the structure gauge physical clearance specifications for the system. Tracks which are shared between freight and passenger service must have platforms which do not obstruct either type of railroad car. To reduce construction costs, the platforms at stations on many railway systems are of low height, making it necessary for passenger cars to be equipped with external steps or internal stairs allowing passengers access to and from car floor levels. When railways were first introduced in the 19th century, low platforms were widely used since 1880s, especially in rural areas, except in the United Kingdom. Over the years, once obsolete raised platforms have become far more widespread, and are almost universal for high-speed express routes and universal in cities on commuter and rapid transit lines. Raised platforms on the narrow gauge railways can prevent track gauge conversion to standard gauge or broad gauge.

Africa =Algeria= Typical Algerian platforms are above rail. =Kenya= The SGR platforms are two standard heights of and above rail heads. The meter gauge platforms are 1100mm. Asia =Afghanistan= Afghan platforms will be above rail for Russian gauge and Indian gauge railways, and above rail for standard gauge railways. =China= A Platform at Haining railway station consists of both \\"low\\" and \\"high platform\\". China Railway platforms are classified into the following categories of \\"low\\" , \\"medium\\" , \\"high\\" and \\"ultra high\\" (latter 2 for most new and rebuilt platforms). Areas adjacent to broad gauge countries/regions, such as Xinjiang and Inner-Mongolia, are still equipped with low platforms. Under the concession period since late 2016, platforms on the southeastern corridor from Shenzhen to Ruili to be ATR, whereas the northern-, central-, and western-Chinese platforms to be ATR, are recommended. Most CRH platforms are above top of rail, with the remainders being . The proposed Russian gauge Rail North China platforms will be above rails. =Hong Kong= MTR network Platforms on the MTR are above the rail for the Tung Chung Line and Airport Express, collectively known as the Airport Railway.Redevelopment of Kowloon Station, 1995, HKU Scholars Hub The height of those on other lines (excluding Kowloon Southern Link and Shatin to Central Link) built by MTR is . Pre-KCR network East Rail Line platforms are high.Under the Wires to Lo Wu, The Railway Magazine, November 1983 Since all the former KCR lines excluding light rail are built to the same specs, the platform height on the West Rail Line, Ma On Shan Line, as well as the MTR-built Kowloon Southern Link and Sha Tin to Central Link is also 3 feet 6 inches (1066.8 mm) high. XRL network Platforms at Hong Kong West Kowloon railway station are above the rail, to adopt the standard of High- speed rail in China. =India= There are two standard heights of the platforms, and above rail heads. =Iran= Iranian platforms are , and . Like in China, areas adjacent to broad gauge countries/regions such as the eastern regions such as around Mashhad and Zahedan, still equipped low platforms. =Japan= The Japanese National Railways (JNR) for many years used a triple- standard for its conventional (Cape gauge) lines: * for long-distance trains (originally step-fitted passenger cars pulled by steam engines); * for commuter trains (step-less electric multiple units at a time when long- distance trains were not); and * shared platforms that could serve both with relatively little discomfort (roughly level with the step on passenger carriages but not too low to board commuter trains). However, increasing electrification and the phasing-out of locomotive traction in favor of multiple units has made the distinction a matter of historical, rather than practical relevance. Recently, at Japan Railways Group stations in urban centers such as Tokyo and Osaka, whose lines were the earliest to be electrified, is the norm and lower-level platforms are generally raised to this height during station improvements or refurbishment. Elsewhere, such as Hokkaido and the Tohoku/Hokuriku region of Honshu, ‚Äì and even platforms are still commonplace. As this represents a potential obstacle when boarding modern commuter trains, workarounds such as a step built into the floor of area-specific trainsets are often employed. Nevertheless, with accessibility becoming a greater concern as Japan's population ages, raising the level of the platform itself (in tandem with other improvements such as elevators and escalators) is seen as the most practical solution. In at least one case, with the E721 series EMU used on JR East lines in the Tohoku region, the floor of the train itself is lowered to be nearly level to existing platforms. This makes level boarding feasible at many stations (and boarding less of a hassle at stations with the lowest platforms). However, this (along with a different standard of electrification) also makes through service southward to Tokyo impossible, and prevents them from running on certain through lines, such as the Senseki-Tohoku Line, since the Senseki Line portion uses the higher platforms (and DC electrification). In contrast to the above standards, the standard gauge Shinkansen (Bullet Train) has, since its original inception, used only platforms. However, exceptions from this include the \\"Mini- Shinkansen\\" Yamagata Shinkansen and Akita Shinkansen lines, which use platforms to maintain compatibility with conventional JR trainsets. Most standard gauge non-JR commuter railways, such as Kintetsu Nara Line and Keisei Line, use platforms. =North Korea= North Korean platforms are standardized at only. In there, is the norm, lower-level platforms are already raised to this height. =South Korea= Korail adopted high platforms to operate KTX. Typically, older platforms are lower than 500 mm. For metro trains, higher platforms which height after are used. Nuriro trains are using mechanical steps to allow both type of platforms. Korail has a long-term plan to change platform standards to higher platforms; both EMU-250 and EMU-300 are designed to use higher platforms. = Taiwan = Taiwan high-speed rail platforms are above rail. Example of a platform whose height was raised. Initially, Taiwan Railways Administration platforms were tall and passengers must take two stair steps to enter the train. In 2001, the platforms were raised to , cutting the steps needed to one. Between 2016 and 2020, platforms were again raised to , and the unnecessary gap on trains were filled in. = Thailand = Old railway platforms are usually less than 500mm (20in) in height. New platforms along double tracking projects, red line projects, and metro stations are built at 1100mm height. Eurasia =Russia= There are two standard heights of platforms in Russia; they are above rail heads. high platforms are gradually changing to platform height. platforms are used primarily on lines with either small passenger flow or using double-decker trains. In late 2015, there are three standard heights of platforms, which include: * for long-distance trains (originally locomotive-hauled step-fitted passenger carriages); * for direct- current only commuter trains (step-less direct current commuter electric multiple units at a time when long-distance trains were not); and * for shared platforms that could serve both with relatively little discomfort (roughly level with the steps on passenger carriages but not too low to board commuter trains). In some urban areas, such as Moscow and St Petersburg, served only by local traffic, use platforms for direct-current electric multiple units. Elsewhere, - and even platforms are almost commonplace. In some cases, such as VR Sm4 of Finland, the floor of the train itself lowered to be nearly level to platforms. This makes level boarding feasible at some stations (and boarding less of a hassle at stations with the lowest platforms). The proposed Indian gauge Indo-Siberian railways platforms will be above rails. =Turkey= In Turkey, the standard platform height for commuter railways is and for mainline & high-speed railways it's . But most of the platforms throughout the network are old and thus out of standard. =Kazakhstan= In Kazakhstan, only Astana Nurly Jol station and Russian Railway's Petropavlovsk station have platforms. Almost everywhere else, the platforms are above the rails. Europe =Multi-country= European Union Application of the EU standard heights for new construction; Green = 550 mm, Blue = 760 mm, Turquoise = both, dark gray = New builds in other heights than the EU standards The European Union Commission issued a TSI (Technical Specifications for Interoperability) on 30 May 2002 (2002/735/EC) that sets out standard platform heights for passenger steps on high-speed rail. These standard heights are .2002/735/EC, sections 7.3.4 and 4.2.5 The for most member states, for Great Britain / Netherlands / Spain / Portugal, and for Ireland / Northern Ireland. Broad- gauge railways The proposed (Russian gauge) railways (e.g. Arctic Railway and Kosice-Vienna broad gauge line) and the proposed (Brunel gauge) railways will be for Sweden and Norway, and for Poland and Slovakia, and for Germany and Austria. Channel Tunnel Platforms for Eurotunnel Shuttle are above rails. Rail Baltica The European standard gauge Rail Baltica II platforms will be above rails. =Belgium= Belgium has been using mixed type of platform heights (due to the age of the network, and the different companies running it before 1923). As of 2017 the most common platform heights for small stop places and stations are low platform heights of . There is nevertheless a plan to comply with the European TSI by raising all low platform heights to one of the European Standard Heights. Most stations will by then be equipped with platforms, and direct current EMUs dedicated platforms will be upgraded in their final version to . Some stations, or stopping points, already having platform heights will keep the platforms at these heights. =Finland= In Finland, the current standard platform height is . A minority of stations still have platforms built to the older standard. =Germany= Triple gauntlet track at Kaufungen, Germany. Wider mainline trains go down the centre; narrower trams switch either to the left, or right, to be closer to the relevant platform. Beyond the station, the rails return to single track. Germany's EBO standard (Ordinance on the Construction and Operation of Railways) specifies an allowable range of to maximal . This would not include light rail systems that follow the BOStrab standard (Ordinance on the Construction and Operation of Tramways) with newer metro lines to use low- floor trams which have a usual floor height of so that platforms are constructed as low as 300 mm in accordance with BOStrab that requires the platform height not to be higher than the floor height.BOStrab ¬ß 31 (1) \\"Haltestellen sollen Bahnsteige besitzen (...).\\"; ¬ß 31 (8) \\"Die Bahnsteigoberfl√§che soll nicht h√∂her liegen als der Fahrzeugfu√üboden in seiner tiefsten Lage (...).\\" The traditional platforms had a very diverse height as the nationwide railway network is a union of earlier railway operators. Prior to followed by the European TSI standard the EBO standard requires that new platform construction be at a regular height of . The TSI standard of height, historically common in the East, is widely used on regional lines. Only the S-Bahn suburban rail systems had a higher platform height and these are standardized on . =Ireland= While older platforms on the Dublin and Kingstown Railway were at lower levels, all platforms are now 915mm above rail and all new platforms are being built at that level. Amongst other work, there is an ongoing program of platform renewal. Both Irish railway companies (Irish Rail in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland Railways in Northern Ireland) have had some derogations from EU standards as their mainline rail systems, while connected to each other, are not connected to any other system. The electric DART fleet has carriage floors at above top of rail creating a step of , while the diesel fleet is typically one step () higher than the platform. On Dublin's Luas tram system, platforms are approximately above rail. Tram floors are at the same height, but have internal steps over the bogies. =Luxembourg= The platforms for the Namur-Luxembourg line (with 3kV DC electrification). The remainder of the network, the platforms are above rails. =Netherlands= European Commission decision 2002/735/EC which concerns trans-European interoperability for high-speed rail specifies that rolling stock be built for operational suitability platform height of . Dutch infrastructure maintainer ProRail has committed to upgrading all stations to platform height. =Poland= Typical Polish platform is high. In some urban/suburban areas (e.g. around Warsaw) platforms used by local traffic are lower or higher (). All newly built platforms are 760 mm (29.9 in) high. =Spain= While older Spanish platforms are lower than the rest of Europe, many platforms are now above rail. Following track gauge conversion from Iberian gauge to standard gauge, platforms to be raised to for new regional trainsets. =Sweden= Sweden has generally platforms for mainline trains. Stockholm Commuter Rail has almost always its own platforms at height which allows stepless trains of type X60. The Arlanda Express service has platform height with floor at platform level. They have their own platforms and trains, which are incompatible with mainline platforms and trains, even if the Arlanda Express goes on a mainline. The stations Sundbyberg and Knivsta have one platform each used by both commuter trains and regional mainline trains, which can cause uncomfortable steps, but is accepted. Sundbyberg has 730 mm and Knivsta has around 500 mm. Stockholm Central station has after the commuter trains moved to the \\"City\\" station, two high 730 mm platforms, now used for mainline trains. The Stockholm Metro and Saltsj√∂banan have , while tramways in general have a very low platform, often also used by buses which must allow boarding from places without platform. =United Kingdom= The standard height for platforms is with a margin of . On the Heathrow Express the platform height is specified at . High Speed 2 is being built with a platform height of 1,115 mm, which does not conform to the European Union technical standards for interoperability for high-speed rail (EU Directive 96/48/EC). This is to provide true step free access to trains at the new HS2 stations, which is not possible using European Standards or UK standard heights. HS2 trains will operate outside of the HS2 line using existing infrastructure, which will not be step free. https://www.railengineer.co.uk/2019/03/01/buying- hs2s-high-speed-trains/ High Speed 1 has a platform height of on its international platforms. The Great Western Main Line, North London Line, Gospel Oak to Barking Line and Great Eastern Main Line platforms will be mixture of (for intercity trains) and (for London commuter trains). North America = Canada = Inter-city trains In Canada, only Montreal Central Station, Quebec's Gare du Palais and Ottawa station have high level platforms at above top of rail. Almost everywhere else in the Via Rail network, the platforms are above the rail. Current GO Transit owned infrastructure provides a platform height of 8 inches. Canadian National & Canadian Pacific owned infrastructure height is lower () Metro and light rail The Montreal Metro, the Toronto subway and Scarborough Rapid Transit, Union Pearson Express, Trillium Line, Vancouver Skytrain, Calgary C-Train, Edmonton Light Rail Transit, and ION Light Rail have high level platforms. On the Toronto streetcar system, most stops are in mixed traffic accessed from the road surface, without raised platforms. On streetcar lines that have been upgraded to LRTs in central lane reservations (St. Clair Avenue, Spadina Avenue, Queens Quay, the Queensway), and at isolated points elsewhere in the system, island medians in the roadway provide a raised platform. Roncesvalles Avenue has rebuilt to include raised bump-out platforms from the sidewalk, and a similar treatment is planned for King Street through downtown, following the success of the King Street Pilot. Passengers previously used stairs inside the older streetcars, which have since been replaced the Flexity Outlook series which is low floor and handicapped accessible. However, the raised platforms that do exist still do not provide level boarding, necessitating a wheelchair ramp for customers with wheeled mobility aids. =United States= Gauntlet track on Conrail Shared Assets Operation Lehigh Line at New Jersey Transit's Raritan Valley Line Union station. Freight trains run on the outer track so as to clear the platform New and substantially renovated stations in the United States must comply with Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), which requires level boarding. Most intercity and commuter rail systems use either high platforms level with car floors or low platforms, while metro and light rail systems use a range of platform heights. Intercity and commuter rail Most commuter rail systems in the northeastern United States have standardized on high platforms. This height was introduced in the 1960s on the Long Island Rail Road with the M1 railcars. MBTA Commuter Rail, CTrail (Hartford Line and Shore Line East), Long Island Rail Road, Metro North Railroad, NJ Transit, and SEPTA Regional Rail all use this height for new and renovated stations, though low platforms remain at some older stations. Outside the Northeast, Metra Electric District, RTD, WES Commuter Rail, and SMART also use 48-inch platforms. MARC has high-level platforms at most Penn Line stations; low platforms are used on the Camden Line and Brunswick Line due to freight clearances, except at stations with passing tracks ( or off freight routes (Baltimore-Camden, and ). Amtrak intercity service uses high-level platforms on the Northeast Corridor, Keystone Corridor, Empire Corridor, and New Haven‚ÄìSpringfield Line; some stations on the lines have not been retrofitted with high platforms. High-level platforms are also present at a small number of stations on other lines, including Worcester, Roanoke, Raleigh, and several Downeaster stations. Virgin Trains USA service in Florida also uses high level platforms. At some stations, a desired high-level platform is impractical due to wide freight trains or other practicalities. (Gauntlet tracks, which permit wide freights to pass full-length high-level platforms, have practical issue of their own.) At these locations, mini-high platforms are often used for accessibility. Mini-high platforms have a short length of high platform (long enough for one or two doors), with an accessible ramp to the longer low platform. The platform edge is usually hinged so that it can be flipped out of the way of passing freights. Most other US commuter rail systems and other Amtrak stations have low-level platforms to accommodate freight service, with mini-high platforms or portable lifts to reach the -high floors of bilevel railcars. Coaster uses platforms. Once electrified, new Caltrain trains will be equipped for both platform heights in anticipation of sharing facilities with California High-Speed Rail trains. Metro and light rail Platform heights of metro systems vary by system and even by line: on the MBTA subway system, the Blue Line platforms are at above top of rail (ATR), Orange Line platforms at and Red Line platforms at . Bay Area Rapid Transit stations have platform heights of . Most light rail systems have platforms around ATR, allowing level boarding on low-floor light rail vehicles. Most new systems are built to this standard, and some older systems like VTA light rail have been converted. Several systems including MetroLink use higher platforms with level boarding. Several older light rail systems have high-floor vehicles but low platforms, with mini-high platforms or lifts for accessibility. Some like the MBTA Green Line are being converted to low-floor rolling stock, while some like Baltimore Light Rail have permanent mini-high platforms. Muni Metro has high platforms in the subway and some surface stops, and mini-high platforms at other surface stops; the vehicles have movable steps to serve both high and low platforms. Oceania =Australia= The majority of railway systems in Australia use high level platforms with a platform height a small distance below the train floor level. Exception to this include Queensland who have narrow gauge trains and lower platforms, and South Australia who have trains fitted with low level steps to enable the use of low level platforms. In New South Wales, by 2000, the platform step (the difference between the platform height and the train floor height) had been allowed to grow to a maximum of about , which was uncomfortably large. For Sydney's 2000 Olympics, new and altered platforms were designed to match the Tangara trains, which are wide, leaving a platform gap of about and a step height close to zero. This has become the standard for all subsequent platforms and trains in NSW. Metro and light rail The tramway network in Melbourne have some low level platforms and low floor vehicles, but most trams have steps and are boarded from the road. The Adelaide Tram line has low platforms at almost all stops and operates almost entirely with low-floor trams which also have retractable ramps for street boarding where required by persons unable to step up. The Gold Coast and Sydney light rail networks have low floor trams and platforms at all stops.

This was because the Serting River flows into the Bera River, a tributary of the Pahang River. Jempol River flows into Muar River. Trading boats from River Muar could continue their journey until they reach Kuala Pahang in Pekan, or Kuala Lipis to continue into Terengganu, Kelantan or Perak. At Jalan Penarikan, the locals help will be required to pull the boats overland. The distance is about 300 meters and because of the pulling of boats overland, the route is named Penarikan, which is the Malay word for pulling. Jalan Penarikan could have been discovered in the 14th century, way before the days of Malacca Empire.Leaves of the Same Tree: Trade and Ethnicity in the Straits of Melaka, By Leonard Y. Andaya The Arab merchants were actively trading as well as spreading Islam. When Malacca was discovered, they came to Malacca for trade and at the same time; the Pasai came to Malacca too to acquire their daily sundries. Coincidentally, these are the same group of people whom they spread the religion to. The Arabs complained to the Pasai about the trials and tribulations of trading in Siam because of the arduous journey through the Strait of Malacca, then on the Straits of Terbrau before they can continue the voyage through the South China Sea towards their destination in Siam. This voyage which take weeks is extremely lengthy and difficult. After listening to the grouses of the Arab merchants, the Pasai revealed that there was a short cut where they could avoid the arduous voyage. However, they have to pull their boats off shore for a kilometer or so. Learning of this, the Arabs endeavoured to try out this route. One day, the Pasai show this route to the Arabs. First, they sailed from Malacca along the Muar River to reach Jempol River, where they have to pull the boats on shore for a short distance to get into the Serting River. They then continue their journey along the Bera River to arrive at Kuala Bera from which they proceeded to the South China Sea via Pahang River ‚Äî and finally to their destination in Siam. The Arabs discovered that even though they have to go on land for a part of the journey, it was very much shorter. So from that day onwards, they decided to use this route and Jalan Penarikan became famous ever since. Jalan Penarikan played a vital role in the military operations between Siam and Malacca. Using this route, the Siamese have launched many attacks against Malacca. A troop was sent to make an ambush. Half of the troop stayed near Jalan Penarikan as backup and the other half attacked Malacca. However, the backup group has another mission, they have to dig a big canal measuring 30 feet by 20 feet in depth, so that they could connect the two rivers, Jempol and Serting River. A leader of the Thai Army was later buried near Jalan Penarikan. The tombstone was believed to have been transported all the way from Thailand. The Siamese leader's grave could still be found near Jalan Penarikan. One interesting feature of the tombstone is that the year depicted was 1265. Jalan Penarikan has also witnessed many significant events in history. The famous Malaccan warrior Hang Tuah, while on the run with Tun Teja, used Jalan Penarikan to flee to Pahang. The last Sultan of Malacca, Sultan Mahmud Shah, after the conquest of Malacca by the Portuguese had also used Jalan Penarikan to escape to Pahang.Sejarah Malaysia, Barbara Watson Andaya, Leonard Yuzon Andaya, Macmillan, 1983 - Malaysia - 391 pages In the year 1613, a Portuguese officer wrote that he took a boat from the River Muar to the Pekan, in Pahang and the journey took him six days. A map produced in 1598 showed that the Muar River and the Pahang River is connected at a place which is now called Serting, in Jempol Negeri Sembilan. The Pahang River - Muar River route is a safer route to the South China Sea or to the Straits of Malacca, because there were no disturbances and threats of piracy that reign the seas. Apart from that there were also signs of trading activities, whereby goods changed hands at this point.

Career Born in Antwerp, Grisar's family had intended for him to pursue a tradesman's career, but he defied their wishes to devote himself to music. He studied in Antwerp with Joseph Janssens, in Paris under Anton Reicha, and in the mid-1840s in Naples with Saverio Mercadante. Grisar was a successful comic opera composer, first winning success in Brussels in 1833 and in Paris later in the decade. He collaborated with Flotow on L'Eau merveilleuse (1839), with Flotow and Auguste Pilati in La Naufrage de la M√©duse (1839), and with Fran√ßois-Adrien Boieldieu on L'Op√©ra √† la cour (1840). When he received a grant from the Belgian government in 1840 to study music of Belgian composers in Italy, he instead used his time in Rome and Naples to study compositional techniques of the comic opera. His Parisian works of the late 1840s and early 1850s were particularly well received by audiences. He died in Asni√®res near Paris.

It is one of nine podiatric medical schools in the United States. The college is accredited by the American Podiatric Medical Association's Council on Podiatric Medical Education. History The school was founded in 1914 as the California School of Chiropody and was located in San Francisco. In 1969, the name was changed to the California College of Podiatric Medicine. In 2002, the college underwent a merger with Samuel Merritt University in Oakland and the school was renamed to be the California School of Podiatric Medicine (CSPM). Until 2009, when Western University opened its College of Podiatric Medicine in Pomona, CSPM was the only podiatric medical school in the western United States. For this reason, most podiatric physicians in that part of the country attended CSPM. Academics The educational program leading to the Doctor of Podiatric Medicine degree consists of a comprehensive curriculum in the basic medical and clinical sciences. The didactic course work is completed during the first three years of the program. Clinical rotations begin at the start of the second academic year in May. During the summer months, second year students begin to participate in clinical rotations, which cover mechanical orthopedics/biomechanics, radiology, general and primary podiatric medicine. The majority of the third year and the entire fourth year are devoted to clinical rotations at inpatient and outpatient facilities, outside externships at affiliated Bay Area medical centers and throughout the United States, and community practice clerkships. In addition to podiatric medicine and surgery, students are exposed to internal medicine, vascular surgery, general surgery, orthopedics surgery, rheumatology, anesthesia, dermatology, trauma, infectious disease, and other medical fields. Students, who successfully complete the four year podiatric medical curriculum, take and pass the 3rd Year Practical Examinations, the 4th Year Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) Examination, Parts I and II of the National Board of Podiatric Medical Examiners, and receive approval for graduation by the appropriate administration and faculty may be granted the degree of Doctor of Podiatric Medicine. CSPM has a local learning center at St. Mary's Medical Center in San Francisco. In addition to St. Mary's, major hospital affiliations include Seton Medical Center, Alameda County Medical Center - Highland Hospital, Laguna Honda Hospital and Rehabilitation Center, Kaiser Permanente San Francisco, San Francisco General Hospital, VA San Francisco Medical Center, and VA Palo Alto Health Care System. In addition, fourth year students have the opportunity to do core rotations at VA Albuquerque Medical Center, Maricopa Medical Center in Arizona, VA Salt Lake City, VA Tacoma/Madigan Army Hospital, or Long Beach Memorial Medical Center.

Types The most prevalent gangs in Canada include: *Street gangs *Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs *Mafias and Organized crime groups, including Aboriginal Based Organized Crime, Indian organized crime, and East Asian organized crime *Drug cartels According to a 2004 police report, \\"The Hells Angels remain some of the largest and most powerful motorcycle gangs in the country, with growing influence in British Columbia and Ontario. Its presence has declined in other provinces due to police efforts, internal conflict and increased competition from other crime groups.\\" The same report stated that Aboriginal street gangs are not as highly organized as other criminal organizations in Canada, but are amongst the most violent. Aboriginal people also constitute a significant portion of prison populations throughout Canada, and the number of First Nation inmates continues to rise at a considerable rate. As of 2005 it is believed over 1000 Aboriginal youths were members of street gangs. According to the Criminal Intelligence Service Canada (CISC), \\"The established, well- financed and -connected Hong Kong Triad groups and crime syndicates remain, to our mind, the biggest long-term threat to Canadian law enforcement and society.\\"Lavigne, Yves. Teeth of the Dragon. Death Dealers: p. 104; 1999. In addition to Triad Societies, other Asian criminal groups, such as The Big Circle Gang, have also established national networks based in the major cities of Canada. By city =Abbotsford= Known crime groups in Abbotsford involve Punjabi street gangs, various East Asian crime groups, motorcycle gangs, and multicultural street gangs. However, there has been a gang conflict in the city mostly in West end part of the city in the Townhill Area. The gang conflict is between two South Asian gangs which involves 40 men in total between the ages of 15 to 25. According to the Abbotsford Youth Crime Prevention Project has assessed groups of people deemed to be most vulnerable to becoming part of a gang in the city. =Calgary= Major crime groups in Calgary include Aboriginal street, East Asian (Filipino/Chinese/Vietnamese) street gangs, Middle Eastern/Lebanese organized crime gangs, Punjabi street gangs and Black street gangs, among others are biker gangs, Mexican drug cartels, Somali/Sudanese drug trafficking groups, Afghan Street Gangs and Pakistani (Kashmiri and Pashtun) street gangs. Between 2002-2009 there was a bloody gang war between two rival East Asian gangs the FK and FOB gangs which resulted in 25 gang related murders. Not only East Asians were involved but there were also White, (East) Indian, and in some cases Black gang members part of these gangs.http://theses.ucalgary.ca/jspui/bitstream/11023/2372/4/ucalgary_2015_hoang_michael.pdf Disputes over the illegal distribution of fentanyl have broken out within the Middle Eastern community (with some being Lebanese). Similar to the Asian street gangs of the early 2000s, these are not therefore from exclusively one ethnicity. =Edmonton= Major crime groups in Edmonton have been identified as most being Aboriginal, Black (Central African/Jamaican/Somali), Middle Eastern (Persian/Lebanese), East Asian (Chinese/Vietnamese/Filipino) and Central/Eastern European across a similar broad social spectrum. With other crime groups involved in Edmonton as well such as Hispanic gangs, biker gangs, Aryan Nation groups, and Punjabi street gangs. However recently the arrival of Mexican drug traffickers, along with increased activity by outlaw motorcycle gangs, is changing the face of organized crime in Alberta especially in the major cities of Edmonton along with Calgary. =Halifax= Biker gangs have, at various points, played a major role in Halifax's crime scene, particularly during the 1980s and 1990s. However, there has been a crackdown on biker gang activity throughout Eastern Canada, in the wake of the Quebec Biker War. Most biker gangs are composed of extended families or of close associates, providing little scope for recruitment or promotion from outside. The well- known Bloods and Crips have been part of Halifax's gang environment as well. =Hamilton= The area in and around Hamilton was once home to organized crime figure Rocco Perri, and Johnny Papalia of the Papalia crime family. Murders of traditional mobsters in 2017 and 2018 indicate that the group is still active. After the September 2018 killing of real estate agent Al Iavarone, police sources told the Toronto Star that the hit was in retaliation for previous actions against the Musitano crime family as part of a \\"dispute between two Niagara Region groups of mobsters who are both tied to the New York State [Buffalo] mob. A news report stated that \\"there has been a resurgence of mafia-related crime in the greater Toronto and Hamilton areas in the last couple of years, leading police to believe there may be a 'power struggle'\\". On 30 January 2019, Cece Luppino, son of Rocco Luppino of the Luppino crime family, was killed in front of his parents' Hamilton home. =Montreal= Gangs in Montreal are mostly European (most Italian, French, Irish and Russian) but there are minority gangs which are mostly of Jamaican, Haitian, Hispanic, Lebanese, Asian, Sri Lankan, or Cambodian descent. United smaller street gangs made up of mostly youths are pocketed in different areas of the Montreal area, particularly in Montr√©al-Nord, St-Michel, Parc- Extension, Ville Saint-Laurent(St-Low), C√¥te-des-Neiges, NDG, Rivi√®re-des- Prairies, Saint-Fran√ßois, Laval and St-L√©onard neighbourhoods. =Ottawa= Major crime groups in Ottawa involve Biker gangs, Arab street gangs, and East Asian crime groups. Many other crime groups also exist such as Somali. In Ottawa, by the early twentieth-century, drive by shootings were rare and most gang activity involved narcotic distribution. =Saskatchewan= Adult gangs in Saskatchewan are almost entirely aboriginal based. The largest gang activity is in Regina and Saskatoon. There is also a branch of the Hells Angels in the province. Youth gangs are also almost entirely aboriginal based. Saskatchewan had the highest concentration of gang membership in Canada at 1.34 per 1000 in 2002 There are possibly 108 street gangs for the Prairie region. =Greater Toronto Area= Certain neighbourhoods in Toronto have experienced gang and organized crime activity including human trafficking, firearm trafficking, drug trafficking, robbery, and Mafia/mob activity. A police survey found that most youth gangs in Ontario and the GTA are ethnically African/Caribbean (Somali/Jamaican/Haitian/Guyanese), Caucasian (Italian/Russian/Portuguese/Albanian/Polish/Greek/Spanish), and South Asian (Indian/Punjabi/Pakistani/Afghan/Tamil). There are also a number of East Asian and Latino gangs in the area. Although Toronto's murder rate remains low, there has been a recent rise in gun violence in the downtown core of the greater Toronto area. The two most focal incidents were the Boxing Day shooting, a shootout between rival gangs that resulted in the death of 15-year-old bystander Jane Creba on December 26, 2005 on Yonge Street, and a mall food court shooting at the Eaton Centre on June 2, 2012, which left two dead and injured seven others, including a 13-year-old boy. Hassan was considered to be the targeted victim and is considered to be gang-affiliated while others were considered innocent bystanders. In June 2015, RCMP led police raids across the Greater Toronto Area, named Project OPhoenix, which resulted in the arrest of 19 men, allegedly affiliated with the 'Ndrangheta. Testimony during the trial revealed that the crime group was still very active as recently as 2015, with activities in mortgage and bank fraud as well as cocaine trafficking. Giuseppe (Pino) Ursino and Romanian-born Cosmin (Chris) Dracea of Toronto faced two counts of cocaine trafficking for the benefit of a criminal organization and one charge of conspiracy to commit an indictable offence. The 2018 trial in Ontario Superior Court in Toronto was the first in Canada to target the 'Ndrangheta as an organized crime group since the Criminal Code was amended in 1997 to include the concept of a criminal organization. Granted, neither of the defendants admitted to having been part of that organization.Crown calling for lengthy prison sentences in GTA Mafia drug-importing trial, Toronto Star, 9 January 2019No excuses 'besides being stupid,' drug smuggler in landmark Mafia trial tells judge at sentencing hearing, The National Post, 9 January 2019 Both were convicted of conspiracy to smuggle drugs. At the sentencing, the presiding judge had made this comment: \\"Based on the evidence at trial, Giuseppe Ursino is a high-ranking member of the 'Ndrangheta who orchestrated criminal conduct and then stepped back to lessen his potential implication\\" ... Cosmin Dracea knew he was dealing with members of a criminal organization when he conspired to import cocaine\\". After the Ursino/Dracea trial, Tom Andreopoulos, deputy chief federal prosecutor, offered this comment about the organization: > \\"We‚Äôre talking about structured organized crime. We‚Äôre talking about a > political entity, almost; a culture of crime that colonizes across the sea > from Italy to Canada. This is one of the most sophisticated criminal > organizations in the world.\\" In June 2018, Cosimo Ernesto Commisso, of Vaughan and an unrelated woman were shot and killed. According to sources contacted by the Toronto Star, \\"Commisso was related to Cosimo \\"The Quail\\" Commisso of Siderno, Italy, who has had relations in Ontario, is considered by police to be a \\"'Ndrangheta organized crime boss\\" of the Siderno Group. On 16 August 2019, Paolo Caputo of Richmond Hill was shot and killed at his restaurant in Toronto. According to the Toronto Star, police sources said that Caputo was a longtime associate of Montreal mob leader Vito Rizzuto who died in 2013. During the investigation of the apparent mob hit of Albert Iavarone in September 2018, a Police investigator made this comment about organized crime. \\"If you look back over the last couple years there has been a number of murders, a number of bombings, a number of arsons throughout the GTA and up to as far as Montreal. It is our belief that there is something going on in the underworld. We are not sure if this particular case factors into that but is something we are alive to\\". =Brampton= Known crime groups in Brampton include mainly South Asian and Black gangs but there are a few White, Portuguese, and Filipino gangs in the city. =Scarborough= There are dozens of tribes of gangs in Scarborough, but the most common ones that are seen are the Afghan street gangs, Tamil street gangs, Chinese street gangs, West Indian (Caribbean) street gangs and Pakistani street gangs. =Metro Vancouver= According to law enforcement agencies, the most significant crime groups in Vancouver are the motorcycle gangs (such as the Hells Angels), East Asian street gangs (mostly Vietnamese drug gangs/Asian-Chinese Triads), and Punjabi street gangs, although others exist (mainly Eastern European, Persian, or Italian Based groups) Other minor crime groups quite often Mexican drug cartels, and Aboriginal street gangs are also seen in the metro area.http://www.streetgangs.com/billboard/viewtopic.php?f=491&t;=3667&start;=32 However, in recent years, \\"multicultural\\" street gangs have grown significantly in power and prominence, and have attained much media attention due to their involvement in numerous shootings and slayings throughout the city, including the 2009 Vancouver gang war. According to the Combined Forces Special Enforcement Unit of British Columbia the ethnicities of people who died from a total of 160 gang related deaths in British Columbia between January 2006 to March 2014 were: ‚ñ∏ Caucasian/White (74 victims; 46.3%) ‚ñ∏ South Asian (predominantly Punjabis) (34 victims; 21.3%) ‚ñ∏ East Asian (most Chinese or Vietnamese) (33 victims; 20.6%) ‚ñ∏ Central Asian (mostly Persian) (10 victims; 6.3%) ‚ñ∏ First Nations (6 victims; 3.8%) ‚ñ∏ Hispanic (3 victims; 1.9%) ‚ñ∏ African/Caribbean (0 victims; 0%) =Surrey= Major crime groups in the city are the South Asian (predominantly Punjabi) street gangs, East Asian (mainly Vietnamese) street gangs, biker gangs. Gangs have operated in Surrey, leading to an increase in the murder rate, although this almost ceased; the police claimed this was because the perpetrators had left the country.http://www.abbynews.com/national/vancouver/3462722423.html Most gangs within the city today battle out in Surrey's Newton community, predominantly but inexclusively amongst the South Asian community. =Burnaby= Criminal gangs in Burnaby are composed of elements of most ethnic groupings within Vancouver. =Winnipeg= Winnipeg's gang activity consists heavily of Aboriginal and black criminals, with a smaller number of other ethnic groups namely European, East Asian (Filipino/Vietnamese); it has been described as the Aboriginal gang capital of Canada.

An outstanding defensive boxer, Horne lost only 10 bouts and fought one draw in 121 professional fights.  Early years  Horne grew up in a working-class Irish-American family in Niles, Ohio, a town located in the industrial region of the Mahoning Valley. He began his amateur boxing career in the late 1930s, under the guidance of local trainer and police chief Matt McGowan. By the time he was 17 years old, the fighter had already established an impressive amateur career.The Girard Review, Sept. 6, 2007. By 1941, he had won several Golden Glove titles and was considered one of the most promising amateurs in his weight class in the country. In the late 1940s, Horne relocated to New York City to establish a professional career. Professional career  Horne won 24 of his first 26 professional fights and lost only six of his first 50. While he fought many of the leading boxers of his day, including Bobby Dykes and Tommy Bell, Horne is best known for three matches with the legendary Rocky Graziano. He first stepped into the ring with Graziano in New York on January 18, 1946, losing in the 10th round. Horne faced Graziano again on April 5, 1948, and a final time on December 6, 1949. In both cases, he lost in the 10th round. Horne also faced middleweight contender Pete Mead, losing a bout in 1946, but defeating Mead in a rematch the following year. In the late 1940s, he was knocked out by Artie Levine.  Illness and death  Horne's career came to a tragic end when he was diagnosed with Lou Gehrig's disease in the late 1940s. He succumbed to the chronic illness in 1959. His accomplishments were remembered in his native Ohio, where Horne was the first person to be inducted into the Trumbull County, Ohio and Area Boxers Hall of Fame. Horne's daughter, Marilyn Horne Nickell, was on hand for the induction ceremony. Among the local celebrity boxers who attended the ceremony was former IBF lightweight champion Harry Arroyo.

It explores themes of ruthless ambition and its consequences. The film was directed by Eric Schwab, and stars Carmine Giovinazzo, Norbert Weisser, and Monet Mazur. Plot Paul Cleveland (Carmine Giovinazzo) fights off Georgia's (Monet Mazur) attacker. A strong bond develops between the two and the ambition of Cleveland begins to surface rapidly as he starts to participate in scams with Georgia to raise enough money to leave his job as a hospital orderly behind. When they try to scam Marshal (played by Vincent Ventresca) by staging a road accident using Georgia as a distracting female hitchhiker it seems that they have struck a very dangerous individual as he produces a gun and kidnaps them. Marshal is head of a record company and controls a very large financial empire and he takes Paul and Georgia to his offices where he eventually makes them an offer and congratulates them for their enterprise. The ambitious Cleveland then offers his further services to Marshal in a similar way to Bud Fox approaching Gordon Gekko in the film Wall Street The similarities between Gordon Gekko and Marshal are apparent as he begins to reward Cleveland for tasks accomplished. The empty warehouse that he gives them for Georgia and Paul to freely decorate and furnish is a similarity. Paul soon begins to become obsessed with how much Marshal needs him and begins to neglect Georgia in preference to Marshal's lucrative offers. Georgia also begins to become disenchanted with their lifestyle and this becomes the theme for the rest of the film as her ethics begin to clash with Marshal's organization and Paul's trance like obedience to him.

The school runs the Foot and Ankle Institute, the largest podiatric medical clinic in Philadelphia. History TUSPM was opened in September 1963 as the Pennsylvania College of Podiatric Medicine (PCPM). After Temple‚Äôs original medical school closed in 1960, several members of its faculty obtained a charter from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to open a new podiatric medical school. PCPM existed in rented facilities for its first few years, and moved into its own center at 8th and Pine streets in 1965. When the current campus opened in 1973, it was the first facility ever developed specifically for podiatric use. In addition to classrooms and labs, the complex includes student housing building and a medical clinic, known as the Foot and Ankle Institute. PCPM merged with Temple in July 1998. Shoe Museum The TUSPM Shoe Museum includes roughly 900 pairs of shoes, 250 of which are on display on the sixth floor of the college building. The museum was created during the nation's bicentennial in 1976 as an added attraction for visitors to the Liberty Bell and Independence Park, which are only two blocks from the college.

The site was originally named The Miyazaki Web and was hosted from 1994 on tcp.com before being moved to a dedicated host by Jeremy Blackman in 1996. Team Ghiblink, the group of volunteers who maintain the site, was formed in 1996 from people on the Miyazaki Mailing list (which was established in 1991). The site is used as a major source of Studio Ghibli information by anime news sources such as Anime News Network.

The site also hosts a searchable archive index of the Miyazaki Mailing list. The site was hacked in October 1998 and was mostly recovered and relaunched in early 1999 through the efforts of many people who used the site as well as through backups made by early versions of Google Search.

The series is followed up by the 1995 two-episode original video animation Yamato Takeru: After War. Synopsis In the 25th century, a spaceship carrying 300 scientists leaves the Earth in search of a new world in the solar system, but an unexpected accident occurs. They encountered a black hole that is connected to another universe through space and time. The people on board abandoned their ship and ejected emergency capsules to a planet called Ismo. Upon the chaos a child was born and the first infant to be native Ismo, Yamato Takeru. Ismo is a star of the Onam System, which corresponds to the Solar System in our universe. It is the only planet left in the Onam System. The Death Star called Yomi is a comet which regularly approaches the Onam System. There were once 8 planets in the Onam System. Many years ago, in the \\"time of the gods\\", there was a war against the evil monster Yamata no Orochi (an 8-headed dragon). The gods won the battle. Yamata no Orochi was locked into 8 capsules, one of which is buried deep in the center of each planet. Nobody was supposed to have access to the core of the planets. However Tsukuyomi, an evil \\"god\\" who rules Yomi, succeeded in reaching the capsules one after another. Seven of the planets were destroyed using his powerful robots, the Evil Sky Warriors. However, when he tried to acquire the last capsule from the planet Ismo, the most powerful Sky Warrior, Susanoo, got out of control and was blown away. A million years later, the Death Star Yomi is approaching the Onam System once again. Tsukuyomi, the master of Yomi, plans to take this opportunity to realize his dream of ruling the entire universe. He is desperate for the last stone containing Yamatano Orochi. If Tsukuyomi can get hold of this capsule, Yamata no Orochi will return to life and its power will become his. Tsukuyomi needs Sky Warrior Susanoo to abstract Orochi and dispatches Sky Soldiers to retrieve Susanoo. But it is too late. Susanoo no longer belongs to Tsukuyomi. It belongs to Takeru, a 12-year-old boy from Earth, who happened to discover the buried robot Susanoo and woke it from its million-year-long sleep. Takeru becomes involved in the battle against the Sky Soldiers and the fate of all in Ismo.

While living in the village, he was the star trouble maker of the group. He was respected amongst his peers as the leader and bring no end to mischief (for good or bad intentions). After he encounters Susanoo and used the destructive powers of the mech to defeat their enemies attacking the village, the villagers banished the mech and blame it for their misfortune. Yamato cannot deal with the superstitious nature of the villagers and opted to leave with his best friend to see the world. It was his journey not long that would allow him to meet Oto and new friends and enemies. After defeating Orochi, he leaves Susanoo where he once rested in the caves and visits him to talk. Because there's no epilogue, it is assumed that Yamato will still cause some trouble in the village as he used to. He'll also probably end up with Oto and start a life together in the village. In After War, Yamato is called again to pilot Susanoo when a piece of the Dark Sky Carriage falls near the village and Shuranoo reveals itself. But when Yamato refuses to fight Shuranoo, who is possessed by Mikazuchi, Shuranoo mercilessly slashes at Susanoo and then sends it into the lake where it is rescued and healed by the Dragon Carrier. The renewed Susanoo flies off to find Oto who had been kidnapped by Shuranoo. In the end, Yamato was going to sacrifice himself and Oto (willingly) to defeat Tsukiyomi by flying into the sun. Before they get to the melting point, Mikazuchi appears and tells them that he would pilot Susanoo and that Yamato and Oto should live out their lives. Tears fall from Yamato's eyes as Susanoo looks back at him once more before flying into the sun destroying himself and Tsukiyomi. =Oto Tachibana= She's the sister to Mikazuchi and love interest of Yamato. She was sent as an undercover agent to win Yamato's trust and steal Susanoo away from Yamato and murder him. Things become complicated as Oto develops a real bond with the group and even falls for Yamato. Because she has been contaminated, she was also marked for death amongst her peers. She later finds out that she's actually not related to Mikazuchi, but a little girl taken away from her real mother. Mikazuchi however never knew about this and after being possessed by Orochi he used the dark energies of Orochi to corrupt Oto's soul. It was not until Orochi broken the psionic bind between Mikazuchi and his mech that her mind was free from dark influence. Towards the end of the series she now lives in the village along with Yamato. There was no epilogue to speak of her fate, but it is assumed that she will eventually have a real romantic relationship with Yamato and marry him. In After War, Oto had because a member of the Yakumo Village along with Hayamika. When Shuranoo attacks the village, she is kidnapped and taken to Tsukiyomi who then reveals that it is a parasite that had latched on to her mum's body. She is then absorbed by Tsukiyomi while her mum is released. Yamato follows but is hesitant at attacking because Oto was a part of it. In the end Yamato realises that to defeat Tsukiyomi they need to fly her into the sun so he grabs her and heads towards the sun but before they reach the sun Mikazuchi appears and tells them to live their lives full and tells them that he approves of them causing tears to run down Oto's face. Mikazuchi frees them and sends them back towards the Dragon Carrier as Susanoo and Tsukiyomi meet their ends. =Roka= He's the best friend to Yamato and in many ways his second conscience. Roka was always afraid of the things Yamato would do because it tends to be dangerous or morally conflicting. When Yamato chose to leave their village, Roka tagged along for the journey. Through their adventures together between battling Sky Warriors and avoiding danger, he learned to become a stronger person. By the time they returned to their home village, Roka has become wiser and braver than he used to. He returns in After War as a scholar and wears glasses now. =Sky Warriors and Soldiers= In the anime, all the giant alien robots are called \\"Demon Air War Gods\\" or \\"Dark Sky Warriors\\" in Japanese. These robots are bio- mechanized with their own personalities, feelings, and unique powers. All the pilots of these fantastic machines are actually kidnapped children that were trained to be obedient, skillful, and murderous agents of their dark priestess. Though robotic in form, they are made through bio-mechanical incubation and have the ability to evolve over time to take even more powerful forms. All \\"Demon Air War Gods\\" recharge through special bacta-like pods which repairs and recharges their energies, but because they are also living machines they can eat as well. All their internal cockpits have crystal orbs which act as an interface with their pilot and also respond to human emotions to react accordingly to the pilots feelings. In After War, when Susanoo's arm is cut off it reveals a beating body of flesh underneath that further proves that the Sky Warriors are indeed alive. Because this series was never English subbed/dubbed, only their Japanese names remains: ; Susanoo : : Susanoo once belonged to a merciless unnamed pilot that used Susanoo's powers to destroy seven worlds. Susanoo's pilot for unexplained reasons landed upon the green planet and died there leaving his sword behind along with his remains. Yamato would eventually stumble upon Susanoo and used its destructive powers for good, but never once realizing that inside Susanoo also lies the dark spirit of the one of eight-headed dragon. Through combat, Susanoo eventually evolved into a larger and more powerful form to defeat his enemies. The dark dragon spirit that once resided in Susanoo left when the very energies that bound him were used to revive Yamato. In time the dark energies that resided in Susanoo were cleansed through Yamato's journey. Susanoo would eventually develop a psychic link with Yamato and respond to his every thought and intention. In the After War OVA Susanoo is once again called upon against a revived Shuranoo but because of Yamato's unwillingness to destroy Mikazuchi, Susanoo is beaten and loses an arm in the process. Shuranoo pushes Susanoo into the Yakumo lake where it was healed by the Dragon Carrier and subsequently evolve into his 3rd form which is a red samurai-themed armor. In the end, Yamato takes Susanoo towards the sun taking Tsukiyomi and Oto with it, but Mikazuchi intervenes and takes control of Susanoo and sends Yamato and Oto back to Earth as he sacrifices himself to kill Tsukiyomi and approving Yamato and Oto being together. ; Shuranoo : : Amon pilots \\"the strongest demon air war God.\\" Shuranoo was coined the \\"most powerful.\\" While under Amon's piloting skills Shuranoo was indeed formidable, but proven at best on par in battle strength with Gaiou and Susanoo. After Amon died, no one else was left to pilot Shuranoo and so Shuranoo was left behind in the \\"Dark Sky Carriage\\". Its fate was left an answered until After War where it is revealed that it had survived the \\"Dark Sky Carriage\\"'s destruction. It appears in Yakumo village in the dead of night where it starts to cause chaos forcing Yamato to pilot Susanoo again. It is revealed that in fact Mikazuchi was controlling it. It easily beats Susanoo and then kidnaps Oto who is inside Tamanoo to Tsukiyomi. Its next appearance is when Tsukiyomi creates an amalgamation of all the defeated Dark Air War Gods and the remains of the Yamata no Orochi into one horrific beast. Only through Susanoo using light from the sun powering his sword was the beast defeated. ; Tamanoo : : Tamanoo is initially piloted by Amatsumi but after he is killed by Kiriomi, Yamato's new friend Kaon tries to pilot it. Even though Amatsumi was dead, Tamanoo is still shrouded in his evil presence. Only through Yamato playing his ocarina is the evil presence destroyed and Kaon is able to pilot it. In Susanoo's first stage Tamanoo towers over it but the difference is less apparent in its second stage. In After War, during Susanoo and Ashuranoo's battle, Oto pilots Tamanoo but after Shuranoo knocks Susanoo into the lake, it kidnaps Oto and takes her to Tsukiyomi. Its next appearance is when Tsukiyomi creates an amalgamation of all the defeated Dark Air War Gods and the remains of the YamatanoOrochi into one horrofic beast. Only through Susanoo using light from the sun powering his sword was the beast defeated. ; Tokinoo : : Kushinada pilots Tokinoo. Tokinoo and Shishinoo are both defeated by Gaioh. Its last appearance is when Tsukiyomi creates an amalgamation of all the defeated Dark Air War Gods and the remains of the Yamata no Orochi into one horrific beast. Only through Susanoo using light from the sun powering his sword was the beast defeated. ; Shishinoo : : Kiriyuu pilots Shishinoo. Kiriyuu has the ability to predict his enemie's movements which gives him an advantage though it is useless when there are thunderstorms. Shishinoo and Tokinoo are both defeated by Gaioh. Its last appearance is when Tsukiyomi creates an amalgamation of all the defeated Dark Air War Gods and the remains of the Yamata no Orochi into one horrific beast. Only through Susanoo using light from the sun powering his sword was the beast defeated. ; Kazenoo : : Kiriomi pilots Kazenoo, a blue and green schemed \\"Dark Sky Warrior.\\" Though not the most powerful, it was a high speed combatant able to fly and move swifter than any of the mechs. It was the fourth mech to pursue and destroy Susanoo and Yamato. After several failed attempts to kill Yamato and procure Susanoo, Kazenii and Kiriomi were presumed destroyed as the mech was destroyed in battle and Kiriomi falling into molten rock. However in a later episode it is revealed that Kazenoo was discarded into space. While a little banged up, it wasn't blown into pieces as last scene. It was left as floating space debris above a blue planet where Kiriomi was actually held imprisoned in a crystal casing. After Kiriomi was revived and reformed, Kazenoo was part of the Golden Dragon Carriage's complement and protected Yamato's village when it was attacked during the final stages of the battle. Kazenoo is one of the few mechs in this series that endured the most beatings and managed to survive throughout the whole series. It is presumed Kiriomi has either taken Kazenoo with him to another place or left to \\"sleep\\" in a cave like Susanoo as such machines are no longer needed in time of peace. In After War, when Tsukiyomi creates a horrific creature formed from the remains of the YamatanoOrochi and the defeated Dark Air War Gods, Susanoo repeatedly slashes at the beast but its regeneration meant he was only using up his energy. At this time, Kazenoo piloted by Kiriomi appears to help him. After the beast is slain, Tsukiyomi tries to escape into outer space and Kazenoo follows only to be hit by an attack that disintegrates his shoulder armour and sends him flying back towards the Dragon Carrier. ; Aranoo : : Ouka pilots Amanoo and the least violent one of the group. He always had feelings for Oto, but never once told her of his feelings for her. He initially tries to approach Yamato to give Oto a message from Mikazuchi. Later it fights with Susanoo but Oto climbs into Susanoo and thrusts the Sword of Kusanagi into Aranoo's chest and injures Ouka. Mikazuchi takes Aranoo after knocking out Ouka to fight a renewed Susanoo who blocks his fatal attack on an unconscious Yamato. Yamato climbs onto Susanoo and renews his fight with Mikazuchi. Aranoo loses because of the previous damage to its body and a piece of shrapnel flies towards Oto who is watching the fight on a cliff. When Aranoo was defeated and exploded, the arm was still intact and fell on top of Oto. Ouka uses all his strength to hold up the weight of the mech arm to have Yamato save Oto. Because he was severely injured the weight of the arm fell on him and as he was dying he gave a small white flower to Oto and died. They later removed his body and gave him a proper burial. Its last appearance is when Tsukiyomi creates an amalgamation of all the defeated Dark Air War Gods and the remains of the Yamata no Orochi into one horrific beast. Only through Susanoo using light from the sun powering his sword was the beast defeated. ; Tsukinoo : : Hayamika pilots Tsukinoo. Tsukinoo resembles a female samurai-like Sky Warrior with violet coloring scheme. Tsukinoo appeared to kill Takeru after she was tricked in rage to kill him. After she calmed down, Tsukinoo suffered a conflict between Tsukinoo when her emotions caused a backlash in the system and caused her Sky Warrior to go berserk and explode. Its last appearance is when Tsukiyomi creates an amalgamation of all the defeated Dark Air War Gods and the remains of the Yamata no Orochi into one horrific beast. Only through Susanoo using light from the sun powering his sword was the beast defeated. ; Gaiou : : The \\"demon air war god\\" which takes in the \\"Spirit of the Eight Headed Dragon\\" from Susanoo. Gaiou was the latest \\"Dark Sky Warrior\\" to be made by the Dark Priestess and rewarded to Mikazuchi if he completed his mission of recovering Susanoo and killing Yamato. During the battle between Susanoo, Yamato died and was revived by the same powers that bound the \\"Spirit of the Eight Headed Dragon\\" and went wild. After several failed attacks on Yamato, the \\"Spirit of the Eight Headed Dragon\\" spirited into space where it sensed Gaiou. Overriding Gaiou's systems, it possessed the mech and \\"rescued\\" Mikazuchi to use him as a vessel to achieve its goals. Because the \\"Spirit of the Eight Headed Dragon\\" resides within Gaiou, he can act on his own with intent. After \\"Spirit of the Eight Headed Dragon\\" made it to its incubating body within the \\"Dark Sky Carriage\\", Gaiou was vaporized as the Eight Headed Dragon was revived. Gaiou may not be the most powerful, but Mikazuchi proved he can go head to head with anyone who fights him including Susanoo and Shuranoo. Nearing the final stages of the anime he is able to acquire the power of Amanoshiratori and combines gaioh with it, giving Gaiou and additional layer of armor. In this state he is able to defeat both Shishinoo and Tokinoo at the same time. Gaiou was never defeated in battle, but the power of Orochi's rebirth destroyed Gaiou, Shuranoo, and the entire floating fortress Death Star Yomi. It does not appear in After War. ; Amano Shiratori : : The Amanoshiratori is a legendary bird that Yamato tries to acquire the power of to stop Tsukiyomi. The Amanoshiratori gives Yamato a test. Whether he values its power more or his friend's lives. Mikazuchi is also present but Yamato could not give up his friends for the power of Amanoshiratori and so Mikazuchi takes its power to make Gaiou even stronger. When Oto's body is taken over by the \\"Spirit of the Eight Headed Dragon\\", she pilots it. When Gaiou is vaporized in the \\"Dark Sky Carriage\\", so is Amanoshiratori's body. But when Susanoo falls from the \\"Dark Sky Carriage\\", Amanoshirotori's spirit flies down to protect Susanoo and Yamato. It does not appear in After War.

Launched the new products ‚ÄúPear makkoli‚Äù, Pear Distilled Liquor, and Pear Wine Project ‚ÄúProject for Reviving Traditional Korean Wines‚Äù aims to revive parts of the traditional Korean culture and the traditional Korean wines that have already been forgotten. The company has revived the traditional Korean wines that have already been forgotten, dating back to the period of the Japanese occupation, and has showcased them in BEKSEJU Village. Korean ancestors used to brew wines with ingredients that had been produced during certain seasons, and the brewing method differed from one province or family to another. This is called ‚ÄúGayangju culture.‚Äù Since time immemorial, therefore, the kinds of wines in Korea have already been very diverse, but during the Japanese occupation and the war that ensued after the liberation, and in the process of economic development, many of these wines disappeared. At present, there are 600 kinds of wines that we still have records of. To systematically revive and reinterpret the culture of traditional Korean wines and the side dishes for wines that are already in danger of disappearing, Koonsoondang carried out the ‚Äúproject for Reviving Traditional Korean Wines‚Äù to fulfill its responsibility as the leading company in the Korean traditional-wine industry, and to modify the current twisted drinking culture in the country. The first revival was accomplished in 2008. Different kinds of sesiju or wines related to the four seasons and folk customs were revived. The second round of revivals was carried out in 2009, with focus on the representative wine of each era (Three Kingdoms, Koryo, Chosun dynasty). The research laboratories of Kook Soon Dang have made the necessary preparations for the effort to revive the traditional Korean wines over a period of three years. The \\"Project for Reviving Traditional Korean Wines\\" aims to revive parts of the traditional Korean culture and the traditional Korean wines that have already been forgotten. Brands =Bekseju= #Bekseju - Baekseju (sold under the brand name Bek Se Ju; literally \\"one-hundred-years wine\\") is a Korean glutinous rice-based fermented alcoholic beverage flavored with a variety of herbs. According to some, the name comes from the legend that the healthful herbs in baekseju will help you live to be 100 years old. The drink is infused with ginseng and eleven other herbs, including licorice, omija (Schisandra chinensis), gugija (Chinese wolfberry), Astragalus propinquus root, ginger, and cinnamon. #Bekseju dry ‚Äì is a no-sugar wine that is not sweet and that revives the dry and pure taste of certain foods. #Kangjang bekseju ‚Äì Made from more than twice the amount of herbs in the original BEKSEJU, the premium KANGJANG BEKSE JU is brewed with the finest and unique traditional method, using ginseng as the major ingredient plus 9 other valuable herbs that are all cultivated in Korea. #Jayang bekseju ‚Äì The 12 Oriental herbs used for JAYANG BEKSEJU were selected based on the five prescriptions of Dong Ui Bo Gam (Principles and Practice of Eastern Medicine) and were made into the JAYANG BEKSEJU medicinal wine. The wine's 30-day maturation makes a deep and strong taste. #The legend of bekseju ‚Äì once upon a time, there was a nobleman who was riding through a town. On his way, he witnessed the most unusual sight. A young man was beating an old man who seemed to be his father! The nobleman stopped his horse to scold the young man. ‚ÄúHow dare you hit that helpless old man!‚Äù The young man turned around and said, ‚ÄúThis is my son who was born when I was 80 years old. I told him to drink the wine but he didn‚Äôt take my advice. Now he has grown older than I am.‚Äù The nobleman bowed down in humility before the young man, asking what the miraculous drink might be. The young man told the nobleman about BEKSEJU, a special wine made from 12kinds of oriental herbs, including Korean Ginseng. =50seju= :50seju is brewed with quality rice. Korean traditional rice wine. =Yedam charyeju= :Yedam charyeju is especially made for ancestor worship ceremonies. =Myungjak= #Myungjak sanghwang ‚Äì This is a wine made from natural Sanghwang Mushroom that grows on Mulberry trees in the wild. The mushroom(Phellinus Linteus) is a medicinal mushroom widely used in Korea, Japan and China. It was selected as one of the World's 10 Anti-cancer Effect food by U.S FDA in 2002. #Myungjak Bokbunja ‚Äì This wine is made of Black Raspberry(BOKBUNJA) which has been known as a stimulant for sex drive. Women may also get some effects on promoting healthy skin and ision, as well as protection for the heart and liver. #Myungjak omija ‚Äì This is a naturally fermented wine from Omija (Schisandra chinensis fruit) which has been used for tonic medicine for a long time in many Asian countries. Omija strengthens the heart and immune system, reduces blood pressure and relieves coughs and helps in brightening and clearing the skin by aiding in blood circulation. #Myungjak ogaja ‚Äì This is a naturally fermented wine from Ogaja (Siberian Ginseng's Fruit). Prized for its ability to restore vigor, increase longevity, strengthen the immune system, and stimulate both appetite and memory, Siberian Ginseng is widely used in Russia to help the body adapt when being subjected to stressful conditions. =Rice makkoli= :A traditional alcoholic beverage in Korea, it is a milky rice wine with a creamy consistency and sweet taste. #Canned makkoli - Using an extended fermentation process, the taste and aroma of this wine has been richly refined. Since this rice wine is canned, it becomes bacteria-free and it can be stored for 1year. #Draught makkoli - The ability of Kooksoondang's Draught makkoli to hold its extraordinary quality and freshness for such a prolonged period of time lies in the nation's first utilized controlled fermentation method. #Mimong - Its name means ‚ÄòThe dream of the rice‚Äô. With the use of special nuruk, it is made to exude the ancient Korean traditional rice wine taste.

It is the coordinating umbrella organization for the other two pillars (The Board of Supreme Audit and the Inspectors General) of the national strategic anti-corruption campaign. The CoI seeks to promote and advance open, honest and accountable government through public education and awareness programs allowing citizens to report corruption through anonymous means. CoI works closely with the Inspectors General (IGs) of each Ministry and with the Board of Supreme Audit (BSA) to coordinate anti- corruption efforts. The CoI is also working with Ministry of Education officials to implement curricular materials in ethics and civics in public schools. [ Dr. Salah Noori Khalaf] is the current Commissioner. History The commission was originally created on January 31, 2004, by the Iraqi Governing Council as authorized by the Coalition Provisional Authority's order 55,Coalition Provisional Authority Order 55 and was subsequently incorporated into the 2005 Constitution of Iraq. Judge Radhi Hamza al-Radhi was selected by U.S. Ambassador Paul Bremer as the first Commissioner from a list of three candidates chosen by the old Judicial Council. On September 6, 2007, he announced his resignation, citing political pressure from the government of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki and anonymous death threats, and deputy commissioner Moussa Faraj was named to replace him. Stuart Bowen, who serves as Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction, was quoted as saying Radhi's departure was \\"a real blow to anti-corruption efforts in Iraq\\", and that Rahdi had asked Bowen for help in fleeing Iraq. On October 4, 2007, al- Radhi appeared before the U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform and accused the government of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki of protecting corrupt employees and of actively attempting to \\"eradicate or control the Commission\\" and refusing to recognize the independence of the Commission on Public Integrity in violation of the Iraqi Constitution. The government responded by announcing they would sue al-Radhi for smuggling official documents, defaming the prime minister, and corruption. He later was granted asylum in the United States in July 2008. On 19 October 2009, the Commission on Integrity published its annual report for the year 2008.

It was originally broadcast on Comedy Central in the United States on October 10, 2007. In the episode, Stan's father Randy produces what is apparently \\"the biggest crap\\" ever taken, but his claims for the world record are challenged. \\"More Crap\\" is a highly scatological episode of South Park, with the entire plot and many of the jokes revolving around fecal matter in some way. It is one of the very few episodes where Cartman, Kyle and Kenny did not appear. The episode satirizes U2 singer Bono for \\"seem[ing] like such a piece of crap\\". The plot of \\"More Crap\\" satirizes the competitive nature of trying to become the record-holder in a peculiar category. It parodies elements of the 2007 documentary The King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters, which is about the competition for the biggest high score in the arcade game Donkey Kong. The episode aired shortly after South Park received an Emmy Award that year for the episode \\"Make Love, Not Warcraft\\". A running gag in \\"More Crap\\" makes reference to the show's Emmy-winning status, during especially scatological scenes. Plot Randy is suffering from severe constipation and has been unable to defecate for more than three weeks. After taking a laxative, Randy produces an abnormally large piece of excrement shaped like a football during an extremely painful bowel movement. Believing he has passed the world's biggest stool, he reaches out to the \\"European Fecal Standards and Measurements\\" office, headquartered in Z√ºrich, Switzerland. The institute concludes he has the world record, weighing in at 8.6 courics ‚Äì a fictional measurement unit (approximately ) named after journalist Katie Couric. As Randy is the first American to ever receive the award, the American government holds a ceremony to honor his achievement. However, it is interrupted by a video of Bono, the previous record holder, claiming he has just taken a crap weighing 9.5 courics, and is therefore still the record holder. His claim is accepted, despite protests that his only proof is an unverified photo. Randy is saddened by the loss of his record, and his friends convince him to train hard and reclaim the position. After three weeks of eating, an ultrasound reveals his feces have reached about 14 courics in weight. Bono successfully demands Randy be required to pass his stool in Z√ºrich. This prompts Randy's son Stan to visit Bono's mansion and ask him to relinquish the first place record, saying Randy has never won anything in his life, unlike Bono. However, Bono angrily refuses to be \\"number two\\" at anything. Bono's butler reveals to Stan that his father's life is in danger if he takes a larger crap. As they race to Z√ºrich, the butler explains that the reason why Randy will die is because no one has ever defecated that much before. Stan asks how Bono managed to defecate so much and not die, and the butler informs him of the truth ‚Äì Bono set his record in 1960, the year he was born; Bono is not the record holder, he is the record itself. Everybody is gathered in Z√ºrich, where the institute's leader explains he produced the world's biggest crap in 1960 and was so proud, he raised it as a child. Over time, it grew up into Bono, explaining why Bono can help so many people through his humanitarian work while still seeming \\"like such a piece of shit.\\" Bono's father says that even though Bono faked his newest record, Bono himself is over 80 courics in weight, and thus is still bigger than Randy's old record or any other feces in the world. At that moment, Randy finally produces a bowel movement so large it lifts him several feet off the toilet seat and is estimated to weigh more than 100 courics. Randy is hailed as the new record holder, as an institute member pulls the \\"advertisement\\" Emmy image off the screen and presents it to Randy by lodging it in his feces. Production and themes In the emotional elements of its plot, \\"More Crap\\" is based on the 2007 documentary The King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters. The documentary follows Steve Wiebe as he tries to take the world high score for the arcade game Donkey Kong from reigning champion Billy Mitchell. In the documentary, Wiebe beats the record but is suspected that his machine may have been tampered with. To prove his gaming skills, Wiebe performs the high score live, in front of an audience, but then is trumped by a low-quality VHS tape sent in by Mitchell, depicting himself achieving a higher score. Bono's personality in the episode is much like the depiction of Mitchell in the documentary, including how he is allowed to play by different rules than other competitors. South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone spoke highly of the documentary, and called it a \\"really well-done movie\\". South Park has a history of using toilet humor from its earliest days, such as the recurring character Mr. Hankey, a talking piece of feces. While the series gained reputation for its use of political humor as it progressed, scatological humor still remained to be a staple in its later seasons. \\"More Crap\\" was named as \\"perhaps most poo-centric episode of all time\\". In the episode, women ‚Äì such as Randy's wife Sharon ‚Äì are constantly portrayed as not understanding the pride men can feel for the size of their feces. This has been viewed as a conscious sign of the creators' awareness that such toilet humor is more appealing to men. This female‚Äìmale divide in the appreciation of toilet humor was further satirized in the thirteenth season episode \\"Eat, Pray, Queef\\". Randy's love for his growing excrement is portrayed at one point in an analogy of a mother's love for her unborn child. In the scene, Randy's clinician shows him his \\"unborn\\" feces via medical ultrasonography, and warns him against travelling by airplane, as he is in his \\"turd trimester\\" ‚Äì a pun on the third period of pregnancy. \\"More Crap\\" was written and directed by Trey Parker, and was produced and broadcast as the second episode of the second run of the show's eleventh season, after the season premiere, \\"Le Petit Tourette\\". The episode originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on October 10, 2007, and is rated TV-MA L. The episode features regular voice acting from Parker and Stone for most characters (with Parker doing the voice for Randy and Stan), as well as April Stewart and Mona Marshall for female voices. South Park staff writer Kyle McCulloch also provided his voice to the episode as Bono himself. Cultural references Singer, musician and humanitarian Bono was parodied in \\"More Crap\\" \\"More Crap\\" satirizes Irish singer, musician, and philanthropist Bono, best known for being the main vocalist of the rock band U2. Bono is portrayed as obsessed with being the best at everything and winning awards, and is criticized for not letting others claim success over him. Stan makes remarks about Bono's wealth and knighthood, as well as his highly successful band, and his \\"hot wife\\", Alison Hewson. The episode also shows Bono in Africa at one point, and makes reference to his numerous accolades, including his 22 Grammy Awards, and his nominations for an Academy Award, a Golden Globe Award, and the Nobel Peace Prize. In a joke, Bono is revealed to have first-place trophies in much smaller scale categories as well, such as \\"most Sports Illustrated subscriptions sold\\". In the episode, people claim that Bono is both \\"talented\\" and \\"caring\\", being \\"able to do so much, try to help so many people\\", but, despite all of this, he \\"seem like such a piece of crap\\". As the plot progresses, this problem is explained when the comparison between Bono and feces moves from metaphorical to literal, as he is revealed to be an actual piece of excrement raised as a human. As such, Bono's obsession with being number one is his way of compensating for being born \\"number two\\" ‚Äì a euphemism for feces. Near the end of the episode, when Bono is breastfed by his father, they both refer to the breast milk as \\"bitty\\". This is an allusion to the British character-based comedy sketch show Little Britain, in which the character Harvey constantly insists on receiving \\"bitty\\" from his mother's breast, despite being an adult. \\"More Crap\\" aired about a month after South Park received a Creative Arts Emmy Award for \\"Outstanding Animated Program (for Programming Less Than One Hour)\\" that year, at the 59th Primetime Emmy Awards for the episode \\"Make Love Not Warcraft\\". The show makes fun of having won the award, by way of a running gag in \\"More Crap\\". Several times during the episode ‚Äì such as when Randy is looking at the excrement inside of him through an ultrasound image ‚Äì a caption appears on- screen, with a spinning Emmy Award along with the text \\"Emmy Award Winning Series\\". Reception TV Squad gave the episode a highly positive review, stating that \\"it's low taste but it's South Park low taste, which makes it funny\\", and said that the creators are \\"still on a roll. Possibly a toilet paper roll.\\" IGN had mixed feelings about the episode, calling it \\"amusing, but not terribly so\\", and \\"both bizarre and pretty damn funny\\". The site gave the episode a rating of 7.4 out of 10. Trey Parker and Matt Stone both professed their love of the episode, but said that it is a polarizing one for the audience, claiming that if a viewer is not on board with the episode's toilet humor, then the whole episode breaks down for them. The creators claimed that young people and women reacted poorly to the episode. Parker said that his father, who is the basis for Randy's character, was very thrilled by the episode. The crew of The King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters was flattered by the episode's plot being based on their documentary. Director Seth Gordon said that they \\"considered it such a flattering compliment that would even consider borrowing the structure of King of Kong for one of their episodes.\\" He added that he didn't think the episode was fair to Bono. The film's producer, Ed Cunningham, is a fan of South Park, and said that \\"hear about South Park that they actually spoofed the whole movie just blew away.\\" The makers eventually got in touch with the South Park studios. P. F. Chang's China Bistro spokesperson Laura Cherry responded positively to the episode, and added that the restaurant chain's name has been used several times in the series. A Comedy Central spokeswoman said that the show's creators love the restaurant's food, and \\"have no bad experiences with P.F. Chang's to report\\". After the episode, a fan-created website for the fictional European Fecal Standards and Measurements Institute appeared on the Internet. It is presented as the official website of the institute, with distinct pages describing its work and organization structure. In accord with the episode, the site names Randy Marsh as the current record-holder, but it also claims that the record's previous holder was President of the European Council Herman Van Rompuy, who \\"is still considered one of the most prolific faecal producers.\\" Van Rompuy was not referenced in the South Park episode.

The track has been run by the city's fire department since 1903. Racing occurs every Sunday approximately Memorial Day until Labor Day. Special racing events and the weather may alter the schedule. The races were sanctioned by the Badger Midget Auto Racing Association (BMARA), the oldest midget organization in the world. Some events are co-sanctioned by the United States Automobile Club (USAC). BMARA sanctions several midget car events at other nearby tracks. The World of Outlaws held their first sprint car races at the track in August 2016. National Midget Auto Racing Hall of Fame building in turn 1 In addition to the racetrack, the facility features the National Midget Auto Racing Hall of Fame, a pavilion, and the Sun Prairie Firemans Park in the Prairie. The park was built by the Sun Prairie community on September 18, 2007 and was dedicated on October 7, 2007. The project was led by Sun Prairie residents Rebecca Ketelson and Anita Holcomb. Leather's and Associates was the project architect. History The track is nationally known for its midget car races, which began racing in 1936. As of the 2008 season, it is the only track in the United States to host weekly midget car races. The track was closed between 1942 and 1945, since all racing in the United States was halted during World War II. Night racing at Angell Park began May 29, 1949. With the lights installed, Kelly Peters of Lake Forest, IL set fast time, won his heat and captured the first feature race run under the lights. From that point forward, weekly Sunday night racing has been held at the facility except for a few shortened seasons for minor contract disputes in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The track began hosting its first non-midget car races in 2007 when an occasional touring event was added to its program and by 2010 every race evening featured a class from another track or a touring series. The Angell Park Speedway board and the sanctioning body BMARA had a fall out before the 2010 season. The track ran its own sanction during May 2010. At the end of the month weekly track operation halted for the 2010 season except for special events (two USAC midget weekends and the Fireman's Nationals). Notable racers Some midget car drivers come from New Zealand and Australia during their country's winter to race during the United States' summer between May and September. The 2008 season featured Michael Pickens from Auckland, New Zealand (who stayed at one of the other driver's house) and Matt Smith from Newcastle, Australia.

The current Municipal office is located on the 2nd floor of the Unnayan Bhavan Complex in Jorhat, Assam.  Background  The Jorhat Municipal Board, an urban administrative body, began its operations in 1909. Its goals are aimed at providing for the welfare of residents of Jorhat, the second largest city of Assam, a northeastern state within Guwahati of India (located specifically at 26 degrees North, 94 degrees East). Jorhat was previously the capital of the Ahom Kingdom in 1794. As a result of the Sarai Act of 1867, which banned sarais, temporary shelters for travelers whose identities and backgrounds were unknown to the state, from housing anymore of those travelers without keeping records, a union board emerged to enforce local governing and maintenance. In 1909, this board became the Jorhat Municipal Board, led by President Lt. Col. A. Playfair. It provided for an area ranging about 5 square kilometers, 15 wards, and a population of nearly 5,000. Now, the Board's range has extended to a total of 9 square kilometers, 19 wards, and a steadily growing population reaching over 1 million residents of Jorhat.

The primate of the province is Laurent Mbanda, consecrated on 10 June 2018. Official names The Province of the Anglican Church of Rwanda was also known by its French name, Province de L'Eglise Anglicane au Rwanda. The former name of the province, Province de L'Eglise Episcopal au Rwanda, was changed by action of an extraordinary meeting of the Provincial Synod at St. √âtienne, Biryogo, on November 29, 2007.Provincial Synod Approves Name-change Resolution, December 12, 2007, The Anglican Communion Official Website The province changed his name once again to Anglican Church of Rwanda in a decision taken at their Synod, in September 2019. Archbishop Laurent Mbanda, in an official letter as vice chairman of GAFCON, explained the decision: \\"Removing the word ‚ÄòProvince‚Äô is a significant change. We are not subjects. Some want us to accept that it is essential to being Anglican that you are recognised by Canterbury, but we find our identity first and foremost through our Biblical and Anglican doctrinal inheritance in Christ. The Jerusalem Statement and Declaration of 2008 concluded ‚ÄòWe can only come to the devastating conclusion that ‚Äòwe are a global Communion with a colonial structure‚Äô‚Äô. We seek only to be a colony of heaven!\\"Vice Chairman's September Letter, GAFCON Official Website, 30 September 2019 History The Province of the Anglican Church of Rwanda traces its roots to two missionary doctors of the British Church Missionary Society, Arthur Stanely Smith and Leonard Sharp, coming from Kabale, in Uganda, which began a mission movement in the Eastern area of Gisaka, in Rwanda, from 1914 to 1916. They would reach Rukira in 1922. Geoffrey Holmes, a captain from the British Army, would start an Anglican mission in Gahini, in 1925. In 1926, Harold Guillebaud baptised the first converts at Gahini. He also would translate Christian books into Kinyarwanda. In the following years, other Anglican missions where created, like the one started by Geoffrey Holmes in Kigeme, in 1931. Only after the independence of Rwanda from Belgium, in 1962, the Anglican Church of Rwanda was created, in 1965, under the Province of Rwanda, Burundi and Boga Zaire. The first Diocese was initiated in 1966, having Adony Sebununguri as the first Bishop of Rwanda. The name of Anglican Church of Rwanda (√âglise Anglicane au Rwanda) was adopted on 18 October 1979, still at the Province of Rwanda, Burundi and Boga Zaire. On 7 June 1992, the Province of the Episcopal Church of Rwanda in the Anglican Communion was formed, consisting of seven dioceses, Kigali, Butare, Shyira, Byumba, Cyangugu, Kigeme and Shyogwe with the first Archbishop being Augustin Nshamihigo. In 1998, he was succeeded by Archbishop Emmanuel Kolini, who would be in office until 2011. The 1994 genocide and war left the Church and the nation in ruins. Since peace has returned, the Church has embarked on a program of spiritual healing for thousands of traumatised people. Kigali Anglican Theological College (KATC) was started in February 2006 as a response to the training needs of the Anglican Church of Rwanda in post Genocide Rwanda and is staffed by pastors from several home dioceses, local staff, one CMS Britain Mission Partner and a number of visiting lecturers from partners from the UK and the USA. The college states that it strives to provide quality Christian training to the next generation of Christian leaders for Rwanda and, in turn, to assist in the development of the whole country. The School of Theology was the first to open in the custom-built buildings situated in an area of new development not far from Kigali. A Language School was opened in 2006 to meet the language needs of Francophone students who had to study in English. In 2008, there were around 40 students studying in both the School of Theology and the Language School. Membership Today, there are over one million Anglicans, out of an estimated population of 12 million (2013),12,012,589 (July 2013 nach CIA factbook) www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/rw.html making it one of the largest Christian denominations in Rwanda. Structure The polity of the Anglican Church of Rwanda is Episcopal church governance, which is the same as the other Anglican churches. The church maintains a system of geographical parishes organized into 11 dioceses, each one headed by a bishop. The dioceses are currently: * Butare * Byumba * Cyangugu * Gahini * Gasabo * Kibungo * Kigali * Kigeme * Kivu * Shyira * Shyogwe Archbishop of Rwanda The Archbishop of Rwanda is both Metropolitan and Primate. Holders of the office have been: *Augustin Nshamihigo, 1992-1995 *Emmanuel Kolini, 1998‚Äì2011 *Onesphore Rwaje, 2011-2018 *Laurent Mbanda, 2018‚Äìpresent Worship and liturgy The Province of the Anglican Church of Rwanda embraces three orders of ministry: deacon, priest, and bishop. A local variant of the Book of Common Prayer is used. Doctrine and practice The center of the Church teaching is the life and resurrection of Jesus Christ. The basic teachings of the church, or catechism, include: *Jesus Christ is fully human and fully God. He died and was resurrected from the dead. *Jesus provides the way of eternal life for those who believe. *The Old and New Testaments of the Bible were written by people \\"under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit\\". The Apocrypha are additional books that are used in Christian worship, but not for the formation of doctrine. *The two great and necessary sacraments are Holy Baptism and Holy Eucharist. *Other sacramental rites are confirmation, ordination, marriage, reconciliation of a penitent, and unction. *Belief in heaven, hell, and Jesus's return in glory. The threefold sources of authority in Anglicanism are scripture, tradition, and reason. These three sources uphold and critique each other in a dynamic way. This balance of scripture, tradition and reason is traced to the work of Richard Hooker, a sixteenth-century apologist. In Hooker's model, scripture is the primary means of arriving at doctrine and things stated plainly in scripture are accepted as true. Issues that are ambiguous are determined by tradition, which is checked by reason.Anglican Listening Detail on how scripture, tradition, and reason work to \\"uphold and critique each other in a dynamic way\\". =Ecumenical relations = Unlike many other Anglican churches, the Anglican Church of Rwanda is not a member of the ecumenical World Council of Churches.http://www.oikoumene.org/?id=3587 World Council of Churches Anglican realignment The Anglican Church of Rwanda is a member of the Global South (Anglican) and the Global Anglican Future Conference, and has been involved in the Anglican realignment. Their opposition to departures from the conservative Anglican faith taken in North America led them to start a missionary organization, the Anglican Mission in the Americas, in the United States and Canada, and to support the creation of the Anglican Church in North America, of which the Anglican Mission in the Americas was a founding member, in June 2009. The AMiA changed its status to ministry partner in 2010, which it was until December 2011, when it disaffiliated from the Anglican Church of Rwanda. Archbishops Onesphore Rwaje and Robert Duncan of the Anglican Church in North America issued a Joint Communiqu√© on April 28, 2012, to address the future of the AMiA.

History Four of the five dioceses of the Iglesia Anglicana de la Regi√≥n Central de America were founded by the Episcopal Church in the United States of America. Anglicanism was also introduced by the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel when the United Kingdom administered two colonies in Central America, British Honduras and Miskitia. In later years, immigrants brought the Anglican Church with them. This first period is often called the time of the chaplaincies. Bishop William C. Frey was consecrated as the first missionary bishop of the Diocese of Guatemala in 1967. By 2008, the Anglican Church in Central America had voted to consecrate women bishops although none of have been consecrated as of yet. By 2013, the Diocese of El Salvador offered ministries on behalf of and in support of LGBT members. Julio Murray, Bishop of Panama, was elected as Primate in April 2018 and took office with his installation on 11 August, succeeding Sturdie Downs, Bishop of Nicaragua. Downs was elected in late 2014 to serve a four-year term of office as primate (2015‚Äì2019); he succeeded Armando Guerra, Bishop of Guatemala (2011‚Äì2015), who in turn succeeded Martin Barahona, Bishop of El Salvador (2003‚Äì2011). Membership Today, there are over 35,000 Anglicans out of an estimated population of 30.1 million. Structure The polity of the Iglesia Anglicana de la Regi√≥n Central de Am√©rica is Episcopalian church governance, which is the same as other Anglican churches. The church maintains a system of geographical parishes organized into dioceses. There are 5 of these, each headed by a bishop: * The Diocese of Costa Rica * The Diocese of El Salvador * The Diocese of Guatemala * The Diocese of Nicaragua * The Diocese of Panam√° Some countries of Central America are part of other Anglican churches: * The Anglican Diocese of Belize is part of the Church in the Province of the West Indies * The Episcopal Diocese of Honduras is part of Province 9 of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America Worship and liturgy The Iglesia Anglicana de la Regi√≥n Central de Am√©rica embraces three orders of ministry: deacon, priest, and bishop. The Spanish-language version of the Episcopal Church (USA)'s 1979 Book of Common Prayer is used. Doctrine and practice The center of the Iglesia Anglicana de la Regi√≥n Central de Am√©rica's teaching is the life and resurrection of Jesus Christ. The basic teachings of the church, or catechism, includes: *Jesus Christ is fully human and fully God. He died and was resurrected from the dead. *Jesus provides the way of eternal life for those who believe. *The Old and New Testaments of the Bible were written by people \\"under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit\\". The Apocrypha are additional books that are used in Christian worship, but not for the formation of doctrine. *The two great and necessary sacraments are Holy Baptism and Holy Eucharist *Other sacramental rites are confirmation, ordination, marriage, reconciliation of a penitent, and unction. *Belief in heaven, hell, and Jesus' return in glory. =Ecumenical relations= Unlike many other Anglican churches, the Iglesia Anglicana de la Regi√≥n Central de Am√©rica is not a member of the ecumenical World Council of Churches.http://www.oikoumene.org/?id=3587 World Council of Churches = Ordination of women = Within the province, the dioceses represent a diversity of opinions on social issues. Regarding gender equality, the province has dioceses, including the Episcopal Church of Costa Rica, that recognize women in ordained ministry. In 2012, the Episcopal Church in Nicaragua ordained two women as priests. = Human sexuality = In 2003, the Primate, or Presiding Bishop, of the Anglican Church in Central America attended the consecration of Bishop Gene Robinson, the first openly gay and partnered bishop in the Anglican Communion. The Diocese of El Salvador formed a ministry for LGBT people in the country. In 2014, the Episcopal Church of Costa Rica, a diocese of the province, has taken steps to welcome LGBT members. Also in 2014, the diocese in El Salvador continued to offer a space for LGBT members to \\"freely express themselves.\\" The Diocese of Guatemala elected the Rev Silvestre Enrique Romero as bishop coadjutor in 2017. The Rev Romero, prior to being elected bishop, served in The Episcopal Church (US) and offered to bless same-sex unions as priest-in-charge.

The bioregion covers the southern portion of Mexico, all of Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua, and all but easternmost Panama. WWF defines bioregions as \\"geographic clusters of ecoregions that may span several habitat types, but have strong biogeographic affinities, particularly at taxonomic levels higher than the species level (genus, family).\\" The bioregion lies in the tropics, and is home to tropical moist broadleaf forests, tropical dry broadleaf forests, and tropical coniferous forests. The higher mountains are home to cool-climate montane forests, grasslands and shrublands. Central America connects North America to South America. The land bridge was completed 2.8 million years ago, when the Isthmus of Panama was formed, linking the two continents for the first time in tens of millions of years. The resulting Great American Interchange of animals and plants shaped the flora and fauna of the Central America bioregion. Large mammals include the white-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari), Baird's tapir (Tapirus bairdii), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), Central American red brocket (Mazama temama), Yucatan brown brocket (Mazama pandora), giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla), brown-throated sloth (Bradypus variegatus), jaguar (Panthera onca), cougar (Puma concolor), and ocelot (Leopardus pardalis). Plants of South American origin came to dominate the tropical lowlands of Central America, as did South American freshwater fish and invertebrates. 95% of Central American freshwater fish are South American in origin, with only the Tropical gar (Atractosteus tropicus), three clupeids (Dorosoma), a catostomid (Ictiobus), and an ictalurid (Ictalurus) of North American origin.Flannery, Tim (2001).

Definitions of the term somewhat vary, with one author defining it as \\"where God decides to become malevolent\\". The broad theme of dystheism has existed for millennia, as shown by trickster gods found in polytheistic belief systems and by the view of other representations of supreme beings (such as those of the Abrahamic religions, particularly the Old Testament) through a nonreligious lens as angry, vengeful and smiting. The modern concept dates back many decades, with the Victorian era figure Algernon Charles Swinburne writing in his work Anactoria about the ancient Greek poet Sappho and her lover Anactoria in explicitly dystheistic imagery that includes cannibalism and sadomasochism. Background and details The concept has been used frequently in popular culture and is a part of several religious traditions in the world. Trickster gods found in polytheistic belief systems often have a dystheistic nature. One example is Eshu, a trickster god from Yoruba mythology who deliberately fostered violence between groups of people for his own amusement, saying that \\"causing strife is my greatest joy.\\" Another example is the Norse Loki, though Odin has these qualities as well. Zoroastrianism involves belief in an ongoing struggle between a creator god of goodness (Ahura Mazda) and a destroying god of hatred (Angra Mainyu), neither of which is omnipotent, which is a form of dualistic cosmology. The Greek god Ares, depending on time and region, was associated with all the horrors of war. Dystheists may themselves be theists or atheists, and in the case of either, concerning the nature of the God of Abrahamic faiths, will assert that God is not good, and is possibly, although not necessarily, malevolent, particularly (but not exclusively) to those who do not wish to follow that faith. For example, in his Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God (1741), Jonathan Edwards, a revivalist preacher, describes a god full of vengeful rage and contempt. However, Edwards' theology presumes a God whose vengeance and contempt are directed toward evil and its manifestation in fallen humanity. To Edwards, a deity that ignores moral corruption or shows indifference to evil would be closer to the deity espoused by dystheism, that is, evil, because justice is an extension of love and moral goodness. One particular view of dystheism, an atheistic approach, is summarized by the prominent revolutionary philosopher Mikhail Bakunin, who wrote in God and the State that \\"if God really existed, it would be necessary to abolish him\\". Bakunin argued that, as a \\"jealous lover of human liberty, and deeming it the absolute condition of all that we admire and respect in humanity\\", the \\"idea of God\\" constitutes metaphysical oppression of the idea of human choice. This argument is an inversion of Voltaire's phrase \\"If God did not exist, it would be necessary for man to invent Him\\". Political theorist and activist Thomas Paine similarly wrote in The Age of Reason, \\"Whenever we read the obscene stories, the voluptuous debaucheries, the cruel and torturous executions, the unrelenting vindictiveness, with which more than half the Bible is filled, it would be more consistent that we called it the word of a demon, than the word of God.\\" He added, \\"It is a history of wickedness, that has served to corrupt and brutalize mankind; and, for my part, I sincerely detest it, as I detest everything that is cruel.\\" Unlike Bakunin, however, Paine's condemnation of the purported nature of the divine from his time didn't extent to outright atheism and disbelief in all spirituality, Paine stating that he accepted the deistic notion of an almighty mover behind all things. Usage in popular culture Dystheism as a concept, although often not labeled as such, has been referred to in many aspects of popular culture. As stated before, related ideas date back many decades, with the Victorian era figure Algernon Charles Swinburne writing in his work Anactoria about the ancient Greek poet Sappho and her lover Anactoria in explicitly dystheistic imagery that includes cannibalism and sadomasochism. More recent examples include the popular Star Trek television series. Fictional character Worf claims that his race, the Klingons, have no gods, because they killed them centuries ago for being \\"more trouble than they were worth.\\" See also * Evil demon * Demiurge * God as the Devil * God and the State * Misotheism * Problem of hell References Category:Conceptions of God Category:Theism ","title":"Dystheism"},{"id":"13627837","text":"Dieter Seebach is a German chemist known for his synthesis of biopolymers and dendrimers, and for his contributions to stereochemistry.

History Formal Anglican structures were established in Boga-Zaire from the 1930s. Metropolitical authority came from the Archbishop of Canterbury until in 1965 the 'Province of Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, and Boga-Zaire' was established. Following expansion, Uganda became an independent province, leaving the rest of the region as the 'Province of Rwanda, Burundi, and Zaire'. In 1992 the three countries of the united Province each gained independence under their own individual Metropolitan Archbishop, and the Church of the Province of Zaire came into existence. Their first Archbishop was Patrice Njojo. In 1997, to reflect the change in name of the nation, the church became known as the Province of the Anglican Church of the Congo. Archbishop Njojo was succeeded by Fid√®le Dirokpa in 2003, who held office until 2009. The Most Rev. Henri Isingoma was elected the third Archbishop of the Congo on April 28, 2009. Most of the Congolese Anglicans lives in the eastern Swahili speaking region of the country, the most damaged part of Congo due to two civil wars. The Diocese of Kinshasa also includes part of the Republic of the Congo. Archbishop of the Congo The Archbishop of the Congo, known as Zaire until 1997, is both Metropolitan and Primate.

In June 2012, Archbishop Henri Isingoma attended the Provincial Assembly of the Anglican Church in North America, in Ridgecrest, North Carolina, to show is full support for the new province in creation of the Anglican Communion. On April 29, 2012, Henri Isingoma expressed his official approval for the temporary admission of the Anglican Mission in the Americas, a former missionary organization of the Anglican Church of Rwanda, at the Anglican Church of Congo until his future was clarified.

He achieved great popularity during his life and much of his work appeared in calendars, magazines and books. Life Elsley was born in London, one of six children of John Elsley, coachman and amateur artist, and Emily Freer. Elsley's father had exhibited at the British Institution Exhibition in 1845 but later in life contracted tuberculosis which forced him into early retirement.The British Institution in Pall Mall was founded on 4 June 1805 for promoting the Fine Arts in the United Kingdom. When only eleven years old, Arthur was turning out proficient animal studies made during frequent visits to the London Zoo in Regent's Park. At age fourteen, he enrolled in the South Kensington School of Art (later the Royal College of Art). At about this time his eyesight became permanently damaged by a bout of measles. Elsley took up the post of probationer at the Royal Academy Schools in 1876. here he was influenced by Frederick Pickersgill (Keeper of the Royal Academy), Edward Armitage (Professor of Painting), John Marshal (Professor of Anatomy), and Henry Bowler (Professor of Perspective). A large number of his paintings were inspired by sketches made on frequent cycling trips around the countryside. In 1878 he exhibited his first picture, entitled \\"A Portrait of an Old Pony\\" at the Royal Academy. He remained with the Academy Schools until 1882 and then began accepting commissions to do portraits of children and dogs, with an emphasis on horses.Many of his portrait commissions came from the Benett-Stanford family of politicians living at Preston Manor in Brighton‚Äîsome works are still exhibited there. His first known published work was a line engraving entitled \\"April Floods In Eastern Counties\\" printed in \\"Young England\\" magazine in 1885. Elsley was friendly with the English painters Solomon Joseph Solomon and George Grenville Manton, sharing a studio with the latter in 1876. Through Manton Elsley met Frederick Morgan, a popular painter of children. In 1889 Elsley moved into Morgan‚Äôs studio, an arrangement that led to a good working relationship - Morgan having difficulties with painting animals, an area in which Elsley excelled. Elsley was awarded a silver medal in the Crystal Palace exhibition of 1891 for his painting \\"The Bailiff‚Äôs Daughter of Islington\\". In 1892 his painting \\"I'se Biggest\\" was published, and later had to be re-engraved to satisfy public demand. The painting was of a young girl comparing her height with that of a large St. Bernard dog. The Illustrated London News printed one of Elsley‚Äôs paintings, Grandfather‚Äôs Pet as their Christmas choice for 1893. On 11 November 1893 Elsley married Emily \\"Emm\\" Fusedale, his second cousin who had modeled for him for ten years. They had one child, Marjorie, born in 1903, and who posed for many of his subsequent paintings. After his marriage Elsley set up his own studio, but continued his painting relationship with Frederick Morgan. After the death of Charles Burton Barber (1845‚Äì1894), Elsley became his natural successor as the foremost painter of children and their pets. Relations between Elsley and Frederick Morgan were permanently soured when Morgan accused Elsley of using his ideas. After this Elsley became bolder in his compositions, often depicting scenes with multiple figures, all from individual sitters visiting his studio. Hardly ever leaving his studio, the outdoors components of his paintings were from sketches he had made earlier and magazine images. It was thought that these indoor painting methods aggravated his already faulty vision. The First World War severely reduced Elsley's output of paintings - he produced only 4 paintings from 1915 to 1917, one of which, a portrait of his daughter Marjorie, was exhibited at the Royal Academy. He contributed to the war effort by working on bomb-sights in a munitions factory, straining his already poor eyesight. By the early 1930s he was able only to carry out woodworking and gardening. Arthur John Elsley died at home in Tunbridge Wells on 19 February 1952. Work At the height of his career from 1878 to 1927, Elsley exhibited 52 works at the Royal Academy. However, many more were shown at exhibition halls throughout the country: The Royal Society of British Artists, Royal Institute of Oil Painters, French Gallery, Dudley Gallery and Crystal Palace in London; The Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool; The Institute of Fine Art, Glasgow; Manchester City Art Gallery; The Royal Society of Artists, Birmingham; Nottingham Castle Museum; Victoria Art Gallery, Bath; The International Exhibition in Cork Ireland (1902‚Äì03). His prints were used commercially by many firms such as calendars by Thomas D. Murphy Co., Sunlight Soap, Brook's Sewing Cottons, Peek Freans biscuits & cakes; and Bibby‚Äôs Quarterly (an illustrated journal of country and home life). His paintings were also used in advertising materials distributed by A&F; Pears, for instance as prints in the Pear's Annual (published each year at Christmas). Currently Elsley's work can be seen at the Russell-Cotes Art Gallery & Museum in Bournemouth, in the collections of \\"Hartlepool Museums and Heritage Service\\", at Lady Lever Art Gallery in Port Sunlight, Liverpool, Royal Liverpool Children‚Äôs Hospital in Liverpool and the \\"Royal Pavilion Art Gallery and Museum\\", Preston Manor, 194 Preston Road, Brighton.

He succeeded his father Mohiddin Badusha I. Background Dr. Umar Alisha actively participated in the Khilafat Movement, a unique battle against the British rulers, waged with Gandhi caps in the early 1920s by the students of the Victoria Diamond Jubilee Medical School, which later became the Andhra Medical College. It all started on 19 September 1921 when one of the students came to the classroom sporting the khadi cap. He was incensed like his compatriots of those days over the arrest of the freedom-fighter Maulana Mohammad Ali at the Waltair (now Visakhapatnam) railway station on 1921-09-14. Mohammed Ali, one of the famed Ali Brothers (the other was Maulana Shaukat Ali) was proceeding to Madras along with Mahatma Gandhi by the Howrah-Madras Mail. Both the leaders alighted at the station packed with a lot of people and policemen. As soon as Mohammed Ali got down from the train, a shivering Superintendent of Police served the arrest warrant on Ali and whisked him away to Central Jail. Gandhi addressed the gathering and continued his journey to Madras. While in jail, Ali was visited by local Congress leaders, including P.C. Venkatapathi Raju and Vasantarao Butchisundara Rao. Soon a public meeting was held on the beach where loads of foreign clothes were burnt. Umar Alisha, a Telugu poet, made a speech against the arrest of the Khilafat movement leader. On the morning of 17 September 1921, Ali was taken to the Waltair station from jail with a police escort for his departure to Karachi.

NEH Chairman Barrie Berkley introduces the philosopher A.C. Grayling at the NEH 50th anniversary lecture. The Tyneside Group of the North East Humanists (NEH) was founded on 17 September 1957, although organised secularism in North East England had been active from the 1860s. The group adopted the name North East Humanists in 1997, after merging with the Teesside Humanist group. NEH is a registered charity, consisting of over 200 members, and is the largest regional Humanist group in the United Kingdom. The group is involved in a wide range of activities including: working with school teachers to deliver lessons about Humanism in the RE curriculum, providing pastoral support in local hospitals and prisons, hosting events where invited speakers talk about a wide variety of topics, and numerous social events for members. In common with the basic principles of Humanism, the NEH is concerned with values and moral issues from a non-religious viewpoint and with the achievement of a more open, just, and caring society. To mark the 50th anniversary of the foundation of the NEH, the group held a joint lecture with Newcastle University. On 4 October 2007 A. C. Grayling gave a lecture on 'Reason and the Good', in which he explored the view (rooted in Aristotelian thinking) that reflection and choice, both expressions of the exercise of reason, are essential to the good life, underlying both the meaning we give to it and the value we find in it. History Neil Jenkins, co-author of 'Modern Humanism' and NEH President 1970-2007. The first meeting of the Tyneside Humanist Group, later to become NEH, was attended by ten people and was held on 17 September 1957 in Kirkstone Gardens, Newcastle upon Tyne. Mr F. R. Griffin addressed the meeting about his attendance at the Second Congress of the International Humanist and Ethical Union (IHEU) in London, and he moved that the ten people present constitute the Tyneside Humanist Group. This motion was seconded by Mr J.W. Alexander and carried unanimously. On 22 October 1957, the first of a series of ten fortnightly lectures began at Cowan House in the University of Durham, with a lecture by Mr G. Leith on Philosophy. In April 1958 it was decided to arrange a programme of speakers which would include group members. An annual membership fee of 2 shillings and 6 pence was decided upon, with regular members contributing 1 shilling a week, and a fee for visitors. In October 1958, Mr F. R. Griffin began a series of twelve fortnightly lectures at the British Legion Social Club on the Great North Road in Newcastle upon Tyne, where meetings were held until 16 December of that year. The first annual general meeting of the group was held here in May 1959, by which point there were 21 paid-up members. In November 1959 the group agreed to send a ¬£1 affiliation fee to the International Humanist and Ethical Union. The group began to organise various social events including theatre visits, and social evenings with games, films, prizes and gramophone record recitals. In 1970, the Tyneside Humanist Society were holding meetings at The Friends‚Äô Meeting House in Jesmond, Newcastle upon Tyne. Neil Jenkins was President of the group with Alfred Hobson as Chairman, and both went on to author the book Modern Humanism in 1989. By 1993, membership of the group had increased to 60 members. At the annual general meeting of 1993, it was suggested that the group assume the title of North East Regional Humanist Association, continuing to operate as the Tyneside Group but prepared to act also as the Regional Association if requested. In the spring of 1995, the first North East Humanist Newsletter was published. In the summer of 1995, a Teesside Humanist Group was formed as a branch of the Tyneside Group. In the autumn of 1995, a motion was carried to change the group name to North East Humanists, incorporating both the Tyneside Humanist Group and the Teesside Humanist Group. Humanism in the North East continued to expand, with the paid- up membership of the group at 114 by the beginning of 1996. By the summer of 1998, membership exceeded 150. The first NEH regional conference was held on 12 May 2000 at Durham Castle, with Prof. David Cooper of the Durham University Philosophy Department as the keynote speaker. The group also launched a website this year. To mark the 50th anniversary of the foundation of the NEH, the group held a joint lecture with Newcastle University. On 4 October 2007 A. C. Grayling gave a lecture on 'Reason and the Good', in which he explored the view (rooted in Aristotelian thinking) that reflection and choice, both expressions of the exercise of reason, are essential to the good life, underlying both the meaning we give to it and the value we find in it. Activities North East Humanists hosts monthly events in Newcastle upon Tyne featuring talks and discussions on ethical and social issues with visiting speakers. The group occasionally holds one-day regional conferences on Humanist subjects. Group members receive a monthly bulletin which includes articles, a programme of events, and matters of current interest. A wide range of social events are organised for both members and non-members. Beliefs The main beliefs of the North East Humanists are: # We only live once ‚Äî Humanists have a positive, realistic attitude towards life. Our life here is the only one we will ever have: it is up to us to give it purpose and to make it the best that we can. # The universe has evolved over eons, without a creator or plan ‚Äî Humanists believe that human beings are part of an evolutionary process that began billions of years ago, and that there is no god or gods behind this process. # The welfare of people and the planet is our moral responsibility ‚Äî Humanists have concern for the well-being of all of humankind and for the health of our worldwide ecological environment. Humanists support every opportunity to cooperate with others to face the problems of the world. # Right behaviour is based on reason, respect, and reciprocity ‚Äî Morality is developed from reason and knowledge. It is not derived from a supernatural source but is the product of our experience as evolved social animals. Humanists take responsibility for their own conduct and believe that the underlying principle governing morality is that we should treat other people as we would wish to be treated. # Democratic values take precedence over ideologies ‚Äî Humanists are committed to a secular society. Whilst generally respecting the right of others to have different beliefs, Humanists challenge those beliefs and ideas which threaten the freedom of the individual. # Conflicts of interest require negotiated resolution ‚Äî Disputes at all levels from the personal to the international should be resolved through reasoned argument and negotiation, rather than through the use of power. # Artistic creativity and physical expression are key characteristics of humanity ‚Äî Humanists recognise that the arts, and the development and exercise of physical skills, meet the innate need in human beings for creativity and self-expression. Charitable work NEH became a registered charity in February 2006, their stated aims arehttps://www.northeast- humanists.org.uk/who-we-are/: * The advancement of Humanism, a non-religious ethical life-stance; * The advancement of public knowledge about humanist values and beliefs; * Promoting good fellowship and mutual care amongst humanists locally, regionally, nationally and internationally, fostering social interaction amongst them, and promoting social, intellectual and cultural ties between humanists and society at large; * Promoting charitable purposes, in particular, but not exclusively, charitable causes having values compatible with Humanism. The group has an established fund-raising committee which researches charitable causes compatible with Humanist thinking, and organises events to raise money for these charities and for the group‚Äôs own campaigns. =Isaac Newton High School= Staff and pupils at Isaac Newton High School. The group supports the Isaac Newton High School at Kateera Village near Masaka, Uganda. The school was founded by Peter Kisirinya, a member of the Uganda Humanist Association, which is part of the worldwide International Humanist and Ethical Union. He bought land and built the first two classrooms with funds donated by his family and friends. http://www.ugandahumanistschoolstrust.org/ A major aim of the school is to help disadvantaged children who cannot afford to pay fees for secondary education. These include orphans (many of whose parents died from HIV/AIDS), children in very poor families who cannot afford to pay fees and abandoned children who can be placed in foster homes around the school and can then receive education there. By 2006 the school had over 80 pupils, of whom only half could afford tuition fees. To facilitate the tuition of orphans and other disadvantaged children at the school, the NEH set up a fund which in 2006 raised ¬£2880 to support 24 students for a year. The school has also received a grant of ‚Ç¨10,000 for the construction of a science laboratory. These funds were obtained by Peter Kisirinya from IHEU, to which the NEH is affiliated, and the Humanist Institute for Development Cooperation (HIVOS). Fundraising for the school is ongoing, with money being raised through various charity events, such as quiz nights, bring and buy sales, coffee mornings, and countertop collections. Non-religious ceremonies In recognition of the fact that those who choose to live without religion still wish to publicly mark important events in their lives, the NEH will put people in touch with accredited officiants, known as celebrants, to conduct non-religious weddings, baby namings, same sex affirmations, and funerals.

The term is part of the vocabulary of Australian bushfire control and may also sometimes be known as a fireroad in US terminology. A fire trail may act as part of a control line or fire break but a fire trail in itself does not constitute a fire break. In California, where \\"fire trail\\" is the preferred term, it frequently refers to the unpaved roads built for wildfire control on undeveloped urban hills and foothills rather than those in rural regions. Local residents in urban communities such as San Diego County, Los Angeles County, and the East Bay use them for hiking. As fire trails provide access to otherwise remote areas, they suffer from adverse effects including: illegal activities, erosion, noise pollution, weed invasion, and stuck vehicles. As the fire trails are unpaved, contour banks are essential to control erosion and track degradation.

The genus is endemic to Australia. It was defined by the French botanist Jacques Labillardi√®re in his 1806 work Novae Hollandiae Plantarum Specimen. The genus name is derived from the Ancient Greek words come (\\"hair\\") and sperma (\\"seed\\"), and relates to the seeds bearing tufts of hair. The genus is distributed over southern Australia, particularly in the southwest of Western Australia, where 19 species are found. 24 species have been described. The genus was classified in the tribe Polygaleae by Swiss botanist Robert Hippolyte Chodat in 1896. It was also considered a section of the genus Bredemeyera by van Steenis in 1968. This was not adopted widely, and a cladistic study based on morphology published in 1993 suggested they remain as separate genera. This analysis placed Comersperma basal to a group comprising the genera Polygala, Monnina subg. Monninopsis, Nylandtia, Muralita and Epirixanthes. They are generally small shrubs, climbers or trailing plants, with small to vestigial leaves arranged alternately on the stem. The flowers resemble those of pea-flowers, and are borne in racemes. They are generally pink through shades of purple to blue in colour, although yellow-flowered species are known. Although the flowers are smaller than those of the related genus Polygala, the racemes can be showy, especially of floriferous species such as Comesperma ericinum. Comesperma ericinum and C. volubile are sometimes seen in cultivation.

Tributaries The principal tributaries of the Khwae Noi are the Om Sing River and the Fua River. Khwae Noi Dam Project In recent times, due to climate change, the river has flooded during rainy seasons and damaging valuable farmland and also carrying too much water into the Nan (of which it is a tributary), thereby causing further damage. During the dry season, the water level has been too low, causing drought and harming the agricultural communities in its proximity. As a result of increasing problems with the flow of the river, the royally-initiated Khwae Noi Dam Project was begun in Wat Bot. Construction of the dam was completed in 2008.

Shortly after the battle of the Nile, on 18 August 1798, she fell in with a smaller British ship of the line, of 50 guns. After a long battle, the G√©n√©reux captured the Leander, with the Leander suffering 35 killed and 57 wounded and the G√©n√©reux suffered around 100 killed and 180 wounded. In March 1799, G√©n√©reux escorted a convoy to Corfu. En route, her captain, Lejoille, decided to bombard Brindisi. He was killed in the ensuing exchange of fire, and lieutenant Claude Touffet took over. The city fell on 3 March after a two-hour battle.Dictionnaire des capitaines de vaisseau de Napol√©on, Danielle & Bernard Quintin, SPM, 2003, , p. 350 On 6 February 1800, G√©n√©reux, under Captain Renaudin,Fonds Marine, p.239 departed from Toulon leading a squadron comprising the frigate Badine, the corvettes Sans Pareille and Fauvette, and the fluyt Ville de Marseille, under Rear- Admiral Jean-Baptiste Perr√©e.

He lived in the 15th century. He was a follower of the Veerashaiva faith (devotee of the Hindu god Shiva), which he attempted to reconcile with the Advaita Hinduism of Adi Shankaracharya.Sahitya Akademi (1988), p. 1165 Tradition has it that Shivayogi was a petty chieftain of Kollegal taluk in modern Mysore district of Karnataka state, India. Considered a visionary of his time, his Vivekachintamani, written in encyclopaedic proportions and in prose style, and the Kaivalya Paddhati, a musical treatise consisting of songs are considered his most enduring works.Shiva Prakash (1997), p. 190 Writings The Vivekachintamani, written in ten chapters, characterises by subject over 1500 topics including astronomy, medicine, poetics, erotica, musicology and dance-drama (natya shastra). Each topic is divided into sub-topics and each sub-topic is further divided into items. For example, the topic of poetics includes a sub-topical description of alamkara (figures of speech) which includes 65 types of alamkaras. The writing was translated into Marathi language in 1604, and into Sanskrit language in 1652 and again in the 18th century, an indication of its importance among medieval Kannada language writings. Shivayogi authored a collection of songs in early 15th century called the Kaivalya Paddhati (lit, \\"Songs of the pathway to emancipation\\"). These songs are best described as lyrical swara Vachanas (poems written to notes) set to various classical ragas (\\"tunes\\"). They are based on religious, philosophical and reflective themes and are quite unlike those composed by the contemporary Haridasas (devotee-saint-poets of the god Vishnu) of Karnataka. This work established Shivayogi as the originator of a mystical form of literature called Kaivalya Sahitya (lit \\"Kaivalya literature\\"), a synthesis of the Veerashaiva and Advaita philosophies, with an emphasis on knowledge as opposed to devotion. His influence on writers in the swara Vachana genre over the next three centuries is evident. Notable poets who were inspired by Shivayogi include Shadaksharadeva (Muppina Sadakshari), a contemporary poet, Chidananda Avadhuta (17th century), Sarpabhushana Shivayogi (18th century) and the itinerant poet Shishunala Sharif.Sahitya Akademi (1987), p. 200 The Puratana Trividhi is a short work by him consisting of 77 tripadis (three-line verses) eulogising the 63 Nayanmars (devotee-saints of the Hindu god Shiva) of Tamil Nadu. His other compositions include Paramanubhava Bodhe, Paramartha Gita and Anubhavasara.

It is usually associated with diseases that may narrow the lumen of the esophagus, such as eosinophilic esophagitis, Schatzki rings, peptic strictures, webs, or cancers of the esophagus; rarely it can be seen in disorders of the movement of the esophagus, such as nutcracker esophagus. While some esophageal food boli can pass by themselves or with the assistance of medications, some require the use of endoscopy to push the obstructing food into the stomach, or remove it from the esophagus. The use of glucagon, while common, has not been found to be useful. Signs and symptoms Many foods can lodge themselves in the esophagus, but the most common are meats such as steak, poultry, or pork leading to the colourful description of the phenomenon as steakhouse syndrome. People with food bolus obstruction typically display acute dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), often to the point that they cannot even swallow their saliva, leading to drooling. They may also suffer from chest pain, neck pain, regurgitation of food, or painful swallowing (odynophagia). Patients with esophageal food boluses are also at risk of complications, such as perforation of the esophagus, and aspiration into the lungs. As a result, urgent treatment of patients with high-risk features, or a lengthy duration of symptoms, is recommended. Risk factors Endoscopic image of a Schatzki ring which is a common cause of esophageal food bolus obstruction Food bolus obstruction is most commonly caused by Schatzki rings, which are mucosal rings of unknown cause in the lower esophagus. Foodstuff jams into the esophagus due to the narrowing caused by the ring. An increasingly commonly recognized cause for esophageal food bolus obstruction is eosinophilic esophagitis, which is an inflammatory disorder of the mucosa of the esophagus, of unknown cause. Many alterations caused by eosinophilic esophagitis can predispose to food boluses; these include the presence of multiple rings and narrowing of the lumen. When considering esophageal dilation to treat a patient with food bolus obstruction, care must be made to look for features of eosinophilic esophagitis, as these patients are at a higher risk of dilation-associated complications. Other conditions that predispose to food bolus obstructions are esophageal webs, tracheoesophageal fistula/esophageal atresia (TOF/OA) and peptic strictures. Food boluses are common in the course of illness in patients with esophageal cancer but are more difficult to treat as endoscopy to push the bolus is less safe. Patients with esophageal self-expandable metallic stents may present with food boluses lodged within the stent lumen. Rarely disorders of movement of the esophagus, such as nutcracker esophagus, can predispose to food bolus obstruction. Treatment =Conservative= In an emergency room setting, someone with food bolus obstruction may be observed for a period to see if the food bolus passes spontaneously. This may be encouraged by giving carbonated drinks that release gas such as Coca-Cola, which may dislodge the food. While glucagon has been used in those with esophageal food bolus obstruction, evidence as of 2019 does not support its effectiveness, and its use may result in more side effects. Older reviews considered it an acceptable option as long it does not lead to delays in arranging other treatments. Other medications (hyoscine butylbromide, benzodiazepines and opioids) have been studied but the evidence is limited. Hyoscine butylbromide (also known as Buscopan) is used intravenously as a treatment in some cases, although there is a small risk of serious side effects in people who may have underlying cardiac issues such as high blood pressure, tachycardia, or heart disease. Historical treatment of food bolus obstruction included administration of proteolytic enzymes (such as meat tenderizers) with the purpose of degrading the meat that was blocked; however, it is possible that these methods may increase the risk of perforation of the esophagus. Other modalities rarely used now include removal of boluses using catheters, and the use of large-bore tubes inserted into the esophagus to forcefully lavage it. =Endoscopic= The Roth net can be inserted through the endoscope to remove pieces of the obstructed food. The standard treatment of food bolus obstruction is the use of endoscopy or fibre-optic cameras inserted by mouth into the esophagus. Endoscopes can be used to diagnose the cause of the food bolus obstruction, as well as to remove the obstruction. Traditional endoscopic techniques involved the use of an overtube, a plastic tube inserted into the esophagus prior to the removal of the food bolus, in order to reduce the risk of aspiration into the lungs at the time of endoscopy. However, the \\"push technique\\", which involves insufflating air into the esophagus, and gently pushing the bolus toward the stomach instead, has emerged as a common and safe way of removing the obstruction. Other tools may be used to remove food boluses. The Roth Net is a mesh net that can be inserted through the endoscope, and opened and closed from the outside; it can be used to retrieve pieces of obstructed food. Snares, which are normally used to remove polyps can be used to macerate the food causing the obstruction. Dormia baskets, which are metal baskets used to remove stones from the common bile duct in a procedure known as endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, can be opened and closed from the outside in a similar manner to macerate food and facilitate removal. Forceps used for biopsies can also be employed in a similar manner.

Plot summary The film story begins in the second half of 1984 - the final months of Konstantin Chernenko era - ending in the first part of 1991 - a few months before the anti-Gorbathev's GKChP coup d'√©tat attempt. A hero - Andrey Obnorsky (Nikita Zverev), a young student-orientalist from Leningrad - along the line of the Soviet Defense Ministry falls on his Arabic language practice into Marxist South Yemen. When he comes by Aeroflot Tu-154M plane in PDRY's capital Aden he feels shocked! He has to understand a local dialectal speech - but they learned only the language of the Quran! He has to survive in this Arabian heat - but they say Soviet predecessors - Englishmen - freed their servicemen, who served in Aden, from the penal responsibility for several years because of it. Above this, Obnorsky has had to be a translator and interpreter in a newly forming elite 7th Airborne brigade of the General Staff of the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen, to take part in the near- boundary clashes of southerners with the northerners (the way to the unification of Yemen was entirely complex) as well as between government forces and murtazaks, southern local armed opposition men, coming from abroad. Without his own will, Obnorskij occurs in the middle of a dangerous plot with the participation of the KGB, GRU men, and Palestinians, who had to receive a large party of weapons from the USSR, and the quarreling fractions in the ruling Yemeni Socialist Party authorities, President Ali Nasser Muhammad supporters and opposition, before and during bloody combat on the streets of Aden. Yet in the Happy Arabia the hero of film will meet his love, and then will find two most loyal friends. Another Arabic language student-interpreter Ilya Novoselov (Andrey Frolov), a cadet from the legendary Moscow VIIJa (the Military Institute - formerly the Military Institute of Foreign Languages of the Red Army), will introduce him into the vicious circle of military interpreters. The Palestinian instructor officer called Sindibad (Ramil Sabitov), the master of a hand-to-hand fighting, will teach him to fight. After being graduated from the Leningrad State University and urgent service of two years in one of the Soviet flying military schools - already as the interpreter/translator- officer - Obnorsky goes again to the Arab World, now to Libya. This mission from The Ten (the 10th Main Direction of the General Staff of the Ministry of Defence of the USSR) also will not be calm. There will be some Moscow's gilded youth in his, senior translator, subordination, who must be run and translate! There will some modern Soviet-made fighters disappear from the Benina Libyan airbase, and Obnorskij will be asked to clear up the situation for the Soviet competent bodies. Finally, his friend Ilya Novoselov commits suicide leaving a very strange letter, and Obnorsky begins his own dangerous investigation which leads him to his old enemy from Adeni times - his elder colleague and GRU man Kukarintsev (Pavel Novikov).  Historical accuracy  Despite of his own life experience as a military interpreter/translator with the Soviet military advisors in South Yemen and Libya the author of the novel, Andrey Konstantinov, stresses in the very beginning of his bestseller: any coincidences with real historical persons, places and events are sudden but all the differences from a real historical accuracy are \\"conforming to the laws of nature\\". It was really a big and hard task to camouflage a routine lowest ranking serviceman-interpreter every day work and life with a war and detective plot full of danger and adventure making a readable novel for a wide Russian public of the mid-nineties. To hyperbolise and puzzle true facts and change some geography and peoples' names and to generate new unknown \\"historical facts\\" to make a novel looking alive. However, despite the author's words he has told in his preface to the story, which were mentioned above, the young generation of Russian readers continue to read this novel. The book format helps a lot in this switching on every reader's individual fantasy. However the film or series format demanded a return to some kind of remaking of true historical realities and to restore some general distinctive features of that time local environmental and cultural, political, ideological, military, social, native, conversational and many other exotic details, which are easy to be remembered and recognised by those who took part in that or similar events. Music The music for the film was composed by Igor Kornelyuk. The song Pismo (The Letter) is the first rap experience of this known composer from Saint Petersburg. Words - Regina Lisits. Performance - Pavel Ostroumov and Nina Vedenina.

While the rule of legal professional privilege in Australia largely mirrors that of other Commonwealth jurisdictions, there are a number of notable qualifications and modifications to the privilege specific to Australia and its states, and contentious issues about the direction of the privilege. History Legal professional privilege emerged in the 16th century in England; it was originally a privilege held by a lawyer rather than the lawyer's client. Legal professional privilege in Australia developed from the English common law privilege. The rationale for legal professional privilege in an Australian context has been explained in the following ways:ALRC Discussion Paper 73, \\"Client Legal Privilege and Federal Investigatory Bodies\\", Chapter 2. * encouraging full disclosure of information by a client to a lawyer; * promoting compliance with the law by enabling lawyers to give full and considered advice on a client's legal obligations; * discouraging litigation and encouraging alternative dispute resolution; * protection of a client's privacy; * protecting access to justice. Michael Kirby has described legal professional privilege as an \\"important human right deserving of special protection for that reason\\"., per Kirby J at [85]‚Äì[86]. The Australian Law Reform Commission has adopted the terminology 'client legal privilege', as opposed to 'legal professional privilege', on the basis the privilege is held by the client not the lawyer.ALRC Discussion Paper 73, \\"Client Legal Privilege and Federal Investigatory Bodies\\", Chapter 1, pages 22‚Äì23. 'Client legal privilege' is the terminology used in Commonwealth and state evidence statutes. However, the common law privilege remains almost universally described by courts as 'legal professional privilege'. Source of rule Legal professional privilege in Australia is established by both the common law and various statutes. Both sources reflect the two limbs of legal professional privilege: advice privilege and litigation privilege. =Common law= Legal professional privilege has been described as an \\"important common law right\\" that is enforceable in equity. The Evidence Acts do not expressly alter the common law privilege. The common law maintains a distinction between two limbs of legal professional privilege. Advice privilege refers to the protection of communications between a client and a lawyer for the purposes of the lawyer providing legal advice to the client. Litigation privilege refers to the protection of communications between a client, lawyer (and any third party) for the dominant purpose of anticipated or existing legal proceedings. The prior test of 'sole purpose,' as per Grant v Downs,[1976] HCA 63. limited a lawyer's ability to claim privilege on items that were not for the exclusive purpose of the client's case. The current dominant purpose test, while more complex, significantly broadens the scope of legal professional privilege, as defined in Esso Australia Resources Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation.; see also, . There is, invariably, much overlap between the two limbs.ALRC Discussion Paper 73, \\"Client Legal Privilege and Federal Investigatory Bodies\\", Chapter 3, pages 65‚Äì66. =Statute= Sections 118 and 119 of the 'Evidence Act 1995' (Cth) provide that confidential communications created for the dominant purpose. of providing legal advice or litigation are protected from disclosure to federal courts. Similar or identical provisions have been adopted in New South Wales. and Tasmania.Evidence Act 2001 (Tas). Legal professional privilege in the context of court proceedings is governed by the common law in the remaining Australian states. Scope and content of the privilege =Two limbs= The privilege protects two kinds of confidential communications between a client and his or her lawyer. The first kind is where the communications are confidential and made for the purposes of seeking or being provided with legal advice. The second kind is where the communications are made for the purpose of existing or reasonably contemplated judicial or quasi- judicial proceedings. These two limbs of the privilege are called the advice privilege and the litigation privilege. Current issues in Australian law concerning legal professional privilege =Waiver of privilege= Legal professional privilege is not absolute and it does not attach to a communication indefinitely. The privilege may be waived by the client, but not by the lawyer. Accordingly, a client's intentional or inadvertent actions in relation to their use of legal advice may preclude the client from asserting the privilege in future. The High Court in Mann v Carnell. established a test of 'inconsistency' to determine whether a client has waived legal professional privilege over a communication. That is, a client will have waived privilege where their conduct has been inconsistent with the maintenance of that privilege. The most common circumstance in which a client will be found to have waived a privilege include disclosing the full advice, or the conclusions, gist or substance of the advice, to a third party or the public at large. This raises particular problems for public figures seeking to justify a particular course of action by relying on legal advice. However, privilege is not waived if a disclosure of a communication was made under a \\"compulsion of law\\".. An implied waiver of privilege can only occur when there is a voluntary disclosure of communication.. =Privilege and in-house lawyers= One of the most unsettled areas of privilege law in Australia is the extent to which advice provided by in-house counsel is protected. In Telstra Corporation Limited v Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts (No. 2),. Justice Graham of the Federal Court of Australia refused a claim for privilege over advice provided by in-house counsel of Telstra, holding 'an in-house lawyer will lack the requisite measure of independence if his or her advice is at risk of being compromised by virtue of the nature of his employment relationship with his employer'. This created concerns in the legal community as to the extent that in-house legal advice is protected from disclosure to a court.Allens Arthur Robinson Publication, In-house lawyers and claims for privilege, September 2007 Justice Graham did not set out any measures or criteria for determining when an in- house lawyer is sufficiently independent of his or her employer. In Vance v Air Marshall McCormack,. Justice Crispin of the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory held that privilege only attached to advice provided by lawyers who had a right to practice. This judgment has substantial ramifications for in-house counsel who are not admitted solicitors. Notwithstanding the above, there is no appellate authority on the extent to which legal professional privilege applies to advice provided by in-house counsel. =Privilege and quasi-judicial proceedings= There is conflicting authority on whether legal professional privilege applies to communications prepared for the purpose of non-judicial legal proceedings, such as in administrative tribunals or commissions of enquiry. These conflicts have generally not reached appellate level. In Ingot Capital Investments v Macquarie Equity Capital Markets,. Justice Bergin of the Supreme Court of New South Wales held that privilege did not apply to proceedings in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Justice Bergin's reasoning was that the AAT was not a court and stood outside the adversarial system of justice as an inquisitorial administrative body not bound by the rules of evidence. The AAT itself departed from and strongly criticised Ingot in a decision handed down by Justice Downes in his capacity as President of the AAT. In Farnaby and Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission,. Justice Downes held that the litigation limb of the privilege applied to AAT proceedings and took the step of directing all future claims for privilege in the AAT to be handled accordingly. The ALRC recommends extending legal professional privilege to non-judicial proceedings.ALRC Discussion Paper 73, \\"Client Legal Privilege and Federal Investigatory Bodies\\", Chapter 3, page 72. =ALRC inquiry= On 29 November 2006, Attorney-General Philip Ruddock asked the ALRC to inquire into legal professional privilege in the context of coercive information-gathering powers held by Commonwealth agencies. A Discussion Paper was released by the ALRC on 26 September 2007, noting the need for a clear and consistent approach to legal professional privilege in Australia and its states and territories. =Extension to tax advisers= In April 2011, Assistant Treasurer Bill Shorten announced a consultation on extending privilege to accountants providing tax advice, like their American counterparts. Other types of privileges  While the main perception of professional legal privilege is the client lawyer relationship some Australian States in particular NSW have extended this privilege to 'protected confidences' defined as \\"communication made by a person in confidence to another person .... in the course of a relationship in which the confidant was acting in a professional capacity\\".. The Division in the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) for 'Professional confidential relationship privilege' and how it is excluded or lost is at Division 1A .This is often interpreted as being between a health professional and their patient. It may however, extend to confidential advice from social workers, and accountants.. NSW has also added a 'Sexual assault communications privilege' at Division 1B. Therefore, when considering the access and adducing decisions for medical records that may also cover sexual assault records, the first consideration of course will be relevance, and then any NSW court or tribunal may exclude any evidence of either 'Professional confidential relationship privilege' or 'Sexual assault communications privilege' or both. These sections of the Act aimed to provide further restrictions and protections against oppressive discovery that can cause undue harm to a party in court and may dissuade them from seeking medical care or counselling or damage those relationships, see for example, R v A and B . for an appeal on an application in a case for access to discovery across 'Professional confidential relationship privilege' and 'Sexual assault communications privilege' and how the exclusions are decided. In some jurisdictions in Australia privilege may also extend to journalists,. (Shield laws), and priests. It may also be invoked in a Public interest,. or Matters of State. issue. Settlement Negotiations may also be privileged.. Spousal privilege is held to be non- existent in Australian Common Law.. Though it may exist in statute..

Typically one may be asked to enter the access token (e.g. 40 random characters) rather than the usual password (it therefore should be kept secret just like a password). Overview An access token is an object encapsulating the security identity of a process or thread. A token is used to make security decisions and to store tamper-proof information about some system entity. While a token is generally used to represent only security information, it is capable of holding additional free-form data that can be attached while the token is being created. Tokens can be duplicated without special privilege, for example to create a new token with lower levels of access rights to restrict the access of a launched application. An access token is used by Windows when a process or thread tries to interact with objects that have security descriptors (securable objects). In Windows, an access token is represented by the system object of type \`Token\`. An access token is generated by the logon service when a user logs on to the system and the credentials provided by the user are authenticated against the authentication database. The authentication database contains credential information required to construct the initial token for the logon session, including its user id, primary group id, all other groups it is part of, and other information. The token is attached to the initial process created in the user session and inherited by subsequent processes created by the initial process. Whenever such a process opens a handle to any resource which has access control enabled, Windows reconciles the data in the target object's security descriptor with the contents of the current effective access token. The result of this access check evaluation is an indication of whether any access is allowed and, if so, what operations (read, write/modify, etc.) the calling application is allowed to perform. Types of tokens There are two types of tokens available: ;Primary token: Primary tokens can only be associated to processes, and they represent a process's security subject. The creation of primary tokens and their association to processes are both privileged operations, requiring two different privileges in the name of privilege separation - the typical scenario sees the authentication service creating the token, and a logon service associating it to the user's operating system shell. Processes initially inherit a copy of the parent process's primary token. ;Impersonation token: Impersonation is a security concept implemented in Windows NT that allows a server application to temporarily \\"be\\" the client in terms of access to secure objects. Impersonation has four possible levels: anonymous, giving the server the access of an anonymous/unidentified user, identification, letting the server inspect the client's identity but not use that identity to access objects, impersonation, letting the server act on behalf of the client, and delegation, same as impersonation but extended to remote systems to which the server connects (through the preservation of credentials). The client can choose the maximum impersonation level (if any) available to the server as a connection parameter. Delegation and impersonation are privileged operations (impersonation initially was not, but historical carelessness in the implementation of client APIs failing to restrict the default level to \\"identification\\", letting an unprivileged server impersonate an unwilling privileged client, called for it). Impersonation tokens can only be associated to threads, and they represent a client process's security subject. Impersonation tokens are usually created and associated to the current thread implicitly, by IPC mechanisms such as DCE RPC, DDE and named pipes. Contents of a token A token is composed of various fields, including: * an identifier. * the identifier of the associated logon session. The session is maintained by the authentication service, and is populated by the authentication packages with a collection of all the information (credentials) the user provided when logging in. Credentials are used to access remote systems without the need for the user to re-authenticate (single sign-on), provided that all the systems involved share an authentication authority (e.g. a Kerberos ticket server) * the user identifier. This field is the most important and it's strictly read-only. * the identifiers of groups the user (or, more precisely, the subject) is part of. Group identifiers cannot be deleted, but they can be disabled or made \\"deny-only\\". At most one of the groups is designated as the session id, a volatile group representing the logon session, allowing access to volatile objects associated to the session, such as the display. * the restricting group identifiers (optional). This additional set of groups doesn't grant additional access, but further restricts it: access to an object is only allowed if it's allowed also to one of these groups. Restricting groups cannot be deleted nor disabled. Restricting groups are a recent addition, and they are used in the implementation of sandboxes. * the privileges, i.e. special capabilities the user has. Most privileges are disabled by default, to prevent damage from non- security-conscious programs. Starting in Windows XP Service Pack 2 and Windows Server 2003 privileges can be permanently removed from a token by a call to \`AdjustTokenPrivileges()\` with the \`SE_PRIVILEGE_REMOVED\` attribute. * the default owner, primary group and ACL for objects created by the subject associated to the token.

She was the fourth French ship named in honour of Robert Surcouf. Design and construction Laid down in February 1951 at Lorient and launched in October 1953, Surcouf was commissioned into the French Navy in 1955. She was the first of twelve T 47-class destroyers. With a standard displacement of 2,750 tons and a length of , the ship had a beam of and a draught of . Her armament consisted of six guns which were mounted in three twin turrets, six guns in twin mounts and four single-mounted guns. There were four banks of three torpedo tubes, capable of launching both anti-submarine homing and anti-ship torpedoes. Surcouf had two shafts, geared turbines, and four boilers, which were capable of producing and a top speed of ( and during trials). At , Surcouf had a range of . The ship had a complement of 347 personnel.Gardiner and Chumbley 1995. p. 110. =Major modification= In the early 1960s, Surcouf was converted to a command ship to become a flotilla leader. In order to install an operations centre and housings for an admiral and his staff, the forward 57 mm mount was removed (extending forward the bridge) and the two aft torpedo platforms were removed so that housing quarters could be constructed. The overhaul was conducted the arsenal of Brest between 11 June 1960 (commencement of work) and 4 October 1961 (end of the tests). Operational service Following her commissioning in November 1955, Surcouf homeport was Toulon, being assigned to the First Destroyers Flotilla (1st FEE), at the head of the Fourth Destroyer Division (DEE4). In 1956 she alternated between naval exercises (including NATO's) and Algerian coastal surveillance. From October to December Surcouf took part in Operation Musketeer during the Suez Crisis. On 10 April 1959 her assignment and homeport were changed. Surcouf was attached to the Tenth Destroyer Division (DEE10) of the Light Fleet (the Escadre l√©g√®re) based at Brest. On 26 March 1960, Surcouf was involved in a collision with the cargo ship L√©ognan off Groix, suffering significant damage but no loss of life. After her conversion into a flotilla leader (June 1960 ‚Äì October 1961) Surcouf was assigned to the main fleet (the Escadre), based at Toulon, where she was the flagship of the admiral commanding the 1st FEE (ALFEE). In March 1962, during the Battle of Bab El Oued, Surcouf was sent to shell the OAS-held Bab el-Oued quarter of Algiers along with her sister ship . After suggestions from the naval command, the bombardment was called off as impractical. The destroyers kept their station close to the shore as a deterrent. Along with three other destroyers, both vessels ferried troops to Algiers on 2 March to counter the OAS rebellion.Labour research, Volumen 51, p. 112. Labour Research Department, 1962 =Final fate= On 6 June 1971, before sunrise, in the Mediterranean Sea southeast of Cartagena, Spain, as she sailed with the tactical group of the aircraft carrier , Surcouf was again in a collision when she cut across the bow of the Soviet tanker General Busharov. The tanker, six times heavier than the destroyer, could not avoid the collision and rammed Surcouf at . Nine men from Surcouf were lost at sea and one was severely burned (he later died of his wounds). When the French destroyer (which belonged to the same tactical group) attempted to tow the badly damaged ship, Surcouf snapped in two, the bow sinking quickly. The aft part was taken in tow to Toulon via Cartagena. Surcouf was eventually sunk as a target by an Exocet anti-ship missile after being decommissioned on 5 May 1972.

Photographs during the 1920s. His photograph of the execution of Ruth Snyder in the electric chair at Sing Sing Prison, on January 12, 1928 has been called \\"the most famous tabloid photo of the decade\\". The execution photo Photographers are not permitted into executions in the United States, so the New York Daily News, determined to secure a photograph, resorted to subterfuge. They brought in Howard, who was not known to the prison warders or journalists in the New York area. He arrived early and, passing himself in by posing as a writer, he took up a vantage position so as to be able to take pictures with the help of a miniature camera that he had strapped to his right ankle. The camera had a single photographic plate that was linked by cable to the shutter release concealed within his jacket. When Snyder's body shook from the jolt, Howard pressed the shutter release, exposing the plate. The image appeared to have caught the subject in motion from the execution, which added to the already dramatic scene. Ruth Snyder's execution, on January 12, 1928, was published the following day on the front page of the New York Daily News. The photograph was published the next day on the front page of the paper under the banner headline \\"DEAD!\\"; Howard gained overnight popularity, and was paid very well for the image. Thereafter he worked in newspaper photography in Washington and Chicago, retiring as chief photographer for the Chicago Sun- Times in 1961, the year of his death. He had been in semi-retirement since 1951 following a heart attack. The camera Howard used to snap the shot is part of the collection of the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History. The state attempted to prosecute Howard and the newspaper, but nothing ever came of it. For many years afterwards witnesses to executions were searched and asked to hold up their hands so they could not operate hidden cameras. Personal life Howard's grandson is actor George Wendt, and his great- grandson is actor and comedian Jason Sudeikis. His wife, Helen, died in 1958.

History Voters approved the creation of Pinellas County Sheriff's Department in 1912. The early Pinellas County Sheriff's Office reflected the rough and rural nature of the peninsula at that time. Bootlegging, moon shining, and gambling were daily occurrences and the Sheriff's Office was kept busy running after a host of colorful criminals. Jail escapes were common. Newspapers reported how inmates sawed their way through the iron bars with tools smuggled in from the outside. From the early days until the late 1950s, deputy sheriffs drove their own cars, wore plain clothes and carried their own weapons. The county was divided into several districts, each of which had a Justice of the Peace, to supervise legal matters. There was no centralized jail system. The Sheriff's Office enforced the laws alongside the County Patrol and various municipal police departments. When judges ran short of citizens in a jury pool, deputy sheriffs were sent out to round up citizens to serve. It wasn't until 1959, during the tenure of Sheriff Don Genung, that the sheriff's office took on a modern identity. =Police patrol absorbed= The Sheriff's Office absorbed the County Patrol in 1960. A year later, the Sheriff's Office bought a fleet of 1961 Plymouth Fury automobiles to serve as patrol cars. Sheriff's deputies were issued standardized uniforms. In fact, the shoulder patch worn by deputies now remains unchanged from that time. A standardized training program was developed and Sheriff's Office personnel were given the benefits of civil service, as well as health and retirement plans. Today Improvements in technology and law enforcement strategy continued to evolve during the following decades. Presently, the Pinellas County Sheriff's Office consists of over 3,000 Members of Service in five major service categories: *Patrol Operations ‚Äî Uniform Patrol ‚Äî Community Policing ‚Äî K-9 Unit ‚Äî Flight Unit ‚Äî Marine & Environmental Lands Units ‚Äî SWAT ‚Äî DUI Unit ‚Äî School Resource Officer Unit *Investigative Operations ‚Äî Property Crimes Division ‚Äî Crimes Against Persons Division ‚Äî Narcotics Division *Judicial Operations ‚Äî Court Security Division ‚Äî Court Processing Division ‚Äî Violent Offenders Warrant Unit ‚Äî Misdemeanor Probation Division *Detention and Corrections ‚Äî See 'County Jail' section below. *Support Services ‚Äî Communications Division ‚Äî Forensics Science Division ‚Äî Property/Evidence Section ‚Äî Child Protection Investigations Division *Inspections ‚Äî Administrative Investigations Division ‚Äî Policy & Accreditation Sheriff's deputies have countywide jurisdiction, but patrol the unincorporated areas and the cities under contract with the Sheriff's Office for primary law enforcement services. Contract Cities { valign=top *Belleair Beach *Belleair Bluffs *Dunedin *Indian Rocks Beach *Madeira Beach *North Redington Beach valign=top *Oldsmar *Redington Beach *Safety Harbor *Seminole *South Pasadena *St. Pete Beach } Law enforcement services such as the K-9 Unit, Flight Section, and Marine Unit are available countywide. The Sheriff's Child Protection Investigation Division (CPID), another countywide program, meets the needs of abused and neglected children. The Sheriff's Office also took the lead in tracking sexual predators and offenders by dedicating a team of deputies to monitor the registration and activities of these individuals countywide. The Youth Services Section has grown to include School Resource Officers in middle schools and high schools, and programs dealing with youthful offenders. The Sheriff's Office has forged strong community partnerships by offering citizens numerous opportunities to learn more about law enforcement and personal safety. Citizens from around the county can participate in the Sheriff's Citizens Academy, the Sheriff's Advisory Board, Neighborhood Watch, and Volunteers In Partnership (VIPs). The Pinellas County Sheriff's Office is one of the few law enforcement agencies in the nation to achieve the highest marks in three areas of professional accreditation: law enforcement, corrections and inmate health care. The agency has pioneered the use of facial recognition technology in law enforcement and corrections and continues to be innovative in the automation of records, forensics science, and the security of property and evidence. County Jail Pinellas County Jail (hereinafter PCJ) has a capacity of 4,339 beds. The average daily population is a little over 3,000 people that are either pre- trial or inmates sentenced to a year or less. Inmates sentenced to state prison are picked up by the DOC usually between 1 and 2 weeks after sentencing. Over 500 inmates are sentenced to imprisonment with hard labor to the community and while on the jail compound. PCJ houses inmates based on factors such as crimes, record, behavior and security. The jail has four facilities: The North, South, Health and Central divisions. The south division is the maximum security unit. It comprises seven pods: Alpha, Delta, Bravo, Echo, Charlie, F-wing, and G-wing. The health division is usually for injured and sick inmates. The central division is a minimum security unit that uses a number system of the floor number plus a pod number. North division holds various types of inmates. C-barracks holds non-sentenced and sentenced men. Visitation is done via a phone and TV monitor. Conjugal visits are not allowed. Visitation must be scheduled based on the inmate's assigned visitation day.

The 18th tropical cyclone, the 15th named storm, and the 11th typhoon of the 2007 Pacific typhoon season, Krosa formed from a tropical system east of the Philippines in late September. The system became a depression on October 1, and on the following day, the depression quickly developed into a severe tropical storm. In the following days, Krosa rapidly intensified into a Category 4 super typhoon and reached peak intensity of (in 10-minute winds). Krosa would slowly weaken before making landfall on Taiwan. After making landfall on Taiwan, Krosa quickly weakened into a minimal typhoon, and rapidly weakened into a tropical depression between Zhejiang and Fujian provinces. Krosa transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on October 8. Extratropical remnants of Krosa dissipated on October 12. In China, Krosa caused large-scale evacuations, but the final impact was minimal. In Taiwan however, Krosa caused 5 deaths.  Meteorological history  In late September, a new system formed east of the Philippines, leading to a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert by JTWC. PAGASA declared it a tropical depression and assigned a local name Ineng early on October 1, and the JMA and JTWC soon followed. It was upgraded to a tropical storm early on October 2 by JMA, receiving the international name Krosa. Rapid intensification took place on October 2 and it was upgraded to a typhoon by the JTWC by midday. As it intensified, it gained a wide, ragged eye and began to track to the west, becoming a typhoon by the JMA early on October 3. It continued to rapidly intensify that day before leveling off as a Category 4-equivalent typhoon on October 4. Fluctuations in intensity soon followed as Krosa approached Taiwan, as the JMA upgraded it to and the JTWC into a super typhoon early on October 5. It slowly weakened afterward before making landfall in northeastern Taiwan on October 6. After landfall in Taiwan, Krosa quickly weakened into Category 1 typhoon as it approached China. Krosa would make landfall shortly afterwards between Zhejiang and Fujian around that intensity. JMA downgraded Krosa into a severe tropical storm. Early on October 7, JMA would further downgrade Krosa into a tropical storm, and JTWC followed suit, as Krosa weakened rapidly. Krosa would parallel the coast of China as it turned east-northeast, and emerged in the sea soon after. As sea surface temperatures were cold and could not sustain a tropical cyclone, Krosa began transitioning into a extratropical cyclone. Around noon October 8, JMA published the last tropical cyclone warning on Krosa as it weakened into a tropical depression, and JTWC followed suit six hours later. The extratropical remnants of Krosa crossed the International Dateline on October 12. Preparations =Taiwan= Hundreds of thousands of people had to evacuate from the oncoming typhoon. Several flights and transport services were cancelled due to the disruption of the typhoon. =China= An evacuation of 730,000 people from China's Zhejiang and Fujian provinces was ordered on the evening of October 6. More than 600,000 people evacuated after landfall in China, bringing the total evacuees into 1.4 million people. In Shanghai, 8,800 workers had to stay out of the coasts despite Krosa passing well south of the city, and more than 40 flights to Shanghai were cancelled. Impact Destroyed sports gym in Taiwan =Taiwan= Rains from Krosa caused flooding which led to blocked roads along with downed trees. These blocked roads caused the death of a newborn who needed medical attention. Another death was directly caused by landfall,, while isolated incidents caused by high winds from the typhoon caused deaths of another two people. Taiwan‚Äôs National Fire Agency reported that a traffic incident caused another death, bringing the death toll to five people. Additionally, Krosa injured 67 people and knocked out power to another 2 million people when it made landfall as a Category 4 typhoon. =China= In China, severe structural damage and power outages were reported in the port city of Wenzhou, and 17 people were reported injured. No fatalities were reported. According to Government of China, more than 7.4 million people were affected by the typhoon. Rains and winds from Krosa caused the destruction of 3,500 homes.

Design of the Jar The Manunggul Jar shows that the Filipinos' maritime culture is paramount that it reflected its ancestors' religious beliefs. Many epics around the Philippines would tell how souls go to the next life, aboard boats, pass through the rivers and seas. This belief is connected with the Austronesian belief of the anito. The fine lines and intricate designs of the Manunggul Jar reflect the artistry of early Filipinos. These designs are proof of the Filipinos' common heritage from the Austronesian-speaking ancestors despite the diversity of the cultures of the Filipinos.Wilhelm G.

This explains why the design of the cover of the Manunggul Jar features three faces - the soul, the boatman, and the boat itself. On the faces of the figures and on the prow of the boat are eyes and mouth rendered in the same style as other artifacts of Southeast Asia of that period. The two human figures in a boat represent a voyage to the afterlife. The boatman is holding a steering paddle while the one on his front shows hands crossed on his chest. The steersman's oar is missing its paddle, as is the mast in the center of the boat, against which the steersman would have braced his feet. The manner in which the hands of the front figure are folded across the chest is a widespread practice in the Philippines when arranging the corpse.Manunggul Jar And The Early Practice Of Burial In The Philippines.

The Court Funds Office is also responsible for money held on behalf of clients who are deemed mentally incapacitated. Under the Mental Capacity Act 2005, a Deputy (usually a relative) is appointed to look after their financial affairs and draw money from the CFO as and when necessary to ensure the continued care of the Protected Party. Children who have been involved in an accident or obtained an award through civil litigation also have money held by the CFO. The money is invested in either a high paying interest account or part is invested on an interest account and part into the Equity Index Tracker fund (on the stock market). The CFO hold on to the funds until the child reaches 18 years of age, when they can apply to have the money and investments paid to them. The Court Funds Office also deals with a large unclaimed balance fund (¬£35m). This is where money has been paid into a CFO account and lain dormant for a period of 10 years. Money can be left through a case collapsing, companies going into liquidation during trial; the result of house repossessions (the bank makes more than the debt from the sale but can't trace the original owner) and by the parties failing to progress or complete the action.

There were also over thirty presenters at the Spring Fashion Week in March 2013. In 2010, fire permits were not secured in time for the first day events which caused an extra day to be added to accommodate the presentations that had been cancelled on the first day. The WIFW autumn-winter 2014 started on 26 March 2014 with actress Shilpa Shetty walking the ramp wearing the collections of designer Tarun Tahiliani. The WIFW spring-summer 2015 event started on 8 October 2014 at New Delhi. The Indian fashion industry has become a growing industry with international events such as the India Fashion Week and annual shows by fashion designers being held across major cities of the country. In 2016‚Äì2017 the event was sponsored by Amazon Fashion India and thus the name was updated to Amazon Fashion week. Most recently, Lotus Make-Up India has partnered with FDCI to be part of the event. It is now referred to as Lotus Make-Up India Fashion week. In all its years it has maintained its space on the top for big Delhi designers to showcase their collections every season. It has through the years worked on different formats, i.e: most recently it shared its space with Lovely Professional University, where they opened their door to students to showcase their talent.

Established in 1877 by Emma Bartlet Cook, Tintern has a non- selective enrolment policy and currently caters for over 890 students, from ELC through to Year 12, including international students. Located on one site in Ringwood East, the Early Learning Centre is co-educational, while girls and boys are educated in single-sex environments from Prep - Year 9. In Years 10 - 12 boys and girls learn together in a co-educational classes. The school is a member of the Eastern Independent Schools of Melbourne (EISM), the Junior School Heads Association of Australia (JSHAA), the Association of Heads of Independent Schools of Australia (AHISA), and the Alliance of Girls' Schools Australasia (AGSA). History Tintern was founded in 1877 by Emma Cook. Not satisfied with any of the established schools in Hawthorn, Cook felt she needed to start \\"an excellent school\\" for her four youngest daughters and the youngest of her five sons. It was not long before neighbours asked Cook to allow their children to enrol, and as word spread about the achievements of the school, many country families also sent their children to attend. The Church of England Trust purchased the school in 1918, and what was initially a co-educational school, became a school for girls known as Tintern Church of England Girls‚Äô Grammar School. Continued growth led to the need for larger and more modern facilities, and subsequently the school moved to its current campus of just over , at Ringwood East in 1953. The site had been purchased in June 1946 for ¬£3,113. In 1999, under the principalship of Sylvia Walton (1982-2005), the school returned to Cook's founding wish of educating the whole family, with the establishment of Tintern's brother school, Southwood, located at Ringwood. Campus Tintern Grammar is set on a campus in a semi- rural setting, featuring bushland and landscaped gardens. The schools facilities include a multi-function assembly and performance space, ELC, senior and junior libraries and information centres, science and technology laboratories, computer laboratories, established areas for visual and performing arts, a swimming pool and gymnasium complex and other sporting facilities.Tintern Schools Campus Facilities (accessed:14-08-2007) The school also features a farm, where students are encouraged to take part in a Young Farmers program, in which they enter in agricultural competitions. The farm has been operational since the opening of the Ringwood campus of the school, and has since been very successful in local sheep competitions. Curriculum Tintern Grammar offers the International Baccalaureate (IB), the Victorian Certificate of Education (VCE) and Vocational Education Training (VET).https://www.tintern.vic.edu.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SC-Course- guide-2020.pdf  House system  Tintern has a house system adopted in 1924 and modelled on great English Public Schools.

He saved the Spanish Ibex from extinction and helped in the establishment of South Africa's first game reserve. Early life Abel Chapman was born at 212 High Street, Bishopwearmouth, on 4 October 1851. He was the eldest child of Edward and Jane Chapman and came from a long line of sportsmen who were both accomplished hunters and acclaimed naturalists. His grandfather, Joseph Crawhall, was an accurate grouse shot in Hexhamshire, as well as being a founder member of the National History Society of Northumbria. His uncle, George Crawhall, was described by Chapman as \\"a typical sportsman of the old school ‚Äì the mentor to whom I owe the best grounding in field-craft.\\" Chapman's first experiences of hunting were in Northumberland, where he fell in love with nature at the same time as shooting. He often made drawings of the birds he saw and shot there. But it was a friend he made at Rugby School, F C Selous, who inspired his lifelong love of travel and adventure ‚Äì a world away from the moors of Northumberland. Years later, he co-authored a hunting book with Selous, called The Big Game of Africa and Europe. Adventures and expeditions Abel Chapman with a spotted hyena at the Lukenia Heights, 23 January 1906 Chapman joined his father's firm, the Sunderland-based Lambton Brewery, after leaving Rugby, travelling to Portugal, Spain and Morocco as part of his work in the wine trade. The visits were not confined just to work, however, as they allowed him to broaden his knowledge of wildlife by fishing and shooting. He also travelled the world as a young man, shooting big game and wild birds for pleasure. Trophies from his hunting trips adorned the walls of his home at Silksworth Hall in the late 19th century. Today his stuffed animals can be seen on display at Sunderland Museum, the National History Museum in London and the Great North Museum in Newcastle.Outline of the Collections at the Hancock Museum A trip to Scandinavia in August 1881 proved of particular fascination to him. Indeed, he made a further 23 expeditions to Norway, Sweden and Denmark over the next 17 years. His brother, Alfred Chapman, often accompanied him, and detailed accounts of their adventures were compiled in a book, Wild Norway, in 1897. Chapman was also fascinated by the wildlife of Spain, striking up a friendship with fellow wildlife enthusiast Walter J Buck. The pair became joint managers of a stretch of coast at Coto Donana, near the river Guadalquivir, in 1882, which they ran as a nature reserve. It was here Chapman discovered Europe's major breeding ground for flamingos, and helped save the Spanish Ibex ‚Äì a wild goat ‚Äì from extinction. There are now 35,000 Ibex, thanks to hunting restrictions initiated by Chapman. He also co-authored two books with Buck about hunting and fishing at the site, Wild Spain in 1893 and Unexplored Spain in 1910. The land was later acquired by the Spanish and 65 square kilometres are still managed as a nature reserve. Retirement Chapman retired from the family firm in 1897, following its takeover by J W Cameron, and moved to Houxty in Northumberland, where he created his own little nature reserve. His smart country home was surrounded by small plantations, moorland and gardens, all designed to attract birds, animals and other naturalists in profusion. Campers at the first Baden- Powell holiday camp in 1908 visited Houxty while staying six miles away in Humshaugh. Chapman and Buck visited South Africa for the first time in 1899, to take part in big-game hunting. The trip, cut short by the Boer War, proved disappointing, as the Kruger area was over-hunted. After returning to Britain, Chapman drew up plans to protect the Kruger site from further harm by creating a nature reserve. His proposals were sent to the International Convention for the Preservation of Wild Animals in London in 1900 and, shortly after, the Sabi Game Reserve was established. Over 2,500 square kilometres of land were set aside for the project, and former intelligence officer James Stevenson- Hamilton was appointed as the first warden. By 1903 the park was such a success that it was extended, and a second reserve ‚Äì the Shingwedzi ‚Äì was opened nearby later that year. Today, the Sabi Reserve, a core part of the Kruger National Park, is a tourist hot spot. Chapman was a member of the Society for the Preservation of the Wild Fauna of the Empire. Chapman died at Houxty in January 1929. Bibliography * Wild Spain. Abel Chapman and Walter J. Buck. London, Gurney and Jackson, 1893. * Unexplored Spain. Abel Chapman and Walter J. Buck.

Transcription termination of RNA polymerase II transcripts is proposed to occur by a two-stage process. The first stage involves pre-termination cleavage (PTC) of the nascent transcript downstream of the poly(A) site. This process is also referred to as co- transcriptional cleavage (CoTC). The CoTC process in the human beta-globin gene was proposed to involve an RNA self-cleaving activity located in the 3' flanking region of the beta-globin gene. The CoTC core is highly conserved in the 3' UTR of other primate beta-globin genes. However, there has been no independent confirmation of these findings, and a subsequent analysis by a team including members of the original report failed to demonstrate ribozyme activity.

It lies on the River Avon between the larger villages of Enford and Netheravon, with nearly half of its houses on the road connecting the two and the remainder in Coombe Lane. History The history of Coombe is poorly documented, but an early reference to it dates back to the year 934, when Coombe, along with the manors of Enford, Fifield, Littlecott and Longstreet was granted by Athelstan to Winchester Cathedral as a single estate of thirty hides. Coombe was part of the Bishop of Winchester's hundred of 'Elstub', together with the larger settlements of Enford, Netheravon and Fittleton. It is thought that since the name of the neighbouring hamlet of 'Fifield' translates as 'five hides', Coombe, of similar size, may also have been valued at five hides at the time of the Domesday Book. Since its foundation, Coombe has probably never grown much beyond the small hamlet that it is today, although no buildings survive from the earliest times. The foundations of a small chapel-of-ease dating from the Middle Ages are still said to be visible, although the chapel is thought to have fallen out of use in the 15th century. Amenities The parish church and the nearest pub, The Swan, are at Enford. Economy Since the only working farm was razed to make way for a small housing development in the late 1990s, Coombe has no industries and has become a commuter village, although the proliferation of the internet has allowed some people to work from home. A significant proportion of the population are, or have been, employed by the Ministry of Defence, due to Coombe's situation in the Salisbury Plain Training Area (SPTA) and near to several British Army camps and headquarters. Tourism Situated between Stonehenge and Avebury, Coombe has several tourist attractions. The east end of Coombe Lane is the site of two tumuli, which could be up to 5,000 years old. Nearby fields have been the site of a number of archeological digs, including one by the television programme Time Team around three miles to the east. The River Avon bridge crossing is a popular site for families on hot summer days due to its easy bathing access. Media Local events, village politics and sports are covered by the Enford Newsletter, based in Coombe Lane.

The IL represents the level of trustworthiness of an object. This mechanism's goal is to restrict the access permissions for potentially less trustworthy contexts (processes, files, and other securable objects), compared with other contexts running under the same user account that are more trusted. Implementation Mandatory Integrity Control is defined using a new access control entry (ACE) type to represent the object's IL in its security descriptor. In Windows, Access Control Lists (ACLs) are used to grant access rights (read, write, and execute permissions) and privileges to users or groups. An IL is assigned to a subject's access token when initialized. When the subject tries to access an object (for example, a file), the Security Reference Monitor compares the integrity level in the subject's access token against the integrity level in the object's security descriptor. Windows restricts the allowed access rights depending on whether the subject's IL is higher or lower than the object, and depending on the integrity policy flags in the new access control entry (ACE). The security subsystem implements the integrity level as a mandatory label to distinguish it from the discretionary access under user control that ACLs provide. Windows Vista defines four integrity levels: Low (SID: S-1-16-4096), Medium (SID: S-1-16-8192), High (SID: S-1-16-12288), and System (SID: S-1-16-16384). By default, processes started by a regular user gain a Medium IL and elevated processes have High IL. By introducing integrity levels, MIC allows classes of applications to be isolated, enabling scenarios like sandboxing potentially- vulnerable applications (such as Internet-facing applications). Processes with Low IL are called low-integrity processes, which have less access than processes with higher ILs where the Access control enforcement is in Windows. Objects with Access control lists, such as Named objects, including files, registry keys or even other processes and threads, have an entry in the System Access Control List governing access to them, that defines the minimum integrity level of the process that can use the object. Windows makes sure that a process can write to or delete an object only when its integrity level is equal to or higher than the requested integrity level specified by the object. Additionally, for privacy reasons process objects with higher IL are out-of-bounds for even read access from processes with lower IL. Consequently, a process cannot interact with another process that has a higher IL. So a process cannot perform functions such as inject a DLL into a higher IL process by using the \`CreateRemoteThread()\` function of the Windows API or send data to a different process by using the \`WriteProcessMemory()\` function. Application While processes inherit the integrity level of the process that spawned it, the integrity level can be customized at the time of process creation. As well as for defining the boundary for window messages in the User Interface Privilege Isolation (UIPI) technology, Mandatory Integrity Control is used by applications like Adobe Reader, Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, and Windows Explorer to isolate documents from vulnerable objects in the system. Internet Explorer 7 introduces a MIC-based \\"Protected Mode\\" setting to control whether a web page is opened as a low-integrity process or not (provided the operating system supports MIC), based on security zone settings, thereby preventing some classes of security vulnerabilities. Since Internet Explorer in this case runs as a Low IL process, it cannot modify system level objects‚Äîfile and registry operations are instead virtualized. Adobe Reader 10 and Google Chrome are two other notable applications that are introducing the technology in order to reduce their vulnerability to malware. Microsoft Office 2010 introduced the \\"Protected View\\" isolated sandbox environment for Excel, PowerPoint, and Word that prohibits potentially unsafe documents from modifying components, files, and other resources on a system. Protected View operates as a low-integrity process and, in Windows Vista and later versions of Windows, uses MIC and UIPI to further restrict the sandbox. However, in some cases a higher IL process do need to execute certain functions against the lower IL process, or a lower IL process need to access resources that only a higher IL process can access (for example, when viewing a webpage in protected mode, save a file downloaded from the internet to a folder specified by the user). High IL and Low IL processes can still communicate with each other by using files, Named pipes, LPC or other shared objects. The shared object must have an integrity level as low as the Low IL process and should be shared by both the Low IL and High IL processes. Since MIC does not prevent a Low IL process from sharing objects with a higher IL process, it can trigger flaws in the higher IL process and have it work on behalf of the low IL process, thereby causing a Squatting attack. Shatter attacks, however, can be prevented by using User Interface Privilege Isolation which takes advantage of MIC.

HYLAS, which is an acronym for Highly Adaptable Satellite, is a communications satellite and was launched by the European Ariane 5 launch vehicle from the Guyana Space Centre at Kourou in French Guiana.The Hindu - November 27, 2010 -ISRO's communication satellite HYLAS launched successfully It is located at the orbital location of 33.5 degrees west and will provide new and innovative services including High Definition Television (HDTV) and interactive satellite delivered broadband services. The satellite will help address the issue of poor broadband coverage in many parts of Europe which have less developed ground infrastructure. Construction HYLAS was constructed by EADS Astrium for the UK telecommunications company Avanti Communications Plc. Development of the satellite was supported by a ¬£23m investment from the British National Space Centre (BNSC). BNSC case study on Avanti and the HYLAS satellite Launch Avanti purchased for HYLAS a launch to geostationary transfer orbit (GTO) on a Falcon 9 launch vehicle. The purchase, in September 2007, made Avanti the first customer to purchase a commercial geostationary launch from SpaceX. In July 2009 Arianespace announced that HYLAS would instead be launched in 2010, \\"using an Ariane 5 or Soyuz launcher\\" from Arianespace. Avanti had previously criticized Arianespace as being overly expensive, but a move to Arianespace was motivated by prospective customers' concerns about launch risks associated with Falcon 9. Also, additional financial assets became available, including 10.7 million pounds from British contributions ESA's Artes telecommunications development program. HYLAS successfully launched at 18:41 GMT on the 26 November 2010 by Ariane 5. Mission HYLAS is based on the Indian Space Research Organisation's I-2K small satellite platform under a cooperative arrangement between EADS Astrium and ISRO/Antrix. SatNews Daily report on HYLAS The HYLAS payload carries two Ku band transponders, intended mainly for HDTV, and six Ka band transponders feeding up to eight Spotbeams, allowing the provision of between 150,000 and 300,000 simultaneous broadband Internet connections.

It consists of a residence (the head) and a kitchen (the neck) placed in line in front of a big shed (the body). A striking fact is that the residence was never built in the centre front of the shed ‚Äì this has to do with the origin of this type of farmhouse from a smaller type of farmhouse that has now disappeared. This original Old Frisian longhouse consisted of a residence with a cattle shed immediately behind it. The harvest was stacked in the attic or in open barns which were logically located near the livestock shed. Due to the development of better harvesting materials at the beginning of the 16th century there was a need for more storage space for the harvest. This was solved by building a bigger shed behind the 'head and neck' of the original farmhouse. These farmhouses can be found in Friesland, Groningen and (in the northern part of) North Holland. Although sometimes considered as typically Frisian, the origin of this kind of farmhouse is found in the Het Bildt county where for the first time intensive agriculture flourished; the Bildt was especially suitable for harvesting large areas of land. Because harvest quantities became larger, the inhabitants, who were mostly of South Holland origin, were some of the first who needed more storage and ordinary open barns gradually developed into large, enclosed sheds. Although there is a distinct difference between the typical Frisian farmhouses in northern provinces and the Bildts farmhouses, only the Bildts farmhouses have the feature whereby the sheds are placed at right-angles to the residential part of the house. These days both types can be found in the Bildt.

Currency Press, Sydney) The Golden Age is a 1985 play written by Australian writer and playwright Louis Nowra.Currency Press - The Golden Age It is based on the story that Nowra heard from an academic about \\"a strange group of people in the wilds of South-West Tasmania just before World War II\\".From the preface to The Golden Age Plot summary Francis Morris, a young, enthusiastic engineer from Melbourne, and his wealthy friend Peter, a geologist from Hobart, depart on an endeavor of exploring the wilds of Tasmania. After becoming lost in the wilderness, they stumble upon a group of people who have been living in isolation since the mid-19th century. Because of this social seclusion the tribe has developed its own unique language and culture constructed upon the social conventions of Regency England. Upon returning to Hobart, the pair informs Peter's father Dr William Archer of the group, and he arranges for their integration back into civilization. The group does not integrate into society well in relation to their mental and physical incapacitates. They are seen as \\"an endorsement of Nazi beliefs\\" and, as a result, the tribe is imprisoned in an asylum. In the meantime, with the advent of World War II, Peter and Francis are sent to Europe to fight. In the years that follow, one by one each member of the group dies, with the exception of Betsheb, leaving her suffering \\"profound depressions\\" and in an unfit condition to be released, so for another year she remains at New Norfolk Asylum, during which time she is given shock treatment. Francis is eventually sent back to Australia. Having been disillusioned and traumatized by the events of the war, as well as resentful of the Australian attitude towards our history and mistakes, Francis elects to live with Betsheb once more in the wilderness, taking her back home. Themes The play addresses many themes and ideas. The lost tribe has been seen as an allegory for the Tasmanian Aborigines, and indeed all Aborigines and first-nation people. The play also addresses the basis, and the flaws, of the Australian culture. Many of its themes are consistent with Tasmanian Gothic literature and it is considered a good modern example of the genre. It has been described as one of Nowra's great theatrical achievements.Theatre Australia  Productions  The Golden Age premiered in February 1985, presented by the Playbox Theatre Company at the Studio, Victorian Arts Centre in Melbourne. Subsequent productions include Sydney's Nimrod Theatre Company which opened at the Seymour Centre in August 1987, and a Sydney Theatre Company revival which opened in January 2016.

The painting was commissioned by the Amsterdam city council for the Town Hall. After the work had been in place briefly, it was returned to Rembrandt, who may have never been paid. Rembrandt drastically cut down the painting to a quarter of the original size to be sold. It is the last secular history painting he finished.Schwartz, G. (1987) Rembrandt. Zijn leven, zijn schilderijen, pp. 319, 320, 331. The painting is on exhibition at Nationalmuseum in Stockholm, Sweden. Depiction  Inside the palace on the second floor, with one of the lunettes by Jordaens The painting follows Tacitus's Histories in depicting an episode from the Batavian rebellion (69‚Äì70 AD), led by the one-eyed chieftain Claudius Civilis (actually called Gaius Julius Civilis by Tacitus, though but once, Claudius Civilis has since become entrenched in art history),Slive, Seymour, (1995) Dutch Painting, 1600‚Äì1800, pp. 332, n. 34, Yale UP, in which he \\"collected at one of the sacred groves, ostensibly for a banquet, the chiefs of the nation and the boldest spirits of the lower class\\", convinced them to join his rebellion, and then \\"bound the whole assembly with barbarous rites and strange forms of oath.\\"Tacitus, Histories 4.14‚Äì15 Civilis, Tacitus writes, \\"was unusually intelligent for a native, and passed himself off as a second Sertorius or Hannibal, whose facial disfigurement he shared\\"‚Äîthat is to say, the loss of one eye. He feigned friendship with Emperor Vespasian in order to regain his freedom. When he returned to his tribal grounds in the marshes of the Betuwe, he organized the revolt he had long been planning.Schwartz, G. (2006) Rembrandts Universe, His Art His Life His World, p. 179-183. Commission Floorplan second floor (1661) Rembrandt's Conspiracy was in the lower left corner The painting was commissioned for the gallery of the new city hall on the Dam, finished in 1655 (now the Royal Palace). History paintings were regarded as the highest in the hierarchy of genres in the 17th century (a view Rembrandt shared), and the Batavian revolt was regarded, and romanticised, as a precursor of the recently ended war against the Spanish.See UCLA website in external links below In 1659, when John Maurice of Nassau, Amalia of Solms-Braunfels, her two daughters and two daughters-in-law came to see the new building,Balbian Verster, J.F.L. (1925) DE CLAUDIUS CIVILIS VAN REMBRANDT. In: Amstelodamum, Jrb 22, pp. 7. the council commissioned twelve paintings from Rembrandt's ex-pupil Govert Flinck to fill all the large spaces using a programme drawn up by the poet Joost van den Vondel, but Flink died in 1660 before completing any of the works.Clark, Kenneth, An Introduction to Rembrandt, 1978, London, John Murray/Readers Union, 1978, pp. 60. The contract, after sketches had been approved, was dated November 28th, 1659. Slive:90. The work was then shared out by the burgomasters Joan Huydecoper and Andries de Graeff, who were certainly decisive, between a number of painters including Jacob Jordaens and Jan Lievens. The council provided the canvas to the artist. Rembrandt was commissioned to do the scene from Tacitus, one of eight intended to cover the revolt in the original scheme.Slive, pp. 90‚Äì91 Treatment and reception The Conspiracy of Claudius Civilis and the Batavians in the Schakerbos by Otto van Veen The sword-oath was invented by Rembrandt. There is one sword more in the painting ‚Äì the one touching the front of the leader's blade ‚Äì than Batavians holding them;Schwartz, G. (2006). Rembrandt's Universe, His Art His Life His World, p. 179-183. other depictions of the event show handshakes, especially that engraved in 1612 by Antonio Tempesta as one of a set of thirty-six illustrations to designs by Otto van Veen in the book Batavorum cum Romanis bellum on the revolt.T√ºmpel, C. (1992) Rembrandt, p. 163. In the following year, the States General had commissioned a set of twelve paintings by Van Veen on the same subject for The Hague.One of the set, now in the Rijksmuseum These baroque works had entered the popular imagination as depictions of the revolt, and Flinck's design drew on the engraving of this scene. Van Veen followed baroque ideas of decorum by always showing Civilis in profile, with only his good eye visible. Funeral ticket sketch (see text), October 1661 or later. A sketch survives (on the back of a funeral ticket dated October 1661) that shows that he had transferred the scene from Tactitus's \\"sacred grove\\" to a large vaulted hall with open arches.196 x 180 mm. Staatliche Graphihische Sammlung, Munich Online image of sketch Other drawings claimed in the past as figure sketches for this work are unlikely to be so ‚Äì see Slive:332, n.35. After delivery, which was by July 1662, the painting hung in place for a short period before being returned to him for reasons that are undocumented, but may have involved perceptions of a lack of the decorum felt necessary for history painting, lack of finish and an insufficiently heroic approach to the story. When all four paintings were in place, the discrepancy was evident.Schwartz, G. (2006) Rembrandts Universe, His Art His Life His World, p. 182. The council probably expected something similar in style, rather than the ominous grandeur of Rembrandt's conception.Fuchs, R.H.; Dutch painting; 1978, pp. 74‚Äì8, Thames and Hudson, London, and Slive, p. 90 The chiaroscuro is typical of Rembrandt's late works, but the \\"eerie light and shadow and the iridescent greyish blues and pale yellows\\" are not.Slive, p. 90 In August 1662, when the painting was still there, Rembrandt signed an agreement giving a \\"quarter-share of his profits accruing from the piece for the City Hall and his prospective earnings from it.\\"Schwartz, G.

By 24 September 1662, however, when the archbishop and elector of Cologne Maximilian Henry of Bavaria was received in the town hall, Rembrandt's painting was gone.Schmidt, H. (1920) J√ºrgen Ovens. Sein Leben und seine Werke, p. 85-88. One objection may well have been the incongruous crown that Rembrandt had set upon Claudius Civilis's head and his dominating the scene, hardly features of a consultative, republican attitude.Israel, J. (1995) The Dutch Republic, Its Rise, Greatness, and Fall 1477‚Äì1806. Clarendon Press, Oxford, p. 879. Blankert suggested that the painting had too much dark, unused space, compared with the others who had filled the image space with figures in a more conventional manner.Blankert, A. (1976) Ferdinand Bol, p. 63. For Kenneth Clark: Crenshaw writes that Rembrandt was away for a couple of months, and \\"... he did not have enough supporters in the right places when obstacles arose.\\"Crenshaw, P.

Instead, Flinck's unfinished work was retrieved and rapidly finished off by the German painter J√ºrgen Ovens in four days. Ovens, then living in the house and using the studio formerly owned by Flinck, got paid 48 guilders for his work, whereas Flinck was promised 12,000 guilders for the series of twelve paintings. Jordaens and Lievens received 1,200 guilders for each of their works.Schwartz, G. (2006) Rembrandts Universe, His Art His Life His World, p. 179-183; Balbian Verster, J.F.L.

Painting by Elias Martin (1782) On 10 August 1734, the painting was bought at auction in Amsterdam by the merchant Nicolaas Kohl from Arensborg (1675-1751). Supposedly it came to Sweden as inheritance from Kohl's widow, Sophia Grill, who died in 1766 in Zwammerdam (Netherlands). It was acquired by Anna Johanna Grill, the sole daughter of the wealthy Claes Grill. Anna Johanna (1745-1801) was married to the Stockholm merchant Henrik Wilhelm Peill (1730-1797). Probably on the advice of artist friends, perhaps because of its size, Peill deposited the painting at the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts. It can be seen hanging on the wall in the background of a painting by Elias Martin of the visit of King Gustav III to the Academy in 1782. In 1785 the painting was transferred to the Stockholm Palace.Nordenfalk (1982) p. 11; Cavalli-Bj√∂rkman/Fryns/Sid√©n (2005) p. 408 In 1798, the work was donated to the Academy of Fine Arts by Anna Johanna Grill, the widow of Peill and the sister of Adolf Ulric Grill, who was a member and for a while president of the Academy. Peill, who had previously supported the King financially in his coup d'√©tat in 1772, complied, and a plan of the royal collection shows the painting in a central position in one of the galleries. Around 1782, the painting was restored by conservator Erik Hallblad. Hallblad (1720-1814), who had developed or learnt a method for transferring an oil painting from one canvas to another, removed the paint layer from Rembrandt's original canvas and attached it to a new one. Some damage appears to have occurred during this risky process; the extra sword now seen on the painting was probably added by Hallblad to mask this. The painting is still owned by the Academy of Arts but has been deposited since 1864 in the Nationalmuseum in Stockholm.Nordenfalk (1982), p. 10-12; Bille, C. (1956) Rembrandt's Claudius Civilis and its owners in the 18th century‚Äù. In: Oud-Holland, pp. 54‚Äì59. In the beginning of the twentieth century, a Danish author, Karl Madsen, noticed the sketch from Munich and assumed that Rembrandt‚Äîafter his bankruptcy‚Äîfled to Sweden. He suggested that Rembrandt had painted the one-eyed Northern god, king and priest Odin.Balbian Verster, J.F.L. (1925) DE CLAUDIUS CIVILIS VAN REMBRANDT. In: Amstelodamum, Jrb 22, pp. 3. In fact, Rembrandt's burial in Westerkerk was discovered in 1866, and the true history of the painting had been published in 1891.Roever, N. de (1891) \\"Een Rembrandt op ‚Äòt Stadhuis\\". In: Oud-Holland IX (1891), p. 297-306 & Oud-Holland X (1892), p. 137-146. In March 2008, the Academy valued the painting at 750 million kronor (¬£61m, or $123m), but then put it on sale at 300 million kronor (¬£24m, or $49m‚Äîthat is, at a 60% discount), on the condition that it be deposited straight back to the museum, and shown there as before, after purchase. This unusual measure was taken in order to raise money for exhibitions and other activities. The painting later traveled to Amsterdam for an exhibition on Late Rembrandt, and was on display at the Rijksmuseum next to The Night Watch. From May 2017 till September 2018, the painting was the centerpiece of a special Rembrandt exhibit at the Gothenburg Museum of Art in Gothenburg, Sweden. Notes References *D'Adda, R.

The Roman Catholic church of St. Mary Magdalene The church was built at the beginning of the 17th century for the Dominican Order, combining the styles of Renaissance and Baroque, and consecrated in 1630. The church and monastery were plundered and burned in 1704 by Swedes, only to be rebuilt by 1758 with an extended nave and new Baroque facade with two towers decorated with pilasters and cornices and rococo sculptures of Saint Dominic and Saint Hyacinth. These sculptures are situated between the pediment and the tower, which were added to the preserved polygonal apse including an altarpiece presenting scenes from the life of Saint Mary Magdalene in stucco. After the suppression of the Dominican monastery by the Austrian emperor Joseph II in 1783, its building was used a prison and the church was transferred to the diocese. The church underwent subsequent minor changes, with the groundwork carried out in front of it in 1880 necessitating the addition of stairs and a balcony; in 1889 Neo-Baroque tower-helmets were installed along with a clock on the southern tower. In 1923 the monastery building was given to the Lviv Polytechnic, and in 1927 conservation work was carried out in the complex which continued until the outbreak of World War II. This work included the installation of an organ produced by the Czech Brothers Rieger workshop. Under Soviet rule the church remained open longer than most others in Lviv, operating until it was closed in 1962. Most of the interior was plundered or destroyed after this, including the side altars, sculptures, and ambo, with only the organ and altar surviving today. In 1969 the church building was assigned to the Lviv Philharmony, which established an organ concert hall in it. The parish was officially re- established in 1991 with the collapse of the Soviet Union. However, the church has not yet been returned, and at the moment remains the property of the state from which the faithful have to rent it to attend the Holy Mass.

Proteins are highly dependent on cellular environments for stability and function, therefore, mRNA localization signals are crucial for maintaining protein function. The Gurken localisation signal is an RNA regulatory element conserved across many species of Drosophila. The element consists of an RNA stem loop within the coding region of the messenger RNA that forms a signal for dynein-mediated Gurken mRNA transport to the dorsoanterior cap near the nucleus of the oocyte. Mechanism of action During Drosophila oogenesis, signaling between the germline and the soma leads to the establishment of anterior-posterior polarity in the egg and the embryo. This process involves the interaction of gurken (grk), a TGFŒ±-like protein, with torpedo (top), the Drosophila epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Localization of gurken RNA defines cell morphology by regulating the distribution of the gurken protein. Gurken mRNA transcripts which are not localized to the dorsal-anterior of an oocyte become silenced via post-translational modifications. Post-translational modifications of gurken protein have been observed to determine the protein's localization and function. Polyadenylation of gurken transcripts occur throughout oogenesis; the length of the poly(A) tail determines the stage in oogenesis at which the gurken protein is adenylated. 30-50 gurken adenlyated residues are associated in initial oogenesis whilst 50-90 adenlyated residues are associated with late-stage oogenesis. The major difference between the gurken localization signal and other localization signals is that gurken localization signals are distributed throughout coding regions, whereas the majority of the other localization signals are found in 3' untranslated regions.[9]. The gurken localization signal does not function properly if it is located in the 3' untranslated region.

He took part in the Algiers putsch of 1961 and in the Organisation arm√©e secr√®te right- wing terrorist group, which opposed what it regarded as De Gaulle's treacherous abandonment of Algeria to the FLN terrorists. Born to a divisional General of the French Army, Pierre Guillaume graduated from the √âcole Navale in 1948. During the First Indochina War, he was officer in an assault naval division (Dinassaut). In 1954, he was promoted to lieutenant de vaisseau. He attempted to sail to France on a junk named Le Manoharaactually an 8-metre ketch but ran aground on the coasts of Somalia on 13 November 1956. In late 1956, Guillaume reached Paris where he learned of the death of his brother, Jean-Marie Guillaume, a paratroop lieutenant killed in the Algerian War. He requested and was granted a transfer to the Army, and took his brother's office, from 14 July 1957 to 12 March 1958. During the Algiers putsch of 1961, he was naval counselor to general Challe. After the putsch attempt failed, he was sentenced to 4 years of imprisonment. He joined the Organisation arm√©e secr√®te, was arrested in May 1962, and sentenced to 12 years of imprisonment in Tulle prison. He later worked as a naval security consultant in Saudi Arabia and took part in operations with Bob Denard in Comoros. He also fought for the Karen in Myanmar. He eventually took on living aboard a sailship, the Agathe, moored in Saint-Malo harbour. He worked for Radio Courtoisie almost until he died. Guillaume was a close friend of Jean- Marie Le Pen and interviewed him in several occasions for the radio. After his death, his memoirs were published under the title Mon √¢me √† Dieu, mon corps √† la Patrie, mon honneur √† moi (\\"My soul for God, my body for the Fatherland, my honour to myself\\").

One version is that he was born in a village called Ort Simmern near Trier (Treves). Only one place is documentarily supported in a Protestant church Register as Walter Reinhard's Birth Place: Eisenberg in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany . The register indicates, he was born at that place on January 27, 1723.https://web.archive.org/web/20170202063013/http://www.reg- sardhana.de/introduction.htm Career He entered early into the French Service assuming the name of Summer, but due to the darkness of his complexion, he received the French nickname Sombre. His nickname Summer, Samru, Sumroo, Somroo, Sombrou, Somrou, Somru, Sumru. was a nom de guerre, and is more commonly used for him, in Indian sources. He was a turncoat, changing sides for advantage. Soon after his enlistment in the French Service, he went to Bengal, entered a Swiss Corps in Calcutta from which he deserted in 15 days, fled to the Upper Provinces and served some time as a private trooper in the cavalry of Sufdur Jung. This service, he also quit and became attached to the service of Mir Qasim, Nawab of Bengal. While in the Nawab's service he was blamed for a massacre of English captives at Patna.Mir Kasim was defeated in two pitched battles at Gheria and Udhanala (Oodeynullah) in August and September 1763, and in revenge ordered the massacre of all his prisoners, which was carried out with the help of a renegade in his employment named Walter Reinhardt, (afterwards the husband of the famous Begum Samru). About sixty Englishmen were murdered on this occasion, the bodies being thrown into a well belonging to the house in which they were confined. In The Fall of the Mogul Empire of Hindustan, H. G. Keene describes this massacre: :In the meanwhile the unscrupulous heroes who were founding the British Government of India had thought proper to quarrel with their new instrument Mir Kasim, whom they had so lately raised to the Masnad of Bengal. This change in their councils had been caused by an insubordinate letter addressed to the Court of Directors by Clive's party, which had led to their dismissal from employ. The opposition then raised to power consisted of all the more corrupt members of the service; and the immediate cause of their rupture with Mir Kasim was about the monopoly they desired to have of the local trade for their own private advantage. They were represented at that Nawab's Court by Mr. Ellis, the most violent of their body; and the consequence of his proceedings was, in no long time, seen in the murder of the Resident and all his followers, in October, 1763. The scene of this atrocity (which remained without a parallel for nearly a century) was at Patna, which was then threatened and soon after stormed by the British; and the actual instrument was a Franco-German, Walter Reinhardt by name, of whom, as we are to hear much more hereafter, it is as well here to take note. This European executioner of Asiatic barbarity is generally believed to have been a native of Treves, in the Duchy of Luxemburg, who came to India as a sailor in the French navy. From this service he is said to have deserted to the British, and joined the first European battalion raised in Bengal. Thence deserting he once more entered the French service; was sent with a party who vainly attempted to relieve Chandarnagar, and was one of the small party who followed Law when that officer took command of those, who refused to share in the surrender of the place to the British. After the capture of his ill-starred chief, Reinhardt (whom we shall in future designate by his Indian sobriquet of \\"Sumroo,\\" or Sombre) took service under Gregory, or Gurjin Khan, Mir Kasim's Armenian General. Broome, however, adopts a somewhat different version. According to this usually careful and accurate historian, Reinhardt was a Salzburg man who originally came to India in the British service, and deserted to the French at Madras, whence he was sent by Lally to strengthen the garrison of the Bengal settlement. The details are not very material: Sumroo had certainly learned war both in English and French schools. He again deserted from the Newab, served successively the Principal Chiefs of the time, and died in 1776. Personal life Later on, Walter Reinhardt formed his own mercenary army, in which Jats also served. In about 1767, when he was 42, he met and married (or started living with) a 14-year-old Nautch girl named Farzana, who became known as Begum Samru. Sumroo moved from Lucknow to Rohilkhand (near Bareilly), then to Agra, Deeg and Bharatpur and back to the Doab. At one time, he was Governor of Agra. He attained a position from Shah Alam II, briefly held before his death, ruling Sardhana. He was General of Maharaja Jawahar Singh of Bharatpur Death Sombre died at Agra on 4 May 1778. He was buried in the Agra churchyard by his widow, Begum Samru. His burial place in the Roman Catholic cemetery is preserved to this day. His widow took over his mercenary army and succeeded to the rule of Sardhana. Book A modern novelist, Vikram Chandra, has used the character of Sumroo in his book \\"Red Earth and Pouring Rain\\". In this book, fiction intermingles with history and myth. The dramatis personae include the historical adventurers, the Frenchman Benoit de Boigne (1751‚Äì1830), the German Walter Reinhardt (1720‚Äì1778) and the Irishman George Thomas (1756‚Äì1802).

One day Keiichi accidentally dials the Goddess Relief Office. After summoning Belldandy by accident, he ends up wishing for her to be by his side forever. Ever since, the two have been together. Keiichi's pure and innocent personality also puts him in the middle of an unusual love relationship. While he understands his love for Belldandy, he sometimes has a difficult time expressing his feelings. He is a very skilled mechanic and an exceptional race driver. He is bestowed the directorship of the Motor Club, which he subsequently passes on to Sora Hasegawa. At his supposed graduation from college, he started working at the repair shop Whirlwind owned by the founder of the NIT Motor Club: Chihiro Fujimi. He picked up the one class and actually graduated many chapters later. Since he met Belldandy, Keiichi has had many extraordinary experiences in his young life, including having met several other Goddesses and supernatural beings. He became the only person ever to have flown the Shinden, an experimental World War II Japanese airplane, and met Schr√∂dinger's Whales‚Äîand saved them from extinction by teaching them songs. Keiichi's personality is illustrated when he summons one of Lind's own Angels, Cool Mint. Lind gave him one of her angels because he is able to host the angel with the love of the three goddesses, which he received due to his innocent personality. Later on, Keiichi also temporarily and involuntarily hosts the demon-angel Blue Lance. Belldandy explains that the angel chose him to be host because he was the only person to refer to her as an \\"angel\\" and not a \\"former demon\\". =Belldandy= is a goddess who ends up contractually bound to Keiichi Morisato after he accidentally dials the Goddess Relief Office. Ever since, Belldandy dwells with Keiichi at the Tariki Hongan Temple in the city of Nekomi, Chiba Prefecture near Tokyo. She can cancel the contract at any time, but she states Keiichi is a special person in her heart, and that her purpose is to make him happy. This also evidenced by what she says after the Lord of Terror's Arc is concluded in which she tells Keiichi \\"I'm here now because I love you.\\" Belldandy is kind, patient, and warm, not only to Keiichi, but to everyone, without exception. She can easily sense other people's emotions, and tries her best to be empathetic to all those around her. However, even though Belldandy tries her best to be as kind as possible, it is revealed that at times, as a result of latent jealousy, she can become very insecure and sad, especially when she is confronted with an implication that involves Keiichi in one way or another. This can sometimes result in power leaks that affect everything within the vicinity, commonly referred to as \\"jealousy storms\\" in the anime. Belldandy is licensed as a goddess first-class, unlimited, and as such is highly skilled. In the manga is revealed that she also has a Valkyrie License, only because she likes to collect such kind of things. Her power is so great, in fact, that she is required to wear a special earring on her left ear which constantly seals the full brunt of her magical strength. Belldandy's angel is ; her elemental attribute is wind. Like all angels, Holy Bell augments Belldandy's magical powers when called upon, and like all angels, she also reflects her master's current state. =Urd= is Belldandy's older half sister and is the second Goddess to appear to Keiichi Morisato. Urd ranks as Goddess second class, management category limited license, similar to her youngest sister Skuld. She is the Yggdrasil System Administrator and Manager. Though she is much more powerful than her sisters, she has not become a first class goddess, most recently because she chose not to become a first class goddess. Urd shares a common father with her younger sisters, but has a different mother, the Demon Lord Hild. Because of this, Urd is a hybrid of Goddess and Demon, reflected in the half-white, half-black appearance of her Angel, . Urd fancies herself a Goddess of Love, so she comes to Earth to spur Keiichi onward with love potions and well-meaning, but deceitful advice, but as punishment for deserting her post and for using her powers on Earth without authorization, The Almighty banishes her from Heaven until further notice. After being allowed to go back, she decides to stay on Earth instead. =Skuld= is the younger sister of Belldandy, and is the third Goddess to appear to Keiichi Morisato. Skuld has a Goddess second class, type one, limited license, a category similar to her eldest sister, Urd. Skuld is one of Yggdrasil's system debuggers. She compensates for her lack of magic power with her innate talent for invention, which is known throughout Heaven. Skuld is an engineering genius, capable of building just about anything out of the most mundane parts under most limited resources. She can compute equations and redesign even the most complex engineering blueprints in no time. She travels to Earth after Belldandy's proximity to Keiichi started creating an increasing number of bugs in Heaven's supercomputer Yggdrasil. At least that was her official excuse, as she believed Belldandy was living with Keiichi against her will. She tried to convince Belldandy to return to Heaven to resolve the bug problem and at the same time with the ulterior motive of alleviating her loneliness. After realizing that Belldandy's relationship with Keiichi was not going to end any time soon, Skuld decides to stay on Earth and act as Belldandy's unofficial chaperon. In the second season she begins to develop her goddess powers. Her angel's name is . Heaven Heaven is one of the two divine factions in the series. It is where the three main goddesses and several other characters reside. It contains, , the heavenly computer system that maintains reality, with the Gods and Goddesses acting as its programmers, system administrators, and debuggers. Yggdrasil works with the Goddess Relief Office by notifying the goddesses such as Belldandy working at the office of people whose fortune and misfortune is out of balance given their actions such as fortitude in facing misfortune, kindness in sympathizing with others. Each person Yggdrasil chooses is granted one wish which can be anything ranging from \\"wealth that would last a lifetime\\" to the destruction of the world, or even for simply a \\"Girl like you\\". =Almighty= , or Manga Volume 46, ch. 294. is the Lord (God) of Heaven. As Lord of Heaven, all goddesses ultimately answer to Him and He is responsible for maintaining reality, time, and probability as we know it. His attitude and personality is very commanding, but He is very polite and forgiving; he has forgiven the Norns for disobeying his orders multiple times (as is suggested by Keiichi in the manga). The Almighty One is very blunt and straightforward. He does not understand how humans act and communicate; possibly because He has not been to Earth in a long time. Throughout the manga and anime He is an unseen character as viewers never see His face, which is usually shrouded in shadow, turned away, or simply too close-up; all that can be discerned is that the Almighty One is tall and well-built, with long black hair. In chapter 294, he appears as a Gate character and calls himself Tyr, with the title of . In the anime, during the Trouble with Doublets saga (in the Dark Horse Comics translation of the manga), Belldandy answers the phone and tells her sisters \\"It's the Almighty.\\" After Urd loses odds and evens against Skuld, she answers with \\"Oh goodness, Daddy?! It's been ages!\\" However, in the original Japanese version, Kami-sama is not referred to in this way. It is very likely that it is a translation error, as is the case with the OVA dub script, where Kami-sama is referred to as the Norns' father as well. In the subtitles for the OVA he is referred to simply as \\"Lord\\" in the places where the dub uses \\"father\\". =Peorth= is the fourth goddess of the series, and she enters the story when Keiichi accidentally calls her up one day, much like he did Belldandy. She is part of the Earth Help Center, and a Goddess First-class, Second Category, Unlimited. For a time, Peorth harbored a deep resentment towards Belldandy because Belldandy had reported the removal of a bug in Yggdrasil as a team effort. Believing Belldandy was pitying her, she held a grudge. During her stay she continually tried to seduce Keiichi in order to seem more of use to him than Belldandy, though she ultimately falls in love with him. However, after the misunderstanding is cleared up, Peorth remarks that she does not hate Belldandy anymore, and in recent appearances the two seem to be on friendly terms once again. Still, Peorth's incessant flirting with Keiichi puts some strains upon this new relationship. Her magic is based on the element of Earth, mainly associated with roses, as with her own angel, . =Lind= is the fifth Goddess to appear in the series. Lind is a Valkyrie, a member of the battle division of Heaven. Like the Goddesses Belldandy and Peorth, Lind carries a First Class License. However, unlike the other two, Lind's license is classified as \\"Special Duty, Unlimited\\", which denotes her position as a Valkyrie. Her elemental domain is ice, even though she is able to control fire and lightning beams perfectly. In an unlikely turn of events, Lind obtained twin angels, and , though at first she could only call upon one of them at a time, causing her to be teased all throughout Heaven and Hell. Frustrated by her 'weakness' and resulting inability to call forth her second Angel, Lind threw herself into Valkyrie training with incredible ferocity. This intense training gained Lind the reputation as a Goddess of extreme violence. Eventually, she is able to call out both her angels by realizing that she lacked a belief in herself and a trust towards others during her fight with the Angel Eater planted inside of her by Hild in an attempt to replace her angels with devils. She has since become more open and smiles often. She has also established close friendships with Keiichi Morisato and Belldandy. Lind is notoriously bad at handling magic for constructive purposes, usually resulting in distortion and misshapen objects; it goes as far as altering the very essence of the object, rendering it unable to gain its original shape. =Chrono, Ere & Ex= Chrono Ere Ex , and are three goddesses who maintain Yggdrasil in the anime. They generally help Peorth and Lind and such by giving relevant exposition, or lines to increase dramatic tension. They also serve as people for Peorth or Lind to give orders to, allowing the commanding character to verbally direct the conflict, and to explain the dangerous nature of certain actions. Chrono is the sixth goddess to present in the human world. Like Lind and Peorth (initially), however, she stayed only for a few chapters, chapters 231-239 of the manga. Chrono is terrified of cats due to a childhood trauma up in the heavens with her pet cat, and she avoids Velsper like the plague. She also practices martial arts, aiming for a post in the Valkyrie ranks. At the end of her arc, Lind confesses to Peorth that she is interested in Chrono, so she'll recommend her for promotion to the \\"Silver Wings\\" unit. In the manga we can see this new goddess with a different hair color than in the movie: instead of being brown, she seems to be blonde or with a very light hair at least. Ere and Ex have so far only been glimpsed in the manga, in a cartoon when Chrono gets back in heaven, showing the two goddesses interrupted in their discussion during a scene in which Peorth teases Chrono and later when Hagal's demons make too many contracts with humans unbalancing Heaven's equilibrium. =Ansuz= , is the CEO of the Goddess Collective and the mother of Skuld and Belldandy. She is married to Hild's ex-husband prior to the events in the series. She acts as the Interracial Romance Inquisitor when Belldandy gives the Kiss of Truth on Keiichi, and facilitates their Judgment Gate trial. She is named after the ancient Norse rune, and the name of a god in Germanic paganism. =Eir & Saga= Eir and Saga (OVA Itsudemo Futari De) =Hild= is incredibly powerful, with her power dwarfing even the combined strength of the three goddesses. Despite her immense power, she respects the doublet system, and thus limits her power to prevent killing any of the Goddesses. She is Urd's mother, whom she loves deeply, though Urd does not return the feeling (it is revealed that doing so would mean that Urd would acknowledge and thus be taken over by her demonic side). Hild displays a similar witty personality to Urd, though she is far more mean-spirited, and a fondness for dressing in revealing outfits. Hild dislikes Belldandy, because Belldandy's attitude and love for humanity reminds her of Belldandy and Skuld's father and the relationship they once had. Because of this, she has often tried to corrupt or hurt Belldandy several times throughout the series. She also seems to have some feelings for Keiichi Morisato. She appears a few times before leaving an avatar child version of herself, who would go on to become a regular antagonist for the goddesses, as well as a direct supervisor for Marller. While this avatar possesses only one thousandth of the true Hild's power, it is still enough to make the avatar a powerful enemy for anyone. Despite this, as well as being generally more competent than Marller, she often proved just as inept. In the manga, a small team of demons sealed her main body and attacked her avatar in the human world. =Lord of Terror= The is a virus that runs on Yggdrasil. It is divided into two parts‚Äîthe will of the Lord of Terror, and the \\"Ultimate Destruction Program\\", Fenrir. It wants to destroy the world and create a world for demons in its place (this happens only in the anime, while in the manga we can see that his intent is to destroy the entire universe in order to create a new, violent one; this is the reason why Keiichi, possessed by the program, wants Skuld to build a 10 dimensional scythe for cutting the 10 dimensional string of the universe, which permit its existence). The heir to the Lord of Terror was Urd, because of her mixed ancestry. Basically, the Great Lord's will influenced Urd and eventually sealed her will away. It then utilized the urn Mao Za Haxon, which contained the Ultimate Destruction Program's bootup. After it had possessed Keiichi, Belldandy told it to transfer to her but it could not possess her, as the base wavelength was different, and was quickly forced to transfer itself to a floppy disk and was then erased by Skuld with a magnet. =Urn of Hakushon the Demon King= Marller took from a cave and woke up to start the Lord of Terror. The legend states that a bronze-skin demon will become the Lord of Terror. The entices Urd to release her demonic side when she was suspended for walking off her job because Belldandy was sick. Later, the Urn has the direction to release the Ultimate Destruction Program. It was broken by Belldandy with an arrow that was the final step to release the Ultimate Destruction Program. =Marller= Marller or was once the childhood friend of Urd, even though she is a demon. Urd and Mara used to be very good friends, but got separated when Urd chose to be a goddess. Her actual duty is to increase the market share of the demons on earth, though she decides that removing the goddesses will make it one hundred percent. Like her Buddhist namesake, she is generally regarded only as a nuisance; extremely inept, generally failing due to her sheer incompetence, and on some rare occasions because she actually helps the goddesses. Like Urd, because of her demonic heritage Marller has a music-based weakness: when hearing hard rock, she is compelled to dance until exhausted. Likewise, the close proximity or touch of good luck charms has adverse effects on her; the accidental touch of a hamaya (demon-slaying arrow) once caused complete, if temporary, amnesia. =Senbee= is the miniature genie and the self-proclaimed god of disaster and poverty. He constantly shifts accents while speaking, and lives by the philosophy of happiness being finite in the universe. Because of this belief, he places all sorts of misfortunes on others to raise his own happiness, often doing so by magically causing bad luck or accidents. He usually serves as a minion of Marller. =Velsper= , also known as Welsper, is a demon, who is in a doublet, a link of fate established to preserve the balance between Heaven and Hell, with Belldandy. The doublets normally forget each other, but Velsper cursed himself to remain in child form in exchange for remembering his encounter with Belldandy. The curse could only be broken if Belldandy speaks his name. It turned out that his body could not handle his growing power, so he worked to break the curse by stopping time. After installing a virus in Yggdrasil, he ends up having the curse broken, and returns to the demon realm. However, because Velsper hacked into Yggdrasil, he was punished afterwards by being reincarnated into a kitten. He cursed himself again in order to retain his memories from before reincarnation; the consequence of the curse is that he is a female cat. As a cat and penalty-boxed demon she hosts an angel, formerly a tsukaima (demon servant). Hild had implanted it into Belldandy.( during the \\"Angel Eater\\" arc as shown in the 20th Anniversary OVA special \\"Ah! My Goddess: Fighting Wings\\") Belldandy had turned it to the good but was unable to support two angels. It was temporarily passed onto Keiichi, then to Velsper. Velsper's black fur became white spotted, but returned normal after she named this angel (\\"The Wasp of the Blue Lance\\" in German). =Hagall= , is the second most powerful demon in Hell, who takes the control of Niflheim‚ÄîThe Hell‚Äîin a rebellion against Hild, because she thinks Hild has lost the power and glory of the demon world. Through an elaborate plan to get more share of wishes on Earth and to destroy everything related to the Goddesses, she imprisons Hild and sends her servants to attack Chibi-Hild on Earth, however Hild manages to escape and goes with Belldandy to ask for help (the story is currently being developed in the manga‚Äîchapters 240 till 275). Hagall usually talks about herself in third person and her powers include mental control and hypnotism. She is a very selfish and ambitious demon who does not consider the energetic balance between Heaven and Hell (brought by human contracts). Later it was revealed her coup was simply a ruse and she's always been loyal to Hild, using the situation to show her an ideal world for demons. =Halval= , also known as Halvalth, is a powerful demon who serves Hagall in a rebellion against Hild. Her name has the 'rune of sound' \\"√û\\" (Thurisaz, Thorn or Thurs). Her main power is an ability \\"to see sounds\\" and combat in complete darkness. She battled against Keiichi and Belldandy in episodes 251 to 255 of the manga. In episode 255, Halval lost the fight through a plan of Keiichi Morisato: he was influenced by the kiss of Chibi- Hild who transferred some of her knowledge to him before she went back to Niflheim. =Thrymr= , also known as Thrym, is a demon who serves Hagall in the rebellion, that specializes in physical strength. She is a strong and muscular woman, with short hair. She challenges Belldandy and co. and blocks their passage through Niffelheim from chapters 257 to 261. Her strength is so immense she's able to deflect sound-waves by punching in the air. After the battle she becomes friendly with the group after healing Keiichi's wounds and later wonders if anybody worthy of her strength will challenge her again. =Hrungnir= Hrungnir (also translated as ) is also a demon who serves Hagall. She wears a mask and a helmet somewhat resembling an old German World War I uniform. She is a \\"puppeteer\\" in that she's able to create and control robots and machines similar to Skuld. Unlike Skuld, she views her creations as tools rather than affection as Skuld does. Unsurprisingly, when Keiichi and confront her, due to disabling magic in the room she ends up fighting Skuld. Nekomi Nekomi is a Japanese town that acts as the main setting of the series. It houses the Nekomi Institute of Technology, where Keiichi attends, and the Tariki Hongan Temple, where he and the goddesses reside. =Toshiyuki Aoshima= is a playboy around the Nekomi Institute of Technology campus and Sayoko's cousin. He is enamoured by Belldandy and tries often to steal her away from Keiichi, going as far as to set up a rival motor club. However, in just about all of his attempts, he fails miserably. In the TV series, he and his cousin Sayoko can be identified by the supercars that they drive, in Aoshima's case, an Enzo Ferrari (Ferrari 288 GTO in the manga). =Banpei= (changed to Banpei RX in the English edition of the anime) is a humanoid robot that was designed and built by Skuld. Banpei-kun's primary function is to guard the temple, originally from Marller, however, this has expanded to include any threat the demons send, and even to 'protecting' Belldandy from Keiichi Morisato. Banpei has gradually gained many new abilities as Skuld continues to create new add-ons or new functionality for him. Originally, he required a direct power connection via an external cable but was later given a battery. This allows him to travel anywhere for extended periods of time; however, when the battery runs low Banpei has to shut down and enter memory preservation mode. Banpei's program continues to evolve on its own: Banpei gained sentience, an appreciation for life and, after meeting Sigel, the ability to love. Even though Sigel is not interested in Banpei, he is not disheartened, and spends a great deal of time and energy trying to get her to appreciate him; he will also not hesitate to risk serious damage to himself if only to help her. His emotional circuit will work at varying degrees, from being completely shut off, to being almost alive; in recent times it has gained stability, ensuring that he remains \\"alive\\" at all times. Unable to express emotion, Banpei will at times use a permanent marker to draw what he is feeling on his face: a tear for sadness, a furrowed brow, and clenched teeth for anger. =Chihiro Fujimi= is the original founder and director of the Nekomi Institute of Technology Motor Club. She is a resolute person and an incredibly skilled mechanic and motorcycle driver, even more so than Keiichi. She starts up her own motorcycle shop called Whirlwind and hires Keiichi and Belldandy to work for her. Normally a no-nonsense personality, she has a soft spot for cute objects, cats and children and seems to enjoy relaxing activities (such as bathing in an onsen) and having fun. She drives a Krauser Domani SSi. When she was director of the N.I.T. motor club, both Tamiya and Otaki confessed they loved her but she turned them both down rather than cause conflict in the club. Both Tamiya and Otaki respect and fear her very much, obediently following her orders. Chihiro is voiced by Yuka Imai in the Japanese version of the series. In the English versions, she is voiced by Dorothy Elias-Fahn in Ah! My Goddess: The Movie and by Veronica Taylor in Ah My Goddess: Flights of Fancy. =Gan-chan= , also known as , is the much- abused temple rat from the Adventures of Mini-Goddess series. Generally nice and friendly, Gan is somewhat emotional and very excitable, but highly prone to gluttony. Due to his nice and trusting nature, he is often led off on some wild adventure by Skuld and Urd, with the end result of Gan getting physically abused in some way. Gan has a crush on and prefers the company of Belldandy, since she is much quieter (and far from being violent towards him) than her sisters. =Sora Hasegawa= is a member of the Nekomi Tech Motor Club. A rather timid, mousy girl, she looks up to Keiichi and Belldandy. Throughout the series, the two help her to overcome her lack of confidence and believe in herself. When Keiichi leaves to work for Chihiro's company Whirlwind, he bestows the directorship of the Motor Club to her. She accepts the position, despite the fact that previous clubs that were led by her all collapsed (though not necessarily by her fault). Every time she gets drunk, she whines to Keiichi about how people think she is a middle school student, flashing her chest to show she is growing breasts to him. She has a crush on Toshiyuki Aoshima. =Hijiri= is a little girl whom Keiichi befriends before meeting Belldandy for the first time. Appearing only in the TV series, Hijiri has become a running joke in the series, appearing from time to time in minor roles in the stories, such as being shown witnessing the Goddesses' dramatic battles, accidentally kidnapping a spirit that was transformed by Marller, or simply being there at the right time to help Keiichi get a meal. =Sentaro Kawanishi= is a boy who loves riding his bike around the neighborhood in Nekomi. He meets Skuld during the time where she was learning to ride a bike. He was the one who taught her that it did not matter if she fell off the first few times she tried, what mattered was that she got back up, and eventually she learned. This coincided with Skuld's magical powers slowly developing‚Äîit was revealed that a Goddess' power comes from loving others. Skuld started to fall in love with Sentaro, and hence her powers started to develop. Sentaro eventually moves away with his family, though Skuld does not become sad by it, as she claims that despite the distance they will always meet when they want. It turns out that Sentaro only moved to the town just across the river. Urd's comments regarding this embarrassed Sentaro and angered Skuld. It is unclear whether or not Sentaro is aware that Skuld is a goddess, but he has seen Skuld use her powers, has heard her state that she is the goddess of the future, has seen Skuld's angel, and he has stated (albeit through inner-dialogue) that she looks like a goddess. =Koshian= is the Buddhist priest and caretaker of the Tariki Hongan temple where Keiichi and the Goddesses reside. After witnessing Belldandy's \\"spiritual enlightenment\\", Koshian left on a pilgrimage to seek his own enlightenment, leaving his temple and house in the care of Keiichi and Belldandy. He returns in the anime at one point after traveling for eleven months, but soon gets caught up in a fight and leaves again. After returning a second time, he appears briefly, kicking Belldandy (who at that time has an evil mark on her head) and Keiichi out; but when Belldandy gets her goddess licences back, she and Keiichi return to the temple. He is last seen watching Belldandy's lighting burst, calling it the \\"Great Dragon\\"; then he disappears for the rest of the series. =Sayoko Mishima= is a popular girl at Nekomi Tech, to the point where she considers herself the \\"queen\\" of the school. She is also quite rich, coming from a wealthy family: she has her own apartment and an expensive car (Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren, appeared in TV Series), and gets to throw lavish parties with very important people. When Belldandy appears, all the guys' attention turns to her rather than Sayoko. Mishima begins to get jealous of Belldandy and wants to make her upset by seducing Keiichi, even though she does not have any interest in him. She even goes to the lengths of teaming up with Toshiyuki Aoshima and Marller to bring her down. Gradually, as the series progresses, she becomes less and less antagonistic, even offering Keiichi relationship advice and foiling Marller's schemes. It seems as though she develops feelings for Keiichi at the beginning of season 2, when she did not feel as lonely when he was with her. Sayoko has seen both Urd and Belldandy use their powers, although she now believes that Belldandy is a witch. She is shown to have much pride, and seems to almost enjoy competing with Belldandy at times. =Keima Morisato= is Keiichi and Megumi's father. Keima, like his children, is incredibly skilled as a mechanic and as a motorcycle driver (though he is actually a glass blower). He dislikes being called \\"father\\" and much prefers to be addressed by his given name. He also has a severe form of heterophobia (fear of members of the opposite sex), except for people that he loves. Belldandy was the only \\"stranger\\" who did not trigger this fear upon first contact. =Megumi Morisato= is Keiichi Morisato's younger sister. She attends the Nekomi Institute of Technology, like Keiichi, as an engineering student. Megumi is also a very skilled mechanic and motorcycle driver. She goes on to become the \\"queen\\" of bike racers around Nekomi. Belldandy has remarked that she sees a similarity between Megumi and Skuld, and that she would like to see Skuld learn some things from Megumi. As we know from the recent developments in the manga, she has a lot of success with boys, but she is not lucky in love because all of her boyfriends feel eclipsed by her motor-queen status and overshadowed by Keiichi. =Takano Morisato= is Keiichi and Megumi's mother. Takano is a master player of mahjong and easily beats Skuld, Urd and Peorth at the game. She is also a much more confident and outgoing person than her husband, Keima. =Shohei Yoshida= Voiced by: Naomi Shindo (Japanese), Michael Sinterniklaas (English) Shohei Yoshida (ÂêâÁî∞ Êô∂Âπ≥ Yoshida Shohei) was the temporary boyfriend of Urd in Episode 25 (bonus DVD episode) when she shrank due to problems at Yggdrasil as a result of the Lord of Terror incident. After spending a few days together, their relationship ends when Urd returns to her normal size and confronts Shohei, but not before she gives something special to him to remember her by. In both the original manga and the TV series, Shohei entertains Urd by lending her his handheld game console. In the manga, it's a NEC TurboExpress while in the anime it's a Sony PSP. The scene where Shohei meets the grown up (fully restored) Urd and she tells him that her \\"little sister\\" has left is different in the manga and anime. In the manga, the parting is final and Shohei understands that he'll never see \\"little Urd\\" once again. In the anime, Urd tells him to grow up quick and kisses him on the forehead, leaving the chance for a future relationship open. =Shiho Sakakibara= is a freshman in electronics at Nekomi Institute of Technology. She is also a second year correspondence course student in exorcism. Shiho first makes herself known to Keiichi through a secret letter that Keiichi, Urd, and Belldandy take to be a love letter. When Keiichi approaches the rendezvous mentioned in the letter with Belldandy and Urd, he finds that she is indeed very cute. However, she does not seem interested in a relationship with Keiichi, rather only to find out whether or not he is possessed by a demon. She is invited back to Keiichi's residence. At times, she becomes too friendly with Keiichi, making Belldandy jealous. =Sigel= was originally an antique welcome mannequin with the form of a ten-year-old girl, with a \\"welcome\\" message recorded in an internal tape player. The property of an antique shop, Skuld's utility robot Banpei fell in love with the mannequin on first sight, even going so far as to take her immobile form out on a date. The mannequin's voice player finally broke down and she was sent to the scrapyard, to be claimed by Whirlwind Garage owner Chihiro. Chihiro gave the mannequin, with a new digital voice player, to Skuld. After Skuld re-makes the mannequin into a sentient, walking robot, it demonstrates a reluctance to establish a relationship with Banpei, though she secretly does have a soft spot for him due to his devotion for her. This welcome robot was not named until much later by Belldandy, who named her after the Anglo-Saxon futhorc s-rune, Sigel. Sigel shows a great deal of admiration and affection for Skuld, whom she addresses as \\"mistress\\", and she has also been seen showing respect for Belldandy. Sigel tries her best to keep demons away from the temple, although she lacks the impressive array of weapons that Banpei has. Her only weapons are skating wheels in the heels of her feet and detachable rocket punch hands (when asked about these, Skuld states that they are standard issue for robots). =The Three Ninjas= ;: The infiltration specialist and Mistress of Illusion. ;: The weapons and assault specialist who wears a distinctive spiked ball helmet. ;: The recon specialist. She uses a recorder to effect her magic and summon their ninja auxiliaries. A trio of diminutive female ninja operatives created by Marller (apparently from transformed rats) to serve as her agents of chaos against the goddesses. They are expert fighters with all sorts of weapons. They are named after the three Shinkansen (bullet) trains in Japan. The three ninjas were sent in one by one to eliminate the goddesses, but they failed in their task, mostly due to Belldandy's friendliness towards them. Eventually, they decided to quit their service with Marller and moved into the temple proper. They rarely appear in the mainstream series from that point on, but they do have several appearances in the Mini-Goddess comic strips and anime television series. =Tamiya and Otaki= and are the ex-directors of the Nekomi Motor Club. Tora (a dark-skinned, hulking man) and Hiko (who dresses in punk-style) are rather crude and brash seniors of Keiichi who make life very hard for him by passing on a lot of work to him. However, they have a great deal of respect for Keiichi's abilities both as a mechanic and a driver. In the manga, they pass the directorship of the Motor Club to Keiichi as they graduate. They were also both in love with the original director of the motor club, Chihiro Fujimi; however, she rejected both of them for the sake of the club. On the topic of love, Hiko later falls in love with Satoko after fixing her scooter, then proceeds to going out with her, and eventually even gaining Satoko's father's approval as his son in law. Tora addresses Hiko as \\"Dai- chan\\" (the Kanji \\"Â§ß\\" in Otaki's name is \\"O\\" but can be pronounced as \\"Dai\\") and Hiko addresses Tora as \\"Den-chan.\\" =Satoko Yamano= is a freshman in electronics at Nekomi Institute of Technology. She is quite attractive (even Keiichi Morisato comments that she is one of the top five most attractive girls at school); in the TV anime series, she is also a member of the Nekomi Arts Club and a huge cosplay fan. Satoko meets Otaki when her scooter breaks down on campus and Otaki decides to help her despite the insistence of one of her suitors, that she ride his car instead. They start going out and she eventually gets her father's approval of Otaki. However, afterwards the progress of their relationship is left unrevealed. References Oh My Goddess!

He last played for PAEEK FC in Cyprus, previously he played for Anagennisi Karditsa in the Gamma Ethniki. A striker, he is 192 cm tall.  Career  Born in Kalabaka, Vakouftsis began playing football for Panathinaikos' youth side. His body shape led Fiorentina's scouts to sign him from Panathinaikos youth team in 1999. His early performance was one of the key factors for Vakouftsis to gain the nickname \\"Il Greco Batistuta\\", due to the Argentine legend striker of Viola. His return in the Greek Superleague for Iraklis FC on loan did not meet expectations, and in 2002 he moved in Cyprus to play for APOEL and later for rivals AC Omonia. In Cyprus Vakouftsis proved his calibre, scoring 52 goals in 113 appearances for the two clubs. In 2008, he moved back in Greece to play for Cretan club Ergotelis F.C. and in the summer of 2009 he signed for Skoda Xanthi F.C. Vakouftsis played only three games for Xanthi in the league and because he was considered as a backup for the first team he requested a transfer. On 14 January 2010 he signed for Anagennisi Karditsa F.C. which caused much surprise in the Greek football transfer market. His contract is for six months and he is considered as a great addition to the squad. In January 2011 he returned to Cyprus to play for PAEEK FC in the second division. His former clubs include: Panathinaikos, ACF Fiorentina, Ravenna Calcio, Iraklis FC, APOEL, AC Omonia, Ergotelis F.C. and Skoda Xanthi F.C.

The Salt River below Granite Reef is usually dry except following consistent and heavy upstream precipitation. When upstream lakes are full, minor and moderate releases are accomplished via floodgates at either end of the dam. The dam is designed to be overtopped by major releases, which can occur every 10 to 40 years. The dam is long, high. Its volume is . The United States Bureau of Reclamation built the dam between 1906 and 1908 to replace Arizona Dam washed out in 1905.. It is operated by the Salt River Project, an electric cooperative.

He was a war veteran with service in Vietnam.Revealed in the season 2 premiere, \\"The Human Factor\\" At an unknown time, he left the military and joined the Department of External Services (DXS), a U.S. government agency involved in intelligence and black ops work. He met MacGyver there in 1980 while tracking the international assassin Murdoc, and was so impressed that he recruited him into the DXS.Season 2, Episode 18 - \\"Partners\\". This episode recounts the events that took place. He reaches the position of Deputy Chief of the Department in 1986 before leaving later that same year. He then goes to work for the Phoenix Foundation as Director of Operations, and takes MacGyver with him as a troubleshooter. Pete settles down with a desk job, but still is involved in many field operations along with MacGyver. In 1991, actor Dana Elcar began to develop glaucoma, a degenerative condition of the eyes that causes blindness. This condition was written into the show, and Elcar's character also develops the disease. 2016 Reboot For the 2016 reboot, Pete was rewritten as a woman, named Patricia Thornton.

The static pressure inside the chamber was used to control the degree of collapse of the tube, so providing a variable resistor.

Starling resistors have been used both as an instrument in the study of interesting physiological phenomena (e.g. pharyngeal collapse during obstructed breathing or OSA) and as a rich source of physical phenomena in their own right. Two non-linear behaviours are characteristic: 1) the ‚Äúwaterfall effect‚Äù wherein, subsequent to collapse, the flow through the tube becomes independent of the downstream pressure and 2) self-excited oscillations.

Symptoms include coughing up sputum, wheezing, shortness of breath, and chest pain. Bronchitis can be acute or chronic. Acute bronchitis usually has a cough that lasts around three weeks, and is also known as a chest cold. In more than 90% of cases the cause is a viral infection. These viruses may be spread through the air when people cough or by direct contact. A small number of cases are caused by a bacterial infection such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae or Bordetella pertussis. Risk factors include exposure to tobacco smoke, dust, and other air pollution. Treatment of acute bronchitis typically involves rest, paracetamol (acetaminophen), and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to help with the fever. Chronic bronchitis is defined as a productive cough ‚Äì one that produces sputum ‚Äì that lasts for three months or more per year for at least two years. Many people with chronic bronchitis have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Tobacco smoking is the most common cause, with a number of other factors such as air pollution and genetics playing a smaller role. Treatments include quitting smoking, vaccinations, rehabilitation, and often inhaled bronchodilators and steroids. Some people may benefit from long-term oxygen therapy. Acute bronchitis is one of the most common diseases. About 5% of adults are affected and about 6% of children have at least one episode a year. Acute bronchitis is the most common type of bronchitis. In the United States, in 2018, 9.3 million people were diagnosed with chronic bronchitis. Acute bronchitis Bronchitis Acute bronchitis, also known as a chest cold, is short term inflammation of the bronchi of the lungs. The most common symptom is a cough, that may or may not produce sputum. Other symptoms may include coughing up mucus, wheezing, shortness of breath, fever, and chest discomfort. Fever when present is mild. The infection may last from a few to ten days. The cough may persist for several weeks afterwards, with the total duration of symptoms usually around three weeks. Symptoms may last for up to six weeks. =Cause= In more than 90% of cases, the cause is a viral infection. These viruses may spread through the air when people cough or by direct contact. Risk factors include exposure to tobacco smoke, dust, and other air pollutants. A small number of cases are due to bacteria such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae or Bordetella pertussis. =Diagnosis= Diagnosis is typically based on a person's signs and symptoms. The color of the sputum does not indicate if the infection is viral or bacterial. Determining the underlying organism is usually not required. Other causes of similar symptoms include asthma, pneumonia, bronchiolitis, bronchiectasis, and COPD. A chest X-ray may be useful to detect pneumonia. Another common sign of bronchitis is a cough which lasts ten days to three weeks. If the cough lasts for longer than a month, it may become chronic bronchitis. In addition, a fever may be present. Acute bronchitis is normally caused by a viral infection. Typically, these infections are rhinovirus, parainfluenza, or influenza. No specific testing is normally needed in order to diagnose acute bronchitis. = Treatment = One form of prevention is to avoid smoking and other lung irritants. Frequent hand washing may also be protective. Treatment for acute bronchitis usually involves rest, paracetamol (acetaminophen), and NSAIDs to help with the fever. Cough medicine has little support for its use, and is not recommended in children under the age of six. There is tentative evidence that salbutamol may be useful in treating wheezing; however, it may result in nervousness and tremors. Antibiotics should generally not be used. An exception is when acute bronchitis is due to pertussis. Tentative evidence supports honey and pelargonium to help with symptoms. Getting plenty of rest and drinking enough fluids are often recommended as well. Chinese medicinal herbs are of unclear effect. =Epidemiology= Acute bronchitis is one of the most common diseases. About 5% of adults are affected, and about 6% of children have at least one episode a year. It occurs more often in the winter. More than 10 million people in the US visit a doctor each year for this condition, with about 70% receiving antibiotics which are mostly not needed. There are efforts to decrease the use of antibiotics in acute bronchitis. Acute bronchitis is the most common type of bronchitis. Chronic bronchitis Chronic bronchitis is defined as a productive cough that lasts for three months or more per year for at least two years. When this occurs together with decreased airflow it is known as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Many people with chronic bronchitis have COPD however, most people with COPD do not have chronic bronchitis. Estimates of the number of people with COPD who have chronic bronchitis are 7 to 40%. Estimates of the number of people who smoke and have chronic bronchitis who also have COPD is 60%. The term \\"chronic bronchitis\\" was used in previous definitions of COPD but is no longer included in the definition. The term is still used clinically. While both chronic bronchitis and emphysema are often associated with COPD, neither is needed to make the diagnosis. A Chinese consensus commented on symptomatic types of COPD that include chronic bronchitis and with frequent exacerbations. Chronic bronchitis is a respiratory disease marked by overproduction of mucus and mucins. The excess mucus is produced by goblet cells and enlarged submucosal glands in response to long-term irritation. The mucous glands in the submucosa secrete more than the goblet cells. Mucins thicken mucus, and their concentration has been found to be high in cases of chronic bronchitis, and also to correlate with the severity of the disease. Excess mucus can narrow the airways, thereby limiting airflow and accelerating the decline in lung function, and result in COPD. Excess mucus shows itself as a chronic productive cough and its severity and volume of sputum can fluctuate in periods of acute exacerbations. In COPD, those with the chronic bronchitic phenotype with associated chronic excess mucus, experience a worse quality of life than those without. The increased secretions are initially cleared by coughing. The cough is often worse soon after awakening, and the sputum produced may have a yellow or green color and may be streaked with specks of blood. In the early stages, a cough can maintain mucus clearance. However, with continued excessive secretion, mucus clearance is impaired and when the airways become obstructed a cough becomes ineffective. Effective mucociliary clearance depends on airway hydration, ciliary beating, and the rates of mucin secretion. Each of these factors is impaired in chronic bronchitis. Chronic bronchitis can lead to a higher number of exacerbations and a faster decline in lung function. The ICD-11 lists chronic bronchitis with emphysema (emphysematous bronchitis) as a \\"certain specified COPD\\". =Cause= Most cases of chronic bronchitis are caused by tobacco smoking. Chronic bronchitis in young adults who smoke is associated with a greater chance of developing COPD. There is an association between smoking cannabis and chronic bronchitis. In addition, chronic inhalation of air pollution, or irritating fumes or dust from hazardous exposures in occupations such as coal mining, grain handling, textile manufacturing, livestock farming, and metal moulding may also be a risk factor for the development of chronic bronchitis. Bronchitis caused in this way is often referred to as industrial bronchitis, or occupational bronchitis. Rarely genetic factors also play a role. Air quality can also affect the respiratory system with higher levels of nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide contributing to bronchial symptoms. Sulfur dioxide can cause inflammation which can aggravate chronic bronchitis and make infections more likely. Air pollution in the workplace is the cause of several non- communicable diseases (NCDs) including chronic bronchitis. =Treatment= Decline in lung function in chronic bronchitis may be slowed by stopping smoking. Chronic bronchitis may be treated with a number of medications and occasionally oxygen therapy. Pulmonary rehabilitation may also be used. A distinction has been made between exacerbations (sudden worsenings) of chronic bronchitis, and otherwise stable chronic bronchitis. Stable chronic bronchitis can be defined as the normal definition of chronic bronchitis, plus the absence of an acute exacerbation in the previous four weeks. A Cochrane review found that mucolytics in chronic bronchitis may slightly decrease the chance of developing an exacerbation. The mucolytic guaifenesin is a safe and effective treatment for stable chronic bronchitis. This has an advantage in that it is available as an extended use tablet which lasts for twelve hours. Another mucolytic fudosteine may also be used. In those with chronic bronchitis and severe COPD, the phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor roflumilast may decrease significant exacerbations. = Epidemiology = Chronic bronchitis affects about 3.4% to 22% of the general population. Individuals over 45 years of age, smokers, those that live or work in areas with high air pollution, and anybody with asthma all have a higher risk of developing chronic bronchitis. This wide range is due to the different definitions of chronic bronchitis that can be diagnosed based on signs and symptoms or the clinical diagnosis of the disorder. Chronic bronchitis tends to affect men more often than women. While the primary risk factor for chronic bronchitis is smoking, there is still a 4%-22% chance that never smokers can get chronic bronchitis. This might suggest other risk factors such as the inhalation of fuels, dusts, fumes and genetic factor. In the United States, in 2016, 8.6 million people were diagnosed with chronic bronchitis, and there were 518 reported deaths. Per 100,000 of population the death rate of chronic bronchitis was 0.2. History The condition of bronchitis has been recognised for many centuries, in several different cultures including the Ancient Greek, Chinese, and Indian, with the presence of excess phlegm and cough noted in recognition of the same condition. In Britain in 1808, a physician Charles Badham was the first person to describe the condition and name the acute form as acute bronchitis. This was written of in a book entitled Inflammatory conditions of the bronchia. In this book Badham distinguished three forms of bronchitis including acute and chronic. A second edition of this book was renamed An Essay on Bronchitis and published in 1814. Bradham used the term catarrh to refer to the cardinal symptoms of chronic cough and mucus hypersecretion of chronic bronchitis, and described chronic bronchitis as a disabling disorder. In 1901 an article was published on the treatment of chronic bronchitis in the elderly. The symptoms described have remained unchanged. The cause was thought to be brought on by dampness, cold weather, and foggy conditions, and treatments were aimed towards various cough mixtures, respiratory stimulants, and tonics. It was noted that something other than the weather was thought to be at play. Exacerbations of the condition were also described at this time. Another physician Harry Campbell was referred to who had written in the British Medical Journal a week before. Campbell had suggested that the cause of chronic bronchitis was due to toxic substances, and recommended pure air, simple food, and exercise to remove them from the body. A joint research programme was undertaken in Chicago and London from 1951 to 1953 in which the clinical features of one thousand cases of chronic bronchitis were detailed. The findings were published in the Lancet in 1953. It was stated that since its introduction by Badham, chronic bronchitis had become an increasingly popular diagnosis. The study had looked at various associations such as the weather, conditions at home, and at work, age of onset, childhood illnesses, smoking habits, and breathlessness. It was concluded that chronic bronchitis invariably led to emphysema, particularly when the bronchitis had persisted for a long time. In 1957 it was noted that at the time there were many investigations being carried out into chronic bronchitis and emphysema in general, and among industrial workers exposed to dust. Excerpts were published dating from 1864 in which Charles Parsons had noted the occurring consequence of the development of emphysema from bronchitis. This was seen to be not always applicable. His findings were in association with his studies on chronic bronchitis among pottery workers. A CIBA (now Novartis) meeting in 1959, and a meeting of the American Thoracic Society in 1962, defined chronic bronchitis as a component of COPD, in the terms that have not changed. Eosinophilic bronchitis Eosinophilic bronchitis is a chronic dry cough, defined by the presence of an increased number of a type of white blood cell known as eosinophils. It has a normal finding on X-ray and has no airflow limitation. Protracted bacterial bronchitis Protracted bacterial bronchitis in children, is defined as a chronic productive cough with a positive bronchoalveolar lavage that resolves with antibiotics. Protracted bacterial bronchitis is usually caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, non- typable Haemophilus influenzae, or Moraxella catarrhalis. Protracted bacterial bronchitis (lasting more than 4 weeks) in children may be helped by antibiotics. Plastic bronchitis Plastic bronchitis is a rarely found condition in which thickened secretions plug the bronchi. The plugs are rubbery or plastic-feeling (thus the name). The light-colored plugs take the branching shape of the bronchi that they fill, and are known as bronchial casts. When these casts are coughed up, they are firmer in texture from typical phlegm or the short, softer mucus plugs seen in some people with asthma. However, some people with asthma have larger, firmer, more complex plugs. These differ from the casts seen in people whose plastic bronchitis is associated with congenital heart disease or lymphatic vessel abnormalities mainly because eosinophils and Charcot‚ÄìLeyden crystals are present in the asthma-associated casts but not in the others. Casts obstruct the airflow, and can result in the overinflation of the opposite lung. Plastic bronchitis usually occurs in children. Some cases may result from abnormalities in the lymphatic vessels. Advanced cases may show imaging similarities to bronchiectasis. Aspergillus bronchitis Aspergillus bronchitis is one of the Aspergillosis spectrum of diseases, in which the bronchi are specifically subject to a fungal infection. This differs from the other pulmonary aspergillosis conditions, in that it need not affect just the immunocompromised.

Wandregisel was part of a group of young courtiers Audoin and Didier of Cahors who served Dagobert I, but in 629 he retired from court to become a monk at Montfaucon under the guidance of Saint Balderic. Wandregisel had received the tonsure without the permission normally required for a courtier, and was summoned to court to explain this apparent oversight. Dagobert then approve his request.Kreiner, Jamie. The Social Life of Hagiography in the Merovingian Kingdom, Cambridge University Press, 2014, , p. 67 Wandregisel soon withdrew to live as a hermit in complete solitude at Saint-Ursanne in the Jura. Wandregisel adhered to the principles of Columbanus and his disciple Saint Ursicinus, both of whom had founded several monasteries in the region. In 635 Wandregisel spent some time at the monastery of Saint Columban at Bobbio in northern Italy. From there, he wished to travel to Ireland, but by 642 got only as far as the abbey of Romainm√¥tier,Fox, Yaniv.

Early life Grima was born in Rome to Italian-Maltese parents and raised in London, where he attended Salesian College, Battersea and St Joseph's College, Upper Norwood. He later studied mechanical engineering at the University of Nottingham. The family was artistic and creative: his father was an embroidery designer and Grima's brothers became architects, helping design his London showroom in 1966. Grima joined the Royal Engineers, serving in Burma in World War II with the 7th Indian Division of the British Army. Jeweller After the war, he started work in his father-in-law's jewellery firm in London, Haller Jewellery Company Limited (H.J. Co) initially in the accounts department, before moving into design. He became the foremost modern jewellery designer in the West End of London in the 1960s and 1970s, selling designs from his exclusive gallery at 80 Jermyn Street, Mayfair featuring the world's first perspex spiral staircase (1970) built by Peter Rice and Ove Arup. In 1970 he designed the successful \\"About Time\\" watch collection for Omega and in 1976 a collection of gold digital LED watches for Pulsar Grima won several awards for his contribution to the jewellery industry. Namely, he was the only jeweller to win the Duke of Edinburgh Prize for Elegant Design and won 13 De Beers Diamonds International Awards; more than any other jeweller. His clients included members of the British Royal family, as well as Barbara Hepworth and Jacqueline Onassis. Notable pieces include Queen Elizabeth II's ruby brooch, as well as a brooch of lichen cast in gold for Princess Margaret. More recently, fans of his work have included fashion designers Miuccia Prada and Marc Jacobs. Examples of Grima's work are held in the Victoria & Albert Museum and in the collection of the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths. On 20 September 2017 Bonhams auctioned the largest private Grima collection to ever be sold at auction. Personal life Grima married twice, firstly in 1947 to Hel√®ne Haller, niece of the Viennese jeweller who brought Grima into the trade. The couple had a son and two daughters; they divorced in 1977. The same year, Grima married Jojo Maughan-Brown, great-granddaughter of Sir Thomas Cullinan. They had one daughter, Francesca, who ‚Äì together with her mother ‚Äì continues the family business. In 1986 the Grimas moved to Switzerland, first to Lugano and in 1992 to Gstaad, where Grima died on 26 December 2007. Francesca and Jojo moved back to London in 2012. They have continued the family business by creating unique and bespoke pieces handmade in Britain by Andrew's master craftsmen.

Article I bans Cyprus from participating in any political union or economic union with any other state. Article II requires the other parties to guarantee the independence, territorial integrity and security of Cyprus. Article IV reserves the right of the guarantor powers to take action to re-establish the current state of affairs in Cyprus, a provision that was used as justification for the Turkish invasion of 1974. The treaty also allowed the United Kingdom to retain sovereignty over two military bases.Timeline: Cyprus, BBC News Article IV entitled these three guarantor powers to multilateral action among them or, as a last resort if no concerted action seemed possible, each guarantor to unilateral actions confined to restoring its status according to the treaty as a democratic, bicommunal, single, sovereign independent state: Initially, a bicommunal independent state was at stake because of the July 1974 coup and several Turkish Cypriot enclaves being attacked at the onset of the coup. Those circumstances made Turkey claim the right to unilateral action, as provided by the treaty, by first invading and creating a bridgehead and corridor between Kyrenia and Nicosia enclave. In the second invasion campaign, Turkish forces invaded and held on to one third of the island, resulting in effective partition of the island and secession of the parts of the island under its military control. Hence, the second invasion is regarded as a violation of the treaty.

Allegories can be used as an abstraction of categories of relations, and in this sense the theory of allegories is a generalization of relation algebra to relations between different sorts. Allegories are also useful in defining and investigating certain constructions in category theory, such as exact completions. In this article we adopt the convention that morphisms compose from right to left, so means \\"first do , then do \\". Definition An allegory is a category in which * every morphism R\\\\colon X\\\\to Y is associated with an anti-involution, i.e. a morphism R^\\\\circ\\\\colon Y\\\\to X with R^{\\\\circ\\\\circ} = R and (RS)^\\\\circ = S^\\\\circ R^\\\\circ\\\\text{;} and * every pair of morphisms R,S \\\\colon X\\\\to Y with common domain/codomain is associated with an intersection, i.e. a morphism R \\\\cap S\\\\colon X\\\\to Y all such that * intersections are idempotent: R\\\\cap R = R, commutative: R\\\\cap S = S\\\\cap R, and associative: (R\\\\cap S)\\\\cap T = R\\\\cap (S\\\\cap T); * anti-involution distributes over intersection: (R\\\\cap S)^\\\\circ = S^\\\\circ \\\\cap R^\\\\circ; * composition is semi-distributive over intersection: R(S\\\\cap T) \\\\subseteq RS\\\\cap RT and (R\\\\cap S)T \\\\subseteq RT\\\\cap ST; and * the modularity law is satisfied: RS \\\\cap T \\\\subseteq (R\\\\cap TS^\\\\circ)S. Here, we are abbreviating using the order defined by the intersection: R \\\\subseteq S means R = R\\\\cap S. A first example of an allegory is the category of sets and relations. The objects of this allegory are sets, and a morphism X \\\\to Y is a binary relation between and . Composition of morphisms is composition of relations, and the anti-involution of R is the converse relation R^\\\\circ: y R^\\\\circ x if and only if xRy. Intersection of morphisms is (set-theoretic) intersection of relations. Regular categories and allegories =Allegories of relations in regular categories= In a category , a relation between objects and is a span of morphisms X\\\\gets R\\\\to Y that is jointly monic. Two such spans X\\\\gets S\\\\to Y and X\\\\gets T\\\\to Y are considered equivalent when there is an isomorphism between and that make everything commute; strictly speaking, relations are only defined up to equivalence (one may formalise this either by using equivalence classes or by using bicategories). If the category has products, a relation between and is the same thing as a monomorphism into (or an equivalence class of such). In the presence of pullbacks and a proper factorization system, one can define the composition of relations. The composition X\\\\gets R\\\\to Y\\\\gets S\\\\to Z is found by first pulling back the cospan R\\\\to Y\\\\gets S and then taking the jointly-monic image of the resulting span X\\\\gets R\\\\gets\\\\bullet\\\\to S\\\\to Z. Composition of relations will be associative if the factorization system is appropriately stable. In this case, one can consider a category , with the same objects as , but where morphisms are relations between the objects. The identity relations are the diagonals X \\\\to X\\\\times X. A regular category (a category with finite limits and images in which covers are stable under pullback) has a stable regular epi/mono factorization system. The category of relations for a regular category is always an allegory. Anti-involution is defined by turning the source/target of the relation around, and intersections are intersections of subobjects, computed by pullback. =Maps in allegories, and tabulations= A morphism in an allegory is called a map if it is entire (1\\\\subseteq R^\\\\circ R) and deterministic (RR^\\\\circ \\\\subseteq 1). Another way of saying this is that a map is a morphism that has a right adjoint in when is considered, using the local order structure, as a 2-category. Maps in an allegory are closed under identity and composition. Thus, there is a subcategory of with the same objects but only the maps as morphisms. For a regular category , there is an isomorphism of categories C \\\\cong \\\\operatorname{Map}(\\\\operatorname{Rel}(C)). In particular, a morphism in is just an ordinary set function. In an allegory, a morphism R\\\\colon X\\\\to Y is tabulated by a pair of maps f\\\\colon Z\\\\to X and g\\\\colon Z\\\\to Y if gf^\\\\circ = R and f^\\\\circ f \\\\cap g^\\\\circ g = 1. An allegory is called tabular if every morphism has a tabulation. For a regular category , the allegory is always tabular. On the other hand, for any tabular allegory , the category of maps is a locally regular category: it has pullbacks, equalizers, and images that are stable under pullback. This is enough to study relations in , and in this setting, A\\\\cong \\\\operatorname{Rel}(\\\\operatorname{Map}(A)). =Unital allegories and regular categories of maps= A unit in an allegory is an object for which the identity is the largest morphism U\\\\to U, and such that from every other object, there is an entire relation to . An allegory with a unit is called unital. Given a tabular allegory , the category is a regular category (it has a terminal object) if and only if is unital. =More sophisticated kinds of allegory= Additional properties of allegories can be axiomatized. Distributive allegories have a union-like operation that is suitably well- behaved, and division allegories have a generalization of the division operation of relation algebra. Power allegories are distributive division allegories with additional powerset-like structure. The connection between allegories and regular categories can be developed into a connection between power allegories and toposes.

He also helped to found and build Connecticut's Mohegan Sun Casino. He held the title of \\"chief for life.\\" The Mohegan tribe, which is based in Montville, Connecticut, is currently made up of approximately 1,700 people. The Mohegan's reservation is located in eastern Connecticut along the Thames River near the town of Uncasville. The Mohegans are one of the wealthiest tribes in the United States, thanks to income from casinos and other facilities, whose construction was spearheaded by Sturges. Personal life Sturges was born December 25, 1918, in New London, Connecticut. He traced his Mohegan ancestry to his maternal great-grandmother, Emma Baker, a Mohegan medicine woman and early 1900s Native American activist who campaigned for the state to settle Mohegan land grievances. He served in the U.S. military in an intelligence division in New Guinea and the Philippines. He was awarded a Bronze Star for his service in the war. Sturges worked in a number of professions before becoming active in Mohegan tribal affairs late in life. He worked as a disaster relief coordinator for the Salvation Army and a payroll deliveryman for an armored car company, among other jobs. He was a skilled and active marble sculptor. His works were placed on display at the Connecticut State Capitol and other public buildings. Connecticut Governor M. Jodi Rell issued a statement following Sturges' death in 2007 saying, \\"He will be forever remembered for his contributions not only as a wise leader ... but as a skilled sculptor.\\" References External links *The Hartford Courant: Mohegan Chief Dies *The Hartford Courant: Longtime Mohegan Leader Dies At 88 *New York Times: Ralph Sturges, Chief of Mohegan Tribe, Dies at 88 Category:1918 births Category:2007 deaths Category:Native American leaders Category:Native American activists Category:American military personnel of World War II Category:Native American United States military personnel Category:Native American sculptors Category:Sculptors from Connecticut Category:People from New London, Connecticut Category:20th-century American sculptors Category:American male sculptors ","title":"Ralph W.

Biography C√¢rja was born in Whitman, Logan County, West Virginia, where his parents (Iov and Judifca) had emigrated to from Austro-Hungarian-ruled Transylvania around 1910. He and his family returned to Romania in February 1927 and settled down in Mihai Viteazu, near the city of Cluj, where they bought a farm. While in high school, C√¢rja started work on a magazine titled Gazeta de Turda, and published his first book -- Cremene √Æn apa vremii (\\"A Flintstone in the Water of Life\\"). Beginning in 1942, he studied Law and Philology at the University of Cluj (he also enlisted for Medicine studies, but abandoned them after one year). In 1948 he received his PhD in Law from the same university. He was elected general secretary of the Transylvanian Writers' Union. At the same time, C√¢rja took part in the resistance movement against the newly established Communist regime, and was involved in supporting the anti-communist groups in the Apuseni Mountains. Because of this and due to the political content of his writings, he spent 15 years in prison between 1949 and 1964 (in Cluj, Gherla, Aiud, and building the Danube-Black Sea Canal). He was ultimately released by a general amnesty. In parallel, his elder brother, Nicolae C√¢rja, was captured by the Soviet Red Army, and exiled for nine years in the Russian Far East. Having both American and Romanian citizenship, Ion C√¢rja made several requests to the Romanian authorities to be allowed to leave for the United States. Pressure by the United States Department of State ultimately brought about his departure in May 1965. He settled down in New York City, where he worked for the city's Department of Social Welfare. In order to receive more qualifications in this area, he undertook studies at Fordham University. Columbia University later recognized his Romanian PhD. In 1970 he initiated the Romanian National Council, whose journal, called Ac»õiunea Rom√¢neascƒÉ, was first published in 1971. He was elected secretary general of the council.

Bildts farmhouses are of a characteristic right-angled type. This means that the house has been placed on a right angle with the barn. The reason for this is unknown, but it has been suggested that they were constructed this way so as to have a more logical location in relation to the farmlands and the dike- road. In a time of prosperity it also gave farmers the opportunity to show off their wealth. Unlike the more common Head-Neck-Body farmhouses, the cattle heads pointed to the inside of the barn (instead of to the wall). This type of space distribution is also found in farmhouses in Zeeland and South Holland. It is likely that the landworkers and farmers that originated from these Dutch provinces brought this type of distribution with them. A remarkable fact is that there did not exist sheds in Friesland before the year 1500. It is therefore most likely that these farmhouses (mainly the sheds) originated on Het Bildt and spread from here on into Friesland, Groningen (mainly in the western part) and North Holland(mainly in the northern part).

He was a key designer of the Beijing National Aquatics Centre that was built for the 2008 Summer Olympics. Educated in Germany and Switzerland, he worked with several high-profile European architects before moving to Sydney. For many years Bosse has based his work on the computational study of organic structures and resulting spatial conceptions. His research lies in the exploration of unusual structures pushing the boundaries of the traditional understanding of structure and architecture with digital and experimental formfinding. Chris Bosse's master's degree dealt with the implementation of virtual environments into architecture. The potential for naturally evolving systems such as snowflakes, spider webs and soap bubbles for new building typologies and structures informs Bosse‚Äôs work ‚Äì the geometries in nature create both efficiency and beauty. But above all the human is the centre of his investigations. Whilst Associate Architect with PTW, Bosse was a key designer of the Watercube for Beijing Olympics [winner of Atmosphere Award, 9th Venice Architecture Biennale] and was recognized in the 2007 AR Awards for Emerging Architecture, RIBA London. He co-founded Laboratory for Visionary Architecture (LAVA) with Tobias Wallisser and Alexander Rieck in 2007. LAVA has offices in Sydney, Stuttgart and Abu Dhabi Bosse works as an Adjunct Professor and Research Innovation fellow at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS) in Australia. LAVA combines digital workflow, local solutions and the latest digital fabrication technologies with the aim of achieving more with less: more (architecture) with less (material/ energy/time/cost). On October 7, 2008 at Dubai cityscape, Formula 1 driver Michael Schumacher and LAVA presented the design for The Michael Schumacher World Champion Tower (MSWCT), the first in a series of seven towers to be built worldwide. \\"The Tower marks a departure from traditional architectural thinking\\", state the architects Chris Bosse and Tobias Wallisser. ‚ÄúInspired by the geometrical order of a snowflake and the aerodynamics of a Formula 1 racing car, the tower encapsulates speed, fluid dynamics, future technology and natural patterns of organization‚Äù. LAVA architects won the bid to design the city center for the sustainable eco-city Masdar in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in 2010. LAVA imagined an outdoor city-center based on traditional European public plazas that would encourage social interaction. However, Masdar‚Äôs arid climate leaves outdoor spaces subject to the blistering heat of the desert. To ameliorate this problem and create a comfortable place to gather and shop, the architects incorporated adaptive building technologies, and efficient use of energy and water ‚Äî creating a rather dazzling sustainable city center. The project for the city centre includes a plaza, hotel, convention centre, entertainment and retail facilities. Masdar centre won the Special Award - Environmental Category in the 2009 Cityscape Dubai Awards. LAVA‚Äôs Digital Origami Tigers are currently traveling the world as part of the WWF year of the tiger campaign. ‚ÄòTower Skin‚Äô, a Zeroprize winning speculative proposal for the UTS building in Sydney, re-purposes an inefficient and outdated building. A simple, cost effective and easily constructed building skin transforms the identity, sustainability and interior comfort of an existing structure.

Animal welfare in Southern Rhodesia was initiated over 80 years ago, some 100 years after the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals was launched in the United Kingdom in 1824. This followed the first anti- cruelty bill which was introduced by Richard Martin MP which provided protection for cattle, horses and sheep. The first prosecutions date back to 1832 when 181 convictions were recorded. In 1840 the Society's work was held in such high regard by Queen Victoria that she granted her permission for the SPCA to be entitled the Royal Society for the Preventions of Cruelty to Animals. At that time, only a single Inspector had been appointed in London. By 1842 several requests had been received from other areas for the appointment of additional Inspectors. The first SPCA Centre to be officially registered as a Welfare Organisation in Rhodesia was Bulawayo in 1967, followed by Kwekwe, Salisbury and Masvingo in the same year, Mutare in 1968 and Gweru in 1969. The smaller centres followed suit in the early 1970s. The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals was established in 1969 by Messrs Barrow, Hearsh, Morris, Brierley, Bott, Sobey and Howell, who represented the eight SPCA Centres providing services to animals in Zimbabwe at that time. Over 30 years later, founder member Mr G B Howell, who retired as Chairman of the Mutare SPCA in 2002, is still an active and most respected member of the Society. There are currently 15 active SPCA centers or divisions of ZNSPCA throughout Zimbabwe, with the recent important addition of Beitbridge. In 2000, the National Executive Council, which represents all SPCA centers, appointed a National Co-ordinator, Chief Inspector Meryl Harrison to provide liaison between the centers, advise members on correct policy and procedure and most importantly, to provide training to Inspectors for appointment by the Minister of Tourism and the Environment, empowered to enforce the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, the primary objective of the Society. With only 10 Inspectors currently employed throughout Zimbabwe, the training of Inspectors remains the Chief Inspector's priority. Four trainees who recently completed their training and passed the Inspector's examination with excellent results are awaiting accreditation by the Minister. Three further trainees are currently undergoing their practical training. The ZNSPCA is always on the look-out for suitable individuals with the necessary level of dedication and commitment to animal welfare. As the only organisation authorised to rescue the thousands of animals abandoned or affected by ongoing land reforms, the brave and determined Inspectors of ZNSPCA have been a credit to the Society and have received international commendations and awards for their bravery. Apart from the rescue work which currently takes up most of the National team's time, Chief Inspector Harrison still manages to find time to deal with the myriad other animal welfare concerns of the Society, such as live animal transportation, intensive farming, wildlife in captivity, improving the conditions of laboratory animals, the introduction of codes of practice for livestock producers, export and translocation of wild animals and ensuring the humane treatment of regulated problem animals. She routinely consults with all the stake-holders connected with these activities and has established the Animal Welfare Forum, a tri-partite group comprising the Chief Inspector of the ZNSPCA, Chief Government Veterinarian and Chairman of the Veterinary Council of Zimbabwe. Through the work of the Inspectorate, the Society in Zimbabwe is no longer perceived as an organisation merely concerned with the welfare of 'cats and dogs', but an organisation committed to the prevention of cruelty to animals in all of its manifestations. As there are not many records available relating to the history of the Society in Zimbabwe, we would appreciate any information, files, newspaper cuttings or correspondence from former Chairmen and Inspectors in order to provide a more detailed and interesting history of the Society. In recent years, a number of high-profile journalists such as South African Jani Allan have published columns on animal cruelty in Zimbabwe.

He was a half-brother of Louis FitzGibbon, author of a number of works about the Katyn massacre of Polish officers in 1940, by Soviet troops. His father, Commander Francis Lee-Dillon FitzGibbon, RN, was Irish, and his mother, Georgette Folsom, was an American from Lenox, Massachusetts.Elizabeth Devine, Annual Obituary 1983.St. James Press, 1984; (pp. 155-56). The family were descended from John \\"Black Jack\\" FitzGibbon, the 1st Earl of Clare,John FitzGibbon, Earl of Clare: Protestant Reaction and English Authority in Late Eighteenth-century Ireland, Ann C. Kavanaugh, Irish Academic Press, 1997, p. 6 who was Lord Chancellor of Ireland and effected the Act of Union between Ireland and England in 1800, but in the following century the family faded into obscurity and the title died out. He was brought up in the United States and France before moving to England with his mother, his parents having divorced when he was very young. His first brief marriage was to Margaret Aye Moung, but during World War II he met Theodora Rosling, to whom he was married until 1960. They lived at Sacombs Ash, Hertfordshire, from 1951‚Äì59, but had no children. Theodora wrote of their time together in her (partly fictional) memoirs With Love (1982), and Love Lies a Loss (1985). Their lives were Bohemian. The union ended in divorce.Burke's Peerage 2003, vol. 1, p. 1150 He then married Marion Gutmann in 1960, with whom he had a son, Francis, born in 1961. Their marriage ended in 1965, and he moved to Ireland and married Marjorie Steele, a retired American actress, in 1967. They had a daughter, Oonagh (born 1968), for whom he wrote Teddy in the Tree (1977). He also adopted Marjorie's son, Peter FitzGibbon, from her former marriage. After a short spell in west Cork, the family lived in Killiney, County Dublin, and then in the city. Education FitzGibbon was educated at Wellington College, Berkshire, a British public (i.e. private) school with military affiliations, which he detested. He left aged 16 and travelled independently in Europe, where he studied at the University of Munich and University of Paris, becoming fluent in French and German and acquiring a sound knowledge of their literatures. He won a scholarship to Exeter College, Oxford to read modern languages in 1937, but left in May 1940, after the fall of France, to join the army. He did not complete his degree before the war and chose not to return to Oxford afterwards. One of his best novels, The Golden Age (1976), set in a post-apocalyptic future Oxford, is by turns wistful and sardonic about the University. Career FitzGibbon served as an officer in the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry (the 'Ox & Bucks') regiment of the British Army, from 1940 to 1942. As a US citizen he transferred to the United States Army in 1942, when the United States entered the war, rising to the rank of Major by 1945. His work was in intelligence, and he served as a staff officer to General Omar H Bradley in the D-Day campaign and thereafter. On being discharged in 1946, FitzGibbon was offered, but refused, a job with the successor to the Office of Strategic Services(OSS), a predecessor of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Instead, he worked briefly as a schoolmaster at Saltus Grammar School in Bermuda from 1946‚Äì47,Constantine Fitzgibbon, Red Hand: the Ulster Colony, Michael Joseph Ltd (1971) ; flyleaf biography before becoming a full-time independent writer. He lived in Italy for a time, where he tried and failed to write a biography of Norman Douglas, a distant kinsman. Between 1950 and 1965 he was resident in England. FitzGibbon wrote over 30 books, including nine novels, and translated numerous works from German and French. One of his closest friends was the writer Manes Sperber, many of whose books he translated from French and whose views about the dangers of both left-wing and right-wing tyranny were highly influential on him. Politically, FitzGibbon identified himself as a strong anti-Communist, having been drawn to communism as a young man. His credo, however, was that no political group that resorted to locking its opponents up in camps was any good. He refused to travel to Spain while Franco was alive. During the Troubles in Northern Ireland, he supported civil rights for Catholics but condemned the use of violence by all sides. His 1960 novel, When the Kissing Had to Stop caused controversy because of its explicit anti-CND theme; the book depicts the Soviet domination of Britain under a left-wing government which has removed its nuclear weapons. An ITV adaptation of When the Kissing Had to Stop caused even more controversy, and one writer called FitzGibbon a \\"fascist Hyena\\". This amused him greatly, and he responded by publishing a collection of essays called Random Thoughts of a Fascist Hyena (1963). He wrote prolifically, in fiction, historical works, memoirs, poetry and biography. He made programmes for BBC radio, including documentaries about British fascism, the Blitz and the 1930s hunger marches. He was a regular contributor to newspapers in the UK and Ireland, and for many years wrote for Encounter (magazine). His one stage venture, The Devil at Work (produced by the Abbey Theatre, Dublin in 1971) met with little success. FitzGibbon was a member of the Council of the Irish Academy of Letters and an honorary fellow of the Royal Society of Literature and a Guggenheim Fellow. He later became an Irish citizen and lived in County Dublin.

Initially deployed aboard ships as the B-34 during the Second World War, a ground- mounted version was introduced into service after the war as the KS-19. The KS-19 is a heavy towed anti aircraft gun that has largely disappeared from front line arsenals due to increased use of more effective surface-to-air missiles. Being a towed weapon an external form of mobility was required, usually an AT-S Medium or AT-T Heavy tracked artillery tractor. The 15 man crew were carried on the tractor along with ready use ammunition for the gun.Bishop C and Drury I. The Encyclopedia of World Military Power (1988). Temple Press/Aerospace publishing. Ammunition was loaded as a single round into the loading tray and a well trained crew could fire 15 rounds maximum per minute. KS-19, Israel Defense Forces History Museum. Anti Aircraft ammunition includes high explosive, high explosive fragmentation and fragmentation types. The KS-19's onboard sights can be used to engage air targets; however increased accuracy was achieved if used in conjunction with a fire control radar such as the SON 9 (NATO Reporting name 'Fire Can') and PUAZO-6/19 director. As the KS-19 is a heavy calibre Anti-Aircraft gun it also has some utility in the ground role especially against armored targets. As a result of this two armor piecing rounds were produced: the AP-T (Armour Piercing-Tracer) and APC-T (Armour Piercing Capped-Tracer) with the AP-T round reportedly able to penetrate 185 mm of armor at 1000 m.

Hand-made ryijy, 1936 Ryijy is a woven Finnish long-tufted tapestry or knotted-pile carpet hanging. The name ryijy originated with the Scandinavian word rya, which means \\"thick cloth\\". The decorative ryijy rug is an art form unique to Finland. In the late 19th century, ryijy rug weaving developed as a folk art. Some of the most beautiful tapestries were woven then. Ryijys date from as early as the 9th century. Similar in nature to a woolen knotted Persian carpet, the ryijy knots are further apart and made much larger and longer. Originally woven for use as coverlets and bedding, they were mainly in natural colors, white, gray, and black. Some tones of yellow, red, green, and blue were introduced with vegetable dyes. Later, aniline dyes added another dimension of color and design. The use of color and pattern is especially unique to the Finnish ryijy. Dating back to the 18th century, a ryijy was often used as a prayer rug during wedding ceremonies; the tapestry was then hung for display in the couple's home. Ryijy weavers traveled with their looms throughout the villages and towns getting commissions to weave a ryijy for special occasions. Different regions had designs specific to the event and colors specific to the local plants for dyes. Designs were often geometric shapes and florals, or figures of humans, animals, or birds. A very typical motif was the Tree of Life signifying family heritage. Modern ryijys in the 20th century are often works of art designed by textile artists such as Laila Karttunen and Kirsti Ilvessalo. But also painters such as Akseli Gallen-Kallela designed ryijys, one of the most famous is Liekki ('Flame').Gallen-Kallela Museum Site They are mainly used in homes but also in churches and other public places. Ryijys are available for purchase as both material sets and ready-made. Companies have both traditional and modern designs available. A traditional large size piece costs about 500-700 EUR for the materials and 4000-5000 EUR if ready- made. Second-hand ryijys are also available, often from art and antique auction houses. The popularity of ryijys fluctuates with decades, and trendiness dictates the prices of pre-antique and second-hand modern items. Antique ryijy prices are more stable. Today ryijy-making techniques include new fibers such as paper cord, available in hundreds of colors, as is the traditional wool. They are designed for a multitude of places and purposes, but each is an individual work of art. Modern designs are often dithered with naturalistic abstract designs, contrasting with the sharp geometry and clearly separated colours of traditional designs .

She is the chairman emeritus (and former president and Chief Executive Officer) of People to People International. She is a granddaughter of General Dwight D. Eisenhower, 34th President of the United States. Early life Mary Eisenhower was born in Washington, D.C., during her grandfather's first term and christened in the Blue Room of the White House. She grew up on Eisenhower estate in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, where General Eisenhower retired after leaving office. Ms. Eisenhower attended Schuylkill Consolidated School in fifth grade and Westtown School in Pennsylvania until her father, John Eisenhower, was appointed United States Ambassador to Belgium. She lived in Belgium from 1969 to 1972. Eisenhower began her career working on Capitol Hill and then managed an engineering firm. She also has served as a Fellow at Stanford University. In 1973, Mary Jean Eisenhower was presented as a debutante to high society at the prestigious International Debutante Ball at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City.

During her work with People to People International, Eisenhower visited Morocco to represent her family to the King on the 50th anniversary of the Casablanca Conference. She also traveled to the beaches of Normandy to meet many of the veterans who served with her grandfather on the D-Day invasion. In the last six years, Eisenhower has left United States soil over 70 times and visited over 40 countries.

Inspired by an orphanage she visited in Morocco, Eisenhower launched the People to People International Friendship Fund in 1999. The Fund is designed to enable individuals to support the service-oriented facilities they visit throughout the world and to provide a mechanism through which the network of PTPI Chapters can assist one another. Today, the fund has supported causes ranging from the Global Humanitarian Eradication of Landmines, Children's Mercy Hospital in London, England, United Kingdom, earthquake relief in India, disaster relief to victims of September 11 attacks, and their families, support of under resourced schools in China and Sri Lanka, a home for leukemia victims and their families in Cuba, to a library project in Vietnam and the Friends of Egypt organization. One hundred percent of all funds received by the International Friendship Fund are allocated in support of the projects specified by donors. After the September 11 attacks, Eisenhower became intently focused upon bringing young people from around the globe into contact with one another in order to expose them to diverse cultures and conflict management tools that might facilitate the amelioration of long-standing disputes. Her vision came to fruition with Peace Camp 2003: An Evolution of Thought and Change and the Global Peace Initiative. Both the Peace Camp and the Global Peace Initiative brought participants from over 30 nationalities together in Egypt to discuss contemporary issues and gain nuanced insights into the varied and unique cultures represented among the participants.

This included the establishment of educational institutions, like the Gurukul Kangri University, and played a key role on the Sangathan (consolidation and organization) and the Shuddhi (re-conversion), a Hindu reform movement in the 1920s. Early life and education He was born on 22 February 1856 in the village of Talwan in the Jalandhar District of the Punjab Province of India. He was the youngest child in the family of Lala Nanak Chand, who was a Police Inspector in the United Provinces (now Uttar Pradesh), then administered by the East India Company. His given name was Brihaspati Vij, but later he was called Munshi Ram Vij by his father, a name that stayed with him till he took sanyas in 1917, variously as Lala Munshi Ram Vij and Mahatma Munshi Ram. He adopted atheism after a few incidents, such as when he was prevented from entering the temple while a noble woman was praying. He also was witness to a \\"compromising\\" situation involving a church's father with a nun,Autobiography http://www.vedpedia.com the attempted rape of a young devotee by pontiffs of the Krishna cult, and the suspicious death of a little girl at the home of a Muslim lawyer. All of these events cemented his atheism. He eventually passed mukhtari exams and began studying to become a lawyer. =Meeting Dayanand= He first met Dayanand Saraswati when Dayanand visited Bareilly to give lectures. His father was handling arrangements and security at the events, due to the attendance of some prominent personalities and British officers. Munshiram attend the lectures at his father's request. He originally went with the intent of spoiling the arrangements, then claimed to be strongly influenced by Dayanand's courage, skill, and strong personality. After completing his studies Munshiram started his practice as lawyer. Career Mahatma Munshi Ram or Swami Shraddhanand in early days =Schools= In 1892 Arya Samaj was split into two factions after a controversy over whether to make Vedic education the core curriculum at the DAV College Lahore. He left the organization and formed the Punjab Arya Samaj. The Arya Samaj was divided between the Gurukul Section and the DAV Section. Shraddhanand headed for Gurukuls. In 1897, when Lala Lekh Ram was assassinated, Shraddhanand succeeded him. He headed the 'Punjab Arya Pratinidhi Sabha', and started its monthly journal, Arya Musafir. In 1902 he established a Gurukul in Kangri, India near Haridwar. This school is now recognized as Gurukul Kangri University. In 1917, Mahatma Munshi Ram took sanyas as \\"Swami Shradhanand Saraswati\\". Shraddhanand established gurukul Indraprashtha in Aravali near Faridabad, Haryana. =Activism= In 1917, Shraddhanand left Gurukul to become an active member of the Hindu reform movements and the Indian Independence movement.G.S.

He began working with the Congress, which he invited to hold its session at Amritsar in 1919. This was because of the Jalianwala massacre, and no one in the Congress Committee agreed to have a session at Amritsar. Shraddhanand presided over the session. He also joined the nationwide protest against the Rowlatt Act. The same year he protested in front of a posse of Gurkha soldiers at the Clock Tower in Chandni Chowk, then was allowed to proceed. In the early 1920s he emerged as an important force in the Hindu Sangathan (consolidation) movement, which was a by product of the now revitalised Hindu Maha Sabha.Chetan Bhatt (2001). Shraddhanand Hindu Nationalism: Origins, Ideologies and Modern Myths Berg Publishers. . p. 62 He wrote on religious issues in both Hindi and Urdu. He published newspapers in the two languages as well. He promoted Hindi in the Devanagri script, helped the poor and promoted the education of women. By 1923, he left the social arena and plunged whole-heartedly into his earlier work of the shuddhi movement (re-conversion to Hinduism), which he turned into an important force within Hinduism.R. K. Ghai. (1990) Shuddhi Movement in India: A Study of Its Socio-political Dimensions, Commonwealth Publishers. , p. 43. In 1922,Dr Ambedkar called Shraddhanand ‚Äúthe greatest and most sincere champion of the Untouchables‚Äù. In late 1923, he became the president of Bhartiya Hindu Shuddhi Sabha, created with an aim of reconverting Muslims, specifically 'Malkana Rajputs' in the western United Province. This brought him into direct confrontation with Muslim clerics and leaders of the time.G. R. Thursby (1975).

While he continues to address fundamental questions, he is researching new venues of diagnosis and therapy of cancer dissemination.  Biography  Georg F. Weber was educated in Erlangen, Germany. He then attended medical school at the University of W√ºrzburg, Germany. In 1988, he graduated and also completed his doctoral thesis. Early in his intellectual life (1981‚Äì1991), Weber wrote publications on chess and biomechanics. His medical career was initially focused on immunology, in particular on the regulation of host defenses through redox mechanisms. Among various phenomena, he identified signal transduction pathways inside T-lymphocytes that determine cell proliferation, programmed cell death, or immunosenescence. At the turn of the year 1988/1989, Weber migrated to the United States. He worked at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School from 1990 to 1999. After a stint at Tufts University, he moved to the University of Cincinnati, where he is currently on the faculty at the College of Pharmacy and the Cancer Center. Georg F. Weber has defined the genetic basis of metastasis formation as aberrant expression or splicing of a unique set of developmentally non-essential genes (stress response genes) that physiologically mediate the homing of immune system cells. Specifically, his laboratory has studied the cytokine osteopontin, which acts as a metastasis gene in multiple malignancies, including breast cancer. Based on the molecular mechanisms of osteopontin induction and function in cancer metastasis, he has established the following paradigms: 1\\\\. Osteopontin and variant CD44 interact, and this is essential for metastasis by several types of cancer. 2\\\\. Multiple osteopontin splice variants are present in malignant, but not in benign human breast tumor cells. 3\\\\. Metastasis genes support anchorage-independence in an autocrine fashion. 4\\\\. In cancer cells, distinct signal transduction pathways to growth and invasiveness are activated by oncogenes. 5\\\\. The expression (activation) of metastasis genes is triggered by cellular stress response programs and is regulated by multi-subunit transcription factor complexes. Georg F. Weber is the author of multiple monographs, most recently textbooks on molecular oncology.

As with medical adjuvants, agricultural spray adjuvants are not themselves active in controlling or killing pests. Instead, these additives modify some property of the spray solution, which improves the ability of the pesticide to penetrate, target or protect the target organism. Among the typical types of ingredients used are surfactants, emulsifiers, oils and salts. Each of these ingredients, and others, modifies the spray solution itself to improve such properties as spreading, penetration, droplet size or other characteristics. These additives may be included in a formulation with a pesticide or may be added separately to a tank. When they are included in the pesticide formulations themselves, they are called in-can adjuvants. Agricultural spray adjuvants may also be added separately when the spray solution is being prepared. In this case, the adjuvant is called a tank mix adjuvant. When delivered in-can, adjuvants may be quite effective. However, because of the limited space or limited compatibility in a pesticide formulation, not all necessary adjuvants may be included in-can. Thus, the addition of tank mix adjuvants may be necessary to optimize performance of the pesticide. Agricultural spray adjuvants do not reduce the amount of pesticide needed below the recommended use rate on a pesticide label. In fact, it is illegal to use a pesticide in the US outside of the instructions on the label, although FIFRA, the US law governing pesticide use, does allow for the use of pesticides at rates below the label, as long as the label does not specifically deny such use. Agricultural spray adjuvants are used to enhance the performance of the legal amount of a pesticide that may be used. These adjuvants give more consistent performance and may make up for under- performance under certain conditions.  Adjuvant Related Regulations  In the United States, agricultural tank adjuvants are essentially unregulated except in a few isolated cases. The states of Washington and California require that adjuvants be registered before they can be sold. Other states may or may not regulate adjuvants at some level. There is no federal regulation of tank mix adjuvants. However, the industry itself has several efforts underway in order to self regulate the products. The ASTM International (ASTM) E35.22 committee is the committee that defines agricultural tank mix claims for the industry. The standard E1519 defines the various claims that an adjuvant may make and reference the methods by which the claim may be proven. The methods are tests, which when applied to a given sample, prove that the material meets the claimed standard. Supporting the activities of ASTM is the Council of Producers & Distributors of Agrotechnology (CPDA), an organization of inert (or other) ingredient and adjuvant manufacturers. CPDA certifies adjuvants by creating certain minimum standards that must be met in order to receive the CPDA stamp of certification. In Canada, adjuvants are regulated by the Pest Management Regulatory Agency (PMRA) section of Health Canada. Each adjuvant must be tested and be proven to be safe and effective with every active ingredient with which it will be used. This much more stringent requirement prevents both the widespread use and questionable content present in the United States. In the UK, the Chemical Regulations Directorate (CRD), part of the Health and Safety Executive, oversees the use of adjuvants. CRD defines an adjuvant as a substance other than water which is not in itself a pesticide but which enhances or is intended to enhance the effectiveness of the pesticide with which it is used. Adjuvants for use with agricultural pesticides have been categorised as extenders, wetting agents, sticking agents and fogging agents. The Council of Producers & Distributors of Agrotechnology offers participating companies the ability to self-certify their spray adjuvant products in the USA.

Lady Ingeborg √Ökesdotter Tott or 'Ingeborg Aagesdotter of the Thott' (Year of birth unknown -December 1507), in her lifetime called Ingeborg √Ökesdotter or simply Fru Ingeborg (Lady Ingeborg),Biografiskt lexikon f√∂r Finland 1. Svenska tiden (2008). was a Swedish noble, the consort of the Swedish regent Sten Sture the elder (reign 1470‚Äì97 and 1501‚Äì03). She was the fiefholder of H√§me in Finland. She functioned as the de facto queen consort of Sweden for over three decades and participated in state affairs during the reign of her spouse.  Early life  Ingeborg was the daughter of the Danish noble and riksr√•d Aage Axelsson Tott (1405‚Äì1477), governor of √ñrebro Castle in Sweden, and the Swedish noble M√§rtha Bengtsdotter of the Vinstorpa family (d. 1480). She belonged to the elite of Dano-Swedish nobility at the time and was related to the infamous Brita Tott. In 1464, she was engaged to marry the Norwegian noble Hans Sigurdsen, son of the Norwegian drots, noble Sigurd Jonsen, but he died before they were married. In 1467 she married the Swedish noble Sten Sture the elder. The marriage produced no heirs. Sten Sture was the nephew of King Charles VIII of Sweden through his mother, and the paternal uncle of Ingeborg, Ivar Axelsson Tott, was the son-in-law of Charles VIII by his marriage to Princess Magdalena of Sweden.  Wife of the regent  In 1470, Sten Sture the elder was elected Regent of Sweden after the death of his uncle Charles VIII. While Sten became the King in all but name, she was equally given the position of queen in all but name as the first lady in rank in the Swedish court.Biografiskt lexikon f√∂r Finland 1. Svenska tiden (2008). The court of Sten and Ingeborg was described as a jolly one. In 1476, she was granted equal inheritance as her brothers after their parents.Dansk biografisk Lexikon / XVII. Bind. Svend Tveskj√¶g - T√∏xen =Political influence= Ingeborg has been described as a wise, brave and intellectually capable character, and the equal match of her spouse. The marriage was described as happy. In the correspondence between regent Sten and Ingeborg, the regent referred to her as \\"Min k√§ra hj√§rtans stallbroder\\" (My hearts dearest Friend and Combrade),Carl Grimberg : Svenska folkets underbara √∂den. 1, Forntid och medeltid fram till 1521 [The wonderous destinies of the Swedish people. 1, Ancient age and middle age until 1521] (1959) and she was entrusted by him with participation in state affairs.Carl Grimberg : Svenska folkets underbara √∂den. 1, Forntid och medeltid fram till 1521 [The wonderous destinies of the Swedish people. 1, Ancient age and middle age until 1521] (1959) Ingeborg became known for her loyalty toward Sten and Sweden against her birth country Denmark.Dansk biografisk Lexikon / XVII. Bind. Svend Tveskj√¶g - T√∏xen In the absence of Sten, Ingeborg, according to the chronicles, ruled wisely over fortresses and counties. Her political involvement is apparent from her correspondence with Sten. In 1503, for example, a letter is preserved with the message that he had received her report, that a meeting between the Hanseatic League and the Danish monarch was to take place, information she had extracted from a ship from L√ºbeck, and he gave her the task to find out when and where this meeting was to take place.Carl Grimberg : Svenska folkets underbara √∂den. 1, Forntid och medeltid fram till 1521 [The wonderous destinies of the Swedish people. 1, Ancient age and middle age until 1521] (1959) During the Battle of Brunkeberg in 1471, Ingeborg called the poor of Stockholm to the Royal Castle of Tre Kronor, where she distributed food among them in exchange for their prayers of victory for the Swedes over the Danes, after which she and her ladies-in- waiting watched the battle from the castle wall, praying for victory. In 1483, during the absence of the Regent on Gotland, a riot took place in Stockholm, when the noble Sten Kristiansson Oxentstierna murdered a commoner, and the public tried to lynch him as retaliation. On this occasion, Ingeborg ventured out upon the street in an attempt to calm the situation, but she fell to the ground and was almost trampled to death in the crowd. Upon the return of the Regent, he became so agitated by this incident that he had to be prevented by the council from exacting revenge upon the city. Reportedly, his warning to the city of Stockholm on this occasion kept the peace in the city for the remainder of his reign. =Patronage= Ingeborg showed an interest in science, theology and education. In 1477, she encouraged the foundation of the first secular university in Sweden, the Uppsala University. She acted as a patron of science and literature, and gave donations to finance libraries and the printing and translations of books. Ingeborg commissioned the De dignitate et utilitate psalteriibeatae Mariae virginis by Alanus de Rupe, which was completed in 1498.Wolfgang Undorf: From Gutenberg to Luther: Transnational Print Cultures in Scandinavia 1450-1525 She also took an interest in religion. She and acted as the patron of the Order of the Carmelites as the benefactor of the Carmelite convent of Varberg, which was founded by her father. In 1493, she acted as the patron of the first convent of the Carthusian Order in Sweden, the Carthusian convent of Mariefred. =Interlude and second regency= In 1497, the nominal union with Denmark was again made a fact when John, King of Denmark, was elected King of Sweden. Thereby, Sten lost his position of Regent. Sten and Ingeborg left for Finland, where they held a grand court at Tavastehus Castle. In 1501, John, King of Denmark was deposed as King of Sweden in a rebellion and Sten Sture was again made Regent of Sweden. Stockholm, which was defended against the rebels by the queen of Denmark, Christina of Saxony, surrendered to the Swedish forces after a siege on 9 May 1502. After the surrender, queen Christina turned herself over to lady Ingeborg, who met the queen at the gates of the castle, and escorted her to the Vadstena Abbey, where she was to be kept prisoner. Because of the participation of her spouse in the rebellion against the Danish monarch, the estates of Ingeborg in Denmark, which she had inherited from her parents, were confiscated by the Danish crown. =Death of Sten Sture= The Regent Sten Sture died in J√∂nk√∂ping 14 December 1503, on his way back home after having escorted queen Christina back to Denmark. Lady Ingeborg was in Stockholm at the time, and initially unaware of his death. His doctor, Hemming Gadh prevented the news of his death from reaching her, and instead informed Svante Sture at Stegeborg Castle, a relative of Sten Sture who was at the time in conflict with Sten because of his ambition of being elected Regent. The purpose was to have Svante Sture elected Regent without any trouble from either the part of the Danish monarch or of Ingeborg and her followers.Carl Grimberg : Svenska folkets underbara √∂den. 1, Forntid och medeltid fram till 1521 [The wonderous destinies of the Swedish people. 1, Ancient age and middle age until 1521] (1959) There were concerns that Ingeborg, who commanded the strongholds of Sweden and Finland in the name of her spouse, particularly that of Stockholm and Kalmar, would oppose Regent Svante by turning the garrisons of these strongholds against the new regime.Carl Grimberg : Svenska folkets underbara √∂den. 1, Forntid och medeltid fram till 1521 [The wonderous destinies of the Swedish people. 1, Ancient age and middle age until 1521] (1959) It was believed that she could easily do this if she was informed of the death of Sten before the garrisons had been paid, which they were actually due to be at this time: the salary of the garrison of Kalmar Castle was at that time on the way to Kalmar, but when the courier from Ingeborg heard of Sten, he had stopped. Gadh advised Svante to order that the death of Regent Sten should be concealed from Ingeborg until the payment had reached Kalmar, that he should apprehend the courier from Ingeborg, and that, should she herself decide to travel to Kalmar, she should be stopped on her way.Carl Grimberg : Svenska folkets underbara √∂den. 1, Forntid och medeltid fram till 1521 [The wonderous destinies of the Swedish people. 1, Ancient age and middle age until 1521] (1959) The death of Regent Sten was concealed until the very last moment to prevent Ingeborg and her followers from taking any action: the corpse of Sten was hidden during the travel back to Stockholm and a servant similar in his appearance to Sten was dressed to impersonate him until they reached the capital.Carl Grimberg : Svenska folkets underbara √∂den. 1, Forntid och medeltid fram till 1521 [The wonderous destinies of the Swedish people. 1, Ancient age and middle age until 1521] (1959) Lady Ingeborg was thus not informed of the death of her spouse until the party had reached the capital, and was thus incapable of taking any action.  Later life  In January 1504, Svante Sture was elected Regent of Sweden. Ingeborg did turn over the castle strongholds of Sweden and Finland to him, but not until she had them emptied of weapons and supplies of the garrison.Carl Grimberg : Svenska folkets underbara √∂den. 1, Forntid och medeltid fram till 1521 [The wonderous destinies of the Swedish people. 1, Ancient age and middle age until 1521] (1959) As a widow, Ingeborg was granted H√§me Castle in Finland to rule as her fief. In 1505, her right as commandant of the Castle was questioned by the council, who sent her the spouse of her niece, Folke Gregerinpolka, to relieve her of her post as commandant.Biografiskt lexikon f√∂r Finland 1. Svenska tiden (2008). Ingeborg had the gates closed to him, defied the council and declared that the castle would have two masters.Biografiskt lexikon f√∂r Finland 1. Svenska tiden (2008). She was supported by the public and some of the nobility, which forced Folke Gregerinpolka to retreat.Biografiskt lexikon f√∂r Finland 1. Svenska tiden (2008). As commandant of the castle, she commanded the bailiffs and the governors of the area. Ingeborg died in December 1507.

Written between 1918 and 1921 and revised in 1927, it was the first work Var√®se composed after he moved to the United States. Although it was not his first work, he destroyed many of his earlier pieces, effectively making Am√©riques his opus one (although he never used that designation).Composer Biography - Varese, Edgard Performances The original version of Am√©riques was premiered on 9 April 1926 by the Philadelphia Orchestra under Leopold Stokowski. The revised version was premiered on 30 May 1929 by the Orchestre des Concerts Poulet under Gaston PouletGaston Poulet at the Maison Gaveau. It was first recorded in 1966 by the Utah Symphony Orchestra and Maurice Abravanel.http://www.utahsymphony.org/the- orchestra/discography In recent years, it has emerged as a popular modernist showpiece in the orchestral repertoire, with recordings by Pierre Boulez, Christoph von Dohnanyi, and Riccardo Chailly, among others.  Music  The work is in one movement which lasts around 23 minutes, with full orchestral involvement almost throughout. Although it opens quietly, with \\"Debussy-like musing\\",Gramophone Magazine, September 2001 it quickly builds in dynamic power and is punctuated by massive crescendos which are similar in style to those found in Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring but on a much larger scale. The work is marked by its fiercely dissonant chords and rhythmically complex polyphonies for percussion and winds. It develops in continuous evolution with recurring short motifs, which are juxtaposed without development. Structurally, the work is assembled by placing a number of self-contained 'blocks' of music against one another in the manner of Stravinsky. The blocks are marked primarily by texture and timbre with melody and rhythm being much more malleable. This remained common practice for Var√®se throughout his career. A number of these blocks are built out of direct quotations from other works, including the Peripetie from Arnold Schoenberg's F√ºnf Orchesterst√ºcke Op. 16, the first movement of Gustav Mahler's Third Symphony, and Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring, along with references to the big band sound of the 1920s. Commentary on Am√©riques has focused on its elemental power,Var√®se and the Music of Fire  Rudhyar Archival Project  Musical Works and Writings and its vivid representation of New York City, not failing to incorporate its howling police car sirens. Var√®se used the sirens for structural importance, as representations of a continuum pitch beyond twelve-tone equal temperament.

Grundy Hill's pitch famously sloped both downwards and also side-to-side, and was reputed to have its own microclimate. \\"Grundy Hill sloped 16 feet from top diagonal to bottom diagonal and had the contours of corrugated iron, but until the new footballing nanny state prohibited such extreme drops, the ground was Horwich's prime asset.\\" One fan recalled that, as a boy, it was his impression \\"that the base of the corner flag was level with the top of the crossbar - on the same goal line.\\" From the stands, fans had views over the field's slopes to the Rivington Pike. In 1994, the football club sold Grundy Hill to a housing developer, and moved several miles south to Leigh's Hilton Park in time for the 1995-1996 season. The move also led to the club renaming itself Leigh RMI after its new home town, although the club has subsequently changed its name to Leigh Genesis F.C.

Toowoomba City Aerodrome is both licensed and certified. The aerodrome is owned and operated by Toowoomba Regional Council. Being certified means the airfield is able to have airlines and larger charter aircraft operate from the aerodrome. Being licensed means that the aerodrome is regulated by federal transport security regulations. Toowoomba City Aerodrome does not have a control tower, however the airfield is regulated and operated under Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) regulations of aviation operations at non-tower controlled aerodromes. Until 2015, it was called Toowoomba Aerodrome. History Toowoomba was once a port of call on a Qantas International Airline Service and a Qantas flight between Brisbane and Toowoomba was the first unsubsidized passenger service in Australia. This regular daily service commenced on 9 May 1928 with a de Havilland DH.50. Several notable people have landed in Toowoomba. Bert Hinkler, born in Bundaberg, Queensland, was another pioneer aviator. In 1928 he flew the first solo flight from England to Australia, for this achievement he flew his Avro Avian G-EBOV. It was on 16 June 1928 that Hinkler landed in Toowoomba at the Clifford Park racecourse flying G-EBOV. On 29 May 1930, the first woman to fly from England to Australia, Amy Johnson, landed at the Werrington Park Aerodrome ‚Äì now called the Toowoomba City Aerodrome (also known as the Wilsonton Aerodrome). In August 1932 Sir Charles Kingsford-Smith, a pioneer Australian aviator, landed at Toowoomba in his Fokker Trimotor named the 'Southern Cross'. It was in this plane that he made the first non-stop flight across the Australian continent and the first flight across the Tasman Sea to New Zealand. Between 1939 and 1945, the airfield was used at various times by Defence Assets with the cooperation of its owner, Mr Rankin. In January 1944 the Royal Australian Air Force's (RAAF) Directorate of Works and Building (DWB) prepared the airfield for a flight of No 5 Army Co-op Squadron in its move to Toowoomba. The unit was quartered and its Wirraways were dispersed in trees across the Western Highway some north of the Wilsonton Post Office, and north of the present runway location. In June 1946 the Darling Downs Aero Club was formed on the grass paddock at Wilsonton by a small yet eager group of pilots. Initially, it operated only on the weekends (out of a borrowed tent), and flying training was conducted for and on behalf of the Club by the Royal Queensland Aero Club (Archerfield). In the 1960s the then Mayor of Toowoomba, Jack McCafferty, expressed interest in upgrading the airport and extending the runway, however these proposals were met with opposition from within the council. In the intervening years several developments near the airport boundary were allowed, effectively confining the airport and limiting expansion options. Throughout the airport history there have been many other pilots who have helped put the Toowoomba City Aerodrome on the map, including well-known Australian and international pilot, Guido Zuccoli. Toowoomba is the home of the famed Zuccoli Collection of aircraft and other vehicles.

In 2010 the Toowoomba Regional Council decided to develop the Wilsonton site with additional Queensland State Government funding allowing a $10 million expansion. The development followed industry recommendations to extend the main runway to , and to increase the ramp space for passenger aircraft parking. However, the airport terminal was not redeveloped despite some community sentiment suggesting it is inadequate. The main runway was primarily extended to the east within the confines of the existing airport boundary, with the earthworks extension completed in July 2011. Further runway surfacing work was delayed until warmer weather allowed the tarmac to cure. Development was spurred on by Council business surveys conducted in 2009 that suggested there was sufficient traffic to sustain both direct Brisbane and Sydney flights. The Toowoomba Mayor has alluded to the fact that Council is continuing negotiation with several regional airlines to develop and commence RPT flights direct to Sydney or other centres. The commencement of Skytrans Dash-8 services on the Western Route via Toowoomba has assisted to demonstrate the effectiveness of regional turbo-prop aircraft operating directly in Toowoomba with a low noise footprint. In July 2011 it was reported in the local media that Skytrans has suggested it is interested in expanding its network to include Toowoomba to Sydney services, whilst an advertising campaign by the council is imminent to attract interest in airline services more generally. The Council has suggested the process of attracting potential airline services and destinations and routes would be determined by the airlines which may allow the case for direct flights to centres other than Sydney, such as Newcastle, Gold Coast, Moree or Charleville. In July 2011 the Queensland State Government released a statewide infrastructure review which re-stated the view that a new and larger jet runway airport will be necessary to support regional development in the Toowoomba, Darling Downs and Surat Basin regions. Green field sites to the south and south west of Toowoomba have long been under consideration however expense is a concern for Toowoomba Regional Council without actual Federal or State Government assurances. The use of the Army Aviation Centre in Oakey is consistently asserted by elements of the community, however Army circuit training traffic loads are high and the prevailing training circuit directly conflicts with the most likely civil approach and departure paths. This conflict could prove unworkable for permanent co-location without significant changes to existing runway infrastructure, navigation aids, and improvements to airport access. The lack of direct vehicle approaches to Oakey Airport from Toowoomba are not ideal, as is the isolation from supporting infrastructure. The Oakey Civil Terminal co- located with the Army Aviation Flying Museum is relatively new and not highly utilised, which makes sharing of this location somewhat commercially attractive. Regional services operated under contract to the Government of Queensland was transferred to Toowoomba Wellcamp Airport on 1 January 2015, which left Toowoomba City Aerodrome without any regular passenger services. Airlines and destinations No scheduled services currently operate from Toowoomba City Aerodrome. Services operated under contract to the Government of Queensland transferred to Toowoomba Wellcamp Airport on 1 January 2015.  Incidents & Accidents  * On November 27 2001, a Beechcraft King Air C90 (registration VH-LQH) operated by Eastland Air on a charter flight to Goondiwindi crashed shortly after take off from runway 29. It was ultimately determined that the left engine lost power just as, or shortly after, the aircraft became airborne. The pilot continued the take off, however the aircraft could not gain altitude and crashed into a nearby industrial estate. All persons on board (the pilot and three passengers) were killed in the accident. No injuries were reported on the ground. The cause was ultimately determined to be a combination of maintenance and operational issues. The ATSB also noted that the characteristics of the placement and design of runway 29 were a possible contributing factor, due to the limited margin for runway overrun in case of an aborted take off.

The study shows that cutting and burning of the forests could seriously imperil the multibillion-dollar agriculture industry of the Rio Plata basin, as well as destroy the ecosystems that are home to indigenous people. According to the study, the IIRSA would also wipe out some of Earth's richest storehouses of terrestrial and freshwater life and would negatively affect climate change by releasing into the atmosphere the huge quantities of carbon dioxide stored in the biomass of the tropical forest--estimated at about twenty times the world's total annual greenhouse gas emissions.

Subsequently, Kamtapuri, Rajbanshi and Kurmali were also included in the list of minority languages by the West Bengal Official Language (Second Amendment) Bill, 2018.However, as of 2020, there is no official / other reliable information about the areas covered. Census 2011 provides language data only at the district and above level. In the 2011 census, Hindus numbered 137,874 and formed 93.98% of the population in Krishnaganj CD Block. Muslims numbered 8,598 and formed 5.87% of the population. Christians numbered 138 and formed 0.09% of the population. Others numbered 95 and formed 0.06% of the population. In the 2001 census, Hindus numbered 125,642 and formed 94.21% of the population of Krishnaganj CD Block. Muslims numbered 7,482 and formed 5.61% of the population. In the 1991 census, Hindus numbered 106,929 and formed 94.73% of the population of Krishnaganj CD Block. Muslims numbered 5,903 and formed 5.23% of the population. Rural poverty The District Human Development Report for Nadia has provided a CD Block-wise data table for Modified Human Vulnerability Index of the district. Krishnaganj CD Block registered 30.44 on the MHPI scale. The CD Block-wise mean MHVI was estimated at 33.92. A total of 8 out of the 17 CD Blocks in Nadia district were found to be severely deprived when measured against the CD Block mean MHVI - Karimpur I and Karimpur II (under Tehatta subdivision), Kaliganj, Nakashipara, Chapra, Krishnanagar I and Nabadwip (under Krishnanagar Sadar subdivision) and Santipur (under Ranaghat subdivision) appear to be backward. As per the Human Development Report 2004 for West Bengal, the rural poverty ratio in Nadia district was 28.35%. The estimate was based on Central Sample data of NSS 55th round 1999-2000. Economy =Livelihood= In Krishnaganj CD Block in 2011, amongst the class of total workers, cultivators formed 23.25%, agricultural labourers 37.72%, household industry workers 6.75% and other workers 32.28%. The southern part of Nadia district starting from Krishnanagar I down to Chakdaha and Haringhata has some urban pockets specialising in either manufacturing or service related economic activity and has reflected a comparatively higher concentration of population but the urban population has generally stagnated. Nadia district still has a large chunk of people living in the rural areas. =Infrastructure= There are 52 inhabited villages in Krishnaganj CD Block. 100% villages have power supply and drinking water supply. 21 Villages (40.38%) have post offices. 47 villages (90.38%) have telephones (including landlines, public call offices and mobile phones). 46 villages (88.46%) have a pucca approach road and 34 villages (65.38%) have transport communication (includes bus service, rail facility and navigable waterways). 11 villages (23.08%) have agricultural credit societies and 12 villages (18.18%) have banks. It should, however, be noted that although 100% villages in Nadia district had power supply in 2011, a survey in 2007-08 revealed that less than 50% of households had electricity connection. In rural areas of the country, the tube well was for many years considered to be the provider of safe drinking water, but with arsenic contamination of ground water claiming public attention it is no longer so. Piped water supply is still a distant dream. In 2007-08, the availability of piped drinking water in Nadia district was as low as 8.6%, well below the state average of around 20%. =Agriculture= Although the Bargadari Act of 1950 recognised the rights of bargadars to a higher share of crops from the land that they tilled, it was not implemented fully. Large tracts, beyond the prescribed limit of land ceiling, remained with the rich landlords. From 1977 onwards major land reforms took place in West Bengal. Land in excess of land ceiling was acquired and distributed amongst the peasants. Following land reforms land ownership pattern has undergone transformation. In 2013-14, persons engaged in agriculture in Krishnaganj CD Block could be classified as follows: bargadars 6.90%, patta (document) holders 10.65%, small farmers (possessing land between 1 and 2 hectares) 6.35%, marginal farmers (possessing land up to 1 hectare) 30.59% and agricultural labourers 45.50%. As the proportion of agricultural labourers is very high, the real wage in the agricultural sector has been a matter of concern. Krishnaganj CD Block had 9 fertiliser depots, 6 seed stores and 30 fair price shops in 2013-14. In 2013-14, Krishnaganj CD Block produced 2,488 tonnes of Aman paddy, the main winter crop from 991 hectares, 5,286 tonnes of Boro paddy (spring crop) from 1,486 hectares, 2.138 tonnes of Aus paddy (summer crop) from 931 hectares, 1,252 tonnes of wheat from 415 hectares, 61,195 tonnes of jute from 3,808 hectares and 1,240 tonnes of potatoes from 40 hectares. It also produced pulses and oilseeds. In 2013-14, the total area irrigated in Krishnaganj CD Block was 1,567 hectares, out of which 1,007 hectares were irrigated by river lift irrigation and 560 hectares by deep tube wells. =Banking= In 2013-14, Krishnaganj CD Block had offices of 4 commercial banks and 3 gramin banks. Transport Krihnaganj CD Block has 7 ferry services and 4 originating/ terminating bus services. The main line of the Eastern Bengal Railway from Sealdah to Ranaghat, was opened in 1862 and extended to Kushtia, now in Bangladesh, the same year. After partition of India in 1947, the main line got truncated and what remained in the southern part of West Bengal formed the Gede branch line. As of 2017, Gede railway station, in this block, is the last railway station in India and border checkpoint on way to Bangladesh. SH 8, originates from Majhdia in this CD Block and runs to Santaldih (in Purulia district). Education In 2013-14, Krishnaganj CD Block had 95 primary schools with 6,626 students, 6 middle schools with 866 students, 4 high school with 2,081 students and 13 higher secondary schools with 16,052 students. Krishnaganj CD Block had 1 general college with 4,120 students and 300 institutions for special and non- formal education with 7,486 students In Krishnaganj CD Block, amongst the 52 inhabited villages, 2 villages did not have any school, 35 had more than 1 primary school, 23 had at least 1 primary and 1 middle school and 15 had at least 1 middle and 1 secondary school. Healthcare In 2014, Krishnaganj CD Block had 1 rural hospital and 3 primary health centres, with total 35 beds and 4 doctors (excluding private bodies). It had 21 family welfare subcentres. 2,286 patients were treated indoor and 206,614 patients were treated outdoor in the hospitals, health centres and subcentres of the CD Block. Krishnaganj Rural Hospital, with 25 beds at Krishnaganj, is the major government medical facility in the Krishnaganj CD block. There are primary health centres at Matiari (Banpur) (with 10 beds), Joyghata (with 4 beds) and Bhajanghat (with 6 beds). Krishnaganj CD Block is one of the areas of Nadia district where ground water is affected by high level of arsenic contamination. The WHO guideline for arsenic in drinking water is 10 mg/ litre, and the Indian Standard value is 50 mg/ litre. All the 17 blocks of Nadia district have arsenic contamination above this level. The maximum concentration in Krishnaganj CD Block is 594 mg/litre.

Many in today‚Äôs churches have become conscious of and concerned about sexism. Bruce Metzger states the English language is so biased towards the male gender that it may restrict and obscure meaning from original languages. The New Revised Standard Version (NRSV) was one of the first major translations to adopt gender-neutral language. The King James Version translated at least one passage using a technique that many now reject in other translations, \\"Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God\\" (Matt. 5:9). The Greek word œÖ·º±Œø·Ω∂ that appears in the original is usually translated as \\"sons\\", but in this passage the translators chose to use the term \\"children\\" that included both genders. Opponents of gender neutral language believe that readers who are not familiar with the original languages, can be influenced by a compromised meaning they believe is feminist. Translation of the names of God There are a number of ways to translate the names of God into English from Hebrew. Hebrew uses only four consonants for the name‚ÄîYod-Heh-Waw-Heh (◊ô◊î◊ï◊î, YHWH)‚Äîhence it is called the Tetragrammaton. Some modern English bibles render this as LORD‚ÄîL capital, and ord in small capital case. Others use Yahweh, and the old King James Version used Jehovah. In English, outside Bible translations, the tetragrammaton is often written as YHWH or YHVH. The original meaning of this form is connected with the \\"I AM\\" of Exodus 3:14 (and it probably contains a Hebrew masculine verb prefix‚Äîthe Y or yod). Sometimes this word is rendered into English by using Hebrew Adonai, instead of attempting to directly translate YHWH, following an ancient Jewish custom of respect. The Hebrew word Adonai literally means my lord (with pseudo-plural), and is usually translated as Lord. The Hebrew names Elohim, El, Shaddai, and Yah are usually translated as God‚Äîwith Elohim being the most common. Elyon translates as Most High. There are a number of compound names for God. YHVH Tzevaot is translated as Lord of Hosts. YHVH Elohe tzevaot would be Lord God of Hosts. Among non-Orthodox Jews, there is a growing tendency to avoid the gender-in-English-language debate, and to simultaneously reclaim the vocabulary of Hebrew itself, by not translating these names in English prayers. An example of a traditional translation is: *\\"The earth belongs to the , and all it contains; the world and its inhabitants.\\" (Psalm 24) An alternative translation is: *\\"The earth belongs to Adonai, and all it contains; the world and its inhabitants.\\" = Third person pronouns for God = Many prayers use one or more of the names for God many times within the same paragraph. The first time it appears a proper name is used, while further instances use a third person pronoun (he, she or it). English speakers usually use masculine or feminine third person pronouns to refer to people, and the third person pronoun‚Äî\\"it\\"‚Äîto refer to non-people. Traditionally, in Jewish, Christian, and Muslim writing, the third-person pronoun \\"He\\" has been used to refer to God in English translations. In non-religious contexts, English speakers have generally used the word \\"he\\" as a substitute for a gender- neutral third person pronoun. The idea of God being an \\"It\\" rather than a \\"he\\" or \\"she\\" does have some support in Jewish, Christian and Islamic rationalist medieval thought, much of which was based on Neo-Aristotelian philosophy. Some medieval philosophers of all three of these religions took great pains to make clear that God was in no way like a person, and that all apparently physical descriptions of God were only poetic metaphors. In the Chinese language, translators of the Christian Bible have created a new Chinese character to act as a divine pronoun: Á•Ç (Pinyin: tƒÅ). TƒÅ, in essence, is the universal third person pronoun for all objects and persons. However, personhood (as well as gender) can be distinguished in writing. The normal pronoun for he, ‰ªñ, is also used in generic cases. The radical ‰∫ª(r√©n) marks personhood (distinct from non- human referents), not simply gender alone. The radical in Á•Ç, Á§ª(sh√¨), marks the \\"elevated personhood\\" of divinity, without implying anything about the gender of the divinity referred to.

Early years Albert Edward Frost was born on 7 March 1914 and educated at Oulton School in Liverpool. In his younger days, Frost was a keen swimmer and runner. A long-standing member of the Belgrave Harriers athletics club in Wimbledon, he was remembered for a battling run in deep snow in the 1947 English National Cross Country Championship, in which the club secured second place. He studied at London University and was called to the bar at Middle Temple. In 1937 he joined the Inland Revenue to train as a tax inspector, and in 1949 was recruited to be deputy head of ICI's tax department. He became treasurer of the group in 1960 before being promoted to finance director ‚Äì the fourth holder of that post in ICI's short history to have begun his career at the Inland Revenue. Career A tax expert by background and a master of financial detail, Frost helped streamline the management of ICI by providing a central finance function for a group whose operational structure in the postwar decades still reflected its origins in the merger of four companies in 1926. As finance director from 1968, he faced the challenge of accounting for high levels of inflation ‚Äì and took a firm stance against new accounting standards that he did not feel reflected ICI's position fairly. He also established the group's first pension fund and radically improved its financial communications, using films to explain year-end results to staff. Having retired from ICI in 1976, Frost took on a remarkable portfolio of non- executive appointments. He was one of the first outsiders from industry to be invited on to the Marks & Spencer board, and despite the autocratic style of the chairman, Marcus Sieff, Frost's views carried considerable weight in the company. He also served on the board of the state-owned British Airways ‚Äì but was generally wary of nationalised industries, and took more persuading to lend his skills to British Leyland (BL), the strike-torn car maker. He accepted the challenge in 1977, as part of a complete change of top management at BL, only on condition that \\"my role as chairman of the funding committee must be meaningful, and no Friday meetings\\". He went on to press the Labour government, rather forcefully, to inject ¬£450 million of new capital into the group. BL's chief executive, Sir Michael Edwardes, wrote later that \\"the outspoken Frost is one of the most financially orientated businessmen in Britain\\"; complex arguments with the National Enterprise Board over the shape of BL's balance sheet were \\"meat and drink to him\\". Frost briefed himself meticulously before board meetings, set clear objectives for himself and others, and managed his time so that none of his commitments fell by the wayside. By 1980 the restructuring of BL (boosted by a joint venture with Honda of Japan) was on track, and Frost moved on to apply similar treatment to another state-owned business, British Steel Corporation ‚Äì in partnership with the Scots-born American industrialist Ian MacGregor, who became British Steel's chairman having previously been deputy chairman of BL. In the City, meanwhile, Frost was a director of Warburgs, the merchant bank which had been his financial adviser at ICI, until 1983, when he was asked to become chairman of a troubled smaller bank, Guinness Mahon, and to join the board of its parent, Guinness Peat. There he found a battle in progress between two combative personalities ‚Äì the Bank of England-appointed chief executive Alastair Morton (later chairman of Eurotunnel) and the major shareholder, the commodity trader Lord Kissin. Even Frost's wise counsel could not bring harmony between them. Philanthropy Throughout his senior career, Frost always found time for music. A keen violinist who particularly enjoyed string quartets, he had been known to announce that a meeting must end promptly because he had \\"an appointment with Beethoven\\" to keep. Having stepped back from business when he reached 70 in 1984, he remained active on behalf of a range of musical and other causes, seeking no recognition for many acts of personal generosity. In his later years he was a member of the Arts Council and the appeal committee of the Royal Opera House, a deputy chairman of the Association for Business Sponsorship of the Arts, and chairman of the Robert Mayer Trust for Youth and Music and of the City of London Carl Flesch international violin competition ‚Äì for which he devised a unique voting system for jurors. He was also a driving force in establishing the Loan Fund for Musical Instruments to encourage young British string players. He assisted with the British contribution to the 1987 exhibition of Stradivari instruments in Cremona to commemorate the great violin maker's 250th anniversary; and in 2005 he helped the Royal Academy of Music to purchase the \\"Viotti ex-Bruce\\" Stradivarius. He was chairman of Remploy, the organisation which provides employment services for the disabled, and deputy chairman of governors of the United Medical Schools of Guy's and St Thomas's hospitals. Honours He was appointed CBE in 1983. Later years In his nineties, though no longer able to play the violin, Albert Frost remained uncomplaining and keenly interested in current affairs. He married, in 1942, to Eug√©nie Maude Barlow, who died in 2008. They had no children.

It also has a slightly larger screen (3.2 inches instead of 3) and higher battery life (up to 24 hours for music, versus up to 14). Although similar internally battery life improvements were possible due to a reduction in the refresh rate (30 Hz down from 60 Hz) and CPU clock speed (499 Mhz down from 524 Mhz). The D-pad of the original has been replaced by the patented Zune Pad, which supplements 5-way clicking using a capacitive touchpad similar to the iPod Click Wheel and only responding to human touch. The Zune 80 shipped with a newer firmware version than the original Zune, but a firmware update for the original restored parity. The Wi-Fi antenna could be used for buying music on the device, playing with others in games via Wi-Fi, wireless synchronization and to share photos, podcasts, and music with other Zunes, although shared songs may only be played three times on the receiving Zune. Reception The Zune 80 has been reviewed more positively than its predecessor and on par with the iPod classic, its primary competitor during the period. CNET's review said, \\"The Zune has blossomed from an ugly duckling into a worthy iPod alternative.\\" Wired's head-to-head review said the Zune 80 edged out the iPod classic due to its screen, Wi-Fi, radio, and navigation.Wired Review However, some reviews have also been critical of the Zune Marketplace, which lacked movies (though it later began carrying TV shows and movies), and the lack of Mac support. Availability Most stores did not stock the player during its launch as they were delayed for 6 weeks. However, there were limited numbers of Zune 80s in some stores like Circuit City and Wal-Mart, and most were sold out as soon as they were available. As of June 13, 2008 the Zune was available in Canada at most major retailers including The Source, Best Buy, and Future Shop. The Zune has since been discontinued at these retailers from mid-late 2009 as they were being phased out due to Marketplace issues. The 80 was available in Black and Red, and the 120 was available in black and red, with matte black on the back and glossy black on the front, and glossy red front available from the Zune Store. Durability The Zune 80 and 120 have scratch-resistant glass displays, and the back can withstand fine scratches if dropped on the floor. The premium in-ear earphones (available only with the Zune 80 unless purchased separately) are highly durable and have a magnetic back so they can stay together instead of coiling around each other to prevent damage to the wire. Modification As with many hard disk based media players Zune owners have a few options regarding upgrades. Using a pry tool will allow the user to access the hard disk and battery for replacement/repair. Note that the battery is soldered with 4 wires and incorrect wiring will likely harm the device. Due to Windows CE limitations the maximum drive size seems to be 120GB (including 128GB based solid state drives). Note that compatibility is limited to 1.8\\" PATA drives and uses a specific ZIF interface. The ZIF connector is plug and play but users will have to host their own firmware update server to allow the Zune software to load firmware onto the new drive due to Microsoft's discontinuation of all Zune services.

He previously served as the head coach at the University of Southern Mississippi from 2008 to 2011 and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill from 2012 to 2018. Coaching career Fedora played wide receiver at Austin College before starting his coaching career as a graduate assistant there in 1986. He spent four seasons as head coach of the junior varsity team at Garland High School, a powerhouse in Texas high school football, but then returned to the collegiate ranks, coaching tight ends, wide receivers and running backs for six seasons (1991‚Äì96) at Baylor. Fedora moved on to coach the passing game and receivers at United States Air Force Academy from 1997‚Äì98, before he became offensive coordinator at Middle Tennessee State University in 1999. In 2002, he was hired by Ron Zook to join his coaching staff at the University of Florida. Fedora served as run game coordinator in 2002, perimeter game coordinator in 2003 and offensive coordinator in 2004. During those three seasons, Fedora also coached the running backs and receivers. In 2005, Fedora joined Mike Gundy's staff at Oklahoma State. His brother, Lee Fedora, serves as head football coach at A&M; Consolidated High School in College Station, Texas and formerly coached at Navasota High School in Navasota, Texas. Fedora is a proponent of the spread offense Fedora drew several assistant coaching offers from top-tier schools including LSU and Alabama as well as some head coaching offers including Rice and Air Force.NewsOK.com: Fedora has chance to advance Earning $393,000 a year at Oklahoma State, Fedora was one of the top paid offensive coordinators in the country. In November 2007, Fedora was rumored to be a candidate for the head coaching job at Baylor University, which eventually went to Art Briles.The Sporting News: Coaching Carousel: Baylor job could open soon =Southern Miss= On December 11, 2007, Fedora was named the new head coach of Southern Miss, replacing outgoing Jeff Bower. He signed a four-year contract with a $650,000 base salary, but incentives in the contract could bring the contract close to $900,000.Hattiesburg American: Incentives may push salary near $900K He made a big splash in his first recruiting season, as Fedora was able to land five-star prospect DeAndre Brown, who had offers from several Southeastern Conference schools, such as LSU, Ole Miss, and Auburn. Southern Miss was generally regarded as having the best recruiting class of the mid-major schools. Fedora opened his first season as head coach at Southern Miss with a 51‚Äì21 drubbing of Louisiana‚ÄìLafayette, in which the Golden Eagles broke the school record for total yards in a single game with 633. Under Fedora, Southern Miss notched the four most prolific offensive seasons in its 100-year football history. His players also graduated at a higher rate than at any time in school history. In 2011, Fedora led his 24th-ranked Southern Mississippi team to winning the Conference USA championship by defeating Kevin Sumlin's then-No. 6 ranked and then- undefeated, Houston Cougars, two weeks after losing to UAB.The Clarion-Ledger: Believe it now =North Carolina= On December 7, 2011, ESPN's Joe Schad reported that Fedora accepted an offer to take the job at North Carolina, but still planned to coach the Golden Eagles in the 2011 Hawai'i Bowl.Source: UNC to hire Larry Fedora. ESPN, 2011-12-07. His hiring was officially announced the next day.Larry Fedora Will Be New Football Coach. UNC Athletic Department, 2011-12-08. He was formally introduced as UNC's 34th full-time head coach on December 9.North Carolina introduces Larry Fedora as new football coach USA Today, 2011-12-09. He promised to implement an aggressive, attacking philosophy on both sides of the ball, with the same wide-open spread offense he implemented at Southern Miss and a blitz-heavy defense. He summed up his philosophy with a quote from George S. Patton‚Äî\\"Instead of waiting to see what might develop, attack constantly, vigorously and viciously. Never let up, never stop, always attack.\\" He vowed that Tar Heel football would be known for \\"playing smart, playing fast, and playing physical.\\"Transcript of Fedora's introductory press conference Fedora was already a familiar face to recently hired UNC athletic director Bubba Cunningham, who had arrived a few months earlier from Conference USA rival Tulsa. Fedora knew that he would not be able to compete in post-season play in his first year due to NCAA probation for recruiting and academic violations. Fedora led the Golden Eagles in the Hawaii Bowl, officially beginning his duties at UNC on January 1. His first season at UNC saw the Tar Heels finish with their first winning record in ACC play since 2004 and their third winning conference record of the millennium. Notably, they notched their first win over North Carolina State since 2006. Their probation kept them from being considered for the ACC Championship Game. Following the firing of Tennessee coach Derek Dooley, Fedora was a prime candidate to succeed him. However, on December 5, one of UNC's early recruits, Jordan Fieulleteau, told The News & Observer and Inside Carolina that Fedora had assured him he would not leave UNC.Carter, Andrew. Fedora assures recruit he will remain Tar Heels coach. The News & Observer, 2012-12-06.Callahan, Don. Fedora tells recruit he's staying . Inside Carolina, 2012-12-05. A day later, Fedora told his team at their last meeting of the season that he would remain their coach.Fedora tells team he's staying at UNC . WNCN, 2012-12-06. According to WNCN in Goldsboro, Fedora spoke with former Baylor coach Chuck Reedy, who'd given him his first full-time collegiate job, and said that he \\"turned down more money than I ever thought I'd see\\" because he was more than happy in Chapel Hill.Report: UNC's Fedora turned down 'more money than I ever thought I'd see' . WNCN, 2012-12-06. Fedora's second season in Chapel Hill got off to a sluggish start, with five losses in their first six games, including a dismal 55‚Äì31 loss to East Carolina. However, the team recovered to win five of its final six games, including an unprecedented 80‚Äì20 thrashing of Old Dominion‚Äîthe most points that a Tar Heel team has ever scored. But the Tar Heels then lost for the second straight year to their archrival Duke. The Tar Heels defeated Cincinnati 39‚Äì17 in the 2013 Belk Bowl in Charlotte. In 2014, the Tar Heels were never able to achieve much consistency on defense, giving up over 1497 yards per game (111th in the nation, and fourth-worst among NCAA teams) en route to a 6‚Äì6 season and a 40‚Äì21 loss to Rutgers in the 2014 Quick Lane Bowl. Partly to address this, Fedora hired former Auburn head coach Gene Chizik as defensive coordinator for the 2015 season. The result was one of the greatest regular seasons in school history. After a season-opening loss to South Carolina, the Tar Heels reeled off 11 straight wins, the longest winning streak in the modern history of the program. As part of that streak, they rolled over Duke 66‚Äì31‚Äîthe most points that the Tar Heels have ever scored in the history of the rivalry, and the most that a Tar Heel team has ever scored in ACC play. A week later, they defeated Miami 59‚Äì21 to clinch their first nine-win season in 18 years, and their first undefeated home slate in 19 years. They then defeated Virginia Tech in overtime 30‚Äì27 to clinch their first official Coastal Division championship, as well as the eighth 10-win season in school history.http://www.cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/active/n/north_carolina/ten_win_seasons.php A week later, they knocked off N.C. State 45‚Äì34, mainly on the strength of a 220-yard rushing performance by sophomore tailback Elijah Hood. This gave the Tar Heels their first undefeated conference slate since 1980. The 11 wins also set a new school record for regular-season wins, and was only the fourth time in school history that a Tar Heel team had won that many. The day before the 2015 ACC Championship Game, Fedora signed a new seven-year contract. The Tar Heels lost the championship game to #1 Clemson 45‚Äì37 for their first loss in over two months. For the 2016 season, Fedora coached the Tar Heels to an 8‚Äì5 (5‚Äì3) record. Unable to duplicate his team's success from a season earlier, the Tar Heels lost in the Sun Bowl to Stanford with a score of 25‚Äì23. With the loss, Fedora is currently 3‚Äì5 all-time in bowl games. In the summer of 2018, Fedora criticized the proposed changes to the kickoff rule in football. He stated that \\"Our game is under attack\\" and compared threats to football to American politics by expressing that he \\"fear[s] that the game will get pushed so far to one extreme that you won‚Äôt recognize it 10 years from now. And I do believe that if it gets to that point, our country goes down, too.‚Äù He then relayed a story where he purportedly asked a three-star general what makes America's military the \\"greatest\\" on earth. The general replied \\"That‚Äôs easy. We‚Äôre the only football-playing nation in the world.\\" On November 25, 2018, following a 1-7 season in conference play for the 2nd season in a row and an overtime home loss to rival NC State, North Carolina fired Fedora.https://www.saturdaydownsouth.com/sec-football/north-carolina- officially-fires-larry-fedora-large-buyout-information-revealed/ =Texas= Fedora joined Tom Herman's staff as an analyst on February 18, 2019.Texas hires Fedora =Baylor= Fedora was named offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach at Baylor on January 25, 2020 by first-year head coach Dave Aranda.

She was one of the main suspects in the witch trial of Copenhagen the summer of 1590, which were held as a parallel to the famous North Berwick Witch trials in Edinburgh in Scotland. The winter of 1589, Princess Anne of Denmark departed from Copenhagen to marry King James VI of Scotland. A great storm arose, which almost caused the ship to sink. The ship of the princess eventually harbored in Oslo in the Danish province of Norway, James VI joined her there, and the wedding took place in Norway instead of in Scotland, as had been planned. In the spring of 1590, after a few months at the Danish court, James VI and Anna returned to Scotland. Their voyage from Denmark was also beset by storms. The Danish court at that time was greatly perplexed by witchcraft and the black arts, and this must have impressed on the young King James. In the summer of 1590, a great witch hunt was instituted in Copenhagen. The Danish minister of finance, Christoffer Valkendorff, was accused by the Admiral Peder Munk of having equipped the royal ship so insufficiently that it had been unable to withstand the weather.√Öberg, Alf, H√§xorna: de stora trolldomsprocesserna i Sverige 1668-1676, Esselte studium/Akademif√∂rl., G√∂teborg, 1989 He defended himself by saying that the storm had been caused by witches in the house of Karen the Weaver, who had sent little demons in empty barrels who had climbed up the keels of the ships and caused the storm.√Öberg, Alf, H√§xorna: de stora trolldomsprocesserna i Sverige 1668-1676, Esselte studium/Akademif√∂rl., G√∂teborg, 1989 Karen was arrested in July. She confessed to have caused the storms which hunted the royal ship by use of witchcraft, and named other women as accomplices. One of them was Anna Koldings. During torture, Koldings described how a group of women had gathered in the house of Karen, where they had caused the storm of the princess' ship by sending small devils up the keels of the ship. Koldings named five other women as accomplices, among them Malin, wife of the mayor of Copenhagen, and Margrethe Jakob Skrivers. All women were arrested and charged, while the spouse of Skrivers unsuccessfully tried to defend her. Anne Koldings was considered a very dangerous witch, and referred to as Mother of the Devil. She was treated as somewhat of a celebrity in prison and displayed to visitors: she is known to have confessed to two priests and three female visitors while in prison. Anne Koldings was judged guilty as charged and executed by burning at the stake at Kronborg. Twelve women were reportedly executed for involvement in this witch trial. In September, two women were burnt as witches at Kronborg.Ethel Carleton Williams, Anne of Denmark (Longman, 1970).

Biography His father, Shozo Kishida, descended from a samurai family of Kishu and worked as a military officer in the imperial guard. As the eldest son in his family, it was expected that Kishida would carry on the military tradition. He graduated from the Japanese Military Academy in 1912, and he served as sub-lieutenant in the army for two years. In 1916 Kishida enrolled at the University of Tokyo in order to study French Literature. While attending university, Kishida became interested in French theatre, and in 1919 he left the University of Tokyo without graduating and sailed for France. He arrived in Paris in 1920, and managed to sustain himself by working part-time as a translator for the Japanese Embassy and for the Secretariat of the League of Nations. Kishida started to attend lectures at the University of Paris, and it was through his professor there that he was introduced to Jacques Copeau. He studied the nuances of French theatre under Copeau, and he became exposed to performances of Shakespeare, Chekhov, and Beaumarchais through Copeau‚Äôs productions. In October 1922, Kishida experienced a lung hemorrhage and left his studies to recuperate in southern France. A month into his recovery, Kishida heard news that his father died and he immediately returned to Tokyo to take care of his mother and sisters. He became interested in earnestly pursuing playwriting after a dinner with author Yuzo Yamamoto in early 1923. The earthquake that wreaked havoc in Tokyo in 1923 caused Kishida to put his playwriting on hold and pursue other means of making a living. By 1924, Kishida had become a large force in the rebirth of the New Theatre movement in the wake of the earthquake, helping to establish the magazine Engeki Shincho (New Currents of Drama) along with the founder of the Tsukiji Little Theater Kaoru Osanai. It was in this magazine that Kishida‚Äôs earliest play Furui Omocha (Old Toys) was first published. While they started out as colleagues, the disparity in ideals between Kishida and Osanai caused a rift in their relationship. Kishida wrote a scathing review for a literary magazine of the first three productions at the Tsukiji Little Theater, criticizing the actors, choice of plays, and the character of Osanai himself. In turn, Osanai cut off all relations with Kishida and refused, despite popular demand, to produce any of his plays. After the falling-out with Osanai, Kishida went on to pursue his own writing career, working for a variety of prominent literary reviews and magazines, including Bungei shunju (Literary Annals) and Bungei Jidai (Literary Age). It was through these magazines that Kishida gained a foothold in the world of Japanese drama. Kishida founded the Bungakuza (Literature Theatre Company) in 1937, which went on to produce a variety of famous actors, actresses (including his own daughter Ky≈çko Kishida), and dramatists (including the acclaimed playwright Tanaka Chikao). In 1938, Kishida was sent by the Japanese government to the southern front of the Marco Polo Bridge Incident in China in order to chronicle the conflict. Considered to be a ‚Äúsafe‚Äù literary figure by the increasingly oppressive Japanese government because of his introspective style and non-inflammatory political beliefs, Kishida detailed his travels in China in his book Jugun gojunichi (Following the Troops for Fifty Days).Mayo, Marlene J. War, Occupation, and Creativity: Japan and East Asia, 1920-1960. Honolulu: U of Hawai'i, 2001. Print. On March 5, 1954 Kishida died in a Tokyo theater of a sudden stroke during a dress rehearsal.Miller, J. Scott. Historical Dictionary of Modern Japanese Literature and Theater. Lanham, Md.: Scarecrow, 2009. Print. After his experiences with theatre in France, Kishida became highly critical of Japanese drama, believing it to be far below European theatre. Kishida faced a Japanese theatrical world that he believed to be devoid of properly trained actors, full of pretentious political ideals, and lacking an audience that was attuned to modern drama.

She was the first woman in the Swedish royal guard. Her story was a well known and discussed event in her time, and later regarded to exemplify the vivacious Gustavian age.  Background  The daughter of lieutenant Carl du Rietz and Eva Cronhjelm, she was described as a woman with the stunning intelligence of an Amazon, with power and courage, temperament and beauty, and a \\"mind of fire\\". She grew up in a mansion in Sm√•land. She ran away from home three times; the cause was thought to have been the strictness of her parents combined with the \\"reading of too many novels\\". The first time, she reached Stockholm, where she was discovered and captured by her brothers; the second time she escaped to her doting grandparents on V√§rmd√∂n. The third time, however, she dressed herself like a man and enlisted in the Royal regiment at court in Stockholm, as the first female ever.  In the Royal Guard  During her time as a guard soldier, she preserved her male identity through her \\"female cunning\\", but as the story goes, she had so many troubles with sexual advances from both women and men that in the end she could see no other solution but to reveal her identity to the king himself before she was discovered in some other way. According to the legend, she stepped forward and fell down before the king one day when he passed a row of soldiers, of which she was one. She then revealed her identity to him. When she did so, the king, Gustav III, was highly amused by her story. He allowed her to marry a librarian at the royal court, Erik Johan Paulin. They were both described as very happy about this. Paulin had a priest-education, and the king gave him the post of vicar in Kungsbacka parish. Carin was related to Charlotte Du Rietz, to whom the monarch had a strong attachment. De Rietz died in childbirth shortly after the family moved into their new home; her husband and child died soon after.  Context and other examples  Du Rietz was far from the only example of women personating and living as men. The 18 May 1780 an incident was reported in the newspaper as a warning example; > As a great benefit to the maids of the city, death newly discovered a > terrible fraud, which, if it becomes an example, would alarm the fair sex, > humiliate the clothing of males and make medical examinations necessary for > both engagements and weddings. One of the coachmen of the city of Link√∂ping, Petter Cederl√∂f, had suddenly taken ill and died within ten hours. The woman taking care of the body then discovered that the man was in fact a woman. It was decided to make it public as a warning. Cederl√∂f had been hired the spring before after having shown all the necessary papers, amused himself with the maids, and finally proposed and engaged himself with a maid from the city. The fianc√©e was initially devastated over the death of her dear \\"Petter\\", but when she was told, it was reported that: All her tears have suddenly ceased. Many such stories are told, some of them quite famous; Gustafva Juliana Cederstr√∂m, (1746‚Äì1801) was widely known in the country for having served in several professions as a man, and on the opposite side, there was Lasse-Maja, a man dressing himself as a woman.

History 2005 - 2008 Genod Droog was born as a result of the desire of Ed Holden and Dylan Roberts to start performing live after Pep Le Pew, a successful Welsh language hip hop group, which split up in the winter of 2004. Dylan Roberts, Gethin Evans and Carwyn Jones attended Ysgol Eifion Wyn and Ysgol Eifionydd Porthmadog and have been friends from an early age. Carwyn Jones was a DJ, DJing under the name DJ Kermit and DJ Kim De Bills to which he still now referred to within the band. Gethin Evans has played drums for a few groups the most successful would be Kentucky AFC until their split in 2007 and latterly Yucatan. Ed Holden i was a DJ, rapper, producer and beat boxer and knew Dylan through Coleg Menai in Bangor and had several side projects since they met in 1999, most notable Invisible Ninja Storm, Y Soffas and Pep Le Pew. Aneirin Karadog found Ed Holden through freestyle battles in Eisteddfod and subsequently joined the band having been in bands with Ed such ad the Syn-D- Cut and Y Diwygiad (The Reformation) Dylan Roberts or Dyl Mei, as he is known, is a producer from Porthmadog and has been awarded several BBC Radio Cymru C2 awards for best producers for albums such as Baccta Crackin by Texas Radio Band and 'Un tro yn y gorllewin' by Pep Le Pew. He also has recorded music from many other bands during his time at Blaen-y-Cae studio, Garndolbenmaen. Between the five of them they decided that there was a place within the Welsh music scene to make a band that was entertaining as well as musically original. Their first gig was with Drymbago and MC Saizmundo at the Railway Club in Bangor and have since been gigging all over Wales with the a few exceptions of gigs in England. Most notable gig outside Wales was in the Barfly, London as part of the first BBC Electric Proms festivals, where the band worked with Gill Edwards and Ensemble Cymru on two songs. An early recording of Breuddwyd Oer featuring Gwyneth Glyn on vocals appeared on Dan y Cownter 2 compilation in 2006.1 They went on to win best live and most popular band awards by the BBC Cymru C2 Rock and Pop (RAP) awards and were regarded as one of the best live bands in the Welsh language scene, because of their use of balloons, streamers and party atmosphere they produce during their live performances. Their biggest audience gig to date is a headlining the Sesiwn Fawr Dolgellau in 2007, held annually at Dolgellau. The band were nominated as best live Welsh language act with Euros Childs, Sibrydion and Radio Luxembourg at the 2007 Pop Factory Awards, held at the Coal Exchange, Cardiff. The Album 'Ni oedd y Genod Droog' was released on 4 August 2008. The album was released, with a limited edition run that came with red filtered glasses, which enabled the buyer to see hidden pictures on the cover. 'Ni oedd y Genod Droog' was launched on 19 September 2008 at Porthmadog. Before the launch the band announced their intention to split after their performance at Huw Stephens's S≈µn Festival on 16 November 2008. Band name *'Genod' means 'girls' in Welsh. *Droog is a corruption of the Welsh word \\"drwg\\" (bad), but also inspired by the droogs of A Clockwork Orange.

Prallethrin 1.6% w/w liquid vaporizer is a repellent insecticide which is generally used for the control of mosquitoes in the household. It is marketed as a mosquito repellent by Godrej as \\"GoodKnight Silver Power\\" and SC Johnson as \\"All Out\\" in India. It is also the primary insecticide in certain products for killing wasps and hornets, including their nests. It is the main ingredient in the consumer product \\"Hot Shot Ant & Roach Plus Germ Killer\\" spray. The World Health Organization published in 2004 that \\"Prallethrin is of low mammalian toxicity, with no evidence of carcinogenicity\\" and \\"is very toxic to bees and fish but of low toxicity to birds.\\" Prallethrin is a member of the pyrethroid class of insecticides. Pyrethroids have historically been classified into two groups, Type I and Type II, based upon chemical structure and neurotoxicological effect. Type I pyrethroids lack an alpha-cyano moiety and induce a syndrome consisting of aggressive sparring, altered sensitivity to external stimuli, and fine tremor progressing to whole-body tremor and prostration in rats. These Type I pyrethroid-specific behaviors are collectively described as the T-syndrome. Type II pyrethroids contain an alpha-cyano moiety and produce a syndrome that includes pawing, burrowing, salivation, and coarse tremors leading to choreoathetosis in rats. These Type II pyrethroid-specific behaviors are collectively described as the CS-syndrome (Verschoyle and Aldridge 1980; Lawrence and Casida 1982). Prallethrin is structurally similar to Type I pyrethroids. The adverse outcome pathway (AOP) shared by pyrethroids involves the ability to interact with voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) in the central and peripheral nervous system, leading to changes in neuron firing, and ultimately neurotoxicity. Prallethrin has been evaluated for a variety of toxic effects in experimental toxicity studies. Neurotoxicity was observed throughout the database and is the most sensitive endpoint. Effects were seen across species, sexes, and routes of administration. In the acute rat neurotoxicity study, decreased exploratory behavior was seen at the time of peak effect. Reduced motor activity and transient tremors were also observed in the study. In the subchronic rat neurotoxicity study, a higher arousal rate was observed in animals at the highest dose tested. Clinical signs of neurotoxicity were also observed in other toxicity studies (subchronic and chronic oral studies in dogs, developmental toxicity studies in the rat and rabbit, 21-day dermal and 28-day inhalation studies in rats). No neurotoxic effects were observed in rats in the chronic toxicity study. Effects were also observed in the liver (rats, mice, and dogs), heart (dogs), and thyroid gland (rats). Some effects were also seen in the kidney (mice and rats). However, neurotoxicity was the most sensitive endpoint in the toxicology database, and other effects were generally seen in the presence of neurotoxicity and/or at higher doses. Liver effects observed included increased weight, elevated serum cholesterol and alkaline phosphatase activity, centrilobular hepatocyte vacuolation, histiocytic infiltration, enlarged liver, and perilobular hepatocellular hypertrophy. In dogs, myocardial fiber degeneration was seen in females in the subchronic study at the highest dose tested. Heart effects were also seen in one mid-dose female in the chronic study (hemorrhage and red discoloration). However, there was no dose response for the observed heart lesions in the study. Thyroid effects were observed in rats and consisted of increases in the number of small follicles and follicular cell hypertrophy and hyperplasia. The thyroid effects were seen in short-term studies in the presence of liver effects. Kidney effects observed were increased weights and histopathology. Developmental and reproduction studies are available for prallethrin. There was no evidence of increased quantitative or qualitative susceptibility in any of the studies. In the developmental studies, no toxic effects were noted in fetuses up to the highest doses tested. Maternal effects in the studies included tremors, salivation, exaggerated reflexes, and chromorhinorrhea (the discharge of a pigmented secretion from the nose). In the reproduction study, decreased pup body weights were seen during the lactation period. Effects seen in parental animals were decreased body weights and body weight gains, increased liver weights and microscopic findings in the liver, kidney, thyroid, and pituitary. Prallethrin is classified as ‚ÄúNot Likely to be Carcinogenic to Humans.‚Äù No tumors were observed in rat and mouse carcinogenicity studies up to the highest doses tested. In both the rat and mouse studies, the animals could have tolerated higher dose levels; however, EPA determined that dose levels were adequate to assess potential carcinogenicity. Prallethrin tested negative in the majority of the genotoxicity studies. It also tested negative in an in vitro chromosomal aberration study in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO K1) cells without metabolic activation, but tested positive at all doses with metabolic activation. However, clastogenicity was not clearly dose-related, was seen at nontoxic and slightly toxic doses, and was not expressed in in vivo studies and structure-activity comparisons with the other pyrethroids revealed no correlations with clastogenicity. Other gene mutation, chromosomal aberration, and unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) studies were negative; therefore, there is no concern for genotoxicity. Acute lethality studies conducted with prallethrin indicate moderate acute toxicity via the oral and inhalation routes of administration (Category II) and low acute toxicity via the dermal route (Categories IV). It is not irritating to the skin (Category IV) but is minimally irritating to the eye (Category IV). It is not a dermal sensitizer. The weight of evidence from the available guideline, non-guideline, mechanism of action, and pharmacokinetics studies supports characterizing the toxicological profile of pyrethroids, including prallethrin, as being rapid in onset and associated with acute, peak exposures. Also, there is no apparent increase in hazard from repeated/chronic exposures to prallethrin.
