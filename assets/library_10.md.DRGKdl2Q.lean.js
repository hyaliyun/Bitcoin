Placed at the foothills of the castle hillock, the church of Santa Maria was first mentioned in 1217. There are no remains of the original church, which was enlarged at the end of the 14th and the middle of the 15th centuries. The present building, which retains a gothic air, was built between the end of the 16th century and the first quarter of the 17th century. It consists on one nave and polygonal chancel, chapels between buttresses and groin vault. On the outside, the standing features are the renaissance and baroque decoration of the facade and the bell tower, with square floor-plan, constructed around 1620 by Master Bernat N. de Matar√≥. The church was plundered and burned down in 1809, during the Independence War and in 1936, at the beginning of the Spanish Civil War.Historical Marker The Castle of Hostalric The castle is built on a basalt hill and records of it date back to the twelfth century. Its importance grew because of its strategic position, controlling the Royal Way (Cami Ral) between Barcelona and Girona, and the fact that Hostalric became the administrative capital of the viscountcy of Cabrera. It was the scene of numerous battles in mediaeval times and the old castle virtually disappeared as a result. The original design for the modern fortress was the work of Francisco de Santa Cruz, a military engineer in the service of the Archduke Charles. Work on the construction of the fortress we see today was completed between 1794 and 1795 and it became an important point of resistance against Napoleon's army during the Peninsular War (1810-1814). In 1929 the castle's garrison was transferred and Hostalric ceased to be of military significance. In 1963 the castle and the town's walls and towers were declared a Cultural Site of National Interest.

Dinneen about a real criminal case. In 1934 two Boston taxi drivers were identified by several witnesses as the culprits who murdered a man during a theater robbery in Lynn, Massachusetts. Their trial was in progress for two weeks and it seemed likely that the two were going to be found guilty, when the real killers were arrested for another crime and then admitted to the Lynn robbery-murder. Columbia Pictures had planned a much bigger production, but after political pressure from the state of Massachusetts the film's budget and publicity were scaled down considerably, and it was ultimately released as a B movie. Plot On the eve of his marriage to waitress Mary Roberts (O'Sullivan), taxi driver \\"Brick\\" Tennant is questioned as a murder suspect along with 120 other drivers, because a taxi served as the getaway car in a theater robbery in which a man was killed. When one of the witnesses swears that Brick and his friend Joe Linden (Baxter) were the killers, the district attorney (Ridges), eager for a conviction, brings the taxi drivers to trial even though Brick and Mary were in a church when the robbery took place. Although innocent, Brick and Joe are found guilty and sentenced to die in the electric chair. Mary, however, refuses to give up hope, and when she unearths a bullet from another robbery that was shot from the murder weapon, she convinces police lieutenant Everett (Bellamy) that the wrong men have been convicted. To prove Brick and Joe's innocence, Everett and Mary search for the real culprits. As the time of his execution approaches, Brick is transformed from an idealistic youth into a man whose faith in the system has been shattered. On the day of the execution, Mary and Everett finally find the real culprits. The governor then pardons Brick, but although his life has been spared, his faith can never be repaired.

It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Kendal, the archdeaconry of Westmorland and Furness, and the diocese of Carlisle. Its benefice is united with those of six local churches to form the Kirkby Lonsdale Team Ministry. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. History The church was built in 1879‚Äì80 to replace a church built in 1726 or 1727 on the same site. It was designed by the Lancaster architects Paley and Austin. The new church provided seating for 148 people at a cost of about ¬£2,000 (). The major benefactor was William Wilson of Rigmaden Park, with additional contributions from Trinity College, Cambridge, the Earl of Bective, and the vicar of Kirkby Lonsdale. The porch was added in 1903. Architecture =Exterior= St Peter's is constructed in dressed slate with ashlar dressings and slate roofs. The porch is in timber on a stone base. The architectural style is late Perpendicular. The plan of the church consists of a three bay nave with a south porch, a two- bay chancel with a north transept and vestry, and a west tower. The tower has diagonal buttresses, a south stair turret, and a saddleback roof with embattled parapets on the north and south sides. It has a three-light west window, under which is a plaque recording the rebuilding of the church, and incorporating a panel with the date 1726. There is a doorway on the north side of the tower. The windows in the sides of the nave and the chancel are straight-headed; those in the nave have two or three lights, those in the chancel have one or two lights. The east window and the window in the vestry both have four lights; the vestry also has a doorway. The transept consists of two gabled bays, and contains two-light windows. =Interior= Inside the church are waggon roofs. The font is octagonal, and the pulpit is in timber on a stone base. In the tower is an elaborate Gothic wall memorial to a couple who died in 1845 and 1851 respectively. The stained glass in the west window, dated 1865, is by Lavers, Barraud and Westlake. In a north window is glass by Hardman dated 1878.

He apparently never spoke in Parliament. He was a colonel of the militia for the Isle of Wight, which was unaffected by the Civil War, from 1642 to 1647 and a Deputy Lieutenant in 1643. He was a commissioner for sequestrations for Hampshire and a commissioner for levying money in 1643. He was a commissioner for assessment for the Isle of Wight from 1647 to 1648. He did not sit in parliament after Pride's Purge in 1648. He was commissioner for assessment for Hampshire in 1648, 1652, 1657 and 1660 and a JP for Hampshire. He was described as a man who had a strong reluctance to quarrel with anyone. In April 1660, Leigh was re-elected MP for Yarmouth for the Convention Parliament. It is unclear if he stood for election again in 1661. He was commissioner for assessment for the Isle of Wight from 1664 until his death which probably occurred in 1666. Family  Leigh married Anne Bulkeley, daughter of William Bulkeley of Nether Burgate, Fordingbridge, Hampshire and had two sons and three daughters, including John, his heir, and Elizabeth, who married Sir Peter Stanley, 2nd Baronet, of Alderley, Cheshire.

American handball Born in St. Louis, Missouri, Jacobs was Jewish. He grew up in a single-parent family in Los Angeles. He dropped out of high school before completing his education but excelled at numerous sports, including baseball, basketball, football and handball. He was credited with running in under ten seconds, winning a skeet shooting championship and shooting rounds of golf in the low 70s. Jacobs was offered the chance to try out for the US Olympic basketball team but declined in order to focus on handball. He was drafted into the army during the Korean War and was awarded a Purple Heart. In four-wall handball, Jacobs won his first American singles championship in 1955, defeating Vic Hershkowitz in the final in Chicago. In total, he won six American singles championships and six doubles championships (partnering Marty Decatur). He was additionally a three time national champion in three-wall handball. Between 1955 and 1969, he won every national handball competition match he played in. In 1966, Robert H. Boyle of Sports Illustrated wrote: \\"Jacobs is generally hailed as the finest player of all time. Indeed, there are those who say Jacobs is the best athlete, regardless of sport, in the country.\\" In 1970, he was recognised by the US Handball Association as the \\"Greatest Handball Player of the Generation\\". Boxing A longtime boxing enthusiast, Jacobs started collecting films of boxing matches at the age of 17 after reading about the controversial decision in Joe Louis and Jersey Joe Walcott's 1947 world heavyweight title fight. Wanting to judge the result for himself, he tracked down and purchased a copy of the fight. Whilst touring Europe as a handball player, he began buying up old fight films, many of which had been shipped out of America in the wake of the 1912 Congressional ban on the interstate trafficking of boxing films. Jacobs became friends with the boxing trainer Cus D'Amato. D'Amato secretly trained Jacobs intensively for six months with a view to his facing reigning world light-heavyweight champion Archie Moore, intending to make history by leading a boxer to a world title in his first ever fight. However, the bout failed to materialize. In 1959 Jacobs went into business with fellow collector Bill Cayton, and together they owned the production companies The Greatest Fights of the Century and Big Fights inc. He and Cayton rescued and restored rare films of such fighters as Bob Fitzsimmons, Jack Johnson, Jack Dempsey and James J. Corbett, which might otherwise have been lost forever. In 1974, they purchased the Madison Square Garden fight archive. The result was that between them they amassed the world's largest collection of fight films (between 16,000 and 26,000), dating from the 1890s through to the present day. In 1998 Cayton sold the collection to ESPN for a reported $100 million. They also made over 1000 boxing documentaries and productions, including a.k.a. Cassius Clay, Jack Johnson, The Heavyweight Champions and Legendary Champions; the latter three were nominated for Academy Awards. In 1978 Jacobs and Cayton bought the management contract of world light-welterweight champion Wilfred Ben√≠tez from Benitez' father for $75,000 and guided him to two more championships and over $6.5 million in purses. The partnership ended in December 1983, when Benitez bought out his contract in order to manage himself. In 1984 they signed the 18-year- old Mike Tyson, who was being trained by Jacobs' old friend D'Amato, and oversaw his rise to become undisputed world heavyweight champion; Jacobs became a close friend and mentor of Tyson. They also managed Edwin Rosario, who became a three time world lightweight champion, and 1970s middleweight contender Eugene Hart. Jacobs was named Manager of the Year by the Boxing Writers Association of America in 1986. Comics Jacobs also acquired an extensive collection of comic books, having read them since his youth. His collection was thought to contain between 500,000 and 880,000 comics, and had to be stored in a warehouse. Jacobs owned six copies of a rare Detective Comics issue from 1938, worth $10,000 each at the time of his death. Larry Merchant, who knew Jacobs very well, characterized him as such: Death and Halls of Fame Jacobs died of leukemia in 1988. He is an inductee of the International Boxing Hall of Fame, the World Boxing Hall of Fame, the International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame and the US Handball Hall of Fame. In 1990 he was inducted into the Southern California Jewish Sports Hall of Fame. He posthumously appeared in the boxing documentaries When We Were Kings and Tyson in archive footage.

The song is included on the 1990 boxset Lennon. Lyrics & music The song's lyrics have Lennon apologising to wife Yoko Ono. Aisumasen is a slightly corrupted version of the formal term ai sumimasen, which means \\"I'm sorry\\" in Japanese. The line \\"It's hard enough I know to feel your own pain\\" reprises a theme found in a line from Lennon's earlier song \\"I Found Out.\\" After the lyrics run out, a guitar solo is played. Authors Ken Bielen and Ben Urish interpret this solo as a continuation of the plea for forgiveness. The solo ends abruptly, which Bielen and Urish suggest that this abrupt ending symbolically means that Lennon's plea has been rejected. And in fact, by the time \\"Aisumasen (I'm Sorry)\\" was released, Lennon and Ono had separated. Author John Blaney agrees that the song implies that Lennon will not get the forgiveness and comfort he needs from Ono, and further states that the song reveals just how much he needed her. \\"Aisumasen (I'm Sorry)\\" has some similarities to the Beatles song \\"I Want You (She's So Heavy),\\" which was also written by Lennon and inspired by Ono. Bielen and Urish claim that \\"Aisumasen (I'm Sorry)\\" has a similar rhythm to \\"a slowed down, semi-acoustic version\\" of \\"I Want You (She's So Heavy).\\" \\"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\\" also ends abruptly. Lennon had been working on the melody to \\"Aisumasen (I'm Sorry)\\" since at least 1971. A demo of the song was recorded during sessions for Lennon's Imagine. Originally, the melody belonged to song whose working title was \\"Call My Name.\\", dating from a demo recorded in December 1971. In \\"Call My Name,\\" Lennon was offering to comfort someone, but in the final version of the song Lennon is the one asking for forgiveness. In \\"Call My Name,\\" the melodic line that became \\"Aisumasen\\" was sung to the words \\"I'll ease your pain.\\" Reception Music critic Johnny Rogan finds the song to be \\"occasionally powerful\\" and feels it \\"brings some depth\\" to the Mind Games album. Keith Spore of The Milwaukee Sentinel called the song \\"a lovely ballad\\" which serves as a reminder of Lennon's past brilliance. Bielen and Urish consider it to be one of Mind Games strongest songs, although they think it may have been even stronger had Lennon stuck to his original lyrical impulses of \\"Call My Name.\\" PopMatters feels that the song starts out well, \\"like classic Lennon blues,\\" but that Lennon \\"never finds the conviction to carry the song across the finish line.\\" Personnel The musicians who performed on the original recording were as follows: *John Lennon ‚Äì vocals, acoustic guitar *David Spinozza ‚Äì guitar *Pete Kleinow ‚Äì pedal steel guitar *Ken Ascher ‚Äì keyboards *Gordon Edwards ‚Äì bass guitar *Jim Keltner ‚Äì drums References External links * Category:John Lennon songs Category:Songs written by John Lennon Category:1973 songs Category:Song recordings produced by John Lennon Category:1970s ballads Category:Songs about Yoko Ono Category:Rock ballads ","title":"Aisumasen (I'm Sorry)"},{"id":"33000410","text":"The Mikado is a 1939 British musical comedy film based on Gilbert and Sullivan's 1885 comic opera The Mikado.

Interior of the basilica, destroyed in 2016 The Monastero di San Benedetto in Monte (English: Monastery of St. Benedict on the Mountain) is a male Benedictine community located in southeastern Umbria, just outside the city of Norcia, Italy. The monks exclusively use the Extraordinary Form of the Roman Rite as well as the traditional form of the Divine Office. They have become well known for their production of beer, the sale of which provides income for the monastery, as well as for their best-selling album of Gregorian chant. Until 2016, the monks were the custodians of the Basilica of San Benedetto in the center of Norcia, built above the birthplace of Saint Benedict of Nursia and Saint Scholastica. The Basilica and Monastery were destroyed in October 2016 in an earthquake which damaged much of Norcia and the surrounding area. As a result, the monks relocated to an abandoned Capuchin monastery and church located on a hillside 1.6 miles (2.6 km) west of the center of Norcia, where they have constructed temporary accommodations and are constructing a larger, permanent monastery. History In the 8th century an oratory was built in Norcia so pilgrims could pray at the place of St. Benedict's birth. Monks came to Norcia in the 10th century, and remained in one form or another until 1810, when the Napoleonic Code forced the closure of the monastery. The current Benedictine community was founded in September 1998 by Fr. Cassian Folsom, an American monk of St. Meinrad Archabbey in Indiana, who served as its first prior. He and two other monks began the community in Rome, before moving to Norcia in December 2000 at the invitation of the Archbishop of Spoleto-Norcia. They were charged to care for the Basilica of San Benedetto and for the many visiting pilgrims, and the community grew steadily over the years. In February 2012 the Monastery was canonically established as a priory under the supervision of the Abbot Primate of the Benedictine Confederation. In October 2016 a 6.6 magnitude earthquake destroyed the 14th-century basilica as well as most of the monastery./ Although none of the monks were injured, they, like thousands of others throughout Umbria, were left homeless. As a result, the monks moved outside the city to an abandoned monastery that was once part of a Capuchin friary, and later was used as the seminary of the Diocese of Norcia. It was abandoned in the mid-20th century after the Diocese of Norcia was merged with that of nearby Spoleto. The monks had originally purchased the badly dilapidated church with the hopes of turning it into a monastic grange. In November 2016, Fr. Cassian announced that he was stepping down as prior, saying that he lacked the energy necessary to head the community in the process of rebuilding. Fr. Benedict Nivakoff, an American who had previously served as subprior and novice master, became the new prior. Since 2016 the monks have constructed several temporary structures on their new site, including a chapel, cells, refectory and library, and are currently building a larger permanent structure. As of January 2020, there are 17 monks in the community. Charism and daily life The monks' life of conversion is rooted in the traditional praying of the Divine Office seven times during the day and once during the night. The monks chant the full Office in Latin and offer the Holy Mass each day in the traditional form of the Roman Rite. The monks dedicate their prayers to those who have asked them for intercession, Church and world. The monks have shared their chants in many ways since the founding of their community, most notably in the release of a Billboard-topping album in 2015. Benedicta, the monks‚Äô CD of Marian chants. Following the Rule of St. Benedict, the monks‚Äô schedule of prayers follows the patterns of the sun, and therefore changes slightly throughout the year as the days wax and wane. In accordance with Benedictine tradition, the monks regularly host visitors who come either for a retreat or to discern a vocation. The guests are welcome to join the monks in all their prayers, and may, if they wish, work with the monks during the day. Coat of arms The monastery's coat of arms The coat of arms of the monastery is divided into two sections. On the left hand side is the symbol of the Celestine monks who were present in Norcia before being suppressed by the Napoleonic laws of 1810, representing the continuity with the past. The Celestines were an ascetic branch of the Benedictines that became defunct at around the time of the Napoleonic code. The right side of the seal represents the present: a stump with new shoots of life growing from it. The stump represents monastic life violently cut off in 1810. The new shoots of life represent the present community, and the three leaves represents the three original monks who arrived in Norcia in 2000. As the prophet Isaiah says: \\"There shall come forth a shoot from the stump of Jesse, and a branch shall grow out of his roots\\" (Isaiah 11:1). This image has always been a sign of hope. In 2019, after breaking ground and beginning to raise the walls of their new home, the monks added a motto to the monastery‚Äôs crest: Nova Facio Omnia. Taken from the Book of the Apocalypse, it describes the New Jerusalem in all its splendor and underlines what Christ does for all who cooperate with His plan: ‚ÄúBehold, I make all things new!‚Äù  Birra Nursia  Early in 2012 the Monks of Norcia established a brewery in a renovated warehouse. They hosted a grand opening celebration on August 15, 2012 - the Solemnity of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary.Birra Nursia Website . The name of the beer is ‚ÄúBirra Nursia‚Äù, using the Latin name for the city of Norcia and the motto of the brewery ‚Äúut laetificet cor‚Äù (that the heart might be gladdened). The monks explain this motto as follows: As of 2020, the monks produce two varieties of beer: Extra, a Belgian-style dark ale, and Bionda, a blonde ale. Norcia is famous for many food products, including truffles, wild boar, salumi, and cheeses. The monks designed their beer to pair with such local delicacies. Many of the shops, hotels, and restaurants in town have begun selling Birra Nursia to their customers. As of March 2016, Birra Nursia is also available for purchase in the United States via their website.Birra Nursia Website .

Denison is owned by Parker Hannifin. Denison has annual revenues of about $180 million, has 1,150 employees in North America, Europe and Asia, and approximately 61 percent of its customer base is in Europe. History Denison Hydraulics Inc., originally known as the Cook Motor Co., was founded in 1900 in Delaware, Ohio, as a manufacturer of heavy duty industrial gasoline engines. The main problem was that they were big, heavy, and only single-cylinder. For example, a typical 50 hp engine weighed 3 tons. After World War I, Mr. Cook wanted to retire. Bill Denison took over just as the engine market was dying. He continued to operate under the original Cook Motor Co. name. In 1925, Mr. Denison invented a hydraulic car pusher. It was designed to slowly move cars full of clay-ware through a kiln - decidedly the newest invention of the day owning over 80% of the hydraulic market. It was the first hydraulic machine. Shortly after getting the new car pusher developed, there was a business recession. The new art of hydraulics pulled them through. The name HydrOILic was then used to identify this new method of power transmission. Cook Motor Company went into receivership. Bill Denison was able to reorganize the company as the Denison Engineering Company. The company survived the Depression, although just barely. One of the early products included the Billet Pusher and the \\"Compact\\" Power Unit. In 1933, a fire destroyed the plant in Delaware. The Budd-Ranney Company had property at the corner of Chestnut and Marconi Blvd. Denison operated under contract with Budd-Ranney Engineering until 1935. Denison then acquired Budd-Ranney - which was maintained for a while as a separate subsidiary. Prior to World War II, Denison was contacted to help with developing test stands and presses to assist in making weapons and aircraft. Presses increased production of airplane engine crankshafts by four times. Presses also permitted \\"safer\\" manufacturing of high explosive shells. During the war years, Bill Denison bought facilities throughout Columbus and a research center in Powell, Ohio. One of the properties Denison purchased was a property on Dublin Road which would provide for special military needs. Aircraft test stands permitted testing complete hydraulic systems while on the ground and testing hydraulic operated fuel transfer valves for airplanes. Special vacuum chambers tested spark plugs and magnetos. Denison had to get with the times. An Engineering division was developed after World War II. In addition to the Multipress, another division was responsible for the manufacture of hydraulic components for the general industry. A separate division was dedicated only to Research and Development. Ideas that were discussed during the \\"War Years\\", but shelved, due to lack of time and manpower, now came \\"off the shelf\\". Additional controls for the Multipress and many new products for the hydraulic industry were developed. In fact, Denison salesmen had to teach their customers about the merits of hydraulics. In 1945, a new line of high speed, lightweight aircraft pumps were introduced and in 1954, Denison, in cooperation with the U.S. Government, purchased a factory at 425 Sandusky St., Delaware, Ohio. In addition to other products, the intent was to manufacture aircraft pumps. In 1955, Bill Denison sold his business to American Brake Shoe. He remained president and resided on the Board of Directors. 1956 the aircraft pumps are moved to Rochester, New York and later Oxnard, California. Finally, in April 1962, the business moved to Marysville, OH. In July 1962, Denison took shape and began to build its present-day factory, building all types of hydraulic pumps. In October 1962, the manufacturing facility in Marysville was completed. Still operating as American Brake Shoe, the facility was initially used for manufacturing piston pumps and providing special products for the government. The Multipress group soon moved in as well. In 1966, American Brake Shoe changed their name and identity to ABEX. In 1968 ABEX merged with Illinois Central Railroad to become IC Industries. Throughout the ABEX and IC years, Denison continued to be a leader in the development of high-performance fluid power products. American Brake Shoe in Mahwah, New Jersey at or around the time it changed its name to ABEX was working on a 48-track Route Switching System (Hump Yard) for I believe the Santa Fe Railroad. Two versions of the switching unit were created, one in Mahwah and one in Chicago. The Chicago version was a fully transistorized unit that fit on a tabletop; the Mahwah version used stepping relays, dozens of each. Two engineers and one engineering technician {William (Bill) C. McElroy jr} did the design and build of the walk-in closet sized seven foot tall unit. The railroad 'bosses' looked at both designs and decided that rather than retrain their personnel to understand transistors, they would rather keep with the relays and thus, purchased our version. There was one minor problem, they wanted the relay closet to be 'portable', and thus we welded a six-inch eye hook to the top of the cabinet housing. That was the day I understood that our nation's railroads were in deep trouble.William (Bill) C. McElroy jr, project engineering technician Denison, became especially heavily involved with Marine and defense applications providing steering gears and many other products to the US Navy. In 1986, ABEX/IC sold the Denison division to a Swedish manufacturer of Radial Piston Hydraulic Motors, Hagglunds. As business slowed during the recession of the 1980s, Hagglunds Denison was forced to close and sell several factories. Burgess Hill, England: Delaware, Ohio: and Columbus, Ohio. Marysville then became the Corporate Headquarters but was also subject to severe cutbacks. Denison split into two groups in 1991: Hagglunds Drives and Hagglunds Denison. In 1993, Hagglunds sold the Denison portion to three private investors. Hagglunds remained a customer of Denison, but no longer retained ownership in the company. The company name was then changed to the current Denison Hydraulics Inc.http://www.denisonhydraulics.com/history In October 2003, Parker Hannifin acquired Denison International for $240 million.https://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/09/business/company-news-parker- hannifin-to-buy-denison-international.html Denison Engineering Based on Bill Denison's hydraulics expertise‚Äîthe Denison company was to go on to produce more than 600 patents during the twentieth century.http://www.referenceforbusiness.com/history2/35/Denison-International- plc.html The most prominent engineer was Ellis Born, (October 11, 1919 - Monday, March 19, 2007http://www.tributes.com/show/79992714) graduated in 1941 from the Ohio State University with a Bachelor of Science in mechanical engineering.

It is dedicated to the manufacturer's Platform 1 cars, which are cars in the subcompact class, with an annual output of approximately 200,000 cars. In 2010 the plant produced the Peugeot 207, the Peugeot 207 SW and the Citro√´n DS3. Together with the PSA Research Centres at Carri√®res-sous- Poissy and at V√©lizy, it is one of three major establishments that PSA runs in the department. The Poissy plant was commissioned by Ford France in 1937 and opened in 1940 a few weeks before the German invasion. When, in 1954, Ford sold their business to Simca, the Poissy plant was naturally included in the deal, and less than ten years later Simca closed their existing plant at Nanterre, leaving Poissy as their only significant auto-production facility. Ownership passed again in 1963, this time to Chrysler who in that year acquired a controlling interest in Simca. Then in 1978 Peugeot acquired Chrysler's European business. Former Simca models were rebadged as Talbots and continued to be produced at the Poissy plant during the early 1980s. However, the mid-range hatchback that had been designed to sustain the Talbot brand was rebadged ahead of its 1985 launch as the Peugeot 309. That is the name under which it was sold, and since that time the plant has concentrated on the production of small Citroen and Peugeot badged models. In October 2010 the plant had 6,535 registered employees. History The construction of the Poissy plant was the project of Maurice Dollfus, Ford's dynamic boss in France. In 1932 governments had responded to economic contraction by raising tariff barriers and Ford had responded to the need to source vehicles locally by entering into an agreement, in 1934, with the Strasbourg-based Mathis company to produce Ford-designed cars, which would be branded as Matfords, in an extended Strasbourg plant. Ford brought cash to the deal and a fractious partnership ensued, Mathis having found themselves obliged to abandon production of their own cars in October 1934. For Dollfus the Poissy plant, commissioned in 1938, would provide a route away from the by now bitterly litigious Matford relationship. Construction began on a large 240,000 m2 site bordering the River Seine in Poissy at the start of November 1938 and progressed remarkably rapidly, with the plant formally completed on 1 May 1940. Located a short distance downstream from Paris along the (here fully navigable) River Seine, Poissy was near to Asni√®res, which was home to Chausson, at that time a car body producer and principal supplier to Ford France. The site was also adjacent to the main railway line connecting Paris with Le Havre. British propaganda showing the bombing of the Ford plant in 1942. The principal product to be produced at Poissy was to be closely based on the Matford ‚ÄúAlsace‚Äù V8, itself a version of the existing US 3622 cc Ford Model 48 but with a restyled rear. The overall silhouette of the car closely resembled that of the Ford Pilot which was produced for a few years by Ford of Britain from 1947. The other car to be built at Poissy was the Matford Alsace V8 13CV, which had a smaller 2158 cc engine. It looked virtually identical to the larger engined car, though was actually slightly shorter. These cars had started life in 1935 as products of the Matford joint venture, but the cars produced at Ford's new Poissy plant would presumably have been badged as Fords. The plant became operational in the late Spring of 1940 and there was therefore very little time in which to produce anything before the d√©bacle of May 1940. On 14 June 1940 Poissy was occupied by the German Army: under conditions of occupation the plant concentrated on light trucks. As the war dragged on there was a move, in 1943, to crate up Ford's newly completed Poissy plant for shipment to the company's Cologne location, but this was blocked, apparently due to the intervention of a recently resigned but still influential former Vichy government minister called Fran√ßois Lehideux. Seven years later, in 1950, Lehideux replaced Maurice Dollfus at the top of Ford's French operation. Matford F917WS (ca 1942) Poissy was liberated by the Americans on 26 August 1944 after several days of bombardment and civilian casualties, notably on 18 August. Ford's boss, Maurice Dollfus was promptly arrested on suspicion of collaboration and transferred to Drancy. However, his release came quite quickly and the plant switched to supporting the allied war effort. Initially the government mandated Poissy to produce the light trucks that it had been produced before the war, and in 1946 production commenced of the Ford F698W 5 ton truck known as the ‚ÄúPoissy‚Äù. Also in 1946, Poissy reverted to producing the smaller engined 2,225 cc V-8 engined Matford based model, albeit with improved suspension and brakes. The car was known in France as the Ford 13CV, although subsequently it is also called more formally the Ford F-472 and, after the first 300 had been produced, the Ford F-472A. The 4,270 cars produced in 1947 were well short of Ford's ambitions for the new plant ten years earlier, but with basic materials in short supply and customers short of money, in the late 1940s none of the French auto-makers experienced a rapid return to pre-war volumes. In much of industry, including the auto-industry, the immediate post-war years were characterised by industrial unrest, and Ford's Poissy plant was badly affected. Nevertheless, in October 1948 the North American designed Ford Vedette, still powered by the company's familiar V8 2158cc engine, made its first appearance at a Paris Motor Show: this quickly became Poissy's principal model and during the early 1950s it certainly sold better than the aged Ford F-472A had. Nevertheless, Fran√ßois Lehideux who took over from Maurice Dollfus in January 1950 was known to be dissatisfied with aspects of the new car. Sales volumes were disappointing, and although the engine was produced in-house and final assembly took place at the Poissy plant, other components and sub-assemblies were bought in which was believed to make production vulnerable to supplier problems. Scope for improvement was limited by shortage of investment cash and the limited market for cars with engines above 2 litre in size in a country where the tax regime heavily penalised larger engines. Nevertheless, a new V8 model for Ford of France was pencilled in for 1954. Ford Vedette (1952) In the late 1940s politics in Europe remained highly polarised and Henry Ford will have been aware of the continuing popularity of the French Communist Party, routinely winning 25% of the votes in national elections till the mid-1950s, buoyed both by the delicate state of the French economy and by the prominent role played by communists in the French Resistance. The strikes that afflicted Ford's Poissy plant, and the poor industrial relations tradition of Renault‚Äôs plant at nearby Boulogne-Billancourt will have done nothing to reassure Ford about the future direction of the French economy, and it became known that Ford were looking to sell their French manufacturing business, of which the Poissy plant was the principal fixed asset. Henri Pigozzi, the Turin born boss of Simca must have taken a more positive view of the outlook for the French auto-industry, and in 1954 Ford sold their French manufacturing business to Simca along with rights to the new model that it was about to launch. Poissy's new model would be sold with a wide range of names, and in many export markets it would be badged as a Ford during its first few years, but in retrospect it is remembered as the Simca Vedette. In France it came with a Simca badge from the start. The Simca acquisition triggered a major expansion at the Poissy site. During 1955 new factory buildings were constructed so that by the end of the year, finally, more than half of the site had been built on. Simca Vedette (1956) During the early 1950s the economy finally started to grow again and the Simca Vedette made a strong start, with 42,439 produced in 1955 and 44,836 in 1956. These figures probably fell well short of the expectations when the site was acquired in 1937, but it was still a fourteenfold increase over the 3,023 cars produced in 1947. Unfortunately the Suez Crisis struck at the end of 1956, and the resulting fuel shortages placed the emphasis back on very small cars. Sales of the V8 Simcas recovered a little by the end of the decade, but production volumes of never again approached those of 1956. Simca responded rapidly by adding to their range the Simca Ariane which was a big car with a small engine, also produced in Poissy, which during the ensuing six years clocked up over 160,0000 sales. However, by now the large car market in France was increasingly dominated by the Citroen DS which was in a lower car tax bracket than the V8 Simcas and had, after slow start, caught the spirit of the new age. Simca 1000 (1961). The Simca 1000 was the first Poissy product to exceed the million units threshold. By 1961 it was not lack of customer demand that was squeezing Vedette production, but Simca's own preparations for a return to small car production. Poissy's large site had always been underutilised, and the Simca 1000 was intended to make far better use of Poissy's potential capacity than either Ford or Simca had hitherto achieved. With more than 100,000 Simca 1000s produced every year from 1962 to 1973, Simca succeeded in this. Nevertheless, there would still be capacity to spare at Poissy, and in 1961 Simca sold the plant at Nanterre which they had occupied since 1934. After this Poissy was Simca's only large scale production facility in France. As part of the deal by which the Ford business had been sold to Simca in 1954, Ford had acquired a 15% stake in Simca. However, the Ford shares were sold to Chrysler in 1958. The Chrysler stake in Simca was increased and became a controlling one in 1963. Between 1963 and 1978 Poissy was owned by Chrysler, and Chrysler's pentastar emblem started to appear on the cars produced there, replacing Simca's ‚Äúdove‚Äù emblem. The Simca name would nonetheless remain on French market cars, such as the Simca 1307 launched in 1975, for several more years, even after exported cars came only with Chrysler badges. Peugeot 309 (1985). The car was designed for launch as the \\"Talbot Arizona\\", but the last minute decision to rebrand it as a Peugeot marked a retreat from Peugeot's stated intentions to retain Talbot as a separate brand. Late in the 1970s Chrysler withdrew from Europe in response to financial pressures on the parent company, and on 10 August 1978 the entire business was sold to PSA Peugeot Citro√´n. Poissy continued for the time being to produce the cars designed as Simcas, but these were now rebadged as Talbots. The Simca brand disappeared in 1980, although Peugeot continues to own the name. It appeared at the time that Peugeot intended to produce three ranges, Peugeot, Citro√´n and Talbot, in parallel, maximising commonality for the components that few customers studied while maximising the differences in terms of body design and interior fittings. However, the reintroduced Talbot brand had not, in its 1980s incarnation, had time to generate huge amounts of brand loyalty, and the next new model from Poissy, scheduled to replace the Talbot Horizon, was first postponed and then turned up in 1985 badged as the Peugeot 309 - with Poissy producing left-hand drive models and the former Rootes Group factory near Coventry producing the right-hand drive versions. This followed Peugeot's decision to discontinue the Talbot brand on passenger cars, although it survived until 1994 on commercial vehicles. 1986 saw Poissy produce its last Talbot badged car, and the plant's next significant new model was Peugeot‚Äôs mainstream small family car, the Peugeot 306, which went into production there at the end of 1992 in left-hand drive form, with Ryton once again producing the right-hand drive versions. Between 1992 and 2002 the Peugeot 306 was Poissy‚Äôs top product, and the plant manufactured 1,685,470 of them. From 2002 the emphasis switched to the company‚Äôs ‚ÄúPlatform 1‚Äù small cars, the Peugeots 206 and 207 along with their Citro√´n bodied counterparts such as the Citro√´n C3. The plant has also become a major supplier of parts and sub-assemblies to other PSA group plants, and has grown to a point where it has an annual production capacity of 400,000 cars. The 206 was also produced at Ryton until Peugeot closed the plant down in December 2006, switching production to Slovakia before it was finally discontinued in 2010.

They were not a success and only one of each was built. Design and development The 60 T (T for transport) was the result of a decision made in May 1929 to turn a current military transport project into a civil, passenger carrying aircraft. The resulting design also owed much to the earlier, single engine Bernard 190 civil transport, though the 60 T had three engines and a greater span. Even though it retained only the wing from the military design, construction began on 11 June and was completed on 20 August. The Bernard 60 was an all wood aircraft. Like the Barnard 190, it was a high wing cantilever monoplane. In plan the thick wing was straight tapered with rounded tips. The fuselage was flat sided with a curved underside. The crew's enclosed cabin was just ahead of the wing leading edge and the long passenger compartment, with twelve seats in all and five windows on each side, was lower down beneath the wings. Despite the rapid build, the accommodation was heated, ventilated and sound- proofed; entry was via a port side door which included the rearmost window. The sound proofing was assisted by silencers on the engines. The empennage of the Bernard 60 was conventional with a rounded fin and rudder and a tailplane with a swept leading edge mounted on top of the fuselage. It had a split axle undercarriage with single mainwheels mounted on V-form struts from the lower fuselage longerons and landing loads taken by vertical struts to the wing just inboard of the engines, combined with a tailskid. The trimotor Bernard 60 was unusual in having different engines in the nose and on the wings. The central engine was a nine-cylinder, Gnome-Rh√¥ne 9Ady Jupiter, with five cylinder, Gnome-Rh√¥ne 5Bc Titan engines on the wings. The designers would have preferred about 225 kW (300 hp) from each of three identical engines but early in 1929 there were no available homologated types of this power. The Bernard 60 flew for the first time at the end of August 1929, piloted by Antoine Paillard. Tests revealed a serious problem due to the mixture of engine powers: the Bernard 60 could fly satisfactorily with one wing motor shut down but could not reach the altitude of required for certification on the power of the two wing motors alone. So in October 1930 Bernard proposed to install three seven cylinder, Gnome-Rh√¥ne 7Kdrs Titan-Major engines. It first flew in this form in July 1931 but was seriously damaged in a night landing on 22 December 1931 and did not fly again, being scrapped in 1934. It was succeeded by the Bernard 61 T, similar but with a metal fuselage. The wing was unchanged, weights up by about and maximum speed and ceiling increased by and respectively. It was powered by three Gnome-Rh√¥ne 7Kb Titan-Major engines with the same output as those used on the 60. The 61 T flew for the first time on 28 March 1933, piloted by Jean-Charles Bernache-Assollant. Operational history The 60 T never received certification but the 61 T was approved after tests by the STA√© in July 1933. It was registered as F-AKBY; the 60 T had flown with the same letters. In May 1934 Georges Barbot tested the performance of the 61 T, now technically dated and always with poor handling characteristics and not of interest to the recently formed Air-France. It was modified again in September 1934 and delivered to CEMA in October, making its last flight the following February.

Its aim was to supply free reading material and reading rooms to the people of New York City. Over its lifetime, it expanded from a single location to eleven locations and an additional traveling department. It was notable for the large part women played in its administration and staffing. In 1901, the system became part of the New York Public Library. Origins During the 1870s and 1880s, the need for an adequate system of home circulation of books was frequently mentioned in New York City papers and government. Most discussions of such a system never got beyond the talking stage, but they were an indication of public appreciation of the need. Early in 1879, six girls belonging to a sewing class at New York City's Grace Church were waiting for their teacher, and whiled away the time by listening to a sensational story read from a cheap paper by one of their number. The story was overheard by the teacher on her arrival, and she was thus led to inquire regarding the children's reading material, and to make efforts to improve it. The paper was gladly given up in exchange for a book, and each of the girls was offered one such book a week as a loan, on condition that she would never again buy a sensational story paper. Other women became interested, about 500 books were collected, and a room at 13th Street, east of 4th Avenue, was obtained for library use. The facility was advertised by telling the children to bring their friends, and although at first the room was open only once a week for two hours at a time, the attendance was soon so great that the sidewalk was blocked during the library hours, and on one occasion only two volumes were left in the room. At the end of the first year about 1,200 volumes, all gifts, were on the shelves, and about 7,000 had been given out to the public. According to the Evening Post for March 18, 1880, patrons included children and men of 60 or 70 years of age, and their dwellings were scattered widely across the city. After wider consultations, and some study of library conditions both in New York and in other large cities, the conclusion was reached that the special needs of the city at this time would be met by the establishment of a library for the circulation of books among the very poor. First incorporation With this aim in view, a certificate of incorporation was filed in March 1880. The incorporators named in the certificate were Benjamin H. Field, Philip Schuyler, William W. Appleton, Julia G. Blagden, and Mary S. Kernochan. The object of the society was stated to be the furnishing of ‚Äúfree reading to the people of the City of New York by the Establishment (in one or more places, in the City of New York,) of a Library or Libraries with or without Reading Rooms; which Library or Libraries and Reading Rooms shall be open (without payment) to the public.‚Äù From the room on 13th Street, the library was moved to 36 Bond Street where two rooms were rented in a private house and refitted and furnished as a library. Circulation was begun at this location on March 22, 1880, with 1,837 volumes on the shelves. During April, the first full month, the number of volumes taken for home use amounted to 1,653, and this number grew steadily month by month, that for October being 4,212 volumes. Card holders numbered 712 on March 22, and reached 2,751 on November 1. Of the 22,558 volumes circulated between March and November, 71% were fiction and juveniles; 18% history, biography, and travel; 3% foreign books; 4% science; and 4% poetry, religion, periodicals, and essays. The average daily circulation amounted to about 200 volumes. In this same period, volumes on the shelves increased from 1,837 to 3,674, the increase consisting of 271 purchases and 1,566 gifts. The gifts included a large amount of material deemed useless, and the library committee concluded that it was ‚Äúimpossible to secure the best and most desirable books from the donations of private households. . . . Of the 3,674 volumes on our shelves, fully one-third are of such a character as to be rarely, if ever, called for.‚Äù The committee thought what was needed were ‚Äústandard works of fiction, popular and reliable books of travel and history, particularly those relating to our own country, and, above all, the better class of books for boys and girls.‚Äù A reading room was opened on June 1, from 4 to 9 p.m. (Sundays included), and appreciation of this service was shown by the number of 1,988 readers, to whom 2,361 periodicals were issued. A card catalog of the library was made for official use and copied for the public. In May the librarian wrote a catalog of the books then on the shelves, about 2,500 volumes, and from this twelve copies were run off by the ‚Äúchierograph.‚Äù In September a printed catalog of the thousand volumes added during the summer was issued in an edition of 200 copies. In the Library Journal for January 1881, Charles A. Cutter characterized the first report of the library committee as ‚Äúin some respects the most important that we have ever received. It marks the inception of a movement. The penetration of the free-library idea into a city of the magnitude of New York, is a very important step in its progress. . . . A New Englander or a Westerner from any of the larger cities who goes to New York to live, feels at once that there is something wanting, and says so. The press, too, both daily, weekly, and monthly, is awake to the need -- we might also say to the disgrace.‚Äù He expressed the hope that resources would increase beyond those ‚Äúsuitable to a small country town.‚Äù Once established, growth in use and circulation was limited only by growth of stock of books, and this in turn only by fiscal resources. The subsequent history of the institution was a record of efforts towards a larger income and administrative development. A public statement of work done and an appeal for subscriptions were made by a meeting held in the hall of the Union League Club on January 20, 1882, attended by some 350 persons. Mayor William R. Grace presided, and addresses were made by John Hall, Joseph H. Choate, Henry C. Potter, and George William Curtis. On February 4, 8, and 11 following, Edward A. Freeman, then in the country on a lecture tour, gave a series of lectures on ‚ÄúThe English People in their Three Homes,‚Äù in Chickering Hall on behalf of the library. By means of these meetings and by individual solicitation the treasurer was able to report at the annual meeting in November 1882 that the permanent fund amounted to some $34,000. This fund enabled the trustees to purchase premises at 49 Bond Street on June 9, 1882, and to fit it up for library purposes at a cost of $15,500 for the lot and $13,774.92 for aherations. The books were removed from the rented quarters at 36 Bond Street on May 1, 1883, a change welcomed by readers no less than by librarians, appreciation being shown by a growth in circulation from the 69,280 volumes reported in the first full year of operation (November 1880 - October 1881), to 81,233 volumes in 1882-83. An interesting tribute to the part taken by women in the establishment of the library and in its administration came in shape of a letter from the board of managers of the Female Christian Home on April 17, 1882, enclosing a check for $1,700 (subsequently increased to $2,000 by additional contributions) representing the balance of the funds of the Home after settling its affairs. This donation was made with request that the ‚Äúamount be kept as a fund to be called the ‚ÄòWomen's Fund,‚Äô and that the income from it shall be used for the employment of women in the Free Library or for the purchase of books.‚Äù The Ottendorfer Branch, 1884, the first branch designed and built for library purposes Second incorporation and an added location The limitations expressed in the terms of the original incorporation eventually rendered the possibilities of growth and effective work too small. To overcome this difficulty, ‚ÄúAn Act to incorporate the New York Free Circulating Library‚Äù was passed by the state legislature at Albany on April 18, 1884. The first fruit of this new freedom from restriction as to its property holdings came to the library in shape of a letter dated May 12, 1884, from Oswald Ottendorfer, editor of the New Yorker Staats-Zeitung. Ottendorfer wished to give the NYFCL a branch library at 135 2nd Avenue (near 8th Street) with about 8,000 volumes, half of which were in the German language, the others in the English language. The location was to be leased by the German Hospital and Dispensary to the NYFCL. The gift included $10,000 in 7% railroad bonds and furnishings for the branch, which was to include a reading room. An accompanying condition was that the reading material in German be maintained sufficiently, and German- speaking staff be in attendance. A fire-proof vault was provided in the basement for preserving valuable documents and books of the library, and for the preservation of the records and papers of importance of interested German societies. This gift and its terms were accepted by the trustees on May 16, 1884, and the same day a lease was executed. Lower 2nd Avenue at that time was the center of a community composed largely of German-speaking people. The Ottendorfer Branch -- so named by the trustees in their minute accepting the gift on May 16 -- was opened for circulation on December 8, 1884, with 8,819 volumes on its shelves, of which 4,035 were German and 4,784 were English. Maturity =Funding= The NYFCL had now passed beyond its experimental stage. The need for its existence was patent to the most superficial observer. That the library -- limited only by its monetary resources -- had the organization and the machinery for supplying this need was made plain by the success of its two locations. Support for the library from the taxpayers' money was certain to come eventually, in part at least. Until it came, however, money for current expenses and for extension of the work had to be found in contributions from people of means, and few of this class had personal knowledge of the field or of the need. Once interested, though, few lost interest or failed in their annual contributions. Meetings, public and private, were held, at which the needs and opportunities of the work were presented by men of standing and influence in the community. A meeting of May 2, 1885, was presided over by J. F. Kernochan and addresses were made by Andrew Carnegie and William Woodward, Jr. On Washington's birthday, 1886, Levi P. Morton presided over a meeting held in Steinway Hall and Henry E. Howland, Chauncey M. Depew, and Frederic R. Coudert spoke. In 1890, Benjamin H. Field, president of the board of trustees, presided over a gathering in Chickering Hall on March 6, at which Howland spoke again, and moving appeals were made by ex-President Cleveland, Seth Low, Joseph H. Choate, and Andrew Carnegie. The last of these public meetings in behalf of the library was held in Chickering Hall in 1896, when Mayor Strong presided and addresses were made by Judge Howland, Carnegie, John Lambert Cadwalader, and Bourke Cockran. Besides appeals made in this fashion, personal letters were addressed to members of various professions setting forth the needs of the library, the work it was doing, and asking support at least in shape of membership contributions. In 1886 circulars were sent to members of the stock exchange, the railroad service, and the dry-goods trade, each signed by half a dozen of the leading men in each of the businesses mentioned. Lawyers and physicians, members of the cotton and other exchanges, the book trade, uptown retail merchants, and other professions and occupations as widely different as the above named were also called upon. In 1896 the number of such letters sent out was reported as 950, in 1897 as 5,000. The first step towards public funding came in the passage at Albany on July 15, 1886, of ‚ÄúAn Act to encourage the growth of free public libraries and free circulating libraries in the cities of the State.‚Äù The encouragement consisted in the grant of permission to local authorities to aid free circulating libraries by annual appropriation of funds bearing some ratio to their volumes circulated. From 1887 to 1900, appropriations to the NYFCL made by New York City in accordance with this act totaled $417,250. For seven years, operating funds from private sources and from the City appropriation were about equal, and for the last seven years the City appropriation was several times larger than the income from donations or investments. The City money depended to a certain extent on the volume of circulation -- the maximum permissible by statute being ten cents per volume circulated. =Character of reading material= The library committee continued the initial interest in the character of reading material made available, stating in its report for 1886/7 that it was ‚Äúattempting to improve the character of the reading, or at least to retain the present high standard for a library of this class‚Äù and ‚Äútherefore refrained from the purchase of many books of an ephemeral or trivial nature, and have not duplicated books of fiction in which the interest might be considered transitory.‚Äù =Growth of branches= The Bond Street Branch and the Ottendorfer Branch constituted the plant of the NYFCL for nearly three years. In 1888, the number of branches doubled with the opening of the George Bruce Branch and the Jackson Square Branch. On January 17, 1887, Catherine W. Bruce had given $50,000 for erection and maintenance of a branch to be known as the George Bruce Branch. This branch was erected at 226 West 42nd Street as a memorial to the donor's father, George Bruce, a type founder. Money was set aside as an endowment fund, and by subsequent gifts Catherine Bruce increased the endowment fund for this branch until at the time of consolidation with the NYPL it amounted to $40,000. The building was opened for circulation on January 6, 1888, with about 7,000 volumes on its shelves. The Jackson Square Branch was opened on July 6, 1888, at 251 West 13th Street, the lot, building, and stock of books being the gift of George W. Vanderbilt. The fifth or Harlem Branch developed from the opening on July 7, 1892, of a small distributing station in part of a room at 2059 Lexington Avenue on the corner of 125th Street, between five and six hundred volumes being drawn off from Bond Street and Jackson Square Branches. During the lifetime of the NYFCL it moved from there, to two rooms at 1943 Madison Avenue, to 18 East 125th Street (July 1895) and finally to 218 East 125th Street (May 1899). A sixth branch of the system was opened on February 25, 1893, in the parish house of the Church of the Holy Communion at 49 West 20th Street, and was named the Muhlenberg Branch in memory of the first rector of the church, William Augustus Muhlenberg (1796-1877). Before taking up his ministry among the poor in 1845, Muhlenberg had been a nationally known educator (college preparatory schools). The seventh branch also found its first outside support from a church. This was the Bloomingdale Branch, opened on June 3, 1896, at 816 Amsterdam Avenue. In 1898, the Bloomingdale Branch moved to the first building to be constructed with NYFCL funds. Two new branches and the equivalent of a third were established in 1897. The Riverside Branch opened at 261 West 69th Street on May 26, 1897; the Yorkville Branch opened at 1523 Second Avenue, on the corner of 79th Street, on June 10; and the Traveling Library department was established in April of that year at the George Bruce Branch. The Riverside Branch opened using the books of the Riverside Association, which had been operating as an independent library since 1894. This was the first branch to use an open shelf system. The Yorkville Branch was located in a thickly populated section, Germans and Bohemians forming a large portion of the non-English readers. So great were the demands during its first summer that adequate service could scarcely have been given had not librarians and assistants in other branches voluntarily given their services to support the local staff.

This work had become so extensive by 1897, that it was felt advisable to withdraw the issue for such purposes from the various branches and to concentrate it into a separate department. This was done in April 1897, the librarian of the George Bruce Branch undertaking it in addition to her duties as librarian in charge of that branch. In 1898 it was given a separate staff and was moved to the Ottendorfer Branch. In 1899 it was moved to the Bloomingdale Branch where the third floor was set aside for its needs. The tenth branch building was opened on June 6, 1898, in rented quarters at 215 East 34th Street, in a remodelled dwelling house, where it occupied the whole building except the basement. The circulation room was located on the first floor, the reading room on the second, and the staff room and janitor's quarters on the third floor. The branch opened with 3,710 volumes on its shelves. For the first five months its circulation was 26,645 volumes, and the number of readers 1,045, three fourths of this number being children. The use of the library by children was so marked that a separate room was set aside for them, and the success of the experiment here soon led to the establishment of separate children's rooms -- long desired by every branch -- at Ottendorfer, Bloomingdale, the new Harlem building, and the new Chatham Square Branch. The last branch established by the NYFCL was opened on July 5, 1899, at 22 East Broadway in a remodelled dwelling house just off Chatham Square from which square it took its name. The general circulation room was located on the first floor and the children's room on the second. Each of these two departments had about 3,000 volumes at the time of opening, but of the 46,339 volumes circulated by the branch in the first four months 37,914 were taken out by the children. In memory of her friend Emily E. Binsse, lost in the shipwreck of La Bourgogne in July 1898, Susan Travers gave $1,000 for books for the children's room at Chatham Square and in addition she provided six interesting casts of sculpture. With the increase in branches, circulation increased from 69,000 volumes during the first full year in the two small rooms at 36 Bond Street to 1,600,000 volumes for the eleven branches two decades later. Staffing One of the most noteworthy facts is the part taken in the history of the NYFCL by women. The first president, the first secretary, the first chairman of the committee on ways and means, the first chairman of the building committee, and the first librarian were women. Of the forty trustees that served from 1880 to 1901, nineteen were women. The working staff was almost entirely feminine. The staff was put on a graded basis in March 1897, four classes, A, B, C, and D being formed, ranking downwards from A that for the librarians in charge of branches or departments. Promotion from lower to higher grades was made as result of examinations and of routine work. No formal examinations were required for admission to the staff, their place being taken in large measure by the answers to the questions called for on the application blank signed by the inquirer. To provide a supply of trained assistants for the lower grades, an apprentice class was begun in February 1898. Applicants for positions were required to sign and fill in a blank form on which they gave a statement of their previous training and education and promised to give the library forty- five hours a week in return for the systematic training provided by this class. After a few weeks' preliminary work in instruction the apprentice was sent about from branch to branch, doing her share of the regular work, becoming familiar with local needs and customs, giving each librarian in charge an opportunity to observe her work. When a paid substitute was needed, she was taken from the apprentice class. When a vacancy on the permanent force was filled, the choice fell upon the best fitted apprentice. There was no seniority: the successful applicant sometimes showed her superior fitness by an apprenticeship of two weeks, sometimes service of months was required. A member was at liberty to leave at any time without notice, and one evidently unfitted for the work was so notified as soon as her unfitness was unmistakably evidenced. There were four chief librarians during the 21 years of the life of the NYFCL. The first librarian, Mary J. Stubbs, combined the offices of librarian and housekeeper. With her sister, she lived in the building from March 1, 1880, to May, 1881, when ill health forced her to go home to Maine. She died in the autumn, and her sister served as acting librarian. Late in 1881, Ellen M. Coe was appointed librarian, and she filled the post for about 14 years, resigning in February 1895. Under her administration, five branches were added, and circulation grew from 69,000 to 650,000. On April 1, 1895, Arthur E. Bostwick, was appointed chief librarian. He left on March 8, 1899, and his successor, J. Norris Wing, was appointed April 7. Wing died December 20, 1900, and the position remained vacant until the NYFCL became part of the New York Public Library.

In 1929‚Äì30, Daura joined Michel Seuphor and Torres-Garcia in organizing the group Cercle et Carr√© (Circle and Square), which promoted geometric construction and abstraction in opposition to Surrealism. Cercle et Carr√© included Jean Arp, Wassily Kandinsky, Fernand L√©ger, Piet Mondrian, Antoine Pevsner, Kurt Schwitters, Joseph Stella, Georges Vantongerloo, and others. Daura designed the group's logo, which appeared on stationary, posters, and the three issues of a review; Torres-Garcia also used it later for his C√≠rculo y Cuadrado (a name that also translates as Circle and Square) group in Uruguay. The only Cercle et Carr√© exhibition was held at Gallery 23, in Paris in April 1930.Cercle et Carr√©; Folders 1 and 4, Box 2A, Pierre Daura Exhibitions; Pierre Daura Archive, Georgia Museum of Art, University of Georgia.

In February 1937, at the age of forty-one, Daura joined the Republican militia to fight against General Francisco Franco's forces. He was forward artillery observer and was seriously wounded on the Teruel Front in August 1937. Sent home to France to convalesce, Daura was given a medical discharge.Roanoke Times Article, Dec. 3, 1939; Folder 1, Box 32, Pierre Daura Biography; Pierre Daura Archive, Georgia Museum of Art, University of Georgia. Because he refused to return to Spain after the war, his Spanish citizenship (and Martha's) was revoked by the Franco government, which emerged victorious. Louise became seriously ill, and in early July 1939 the family made an emergency medical trip to Virginia. She recovered, but World War II prevented their return to France. They established permanent residence in Virginia, and Pierre and Martha became naturalized U.S. citizens in 1943. Following the war, the family returned to their home in St. Cirq most summers.Naturalization Certificates for Pierre and Martha; Folder 5, Box 3, Pierre Daura Biography; and Roanoke Times Article, Dec. 3, 1939; Folder 1, Box 3, Pierre Daura Biography; and \\"Louise Daura to Martha F.

In the later years of his life, Daura said, \\"All I have ever wanted to do is to find a way to paint. I have painted. I have worked. I have given myself to my art. That is what I have wanted since my very early age... to be an artist, good or bad... that is what I am.\\"Virginia Irby Davis, A Biography of Catalan-American Artist Pierre Daura, 226. His prolific output of works in many media attest to his lifelong commitment to his art. Although the main body of Daura's work was strongly rooted in representation and the celebration of nature, he returned to abstract themes throughout his life. He is included in standard texts on Spanish and Catalan painting and in 33 Pintors Catalans (Barcelona, 1937, reissued 1976) by the art critic Joan Merli. Before the Spanish Civil War, Daura ambitiously pursued an artistic career. Subsequently, he created for his own satisfaction, fulfilled commissions, and sold works to support his family. He did not sell through commercial galleries after leaving Europe in 1939. Rather, he sold from his home of at exhibitions at academic venues and local art clubs. In the opinion of his daughter, Martha, traumatic experiences in the Spanish Civil War, followed by the tragedies of World War II, changed his outlook; personal fame ceased to be important. His work is now included in many private collections, primarily in Barcelona, France and Virginia. Major collections are also held by some forty-eight museums in France, Spain, and the United States. His papers, including letters to other Cercle et Carr√© artists such as Michel Seuphor are Joaqu√≠n Torres Garc√≠a, are in the Pierre Daura Center at the Georgia Museum of Art. The medieval village where Daura passed so much of his life, St. Cirq-Lapopie, is a French historic monument, as is his former home. The Daura property was donated to the French R√©gion Midi-Pyren√©es in 2002, and is now used as an artists' colony, \\"Les Maisons Daura\\", administered by the Maison des arts Georges Pompidou.

It was first performed in November 1954 at the Kabukiza theatre in Tokyo, and was praised for its \\"refreshing originality\\". Plot The sardine-seller, Sarugenji (ÁåøÊ∫êÊ∞è) has fallen in love with an upper-class courtesan known as \\"Hotarubi\\". However, due to his lowly social position it seems as if he has no hope of ever encountering her. Due to a fortunate meeting of chance with his father, Ebina Namidabutsu, and his horse-seller friend, Bakurourokurouzaemon, Sarugenji is able to devise a plan to pose as the samurai \\"Utsunomiya\\" in order to enter the pleasure quarter and woo Hotarubi. The trio then encounter difficulty getting Sarugenji to mount Bakurourokurouzaemon's three-legged horse. Meanwhile, the courtesans of the pleasure house, including Hotarubi, are occupied playing a game involving matching poetry on shells, as they notice a strange-looking gardener. They are interrupted by the arrival of Ebina from the Hanamichi. He informs the owner of the premises, Teishu, of the impending arrival of \\"Lord Utsunomiya\\". Upon Sarugenji's arrival in his samurai guise, he encounters difficulty from the courtesans, each teasing him by pretending to be Hotarubi. After the entrance of the true Hotarubi, the courtesans demand a story of bravery from \\"Lord Utsunomiya\\". Sarugenji tells them a story dominated by fish puns and then passes out upon Hotarubi's lap from too much sake as the rest of the courtesans leave the stage. Sarugenji proceeds to sleep-talk about sardines. Upon his waking, he is questioned by Hotarubi, and claims his sardine seller's cry is actually a poem. Hotarubi then confesses that she is truly a princess who ran away from home to chase the cry of a sardine seller that she had fallen in love with. Just as she is about to attempt suicide, Sarugenji (with the aid of Ebina and Bakurourokurouzaemon) manages to convince her that he is actually the sardine seller she has been looking for. Just as Sarugenji declares that he will marry her, Teishu reminds them that he is owed two-hundred Ry≈ç as Hotarubi's ransom. Suddenly, the strange gardener from earlier arrives on stage, holding captive Sarugenji's \\"retainers\\". It seems that he is actually Jirota, a samurai in the service of Hotarubi's parents, come to pay her ransom. Hotarubi orders that he give two- hundred Ry≈ç to Teishu for her ransom, fifty Ry≈ç to Bakurourokurouzaemon for the horse, and that he delivers a message to her parents. Failing in his duty to rescue her, Jirota attempts seppuku, but his sword is seemingly too rusty for it to work. The play ends happily as Sarugenji and Hotarubi exit via the Hanamichi to get married. Performances The National Theatre of Japan in Hayabusa performed Iwashiuri as part of a double bill in September 2010. The Australian National University's Za Kabuki performed the play in 2002, 2006, and 2011. The 2006 performance was accompanied by an original orchestral score.

The goals are to protect and preserve its natural resources and wilderness character and provide for public use. History These mountains are considered to be the oldest on the North American continent. Evidence of early Indians dates back over 12,000 years. The Catawba Indians inhabited the area when the Europeans began exploring the region in the late 1600s. By 1760 settlement had begun in earnest, opened up by the explorers and traders along the Ocaneechi Trail. The Birkhead family raised a son, John Watson (Watt), who was born in 1858. The that he acquired over the years were made up of many small tenant farms. Thus the mountain range became known locally as the Birkhead Mountains. This old plantation is the core of the wilderness. Evidence of early Indians and settlers can often be found. Federal law protects such sites and artifacts on public land. Recreation All trails within the wilderness are designated hiking trails. Travel by horse, motorized vehicle or bicycle is prohibited. No mountain bikes or ATVs are allowed within the wilderness area. Disperse camping is allowed in the Birkhead Mountains Wilderness. Campers are required to stay at least 200 feet from all streams, creeks, roads and wildlife fields. When using fire rings, campers should disperse the ring before leaving camp. Use of cook stoves is highly recommended. Firewood is available as dead and down in the forest; campers should not cut live trees for firewood. Also hunting is allowed in this area, orange is advisable to wear during the hunting seasons, when hiking the trails. No permanent camps are allowed in the wilderness area. Camping is allowed for a 14-day period within a 30-day time frame. Dogs are allowed as long as they are on a leash and kept under control.

It is unstable in pure form, but its salts, known as dithionites, are stable. It was initially assumed that the C2 symmetric structure HOS(=O)-S(=O)OH is the most stable among molecules with the formula using ab initio calculations.

Designer Robert T. Jones computed the weight and balance for the setup and proposed a new design as an air-racer. Claude Flagg and H. F. Landis built the aircraft in their spare time and patented the wing design. Design The fuselage is welded steel with fabric covering. The wings used an early application of lightweight aluminum construction with U shaped cantilever spars with wire bracing and fabric covering. The aircraft used wheels with small tires and without brakes. The cockpit was open and the engine was fully cowled. In 1932 the Pobjoy P engine was replaced with a Pobjoy R of 75 hp. The cockpit was also enclosed. In 1933 Wittman lengthened the fuselage by 21 inches, removed the engine cowling and modified the rudder. In 1946 The engine was replaced with a Continental C-85. Operational history In 1932 Ownership passed to Air Racer Steve Wittman. An Air Commerce inspector fronted the money, and had Wittman race the aircraft to avoid a conflict of interest. The Pobjoy Special is the only racer Wittman raced that he did not build or design himself. In 1937 the Pobjoy Special is flipped on its back. It was rebuilt sold, and stored until the end of World War II. John Reaver entered the aircraft as the Reaver Special in the new Goodyear Formula One races. *1930 National Air Races - Registered as R1W, pilot Danny Fowlie reached 115 mph placing third in class with a mismatched prop. *1933 Chicago International Air Races - Pilot Steve Wittman wins all races in the 200ci class with a maximum speed of 120 mph. *1934 New Orleans - Wittman wins the 100 km world speed record of 137.513 mph for aircraft less than 440 pounds. *1934 Cleveland Air Races - Wittman wins all races in the 200ci class with a speed of 129.440 mph. *1935 Cleveland Air Races - New owner Percy V. Chaffee wins all races in 200ci class. In 1936 the 200ci class is eliminated, making the Pobjoy Special obsolete for racing. *1937 St.Louis - Last race of the Pobjoy Special. Variants * In 1998 former owner, Dick Sampson, commissioned an airworthy replica of the Pobjoy Special to be built by Bill Turner of Repeat Aviation.

The school is state assisted and therefore, like most other schools in South Africa, it charges a set amount of money for its services. The school offers a wide variety of sporting and cultural activities in addition to its academic program. History Bothasig and Bosmansdam High School are located on what was originally the farm, Bosmansdam. Part of the land was taken over by the Milnerton Municipality between 1961 and 1989. Bosmansdam was renamed Bothasig (\\"Botha's Vision\\") after the then Minister of Housing (and later State President), Mr. P.W. Botha, presented a house to the first resident. The town grew rapidly and it soon became clear that there was a need for a high school. The first staff consisted of only seven members. The first school committee was elected on 17 March 1971 under chairmanship of Mr. M.J. v.N. van Schoor. Initially the school motto was UNITAS but changed to UNITATE FORTIOR (stronger through unity). The school colours were also different at first with blue, orange and white making way in 1982 for blue, red and gold. The official emblem and tie were adopted in 1989. The school song was composed by the well- known Dirkie de Villiers with lyrics by his wife Doll. 1980 saw the first appearance of VOX (voice), the school paper. Academics Bosmansdam currently offers a wide variety of subjects to its students. Bosmansdam is a dual-medium school which makes English and Afrikaans the languages of instruction. This also means that the subjects of English and Afrikaans (one to be taken as Home Language and the other as First Additional Language) is compulsory. Unfortunately this means learners who cannot understand instruction in these languages and/or are unable to take one of these subjects cannot be accommodated. Immigrants may apply for exemption from Afrikaans. In this case another subject should be taken as extra subject in the place of Afrikaans. Juniors: At Grade 8 and 9 level all the required learning areas are covered. This includes: * English (Home and Additional Language) * Afrikaans (Home and Additional Language) * Mathematics * Natural Science * Economic Management Sciences (EMS), * Human and Social Sciences (History and Geography) * Arts and Culture * Technology * Life Orientation The subject of Design is also offered to Grade 8's and 9's in which computer and internet skills are taught with a focus on Google Apps and its many uses. Seniors: From Grade 10 to 12, students are provided with a wide variety of subject choices. English (Home or Additional Language), Afrikaans (Home or Additional Language) and Life Orientation are compulsory subjects. Students may then choose between Mathematics and Mathematical Literacy. The remaining subjects are divided into three groups. Students must choose one subject from each group. The exact structure of these groups differ from year to year to match student demand, but the following subjects are offered: * Accounting * Tourism * Life Sciences (Biology) * Business Studies * Physical Science * Computer Applications Studies (CAT) * Economics * History * Consumer Studies Some of these subjects can also be taken as extra subjects. Bosmansdam has in the recent past been able boast a Matric Pass rate of between 97% and 100% with overall results comparable to neighbouring schools. In 2011 Bosmansdam achieved a 100% matric pass rate with a very high percentage of students qualifying for admission to bachelor's degree study and the school followed this up with a 99.23% pass rate in 2012. The 100% target was once again achieved in 2013. Bosmansdam achieved a 98% matric pass rate in 2014 despite this being the first year in which it was possible for a learner to be progressed to Grade 12 without passing Grade 11. In 2015, the school once again achieved a 98.63% matric pass rate. Bosmansdam's results therefore comfortably surpassed that of many of its neighbours. A highly qualified and motivated staff is largely to thank for this. Sport Bosmansdam offers a variety of sports to its students. Summer sports offered: *Girls Tennis, Softball, Athletics, Action Netball, Action Hockey *Boys Tennis, Cricket, Athletics, Touch rugby, Action Soccer Winter sports offered: *Girls Netball, Field Hockey *Boys Rugby Chess is also a very successful sport at Bosmansdam. Former student, Clarke Tieties attained Western Province colours in 2010 with Shane Klaase and Joshua Raynard following suit in 2015. As a smaller school, Bosmansdam struggles to compete against the larger and wealthier schools in the Western Cape but within its various leagues, the school is very competitive. The school has achieved some success on the rugby field. The 1st XV competes successfully against the likes of President High School, Table View High School, The Settlers High School and J.G. Meiring High School. 2011 saw the 1st XV losing only one league game against a very strong side from President High School. Bosmansdam however beat President in 2012, which was another highly successful season. The 2012 side also managed a draw against Interschools rivals, Labori, in Paarl. This was the best Interschools result away from home ever. 2013 and 2014 had some mixed results although the win ratio was well above 70%. 2015 and 2016 have been average seasons, but a promising group of junior players augers well for the future. The u/19B team also went unbeaten in 2014 ‚Äì a testament to the depth of rugby talent at Bosmansdam. 2015 also saw the launch of the Knights concept at Bosmansdam. This resulted in the 1st XV being renamed the \\"REMAX Knights\\" thanks to a generous new sponsorship. Bosmansdam's Netball girls are also always competitive with senior teams often ending in the top 3 in their zone over recent years. A number of players have achieved Western Province and even Western Cape colours. The 2016 team contains three Western Province and two Western Cape players ‚Äì a fantastic achievement. Other girls have also received Western Province colours for Action Netball. Netball has been the most successful sport for Bosmansdam at Interschools in recent years. 2017 will see the launch of the \\"Bosmansdam Netball Academy\\" where talented players will be drafted into the 1st team training squad regardless of their age group in order to better develop their skills. The academy will be led by Mrs. Tanja Vermeulen, who is herself a former provincial Netball player. Hockey is a relatively new sport at Bosmansdam but player numbers are growing rapidly and results are slowly improving as the school establishes itself. Hockey is however currently only offered for girls due to a lack of demand among the boys. The well-known nearby Bothasig Baseball Club and the results of Bosmansdam's Softball sides seem to indicate a natural aptitude for the sport in the Bothasig area! The girls Softball sides have been going since 2011 and met with immediate success. A number of girls have been selected for the Western Province Northern Zone team. Former Bosmansdam student and former South African Baseball player (and now a teacher at the school), J.P. Norman, has taken on the coaching role. Soccer is however not offered due to a lack of facilities and coaches. Priority is afforded to the traditional sports of the school. Learners are allowed to join the nearby Bothasig Soccer Club as long as it does not interfere with school commitments. The highly successful club's senior teams contain many Bosmansdam students. =Interschools= As with most schools in South Africa, the culmination of the sporting year is the highly anticipated event known as Interschools. The entire event spans a week in which the school competes against Labori High School (based in Paarl) in a variety of sports and cultural pursuits. 2016 is the 16th year that Bosmansdam and Labori have been interschool rivals. Debating and chess matches take place during the week. On the Saturday, the other winter sports are decided. Initially the much older Labori with its boarding facilities dominated Interschools with a number of years seeing serious losses on Bosmansdam's side. The tide does appear to be turning as scores are becoming closer and closer. Especially on the netball courts Bosmansdam has been dominating in recent years. Interschools is traditionally decided by the winner of the 1st XV rugby match and on this count Labori have won 10 times and Bosmansdam 4 with one draw. 2011 saw Labori beating Bosmansdam by 1 point in the final seconds. In 2012 however Bosmansdam managed to secure a 17‚Äì17 draw in Paarl in shocking weather conditions against a supposedly much stronger side. This was Bosmansdam's best Interschools result away from home ever. Bosmansdam came close again in 2013, but were unable to convert pressure into points and eventually lost. 2014 saw Labori go unbeaten in their most successful season ever and Bosmansdam were rank underdogs. The Bossies showed spirit however and were in the game until the very end before Labori's much vaunted \\"dream team\\" finally put them away. 2015 saw the Labori \\"dream team\\" reach maturity and the result was one that Bosmansdam would like to forget. 2016 should be much closer though as Bosmansdam has steadily improved over the past 16 years and the one-sided Interschools of the past seem to be over Apart from Interschools, Bosmansdam also has many other derby days. These include derbies against President High School and close neighbours and fierce rivals, Edgemead High School. The rivalry against Edgemead is especially intense thanks to the close proximity as well as the connection between the two communities. The two schools are also rivals for admissions and good sports results are vital. Having Interschools contested between the two neighbouring schools could be considered in the future as it would make very good sense. This will however not be done at the expense of the good relationship with Labori. Technology Bosmansdam has in recent years shifted its focus to the extensive use of technology. This focus is not only with the intention of improving the quality of education for its learners, but also to properly prepare them for the modern work environment. Bosmansdam is an accredited Google Apps for Education school. School fees and donations have been well used in recent years to improve the technology on offer in the school. All teachers now have Chrome Books (Google-based laptops), data projectors and Wi- Fi internet access at their disposal. The administration of the school is also slowly but surely becoming cloud-based as the school attempts to embrace an eco-friendly culture. Regular training sessions are offered to the teachers to enable them to make full use of the benefits that Google Apps for education holds. All learners are given their own e-mail addresses and are able to communicate with the teachers and also gain access to cloud-based notes and other resources by means of Google Classrooms. Learners also have access to three computer labs which enables them to do research and complete tasks. Bosmansdam has managed to establish itself as leader in the field of technology among public schools in its area. Admission Bosmansdam High School is situated in Bothasig which is part of the urban sprawl of the Northern Suburbs of Cape Town. This means that students are no longer drawn solely from the surrounding community. All schools have been allocated \\"feeder areas\\". These are the areas the school is supposed to serve. Any applicants from within this area must be admitted to the school regardless of their ability to pay school fees. As with most schools, Bosmansdam struggles with a large number of parents who do not or cannot pay school fees. Another problem faced is that many residents of the feeder area have in recent years sent their children to neighbouring schools. This forces the school to admit children from outside the feeder area. There is now a renewed focus to entrench Bosmansdam's role as an integral part of Bothasig and its community. Although not a policy of the school, it is clear that the school is in a rivalry with neighbours such as Edgemead High School and Tygerberg High School. The school has in recent years achieved academic results comparable with these schools and in some cases have surpassed them. Recent demographic trends have placed Bosmansdam in a rather unusual situation. Recent history has seen the numbers of Afrikaans speaking learners in areas such as Table View (including Parklands and other areas), Milnerton and even Bothasig slowly decline. This has led to Afrikaans medium classes being ceased at both Table View High School and J.G. Meiring High School. Even President High School has been forced to become dual medium. Bosmansdam is now the only high school that offers Afrikaans medium classes in the Milnerton ‚Äì Table View ‚Äì Bothasig area (including Edgemead, Richwood and all areas in between). According to legislation regarding feeder areas, this makes all Afrikaans speaking students in these areas a priority for admittance to Bosmansdam. This could result in significant savings to parents in these areas that have to pay for transport to far-away schools such as Jan van Riebeeck High School and Durbanville High School. Thanks to sound financial management, Bosmansdam also charges some of the lowest school fees in the area.

Both Brigitte and her sister, Carleen Goodridge, had claimed that their father had raped and sexually abused them since they were little girls. Due to her abuse allegations, Brigitte received an outpouring of supporters, including US Senator Chuck Schumer, New York State Senators Diane Savino and Eric Adams. At Brigitte's highly publicized trial in fall 2009, she was convicted of second-degree manslaughter and sentenced to 5 to 15 years in prison, imprisoned for nearly 3 years before her release. Early life Of Americo-Liberian descent, Brigitte Harris was born on June 6, 1981. When she was 2 years old, she was abandoned by her mother in their Park Hill, New York apartment, and she went to live with her father on Bay Shore, New York. Her father later moved back to his home country of Liberia, and Brigitte moved around with relatives. She was physically abused by her grandmother. \\"In that house we were slaves and if we disobeyed, grandma hit us with a stick,\\" said Harris. Brigitte also claimed she was sexually abused by her cousin \\"My cousin forced me to perform oral sex on him.\\" During a family trip to Liberia, Brigitte confronted her mother and pastor about the abuse from her relatives but Eric Goodridge denied the allegations, claiming that she was crazy. By the age of 17 Brigitte moved out. When she was 26, Brigitte had been living on her own for years and worked as an airport security guard. Crime After several years of not seeing their father, Brigitte's sister, Carleen, called Brigitte because their father Eric Goodridge wanted to talk to them. When Brigitte arrived, she saw one of her nieces sitting on Eric's lap. Brigitte and Carleen argued about her sister letting their father stay in her house, considering what he had done to them as children. Eric (Brigitte and Carleen's father) told Brigitte about his decision to take his granddaughters with him to Liberia against their will. On July 28, 2007, Brigitte Harris decided to see her father alone in her Rockaway apartment to reason with him and try to convince him not to take the girls. Brigitte asked her father to get help. After the conversation became heated, Brigitte handcuffed her father and gagged him with a towel to prevent him from screaming. Then, using a scalpel, she removed her father's penis. She called 9-1-1, and let them know he was still alive and needed help. She told the operator that she was on her way to the police station, but she never showed up. Instead, she called her sister and told her what she had done. Carleen (Brigitte's sister) advised her to come to her home instead of going to the police. When she arrived, her sister called an ambulance. After seeing her with the scalpel in hand and still in shock, they decided to check her into the Richmond University Medical Center psychiatric ward. Brigitte's sister Carleen hired defense lawyer Arthur L. Aidala to represent Brigitte,. She told the lawyer details about the sexual abuse that occurred throughout her childhood. She claimed he told her how, in some African cultures, fathers have to take their daughter's virginity. \\"He said he was doing it because he loves me and that is how fathers show love to their daughters,\\" Brigitte said. Carleen also decided to break the silence and finally admitted that she was sexually abused by their father as well, but was too afraid to speak up. She set up a website called savebridget.com to raise money for her sister's legal defense. =Investigation= After being discharged from the psychiatric ward on August 16, 2007, Brigitte was charged with second-degree murder and first- degree manslaughter and was held at Rikers Island. Brigitte, who had referred to herself as \\"Lady Vengeance\\" and \\"The Original Dark Angel\\" on her MySpace page, had claimed that she had not intended to kill her father. \\"I felt that I had to stop him,\\" \\"take away his weapon\\". Trial Two years after her arraignment for second-degree murder, Brigitte went to trial in September 2009. She testified in her own defense that she had researched the 1993 castration case of Lorena Bobbitt. Prosecutors maintained that Brigitte had intentionally handcuffed her father, stuffed a towel down his throat, then used a scalpel to remove his penis. She threw the severed penis under the Rockaway Boardwalk in Far Rockaway. Brigitte argued that her motive for the killing was not revenge, but an act to prevent Goodridge from taking his granddaughters to Liberia and molesting them. On September 30, 2009, Brigitte's jury found her guilty of the lesser included offense of second- degree manslaughter. One juror reported that \\"None of us felt that she deserved to get any murder charges or anything. So we decided on second-degree Manslaughter.\\" =Aftermath= Despite jury letters, Queens Supreme Court Judge Arthur Cooperman sentenced Brigitte Harris to the maximum of 5 to 15 years in prison. After serving 3 years, she was released on parole on August 13, 2012. Brigitte said, \\"I don't think killing him was the answer...I can't believe I actually did it. The only thing I had in my mind was to stop him.\\" She also stated that she wants to work for the advocacy group STEPS to End Family Violence when she gets out of prison. Brigitte's case was profiled on the Oxygen Network series Snapped in November 2010. The program contains statements from Brigitte, her attorney Arthur L. Aidala and her supporters. Her case was later profiled on the Investigation Discovery program Deadly Women in the episode \\"Parents' Peril\\".

His work evolved from strongly colored and thickly brushed paintings and sharp and angular black and white prints, to late abstract prints in a variety of colors. Although his style and preferred mediums both changed through a long career, the human figure remained his most enduring and constant subject. Early life Otto Neumann was born in Heidelberg, the third child of Fritz Neumann, a professor of Romance Philology at the University of Heidelberg. Neumann grew up exposed to his father‚Äôs circle of intellectual friends. Among them were prominent professors of art, literature, and medicine including Ernst Troeltsch and Max Weber. Books were a major part of his family life, and he was to use mythology, Dante's Inferno, and more modern works as the sources for his art. After graduating from the local Humanistic Gymnasium, the young man began to study art at the art academy in Karlsruhe. World War I interrupted his training, and he spent six months in the Rastatt Artillery before receiving a medical discharge. He briefly returned to Karlsruhe, then took private lessons from the landscape painter, Wilhelm Oertel in Mannheim before completing his training at the Academie der Bildenden Kunste in Munch in 1919. After returning to Heidelberg, he began to paint oil portraits, primarily of such major university figures as Max Weber and medical faculty members like Hans Prinzhorn. The latter was perhaps the father of art therapy, and recruited the young artist as part of a control group studying the effect of psychedelic drugs on patients. Neumann's early years as an artist were fertile, and he produced linoleum prints of scenes from the Passion of Christ, produced both watercolor and oil still-life paintings, and made pencil and charcoal drawings after the historical artists he most admired. He also completed a series of highly detailed graphite drawings that were based on each canto of Dante‚Äôs Inferno and several of Purgatory. And though he never utilized these drawings in a published edition of the Dante epic, they became known, and admired by scholars. He also made prints of many of the Dante subjects, though almost always one of a kind, and set up his unusual lifelong practice of sometimes signing the prints but never utilizing edition numbers. Marriage and daughter Neumann married his neighbor, Hilde Rothschild, on January 15, 1929, and their only child, Marianne, was born in November of that year. The family lived in Stuttgart for the next four years and, in addition to the Dante prints, the artist continued to work in all two dimensional media, with many drawings and watercolors of his wife and daughter. They moved to a suburb of Munich in 1933, with financial help from Hilde‚Äôs family, and lived in a house with a large studio for the artist, remaining there for the rest of their lives. The artist‚Äôs literary interests continue to be reflected, in drawings and prints based on African fairy tales, subjects from classical mythology, the Passion of Christ, and a group of fourteen linoleum prints adapted from Edvard Munch‚Äôs Alpha and Omega series. Except in the landscapes and a bit in the still life works, there is neither a background nor a ground, yet the figures seem firmly anchored in their settings. During this period, Neumann‚Äôs work begins to be recognized, and is shown in various exhibitions. He also attracted scholarly attention. Nazi era As the Nazi regime took hold of the country, Neumann‚Äôs work was considered degenerate and his refusal to divorce his Jewish wife to further his career set him aside from many of his friends who compromised their work and their associations. Deprived of a market for his work, and with Hilde‚Äôs family having left the country and no longer able to help, the artist worked as a technical illustrator of anatomical drawings for the Medical School in Munich, and when the school was destroyed, he was able to work on such drawings in his own studio. The Neumanns took in the contemporary writer Werner Bergengruen and his family when their home was bombed, and the artist made portraits of the family in addition to paintings and drawings based on his friend‚Äôs novels. Postwar years After the war, Neumann never returned to oils or watercolors, though he did do a number of works in colored chalks and pastels, through the mid-1950s. Otherwise, he spent the rest of his long career creating drawings and various kinds of prints, with many in the late forties and through the 1950s based on such subjects from classical mythology as Perseus, Mercury and Argos, centaurs in battle and at rest, and several scenes from the saga of Odysseus. One or two figures tend to predominate, though there are often frieze-like arrangements of forms along the picture plane of the sheet of paper. Tragedy struck when Marianne committed suicide, increasing Neumann‚Äôs already pessimistic outlook on the world, but he continued to produce art despite his mental health. By the mid-1950s, monotypes began to predominate in his oeuvre, mostly created on sheets of glass and increasingly abstractions of the human figure. The overt literary based subjects, and the more personal grotesques and composites of forms were replaced by simplified, though often interlocking forms, usually on a flat background. Hilde seems to have coped with their daughter‚Äôs death by returning to the weaving of her early years, and produced large woolen tapestries that exactly duplicated the form of individual Neumann prints. The artist also starts to give individual instruction to a number of students, and began to exhibit with groups of mostly younger artists. He also had work included in several small German literary magazines, which showcased the work of young poets and writers, and he clearly identified with the younger generation as his work grew more abstract. Still depressed and relying too much on medication for both physical pain and depression, the artist admitted himself to a homeopathic sanitarium in 1960 producing very small monotypes while there. After his release, he continued to take homeopathic medications and did exercise. His work got additional attention during the 1960s, and though he never made the journey, there were shows in the United States. When Hilde died in 1970, the artist had a burst of work and then stopped toward the end of 1971. Sales and proposals for exhibitions came from several countries, but he had lost interest in promoting the work. He remained at home, and died on January 2, 1975 after suffering a fatal heart attack. Several small exhibitions were mounted after his death, with a full retrospective appearing at the Heidelberger Kunstverein in 1982. Other exhibitions were in Stuttgart, and several in the United States, with the cooperation of Hilde‚Äôs family who inherited the estate. Major work Following the path of many artists, Neumann was usually only interested in his recent work, and would have destroyed much of his early production, had his wife not interfered and stored them in the studio. When friends and family came to see him from elsewhere, they never even saw the earlier work. Yet, many scholars and members of the artistic community regarded the Dante pieces, the early grotesques, and the oil portraits highly. Later, after the war, and increasingly through the 1960s, younger artists identified with the late works that were so abstracted from nature that the viewer with no knowledge of the trajectory of Neumann‚Äôs career might simply have identified them as non-objective. Whatever the vagaries of taste, the early oil portraits like the self-portrait, that of Max Weber, and others, along with the Passion prints, the grotesque prints and drawings, and the Dante drawings are the prime examples of his early career The work of the immediate post-war years include the mythological figures and wonderful curvaceous horses and riders, while the solemn and totemic late abstracts in various colors show the extreme to which he took his work on the human figure.

Woods was sentenced to death after a jury convicted him of the capital murders of Ronald Whitehead, 21, and Bethena Brosz, 19, on May 2, 2001 in The Colony, Texas. Woods petitioned to media outlets for prisoner rights in February 2004. He was incarcerated on the Texas state death row for men, located in the Allan B. Polunsky Unit (formerly the Terrell Unit) in West Livingston, Texas. In late 2006, Woods was part of a hunger strike in Polunsky, to oppose death-row inmates' treatment. Sentencing Woods' co-defendant, Marcus Rhodes, pleaded guilty to shooting both victims to death with a firearm in the same criminal transaction and received a life sentence. During the trial, authorities were revealed to have recovered backpacks belonging to the slain pair along with shell casings and a bloodied knife in Rhodes' car. Guns used in the slayings were also recovered from the home of Rhodes' parents. However, in Texas, the law of parties states that a person can be criminally responsible for the actions of another if he or she aids and abets, conspires with the principal, or anticipates the crime. Although Rhodes pleaded guilty to the murders and Woods did not, and no physical evidence tied Woods to the scene, Woods was executed for the crime. Witnesses testified at Woods' 2002 trial that Rhodes and he said that they lured Whitehead to an isolated road on the pretense of a drug deal and that Woods shot and killed him, because Whitehead knew about a killing 2 months earlier in California. Rhodes was later found guilty of the California murder and Woods was not. Prosecutors said Brosz was merely driving her boyfriend Whitehead to the drug deal. Brosz had been killed because she witnessed Whitehead's death, yelled, and then attempted to flee. =Controversy= The fairness of Woods' case and punishment was criticized by Amnesty International. Woods' criminal case was reported locally and internationally. Woods' final motion for a stay was denied on September 2, 2011. Execution In his last words, Woods stated: Woods then took several deep breaths before all body movement stopped. A needle carrying the lethal drugs into his right arm pierced a green tattoo of a rose branch. The distinctive tattoo had identified him when he was arrested. Woods was pronounced dead on September 13, 2011, at 6:22 pm. Woods' was the 10th execution carried out in Texas in 2011 and the 474th since Texas resumed the death penalty in 1982.

Situations that countries are in at any one point in time reflect their previous investment decisions and development. Accordingly, at any point in time desirable investment programs that are not balanced investment packages may still advance welfare. Unbalanced investment can complement or correct existing imbalances. Once such an investment is made, a new imbalance is likely to appear, requiring further compensating investments. Therefore, growth need not take place in a balanced way. Supporters of the unbalanced growth doctrine include Albert O. Hirschman, Hans Singer, Paul Streeten, Marcus Fleming, Prof. Rostov and J. Sheehan.  Introduction  The theory is generally associated with Hirschman. He presented a complete theoretical formulation of the strategy. Underdeveloped countries display common characteristics: low levels of GNI per capita and slow GNI per capita growth, large income inequalities and widespread poverty, low levels of productivity, great dependence on agriculture, a backward industrial structure, a high proportion of consumption and low savings, high rates of population growth and dependency burdens, high unemployment and underemployment, technological backwardness and dualism{existence of both traditional and modern sectors}. In a less-developed country, these characteristics lead to scarce resources or inadequate infrastructure to exploit these resources. With a lack of investors and entrepreneurs, cash flows cannot be directed into various sectors that influence balanced economic growth. Hirschman contends that deliberate unbalancing of the economy according to the strategy is the best method of development and if the economy is to be kept moving ahead, the task of development policy is to maintain tension, disproportions and disequilibrium. Balanced growth should not be the goal but rather the maintenance of existing imbalances, which can be seen from profit and losses. Therefore, the sequence that leads away from equilibrium is precisely an ideal pattern for development. Unequal development of various sectors often generates conditions for rapid development. More-developed industries provide undeveloped industries an incentive to grow. Hence, development of underdeveloped countries should be based on this strategy. The path of unbalanced growth is described by three phases: # Complementary # Induced investment # External economies Singer believed that desirable investment programs always exist within a country that represent unbalanced investment to complement the existing imbalance. These investments create a new imbalance, requiring another balancing investment. One sector will always grow faster than another, so the need for unbalanced growth will continue as investments must complement existing imbalance. Hirschman states ‚ÄúIf the economy is to be kept moving ahead, the task of development policy is to maintain tensions, disproportions and disequilibrium‚Äù. This situation exists for all societies, developed or underdeveloped.  Complementarity  Complementarity is a situation where increased production of one good or service builds up demand for the second good or service. When the second product is privately produced, this demand will lead to imports or higher domestic production of the second product, as it will be in the interests of the producers to do so. Otherwise, the increased demand takes the form of political pressure. This is the case for such public services such as law and order, education, water and electricity that cannot reasonably be imported.  Induced investment  Complementarity allows investment in one industry or sector to encourage investment in others. This concept of induced investment is like a multiplier, because each investment triggers a series of subsequent events. Convergence occurs as the output of external economies diminishes at each step. Growth sequences tend to move towards convergence or divergence and the policy is usually concerned with preventing rapid convergence and promoting the possibility of divergence.  External economies  New projects often appropriate external economies created by preceding ventures and create external economies that may be utilized by subsequent ones. Sometimes the project undertaken creates external economies, causing private profit to fall short of what is socially desirable. The reverse is also possible. Some ventures have a larger input of external economies than the output. Therefore, Hirschman says, \\"the projects that fall into this category must be net beneficiaries of external economies\\".  Social Overhead Capital  Social Overhead Capital (SOC) is defined as basic services without which primary, secondary and tertiary productive activities cannot function. In a narrow sense, Social Overhead Capital is defined to include transportation and electricity, while in a wider sense, it includes all public services, including law and order and education. Criteria for classifying an asset as Social Overhead Capital include: * The services provided by the activity should facilitate a great variety of economic activities. * The services provided should be subject to public control. * The services cannot be imported. * The investment needed to provide services should be characterized by some unevenness as well as by high capital output ratio.  Development via capital imbalances  The strategy of unbalanced growth has been discussed within the frameworks of development through shortage of SOC and development through excess of SOC. In the first case, the country invests in direct productive activities (DPA). Direct productive activity increases demand for SOC, inducing investment. In the second case, SOC expands, which reduces the cost of services, inducing investment in DPA. The cost of producing any unit of output of DPA is inversely proportional to SOC. The economy's major objective is to attain increasing output of DPA. One of the paradoxes of development is that poor countries cannot afford to be economical. According to Hirschman, resources are not scarce per se, but the ability to employ those resources may be lacking. To explain unbalanced growth, Hirschman assumes that the country invests in either DPA or SOC. Both paths set up incentives and an evaluation of their respective efficiency depends on the strengths of entrepreneurial motivations and the response to public pressure of the authorities responsible for SOC. The major characteristic of the two paths of development is that they yield excess dividends. SOC built ahead of demand creates this demand by making a country more attractive to DPA investors. DPA that outpaces SOC development, creates demand to expand SOC. Balanced growth of DPA and SOC is not achievable in underdeveloped countries, nor it is not a desirable policy, as it does not set up the incentives and the pressure that make for this dividend of induced investment decisions.  Backward and forward linkages  Hirschman introduces the concept of backward and forward linkages. A forward linkage is created when investment in a particular project encourages investment in subsequent stages of production. A backward linkage is created when a project encourages investment in facilities that enable the project to succeed. Normally, projects create both forward and backward linkages. Investment should be made in those projects that have the greatest total number of linkages. Hirschman called the industries with greatest complementarities as the 'leading sectors'. Projects with many linkages will vary from country to country; knowledge about project linkages can be obtained through input and output studies. Most underdeveloped economies are primarily agrarian. Agriculture is typically at a primitive stage and hence possesses few linkages, as most output goes for consumption or exports. Therefore, it is said that underdeveloped countries are lacking in interdependence and linkages. An example of an industry that has excellent forward and backward linkages is the steel industry. Backward linkages include coal and iron ore mining. Forward linkages include items such as canned goods. While this industry has strong linkages, it is not a good leading sector. Any industry that has a high capital/output ratio and causes significant costs to other businesses has the potential to hurt the developing economy more than it helps it. A better leading sector would be the beer industry.  Linkages and last industries  The development of an economy using the unbalanced method depends on the linkages between sectors. Hirschman suggests that the best strategy is induced industrialization. This type of development will create more backward and forward linkages and should be the first step taken. Industries that transform semi-manufactured goods into goods needed by final demand are called \\"last industries\\" or \\"enclave import industries\\". In underdeveloped countries, industrialization takes place through such industries, through plants that add final touches to unfinished imported products. Examples are metal fabricating industries, pharmaceutical laboratories and assembly and mixing plants. Such industries have many advantages, as they often require the smaller amounts of capital available in such economies and without having to rely on unreliable domestic producers. Therefore, underdeveloped countries set up such \\"last industries\\" first. These industries create long chains of backward linkages. Colombia, Brazil and Mexico are examples of countries that followed this path. Protection and subsidy of import-replacing industries should come, but at a later stage. The Last Industry Strategy has disadvantages. It can slow the creation of domestic production. Industrialists who have begun working with imports may not accept domestic alternative products that reduce demand for their output. Creating last industries first can create loyalty toward foreign products and distrust of domestic products and their quality. Banks may get used to extending credit for shorter, smaller capital requirements. = Disadvantages = Disadvantages of the last industry strategy include inhibition of domestic production as domestic demand grows. This is because industrialists who work with imported material will often be hostile to the establishment of domestic industries, because domestic goods are of lower quality, the number of domestic suppliers is small, downstream competition may intensify once inputs are available domestically and competitors may be able to locate closer to the upstream suppliers. Last/first may accustom domestic consumers to imported goods, making it harder for local producers to find customers. Further, financing may be easier for import-based business.

Life Casagrande was born in Belmont, Massachusetts to Erna and Arthur Casagrande in 1942. She received her B.S. in psychology from University of Colorado in 1964 and then obtained her PhD from Duke University in 1973 in physiological psychology under the direction of Irving T. Diamond. Career Casagrande did her postdoctoral study at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison prior to becoming an assistant professor at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in 1975. In 1982, Prof. Casagrande became an investigator into the vernal keratoconjunctivitis and held leading positions at VKC. In 1986, Dr. Casagrande became full professor and investigator at the Vanderbilt Brain Institute and at the Vanderbilt Kennedy Center. As an investigator, she had worked as an associate director under guidance from Elisabeth Dykens and interim director, Steve Warren, at the Biomedical Research from 1988 to 1991. From 1989 to 1991 she was also a director of the Neuroscience Core and the Neuroscience Research Cluster, which she left in 1992. From 1997 to 2001, Professor Casagrande had served on the Communications and Chapters Committee of the Society for Neuroscience. In 2006, she served as a chairperson for the National Eye Institute's CDA Review Panel and was on Andrew G. White's thesis committee at the University of Sydney. =Research= Casagrande's research focused on understanding how the visual thalamus and cortex interact to construct our perceptual world. She did this through three different projects. Her first project was to analyze the notion that the primary sensor information received by the visual cortex from the visual thalamus is not purely visual, but rather visual information. The second project was to test whether all thalamic nuclei contain some cell groups that act as drivers and some that act as modulators for multiple cortical areas. The third project was to study communication between cells in separate areas of the visual cortex and how visual messages are coded and transmitted from lower to higher visual areas and what the role of feedback is. =Editorial work= Casagrande had served on many editorial boards, including for the Cerebral Cortex, Journal of Comparative Neurology and Visual Neuroscience. She also was an assistant editor for the American Journal on Mental Retardation, Journal of Experimental and Integrative Medicine, and Visual Neuroscience. Awards Casagrande was awarded the Charles Judson Herrick Award (1981) from the American Association of Anatomists and was elected fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (2006) and the American Association of Anatomists (2011). Posthumously, she was inducted into the Patricia Goldman-Rakic Hall of Honor, by the Society for Neuroscience. Selected publications *Khaytin, I, Xin Chen, D.W. Royal, O. Ruiz, W.J. Jermakowicz, R.M.

The painting has been little studied within Manet's oeuvre, as art historians have had difficulty finding a place for the work within the development of Manet's art.Ilg, 179 The pictorial content of the painting is limited to a man who appears to have just shot himself‚Äîstill holding a gun while slouched on a bed‚Äîand a few pieces of furniture. Manet has removed the trappings of earlier depictions of suicide, and provided next to no narrative content or \\"moralizing tendency\\".Ilg, 179‚Äì180 Ulrike Ilg associates the painting with the realism of Gustave Courbet, noting that Courbet also used a depiction of death in his Burial at Ornans (1849‚Äì50), a work that Courbet later described as the beginning of his new artistic approach. The realism of Le Suicid√© has fueled speculation that it depicts an actual suicide, but the subject, if any, is not known.Paradis Speculation has concerned an assistant of Manet who committed suicide in Manet's studio more than a decade earlier. Another suicide proposed to be connected with the painting was that of an artist whom √âmile Zola had written about in 1866. Recent critics have downplayed these associations. Manet's approach to this depiction may represent his continuing desire to break from academic tradition, in which a depiction of suicide could only fit within the genre of history painting‚Äîwhere death and suicide would be placed within a narrative associated with sacrifice, idealism, or heroism. Examples in the French language include The Death of Socrates (1787) by Jacques-Louis David, which depicts Socrates' choice to kill himself by hemlock rather than go into exile. There is no such grand statement underlying Manet's painting. The artist has not given us a time, a place, or a protagonist. The painting is plainly constructed rather than carefully styled.

Ottawa once had tracks through downtown on Rideau Street, Sparks Street and others, and extended outside of the downtown core to provide services that helped form communities such as Westboro, Old Ottawa South and The Glebe. Prior to this, starting in 1866, public transportation was provided by Ottawa City Passenger Railway Company, a horse-drawn tram service. The O.E.R. was taken over by the Ottawa Transportation Commission in 1948, which was itself succeeded by OC Transpo in 1973. History =Ottawa City Passenger Railway Company= Ottawa City Passenger Railway Company Ottawa c1871, Horse drawn streetcar Preceding the use of electric streetcars, Ottawa's first public transportation system was the operation of a horsecar system. Tramway service began in July 1870. under the Ottawa City Passenger Railway Company, which was incorporated on August 15, 1866. The O.C.P.R. was financed largely by the estate of Thomas McKay (an early founder of Ottawa). In 1868, Thomas Reynolds bought control of the company intending to use it to transport lumber at night from the Chaudiere mills to McTaggart Street, the terminal of the St. Lawrence and Ottawa Railway. In 1871, Reynolds sold his streetcar company interest to Thomas Keifer. The horse-drawn streetcars travelled back and forth from New Edinburgh to the Chaudi√®re Bridge. The trams for passengers and freight had a line extending from Rideau Falls in New Edinburgh, to Sussex, Sparks, Wellington, Duke (in Lebreton Flats) and the Suspension Bridge. The service provided sleighs in the winter and had 273,000 passengers in its first year of operation. In 1891, it had of track, 25 horses and 15 employees. The Ottawa City Passenger Railway Company had tram cars holding 20 passengers which were made of wood with bench seats. The company applied to the city to convert to electricity but was refused, and later it proposed a merger of two companies. A new company, Ottawa Electric Railway Company, would appear on the scene in the early 1890s and would later dominate public transportation in Ottawa. =Electricity in Ottawa= First streetcar route, Ottawa map 1874; Route along Sussex, Sparks, Wellington to Chaudiere Falls Ottawa's first electric lights operated near the Chaudi√®re Falls in 1882, and in 1885, electric lighting came to the city streets under Ottawa Electric Light Company. Thomas Ahearn, born in LeBreton Flats, also became an important figure in the early years of electricity in Ottawa. Ahearn had been a telegraph operator, and in 1892 filed patents for both an \\"electric oven\\" and a \\"system of warming cars by means of electrically heated water\\". Ahearn formed a partnership with Warren Y. Soper, and for years the office of Ahearn and Soper was on Sparks Street. Ahearn merged existing companies (Clemow's) Ottawa Electric Light Company, and Ahearn's company, Chaudi√®re Electric Light and Power Company, with a third company, naming it Ottawa Electric Company. It became part of Ahearn's Ottawa Light, Heat and Power Company, which eventually was taken over by Ottawa Hydro. In 1901, Ottawa Electric Railway Company built a canal just north of the Britannia Boathouse Club to generate Hydroelectric power on the Desch√™nes Rapids. Although the hydroelectric project was abandoned as unfeasible, the unfinished canal was used in 1951 by Past Commodores Thomas G. Fuller and Reginald G. Bruce with labour provided by volunteer Club members as the basis of the Britannia Yacht Club\`s protected harbour. Today, the main and inner harbour provide 250 wet moorings, fuel and pumpout facilities, for both sail and power boats.Joan Yuile, Al Malo and Marc Charbonneau \`\`125 Years of the Britannia Yacht Club 1887-2012\`\` (Ottawa, Britannia Yacht Club, 2012). =Ottawa Electric Railway Company= 36 Rideau Street looking east, 1898 The horsecar was providing public transportation for Ottawa into the 1890s when, for a short time, electric streetcars were also employed. Initially Thomas Ahearn's new company started streetcar operations until it was merged with the existing horsecar company, and in the process, it was renamed to the Ottawa Electric Railway Company. In 1890 Mayor Howland of Toronto offered to provide Ottawa with an electric streetcar service. He backed out and Ahearn stepped in, and he along with Soper petitioned the city in order to obtain the franchise. They succeeded, and got granted a 20-year charter for on November 5, 1890, city council gave them permission to operate an electric railway. They formed a company on February 13, 1891 called the Ottawa Electric Street Railway Company(sic). On June 25, 1891 the first electric street cars began operation in a display of five (four on June 29) streetcars with Ahearn and Soper as drivers. Mayor Thomas Birkett was aboard, as well as some dignitaries and they ran to the exhibition grounds on Bank Street. The Ottawa City Passenger Railway Company was amalgamated with the Ottawa Electric Street Railway Company in 1893. The merger took place resulting in the formation of a new company; on June 28 the Ottawa Electric Railway Company was incorporated. O.E.R. purchased W. W. Wylie Carriage Works in 1893 and started making its own cars. Patterson and Corbin of St. Catharines provided ten trams. In the winter, some of the fleet was equipped with plows and rotating brushes to clear the track. In 1893 three cars had heaters. Later models were equipped with underfloor heaters; the first heated tramcars on the continent. This company operated in conjunction with the Ottawa Transportation Company, which was granted a charter in 1892 (which would last until February 21, 1942.) Its first tracks started from Broad Street Station (in LeBreton Flats) to Albert and Metcalfe, then to the exhibition grounds via Bank Street, to the Protestant Hospital at Charlotte and Rideau, to Wellington and Rideau, the Canada Atlantic Station at the end of Elgin to Sparks and Metcalfe. Street cars allowed access to areas such as Britannia Park, Rockliffe Park and Queen's Park in Aylmer. Broad Street Station, Lebreton Flats; royal mail streetcar (likely early 1900s) In the city's first eleven months of electric streetcar service, it had a ridership of 1.5 million whereas the horse tramway had 575,000. The city agreed to a 30-year electric railway in 1893 following which the horse tramways disappeared. The city for years renewed the charter rather than exercising its right to purchase the company's property. By 1900, Ottawa Electric Railway had a double-tracked line to Britannia Bay. Sunday service started in 1900 despite strong protests from citizens wanting to maintain the Sunday as a Sabbath Day. The Alexandra Bridge opened for traffic on February 22, 1901 by the Ottawa Northern and Western Railway Company to bring service from Waltham and Maniwaki After the Alexandra Bridge was built, it was employed with the O.E.R. The Alexandra Bridge had a single track for steam trains, and two tracks for electric trams and two roadways for cars and two footpaths. In 1924, fares were five cents; 3 cents for children. The O.E.R. introduced buses in 1924 but they were removed, only returning in 1939 (for a service between Elgin and Ottawa East). In August 1948, city council finally agreed to purchase the company's assets. The city bought the O.E.R. for $6.3 million in 1950. The Ottawa Transportation Commission was set up to operate it and 54 million passengers rode in 1950. By 1958 financial problems of the O.T.C. caused a study to be conducted by Urwick, Currie Ltd. In March 1958, they acknowledged the 96 aging cars and recommended diesel buses. The Ottawa Transportation Commission began implementing the plan and removed the cars; the last electric car ran on May 1, 1959 when the Britannia line was closed. A parade was held on May 4 celebrating an end to 68 years of tram service in Ottawa. The O.T.C. was succeeded by OC Transpo in 1973.

Biography Anthony Howells was born in 1832 at Dowlais, Glamorganshire, Wales. His father was superintendent of mines in that area. He attended the limited free schools of his town, and, at age 12, a private school in Llandybie, Carmarthenshire for one year. He then began working in the mines. At age 14 he was responsible for his own affairs, and decided the United States offered better prospects. He worked underground until age 18 in 1850, when he sailed to America, and moved immediately to Youngstown, Ohio. In Youngstown, Howells resumed coal mining in the mines of David Tod, later Governor of Ohio. In the spring of 1853 he moved to California to mine, but returned to Youngstown the following spring, and worked in the mines until fall of 1855. Howells tired of mining, and opened a grocery and provision house, which continued until 1869, with the exception of the year 1865, when he engaged in coal mining in Du Quoin, Illinois. In 1869, Howells was offered an investment and management position of two mines in Massillon, Ohio. The Howells Coal Company ended up employing six hundred men. Howell's first attempts at politics were Democratic nominations for treasurer of Mahoning County in 1866, and state senator in the ninth district in 1868. He lost both times in largely Republican districts. In 1875, he was a candidate for Ohio State Treasurer at the state convention, but failed to receive the nomination. In 1877, he was nominated, and elected to a two-year term as state treasurer. He failed at re-election in 1879. As reward for his party activity, Howells was appointed Postmaster of Massillon in 1886, but resigned after two years. In 1888 he was nominated a Presidential elector at the state convention, but the state went Republican. In 1889, he was elected to the Ohio State Senate for the twenty first district, Stark and Carroll counties, for the 1890‚Äì91 term. He lost his bid for re-election to his Republican opponent in 1891. In 1893, Howells was appointed United States consul to Cardiff, Wales by President Cleveland, where he represented the government for four years. In 1901 he was nominated for Ohio Lieutenant Governor but lost the general election. He then retired from politics. In 1901, Howells sold his mining company, and in 1902, began construction of the Hotel Courtland in Canton, Ohio, which was completed in 1905. He lived there for three years before moving to Cleveland, Ohio. He died at Cleveland Heights, Ohio, November 17, 1915, and was interred at the city cemetery in Massillon. Howells was initiated to the I.O.O.F. in 1887 and Knights of Pythias in 1888. He also belonged to the Welsh Irorites. He was married to Elizabeth James in 1854, and had three sons and a daughter.

The work, once in the local Pious House of Misericordy, was commissioned in unknown circumstances, although its size suggests that it was destined to private devotion. It was perhaps ordered by cardinal Alemanno Adimari, archbishop of Pisa, who had his sepulchre in the Roman church of Santa Maria Nova decorated by Gentile (a lost work mentioned by late Renaissance art biographer Giorgio Vasari). Description The Madonna of Humility, with the Virgin sitting on a cushion over the ground, was a common theme in early 15th century western painting. She is holding the Child on her knees, above a richly decorated gilt cloth. The fine golden background, the rendering of the clothes and other technical detail link the panel to the artist's Florentine period, including works such as the Adoration of the Magi (1423) and (in particular for the posture of the Child) the Adoration of the Child. A work with the same composition was executed by Gentile da Fabriano in 1420-1421, although in it the Virgin is portrayed frontally. The mantle of the Virgin has on the border the inscription \\"AVE M[A]T[ER] DIEGNA [D]EI\\", while on the edge of the cloth on which the Child lies are Arabic characters, which have been read as the Quran Shahada (ŸÑÿß ÿ•ŸÑŸá ÿ•ŸÑÿß ÿßŸÑŸÑŸá - LƒÅ ilƒÅha illa AllƒÅh).

The film is based on the Thomas Hardy novel Tess of the d'Urbervilles. The songs from this film became hits. \\"Sapnon Mein Agar Mere\\", \\"Ek Haseen Shaam Ko Dil Mera Kho Gaya\\", \\"Maine Rang Li Aaj Chunariya\\" and \\"Kai Din Se Jee Hai Bekal\\" are evergreen numbers.  Plot  Ashok (Dharmendra) and Nirmala (Nutan) meet on a railway platform in Dehradun, and then consequently in town as well, and are attracted to each other. Nirmala discovers that her mother (Leela Chitnis) has mortgaged their house to pay for her education, so she gets a job as nurse to a wealthy blind woman (Mumtaz Begum). This woman has a son Ranjit (Rehman) who is also very attracted to Nirmala. She knows it, but does her best to keep him at arm's length. Then Ashok gets a job out of town. When he tells Nirmala, he gives her a bracelet and promises to come back for her soon. But after a party at her employer's home‚Äîagainst her better judgment‚Äîshe accepts a ride with Ranjit and he rapes her. The bracelet from Ashok is lost and she is left on the cold ground. When she finds out that she is pregnant, her mother takes her out of town, where she gives birth to a still-born child. Meanwhile, Ashok's father has arranged his marriage with the daughter of a colleague. Ashok's friend Bansi (Johnny Walker) sabotages the marriage when the girl comes to visit (in a very funny scene) by insinuating that Ashok is an inveterate gambler. This enrages his father, and when Ashok says that he has promised another girl he would marry her, his father retorts that he has promised his friend. At his response, Ashok's father gets up and leaves without another word. When Nirmala and her mother return home, Nirmala gets a letter from two of her school friends. They are working in Mussoorie at a school, and think Nirmala can get a job teaching there too. She goes there and gets the job at the school. Her friends ask where she has been, and tell her that Ashok went to her house looking for her several times. Ashok is living in a camp in Mussoorie, working as an engineer. The girls and Bansi conspire to reunite them. Ashok is overjoyed to see Nirmala, but of course she has changed. He asks her to marry him; she refuses at first, then says that she will give him her answer in a week and throws herself into his arms, weeping. After some thought, she writes him a letter explaining all that has happened in the past year, leaves it at his camp, and goes home to her mother. Her mother scolds her for telling him everything, but she says that she couldn't live with him in a lie. When he shows up at her door on Sunday, and says that she owes him an answer, Nirmala thinks that he has read her letter and forgiven her, and she agrees happily to marry him. Bansi disguises himself as an astrologer and goes to Ashok's parents, hoping to trick them into agreeing to come for his wedding. The ruse fails, however, and Ashok's father refuses. Ashok and Nirmala get married and go to stay in a hotel on their wedding night. As the newlyweds are about to go to bed, the hotel proprietor knocks on the door and hands Ashok a letter from Bansi. It's about their new house and Nirmala wants to read it; but it also contains her letter, which Bansi found under the carpet when he was packing up the camp. Nirmala is horrified, but gives the letter to Ashok. He reads it and walks away from her, stunned. When she follows him and pleads innocence, he agrees that she is innocent but that she is no longer the same Nirmala he worshipped and alienated his father for; he asks her why she didn't leave the job as soon as she suspected Ranjit's intentions. She leaves and goes home to her mother, hoping that he will come and get her‚Äîbut he doesn't. Back at Ashok's, Bansi confronts him. As weeks pass into months, Nirmala decides to leave her mother's since the neighbors are all gossiping about her prolonged stay. She goes to Nainital, where she gets a job as a governess to a man with seven children. She enjoys the children and her new employer is good to her, but she still longs for Ashok. Her new employer's brother-in-law and niece arrive for a visit, and Nirmala soon realizes that they are Ashok's father and sister. Ashok's sister Sudha befriends Nirmala, not knowing that she is her bhabhi. Then one day as Nirmala is out walking, she hears a holy man over the loudspeakers outside a mosque. His words move her, and she goes in to meet him and get his blessing. It's Ranjit! She flees, but he follows her home and tells her that he is reformed; that after his mother died (she understood very well what kind of man he was) he wandered the world for a bit, and found God, and repented for all his sins. Nirmala tells him bitterly that she doesn't believe him and tells him to leave. A few days later he shows up again. He has transformed himself again from a guru to Ranjit. He tells her that after seeing her, he could not get her out of his mind, and that she is right‚Äîhis sins are too great for him to be a man of God. He wants to live with her and take care of her. She angrily rejects him, but he keeps visiting. Back at his home again, Ashok's father has become very ill, and calls for Ashok to come see him. At the house, Ashok sees a photograph of Nirmala, which his sister had brought with her from Nainital as a memento of their friendship. He tells her that Nirmala is his wife and explains why they are not together. His sister and father convince him to go get her and bring her home. He sets off for Nainital to find Nirmala. Sudha telegrams Nirmala about this, delightedly she awaits for him. But Ashok leaves without meeting Nirmala. Nirmala hears Ashok going and comes out of the house and finds Ranjit, who had whisked Ashok away by telling him a lie that Nirmala is now happily living with him as he obsessively loves her. Nirmala, when she is about to leave to stop Ashok, she is stopped by Ranjit, who says that she belongs to him forever, not Ashok, enraged Nirmala stabs Ranjit to death for ruining her life and separating her from Ashok. As she leaves to stop Ashok, her neighbour witnesses the murder. Nirmala stops Ashok and tells him the truth about Ranjit and confesses her crime. Ashok accepts Nirmala and realises his mistake for not trusting her. He then realises that the police are after Nirmala, and ensures her that he will take the blame on himself, but Nirmala refuses by saying that crime cannot go unpunished, and she will surrender to police in the morning and asks Ashok to spend one last night with her together before police separate them. Then Ashok and Nirmala spend their last night together and consummate their marriage. The film ends as dawn breaks.

The film was rated as above average at the box office. Plot No joy in the world can equal the happiness a man derives from watching his own child at play. Not all the riches in the world can compensate for the vacuum, the emptiness, created by the want of a child in a home. With a woman this yearning is a hundred times stronger and the outcome of her torment impossible beyond measure. Radha belonged to a rich family. Her sole aim in life after becoming a widow, was to see her son Ajit happy and fulfil the promise she had given to her husband that the family name and tradition would be perpetuated. Finding Ajit deeply in love with Shobha, the Raisaheb's daughter who too loved him no less, Radha got them married, hoping that Shobha would prove an ideal wife and daughter-in-law and their home would soon resound with merry laughter of a child, if not children. Three years went by and Radha was still waiting for the new arrival in the family. Her patience was running out. Desperate, she took Shobha to a doctor who, after prolonged examination and treatment, told her that God alone could help her fulfill her yearning for a grandchild. Radha's sorrow knows no bounds. She could not think of the family chain breaking off. She had to have a grandchild and fulfil her promise to her late husband. As a last resort, she takes Shobha to Gurudev, the spiritual soul revered by the family. Gurudev has pity on Radha's plight and after taking her into confidence, tells her the fact that Shobha can never have a child. Shobha after hearing this is left in a state of shock. Being very well aware of her mother-in-law's craving for a grandchild, life seems without a ray of hope for Shobha to live. She decides to put an end to it. It was better that way, she thinks, than to suffer the humiliation of being branded barren forever. She knows how deeply her husband loved her and can very well imagine his dilemma when forced to marry again for the sake of a child. Ultimately, she starts walking in the direction of fatal plunge to end all problems, to end herself. But destiny had other things written down for Shobha. Let that be unfolded on the screen in \\"Chandan Ka Palna\\", lest further knowledge of the proceedings spoil full enjoyment of the drama.

Summary The book, LeBlanc's first, took more than 10 years to research and write. Random Family is a nonfiction account of the struggles of two women and their family as they deal with love, drug dealers, babies and prison time in the Bronx. LeBlanc began the long period of research after reporting on a piece in Newsday about the trial of \\"a hugely successful heroin dealer\\" named Boy George.Robert S. Boynton, The New New Journalism, New York: Random House, 2005. p. 227. Reception Random Family was enthusiastically received by critics. In The New York Times, critic Janet Maslin described LeBlanc's work as \\"a book that exerts the fascination of a classic, unflinching documentary.\\"Robert S. Boynton, The New New Journalism, New York: Random House, 2005. p. 228. Mark Kramer, director of the Nieman Foundation Program on Narrative Journalism at Harvard University, praised the book's \\"relentless neutrality.\\"Amy Farley, In the Family Way,\\" Village Voice, January 28, 2003. In The New York Times Book Review, Margaret Talbot wrote, \\"The conventional compliment to pay a work of narrative nonfiction is to say that it's 'novelistic' or that it 'reads like fiction.' You could certainly say that of 'Random Family,' and yet there are tasks a writer like LeBlanc must accomplish that are different, and in some ways more difficult, than a novelist's. For one thing, she must remain cleareyed about people to whom she owes a tremendous debt of gratitude for admitting her into the intimacies of their lives. And for another, she must hew to a plotline that is often stuttering and circular and decidedly lacking in resolution. None of the people she writes about veer definitively toward a newer or better life ‚Äî they tend toward the same tired grooves ‚Äî yet she makes their stories riveting\\"; Talbot called LeBlanc's work, \\"An extraordinary book.\\"Margaret Talbot, \\"In the Other Country,\\" The New York Times Book Review, February 2, 2009. Awards and honors LeBlanc and Random Family garnered several awards and nominations. Her research methods earned her a spot among several other journalists and nonfiction writers in Robert Boynton's book, The New New Journalism.

The film was released on 22 December 2000. It stars Dharmendra, Shakti Kapoor and Kiran Kumar among many others. It is produced by O. P. Goyal and written by Bashir Babbar, with music by Ghulam Ali Chandar. Plot Shankar (Dharmendra) is an executioner at a local police station. He could sense that an accused Joshi, who was sentenced to death, was an innocent person. Despite of his friend, Inspector Arjun's (Kiran Kumar) attempts to rescue Joshi, Shankar was forced to put him to death. Shankar, unable to bear the trauma, quits his job. Shankar's family consisted of his wife, Kamla and sister, Geeta. There was a severe financial crunch at his place. Other employers wouldn't hire an ex- executioner as they were concerned about their own safety. He helps a group of criminals to find a treasure around his place, but the treasure turned out to be a trickery by an ex-gangman Takla Robert. Shankar puts an end to Takla rescuing the criminals. The criminals were identified as Rapcha, Tillu, Katre and their leader, Shinde. Shinde was actively involved in the trade of arms and ammunition under the protection of Senior Inspector Dolkar (Deepak Shirke). Dolkar, in turn, was helped by a corrupt home minister. In a desperate need for money to pay dowry, he approaches Shinde (Shakti Kapoor) for a job. Shinde frames Shankar for his arms trade and gets arrested by Inspector Arjun himself. The court sentences him to prison. Since then, vengeance against the criminals becomes Shankar's prime objective. Katre (Ishrat Ali) visits Shankar's house and gifts ‚Çπ10,000 to his wife and sister. However, they refuse to take the money. Kamla 's health condition deteriorates and an urgent surgery needs to be performed for which the fee is ‚Çπ10,000. Geeta approaches Katre for money. Katre, however, molests Geeta and rapes her. Geeta, unable to bear the trauma, consumes poison. Kamla is killed in the hospital bed by the corrupt home minister.

A neo-romantic, Faith has always been first and foremost a melodist. Biography Richard Bruce Faith was born on March 20, 1926, in Evansville, Indiana. His mother was a homemaker active in community affairs, and his father, a dentist. Both parents were very supportive of his choice to become a musician as they too came from musical backgrounds. Faith's mother studied piano before her five children were born; his father picked up musical skills without a teacher and played piano, violin and sang in the church choir. Around age eight, Richard began to study piano with his fifteen-year-old cousin and he soon began improvising melodies on the keyboard. Between the ages of eleven and twelve he began writing down his piano compositions, one of which later became a work for women's chorus entitled \\"Daffodils\\" (I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud) with poetry by William Wordsworth.Lavonis, William. \\"The Songs of Richard Faith.\\" DMA Thesis, University of Cincinnati, 1992 Before his natural bent toward composing could take root and grow, Faith embarked on a career as a concert pianist. In 1940 at age fourteen, he appeared with the Evansville Philharmonic Orchestra, and after a few years of study he entered Chicago Musical College, where he received both undergraduate and master's degrees in piano performance. At age nineteen he placed in a collegiate contest and was given the opportunity to perform in Chicago's Orchestra Hall. The work was Chopin's Concerto in F Minor (Op.21). This was followed in 1947 by his professional debut at Kimball Hall (Chicago) and, in 1948, by a return to Orchestra Hall for a solo recital and an engagement with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. During the early fifties Faith concertized as a recital accompanist for both singers and instrumentalists in programs that included his own compositions. Faith's first instructor in composition was Max Wald, with whom he worked from 1947 to 1949. In the Fall of 1954 he began doctoral work in composition at Indiana University in Bloomington with Bernhard Heiden. Two years later Faith received his first full-time teaching appointment at Morningside College in Sioux City, Iowa. Although he was devoted to teaching piano, his great love for composition continued to flourish. In 1960 he went to Rome as a Fulbright Scholar, studying both piano and composition with Guido Agosti at the Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia. He chose Italy because of his interest in Italian history and its early Renaissance art. He also was seeking the \\"clarity of Italian musical expression.\\" Faith spent the greatest part of his life at the University of Arizona in Tucson, where he assumed the position of Assistant Professor of Music (Piano) in 1961. He remained at the school until 1988, with an interim year at Morningside College in 1968. Many of his most popular compositions are the fruits of his tenure at Arizona: songs, choral works, piano concertos, orchestral and chamber works and opera. Faith's first published work was the \\"Legend for Piano,\\" printed by Summy-Birchard in 1967. Shawnee Press began publishing his compositions in 1968, followed by G.Schirmer Inc. in 1971 and Belwin Mills in 1974. In the late 1970s Faith's music achieved significant recognition with performances in London, Washington, D.C., and Tucson, and commercial recordings were released. From 1982 to 1988 he received annual awards from the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP). Since his retirement from teaching in 1988, Richard Faith relocated from Tucson a number of times: to Washington, D.C., California, back to his home town of Evansville, to Denver, a return to Tucson briefly and in 2015 made his home in Savoy, Illinois where he continues to compose and give piano recitals at his retirement community. During the last 30 years performances, publications, dissertations and recordings of his works have flourished. To date he has written over 57 chamber works, 21 choral arrangements, 4 operas, 16 orchestral pieces, 61 keyboard works and over 121 songs, including an unofficial contribution to the AIDS Quilt Songbook with his \\"Winter Journey,\\" with poetry by William Lavonis. Musical Style and Songs Faith's music displays a freely modulating harmonic language within the boundaries of tonality that combines neo-romantic and impressionistic qualities. With Debussy, Ravel, and Rachmaninoff as important influences on his music, and Brahms as a model with respect to form, Faith also shares musical traits with Vaughan Williams, particularly in the areas of modality and harmonic color and with Roger Quilter, the Victorian whose songs displayed a trait known as \\"decorous Romanticism.\\" Faith's English flavor is even further highlighted by the composer's choice of poetry, much of which comes from British authors. Faith's song output spans the years 1944 to the present‚Äîhis entire life as a composer. The over 120 settings run the stylistic gamut from sophisticated concert pieces to simple miniatures, duets, vocalises and selections with obbligato instruments, including flute, cello, viola and harp. His settings are generally for medium voice. Some have been written for specific singers to whom he has dedicated the music. Many of the songs are grouped according to subject matter, but are not necessarily musically connected. They may be sung as sets or separately, and may be transposed to suit the singer. Faith's tempo indications use traditional Italian terminology and the metronome markings are only suggestions. He is a gracious composer who allows individuals to develop their own interpretations of his music.Lavonis, William. \\"The Songs of Richard Faith.\\" The NATS Journal, Sept/Oct, 1994 Because Faith himself is an award-winning pianist, many of the songs have sophisticated accompaniments. Sometimes the piano doubles the voice, though hardly ever through an entire piece. At other times the piano will play a countermelody to the voice to form a kind of obbligato. Like Debussy, Faith has a fondness for triplets, because of the movement and flow they add to a song. Thomas Nashe's \\"Spring, the Sweet Spring\\" (1950) is an exercise in perpetual motion for the accompanist, with only brief repose at the end of each stanza. This inventive, florid accompaniment, along with Faith's strict use of ABA form, thin texture, and a definite key signature (G) lend a neo- baroque character to this Elizabethan poem. The harmony, however, remains contemporary, with Faith's use of incidental chromatics and added-note chords. Like many composers who rely on modality rather than tonality, Faith rarely uses key signatures. His harmonic idiom displays a changing palette of colors marked by simultaneous cross-relations, the Lydian sharped fourth, and combinations of this sharped fourth and Mixolydian flatted seventh. Faith has denied any desire to pursue more avant-garde idioms.Faith, Richard. Interview by William Lavonis. January 3‚Äì4, 1991, Reston, Va. Tape recording Earlier experiments in progressive styles met with little success, and if anything beyond the romantic exists in Faith's music, it may be the influence of Hindemith which was furthered by his studies at Indiana University with Bernhard Heiden, himself a Hindemith pupil. Traces of this influence can be discerned in the appearance of quartal/quintal harmony in many of the songs. This is seen in \\"The Blackbird\\" by the Victorian author William Ernest Henley composed in 1955. The accompaniment begins with broken ninth and tenth intervals supported by mildly dissonant chords; it is then followed by a hocket-like passage. This underlying texture continues through the first half of the song, contrasting with legato vocal melody. Faith's use of arch form or \\"coming full circle\\" reflects the influence of Brahms, whose many songs fall into this structural category. He may end with a literal repeat, a transposed portion, or only a fragment of A, and may repeat text, music, or both in the process. Arch form is also reflected in the use of dynamics. Many songs begin quietly, reach a climax in an interior section, and then end as they began. The composer's selection of poetry brings to the foreground some of literature's most famous writers in works that in this day and age have been unjustly neglected by the general public: Conrad Aiken, Edward Lear, Charles Cotton, and Christina Rossetti, to name a few. That Faith is well read is apparent not only in his choice of fine poetry to set to music, but also in his allusions to literature in many of his instrumental works. In addition, he often selects longer poems than would be considered usual for a song and writes few miniatures. The success of setting a lengthy piece of verse seems to depend upon Faith's ability to delay the listener's climactic expectations by moving through harmonic ambiguity until reaching an emotionally charged section that merits a cadence‚Äîusually on open sonorities without the thirds. This event may repeat itself many times with a greater or lesser dynamic level, thereby expanding his music resources. Faith's songs adhere strictly to the rhythm dictated by the text of the poem. In fact, he simultaneously composes both melody and accompaniment by singing the text and playing the keyboard and immediately writing it down. Faith's adherence to the text rhythm results in shifting meters to accommodate phrases of varying length and text- derived rhythmic figures often provide the basis for his accompaniments For subject matter Faith prefers nature imagery over love poetry and until 1994 with his Mother Goose Rhymes, there had been only one comical song‚ÄîEdward Lear's \\"The Owl and the Pussycat,\\" written in 1960. Many of Faith's settings reflect the nationality of the poet and the time period in which the poem was written. For example, Four Love Songs on Elizabethan lyrics (1982) display thin textures, balanced forms, and traditional harmonic progressions, while the Jean de La Ville de Mirmont :fr:Jean de La Ville de Mirmont songs have a French character that reveals Faith's debt to Ravel and Debussy. More recently, Faith's songs on Moorish poetry evoke an exotic, middle eastern quality. In the beautiful setting of Ben Jonson's \\"To Celia\\" (commonly known as \\"Drink to Me Only with Thine Eyes\\"), Faith, by stressing the poem's inherent passion, brings a fresh outlook to a lyric which had become too familiar in arrangements of the old English setting. He achieves this through an operatically conceived vocal line: high and sustained, and encompassing a range of an octave and a fifth. Two works that do not necessarily fall into specific stylistic categories, but deserve mention nonetheless, are Percy Bysshe Shelley's \\"Music When Soft Voices Die\\" and the miniature \\"Remember Me\\" by the Victorian Christina Rossetti. The spontaneous quality of the Shelley song reveals the poem's great effect on Faith, who, after nearly two years without song writing (1957), produced one of his most frequently performed pieces. The introduction's angular, twisting melody, taken later by the vocal line, lends a troubled, unsettling quality to the lyric. \\"Remember Me\\" was written in 1954 and is unusual for its brevity. The poet, Christina Rossetti, was an Englishwoman of Italian descent and is best known for her words to the hymns \\"In the Bleak Mid-Winter\\" and \\"Love Came Down at Christmas.\\" Faith set three more of her poems which are included in the first published volume of songs by Leyerle Publications.Faith, Richard. The Songs of Richard Faith. Volumes I, II, III. Geneseo, NY: Leyerle Publications, 1993, 1997, 2001. Many of Faith's songs have themes related to the sea, and there are a number of others in which the sea figures as an integral element in the poem. This stems from the composer\\"s extreme fascination with water, having been raised near the high banks of the wide Ohio River in Evansville, Indiana. \\"Sea Fever\\" (John Masefield), one of Faith's few biographically-influenced songs, displays such a depth of emotion rare for a nineteen-year-old. It is an important early song because it established many compositional techniques to which the composer returned throughout his lyrical output. Another \\"sea\\" example is \\"Ships\\" an English translation of \\"Vaisseaux, nous vous aurons aim√©s\\" by Jean de la Ville de Mirmont :fr:Jean de La Ville de Mirmont, the French World War I poet killed in action in 1914. This poem was also set by Faur√© in that composer's final song cycle L'horizon chim√©rique. Faith's song is scored for cello obbligato, piano, and female voice. Faith skillfully translates into music the emotions behind the words of the world's greatest authors. Although many of his songs display common characteristics, each reveals an approach that allows the poem's individuality to shine through. Performers of art song, both singers and pianists, will appreciate Faith's output, considering the variety of poems he set to music and the gracious way he treats the voice and piano in his neo-romantic/impressionistic manner. Somewhat reticent of theoretical discussions, however, Faith considers himself only to be a composer of the heart, who relies on his musical gifts to bring joy to others.

The work is generally dated from between Gentile's quick stay in his hometown, Fabriano, in the Spring of 1420, and his arrival to Florence in the following summer. There are indeed similarities with the female faces in the Adoration of the Magi, although the presence of copies by local followers in the Marche and Dalmatia could imply that the painting was at some location in the Adriatic Sea area. Description The scene is a combination of the traditional iconography of the Nativity of Jesus in art and that of the Madonna of Humility, with Mary portrayed in the foreground while sitting on a lawn. In the background are also Joseph (left, sleeping in order to underline his marginal role in the birth of Jesus), the hut with the donkey and the ox and, farther behind, the annunciation to the shepherds. The embroideries in Mary's cloak there are several inscriptions, reading: \\"Ave Mater Digna Dei Ven[...] Ben[...]\\", on the right edge \\"Salve Regina Mater Mis[ericordiae]\\", on the left edge \\"Ave Maris Ste[lla] Dei Mater Alma Atque [...]\\" and, on the lower edge, \\"Ave Maria Gratia Plena Do[minu]s Tecum Benedi[ctu in] Mulieribus\\". Typical examples of Gentile's attention to detail are the lawn in the foreground and the rendering of the decoration of Jesus' sheet.

Greenqloud develops and sells the cloud and infrastructure management software Qstack for the global market. History Founded in 2010, the company initially sold public cloud computing services, such as web hosting and data storage, marketed as infrastructure as a service (IaaS), powered by data centers using 100% renewable energy in Iceland. Most hosting companies buy carbon offset credits as a green marketing measure, and host data at multiple data centers on different continents as the solution for international sites. Early on, Greenqloud began building upon the software startup cloud.com, which later became Apache CloudStack. When Jonsi Stefansson joined as CEO in 2014 the company was pivoted to a pure software company with 100% focus on building and developing the cloud management platform Qstack. In 2015 the company released Qstack, to be deployed on private and hybrid environments. In 2016, Qstack already supported leading hypervisors, including VMware, KVM and Hyper-V and bare metal provisioning. In early 2017, Qstack will add container-based Application Orchestration support with an integrated Kubernetes server, allowing its users the ability deploy microservices and workloads on scalable clusters.

One of every four high school graduates cannot pass the basic military entrance exam. Couple that with high obesity and rise of criminal records means there is a much lower chance of getting military recruits. Despite these obstacles recruitment numbers are hitting their marks. The economic crisis is giving way to more willing recruits and many of them have one of the key measures to join, a high school diploma. Still the ineligibility rates some military leaders say are, \\"a matter of national security\\". The Recruiter takes viewers to the Louisiana coast, where they witness firsthand Sergeant First Class Clay Usie's struggle to enlist new soldiers into the U.S. Army in his hometown of Houma, Louisiana. Sgt. Usie believes that every American should serve their country and he sets his sights on Lauren, Matt, Bobby, and Chris, four teenagers who think that the Army is the answer for them. Shot in verite style over a nine-month period the film shows the new recruits in their last semesters of high school as they prepare with Sgt. Usie for boot camp. After graduation, the film follows three of the four teenagers to basic training where they make the transition from civilians to soldiers. (The fourth teenager, Chris, was shipped out to Iraq early due to high casualties in the war.) The hardships that come with being in the army begin to arise at basic training. One girl has a massive panic attack, while some of the boys try to fake being gay in order to be discharged under \\"don't ask, don't tell\\". Once basic training is complete, the film follows Matt and Lauren back to Houma for their one-month leave before they ship out to Iraq and/or Afghanistan. Bobby, who was selected to join special forces, continues his training. The Recruiter wraps up with epilogues of where each soldier is now.

To increase the realism of the game's flight simulation, the developers extensively utilized the Super NES's Mode 7 capability, which mimics 3D graphics by rotating and scaling flat objects. The game was well received upon its release, largely thanks to its graphical presentation. The game has since been re-released on the Virtual Console service for both the Wii, Wii U and the New Nintendo 3DS consoles in PAL regions, North America, and Japan. A sequel, Pilotwings 64, was released for the Nintendo 64 in 1996. After many years of announcements and cancellations, Nintendo unveiled a second sequel, Pilotwings Resort, for the Nintendo 3DS handheld at the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) 2010 which released in 2011. = Pilotwings 64 = is a video game for the Nintendo 64, originally released in 1996 along with the debut of the console. The game was co- developed by Nintendo EAD (who developed the original game) and the American visual technology group Paradigm Simulation. It was one of three launch titles for the Nintendo 64 in Japan as well as Europe and one of two launch titles in North America. Pilotwings 64 is a follow-up to Pilotwings for the Super NES, which was a North American launch game for its respective console in 1991. Also like that game, Pilotwings 64 received production input from Nintendo producer and EAD General Manager Shigeru Miyamoto. Pilotwings 64 is a 3D amateur flight simulator that puts the player in control of one of six pilots as they try to earn pilot licenses through various forms of aviation. The events are flying an autogyro, using a jet pack, and hang gliding. Several bonus tasks are offered, such as skydiving and a human cannonball test. The game also puts focus on allowing the player to freely explore its detailed 3D environments, most notably a miniature representation of the United States. The game received positive review scores and praise from gaming publications and news sources alike for its visual presentation and flying controls. Similar to its Super NES predecessor, Pilotwings 64 serves to demonstrate the graphical capabilities of its gaming hardware. Although the flight simulator did not enjoy the same commercial success as its fellow launch game Super Mario 64, Pilotwings 64 nonetheless went on to sell over one million copies worldwide. = Pilotwings Resort = is an amateur flight simulation video game for the Nintendo 3DS handheld game console, developed by Monster Games and published by Nintendo. It is a sequel to the 1990 Super NES game Pilotwings and the 1996 Nintendo 64 game Pilotwings 64, and takes inspiration from the 2009 Wii game Wii Sports Resort. Similarly to its predecessors, it was confirmed as a launch title in North America and Europe. In Japan, Australia, and New Zealand it was released on April 14, 2011. Nintendo re- released the game, along with some of their earlier, published games for the Nintendo 3DS, as a downloadable title via Nintendo eShop. The downloadable version became available on November 1, 2012 in Japan, November 22, 2012 in the PAL region, and December 20, 2012 in North America.

The stagnation or decline since the 70s is often cited as an example of the Great Regression The Great Regression refers to worsening economic conditions affecting lower earning sections of the population in the United States, Western Europe and other advanced economies starting around 1981. These deteriorating conditions include rising inequality; and falling or stagnating wages, pensions, unemployment insurance, and welfare benefits. The decline in these conditions has been by no means uniform. Specific trends vary depending on the metric being tracked, the country, and which specific demographic is being examined. For most advanced economies, the worsening economic conditions affecting the less well off accelerated sharply after the Late-2000s recession. The Great Regression contrasts with the \\"Great Prosperity\\" or Golden Age of Capitalism, where from the late 1940s to mid 1970s, economic growth delivered benefits which were broadly shared across the earnings spectrums, with inequality falling as the poorest sections of society increased their incomes at a faster rate than the richest. Examples U.S. productivity and average real earnings, 1947‚Äì2008 from the Bureau of Labor Statistics Some of the trends making up the great regression pre-date 1981. Such as stagnating wages for production and non- supervisory workers in the U.S. private sector; real wages for these workers peaked in 1973. Or the divergence in increases of productivity and pay for such workers: these two factors tended to increase in \\"lock-step\\" until about 1973, but then diverged sharply, with productivity increasing massively over the following decades, while pay stagnated. The break down of Bowley's law, the apparently near fixed proportion of economic output going to workers, is another enduring change which began around the mid 1970s. Looking at general household income, declines only became widespread in the 21st century. A McKinsey study released in 2016 and looking at 25 of the advanced economies found that only 2% of households failed to enjoy an income rise in the period from 1993 to 2005 . Yet for the period from 2005 to 2014, a much higher percentage of households saw their incomes either fall or remain stagnant: for Italy this percentage was 97%, for the U.S. 80%, 70% for G.B. & the Netherlands, and 63% for France. Looking at income growth for the bottom 90%, Australia has been something of an exception to the falling or stagnating 21st century wages affecting most advanced economies. Another exception to the acceleration in the worsening of these conditions in the 21st century appears when one looks at real hourly wage growth for U.S. workers with at most high school level education. In this case, according to a Harvard report, the decline in wages was sharper from 1979-2000 than it was from 2000-2012. Effects Some demographic groups experiencing low incomes have suffered decreased life expectancies during the great regression. For example, a study suggested that between 1990 and 2008, white American women without high school diploma lost five years from their life expectancy, while for white American men who dropped out of high school, the loss was three years. Social scientists have not yet arrived at consensus whether these declines are caused by harsher economic conditions or to other factors such as increases in smoking or obesity. Low pay and precarious employment has been linked to increased risk of anxiety and other mental health problems. After an individual has experienced precarious employment, anxiety can persist even if they return to a permanent job. =Political rage= The great regression has contributed to the so-called \\"politics of rage\\", a phenomenon associated with declining trust for centrist political parties. Political rage has seen increased support for anti-establishment and populist causes and parties, of both the right and left. While this trend has been underway for several years, it became especially high profile in 2016. Examples include support for Brexit, Donald Trump, Podemos, the Five Star Movement and AfD. While inequality and increased economic hardship has been widely accepted as a cause of political rage, including by the G20, analysts from Barclays have expressed skepticism, saying this is only \\"weakly supported by the available data.\\" Causes The great regression has been blamed on globalisation, with staff in the advanced economies facing increased competition from much less well paid workers from the developing world. Professor Robert Reich however considers the main cause to be political, with the rich better able to influence politics. The great regression has largely coincided with decreasing bargaining power for workers, which itself partly results from the falling influence of unions. Especially since 2013, the adverse economic trends have been increasingly blamed on technological unemployment, and with recently increased uptake of robots and automation in the emergencing economies, there are concerns that workers there too may soon suffer from the great regression. Since 1980, under Reaganomics, there has been a decline of the progressive income tax leading to a rise in inequality. Possible end of the great regression Data released in October 2016 found that in 2015, the trends for low earners to suffer further declines in income had reversed in the U.S., G.B. and much of continental Europe. The recent income gains for lower paid workers have been credited partly on increases in the minimum wage.

Lechmere joined the navy and saw service during the American War of Independence, having been promoted to lieutenant in 1774, and then to commander in 1782. He was given his own ship, a sloop, and served off the North American coast for the remainder of the war, until paying off the ship in 1785. He spent time ashore during the years of peace, marrying and receiving a promotion to post captain before the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars. He returned to service in 1794 and commanded several ships in British waters. During this time he assisted in the transport of Princess Caroline of Brunswick to Britain. He then spent some time on the Halifax station, but like many of his contemporaries he struggled at times to secure postings, and spent some time without a ship. He was back in command of a ship in 1805, and saw action at the Battle of Cape Finisterre with Sir Robert Calder's fleet, an action that had a significant impact on his life. Although he went on to join the fleet assembling off Cadiz under Lord Nelson, he agreed to return to Britain to support Calder at his court-martial, leaving the fleet a week before the Battle of Trafalgar. His first lieutenant, John Stockham, instead commanded his ship and received a share of the rewards. Lechmere had missed one of the most decisive battles of his career, but he went on to command other ships and receive further promotions, eventually dying at the close of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815. Family and early life Lechmere was born in 1752, the son of Richard Lechmere and his wife Elizabeth, n√©e Corfield. He was the nephew of Nicholas Lechmere, 1st Baron Lechmere. William joined the Royal Navy and was commissioned as a lieutenant on 20 December 1774. He served during the American War of Independence, being promoted to commander on 23 September 1782 and appointed to command the sloop . Thorn had been recently recaptured from the Americans, and Lechmere sailed her to Britain and paid her off for repairs and refitting at Sheerness Dockyard. He recommissioned her in April 1783 and sailed to Newfoundland in May 1784. He later returned to Britain, but was back at Newfoundland in April 1785, before Thorn was paid off in November 1785. Interwar and return to service Lechmere took advantage of the peace and married Elizabeth, the daughter of Sir John Dashwood-King, at St Martin-in-the-Fields, Westminster on 31 October 1787. He was promoted to post captain on 21 September 1790, but it was not until August 1794, after the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars, that he took up his first independent command, the 74-gun . Lechmere commanded Saturn in the Downs as the flagship of Rear-Admiral George Vandeput. He was transferred to the 50-gun in January 1795, and remained in command of her until February 1796. During this time Jupiter flew the broad pennant of Commodore John Willett Payne and also served as a Royal escort for Princess Caroline of Brunswick. Princess Caroline left from Cuxhaven on 28 March 1795 in the Jupiter and, delayed by poor weather, landed at Greenwich on 5 April. Lechmere took command of the 64-gun in 1796, during which time she was the flagship of Vice-Admiral George Vandeput on the Halifax station. He went out to Lisbon in February 1797 and there captured the Spanish privateer Atrebedo on 28 February. He moved to the 74-gun in July 1797 and resumed his previous duties as commander of Vandeput's flagship at Halifax. He commanded Resolution until paying her off in October 1798. He then appears to have been unemployed for a period, as he is not recorded in command of a ship until April 1805, when he superseded Captain William Bedford, and commissioned the 74-gun . Present at Finisterre, absent at Trafalgar William Anderson Thunderer was assigned to the fleet under Admiral Robert Calder, tasked with intercepting the Franco-Spanish fleet under Vice-Admiral Pierre-Charles Villeneuve as it returned from the Caribbean. Calder intercepted the combined fleet and brought them to battle on 22 July 1805. Thunderer was involved in the fighting as the second to last ship in Calder's line, and had seven men killed and eleven wounded. Thunderer, and several of the frigates had drifted some six miles distant of the admiral on the morning of 23 July, and took no part in the second indecisive clash of the battle. The fleets then parted, with Calder's force sailing to the north with the prizes, where they met the fleet arriving from the West Indies under Lord Nelson. After sending several ships, including Thunderer, into port, Calder sailed south to join Vice- Admiral Cuthbert Collingwood off Cadiz. While refitting, Lechmere received orders to join Collingwood at Cadiz, and on repairs being completed, joined Vice-Admiral Nelson's 100-gun and the 36-gun under Captain Henry Blackwood off Plymouth and sailed for Cadiz. Calder had been criticised for failing to win a decisive victory, and on arriving off Cadiz and assuming command of the fleet, Nelson passed on the Admiralty's orders to Calder which summoned him back to Britain to face a court martial. Nelson was also required to allow those captains who had fought with Calder and wished to give evidence in his support to return to England to give evidence at his court-martial. Lechmere was one of those who agreed to go, as did Captain William Brown of . Brown and Lechmere handed command of their ships temporarily over to their first lieutenants, John Pilfold and John Stockham respectively, and sailed for Britain with Calder on 14 October, five days before the combined fleet sailed from Cadiz, and seven days before the Battle of Trafalgar took place. Consequently Lechmere was absent when the battle took place, and Stockham instead received a share of the rewards of a grateful nation, being promoted to post captain, while Lechmere was overlooked. Later commands Despite having missed his opportunity to take part in the decisive naval battle of the wars, Lechmere received several other commands, taking over the 98-gun in the Mediterranean on 13 April 1806, and commanding her until her return to Plymouth in October that year. He was appointed a Colonel of Marines on 6 October 1806. His final seagoing command was the 98-gun , which he took over on 26 December 1806 and commanded in the English Channel until his promotion to rear-admiral of the blue on 28 April 1808. He does not appear to have ever raised his flag, but continued to be promoted. He was advanced to rear-admiral of the red on 31 July 1810, vice-admiral of the blue on 12 August 1812, and finally vice-admiral of the white on 4 June 1814. Vice-Admiral William Lechmere died at Hill House, Steeple Aston, Oxfordshire on 12 December 1815 at the age of 63. He had had a number of children, several of whom followed him into the navy. Among them was his eldest son, Charles, who was born on 4 December 1789 and died in command of off the West African coast on 9 November 1822. One of his daughters, Mary, married James Saumarez, son of the naval officer James Saumarez, 1st Baron de Saumarez. His daughter Lucy (1788-1834) married Richard Parkinson, of Kinnersley Castle, and was mother of the artist and photographer Amelia Elizabeth Guppy and grandmother of the naturalist Robert John Lechmere Guppy.

The kit was supplied with two fuselage halves and the tail parts only, leaving it up to the builder to secure the Spatz wings and engine to finish the aircraft. The finished aircraft is of mixed construction with a fibreglass fuselage and wood and doped aircraft fabric wings. The span wings are mounted on a short pylon above the fuselage, although other sailplane wings can be employed in place of the Spatz wings. The specified K√∂nig SC 430 radial engine is mounted in pusher configuration behind the wing and above the tail boom, although other similar engines can be used. The aircraft features tricycle landing gear and a cockpit bubble canopy. In 1998 the basic kit was US$4400 and included just the fuselage halves and tail.

His areas of specialisation in philosophy were chiefly metaphysics and pedagogy. Life =Beginnings= Camilleri was born at Sliema, Malta, on November 10, 1906.For other biographical details, see also Eugenio and . Since his family lived very close to the Salesian oratory there, he was familiar with the Salesians from a very tender age. He joined them at the young age of fifteen, in 1921, and immediately sent to Sicily to continue his studies at San Gregorio di Catania. He studied there up till 1926, when subsequently he was enrolled at the Jesuit Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome to pursue his institutional studies for the priesthood. There he successfully completed his philosophy (1926‚Äì29) and theology (1931‚Äì35) courses. Between the two (1929‚Äì31), he was sent for a short stint to Sicily to teach at San Gregorio di Catania. He was ordained a priest in Malta in 1934. =Pre-war and war periods= After finishing his studies in Rome, Camilleri was sent to Rome, to the Salesian oratory situated close to the Catacombs of San Callisto. Here he was appointed professor of theology and Prefect of Studies. Camilleri stayed there for two years, until 1937. He was afterwards sent to teach moral theology at the Don Bosco International Institute at the Crocetta, Turin. Here he stayed for another two years, at the end of which he successfully completed his doctorate in theology. In 1940, when Italy entered World War II on the Axis side, Camilleri was interned, since, as a Maltese citizen, he was a British subject. He spent the war period in the north of Italy, first at Chieri (1940‚Äì42), then at Montalenghe (1942‚Äì45). At Chieri he was Director of the Salesian theology students; at Montalenghe, Dean of the Faculty of Philosophy. =At Turin, Rome and death= After the end of the war, Camilleri was back at Turin as Dean of the Faculty of Theology at the Salesian Pontifical University. He stayed in this office for nine years (1945‚Äì54), teaching dogmatic theology and asceticism. Afterwards, at the same university, he taught at the Institute of Pedagogy and Religious Studies (later, in 1956, called the Faculty of Educational Sciences) eleven years, up till 1965. At the close of that academic year (1964‚Äì65), the whole of the Turin branch of the university was assimilated by the Rome branch. Thus Camilleri continued to teach at Salesian Pontifical University in Rome for another year, retiring from his teaching profession due to ill health in 1966.. He died in Rome in 1973, in aura sanctitatis (in fame of holiness). He was buried at the Cemetery of Genzano in Rome within the chapel of the Salesians. =Sainthood= Twenty- one years after Camilleri‚Äôs death, in 1994, the Salesians began the process for his canonisation. The so-called Evidential Statements of Witness to his heroic virtues were published in 1989. Camilleri bears the title of Venerable. Works =Unpublished Journal= Between September 1923 and February 1973 (nine days before his death), Camilleri held a diary which was never intended to be published or even read by others. Its Italian publishers call it Diario Intimo (Intimate Journal). Unfortunately, only short extracts of this remarkable document have ever been published. It runs over twenty-eight registers containing in all some four thousand pages. They are held at the archives of the Salesian Pontifical University in Rome. =Representative writings= The following works are probably the most representative works of Camilleri‚Äôs philosophical thought and speculation. * 1949 ‚Äì De Ineffabili Essentia Metaphysica Libertatis (Concerning the Essential Transcendental Metaphysics of Freedom). A 55-page book in Latin published in Turin. The main thesis in this work is that freedom is a relationship which is intentionally chosen. However, at the same time, freedom suffers no change in itself. * 1958 ‚Äì Una Tesi Antiprobabilista (An Anti-Probabilistic Thesis). A 33-page book in Italian published in Turin. The work is a philosophical-moral investigation on the problem of probabilism. * 1965 ‚Äì Relazionismo Co-Ontologico (Co- Ontological Relationships). A 72-page article published in the book De Deo: Praelecitonum Selectio (Concerning God: A choice of articles) in Rome. This is purely metaphysical work which investigates the qualities and the most intimate and profound nature of the relationship between creation and the creator. In other words, it is a study of the metaphysical (or radical) relationship between beings and absolute being. * Undated ‚Äì De ‚ÄòAdoptiva‚Äô nostra Filiatione Divina (Our ‚ÄòAdoptive‚Äô Divine Sonship). A manuscript held at the Salesian Pontifical University in RomeUPS, 2-C-2599. typed by Camilleri himself. It is basically 105 pages of class notes in which, apart from fundamental issues, Camilleri deals with the communication of divine life to humans through Jesus Christ. =Other works= The following are the other published works of Camilleri. Though no review is provided here, any one of these works might be of interest to philosophy, especially for a holistic view of Camilleri‚Äôs philosophy. * 1944 ‚Äì De Natura Actus Visionis Beatific√¶ (Concerning the Nature of the Actual Beatific Vision; unpublished) * 1951 ‚Äì Preparazione specifica all‚ÄôApostolato dell‚ÄôEducazione (The Specific Preparation needed for Educational Apostolate) * 1953 ‚Äì Confessori Educatori (Educational Confessors) * 1957 ‚Äì Da Mihi Animas (Offering My Own Soul) * 1957 ‚Äì L‚ÄôEx-Allievo Salesiano Provveduto (Supplying the Salesian Ex-Student) * 1958 ‚Äì La Devozione Mariana nel Santo Adoloscente Domenico Savio (The Marian Devotion of the Adolescent Saint Dominic Savio) * 1959 ‚Äì Defensor Putitatis (The Defender of Purity) * 1960 ‚Äì Principi di Pedagogia Cristiana (Principles of Christian Pedagogy) * 1961 ‚Äì The Problem of Teenage Purity * 1961 ‚Äì I Novissimi e la Comunione dei Santi (The End of Times and the Communion of Saints) * 1962 ‚Äì La Maestra delle Novizie (The Superior of Female Novices) * 1962 ‚Äì La Grande Indulgenza del Lavoro (The Great Indulgence of Labour) * 1962 ‚Äì Spirito e Opera della S. Maria D. Mazzarello (The Spirit and Work of St. Mary D. Mazzarello) * 1963 ‚Äì Teologia Pneumatica della Prudenza Cristiana (The Spiritual Theology of Christian Prudence) * 1964 ‚Äì Il Direttore Salesiano (The Salesian Director) * 1966 ‚Äì Teologia e Liturgia (Theology and Liturgy) * 1967 ‚Äì Costituzione Dogmatica sopra la Chiesa; Decreto sopra le Chiese Orientali Cattoliche (The Dogmatic Constitution on the Church; [and] the Decree on the Eastern Catholic Churches [of the Second Vatican Council]) * 1967 ‚Äì La Chiesa nel Mondo Contemporaneo; L‚ÄôApostolato dei Laici; I Mezzi della Comunicazione Sociale (The Church in the Modern World; the Apostolate of the Laity; [and] the Media of Social Communications [of the Second Vatican Council]) =Articles= Camilleri published some 360 articles. These have still not been classified or compiled, much less studied or analysed. The articles were published in journals such as the following: Abroad Salesianum, Orientamenti Pedagogici, Rivista di Pedagogia e Scienze Religiose, Perfice Munus, Doctor Communis, Catechesi, Didascalia, Settimana del Clero, Meridiano 12, Rivista dei Giovani, Presenza Cristiana (Catania), Bollettino Salesiano, Voci Fraterne, Le Campagnie, Can Roma, Teatro dei Giovani, Il Salesiano Coadiutore, Unione, L‚ÄôOsservatore Romano, Il Nostro Tempo, and Il Popolo Nuovo. In Malta Buttlettin Salesjan, Lehen is-Sewwa, Il-Hajja, The Future, Times of Malta, Il Ponte, and Malta. Appreciation The intellectual, professional and practical work of Camilleri was all related to education, particularly the youth education. Well known for his personal holiness, Camilleri possesses a formidable speculative mind. In his teaching and writings he communicates the security and finesse he encountered in the philosophy and theology of scholasticism linked, however, to the insights and sensibleness he read in the documents of the Second Vatican Council. Camilleri cherished a deep affection for the thinking of Thomas Aquinas, and desired that his students learn to read him attentively and interpret him faithfully. Camilleri was no arid or repetitive Thomist. Intellectually, he harboured an active mind. In this some compared him to Antonio Rosmini. On the other hand, Camilleri was not attracted to positive research for its own sake. He always seems to have seen his philosophical studies in the context of concrete life, particularly the Christian way of life. His objectives were speculative, one might say, but always at the service of practicality. Much research and study is still to be done on the philosophy of Camilleri. Though the outlines are known, the specific knowledge of his philosophy is as yet unidentified.

The following year, trainer Larry Sterling entered him in the San Marcos Handicap, a race of a mile and an eighth on dirt. Under jockey Darrel McHargue, Vigors won easily then with the same rider followed up with a win in the San Antonio Stakes in track record time on dirt. In the most important win of his career, Darrel McHargue brought Vigors from dead last to win the Santa Anita Handicap by two lengths, again on dirt.

A single example was built and entered into the 1912 British Military Aeroplane Competition but crashed during the trials and was destroyed. Design and development In 1909, W P Thompson of Formby, Lancashire set up Planes Limited to develop his ideas for aeroplane design, commissioning Frederick Handley Page to build a pusher configuration biplane based on his ideas, the Handley Page Type B, with much of the detailed design work for the Type B was carried out by Handley Page or by Thompson's assistant, Robert C Fenwick. Early testing of the Type B proved unsuccessful, and Handley Page abandoned the aircraft unflown. After further modification by Fenwick at Planes Limited's works at Freshfield, Formby, the aircraft flew successfully in November 1910.Bruce 1982, p. 31.Barnes 1976, pp. 64‚Äì65. Fenwick and Sydney T Swabey designed a second aircraft for Planes Limited in 1911, this being a single-engined pusher monoplane powered by a 45 hp (34 kW) Isaacson radial engine, which was mounted in the aircraft's nose, driving a two-bladed propeller by a long extension shaft. The pilot and passenger sat side-by side in the fuselage nacelle, which was mounted below the aircraft's wing, with the propeller shaft passing between them. The tail surfaces were carried on two steel tube booms, while the aircraft's undercarriage consisted of two mainwheels and long skids designed to prevent the aircraft turning over onto its nose in the event of a rough landing.Bruce 1982, pp. 31‚Äì32.Flight 17 August 1912, pp. 755‚Äì756. The remains of Fenwick's aircraft after the crash. The monoplane first flew in late 1911. In April 1912, Fenwick and Swabey set up their own company, The Mersey Aeroplane Company, purchasing the monoplane from Planes Limited and continuing to operate from their works at Freshfield. It was flown frequently in the spring of 1912, often carrying passengers, including the 70-year-old Thompson, who was believed to be the oldest person to have flown at that time.Flight 18 May 1912, p. 448. The monoplane crashed in the summer of 1912, but was rebuilt by Fenwick with the intent of entering it into the Military Trials which were to take place in August that year. The rebuilt aircraft had longer-span wings, larger tail surfaces and shorter tail booms, but retained the Isaacson radial engine. The rebuilt aircraft flew successfully at Larkhill as part of the trials on 9 and 11 August, but when carrying out a third flight on 13 August in gusty weather conditions, dived into the ground from a height of about 200 feet (60 metres), killing Fenwick.Flight 17 August 1912, p. 756. The accident was investigated by the Royal Aero Club, and was blamed on instability of the aircraft causing Fenwick to lose control when it was caught in a powerful gust of wind.Flight 21 September 1912, p. 852.

All training and airborne operations will be conducted in accordance with FM 3-21.220 (Static Line Parachuting Techniques and Training) and FM 3-21.38 (Pathfinder Operations). The U.S. Army Pathfinder School is operated under the auspices of the 1st Battalion (Airborne), 507th Infantry Regiment. The 1-507th IR also oversees the doctrine and operation of the U.S. Army Airborne School and the U.S. Army Jumpmaster School. Development of the modern U.S. Army pathfinder C-47 before boarding the aircraft in order to parachute into France in support of the Normandy landings. The modern U.S. Army Pathfinders are an elite force making up less than .01% of the total Army. Their primary mission is to infiltrate areas and set up parachute drop zones and helicopter landing zones for airborne and air assault missions. The Pathfinders were created in World War II when American paratrooper units needed a way to mark areas and guide aircraft to a specific spot. Early airborne operations resulted in scattered drops up to seven miles from the target. Darkness and inclement weather made it extremely difficult for aircraft to find the drop zone. The 509th Parachute Infantry Battalion and 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 82nd Airborne Division were working on an idea they had learned from the British. An elite force would go in prior to the main assault with visual and electronic signaling devices to guide aircraft to the drop zone and gliders to their landing zones. Their first use in combat was 13 September 1943 during combat jumps into Italy. WWII-era Pathfinders are most remembered for their jump into Normandy during the invasion of 1944 on June 6th, when they led the way for Allied forces into Europe. They were employed throughout Southern France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany in the course of Allied airborne operations until the end of the war in Europe. They were also used in the Pacific theater with the 11th Airborne Division during the liberation of the Philippines. The Korean War saw limited use of the Pathfinders by the 187th Airborne Regimental Combat Team during two combat jumps and operations. The Vietnam War saw the largest use of Pathfinders due to the developments of helicopter insertion and resupply which were pioneered by the 11th Air Assault Division (Test). Nearly every Army aviation battalion had a Pathfinder detachment and deployed them on nearly every mission. After the Vietnam War pathfinders were with the major Airborne units and various combat aviation battalions/groups. They also saw a growth in Army National Guard and Army Reserve Pathfinder platoons during the 1970s and 1980s. Many conducted joint task force missions in Latin America, Europe, and the Middle East. In the late 1980s through 1990 the Army started inactivating its pathfinder units in the belief those skills could be learned by regular troops attending Air Assault School and by individuals within the unit who were pathfinder qualified. Operations during the Panama invasion and the Gulf War showed that Pathfinders were an important factor in successful airborne operations and the Army needed more of them. The 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault), which had retained a pathfinder unit during and after the Vietnam War, expanded its existing company and raised a second in 2005 by converting its long range surveillance detachment (LRSD) into another pathfinder company, giving each of its two aviation brigades a company. The 82nd Airborne Division followed suit by converted its LRSD to a pathfinder company under the 2d Battalion, 82nd Aviation Regiment. Additionally, the 10th Mountain Division (Light Infantry) at Fort Drum, New York, and the 25th Infantry Division in Hawaii have formed provisional pathfinder companies (e.g., they are not reflected in the units' tables of organization and equipment) and conduct combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The pathfinder units today still live by the motto of \\"First In-Last Out\\" and wear the Pathfinder Torch.Fogarty II, Sir Robert J. \\"Army Pathfinders First In...Last Out.\\" Army Pathfinders: First In, Last Out. National Pathfinder Association, 25 May 2010. Web. 25 Oct. 2011. . From a high of five pathfinder companies in the past decade, a reduction began with the 15 May 2015 inactivation of the 159th Combat Aviation Brigade in the 101st Airborne Division, which included the brigade's pathfinder company. Concurrently the 101st CAB was redesignated as the CAB, 101st Airborne Division, bringing it in line with other non-numbered divisional CABs. At this point the division assumed the same organizational structure as the 10th Mountain Division, a light infantry unit. In the summer of 2016 the provisional pathfinder company in the 25th Infantry Division was inactivated, followed by the inactivation on 2 August 2016 of the remaining pathfinder company in the 101st Airborne Division in a ceremony at Fort Campbell, and then the provisional company in the 10th Mountain Division by October 2016. The last pathfinder unit in the Army, a company authorized by MTOE in the 82d Airborne Division, was inactivated in a ceremony on 24 February 2017 at Simmons Army Airfield at Fort Bragg. Training at the Pathfinder School continues, but there are no more pathfinder units.

Splendid Vision, Unswerving Purpose: Developing Air Power for the United States Air Force During the First Century of Powered Flight. Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio: U.S. Air Force Publications, 2002. . It was designed by Dr. W. Frederick Gerhardt, and assembled by the staff of the Flight Test Section at McCook Field in Dayton, Ohio. It was flown in 1923. History The Gerhardt Cycleplane was developed in 1923 by Dr. W. Frederick Gerhardt, head of the Aeronautical Engineering Department at the University of Michigan. While working as an aeronautical engineer at McCook Field, Dr. Gerhardt designed the Cycleplane during his off- duty hours. The Cycleplane was one of many civilian aircraft projects developed at McCook Field by the base's engineers and test staff. The concept was to produce an aircraft capable of maintaining stable, level flight by human-power alone. The Cycleplane was constructed using private funds by members of the McCook Field Flight Test Section. Preliminary construction took place in secrecy in a barn loft. Officials from the base's Engineering Section later allowed Gerhardt and his crew to move into the McCook Field helicopter hangar for the aircraft's final assembly and storage. The Cycleplane had seven narrow vertically mounted wings, two attached to the small wood-and-fabric fuselage, and the other five stacked above it to a height of nearly 15 feet. A single pilot sat in an open cockpit near the wing roots where he pedaled a bicycle gear attached to a large two-bladed propeller. Operation The aircraft made its first flight in July 1923. During initiate flight tests, an automobile towed the Cyleplane into the air and released it. Afterward Gerhardt was able to maintain stable, level flights for short periods of time. The only human-powered takeoff of the Cycleplane was a short hop of with the craft rising . News reel footage The Gerhardt Cycleplane is perhaps best remembered, and to some extent made infamous, by a news reel film made in 1923 that shows the tall aircraft's seven wings collapsing while the aircraft was being pushed on the ground. The fuselage tipped over and the aircraft came to rest on its side. Today, this footage is often shown in compilations along with other ill-fated attempts at human flight from the pioneering days of aviation (most notably the Pitts Sky Car). The scene is also shown in some famous movies, most notably Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines, And Now for Something Completely Different and Airplane!.

The lake is approximately , with a watershed area of . 27% of the watershed area is developed, 51% is forested, 2% is wetlands, and 20% is surface water. The lake has a maximum depth of and an average depth of . It is located in the village of Lake Placid, near the center of the town of North Elba in Essex County.  Recreational Use  Situated in the center of the Village of Lake Placid, Mirror Lake experiences a lot of recreational use. Motor boats and snowmobiles are not allowed on the lake. During the summer it is popular for canoeing, kayaking, and stand-up paddle boarding. In the winter, you can take a dogsled ride on the lake or ice skate on a maintained track around the perimeter of the lake. The swim portion of the Lake Placid IRONMAN competition takes place in the lake and swim lanes are set up through the summer for swimmers to practice.  Lake Monitoring  In 2016, the Ausable River Association and Adirondack Watershed Institute launched a comprehensive monitoring program on Mirror Lake. The lake is monitored bi-weekly during the open water season and monthly while the lake is frozen. During each sampling visit surface and bottom water samples are collected for chemical analysis of chlorophyll-a, nutrients, and metals. In addition, vertical profiles of temperature, dissolved oxygen, specific conductance, and pH are recorded at intervals through the entire water column.  Threats  = Road Salt = Mirror Lake has elevated sodium and chloride concentrations as a result of winter de-icing practices on the roads and sidewalks surrounding the lake. The salt levels are higher than 97% of other lakes surveyed as part of the Adirondack Lake Assessment Program. The surface water chloride concentration (47.8 mg/L) is 239-time higher than the average for Adirondack lakes not impacted by road salt. In addition, Mirror Lake experiences a buildup of salt laden water at the bottom of the lake as a result of direct stormwater inputs. At the bottom of the lake chloride concentrations have been recorded as high as 125 mg/L, or 520-times higher than lakes not impacted by road salt. = Low Dissolved Oxygen = Deep water dissolved oxygen is important to maintaining a health cold-water fishery, especially for native lake trout.

Life He was the only son of John Dunkin by his wife Anne, daughter of William Chapman, civil engineer, was born at Islington, London, on 9 August 1812. He received his education at the Military College, Vend√¥me. In 1831, he entered his father's printing and stationery business at Bromley, Kent, removed with him in 1837 to a new establishment at Dartford, and a little later took charge of a branch business at Gravesend. Some years after his father's death, in December 1846, he opened a London branch at 140 Queen Victoria Street. Dunkin belonged to numerous arch√¶ological societies, English and foreign. As an original member of the British Arch√¶ological Association, he edited and printed the report of the first general meeting, held at Canterbury in September 1844 (one hundred and fifty copies, octavo, London, Gravesend, printed in 1845), and that of the special general meeting of 5 March 1845 (one hundred and fifty copies, octavo, London, Gravesend, printed in 1845). Again, in 1851 he saw through the press the report of the fifth general meeting, held at Worcester in August 1848. He also edited The Arch√¶ological Mine, a collection of Antiquarian Nuggets relating to the County of Kent ‚Ä¶ including the Laws of Kent during the Saxon epoch, vols. 1‚Äì3, octavo, London, 1855 [53‚Äì63]. In the belief that he was the original editor, he printed (octavo, Noviomago, 1856) twenty-five copies of the works of Radulphus, abbot of Coggeshall, to which he appended an English translation. An imperfect copy of this unlucky undertaking, with some severe remarks by Sir Frederic Madden, is in the British Museum. While travelling in the severe winter of 1878‚Äì9, he was seized with bronchitis at Newbury, Berkshire, but managed to get up to London to the house of an old nurse at 110 Stamford Street, Blackfriars Road. There he died after a few days' illness, 30 January 1879. He was buried in Dartford cemetery, 4 February. He was never married. Legacy By his will he directed that after the death of his sister and residuary legatee, Miss Ellen Elizabeth Dunkin, his library and collections are to go, under certain conditions, to the Guildhall Library. On failure of such conditions the collections are to be presented to the trustees of the British Museum; and that the family monuments at Dartford and Bromley may be maintained and renewed when necessary, he left to the lord mayor, the vicars of Dartford and Bromley, and the principal librarian of the British Museum freehold estates at Stone, Erith, and Bromley; ten guineas annually to be spent in a visitation dinner to examine the tombs and memorials ('Printing Times and Lithographer, 15 April 1879, page 89). Works Dunkin had an honest love for antiquities, but his writings contain little that is valuable. The lighter essays which he contributed to periodicals, and of which he afterwards reprinted a few copies, are simply inane. The following is probably an incomplete list: # Nundin√¶ Cantian√¶.

Life He was the son of John Dunkin of Bicester, Oxfordshire, by his wife, Elizabeth, widow of John Telford, and daughter of Thomas and Johanna Timms, was born at Bicester on 16 May 1782. While attending the free school of that town, he met with a severe accident, and for many years it was feared that he would remain a cripple for life. He employed the leisure thus imposed upon him chiefly by scribbling verses, but contrived at the same time to pick up some knowledge of history and arch√¶ology. After serving an apprenticeship to a printer, and living for a while in London, he established himself before 1815 as a bookseller, stationer, and printer at Bromley, Kent. Here he published his first topographical work, a compilation in part from Philipott, Hasted, and Lysons, entitled Outlines of the History and Antiquities of Bromley in Kent. ‚Ä¶ To which is added an investigation of the Antiquities of Holwood Hill ... by ... A. J. Kempe, octavo, Bromley, 1815. It was followed the next year by The History and Antiquities of Bicester. .. To which is added an Inquiry into the History of Alchester, a city of the Dobuni. ‚Ä¶ With an Appendix and ‚Ä¶ Kennetts Glossary, 2 parts, octavo, London, 1816. In 1819, he commenced arranging for the press his account of the hundreds of Bullington and Ploughley, Oxfordshire, for which he had previously collected large materials. His son writes: the particulars of which will be found detailed in the Appendix. In 1823, the work appeared under the title of Oxfordshire: the History and Antiquities of the Hundreds of Bullington and Ploughley, &c.;, 2 vols. quarto, London. The impression was limited to a hundred copies, of which seventy only were for sale. In 1837, Dunkin moved to Dartford, where three years previously he had commenced to build himself a large printing establishment. Shortly afterwards he opened a branch business at Gravesend. In 1844, he published his History and Antiquities of Dartford with Topographical Notices of the Neighbourhood, octavo, London, Dartford [printed]. Thenceforward, he occupied himself in arranging the materials he had accumulated for the histories of Oxfordshire and Kent. He was an original member of the British Arch√¶ological Association. He died on 22 December 1846, and by his desire was buried on the eastern side of the lichgate of St. Edmund's cemetery, Dartford, as near as possible to the burying-ground of Noviomagus, which he had described in his last work. A brass was erected to his memory in that part of Dartford parish church which by the 1870s was occupied by the organ ( cites the Dartford Chronicle, 8 February 1879). Dunkin's collections were given to the Guildhall Library by his daughter Ellen in 1886 and since 1954 those relating to Oxfordshire have been housed in the Bodleian Library. Family In 1807, he married Anne, the daughter of William Chapman of Lincolnshire, a well-known civil engineer, by whom he left a son, Alfred John Dunkin, and a daughter, Ellen Elizabeth Dunkin.

El Azteca Historic District Boundaries Location Neighborhood east of Downtown Laredo, Roughly bounded by Interstate 35, Matamoros Street (U.S. Highway 83), Zacate Creek, and the Rio Grande. History El Azteca Neighborhood developed east of today's San Agustin de Laredo Historic District.El Azteca's earliest inhabitants were descendants of Spanish colonists who began settlement efforts along the lower Rio Grande in the mid-18th century. Later, immigrants from the Mexico contributed to the growth of the community and provided much of the labor for the newly arrived international railroad in 1881. By the turn of the 20th century, El Azteca was a thriving community of homes and small businesses populated almost exclusively by Mexican and Mexican-American residents. El Azteca is significant as a diverse, multi-layered cultural landscape. The neighborhood took its name from El Azteca Theatre which opened in 1922 as the Teatro Nacional, a venue for theatrical and vaudeville performances. In the 1930s, when moving pictures supplanted live theater in popularity, it became known as El Azteca movie house and showed Spanish language films. A second theater, the Iturbide Theater, operated nearby and it was known as the ‚ÄúHome of Spanish Vaudeville.‚Äù The neighborhood was also the home of noted residents of Mexican origin who migrated escaping the Mexican Revolution. Recognition Designated as a National Register Historic District in 2003, El Azteca is distinctive for its setting, layout and landscape features. The neighborhood is situated on a high bluff overlooking the Rio Grande which not only forms its southern boundary, but designates the international boundary between the United States and Mexico. Zacate Creek, a steep-walled creek that, in earlier times, provided fresh water to its inhabitants and livestock, defines its eastern boundary. Zacate Creek was the site for one of the last battles of the Civil War, the Battle of Laredo, in 1865. The first electric streetcar line built west of the Mississippi River passed through the neighborhood and crossed Zacate Creek via the Iturbide Street Bridge. The bridge and streetcar connected both the neighborhood and city of Laredo to the newly developing commercial and residential sections of the city that began growing to the east of the creek. Cut off from the historic center of Laredo by Interstate 35 in the late 1970s, Barrio Azteca has retained much of its historic fabric. The neighborhood maintains a sufficient concentration of historic properties, some of which are rare, even extraordinary, examples of domestic and commercial vernacular architecture found only in the borderlands region of South Texas.

Su Hui (, Fourth Century CE) was a Chinese poet of the Middle Sixteen Kingdoms period (304 to 439) during the Six Dynasties period. Her courtesy name is Ruolan (). Su is famous for her extremely complex \\"palindrome\\" (huiwen ÂõûÊñá) poem, apparently having innovated this genre, as well as producing the most complex example to date.Hinton, 105 Biography Su Hui with her great palindrome, the Xuanji Tu. The Jin Dynasty (265‚Äì420) had briefly unified the Chinese empire, in 280, but from 291 to 306 a multi-sided civil war known as the War of the Eight Princes raged through northern China, devastating that part of the country. For the first thirteen years this was an all-out struggle for power among princes and dukes. Then in 304 CE the leader of the formerly independent ethnic nation of the Northern Xiongnu declared independence, under its newly declared Grand Chanyu, Liu Yuan (later Prince Han Zhao). Various other non-Han Chinese groups became involved, in what is known as the Wu Hu uprising. By 317 the last Jin prince left standing, now as emperor, ruled an empire reduced to its former southern area, and the former northern part of the Jin empire had been subdivided into a number of independent states. In 351, the state of Former Qin was founded, and by 376 it had succeeded in unifying northern China. Su Hui was a poet of the kingdom of Former Qin (351-394). She was from a literate family, in what is now Fufeng County, in Shaanxi Province. She was the third daughter of Su Daozhi. Su Hui married at sixteen (fifteen, by Western reckoning), and went to live with her husband, Dou Tao, to what is now Qinzhou District, Tianshui, Prefecture, in Gansu Province, where he was the governor. Palindrome Poem: Xuanji Tu Su Hui embroidering in circle from a Qing dynasty illustration Su Hui was known for an important and unusual poem. This was described in contemporary sources as shuttle-woven on brocade, meant to be read in a circle, and consisting of 112 or else 840 characters. By the Tang period, the following story about the poem was current:Wang, 51 :Dou Tao of Qinzhou was exiled to the desert, away from his wife Lady Su. Upon departure from Su, Dou swore that he would not marry another person. However, as soon as he arrived in the desert region, he married someone. Lady Su composed a circular poem, wove it into a piece of brocade, and sent it to him.Wang, 51 Another source, naming the poem as Xuanji Tu (Picture of the Turning Sphere), claims that it was a palindromic poem comprehensible only to Dou (which would explain why none of the Tang sources reprinted it), and that when he read it, he left his desert wife and returned to Su Hui.Wang, 52 The text of the poem was circulated continuously in medieval China and was never lost, but during the Song Dynasty it became scarce. The 112 character version was included in early sources. The earliest excerpts of the 840 character version date from a 10th-century text by Li Fang. Several 13th century copies were attributed to famous women of the Song Dynasty, but falsely so.Wang, 80-81 In the Ming Dynasty the poem became quite popular and scholars discovered 7,940 ways to read it. It was also mentioned in the story Flowers in the Mirror. The poem is in the form of a twenty-nine by twenty-nine character grid, and can be read forward or backwards, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, as well as within its color-coded grids.Hinton, 108 A Simplified Chinese reduction, and the original, of Su Hui's Xuanji Tu palindrome poem. During the Qing Dynasty the character ÂøÉ (heart) was added to the center of the poem, so that it now has 841 characters.

He was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Greenock from 1852 to 1868.  Life  Disruption brooch showing the graves of Andrew Melville, John Knox, David Welsh, James Renwick, and Alexander Henderson. The names of Chalmers, Dunlop and Candlish are also engraved. He was born 27 December 1798, the fifth son of Alexander Dunlop of Keppoch, Dumbartonshire, by Margaret Colquhoun of Kenmure, Lanarkshire. His family had in former times taken much interest in the Scottish church. Dunlop was called to the bar in 1820, and in his earliest years was an ardent student of his profession. In 1822 he became one of the editors of 'Shaw and Dunlop's Reports', and gave no little evidence of his legal attainments. At an early period his attention was specially directed to parochial law; in 1825 he published a treatise on the law of Scotland relating to the poor, in 1833 a treatise on the law of patronage, and afterwards his fuller treatise on parochial law. The sympathies of Dunlop were very warmly enlisted in the operations of the church, and he took an active part in all the ecclesiastical reforms and benevolent undertakings of the period. But in a pre-eminent degree his interest was excited by the questions relating to the law of patronage, and the collision which arose out of them between the church and the civil courts. Relying on history and statute, Dunlop very earnestly supported what was called the \\"non-intrusion\\" party, led by Chalmers and others, believing it to be constitutionally in the right, and when the church became involved in litigation he devoted himself with rare disinterestedness to her defence. He not only defended the church at the bar of the court of session, but in private councils, in committees, deputations, and publications he was unwearied on her behalf. The public documents in which his position was stated and defended, especially the Claim of Right in 1842, the Protest and Deed of Demission in 1843, were mainly his work. In 1844, he married Eliza Esther, only child of John Murray of Ainslie Place, Edinburgh, and on the death of his father-in-law in 1849, he assumed the name of Murray-Dunlop. Subsequently, in 1866, on succeeding to the estate of his cousin, William Colquhoun-Stirling of Law and Edinbarnet, he took the name of Colquhoun- Stirling-Murray-Dunlop. In 1845 and 1847, he contested the representation of his native town of Greenock, but without success; in 1852, he was returned by the electors, and for fifteen years represented them in a way that met with their most cordial appreciation. In early life he had been a tory, but he was now thoroughly liberal. In parliament, however, while generally supporting the liberals he retained an independent position, declining offices both in connection with the government and with his own profession in Scotland, to which his services and abilities well entitled him. His services in parliament were fruitful of much useful legislation. In a sketch of his life by his friend, David Maclagan, mention is made of eight various acts which he got passed. Those on legal points introduced important practical amendments of the laws, the most interesting, perhaps, being that which put a stop to Gretna Green marriages. Some of his measures bore on social improvement, one of them being an act to facilitate the erection of dwelling-houses for the working classes, and another an act to render reformatories and industrial schools more available for vagrant and destitute children, well known as Dunlop's Act. The most chivalrous of his parliamentary services was an attack (19 March 1861) on the government of Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston, which he had usually supported, in connection with the Afghan war. Many years after the event, it was ascertained that certain despatches written in 1839 by Sir Alexander Burnes, our envoy at the Afghan court, had been tampered with in publication, and made to express opinions opposite to those which Sir Alexander held. Dunlop, at a great sacrifice of feeling, moved on 19 March 1861 for a committee of inquiry, and was very ably supported by Mr. Bright and others. Lord Palmerston was put to great straits in his defence, as it could not be denied that Burnes's despatches had been changed; but Benjamin Disraeli came to his rescue, and on the ground that the matter was now twenty years old advised the house not to reopen it. On a division, the motion of Dunlop was negatived by a vote of 159 to 49. In 1868, he resigned his seat in parliament, the rest of his days being spent chiefly on his property of Corsock in Dumfriesshire. Lord Cockburn in his \\"Journal\\" ranks Dunlop in everything, except impressive public exhibition, superior to Thomas Chalmers and Robert Smith Candlish:  Family  In 1844, Dunlop married Eliza Esther Murray, only child of John Murray of Edinburgh. She died at Corsock on 14 July 1902, 84 years old. They had four sons and four daughters. Their eldest daughter was Anna Lindsay whose name was said to be synonymous with women's rights in Scotland.K. D.

Life  Frances was born on 16 April 1730. She descended from a brother of William Wallace, the Scottish patriot, and was the last surviving daughter of Sir Thomas Wallace of Craigie, by his wife Eleonora, daughter of Colonel Agnew of Lochryan. Her only brother died before her father, and on her father's death in 1760 she inherited the property. Previous to this, in 1747 at the age of seventeen, she had become the wife of Mr John Dunlop of Dunlop. = Relationship with Burns = She made the acquaintance of Burns in the winter of 1786, shortly after the publication of his first Kilmarnock volume. Having read the Cottar's Saturday Night in a friend's copy while recovering from a severe illness, she was so delighted with it that she immediately sent off a messenger to Mossgiel Farm (Burns's home), fifteen or sixteen miles distant, for half a dozen copies, and with a friendly invitation for Burns to call at Dunlop House. Frances's relationship to William Wallace was also mentioned, and Burns in his reply warmly expressed his gratification at her noticing his attempts to celebrate her illustrious ancestor. From this time they became fast friends and frequent correspondents, Burns's letters to her being often on the more serious themes. He was also in the habit of enclosing poems to her, among the more remarkable sent her being Auld Lang Syne, Gae fetch to me a pint of wine, and Farewell, thou fair day. In his last years she deserted him, and he sent her several letters without ever receiving any explanation. In his last written to her, 12 July 1796, he says that having written so often without obtaining an answer, he would not have written her again but for the fact that he would soon be \\"beyond that bourne whence no traveller returns\\". When Currie proposed to write the Life of Burns, Mrs. Dunlop refused to permit her letters to Burns to see the light, but agreed to give a letter of Burns for every one of hers returned. As Burns wrote several to her without obtaining an answer, these were not recovered. She died on 24 May 1815.  Family  In 1747 Frances married John Dunlop of Dunlop, Ayrshire. They had seven sons (including Lieut. Gen. James Dunlop of Dunlop) and six daughters. Burns, in her honour, named his second son Francis Wallace Burns.

Life The Carstares grave, Greyfriars Kirkyard He was born at Glasgow in 1692, the youngest son of William Dunlop, the elder, and Sarah Carstares. His brother, Alexander Dunlop, was also a scholar. The early death of his father threw on his mother the chief charge of his education. After his philosophical course at Edinburgh he studied both law and divinity under the superintendence of Principal Carstares, who was married to his mother's sister. He was licensed in 1714 by the presbytery of Edinburgh, and soon after he was appointed by George I professor of divinity and church history in the university there. For the few years of his life thereafter, he continued to discharge the duties of his chair, and likewise to preach as occasion presented itself in the Edinburgh churches. In the latter capacity he was singularly successful. He had great pulpit gifts, much fluency, and a lively fancy; his emotions penetrated his discourses, and brought out his appeals with a rare power of conviction and persuasion. Quick in perception, of very laborious habits, and a tenacious memory, his attainments and learning were regarded as extraordinary, and had his life been prolonged he would doubtless have risen to the highest distinction in the church. He died in 1720, at the early age of twenty-eight. He is buried in the grave of his uncle, William Carstares in Greyfriars Kirkyard.Carstares grave inscription, Greyfriars Kirkyard The grave lies on an outer boundary wall, south-west of the church, backing onto the grounds of George Heriot's School.

The shell has about 20 whorls. The apical whorls may be eroded in older snails. The aperture is ovate and white. The shell is unique among Cerithioidea, because it has two deep sinuses: an anal sinus which is close to the suture and an anterior sinus more forward in the aperture. The height of the aperture is about one-fifth of the height of the shell. The height of the shell is usually 50‚Äì60 mm, but can be up to 90 mm. The operculum is oval, corneous and dark brown in color. The snail has a broad snout. The radula is large and is located in a correspondingly large buccal mass.  Ecology  This snail lives in slightly brackish water. It has also been reported from freshwater. It is the only pachychilid species that lives in brackish water; the other species in the family are freshwater snails. The population density can reach up to 6700 snails per m2. This snail probably feeds by grazing. It is oviparous. It probably has free-swimming larvae.  Human use  This snail is used as a food source for humans in the Philippines and in Thailand.

Life He studied at Guy's and St. Thomas's Hospitals, and became licentiate of the Society of Apothecaries in 1825, member of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1828, and fellow in 1852. Dunn was a phrenologist and associated at the Westminster Medical Society with others (John S. Streeter, Forbes Winslow and Edward Wright). He was Fellow of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society, along with the phrenologists Thomas Ignatius Maria Forster and Joseph Moore.Roger Cooter, The Cultural Meaning of Popular Science: phrenology and the organization of consent in nineteenth-century Britain (1984), p. 31; Google Books. He was also Fellow of the Obstetrical Society, the Ethnological Society of London, and of the Medical Society of London; and was for many years treasurer to the metropolitan counties branch of the British Medical Association.

They were built in order to revive TCDD's failing image in the early 1990s, for use on the Capital Express. Today they are the most common railcars in Turkey. History TCDD's image was failing greatly in the early 1990s and its Ankara‚àíIstanbul mainline was losing market-share to roads. People mostly chose buses over rail for travel, because TCDD's fleet of railcars were aging quickly. The railways' premier train at the time, the Fatih Express was using Black-Red Intercity cars, which were noisy, uncomfortable and without air conditioning which made the interior very hot during the summer times. During winter times, the steam heater on board the cars always broke down or malfunctioned causing problems. To make things even worse, a highway was opened between ƒ∞stanbul and Ankara decreasing travel by rail considerably. The railways needed to improve travel or they would lose a lot more customers to roads. The solution was the operation of a brand new train between the two cities: The Capital Express. For this train brand new, luxurious railcars would be needed so, TCDD ordered a batch of new TVS2000 railcars from T√úVASA≈û in 1991. The TVS2000s proved to be successful very quickly. TCDD's bad image started to improve almost instantly and the ƒ∞stanbul-Ankara main line was getting increased travel. Because of the success of the railcars, TCDD ordered even more of them and soon started to replace their entire fleet with them. T√úVASA≈û has modernized intercity and regional cars to meet TVS2000 standards between 2002 and 2006.TUVASAS History - www.tuvasas.com.trTVS2000 - www.trainsofturkey.com Types The TVS2000 series has Coach cars, Couchette cars, Sleeping cars and Dining cars. =Coach (Pullman) car= The Coach car, known as \\"Pullman cars\\" in Turkey, () were the first batch of railcars to be built and put into service. A total of 176 were built with the first batch entering revenue service in 1993. Coaches have 2+1 seating arrangements with restrooms at either end. Sliding elector-pnuematic doors separate the main compartment from the vestibules. A standard coach car has a capacity of 60 seated passengers. Pullman (Coach) car. =Dining car= The Dining car () was the second type of TVS2000 railcar to be built. A total of 28 were built with the first batch entering service in 1994. Dining cars have 12 tables (6 on either side) seating 4 passengers. Prior to the 2008 smoking ban, dining cars had a smoking and non-smoking area, with a glass partition between the two. The smoking area was towards the middle of the car, consisting of 8 tables, while the smaller non-smoking area was towards the rear of the car with 4 tables. Dining car. =Couchette Car= The Couchette car () was introduced in 1996 with a total of 20 cars built. These cars featured 10 compartments, each having 4 seats. Baggage racks were included above both pairs of seats. In 2002, 30 new couchette cars were built that featured sleeping accommodations for overnight trains. The same 4-seat compartments were included on this newer set, with 4 folding beds. 2 beds would fold out from the seats, while the other two beds would fold down from above. The baggage rack was removed on this model. To distinguish the two cars, the non-sleeping couchette cars became known as Compartment cars (), while the sleeping couchette cars kept the name of Couchette cars. Couchette car. =Sleeping Car= The Sleeping car () was introduced in 1998 with a total of 67 cars built. Each car has 10 compartments, each with a bunk bed housing 2 passengers. These compartments can not be shared with passengers that book separately. Inside each compartment is a small sink with a mirror, a counter with a minifridge and cabinet as well as an overhead baggage rack. Toilets are located at both ends of the car. Sleeping car. =Generator car= Generator cars () were introduced in 2005 to provide Head-end power to the rest of the train, since most Turkish locomotives do not supply HEP. These cars also provide a small quarters for the crew. A total of 88 were built. Generator (HEP) car.

His will, dated 5 January 1794, was proved at London, on the 20 January by his kinsman, William Dunn, officer of excise of London (registered in P.C.C., 16, Holman). Therein he describes himself as \\"teacher of the mathematics and master for the longitude at sea\\", and desires to be buried \\"in the parish church belonging to the place where I shall happen to inhabit a little time before my decease\\". He names seven relations to whom he left ¬£20 each; but to his wife, Elizabeth Dunn, \\"who hath withdrawn herself from me near thirty years, the sum only of ten pounds\\". No children are mentioned.

It was similar to the other nine engines, but used saturated instead of superheated steam, had a mechanical stoker and the coupled wheels on the leading engine unit were of a larger diameter than those of the trailing engine unit. It had Walschaerts valve gear and was numbered 1024.Soul of A Railway, System 7, Western Transvaal, based in Johannesburg, Part 21: Witbank Line by Les Pivnic, Eugene Armer, Peter Stow and Peter Micenko. Captions 1, 2. (Accessed on 4 May 2017) Compound expansion In a compound locomotive, steam is expanded in phases. After being expanded in a high- pressure cylinder and having then lost pressure and given up part of its heat, it is exhausted into a larger-volume low-pressure cylinder for secondary expansion, after which it is exhausted through the smokebox. By comparison, in the more usual arrangement of simple expansion (simplex), steam is expanded just once in any one cylinder before being exhausted through the smokebox. In the compound Mallet locomotive, the rear set of coupled wheels are driven by the smaller high-pressure cylinders, which are fed steam from the steam dome. Their spent steam is then fed to the larger low-pressure cylinders, which drive the front set of coupled wheels. Characteristics Apart from having a different boiler, there were three major differences between this locomotive and the nine Class MF engines which were built and delivered at the same time. =Saturated steam= It was not equipped with a superheater, although superheated locomotives had already been proven to be more economic and superior in performance. Since steam did not have to be routed via a superheater, it was led vertically down from the dome directly to the high- pressure cylinders. =Coupled wheels= The front set of coupled wheels was of a larger diameter than the rear set. In theory, this configuration was to result in improved acceleration with the rear engine unit providing the traction. It was also believed that the difference in frequency between the front and rear cylinder exhaust beats would result in a more even pressure in the receiver pipe and therefore improved steam flow, although exactly how this was to come about was not clear. It was the only South African articulated locomotive to have coupled wheels of different diameters. Owing to the larger diameter wheels of the front engine unit, the boiler pitch had to be raised to , the highest pitched boiler in South Africa at the time. The unorthodox driving wheel configuration did not have the expected results and in comparison with the other nine superheated engines, the locomotive proved to be inferior in performance. =Mechanical stoker= This was the first South African locomotive to be equipped with a mechanical stoker. This device was of the Street type and consisted of a coal crusher, hand-fed by the fireman, which was fitted to the front left hand side of the tender footplate. The crusher was driven by a small steam engine which was mounted behind the hand brake column. The crusher reduced the coal to a suitable size for the stoker. The crushed coal then fell by gravity into a chute which led to a receiving bin, fitted below the back buffer beam of the locomotive. From here it was picked up by a bucket elevator which worked in a large pipe. The full buckets were carried up in the left-hand-side tube mounted on the back of the firebox, discharged into a central receiver and then travelled empty down the right hand side tube. The bucket belt was driven by another small steam engine mounted on the left side of the firebox, near the top. The main shaft of this engine had adjustable cams which operated three steam cocks that supplied steam jets to the coal delivery orifices. From the central receiver, a cone- shaped tray directed the coal to the right, centre or left sides as required, while the cam-operated steam jets blew the coal into the firebox. When coal was only required at the back end of the firebox, the cams could be projected a short distance, thereby allowing steam jets of just sufficient power to project the coal to the required parts of the firebox. It was a very complicated, cumbersome and extremely noisy arrangement which required the fireman to attend to two auxiliary engines and feed the crusher in addition to his normal duties. The noise created by this mechanism was stated to be deafening to the crew and was threefold, first the noise of the crusher, then the noisy circulation of the conveyor buckets, and finally the sharp reports of the steam jets which controlled the feeding. The mechanical stoker was removed and the locomotive was converted to hand firing soon after being placed in service. Service When the Union of South Africa was established on 31 May 1910, the three Colonial government railways (Cape Government Railways, Natal Government Railways and CSAR) were united under a single administration to control and administer the railways, ports and harbours of the Union. Although the South African Railways and Harbours came into existence in 1910, with Sir William Hoy appointed as its first General Manager, the actual classification and renumbering of all the rolling stock of the three constituent railways were only implemented with effect from 1 January 1912.The South African Railways - Historical Survey. Editor George Hart, Publisher Bill Hart, Sponsored by Dorbyl Ltd., Published c. 1978, p. 25. In 1912, this locomotive was renumbered 1628 and designated on the South African Railways (SAR).

Life The grave of William Dunn, Glasgow Necropolis He was born at Gartclash, in the parish of Kirkintilloch, Dumbartonshire, on 5 October 1770, and was educated at the parish school and partly at the neighbouring village of Campsie. Before he was eighteen he was left an orphan, with four brothers and a sister dependent on him for support. He had already given evidence of possessing an aptitude for mechanical contrivances. His first situation was in the establishment of a cotton-spinner named Waddington, at Stockingfield, near Glasgow. Here he learned iron-turning and machine-making. Three or four years later he was in Messrs. Black & Hastie's works at Bridge of Weir, from which he went to Pollokshaws, to the factories of John Monteith. About 1800, having acquired a few hundred pounds by the sale of his patrimony of Gartclash, he resolved to start in business for himself, and accordingly opened a manufactory of machines in High John Street, Glasgow. In or about 1802, he bought a small spinning-mill in Tobago Street, Calton of Glasgow, and in 1808 he purchased the Duntocher mill, some seven miles distant from that city. A few years later he purchased from the Faifley Spinning Company the Faifley mill, which stood about a mile distant from the other. In 1813, he became the proprietor of the Dalnotter Ironworks, which had been used for slitting and rolling iron, and for making implements of husbandry; and after having greatly enlarged the two mills he already owned, he was encouraged by the rapid increase of his business to build upon the site of these ironworks the Milton mill, the foundation of which was laid in 1821, and which was destroyed by fire twenty-five years later. Finally, in 1831 the Hardgate mill was built in the same neighbourhood. All these works, lying near to each other, were exclusively applied to the spinning and weaving of cotton. Under Dunn's auspices Duntocher, which had before hardly deserved the name of a village, became a thriving and populous place. Previously to his first purchase in 1808, the hands employed at the works did not exceed a hundred and fifty; at his death their number was about two thousand. Dunn became a large purchaser of land in the neighbourhood of his works, and ultimately his estates extended upwards of two miles along the banks of the Clyde, and about three miles along the banks of the canal. Upon this property, twelve hundred acres of which were farmed by himself, he employed more than two hundred and fifty men. The wages which he annually paid in this parish alone totalled ¬£35,000. Dunn died at Mountblow, 13 March 1849, leaving property worth ¬£500,000. He is buried in Glasgow Necropolis with a monument designed by John Thomas Rochead.Dictionary of SCottish Architects:Rochead The substantial monument faces north from the upper section facing the main path.

A live sharksucker is known to attach itself temporarily by its modified dorsal fin used as a sucking disc to various hosts, such as sharks, rays, large bony fishes, sea turtles, whales, dolphins, ships, and even sometimes scubadivers. Description Echeneis naucrates E. naucrates is a medium-sized fish which can grow up to length.Lieske, E. and R. Myers (1994). Collins Pocket Guide. Coral reef fishes. Indo-Pacific & Caribbean including the Red Sea. Harper Collins Publishers. Its body is elongated and streamlined, and its lower jaw is clearly prognathic (it projects forward well beyond the upper jaw). The jaws, vomer and tongue have villiform teeth. The main distinctive feature to distinguish from other fishes is the oval-shaped sucking disc, which is a highly modified dorsal fin positioned from the top of the head to the anterior part of the body. The body background colouration is dark grey to dark brown, with a dark belly. A longitudinal stripe runs along the axis side of the body, it is always darker than its background colour with a whitish margin. The caudal fin is black with white corners. Diet According to its maturity or situation (with host or not) the remora's diet varies. As a juvenile, it sometimes acts as a cleaner fish on reef station and its diet consists of small parasitic crustaceans living on the fishes' bodies, like copepods, isopods, and ostracods. With a host, the live sharksucker eats parasitic crustaceans from the latter, food scraps from the feeding activity of its host, or some small food caught by filtering the water through its villiform teeth while the navigating on its host. Without a host, the fish stays close to the shore and can aggregate with other individuals; its diet is then composed of free-living crustaceans, squid, and small fishes.

The effectiveness of pregabalin and its older relative gabapentin against pain syndromes of this kind (which tend to respond poorly to other analgesic drugs) has led to their widespread use, and these drugs have subsequently been found to be useful for many other medical applications, including as anticonvulsants, muscle relaxants, anxiolytics and mood stabilisers. However these drugs are still of relatively low potency, and scientists have struggled for years to come up with an improvement on pregabalin, with increasing pressure to find a suitably improved replacement before the patent on pregabalin expires in 2018. While it was determined that the mechanism of action involves modulation of the Œ±2Œ¥ calcium channel subunits (1 and 2), derivatives that appeared to be more potent and effective than pregabalin at this target when tested in vitro, repeatedly turned out to be weak or inactive when tested in animals. Eventually it was discovered that pregabalin is actively transported across the blood‚Äìbrain barrier by the system L neutral amino acid transporter protein, which usually functions to transport certain amino acids, including leucine, valine and isoleucine, into the brain. This explained the previous failures, as most alterations to the pregabalin molecule which increase affinity for the Œ±2Œ¥ channels and therefore increase apparent potency in the test tube, were found to also dramatically reduce binding to the system L transporter, and with no assisted transport into the brain, blood‚Äìbrain barrier penetration was minimal and the drugs were inactive in animals. However, after extensive searching it was discovered that one enantiomer of the relatively simple derivative 4-methylpregabalin, was both 4x higher in binding affinity to Œ±2Œ¥ channels than pregabalin, and also retained similar affinity for the system L transporter. This was tested in animals and as hoped, was found to have similar effectiveness to pregabalin as an analgesic and with around 2-3x the potency. It remains unclear at this stage whether (3R,4R)-4-methylpregabalin will now be further developed for medical use in humans however, given the recent development of several competing drugs from the same family which are much further advanced in clinical trials.

With this definition of a derivative, one can generalize Rademacher's theorem to metric space-valued Lipschitz functions. Discussion Rademacher's theorem states that a Lipschitz map f : Rn ‚Üí Rm is differentiable almost everywhere in Rn; in other words, for almost every x, f is approximately linear in any sufficiently small range of x. If f is a function from a Euclidean space Rn that takes values instead in a metric space X, it doesn't immediately make sense to talk about differentiability since X has no linear structure a priori. Even if you assume that X is a Banach space and ask whether a Fr√©chet derivative exists almost everywhere, this does not hold. For example, consider the function f : [0,1] ‚Üí L1([0,1]), mapping the unit interval into the space of integrable functions, defined by f(x) = œá[0,x], this function is Lipschitz (and in fact, an isometry) since, if 0 ‚â§ x ‚â§ y‚â§ 1, then :f(x)-f(y)=\\\\int_0^1 \\\\chi_{[0,x]}(t)-\\\\chi_{[0,y]}(t)\\\\,dt = \\\\int_x^y \\\\, dt = x-y, but one can verify that limh‚Üí0(f(x + h) ‚àí f(x))/h does not converge to an L1 function for any x in [0,1], so it is not differentiable anywhere. However, if you look at Rademacher's theorem as a statement about how a Lipschitz function stabilizes as you zoom in on almost every point, then such a theorem exists but is stated in terms of the metric properties of f instead of its linear properties. Definition and existence of the metric differential A substitute for a derivative of f:Rn ‚Üí X is the metric differential of f at a point z in Rn which is a function on Rn defined by the limit : MD(f,z)(x)=\\\\lim_{r\\\\rightarrow 0} \\\\frac{d_{X}(f(z+rx),f(z))}{r} whenever the limit exists (here d X denotes the metric on X). A theorem due to Bernd Kirchheim states that a Rademacher theorem in terms of metric differentials holds: for almost every z in Rn, MD(f, z) is a seminorm and : d_X(f(x),f(y)) - MD(f,z)(x-y) = o(x-z+y-z). The little-o notation employed here means that, at values very close to z, the function f is approximately an isometry from Rn with respect to the seminorm MD(f, z) into the metric space X.

Early life Williams was born on October 2, 1882 in Foxboro, Massachusetts to Fred H. Williams, a lawyer and member of the Massachusetts General Court, and Julia Annette (Blake) Williams. Williams grew up in Foxboro and Brookline, Massachusetts. He graduated from Brookline High School in 1899, Harvard College in 1903, and Harvard Law School in 1906. Attorney Williams began his legal career as a lawyer with Walter I. Badger in Boston. He then went to work with his father. In 1918, Williams was appointed Assistant District Attorney for the Southeastern District (consisting of Norfolk and Plymouth Counties). In this role he assisted District Attorney Frederick G. Katzmann in the prosecution of Ferdinando Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti. In 1922 he was elected District Attorney. In December 1924 Williams was appointed United States Attorney for the District of Massachusetts by President Calvin Coolidge. Williams' appointment satisfied both Wets and dries as the drys felt that he would enforce the prohibition laws and the wets supported his confirmation because he was not endorsed by the Anti-Saloon League. Judge Williams resigned as U.S. Attorney in 1926 after he was appointed Associate Justice of the Massachusetts Superior Court. He remained on the Superior Court until August 13, 1947 when he was appointed by Governor Robert F. Bradford to serve on the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court.

He served as host and announcer for the children's program \\"Discovery\\" in the 1960s. Family Bill Owen was born in Grand Forks, North Dakota on February 1, 1931. His father Owen T. Owen (born in Milbank, South Dakota on September 15, 1890) was an outstanding track star at the University of North Dakota where he graduated from law school. He held many public offices including state tax commissioner and chairman of the state's Workman's Compensation bureau. Bill's mother Else Rohde Owen (born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin on September 12, 1893) was the daughter of the founder of Congress Candy Company, a major manufacturer and distributor of candy. She was prominent in social activities and education. Bill's two brothers, Owen T. Owen Jr. (\\"Tudor\\") and Jack served in the United States Navy and United States Army respectively so when Bill joined the United States Air Force he completed the circle of all three branches of the military. Early life Bill participated in football, baseball, basketball, and track as a young man and became an avid fisherman, water and snow skier, and licensed pilot and one day achieved his dream of parachuting from an airplane. He has said his toughest accomplishment was learning to ride a unicycle. He was editor of his high school newspaper (the Bismarck, North Dakota \\"Hi-Herald\\") and after three years of pre-med studies at the University of Southern California, he switched his major to telecommunications. He started his announcing career at USC working on campus stations KTRU and KUSC- FM. Announcing career Press portrait as an announcer c.1965 After graduating cum laude, Bill entered service and was assigned to the American Forces Network in Germany where he did play-by-play announcing of football, basketball, and baseball. He later returned to North Dakota and worked for KFYR radio and TV in Bismarck as an announcer, sports director, and cowboy entertainer \\"Marshal Bill.\\" Marshal Bill Deputy Card, 1956 Initially, Bill was reluctant to play the part of Marshal Bill; he wanted to focus on doing sports. One other announcer, Gus Becker, heard about the show and was eager to do it if Bill refused. Bill recommended Gus, but the management told Bill he was the right person for it. One year Bill was asked to lead the annual rodeo parade, which is by far the biggest event in Bismarck-Mandan, to the extent that one year they had a Hollywood movie cowboy lead it. Bill practiced riding for several weeks so he would look his best, waving to the crowd and throwing candy kisses to the youngsters along the parade route. While in service he met Rosemary Bobo of Gray Court, South Carolina, a high school home economics teacher, and they were married on October 1, 1955. Their three children are Carolyn, a well-known singer-musician-songwriter/artist/horse-trainer, Richard, a banking executive, and Lisa, a horse-trainer and the owner of a horse stable and riding academy. Bill as Ch7 staff announcer c. late 1950s. Bill joined WLW radio and TV in Cincinnati, Ohio in 1957 as a staff announcer. In 1958-1960 he hosted a classical and semi-classical music radio program called \\"Music for You\\" which surprisingly beat rock stations in the ratings. Bill had an eclectic taste in music, later emceeing rock, pop, and big band formats.

Bill was also selected to become a disc jockey on WABC radio (\\"MusicRadio 77\\") as one of the station's original \\"Swinging Seven\\" which also included Scott Muni, Herb Oscar Anderson, Chuck Dunaway, Jack Carney, Farrell Smith, and Charlie Greer (who was known for always spraying the microphone for germs when his shift began).Bill Owen's Profile at WABC MusicRadio 77\\"Those Great DJs\\" List of WABC DJs The WABC Swingin' Sound Survey (1961), Bill Owen at lower- right. The publicity for the \\"Swinging Seven\\" was enormous: full page photos of the DJs in the major newspapers, billboards with their photos scattered around town, posters advertising their \\"Swingin' Sound Surveys\\", and constant playing on air of their promos. They also made public appearances attired in trademark bright red blazers. In 1966 he was elevated from being the show announcer of the award-winning young people's series \\"Discovery\\" to succeeding Frank Buxton as host. He and actress Virginia Gibson (\\"Seven Brides for Seven Brothers\\") continued as hosts for five more years, traveling throughout the world. During his years at ABC, Bill co-wrote with announcer Allan Jefferys a novel about a disc jockey titled \\"DJ\\" published by Popular Library. Later he collaborated with Frank Buxton on a volume initially self-published as \\"Radio's Golden Age: the Programs and the Personalities\\", by Easton Valley Press. This was later greatly expanded, re-titled, and published as ‚ÄúThe Big Broadcast 1920-1950‚Äù (Viking Press, Avon paperback). It was later re-issued in 1997 as a second edition by Scarecrow Press.Buxton, Frank and Owen, Bill, The Big Broadcast 1920-1950 at Scarecrow Press This was the first encyclopedia of old-time radio programs. While working as a free-lancer, Bill did many on- camera and voice-over commercials for national television, and portrayed Ellery Queen in the nationally syndicated series \\"Ellery Queen's Minute Mysteries\\". It ran for many years on radio stations, allowing time for local commercials. Bill also wrote the popular syndicated panel \\"Return With Us To...\\" with drawing by comic strip artist Don Sherwood.Don Sherwood, \\"Return With Us To...\\" comic strip original art at Heritage Auctions, icollector.com This nostalgic remembrance of the past enjoyed a long run in Grit, a national weekly newspaper. Bill Owen - King of Trivia From 1982-1990, Bill was announcer for ABC-TV's \\"World News this Morning\\" where he contributed brief trivia items along with puzzles and quotations. That segment became the most popular part of the program and developed a cult following. In addition he appeared on the program and on \\"Good Morning America\\" as a sports anchor. His sports knowledge also led to assignments on \\"ABC's Wide World of Sports\\" and live coverage of the Olympics. In 1962 he covered the America's Cup yacht races from Newport, Rhode Island for ABC Radio from the Goodyear blimp. After leaving ABC in 1990, Bill was the principal voice of superstation WWOR-TV for three and a half years and then brought back WNEW's legendary \\"Make Believe Ballroom\\" for two radio stations in New Jersey where he interviewed such stars as Tony Martin, Cyd Charisse, Kitty Kallen, Margaret Whiting, Al Martino, Les Paul, Patti Page, Julius La Rosa, Jo Stafford, Les Brown, Frankie Laine, Don Cornell, and Patty Andrews.

The L-649 was planned to be the new standard version of the Constellation, but the L-749 Constellation, a co-jointly produced improved deritative, was chosen over the L-649 by most airlines. Most of the few L-649 aircraft built were delivered and operated by Eastern Air Lines. History When Curtiss-Wright offered an improved version of the Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone, Lockheed began developing an improved version of the L-049 Constellation airliner to be powered by this engine. The new project was designated L-049-84. In addition to the engine change, the wing and fuselage structure were strengthened to allow an increased gross weight. The cabin was redesigned and made more luxurious, incorporating changes such as retractable overhead sleeping berths, modernised air conditioning and retractable seats. Ten different cabin layouts were offered. Due to the loudness of the R-3350 engines, the insulation had been augmented through the use of multiple materials including non-inflammable cloth and fiberglass. The problem of overheating that plagued the original engines had been eliminated through the newer design of the R-3350 and the oil tanks being moved away from the engine nacelles. The oil tank capacity was also increased by 9 gallons. The payload was increased by 1,846 pounds. An extra removable cargo hold was designed to increase the payload of the aircraft. This was called a \\"Speedpak\\", and was to be used for shorter flights. The result was a completely new design, causing Lockheed to redesignate the aircraft L-649 due to the significant changes. The first L-649 flew on October 19, 1946, and it received its certification in May 1947. The first L-649 was also delivered to Eastern Air Lines in May 1947. Eastern had modified its original order for 14 L-049 Constellations to 14 L-649 Constellations. Eastern was also the only airline to receive the L-649 straight from the production line itself, as Trans World Airlines and Air France converted their ordered L-649 aircraft into the improved derivative, the L-749 Constellation, which was to be produced alongside the L-649. In fact, the L-749 entered service a month before the L-649 did. A further incident occurred when TWA suffered a pilots' strike, causing them to cancel the original order for 8 L-049 and 18 L-649 aircraft. Only 16 original L-649 aircraft were produced. Six others were converted to L-649A standard and delivered to Chicago and Southern Air Lines. Most of the L-649 and L-649A aircraft would later be converted to L-749 and L-749A standards. When Chicago and Southern merged with Delta in 1953, several of these airplanes were sold to TWA.Lockheed Constellation Survivors - L649/L749 Constellation; Petersen, Ralph M.; Retrieved 6/5/11California Classic Proliners - Lockheed Constellations; Gibson, Tom; Retrieved 6/5/11 Variants ;L-649 :Standard production version, powered by four R-3350-749C18BD-1 engines. 16 built. ;L-649A :Strengthened structure and extra fuel capacity for longer distances. 6 built.

This fish can reach a length of TL though most fish do not exceed TL. It can be free-swimming, or can attach itself to a host fish or turtle by means of a sucker on the back of the head. Description Echeneis neucratoides is a slender remora growing to a maximum length of about . There are bands of small sharp teeth in both jaws, and further bands of teeth on the vomer and palate, as well as granular teeth on the tongue. On the top of the head is a large oval sucker, formed from the modified front dorsal fin, by which the fish attaches to a host fish. There are between 18 and 22 lamellae in this sucker as compared to the 23 to 28 possessed by the closely related Echeneis naucrates. The pelvic fins have narrow bases, the pectoral fins have moderately pointed tips and are composed of 22 rays, the hind dorsal fin has 32 to 41 rays and the anal fin, 30 to 38. The dorsal surface of the fish is dark brown to black, as is a broad longitudinal lateral stripe which extends from the eye through the pectoral fin to the caudal peduncle. The other parts of the fish are silvery-grey. The dorsal, pectoral and caudal fins are dark with whitish margins, particularly at the front of the fins. San Pedro, Belize Distribution This fish occurs in the subtropical western Atlantic Ocean, the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico, within an area bounded by 43¬∞N and 4¬∞N, and 98¬∞W and 51¬∞W that stretches from Massachusetts to the northern coast of South America, including the Bahamas and the Antilles. It is usually associated with reefs but also occurs further offshore. Ecology Echeneis neucratoides is sometimes free- swimming, but at other times attaches itself with its sucker to a host animal such as a shark, other large fish or turtle. Remoras often feed on scraps of food discarded by their hosts, and may also consume the parasitic copepods on their skin. Status The taxonomic status of this species has been questioned and molecular studies need to be done to clarify this. Its range seems to be rather more restricted than most other remoras and its population trend is unclear, although it faces no particular threats. Because of these factors, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has been unable to assess its conservation status, and has classified it as \\"data deficient\\".

The film was presumed lost, although recently a 10 minute condensed 16 mm home movie version was discovered, and has since been released with a music score by Ben Model, in his latest compilation Accidentally Preserved No.4.  Story  Tom Silverton is a wrongly accused man whose real name is Phil Bradbury. He was engaged to society girl Kate Van Dyke, but she falls in love with another man. When there is a murder in the Van Dyke home, Bradbury is the primary suspect. He departs before the police can apprehend him and goes to the out-of-the way town of Marlow where he takes the name Tom Silverton. He appears to be a simple drunkard, but Ruth Blake tries to sober him up. She is ostracized by the rest of the town as a result. When Kate and Mark come to town, they spot Tom (Phil) but before he can escape a forest fire surrounds the town. Tom is the only one who kows how to operate the locomotive, but in operating it he will reveal his true identity. He does so, saving the townsfolk. He is exonerated of the crimes and marries Ruth.

The play had been based on the hymn The Ninety and Nine,The Ninety and Nine, by Elizabeth C. Clephane, 1868. which had been, in its own turn, inspired by Luke 15:7. The play concerned the redemption of a fallen man (the single sheep, \\"Far off from the gates of gold\\") while the rest of the town stood idly by (the other ninety-nine \\"that safely lay/In the shelter of the fold\\"). The new version was intended to be a big production. \\"Miss Moore will have as her leading man Warner Baxter.

Photo: Hansen, Schou & Weller Siegfried Saloman (born 2 October 1816 in T√∏nder, Denmark - died on 22 July 1899 in Dalar√∂, Sweden) was a Danish violinist and composer. A contemporary of Franz Liszt, he was a pupil of Johannes Frederik Fr√∂hlich, Holger Simon Paulli, Frederik Thorkildsen Wexschall and Johan Peter Emilius Hartmann, from whom he received violin- playing lessons. He toured extensively throughout Europe with the Swedish opera singer Henriette Nissen, to whom he was married in 1850. In 1842 his nine booklets of romances and songs were published in Hamburg. Life Siegfried Saloman, born Solomon, was the son of the merchant Isaac Solomon (1782-1848) and Veilchen Geskel (1787-1836). He was the brother of the artist and the founder of the Gothenburg Museum of Art, Geskel Saloman (1821-1902), and Nota Saloman (1823‚Äì85), who was a chief medical officer for the Danish army. Since his father's business was no longer doing so well, the family moved to Copenhagen in 1829. As early as a 12-year-old Siegfried Saloman already played the violin, so he continued his studies in Copenhagen under the guidance of J. P. E. Hartmann, among others. In 1838 he received a 3-year scholarship which he used to stay in Dessau, where he studied music theory and composition with Friedrich Schneider. The last six months of the scholarship period he spent in Dresden, where he continued his studies with Karol Lipi≈Ñski. He became a teacher in Copenhagen, Germany and St. Petersburg, where he lived for a few years. Together with his wife, the Swedish opera singer Henriette Nissen, he made extensive concert tours in Europe. The couple were married in 1850 in the Netherlands. After his wife's death in 1879 he began living in Stockholm. His first songs Tordenskjold i Dynekilen and Diamantkorset had no success in Copenhagen, and his third ballad opera, Hjertet p√• pr√∏ve, was not well accepted either. Therefore, in 1847 he left Copenhagen and traveled to Germany where his Diamantkorset was well received in Berlin and Leipzig. In 1850 he was invited to Weimar by Franz Liszt, where his comic opera Das Korps der Rache was written. His Stockholm years were particularly important in his career once several of his early works and a number of new ones were written. He died after a few years of infirmity contracted during a summer stay in the Swedish island of Dalar√∂.

Life He was a foundling, and as such was reared in the parish workhouse of St. Dunstan's-in-the-East. At the age of twelve he was apprenticed to a greengrocer, but ran away to Birmingham, where he worked in the factories. After his return to London in 1776, his chief occupation was that of buying old wigs. His extraordinary appearance, and the droll way in which he clapped his hands to his mouth and called \\"old wigs\\", used always to attract a crowd of people after him in the streets. On the death of \\"Sir\\" John Harper in 1785, \\"Sir\\" Jeffrey was elected mayor of Garrat. The custom of the Garrat elections seems to have had its origin in a petty act of local injustice. Certain encroachments on Garrat Common, situated between Wandsworth and Tooting in Surrey, led to the formation of an association of the inhabitants for the protection of their rights. The head of this association was called the mayor, and one of the rules was that he should be re-chosen after every general election. The public soon entered into the joke, the mock-election became highly popular, and the most eccentric characters were brought forward as candidates. The popularity of the entertainment is sufficiently attested by the following entry in the 'Gentleman's Magazine' under 25 July 1781: While Sir Richard Phillips relates that: Possessing a large fund of vulgar wit, Sir Jeffrey was the most popular of the candidates who ever appeared on the Garrett hustings. He was successful at three successive elections, but in 1796 was ousted from his office by \\"Sir\\" Harry Dimsdale, a muffin-seller and dealer in tinware. This was the last election which took place at Garrett, though an unsuccessful attempt to revive the custom was made some thirty years after. In Charles Lamb's Reminiscence of Sir Jeffery Dunstan, cites Hone's Every Day Book volume ii. cols. 842‚Äì4. reference is made to the attempt to bring Dunstan out on the Haymarket stage, in the part of Dr. Last. Dunstan appeared on some trade tokens issued by Thomas Hall, Taxidermist of City Road Finsbury. The tokens were issued in 1795 in connection with Halls trade as a taxidermist and his exhibition of stuffed animals at his home in City Road dubbed the Finsbury Museum. The tokens commemorated the fact that Hall had employed Dunstan as a huckster at his exhibits at the Bartholomew Fair. Face of Trade token issued by T.Hall, Finsbury 1795 Dunstan died in 1797, and was buried in Whitechapel churchyard.

Excavations at the Nazlet Khater 2 site (Boulder Hill) yielded the remains of two human skeletons in 1980. One of the skulls was that of a male subadult. The cranium was generally modern in form, but with very wide face, and it evinced some archaic traits in the temple and mandible areas. Below the skull, the skeleton was robust, but otherwise, anatomically modern. Morphological analysis of the Nazlet Khater mandible indicates that the specimen was distinct from the examined Late Pleistocene and Holocene North African specimens. The Nazlet Khater 2 skeleton possesses two plesiomorphic features in its mandible, which are not found among coeval, anatomically modern, humans. This suggests that the ancestors of the specimen may have interbred with neighboring late archaic humans. At Nazlet Khater 4 to the southeast, Upper Paleolithic axes, blades, burins, end scrapers, and denticulates were also excavated. The site has been radiocarbon dated to between 30,360-35,100 years ago. The similarities between NK2 and Upper Paleolithic European samples may indicate a close relationship between this Nile Valley specimen and European Upper Paleolithic modern humans.

While in Germany he wrote a book in 1975 entitled Nobody's Friend, which got him arrested because the Kamuzu Banda regime thought that it was written about Kamuzu Banda. Mpasu was detained without trial for \\"two years, one month, one week, and one day\\" in Mikuyu Prison from 1975 to 1977. From 1978 Mpasu worked at Lever Bros (now Unilever) in various capacities until 1988 when he was seconded to run the Malawi Confederation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry (MCCCI).Kondwani Kamiyala: Sam Mpasu, the writer. In 1991, while working for Xerographics, he joined a secret group headed by Bakili Muluzi whose aim was to build up opposition to Banda. When the United Democratic Front was voted into government in 1994, Mpasu was elected Member of Parliament for Ntcheu Central, and appointed Minister of Education and Government Chief Whip in Parliament. He later served as Minister of Commerce and Speaker of the Malawi House of Assembly. His appointment as Minister of Commerce met with a lot of resistance since he was the Speaker of the House at that time.

He was accused of receiving kickbacks and failing to use normal channels of awarding contracts for awarding a British company, Fieldyork, a deal to provide Malawi with millions of notebooks and pencils when he served as Minister of Education. However, his incarceration was received with ambivalence after having been tried prior to the 2008 court case while he was Minister as a gesture to clear his name. D.D. Phiri, a prominent historian and writer in Malawi, wrote in the Nation on October 13, 2009: \\"In its 1994 manifesto, UDF pledged to introduce free primary education in Malawi. When he won the presidency, Bakili Muluzi appointed Sam Mpasu as Minister of Education. The Minister of Education was more anxious than most people that exercise books and pencils be made available in time, otherwise the free primary schooling programme was going to fail.\\" Mpasu was released from jail in 2010 instead of 2014 due to good behaviour.

Women in the French Resistance played an important role in the context of the resistance to occupying German forces during World War II. Women represented 15 to 20% of the total number of French Resistance fighters within the country. Women also represented 15% of political deportations to Nazi-run concentration camps. Actions in the French Resistance Identification photo of Claude Rodier, a Master Sergeant with the Mouvements Unis de la R√©sistance (MUR) from 1940 to 1944; she died at Ravensbr√ºck concentration camp. Women were generally confined to underground roles in the French Resistance network. Lucie Aubrac, who has become a symbol of the French Resistance within France, never had a clearly defined role in the hierarchy of the movement, which in her case involved the regional Southern Liberation. H√©l√®ne Viannay, more highly educated than her husband Philippe Viannay, the founder of the D√©fense de la France, did not write one single article for the clandestine newspaper of the same name, nor did the other companions of the chiefs of the D√©fense de la France, although they did take part in meetings to edit the newspaper. On the other hand, Suzanne Buisson, cofounder of the Comit√© d'action socialiste (CAS) was the treasurer until her arrest. Only one woman, Marie-Madeleine Fourcade, was a head of a network (by leading the British to believe that the true head of the Alliance network was actually a man). No woman ever led a movement, or a maquis (guerilla group) or a Liberation Committee, none was installed as a Commissioner within the Provisional Government of the Republic of France or a Minister of the Liberation. Only a limited minority took part in the armed battles. Although women were typical partisan resistance fighters in Italy, Greece, Yugoslavia and the occupied USSR, feared and as numerous as men, they were a small minority in the maquis in France. It has been speculated that this may have been influenced by the fact that French women were not subject to the Service du travail obligatoire (English: Compulsory Work Service; STO), as were women in other occupied territories. Women organized demonstrations of housewives in 1940, were active in the comit√©s populaires of the clandestine PCF, and ever present with encouragement and material aid for strikers, as in the Nord-Pas- de-Calais in May 1941, as well as supporting the maquisH.R. Kedward, √Ä la recherche du maquis, 1999 They were indispensable as typists, and above all as liaison agents‚Äîin part because the Germans distrusted women less, and also because the numerous identification controls against resistors of the Service du travail obligatoire (STO) did not apply to them. Historian Olivier Wieviorka emphasizes that the strategy of these movements was often, in fact to put women into missions that required visibility, since they were less exposed to repression: the Vichy government of occupied France and the German military were not able to fire on French women demanding food for their children. Individual sacrifices A plaque on a house in Paris, commemorating Berty Albrecht, who helped found the Mouvement Combat (MLN), and who was executed at Fresnes on May 29, 1943. Some of the most prominent women in the French Resistance were Marie-H√©l√®ne Lefaucheux who was chief of the women's section of the Organisation civile et militaire. She was also a member of the Paris Liberation Committee. Following the French Liberation, she was a Deputy and then Senator of the French government. Touty Hiltermann played a decisive role in the establishment and functioning of the Dutch-Paris movement. Germaine Tillion became head of the Hauet-Vild√© Resistance network from 1941 to 1942, later approved by the larger Resistance network Groupe du mus√©e de l'Homme. H√©l√®ne Studler organized r√©seau d'√©vasions, networks for smuggling dissidents out of France. Thousands of prisoners and Resistance members escaped to freedom through her work. She organized the escape of Fran√ßois Mitterrand, the future President of France; Boris Holban, founder of the network FTP-MOI in March 1942; and General Henri Giraud on April 17, 1942. It is also worth noting that innumerable clandestine combatants survived the war as part of a couple, and that their Resistance participation would have been impossible or insurvivable without the support of their companion at their side: C√©cile and Henri Rol-Tanguy, Raymond and Lucie Aubrac, Paulette and Maurice Kriegel-Valrimont, H√©l√®ne and Philippe Viannay, Marie-H√©l√®ne and Pierre Lefaucheux, Cletta and Daniel Mayer, and many others were inseparable. There were numerous women in the Resistance who married and had children entirely clandestinely, without interrupting their Resistance struggle. Some saved the lives of their husbands, such as Lucie Aubrac or Marie-H√©l√®ne Lefaucheux. Others shared their struggle up to torture, deportation and death, such as Madeleine Truel. A famous deportation convoy, on January 24, 1943, included many communists and widows of men shot by the occupation regime, including Ma√Ø Politzer, wife of Georges Politzer, or H√©l√®ne Solomon, daughter of the great scholar Paul Langevin and wife of writer Jacques Solomon.  Legacy  Delphine Aigle, French Resistance member in Romilly-sur-Seine, honoured with a plaque on her home after the end of the War. While the CNR neglected to mention giving the vote to women in its programme of renewal in March 1944, Charles de Gaulle signed the order declaring women's suffrage for French citizens in Algiers, on April 2, 1944. The emancipating role of the women in the French Resistance was thus recognized. There are few monuments honouring the actions of these women. One of the exceptions is the city of Riom, which has honoured two of its citizens with a specific monument: Marinette Menut, Lieutenant-Pharmacist of the MURs d'Auverne and Claude Rodier-Virlogeux, Master Sergeant of the MURs d'Auvergne.

After receiving her doctorate in Clinical Psychology from Temple University, Ritterman is noted for her expertise regarding survivors of political torture and their families. She is a prolific author whose work has been translated into Spanish, German, Italian and French. One of Milton Erickson‚Äôs foremost students, Ritterman originated the concept of the symptom as a trance state that is actually suggested by various people and social structures. From this basic concept that Erickson himself admired, she framed therapy as the production of counter-inductions and hypnotic sequences that impact the symptom trance. In recent years Ritterman has lectured nationally and internationally on using hypnosis in conjunction with family therapy and more particularly against socially violent governments and their abusive use of psychological methods and techniques. She also lectures on the survival techniques of families experiencing torture. Michele Ritterman lives in Berkeley, California and currently has a private practice as an individual, couples and family therapist. She also consults with agencies and teaches classes at universities, holds workshops, and lectures about her clinical methods.  Family therapy and hypnosis Ritterman has trained psychotherapists worldwide in her approach to working with couples and families. In family and couple interactions Ritterman believes there are shared and separate-track trances that can be treated through the development of therapeutic counter-inductions. She employs naturally occurring altered states of consciousness as part of a systematic hypnotherapeutic process. Her approach is based on observable actions and interactions on the part of her client(s). Ritterman also originated the concept of the symptom as a gift and therapy as a mutually dignifying process of cooperative exchanges between therapist and client, in other words, a form of prestation. She calls this methodology a woman's spin on therapy, based on a non-hierarchical approach to every step of a systematic therapeutic sequence. Her latest book The Tao of a Woman The Tao of a Woman, (Skipping Stones Editions 2009) demonstrates how to move from the symptom trance to a healing stance. Ritterman is a proponent of a humanist perspective in psychotherapy, where instead of the traditional analysis of patients as damaged, the individual is seen as a positive, unique and evolving person, a one-of-a-kind. Her book in progress From Trance to Stance advocates that the primary goal of psychology is to help create a human-friendly society that caters to the bio-rhythms and natural needs of the human organism.  Political activism As a political activist Ritterman has served as a spokesperson for Amnesty International and other human rights organizations on the resilience and resourcefulness of families that endure and survive under terror. She has published numerous papers on the subject and founded or co-founded three organizations giving medical and social aid to people in developing countries who would not otherwise receive it because of their political status. Her book Hope Under Siege: Terror and Family Support in Chile Hope Under Siege: Terror and Family Support in Chile (Ablex Publishing 1991) with a foreword by Isabel Allende, considers the applications of psychotherapeutic principles in the larger context of political and social reality. In Ritterman‚Äôs words ‚ÄúReciprocity is the highest form of love. And love has everything to do with healing.‚Äù (The Tao of a Woman) In the forward to Hope Under Siege Isabel Allende writes: \\"Michele Ritterman has immersed herself in a complex and frightening reality, to discover its secrets and capture its deepest essence. Through the families of political prisoners, she tells us of an abused continent, of a time of horror, and of the incredible extent of human evil. But this book is not a retelling of death and pain. It is above all a testimony of hope.

History  Based in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, the group consists of two brothers: drummer Andrew Barr and songwriter and guitar player Brad Barr, both from Providence, Rhode Island. The third original member is harpist Sarah Pag√© who discontinued touring with the band in 2018. Other instrumentation and musicians are added on tour, as needed. Brad and Andrew Barr moved to Montreal from Providence, RI in 2005 after a decade of touring and recording as ‚Öî of the trio, The Slip. That group was noted for its approach to long-form, live improvisation and was equally considered part of the jam band and experimental music scenes. Soon after moving to Montreal, Brad heard the sounds of a harp through the bedroom wall of his new apartment. He went next door to introduce himself to Sarah Pag√©, who was performing both in classical contexts and developing music with the songwriter Lhasa de Sela. Andrew also began performing with Lhasa. Soon the trio of Andrew, Brad and Sarah began performing Brad's songs under the Barr Brothers name, building upon them with Malian rhythms, slide guitar, homemade percussion instruments, and influences from delta blues, modern classical and Appalachian folk traditions. The band's recordings have been nominated three times for Juno Awards (in 2013, 2015 and 2018 for Adult Alternative Album of the Year.). Their self-titled debut album The Barr Brothers was released in 2011 and focused on acoustic and electrified songs rooted in Appalachian folk. Their second album Sleeping Operator (2014) further explored the connections between the Delta blues and its West and North African ancestry. Leftover songs from the Sleeping Operator sessions were released as a five-track collection Alta Falls (2015). Their third album Queens of the Breakers was released in autumn 2017. The band tours frequently in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and Europe with some shows played in Japan. Notable venues have included Levon Helm's studio in Woodstock, New York, the Red Rocks Amphitheater, and two appearances on the Late Show with David Letterman.  Career  = 2011‚Äì2013: The Barr Brothers = Their first song \\"Beggar In The Morning\\" debuted on Paste Magazine. Their debut, self-titled LP was released on September 27, 2011 via Secret City Records.[2] The band toured throughout North America and Europe to support the record, with notable appearances including Osheaga, a first performance on the Late Show with David Letterman, and a headline slot on the main stage Sc√®ne TD de la place des Festivals at the Montreal Jazz Festival, performing for a crowd estimated at more than 30,000. Notable media appearances included the use of \\"Ooh, Belle\\" in an episode of the television series Touch. The album went on to receive a Juno Nomination in 2013 for Adult Alternative Album of the Year. = 2014‚Äì2016: Sleeping Operator, Alta Falls = In the interim between records, the band made a notable live performance at Oregon's Pickathon in 2014. Their sophomore album Sleeping Operator was released in October 2014. Award nominations included a 2016 nod for Most Illustrious Band Outside of Quebec by ADISQ, the Quebec music award council and a 2015 Juno nomination for Adult Alternative Album of the Year. The record was promoted with global touring. Notable support dates included shows with Calexico and My Morning Jacket in the United States and Europe. The My Morning Jacket tour included the Barr Brothers' first performance at Colorado's Red Rocks Amphitheatre. As headliners, the group were invited to perform at the Midnight Ramble Sessions at the Levon Helm studios in Woodstock, NY, performed on the main stage at Osheaga, and Yellowknife, Canada's Folk on The Rocks festival. Their most notable headline show was at the Grand √âv√®nement of the Montreal Jazz Festival, playing to an estimated crowd of 50,000. Many musician friends made appearances at this show: Patrick Watson, Robbie Kuster (Patrick Watson), Joe Grass, Michelle Tompkins (Sin & Swoon), Mamadou Kouyat√©, Laurel Sprengelmeyer (Little Scream). Outside of the band, the Barrs participated in a tribute to The Grateful Dead on the Lachine Canal in the summer of 2016. Following the October 2016 death of Leonard Cohen, Brad Barr participated in a tribute to Cohen's music put together by POP Montreal. In 2016, the group released several of their favourite misfit tracks in the Alta Falls EP. The songs on the EP were partially recorded in Iceland by Valgeir Sigur√∂sson (Bj√∂rk, Sigur R√≥s, Nico Muhly). = 2017‚Äìpresent: Recording and collaboration = Taking a step back from several years of heavy-touring, the band focused on writing and recording new music.Budnick, Dean https://relix.com/articles/detail/track_by_track_the_barr_brothers_queens_of_the_breakers/ Relix Anticipated collaborations with the Malian duo Bassekou Kouyate and Amy Sacko were scheduled for the 2017 editions of the Festival d‚Äô√ât√© de Qu√©bec and the Montreal International Jazz Festival but were cancelled due to Kouyate and Sacko encountering Visa issues. Replacement players were found in Burkinab√© balafonist Mamadou Koita and Senegalese kora player Sadio Sissoko and the resulting show was well reviewed. Of the interplay between the harp and kora, the Montreal Gazette noted \\"Despite the lack of historical connection between the two instruments, it made perfect sense in the Barr Brothers‚Äô diverse, thoughtful musical universe\\". In autumn of 2017, the Barr Brothers released their third full length album Queens of the Breakers, were invited to open for The War on Drugs across Europe and the UK, and scheduled their own headline shows in major markets in North America, Europe and the United Kingdom. In January 2018, Sarah Pag√© left the band to pursue other interests. In 2018, Compulsion Games revealed that the brothers worked on the soundtrack and performed the songs for the game We Happy Few. In October 2018, The Barr Brothers won the F√©lix award for Concert of the Year - Anglophone. They were also nominated in four other categories at Gala de l'ADISQ: Album of the Year - Anglophone, Quebec Artist with the Most Success Outside of Quebec, Sound Recording and Mix of the Year, Soundman of the Year.

Chojnice, Poland; Wallis Mako ensemble from Wallis and Futuna In Uvea (Wallis) and Futuna culture and modernity co-exist. In particular, dance is considered to be part of everyday life. One sees dance in fakahaha'aga (festivals), to'oto'oga (ceremonies or celebrations), or just for pure pleasure. In Uvea, the term faiva is used for dance, whereas the term mako is used. In Uvea and Futuna there is a katoaga which is only celebrated with the visit of chiefs and if lucky, with the Lavelua (King). As the years go by, dance and culture is still alive and well in Uvea and Futuna. The normal fakapale is given to the dancers for their magnificent dance. The following dances of Uvea and Futuna below are just some of the dances, or are the main dances seen in Wallisian and Futunan culture. Eke The Eke is a stick dance performed by both genders. The Eke started travelling during the Tongan overlordship of Uvea and Futuna in the 14th century. In Tonga they have a same but different stick dance called Soke. The dancers are armed with sticks about four feet [1.2m] long formed two lines facing each other. During the dance the pair of male and females struck the sticks together in a manner similar to quarterstaff sparring. Kailao This is the most popular of the implement dances seen in Uvea and Futuna. It's a club dance performed without a song 'to the rhythm of a wooden pate (gong) or an empty kerosene tin. Two parties of male dancers approached each other from opposite sides of the mala'e (village green), usually in columns of twos. During the dance they went through 'a drill of vigorous twirling, swinging, and slapping motions' with the clubs. TƒÅpaki/Tu'upaki The TƒÅ-paki (Futuna) or Tapaki (Uvea) is an implement dance using broad, flat paddles (paki) which are twirled, tossed and slapped by the dancers. In Futuna, TƒÅpaki is performed only by men, whereas in Uvea it can involve females to perform with the males. The TƒÅpaki/ Tu'upaki is performed in honour of the chief (aliki) of a village, his ancestors and their deedss The dance is originally from Futuna but has spread to Uvea and also to Tonga where they have a similar paddle dance called Me'etu'upaki. Niutao Wallisian girls perform a dance called faka Niutao somewhere in the South of Wallis Island, 1943. Extract of a movie from the US Navy. The Niutao or Fakaniutao (Futuna) is a dance that was named after one of the islands of Tuvalu. This dance can be performed either by men alone, women alone or the two together. It follows the elements of the Tuvaluan FƒÅtele, but slightly more gracefully rather than extreme gestures. The accompanying song is Europeanised, and the tempo is usually accelerated from beginning to end. Sasa The Sasa is a sitting dance borrowed from the neighbouring islands of Samoa. The dance consists of fast and slow actions to the accompanying chorus. There is no singing in this dance but the instruments are played, which makes the Wallis/Futuna version different from that of the Samoan version which consists of no instruments but the log drum (papa). The pulotu or dance leader normally leads the dance and makes sure that each dancer is following in time. The Sasa is performed at festivals and occasions. Lakalaka This is performed after the Sasa, and is the singing segment in which the songs are included with the sitting dance. Each verse is very significant and is composed carefully by the ma'u fatu hiva (song composer/poet). Normally in a Lakalaka the first stanza is supposed to greet the King and its colony of chiefs. The lakalaka in particular is normally Wallis/Futuna's main dance seen in the islands; performing for the favour of their King, or after a Kava ceremony; whatever the case the people are there to perform it! Soamako The Soamako has been described as an informal type of dance accompanied by continuously accelerating music, the final speed of which was 'limited only by the energy of the singers and dancers'. Generally the dancers themselves did not sing but were accompanied by a lologo (chorus) grouped with wooden drums, guitars, ukuleles and nafa (which is made out of an empty bin with the top made of black rubber). The song usually consisted of couplets, repeated until the dancers grew weary. As well, there is an informal type of Soamako of today, described as a 'combat dance' between two groups of dancers who enter from opposite sides alternately and try to better the performance of their opponents.

It was not assembled in time, and the aircraft was not allowed to enter the competition. The Aerial Wheel The Aerial Wheel was the brainchild of George Sturgess of Mablethorpe, Lincolnshire. It was a novel idea for the undercarriage of an aircraft, which Flight magazine had thought interesting enough to publish. Sturgess's explanation, accompanied by a photograph of a model appears in the issue dated 10 Dec 1910.\\"The Sturgess Landing Wheel\\" Flight 10 December 1910 His idea was in effect a wheel where only the rim revolves, using a pair of twelve-foot diameter hoops each of which would be free to rotate while being held in place by bearings mounted on a cradle of struts. The wing passed through the middle of the wheels. The intention was to produce a wheel that, having a large diameter, would easily roll over the rough grass surfaces that aircraft operated from at the time: ease of take off and landing from rough ground were prominent among the War Office requirements. Whatever the merits of the idea, it was far beyond the manufacturing and material technologies of the day. The Aerial Wheel Syndicate Monoplane Sturgess's idea was incorporated into an aircraft built in Birmingham in collaboration with Ralph Platts, a keen member of the Birmingham Aero club who had successfully flown a canard glider of his own design during 1911.\\"The Birmingham Aero Club Gliders\\" Flight 13 December 1913 Platt is probably largely responsible for the airframe, which differs greatly from Sturgess's model. This was a tractor monoplane with a pair of his wheels. Neither wing nor tailplane have any dihedral, and there is no rudder. The aircraft that was built was of canard configuration, with swept wings that changed section and angle of incidence considerably between the roots and wingtips: deeply cambered inboard, and changing to a flatter section with upswept tips, producing wash-out to enhance stability. Stability would also have resulted from the dihedral of the wings. Lateral control was by wing- warping, the control wires being taken to the raked wingtips via kingposts. A small nacelle projecting forward from the wing housed the 50 hp (37 kW) N.E.C. engine driving the tractor propeller, behind which the pilot and passenger sat side by side at the leading edge of the wing. A monoplane elevator was carried on long booms in front of the aircraft. The undercarriage was now reduced to a single Aerial Wheel half above and half below the wing and passing through it just behind the cockpit, with its centre just aft of the propeller. It was supported by struts running back from the lower leading quadrant, and a pair of long skids trailing from the fuselage were fitted to stop it keeling over and damaging the wings. Whatever Platt contributed to the design, it was not a rudder: there seems to have been no provision for directional control. Although the aircraft was delivered to Larkhill in the stipulated 30 ft by 9 ft by 9 ft crate, its makers did not manage to assemble their aircraft before the actual flight trials were to begin, and it made no appearance of any sort.

OMTROLL was basically created so as to: exploit the practical analysis of OMT, eliminate the ambiguity and vagueness in OMT, and to exploit the formal system specifications provided bt TROLL. Brief History There has been considerable research going on, over the past years in the areas of Object Oriented Analysis and Object Oriented formal specifications. OMT life cycle analysis concentrates mainly in software development practice whereas TROLL, oblog, FOOPS etc. are formal languages developed mainly with a mathematical background, having their roots in logic, algebra, set theory etc. The need to combine these two areas of Object Oriented approaches into a single formalism, is because the OO analysis methods do not reach the level of ordering achieved by the formal specification languages. These formal languages are being used research and applied in various software development projects. TROLL vs OMT TROLL is a formal language used to specify an object system. It is more concerned with the dynamic behaviour of an object over time. In TROLL, an object can change in a discrete manner due to certain events. The object can be created by the occurrence of certain events (birth event) and ended by the occurrence of certain other events (death events). The current state of an object is specified by it attributes. A role is the part played by an object temporarily and a specialization is the role played by it permanently. Objects can also be components of other objects-composite objects, or may be connected by means of some interaction. Also views can be defined that contain only certain information of the current state of the object. Now the central idea of TROLL is to interpret such an object as a set of observable sequential processes. So the object lifetime would be a series of events occurring on the object, and the current state of the object would depend on all the events that have occurred on it in the past. OMT model of a system consists of: * The Object model represents the structure of objects in the system, similar to an ER diagram. * The Dynamic model shows the control aspects of the system like time, interactions between objects etc. * The Functional model defines the meaning of operations and how values are changed due to interactions in the system. Now the drawback of OMT is that the various operations on the object are spread over into 3 different models, causing a relationship among the entities in different models (like the dynamic and object model) to become abstract. Also the communication can only be represented in the functional model. Stages in System Analysis System analysis basically consists of following stages: * Structure analysis: gives the details of the hierarchical and organizational structure of the system. * Task analysis: Like its name, it determines which task is done, when it is done and who did it. It processes the input and shows how the output is obtained. * Communication analysis: show how relationships are established between operations, and class interactions. * Document analysis: describes the documents and rules that are used in the system. * Process analysis: gives information about the execution of operations. Diagrammatic representations in OMTROLL =Behaviour Diagram= These are also called State Transition Diagrams. They define the behaviour of the system. They are usually modelled in the initial stages. There are 2 main states- initial and final state. The transition from one state to another is based on conditions/actions. The behavioural diagram is further refined to details. =Community Model= The community model gives an overview of all the object classes and the concurrent objects of the system. An Object class encapsulates the data that describes objects of the same structure and behaviour. A complex object class can have single or multiple components. A complex object class contains many objects. An object can perform various actions at a particular time, but cannot have a concurrency within itself. Also an object class that isn't involved in any sort of relationship(component/specialization) is called an independent object class. Object Class Declaration Diagram This diagram shows the object attributes and their domains, and optional parameters. Object attributes can be : * Object-valued: these are the attributes that behave like a pointer/ reference to the object. These may further be Single or multiple object-valued attributes. Constructors like: set, list, bag, map can be used with multiple object-valued attributes. * Data-valued A community diagram along with its corresponding object class diagram forms the structural part of a system. =Communication diagram= As its name suggests, it diagrammatically represents the communication between objects of the system. OMT doesn't support interaction between objects, so the communication diagram is introduced in OMTROLL. The boxes represent the class and inner boxes refer to events. These event boxes are connected by means of arrows. A precondition can be assigned to events. Communication within a complex object class is also possible. Communication can be of 2 types-a complex object communicating with its components, or concurrent objects communicate with each other. =Data type diagram= For specifying attributes and actions we use user-defined data types (nat,int(integer), real,bool(boolean), string,date etc.). Using these types we construct new data types like lists, records, enumeration etc.  References   External links  * http://wwwalt.ifis.cs.tu- bs.de/publications/tr97/node8.html Category:Object-oriented programming ","title":"OMTROLL"},{"id":"33005312","title":"List of public art in San Francisco"},{"id":"33005336","text":"Eric Aho's \\"Ice Cuts\\" series of paintings installed at the Hood Museum of Art, Dartmouth (2016).

Studies Aho studied at the Central School of Art and Design in London, England, (1986‚Äì87) and received a BFA from the Massachusetts College of Art and Design in 1988. In 1989 he participated in the first exchange of scholars in over thirty years between the U.S. and Cuba. He completed his graduate work at the Lahti Art Institute (now the Lahti University of Applied Sciences) in Finland supported by a Fulbright Scholarship in 1991-92 and an American-Scandinavian Foundation grant in 1993. Career Aho's paintings are noted for the way they simultaneously convey the power and fragility of Nature. In an essay about Aho's painting, Donald Kuspit wrote: \\"He is a master of the natural sublime, but he realizes that intensely experienced nature becomes uncannily abstract, with no loss of concreteness. Aho puts the sublime back in nature, suggesting its abstract structure without denying its concrete fullness.\\" He adds, \\"Aho regenerates abstraction by returning to its roots in the boundless generativity of nature, and with that gives us a fresh aesthetic consciousness of it.\\" From 1989 to 1998 Aho taught painting at the Putney School in Putney, Vermont. Since 1998 Aho has held an adjunct position as visiting lecturer in the Graduate Light Design Program at the University of the Arts in Helsinki, Finland, and has taught at the University of Lapland in Rovaniemi, Finland. He has been a visiting artist and critic at the Burren College of Art in County Clare, Ireland; the Ballinglen Arts Foundation in County Mayo Ireland; the Weir Farm National Historic Trust in Connecticut; Colgate University in Hamilton, New York; the National College of Art in Oslo, Norway; the University of Art and Design in Helsinki, Finland; the St. Paul's School, Concord, New Hampshire and the Harvard Graduate School of Design.

The Oulu Museum of Art in Oulu, Finland; the Fleming Museum at the University of Vermont; The Currier Museum of Art, Manchester, NH; the Hood Museum of Art, Hanover, NH and the New Britain Museum of American Art, CT have presented solo exhibitions. His paintings can be found in public collections throughout the country and abroad including the permanent collections of the Fine Arts Museum of San Francisco, the Springfield Art Museum, the Currier Museum of Art, the Hood Museum of Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.  Ice Cuts  In the winter of 2016 the Hood Museum of Art presented Eric Aho: Ice Cuts curated by Katherine W. Hart. Aho's paintings of stark holes cut into a frozen pond prompted Hart to call Aho \\"One of the leading painters of landscape and the environment of his generation.\\" Ice Cuts also brought praise from Sebastian Smee of the Boston Globe who wrote: \\"Aho‚Äôs paintings enact an answer to mysterious, counterintuitive questions. The dynamic between black water and white ice is also a correlative ‚Äî natural, not forced or contrived ‚Äî of the much-masticated tension in 20th-century art between abstract and representational imagery, between the real and the reproduced.\\" Smee concluded by declaring the work \\"a major accomplishment.\\" In December 2016 Sebastian Smee of the Boston Globe included Eric Aho: Ice Cuts in his \\"year-end round up.\\" Smee wrote, \\"Eric Aho‚Äôs paintings of plunge pools cut out of ice at the Hood at Dartmouth College were fresh, bold, subtle, and urgent.\\" Solo exhibitions = 2017 = Eric Aho: Inflection Point, DC Moore Gallery, New York = 2016 = Eric Aho: An Unfinished Point in a Vast Surrounding, New Britain Museum of American Art, CT Eric Aho: Ice Cuts, Hood Museum of Art, Hanover, NH = 2015 = Eric Aho: Wilderness Studio, DC Moore Gallery, New York = 2013 = Eric Aho: Translation, DC Moore Gallery, New York Eric Aho: In the Landscape, Federal Reserve Board, Washington = 2012 = Transcending Nature: Paintings by Eric Aho, Currier Museum of Art, Manchester, NH = 2011 = Eric Aho: Covert, DC Moore Gallery, New York = 2010 = Occurrence, Tory Folliard Gallery, Milwaukee Eric Aho: Memory and Invention, Hidell Brooks Gallery, Charlotte, NC = 2009 = Eric Aho: Red Winter, DC Moore Gallery, New York Eric Aho: Ice Box, Brattleboro Museum, VT = 2008 = Wilderness, Alpha Gallery, Boston Outermost, Brickwalk Fine Art, West Hartford, CT = 2007 = Quarry, Reeves Contemporary, New York New Paintings, Tory Folliard Gallery, Milwaukee = 2006 = The Becoming Line: Pastel Drawings, Brickwalk Fine Art, West Hartford, CT Copper Field Suite: New Monotypes, Center for Contemporary Printmaking, Norwalk, CT Geography IV, Alpha Gallery, Boston Paintings, Hidell Brooks Gallery, Charlotte, NC = 2005 = New Paintings, Reeves Contemporary, New York Paintings, Tory Folliard Gallery, Milwaukee Monotypes, Devin Borden Hiram Butler Gallery, Houston = 2004 = Paintings, Spheris Gallery, Bellows Falls, VT New Paintings, Alpha Gallery, Boston Texas Papers, Devin Borden Hiram Butler Gallery, Houston = 2003 = The Overstory, Reeves Contemporary, New York Paintings, Gallery BE‚Äô19, Helsinki Recent Work, Paesaggio Gallery, West Hartford, CT The Overhead Lake: New Paintings, Hargate Art Center, St. Paul's School, Concord, NH Tremaine Gallery, Hotchkiss School, Lakeville, CT = 2002 = New Paintings, Munson Gallery, Santa Fe Watershed: Paintings of the Connecticut River Valley, Saint-Gaudens National Historic Site, Cornish, NH Distances: Paintings of New England and Ireland, Alpha Gallery, Boston = 2001 = Three Counties, Spheris Gallery, Walpole, NH The River, Field and Sky: New Paintings, Susan Conway Gallery, Washington = 2000 = Standing Still, New Paintings, Munson Gallery, Santa Fe Pure Geography, Barton-Ryan Gallery, Boston = 1999 = The Distant Landscape: New Paintings, Spheris Gallery, Walpole, NH New Helsinki Views, Galleria Pintura, Helsinki A Passion for Winter: The Landscapes of Eric Aho, Susan Conway Gallery, Washington = 1998 = Recent Paintings, Spheris Gallery, Walpole, NH The Qualities of Heaven and Earth, Oulu City Art Museum, Finland; Vermont College, Montpelier; Embassy of Finland, Washington = 1996 = Nocturnes: Recent Paintings by Eric Aho, Fleming Museum, University of Vermont, Burlington = 1994 = Paintings, Gallery Pelin, Helsinki = 1991 = Paintings from the Hemlock Ravine, Tyler Gallery, Marlboro College, VT  Reviews and Press Mentions  * Smee, Sebastian. \\"The Year in Arts: Much great art, many fine shows, but no blocks busted,\\" Boston Globe, December 16, 2016 * Spiegelman, Willard. \\"In Connecticut, Discovering American Art‚Äôs First Home,\\" The Wall Street Journal, August 8, 2016 * Dunne, Susan. \\"Eric Aho‚Äôs Wartime-Inspired Abstract Landscapes At NBMAA,\\" Hartford Courant, June 27, 2016 * Butler, Sharon. \\"Eric Aho Shadows His Father at the New Britain,\\" Two Coats of Paint (Internet), July 26, 2016 * O‚ÄôShaughnessy, Tracey. \\"The Private Power of Landscapes,\\" Waterbury Republican American, June 5, 2016 * Vermont Public Radio, 2016, \\"Looking Into The Ice, Saxtons River Artist Meditates On Winter\\" * Boston Globe, January 2016, \\"New England artist Aho breaks ice with new body of work\\" * Valley News, February 2016, \\"Art Notes: Painter Eric Aho Looks Deep Into a Hole in the Ice\\" * Art New England, March 2016, \\"Eric Aho, Ice Cuts\\" * American Art Collector, 2016 * DC Moore Gallery Art New England, July/August 2012 * Art News, December 2011 \\"Eric Aho: DC Moore Gallery * Art in America, December 2009 * Art Daily, October 2009, \\"First Presentation of Eric Aho's Work at DC Moore Gallery\\"  Related Publications  Eric Aho: Inflection Point, 2017, introduction by Bridgette Moore and artist statement by Eric Aho, published by DC Moore Gallery, 23 pages Eric Aho: Ice Cuts, January 2016, Katherine W.

Gameplay  In Word Worm, the user forms words from adjacent tiles present in a rectangular grid. The game features two play modes: time trial, in which in the user must earn an increasing number of points in a two-minute interval to advance levels, and free play, where the user advances based on score alone. Bonus points can be earned by forming the bonus word. Similar to Bookworm, longer words, and words formed from less common letters result in more points. In both modes, fire tiles form randomly throughout gameplay. If a word is not formed using the fire tile, it burns through the letter below it. When a fire tile reaches the bottom of the screen, the game is over.  Reception  Shortly after its initial release on February 18, 2011, Word Worm was selected by Google as a featured tablet application for Honeycomb. It received further publicity on February 23 when it was featured on the internet television show, Radio Android. Based on its initial success, Hawk Industries LLC. released versions for the iPhone and iPad in August 2011, for which it has also generally received positive reviews. = Awards = Word Worm has received several awards from fan websites.

Career Graeme graduated from the National Institute of Dramatic Art (NIDA) where he majored in writing, directing and theatre production. He proudly boasts of having wasted more time and spent more of the best years of his life on this lost cause than any man alive (see below). In the 1980s Graeme worked as an Editor with the Australian Caption Centre where he was responsible for editorial control of their closed caption programs. He then embarked on a complete change of career and was hired to interview witnesses for a legal services company. Commissioned by law firms and major insurance companies to prepare and write reports on forensic investigations Graeme started his own company, Brosnans Investigation Services which was tremendously successful and he continues his involvement with the company to this day. In 2003, Graeme co- founded the publishing company, This is My Story, which specialised in the production of Australian biographies. It was later incorporated into AKA Publishing Pty Ltd in 2008. While at NIDA Graeme studied under such luminaries as George Ogilvie (Mad Max, Bodyline) and George Whalley (On Our Selection, Harp in the South) and worked on Whalley‚Äôs Jane Street Theatre production of Waiting for Godot which starred Mel Gibson and Geoffrey Rush. Graeme was Assistant Director on the Robin Lovejoy production of The Old Country which starred the larger-than-life Robert Morley, as well as George Ogilvie‚Äôs Sydney Theatre Company production No Names‚Ä¶No Pack Drill starring Noni Hazelhurst and Mel Gibson. He was the Artistic Director of the Jigsaw Theatre Company (Canberra) and the inaugural Director of the Central West Theatre Group. He has written several plays including The Quest, The Butterflies of Love, and Save Me. His play The Government Investigator had a season at the Q Theatre in Sydney and Conspiracy, a dramatisation of the longest running trial in Australian legal history, was produced at The Rocks Theatre, Sydney. Currently, he is hard at work on a new play, The Cannibals - when a famously reclusive writer discovers that his very private life is to be staged as a play, he hits back and unleashes a firestorm which threatens to tear apart his world. Graeme has also written and co-authored a number of books including One One Five [The story of a 10-year legal dispute over a $115 invoice that went all the way to the High Court], Yellow Melody [The memoir of the mad, bad, crazy, beautiful misunderstood Danae Eadan who packed enough living into her 28 years to last a dozen lifetimes: the nineties teenager from hell, bombed out on ecstasy by the age of fourteen and an alcoholic at fifteen, the wild woman of the noughties, the pill-popping party girl trollied to the max who set up a cocaine business right under the noses of Carl Williams and the notorious Carlton crew who were too busy murdering each other to notice.

Founding The group was established in 1972 by its commander, Lieutenant- Colonel Peter Brush and his deputy Herbert Heslip, both members of the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP).Abstracts on Organisations - 'D' Claiming to be linked to the Orange Order, the group was said to have 5,000 trained activists, many of whom were serving members of the security forces and former members of the Ulster Special Constabulary, commonly referred to as the \\"B Specials\\".

The weapons had been made in Spa, County Down by the group who were at the time in the process of manufacturing an M1 carbine.

According to Vietnamese Prime Minister Phan VƒÉn Kh·∫£i, \\"The Republic of Korea is a very important partner of Vietnam and a good model for Vietnam to expand cooperation and exchange experiences during its development process.\\"RoK, Viet Nam's important partner, says PM 14-06-2006. Government of Vietnam (mofa.gov.vn) History In ancient time, Korea and Vietnam were within the Sinosphere and share the same Confucian ethical philosophy and model of political governing, culture and social structure. Choe Chiwon (857-?), a Silla Confucian official introduced the geographical and cultural knowledge of northern Vietnam when he wrote on the \\"borders of Jiaozhi\\" and the Protectorate of Annam. Semi-official encounters regularly happened when envoys from both countries met in China for tribute visits. The last remaining survivors of the L√Ω Dynasty had fled to Korea following Tr·∫ßn Th·ªß ƒê·ªô's total massacre of the L√Ω family. One of famous L√Ω survivor was L√Ω Long T∆∞·ªùng, who later helped to defeat the Mongols and halted total Mongol occupation of Korea for many years, even though Korea was eventually forced to become a Mongol vassal. For this efforts, he was revered as one of the most important heroes in the Mongol wars and became a significant part of history forming the historical and mutual bond between Korea and Vietnam that exists for eight centuries and still remains since. Vietnam War The areas of responsibility of the South Korean army in Vietnam as of December 1966 Korean Soldiers in Vietnam. The two Korean states: North and South Korea lent material and manpower support to their respective ideological allies during the Vietnam War, though the number of South Korean troops on the ground was larger. Then- South Korean president Syngman Rhee had offered to send troops to Vietnam as early as 1954, but his proposal was turned down by the U.S. Department of State; the first South Korean personnel to land in Vietnam, 10 years later, were non-combatants: ten Taekwondo instructors, along with thirty-four officers and ninety-six enlisted men of a Korean Army hospital unit. In total, between 1965 and 1973, 312,853 South Korean soldiers fought in Vietnam; Vietnam's Ministry of Culture and Communications estimated they killed 41,400 enemy fighters and 5,000 civilians. But this is not an official investigation. There was no official investigation because of the silence of Korean government, and the Vietnamese government 's concern about the Vietnam massacre of North Vietnamese troops at the time of the Vietnam War.Kim Jin-Tae \\"Vietnam didn't report about the apology of Korean president\\" After the Vietnam war, there were thousands of children of mixed Korean and Vietnamese descent, called Lai Dai Han. They were born between Korean workers or soldiers and Vietnamese, but most of them were the result of the rape of Vietnamese Women, by South Korean soldiers, The scale of these atrocities were reported to have been widespread, with frequent \\"My Lai Massacre-style massacres\\" having taken place. Surviving victims and their supporters are asking for investigation and apology for the Korean civilians' genocide in Vietnam during the Vietnam War, but this has not been accepted yet and civic groups are supporting them.Vietnam-Korea Peace Foundation In 2001, South Korean president Kim Dae-jung expressed his condolences for Korea having inflicted pain on the Vietnamese people during the Vietnam War, although unintentionally. Also, he promised to continue supporting the development of Vietnam.\\"Kim Dae-jung Holds Talks With Vietnam Leader\\" August 24, 2001. People's Daily As stated by Vietnamese president Tr·∫ßn ƒê·ª©c L∆∞∆°ng in 2004: In 2009, South Korea and Vietnam agreed to lift the bilateral relationship to the ‚Äúcomprehensive partnership‚Äù.Vietnam, RoK strengthen strategic partnership 10/19/2009. VOICE OF VIETNAM In 2003, readers of South Korean newspaper Hankyoreh, which ran a series of articles exposing atrocities committed by South Korean troops during the war, donated over US$100,000 to set up a memorial park and peace museum in Ph√∫ Y√™n Province. Former South Korean soldiers such as Ahn Junghyo and Hwang Sok-yong have also written novels about their experiences in Vietnam. In 2017 Moon Jae-in apologised vaguely to Vietnam, although the issue was minimized by the Vietnamese media and South Korean media as it wasn't seen as an official apology., and South Korean civil groups and individuals have also taken a pro- active effort in reconciliation.  North Korea  In the aftermath of the controversial 2006 North Korean nuclear test, Foreign Ministry Spokesman Le Dzung expressed the Vietnamese Government's grave concern over the test, stating that it will heighten tensions and threaten the region's stability, and stated that Vietnam supports the \\"denuclearization\\" of the Korean peninsula. After the ROKS Cheonan sinking of 2010, Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Nguyen Phuong Nga said: \\"The sinking of Cheonan is a regrettable incident. The Government of Vietnam expresses its heart-felt condolences to the Government of the Republic of Korea for the loss of lives in the sinking. Vietnam has attentively and closely been following the current developments in the Korean Peninsula. Vietnam consistently and persistently supports peace, stability in the Korean Peninsula, and favors dialogue for peaceful settlement of all matters. Vietnam wishes that parties concerned could exercise restraint for the sake of peace, stability in the Korean Peninsula and in the region.\\" Trade and investment Banner in Hanoi celebrating the 25 years of diplomatic ties Four years after the 1992 normalisation of diplomatic ties, South Korea was already annually conducting $1.3 billion of trade with Vietnam, making them Vietnam's third-largest trading partner; they were also the fourth-largest foreign investor after Taiwan, Japan, and Hong Kong, having put $1.987 billion into Vietnam. The pace of their investment roughly doubled over the next ten years; in the first five months of 2006, new South Korean investment in Vietnam totalled to around $400 million, and roughly one thousand Korean companies had operations in the country.

Built in 1865 on the Great North Road, it was one of the largest asylums in the Colony. Most of the site of the former asylum is currently occupied by the Unitec Institute of Technology, with smaller sections occupied by the Mason Clinic (a forensic psychiatric clinic also serving as a facility for mentally disturbed prisoners) and various private businesses.  Etymology  \\"Whau\\" is the common name for Entelea, a species of tree endemic to New Zealand; the Whau River is located within the Auckland metropolitan area. History In 1851 the original \\"special asylum\\" for Auckland received public support, and by 1853 Auckland's first asylum was built on the grounds of Auckland HospitalDr P Savage (1967) Centennial of Oakley Hospital Speech However, by 1862 this building was overcrowded and consequently support was sought from the provincial government In September 1863, architectural plans by a Mr. Barrett from England were submitted to the Auckland architect James Wrigley who adapted them. Henry White was the builder. John Thomas of Oakley Creek was awarded a brick contract for the building materials, but being unable to complete the contract, it fell on Dr. Pollen to supply the rest of the bricks. Some of the bricks were produced on-site while others were produced at Dr Pollen's Avondale brickyard. While building was complete in 1867 it stopped at the left wing of the main hospital because 20,000 pounds had been spent and this was thought adequate for the community at the time. Patients were moved from the Auckland Hospital site to the \\"new asylum\\" on 8 March 1867 Dr P Savage (1967) Centennial of Oakley Hospital speech After the building was gutted by an 1877 fire, Philip Herapath supervised the reconstruction. From 1869 to 1879, Dr. Thomas Aickin served as medical superintendent. In 1879, a new wing to the asylum was under construction and stone for it was mined from nearby Oakley Creek. An estimated two-thousand tons of stone was made available in this exercise through detonation of 16 barrels of gunpowder under a 20-foot deep bed of lava, which created a miniature \\"earthquake\\" felt in the surrounding area. In 1891, Dr. T. R. King, Medical Superintendent, resigned because of ill-health, and was succeeded by Dr. Gray Hassell, who had been an administrator at the Wellington Hospital and Wellington Asylum. In December 1900, there were 494 patients‚Äî306 males and 188 females. The staff included 31 males and 21 females. The average net cost per patient was, in 1898, ¬£19 13s, and, in 1899, ¬£20 8s. The average number of patients sent out cured in 1898 was 51%, and in 1899, 38%; average deaths, 1898, 7.5; in 1899, 8.8. The officials of the institution at the time were Dr. Robert Martin Beattie, medical superintendent; Dr. William Webster, assistant medical officer; Edward Newport, head attendant; Sophia Campbell, matron; and J. D. Muir, farm manager. Religious service was held on Sunday by ministers of the denominations of which patients are members. The asylum underwent several name changes. It was known as Auckland Mental Health Hospital in 1959. In the 1960s, the work week averaged 60 hours and staff had only one day off each week. Avondale Mental Asylum became Oakley Hospital, it contained a male forensic unit and general psychiatric wards. The institute's centenary was celebrated in Oakley Hospital in 1967. The Auckland Psychiatric Hospital was officially renamed Oakley Hospital in 1960. In 1972 the nursing staff went out on strike for better conditions, following this the hospital was divided into two, the main hospital became Carrington Hospital and the forensic wards remained named Oakley Hospital In 1964, Dr. G.M. Tothill retired as medical superintendent and Dr P.P.E. Savage was appointed to take his place. In 1971, the building was considered to be one of the best Victorian buildings in Auckland. In keeping with a national change,the Auckland Hospital Board took control of the hospital from the Health Department the following year. Controversial plans were considered for the hospital's M3 Ward to be turned into a medical security prison in 1986. In 1992, Carrington Hospital was closed by the Auckland Area Health Board and was purchased by a tertiary education provider, Carrington Polytec, who refurbished the building, opening the Unitec Institute of Technology School of Architecture and Design in 1994. The original building is now used by Unitec's departments of Architecture, Landscape Architecture, and Design and Contemporary Arts. Architecture and fittings The facade is neoclassical and has polychromatic detailing. Built of brick, it faced the junction of Great North Road and Carrington Road, leading to Mount Albert. In the central portion of the building were the dining halls, kitchen, and store-rooms, and the two adjoining wings were the male and female wards. The male dining hall was also used for theatrical and musical performances. Auxiliary wood buildings were destroyed by fire in December 1894. A new brick building was completed in 1896‚Äì1897. The chapel of St Luke the Physician, built in 1865, was used as a dormitory since 1875, but was renovated and reopened as a chapel in 1961. The Conolly Room at the hospital was named after English doctor, Dr. John Conolly. Grounds A spring on the estate, and a waterfall on Oakley Creek, was ample for domestic and fire prevention purposes. A farm, consisting of nearly , was attached to the asylum, providing for healthful recreation and fresh vegetables. There were approximately 50 milk cows on the estate, and numerous pigs. An unlimited supply of fresh eggs was obtained from the farm's poultry. Part of the land was turned into an experimental sewage farm. The oldest building has several notable trees and shrubs of interest including holm oak, sweetgum, chaste tree, and pigeonberry. now part of the Unitec Arboretum . In 1969, the Auckland University Council decided that the farm was not suitable for university development, but wanted to convert for playing fields while Auckland Technical Institute wanted . The majority of the land has been purchased by the New Zealand government for affordable housing developments, with 3000 to 4000 homes to be built starting in 2019.

Life Geskel Saloman (n√©e Solomon) was the son of merchant Isak Soloman, who later became cantor of the Jewish community in Copenhagen (1782‚Äì1848), and Veilchen Geskel (1787‚Äì1836). He had two brothers: Siegfried Saloman, a well-known violinist and composer, and Nota Salomon (1823‚Äì1885), chief medical officer in the Danish army.Dieter Lohmeier: Saloman, Geskel. in: Biographisches Lexikon f√ºr Schleswig-Holstein und L√ºbeck.

Saloman in his studio. (1901) A short stay in Gothenburg led to him to become a resident in Sweden from 1850, where he received citizenship. In Gothenburg he enjoyed great reputation as a portrait painter, but also did some genre paintings which he partially exhibited in Copenhagen. He was also a character interested in giving drawing lessons, being offered a position as teacher in 1871 at the G√∂teborgs Musei Rit-och M√•larskola, now Konsth√∂gskolan Valand; becoming a member of the Art Academy in Stockholm from 1874. There, he became professor at the academy and the royal portrait painter. After resigning from the academy, he became a highly sought portrait painter in Sweden, but performed ever greater tasks, partly in genre pictures and later in historical compositions, or rather what we call \\"the historical genre\\", preserving even in his old age his freshness in painting. One of his earlier works, En V√¶verske med sit Barn, exhibited in Copenhagen in 1858, was given the honorable mention at the Salon de Paris, where he studied under the guidance of Thomas Couture between the years 1854-1855. From 1860 to 1863 he lived in the city of Algiers. Another older picture, news from the News from the Crimean War (1855), belongs to the Museum in Gothenburg, while A Young Girl With A Letter (1872) belongs to the National Museum in Stockholm. In decorative terms a very powerful image, though not weighty enough for content prize, The Home-Coming of the Victor (1881), was bestowed upon King Oscar II of Sweden for his silver wedding anniversary. His latest work is the Gustav Vasa and Dalkarlene (1886) and Marsk Stigs Daughters (1893), which belongs to the National Museum in Stockholm, and finally Ahasuerus and the Angel of Death, exhibited 1896.

Different countries participate in this event every year. In 2013, Canada, Japan, France and South Korea worked together. This event was held in 2000 first. It starts at Hangang Park in the evening in October.http://www.wikitree.co.kr/main/news_view.php?id=141432http://www.cnbnews.com/news/article.html?no=215717 However, festival was cancelled on 2001, 2006, and 2009. From many countries, there are diverse kinds of fireworks in South Korea. After the festival, it holds a commemorative photo exhibition in the observatory of the 63 building through a fireworks picture contest exhibit.  Introduction  About 100,000 fireworks went off, and more than a million of viewers visited every year. Seoul International Fireworks Festival is the typical festival in Korea. There are about 20,000 visitors at main event hall at Yeoido. Moreover, there are about 100,000 visitors near Wonhyo Bridge, Hangang Bridge, Hangang Park Ichon Area and more places. In total, about 120,000 visitors enjoyed the festival. Generally, each team who participated in Seoul international fireworks festival costs about 200 million won. Including the incidental expense, group Hanhwa spent about more than 1.5 billion won.  Attraction  The main event hall that located in front of the 63 Building is the best place for enjoying the festival. You also can enjoy the sound tracks. However, it will be extremely crowded. Besides, Hangang Park Ichon Area which is located northern extremity end of Hangang and Nodeul Island which is located at the central Hangang Bridge are chosen for great view. However, it is impossible to listen with the sound tracks which is from the main event hall. It is recommended only for taking pictures or avoiding extremely crowded. If you want to avoid crowded or you are with lovers or family, you can get the official tickets from the fireworks event which is proceeding from Hanhwa.  Location  The closest subway station is line 5 Yeouinaru Station. However, the station will be extremely crowded. Therefore, visitors recommended for get off at line 5 Yeouido Station, line 9 Saetgang Station, or line 1 Daebang Station and walk. If visitors want to enjoy the Seoul international fireworks festival at Hangang Park Ichon Area, it is better to get off at line 1 Yongsan Station, line 4 Sinyongsan Station, or Ichon Station. Many visitors enjoy the festival at the opposite side of the main event hall, the Hangang Park Ichon Area. The festival will be crowded with people before it start about 3 hours ago, visitors need to go early to choose the best place to sit.  Criticism  Seoul International Fireworks Festival is held from a private institution, Hanhwa, although there are many festivals that are held from the public institution like Busan International Fireworks Festival and Pohang International Lights Festival. In 2005, the then mayor of Seoul, Lee Myung- bak, said \\"It is a really big problem that Seoul City's budget and event progressing are supporting to the event from only a private institution\\" and he did not attend the opening ceremony of the Seoul International Fireworks Festival that are attended by convention. There are many opinions that it should move the event place to another one or abolish the festival because its purpose for the event is corporate communications and it induces traffic jams in the center of a city and trash problem.

Merkorios remained Patriarch for three years until 1991, when the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) overthrew the Communist military junta known as Derg in Addis Ababa. After spending almost three decades living in exile, he was allowed to return to Addis Ababa and be recognized as Patriarch alongside Abune Mathias. Early life Known before his elevation to the episcopacy as Abba (Father) Ze-Libanos Fanta, he was born into the minor nobility of Begemder Province. He was considered something of a liturgical expert, and served for many years at Holy Trinity Cathedral in Addis Ababa. Abba Ze-Libanos was raised to the rank of Bishop by Patriarch Abuna Takla Haymanot in 1976 over his home province of Beghemidir (then known as Gondar Province), taking the name Merkorios. Abune Merkorios served as Archbishop of Gondar until he became Patriarch of Ethiopia in 1988. Abune Merkorios' tenure of Archbishop of Gondar included the period known as the \\"Red Terror\\" in Ethiopia, and which was carried out with particular brutality in the town and province of Gondar under the governorship of Melaku Teferra, a particularly notorious member of the Derg. Abune Merkorios would later face accusations of not only having kept silent during the horrors of the \\"Red Terror\\" in Gondar, but of having a particularly close relationship with Governor Melaku. In a sign of the favor of the Derg regime, in 1986, Abune Merkorios was appointed as one of a very small and select group of clergy to serve as a member of the Shengo, the national parliament set up by the Derg when it proclaimed the People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia that year. He remained a member of the parliament until his enthronement as Patriarch. These allegations of closeness to the Communist Derg regime helped undermine the Patriarch, when the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) came to power. Abdication and exile Abune Merkorios was ousted by EPRDF regime in 1991, particularly on the orders of then Prime Minister Tamrat Layne. He was followed on the throne of the Ethiopian Church by Abune Paulos, the fifth official patriarch of the church, although many Ethiopian churches in the diaspora continued to recognize Abune Merkorios as Patriarch in opposition to Paulos. The following year he fled to Kenya, later relocating to the United States in 1997, where churches had begun to secede from the synod in Ethiopia following the leadership of Abuna Yesehaq. These churches formed and eventually both synods were mutually excommunicated. In 2011, a Wikileaks cable was released in which former Prime Minister Tamirat Layne, during a 5 January 2009 meeting with U.S. ambassador Donald Yamamoto, revealed that \\"he wants to assist in the reconciliation of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church and the Ethiopian Orthodox Church based in America, because he signed the order that removed the original patriarch and bifurcated the church.\\" Alt URL Efforts to heal the threatened schism had shown promising results through late 2011 and early 2012. However, the sudden deaths of both Patriarch Abune Paulos and Prime Minister Meles Zenawi caused efforts to slow down as the synod in Ethiopia went through a leadership transition. During the reconciliation negotiations, the synod in exile insisted that Abune Merkorios be allowed to resume the Patriarchal throne, something that neither the synod in Ethiopia nor the Ethiopian government was willing to consider. With the election of Abune Mathias as the 6th Patriarch of Ethiopia on February 28, 2013, reconciliation talks were ended for the time being. Reinstatement With the encouragement of the newly elected Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, reconciliation talks between the two rival synods began anew, and on July 27, 2018 representatives from both synods reached an agreement. According to the terms of the agreement, Abune Merkorios was reinstated as Patriarch alongside Abune Mathias, who will continue to be responsible for administrative duties, and the two synods were merged into one synod, with any excommunications between them lifted. On August 1, 2018, Abune Merkorios entered Ethiopia for the first time in 26 years, flying together with Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed.

The first L-749 was delivered to Air France on April 18, 1947. Pan American World Airways received its first L-749 in June, and L-749 service began the same month on their \\"Round The World\\" service. The L-749 also entered service with various other airlines, including Trans World Airlines (TWA), KLM, Cubana de Aviaci√≥n, L√≠nea Aeropostal Venezolana and Avianca. In March 1947, 1,200 jobs were lost at Lockheed, bringing production of the aircraft to a near stand- still. This was due to the end of military production from World War II bringing a reduction in the number of needed workers. A large order from the United States Air Force for 10 L-749As, designated C-121 Constellation, saved the Constellation program from cancellation. The United States Navy followed in, ordering two L-749As as PO-1Ws (later WV-1s). The first L-749A off the production lines were destined for the military. The Aviadrome's C-121A Constellation in the colors of a KLM L-749. Lockheed started producing the improved L-749A in 1949. It had a strengthened fuselage, further strengthened landing gear and a Plycor floor. This increased weight by over and increased the MTOW. Slightly redesigned engine cowlings and new Curtiss Electric propellers were also introduced. Lockheed also offered a L-749 to L-749A conversion kit. The first civil customer for the L-749A was South African Airways but its largest customer was TWA, which had 26 L-749As; the last of these were not retired until 1967. A cargo version of the L-749A based on the military C-121A was offered, but no airlines showed interest and it never left the drawing board. An L-749B turboprop version was envisaged, but this too never left the drawing board as no reliable engine was found.

The film is Hickmet Avedis' grindhouse homage to 1967's The Graduate. The film stars Angel Tompkins, Jay North, and Anthony James, and tells the story of an 18-year-old's first relationship with his alluring teacher, and the hidden danger awaiting them in the shadows. Synopsis It is summer, and obsessed Ralf Gordon (Anthony James) stalks a high-school teacher, 28-year-old Diane Marshall (Angel Tompkins). He watches her from an old warehouse while she is relaxing in her swimsuit on one of the boats. One of Diane's students, 18-year-old Sean Roberts (Jay North) and Ralf's younger brother Lou (Rudy Herrera, Jr.), also watch her strip naked and exercise. An angry Ralf yells at them, brandishing a bayonet. Shocked at this, Lou falls over the railing to his death, for which Ralf falsely blames Sean. Later that night, Ralf confronts Sean again, threatening to cut the boy's tongue out should he reveal anything. The sheriff questions Sean, who lies due to seeing Ralf eyeing him. The next day, Sean meets with Diane, who invites him to have tea. Diane reveals that she knows about Ralf stalking her. On their way home, Sean and she see Ralf watching them. Diane invites Sean into her house for a drink. This soon escalates into a moment of passionate lovemaking while Ralf, unknown to them, watches jealously. Diane invites Sean to her boat the next day. Ralf arrives and threatens Sean with a handheld harpoon. However, upon seeing Diane, he flees. Diane later asks Sean to dinner, after which Ralf again threatens him with the bayonet. Diane then tells Sean's parents about Ralf's threats. The next day, Sean drives Diane home and they have a pool party together, then make love. Diane receives a phone call from her drifter husband telling her that he is coming back, but Diane tells him she is divorcing him. As Sean gets into his van to drive home, he is held at bayonet point by Ralf and ordered to drive to the warehouse. Sean manages to get away and arms himself with a rifle, but Ralf reveals that the gun is loaded with blanks. Ralf gets him in a chokehold, which ends up killing him. Diane arrives on the scene, where Ralf tells her that he killed Sean so he can be with her. A horrified Diane pleads tearfully with him. Ralf, overcome with anger and jealousy at Diane's love for Sean over himself, tries to strangle her. Diane manages to stab him with his own bayonet and flees crying, leaving Ralf to bleed to death. Diane finds Sean's body, breaks down and weeps. Cast *Angel Tompkins ... Diane Marshall *Jay North ... Sean Roberts *Anthony James ... Ralph Gordon *Marlene Schmidt ...

[...] > Avedis displays much concern for his people and allows Miss Tompkins and > North plenty of room to give fresh, spontaneous performances.

After a nationwide manhunt, his wife, Elisa McNabney, was captured in Florida and arraigned for first-degree murder. The case made national headlines when police learned that her real name was actually Laren Sims, and that she had served time in a Florida prison for fraud and identity theft. Before Elisa could stand trial however, she hanged herself in her jail cell. Elisa's friend Sarah Dutra was later convicted of voluntary manslaughter and sentenced to 11 years in prison for murdering Larry McNabney. Elisa McNabney (January 20, 1966 - March 31, 2002) was born Laren Renee Sims to parents Jesse and Jackie Sims in Attleboro, Massachusetts, before moving to Florida. Laren was a cheerleader and excellent student at Hernando High School; she had an IQ of 140. Despite her intelligence, she dropped out of high school, had two children with two different fathers, and started stealing. Laren was arrested for stealing a L'Oreal hair color kit from a Woolworth's in Tampa, Florida. After being released on that charge, she violated her probation by illegally using a credit card. She cut off her ankle monitor and headed to Las Vegas, Nevada with her daughter Haylei (born January 29, 1985). Aliases Over the years, Laren Sims had a total of 38 aliases, including: *Melissa Godwin *Tammy Keelin *Elizabeth Barasch ‚Äì a woman she met in Florida prison *Elisa Redelsperger ‚Äì the name she used when she met Larry McNabney *Shane Ivaroni ‚Äì the name she used while she was on the run Marriage to Larry McNabney Elisa Redelsperger met Larry McNabney in 1995 when she applied for a job at his Las Vegas law office. She worked as his office manager and settled large cases. However, in late 1995, Larry's law firm was investigated by the Nevada State Bar, which determined that Elisa embezzled more than $140,000 from clients. Larry closed his offices in Reno and Las Vegas in Nevada and moved his practice to Sacramento, California. Despite this, Elisa became McNabney's fifth wife in 1996. Murder On September 10, 2001, following a horse show, Elisa McNabney and her fellow employee and friend Sarah Dutra, with whom she worked at the law office, injected Larry with the horse tranquilizer drug acepromazine at a Los Angeles hotel. McNabney, 53, was last seen alive being pushed in a wheelchair by Sims at a Los Angeles horse show September 10. A day later, authorities said, Elisa (or Sims) started clearing out his office and sold his $110,000 horse trailer and truck. According to her later confession, Elisa drove to Yosemite National Park to bury Larry, but he was still alive and she returned with the unconscious Larry McNabney in the back seat to Sacramento. After his death the next day, September 12, from receiving the initial tranquilizer injection along with numerous later doses of other tranquilizer injections and mouth drops, it was estimated by the forensic examiners that Elisa and Sarah presumably had kept McNabney's body in the refrigerator in the McNabney garage for months. His body was later moved to the nearby winery near where it was finally discovered by San Joaquin County Sheriffs Office detectives in a shallow ditch near Linden, California on February 5, 2002. By that time however, Elisa had liquidated the couple's assets, totaling more than $500,000, and disappeared. Manhunt After the discovery of Larry's body, Elisa was the subject of a nationwide manhunt. She was going by the alias Shane Ivaroni and was hiding out in Destin, Florida. On March 20, 2002, Elisa was staying at her daughter Haylei's friend's house in Fort Walton Beach when she turned herself in. Confession She was booked into the Hernando County Jail and was to be extradited to California. While awaiting extradition, Elisa gave a full confession to law enforcement while in custody at the Okaloosa County, Florida Sheriff's Department. One week later, on Easter Sunday 2002, Elisa hanged herself in her jail cell. Trial of Sarah Dutra Sarah Dutra went on trial for the murder of Larry McNabney in 2003. She faced life imprisonment without parole if convicted of first-degree murder, but she was instead found guilty of voluntary manslaughter and being an accessory to murder.http://www.lodinews.com/article_4228e805-babd-5dfc-84c7-26cf1b647a36.html She was sentenced to the maximum of 11 years, 8 months in prison. Aftermath In Elisa McNabney's suicide note, she asked her lawyer to sue the Hernando County Jail for not preventing her suicide. She also asked that her children receive any funds raised from the lawsuit. \\"This is all I can give to my children... My actions now will allow them to move into the future without this heavy burden. They won't have to watch my trial on Court TV. It should all die with me,\\" she wrote in the note. She also claims that she was not checked regularly in her cell, but an investigation has since disputed the charge. Sarah Dutra was released from the Central California Women's Facility on August 26, 2011, after serving eighty-five percent of her eleven-year sentence. This case was the basis for the made-for-TV movie Lies My Mother Told Me which aired on Lifetime in 2005. The film starred Joely Richardson as Elisa, Kailin See as Sarah, and Hayden Panettiere as Haylei. The case was featured on the television programs Dateline, Evil Stepmothers, Deadly Wives, and Snapped. The case is also the basis for the true-crime novel, Marked for Death by Brian J. Karem.

Her name means \\"Much-unique-cleansing-the- splash\\" in the Tahitian language. Life =Family= Marau at fifteen years old, around the time she married. She was born in 1860 to Alexander Salmon (Solomon), an English Jewish merchant, and Princess Oehau, later given the title ari ªi Taima ªi, their third daughter and seventh child. Her mother was the adoptive daughter of King P≈çmare II's widow, the mother of P≈çmare III and P≈çmare IV. Considered one of the highest ranking chieftainesses in the land, she was head of the Teva clan, the traditional rivals of the P≈çmare family, and descended from Chief Amo and Queen Purea who received the first European explorer to Tahiti Samuel Wallis in 1767. In 1846, Ariitamai was considered a rival candidate to the throne by the French governor Armand Joseph Bruat in the event that Queen P≈çmare IV did not return from her self-imposed exile to Raiatea and comply with a French protectorate over Tahiti. Her parents had ten children. Marau's siblings were: brothers Tepau, Tati, Ariipaea, and Narii; and sisters Titaua, Moetia, Beretania, and Manihinihi; see family tree. Her family were considered royalty by Tahitians. Marau's relation with her siblings shattered in the aftermath of their mother's death which culminated in a seven-year-long feud and lawsuit battle over their mother's lands and possessions. She was able to reconcile with her siblings and drop the lawsuits in 1904. She and her sister Moetia survived all their siblings and died only months apart. =Education= Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh in Tahiti with Titaua Brander resting on his knee The Salmon children, and their relatives from the Brander family, attended schools in Europe or Australia. From the late 1860s, Marau was educated in Sydney, Australia. She attended a private school, Young Ladies‚Äô College, operated by Miss Fallow in the city until she went home to Tahiti to marry. Her brother Narii and nephews John and Alexander Brander, who were the sons of her older sister Titaua, had preceded her to Sydney and commenced at Newington College in 1867.Newington College Register of Past Students 1863‚Äì1998 (Syd, 1999) The boys had arrived by ship in Sydney on 29 October of that year with two native servants. Marau arrived in Sydney sometime after that as it is reported that she attended the picnic on 12 March 1868 at Clontarf where Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, was wounded in the back by a revolver fired by Henry James O'Farrell. The Duke visited Tahiti in 1870 and met Marau's sister, Titaua Brander. =Marriage= On January 28, 1875, she married Crown Prince Ariiaue, the future King P≈çmare V, at Papeete. She was only fourteen years old, and he was many years her senior and had been married and divorced before to Teuhe, who later became Queen of Huahine in her own right. The marriage was an unhappy arrangement and the couple constantly fought. Her mother-in-law, P≈çmare IV (1813‚Äì1877) died after a long reign on 17 September 1877, and Marau and Ariiaue separated, but the French Admiral Paul Serre persuaded them to make peace. They were crowned King and Queen of Tahiti on 24 September 1877 with the approval of the Legislative Assembly of Tahiti and the French, and her husband took the name of P≈çmare V. They had three children, but it was agree that her husband's niece Princess Teriivaetua (daughter of his second brother Tamatoa V of Raiatea); and his nephew Prince Hinoi (son of his fourth brother Prince Joinville) would be ahead of any children of Queen Marau in order to secure a pure-Tahitian heir to the throne, which is strange considering the fact that Prince Hinoi's mother was half- English.

Her fashion style was admired and copied by many Parisian society women. After Paris, it seems she toured other parts of France and possibly Europe before returning to Tahiti. On her voyage home, she fell in love with a French naval officer by whom she had her two younger children. The marriage ended in divorce on July 27, 1887; the king repudiated her two younger children, and in retaliation, the queen denied his paternity of all three. In later life she became acquainted with American writer Henry Adams who wrote a biography of her mother and herself. Among her other friends were Paul Gauguin, Pierre Loti, Somerset Maugham, Rupert Brooke, Robert Keable, Alain Gerbault. and Robert Louis Stevenson.

In that year the enrollment was 360 students, significantly increasing every year, so there were other buildings to get more space than the original next to the former Casino de Mayag√ºez, at that time Mendez Vigo Street. In 1906 Sister Mary Padden had organized at the Academy the forerunner of school canteens in Puerto Rico but only taught primary grades. In 1908 he opened a two-year business course and developing the Academy continued until 1918 when the building was completely destroyed by an earthquake. In September 1921 he was re-opened in a temporary wooden structure. In 1922 he began a full high school course of four years. In 1926 the Academy was accredited by the Education Commission of Puerto Rico. In 1957 he inaugurated the new building on Calle de Diego. During the 1960s, the Immaculate Conception Academy had an enrollment of 1,300 students, 400 of them at the top, and a faculty that consisted of 14 sisters (Sisters), 32 teachers, a principal, and a school principal. In 1966 it officially adopted the Knight (Knight) as the emblem and the blue and white colors represent the Academy. In 1968 the Director-Pastor began construction of the new building, and immediately Sister Zoe, the Principal, worked hard for the Accreditation of MSA for the AIC In March 1969 the Visiting Committee of the Middle States Association came to the Academy and finally it was accredited. The first graduating class in this building was the Cowboys in 1969 class. In the early 1970s, he built the gymnasium physical education. In 1975 it was the departure of the Sisters in the United States after 70 years working for the AIC. This caused great sorrow at the Academy and for the whole community. The high school celebrated 50 years of service, while the 75th anniversary of the Redemptorist Fathers. In 1986, the Director-Pastor Andrew Spacht, C.Ss.R., construction began on the annex building would place seventh and eighth grades. In 1987 he also initiated improvements in physical facilities for sports. In January 1994 the Director Rev. Fr.

Career William R. Sears was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the son of William and Gertrude Sears.Obituaries William R. Sears Retrieved 6 September 2011. He earned his BS degree from the University of Minnesota in 1934. Following this, he enrolled at Caltech to study under Theodore von K√°rm√°n, director of the Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory (GALCIT). There he met von K√°rm√°n's secretary, Mabel Rhodes and they were soon married. Sears was awarded his PhD in 1938, writing a thesis concerning airfoils in non-steady motion, a work that laid the foundations for future developments in that field.Sears, William Rees, Stories From a 20th- Century Life, Parabolic Press, Stanford California, 1994. In 1937, Sears was appointed instructor in aeronautics at Caltech, and in 1940, he was promoted to assistant professor. Several of his colleagues in these years included Qian Xuesen and Frank Malina. Through von K√°rm√°n's friendship with Jack Northrop, Sears became involved in consulting on aerodynamic problems at Northrop Aircraft In 1941, Sears accepted Jack Northrop's offer to be chief of aerodynamics and flight testing. When Sears was a junior faculty member at Caltech, he was asked to direct the Civilian Pilot Training Program, a federal program that offered young people the possibility of earning a private pilot's license and receiving preparation for possible military flying in the event that the United States entered the war. Sears not only administered the program but took the opportunity to get his own pilot's license. At Northrop, Sears headed the team that designed the Northrop N-1M, which later led to the Northrop N9M, Northrop XB-35 and Northrop YB-49 flying wing aircraft.Sears, William R., \\"Flying-Wing Airplanes: The XB-35/YB-49 Program\\", AIAA paper 80-3036, presented at the AIAA Evolution of Aircraft Wing Design Symposium, Dayton Ohio, March 1980. He also led the team that developed the Northrop P-61 Black Widow. At the end of World War II, he accompanied group of aeronautical experts led by Von K√°rm√°n to Germany to investigate the German progress in aerodynamics research. Sears chose to return to academic life in 1946. He joined the faculty of Cornell University as the founder and first director of its Graduate School of Aeronautical Engineering. Within a few years, the Cornell Graduate School of Aeronautical Engineering was ranked among the world's best. He and his many students pioneered research in wing theory, unsteady flow, magnetohydrodynamics, and designed a sophisticated wind tunnel design to study transonic flight. He remained very close to von K√°rm√°n, who was a frequent visitor to the Cornell aero school. In 1962, Sears was named the J. L. Given Professor of Engineering, and in 1963, he stepped down as director of the aero school after 17 years. A year earlier he had founded and became director of Cornell's Center of Applied Mathematics. Although his work at Northrop offered him little opportunity to fly, his move to Cornell provided more opportunity. In more than 50 years as a private pilot, he logged 8,000 hours before retiring from flying in 1990. He owned several aircraft over the years, including a Mooney M-18 Mite, a Beech A35 Bonanza, a Piper Comanche and finally a Piper Twin Comanche. In 1974, after 28 years at Cornell, Sears joined the faculty of the department of aerospace and mechanical engineering at the University of Arizona. Four years later, he was named emeritus professor but remained an active faculty member and completed much of his important analytical and experimental work on adaptive-wall wind tunnels during these years. Honors and awards Sears was a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and Mexico's Academia Nacional de Ingenier√≠a. He was an honorary fellow of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics and was editor of the Journal of the Aeronautical Sciences from 1955 to 1963. During his lifetime, he received many honors and awards, including the Guggenheim Medal and in 1974 the Ludwig-Prandtl-Ring from the Deutsche Gesellschaft f√ºr Luft- und Raumfahrt (German Society for Aeronautics and Astronautics) for \\"outstanding contribution in the field of aerospace engineering.\\" In 1988, Caltech gave him its Distinguished Alumni Award. He was also named an outstanding alumnus of the University of Minnesota and was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Arizona. Sears was also an accomplished musician, first as a percussionist. He worked his way through college as a drummer in dance bands and, after moving to California, was tympanist with the Pasadena Symphony for several seasons. Later, at Cornell, he became an expert recorder player with a university group interested in medieval music. He played with the Collegium Musicum at the University of Arizona for 20 years.

With the money won in the race, the boys bought the equipment necessary to play football: balls, jerseys, shorts, socks and shoes and they renamed the club as a tribute to that horse, so \\"Club Atl√©tico Porte√±o\\" was the name chosen. =The football years (1907-31)= The football team debuted in the top division, Primera Divisi√≥n, in 1907,Argentina 1907 at RSSSF where it played until 1928 when the club was relegated to Segunda Divisi√≥n.Argentina 1928 at RSSSF The first Porte√±o stadium was located on Alvear (current Del Libertador) avenue and Godoy Cruz in Palermo. Nevertheless, the National Government expropriated the land to built the \\"Industrial Pavillion\\" there, as part of the celebrations of the 100th. anniversary of the May Revolution in 1910. Porte√±o moved to a land on Valent√≠n Alsina avenue, near Hip√≥dromo Argentino, also in Palermo. Its stadium was the first (in the city of Buenos Aires) to have its official stands built in concrete. In 1931 Porte√±o disaffiliated from the Football Association, due to the club refused to participate in a professional league, being the team subsequently disbanded. Porte√±o's football team won a total of 2 championships between 1912 and 1914 Argentina amateur football final tables 1911-20 and two Copa de Competencia Jockey Club, in 1915 Copa de Competencia 1915 at RSSSF.com and 1918.Historia del F√∫tbol Amateur en la Argentina, Jorge Iwanczuk, Buenos Aires, 1992Copa de Competencia 1918 at RSSSF.com =The rise of rugby= Although the football team was disbanded, Porte√±o kept other sports active, such as rugby union, which is currently practised at the club facilities located in San Vicente. The reason why Porte√±o went off football was that the club wanted to keep as amateur, and rugby union is not a professional sport in Argentina. Porte√±o affiliated to Uni√≥n de Rugby del R√≠o de la Plata in 1932. The team debuted that season in the third division, finishing 6th. In 1935 Porte√±o promoted to the second division and in 1939 the team won the first division championship organized by the Federaci√≥n Cat√≥lica Argentina de Rugby. In 1944 the Government of the City of Buenos Aires notified Porte√±o it had to leave its lands in Palermo, which were finally expropriated in 1945. In 1951 Porte√±o won the long-awaited promotion to Primera Divisi√≥n, but the team remained there just one season so the following year was relegated after losing its match at the hands of Estudiantes de Paran√°. After playing in different fields, the club finally could acquire a land located in Magallanes and Pardo streets of San Vicente in 1971. Porte√±o still has its facilities there. The same year the club formed its first women's field hockey team, which has been developing as years went by. Colors While the football team colors were blue and white in vertical stripes, it is said that rugby jersey adopted its colors in the 1930s, when a group of players of Sportive Francaise joined Porte√±o to play for the club. Club Porte√±o members, in recognition of this gesture, designed the shirt combining the light blue color from the flag of Argentina, and the french blue from France's. {   } Notable players * Juan Jos√© Rithner (1907‚Äì19), also goalkeeper of Argentina.

The ASRC, based in Footscray, provides aid, justice and empowerment programs to over 1000 asylum seekers living in the community seeking refugee protection. The ASRC is run by a team of volunteer and paid staff. Soon after the centre was opened in 2001, the attention brought to asylum seekers issues by the Tampa affair in August of that year ‚Äì when the Australian Government, under Prime Minister John Howard, refused to grant the Norwegian freighter MV Tampa, which had rescued 438 Afghan asylum seekers, permission to enter Australian waters ‚Äì led to a greater interest in the centre and more volunteers signing up. Mission The mission of the ASRC is to ensure that 'all those seeking asylum in Australia have their human rights upheld and that those seeking asylum in our community receive the support and opportunities they need to live independently.' Their core values are to 'assist all asylum seekers regardless of race, religion, gender, health or sexuality'. The ASRC says it does not means or merit test for access to its services. Rather, they 'advocate for asylum seekers without fear or favour', working both at the personal and legislative level. They are focused on both empowering asylum seekers towards self-determination, as well as educating the community about asylum seekers. The founder and current CEO of the ASRC, Kon Karapanagiotidis, is known for his provocative ways of bringing attention to asylum seeker issues, performing at the 2011 Melbourne International Comedy Festival, as well as elsewhere, as the Hateful Humanitarian. History The ASRC was founded in 2001 by Kon Karapanagiotidis, a lawyer, who was at the time a lecturer in welfare studies at the Victoria University of Technology (now Victoria University). At the time there were many asylum seekers living in the community on the Bridging Visa E, a visa generally given to those 'unlawfully' in the community who have to depart before the visa expires, though many are still appealing their case for asylum. Those on a Bridging Visa E are denied access to Medicare or Centrelink and do not have the right to work. Karapanagiotidis and his welfare students raised funds to create a small food bank for asylum seekers, opening on 8 June 2001. A non-profit enterprise, Grasslands Grocery and Information Cafe, provided the ASRC with two rooms free of rent above a disused shop in Footscray, Melbourne. To accommodate the increase in the number of asylum seekers receiving assistance, volunteers and programs, the ASRC has moved a number of times since 2001. One of the first programs to be introduced was the English as a Second Language (ESL) Program, beginning in August 2001. The Australian Government provides up to 510 hours of free English tuition to newly arrived citizens under the Adult Migrant English Program. Due to visa conditions, however, not all asylum seekers were provided these classes. After the Tampa incident in August 2001, an ASRC volunteer information evening in September 2001 had a high attendance. New volunteers included lawyers, doctors, nurses, ESL teachers and social workers. Soon after, Karapanagiotidis, along with volunteer lawyers, began providing free legal services to assist with asylum claims. In early 2002, the ASRC launched a number of new services, such as the first health service for asylum seekers in Victoria as well as counselling and casework services. In that year, the ASRC received funding from the Myer Foundation to employ a full-time coordinator. Over the next few years, the ASRC introduced several new services, including the Employment Program, Social and Recreation Program, the Volunteer Support Program, the Community Meals Program and the Detention Friendship Program. In 2007, the ASRC moved to a larger space in West Melbourne, allowing for further expansion. Again, new services were introduced, including the Small Business and Social Enterprise Program, ASRC Catering, Kidzone, the Asylum Seeker Outreach Children's Playground, the Micro-Credit Scheme, Repatriation and the Post Detention Release Support Program. In 2014, the ASRC moved to a still larger space at 214-218 Nicholson Street, Footscray. Organisational structure The ASRC is made up of '5 pillars': Aid, Justice, Empowerment, Community and Sustainability (referring to the sustainability of the company), which then divide into various programs, of which there are twenty in total. The programs within Aid are: Material Aid, Food Bank, and Community Meals. The programs within Empowerment are: Social & Community Development, Employment, ESL, Home English Tutoring, and Catering. The programs within Justice are: Human Rights Law, Casework, Health, Counselling, Campaigns, Supporting Asylum Seekers at Hearings (SASA). The programs within Community are: Marketing, Philanthropic Engagement, Corporate Partnerships, Volunteer Support, Youth & Student Engagement, and Community Speakers. And the programs within Organisational Sustainability are: Finance, Administration, and Operations. The ASRC constitution sets out the basis for membership of the organisation, procedures for the conduct of meetings and defines the role of the Board. The centre is committed to community management through the involvement of community members on the Board. Advocacy While some of the work conducted by the ASRC is the provision of services to asylum seekers, the ASRC main purpose is to advocate for the rights of asylum seekers and runs several campaigns at any one time. The ASRC has run campaigns on healthcare access for asylum seekers, the perception of asylum seekers (Just Like Us), ending mandatory detention and getting kids out of detention (End Mandatory Detention - get kids out of detention), the Malaysia people swap, and the provision of a safety net for all asylum seekers (Safety Net for All Asylum Seekers). In 2011, the ASRC is focusing on three campaigns in conjunction with partners such as Amnesty International and Save the Children. Social enterprise The ASRC runs ASRC Catering, ASSET Cleaning Link, and ASSET Recruitment Services, which together have the intent of empowering asylum seekers through training and employment. The catering and cleaning services employ and train asylum seekers, whilst the recruitment service works to help asylum seekers enter the Australian workforce. The head chef of ASRC catering, launched in 2005, is Cathy Maguire, previously Executive Chef at Soulmama, St Kilda, Melbourne. She was a panel chef in the first season of Ready Steady Cook, and appeared on Good Morning Australia, as well as The LifeStyle Channel, Channel 31 and ABC Radio. Awards and achievements Since opening in 2001, the centre has been widely recognised for its community and human rights contributions. In 2010 the ASRC was the winner of the Westpac Kookaburra Award for an Outstanding Community Organisation, sponsored by Westpac bank and Our Community. Our Community recognised the ASRC for being a 'hardworking, largely volunteer-based organisation that is working to protect and uphold the human rights, wellbeing and dignity of asylum seekers.' Also in 2010, the ASRC was a finalist in the Melbourne Awards program for Contribution to Community, Community Organisation Division, as 'the largest provider of aid, advocacy and health services for asylum seekers in Australia.' In 2009 the centre was a finalist in the Victorian Premier's Community Volunteering Awards for the Community Volunteering Innovation Award (Metropolitan). In 2003 they were awarded the Australian Human Rights Commission Community Award ‚Äì'chosen due to the breadth and volume of their work and the day-to-day practical assistance provided to asylum seekers. They are a registered charity with no government funding.' The ASRC is also featured on the Myer Foundation's 'Time Will Tell: Showcasing Stories of Good Philanthropy.' On a national level, through campaigning and grassroots action the ASRC has played a role in positive action for refugees, including in the release of 62% of children that were in detention by June 2011, and in the ending of the Temporary Protection Visa (which was since re- introduced in 2014 under the Abbott Government, the end of the 45-day rule (the end of which has led to the right to work for a greater number of asylum seekers) and the closure of the Manus Regional Processing Centre and Nauru detention centre (which were re-opened in 2012 under the Gillard Government. On a state level, the ASRC has been influential in securing Victorian TAFE access for asylum seekers. The ASRC gained access to up to 300 subsidised TAFE places for eligible asylum seekers in Victoria. In 2010, after successful lobbying from the ASRC along with other asylum seeker organisations, Victorian Public Transport concession cards and fares were made available to asylum seekers receiving aid from the ASRC, Hotham Mission or the Red Cross. Victoria is the first state to offer this support. Publications and productions In 2011 the ASRC produced a short play Not Just My Story. Not Just My Story started with a series of dramatic and creative storytelling workshops with 30 asylum seekers and was performed in the 2011 Human Rights Arts and Film Festival. The play was directed by Brunswick Women's Theatre Director Catherine Simmonds in collaboration with Yumi Umiumare, Arnold Zable and Myles Mumford. The ASRC runs a blog, Champions of Change, publishing articles and updates about asylum seeker events. The blog focuses on children in detention, refugee policy, and stories of asylum seekers living in the community and in detention. In 2010, the ASRC published volume 1 of its Essays on Justice series, which included essays by Malcolm Fraser, Julian Burnside QC and Ana Pararajasingham. In October 2010, the ASRC published a welfare paper, Destitute and Uncertain: the reality of seeking asylum in Australia. The purpose of this paper was to 'educate, advocate and work constructively towards better practices and processes regarding the welfare needs to asylum seekers ... The paper outlines a best practice model for responding to the welfare needs of asylum seekers'. The ASRC also published Locked Out: Position Paper on Homelessness of Asylum Seekers Living in the Community. This paper references the UNHCR's 2008 figures, which say that in 2007/08, 97.3% of the 4750 asylum seeker applications submitted in Australia came from people who arrived by plane and now live in the Australian community. The ASRC publication A Case For Justice:Position Paper on the Legal Process of Seeking Asylum in Australia seeks to 'advocate, educate and work constructively towards better practices and processes in the refugee determination system. The numerous case examples are based on the real-life experiences of clients of the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre (ASRC) Legal Program, and reflect the experiences of many asylum seekers.' People =Pamela Curr= In 2010 Pamela Curr (ASRC Campaign Program Coordinator) was one of Who's Who Australian Women and in 2009 was admitted to the Victorian Women's Honour Roll. She trained as a nurse and a midwife before completing a Diploma of Welfare Studies and a Bachelor in Community Development at Victoria University. Pamela was involved with the Fairwear Australia campaign for five and a half years, has worked with the Victorian Peace Network, is a national spokesperson for the Greens for Refugees, and is involved with the Civil Rights Network. According to the ABC Drum, Pamela 'has worked in the past 15 years fighting for the human rights of first outworkers in the clothing industry and then for refugees and asylum seekers.'. Pamela writes articles for the ABC Drum, the Sydney Morning Herald, and Crikey about the detention of asylum seekers. Together with the Baxter detainees, Curr 'found' Cornelia Rau in Baxter Detention Centre. Rua is an Australian Permanent Resident and German Citizen diagnosed with schizophrenia who was detained in Baxter for ten months in 2004-2005. =Patrons and ambassadors= The ASRC patrons are Former High Court Judge, The Honourable Michael Kirby AC CMG; Eva Cox and Julian Burnside AO QC.

Biography My Superhero formed in 1994 and quickly released their debut album entitled SKAteboard Music in 1995 under their own independent label Sick Little Monkey Music. In 1997, the band released their most successful album, Solid State 14, which received positive reviews from such prestigious publications such as The Los Angeles Times and AllMusic, the latter having been quoted as saying \\"[i]t's unusual to find a debut effort from a punk-ska band that sounds this good\\". In 1998, My Superhero re-recorded SKAteboard Music, releasing it on Vegas Records, before signing to Risk Records to re-release Solid State 14, which helped them find success on the national commercial radio charts. The following year, the band worked with producer Thom Wilson to release their third album entitled Station One under Risk Records. They spent the next 2 years touring nationally alongside bands including Reel Big Fish, The Aquabats, The Hippos, Fenix TX and Frenzal Rhomb, as well as touring as part of the 1999 and 2000 Warped Tour. My Superhero received regular exposure on KUCIs pioneering Ska Parade radio show, managing to tie the record held by Long Beach's One Eye Open for the most on-air live performances. In April 2000, the band attracted minor controversy through an article published by the OC Weekly which revealed numerous homophobic comments frontman Brian Gilmore had posted on My Superhero's own eGroups message board, among them his beliefs that gay men were pedophiles and several uses of the word \\"fag\\". When pressed for comment, the band's manager initially stated that \\"the real haters\\" were people who took issue with Gilmore's comments, claiming \\"that's also hatred on their part\\", though later called the event \\"unfortunate\\" and added that Gilmore felt \\"apologetic\\". In 2000, My Superhero attempted to reorganize the band and play as a power pop trio. In 2002, they recruited a fourth member and recorded their final release, the Send Gas EP. The group quietly disbanded after front man Brian Gilmore got married. My Superhero's final performance was at Gilmore's wedding in 2004. =Reunion shows and beyond= On September 17, 2011, the four original members of My Superhero played a reunion show at The Glasshouse in Pomona, California, headlining a concert organized by Tazy Phyllipz and the Ska Parade. A while later on November 5, the band again reunited at The Glasshouse to open for The Aquabats, the first time the two groups have played together since 1998. =Pick It Up- Ska in the 90's= In April of 2018 My Superhero member Mike Berault signed on to Executive Produce the documentary Pick It Up!- Ska in the'90shttp://allageszine.com/film- reviews/379-film-review-pick-it-up-ska-in-the-90s \\"I felt that our story had to be told, The story of all these great bands that came up in the 90's who had each other, and a DIY ethos that lead ultimatley to global success\\".

History A first version of the work was written by March 1953, but it was only after his friend Karlheinz Stockhausen had finished his Studie I in November that Goeyvaerts was able to come to Cologne to realise his work. In the meantime, Goeyvaerts made a revised version of his score, probably in the Autumn, with a much more complex web of proportions over the entire composition that appears to have been influenced by Stockhausen's Studie (; ). Goeyvaerts was given technical assistance by Stockhausen in realising his work . The premiere of Goeyvarts's composition was given on 19 October 1954 on the inaugural concert of works produced in the WDR studio, together with the first performances of six other pieces: Stockhausen's Studie I and Studie II, Herbert Eimert's Glockenspiel and Et√ºde √ºber Tongemische, Paul Gredinger's Formanten I/II, and Henri Pousseur's Seismogramme. Eimert emphatically titled these pieces \\"Die sieben St√ºcke\\" (The Seven Pieces), and long maintained that this was the first concert of electronic music (; ; ). In retrospect, Goeyvaerts was unhappy with Nummer 5 as a finished product, because it demonstrated that absolute certainty lay outside his grasp . Analysis The \\"pure tones\\" of the subtitle refer to sine tones, from which the various sounds used in the piece are compounded. The work is characterised by stillness, possessing a non- dialectical mode of proceeding so that its harmonic proportions need not exclude an equilibrium of elements. A second force is responsible for the piece‚Äôs form: it is exactly symmetrical: not only does each event in the second half of the piece occur according to an axis of symmetry at the exact centre, but each event itself is reversed. It is a perfect example of Goeyvaerts's aesthetics, the perfect example of the imperfection of perfection . All the relations among the parametric values are derived from the arithmetic series of the integers from 1 to 11. This series defines not only the numbers of elements, but also the relations between the values of these elements. Within the individual composite tones this applies not only to the relations between the component tones but also to the relations between the various composite sounds .

(Printed with Billy Miller‚Äôs Circus-show) Plot Annie, left orphaned after the death of her mother, goes to live in an orphanage where she tells her fellow orphans stories of ghosts and goblins. The matron of the orphanage finds Annie's closest relative, the abusive Uncle Thomp. Her uncle who puts her to hard work doing hard labor on his farm, belittling her all the while. Big Dave, a neighbor and tough cow-poke sees this and comes to her aid. Dave becomes her protector. Eventually Annie goes to live with Squire Goode and his large family. There, she entertains the children of the household with her stories, but sees her abusive aunt and uncle as her chief tormentors. She tells stories of how the goblins will take away the children if they are not good. Each story she tells is illustrated. War breaks out and Dave, who Annie adores, enlists. Uncle Thomp, hearing that Dave has been killed in action, takes pleasure in telling Annie the news. Broken-hearted, Annie falls ill and dies in bed, surrounded by family.

The first draft of Little Orphant Annie was written by Gilson Willets and was a more straight forward adaptation of James Whitcomb Riley poem and contained elements of another Riley poem \\"Where Is Mary Alice Smith\\". The script was apparently extensively re-written several times and became more of a loose adaptation of Riley's poem. Some outlines have Annie dying in the end and being reunited in heaven (\\"The Good World\\") with her mother, where she is wedded to Dave. The surviving version of the film (available on DVD) has Annie fall ill, only to recover and learn Thomp's news was only a bad dream.Folders 95 - 98, William Selig Collection, Margaret Herrick Library, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Only two of the stories Annie tells (from the original poem) are illustrated. The story is framed with footage of James Whitcomb Riley acting as a narrator of sorts who tells a story. That footage had been filmed by Selig Polyscope Company for an earlier commissioned work by Inter-state Historical Pictures Corporation for a film about Indiana.The Indiana Centennial, 1916: A Record of the Celebration of the One Hundredth Anniversary of Indiana's Admission to Statehood, Indiana Historical Collections, Volume 5, by the Indiana Historical Bureau and Harlow Lindley, 1919, page 31. The footage of Riley was most likely in early 1916 before Riley's death in July 1916. Principal photography began in early December 1917 in the San Francisco Bay Area and lasted through mid-1918. Little Orphant Annie was one of the last films produced by Selig Polyscope Company. By the end of 1918, shortly before the film's December 1918 release, the company became insolvent and was absorbed by Fox Film Corporation. The film was initially distributed by Pioneer Film Corporation on a state's right basis. In March 1919, distribution rights were sold to World Film Company. Availability A 16mm print of Little Orphant Annie survives and was released to home media; it was initially released on VHS by Facets, and on DVD by Grapevine Video. An extensive restoration took place in 2016, restoring several minutes to the film, sourced from several surviving prints.https://www.hometheaterforum.com/little-orphant-annie-1918-blu-ray- review/ The film remains one of the few early performances of Colleen Moore that survives and is available to the public.
