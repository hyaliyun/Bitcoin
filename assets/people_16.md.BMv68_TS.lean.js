Weber was known as an abstract, avant‚Äêgarde artist active in Chicago, Paris and New York City between the 1940s‚Äì1971. He worked mainly in painting but was also known to work in bronze for sculpture.  Biography  Weber was born in Basel, Switzerland in 4 May 1918. He studied painting at the University of Basel, studying with artist . He moved to Paris, France by 1939 and was studying art with sculptor Marcel Gimond. Through this relationship with Gimond, Weber met with Aristide Maillol, Hans Arp, and Alberto Giacometti, artists he later worked with as an artist assistant. In 1949, he moved to Chicago, Illinois to work as a teacher of the first year foundation studies at IIT Institute of Design, replacing Laszlo Moholy‚ÄêNagy. Weber's students include artist June Leaf. He worked collaboratively with Emerson Woelffer from IIT, in designing the Chicago-based Jazz Ltd. building's avant- garde room. From 1955 until 1960, Weber lived in Paris, then moved to New York City. In New York, he befriended many of the second generation New York Abstract Expressionist artists, and he grew interest in beat poetry and writing. Weber was a gestural artist, but he was not rooted from American Action Painting like many of the others of the New York School of American Abstract Expressionism but rather from the European \\"style informel\\". He created two films highlighting his process as an artist, Vision in Flux (1951), and Process Documentation by the Painter (1954). In February and March of 1964, Weber created lithographs at Tamarind Institute with master printer Irwin Hollander. He died 15 August 1971 at the age 53, in New York City after a short illness. His work is in various public art collections including Smithsonian American Art Museum, National Gallery of Art, Art Institute of Chicago, and others.

Woolley's interest in scientific inquiry was prompted by the work of her father, Paul Thompson, who was an inventor. Woolley's academic achievement and resultant scholarship allowed her to pursue studies in psychology at the University of Chicago. Woolley's studies at the University of Chicago marked the beginning of her career in experimental and applied psychology. Her controversial dissertation, titled The Psychological Norms in Men and Women, attracted the interest as well as scrutiny of the scientific world as it was the first major piece of psychological research explicitly examining the similarities and differences of the mental traits of women and men. Woolley's husband, Paul Woolley, was a determining force in the course of her career, as the constant relocations required by his profession as a physician limited hers academic opportunities. Following their wedding, Woolley followed Paul to Japan and subsequently the Philippines, where she started working as a researcher for the Bureau of Education, marking her first endeavour in developmental psychology. Woolley's work in education continued with her involvement in the Vocation Bureau, the Merrill-Palmer School and the Institute for Child Welfare Research at Teachers College, Columbia University. Woolley's late life was plagued by her deteriorating mental health, which impacted her interpersonal relationships as well as occupational status. At the age of 73, she died of an aortic aneurysm in her daughter's home in Harvertown Pennsylvania.  Personal life  = Family = Helen Bradford Thompson was born on November 6, 1874 in Englewood, Chicago. As the middle child of three siblings, she and her sisters were raised in a middle-class Chicago suburb. The eldest sister, Jane, attended the University of Michigan for one year but left school due to the financial burden. Lilian, the youngest sister, attended Cook County Normal School and went on to become a teacher. Their mother, Isabella Perkins Faxon was an active missionary during a time when women were expected to confine their interests to family and household activities. Woolley's father, Paul Thompson (though his name is disputed in several articles) was a partner in a shoe manufacturing business and an inventor, producing implements such as burglar alarms, a heat regulating thermostat for a coal furnace, and a letter sorting device for the post office. Her father's work was more appealing to Woolley compared to that of her mother, sparking an interest in scientific endeavours. = Socioeconomic status = As a single-income, middle-class family, Woolley's family presumably struggled with some financial constraints. The eldest daughter, Jane, was able to attend the University of Michigan for one year however, she had to withdraw due to the family‚Äôs inability to carry the financial burden of tuition payment. However, Woolley won a scholarship to the University of Chicago as a result of her high average upon graduating from Englewood High School in 1893. Woolley's family would have been affected by The Panic of 1893, a serious economic depression in the US that started in 1893‚Äì1897. The scholarship she received allowed her to attend university with only expenses of books and travel fare. Without the scholarship, Woolley's education and career might have met the same fate as her older sister Jane. = Relationship and Travels = Woolley met her husband, Paul Gerhardt Woolley in university when she was a senior and Paul was finishing medical studies at Chicago. Soon after meeting, they were engaged and remained engaged for eight years during which time both completed their professional training. After completing their undergraduate studies, Woolley was offered a graduate fellowship and remained in Chicago while Paul left for residency at Johns Hopkins University. After working in Massachusetts for four years, Woolley left her job and moved to Japan where Paul was working as an epidemiologist. She and Paul were married in Yokohama. Soon thereafter, they moved to the Philippines where Paul directed a laboratory. In the Philippines, Woolley began working for the Bureau of Education, performing research on childhood education and the best years for learning. While Woolley took on this project, Paul took a job in Siam (now called Thailand) doing public health work and manufacturing vaccines for smallpox and anthrax. She joined Paul once her project was done. When Woolley became pregnant, Paul sent her home out of concern for her and the baby‚Äôs health. At six months pregnant, Woolley took a boat to the West Coast, then taking a train back to her parents‚Äô home, arriving barely six weeks before her first daughter, Eleanor Faxon Woolley, was born (August 26, 1907). Eleanor's birth sparked Woolley's interest in child and developmental psychology. University of Cincinnati in 1918 After spending a year in Omaha, Nebraska the family moved to Cincinnati. Paul began teaching at the medical school, while Woolley was a philosophy lecturer at the University of Cincinnati. However, during their years in Cincinnati, Woolley and Paul drifted apart. Paul eventually took on a job in Detroit running a medical testing laboratory, and Woolley left Cincinnati in 1921 to follow Paul to Detroit. In 1924, Paul contracted tuberculosis from the diagnostic laboratory and left for a sanatorium in Pasadena, California. Paul Woolley filed for a divorce from Woolley in 1927 with the plans of marrying Millie Thompson (no relation) and eventually died in 1932. Woolley died of a cerebral hemorrhage at age 72 in Pennsylvania on Christmas Eve of 1947.  Education  Helen Woolley graduated as valedictorian from Englewood High School in 1893, with an average of 97 for the four years study. Her graduation valedictory essay \\"The Advance Towards Individual Freedom by the Aid of Invention\\" reflected her inclination towards scientific contributions in social development. Woolley received scholarship to the University of Chicago with her excellent high school results. During the period from 1890‚Äì1910, women only comprised 2.2% ‚Äì 3.8% in post-secondary institutions. Woolley and her two sisters earning university degrees signify the importance of education in the family. Woolley was offered scholarship in both physics and psychology at University of Chicago, and accepted the psychology scholarship. Upon completion of her undergraduate degree in 1897, Woolley was granted a fellowship for graduate work in psychology with James R. Angell, John Dewey, George Herbert Mead, and Henry H. Donaldson under the department of philosophy. Woolley published papers in psychology, philosophy, and neurology. Woolley received her PhD from the University of Chicago in 1900, with the highest distinction. John B. Watson graduated from the University of Chicago as well with similar course of study, but his performance was regarded as much inferior to Woolley. Women who completed PhDs in 20th century were proportionate to men in receiving acceptance into professional organizations such as APA, yet their occupational status was incomparable. Women‚Äôs contributions in academics were significantly under-represented, and academic positions were difficult to be obtained, especially for married women. Upon completion of her PhD, Woolley was recognized by the Association of Collegiate Alumnae and was awarded a European Fellowship. She studied with Carl Stumpf and Arthur Konig in Berlin, and later with Eduard Tulouse and Pierre Janet in Sorbonne.  Dissertation: Psychological Norms in Men and Women  Under the direction of James R. Angell, Woolley‚Äôs doctoral dissertation investigated the performance of 25 males and 25 female university students on \\"motor ability, skin and muscle senses, taste and smell, hearing, vision, intellectual faculties and affective processes\\". The thesis was titled \\"Psychological Norms in Men and Women\\". Her thesis has attracted much attention as it significantly challenged the societal standards of the time. It was the first major scientific experimental research comparing the mental traits of men and women. Woolley adopted the approach of comparing distributions of scores on each test between sexes instead of reporting average performance of all participants. The results supported that men presented higher average performance on motor skills tests, whereas women were better at finer sensory discrimination; women were more skilled in memory and association tasks within intellectual faculties, whereas men had advantage in tests of ingenuity. Woolley accounted the differences between sexes as the characteristics which were most beneficial evolutionarily for sexual reproduction. Helen Woolley later published her dissertation in The Mental Traits of Sex, where her work was criticized for whether women in her sample were an accurate representation of the sex in general. One criticism was that college women and college men were not comparable because college women are usually of the highest intelligence in their respective families and/or driven by especially strong ambition, while college men follow a generally ordinary trajectory. This was the stereotypical view of educated women during the early 20th century. However, a new class of university educated women began to enter the realms of science and social science and enthusiastically applied their expertise on social and political issues of that time.  Career  = The Vocation Bureau (1911-1921) = Helen Woolley was a pioneer in the practical application of developmental psychological principles. As director of the Cincinnati Vocation Bureau, appointed in 1911, she contributed significantly to the understanding of influential factors in the physical and mental development of adolescents. The Vocation Bureau was responsible for the issuance of \\"working certificates\\" to children between the ages of 14 and 16 years and therefore provided a wide pool of data for Woolley to successfully conduct her research. Woolley aimed to establish intelligence tests appropriate for adolescents and the statistical norms to accompany such tests, as well as examine the potential relationship between test and job performance. Woolley compared the performance of 14-year-old subjects who had joined the workforce to subjects regularly attending school classes for the span of four years. After completing an extensive data analysis with her assistant, Charlotte Fischer, Woolley did not find support for her cognitive tests; however, her project increased awareness of the utility of experimental psychology in the advancement of the public-school sector and educational policies. The results of the study were subsequently published in 1926 under the name ‚ÄúAn Experimental Study of Children at Work and in School Between the Ages of Fourteen and Eighteen Years‚Äù. The Vocation Bureau was expanded to include the testing of children in order to establish class placements. She was additionally the first woman and first psychologist to be appointed president of the National Vocational Guidance Association in 1921. = The Merrill-Palmer School (1921-1925) = In an attempt to follow her husband to Michigan, Helen Woolley accepted a position as a psychologist and assistant director at the Merrill-Palmer School in 1921. The Merrill-Palmer School was a nursery school offering courses in child care. The school also represented research initiatives in early child development and attracted a great deal of attention as one of the first laboratory nursery schools in the United States. Woolley's experimental work within the school was limited, however it facilitated a change in her research interests to younger populations of children. Moreover, she expressed concerns with the validity of cognitive testing in young children and emphasized the importance of environmental factors in the development of IQ in such ages. = Teachers College (1925-1930) = Teachers College, Columbia University in 2013 In May 1925, Helen Woolley received an offer to become a director for the Institute for Child Welfare Research at Teachers College, Columbia University. Woolley became the only woman at the time to become a director of one of the most prestigious research centers. In an attempt to smooth the transition between her position at the Merrill-Palmer School and her new position at Teachers College, Woolley travelled between Detroit and New York from January to June, 1926. By April, 1926, Woolley started receiving criticism from friends and coworkers regarding her work ethics. The director of the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial, Lawrence K. Frank, had interviewed the Dean of Teachers College, James Russell, and reflected on it in a memorandum: In late May, it was discovered that Woolley had developed an abdominal tumour for which she had to undergo an appendectomy and hysterectomy. During her treatment, Teachers College was kindly supporting Woolley by continuing her salary and paying her medical bills. Despite her health issues, Woolley officially moved to New York in September 1926, and subsequently developed two nursery schools within Teachers College for the purpose of studying early childhood education. She hired about fifteen female graduates to work under her, who developed innovative work on early childhood education and collectively advocated for nursery schools. The death of her close friend, Bess Cleveland, and her divorce from Paul, were only two of many factors in Woolley‚Äôs life that caused emotional instability. Woolley took a leave of absence for a year and traveled to various nursery schools in England, Brussels, Vienna, and Geneva in order to gain knowledge on early childhood education in European countries. She resumed her duties in August 1928 and presented two papers at the International Congress of Psychology Conference in Fall 1929. Woolley was shocked when she was asked to resign in February 1930 by Dean William Russell, son of the previous Dean Russell. Woolley‚Äôs accomplishments during her time at Teachers' College included becoming an internationally-known researcher and scholar, having multiple publications, and being considered as one of America's top child psychologists by the age of 55. Unfortunately, she felt that all of this went unrecognized when she was asked to resign, as Dean Russell cited difficulties in her teaching. Woolley harboured resentment towards Dean Russell, and went on to write an 11-paged typescript called, \\"The Experience of Helen T. Woolley in being employed in Teachers College, Columbia University, and in being dismissed from Teachers College.\\" In May, Dean Russell replied to her claims by identifying multiple errors within her typescript which highlighted Woolley's impaired recollection. Woolley spent the next decade attempting to find work in academia but found no success.  Emotional and cognitive difficulties  Woolley's mental illness was a major factor that led to the end of her career and a lack of recognition on her accomplishments. Woolley's mental breakdown could be dated back to 1927, when her husband, Paul Woolley, divorced her. In addition to the divorce, several incidents happened around the same period which affected the basis of Woolley's life: the hysterectomy and appendectomy for the abdominal tumor, a year of commuting between Merrill-Palmer and Teacher's College, the new job at Teacher's College, the death of her friend, Bess Cleveland, and the separation from her daughters. Subsequently, Woolley took a year off work to recover from her breakdown. By February 1927, she was transferred to the Four Winds Sanitarium in Katonah, New York due to her severe depression and suicide attempt. Woolley's doctor, Charles I. Lambert, described that Woolley's illness progressed as a normal depression, with some opposite symptoms such as being overactive, over self-assertive and dominant. Lambert did not think that Woolley should continue her job as a teacher because she was emotionally unstable and lack of self-control, had memory impairment, and liked to do things on her own way. However, Woolley thought that she was fully recovered and resumed work in the fall of 1928. Unexpectedly, Woolley was being asked to resign from Teacher's College by Dean William Russell in February 1930 because of her poor teaching and incompetent administration, although she denied having any problem with her duties. After her resignation, she wrote to her old friend, James Angell, and asked for his help in finding a new job. Angell, however, thought that Woolley was not suitable to work due to her serious condition of mental disturbance. Woolley started writing argumentative letters regarding Dean William Russell's treatment to her in Teacher's College in May 1930. She even went further to write a lengthy typescript to express her anger and dissatisfaction towards Russell. However, the statement contained a lot of errors on the dates and false claims regarding her resignation, reflecting her impaired recollection. In January 1933, Adolf Meyer, a Johns Hopkins psychiatrist, reported that Woolley had an \\"obsession of vindication\\" in regard to her resignation in Teacher's College rather than having depression. According to Woolley's daughter, Eleanor Faxon Woolley, Woolley was increasingly getting more paranoid, and further accused William Russell and Edna White of persuading the others not to assist her. Woolley's obsession continued to grow with her mental illness and could not be resolved. Woolley could not find a job after being dismissed from Teacher's College, which brought her to the end of her career. In Woolley's last years, she became dependent on her daughter, Eleanor. On December 24, 1947, Woolley died of an aortic aneurysm at the age of 73 at Eleanor's home in Harvertown, Pennsylvania.  Publications  During the course of her career, Woolley wrote and published three books and around fifty articles. These published works ranged in topic, and although the vast majority of her works were psychology related, she did publish some philosophy and neurology related articles as a graduate student at the University of Chicago. A list of some of her more well-known published works, particularly those published early in her career, can be found below. * Woolley, Helen Thompson (1907). \\"Sensory affection and emotion\\".

A member of the division Ascomycota, P. appendiculata is characterized by ovoid, hair-studded perithecia which can bear a distinctive violaceous colouring and peridia which are coriaceous, or leathery, in texture. Podospora appendiculata has been shown to produce three compounds (Appenolide A, Appenolide B,and Appenolide C) with antimicrobial properties. History and taxonomy The fungus was first collected by the German mycologist Bernhard Auerswald from hare dung found near the German city of Leipzig. Auerswald sent a sample in a letter to Gustav Niessl von Mayendorf, who published a description of the species under the name Sordaria appendiculata in 1872 before reclassifying it under the genus Podospora in 1883. Contesting Auerswald and Niessl's work, Heinrich Georg Winter later argued in 1885 that the fungus was merely a variant of the species Podospora fimiseda with smaller spores. Winter's assessment was supported by George Edward Massee and Ernest Stanley Salmon, but, upon closer examination in 1934, the Canadian mycologist R. F. Cain agreed with Niessl and set Podospora appendiculata apart as its own species. The cylindrical or conical appearance of the pedicel (an uncoloured, cytoplasm-filled appendage attached to each ascospore) in P. appendiculata allows it to be distinguished easily from P. fimiseda, whose pedicels are club-like in shape. Podospora appendiculata was also discovered independently slightly after Auerswald in 1873 by the Finnish mycologist Petter Adolf Karsten, who classified it as Sordaria winteri, and in 1876 by Job Bicknell Ellis who classified it under the name Sphaeria amphicornis. Habitat and ecology Podospora appendiculata is a coprophilous fungus that grows on the dung of many herbivorous animals but is most strongly associated with the dung of lagomorphs, a group which includes hares and rabbits. While it has been recovered from the dung of horses and cows, Podospora appendiculata tends only to appear in excrement found in forests. In more domesticated settings, such as pastures as fields, P. appendiculata is considerably more scarce. The fungus grows widely in temperate to warm climates, and has been identified naturally in New Zealand, Israel, Japan, Brazil, and in areas throughout North America and Europe. Evidence also exists for an antagonistic relationship between P. appendiculata and certain other coprophilous species. Analysis of 137 global dung samples recovered from nations such as England, Scotland, Yugoslavia and New Zealand revealed a statistically significant negative association between the incidence of P. appendiculata and the occurrence of Ascobolus immersus, Lasiobolus ciliatus, and Podospora curvula. Morphology Podospora appendiculata produces perithecia, necked fruiting bodies laden with sexual spores. Unlike perithecia obtained from other ascomycota, however, perithecia from P. appendiculata lack very prominent necks. Its perithecia are ovoid, appear blackish to purplish, have hyaline (uncolored) tips, and are covered evenly with short, stiff hairs. These hairs are wide and brown at the base, and, like the perithecia, have hyaline, uncoloured tips. The peridium, or outer covering, of each perithecium possesses a coriaceous (leathery) texture and can have a violaceous colouring. Such colouring is very rare amongst coprophilous pyrenomycetes, and in this manner P. appendiculata is similar to two other fungal species both belonging to the genus Cercophora: Cercophora septentrionalis and Cercophora caerulea. As with other members of the ascomycota, the perithecia of P. appendiculata are filled with asci (singular: ascus) that contain, in turn, the sexual ascospores. Each ascus is clavate (club-like) in shape, possesses a small apical ring, and contains 8 ascospores arranged in a biseriate (two-rowed) manner. In contrast to other members of the genus Podospora, the ascospores of P. appendiculata bunch together in the middle of each ascus instead of spreading out through the entire enclosure evenly. While early on in development each ascospore is clavate and hyaline, they become dark in colouring and ellipsoid in shape as they mature. Ascospores all have incredibly sticky, gelatinous, tail-like appendages called caudae, a pedicel that is cylindrical to conical in shape, and a singular germ pore through which future germination will occur. Growth Growth of the fungus on corn meal agar is slow, with only 7-8 millimeters of growth observed after 1 month. The hyphae, or filamentous strands, that characterize the vegetative phase of the fungus become funiculose, weaving together to form rope-like strands. Sparse white aerial hyphae can also develop as the fungus is cultured. Ordinarily, the teleomorph, or sexual stage, of P. appendiculata can be difficult to obtain in vitro. However, perithecial development can be stimulated through the addition of steam-sterilized rabbit dung to the corn meal agar plate. The developmental process is still slow, with 4 months needed for growth, but the perithecia obtained with steam-sterilized dung in vitro are identical morphologically to those obtained from the wild. While its violaceous colouring is already reminiscent of species belonging to the genus Cercophora, Podospora appendiculata bears further similarity to Cercophora in that its spores are able to germinate in their hyaline, immature phase. Although spores are never naturally released when immature, such a feature is still highly unusual among species belonging to the genus Podospora, with only the spores of P. fimiseda being similarly capable. Production of antimicrobial compounds Coprophilous fungi have been known to competitively interfere with other fungi, producing chemical agents that impair the ability of rival species to access resources. There is evidence to suggest that slower-growing fungi, such as Poronia punctata, employ antagonistic strategies more often in order to hamper the reproductive potential of quicker-growing fungi in dung. Podospora appendiculata, itself a slow-growing fungus, has likewise been shown to produce three molecules with antimicrobial properties: Appenolide A, Appenolide B, and Appenolide C. Each molecule is a 2(5H)-furanone. Appenolides A, B, and C display microbicidal activity against a variety of fungi, with 150 micrograms of each compound enough to produce 12-14 millimeter zones of inhibition against Candida albicans in standard disc assays. Similar antifungal effects were noted with all Appenolides against the coprophilous fungi Sordaria fimicola and Ascobolus furfuraceous. Furthermore, Appenolides B and C exhibited additional antibacterial properties in disc assays against Bacillus subtilis. Zones of inhibition of 8 millimeters were noted at concentrations of 150 micrograms per disk. The exact mechanisms of bacterial inhibition for Appenolides B and C remain unknown, but other 2(5H)-furanones appear to interfere with bacterial growth by blocking the activity of N-Acyl homoserine lactones and autoinducer 2 (AI-2), signalling molecules that help mediate quorum sensing. Quorum sensing, a process which allows for differential gene expression in response to changes in cell density, can trigger bacterial biofilm formation when bacteria are present in sufficiently high concentrations. Biofilm formation in turn drives resistance to a range of environmental and biological stressors, including antibiotics and human immune responses, and the 2(5H)-furanone-mediated disruption of quorum sensing has been shown to negatively impact the growth rate of Campylobacter jejuni, a clinically significant food-borne pathogen. 2(5H)-furanone derivatives have also demonstrated in vitro bactericidal effects against Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, two species that have demonstrated increased resistance to more traditional antibiotics.

It is a communal cemetery, built between 3000 BCE and 2300 BCE by the region's earliest herders. It is thought to be eastern Africa's largest and earliest monumental cemetery. The main burial mound is flanked by megaliths, stone circles, and cairns and is believed to hold the remains of hundreds of individuals. Many of the people buried at Lothagam North were adorned with stone beads, ivory, animal teeth, rings or other ornaments. Background  The site is the oldest of six known pillar sites in the area and was in use for almost five hundred years. It is hypothesized that towards the end of African humid period, nomadic peoples would return to the site to bury their dead. The changing climate caused the lake to recede revealing fertile land for herbivores to feed on. The use of the site ended with the end of the humid period. The change in the climate may have forced the local inhabitants to move elsewhere. Recent research published in the Journal of Anthropological Archaeology has argued that the cemetery was for all members of this community, not just the leaders. Each person was buried in a central mortuary cavity approximately deep. At the bottom of the mortuary cavity, pits with additional burials were carved into soft sandstone bedrock. Many burials were covered by sandstone slabs brought in from elsewhere. The cemetery was a planned, multi-generational project.

This was a violation of Title 21 sections 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(D) and 846, and carried a minimum penalty of 10 years in prison and a maximum penalty of Life in prison as well as a maximum fine of $250,000. The charges were filed by the DEA. Summary Stumbo was arrested with more than eight kilogrammes of anabolic steroids when the DEA raided his underground laboratories. Stumbo was also in possession of several guns at the time. The arrest was part of Operation Raw Deal, which targeted the black market manufacturers and distributors of anabolic steroid, human growth hormone and insulin growth factor. A total of 124 people were arrested, and 56 laboratories were seized in that operation. 500 pounds of raw material used for the production of the goods was sourced from China. Often the end user is Stumbo pushed his illicit drugs in bodybuilding website advertisements. His distribution business went by the name of Osoca Laboratories, and posed as an ordinary firm. Communication between Stumbo and the DEA was originated via e-mail. Stumbo used Hushmail as his e-mail service provider. The DEA arranged with Stumbo to purchase by money order his steroid merchandise through a UPS Store maildrop, and discovered that the owner was Stumbo. In order to satisfy the Court that the DEA information was true, the DEA needed to obtain Stumbo's e-mail records. The market differentiation of Hushmail is that it provides secure communication via its PGP Java client-server technology. It was revealed in an interview with Hushmail's CTO that the company complies with British Columbia Supreme Court orders to produce evidence when so requested by competent authorities. This includes warrants approved by the Minister of Justice under the Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Act (Canada). Foreign authorities must make a formal request to the Solicitor-General of Canada who then applies, with sworn affidavits, for an order from the Court. On 25 January 2012, Stumbo was sentenced to 36 months of probation with 120 days to be served in home detention with electronic monitoring after a conviction was obtained.

She moved to the Scotland for her graduate studies, and earned a master's degree in solid state chemistry at the University of Aberdeen. Kendrick completed her doctorate at Keele University. She was a postdoctoral researcher with Sandra Dann at the Loughborough University, where she worked on new ceramic pigments. She moved to the University of Surrey, where she worked with Peter Slater on solid oxide fuel cells.  Research and career  Kendrick spent several years in industry, during which she worked at both Fife Batteries and Surion Energy Limited. She joined Sharp Corporation in 2010. Here she established research and development programs in sodium-ion batteries. She was particularly interested in high energy density devices using cathodes that are optimised for voltage and capacity. She demonstrated a pouch cell with the highest ever volumetric energy density in a sodium-ion battery. She was eventually promoted to Chief Technologist of Energy Storage. The battery systems developed by Kendrick were for both the automotive and portable electronics industries. Kendrick was appointed as Reader in Electrochemical Energy Materials at the Warwick Manufacturing Group in 2016. In 2018 Kendrick joined the University of Birmingham. She is a member of the Materials Chemistry Division of the Royal Society of Chemistry as well as serving on the materials science self-assessment team at the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council. She has several patents in chemical synthesis of materials for batteries. She holds an honorary position at University College London. She is a member of the Energy Research Accelerator Research Council. Alongside battery materials, Kendrick works on lithium-ion battery manufacture. She wants to be able to reclaim and reuse material from batteries for future technologies. Kendrick is particularly concerned about the loss of rare and mined materials, which are currently lost when batteries are recycled in other countries. Before reclaiming battery materials, the batteries be put through a brine discharge using neutral salts. By minimising the rate of corrosion it is possible to recover the cathode and anode materials. Kendrick has called on battery manufacturers to make batteries that are easier to dismantle. She is part of the Faraday battery challenge, a four- year investment by the Government of the United Kingdom that looks to develop new materials for batteries.

Its official name is (Second Republic Drive), is also known as (Loop Road), and is an incomplete ring road encircling the central districts of San Jos√© canton, the capital of the country. Description It is one of the main roads of the capital San Jos√©, its purpose is to avoid the congestion of the inner districts. Currently, it starts in Uruca, in Avenida 39, which then takes south and to the east, finishing in the Goicoechea junction to Route 108 and Route 100. It is designed as dual two-lane road. In San Jos√© province the route covers San Jos√© canton (Zapote, San Francisco de Dos R√≠os, Uruca, Mata Redonda, Pavas, Hatillo, San Sebasti√°n districts), Goicoechea canton (Guadalupe, Calle Blancos districts), Montes de Oca canton (San Pedro, Mercedes districts). Initially, eight roundabouts were constructed, some of which have been modified to include elevated highways, or demolished and turned into a semaphore regulated junction. =Route and access= Starting in Uruca, the road goes through Pavas and allows the access to places like Pavas, Mata Redonda and Escaz√∫. There are junctions with Route 1 and Route 27. Then Hatillo district, Alajuelita canton, San Sebasti√°n are covered by the south section of the road, with access possible to Paso Ancho and Desamparados. The east section covers Zapote, San Pedro and Goicoechea, which allow access to Catedral district, San Francisco de Dos R√≠os, Curridabat canton, Sabanilla, Guadalupe, Calle Blancos and Moravia. Access to the Route 2 is possible on this east section. When the north arc section is finished, it will allow access to Route 32, while there is also a pending design and construction of a link to Heredia through Santo Domingo. History In the latter half of the 1950s, the Housing and Urbanism National Institute (INVU), together with the Ministry of Public Works and Transport (MOPT), proposed the construction of the ring road. It was designated as a public interest project. Twenty years later the project was stalled, and a foreign United States agency suggested to expand the ring to outer districts, away from the city center of San Jos√© and its central districts of Carmen, Merced, Hospital, Catedral, Zapote and Mata Redonda. Construction started in 1979. =Roundabouts upgrades= Several of the ground level roundabouts that were originally part of this road, have been reconstructed, giving priority to the vehicular flow of the Route 39. * Rancho Guanacaste Roundabout: Route 39 goes above in an elevated highway, while there is a roundabout in the ground level. * San Sebasti√°n Roundabout: Route 39 goes below an elevated roundabout composed of two elevated roads. * Paso Ancho Roundabout: Route 39 goes below an elevated roundabout composed of two elevated roads. * Y Griega Roundabout: Route 39 goes through an elevated highway, with a lower level roundabout for the junction between Routes 209, 211 and 39. * Roundabout: At the junction between Route 2 in San Pedro, an elevated highway was constructed for Route 39, the lower level is a roundabout. * Social Guarantees Roundabout: At the junction between Route 215 in Zapote and Route 39, this roundabout includes a two-lane in each direction lower level highway for Route 39. Construction by the MECO group started on 14 January 2019, and it was inaugurated on 30 March 2020, in a remote and virtual ceremony due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As of 2020 the following work is planned for the remaining roundabouts, it was designed as a single construction work by the United Nations Office for Project Services, which supervises the project: * Guadalupe Semaphore Junction: It allows the interchange of traffic between Route 39 (north-south) and Route 218 (east- west), while it was originally a roundabout, it was demolished and a semaphore regulated crossing was built in its place, and then will be converted again to a roundabout in the ground level, and a tunnel on the lower level for Route 39. Construction works by the Consorcio Puentes y Calzadas group from Spain, at a cost of US $19.5 million, started on 1 February 2020, by removing the semaphores and building a temporary roundabout with Jersey barriers. On April 2020 it was announced that a third top level at a cost of US $8 million will be included in the works, as it was determined since 2014 that traffic growth by 2020 will require such structure. Delivery date is programmed for May 2021. * National Flag Roundabout: At the junction between Route 202 in San Pedro and Route 39, this roundabout will include a lower level highway for Route 39. Nearby, at the entrance of the law school of University of Costa Rica, a two- level junction will be constructed to further improve the flow of Route 39.

The team is a member of the Great Lakes Summer Collegiate League, one of 11 leagues in the National Alliance of College Summer Baseball. The Locos play their home games at Simmons Field. History Originally named the Lima Blues, the Lima Locos are one of the founding members of the Great Lakes Summer Collegiate League. Playing their first season in 1987, the Lima Blues finished third among the original six GLSCL teams. The early success attracted the attention of a group of local businessmen from Lima, OH who purchased the Blues and changed the team's name to the Lima Locos for the 1988 season. In 1991, the Locos moved their home games from the campus of Ohio State University, Lima to the field at suburban Shawnee High School. While this moved the team outside of the city, it actually was a great improvement to the facilities the team called home. As opposed to the OSU Lima field, the quality lighting of Shawnee allowed the Lima Locos to host night games for the first time. In 2008, the Locos worked out a long-term agreement with the City of Lima that allowed them to move the team back into the city limits to play their home games at Simmons Field. Like other Summer Collegiate Baseball teams, the Lima Locos are dedicated and designed to providing minor league level competition for NCAA players that wish to continue on into professional baseball. The Locos operate in a similar manner to a Minor League team: playing nightly in stadiums before fans, using wood bats and minor league specification equipment, and experiencing road trips between games. Like all other summer collegiate players, they are unpaid in order to maintain their NCAA eligibility, and live with host families in the same manner as Single A and Independent League players. The Lima Locos are the only remaining team from the original six teams of the Great Lakes Summer Collegiate League.

At BU he was a professor in the Department of English and the Program in African American Studies. Prior to that, he was a professor in the English Department at the University of Maryland, College Park. Jarrett is the author of two books of African American literary studies, and the editor or co-editor of eight additional books of African American literature and literary criticism.https://www.amazon.com/kindle- dbs/entity/author/B001HMPB68?_encoding=UTF8&node;=283155&offset;=0&pageSize;=12&searchAlias;=stripbooks&sort;=author- pages-popularity-rank&page;=1&langFilter;=default#formatSelectorHeader He is the founding editor-in-chief of the Oxford Bibliographies module on African American Studies, published by Oxford University Press. For his scholarly work he has won a number of awards and distinguished fellowships. Early life and Education Jarrett was born on April 21, 1975, in New York City to Jamaican immigrants. His parents instilled him with strong values of hard work and education. ‚ÄúThey were always talking about how education is a pathway toward opportunities,‚Äù he mentioned in an interview. ‚ÄúMy father used to say to me: the harder you work, the luckier you get.‚Äù Jarrett attended Stuyvesant High School, where he explored his dual academic interests in English and Mathematics. The long commute from the Bronx and challenging curriculum were obstacles that ‚Äúyou just had to persevere through,‚Äù he remembered. Despite the obstacles, he recalled Stuyvesant High School fondly. ‚Äú[At Stuyvesant], there were a lot of people who excelled in their studies and it made me appreciate how important it was to bring a certain degree of intellectual intensity and energy to whatever I did.‚Äù In 1993, Jarrett matriculated at Princeton University. He earned a bachelor's degree in English language and literature. Since Princeton disallows double majors, he earned three certificates of proficiency in American Studies, African American Studies, and Applied and Computational Mathematics. He wrote a senior thesis titled ‚ÄúThe Narrative Economy of Race in the Novels of William Faulkner,‚Äù under the directorship of Eduardo Cadava. Jarrett was drawn especially to African American studies: ‚ÄúBecause I am a person of African descent, the issues regarding race and culture interested me in terms of understanding the world in which I lived and gave me a chance to learn more about myself.‚Äù While at Princeton Jarrett became a fellow of the Mellon Mays Undergraduate Fellowship Program. ‚ÄúThe professional relationships I established as an undergraduate through Mellon Mays have persisted for decades,‚Äù he recalled. As a student he was especially influenced by the Princeton professors who focused on the lives of African Americans, including philosopher Cornel West, biographer Arnold Rampersad, and the Nobel Laureate Toni Morrison. Morrison was one of his professors during both his junior and senior years. ‚ÄúShe had blackboards in her office,‚Äù he recalled during an interview after she had passed away on August 5, 2019, ‚Äúand she would have these kind of looping, perfectly proportional, symmetrical letters, and she would write these gorgeous words.‚Äù Jarrett said that when he decided to pursue a graduate degree ‚Äú[Morrison] agreed to write me a letter of recommendation. And so, if it weren ºt for her, I wouldn ºt be where I am today.‚Äù By the time Jarrett graduated from Princeton, he had won an Andrew W. Mellon Fellowship in Humanistic Studies and decided to pursue doctoral study in English language and literature at Brown University. After five years at Brown, he earned his doctorate in English in 2002. Teaching career As Jarrett was finishing his doctorate at Brown, he received job offers to be an assistant professor of English from Boston University and the University of Maryland, College Park. In 2002, Jarrett chose the University of Maryland to start his career as a professor. He earned tenure there within five years, by the age of 32. Upon receiving tenure at the University of Maryland, Boston University reached out again. The offer of a tenured professorship in the English Department, with a joint appointment in the Program in African American Studies, finally lured him to BU. Within five years, in early 2012, he was promoted to full professor at the age of 36, making him one of the youngest faculty at that rank in the entire University. After a decade, Jarrett left BU for NYU, where his appointment as Professor of English accompanied his appointment as Seryl Kushner Dean of the College of Arts and Science. Academic administration Over the course of his career Jarrett has served in academic administration. His major roles include, in the Boston University College of Arts and Sciences, Interim Director of African American Studies from 2009 to 2010, Chair of the Department of English from 2011 to 2014, and Associate Dean of the Faculty for the Humanities from 2014 to 2017. As Associate Dean for the Humanities, Jarrett regularly lobbied as a Massachusetts delegate of the National Humanities Alliance on Capitol Hill for greater federal funding of the humanities, which had for years been contending with threatened budget cuts. ‚ÄúThe NEH and NEA are crucial for supporting not only the scholarly or creative work of faculty in higher education, especially at BU,‚Äù he said in 2017, ‚Äúbut they also fund the programming outside of our academic walls, such as public libraries and museums, which advance the early education of children and the civic education of people living in our communities. Slashing the support of these endowments would undercut the robust educational apparatus, with its attention to the diverse and free expression of ideas, that has distinguished our civic society since the Congressional creation of these endowments in 1965.‚Äù As academic dean, Jarrett co-chaired BU's Task Force on Faculty Diversity and Inclusion, which was created to encourage University-wide discussions on how to make BU a more diverse, inclusive community for faculty members, and to couple institutional data about underrepresented minorities on the faculty with, as Jarrett put it, ‚Äúcrucial historical background and personal stories about the challenges of recruiting and retaining an excellent and diverse faculty‚Ä¶and about the climate of inclusiveness that is important in higher education and at BU in particular.‚Äù The task force comprised 18 faculty and staff from both the Charles River Campus and the Medical Campus, and held two dozen sessions across the two campuses, in every school and college, to speak with faculty and students. The conclusion of the report prompted the University to appoint a University-wide associate provost for faculty diversity and inclusion and equivalent officers in each of BU's schools and colleges. In June 2017, Jarrett was named Seryl Kushner Dean of NYU's College of Arts and Science, and reports to the President and the Provost; his appointment began on September 1, 2017. Among his responsibilities at NYU, Jarrett provides innovative vision and leadership for setting undergraduate academic standards and policies in CAS; updating current and developing new academic programs; and fundraising to improve the access, affordability, and advancement of higher education. Under Jarrett's leadership, CAS launched the first major and minor undergraduate degrees in data science on the New York City campus of NYU. The courses are provided by the curricular contributions of the Faculty of Arts and Science, the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, and the Center for Data Science. CAS established a partnership with NYU Stern School of Business. Graduating CAS students who apply to and are accepted into the pilot program ‚ÄúNYU x NYU / CAS-Stern Pathway‚Äù would automatically receive $10,000 towards the tuition for the full-time, two-year MBA program at NYU Stern. CAS spearheaded NYU's winning of one of 12 institutional mini-grants from the Association of American Universities to improve STEM education. CAS is also seeking to revise its general education requirements, including the Core Curriculum and system of First-Year Seminars, for the first time in over a decade.https://nyunews.com/news/2019/09/24/nyu-cas-core-program-change/ Scholarship Jarrett's first book, Deans and Truants: Race and Realism in African American Literature (University of Pennsylvania Press, 2007), came out of his original belief, first widely noted in his article for the Chronicle of Higher Education, that ‚Äú[a]lthough readers know by heart ‚Äònot to judge a book by its cover,‚Äô they are still likely to remain superficial and prejudge the content of a book based on the author's skin color.‚Äù Jarrett‚Äôs theorizing of ‚Äúracial realism‚Äù has become the basis of a field of inquiry in which ‚Äúwriters of color have historically to be hampered by the narrative structure of realism, a structure that resists the depiction of racial experience.‚Äùhttps://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190642891.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780190642891-e-38; https://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190642891.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780190642891-e-23 The next book Jarrett wrote, Representing the Race: A New Political History of African American Literature (New York University Press, 2011), parses the myths of authenticity, popular culture, nationalism, and militancy that have come to define African American political activism in recent decades. Jarrett has recently completed writing a comprehensive biography of Paul Laurence Dunbar, the Dayton-born African American poet of the turn of the 20th century. To support his writing of the biography, in 2010, Jarrett won the Walter Jackson Bate Fellowship in English Literature from the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard University. Four years later, he won the ACLS Fellowship from the American Council of Learned Societies. The three books written by Jarrett have spawned eight additional books of African American literature and literary criticism, including the Wiley-Blackwell Anthology of African American Literature, the first comprehensive anthology of African American literature to be conceived and published for both classroom and online education in the new millennium. Jarrett is the founding Editor-in- Chief of Oxford Bibliographies in African American Studies, a module published online by Oxford University Press, and providing bibliographic articles that identify, organize, cite, and annotate scholarship on key areas of African American Studies‚Äîculture, politics, law, history, society, religion, and economics.

Founded by marine biologists and conservationists Ilena Zanella and Andres Lopez, the organisation focuses on marine research concerning sharks, sea turtles and rays as well as education programs targeted at local coastal communities.. Operations Misi√≥n Tibur√≥n has its operations center in Guanacaste Province, in the North Pacific of Costa Rica. Since 2019, Misi√≥n Tibur√≥n also carries out regular shark tagging operations from Golfito, in southern Costa Rica. The organisation focuses its efforts on three main areas: marine education, marine research and political and social advocacy . The main aim of its marine education operations is to raise awareness within Costa Rica as well as globally of the importance of sharks in the oceans, the threats that they are facing and their sharp population decline. The scientific marine research area focuses on sharks and other marine species in order to determine management strategies, hence promote their conservation and responsible use. It is the aim of its political and social advocacy area to use technical and scientific information as a tool for influencing civil society and public policy to promote the conservation of sharks and others marine species. Notable initiatives and programs =Scalloped Hammerhead Shark Project= Hammerhead shark, Cocos Island, Costa Rica The scalloped hammerhead shark (Sphyrna lewini) suffered global population decreases of 95% as a result of horrific ‚Äú finning‚Äù practices, as well as accidental bycatch in long line fishing in pelagic watersOcean Sentry (2018, January 27) Scalloped hammerhead shark. Retrieved from http://www.oceansentry.org/ (2019, September 10). Juveniles, despite having too small fins, are still kept and used as bait for larger sharksMission Blue (2019, February 4). HOPE SPOT DECLARED AT GOLFO DULCE, COSTA RICA IN SUPPORT OF NURSERY FOR ENDANGERED SCALLOPED HAMMERHEAD SHARKS. Retrieved from https://mission-blue.org/(2019, September 10). The scalloped hammerhead is one of the sharks most affected by such practises, and according to IUCN Red List is endangered; being a highly migratory species, it is very vulnerable, as conservation efforts have to take place across many nations . In Costa Rica, the traditional dish ceviche encorporates Hammerhead shark meat, contributing to the decline of these vulnerable populations. Following empirical observations in the waters surrounding Cocos Island off the pacific coast of Costa Rica, it was found that populations of adult scalloped hammerhead sharks declined by 45% despite Cocos Island being a protected national parkhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqR96cUkkSw. . Misi√≥n Tibur√≥n collected scientific data using satellite telemetry and acoustic telemetry shark tagging methods providing evidence, from a high abundance of juveniles, that the coastal waters in Golfo Dulce were critical to the scalloped hammerhead‚Äôs survival. Misi√≥n Tibur√≥n‚Äôs data indicated that whilst adult sharks feed in the rich pelagic waters surrounding Cocos Island, they must migrate over 300 miles - along an underwater mountain range - to reach the mangrove coastal region of Golfo Dulce where females give birth to live young. The pups then remain in the sheltered root system, thriving off rich nutrient waters and benefiting from the protection by avoiding predators. As a result of Misi√≥n Tibur√≥n‚Äôs work, the coastal regions of Golfo Dulce were assigned as the Scalloped Hammerhead Shark Sanctuary by the government of Costa Rica: this marked the first shark sanctuary in Costa Rica as well as the first shark sanctuary in the world focused on protecting juvenile sharks. The protected area covers over 10,000 acres of habitat in the Golfo Dulce region. Illena Zanella with a juvenile scalloped hammerhead shark in Golfo Dulce =Whitetip Shark Project= The whitetip reef shark (Triaenodon obesus) gains its name from the unmissable white tipped dorsal and caudal fins, inhabiting global tropical coastal waters as well as coral reefs. The Whitetip shark populations are threatened by multiple human activities including fishing; in Costa Rica, Misi√≥n Tibur√≥n is focusing on conserving these sharks through tagging programs to track their populations, of which little is currently known. The program focuses around Cocos Island National Park and other hot spots off the Pacific Coast of Costa Rica. =Bull Shark Project= The bull shark (Carcharhinus leucas) is a migratory species distributed globally - in mostly warm, shallow waters such as rivers and estuaries, being fresh or salt water. Juvenile sharks require the protection of mangrove coastal regions, such as Potrero Grande Mangrove and Punta Respingue Mangrove in Costa Rica, to thrive. These important habitats and populations lack scientific data, which could aid in the conservation of this species vulnerable to fisheries. Misi√≥n Tibur√≥n aims to collect such data using acoustic and satellite tagging programs, utilising their findings to promote conservation of the Bull Sharks by working with local communities and approaching the governmental sector. =Marine Education= Misi√≥n Tibur√≥n recognises that conservation involves education, their motto being ‚Äúconocer para proteger‚Äù; as part of their work to conserve the scalloped hammerhead shark, they run educational activities in local coastal communities as well as participatory workshops with local fishermen operating in the Golfo Dulce region. By communicating with such fisheries, they can prevent mortality rates of juvenile hammerhead sharks. ‚ÄúShark Route‚Äù is another scheme that focuses on educating elementary aged students about marine resources and the importance of the sharks‚Äô role in aquatic ecosystems, as well as their vulnerability to human activity. Misi√≥n Tibur√≥n aims to help educate over 3,000 public-school students with the message of ‚ÄúSave the Hammerhead Shark‚Äù, with plans to construct a learning station in the port town of Golifto, situated in the Golfo Dulce region along the pacific coast. =Cocos Island's Training Program for Rangers= Cocos Island Costa Rica Cocos Island National Park is a marine life hotspot, hosting a variety of biodiversity, 530km from mainland Costa Rica in the pacific ocean. There are no permanent residents inhabiting the Island apart from park rangers, visiting scientists and tourists on day trips. Misi√≥n Tibur√≥n is working with the rangers, conserving the island through education of new biological skills. By training the park rangers on how to obtain scientific data on the pelagic species through technical assistance, Misi√≥n Tibur√≥n can collaborate with the research station on Cocos Island to help tackle illegal fishing. Awards, Sponsors and support Misi√≥n Tibur√≥n signed a Cooperation Agreement with the National System of Conservation in March 2010, formalising an alliance with Cocos Island Marine Conservation Area (ACMIC) allowing collaboration of education and technical training. Misi√≥n Tibur√≥n also worked with the Rainforest Trust for the establishment of the juvenile shark sanctuary in Golfo Dulce. . Through Misi√≥n Tibur√≥n's efforts, in 2018 Golfo Dulce was nominated and assigned a \\" Hope Spot‚Äù following the regions recognition for being critical to the survival of the scalloped hammerhead shark species; in particular, the vulnerable juveniles and pups. Misi√≥n Tibur√≥n is thus supported by the global organisation Mission Blue, a charity created by the oceanographer Dr Sylvia Earle. After being presented with the Whitley Award in 2019, Ilena Zanella secured ¬£40,000. of funding for one year and her organisation Misi√≥n Tibur√≥n gained support from the Whitley Fund for Nature. This UK-registered charity, established in 1993, supports conservational organisation globally with funding and by helping to raise awareness, through social media In the media As part of the Whitley Award recognition to Ilena Zanella in 2019, a short film of Misi√≥n Tibur√≥n‚Äôs work was released, narrated by Sir David Attenborough..

It was situated in Etobicoke, then a township, just north of the village of Long Branch and just west of the city of Toronto. It operated from 1924 until 1955 at a location west of Kipling Avenue, north of Horner Avenue and south of Evans Avenue. The track is the originator of two stakes races that are still run today - the Canadian International Stakes and the Cup and Saucer Stakes. The track opened in September 1924. It was owned by Abe Orpen and his family which also owned the Dufferin Park Racetrack in Toronto. The track was in length. Panoramic view of Long Branch racetrack on opening day, 1924 History Abraham \\"Abe\\" Orpen and Thomas Hare, operators of the Dufferin Park Racetrack in Toronto, began construction on the new Long Branch track on June 26, 1924, under the supervision of Thomas Clarke. Construction of the half-mile turf track was completed in time for a seven-day meet beginning on September 6, 1924. Over 400 horses were in eight new stables with fifteen jockeys and 55 owners represented. The land for the track cost and the track facilities, including a 10,000-seat grandstand, cost . The first day was a big success as 10,000 attended. An additional one-mile-long turf track was added in November 1924. The track operated two seven-day horse-racing meets annually, one in June and another in the fall. Located on a rail line, special trains were run to the track from downtown Toronto. A dispute erupted between Orpen and the Government of Ontario. To operate the track, Orpen had applied to the Government of Canada to incorporate the Long Branch Racing Association which would operate the track. The letters patent were published in the Canada Gazette on September 6, the day the track held its first races in a meet of seven races a day for seven days. The Government of Ontario immediately attempted to shut down the track, while also collecting a percentage of the wagers placed at the track. The Attorney-General of Ontario, W. F. Nickle claimed that the Canadian government had granted the license without consulting him first. Nickle declared the letters patent received by Orpen to be invalid because they were for athletic purposes only, meaning that betting was illegal. The case went to trial where the Crown argued that the letters of incorporation for the Long Branch Racing Association made no mention of horse- racing. The defence readily admitted that the track had accepted wagers and paid a percentage of wagers and an amusement tax to Ontario. Long Branch lost the case and was fined $249, but announced that they would continue with their next set of races in October 1924. Orpen then filed for another charter with the Canadian government for the October races. Orpen filed an appeal of the conviction but lost. Orpen also applied for a racing charter with the Ontario government and a return of the money that the Ontario government had collected, which he failed to get returned. Orpen next filed a suit in December 1924, claiming the Government of Ontario had wrongfully collected a tax on the wagering. The dispute continued into 1925. The Ontario government threatened to deny Orpen a license to operate if he did not pay in arrears. In February, Orpen's lawsuit of December 1924 was dismissed. Further, in April 1925, the Ontario government announced an increase in the tax on betting, estimated to cost Orpen an extra , based on his 1924 revenues from Dufferin Park and Long Branch. Orpen stated that the extra cost would likely mean the suspension of operations at Dufferin and Long Branch. In June 1925, Orpen paid the disputed after the Ontario government threatened to prevent racing later that month at the track, by using the Ontario Provincial Police to block racing. Wagers at the 1925 spring seven-day meet totalled million, which net the Ontario government thousand. The total for the 1925 season was million in wagers and another in gate receipts. After a down year at Ontario tracks overall in 1926, the Ontario government reduced the cost of the per-day racing permit from to per day for the 1927 season. In 1927, Long Branch expanded its stables to 494 stalls, citing an expanded interest. In 1928, it added an \\"amplified\\" public address system similar to that used at race tracks in Maryland. In its fall meet, the track added a moveable stall starting gate, a first for a North American track. That season Long Branch's wagering rose above million to million, surpassing Orpen's other Toronto track Dufferin, which had wagering of million, but less than Kenilworth's wagering of million. In 1936, Long Branch became the first Canadian race track to employ the camera \\"photo finish\\" system to settle close races. In September 1937, Abe Orpen died and the track was continued by his partner Thomas Hare and his sons A. M. Orpen Jr and Fred Orpen. Hare died in February 1938 and the Orpens bought out his estate in 1942. After the 1941 fall races, the track was turned over to the Government of Canada for war purposes. In April 1942, Long Branch announced the cancellation of its two 1942 meets. Although it was suggested that the four race tracks of Toronto consolidate their races at Woodbine, the Orpens received permission to move their 1942 races to Dufferin Park. Dufferin Park also hosted the 1943 through 1945 meets. The track held its last race meet in 1955, finishing on October 21, 1955. Along with Dufferin Park, Long Branch racetrack was sold for by Fred Orpen to the Ontario Jockey Club, which consolidated horse-racing in Toronto at the two Woodbine racetracks. The Ontario Jockey Club continued the Cup and Saucer Stakes, the Canadian International Stakes and the Wild Mink Stakes, which had only been run once, in 1955. Notable races The first Cup and Saucer Stakes, for Canadian two- year-olds, was run on October 13, 1937, at Long Branch. It was originally known as Mrs. Orpen's Cup and Saucer Handicap, named after Abe Orpen's wife. The first winner over the one mile and 70 yards distance was Suffern, owned by Harry C. Hatch and ridden by Charlie McTague. It had 18 entrants. It had a purse of , the richest race for two-year-olds in Canada. In 1938, Long Branch inaugurated the Canadian International Stakes, (first known as the Long Branch Championship) open to all thoroughbreds three-years-old and older. The first race was held on October 10, 1938 and was won by the three-year-old Bunty Lawless, ridden by Tommy Aimers and owned by Willie Morrissey. Bunty Lawless would win the race again three years later, in 1941. Other prominent races held by the Long Branch Jockey Club included the Orpen Memorial for three- and four-year-olds foaled in Canada, and the Long Branch Handicap for three-year- olds and up. Other events The track was used for other events. On July 12, 1925, the Orangeman Parade of Long Branch ended at the track where former Toronto Mayor Thomas Church along with Ontario Minister of Highways George Stewart Henry took the salute. On August 8, 1925, the West York Conservatives held a picnic at Long Branch. Over 15,000 attended, including members' families. Boy Scouts and Girl Guides held activities for member's children. The children's activities drowned out the political speakers (Forbes Godfrey and Henry Drayton) and they had to cut their comments short. The track was loaned to the Conservatives by Orpen. A Liberal Party rally was held on September 18, 1938, where Ontario Premier Mitchell Hepburn spoke. Legacy The site is today part of an industrial area in Etobicoke, including a large Goodyear Tire facility. Along Horner Avenue at the railway line, there remains a column from the south entrance and a grove of trees leading north, marking the entranceway. The site is marked by a historical plaque. The two stakes races originated at Long Branch - the Canadian International Stakes and the Cup and Saucer Stakes - are continued today at Woodbine Racetrack in north Etobicoke.

He helped revive lithography as a fine art around the 1960s. He had a printing studio called Hollander‚Äôs Workshop.  Biography  Born 30 November 1927 in New York City's Lower East Side neighborhood. He grew up in Williamsburg, Brooklyn and was childhood friends with actor Mel Brooks. He struggled in his early life with work, eventually wanting to learn commercial lithography printing however since he did not have the job training or skills, he learned by taking a series of jobs and getting fired from them. Eventually he qualified for a lithography job and earn himself a journeyman‚Äôs card. At the time he was living in San Diego, California and working in commercial lithography and in nearby Los Angeles, he learned that June Wayne had founded the Tamarind Lithography Workshop. Hollander wanted to work alongside artists, so he took interest in Tamarind and became the first master printer trained. Tamarind and Hollander were instrumental in introducing American postwar artists to printmaking as a fine art tool. One of Hollander's students at Tamarind was Kenneth E. Tyler. In 1964 he moved back to New York City to open his own print studio, Hollander‚Äôs Workshop located at 90 East 10th Street. Hollander was offering established New York artists such as Robert Motherwell and Willem de Kooning a fast and cheaper way to sell art. He closed Hollander‚Äôs Workshop in 1972, and decided to teach printmaking at Cranbrook Academy of Art for many years and was the head of the Printmaking Department from 1973‚Äì1975, before he focused on creating his own work. He died 16 November 2018 in Brooklyn, New York. Some of the artists he worked in collaboration with included Robert Motherwell, Hugo Weber, Willem de Kooning, Sam Francis, and others. Hollander's work is in many public art collections including the Smithsonian American Art Museum, Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA), Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco (FAMSF), and others.

Early life and education  Lutkenhaus was inspired to study engineering by her family. Her mother studied chemistry and her father studied physics. She studied chemical engineering at the University of Texas at Austin and graduated in 2002. She moved to Massachusetts Institute of Technology for her doctoral degree, which she finished in 2007. After earning her doctorate under the supervision of Paula T. Hammond Lutkenhaus moved to the University of Massachusetts Amherst. In 2008 Lutkenhaus joined the faculty at Yale University.  Research and career  Lutkenhaus joined the faculty at Texas A&M; University in 2010, and was promoted to Associate Professor in 2015. She develops new materials for energy storage and smart coatings, including polyelectrolytes and redox active polymers. She looks to develop soft and flexible power supplies for wearable electronics that are durable, sustainable and efficient. A challenge with using polymers in batteries is that typically polymers are not good at storing and exchanging electrons. Lutkenhaus has demonstrated that organic radical polymers are electrochemically active; allowing for fast charge transfer during redox reactions. If used in portable electronic devices, organic radical polymers could enable fast charging. Lutkenhaus has characterised the speed of charge transfer in these systems using an electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance. Lutkenhaus hopes that future batteries will be metal-free, organic and recyclable. At present, only 5% of lithium-ion batteries are recycled. Lutkenhaus and Wooley demonstrated that glutamic acid could be used to make batteries ‚Äì the first fully biodegradable protein battery. The peptides contain redox-active compounds, the stable radical Tempo on the cathode and bipyridine viologen on the anodes. Lutkenhaus has studied how polymer films behave when they deposited in confined spaces. She is developing two-dimensional transition metal-carbon nanosheets (MXenes), which are sheet-like structures made from layered ceramics. They can include a range of different composites and functional groups. Lutkenhaus is investigating how chemical structure and molecular packing influence the electronic properties of these materials. She has shown that a MXene ‚Äì polyelectrolyte device can be used to sense humidity and pressure, as water facilitates the relaxation of charged molecular assemblies by reducing Coulombic attraction. = Awards and honours = Her awards and honours include; * 2011 National Science Foundation CAREER Award * 2012 Texas A&M; Engineering Experiment Station Young Faculty * 2013 Air Force Research Laboratory Young Investigator Prize * 2014 Kaneka Corporation Faculty Scholarship * 2014 3M Non-Tenured Faculty Award * 2016 Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute Van Ness Lectureship * 2018 American Chemical Society WCC Rising Star Award * 2018 University of Notre Dame Thiele Lectureship * 2018 Texas A&M; University Presidential Impact Fellow * 2019 Japanese-American-German Frontiers of Science Kavli Foundation Fellow * 2019 World Economic Forum Young Scientist = Publications = Her publications include;  She serves on the editorial board of ACS Macro Letters, Macromolecules and Scientific Reports.

Korean musketeers were also present from Joseon. It resulted in the retreat of Russian forces. Background In 1652, Qing troops led by Haise unsuccessfully attacked the Russian fort at Achansk. Two years later Qing forces returned and forced the Daur villages to relocate away from the Amur River into the valley of the Songhua River, depriving the Russians of provisions. On 26 March 1654, 152 soldiers from Joseon under the leadership of Byeon Geup departed from Hoeryeong. They joined the Manchu forces at Ningguta after eight days of travelling. Faced with depleting supplies, the Cossacks abandoned their fortresses and ventured into the inner Amur valley where they encountered the Qing-Joseon forces. Battle On 27 April 1654, Onufriy Stepanov and his men encountered the Qing-Joseon forces after sailing three days on the Songhua River. Stepanov had around 400 men and 39 ships while the Qing had 160 ships carrying roughly a thousand men. Despite the numerical disadvantage, the Russian ships were far larger than the opposing vessels, which were basically small boats. The largest ones could carry no more than 17 men. The two sides exchanged fire with the Russians winning out in the end. As the Russian forces chased after their fleeing enemies, they were ambushed by Korean musketeers entrenched on a hill overlooking the river. The Russians attempted to storm the Korean position, but fierce fusillades from the allied Manchu, Daur, and Korean forces inflicted heavy casualties, forcing them to retreat. Aftermath The Qing chased the Russian forces for three days, built an earthen fort on the Amur, and retreated to Ningguta by 13 June. Though diminished, Stepanov's forces continued to exert influence on the Amur for several years afterward. Anticipating another attack by the Qing, Stepanov rebuilt the Kamora fortress. On 16 February 1655, Qing commander Mingandali besieged Stepanov's forces. The Qing forces, 10,000 strong, failed to take the fortress and ran out of food, retreating the next month, but not before they had destroyed the Russian ships. At the same time, the Qing resettled the Daurs and Duchers to the Mudan River, depopulating the Amur region. References Bibliography * .

Octavian broke off the betrothal to marry Clodia Pulchra, so instead she married Marcus Aemilius Lepidus Minor, the son of Octavian's fellow triumvir Marcus Aemilius Lepidus. Biography =Early life= Servilia was the daughter of Caesarian consul Publius Servilius Vatia Isauricus and Junia Prima, the eldest daughter of Servilia Caepionis, a mistress of Julius Caesar and prominent woman of the late republic. This made her the niece of Junia Secunda, Junia Tertia, Marcus Junius Silanus and Marcus Junius Brutus, Caesar's assassin. =Marriage plans= Servilia was engaged to Octavian. This was likely a politically-motivated betrothal, since her father was one of Octavian's supporters and her mother, Junia Prima, was a sister-in- law of the triumvir Lepidus (married to Junia Secunda), thus the marriage would have strengthened Octavian's bonds with the two. Nonetheless, he eventually rejected her and married Clodia Pulchra instead. She went on to marry Lepidus Minor instead. This union was possibly proposed by her mother and Lepidus in an attempt to soothe any ill feelings created by Octavian's rejection. =Death= In 31 BC, her husband led a plot to assassinate Octavian, motivated by the banishment of his father (and possibly the scorning of his wife). He had tried to restore his exiled father to a position of authority but was caught and condemned to death. When her husband was killed, she committed suicide, the method of which is stated in ancient sources to have been swallowing hot coals or alternatively drinking to death, possibly due to coal-eating being regarded as too Gothic. Suicide by a widow was considered a great sign of devotion in Rome at the time. It has been propossed that her manner of death might have been misatributed to her cousin-once- removed Porcia historically. Research In the past historians sometimes believed that she and Augustus had actually married, but it is widely agreed upon today that they were only ever engaged. It has been proposed that the character of Lavinia in The Aeneid was in part intended to represent Servilia. Cultural depictions Servilia appears Colleen McCullough's Masters of Rome series, first in The October Horse where Octavian promises her father to marry to get him on his side, when this is decided she is still too young to marry so Octavian plans to wait out the engagement until he can find someone he is actually in love with.https://books.google.se/books?id=bnTa22Mk38UC&pg;=PT844&lpg;=PT844&dq;=Servilia+Vatia&source;=bl&ots;=civ8X307YK&sig;=ACfU3U2bExEbQJm0kBiynKpBZbFihqDbtQ&hl;=sv&sa;=X&ved;=2ahUKEwjPiPXsidbmAhXkwcQBHc5bC20Q6AEwBHoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q;=Servilia%20Vatia&f;=false In In the 2007 novel Antony and Cleopatra by Australian author Colleen McCullough, Servilia is mentioned several times.

Built in 1926, it is a good example of a commercial Classical Revival building, built by a prominent local developer. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. It is now mostly occupied by residences. Description and history The Duprey Building is located in downtown Worcester, on the west side of Norwich Street, a one-block street paralleling Main Street between Foster and Pearl Streets. It is a six-story structure, built with steel frame construction finished in limestone and brick. The ground floor has two central window bays, flanked by an entrance to the retail space on that floor, and by the entrance to the upper floors. The upper floors are also four bays wide, with single sash windows in the outer bays and doubled sash windows in the inner ones. Trim details vary by floor, but are generally Classical Revival in style. Corinthian pilasters flank the bottom two floors, and a cornice separates the second and third floors. A low parapet incised with \\"DUPREY\\" crowns the facade. The building was built in 1926 by Philip Duprey, a prominent local real estate developer and businessman, best known for his ownership of the Worcester Lunch Car Company. It was designed by Jasper Rustigian, an Armenian immigrant who trained at the Worcester architectural firm Fuller & Delano. The upper levels of the building were originally filled with professional offices, including those of Duprey's real estate business. The upper levels have recently (2017‚Äì18) been converted into residential space.

It resulted in Russian defeat. Background In 1657, ≈†arh≈´da commissioned the construction of large warships which could stand up to the Russian vessels. By the next year, 52 vessels had been produced, 40 of which were large and mounted with cannons of various sizes. Sin Ryu's 260 musketeers arrived at Ningguta on 9 May. A day later, the allied forces set sale towards the mouth of the Songhua River. After five days, they ran into a group of Duchers who informed them that the Russians were in the area. They waited there for fifty of ≈†arh≈´da's newly built warships to arrive. The war fleet arrived on 2 June and set sail again three days later. Battle The allied forces encountered Onufriy Stepanov's fleet on 10 June. The Russians set up a defensive formation along a riverbank, where they exchanged fire with the Qing ships to no great effect. Once the allied forces closed in, the Cossacks broke formation and fled to shore or hid in their ships. Just as the Korean forces were about to set fire to the Russian ships, ≈†arh≈´da halted them because he wanted to keep the ships as booty. Taking advantage of the brief lull in battle, the Cossacks counterattacked, killing many of the allied forces. Forty Cossacks managed to board a deserted Qing vessel and flee but they were eventually hunted down and slaughtered. The Russian ships were destroyed using fire arrows. Aftermath The Russian defeat cost them control of the lower Amur region up to Nerchinsk, where only 76 Cossacks garrisoned the fortress. Half these men deserted the outpost soon after. Although a group of independent Cossacks would return to Albazin in the 1660s, the Russian state withdrew most of its commitment to the Amur region, leaving it a no man's land.

The book was published on September 10, 2019 by Penguin Press. About the book Megan Twohey's book signing at right The book details the behind-the scenes and publicly known processes the authors employed to investigate and publish stories uncovering sexual harassment and sexual abuse by high-profile and powerful men. The book details new information that helped break the Weinstein story, including sources, documents, and chasing leads. It follows the reporters \\"from the first exploratory phone calls, to a mounting trail of evidence, to a final face off with a [well known] belligerent\\" accused person. It also deals with the open questions about which behaviors and gray areas should constitute sexual harassment: > Kantor admitted that there is ‚Äúa mounting sense of unfairness on both sides‚Äù > about a system that no one thinks ‚Äúworks for the accuser, or the accused.\\" > Their job remains, as Kantor put it, to ask the three main questions > surrounding any allegation: ‚ÄúWhat is the scope of the behaviors under > scrutiny?;‚Äù ‚ÄúHow do we get the facts right?;‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhat should punishment > and accountability look like?‚Äù The authors continue to investigate these questions. To help persuade sources to talk to them, the sources were told that what happened in the past cannot be changed but \\"together we may be able to use your experience to help protect other people.\\" =Gatekeepers= The book chronicles the intersection of executives, companies, lawyers, gossip columnists, tabloid publishers, talent agents, entertainment companies, and Public Relations (PR) companies that became enmeshed in Weinstein's circle of influence which served to submerge information about his behaviors, but was an open secret. Quid pro quo took the form agreeing to buy film rights to books and stories for \\"high-grossing films\\", and promising on-screen roles The focus is on the systemic \\"structures of power\\" that enabled Weinstein for decades. The reporting, which followed \\"whispers and rumors\\" occurring over 30 years, was supported by large numbers of interviews with actresses, past and present employees, filings in court, corporate records, and \\"internal company communications that documented a thick web of cover-ups, bullying tactics and confidential settlements.\\" Gwyneth Paltrow was instrumental in helping the reporter-authors behind the scenes and whose efforts are chronicled in the book. Near the end of the book, the authors discuss Christine Blasey Ford and the choices that led her to publicly confront Brett Kavanaugh, then Supreme Court nominee. =Reviews= According to the book review aggregator Book Marks, She Said received critical acclaim.Book Marks. Literary Hub. Retrieved: April 26,2020 In her review for The New York Times, Susan Faludi, wrote, \\"Kantor and Twohey have crafted their news dispatches into a seamless and suspenseful account of their reportorial journey, a gripping blow-by-blow of how they managed, 'working in the blank spaces between the words,' to corroborate allegations that had been chased and abandoned by multiple journalists before them. She Said reads a bit like a feminist All the President‚Äôs Men.‚Äù The Times noted that, \\"This book was one of our most anticipated titles of September\\".

History The Toledo & Indiana Railway, Inc., was incorporated in 1901 to construct an electric interurban line west from Toledo to Stryker, Ohio, and was extended in 1905 to Bryan, Ohio. The line ran parallel to the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway (later the New York Central) on the north side of that alignment. It was envisioned as being a link to Indianapolis, Indiana, and Chicago, Illinois. These expansions and connections were not completed. A branch of the Garrett, Auburn and Northern Electric Railroad from Waterloo, Indiana, to Bryan was never constructed. The line offered more frequent service at lower fares than the adjacent steam road. It had 31 stations on its 57-mile line between Toledo and Bryan. At its peak, Toledo was served by eleven interurban companies.Patch, David, ‚ÄúToledo was hub of interurban 100 years ago,‚Äù The Blade, Toledo, Ohio, 27 May 2007. ‚ÄúIn 1905, the T. & I. constructed a power plant near the Tiffin River in Stryker, and rails were extended to Bryan. Later that year, the T. & I. completed a car maintenance and storage facility east of its power plant and erected a combination passenger/freight depot on East Lynn Street in Stryker.

The current building was erected in 1901‚Äì1902 by architect √âdouard Fournier. The Art Nouveau restaurant was decorated by Louis Tr√©zel, Armand S√©gau and Hippolyte Boulenger, and opened in 1903 as Gandon-Fournier. In 1924, the establishment was handed over to Julien Barbarin. Several signs representing peacocks were made by Armand S√©gaud, whereas the mahogany counter is attributed to cabinetmaker Louis Majorelle. Louis Tr√©zel depicted four women on several sintered-glass panels inspired by Alfons Muchas's iconography. The tiled floor, which depicts a wild aquilegia and daisy meadow, was crafted in Hippolyte Boulenger's pottery works in Choisy-le-Roi, whose headquarters where located in the neighborhood of the restaurant.. At Julien Barbarin's request, Georges Guenne's company installed large window panes which let the natural light pour into the room; the drawings of the windows were made by Charles Buffer, the father of painter Bernard Buffet. In 1938, the restaurant was renamed Julien (or Chez Julien). In 1975, the establishment was purchased by Groupe Flo led by Jean-Paul Bucher. The restaurant was renamed Bouillon Julien in 2018.

The manor was established in 1675 and had the same owners as nearby Holmegaard until 1801. It was then owned by the Post family from 1801 to 1925 and has most recently been owned by the Riegels family since 1931. The current main building is from 1915-16 but its design is inspired by traditional Renaissance style manor houses. The estate covers approximately 1,000 hectares of land. History =Frans and Kai Lykke= Kai Lykke Broks√∏ was established in 1650 when Frans Lykke merged two farms on Spragelse. a small peninsula surrounded by bogland, and named the estate after his wife Elisabeth Brok. Lykke was also the owner of the estates Gisselfeld and Rantzausholm. All three estates were after his death in 1657 passed to his son Kai Lykke. In 1601, Lykke was sentenced to a great fine after accusing Queen Sophie Amalie of adultery in a letter which was exposed to the king. When he fled to Sk√•ne instead of paying, he was sentenced to death for L√®se-majest√©, was executed in his absence and had his property in Denmark confiscated. Gisselfeld, including Broks√∏, was initially granted to Crown Prince Christian (V). Broks√∏ and ten other farms were later placed under Holmegaard. =Krabbe, Trolle and Restorff families= Otto Krabbe In 1670, Frederik III granted Holmegaard to his page, Otto Krabbe. In 1675, Holmegaard and Broks√∏ were both granted status of manors. Krabbe was promoted to chamberlain shortly after Christian V's ascend to the throne. He left the royal court in Copenhagen a few years later when he was appointed to county governor (amtmand) of Tryggev√¶lde. Otto Krabbe's widow, Birgitte Skeel, kept Holmegaard and Broks√∏ after her husband's death in 1719. Their three children had all died in an early age. Birgitte Skeel bequeathed Holmegaard and Broks√∏ to Otto Krabbe's niece, Birgitte Restorff, who married Knud Trolle later that same year. Birgitte Restorff, who outlived her husband by 30 years, kept the estates until her death in 1790. =The Post family= F. C. Ki√¶rschou: View of Broks√∏ Manor, 1851 Having no children, Restorff bequeathed her estates to her niece, Margrethe Elisabeth Restorff, who was married to Peder Lasson von Post. In 1801, he sold Holmegaard and Broks√∏ to Christian Conrad, Count of Danneskiold-Sams√∏e. In 1802,Peder Lasson von Post's third eldest son, Carl Ludvig Post, bought Broks√∏ back from Danneskiold- Sams√∏e. He was later succeeded first by his son and later by his grandson as owner of Broks√∏. His grandson's widow, Margrethe Post, constructed a new main building in 1914-16. =The Madelung and Riegels families= In 1925, Margrethe Post sold Broks√∏ to K. Ekstr√∏m. The estate was the following year sold to Peter Madelung. Peter Madelung had previously T√•rnborg at Kors√∏r and Hollufgaard at Odense. In 1931, Broks√∏ was acquired by Hans Vilhelm Riegels. He had earlier in his life made a fortune in the timber industry working for the East Asiatic Company in the Far East. After his return to Denmark, he had most recently been the managing director of H.C. Christiansen A/S. Architecture The current main building from 1915-16 was designed by Gustav Bartholin Hagen. The building consists of two storeys under a tall hip roof clad in red tiles. The walls are white-washed. The front of the building features a three-storey median risalit with a monumental staircase and two lower corner pavilions with hip roofs. The facade towards the gardens feature two projecting, octagonal corner towers with conical red tile roofs. Avlsg√•rden, a half-timbered complex of farm buildings, fate from before 1850. In 1972, Riegels ceded Broks√∏ to his daughter Charlotte Riegels Hjorth. Today The estate has a total area of approximately 1,000 hectares.

This genus is notable for its widespread appearance on the excrement of herbivores, and is therefore seen as a coprophilous fungus. The fungus itself is characteristically dark in colour and produces sac-like perithecium with a covering of hair. Its dispersion involves the ingestion, passage, and projectile ejection of spores. It has preference for colonizing the dung of lagomorphs, such as hares and rabbits. History and taxonomy Podospora setosa was first described in Germany in the year 1873 under its basionym Sordaria setosa by G. Winter. In 1883, the fungus was given the name Posospora setosa by mycologist Niessl. Since 1883, P. setosa has had synonymy within multiple genera including Pleurage (1898), Philocopra (1907), and Cladocheate (1912). These genera can share similar morphology of ascus and spores, as well as habitat. Most recently, the species was described under the name Triangularia setosa (2019) by X.W. Wang and Houbraken. The genera Triangularia was used to distinguish the triangular, or wedge-like, appearance of spores. Growth and morphology Podospora setosa grows optimally at 25¬∞C and in conditions where light is present. Its rate of growth and production of fruiting bodies can be manipulated by the presence or absence of light. In the absence of light, growth is stunted and production of perithecium does not occur. The only exception to this is in conditions where high amounts of water are present, in where perithecium may develop. In light conditions, perithecium will develop and the fungus will grow maximally. Podospora setosa develops best in light on the shorter end of the visible spectrum. Longer wavelengths have shown to be less effective at promoting growth, with the maximum wavelength for growth production being 510nm. Podospora setosa is multicellular and has been observed in its sexual state only. As a member of the Ascomycota, development of ascus occurs within a sac-like structure. This sac, the perithecia, has a wide base, thin neck, and is covered in hairs. Podospora setosa has the majority of these hairs are at the base of its fruiting body. The hairs are off-white in colour and are approximately 600Œºm long and 3Œºm wide. This fungus has an apical ring, which may vary in visibility as it has been described as both conspicuous and non-conspicuous in the literature. Inside the perithecia are asci, each containing eight ascospores. A perithecia of P. setosa has been estimated to house 512 spores. The spores themselves are 19Œºm in length with a single apex on which exists a germ pore. Inside the ascus, spores are arranged densely and without organization. When mature, they are brown in colour, ellipsoidal in shape, and are coated in a clear hyaline covering. The spores possess a primary appendage at the distal end, and a secondary appendage at the apex. The secondary appendage, a feature which is commonly seen in coprophilous fungi, is thought to help with attachment to plant material. Under heavy-water conditions, swelling of the hyaline sheathe and activation of the secondary appendage allows for optimal attachment to surfaces. Physiology The cycle of successional colonization of P. setosa involves the ingestion and excretion of the fungus by herbivorous animals. Spore projection from animal excrement allows for transferring of the fungus between animals. The process of spore dispersal requires the build-up of osmotic pressure inside the perithecia. At the threshold of pressure, ejection of spores occur through the apical pore. This pore is surrounded by an elastic ring which changes shape as the spore passes. The recoil of the apical ring back to its original shape following distortion amplifies the velocity at which spores exit the ascus. In the case of P. setosa, spores released in larger quantities (>100) may be ejected up to a distance of 35cm. Notably, spore release may become rhythmic if given a day- night cycle. Habitat and ecology The favoured carbon source for P. setosa is the excrement of herbivorous animals, due to the broken-down plant material and abundance of Nitrogen. Though it is primarily found in the dung of herbivores, there are records of the fungus in the feces of omnivores. The dominance of bacteria makes this an unlikely occurrence, and as such it has yet to be recorded on the excrement of any carnivorous animals. Podospora setosa may also be found on non-digested material, such as vegetable seeds, soil, and decaying plant material. Podospora setosa has been documented within many different countries including Canada, Germany, Spain, Brazil, Australia, the United Kingdom, and Ireland. These records indicate its presence in the excrement of rabbits, geese, farm animals, horses, and possums. The fungus itself favours the colonization of lagomorphs over ruminants, but surprisingly can be found on material passed by both types of digestion. This shows an ability to withstand digestion from several hours up to several days, as lagomorphs routinely ingest their own fecal matter. The smaller percentage of colonization in ruminants and horses may be due to competition with other types of cophriphilous fungi, who are not able to withstand the longer digestion times of lagomorphs.

The work was played as a postlude for the funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales.Funeral Service for Diana, Princess of Wales at bbc.com  Prelude  The prelude is believed to be the more mature of the two movements due to structural similarities between this movement and the Leipzig organ preludes of BWV 548 and BWV 544, all of which showcase a massive, intricate ritornello- concerto construction. Much of the opening theme for this work was subtly arranged and transposed in G minor for the lighter opening chorus of the cantata Wer sich selbst erh√∂het, der soll erniedriget werden, BWV 47,Cantata 47 at Classical.netJones 2013, 61. which was performed on 13 October 1726 in Leipzig. After the stately initial dialogue, the piece is soon flanked with a flurry of running triplets, intertwined with a looming second theme, with the original one reoccurring only in fragments until its final statement.Williams 2003, 108.  Fugue  The alla breve fugue is believed to have been written during Bach's time in Weimar, and was added to the prelude during his time in Leipzig. Some believe the movement may have been partially or fully composed by Kellner.Williams 2003, 110. References Work cited *Williams, Peter (2003), The Organ Music of J. S.

Early life  Buck was born in Las Vegas, New Mexico on July 5, 1900 to Arthur Perry Buck and Henrietta Hume Pettijohn. As a child, Buck was sickly and spent most of her time indoors. She witnessed a murder when she was 18, and had to serve as a witness in the court case. While in court, she watched Earl Rogers' defense, and was inspired to study law. She graduated from the University of Southern California in 1920. Buck was the first woman to pass the California Bar exam. She worked for two years in Los Angeles, then moved to Hawaii.

She became the assistant U.S. District Attorney for the Territory of Hawaii in 1925, and led raids on illegal okolehao stills. Soon after she started this position, however, she became an attorney at the City and County of Honolulu's attorney's office. Two years later, she entered private practice. In 1928, Buck ran for a seat in the Hawaii Territorial House of Representatives. She lost, and chose not to run again, but remained an active member of the Democratic Party of Hawaii. In 1934, Buck was appointed to replace William Charles Achi Jr. on the Fifth Circuit Court on Kauai by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. She regularly substituted in other courts in Hawaii, including the Hawaii Supreme Court in 1935. She was appointed to the First Circuit Court in Honolulu in 1942. Buck retired from the bench in 1958, and was replaced by Edgar Crumpacker. Later that year, she opened her own practice. Out of the 4,000 judgments she made throughout her career, only 9 were reversed. Notable cases she presided over include the Morgan's Corner murder. Buck died of pneumonia on October 18, 1959 at Queen's Hospital.

History and taxonomy Ascosphaera aggregata (A. aggregata), discovered in 1975 by Jens-Peder Skou is a fungus that is related to Ascosphaera apis. Habitat and ecology A. aggregata is an obligate parasite that causes chalkbrood in bees, symptom manifestations differ depending on age of the larva. It primarily infects alfalfa leafcutting bees, Megachile rotundata. Megachile rotundata infected with A. aggregata have been detected in the United States, Canada, and South America. Other bee species that A. aggregata has been seen to infect include the red mason bee (Osmia rufa), the patchwork leafcutter bee (Megachile centuncularis), Megachile pugnata and Megachile relativa. Growth, morphology and pathobiology A. aggregata is an obligate parasite that can cause chalkbrood by the fifth instar. The majority of the life cycle and growth of A. aggregata occurs in M. rotundata larvae. Infection of bee larvae occurs only via ingestion of resting spores, and is not possible via spore inhalation nor contact with the fungal vegetative form. Spores develop in the larva and cause it to swell, bursting the larval integument (giving the dead larvae a ragged appearance) and furthering the spread of the fungus. Buildup of larval cadavers traps the unaffected emerging bees, forcing them to chew through the cadavers and be covered in spores. Bees covered in spores then contaminate food provisions for other broods and spread the infection. Early vegetative growth utilizes gut lumen nutrients. A. aggregata grows through the midgut wall to the hemocoele (event trigger is unknown, not because of lack of space nor food) eventually replacing larval tissue. Resulting larva are filled with a mycelial mat comprising two layers: a dense inner layer and a less dense outer layer. =Sexual development= Ascospore morphology consists of two layers: an inner chitinous and smooth layer, and an outer layer that is rough, spotted, and not composed of chitin nor cellulose.;) Ascospore development in A. aggregata is very unique and the resulting structure is referred to as a \\"spore cyst\\", or \\"ascocyst\\" or \\"synascus\\". Sexual development occurs on the outer mycelial mat in the subcuticular region, and is documented to proceed as follows: # The vegetative hyphae tips swell and form a thallus # The middle of the thallus grows and forms a nutriocyte (previously referred to as an archicarp) # The apical portion differentiates into the trichogyne cell. # Compatible trichogyne fuse and initiate plasmogamy. # Resulting dikaryotic fungal protoplasm then enters the nutriocyte and causes enlargement of the nutriocyte. # Nutriocyte growth causes the integument to rupture and initiate development of a fragile spherical structure without a cell wall. # Individual spores then pack together into a seemingly membrane-less spore ball. # Multiple spore balls then join and form a spore cyst. # Cell wall deposition changes spore colour from opaque white to grey to dull black Physiology A. aggregata has been found to be unable to break down chitin. =Diagnostic Considerations= Although ascospore development is very unique, it is very hard to identify A. aggregata because the spore balls and conidia tend to resemble other species. Recent investigations by James and Skinner (2005) have discovered that PCR of the ITS domain of ribosomal DNA with species specific primer sets allows the detection of fungal DNA (working, even, in asymptomatic individuals). The PCR technique can also be used on hair and honey samples to avoid the difficulty of culturing spores, as spore were shown before to only germinate well in lipids. Storage of the fungus has also proven to be difficult as it collapses after 1‚Äì2 months during normal culture passaging. However, Jensen et al. (2009) found that spores could be preserved via cryopreservation or freeze-drying whereas hyphae unfortunately could not be preserved. Economic importance M. rotundata is the primary pollinator of the commercially grown alfalfa seed, accounting for 46,000 metric tonnes of North American alfafa seed (two-thirds the global production) in 2004. M. rotundata is also the second most valuable field crop pollinator, behind the honey bee, because of the value of alfalfa in animal feed and hay. A. aggregata has been killing this economic pollinator in the US since 1972 and has been reported to be able to kill greater than 50% of a population. Effective management of the fungus has yet to be discovered, as the current registered treatment in Canada (paraformaldehyde fumigation of spores) involves a carcinogen and other treatment options (heat and chloride treatments) are expensive and labour-intensive.

Against Crimean Tatars  = Soviet era = After the deportation of the Crimean Tatars in May 1944, the government strongly promoted existing negative stereotypes of Crimean Tatars and built up upon them; declaring them to be \\"traitors\\", \\"bourgeoisie\\", \\"counter- revolutionary\\", and falsely implied that they were \\"Mongols\\" with no historical connection to the Crimean peninsula. Political agitation by party members encouraged other citizens at deportation destinations to abuse them and conferences in Crimea dedicated to promoting and sharing anti-Crimean- Tatar sentiments was held. Traces of Crimean Tatar presence in the peninsula were wiped off the peninsula after the deportation in 1944, with thousands of villages previously bearing Tatar names being given new Russian names, officially detatarizing the peninsula. The deported Crimean Tatars who worked in Central Asia lived under the \\"special settler\\" regime, which deprived them of many civil rights that other Soviet citizens enjoyed and confined them within a small perimeter. Historians have noted similarities between the conditions suffered by so-called \\"special settlers\\" and victims of apartheid as well as Palestinians in occupied territories. = In modern times = While still very prevalent in modern society, Tatarophobia generates more controversy and pushback in modern times than it did in the past. While no longer officially a state-mandated institution, it remains pervasive throughout government and society; a notable example being when Russian consul Vladimir Andreev demanded that none of the invited Russian citizens attend the debut of Haytarma, a film about Crimean Tatar twice Hero of the Soviet Union Amet-khan Sultan, because it did not depict the Crimean Tatar population in a sufficiently negative light. Andreev admitted that he did not actually see the movie when he told people not to attend, but said that he felt it would be historically inaccurate because it was directed by a Crimean Tatar. Confusion about different Tatar peoples has been taken advantage of by propaganda, which will celebrate the relative equality experienced by Volga Tatar in order to lead uneducated recipients of propaganda to confuse them with Crimean Tatars and be led to believe that interethnic relations are overwhelmingly positive. It is not unusual for Volga Tatars to be praised and lauded as brotherly peoples by the same institutions that simultaneously engage in Tatarophobia against Crimean Tatars, and it is not unusual for the relative lack of hostility towards Volga Tatars to be pointed out as an excuse to avoid correcting xenophobia towards Crimean Tatars. Despite the Crimean Tatar language being very distant from the Kazan Tatar language, the Soviet Union long opposed the request by the Crimean Tatar civil rights movement for their autonomy to be restored in Crimea, and offered to create an autonomous region in Tatarstan for them instead - insulting much of the Crimean Tatar leadership.  Against Volga Tatars  Historically the Volga Tatars have been lauded as a \\"model minority\\" in Russia and the Soviet Union and treated much better than the Crimean Tatars. Nevertheless, prejudices against Volga Tatars exists and there have been some attempts to de-Tatarize Tatarstan by Russian nationalists. After Elmira Abdrazakova was crowned Miss Russia in 2013, she was bombarded with racial slurs.

He obtained a Masters degree and Ph.D at the University of Chicago. Born in Jackson, Mississippi, He would later become an educator at Howard University. During his time at Howard, he was the dean of the liberal art college and later became the dean of Howard‚Äôs graduate school, where he made several administrative and scholarship changes. Additionally, he founded the Journal of Negro Education, an academic journal pertaining to the education of African-American students. Thompson himself published over 100 scholarly articles, editorials, and research papers; many of which pertained to the teaching and advancement of African-American student's education. Throughout his extensive academic career, he was a legal consultant for various desegregation school cases, prominently in Sweatt v. Painter, Sipuel v. Board of Regents of the University of Oklahoma, McLaurin v. Oklahoma State Regents. He also was a legal consultant for Brown vs. Board of Education, though to a lesser extent that the three former cases. Early life and education Charles Henry Thompson was born on July 19, 1895 in Jackson, Mississippi. He is an only child to parents Reverend Patrick H. and Mrs. Sara E. Thompson. Thompson attended his early years of education at Jackson College. Since there were very few high schools for African Americans in Mississippi, in 1911 Thompson decided to attend Virginia Union University to obtain his high school and college education. Virginia Union University was one of the few colleges that allowed the enrolment of African Americans. Joshua Baker Simpson, the Union faculty member of that university inspired many students like Thompson to appreciate research as a tool for enhancing the human condition, specifically the African Americans. After graduating from college with high honours in 1917, he went to serve in the military overseas during World War I. After finishing his time in the military in 1919, Thompson was enrolled in the University of Chicago. At this university, African Americans were usually required to repeat a year or two of their undergraduate studies to prove their abilities to complete a graduate study. This resulted in Thompson earning a second baccalaureate with special honours in psychology. In 1920, he completed a master‚Äôs degree in education with a thesis called ‚ÄúA Study of the Reading Accomplishments of Colored and White Children.‚Äù His thesis‚Äô main focus is comparing the different learning abilities of black children in the City of Chicago. Then he was teaching at Virginia Union while working on his doctorate in fall 1921 at Chicago. From 1922 to 1924, Thompson was an instructor in teacher training at the State Normal School in Montgomery, Alabama. He then resumed to complete his doctorate in educational psychology. Thompson was one of the first African Americans to complete a doctorate in education with a specialization in educational psychology. He chose this pathway as an educational psychologist because of his desire to be able to be in a position to help others gain access to information. Thompson worked to provide other African American students with the opportunity to use the resources available to him in education to be able to spread information about education and race. He had a strong belief that education should be available to gifted African American students and anyone in low income families so that everyone would be able to have access.  Personal life  Thompson's wife, Mae Stewart Thompson from Washington, D.C. was a long- standing physical education teacher in the Columbia District Public Schools. She later became a health and physical education supervisor at Howard University. Career Thompson first served as an instructor of psychology at Virginia Union University from 1920 to 1921. The following year, he became the director of instruction at Alabama State Normal School until his departure in 1924. A year later in 1925, Thompson found another position, this time at Summer High School and Junior College in Kansas as a psychology and social science professor. He would quit this position again only a year later. =Howard University= Thompson finally settled down at Howard University, serving as a faculty member from 1926 up until his retirement in 1966. He held many positions during his time at the university, including: Associate Professor, Professor and Chairman of the Department of Education, Dean of the College of Liberal Arts, Dean of the Graduate School and Founder and editor- in-chief of The Journal of Negro Education. As the Dean of the College of Liberal Arts, Thompson implemented selection procedures of promising high school graduates through the utilization of nationwide scholarship examinations. He forwarded efforts into improving admission processes to the University and introduced an advisory system catered towards freshman students. Furthermore, Thompson aided in both studying and expanding the usage of standardized testing and in developing faculty tenure policies and improvement procedures (at the university). As the Dean of the Graduate School, Thompson oversaw changes to numerous sections of the programs, including the master‚Äôs degree requirements as well as both the standards of admission and scholarship. Thompson also served as an editorial consultant for both ‚ÄúThe Nation‚Äôs Schools‚Äù from 1943 until 1950 and ‚ÄúWorld Book Encyclopedia‚Äù from 1942 until 1962. Thompson served as an expert education witness on numerous desegregation cases, including the 1946 ‚ÄúSweatt Case‚Äù in Texas, the 1947 ‚ÄúSipuel Case‚Äù in Oklahoma and the 1947 ‚ÄúMcLaurin‚Äù in Oklahoma. Ideas =\\"Separate but equal\\" counter-arguments= In an article in Thompson‚Äôs ‚ÄúJournal of Negro Education‚Äù titled ‚ÄúCourt Action the Only Reasonable Alternative to Remedy Immediate Abuses of the Negro Separate School‚Äù, Thompson provided a counter-argument for segregated schools and argued that in order to desegregate schools, courts must implement the desegregation. Thompson argued that courts have fewer disadvantages than any other method of fighting segregation. He also argued that courts are the best option for long-term changes and policy changes could take years. Additionally, in his paper, he emphasized that segregated schools have no benefit and he broke down his argument in three parts. Segregation is a form of stigmatization. This stigmatization virtually always comes from white policy makers and administrators. At the time Thompson wrote his article, it was argued that segregated schools are at the benefit of African-American children. However, Thompson emphasizes that segregation is implemented because of an overarching idea that African-Americans are ‚Äúinferior and undesirable‚Äù to Caucasians. Segregated schools are not economically viable. The cost of maintaining and running two schools in the same district is doubled since there is an African- American and Caucasian school. He also purported that if there are not enough funds for both schools. Most of the educational resources go to the Caucasian school, which disadvantages the African-American schools. He asserts that due to this unequal distribution that the ‚Äúseparate but equal‚Äù fairness mantra is a myth. Segregated schools are not only disadvantageous to African-American children, but also Caucasian children. He argues that children‚Äôs formative years should be spent exposed to different races in order to learn to respect others. The integration could promote anti-racist and prosocial attitudes among both groups of children. He counter-argues the notion that integrating African-American children in Caucasian school could create increase prejudice by stating African-Americans will experience prejudice in other ways in their lives regardless and integration is better for future decreasing of prejudicial attitudes. =Argument against racial intellectual inferiority= During Thompson‚Äôs early academia career, most papers pertaining to African- American students presented those students inherently inferior in terms of scholastic and academic achievement than their Caucasian counterparts. Thompson believed that the existing evidence of academic inferiority was unreliable. He used samples from various schools across several states comparing rural and city raised Caucasians and African-Americans. He found that African-Americans who were schooled in cities outperformed Caucasians who were schooled in rural areas, presumably because there was a lot of allocated funding to city schools. He argued that there aren't racial differences in academic performance and performing adequately is a result of a child‚Äôs environment. However, in rural areas African-Americans underperformed compared to their Caucasian counterparts. Thompson attributed this to lack of opportunities. He concluded that the overwhelming accepted idea of racial intelligence inferiority (during his time in early academia) was a myth and it was undemocratic to impose policy based on unfounded science. =Educating gifted African-American students= Thompson emphasized that those who grew up in poverty or in segregated schools were the ones to benefit the most from higher education. He proposed the following to aid in the success of gifted students: lower tuition fees, for accessibility of gifted students who can‚Äôt afford higher education, provide nation-wide scholarship for exceptional African-American students, to reevaluate the admission guidelines to target prospective students with the most potential to succeed, emphasize preparatory, vocational and cultural goals rather than purely academic to educate students by emphasizing talent, from research, teaching and leadership, smaller class sizes taught by skilled professors, similar to those of Virginia Union. For professor to be proactive leaders and mentor prospective gifted students. Thompson argued that his proposed university improvements would aid in the success of gifted students. Although, his improvements were not approved when he first introduced them, he slowly made progress throughout his academic career as he moved on to larger administrative roles. Contributions =Journal of Negro Education= In 1931, Charles Thompson decided to create a paper called the Journal of Negro Education. Even before creating this journal, Thompson would write articles for other papers criticizing the laws on education for African Americans and Caucasians. This made him to want to create the paper to draw more global attention on the issues of education for African Americans. However, during the time that Thompson proposed his paper was when there were many budget cuts to African American education. The importance of the paper was doubted in this time of low funds but was thought to be useful to bring national attention to Howard University. His main purpose for starting the journal was because he believed there was a lack of information on African American education making it hard to have good schooling for people of colour. He expressed four reasons why he created the Journal of Negro Education: the lack of information on African Americans, the need for discussion about the segregation of schools, the journal would propose a further investigation in the lack of education for African Americans and finally the journal was something that was necessary at that time. Thompson worked to bring the journal to life despite the challenges that he came across. To the authority figures that worked for the University Thompson would explain the journal in more mild terminology to not cause alarm to them so they could provide funding for it. However, to the audience that read his journal he stayed true to make bold statements about the discrimination that occurred in education for African Americans. He used the journal as a way to provide information about various different African American related culture, history, arts, etc. Thompson pushed this journal as a way to talk about the issues of racial segregation and to bring more awareness about it. He received support from Du Bois and Walter White (head of NAACP) but the editor of The Journal of Negro History was against Thompson publishing his journal because of how similar the name and content would be to his paper. This did not stop Thompson as he still pushed to create this journal. Thompson‚Äôs overall goal of the journal was to reduce educational discrimination and bring awareness of the problems with segregation. =Sweatt Case= At the start of the school year in 1944 there was a surge of African Americans applying for post-secondary schooling but due to a lack of resources, space and staff it was not possible to admit all these students. This sparked debate amongst many people of colour as they wanted to be able to attend higher schooling at universities that were at the time only for White Americans. This came to the attention of Thompson, which he then wrote an article about in The Journal for Negro Education about the failure of the government to follow through with the Gaines decision that stated that segregated schools should have equal access and resources. An important case that occurred during Charles Thompson‚Äôs time was The Sweatt v. Painter case. Thompson was asked by Marshall to be an expert witness in this case. This was a case about the issue of a student named Bill Sweatt that wanted to attend a law school that was only for White Americans so he set out to court to argue that he should be allowed to attend. Thompson played a role in contributing to Sweatt‚Äôs case by providing information about the issues with segregation in education. He spent weeks preparing to testify for the case as well as touring the University of Texas to understand how the environment is. He compared the difference in resources and opportunities for African Americans vs. White Americans in Texas schools to show the discrimination that African Americans suffered from. Not everyone agreed with Thompson‚Äôs views and it was argued that his testimony was irrelevant so it no longer was a part of the record. However, his role in the case brought an important aforementioned perspective in the discrimination against African Americans in education.

Tasked with investigating some unnatural deaths at the Dachau concentration camp near Munich, Hartinger together with his medical examiner colleague, Moritz Flamm, discovered the SS policy of summary executions and faked suicides at the camp. At great risk to his own safety, Hartinger issued an indictment of the camp authorities, which was ultimately betrayed and suppressed. Early life Josef Michael Hartinger was born on 14 September 1893 in the village of Pertolzhofen, Bavaria. He studied law at the Ludwig Maximilian University, Munich and was employed as state solicitor of the Bavarian Ministry of Justice, servicing initially the Munich I (central) district and later Munich II (the outer limits). War Service 1914‚Äì18 Having come from a family with a strong military tradition,Ryback, Timothy W. Hitler‚Äôs First Victims: The Quest for Justice, Vintage, 2015. Hartinger dropped out of college in August 1914 to enlist in the 10th Bavarian Field Artillery Regiment under the III Royal Bavarian Corps. After two years of training, he was sent to the Western Front as a petty officer, where he saw action on the Vosges plateau, at Verdun and Flanders in 1917, where he was awarded the Iron Cross. In September 1917 he was transferred to the 6th Bavarian Field Artillery and in February 1918 was promoted to third sergeant. After some successes in the German Spring offensive of 1918, the Bavarian 6th Field Artillery crossed the Somme and were charged with weakening the British defenses around Villers-Bretonneux. The regiment was decimated, however, under a 4-hour barrage from the British guns. Hartinger was awarded the Military Merit Cross (Bavaria) and subsequently promoted to Lieutenant, committing to three more years of military service. After the armistice in November 1918, the Royal Bavarian Corps were disbanded and absorbed into the Reichswehr. Inter-war Legal Studies & Career 1918‚Äì31 After the armistice in November 1918, Hartinger returned home to find Bavaria in a state of political chaos. As with many war veterans from a middle-class background, he joined with the Freikorps in opposition to the Munich Soviet Republic but in early 1919, he left the militia, resigned his commission at the Reichswehr (foregoing a guaranteed monthly payment) and re-enrolled as student in the law department of Ludwig Maximilian University. Despite living in poverty for most of his time in University, Hartinger excelled in his studies and qualified in June 1924. His first employment was in Amberg prison where he provided legal advice on criminal proceedings and prison matters. After serving as assistant to the deputy prosecutor in Passau, he was appointed to the civil court in the jurisdiction of Munich I, where over six years, he established a reputation as an opponent of the rising right-wing radicalism. In March 1931, Hartinger was promoted from assistant prosecutor in Munich I to deputy prosecutor in Munich II. Dachau murder investigations Following the Reichstag Fire Decree for the Protection of People and State, the Nazis began interning political rivals (KPD and SDP members) in concentration camps. One of the first to open was at Dachau, where detainees were guarded by 70 members of the Bavarian Police force. As Chief of Police in Bavaria, Heinrich Himmler arranged for the Police to be gradually relieved of this duty by the newly- formed private army of the Nazi party, the Schutzstaffel (SS). On March 12, the day after the SS arrived, the State solicitor's office received a report of four deaths among the prison population. As any death in State custody (other than from natural causes) had to be investigated, Josef Hartinger and medical examiner Moritz Flamm were dispatched to Dachau concentration camp. Camp commandant Hilmar W√§ckerle showed them to a spot where the four prisoners were shot while trying to escape into the woods and later to a shed where 3 of their bodies were piled on the floor. Hartinger berated the guards on the undignified treatment of the bodies before he and Dr. Flamm set about identifying and examining them. They quickly noted that all the dead prisoners (Rudolf Benario, Ernst Goldmann, Arthur Kahn) were Jewish and had been shot at the base of the skull. The second Kahn brother, Erwin, survived the escape shooting but four days later died while under SS guard in hospital. Without challenging the guards on these points, the investigators returned over several days to carefully document the evidence, with Flamm performing autopsies on the four prisoners. Hartinger and Flamm noted many inconsistencies between the injuries on the corpses and the camp guards' accounts of the deaths. With each visit, they had more and more deaths to investigate, such as the case of Sebastian Nefzger, a camp guard, who had allegedly committed suicide. The autopsy showed his back severely bruised all over and evidence of internal bleeding. He had allegedly tried to hang himself with the straps of his own prosthetic leg and when that failed, he had inflicted cuts on his own wrists so deep that they penetrated the bone. The autopsy of the lawyer Alfred Strauss, who was also shot trying to escape, revealed that he died of a bullet in the neck after suffering serious physical attacks. His back was covered with lacerations and his buttocks bandaged to hide a deep cut. Over a number of months, they uncovered clear evidence of murder and compiled a dossier of charges against Hilmar W√§ckerle, the SS commandant of Dachau, Dr. Werner N√ºrnbergk the camp doctor and Josef Mutzbauer, the camp's chief administrator (Kanzleiobersekret√§r). In May 1933, Hartinger presented the case to his superior, Bavarian State Prosecutor, Karl Wintersberger. Initially supportive of the investigation, Wintersberger became reluctant to submit the resulting indictment to the Justice Ministry, which was increasingly under the influence of the SS. Wintersberger chose to be open about the investigation with Dachau camp staff and with politicians. Wintersberger refused to sign the indictment and suggested Hartinger submit it himself. In June 1933, Hartinger reduced the scope of the dossier to the four clearest cases. Johann Kantschuster was accused of murdering Alfred Strauss. Karl Ehmann was accused of murdering Leonhard Hausmann. The murderer(s) of Louis Schloss and Sebastian Nefzer could not be identified so charges were brought against W√§ckerle, N√ºrnbergk and Mutzbauer for abetting the murder and obstructing investigation. Wintersberger signed it, after first notifying SS Reichsf√ºhrer Heinrich Himmler as a courtesy. The killings at Dachau suddenly stopped (temporarily), W√§ckerle was transferred to Stuttgart and replaced by Theodor Eicke. The indictment and related evidence reached the office of the Bavarian Justice Minister, Hans Frank, but was intercepted by Gauleiter Adolf Wagner and locked away in a desk only to be discovered by the US Army after the war. Both Hartinger and Wintersberger were transferred to provincial positions. In 1934 Wintersberger became President of the Higher Regional Court in the city of Bamberg. Hartinger was first moved back to Munich I and then to a position in Amberg. Flamm was no longer employed as a medical examiner and he survived two attempts on his life before his suspicious death in a mental hospital the same year. Postwar and later life In 1946 Hartinger's missing files were discovered by the US Army in the Bavarian Justice Ministry and were used in evidence in the trials of senior Nazis at the N√ºrnberg tribunal of 1947. Flamm's thoroughly gathered and documented evidence within Hartinger's indictment ensured it achieved convictions of senior Nazis such as Oswald Pohl. Wintersberger's complicit behaviour is documented in his own evidence to the Pohl Trial. Although the three accused parties named in Hartinger's original indictment were already dead, the indictment also mentioned \\"persons unknown\\" who may have acted on their behalf and one of their most brutal underlings, Hans Steinbrenner was still alive. On the basis of Hartinger's original indictment, Steinbrenner was charged with the murder of Louis Schloss and (with new evidence from several former Dachau prisoners) the murders of Wilhelm Aron and Karl Lehrburger. At Steinbrenner's trial in 1952, the jury reached the following verdicts: Murder of Schloss: not guilty, Grievous Assault of Schloss: guilty (sentence 2 years), Murder of Lehrburger guilty but under duress from his commanding officer (sentence 10 years), Murder of Aron: Guilty (sentence life imprisonment). From his cell in Landsberg prison in 1962 Steinbrenner typed an 8-page confessional letter, which he sent via the prison authorities to Hartinger. He told Hartinger that he himself would have been killed in 1933 had he not been known by so many powerful dignitaries. In May 1963 Steinbrenner was transferred from the prison at Landsberg am Lech to a nursing home in Berchtesgaden, where he later hanged himself. The Allies' initial plans for the Denazification of Germany in 1945 were diluted when faced with the practicalities of creating a functioning German state. Unlike Wintersberger, Hartinger had not joined the Nazi party before the war but by 1945 over 90% of lawyers and all judges were party members. The practicality of running the judicial system won out over the principle of Denazification especially when it was entrusted to new German state. So in the post-war German legal system, Hartinger still had to deal with many personalities who had been enthusiastic Nazis and others who had conformed with the regime. The infamous Braunbuch published by the GDR claimed to list all functionaries of the Federal Republic of Germany who were former Nazis and war criminals. The 1968 edition lists Josef Hartinger as former Military Court Councillor (\\"Kriegsgerichtsrat\\") of the \\"H√∂heres Kommando LX\\" (a communications division of the Wehrmacht). Whether such a position would have afforded him scope for war crimes is arguable but it contradicts the record in the Bavarian State Archive that shows him working as director of the district court (\\"Landgerichtsdirecktor\\") in the town of Amberg from 1936 until the end of the war. As with all German lawyers, Hartinger came before a Denazification hearing (Spruchkammerverfaren) in 1948 and was restored to his position in Amberg. From 1954 to 1958 Hartinger went to work for the newly-founded Federal State Prosecution Service (\\"Bundesanwalt beim Bundesgerichtshof\\") in Karlsruhe. From 9 December 1958 he served as Chief Secretary at the Bavarian Ministry of Justice until his retirement on 5 December 1966. Hartinger completed his memoirs on February 4, 1984. He died 6 months later.  Portrayal in the media  He featured in The First Six Months in Power the second episode of the 2019 BBC production called Rise of the Nazis first broadcast at 9pm 9th Sep 2019. He was played by Kristupas Kavaliauskas. The episode describes the investigation into the murders as Dachau when he was deputy state prosecutor.

ReRites crystalized out of Jhave's initial work generating poetry from selected corpora with tools such as TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch. This was Jhave's BDP (Big Data Poetry) project, noted and discussed along with the development of what was to be ReRites in Scott Rettberg's Electronic Literature. Jhave is also a theorist of poetics in digital media. In Aesthetic Animism he argues that the dynamic and interactive properties which digital media may afford to linguistic artefacts gives evidence of the animism, the life that, according to some, invests all things. Aesthetic Animism was given an illuminating review by Davin Heckman for rhizomes, and Scott Rettberg also cites the book, summarizing certain of its ideas and explaining Jhave's concept of TAVIT 'Text-Audio-Visual Interactivity'.

At a briefing on \\"the security and intelligence threats to elections\\" of the House of Commons Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics, the chair Bob Zimmer (CPC), said that the 2019 general election \\"may be different\\" from past elections in Canada. as the \\"tools that were used to strengthen civic engagement are being used to undermine, disrupt and destabilize democracy.\\" He said, \\"democracies around the world have entered a new era‚Äîan era of heightened threat and heightened vigilance‚Äîand 2019 will see a number of countries brace for volleys of attempted disruption: India, Australia, Ukraine, Switzerland, Belgium, the EU and, of course, Canada. Evidence has confirmed that the most recent Canadian general election, in 2015, was unencumbered by interference, although there were some relatively primitive attempts to disrupt, misinform and divide. These efforts were few in number and uncoordinated, and had no visible impact on the voter, either online or in line.\\" Zimmer described the three pillars. The first is \\"enhancing citizen preparedness\\" through the \\"digital citizen initiative\\", the second pillar is \\"improving organizational readiness\\" with national security and intelligence agencies supporting Elections Canada. The third pillar included the establishment of the Security and Intelligence Threats to Elections Task Force (SITE) which works as a team with the Communications Security Establishment (CSE), the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS), the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), as well as Global Affairs Canada, to \\"ensure a comprehensive understanding of and response to any threats to Canada's democratic process.\\" Zimmer said that as part of this third pillar, \\"We have activated the G7 rapid response mechanism, announced at the G7 leaders' summit in Charlevoix, to strengthen coordination among our G7 allies and to ensure that there is international collaboration and coordination in responding to foreign threats to democracy.\\" Background Leaders of the G7 countries‚ÄîUnited States, Canada, Japan, Britain, France, Germany and Italy, met in Charlevoix, Quebec in Canada from June 8 to 9, 2019.

Charlevoix Commitment states that \\"foreign actors seek to undermine our democratic societies and institutions, our electoral processes, our sovereignty and our security. These malicious, multi-faceted and ever-evolving tactics constitute a serious strategic threat which we commit to confront together, working together with other governments that share our democratic values.\\" The Charlevoix Summit resolved to \\"establish a G7 Rapid Response Mechanism to strengthen our coordination to identify and respond to diverse and evolving threats to our democracies, including through sharing information and analysis, and identifying opportunities for coordinated response.\\" The Charlevoix Summit was the 44th G7 summit Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced five themes for Canada's G7 presidency which began in January 2018. In January 2019, Policy Options said that, \\"the nascent Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM) initiated in 2018 under Canada's G7 presidency to defend against foreign threats holds promise and could offer a valuable model of cooperation for future efforts to defend democracy and the ideas that underlie it.\\" The RRM initiative seeks to strengthen the leading democracies' ‚Äúcoordination to identify and respond to diverse and evolving threats‚Ä¶including through sharing information and analysis, and identifying opportunities for a coordinated response.\\" =2019 European Parliament election= Global Affairs Canada's (GAC) Rapid Response Mechanism Canada (RRM Canada) comprehensive report on the 2019 European Parliament election analyzed open data \\"related to foreign interference during and leading up to the 2019 European Union Parliamentary Elections, May 23‚Äì26, 2019\\". RRM Canada did not find \\"significant evidence of state-based foreign interference, or any large-scale, organized and coordinated efforts by non- state actors\\". They did find find that \\"national or international non-state actors\\" used tactics based on those used by the Russian sponsored Internet Research Agency (IRA) in previous elections, \\"such as the 2016 U.S. Elections\\". For example, blogs, webpages, and social media accounts on Twitter, Facebook and Reddit \\"were used to spread divisive and false information to damage and negatively impact social cohesion and trust in democratic processes and institutions\\" in coordinated networks of Facebook groups. = 2019 Alberta general election = A May 2019 report by RRM Canada, which was published online on September 6, 2019 analyzed open source data including Twitter's platform in the period before the 2019 Alberta general election, which was held on April 16, 2019. The analysis was intended to \\"identify any emerging tactics in foreign interference and draw lessons learned for the Canadian general elections scheduled to take place in October 2019.\\" While there was no foreign activity detected, the data revealed \\"\\"suspicious account creation pattern that is indicative of troll or bot activity\\". They found \\"automated inauthentic behaviour and trolling activities\\" but concluded that they were \\"very likely domestic in nature\\". The data showed \\"suspicious account creation pattern that is indicative of troll or bot activity\\", and \\"spikes in account creation\\" which suggested the \\"presence of accounts developed for a specific purpose.\\" The accounts were very likely domestic and were \\"mainly supporters of the United Conservative Party (UCP).\\" There was also a second small community with suspicious account creation pattern that were identified as supporters of the national People's Party of Canada. The report concluded that there was \\"no evidence supporting a broad, coordinated campaign to influence the Alberta election.\\" The report noted that \\"domestic actors\\" were \\"emulating\\" \\"tactics used by foreign actors, within the context of provincial elections and that this \\"behaviour will make it increasingly difficult to distinguish national from foreign interference efforts\\" in the upcoming 2019 Canadian federal election on October 21, 2019. =RMM key findings: tactics used to undermine democracy= Undermining social cohesion by using divisive narrative RRM Canada identified a shift from information warfare to narrative competition, in which narratives about divisive issues such as \\"immigration, Muslims in Europe, climate change and liberal vs conservative values\\" are disseminated and amplified across \\"national borders and global political contexts to engage pan-European, regional and international communities.\\" National or international non-state actors would strategically amplify inauthentic, divisive and inflammatory content on topics such as \\"immigration/migration, anti-religious sentiment (Muslim and Jewish), nationalist identity, women‚Äôs health, gender-based harassment and climate change\\". Decontextualizing authentic information In the European Union, RMM data analysis showed that authentic information was \\"de-contextualized\\", \\"manipulated\\" and \\"distorted\\", then used by \\"questionable\\" writers on \\"untrustworthy\\" sites to \\"seed conversations\\", which were then \\"framed using a divisive and inflammatory narrative.\\" These would reference the original authentic source.

Early life  Mor was born and raised in Israel¬¥s multicultural M√©lange. At a young age her French couturier mother taught her the concept of handcrafted design which suited her affinity for the creative realm.  Career  Mor started to pursue a career as a filmmaker and worked as assistant director and producing manager. In 2004 she found her passion in jewelry during a jewelry bench class in New York City¬¥s Jewelry District.  Alexandra Mor (brand)  Mor's pieces are distinguished by details of knife-edged wire and yellow gold interior lining using diamonds and gemstones. Mor launched her brand and first limited-edition collection at the Phillips de Pury auction house in December 2010, and in 2014, launched her first retail jewelry collection at Dorfman Jewelers in Boston. In 2015, Mor debuted a series of pieces created exclusively for the New York City retailer Bergdorf Goodman. Mor's work has been worn on the red carpet by many, including Oprah, Lupita Nyong'o and Mila Kunis. In 2016, after spending a decade working in New York City, Mor moved to the island of Bali in Indonesia.

Sustainable materials and cultural impact  Mor designs jewelry by being inspirited by personal relationship to her clients, by history, femininity and strength. She uses diamonds and colored gemstones set in platinum and 18K gold. After spending a year in Bali, Indonesia, she created a special jewelry line from the seed of Amazonian Taque tree, the botanical alternative to elephant ivory. She was motivated to fabricate a product which looks like elephant ivory to help protect elephants from being robbed of their tusks. The collection features Tagua seeds, black and red Balinese wood, Sumatran pearls and 22 karat yellow gold alongside Mor's signature details of knife-edged wire, gemstones and Diamond melee. In 2017, Mor introduced her collection and concept for using Tagua as a luxury material at Vogue Italia's annual US Protagonist event.

Players may choose from either a male or female trainer, though the female trainer has gained much more popularity courtesy of her being the default trainer in the Super Smash Bros. series, starting with 2014's Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U and returning in 2018's Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.  Concept  The Wii Fit Trainer is a mannequin-like personal trainer. Male and female versions appear in the Wii Fit series, where they assist the player with performing various workouts and yoga poses, as well as often giving encouragement and advice during the sessions. Players can also compete with them in small challenges, such as doing the most push-ups. In the Super Smash Bros. series, this is translated into their moveset, which involves attacks derived from multiple yoga poses and some of the minigames, such as twirling Hula Hoops and heading soccer balls.  Appearances  The Wii Fit Trainer debuted as a personal trainer for players in the 2008 Wii video game Wii Fit. Players could either choose a male or female option. The success of the first game led to the trainers returning for the expanded Wii Fit Plus and the sequel Wii Fit U, now sporting redesigns. The female trainer was revealed at the 2013 E3 convention to be a playable character in the 2014 video game Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U alongside a human villager from the Animal Crossing series and Capcom's Mega Man. Series director Masahiro Sakurai noted that while he expected that people would see no meaning behind the trainer's inclusion, he included her because of his perception of her uniqueness and to surprise people, instead of doing so for \\"cheap novelty.\\" It was later revealed by Sakurai, in commemoration of the release of the trial version of Wii Fit U, that the male trainer would also appear, albeit as an alternate character that shares the female's slot and characteristics. The Wii Fit Trainers were announced to return in the series' next installment Super Smash Bros. Ultimate alongside every fighter that has appeared in the series' history at the 2018 E3 convention. Due to the female trainer's growing popularity, she has made appearances outside of Super Smash Bros., including a cameo in Super Mario Maker as a costume that Mario can don in the Super Mario Bros. theme, a design based on her color scheme that Yarn Yoshi can wear in Yoshi's Woolly World, and a costume based on her attire in One Piece: Super Grand Battle! X.  Reception  According to US Gamer, the female Wii Fit Trainer has gained a cult following their announcement in Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U initially receiving positive attention from people on the Internet as well as skepticism from critics such as PC Magazine's Will Greenwald. Mike Fahey from Kotaku expressed disappointment in the announcement of her inclusion, noting that \\"at least the video is hilarious.\\" Marc Zablotny from Official Nintendo Magazine called her \\"Smash Bros new leading lady. Destructoid's Jordan Devore noted that he had \\"crack[ed] up\\" over their E3 reveal. Several of Kotaku's staff praised her inclusion; Patricia Hernandez wrote that Wii Fit Trainer was one of her favorite characters in Nintendo 3DS and Wii U, citing their uniqueness and charm as factors; Cecilia D'Anastasio said that characters like Wii Fit Trainer were what made the game worth playing; Susana Polo stated that nothing had excited them to buy a Wii U more than Wii Fit Trainer's reveal, due to both the relatively low number of female characters in the series and her experience with the Wii Fit series; and Owen S. Good calling them an inspired choice, later calling their inclusion one of the best character choices for any fighting game. However some on the site expressed their disappointment, such as writer Mike Fahey mocking Nintendo as being out of touch and expressing bemusement at her being in Super Smash Bros. IGN listed Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U along with Wii Fit Trainer's reveal as one of the \\"biggest surprises of 2013\\", with editor Brendan Graeber stating that the audience had \\"a few audible groans\\" and that \\"disappointment gave way to confusion, and ultimately wild cheers as the next character in the Smash Brothers roster was revealed.\\" Polygon ranked her 39th on their list of the most important Super Smash Bros. characters list. = Merchandise = An amiibo of the female Wii Fit Trainer was created as part of the Super Smash Bros. series in a limited capacity, being one of 10 amiibo originally released on November 21, 2014. Hardcore Gamer's Geoff Thew criticized the design of her amiibo due to its flat design and the large chunk of plastic used to hold it up.The amiibo is compatible with multiple games, including Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, Super Mario Maker, One Piece: Super Grand Battle X, and others. It was discontinued alongside Marth and Villager amiibo, with the three had the highest sell-through rate in the United States during their initial release, leading to it becoming a rare collectible following their discontinuation. It was later re-released alongside others to accompany the release of Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.

The expression \\"transcendental poetry\\" was created by the German critic and philosopher Friedrich Schlegel (1772-1829) and also used by the poet and philosopher Friedrich von Hardenberg (1772-1801), also known as Novalis. Transcendental poetry links the literary field to the philosophical one, poetry to thinking, and the critical reflection to the artistic creation..  Origin  The German philosopher Immanuel Kant (1724-1804) used the term \\"transcendental\\" to mean \\"a knowledge which does not directly concern the objects of experience, but which concerns our way of knowing such objects. It is a 'knowledge of our way of knowledge', or 'knowledge of limits and possibility of our knowledge.'\\" The German philosopher Fichte (1762-1814) and then the romantic philosophers Friedrich Schlegel and Novalis found in this kind of self-knowledge the basic principle of the human mind or spirit. \\"They wanted to show the mechanism and essence of the spirit: self-consciousness is the consciousness that the spirit has of its own activity. Since reality is determined, or structured, or even created by our spirit, self-consciousness is consciousness of reality.\\" Romantic philosophers affirmed that reality is created by the activity of the spirit, and in this way it is poetically produced.  Definition  The most famous definition of transcendental poetry is given by Friedrich Schlegel in the Journal Athenaum (1800): \\"There is a poetry whose One and All is the relationship of the ideal and the real: it should thus be called transcendental poetry according to the analogy of the technical language of philosophy. [‚Ä¶] But we should not care for a transcendental philosophy unless it were critical, unless it portrayed the producer along with the product, unless it embraced in its system of transcendental thoughts a characterization of transcendental thinking: in the same way, that poetry which is not infrequently encountered in modern poets should combine those transcendental materials and preliminary exercises for a poetic theory of the creative power with the artistic reflection and beautiful self-mirroring.\\" Friedrich Schlegel writes that transcendental poetry should present the act of artistic creation along with the created work of art. In this way, ‚Äúthis poetry should portray itself with each of its portrayals; everywhere and at the same time, it should be poetry and the poetry of poetry.‚Äù A characteristic of transcendental poetry is the self-reflection so that art ‚Äúin everything that it represents, it must also represent itself.‚Äù As a consequence of that, there is no any precise difference between a work of art and a work of criticism. A transcendental poem should mirror itself and represent its poetical principle. In doing so, a poem is ‚Äúpoetry of poetry‚Äù and a self-conscious, critical production. In this perspective, criticism and artistic self-consciousness are constitutive parts of the creative work. This self-mirroring of the work of art as a reflection on its poetic character is a constitutive element of modern poetic creation, and it also becomes a constitutive element of the work of art.

He was Norway's first government entomologist. Wilhelm Maribo Sch√∏yen is considered one of Norway's most prominent entomologists. He was an avid writer and left behind a large collection of scientific publications. He was the father of the government entomologist Thor Hiorth Sch√∏yen. Entomologist Sch√∏yen was born in Grue, Norway. He graduated from √Ös Higher Agricultural School in 1867. He had also begun medical studies, but he did not finish because of health issues.

He held this position until 1912. Sch√∏yen was a member of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters. He was also present when the Norwegian Entomological Society was founded in 1904. Insect collector During his travels in Norway, Sch√∏yen focused on collecting butterflies. In 1893 he published Fortegnelse over Norges Lepidoptera (Inventory of Norway's Lepidoptera). In addition, he collected mushrooms and several other taxa of insects. These especially included agricultural pests, about which he wrote many popular science articles. His extensive insect collection is kept at the Oslo Zoological Museum today.  Awards and recognitions  Wilhelm Maribo Sch√∏yen was named a knight of the Order of St. Olav in 1915.Norsk landbruksforsking 7 (1993): 138.

The Rubeho Mountains are part of the Eastern Arc Mountains, and are home to a biodiverse community of flora and fauna with large numbers of endemic species. Geography The Rubeho Mountains are a dissected plateau, covering an area of 4636 km¬≤.N. D. Burgess et al. (2007). \\"The biological importance of the Eastern Arc Mountains of Tanzania and Kenya\\". Biological Conservation 134 (2007) pp. 209‚Äì231. The highest peaks in the range are Mangalisa (2,286 m), Mafwemiro (2,152 m) and Ledengombe (1,941 m).BirdLife International (2019) Important Bird Areas factsheet: Rubeho Mountains. Downloaded from http://www.birdlife.org on 12/09/2019. On the south, the steep-sided valley of the Great Ruaha River separates the Rubheho Mountains from the Udzungwa Mountains. On the southeast a narrow gap separates the Rubeho Mountains from Uvidunda Mountains. The Pala Mountains are close to the east, and the Mkata Plain beyond them. The Mkondoa River separates the Rubeho Mountains from the Ukaguru Mountains on the north and northeast. The Wota Mountains, a western outlier of the Rubeho mountains, and East African Plateau lie to the west. Climate The Rubeho Mountains intercept moisture-laden winds from the Indian Ocean, and receive more rainfall than the surrounding lowlands. Most of the rainfall occurs in the November-to-May wet season, although mist and light rain occur at higher elevations during the dry season months. Rainfall is higher on the southern and eastern slopes facing the Indian Ocean, and lower in the mountains' rain shadow to the north and west. Temperatures are cooler at higher elevations.\\"Eastern Arc forests\\". World Wildlife Fund ecoregion profile. Accessed 10 September 2019. Geology The Rubeho Mountains, along with the others in the Eastern Arc, are made up of ancient crystalline Precambrian rocks that were uplifted over millions of years along fault lines. The most recent period of uplift started 30 million years ago, but the fault system and uplift process may be far older. Soils derived from these ancient rocks are not as fertile as the younger volcanic soils of mountains to the north and west. Flora and fauna About thirty million years ago, the area was covered by extensive rainforest. During a cooler and drier period some ten million years ago, the lowland forests were converted to savanna, leaving the mountain ranges as \\"islands\\" where the tropical forests continued to flourish. The long-term persistence of a humid climate and the isolation of each mountain range has led to a great deal of endemism, and a very diverse flora and fauna. The Rubeho and other Eastern Arc mountains have extremely high biodiversity with numerous endemic species (more than 25 percent of the vertebrate species).Newmark, W. D., 2002, Conserving Biodiversity in East African Forests, a Study of the Eastern Arc Mountains. Ecological Studies 155. Springer-Verlag, Berlin, p. 197 The Rubeho Mountains are covered with miombo woodland, montane rainforest, dry montane forest, montane grassland, and Acacia-Commiphora bushlands and thickets. Forests extend from 520 to 2050 meters elevation, and vary in composition and species type with elevation and rainfall. An analysis of satellite images taken between 1999 and 2003 found 464 km¬≤ of the mountains were still covered in evergreen forest. The wetter eastern and southeastern slopes receive more rain from the Indian Ocean and support miombo woodlands at lower elevations, transitional evergreen forests above 520 meters elevation, and montane evergreen forests at higher elevations. Tree species in the montane evergreen forests include Agauria salicifolia, Aphloia theiformis, Bridelia micrantha, Catha edulis, Diospyros whyteana, Halleria lucida, Macaranga kilimandscharica, Maesa lanceolata, Maytenus acuminata, Nuxia congesta, Parinari excelsa, Polyscias fulva, Rapanea melanophloeos, and Xymalos monospora.\\"Rubeho\\". Eastern Arc Mountains Conservation and Education Fund (EAMCEF). Accessed 12 September 2019. On the western slopes of the main plateau, Macaranga kilimandscharica is the predominant tree, forming a 10-15-meter canopy in dry montane forests in valleys at 1,600‚Äì1,700 meters elevation. The drier western and northwestern slopes have Acacia-Commiphora bushlands and thickets at lower elevations, and dry montane forests at higher elevations. The Rubeho warbler (Scepomycter rubehoensis) is a highland songbird endemic to the Rubeho and Uvidunda mountains. Other endemic or near-endemic birds are the Rubeho forest partridge (Xenoperdix obscuratus) and Rubeho akalat (Sheppardia aurantiithorax). Elephants (Loxodonta africana) and Red forest duikers (Cephalophus natalensis) are found in the forests of the eastern plateau. Protected areas and conservation Protected areas include the Ukwiva (54,635 ha), Mafwemiro (3,238 ha) and Mangalisa (4,988 ha) forest reserves. Ukwiva covers the northeastern portion of the main plateau, and includes the mountains' largest block of evergreen montane forest on the eastern slopes, and dry montane forest at 1,600‚Äì1,700 m. Pala Mountain Forest Reserve (108.34 km¬≤)\\"Pala Mountain Forest Reserve\\". Protected Planet.

Mangalisa is a separate mountain block west of the main plateau, north of the Great Ruaha River. Mangalisa forest reserve includes patches of disturbed dry high-elevation semi-evergreen woodland, and Podocarpus-dominated montane forest in the southern part of the reserve. Transport Tanzania's A7 highway skirts the southern end of the mountains, following the Great Ruaha River then turning northeast through the gap between the Rubeho and the Uvidunda mountains. Tanzania Central Line railway skirts the northern end of the mountains, following the Mkondoa River between the Rubeho and the Ukaguru mountains between Dar es Salaam and western Tanzania.

[et al.]. ‚Äì Minsk : BSU Press, 2010. ‚Äì V. 2. ‚Äì P. 233‚Äì242. (in Russian).  Physics of the phenomenon  The troppy effect is a result of the loss of stability of the roller movement along the shaft due to the accumulation of residual wear-fatigue damage at loads exceeding the rolling fatigue limit. The loss of motion stability is characterized by self-excitation of vibrations in the roller / shaft system and is accompanied by elastoplastic deformation of bodies in the contact area. Under certain conditions, it leads to the appearance of an unsteady vibro-shock process with a variable frequency and repeatedly variable contact load. This leads to the formation of residual wave-like damages on the contact surfaces with half-barrel-shaped dimples, the sizes of which in the circumferential, axial and radial directions turn out to be unequal (Figure 1). Sources (cause) of oscillations in three directions are, firstly, distortions of the contact geometry and, secondly, local non-isotropy of the mechanical properties of the material in different contact zones. A significant role is also played by fretting fatigue in the main directions (circumferential and axial) of the contact plane. alt= Among the numerous and diverse phenomena of loss of stability of motion, we can distinguish those in which disturbing motion factors are due to the complex interaction of elements (in the general case of a different nature) of the mechanical system. Such, for example, are flutter and shimmy, the description of which was given in the works of M. V. KeldyshKeldysh, M. V. \\"Shimmy during the movement of the wheel of a three-wheeled chassis\\" / M. V. Keldysh // Selected Works. Mechanics. ‚Äì M .: Nauka, 1985. ‚Äì P. 491‚Äì530. (in Russian).. In addition to the design features of the wing (flutter) and aircraft landing gear (shimmy), their loss of stability during movement occurs as a result of a special kind of interaction either with the air flow (with flutter) or with the ground (with shimmy). Although the phenomenon of troppy is on a par with the phenomena of flutter and shimmy in the complexity of the nature of the interaction, nevertheless, troppy has significant features. Firstly, in the tribo-fatigue system, two solid deformable bodies interact. Secondly, for troppy, the history of movement and loading (damage to the elements of the tribo-fatigue system) is important, which determines the change in the conditions of interaction over time. If during flutter and shimmy the disturbing factors are external to the mechanical system and do not depend on it, then during troppy the disturbing factors are determined by the mechanical parameters of the system, which change during movement and damage. In other words, the inverse effect of motion on disturbing factors is realized.  Troppy effect in real systems  The troppy effect can be regarded as fundamental; in practice, its particular species are found. So, for example, under certain operating conditions of rails and railway wheels, similar irregular damages of both elements are formed, which initiate strong vibrations of the rolling stock, and sometimes the train goes off the railsAlias, J. \\"Characteristics of wave formation in rails\\" / J. Alias // Rail International. ‚Äì 1986. November. ‚Äì P. 17‚Äì23.\\"Combating the roaring-rail by grinding using a mobile train formation\\" // Rail Engineering International. ‚Äì 1972.

Rec. ‚Äì 1986. ‚Äì ‚Ññ 1071. ‚Äì P. 16‚Äì18.. Such damage was found, for example, on the rails of tram lines and railways (Figure 2). The analysis shows that in systems such as tire / road, gears similar damages also occur in severe operating conditions. A peculiar realization of the troppy effect is a forest or meadow path; it is this image that underlies the name of the effect. alt=  Troppy model  The troppy model was developed by Professor S. S. Sherbakov The following representations are the basis of the theoretical solution of the troppy problem: * stresses caused by contact and non-contact loads in the roller / shaft system act simultaneously in a single area; * during the movement, excitation of the oscillations of the roller in the xz, xy planes and along the z axis is possible (Figure 3); * as a result of the loss of stability of motion, the basic parameters of the Hertz contact change: the dimensions of the semiaxes a and b of the contact ellipse, the largest pressure p0 in the center of the contact, the convergence of the Œ¥ axes; * loss of motion stability over time can also be initiated by a change in local mechanical properties on the rolling track; * in the general case, the description of the conditions for the loss of stability of motion takes into account both the action of disturbing force factors and the time variation of the geometric dimensions in the contact area; these changes may result from permanent deformations. alt= The system of equations of motion under conditions of troppy, taking into account the gyroscopic moment, has the form: thumb where Iy, Iz, Iyz respectively, the moments of inertia of the roller relative to the axes y and z and the centrifugal moment, i is the moment of inertia of the roller relative to its axis of rotation, and force factors thumb According to the presented model, the non-stationary process of deformation under the analyzed conditions is accompanied by fluctuations in all contact parameters, as well as contact pressure.  Experimental study  An experimental study of the troppy effect was conducted with the participation of Ph.D. S. A. Tyurin and V. A. YakovlevTyurin, S. A. Mechano-rolling fatigue : research methods and general laws : Ph. D. thesis : 01.02.06 / S. A. Tyurin. ‚Äì Gomel : BelSUT, 2003Yakovlev, V. A.

Tyurin // Modern Problems of Engineering: Materials of the Intern. scientific and technical conf. - Gomel: GSTU named after P.O. Sukhoi, 2000. - V. 1. - P. 177‚Äì179. The troppy effect was experimentally studied in laboratory conditions on SI-series machines when testing tribo-fatigue roller / shaft systems for mechano-rolling fatigue (Figure 4, see the test scheme). In the working zone, both cyclic stresses occur during volumetric deformation (bending by load Q) and the contact stress field under contact load FN. alt= The mechano-rolling fatigue tests were subjected to the tribo-fatigue system steel 25HGT (roller) / steel 45 (shaft). A characteristic feature of this system was that the strength of the shaft metal is significantly less than that of the roller, therefore, during the tests, residual deformations and damage are found only in the vicinity of the roller track on the shaft, while the dimensions of the roller remain almost undistorted. The influence of the manufacturing error of the shaft on the excitation of the troppy is shown in the graphs of Figure 4. For deviations of Œî=10 Œºm, the movement of the roller along the shaft was stable during the entire test period. But if the manufacturing error was Œî=40 Œºm, there was a loss of motion stability (see mark 1 in Figure 4). The development of wave-like residual damage leads to a shock-fatigue process (see mark 2 in Figure 4). This process is unsteady in amplitude and frequency. Consequently, the geometry of the elements and the accuracy in contact are factors that largely form the conditions for the occurrence of residual wave-like damage during mechano-rolling fatigue tests. In the case of an initial local violation of the shaft geometry (flat on its surface ‚Äì see Figure 5), the movement of the roller along the shaft is practically unsteady initially. And this unsteadiness is enhanced due to the residual change in the size of the contact area and the local properties of the material along the rolling track. This is due to the fact that after the jump on the flat, the roller impacts the metal in the vicinity of the next point 2. Next, a similar process of the formation of wave-like damages occurs already in the vicinity of point 3. It turns out that the residual wave-like damage rolls from point to point. When the shock-fatigue process begins, they are formed along the entire length of the rolling track during a very short test time and become deep and wide. alt= The role of the anisotropy of the mechanical properties of the material at different points along the shaft circumference on the excitation of vibrations in the system is shown in Figure 6. The first scan of the shaft circumference without contact load (FN=0) was obtained after 1,129 rotation cycles. Further, the family of such scans is given depending on the values of FN and N (measurements were carried out at six marked points). It is clearly seen that the influence of the anisotropy of the local properties of the metal is detected at FN=100 and 200 H after N=50,000 cycles. alt= Figure 7, a shows photographs of residual surface wave-like damage in the vicinity of the shaft roller track. In the case when the roller and shaft are made of the same steel and have the same surface properties, residual wave-like damages under certain test conditions are formed on the working surfaces of both elements simultaneously (see Figure 7, b). alt= Figure 8 shows that when the troppy effect is realized under the conditions of the experiments, the surface hardness on the rolling track varies from 330 to 450 HV, i.e. by 36 %. And the value of relative plastic deformation reaches 62 %. alt=  References  Friction Category:Tribology ","title":"Troppy effect"},{"id":"61760401","text":"John Arthur Harland Hancock (1923 ‚Äì 7 June 1974) was a British venereologist and editor of the British Journal of Venereal Diseases who wrote on non- gonococcal urethritis and reactive arthritis, what was known as Reiter's disease at the time.

The music is raw, hard-edged, and sharp (the guitars slash and cut), more like a successor to Muddy's classic 1950's sides (he rethinks a bunch '50s numbers here) than to the London Sessions, Super Blues, brass blow-outs, and psychedelic albums that he'd been doing. It's also easy to hear Muddy's heart in this release -- he fairly oozes soul out of every note he sings\\". The Blues Foundation's Jim O'Neil noted \\"Most of Muddy‚Äôs working band, joined by alumnus James Cotton on harp, backed him on a quickly recorded session (Bass preferred live spontaneity to perfected multiple takes when producing blues) that found the master and his crew in fine form, delivering the kind of blues that made Muddy famous back in the 1950s.

In the novel, Gage is an innocent child who is accidentally killed by a speeding tanker truck. Gage's grieving father Louis brings him back to life by burying him in the titular cemetery, which is possessed by a Wendigo. Once reanimated, Gage is controlled by the Wendigo's evil spirit and murders his mother, Rachel, and their neighbor, Jud Crandall. Gage was portrayed in the 1989 film adaptation of the novel by Miko Hughes. He was portrayed in the 2019 remake by twins Hugo and Lucas Lavoie. Gage was also portrayed in a small cameo appearance by his creator, Stephen King, in the 1997 miniseries adaptation of The Shining. Fictional character biography Gage Creed is the 2-year-old son of Louis and Rachel Creed and the younger brother to Ellie Creed. Before his death and eventual resurrection, Gage appears to be a typical toddler. He and his family move to Ludlow, Maine from Chicago, Illinois and become friends with their neighbor Jud Crandall. However, the family notices that their new house is located right next to a freeway and there is a cemetery for animals in their backyard called the \\"Pet Sematary\\". One day, the Creeds and Jud are having a picnic in their yard, and Gage is playing with a kite. The kite begins blowing away and Gage starts chasing it, unaware he is heading into the freeway. His father tries to catch up to him but is too late - Gage is struck and killed by a speeding tanker truck. In his grief, Louis takes his son to the ancient burial ground introduced to him by Jud after their cat, Church, was killed. Louis buries Gage there, and his son is possessed by the spirit of a Wendigo and resurrected. Once Gage returns to life, he murders Jud and calls for his mother to come to him. He then kills his mother and taunts his father. Louis then puts his son out of his misery by injecting him with a lethal dose of morphine. Inspiration and adaptations The original inspiration for the character was King's own son, Owen, who had been stopped from running into the road while flying a kite. The King family was then staying in a spooky house in Orrington, Maine ‚Äì a place which had a real pet cemetery. Gage is portrayed in the 1989 film adaptation by Miko Hughes. While the film itself garnered mixed reviews, Hughes' portrayal of Gage was universally acclaimed for the chilling performance given by such a small child. Two-year old Russell Graves also played the part as a stand-in and double for Hughes. Graves was cast when the film was shot on location in Ellsworth, Maine and appears as Gage in the kite-flying scene. A mannequin was also used to portray the character in scenes after he has been reanimated. In the 2019 remake, Gage was portrayed by twins Hugo and Lucas Lavoie. In this adaptation, Gage and Ellie switch roles; Ellie is killed by the tanker, only to be reanimated as a murderous revenant and try to kill her entire family. Gage ends up being the only assumed survivor of the story, as each member of the Creed family is killed by Ellie and possessed by the Wendigo. The film ends with Gage safely in a car with the possessed Creed family returning to the car, motioning for Gage to unlock the car door. Gage was portrayed in a small cameo appearance by his creator, Stephen King, in the 1997 miniseries adaptation of The Shining. In the cameo, Gage appears as an orchestra conductor during one of Jack Torrance's hallucinations. Reception The death of Gage in King's original novel was described by many at the time as \\"shocking\\" and \\"heartbreaking\\". The character's eventual turn into the primary antagonist of the story led to him being considered as one of the best and creepiest Stephen King characters/villains. The portrayal of the character in the 1989 film by Miko Hughes was widely praised despite the film itself receiving mixed reviews. =Literary analysis= Gage Creed has also been the subject of scholar works discussing what he represents. In Frankenstein's Monster: Hubris and Death in Stephen King's Oeuvre, Strengell draws parallels between Gage Creed and Frankenstein's monster. Both Gage and the Creature suffer the consequences of their father's/creator's hubris when defying God and attempting to create life. The Creature is driven to evil by hardship, whereas Gage has had his soul replaced entirely by evil. According to Bruhm in Nightmare on Sesame Street: or, The Self-Possessed Child, Gage represents the loss of innocence when he is resurrected as a creature wise beyond his years. In theory this is worse than his father's initial fears of bringing back a brain-dead couch potato. Gage might have remained somewhat innocent and free of cultural corruption like Rousseau‚Äôs Emile, but children cannot remain innocent because obtaining knowledge is not only inevitable, but imperative.

Originally a French vessel, she was captured at Calvi on 10 August 1794 and first saw British service in the English Channel, where she helped to contain enemy privateering. In October 1798, she chased a French frigate squadron sent to find the French fleet under Jean-Baptiste-Fran√ßois Bompart, that was routed at the Battle of Tory Island and in August 1799, she joined Andrew Mitchell's squadron for the Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland. In April 1800, Melpomene was active along the coast of Senegal and led a small squadron that captured the island of Gor√©e. She later returned to the Channel where, in July 1804, she took part in a bombardment of Le Havre. For much of 1809, she was employed in the Baltic where she fought in some notable actions during the Gunboat War and the Anglo-Russian War. Construction and armament The French ship Melpom√®ne was built in 1788 at Toulon. A 36-gun frigate of the Minerve Class, she was ordered in 1787 and construction started February the following year. Launched on 6 August 1789, she was completed in April 1792 and armed with twenty-eight long guns on the gundeck and ten on her upperworks.Winfield and Roberts (2015) p. 137 After her capture, her secondary armament was upgraded so she carried eight long guns and six carronades on the quarter deck, and two 9-pounders with two 32-pounder carronades on the forecastle.Winfield (2008) p. 159 The British recorded Melpomene's dimensions as: along the gundeck with a keel length of , a beam of and a depth in the hold of . She was 1,013 tons burthen. French Service In March 1793, Melpom√®ne sailed to Agliers, escorting two xebecs that had undergone refits at Toulon on behalf of Baba Hassan, Dey of Algiers. The next month, she was at Toulon when a mutiny broke out aboard. In October 1793, Melpom√®ne, under Lieutenant Gay, was part of a division also comprising Minerve, Fortun√©e, and the 18-gun Fl√®che. Last in the division, she was chased by the 64-gun HMS Agamemnon in the Action of 22 October 1793. Agamemnon broken the engagement when Minerve came to support Melpom√®ne. In the morning of 11 January 1794, off Calvi, Melpom√®ne detected Mignonne being chased by a British ship of the line and two frigates. She closed to support Mignonne, arriving in gun range at 1145. Mignonne broke the engagement and Melpom√®ne herself escaped by sailing in shallow waters where the British frigates were reluctant to venture. Around 1500, they regrouped around the ship of the line. Melpom√®ne had her lower masts and her foremast tops damaged, and had to be taken in tow to Calvi. British Service In 1794, Melpom√®ne was at Calvi, Corsica, when the entire island was subject to a blockade by a Royal Navy Fleet under Lord Hood. A successful invasion culminated in the capture of the port on 10 August and the seizure of Melpom√®ne and a second French frigate, Mignonne.James (Vol.I) p. 191 During the surrender negotiations, the French asked that they be allowed to keep the frigates to transport the garrison to Toulon but the British refused. Mignonne was deemed unserviceable but Melpomene was put under the command of Charles Patterson and taken to Chatham for refitting. The work cost ¬£6,534 and took until 1 June 1795. She was officially recognised as a British vessel on 30 March 1795 when she was registered by the Admiralty, and was commissioned the following month by Sir Charles Hamilton. She worked to contain privateering and protect British trade in the English Channel. At 15:00 on 11 July 1796, Melpomene was to the south-southwest of Ushant, when a sail was seen to the south-east. After a five-hour chase, Melpomene forced the surrender of the vessel which turned out to be the 18-gun Revanche. The privateer from Brest had been out looking to intercept a convoy from Brazil. The 167 captured crew members were taken to Plymouth. While cruising off the Isle of Wight on 15 May 1797, Melpomene captured Espi√®gle, a small armed-lugger from F√©camp carrying 32 men. On 17 July, she captured another French privateer, Triton. On 3 August 1798, Melpomene was cruising off the north coast of Brittany with when a French brig, Adventurier, and accompanying merchant ships were discovered in the bay of Corr√©jou.James (Vol.II) p. 226 The British decided to attempt a cutting out expedition under cover of darkness and a boarding party from both crews was assembled. At 22:00 that night, in stormy conditions, five boats, carrying 70 men, began a five-hour row towards the bay. At 03:00 they came alongside Adventurier and a struggle ensued in which the French crew of 79 were eventually subdued. The British had one man killed, one missing and four wounded while the French had 16 wounded, several mortally. The bad weather which had helped the attackers remain undetected during their approach became a hindrance as the captured vessel was worked out to sea but, despite having to endure a two-hour bombardment from the shore batteries, no further casualties were suffered.James (Vol.II) p. 227 =Pursuit of Savary= Following a failed French invasion of Ireland in 1798, the Channel Fleet was on high alert and prepared for the next attempt which was made in August. A French fleet sent in support, under Jean-Baptiste-Fran√ßois Bompart, was routed at the Battle of Tory Island on 12 October and a squadron of four frigates under commodore Daniel Savary was sent to escort the survivors back to France.James (Vol.II) pp. 145 ‚Äì 146 Having failed to find any, Savary was returning to France when, on 28 October at 07:00, his squadron was seen off Benwee Head by Melpomene, HMS Terrible, and the flagship of commodore Sir Richard Bickerton, HMS Caesar. The three ships immediately gave chase but due to light winds, it was 18:00 before any ships were close enough to exchange shots. By 23:00, the wind, which had increased considerably, carried away the topmasts of Caesar, leaving Melpomene and Terrible to forge ahead. At 08:00 the next day, the French squadron was away but by noon, Melpomene, some way ahead, had closed the distance to just miles. Fearing his entire squadron would be captured, Savary ordered his ships to scatter.James (Vol.II) p. 146 Hamilton chose to try and intercept the 40-gun Concorde which was away to his south-west but heading south.James (Vol.II) pp. 145 -146 The weather took a turn for the worse during the evening of 30 October and the French managed to escape to Rochefort.James (Vol.II) p. 147 Melpomene continued her crusade against privateering, capturing Tigre on 17 November and the 16-gun Zele in the Bay of Biscay on 28 February following, until she was called to join Andrew Mitchell's squadron for an Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland in August 1799. =Invasion of Holland= A combined fleet under Admiral Lord Duncan, comprising eight ships-of-the-line, three fourth rates and six frigates, one of which was Melpomene, arrived off Texel on 22 August. With it, were more than 230 other craft, carrying supplies and 27,000 troops.Clowes (Vol.IV) pp. 408 ‚Äì 409 After failing to persuade the Dutch to hand over their ships, the troops were landed near Helder on the morning of 27 August. After an engagement with a Franco-Dutch force, the city was captured. At the same time, a single British frigate, , entered the Nieuwe Diep and captured the ships there which were laid up in ordinary. Among them were 13 warships carrying a total of 510 guns, and of these, four small frigates and a 44-gun vessel were added to the Royal Navy.Clowes (Vol.IV) p. 409 Two days later, Mitchell's squadron entered the Vlieter roads where a Dutch squadron under Vice-Admiral Samuel Story was anchored. Three of the frigates, none of which were Melpomene, grounded in the narrow channel, but all managed to get off and join their compatriots in line opposite the Dutch, who accepted an offer to surrender and handed over their ships without a shot being fired on either side.Clowes (Vol.IV) pp. 409 ‚Äì 410 =West Africa= In April 1800, Melpomene and were off the coast of Senegal when word was received of three French frigates moored under the gun batteries on the island of Gor√©e. In need of reinforcements, Hamilton had his ship make for Praia, Cape Verde, where he knew the 64-gun to be revictualing. By the time the squadron arrived at Gor√©e, on 4 April, the French frigates had gone. With that additional protection removed, Hamilton judged that the island was vulnerable and sent a demand for its surrender. Terms were agreed and at midnight, marines from both ships were landed and the island brought under British control. On 13 April, some of the squadron's crew took part in a boat action against a Senegalese trading post, returning on 22 April with a French brigantine and a sloop full of rice. On 17 June, Melpomene chased a 10-gun privateer, off the coast of France, for 57 hours before catching it and forcing it to strike. It turned out to be Auguste with a French crew of 50 men, on the way to Guadeloupe from Bordeaux. On 3 January 1801, five boats from Melpomene crossed a sand bar on the Senegal river to cut-out a French 18-gun brig. As they approached, the brig opened fire sinking two of the British boats but the remainder made it alongside and after a short struggle, succeeded in boarding and capturing her.Clowes (Vol.IV) p. 535 The British boats then attacked an armed schooner, which had sought shelter under a gun battery, but were forced to retreat. While bringing out the brig, she grounded on the bar and had to be abandoned; the British making off in their boats under heavy fire from the shore batteries. The expedition was a costly one for the British, with 11 men killed and 18 wounded out of the 96 who took part. The French brig, Senegal, broke up and sank into the sand.James (Vol.III) p. 132 =Return to home waters= Melpomene needed a small repair in February 1803 which was undertaken at Deptford and took about a month to complete. She was recommissioned in March under Robert Dudley Oliver and operated off the French coast and in the North Sea. In July 1804, Melpomene took part in an attack on the port of Le Havre.James (Vol.III) p. 227 Le Havre was important at the time, harbouring a large number of vessels required by Napoleon's invasion force at Boulogne. Oliver's squadron, comprising Melpomene, sloops, bomb-vessels and other small craft, was stationed off the port to prevent any enemy joining, or those inside, escaping. On 23 July, the British fired on the town, setting it alight and forcing the French to move their ships further upriver. Another attack was made on 1 August resulting in a very similar outcome. Melpomene was at Portsmouth in September 1805. While she was there, Oliver met with Lord Nelson, who was about to leave to resume command off Cadiz. Oliver told of his disappointment that he and his ship were not going too, to which Nelson replied, \\"I hope you will come in time to tow some of the rascals\\"; Melpomene eventually joined Admiral Collingwood's fleet the day after the Battle of Trafalgar and did indeed assist in the aftermath by towing damaged prizes away from the battle site. In December, Peter Parker was appointed as Melpomene's commander, serving in the Mediterranean but returning home at the end of 1807 before leaving for Jamaica in the April following. =Baltic campaign= On 11 May 1809, Melpomene chased a 6-gun cutter off Jutland which entered the harbour of Huilbo and ran ashore. Melpomene anchored and dispatched her boats while providing covering fire. The crew were able to destroy the cutter with an officer, two seamen and three marines wounded in the process.James (Vol.V) p. 179 A picture of the engagement on 23 May 1809 when Melpomene was attacked by 20 Danish gunboats, 23 May 1809 Melpomene was very nearly captured on 23 May 1809, when 20 Danish gunboats found her becalmed in the Great Belt. The British frigate was anchored off Omoe Island when, at around 22:30, the Danes were spotted in the dark. The crew cleared for action and commenced firing at 11:00 but were prevented from bringing their guns to bear in the light wind. Shortly after the action started, the wind increased sufficiently to cut Melpomenes cable and manoeuvre. For several days she attempted to close with the enemy with little success. In the early hours on 30 May, the gunboats withdrew.James (Vol.V) p. 179 Melpomene was much damaged by her encounter and had to return to England for repairs.Clowes (Vol.V) p.438 Melpomene was sent back to the Baltic where she joined a force conducting a search of the southern edge of the Gulf of Finland. At the beginning of July, she was sent by the Commander-in-Chief, Admiral James Saumarez, to cruise east of Nargen Island with . They sailed into Narva Bay and there captured nine vessels laden with timber, spars and cordage, belonging to the Russian Emperor. After searching all the creeks and inlets along the coast but finding nothing else, attention switched to the north side of the Gulf where the boats of Implacable, Melpomene and captured three more vessels among the many islands that fringe Finland. They also discovered eight Russian gunboats, each mounting a 32 and a 24-pounder gun, and carrying a crew of 46 men, protecting a convoy of merchantmen near Hango Head. Determined to capture or destroy as much of the convoy as possible, on 7 July at 21:00, 270 men from Melpomene, and Implacable set off in 17 of the ships' boats.Long p. 237 The Russians had positioned their vessels between two rocks, preventing them from being outflanked and forcing the British to row straight into a hail of grapeshot. The British eventually managed to capture six of the eight gunboats and sink another. All 12 merchant ships were taken and another large armed ship was burned. The British had 17 men killed and 37 wounded during the operation. Five of the dead and six of the wounded were from Melpomene. The Russians lost at least 65 men killed, and 127 taken prisoner, of whom 51 were wounded. The Admiralty later issued a clasp for the Naval General Service Medal for this action. Later service and fate From May to August 1810, Melpomene was at Chatham Dockyard where she was stripped of her carronades and converted to a troopship. She was recommissioned under William Waldegrave and later, in 1812, Gordon Falcon. She served in the Mediterranean until 16 March 1814, when she sailed to North America under Robert Rowley, who had taken command in October the previous year. Melpomene was sold at Sheerness for ¬£2,590 on 14 December 1815.

He also produced drawings and etchings. His output was rather small and his works are widely scattered.  Life and work  In 1867, he became a student at the Grand-Ducal Saxon Art School, Weimar. His primary instructor there was the landscape painter, Max Schmidt. From 1871, he was a Master Student of Professor Theodor Hagen at the Kunstakademie D√ºsseldorf. His instruction included the practice of painting en plein aire, based on the teachings of the Barbizon School. He set up his own studio immediately after completing his studies. He preferred simple pictures, with barren areas or trivial items occupying the center of the canvas. Great attention was given to lighting effects for the appropriate time of day. Most of his works were painted in the area immediately around Weimar, although he also worked in the Harz Mountains and Thuringia. Lovis Corinth was especially attracted to his work and called him a genius. He committed suicide at the age of forty.

Broadcasting as a carrier current AM radio station from 1954 to 1977 and on FM from 1977 to 1988, it was forced to drop its FM broadcasts due to the sign-on of new radio stations that held priority over its 10-watt facility. Today, the station operates online as \\"KJNB\\". History =Carrier current= Student radio at St. John's began in 1954 with the establishment of KSJU as a carrier-current radio station. In 1961, the station's music format eschewed rock and roll, opting for \\"adult college listening\\" and music for \\"study hours\\". The station's operations began to involve students from the College of St. Benedict in 1965, when five girls organized a group to incorporate the associated women's college into the production and broadcast of programming and the provision of news stories from St. Benedict into KSJU newscasts. 1970 brought KSJU a direct connection to United Press International teletype. =On the FM dial, frequency changes and cable FM= St. John's applied for a construction permit for a new FM station in 1975. After receiving the permit in 1976, the station began transmitting on 89.1 FM for the 1977‚Äì78 school year, with a transmitter on Nequette Hill near the St. John's campus. The move to FM brought with it a doubling of KSJU's hours of operation. It marked the return of St. Johns to the FM dial, after having spun off public radio station KSJR-FM, which became the core of today's Minnesota Public Radio. (MPR celebrated its 25th anniversary in 1992 by broadcasting from the university's studios.) In April 1979, the station held a 70-hour marathon to raise the money necessary to convert to stereo broadcasting. KSJU was, for its entire existence as an FM broadcast station, a Class D station. Broadcasting with 10 watts, this made it a secondary service to other, \\"full-service\\" radio stations. In the summer of 1984, KSJU relocated from 89.1 to 96.5 MHz, a move forced by the recent opening of applications for the 88.9 frequency, which became KNSR. The frequency change cost $7,000; at the same time, the station was displaced from its auditorium studios by renovations, settling in Mary Hall. The station operated on 96.5 for four years before another radio station bumped it off the dial: new station KKSR in Sartell, operating on 96.7 MHz. Though the university said it would look into the process of obtaining a new radio station license, this never occurred, with St. John's deciding to let the license lapse; instead, in an arrangement intended to be temporary, KSJU was placed as a cable FM channel on the local cable system, beginning December 1, 1988. The arrangement, however, carried a major drawback: the station was no longer listenable at St. Benedict and remained so for years, even though CSB students paid activity fees that supported its operations. In 1993, KSJU became \\"KJNB\\" ( _J_ ohnnies a _N_ d _B_ ), reflecting its return to St. Benedict and in preparation for an attempt to return to the air with MPR backing. In 2000, another effort was made to return to the FM dial when the university filed for a low-power FM station. Low-power station applications were not initially required to protect stations on third-adjacent FM channels, but a law change in December 2000‚Äîafter the original filing‚Äîrequired them to do so; after a remedial window, applicants for 484 proposed stations, including SJU, failed to modify their applications to address this deficiency, resulting in the dismissal of their applications in March 2003.

Some of them may have been among victims of the Zambr√≥w massacre. The Zambr√≥w massacre was a war crime that took place on the night of 13‚Äì14 September 1939. It was one of the major war crimes of the Wehrmacht during the invasion of Poland. During that night, the makeshift prisoner-of-war camp in Zambr√≥w was disturbed by a number of panicked horses, and more than 200 Polish soldiers, trying to move out of their way, were gunned down by German sentries.Tomasz Sudo≈Ç, ZBRODNIE WEHRMACHTU NA JE≈ÉCACH POLSKICH WE WRZE≈öNIU 1939 ROKU, Biuro Edukacji Publicznej IPN Some witnesses later said the horses had been purposely released into the camp by the German sentries, who used the incident as a pretext to massacre the prisoners. Background =Tactical situation= The , lasting from 11 to 13 September 1939, involved units of Polish General Czes≈Çaw M≈Çot-Fija≈Çkowski's Special Operation Group \\"Narew\\", particularly the Polish 18th Infantry Division under command of Colonel Stefan Kossecki, facing an offensive by the German XIX Army Corps under General Heinz Guderian and the XXI Army Corps under General Nikolaus von Falkenhorst. The Polish forces were pushed back, and in the process the 18th Infantry Division sustained heavy losses and was effectively destroyed, with several thousands soldiers being taken prisoner-of-war. =Context of German war crimes= During the 1939 invasion of Poland, Germany's Wehrmacht committed a number of war crimes, including several prisoner-of-war massacres. Reasons for the prisoner-of-war massacres, suggested by historians, include contempt for Poles and Polish soldiers, encouraged by Nazi propaganda, which described them as German-hating Untermenschen; and lack of preparation, resources, and will to secure surrendered Polish soldiers. However, many other western historians point to plans formulated by the German General Staff, prior to the invasion, which authorized the SS to carry out security tasks on behalf of the army that included the imprisonment or execution of Polish citizens, whether Jewish or gentile. On 19 September, shortly after the onset of hostilities, Franz Halder, Chief of the German General Staff, noted in his diary that he had received information from Reinhard Heydrich. The SS were beginning their campaign to \\"clean house\\" in Poland of Jews, intelligentsia, Catholic clergy, and the aristocracy. Halder was aware of the murders but did not object. He dismissed the crimes as aberrations and refused one general's request to pursue the SS and police perpetrators. Further, German officers often treated Polish soldiers of disorganized units captured behind German lines as partisans, not as regular soldiers, and felt justified in ordering their summary execution. This led to several dozen executions of groups of Polish soldiers, in addition to a hard-to-estimate number of murders of individual soldiers. In addition to the Zambr√≥w event, there were other instances when German military units killed Polish prisoners of war. They include those at Ciepiel√≥w (the Ciepiel√≥w massacre, estimated at 250 or more fatalities), Katowice (the Katowice massacre, some 80 fatalities), Majdan Wielki (the , some 42 fatalities), Serock (the , some 80 fatalities), Sochaczew (the Sochaczew massacre, some 50 fatalities), Szczucin (the , some 40 fatalities), and Zakroczym (the Massacre in Zakroczym, some 60 fatalities). The Soviets, who also occupied portions of Poland during this period, undertook the systematic mass executions of Polish military officers and intelligentsia on an even greater scale. Of the estimated 22,000 prisoners murdered in the Katyn forest in Russia, about 8,000 were Polish military officers imprisoned during the 1939 Soviet invasion of Poland, another 6,000 were police officers, and the rest were Polish intelligentsia. The massacre By 13 September 1939, the makeshift prisoner-of-war camp in Zambr√≥w, at the garrison buildings of the , held 4,000 to 5,000 Polish prisoners of war. Kept next to the camp were some horses. The German guard detail had been reinforced with a number of cars mounted with machine guns. On the night of 13‚Äì14 September 1939 the German sentries issued an extra warning, stating that any prisoners who moved during the night would be shot. Later that night, some panicked horses made their way into the camp; and when Polish soldiers tried to move out of their way to avoid being trampled, German sentries opened fire. The camp was sprayed with machine-gun and small-arms fire for about 10 minutes, until some German soldiers were struck by friendly fire. The Polish soldiers were still not allowed to move; even requests of help for the wounded were denied. At daybreak, the count showed some 200 Polish fatalities and 100 wounded (another estimate gave the number of fatalities as 250).Shmuel Krakowski. The Fate of Jewish Prisoners of War in the September 1939 Campaign, yadvashem Many witnesses among the prisoners of war believed the incident had been created on purpose by the German sentries, the horses panicking on being blinded by the sentries' searchlights. The Zambr√≥w massacre was one of the worst German war crimes of this type during the September 1939 invasion of Poland.

By the late 20th century, the house had fallen into dereliction, prior to its rescue in 1994‚Äì95. In the 21st century it has been the site for a number of major planning applications, for housing and for a retirement village. A privately owned property, Grove Farm House is a Grade II* listed building. History Historically, the house was the site of the mansion of Beilli-du, the home of Dafydd Gam's brother, Hywel y Coed. In the 18th century, the house was doubled in size, and extensively remodelled internally. By the late 20th century, the house was derelict but was \\"carefully restored\\" in 1994‚Äì95. In the 21st century, major development proposals have been made for the site, originally for a retirement village, and subsequently for housing. Architecture and description Little of the medieval fabric of the farmhouse remains. The architectural historian John Newman dates the earliest part of the building, the east range, to the late 16th century. In the 18th century, major rebuilding took place, to create the present two-storey structure, with slate roofs and stone chimney stacks. The interior contains much mid-18th century decorative work, including a staircase, Neoclassical chimneypieces, and plasterwork.

Habitat These insects occurs in dry grasslands and warm open areas. Description Dictyophara europaea var. rosea Dictyophara europaea can reach a body length of about . These planthoppers have an ovoidal light green body and a conical head extended forward with two strong longitudinal keels and a middle keel converging to the tip. Also the pronotum shows a middle keel and two lateral keels. The forewings are about the same size as the hind wings. Wings are transparent (hyaline) with rich green veining. The distal part of the fore wings has a network formed by the veins. The larvae are similar to the imago in color, shape and head shape.Zhi-Shun Song & Ai-Piing Liang (2008): The Palaearctic Planthopper Genus Dictyophara Germar, 1833 (Hemiptera: Fulgoroidea: Dictyopharidae) in China.

Hala-Bala Wildlife Sanctuary () is a wildlife sanctuary in Thailand, considered to be one of the richest forests of Thailand in the southernmost part of the country. It is dubbed \\"Amazon of Asean\\". It was officially established in 1996. Its area is about 270,725 rais (about 167.244 mi2) which covers the area of Titiwangsa Range and is adjacent to Belum-Temengor Reserve of Malaysia. The Hala-Bala Wildlife Sanctuary is a preserved forest comprising two forestland: Hala forest in Betong district in Yala province and Chanae district in Narathiwat province, with Bala forest in Waeng and Sukhirin districts in Narathiwat province. Interestingly, its name can be altered. For Waeng people, it is called \\"Bala-Hala\\", but for locals in Betong, it is called \\"Hala-Bala\\". The forest was named after Khlong Bala, a natural khlong (canal) that flows into the Bang Lang Reservoir in Yala, which is a large stream originating from a tropical rainforest with tributaries from the Hala Mountaintop. It features a watershed forest situated in the deep forest adjacent to the Malaysian border and is home to various wild animals. Rare preserved wild animals have been traced as a variety of hornbill species have been covered. Seasonally, flocks of a hundred to a thousand hornbills are found in the area. In particular, there are large and small flocks of plain- pouched hornbill (Rhyticeros subruficollis) annually migrating from the Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary in central and western regions to this area in May, which number about 500 or more in total. Hala-Bala is also a habitat of up to 10 hornbills from a total of 13 species found in Thailand, such as rhinoceros hornbill (Buceros rhinoceros) that can be closely seen along the Ban To Mo-Ban Bala route, including rare species helmeted hornbill (Rhinoplax vigil) as well. Also, large wild animals like gaurs (Bos gaurus) are often found in the grassland by Khlong Bala. All of these point that the Hala forest is a complete tropical rainforest that is enriched by plants, wildlife, and a variety of bird species including biodiversity, which maintain the balance of nature in this forest. In the part of rare plants that can be found in this forest, for example golden leaved liana, or locally called Yan Da-o (Bauhinia aureifolia), an endemic plant in Thailand found only in Narathiwat, Yala, and Pattani provinces. Maha Sadam (Cyathea podophylla), a kind of fern, used to be food of dinosaurs that can make feels like returning to a primeval forest, and is a home of largest baing tree (Tetrameles nudiflora) in Thailand as well.

In the 1940s her family joined the resistance but soon after both her parents were deported. While her father died in deportation, her mother was repatriated.Translation by Bernard O'Connor, Jeannette Guyot‚Äôs Biography Le Plan Sussex, 1944. Jeannette Guyot's first involvement in a clandestine network involved exfiltrating agents and civilians to the free zone. Soon after, in 1941 she became a liaison officer for Gilbert Renault. In 1942 she was arrested and sent to prison for three months. The Germans could prove no charges against her and she was set free.

He was also asked by the king Charles II of Naples to lead the destruction of the last Islamic stronghold of the Kingdom of Naples, i.e. the city of Lucera, and the killing or enslavement of the last Muslim community of Southern Italy (1300).

The firm was founded by George Christian Gebelein (November 6, 1878 ‚Äì January 25, 1945), who was born in W√ºstenselbitz, Bavaria, and emigrated to Somerville, Massachusetts, with his family as an infant. There his father found work as a sausage maker. Gebelein's education ended when he completed grammar school in 1893. He started work at the Washington Mills Company but soon left to apprentice from 1893-1897 as a silversmith at the Boston firm of Goodnow & Jenks. The firm's principal designer, Barton Pickering Jenks, was a master member of Boston's Society of Arts and Crafts, and the contemporary Arts and Crafts movement strongly influenced Gebelein. When he became a journeyman in 1897, he joined the Tiffany & Co. factory in Forest Hill, New Jersey, where he stayed for slightly over two years. In 1900 he moved to Concord, New Hampshire, to work at the William B. Durgin Company, and in 1902 moved back to the Boston area, where he rented a workbench at The Handicraft Shop, a small cooperative venture operated by the Society of Arts and Crafts. There he received a number of commissions and in 1906 began marking his pieces with his name. In 1909 Gebelein opened his own shop at 79 Chestnut Street in Boston's Beacon Hill. Gebelein Silversmiths began by creating handcrafted silver items on commission and continued to produce fine custom work through Gebelein's lifetime. In addition, however, it produced a large quantity of mechanically spun silver, which was then made to appear hand-crafted by decorative engravings and small hammer marks. Around 1921 the firm started retailing products made by Gorham, Reed & Barton, Currier & Roby, and the International Silver Company. In the 1920s to mid-1940s, Gebelein also made and sold copper bowls, and during the Great Depression, retailed popular Art Deco chrome pieces manufactured by Chase Brass and Copper Company. Gebelein also bought and sold antique silver. His careful studies of Colonial silver, knowledge of fabrication techniques, and skill as a craftsman made him an expert in identifying forgeries and creating high-quality reproductions. At the time of Gobelein's death, the firm was Boston's last silver handcraft shop. His family continued the business, which shifted during the 1950s to become solely a buyer and seller of antique silver. It remained at 79 Chestnut Street until 1968 when it moved to 286 Newbury Street. Eventually the family sold the name to an antiques dealer. Gebelein Silversmiths is known for its church commissions. Its first major commission was an altar set for Grace Church (Providence, Rhode Island) in 1912. He also made communion sets for the United States Military Academy at West Point, King's Chapel and St. Peter's Church in Boston, and the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia, and two large ciboria that were presented to the National Cathedral in Washington, DC, in 1934. The firm also created the Alexander Agassiz Cup for the inter-house rowing championship at Harvard in 1931; the Percy D. Haughton Memorial Cup for the Tennis and Racquet Club of Boston; the Halcyon and Shattuck Trophy for St. Paul's School in Concord, New Hampshire; and the \\"Guild Cup\\" commissioned by the town of Marblehead, Massachusetts, in 1937 for the America's Cup Yacht Race. Other important commissions were tea and coffee service for the USS Lexington in 1928, the restoration of the Williamsburg Mace for the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation in 1941.

The company primarily produces gold and nickel, and is the largest producer of nickel in Indonesia. Until 2017, Antam was a directly state-owned company, before its ownership was transferred to PT Indonesia Asahan Aluminium (Persero) (Inalum), a government-owned holding company. History Antam was established in 1968 by the Indonesian government under Suharto by merging multiple state-owned mining companies. It became a limited company in 1974, and began listing in the Jakarta Stock Exchange in 1997. In 2017, its ownership was transferred from the Indonesian government (which controlled 65 percent of the company's shares) to Inalum in a move intended to create a national holding company. Due to a government ban on the export of unprocessed ores, Antam has began construction of smelter facilities for ferronickel and alumina. In 2020, it was announced that Antam would form a joint venture with Pertamina and PLN to form an electric vehicle battery company, to be dubbed Indonesia Baterai. Antam's position in the venture is as a provider of upstream raw materials and metals. There are plans for the company to partner with Contemporary Amperex Technology and LG Chem in two projects worth US$ 12 billion. Operations As of 2015, Antam was a producer of bauxite, ferronickel, gold, nickel and silver. It is Indonesia's largest producer of nickel, and it lost considerable amounts of revenue and profits following a nickel ore ban. Antam's gold operations was the primary contributor of the company's revenue, making up 71 percent of its Q1 2018 revenue. Antam is the only Indonesian gold refiner to be accredited by the London Bullion Market Association.

Insprucker (born October 7, 1956) is an American aerospace engineer and retired Air Force colonel currently working at SpaceX as a Principal Integration Engineer. He is honored on the National Air and Space Museum's Wall of Honor. In 1978, at age 22, Insprucker joined the U.S. Air Force Reserve Officers Training Corps program at the University of Michigan. He spent his entire career dedicated to space launch operations, space rocket development and spacecraft development and deployment, even doing a five-year service between 2000 and 2005 at Vandenberg Air Force Base Space Launch Complex-4, which is currently being leased out to SpaceX.  Career at Vandenberg Air Force Base  John Insprucker began serving at Vandenberg in 1980 as a pad, payload and rocket technician. During his first five years he helped with the success of 17 Titan NIB and IIID/34D launches and 9 Agena upper stages. He then went to join the Secretary of the Air Force's Special Project Office as head of the Spacecraft Attitude control division. During this time he participated in developing the software used for reconnaissance satellites for the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), where he was commended for saving a damaged satellite from an Attitude Control System (ACS) failure. Whilst working with the NRO, Insprucker led a 60-person department to manufacture a $2.5 billion NRO Space system. He also served as a program manager for a $700M follow-on satellite. Between 2000 and 2005, he was stationed at Vandenberg Air Force Base where he successfully launched 11 Titan II and Titan IVB rockets first as the Deputy PM from 2000 to 2002, and then as commander of the Titan program from 2003 to 2004. On August 13, 2003, a Titan IVB at Cape Canaveral Launch Complex 40 suffered a nitrogen tetroxide leak caused by faulty fuel pump. Insprucker announced on October 3, 2003, that leak was result of a malfunction with the propellant pump and not an issue related to the Lockheed Martin propellant team. From December 13, 2003 through to November 30, 2005, he led the operation of the Delta IV and Atlas V rockets. During this time, he was the director for the inaugural flight of the Delta IV Heavy, which at the time was the most powerful, active rocket.  Work at SpaceX  On 27 November 2006, John Insprucker extended his part-time contract at SpaceX to a full-time contract where Elon Musk entrusted him to oversee the development of the Falcon 9. Musk stated that John Insprucker would not be involved with lobbying the US Air Force to purchase flights on SpaceX rockets. John currently holds the position as a Principal Integration Engineer at SpaceX. Insprucker has in the past and continues to occasionally comes on to host SpaceX webcasts. John Insprucker mainly hosts webcasts of historic SpaceX launches such as COTS-2 (first private spacecraft to dock to the ISS), First re-flight of a rocket (SES-10), Falcon Heavy Demo Flight, Dragon In-Flight abort test, and Demo-2 (first crewed SpaceX launch). According to SpaceX fans, John Insprucker is considered by popular opinion to the best SpaceX webcast host, receiving high appraisal from space flight reporters and Elon Musk. Fans consider him a great host due to 'being an absolute professional who knows what he's doing.' 'He delivers information in a very steady and comprehensive manner while making far fewer mistakes than other hosts.'

It is one of the Boulevards of the Marshals that run in the outer parts of the city.  Description  The boulevard Soult runs from avenue Daumesnil at to Porte de Vincennes, where it is continued by boulevard Davout. Boulevard Soult was accessible through the Petite Ceinture bus line. It can now be reached through the tramway Line 3 (Porte de Vincennes, Alexandra David-N√©el, Montempoivre, Porte Dor√©e stations), the M√©tro Line 1 (Porte Dor√©e station), as well as RATP bus lines 29, 46, 56, 86 and 351. History autoroute. The French war department had completed the Thiers wallincluding fortifications, a dry moat, a Rue Militaire and a large bermaround 1840. In 1859, the military engineering service gave conditional control to the Paris city council. The expansion of the land area of Paris in 1860, by annexing bordering communities, created a situation where everything within the Thiers wall was Paris and everything without was not. The Thiers wall, with its accompanying berm and moat, led to a profound disruption and complication of the synergistic relationship between Paris and its suburbs. Paris city council started upgrading and conversion of some sections of the Rue Militaire into boulevards in 1861, with the (yet unnamed) Boulevard Soult one of the first stretches to open. In 1864, the boulevard was named after Jean-de-Dieu Soult (1769‚Äì1851), 1st Duke of Dalmatia and Marshal of France. Each section was named for a marshal of the First French Empire (1804‚Äì1814) who served under Napoleon I, leading to the entire ring being collectively called the Boulevards of the Marshals. The Boulevards of the Marshals concept was almost fully realized by 1932, though the final three sections, closing the ring, would not be completed until 2005. Of the 22 boulevards, 19 have been named for Soult or one of his fellow First Empire marshals. In the 1930s, HBM-type social housings were built at La Zone to accommodate working-class people that have come through rural flight after WW1. These buildings stretch along a large part of boulevard Soult, on the outer side between and Porte de Vincennes. On September 22, 2008, a fire killed a resident and devastated a building at No. 64 boulevard Soult at Porte de Saint-Mand√©. Since December 2012, a new section of the tramway Line 3 has been running on boulevard Soult.  Notable buildings and landmarks  * At no. 27, there was a 16-meter-high and 2.20-meter-circumferential European nettle tree planted in 1906 and classified as a \\"remarkable tree\\".

Development  =Origin= In 2009, a Mark 2 was sanctioned as an improvement over Tejas Mark 1 while the current General Electric F404 engine employed by Tejas was to be replaced by a more powerful engine. To meet the IAF's air staff qualitative requirements (ASQR), over time ADA had to make substantial changes to the basic Mk 1/Mk 1A air-frame to improve payload and performance. Initially, it was planned to simply elongate the Tejas Mark 1 with a 0.5 m fuselage plug to accommodate more fuel, while fitting a more powerful engine with 65-100 kN of thrust. But soon it was determined that this elongation of the air frame generated substantial amount of additional drag. Alongside that the IAF demanded at least 18 degrees per second sustained turn rate . To tackle that several years of design refinement followed to improve aerodynamic performance and payload. Development of MWF was envisioned only in 2014-15 period and configuration optimization studies commenced by ADA in November 2016 . Its whole platform was so drastically modified that the previous Mark 2 design concept, which was just a re-engined Mark1 air frame with fuselage plug, was discarded to transform the platform to be classified as a Medium-weight class aircraft. A final configuration was worked out in September 2018 and its basic design was frozen in December. At Bangalore in Aero India 2019, a latest version of the originally LCA Tejas Mark 2, now formally rechristened the Medium Weight Fighter, was unveiled for the first time. The aircraft entered detailed design phase after that during early months of 2020 . Metal-cutting is set to begin in April 2021, while long lead activities towards metal cutting (like, procurement of raw material) have already begun. The ‚Äòroll out‚Äô of first prototype of the MWF is scheduled for August 2022 with its first flight expected in September 2023. A total of four prototypes are being planned initially.. For the powerplant, the General Electric F414 and Eurojet EJ200 were evaluated. In October 2010, GE F414 was selected as the lowest bidder. The final deal for 99 aeroengines worth $822 million was signed by January 2013. As per the agreement, eight engines were be bought off-the-shelf, while other 91 built in India under transfer-of- technology. = MWF Programme = While the original Tejas Mark 2 concept was merely an upgrade over the Tejas Mark 1, the MWF is a whole new aircraft developed based on it to complete the need of Indian airforce as MMRCA2.0 was scrapped earlier. The most distinguishable external features of the new jet includes retractable air-to-air refueling probe against fixed one in Mark 1 FOC, close-coupled canards, increased number of weapon stations from 7 to 11. Other minor changes include a modified spine, air-intakes, canopy shape etc. and added hardpoints on wing-tips while its cannon is now mounted at the right wing-root. . MWF is also to feature an indigenous integrated life support system-onboard oxygen generation system (ILSS-OBOGS) from Defence Bioengineering and Electromedical Laboratory (DEBEL), aircraft health and usage monitoring system (HUMS) to integrate various sensors onboard Tejas Mark 2 from Defence Institute of Advanced Technology (DIAT) and a built-in integrated electro-optic electronic warfare suite among other improvements to avionics. It will have an infra-red search and track (IRST) system and a missile approach warning system (MAWS). An increase in payload capacity to and internal fuel capacity to , will allow it to carry more weapons for longer range .

As per the agreement, eight engines were be bought off-the-shelf, while other 91 built in India under transfer-of-technology.  Design  Other than design commonalities very little major technologies has been forwarded from its predecessor Tejas Mk1/A. Instead more of its technologies are to be borrowed from whatever has been developed for the 5th Generation fighter jet program of India, AMCA. Several radar cross-section reducing measures will be incorporated in the airframe design so that a degree of frontal stealth can be achieved, including Radar-absorbent material coating and composites making up its skin, twisted air-intake ducts . = Propulsion = In 2008, it was announced that an in-production powerplant would have to be selected; this was required to be in the 95 to 100 kilonewton (kN) (21,000‚Äì23,000 lbf) range to execute combat manoeuvres with optimal weapons load.Sharma, Ravi. \\"Kaveri engine programme delinked from the Tejas.\\" The Hindu, (Chennai, India), 27 September 2008. Retrieved 29 May 2012. Raghuvanshi, Vivek. \\"Eurojet Bolsters Engine Offer for India's LCA.\\" Defense News, 4 January 2010. Retrieved 29 May 2012. After evaluation and acceptance of technical offers for both the Eurojet EJ200 and the General Electric F414, the commercial quotes were compared in detail and GE's F414 was declared as the lowest bidder. The deal covered the purchase of 99 GE F414 engines, an initial batch will be supplied directly by GE and the remainder to be manufactured in India under a technology transfer arrangement.Shukla, Ajai. \\"American engine to power LCA.\\" Bharat-Rakshak.com, 1 October 2010. Retrieved 30 May 2012. \\"India picks GE's F414 for Tejas MkII fighter.\\" Flight International, 1 October 2010. Retrieved 30 May 2012. According to the IAF, adopting the new powerplant required a three-to-four years of redesign work. In October 2010, General Electric F414 was selected as engine for Tejas Mk 2. The final contract for 99 aeroengines worth $822 million was signed in late 2012 or early 2013 with an option for 49 more that could be exercised later. As per the agreement, eight engines will be bought off-the-shelf, while other 91 will be built in India under transfer of technology. The F414-GE-INS6 has dry thrust of 12,994 lbf (58 kN) and 22,000 lbf (98 kN) of wet thrust. F414-GE-INS6 features a Full Authority Digital Electronic Control (FADEC) system. MWF will have increased internal fuel capacity of 3.3 tonnes, while canards create some drag, the overall aerodynamic and fuel-capacity improvements ensures a range double than that of the Tejas. = Sensors and avionics = The aircraft will be equipped with a multi-sensor data fusion system which will feature an active electronically scanned array radar, infrared search and track and a missile approach warning system. It will also feature an internalized integrated electronic warfare suite. The aircraft will be designed to have network-centric warfare capacity. ADA is planning to integrate Uttam AESA radar on Tejas Mk 2 in collaboration with Electronics and Radar Development Establishment (LRDE). Indian variant of Rafales are to sport Thales X-Guard fiber-optic towed decoy system and Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS), which may be carried over to the MWF. . = Cockpit = MWF cockpit mockup at Defexpo 2020 Large Area Display. Medium Weight Fighter's cockpit is to have a next-generation Wide Area Multifunction Display, and side-mounted control stick. The aircraft is planned to be equipped with an artificial intelligence based ‚Äúoptimally manned‚Äù cockpit. The cockpit will be designed such that the ground control would be able to takeover the controls of the aircraft in case the pilot becomes unconscious, after being alerted by a sensor in the helmet of the pilot.

It was formed in July 1940, and was assigned to the 8th Division, but was later reassigned to the 9th Division. With this formation, the regiment took part in the Siege of Tobruk in 1941 and then the First and Second Battles of El Alamein in 1942. After returning to Australia in early 1943, the regiment became a corps- assigned unit, and its individual batteries served in New Guinea in 1943‚Äì1944, and then Borneo against the Japanese in 1945. History =Formation and service in North Africa= The 2/3rd Anti-Tank Regiment was formed in July 1940 at Warwick Farm, New South Wales, as part of the all volunteer Second Australian Imperial Force that was raised for overseas service during World War II. The regiment was assigned to the 8th Division on formation but it was later transferred to the 9th Division; its first commanding officer was Lieutenant Colonel Eoin Munro. It initially consisted of four batteries ‚Äì the 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th ‚Äì and like other such units raised at this time, had an authorised strength of 30 officers and 526 soldiers, and forty-eight Ordnance QF 2-pounder guns, although it did not initially receive these weapons and initial training was undertaken using simulated weapons. In September, the regiment moved to Ingleburn, New South Wales, before embarking for the Middle East in November, arriving the following month. Further training was undertaken at Julis, in Palestine. In February ‚Äì March 1941, the regiment joined the rest of the 9th Division; the regiment was sent to Amiriya in Egypt, where they were hastily issued with a mix of weapons including captured Solothurn anti-tank rifles, Italian 47 mm guns, and 37 mm Bofors guns. Amidst the chaos and confusion of the German offensive in Cyrenaica, the regiment was dispersed across several locations ‚Äì the 9th Battery garrisoned the port of Tobruk, while the 12th remained on the Egyptian border. The 11th Battery, and regimental headquarters, was allocated to support the 3rd Indian Motor Brigade at Mechili, where they were heavily engaged over three days in early April. After the town was surrounded by German armoured forces, the force attempted to break out and withdraw back to Tobruk. Some was eventually captured; the regiment lost 91 men captured, including Munro, as well as four others killed and seven wounded. The remnants of the regiment, then under the command of Major Henry Glover, concentrated around Tobruk where the 9th Battery joined them as the town fell under siege. New 2-pounder guns were issued, and the regiment assumed command of several infantry anti-tank companies (the 20th and 24th). They were heavily engaged over Easter, as the Germans launched a heavy armoured assault against the perimeter. Meanwhile, the 12th Battery was cut off from the regiment, and was assigned to the 22nd Guards Brigade carrying out defensive actions around the frontier, before being transferred to support the 7th Armoured Division. In August, the battery deployed to Mersa Matruh, rejoining the Australian 9th Division. The rest of the regiment remained in Tobruk until September, taking part in the defence of the town before being relieved by a British unit, and withdrawn by sea back to Palestine. Its losses during the siege amounted to 11 killed, 39 wounded and 96 captured. 6-pounder gun and vehicle, 2/3rd Anti-Tank Regiment, August 1942 Following withdrawal from Tobruk, the regiment was reformed at Hill 95 before moving to Qastina Camp to rejoin the rest of the 9th Division. It was expanded to a 64-gun regiment, and absorbed several anti-tank companies at this time. They deployed to Syria in January 1942, undertaking defensive duties around Tripoli as part of the Allied occupation force, remaining there until June 1942 when they were recalled to Egypt after the Germans launched an offensive. By July, the regiment was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel J.F. Herbertson; the 2-pounders were replaced by 6-pounders around this time. Detaching a battery to support each of the 9th Division's three infantry brigades, over the course of several months the regiment took part in defensive fighting during the First Battle of El Alamein. Casualties throughout July amounted to 23 killed, 80 wounded and 46 captured. Later, during October and November, the regiment supported the offensive actions of the Second Battle of El Alamein, during which the 9th Division carried out attacks towards the coast, before the Allied breakthrough in early November. The 2/3rd Anti-Tank Regiment fired 1,276 rounds during 13 days of heavy fighting, during which 36 guns were destroyed. =Service in New Guinea and Borneo= In December, the regiment was withdrawn back to Palestine, at which time preparations began for the 9th Division to return to Australia, where they were to join the other 2nd AIF divisions fighting the Japanese. Embarking in January 1943, the regiment returned to Australia by sea, and reached Sydney the following month. A period of leave followed, before the regiment was reconstituted at Kairi, Queensland; around this time it was re-designated the 2/3rd Tank Attack Regiment. As the Australian Army was reorganised for the fighting in the Pacific, it adopted the jungle division establishment. This saw a reduction in the number of anti- tank batteries assigned to each division to one, as the armoured threat was considered low in the Australian Army's area of operations in the Pacific; as a result the regiment became a corps asset, assigned to I Corps. The 9th Battery was subsequently assigned to the 4th Division, and was transferred out of the regiment, moving to Townsville, Queensland, while the 12th Battery was temporarily assigned to the 6th Division. 2/3rd Anti-Tank Regiment gun, New Guinea, November 1943 The 10th Battery deployed to New Guinea in July, initially with a view to provide support during the advance through the Markham Valley; however, the lack of Japanese armour meant they remained around Port Moresby and were used in a defensive role, and undertook manual labour until returning to Australia in April 1944. Meanwhile, in September 1943, the 11th Battery was detached for the landing at Lae, supporting the 9th Division. Later, it deployed to support the 20th Brigade around Scarlet Beach during operations to secure Finschaffen, manning defensive positions along the beach, before returning to Australia in March 1944. In May 1944, the regiment was reconstituted, with the 10th and 11th Batteries rejoining regimental headquarters at Mapee, Queensland; in August, they moved to Wongabel. The 12th Battery returned to the regiment in September 1944, when the 6th Division deployed to Aitape‚ÄìWewak where there was no need for anti-tank support. By late 1944, the jungle division establishment was changed, and the allocation of anti-tank batteries restored to three per division. The regiment moved to Ravenshoe, Queensland, concentrating with the rest of the 9th Division at this time in preparation for deployment overseas. By December 1944, the regiment was under the command of Lieutenant Colonel J.N.L Argent, on the Atherton Tablelands. He subsequently commanded the regiment during its final campaign of the war, the recapture of Borneo. The move began in March 1945, via Cairns, Queensland, and then to Morotai Island; the regiment undertook labouring duties in May loading ships to support the 26th Brigade's operation to retake Tarakan. Further stevedoring work was undertaken in June before the regiment embarked to support landings around Labuan and Brunei. There was no real anti- tank role for them, and as such during the advance on Weston and Beaufort, the regiment was employed mainly as makeshift infantry assigned to the ad hoc Gusforce, to carry out patrols around Sipitang; it also employed a variety of weapons, including 4.2-inch mortars, 6-pounder anti-tank guns and 75 mm pack howitzers. At the end of the fighting the regiment undertake garrison duties on the Natuna Islands. Legacy and perpetuation Approximately 1,800 personnel served in the 2/3rd Anti-Tank Regiment during its existence. The Australian War Memorial lists 70 members of the regiment on the Roll of Honour as having lost their lives during the war, while 28 members were decorated as a result of their service. Post war, the regiment was perpetuated by the 3rd Anti-Tank Regiment, which was raised in 1948 within the part-time Citizens Military Force. This unit was later converted to a field artillery regiment, and in the 1950s was re-designated as the 23rd Field Regiment, Royal Australian Artillery.

Geffroy was born in Granville, Manche in France. He married Sarah Shaw in Newport on September 29, 1795, and before 1802 became a partner with her father, John Allen Shaw, as JOHN A. SHAW & Co. In June 1817 he was appointed Newport's Surveyor of Highways. In a curious incident in 1801, a letter to President Thomas Jefferson was sent from someone purporting to be Geffroy. The letter detailed accusations against many citizens and office-holders, and insisted that \\"A purification is necessary, & we cannot be purified unless you cleanse the Augean Stable completely.\\" Geffroy received a response from Jefferson, but doubted its authenticity and denied having ever written to the President. The United States Senator Christopher Ellery, a local resident, vouched for its authenticity and apparently impounded the letter for return to Jefferson. Ellery in turn accused Congressman John Rutledge Jr. of South Carolina, also then resident in Newport, of having forged this and another letter from Geffroy. These \\"Geffroy letters\\" were subsequently published in the Newport Rhode-Island Republican on September 18, 1802, under the headline \\"Rutledge's Letters To the President of the United States.\\" As noted in that article, although Geffroy possessed some mastery of spoken English, it was doubted that he could write, \\"with any degree of correctness, a single sentence of the language.\\" After a flurry of accusations and affidavits, Rutledge challenged Ellery to a duel, which he declined. Rutledge assaulted Ellery in January 1803, \\"publicly caning him and pulling him by the nose and ears\\". Although Rutledge vehemently maintained his innocence in the affair, he decided not to seek reelection in 1803 given the negative publicity. In another curious incident recorded by Channing, \\"a sudden and most malignant disease appeared in the house of Mr. Nicholas Geffroy... supposed to have originated from some foul substances thrown upon the ground occupied by Mr. Geffroy.\\" Several of Geffroy's mechanics died within a few hours of being attacked, but the illness did not spread beyond a few houses on either side of Geffroy. Geffroy's work is collected in the Metropolitan Museum of Art and Yale University Art Gallery.

CIRENE uses heavy water as its neutron moderator and normal \\"light\\" water as the coolant. This reduces the amount of heavy water required for operations compared to CANDU, but means it cannot run on natural uranium. CIRENE was one of several similar heavy/light water designs, with similar small-scale units at Gentilly in Canada, SGHWR in the United Kingdom and Fugen in Japan. Development of the reactor design began in 1967 at CNEN and Enel. A contract was signed in 1972 with Ansaldo to build a 40 MWe prototype at the Latina station. In contrast to similar prototypes, the modular construction of the CIRENE design meant the plant would be very similar to an actual production site in spite of its smaller size. Construction faced numerous delays and the site was still not complete in 1987 when nuclear development in Italy ended. Construction was allowed to continue, as opposed to canceling ongoing contracts, and the plant was completed in 1988. It was then abandoned, never having being loaded with fuel. CIRENE was one of several reactor designs being researched in Italy, which also included advanced light water designs with US companies and fast breeder reactors in partnership with France and Germany. CIRENE was ultimately the only one these that progressed to the prototype phase; after the Chernobyl accident a 1987 referendum ended the development of nuclear power in Italy and since then all existing reactors have been shut down.

All of the pictures depict only the upper body, and there have been no pictures found that depict its lower half, so it is unknown what its whole body looks like. According to the Edo Period writing Kiy≈´ Sh≈çran (Â¨âÈÅäÁ¨ëË¶ß), it can be seen that one of the y≈çkai that it notes is depicted in the Bakemono E (ÂåñÁâ©Áµµ) drawn by K≈çh≈çgen Motonobu is one by the name of \\"waira.\\" Starting in the Sh≈çwa and Heisei periods, y≈çkai-related literature and children's y≈çkai picture book references started to give three kinds of explanations, that they are a y≈çkai of unknown true identity,Á≤ï‰∏âÂπ≥„Äé„ÅäÂåñ„ÅëÂõ≥Áµµ„Äè1973Âπ¥ Ëä≥Ë≥ÄÊõ∏Â∫ó 176È†Å that they are a large y≈çkai that live in the mountains and use the large claws on their front legs to dig up small animals like mogura (moles) to eat,Ëó§Ê≤¢Ë°õÂΩ¶ Á∑®„ÄéÂ¶ñÊÄ™ÁîªË´áÂÖ®ÈõÜ Êó•Êú¨ÁØá„Äè‰∏ä ‰∏≠Â§ÆÁæéË°ìÁ§æ 1929Âπ¥ 32È†Å „ÄåÂ•Ω„Çì„Åß„É¢„Ç∞„É©„ÇíÊéò„ÇäÈ£ü„Åµ„Äç„Å®Ë®ò„Åï„Çå„Å¶„ÅÑ„Çã„ÄÇ and that they are a large y≈çkai in the mountains that attack and eat humans,ËÅñÂí≤Â•á„Äé‰∏ñÁïå„ÅÆÂ¶ñÊÄ™ÂÖ®ÁôæÁßë„ÄèÂ∞èÂ≠¶È§®Ôºà„Ç≥„É≠„Çø„É≥ÊñáÂ∫´Ôºâ1981Âπ¥ 123È†Å among other explanations.

The y≈çkai researcher Katsumi Tada notes that \\"wai\\" (Áïè) means \\"fear\\" or \\"dread,\\" and \\"wairai\\" (ÁïèÁïæ) means \\"to grow meek from fear\\" or \\"become afraid on the spot,\\" which is related to the waira's groveling appearance. Furthermore, both the Hyakkai Zukan and the Gazu Hyakki Yagy≈ç put the \\"waira\\" alongside the \\"otoroshi\\", so it can be interpreted that the \\"waira\\" (ÊÅê„ÅÑ, fear) and \\"otoroshi\\" (ÊÅê„Çç„Åó„ÅÑ, dread) are two y≈çkai that make up a pair. Legend There is the idea that waira were spotted in the mountains eating moles (mogura), with males being brown and females being red, but according to the y≈çkai researchers Katsumi Tada and Kenji Murakami, this idea originally came from a children's book series \\"Obake Bunko\\" („Åä„Å∞„ÅëÊñáÂ∫´, \\"Monster Library\\") (1976, Taihei Publications) by Norio Yamada where there is an entry on the \\"Waira\\" in one of the volumes, so this is something that Yamada made up.

C. arxii was first discovered in 1995 in Germany from a 22 year old female patient suffering multiple granulomatous tracheal tumours. It is a clinical strain that is typically found in humans and is also capable of acting as an opportunistic fungus of other vertebrates Human cases caused by C. arxii have been reported from all parts of the world such as Germany and Australia. The genus Cladophialophora comprises four different lineages, one of the main lineages belongs to the family of Herpotrichiellaceae. Within this lineage there are two major clades of the two one is called the bantiana clade in which C. arxii can be found. C.arxii is typically slow growing and is capable of growing at higher temperatures compared to other fungi with its maximal growth temperature reaching 42¬∞. History and taxonomy Cladophialophora arxii was first discovered in a tracheal granulomatous tumour of a 22 year old female in Berlin, Germany in 1995. It was originally considered to be C. borelli due to the similarity in structural appearance to C. arxii. The fungus was considered to be of the genus Cladosporium. The genus Cladosporium was first discovered in 1816, several human pathogenic species belonging to Cladosporium are now classified as the genus Cladophialophora. The genus Cladophialophora mainly consists of species of melanized hyphomycetes that are found within human hosts. C. arxii within the genus Cladophialophora was named after Dr. J.A von Arx, a Dutch mycologist, for his efforts in classify the genus Cladosporium. Phylogeny The genus Cladophialophora currently contains seven different species that are capable of causing disease in humans, C.arxii included. Cladophialophora consists of four different lineages: one lineage belonging to the family Herpotrichiellaceae and the other pertaining to a group of rock- dwelling strains. The majority of the human opportunistic fungi of Cladophialophora can be found within Herpotrichiellaceae which forms two major clades. The first clade, is known as the C. carrionii-clade and contains the species C. carrionii and C. boppii. The second clade, the C. bantiana clade includes the species C. bantiana, C. devriesii, C. mycetomatis, C. immunda, C. emmonsii, C. saturnica and C. arxii. It has been found that the environmental strain C. minourae is a sister strain to C. arxii Habitat Cladophialophora is a genus of black yeast fungi whose natural habitat consists of soil and rotting plant material. Several of the species pertaining to the Cladophialophora have been reported in both tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Cladophialophora arxii is a clinical strain that has generally been found in humans C. arxii is also capable of acting as an opportunistic fungus of other vertebrates. Growth and morphology C. arxii is a slow growing fungus that grows to about 36-40 mm in size when cultured on a growth medium of SDA agar and PDA agar at 25¬∞ C over a span of 35 days. The colonies formed contained dark grey aerial hyphae and black-brown coloured hyphae located on the margins of the SDA agar. On the PDA the colonies were dark black-brown with felty radial furrows. The fungus contained olive brown septated hyphae with both lateral and terminal acropetal conidial chains with branching. The overall morphology of the conidia of C.arxii are very similar to Cladophialophora devriesii the conidial chains of C.arxii are longer. Additionally, the conidial chains are fragile and borne on denticles. The conidia of C.arxii are pale brown, smooth, thick walled with a lemon-spindle shaped morphology. Initially the fungus contained muriform cells from tissue samples but following corticosteroid therapy the cells changed their shape and become irregularly shaped hyphae. Physiology The optimal growth temperature of the Cladophialophora species is from 27-30¬∞C but are capable of growing anywhere between 9-37¬∞C. C. arxii grows optimally at 37¬∞C with the maximum temperature it can grow at being 42¬∞C. C. arxii has an optimal production of non-septate swollen cells at a pH of 4-5. C. arxii is meso- erythritol and galactitol assimilated but is unable to assimilate on ethanol. Furthermore, it is not able to assimilate methyl-alpha-glucoside, soluble starch, glycerol, meso-erythritol, myoinositol or succinate. Clinical relevance Is a dematiaceous fungus that causes severe phaeohyphomycotic infections. It is fungus that is rarely seen, was the cause of granulomatous tumours in the trachea of the first patient that was diagnosed with this fungus in 1995. The fungus was treated with 5-FC, amphotericin B, and itraconazole.C. arxii was assumed to be the cause of subcutaneous phaeohyphomycosis of an ulcer in a 68-year-old woman, however, these results were not definitive Shortly after in 2001, it was believed believed that C. arxii was responsible for causing both cerebral and lung phaeohyphomycosis in a 30-year-old African women following a heart transplant. Additionally, it was the cause of femoral osteomyelitis in a 20 year old man. Treatment of the osteomyelitis included surgical debridement, itraconazole, and interferon gamma treatment. Finally, the most recently reported case of C. arxii was seen in Australia with the patient suffering from a pulmonary chromoblastomycosis. Treatment Several anti fungal drugs have been shown to be successful in treating C. arxii such 5-FC, amphotericin B, itraconazole, and interferon gamma treatment. Additionally, most of these antifungal drugs are usually accompanied by surgical procedures such as surgical debridement. Furthemore, in vitro studies have shown that combination therapy with amphotericin B and terbinafine have synergistic effects against C. arxii. 5-FC and itraconazole have also shown synergistic effects when targeting infections caused by C. arxii.

Convicted of killing John Young Taylor in Junee in 1890, Schmidt was subsequently hanged for this murder, without being charged with the others. Arrival in Australia Little is known about Schmidt's early life, including his year of birth. He was a native of Potsdam, and first arrived in Australia's Queensland, through New Zealand, in either 1881 or 1882. He passed through Victoria, and then surfaced in Peak Hill and Parkes. He first met with John Taylor in Peak Hill, and remained his acquaintance until his eventual murder. Murders =Murrumbidgee River victim= On October 19, 1888, a Mr. R. Whittaker was fishing in the Murrumbidgee River, when he chanced upon the headless, naked body of a man stuffed into a log. He quickly contacted authorities, and they quickly began investigating the mysterious death. The man was young, rather short (1.62 meters tall) and had several pieces of flesh hanging from his body, suggesting he had put up a fierce struggle with his killer. He was decapitated post- mortem with two distinct cuts, but neither the head, nor the clothes could be located. Despite several inquiries by Constable Nixon, nobody reported a missing person from the surrounding area, suggesting that the deceased might've been a foreigner, possibly a labourer. Two years later, when Schmidt was arrested for Taylor's murder, it was discovered that during the supposed time frame of the murder, he had been employed near Murrumbidgee as a fisherman. Additionally, William Givney, owner of the Coach and Horses hotel, recognized Schmidt as a man who had checked into his hotel shortly before the murder had taken place. =Jacob Rick= A 54-year-old native of Hochkirch, Prussia, Rick had been in Australia since 1870. He was described as short, stout, of ruddy complexion, with a high forehead, black curly hair, a deformity on the left side of his crown and with a full black beard. A resident of Rushworth, Victoria, he initially had a successful job as a miner before turning towards prospecting. As he was a very steady and industrious man, which presumably made him lots of money, he got himself acquainted with John Young Taylor, Schmidt's future victim. The two men travelled to Parkes on October 23, 1889, where he withdrew 30 dollars. As Taylor had paid for both's expenses, it is assumed that Rick was in a dire financial situation. Disappointed by the false advertisement of the situation in the area, the duo moved to Lambing Flats, where they met with Albert Schmidt. After prospecting for some time, Taylor left for Rushworth in December, leaving Rick and Schmidt in Lambing Flats. He took some of Jacob's items and brought them to his friends, telling them that he would come back soon and would definitely write to them. Rick was last seen alive on New Year's Eve in Wee Jasper, accompanied by Schmidt, on a horse-drawn carriage. When Schmidt returned to Wee Jasper on January 3, he was asked by various people about Rick's whereabouts. Albert (who presented himself as \\"Alfred Smitz\\", from Hamburg), gave various explanations, including that he was in a gold rush. In the meantime, he disposed of the carriage and the horse. When Taylor returned, Schmidt reunited with and followed John everywhere, eagerly convincing him to leave Rushworth for Tumbarumba, where he claimed they could find lots of gold. He was so anxious about it, that he even helped a local firm repair Taylor's wagon for 10 days, and when questioned about Rick, he claimed that he had been left behind in Albury. The duo then promptly left the area. When the news about Taylor's murder spread, suspicion fell on Schmidt concerning Rick's disappearance. Mounted police and aboriginal trackers were dispatched towards Wee Jasper in search of Rick's body, which was believed to have been buried somewhere in the outback. Although the body was never located, Schmidt was connected to his murder through Jacob's silver watch, which was found to be in his former companion's possession. While being questioned by Rev. John McIntyre in order to confess to the killing, Schmidt wasn't persuaded to do so, but suspiciously remarked that \\"it was enough to die for one man.\\" =John Young Taylor= On April 7, 1890, Schmidt and Taylor were both seen together at Junee, mucking about. In the following hours, multiple witnesses observed Taylor become increasingly intoxicated with brandy in several establishments, with his friend Schmidt only having small pints of shandygaff. Eventually, they were last seen in a hotel in Alfredtown, and after they left, they in the direction of a mutual friend named King. On the way in the wagon, the drunken Taylor mocked Albert and called him a liar, whom initially refused to retaliate. In the heat of the moment, Schmidt grabbed a tomahawk and hit John on the head, causing him to fall out of the wagon. Quickly realising that he had died, Schmidt panicked, wondering where he would hide the body out in the open. After deliberating for some time, he eventually bought a shovel from a store near Old Junee and decided to bury him near a railroad. He noticed some men working nearby, so he camped until nighttime, when he stripped the bloodied clothes off the corpse and cut the throat. At some point, he heard a crack, which came from the neck. In order not to have Taylor's body identified, he decapitated him, burying the body and head in different locations before burning the clothes and washing the wagon off in a nearby spring. After concealing his crime, Schmidt decided to go to Wagga Wagga, where he would confess his sins before a clergyman and then end his life. Before that, he would write down a confession in his notebook about the killing. While travelling along the Junee road, he came across two policemen, who noticed blood dripping off the wagon. Frozen in fear, Schmidt was arrested and put on the wagon so he could be driven back to the police station. On the way, he unsuccessfully tried to cut his throat with a razor and then a penknife, but was prevented; a bit later on, when he came to his senses, he grabbed his revolver and tried to fire it, initially unsuccessfully, and afterwards firing a non-lethal shot into his mouth. He was then sent off to the hospital, where he directed the authorities to the body's location. After his recovery, he was sent to the prison lock-up, where he was later visited by Rev. John McIntyre for an interview, in which he broke down and wept on several occasions. Trial, sentence and execution More than a month after his arrest, Schmidt's trial began. Multiple witnesses were called and plenty of evidence was produced, with Schmidt himself giving a written statement of the crime, which was read out to the court judge by Inspector Harrison. The jury gave a verdict of wilful murder, and Schmidt's trial before the assizes was scheduled for September 26. He pleaded not guilty, but was again found guilty and sentenced to death, to which he expressed no discernible emotion. While the gallows where prepared for Schmidt, he appeared shattered, yet accepting of, his eventual faith. On the date of his execution, the pale Albert ate a couple of eggs and had a cup of tea, shook the hands of all the attending workers and then stepped upon the scaffold, where Archdeacon Pownall read his prayers. Choosing not to make a statement about his crimes, Schmidt shook hands with the minister before the executioner, Robert Howard, the bolt was drawn and he was let down, dying almost instantaneously. After the body was left hanging for about half an hour, it was put in a coffin and buried in the prison cemetery.

Her research work focuses on alternatives of plant-based therapeutic options to manage drug-resistant epilepsy and the neglected tropical disease neurocysticercosis. In her work, she mostly explores the anticonvulsant activity of the plant alkaloid cryptolepine and its solid-lipid nanoparticles in the management of neurocysticercosis-induced epilepsy. Her goal is to identify a way to help cryptolepine permeate more efficiently into the central nervous system to reduce the risk of convulsion, helping patients to manage their condition as effectively as possible. Aside from her studies of epilepsy, Mante has also worked toward new therapies to alleviate pain, anxiety, and depression. In 2019, she was the only African recipient, and one of fifteen total, of the L'Or√©al-UNESCO For Women in Science International Rising Talent Award.

Rath Avenue in Ludington, the Therese Soles mural of Rath can be seen between two buildings William Albert L. Rath (January 28, 1849 ‚Äì August 10, 1916) was a German expatriate living in America. He was known for developing Mason County and Ludington, Michigan. Rath was a lumber baron, business magnate and philanthropist. He was mayor of Ludington for one term and a member of the Ludington Board of Trade. He was a member of the Ludington board of aldermen and the county board of supervisors.  Early life  William Rath was born in Hamburg, Germany on January 28, 1849. Rath grew up in Hamburg and attended public schools there for his initial education. His father, Hans, lived his entire life in Germany. His mother, Mary, died at William's home in Ludington, Michigan, after living in America for twenty years. Rath emigrated to America at the age of 21. He entered New York City, and then made his way to Michigan, arriving in Ludington on June 21, 1870. Rath served as an apprentice locksmith, but did not complete his apprenticeship. He then assisted his father in the stonemasonry trade as an assistant stonemason laborer shaping stones. He also learned how to put stucco on buildings.  Mid life  Rath married Lucy Rickhoff, who was also of German descent, on July 17, 1870. This was the culmination of a courtship begun in Germany. They had one child, Jennie. They also had two adopted daughters named Ella and Jessie. They were devout members of the local German Lutheran church, St. John's Lutheran. Rath's first jobs were as a laborer in Ludington sawmills. Eventually, he was promoted to lumber inspector, gaining him other responsibilities. His success in the lumber industry made him a lumber baron. Rath was a member of the Ludington Board of Trade from its beginning and their president for two years. He regularly reported on the freighter traffic in the harbor. He was also a collector of customs for the port for over a decade. Rath became a part of the firm Weimer & Rath in 1880. Around 1890, he suffered a large financial loss after falling victim to a fraudulent copper mining investment scam perpetrated by a man named Goldsborough. Later he developed a partnership with Ludington businessman Warren Antoine Cartier. The two formed the lumber business of Rath & Cartier. Rath founded the Ludington State Bank in 1901 with Charles G. Wing. Rath and Wing also founded another bank in Mason County called Fountain Bank. Rath was also involved with the Manistee Watch Company and the Star Watch Case Company. Rath belonged to the Ludington board of aldermen for ten years. As a member of the county board of supervisors he represented Ludington. He belonged to the Republican Party and was elected as the mayor of Ludington from 1910 to 1911. He ran for a second term but was defeated by his Democrat opponent Joseph Zelf by one vote. Rath was a leader in raising funds for local and charitable causes. He was involved in many corporations and held stock in concerns throughout the nation. Rath had extensive real estate in Mason and Manistee counties and owned a cottage on the south beach at Epworth Heights, a Ludington summer resort. He was the first president of the resort's Country Club. Rath also owned commercial property in Chicago. Through these real estate holdings he became a wealthy man.  Later life  When memories of the town's founder, James Ludington, faded, Charles Street was renamed Rath Avenue for William Rath. The William Rath Building, which is in the 100 block south of Ludington Avenue, was presented to the Salvation Army. The building served as the Salvation Army's headquarters from 1936 to 1961. Rath and Antoine E. Cartier bought the Cartier Park land near Lincoln Lake. He bequeathed $25,000 for its improvement and gifted it to the city. Rath died from a heart attack on August 10, 1916. His remains are interred at Lakeview Cemetery in Ludington. His estate was the subject of two lawsuits over prior businesses he was involved with. Rath is memorialized in a mural showing him drinking from a Fountain of Youth, a stylish trend in the late 1800s. The mural is located at 106 N. Rath Ave; it was painted by Ludington artist Therese Soles.
