He studied composition with Engelbert Humperdinck and conducting with Karl Muck. He spent most of his career in Japan. Biography Manfred Ludwig Hugo Andreas Gurlitt was born in Berlin on 6 September 1890Galliano, Luciana. \\"Manfred Gurlitt and the Japanese Operatic Scene, 1939-1972\\", Japan Review (2006) 18:215-248, esp. 216 to the art dealer Fritz Gurlitt (1854-1893) and Annarella Gurlitt (1856-1935).Peter Gnoss, \\"Preface\\", Gurlitt's Wozzeck (Vienna: Universal Edition, 2004), available online , accessed 7 March 2014 The Gurlitt family included many who distinguished themselves in the arts. Manfred was the cousin of musicologist Wilibald Gurlitt (1889-1963) and the great-nephew of the composer Cornelius Gurlitt. Another cousin was Hildebrand Gurlitt (1895‚Äì1956), an art dealer who was one of a very few authorized by the Nazis to deal in \\"degenerate art\\" and whose holdings of art works looted from Jews during the years of Nazi rule came to light in the 21st century. He studied for a time with Engelbert Humperdinck. From 1908 to 1910, he was a coach at the Berlin Court Opera and in 1911 acted as musical assistant to Karl Muck at Bayreuth. In 1911-12, he was second conductor in Essen, then in Augsburg for two years. in 1914 he was given the post of first conductor at the Bremen Stadttheater, a position he held until he became general music director there in 1924. In 1920 he founded a Society for New Music in Bremen to encourage avant-garde and rarely heard pre- classical works.Galliano, pp. 216-7 His first opera Die Heilige, set in 12th- century Japan, premiered in Bremen in 1920.Galliano, pp. 218 His opera Wozzeck after the play by Georg B√ºchner premiered with Gurlitt conducting in Bremen on 22 April 1926 four months after the opera of the same title by Alban Berg. Berg called it \\"not bad or unoriginal\\" but added that \\"the broth in the kettle of this opera, that is, in the orchestra, is too watered down\\". Like Berg, he used selected scenes from the play, added a lengthy elegy after Wozzeck's death, and added an epilogue. He used an offstage choir of sopranos that, in addition to commenting on the action, began and ended the opera with the text \\"we poor people\\". Unlike Berg, he provided a distinct musical setting for each scene without connecting interludes. In another assessment, \\"Musically, he stands closer to Strauss and Hindemith than to Schoenberg. His instrumentation is less sophisticated and complex than Berg's; his orchestra is subordinated to an accompanying role in the drama\\".Henry J. Schmidt,Georg B√ºchner: The Complete Collected Works (Avon Books, 1977), 391 Gurlitt's work attracted much attention at the time and marked the zenith of Gurlitt's career. Malicious gossip, charges of \\"debauchery and loose living\\", caused him to move to Berlin in 1927 where he taught at the Charlottenburg Musikhochschule and conducted for the Staatsoper, Krolloper, Max Reinhardt's Deutsches Theater, and Berlin Radio. He wrote Die Soldaten (1930) based the 1776 play by Jakob Michael Reinhold Lenz and Nana (1932) based on the novel by √âmile Zola. In the former he anticipated the operatic treatment of the same Lenz play by Bernd Alois Zimmermann, which premiered in 1965. In Nana he took on a subject similar to Berg's Lulu, also written 1933, but not premiered till 1937. Gurlitt's Nana had a libretto by Max Brod, and productions were cancelled because Brod's Judaism and Zola's politics offended Nazi ideology in CologneGalliano, pp. 217, 237 and Mannheim.Erik Levi, \\"Opera in the Nazi Period\\", Gurlitt's music was banned by the Nazis when they assumed power, but his presence in Berlin was tolerated as he undertook to bring his music in line with the aesthetics of the Third Reich. His mother Annarella tried to satisfy the Nazis of his non-Jewish heritage by certifying first that his Jewish paternal grandmother had converted to Protestantism and second that Gurlitt was not the son of Fritz Gurlitt, but of Willi Waldecker, the man Annarella married not long after Fritz died in 1893. Manfred Gurlitt was accepted as a member of the Nazi party on 1 May 1933. He was ejected from the party by court order on 3 May 1937. The court declared that Gurlitt was a \\"Jew of Mixed Race of the 2nd Order\\". German authorities frustrated his attempts to secure a teaching position in Japan for months, until he managed win readmission to the Reichsmusikkammer (State Music Institute) and proposed a trip abroad for \\"study, observation, and documentary\\" activities. He emigrated in April 1939 and arrived in Yokohama, Japan, with his third wife on 23 May.Galliano, p. 218-20 Japan was then an ally of Germany, both soon to become parties to the Axis Pact in September 1940. Gurlitt became active as an opera conductor with Fujiwara Yoshie's company, the Fujiwara Opera. In 1940, he became Musical Director of the Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra. In these positions he presented the Japanese premieres of many works from the standard repertoire by Mozart, Wagner, and Richard Strauss. Gurlitt's attitude to the Nazi regime remained equivocal, and he was a regular guest at the German Embassy in Tokyo.Antony Beaumont, notes to Phoenix Edition CD 114 In 1952 he founded the Gurlitt Opera Company in Tokyo, which had for its official opening the Japan premier of Mozart's The Magic Flute in February 1953. In 1957, it presented the first staging of Der Rosenkavalier in Japan.Galliano, pp. 229-30 Other Japanese premieres he produced and conducted, and sometimes directed, included Eugene Onegin (1949), Falstaff (1951), Otello (1953), Werther (1955), Die Entf√ºhrung aus dem Serail (1956), Die Meistersinger von N√ºrnberg (1960), and Salome (1962).Galliano, p. 231 Gurlitt conducted the world premiere of his Violin Concerto, written many years earlier, with the Tokyo Philharmonic on 1 February 1955. In 1955 he returned to Germany for a tour conducting his own works, but it was not a success. His idiom was judged pass√©. On 28 February 1958 in Tokyo he was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross of the German Federal Republic's order of merit.Galliano, pp. 237-8 He ceased to compose and never returned to Germany, bitter at the neglect of his music in post-war Germany. In 1958, his opera Nana had its belated premiere in Dortmund, where it enjoyed a \\"modest success\\".Galliano, pp. 231, 237 It was staged in Bordeaux in 1967.Galliano, p. 237 In 1969 he was awarded an honorary professorship at the Showa College of Music. He died in Tokyo on 29 April 1972 at the age of 82.Galliano, p. 239 His Soldaten was performed in Nantes in 2001.

Four county school districts received increases of over 6% in Basic Education Funding. Ninety school districts in Pennsylvania received the minimum 2% increase in 2009. Additionally, Governor Edward Rendell gave 15 Pennsylvania school districts education funding increases of over 10% in 2009. The highest funding increase went to Muhlenberg School District in Berks County which received a 22.31% increase in 2009-10. The state Basic Education Funding to the Gateway School District in 2008-09 was $6,840,471.05. The amount of increase each school district receives is determined by the Governor and the Secretary of Education through the allocation set in the state budget proposal made in February each year.Pennsylvania Budget Proposal 2010, Office of Budget. February 2010 According to the Pennsylvania Department of Education, 1148 students in the Gateway School District received free or reduced-price lunches due to low family income in the 2007-2008 school year.Pennsylvania Department of Education Funding Report by Local Education Agency. October 2009. =Accountability Block Grant= The state provides supplemental funding in the form of accountability block grants. The use of these funds is strictly focused on specific state approved uses. Gateway School District uses its $355,431 to fund extensive teacher training to improve their teaching and to provide extra instruction for struggling students. These annual funds are in addition to the state's basic education funding. Schools Districts must apply each year for Accountability Block Grants. In 2009-10 the state provided $271.4 million in Accountability Block grants $199.5 million went to providing all-day kindergartens. =Classrooms for the Future Grants= Gateway School Board received multiple grants from the PA Department of Education for three years, to purchase equipment to help reform the high school's core subjects instruction and to prepare students for future employment by using cutting- edge equipment and software. The district used the funds to purchase laptops for students, laptops for teachers, laptop carts and other digital equipment. The district also received substantial funds to upgrade our existing network infrastructure. The grant provided additional funding for a technology coach to instruct teachers in using the equipment to improve instruction. In 2006-07 the district received $407,573. In 2007-08, the district received $300,000. In 2008, the district received $45,4130 for a total of $752,986. Since 2006, Pennsylvania's Classrooms for the Future program has distributed more than $150 million for laptops, interactive boards and other high-tech tools in 543 high schools. In 2009, the CFF funding program was terminated due to a deep state revenue - budget shortfall. =Federal Stimulus grant= The district received an extra $2,147,273 in ARRA - Federal Stimulus money to be used in specific programs like special education and meeting the academic needs of low-income students. The funding is for 2009-10 and 2010-11 school years. =Race to the Top= School district officials did not apply for the Race to the Top federal grant which would have brought the district hundreds of thousands of additional federal dollars for improving student academic achievement. Participation required the administration, the school board and the local teachers' union to sign an agreement to prioritize improving student academic success. In Pennsylvania, 120 public school districts and 56 charter schools agreed to participate.Pennsylvania's 'Race to the Top' Fueled by Effective Reforms, Strong Local Support Pennsylvania was not approved for the grant. The failure of districts to agree to participate was cited as one reason that Pennsylvania was not approved. Real estate taxes In June 2011, The Gateway School Board set the property tax rates in 21.02 mills for the 2011-12 school year. A mill is $1 of tax for every $1,000 of a property's assessed value. Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the commonwealth as it creates a significant disparity in taxation within a community and across a region. *2010 - 21.0200 mills *2009 - 19.4100 mills. *2008 - 19.4100 mills *2007 - 19.4100 mills =Act 1 Adjusted index= The Act 1 of 2006 Index regulates the rates at which each school district can raise property taxes in Pennsylvania. Districts are not allowed to raise taxes above that index unless they allow voters to vote by referendum, or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index for the 2010-2011 school year is 2.9 percent, but the Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year.Pennsylvania Department of Education 2010-11 Act 1 of 2006 Referendum Exception Guidelines. The School District Adjusted Index for the Gateway School District 2006-2007 through 2011-2012. *2006-07 - 3.9%, Base 3.9% *2007-08 - 3.4%, Base 3.4% *2008-09 - 4.4%, Base 4.4% *2009-10 - 4.8%, Base 4.1% *2010-11 - 3.4%, Base 2.9% *2011-12 - 1.7%, Base 1.4% For the 2011-12 school year the Gateway School Board applied for exceptions to exceed the Act 1 Index, for special education costs and pension payment costs. Each year, the Gateway School Board has the option of adopting either 1) a resolution in January certifying they will not increase taxes above their index or 2) a preliminary budget in February. A school district adopting the resolution may not apply for referendum exceptions or ask voters for a tax increase above the inflation index. A specific timeline for these decisions is publisher each year by the Pennsylvania Department of Education. According to a state report, for the 2011-2012 school year budgets, 247 school districts adopted a resolution certifying that tax rates would not be increased above their index; 250 school districts adopted a preliminary budget. Of the 250 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget, 231 adopted real estate tax rates that exceeded their index. Tax rate increases in the other 19 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget did not exceed the school district‚Äôs index. Of the districts who sought exceptions 221 used the pension costs exemption and 171 sought a Special Education costs exemption. Only 1 school district sought an exemption for Nonacademic School Construction Project, while 1 sought an exception for Electoral debt for school construction. For the 2010-11 school year budget, the Gateway School Board applied for multiple exceptions to exceed the Act 1 Index, including special education costs, maintenance of revenue sources and maintenance of local tax revenues. In the Spring of 2010, 135 Pennsylvania school boards asked to exceed their adjusted index. Approval was granted to 133 of them and 128 sought an exception for pension costs increases. In 2009, the Gateway School Board did not apply for any exceptions to exceed the Index limit. =Property tax relief= In 2011, property tax relief was set at $171 for the 8,532 approved homesteads. In Allegheny County, the highest tax relief went to Duquesne City School District which was set at $351. In 2010, the Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief from gambling for the Gateway School District was $173 per approved permanent primary residence. In the district, 8,413 property owners applied for the tax relief. In 2009 the school property tax relief was set at $176 for 8,609 approved properties. The relief was subtracted from the total annual school property tax bill. Property owners apply for the relief through the county Treasurer's office. Farmers can qualify for a farmstead exemption on building used for agricultural purposes. The farm must be at least and must be the primary residence of the owner. Farmers can qualify for both the homestead exemption and the farmstead exemption. In Allegheny County, 60% of eligible property owners applied for property tax relief in 2009. Additionally, the Pennsylvania Property Tax/Rent Rebate program is provided for low income Pennsylvanians aged 65 and older; widows and widowers aged 50 and older; and people with disabilities age 18 and older. The income limit is $35,000 for homeowners. The maximum rebate for both homeowners and renters is $650. Applicants can exclude one-half (1/2) of their Social Security income, so people who make substantially more than $35,000 may still qualify for a rebate. Individuals must apply annually for the rebate. This can be taken in addition to Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief. Property taxes in Pennsylvania are relatively high on a national scale. According to the Tax Foundation, Pennsylvania ranked 11th in the U.S. in 2008 in terms of property taxes paid as a percentage of home value (1.34%) and 12th in the country in terms of property taxes as a percentage of income (3.55%).New Census Data on Property Taxes on Homeowners, Tax Foundation, September 22, 2009. Enrollment and Consolidation Many Allegheny County school districts are facing significantly declining enrollment and sharply rising costs. A proposal has been made by David Wassell, a prominent resident and leader in Allegheny County, to consolidate Allegheny County school districts to save tax dollars, focus dollars on student achievement, and improve student services. The plan calls for a proposed district that includes: East Allegheny School District, Penn-Trafford School District and Gateway School District.Wassel, David, The Next Page: For a New Allegheny County -- 26 school districts, 26 municipalities., The PostGazette.com. June 21, 2009 In March 2011, the Pennsylvania Institute of Certified Public Accountants Fiscal Responsibility Task Force released a report which found that consolidating school district administrations with one neighboring district would save the Commonwealth $1.2 billion without forcing the consolidation of any school buildings. The study noted that while the best school districts spent 4% of the annual budget on administration, others spend over 15% on administration. Governor Edward Rendell proposed that consolidation with adjacent school districts, in each county, would achieve substantial cost savings. The savings could be redirected to improving lagging reading and science achievement, to enriching the academic programs or to reducing residents' property taxes. Consolidation of the central administrations into one would not require the closing of any local schools. Pennsylvania has one of the highest numbers of school districts in the nation. In Pennsylvania, 80% of the school districts serve student populations under 5,000, and 40% serve less than 2,000. Less than 95 of Pennsylvania's 501 school districts have enrollment below 1250 students, in 2007.Pennsylvania Legislative Budget and Finance Committee, Study of the Cost Effectiveness of Consolidating Pennsylvania School Districts, 2007. This results in excessive school administration bureaucracy and not enough course diversity.Rendell, E. & Soderberg, M. (2009). Pennsylvania school district consolidation. 2009-10 Executive Budget Fast Facts. Pennsylvania Office of the Governor. In a survey of 88 superintendents of small districts, 42% of the respondents stated that they thought consolidation would save money without closing any schools. =Propel Charter School= In 2011, Propel Charter Schools applied to the Gateway School Board for an approval of their charter to open a kindergarten through 8th grade charter school within the district's borders. In February 2012, the Board approved the charter proposal. As per state law, the District must pay for each student and transport the child to any charter school within 10 miles of the District's attendance borders. For the 2011-12 school year, Gateway paid approximately $13,00 for each regular education student who attended a charter school and $27,000 for each special education student. Propel operates 9 schools in Allegheny County. Student academic achievement at the Propel schools has grown, exceeding their peers in the local district's schools. The Propel charter school opened the former Pitcairn Elementary Building on Agatha Street in Pitcairn, PA, which the Gateway board had closed in 2011. The school opened with little controversy to approximately 300 kindergarten through 6th grade student in August, 2012, with a planned expansion to 8th grade over the next two years. Administration The principal of Gateway High School is Peter Murphy. Assistant Principal (Grades 9 & 11) is ??? and Assistant Principal (Grades 10 & 12) Mr. Adam Knaresborough. The principal of Gateway Middle School is Mr. Rocco Telli and the assistant principal is ??? The school employs several guidance counselors who work under Dr. David Heavner. Wellness policy Gateway School Board established a district wellness policy in 2006 - Policy 246.Gateway School Board Policy Manual The policy deals with nutritious meals served at school, the control of access to some foods and beverages during school hours, age appropriate nutrition education for all students, and physical education for students K-12. The policy is in response to state mandates and federal legislation (P.L. 108 - 265). The law dictates that each school district participating in a program authorized by the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq) or the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1771 et seq) \\"shall establish a local school wellness policy by School Year 2006.\\" The legislation placed the responsibility of developing a wellness policy at the local level so the individual needs of each district can be addressed. According to the requirements for the Local Wellness Policy, school districts must set goals for nutrition education and physical education that are aligned with the Pennsylvania State Academic Standards for Health, Safety and Physical Education, campus food provision, and other school-based activities designed to promote student wellness. Additionally, districts were required to involve a broad group of individuals in policy development and to have a plan for measuring policy implementation. Districts were offered a choice of levels of implementation for limiting or prohibiting low nutrition foods on the school campus. In final implementation these regulations prohibit some foods and beverages on the school campus.Nutrition Standards for Competitive Foods in Pennsylvania Schools for the School Nutrition Incentive, Pennsylvania Department of Education ‚Äî Division of Food and Nutrition. July 2008 The Pennsylvania Department of Education required the district to submit a copy of the policy for approval. Extracurriculars The district offers a variety of clubs, activities and sports. Eligibility for participation is set by school board policy and the Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association. By Pennsylvania law, all K-12 students in the district, including those who attend a private nonpublic school, cyber charter school, charter school and those homeschooled, are eligible to participate in the extracurricular programs, including all athletics. They must meet the same eligibility rules as the students enrolled in the district's schools.Home- Schooled, Charter School Children Can Participate in School District Extracurricular Activities, Pennsylvania Office of the Governor Press Release, November 10, 2005 Athletics The Gateway High School athletic director is John Rovesti. The mascot of the school district is the Gateway Gator, a stylized alligator. _Gateway Middle School_ Beginning in 7th grade, at Gateway Middle School, Gateway School District offers competitive play in several sports while representing the district and their specific school. While athletics conducted by the middle school are not WPIAL/PIAA recognized and therefore do not offer playoffs/championships, they do serve as the first introduction to competition on an interscholastic basis for many student- athletes, preparing them for high school competition where much more may be expected of them. _Gateway High School_ Gateway High School is recognized as a member of the Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association (P.I.A.A.) on the state level. Within the PIAA, Gateway competes in the Western Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic League (W.P.I.A.L.), otherwise known as \\"District 7\\", on the regional level. On October 7, 2015, the PIAA voted to expand the classification system for football, basketball, baseball, and softball from four to six classifications. The vote for football passed by a 26-4 vote, while the vote for basketball, baseball, and softball passed by a 23-7 vote. All other sports still operate on the PIAA's original scale of four classifications. While most sports offered by the high school are competitive and recognized by the PIAA/WPIAL, some are noncompetitive and are not recognized by the PIAA/WPIAL, and others are combination of both. Sports Offered/Classifications Gateway High School offers a plethora of athletic programs. PIAA/WPIAL-recognized programs offered include cross country, football, golf, soccer, tennis, volleyball, basketball, swimming and diving, indoor track, track and field, wrestling, baseball, softball, volleyball, bowling, and lacrosse. Programs that are not PIAA/WPIAL-recognized include ice hockey and cheerleading, and therefore have no classification. Both of these programs are considered \\"clubs\\" and may or may not compete competitively while not being recognized as a school-supported sport. Per the aforementioned PIAA ruling, size classification for football, basketball, baseball, and softball sports is \\"AAAAA\\" (Five-A), which is the second largest of the six classifications (A, AA, AAA, AAAA, AAAAA, and AAAAAA). With the exception of lacrosse, size classification for all other PIAA/WPIAL-recognized programs is \\"AAA\\" (Triple-A), which is the second largest of the four classifications (A, AA, AAA, and AAAA). Lacrosse is a relatively new athletics program at Gateway High School, with its inaugural season being in 2011. Since then, officials worked hard to push for it to become a PIAA/WPIAL-recognized sport after initially operating as a club, which they eventually achieved. The Gateway High School lacrosse program is in the \\"AA\\" size classification, which is the third largest of the four classifications (A, AA, AAA, and AAAA). Clubs Gateway High School offers many clubs for its students to join. Gateway's Student Councils and Student Governments play a large role in student life. They are in charge of all school dances, fund-raisers, school spirit activities, and also attend and host various leadership workshops and conferences through the Pennsylvania Association of Student Councils. Gateway also competes in the FIRST Robotics Competition, an annual event for high- school aged participants. Gateway's team, Quasics, is FRC Team #2656. They have competed annually at the Pittsburgh Regional since 2008. Robotics Mr. Chalus and Mr. Reese are the founding teachers of the Gateway Middle School Robotics club. Lego Mindstorms are used for robotic competitions by the robotics club at Gateway Middle School. History Before 1948, Monroeville students could choose to attend nearby schools on a tuition basis. In the mid-1950s, the districts joined and began making plans for a new senior high school. Official action began February 1956, breaking ground in January 1957. The joint School Board selected the name of Gateway Senior High School. By September 1958, 900 students from Monroeville and Pitcairn were occupying the new high school. The first graduating class of 196 students received their diplomas in June 1959. For the next 25 years, grades 10-11-12 would attend school in the high school. 1983 marked the beginning of a new era at Gateway. Ninth grade was moved to the high school, South Junior High School became the Gateway Upper Elementary (5-6), and Monroeville Junior High School became Gateway Junior High School (7-8). Eleven years later, in 1994, Gateway Upper Elementary became the Moss Side Middle School (5-6), and Gateway Junior High School became Gateway Middle School (7-8). In 2007, the district completed its reconstruction and expansion of the high school complex. This complex includes the Monroeville Public Library, Pete Antimarino Football Stadium, the high school, Moss Side Middle School, administration offices, and various other multi-use sports fields.

CLIP-based techniques can be used to map RNA binding protein binding sites or RNA modification sites of interest on a genome-wide scale, thereby increasing the understanding of post-transcriptional regulatory networks. Workflow Basic Principle of CLIP CLIP begins with the in-vivo cross- linking of RNA-protein complexes using ultraviolet light (UV). Upon UV exposure, covalent bonds are formed between proteins and nucleic acids that are in close proximity. The cross-linked cells are then lysed, and the protein of interest is isolated via immunoprecipitation. In order to allow for sequence specific priming of reverse transcription, RNA adapters are ligated to the 3' ends, while radiolabeled phosphates are transferred to the 5' ends of the RNA fragments. The RNA-protein complexes are then separated from free RNA using gel electrophoresis and membrane transfer. Proteinase K digestion is then performed in order to remove protein from the RNA-protein complexes. This step leaves a peptide at the cross-link site, allowing for the identification of the cross-linked nucleotide. After ligating RNA linkers to the RNA 5' ends, cDNA is synthesized via RT-PCR. High-throughput sequencing is then used to generate reads containing distinct barcodes that identify the last cDNA nucleotide. Interaction sites can be identified by mapping the reads back to the transcriptome. History and applications CLIP was originally undertaken to study interactions between the neuron-specific RNA-binding protein and splicing factor NOVA1 and NOVA2 in the mouse brain, identifying RNA binding sites that had Nova binding sites and were validated as Nova targets in knock- out mouse brains. In 2008 CLIP was combined with high-throughput sequencing (termed \\"HITS-CLIP\\") to generate genome-wide protein-RNA interaction maps for Nova; since then a number of other splicing factor maps have been generated, including those for PTB, RbFox2 (where it was renamed \\"CLIP-seq\\"), SFRS1, Argonaute, hnRNP C, the Fragile-X mental retardation protein FMRP, Ptbp2 (in the mouse brain), Mbnl2, the nElavl proteins (the neuron-specific Hu proteins), and even N6-Methyladenosine(m6A) RNA modification antibody. A review of the range of proteins studied by HITS-CLIP has been published. HITS- CLIP (CLIP-seq) analysis of the RNA-binding protein Argonaute has been performed for the identification of microRNA targets by decoding microRNA-mRNA and protein-RNA interaction maps in the mouse brain, and subsequently in Caenorhabditis elegans, embryonic stem cells, and tissue culture cells. As a novel modification of HITS-CLIP, m6A-CLIP was developed to precisely map m6A locations in mRNA by UV-crosslinking m6A antibody to the target RNA. Recently, improved bioinformatics methods applied to Argonaute HITS-CLIP, have identified binding sites with single nucleotide resolution. Furthermore, the post-transcriptional regulatory networks of prokaryotic RNA binding proteins have been successfully elucidated under application of CLIP-seq. miRNA target detection The main steps (using Degradome sequencing concurrently) are: *mapping CLIP-seq reads *mapping Degradome-Seq reads *grouping overlapping reads into clusters *querying miRNA targets from different public databases *identifying miRNA‚Äìtarget interactions with an alignment score from CleaveLand not exceeding the cutoff threshold of 7.0 *the ClipSearch program was developed to search for 6‚Äì8-mers (8-mer, 7-mer-m8 and 7-mer-A1) (2,5) in CLIP-Seq data *The DegradomeSearch program was developed to search Degradome- Seq clusters for nearly perfect complements of miRNA sequences Methods=HITS-CLIP or CLIP-Seq HITS-CLIP HITS-CLIP, also known as CLIP-Seq, combines UV cross-linking and immunoprecipitation with high-throughput sequencing to identify binding sites of RNA-binding proteins. CLIP-seq depends on cross-linking induced mutation sites (CIMS) to localized protein-RNA binding sites. Because CIMS are reproducible, high sequencing depths allow CIMS to be differentiated from technical errors. PAR-CLIP PAR-CLIP PAR- CLIP (photoactivatable ribonucleoside‚Äìenhanced cross-linking and immunoprecipitation) is a biochemical method used for identifying the binding sites of cellular RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and microRNA-containing ribonucleoprotein complexes (miRNPs). The method relies on the incorporation of photoreactive ribonucleoside analogs, such as 4-thiouridine (4-SU) and 6-thioguanosine (6-SG) into nascent RNA transcripts by living cells. Irradiation of the cells by UV light of 365 nm induces efficient cross-linking of photoreactive nucleoside-labeled cellular RNAs to interacting RBPs. Immunoprecipitation of the RBP of interest is followed by the isolation of the cross-linked and co-immunoprecipitated RNA. The isolated RNA is converted into a cDNA library and deep sequenced using high-throughput sequencing technology. Cross-linking the 4-SU and 6-SG analogs results in thymidine to cytidine, and guanosine to adenosine transitions respectively. As a result, PAR-CLIP can identify binding site locations with high accuracy. However, PAR-CLIP is limited to cultured cells, and nucleoside cytotoxicity is a concern; it has been reported that 4-SU inhibits ribosomal RNA synthesis, induces a nucleolar stress response, and reduces cell proliferation. 4-SU substitution occurs in approximately 1 out of every 40 uridine nucleosides, and that T to C transitions frequently occur at the cross-link site. Recently, PAR-CLIP has been employed to determine the transcriptome-wide binding sites of several known RBPs and microRNA-containing ribonucleoprotein complexes at high resolution. This includes the miRNA targeting AGO and TNRC6 proteins. iCLIP iCLIP iCLIP (individual nucleotide‚Äìresolution cross-linking and immunoprecipitation) is a technique used for identifying protein-RNA interactions. The method uses UV light to covalently bind proteins and RNA molecules. As with all CLIP methods, iCLIP allows for the stringent purification of linked protein-RNA complexes, using immunoprecipitation followed by SDS-PAGE and membrane transfer. The radiolabelled protein-RNA complexes are then excised from the membrane, and treated with proteinase to release the RNA. This leaves one or two amino acids at the RNA cross-link site. The RNA is then reverse transcribed using barcoded primers. Because reverse transcription stops prematurely at the cross-link site, iCLIP allows RNA-protein interaction sites to be identified at high resolution. As a novel modification of iCLIP, m6A-CLIP further took advantage of the m6A-induced truncation sites (MITS) to precisely map m6A sites in mRNAs. Other CLIP methods sCLIP (simple CLIP) is a technique that requires lower amounts of input RNA and omits radio-labeling of the immunoprecipitated RNA. The method is based on linear amplification of the immunoprecipitated RNA and thereby improves the complexity of the sequencing-library despite significantly reducing the amount of input material and omitting several purification steps. Additionally, it permits a radiolabel-free visualization of immunoprecipitated RNA by using a highly sensitive biotin-based labeling technique. Along with a bioinformatical platform this method is designed to provide deep insights into RNA‚Äìprotein interactomes in biomedical science, where the amount of starting material is often limited (i.e. in case of precious clinical samples). Advantages and limitations=Advantages Early methods for identifying RNA-protein interactions relied on either the affinity purification of RNA- binding proteins or the immunoprecipitation of RNA-protein complexes. These methods lacked a cross-linking step and obtained low signal to noise ratios. Because RNA-binding proteins are frequently components of multi-protein complexes, RNAs bound to non-target proteins may be co-precipitated. The data obtained using early immunoprecipitation methods have been demonstrated to be dependent on the reaction conditions of the experiment. For example, the subset of RNA-protein interactions preserved depends highly on the protein concentrations and ionic conditions. Furthermore, the reassociation of RNA- binding proteins following cell lysis may lead to the detection of artificial interactions. Formaldehyde cross-linking methods have been used to preserve RNA-protein interactions, but also generate protein-protein cross-links. UV cross-linking methods provide a significant advantage over formaldehyde cross- linking, as they avoid protein-protein cross-links entirely. Proteinase K digestion also confers an advantage to CLIP methods due to the peptide left at the cross-link site. Reverse transcription of the fragments through the cross- link site introduces mutations that are specific to each separate CLIP method, and may be used to determine the binding site with high accuracy. Limitations CLIP Summary All CLIP library generation protocols require moderate quantities of cells or tissue (50‚Äì100 mg), require numerous enzymatic steps, and, for HITS-CLIP, extensive informatic analysis (as recently reviewed). Certain steps are difficult to optimize and frequently have low efficiencies. For example, overdigestion with RNase can decrease the number of identified binding sites. Cross-linking also presents a concern. The optimal cross-linking protocol varies between proteins, and the efficiency is typically between 1-5%. Cross-linking bias has been reported in the literature, but the impact of biases present in CLIP methods remains debatable. Computationally predicted miRNA targets derived from TargetScan are comparable to CLIP in identifying miRNA targets, raising questions as to its utility relative to existing predictions. Because CLIP methods rely on immunoprecipitation, antibody-epitope interactions are a potential obstacle. For instance, cross-linking at the epitope could impede antibody binding. Finally, significant differences have been observed between cross-linking sites in vivo in living cells and in vitro. Therefore, CLIP results may not necessarily reflect RNA-protein binding site interactions within the cell.

It is probably best known as the site of a Butlin's holiday camp in the second half of the 20th century and as the site for the national finals of the Community Games. By the early 21st-century, this had been converted into an accommodation centre for asylum-seekers. The centre was served by Mosney railway station, which closed down in 2000. Currently, it ranks as the biggest earning direct provision Centre in Ireland. History= Butlin's Mosney  Mosney was the first Butlin's camp outside the UK. In most ways Mosney was identical to Butlin's existing successful camps. A number of complaints appeared in the Catholic Standard, warning that holiday camps were an English idea that was not desirable in Ireland. Like the other camps, Mosney was designed to have a church and reassurances were given that it would be a Catholic chapel with a resident priest. Reassurances were also given that Irish nationals would have priority over British tourists in booking holidays. It was registered on , and in July 1948, the camp was finally opened by William Norton, who was the Minister for Social Welfare, and it operated successfully as a Butlin's camp until the early 1980s.  Mosney Holiday Centre  In 1982, Butlin's sold the camp, which was renamed Mosney Holiday Centre. The camp continued without substantive changes. Every year more than 6,000 children from around the country travelled to Mosney to take part in the Community Games, held in Mosney for 25 years. Mosney was the only location in Ireland that had the required 2,500 beds. Each June, the Lions Club took over the centre and provided holidays for 1,200 local people. The last season for Mosney was 2000. Dwindling visitor numbers and problems finding staff for the short 12-week season eventually led to the camp's closure.  Mosney Accommodation Centre  In December 2000, a five-year deal was signed with the government to turn Mosney into an asylum seeker accommodation centre. Mosney is now home to around 600 asylum seekers from over 20 different countries. Most of the old attractions have been mothballed, but recreation facilities still included a football arena, table tennis and a supervised play area. There is a 2007 documentary called \\"Seaview\\" featuring interviews with asylum seekers and staff from the camp. The deal to use the camp has been renewed periodically since 2005, with a fluctuating contracted capacity.

Benefits are based on affordability projections. Plan members share plan risk through adjustments to their benefits. A key element of the target benefit model is the existence of pre-determined guidelines linking benefits to funds available in the plan. Benefits and contributions are linked in a way that does not exist with traditional defined benefit or defined contribution plans.Target Benefit Plans: The Future of Sustainable Retirement Programs (Aon Hewitt, 2012). Retrieved on October 9, 2012 Description Target benefit plans are similar to defined benefit plans in that the annual contribution is determined by a formula to calculate the amount needed each year to accumulate (at an assumed interest rate) a fund sufficient to pay a projected retirement benefit, the target benefit, to each participant upon reaching retirement. It is similar to a defined contribution plan in that the plan does not guarantee any benefit will be paid. The plan's only obligation is to pay whatever benefit can be provided by the amount in the contributor's account. The actual earnings on the individual accounts may differ from the estimated earnings used in the assumptions and the investment performance of that account through the years. Advantages For pension plan sponsors, target benefits plan provide more flexibility than traditional defined benefit or defined contribution plans. Defined benefit plans provide a high degree of benefit certainty for members, but for plan sponsors contribution rates are more uncertain and funding costs can be high. Defined benefit plans can also contribute to intergeneration inequality, as retired members continue to receive benefits, whether or not those benefits were adequately pre-funded. The reverse is true for defined contribution plans where the contribution certainty comes at the cost of complete benefit uncertainty. Canada The target benefit model is growing in Canada. Only the province of New Brunswick has the full legislative structure required to operate target benefit plans, which in that province are called shared-risk pension plans. Several other provinces including Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, Saskatchewan, British Columbia and Alberta have introduced legislation allowing for target benefit plans, but are waiting for the establishment of a regulatory regime that would outline the specific rules governing this type of pension plan.Unpacking the Target Benefit Plan: Finding the Right Benefit/Funding Balance (Aon Hewitt, 2012). Retrieved on October 9, 2013. In 2016, Federal Finance Minister Bill Morneau introduced Bill C-27, a new piece of federal legislation that enables Crown corporations and federal private-sector employers to establish target- benefit plans. Major Canadian unions expressed their opposition to the legislation on the grounds that it would undermine the worker security of defined-benefit plans, contrary to the government's election commitments to strengthen retirement security. The bill later became controversial because it became known that Morneau still had substantial holdings in Morneau Shapell, which he had led in his prior career. While leading Morneau Shapell, Morneau had advocated for such plans, and the firm had worked with the government of New Brunswick to establish target-benefit plans and stood to gain from similar consulting work under the legislation.

The film is directed by Richard Spence and written by Tony Marchant, starring Rupert Graves and Steven Mackintosh. Plot Paul Prentice (Rupert Graves) and K- Foyle (Steven Mackintosh) were close friends during their secondary school days. Paul used to defend K- from the violent attacks of their classmates, who ridiculed K- for being effeminate. Some years later they are reunited literally by accident, when Paul, on the motorcycle he rides as a courier, runs into the cab that K- (who has undergone gender confirmation surgery and is named Kim) is riding in. Paul is initially surprised to discover that K- has become Kim, but asks her out to get re-acquainted. Their first date goes badly and Kim assumes that it's because Paul is nervous about being seen in public with her. Paul brings her flowers at her workplace (as a verse writer for a greeting card company) and they go out again. This date works out better and they end up back at Paul's place listening to music. The two continue to spend time together, with Paul teaching Kim how to ride a motorcycle. Their next dinner date, at Kim's place, is disastrous. Paul, struggling to understand transgender issues, drinks too much and ends up in the courtyard outside Kim's apartment, exposing his penis and ranting. The police arrive and arrest him for indecent exposure. Kim places a hand on one of the officers and he arrests her for obstruction. In the police van, one of the officers makes crude remarks about Kim and places his hand under her skirt. Paul intervenes and is beaten by the officer. At the police station, Paul is charged with assaulting the officer. Kim, his only witness, is terrified of being in trouble and intimidated by the police into keeping silent. She flees to her sister's home. At Paul's trial on the assault charges, Kim is able to gather her courage and testify for Paul. While he is still convicted, he receives only a token fine. A reporter at the courthouse tries to buy Kim and Paul's story but they refuse. They return to Kim's place, where Paul is surprised and delighted to discover that he and Kim are sexually as well as emotionally compatible; they make love. Paul, desperate for money following the repossession of his motorcycle, sells Kim's and his story to a London tabloid. With the story splashed all over the papers, Kim thinks she's going to be sacked from the greeting card company. Instead, her boss stands behind her. As the film draws to a close, it's revealed that Kim and Paul are living together and that it was Kim's idea for Paul to sell the story.

Symbian OS  Loadstone GPS = The Loadstone project is developing an open source software for satellite navigation for blind and visually impaired users. The software is free and runs currently on many different Nokia devices with the S60 platform under all versions of the Symbian operating system. A GPS receiver must be connected to the cell phone by Bluetooth. Many blind people around the world are using Nokia cell phones because there are two screen reader products for the S60 Symbian platform; Talks from Nuance Communications and Mobile Speak from the Spanish company Code Factory. This makes these devices accessible by output of synthetic speech and also allow the use of third party software, such as Loadstone GPS. The Loadstone developers, who are blind, are from Vancouver, Glasgow, and Amsterdam. Many users from around the world have contributed improvement proposals as they know exactly what functionality helps to increase their pedestrian mobility. Monty Lilburn and Shawn Kirkpatrick started the project in 2004. After the first development successes, they made it public in May 2006. Since then, other volunteers have found their way to this project of global self-help. The program is under the GNU General Public License (GPL), and was financed entirely by the private developers and by donations of users. This product provides blind people with more independence from the trading policy and prices of the few global vendors of accessible satellite navigation solutions. In large rural regions and developing or newly industrializing countries, nearly no exact map data is available in common map databases. As such, the Loadstone software provides users an option to create and store their own waypoints for navigation and share them with others. The Loadstone community is working on importing coordinates from free sources, such as the OpenStreetMap project. In addition they are searching for a sponsor of licenses for commercial map data, such as is offered by the company Tele Atlas. The other major supplier is Navteq, which belongs to Nokia. Lodestone is the name of a natural magnetic iron that was used throughout history in the manufacturing of compasses. Sighted owners of S60 devices can use Loadstone for leisure-time activities geocaching.  JavaME  LoroDux = LoroDux was a project by Fachhochschule Hannover. Like in Loadstone the user is led by direction and distance information. The text on the screen is read out by a screenreader. Vibration-Only navigation is possible. Data can be imported from the OpenStreetMap project. The development is discontinued because the team prefers to use Java on Android for the future. LoroDux LoroDux  Windows Mobile Mobile Geo= Mobile Geo is Code Factory's GPS navigation software for Windows Mobile-based Smartphones, Pocket PC phones and personal digital assistants (PDAs). Powered by GPS and mapping technology from the Sendero Group, Mobile Geo is the first solution specifically designed to serve as a navigation aid for people with a visual impairment which works with a wide range of mainstream mobile devices. Though it is a separately licensed product, Mobile Geo is seamlessly integrated with Code Factory's popular screen readers ‚Äì Mobile Speak for Pocket PCs and Mobile Speak for Windows Mobile Smartphones.  Standalone Devices =Trekker The Victor Trekker, designed and manufactured by HumanWare (previously known as VisuAide), was launched on March 2003. It is a personal digital assistant (PDA) application operating on a Dell Axim 50/51 or later replaced by HP IPAQ 2490B Pocket PC, adapted for the blind and visually impaired with talking menus, talking maps, and GPS information. Fully portable (weight 600g), it offered features enabling a blind person to determine position, create routes and receive information on navigating to a destination. It also provided search functions for an exhaustive database of point of interests, such as restaurants, hotels, etc. The PDA's touch screen is made accessible by a tactile keypad with buttons that is held in place with an elastic strap. It is fully upgradeable, so it can expand to accommodate new hardware platforms and more detailed geographic information. Trekker and Maestro, which is the first off-the-shelf accessible PDA based on Windows Mobile Pocket PC, are integrated and available since May 2005. The Trekker is no longer sold by Humanware; the successor \\"Trekker Breeze\\" is a standalone unit. The software has fewer features than the original Trekker.  Trekker Breeze  The Trekker Breeze is standalone hardware. Routes need to be recorded before they can be used. POIs are supported. BrailleNote GPS The BrailleNote GPS device is developed by Sendero Group, LLC, and Pulse Data International, now called HumanWare, in 2002. It is like a combination of a personal digital assistant, Map-quest software and a mechanical voice. With a receiver about the size of a small cell phone, the BrailleNote GPS utilizes the GPS network to pinpoint a traveler's position on earth and nearby points of interest. The BrailleNote receives radio signals from satellites to chart the location of users and direct them to their destination with spoken information from the speech synthesizer. The system uses satellites to triangulate the carrier's position, much like a ship finding its location at sea. Users can record points of interest such as local restaurants or any other location into the PDA's database. Afterward, they can use keyboard commands on the unit's keyboard to direct themselves to a specific point of interest.  Navigation systems that are not designed for blind people, but are accessible = Kapsys Kapten  The French company Kapsys offers a navigation system without a display, that works with speech input and output, called Kapten. It was originally developed for cyclists but soon became a favourite in blind communities because of its low price compared to other accessible navigation solutions. Later Versions took feedback about accessibility into account.  Historical or research projects =Trinetra  The Trinetra project aims to develop cost- effective, independence-enhancing technologies to benefit blind people. One such system addresses accessibility concerns of blind people using public transportation systems. Using GPS receivers and staggered Infrared sensors, information is relayed to a centralized fleet management server via a cellular modem. Blind people, using common text-to-speech enabled cell phones can query estimated time of arrival, locality, and current bus capacity using a web browser. Trinetra, spearheaded by Professor Priya Narasimhan, is an ongoing project at the Electrical and Computer Engineering department of Carnegie Mellon University. Additional research topics include item-level UPC and RFID identification while grocery shopping and indoor navigation in retail settings. MoBIC MoBIC means Mobility of Blind and Elderly people Interacting with Computers, which was carried out from 1994 to 1996 supported by the Commission of the European Union. It was developing a route planning system which is designed to allow a blind person access to information from many sources such as bus and train timetables as well as electronic maps of the locality. The planning system helps blind people to study and plan their routes in advance, indoors. With the addition of devices to give the precise current position and orientation of the blind pedestrian, the system could then be used outdoors. The outdoor positioning system is based on signals and satellites which give the longitude and latitude to within a metre; the computer converts this data to a position on an electronic map of locality. The output from the system is in the form of spoken messages. Drishti Drishti is a wireless pedestrian navigation system. It integrates several technologies including wearable computers, voice recognition and synthesis, wireless networks, Geographic information system (GIS) and GPS. It augments contextual information to the visually impaired and computed optimized routes based on user preference, temporal constraints (e.g. traffic congestion), and dynamic obstacles (e.g. ongoing ground work, road blockade for special events). The system constantly guides the blind user to navigate based on static and dynamic data. Environmental conditions and landmark information queries from a spatial database along their route are provided on the fly through detailed explanatory voice cues. The system also provides capability for the user to add intelligence, as perceived by the blind user, to the central server hosting the spatial database. UCSB Personal Guidance System In 1985, Jack Loomis, a Professor of Psychology at the University of California, Santa Barbara, came up with the idea of a GPS-based navigation system for the visually impaired. A short unpublished paper (Loomis, 1985) outlined the concept and detailed some ideas for implementation, including the idea of a virtual sound interface. Loomis directed the project for over 20 years, in collaboration with Reginald Golledge (1937‚Äì2009), Professor of Geography at UCSB, and Roberta Klatzky, Professor of Psychology (now at Carnegie Mellon University). Their combination of development and applied research was supported by three multi-year grants from the National Eye Institute (NEI) and another multi-year consortium grant from the National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research (NIDRR), headed by Michael May of Sendero Group. In 1993, the UCSB group first publicly demonstrated the Personal Guidance System (PGS) using a bulky prototype carried in a backpack. Since then, they created several versions of the PGS, one of which was carried in a small pack worn at the waist. Their project mostly focused on the user interface and the resulting research has defined the legacy of the project. As indicated earlier in this entry, several wearable systems are now commercially available. These systems provide verbal guidance and environmental information via speech and Braille displays. But just as drivers and pilots want pictorial information from their navigation systems, survey research by the UCSB group has shown that visually impaired people often want direct perceptual information about the environment. Most of their R&D; has dealt with several types of ‚Äúspatial display‚Äù, with researchers Jim Marston and Nicholas Giudice contributing to the recent efforts. The first is a virtual acoustic display, which provides auditory information to the user via earphones (as proposed in the 1985 concept paper). With this display, the user hears important environmental locations, such as turn points along the route and points of interest. The labels of these locations are converted to synthetic speech and then displayed using auditory direction and distance cues, such that the spoken labels appear in the auditory space of the user. A second type of display, which the group calls a ‚Äúhaptic pointer interface‚Äù, was inspired by the hand-held receiver used in the Talking Signs¬© system of remote signage. The user holds a small wand, to which are attached an electronic compass and a small loudspeaker or vibrator. When the hand is pointing toward some location represented in the computer database, the user hears a tone or feels a vibration. Supplementary verbal information can be provided by synthetic speech. The user moves toward the desired location by aligning the body with the hand while maintaining the \\"on-course\\" auditory or vibratory signal. Other variants of the pointer interface involve putting the compass on the body or head and turning the body or head until the on-course signal is perceived. Six published route-guidance studies indicate that spatial displays provide effective route guidance, entail less cognitive load than speech interfaces, and are generally preferred by visually impaired users. Brunel navigation system for the blind Prof. W. Balachandran is the pioneer and the head of GPS research group at Brunel University. He and his research team are pursuing research on navigation system for blind and visually impaired people. The system is based on the integration of state of the art current technologies, including high-accuracy GPS positioning, GIS, electronic compass and wireless digital video transmission (remote vision) facility with an accuracy of 3~4m. It provides an automated guidance using the information from daily updated digital map datasets e.g. roadworks. If required the remote guidance of visually impaired pedestrians by a sighted human guide using the information from the digital map and from the remote video image provides flexibility. The difficulties encountered include the availability of up to date information and what information to offer including the navigation protocol. Levels of functionality have been created to tailor the information to the user's requirements. NOPPA NOPPA navigation and guidance system was designed to offer public transport passenger and route information using GPS technology for the visually impaired. This was a three-year (2002~2004) project in VTT Industrial Systems in Finland. The system provides an unbroken trip chain for a pedestrian using buses, commuter trains and trams in three neighbor cities‚Äô area. It is based on an information server concept, which has user-centered and task oriented approach for solving information needs of special needs groups. In the system, the Information Server is an interpreter between the user and Internet information systems. It collects, filters and integrates information from different sources and delivers results to the user. The server handles speech recognition and functions requiring either heavy calculations or data transfer. The data transfer between the server and the client is minimized. The user terminal holds speech synthesis and most of route guidance. NOPPA can currently offer basic route planning and navigation services in Finland. In practice, map data can have outdated information or inaccuracies, positioning can be unavailable or inaccurate, or wireless data transmission is not always available. Navig NAVIG is a multidisciplinary project, with fundamental and applied aspects. The main objective is to increase the autonomy of blind people in their navigation capabilities. Reaching a destination while avoiding obstacles is one of the most difficult issue that blind individuals have to face. Achieving autonomous navigation will be pursued indoor and outdoor, in known and unknown environments. The project consortium is composed by two research centers in computer sciences specialized in human-machine interaction (IRIT) for handicapped people and in auditory perception, spatial cognition, sound design and augmented reality (LIMSI). Another research center is specialized in human and computer vision (CERCO), and two industrial partners are active in artificial vision (Spikenet Technology) and in pedestrian geolocalisation (Navocap). The last member of the consortium is an educational research center for the visually impaired (CESDV ‚Äì IJA, Institute of Blind Youth).  TANIA  TANIA is a project founded at the University of Stuttgart, Germany. The hardware is based on GPS and RFID. It allows navigation for blind and deafblind persons with step accuracy. It only works where special maps have been created for the system. Wayfinder access Wayfinder Access was a GPS solution from the Swedish company Wayfinder Systems AB. This application for Symbian phones was designed especially to work with screen readers, such as Mobile Speak from Code Factory or TALKS from Nuance Communications and offers text-to-speech technology. It is able to take the special needs of the blind and visually impaired into consideration. Symbian screen reader software offers more than just the reading of the application's screens, but also supports Braille devices. Highlights of Wayfinder Access include, but are not limited to: * Information provided for both pedestrian and vehicular navigation. * A database of 20 million points of interest. * Online maps that are regularly updated. * The \\"Where am I?\\" feature that readily gives information about your current location. * The \\"What is in my surrounding?\\" feature that initiates a scan of the immediate area to inform you of street names, intersections and nearby points of interest such as restaurants, banks, and much more. * The new ‚ÄúVicinity View‚Äù feature that allows you to hear audible references for an area with a scope that you can later adjust based on the radius of the scanned vicinity. * Feedback on points of Interest (POI), crossings or favorites that can be restricted, prioritized, and presented according to their distance from your location. The Wayfinder Access Service was shut down in 2011 after the company was taken over by Vodafone.

He is best remembered for his two tenures as Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury (government chief whip) between 1850 and 1852 and 1853 and 1858.  Background and education Born at Winterbourne Stoke, Wiltshire, Hayter was the youngest son of John Hayter and Grace, daughter of Stephen Goodenough, of Codford, Wiltshire. He entered at Winchester College in 1804 and matriculated from Trinity College, Oxford, on 24 October 1810, and took his BA in 1814.The Dictionary of National Biography Legal career Hayter was called to the Bar, Lincoln's Inn, on 23 November 1819, and became an equity draftsman and conveyancer. He attended the Wiltshire sessions, but retired from practice on being made a Queen's Counsel on 21 Feb 1839. He was, however, bencher of his inn on 15 April 1839, and treasurer in 1853.

In July 1850 he was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury (chief government whip) by Russell, a post he held until March 1852, and again under Lord Aberdeen and Lord Palmerston from December 1852 to March 1858. The Dictionary of National Biography states that \\"When Lord Derby came into power in 1852, Hayter marshalled the disorderly ranks of the liberal party with great success, and in the following governments of Lord Aberdeen and Lord Palmerston his powers developed, and his reputation steadily increased\\". Hayter was sworn of the Privy Council on 11 February 1848 and created a Baronet, of South Hill Park in the County of Berkshire, on 19 April 1858. Three years later, on 27 February 1861, he was presented by Lord Palmerston and 365 members of the House of Commons with a service of plate at a banquet in Willis's Rooms,Illustrated London News, 9 March 1861. according to the Dictionary of National Biography \\"in remembrance of the courtesy, fairness, and efficiency with which he had discharged his duties for many years as liberal 'whip'\\". Hayter was not a frequent speaker in parliament, but took part in debates on matters within his knowledge. He was a member of the committee in Lord Denman's inquiry into the management of the woods and forests, as well as chairman of the committee on Feargus O'Connor's land scheme.

SvƒÅtantrya is described as an energy that emanates from the Supreme (Parama≈õiva),Siva Sutras ‚Äì Jaideva Singh, p. 10 a wave of motion inside consciousness (spanda) that acts as the fundament of the world,Siva Sutras ‚Äì Jaideva Singh, p. 262 or in another view, the original word (logos, pƒÅrƒÅvak).Pratyabhijnahrdayam ‚Äì J.

In antithesis with the Vedantic concept of Brahman, which is a mere conscious witness without effective power, being inflicted by the illusory power (or maya of the Brahman), in the Kashmiri Shaivite viewpoint creation is actively willed into existence by the supreme consciousness (≈öiva) by the means of his irresistible will-force (SvƒÅtantrya). This is an important aspect of the Pratyabhijna school of Kashmir Shaivism. SvƒÅtantrya is a concept that goes to the root of many spiritual matters in Kashmir Shaivism,The Mirror of Self- Supremacy or Svatantrya-Darpana ‚Äì B.N.

Supreme creative energy The Kashmir Shaivism theory of creation affirms that the world was willed into existence by the sovereign force of ≈öiva.

Dyczkowski, p. 345 In relation to consciousness Disclaimer: on this topic there is a certain amount of melding and unification of the seemingly distinct concepts of will, freedom, consciousness, speech and bliss in the speciality texts. This is due to the insufficient ability of common language to describe the mystical states of consciousness. The prakƒÅ≈õa-vimar≈õa theory affirms the world is based on two principles: the self shining conscious light (prakƒÅ≈õa) and its ability to contain a reflection of itself and of the creation (vimar≈õa).Doctrine of Divine Recognition ‚Äì K.C. Pandey, p. 95Shiva Sutras ‚Äì Swami Lakshmanjoo, p. 110 To reflect itself is to know absolute bliss (ƒÅnanda) ‚Äì thus, free will (svƒÅtantrya), conscious reflection (vimar≈õa) and bliss (ƒÅnanda) are three concepts describing the same reality.Vac - Andre Padoux, p. 247 Bliss (ƒÅnanda) is the internal state of consciousness, its natural state. The same is true of svƒÅtantrya: it too is a fundamental quality of the subject.Towards Transcendence ‚Äì M.L. Pandit, p. 193Pratyabhijnahrdayam ‚Äì J. Singh, p. 22 SvƒÅtantrya is the first stage of creation, an undifferentiated energy, or, looking from bottom up, we could also say that it is the force that unifies all the energies of creationShiva Sutras ‚Äì Swami Lakshmanjoo, p. 30 The first creation of svƒÅtantrya is the energy of will (icchƒÅ ≈õakti). Then come the energies of knowledge (j√±ƒÅna ≈õakti) and action (kriyƒÅ ≈õakti) and together with the energy of consciousness (cit ≈õakti) and the energy of bliss (ƒÅnanda ≈õakti) they form the supreme pentad of creation, the so-called \\"pure creation\\".Siva Sutras ‚Äì Jaideva Singh, p. 20Shiva Sutras ‚Äì Swami Lakshmanjoo, p. 176 Everything related to consciousness is also related to svƒÅtantrya. Speech is seen in Kashmir Shaivism as differentiated in four classes : external (vaikharƒ´), mental (madhyamƒÅ), subtle (pa≈õyanti) and supreme (parƒÅ). SvƒÅtantrya is equated to pƒÅrƒÅvak, the creative logos / logos spermatikos. In relation to mystical practices In the mystical practices of Kashmir Shaivism, svƒÅtantrya is both the sovereign will of ≈öiva, solely deciding the descent of divine grace (≈õaktipƒÅt) and the will of the adept as he becomes more and more submerged into the divine. According to Kashmir Shaivism, spiritual realization is more than a state of illumination (defined as pure witness, non-dual consciousness or atma-vyapti).Siva Sutras ‚Äì Jaideva Singh, p. 148 Full spiritual realization means to know bliss (ƒÅnanda) and to control the energies (≈õakti) and the mantrasShiva Sutras ‚Äì Swami Lakshmanjoo, p. 69 (or, the so-called ≈õiva-vyƒÅpti). The root of spiritual efficiency is svƒÅtantrya, the operative, dynamic aspect of the absolute. An adept who reaches spiritual illumination needs to learn how to stabilize his experience. The Kashmir Shaivism scriptures declare that stability is based on the assimilation of the energy of svƒÅtantrya.Siva Sutras ‚Äì Jaideva Singh, p. 149 Thus, while the incipient practitioner aims for the experience of the nondual consciousness, the advanced ones focus on the assimilation of all the energies into non-duality. SvƒÅtantrya being the root of all energies, it becomes automatically the final step of the spiritual practice. The will of such an advanced practitioner becomes more and more efficient as it identifies with the will of ≈öiva. Yet, his actions are necessarily without base in egoism (without the attributes of good or bad)Shiva Sutras ‚Äì Swami Lakshmanjoo, p. 25 ‚Äì and this is an attitude that defines the discipline of karma yoga. All the spiritual paths (upƒÅyas): that of ≈öiva (≈õƒÅmbhavopƒÅya), that of ≈öakti (≈õƒÅktopƒÅya) and that of the man (ƒÅ·πáavopƒÅya) are subsumed under the umbrella of svƒÅtantrya as it is the sole mediator of divine grace.Shiva Sutras ‚Äì Swami Lakshmanjoo, p. 33 The adept who has attained svƒÅtantrya is beyond the need for formal meditation ‚Äì that is ‚Äì for him to meditate or to act in everyday life is identical ‚Äì he does all his actions from a state of perfect unity with ≈öiva from now on. This is the culmination of the Kashmiri Shaivite spiritual practice.Shiva Sutras ‚Äì Swami Lakshmanjoo, p. 32 Such an adept does not exert himself in maintaining this state of consciousness because it is his own nature. From his point of view, everything is made of just forms of consciousness, his own consciousness, also identified with the consciousness of ≈öiva at this stage. The energy he possesses is the risen form of Kundalini.The Aphorisms of Siva ‚Äì M.S.G. Dyczkowski, p. 72 His mantras have spiritual efficacy.The Aphorisms of Siva ‚Äì M.S.G. Dyczkowski, p. 85 His heart (h·πõdaya) is the receptacle of all objects.Abhinavaguptas commentary on the Bhagavad Gita ‚Äì B. Marjanovic, p. 305 Kashmir Shaivism doctrine affirms that nothing can compel ≈öiva to bestow the final spiritual realization ‚Äì it is solely based on the unconditioned svƒÅtantrya, or, from the opposite perspective, there is no obstacle that can separate the disciple from becoming one with ≈öiva because he has svƒÅtantrya which is the ultimate power that cannot be impeded by anything.Shiva Sutras ‚Äì Swami Lakshmanjoo, p. 26 Thus, in Kashmir Shaivism there is this paradoxical concept that nothing needs to be done, as the supreme realization can appear without effort, but also, no matter what effort one undergoes, he cannot compel ≈öiva to liberate his self (ƒÅtman).The Himalayan mysticism ‚Äì R. Nataraj, p. 17 Yet, this is not an invitation to abandon hard work but a justification for humility. In a meditation prescribed in Vij√±ana Bhairava Tantra, one is supposed to unite his vital energy (prƒÅ·πáa) with svƒÅtantrya in the mystical force center that exists 12 finger widths above the head, dvada≈õƒÅnta.Vijnana Bhairava ‚Äì Swami Lakshman Joo, p. 59 Alternative names SvƒÅtantrya has a number of synonyms such as: mahe≈õvaraya (from mahe≈õvara which means supreme lord), or ai≈õvarya (similarly, from the word I≈õvara which also means Lord).Pratyabhijnahrdayam ‚Äì J. Singh, p. 144 It has been personalized as the Goddess (Devi),Shiva Sutras ‚Äì Swami Lakshmanjoo, p. 47 the virginal feminine deity Uma (virginity being a symbol of existence outside the reach of the profane world)Siva Sutras ‚Äì Jaideva Singh, p. 53 and the playful goddess KumƒÅrƒ´.Shiva Sutras ‚Äì Swami Lakshmanjoo, p. 46 Other scriptures also refer to svƒÅtantrya as the Glory of Siva on account of it being identical to the 'ocean' of uncreated light (prakƒÅ≈õa) and cosmic bliss (ƒÅnanda) ‚Äì cidƒÅnanda-Ghana.

The road runs from Interstate 97 (I-97) and MD 3 in Millersville west and north to Washington Road in Westminster. The east-west portion of MD 32 is the Patuxent Freeway, a four- to six-lane freeway between I-97 and MD 108 in Clarksville. The freeway passes through Odenton and Fort Meade, the site of Fort George G. Meade and the National Security Agency (NSA), in western Anne Arundel County and along the southern part of Columbia in Howard County. Via I-97, MD 32 connects those communities with U.S. Route 50 (US 50) and US 301 in Annapolis. The state highway also intersects the four primary highways connecting Baltimore and Washington: the Baltimore-Washington Parkway, US 1, I-95, and US 29\\\\. MD 32's north-south section, Sykesville Road, connects Clarksville and Westminster by way of Sykesville and Eldersburg in southern Carroll County. MD 32 was constructed as the original state road from West Friendship north to Westminster and from Westminster west to Taneytown in the early 1910s. The state highway was extended northwest to the Pennsylvania state line near Emmitsburg in the late 1910s. The portion of MD 32 from Glenelg to US 1 in Savage was built as MD 106 in the 1920s and early 1930s. MD 32 was extended south from West Friendship and assumed all of MD 106 in the mid-1940s. In the mid-1950s, the section of MD 32 from Westminster west to Emmitsburg was renumbered as an extension of MD 97\\\\. MD 32 would later be restored to its old route through Westminster and west toward Taneytown when MD 97, which is now MD 140 west of Westminster, was relocated in the early 1960s. MD 32 was truncated to Westminster in the late 1970s and rolled back to its present northern terminus in 2001. Along its present course, MD 32 bypassed Sykesville and was relocated from Clarksville to Glenelg in the early 1960s. The state highway was also extended east from Savage to Fort Meade in the late 1960s. A disjoint segment of MD 32 was constructed on a new alignment from MD 175 in Odenton to MD 178 in Crownsville in the early 1970s. The Patuxent Freeway was built from Fort Meade to Columbia in the mid-1980s and from Fort Meade to Millersville in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The freeway was completed from Columbia to Clarksville in the mid-1990s and through Fort George G. Meade in 2005. Future plans call for MD 32 to be upgraded to a freeway from Clarksville to West Friendship. Route description MD 32 is maintained by the Maryland State Highway Administration (MDSHA) for its entire length except for the section between Samford Road and Canine Road in Fort Meade, which is maintained by the U.S. government. The highway is a part of the main National Highway System from its eastern terminus in Millersville to I-70 and US 40 in West Friendship; the highway is also a National Highway System principal arterial from the Howard-Carroll county line to MD 91 at Gamber. Millersville to Fort Meade View west at the east end of MD 32 at I-97 and MD 3 in Millersville MD 32 begins at a partial cloverleaf interchange with I-97 and MD 3 (Robert Crain Highway) in Millersville. MD 32 starts as a pair of two-lane flyover ramps that split west from northbound I-97 and join southbound I-97; the MD 32 ramps head northwest while I-97 curves to the northeast and settles into the wide median of the northern end of MD 3\\\\. After passing through its interchange with MD 3, MD 32 heads northwest as the Patuxent Freeway, a four-lane freeway that passes to the north of the community of Gambrills. The state highway's first interchange is with Sappington Station Road, a spur from the westbound ramps of MD 32 that is unsigned MD 32AA. The eastbound ramps connect with county-maintained Burns Crossing Road. MD 32 continues northwest along the northern edge of Odenton, where the freeway gradually curves to the southwest, has a diamond interchange with MD 170 (Telegraph Road) and a partial cloverleaf interchange with MD 175 (Annapolis Road), and crosses over Amtrak's Northeast Corridor and MARC's Penn Line between the interchanges. MD 32 heads west from Odenton along the southern edge of Fort George G. Meade. The freeway has a dumbbell interchange with MD 198 (Laurel Fort Meade Road) just north of Tipton Airport. MD 32 curves northwest and has an interchange with Samford Road, which is one of two interchanges that provide access to the NSA. The median of MD 32 widens at the interchange as the eastbound ramps enter and exit on the left to a roundabout, from which Samford Road crosses the westbound lanes of MD 32\\\\. Immediately to the north of a trumpet interchange with Canine Road, which provides access to the NSA, the National Vigilance Park, and the National Cryptologic Museum, the freeway has a cloverleaf interchange with the Baltimore-Washington Parkway. Fort Meade to Clarksville MD 32 westbound at Dorsey Run Road exit in Annapolis Junction MD 32 traverses Dorsey Run into the industrial community of Annapolis Junction, where westbound MD 32 has an interchange with Guilford Road, which leads to National Business Parkway and the historic home Grassland. The state highway crosses over CSX's Capital Subdivision into Howard County and immediately has a partial cloverleaf interchange with Dorsey Run Road. Dorsey Run Road, which is unsigned MD 732R, provides access to the Savage station on MARC's Camden Line (which runs along the CSX line) and several industrial parks in Annapolis Junction. MD 32 continues northwest into Savage, where the highway has a cloverleaf interchange with US 1 (Washington Boulevard) that includes collector-distributor lanes in both directions. North of Savage, the freeway has a partial cloverleaf interchange with I-95 that has a pair of left-exiting ramps from westbound MD 32 to southbound I-95 and from eastbound MD 32 to northbound I-95; because of these left exits, I-95 is configured differently in that its southbound lanes pass under MD 32 and its northbound lanes pass over MD 32. MD 32 continues west as a six-lane freeway through the expansive new town of Columbia. The freeway passes south and north of the villages of King's Contrivance and Owen Brown, respectively, where the highway has a partial cloverleaf interchange with Broken Land Parkway that provides access to two park and ride lots serving MTA Maryland commuter buses and a four-loop interchange with Eden Brook Drive and Shaker Drive. MD 32 crosses the Little Patuxent River between the two interchanges. Just south of Simpsonville, the state highway has a cloverleaf interchange with US 29 (Columbia Pike), which provides access to Columbia Town Center. The freeway reduces to four lanes and crosses the Middle Patuxent River just east of its diamond interchange with Sanner Road and Cedar Lane. MD 32 continues along the southern edge of the village of River Hill, where the highway has a half- interchange with Great Star Drive, which is unsigned MD 732V, allowing access to and from the east. The state highway continues northwest to Clarksville, where the highway has a diamond interchange with MD 108 (Clarksville Pike). Clarksville to Westminster West of its interchange with MD 108, MD 32's name changes to Sykesville Road and becomes a north-south highway, which continues as a partially controlled-access two-lane undivided highway through a mix of farmland and large-plot residential subdivisions. The state highway is paralleled to the west by its old alignment, Ten Oaks Road. East of the community of Dayton, the state highway passes by MDSHA's Dayton shops. In Glenelg, MD 32 passes under Triadelphia Road and expands to a two-lane divided highway for its dumbbell interchange with Burnt Woods Road, which also provides access to the northern end of Ten Oaks Road and Pfefferkorn Road. The state highway becomes undivided again and veers northeast and north toward West Friendship. MD 32 crosses the Middle Patuxent River and Terrapin Branch before its intersection with MD 144 (Frederick Road), where the highway expands to a four-lane divided highway. The state highway has a diamond interchange with I-70 and US 40 (Baltimore National Pike) before reducing to a four-lane undivided highway that passes east of a park and ride lot continues north to MD 32's intersection with MD 99 (Old Frederick Road). View south along MD 32 in Westminster MD 32 continues north as a two-lane undivided road to Sykesville. Just south of the town, the state highway intersects West Friendship Road, the old alignment of MD 32 that is now unsigned MD 851\\\\. MD 32 veers northeast and crosses the Patapsco River and CSX's Old Main Line Subdivision into Carroll County; immediately to the east of MD 32's crossing is the highway's old aluminum bridge. The state highway passes to the west of Springfield Hospital Center, whose original buildings are preserved as the Warfield Complex, Hubner, and T Buildings. MD 32 temporarily expands to a four-lane divided highway at its intersection with Springfield Avenue, which is the northern end of MD 851, and continues north into the suburban community of Eldersburg. The state highway passes west of a park and ride lot before it expands to a four-lane divided highway at Piney Ridge Parkway and maintains that form through its intersection with MD 26 (Liberty Road). MD 32 continues through the suburban area as a four-lane undivided highway with two lanes northbound, one lane southbound, and a center turn lane. The state highway passes to the east of Liberty High School and reduces to two lanes north of Bennett Road. MD 32 heads into a forested area and crosses the Morgan Run arm of Liberty Reservoir. The state highway passes through an S-curve before heading through the communities of Louisville and Gamber, where the highway meets the southern end of MD 91 (Gamber Road). MD 32 continues northwest through a mix of farmland and residential subdivisions toward Fenby, where the highway intersects MD 97 (New Washington Road). Just north of MD 97 adjacent to Carroll Community College, the state highway meets MD 97's old alignment, Old Washington Road, which is unsigned MD 854B. MD 32 continues north as Washington Road through a suburban area; the highway parallels MD 97 and passes to the west of the Carroll County Career and Technology Center and Westminster Senior High School east of the historic Friendship Valley Farm and Carroll County Almshouse and Farm, which is now the Carroll County Farm Museum. Just north of Bennett Avenue, MD 32 reaches its northern terminus at the southern city limit of Westminster. The roadway continues north as a municipal street to Main Street, which heads northwest through the Westminster Historic District. History=Original construction MD 32 northbound in Sykesville When the Maryland State Roads Commission (MDSRC), the predecessor of MDSHA, laid out its original state road system in 1909, the commission included the roads from Westminster to Taneytown and from West Friendship to Westminster via Eldersburg. These highways already contained several stretches of improved highway; Main Street in Westminster and the highways for on either side of Gamber and for on either side of Sykesville were paved by 1910. In addition, the designated state roads included two turnpikes: the Westminster and Meadow Branch Turnpike operated from the western city limit of Westminster northwest to Fountain Valley on the road to Taneytown; and the Westminster and Fenby Turnpike operated from the southern city limit of Westminster to Fenby. In 1911, the whole highway from West Friendship to Eldersburg was completed after the addition of wide macadam sections on either side of the existing paved road through Sykesville. That same year, construction began on the state road between Eldersburg and Fenby. The roads from Eldersburg to the existing paved road through Gamber and from Gamber to Fenby were completed with a wide macadam surface in 1912 and 1913, respectively. The road from Fountain Valley to Taneytown was paved as a wide concrete road from Fountain Valley through Frizzelburg in 1914 and from there to Taneytown in 1915. The former turnpikes still remained to be improved in 1915; those roads were resurfaced with macadam by 1919 to complete the original state road from West Friendship to Taneytown. The next portion of what was to become MD 32 to be constructed was an extension of the Taneytown road northwest through Emmitsburg, which was planned by 1915. The sections from Taneytown to the Monocacy River and from the river west toward Emmitsburg were completed as a wide concrete road by 1919. The remaining to Emmitsburg were underway by 1920 and built as a wide concrete road by 1921. The highway was completed from Emmitsburg northwest to the Pennsylvania state line by 1923. When MDSRC started assigning numbers to its state roads in 1927, the highway from US 40 in West Friendship to the Pennsylvania state line northwest of Emmitsburg was designated MD 32. The portion of MD 32 from Glenelg to Savage was originally designated MD 106. This highway was paved in concrete from Dayton to Clarksville and from Clarksville to about west of the Middle Patuxent River near Simpsonville by 1923. That same year, a concrete road was added south from West Friendship to the Middle Patuxent River. The concrete road from Clarksville was extended to the Middle Patuxent River opposite Simpsonville in 1925. A macadam road was built from Atholton to Oakland Mills Road in Guilford between 1924 and 1926. Guilford was connected to US 1 near Savage with a gravel road by 1927. The gap in MD 106 through Simpsonville was filled with a concrete road in 1929 and 1930. MD 32 was extended southwest from the Middle Patuxent River to north of Glenelg around 1933. MD 106 was extended north from Dayton to Glenelg as a macadam road in 1934. The gap in the highway north of Glenelg was filled by 1946, by which time MD 32 had been extended south and east over the course of MD 106 to Savage. Improvements The first major improvement to the original course of MD 32 was the replacement of the highway's one-lane covered bridge over the Monocacy River with a wider triple-span concrete arch bridge in 1925. The highway was widened to from Westminster to just east of Taneytown by 1930 and from Taneytown to the Pennsylvania state line by 1934. MD 32 was reconstructed and widened again from Emmitsburg to the Pennsylvania state line in 1948 and through Taneytown in 1949. When US 40 was relocated as a four-lane divided highway through West Friendship in 1951, the new highway was placed on a bridge over MD 32 and a two-way ramp added to connect the grade-separated highways. MD 32 was relocated between Eldersburg and Louisville and a new bridge was constructed over Morgan Run in 1952 to replace the old road that would have been submerged by the filling of Liberty Reservoir. Riverside view of MD 32's former aluminum girder bridge in Sykesville In 1956, the portion of MD 32 from Fenby north to Westminster and from Westminster west through Taneytown and Emmitsburg to the Pennsylvania state line was renumbered MD 97, which had been extended north from Howard County. The portion of MD 32 from MD 26 in Eldersburg to MD 97 in Fenby was transferred to county maintenance at the same time. In 1960, the road from Eldersburg to Fenby returned to the state highway system. In addition, MD 97 was moved to a new alignment, New Washington Road; the new alignment ran from Fenby to US 140, which then connected Baltimore with Gettysburg, in Westminster. MD 97 then followed the Westminster Bypass to the northwest side of the city. Subsequently, MD 32 was extended along its original alignment through Westminster to MD 97 near Western Maryland College (now McDaniel College). MD 32 would later be assigned to its original alignment from Fountain Valley to east of Taneytown when MD 97's new alignment between the two communities was completed in 1965. The disjoint segment of MD 32 was renumbered MD 832 in 1978. In 1979, US 140 was decommissioned; the highways from Baltimore to Westminster and from Westminster through Emmitsburg became MD 140\\\\. MD 97 was moved to its present course from Westminster toward Gettysburg. MD 32's northern terminus was rolled back to MD 31 around 1987. The state highway was truncated at the Westminster city limit in 2001 following the reconstruction of Main Street and its transfer to city maintenance. MD 32 was reconstructed and widened from Sykesville to Eldersburg starting in 1957 and from West Friendship to just south of Sykesville in 1958. The state highway's bypass of Sykesville was completed in 1963; the old road through the center of Sykesville became MD 851. MD 32's new bridge across the Patapsco River was the longest of only three aluminum triangular box beam girder bridges constructed in the United States. The girder system was topped by a concrete slab deck and underlain with standard concrete abutments and piers and steel bearing pads on which the aluminum girders rested. These bridges, which were designed by Fairchild Engine and Airplane Company, were constructed of aluminum due to that metal's light weight but similar strength compared to steel. Many experimental aluminum bridges were built due to a severe shortage of steel in the early 1960s. Aluminum bridges are rarely constructed because they are much more expensive than steel and concrete bridges. In the 1990s, MDSHA discovered the bridge's rarity while conducting a bridge inventory. The inventory also found premature deterioration of its supports due to galvanic corrosion involving the steel bearing pads and aluminum girder structure. Because repairing the structure would have been extremely difficult, MDSHA decided to build a replacement bridge immediately to the west of the aluminum bridge; the new bridge opened in 2004 along with a slight relocation in MD 32 on both sides of the bridge. The aluminum bridge was added to the state's Historic Bridge Registry and was left in place as a historic landmark after MD 32's new bridge over the Patapsco River opened. Patuxent Freeway MD 32 eastbound at the I-95 interchange in Savage In 1956, MD 32 was extended east on Guilford Road from US 1 to the Howard - Anne Arundel county line at Annapolis Junction. The state highway was relocated to its present alignment from Glenelg to Clarksville between 1961 and 1964, bypassing Ten Oaks Road. MD 32 was expanded to a four-lane divided highway in West Friendship when its interchange with I-70 was reconstructed as a diamond interchange in 1973. MD 32 was extended east into Anne Arundel County in 1969 when the designation was extended to just east of the Baltimore-Washington Parkway on the edge of Fort George G. Meade. The first two sections of what would become the Patuxent Freeway opened in 1972. A short section of divided highway opened from just west of Oakland Mills Road in Guilford to a turnaround just west of Vollmerhausen Road that included MD 32's modern interchange with I-95. The other section was a two- lane road from MD 175 in Odenton northeast along Sappington Station Road and then east along the current alignments of MD 32 and I-97 to MD 178 just east of I-97 Exit 5 in Crownsville. The eastern section, which from 1972 to 1977 was one of the three disjoint sections of mainline MD 32 between Crownsville and Taneytown, included an interchange with MD 3 in Millersville. As of 1978, MD 32's interchange with the Baltimore-Washington Parkway was a partial cloverleaf interchange with four ramps on the north side of MD 32--due to the state highway closely paralleling the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad's spur to the military base--and a fifth ramp from the northbound Parkway to eastbound MD 32\\\\. The MD 3 interchange included the ramps to and from MD 32 in the direction of Fort Meade plus a ramp from westbound MD 32 to northbound MD 3\\\\. All other movements were made via MD 178 or Millersville Road. Construction on the Patuxent Freeway resumed in 1981 in Howard County. The freeway opened from Dorsey Run Road to US 29 in 1985. The freeway was extended across the Middle Patuxent River to tie into the existing two-lane road near Cedar Lane by 1987. The new highway was extended east from Dorsey Run Road to just west of the Baltimore-Washington Parkway as a four-lane divided highway that same year. Sections of MD 32's old alignment became part of MD 732. The highway from Dorsey Run Road to the Parkway was upgraded to a freeway with the completion of interchanges at Dorsey Run Road and a ramp to Guilford Road in 1991. The interchange between MD 32 and the Baltimore-Washington Parkway was upgraded to a full cloverleaf around 1993. The final section of the Patuxent Freeway in Howard County opened from west of US 29 to west of MD 108 in 1996. I-97 was under construction from Annapolis to Millersville by 1987. When that section of the Interstate was completed in 1989, the highway took over the portion of MD 32 from MD 178 to MD 3\\\\. The easternmost portion of MD 32 became I-97's Exit 5 interchange ramps; the MD 3 interchange was upgraded to provide full access. Also in 1989, construction began on MD 32 between the Baltimore- Washington Parkway and I-97. MD 32 was extended as a four-lane divided highway along the existing road from the parkway east to MD 198 and as a two-lane road on a new alignment from MD 198 to MD 175\\\\. The sections of MD 32 from MD 198 to MD 175 west of Odenton and from Burns Crossing Road to I-97 were under construction to expand them to a freeway; the freeway segment from MD 175 to Burns Crossing Road on the north side of Odenton was also under construction. The freeway between MD 198 and MD 175 was complete by 1991. The remainder of the Patuxent Freeway from Fort Meade to Millersville was completed in 1993. In 2000, construction began on the gap in the Patuxent Freeway through Fort George G. Meade. MD 32's interchanges with MD 198 and Samford Road were completed in 2002. The MD 198 project involved extending the latter highway east along the northern edge of Tipton Airport so MD 198 could tie into the fort's Mapes Road entrance; the Mapes Road intersection east of MD 198 was also eliminated by the construction. The Patuxent Freeway through Fort Meade was finished when MD 32's interchange with Canine Road was completed in 2005. Sykesville Road upgrade MDSHA has long-term plans to upgrade MD 32 to a four-lane freeway from MD 108 to I-70. The first project, which involved constructing a modified dumbbell interchange to connect MD 32 with Burntwoods Road, Ten Oaks Road, Pfefferkorn Road, and Ivory Road in Glenelg, was completed in 2008. The next project involved the construction of a diamond interchange at Linden Church Road, which, before the dumbbell interchange was completed in the fall of 2013, met MD 32 at a pair of signalized, three-way directional crossover intersections between Glenelg and Clarksville. Several other interchanges will be constructed or modified: *At MDSHA's Dayton Shop south of Glenelg, a half-diamond interchange will be built on the southbound side of MD 32 and a right-in/right-out interchange constructed for northbound MD 32 traffic to access the maintenance facility. *North of Glenelg, Rosemary Lane will be extended west to cross over MD 32\\\\. The county highway will be connected to MD 32 via right-in/right-out interchanges between the state highway and frontage roads. *In West Friendship, northbound MD 32 would have half of a partial cloverleaf interchange with MD 144\\\\. Access between MD 144 and southbound MD 32 would be via a right-in/right-out interchange with a frontage road. MD 144's intersections with the frontage road and the ramps to and from northbound MD 32 will be roundabouts. *MD 32's interchange with I-70 will be transformed from a diamond interchange to a partial cloverleaf interchange with free-flowing ramps from MD 32 to I-70. Junction list MD 32 is signed east-west from I-97 in Millersville to MD 108 in Clarksville and north-south from MD 108 to Westminster. Auxiliary routes MD 32 has three existing auxiliary routes: *MD 32AA is the designation for Sappington Station Road, which runs from westbound MD 32 west to MD 175 in Odenton. The state highway begins at the westbound MD 32 exit ramp for Exit 3. MD 32AA merges with the entrance ramp to westbound MD 32 and intersects the northern section of Burns Crossing Road before crossing over MD 32\\\\. The state highway intersects the southern section of Burns Crossing Road and heads southwest to its terminus at a roundabout with MD 175 (Annapolis Road), Odenton Road, and Higgins Drive. *MD 32AH is the designation for Lodigiani Avenue, a spur east from Gambrills Road just south of Gambrills Road's overpass of MD 32 in Gambrills. *MD 32B is the designation for the unnamed connector between MD 32 and MD 851H, which is a spur of old alignment of MD 32 north of West Friendship.

Individual accounts are set up for participants and benefits are based on the amounts credited to these accounts (through employee contributions and, if applicable, employer contributions) plus any investment earnings on the money in the account. In defined contribution plans, future benefits fluctuate on the basis of investment earnings. The most common type of defined contribution plan is a savings and thrift plan. Under this type of plan, the employee contributes a predetermined portion of his or her earnings (usually pretax) to an individual account, all or part of which is matched by the employer. In the United States, specifies a defined contribution plan as a \\"plan which provides for an individual account for each participant and for benefits based solely on the amount contributed to the participant's account, and any income, expenses, gains and losses, and any forfeitures of accounts of other participants which may be allocated to such participant's account\\". Overview In a defined contribution plan, fixed contributions are paid into an individual account by employers and employees. The contributions are then invested, for example in the stock market, and the returns on the investment (which may be positive or negative) are credited to the individual's account. On retirement, the member's account is used to provide retirement benefits, sometimes through the purchase of an annuity which then provides a regular income. Defined contribution plans have become widespread all over the world in recent years and are now the dominant form of plan in the private sector in many countries. For example, the number of defined contribution plans in the US has been steadily increasing, as more and more employers see pension contributions as a large expense avoidable by disbanding the defined benefit plan and instead offering a defined contribution plan. Money contributed can either be from employee salary deferral or from employer contributions. The portability of defined contribution plans is legally no different from the portability of defined benefit plans. However, because of the cost of administration and ease of determining the plan sponsor's liability for defined contribution plans (no actuary is needed to calculate the lump sum equivalent unlike for defined benefit plans), in practice, defined contribution plans have become generally portable. In a defined contribution plan, investment risk and investment rewards are assumed by each individual/employee/retiree and not by the sponsor/employer. This risk could be substantial. Based on simulations from security returns over the twentieth century across 16 countries, there is considerable variation in retirement plan fund ratios across both time and country. Those countries keenest on individual DC accounts have the highest retirement plan fund ratios but all investors in all countries face considerable downside risk. Some countries such as France, Italy and Spain face a ten percent probability of having a real replacement ratio of 0.25, 0.20 and 0.17 respectively. In addition, DC scheme participants do not necessarily purchase annuities with their savings upon retirement and bear the risk of outliving their assets. The \\"cost\\" of a defined contribution plan is readily calculated, but the benefit from a defined contribution plan depends upon the account balance at the time an employee is looking to use the assets. So, for this arrangement, the contribution is known but the benefit is unknown (until calculated). Despite the fact that the participant in a defined contribution plan typically has control over investment decisions, the plan sponsor retains a significant degree of fiduciary responsibility over investment of plan assets, including the selection of investment options and administrative providers. By country Defined contribution plans are common in the United States, and exist in various other countries, including: the UK‚Äôs personal retirement plans and proposed National Employment Savings Trust (NEST), Germany‚Äôs Riester plans, Australia‚Äôs Superannuation system, and New Zealand‚Äôs KiwiSaver scheme. Individual retirement savings plans also exist in Austria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Georgia, Greece, Finland, Ireland, Japan, Korea, Netherlands, Slovenia and Spain. United States In the United States, the legal definition of a defined contribution plan is a plan providing for an individual account for each participant, and for benefits based solely on the amount contributed to the account, plus or minus income, gains, expenses and losses allocated to the account (see ). Examples of defined contribution plans in the US include 401(k) plans and Profit-sharing pension plans. The Thrift Savings Plan, open to all Federal employees and uniformed service members, is among the largest such plans. In such plans, the employee is often responsible for selecting the types of investments toward which the funds in the retirement plan are allocated. This may range from choosing one of a small number of pre-determined mutual funds to selecting individual stocks or other securities. Most defined contribution plans are characterized by certain tax advantages, and some provide for a portion of the employee's contributions to be matched by the employer, either automatically or at the employer's discretion. In exchange, the funds in such plans may not be withdrawn by the employee prior to reaching a certain age - typically the year the employee reaches 59.5 years old (with a small number of exceptions, such as retirement before that age) - without incurring a substantial penalty in addition to taxes. Congress has limited the amount that may be contributed annually to defined contribution plans. For 2019, the total deferral limit (which includes employer contributions, employee contributions to employer sponsored plans, and IRA contributions both deductible and non-deductible) is $56,000 or 100% of compensation, whichever is less, with a separate employee- only limit to employer sponsored plans of $19,000. Employees age 50So long as the employee turns 50 during a year, whether on January 1 or December 31, an employee may make catch-up contributions at any time during the year. or over may contribute an additional $6,000 which is not subject to the total deferral or employee limits. The amounts are indexed to compensate for the effects of inflation but increase only in multiples of $500, which means that in some years the amounts do not increase. United Kingdom In the UK the shift from defined benefit to defined contribution retirement plans has elevated significantly, to the point where many large DB plans are no longer open to new employees. This momentum has been employer-driven and is considered a response to a combination of factors such as pension underfunding,Investopedia, Underfunded Pensions Plan. January 2013. http://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underfunded_pension_plan.asp declined long-term interest rates and the move to more market-based accounting. The focus is now on managing pension fund assets in relation to liabilities instead of market benchmarks. The Pensions Policy Institute estimates that in 2013 there were approximately 8 million private sector workers building up DC benefits, compared to approximately 1 million building up DB benefits.Aon Hewitt, Defined Contribution Survey. December 2013. http://www.aon.com/unitedkingdom/defined-contribution/ However, one point of concern with these schemes is that employers often contribute less than what they would under final salary plans. According to the National Association of Pension Funds (NAPF), employers contribute on average 11% of salary into final salary schemes, compared to only 6% to money purchase.NAPF, Case studies from the changing world of occupational pensions, May 2007. http://www.napf.co.uk/PolicyandResearch/DocumentLibrary/~/media/Policy/Documents/0035_All_change_0507.ashx This indicates that individuals will have to save more of their own income into a retirement fund in order to accomplish a satisfactory retirement income. Companies such as Aon Hewitt, Mercer and Aviva recognise these challenges and have identified the need to help new generations of workers with their retirement funding plans. Budget 2014: All tax restrictions on retired people's access to their registered retirement pots are removed, ending the requirement to buy an annuity. The taxable part of the registered retirement pot is taken as cash on retirement to be charged at normal income tax rate(s). The increase in total registered retirement savings that people can take as a lump sum to ¬£30,000. Japan Defined contribution schemes have existed in Japan since October 2001, and as of March 2012 cover more than 4 million workers at about 16,400 companies.

Earlier employees were under Defined Benefit Plan. All Government and Private sector organizations had to offer Provident Fund (PF) which is a type of Defined Contribution Plan. The NPS which was started in 2004 is a recent option given to all Central Government employees. The 10% of contribution made by the employer and employees are mandated by the regulations. Additionally employees are given the ability to opt for an additional contribution if they so desire. All contributions are managed by the PF authority. PF authority choose the investment vehicle, however the beneficiaries are given a standard % of returns on their contribution. Some large private sector organizations have also formed their Trust to manage the contributions received from its employees.

Early life Alexander Brullov was born in Saint Petersburg into a family of French artists: his great grandfather, his grandfather, his father and his brothers (including Karl Brullov) were artists. His first teacher was his father Paul. He attended the Imperial Academy of Arts architecture class from 1810 to 1820, and graduated with honors. Along with his brother, Karl, he was sent to Europe to study art and architecture with a stipend from the Society for the Promotion of Artists. Career Alexander Brullov spent eight years abroad, from 1822 to 1830, in Italy, Germany and France, studying architecture and art. He painted many watercolor portraits at that time. Among the best were those of Yekaterina Pavlovna Bakunina, John Capodistria, Natalya Goncharova-Pushkina, wife of the Russian poet Alexander Pushkin and Yekaterina Ivanovna Zagryazhskaya, her aunt. He also did illustrations for books and magazines. In 1831, after his return to Russia, he was appointed professor at the Imperial Academy of Arts and these were the years when he created his best architectural projects.

Wigner (1902‚Äì1995), ForMemRS, first proved the theorem bearing his name. It was a key step towards the modern classification scheme of particle types, according to which particle types are partly characterized by which representation of the Lorentz group under which it transforms. The Lorentz group is a symmetry group of every relativistic quantum field theory. Wigner's early work laid the ground for what many physicists came to call the group theory disease in quantum mechanics - or as Hermann Weyl (co-responsible) puts it in his The Theory of Groups and Quantum Mechanics (preface to 2nd ed.), \\"It has been rumored that the group pest is gradually being cut out from quantum mechanics. This is certainly not true‚Ä¶\\" Wigner's theorem, proved by Eugene Wigner in 1931, (in German), (English translation). is a cornerstone of the mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics. The theorem specifies how physical symmetries such as rotations, translations, and CPT are represented on the Hilbert space of states. According to the theorem, any symmetry transformation of ray space is represented by a linear and unitary or antilinear and antiunitary transformation of Hilbert space. The representation of a symmetry group on Hilbert space is either an ordinary representation or a projective representation. Rays and ray space It is a postulate of quantum mechanics that vectors in Hilbert space that are scalar nonzero multiples of each other represent the same pure state. A ray is a set :\\\\underline{\\\\Psi} = \\\\left{e^{i\\\\alpha}\\\\Psi : \\\\alpha \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}, \\\\emptyset e \\\\Psi \\\\in \\\\mathcal{H}\\\\right}, and a ray whose vectors have unit norm is called a unit ray. If , then is a representative of . There is a one-to-one correspondence between physical pure states and unit rays.Here the possibility of superselection rules is ignored. It may be the case that a system cannot be prepared in specific states. For instance, superposition of states with different spin is generally believed impossible. Likewise, states being superpositions of states with different charge are considered impossible. Minor complications due to those issues are treated in The space of all rays is called ray space. Formally, if is a complex Hilbert space, then let be the subset :B = {\\\\Psi \\\\in \\\\mathcal{H}: \\\\lVert\\\\Psi\\\\rVert = 1} of vectors with unit norm. If is finite-dimensional with complex dimension , then has real dimension . Define a relation ‚âÖ on by :\\\\Psi \\\\cong \\\\Phi \\\\Leftrightarrow \\\\Psi = e^{i\\\\alpha}\\\\Phi,\\\\quad \\\\alpha \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}. The relation ‚âÖ is an equivalence relation on the set . Unit ray space, , is defined as the set of equivalence classes :S = B / {\\\\cong}. If is finite, has real dimension hence complex dimension . Equivalently for these purposes, one may define ‚âà on by :\\\\Psi \\\\approx \\\\Phi \\\\Leftrightarrow \\\\Psi = z\\\\Phi,\\\\quad z \\\\in \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\smallsetminus {0}, where is the set of nonzero complex numbers, and set :S^\\\\prime = \\\\mathcal{H} \\\\smallsetminus \\\\emptyset / {\\\\approx}. This definition makes it clear that unit ray space is a projective Hilbert space. It is also possible to skip the normalization and take ray space asThis approach is used in , which serves as a basis reference for the proof outline to be given below. :R = \\\\mathcal{H} \\\\smallsetminus \\\\emptyset / {\\\\cong}, where ‚âÖ is now defined on all of by the same formula. The real dimension of is if is finite. This approach is used in the sequel. The difference between and is rather trivial, and passage between the two is effected by multiplication of the rays by a nonzero real number, defined as the ray generated by any representative of the ray multiplied by the real number. Ray space is sometimes awkward to work with. It is, for instance, not a vector space with well-defined linear combinations of rays. But a transformation of a physical system is a transformation of states, hence mathematically a transformation of ray space. In quantum mechanics, a transformation of a physical system gives rise to a bijective unit ray transformation of unit ray space, :T: S i \\\\underline{\\\\Psi} \\\\subset \\\\mathcal{H} \\\\mapsto S' i \\\\underline{\\\\Psi'} = T\\\\underline{\\\\Psi} \\\\subset \\\\mathcal{H}'. The set of all unit ray transformations is thus the permutation group on . Not all of these transformations are permissible as symmetry transformations to be described next. A unit ray transformation may be extended to by means of the multiplication with reals described above according to defines general ray transformations on to begin with, which means that it is not necessarily bijective on (i.e. not necessarily norm preserving). This is not important since only symmetry transformations are of interest anyway. :T: R \\\\rightarrow R'; T\\\\left(\\\\lambda \\\\underline{\\\\Psi}\\\\right) \\\\equiv \\\\lambda T \\\\underline{\\\\Psi},\\\\quad \\\\underline{\\\\Psi} \\\\in S, \\\\lambda \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}. To keep the notation uniform, call this a ray transformation. This terminological distinction is not made in the literature, but is necessary here since both possibilities are covered while in the literature one possibility is chosen. Symmetry transformations Loosely speaking, a symmetry transformation is a change in which \\"nothing happens\\" or a \\"change of our view\\" that does not change the outcomes of possible experiments. For example, translating a system in a homogeneous environment should have no qualitative effect on the outcomes of experiments made on the system. Likewise for rotating a system in an isotropic environment. This becomes even clearer when one considers the mathematically equivalent passive transformations, i.e. simply changes of coordinates and let the system be. Usually, the domain and range Hilbert spaces are the same. An exception would be (in a non-relativistic theory) the Hilbert space of electron states that is subjected to a charge conjugation transformation. In this case the electron states are mapped to the Hilbert space of positron states and vice versa. To make this precise, introduce the ray product, :\\\\underline{\\\\Psi} \\\\cdot \\\\underline{\\\\Phi} = \\\\left\\\\left(\\\\Psi, \\\\Phi\\\\right)\\\\right, where is the Hilbert space inner product, and are normalized elements of this space. A surjective ray transformation is called a symmetry transformation if :T \\\\underline{\\\\Psi} \\\\cdot T\\\\underline{\\\\Phi} = \\\\underline{\\\\Psi} \\\\cdot \\\\underline{\\\\Phi},\\\\quad \\\\forall \\\\Psi, \\\\Phi \\\\in \\\\mathcal{H}. It can also be defined in terms of unit ray space; i.e., with no other changes. In this case it is sometimes called a Wigner automorphism. It can then be extended to by means of multiplication by reals as described earlier. In particular, unit rays are taken to unit rays. The significance of this definition is that transition probabilities are preserved. In particular the Born rule, another postulate of quantum mechanics, will predict the same probabilities in the transformed and untransformed systems, :P(\\\\Psi \\\\rightarrow \\\\Phi) = (\\\\Psi, \\\\Phi)^2 = \\\\left[\\\\underline{\\\\Psi} \\\\cdot \\\\underline{\\\\Phi}\\\\right]^2 = \\\\left[T\\\\underline{\\\\Psi} \\\\cdot T\\\\underline{\\\\Phi}\\\\right]^2 = \\\\left\\\\left(\\\\Psi', \\\\Phi'\\\\right)\\\\right^2 = P\\\\left(\\\\Psi' \\\\rightarrow \\\\Phi'\\\\right), \\\\quad \\\\Psi' \\\\in T\\\\underline{\\\\Psi}, \\\\Phi' \\\\in T\\\\underline{\\\\Phi}. It is clear from the definitions that this is independent of the representatives of the rays chosen. Symmetry groups Some facts about symmetry transformations that can be verified using the definition: * The product of two symmetry transformations, i.e. two symmetry transformations applied in succession, is a symmetry transformation. * Any symmetry transformation has an inverse. * The identity transformation is a symmetry transformation. * Multiplication of symmetry transformations is associative. The set of symmetry transformations thus forms a group, the symmetry group of the system. Some important frequently occurring subgroups in the symmetry group of a system are realizations of * The symmetric group with its subgroups. This is important on the exchange of particle labels. * The Poincar√© group. It encodes the fundamental symmetries of spacetime. * Internal symmetry groups like SU(2) and SU(3). They describe so called internal symmetries, like isospin and color charge peculiar to quantum mechanical systems. These groups are also referred to as symmetry groups of the system. Statement of Wigner's theorem=Preliminaries Some preliminary definitions are needed to state the theorem. A transformation of Hilbert space is unitary if :(U \\\\Psi, U \\\\Phi) = (\\\\Psi, \\\\Phi), and a transformation is antiunitary if :(A \\\\Psi, A \\\\Phi) = (\\\\Psi, \\\\Phi)^* = (\\\\Phi, \\\\Psi). A unitary operator is automatically linear. Likewise an antiunitary transformation is necessarily antilinear. This is stated but not proved. Both variants are real linear and additive. Given a unitary transformation of Hilbert space, define :T: \\\\underline{\\\\Psi} = \\\\left{e^{i\\\\alpha}\\\\Psi \\\\mid \\\\alpha \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}\\\\right} \\\\mapsto \\\\underline{\\\\Psi'} = \\\\left{e^{i\\\\beta} U\\\\Psi \\\\mid \\\\beta \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}\\\\right}. This is a symmetry transformation since : T\\\\underline{\\\\Psi} \\\\cdot T\\\\underline{\\\\Phi} = \\\\underline{\\\\Psi'} \\\\cdot \\\\underline{\\\\Phi'} = \\\\left\\\\left(e^{i\\\\alpha}U\\\\Psi, e^{i\\\\beta}U\\\\Phi\\\\right)\\\\right = (\\\\Psi, \\\\Phi) = \\\\underline{\\\\Psi} \\\\cdot \\\\underline{\\\\Phi}. In the same way an antiunitary transformation of Hilbert space induces a symmetry transformation. One says that a transformation of Hilbert space is compatible with the transformation of ray space if for all , :T\\\\underline{\\\\Psi} = \\\\left{e^{i\\\\alpha}U\\\\Psi \\\\mid \\\\alpha \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}\\\\right}, or equivalently :U\\\\Psi \\\\in T \\\\underline \\\\Psi. Transformations of Hilbert space by either a unitary linear transformation or an antiunitary antilinear operator are obviously then compatible with the transformations or ray space they induce as described. Statement Wigner's theorem states a converse of the above: : Wigner's theorem (1931): If and are Hilbert spaces and if :: T:\\\\underline{\\\\Psi} \\\\subset \\\\mathcal{H} \\\\mapsto \\\\underline{\\\\Psi'} \\\\subset \\\\mathcal{K} : is a symmetry transformation, then there exists a transformation which is compatible with and such that is either unitary or antiunitary if . If there exists a unitary transformation and an antiunitary transformation , both compatible with . Proofs can be found in , and . Antiunitary and antilinear transformations are less prominent in physics. They are all related to a reversal of the direction of the flow of time. Representations and projective representations A transformation compatible with a symmetry transformation is not unique. One has the following (additive transformations include both linear and antilinear transformations).This is proved in detail in . This is stated but not proved. : Theorem: If and are two additive transformations of onto , both compatible with the ray transformation with , then :: V = Ue^{i\\\\alpha}, \\\\alpha \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}. The significance of this theorem is that it specifies the degree of uniqueness of the representation on . On the face of it, one might believe that : Vh = Ue^{i\\\\alpha(h)}h, \\\\alpha \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}, h \\\\in \\\\mathcal{H} \\\\quad (\\\\text{wrong unless } \\\\alpha(h) \\\\text{ is const.}) would be admissible, with for , but this is not the case according to the theorem.There is an exception to this. If a superselection rule is in effect, then the phase may depend on in which sector of resides, see If is a symmetry group (in this latter sense of being embedded as a subgroup of the symmetry group of the system acting on ray space), and if with , then :T(f)T(g) = T(h), where the are ray transformations. From the last theorem, one has for the compatible representatives , :U(f)U(g) = \\\\omega(f, g)U(fg) = e^{i\\\\xi(f, g)}U(fg), where is a phase factor.Again there is an exception. If a superselection rule is in effect, then the phase may depend on in which sector of resides on which the operators act, see The function is called a -cocycle or Schur multiplier. A map satisfying the above relation for some vector space is called a projective representation or a ray representation. If , then it is called a representation. One should note that the terminology differs between mathematics and physics. In the linked article, term projective representation has a slightly different meaning, but the term as presented here enters as an ingredient and the mathematics per se is of course the same. If the realization of the symmetry group, , is given in terms of action on the space of unit rays , then it is a projective representation in the mathematical sense, while its representative on Hilbert space is a projective representation in the physical sense. Applying the last relation (several times) to the product and appealing to the known associativity of multiplication of operators on , one finds :\\\\begin{align} \\\\omega(f, g)\\\\omega(fg, h) &= \\\\omega(g, h)\\\\omega(f, gh), \\\\ \\\\xi(f, g) + \\\\xi(fg, h) &= \\\\xi(g, h) + \\\\xi(f, gh) \\\\quad (\\\\operatorname{mod} 2\\\\pi). \\\\end{align} They also satisfy :\\\\begin{align} \\\\omega(g, e) &= \\\\omega(e, g) = 1, \\\\ \\\\xi(g, e) &= \\\\xi(e, g) = 0 \\\\quad (\\\\operatorname{mod} 2\\\\pi), \\\\ \\\\omega\\\\left(g, g^{-1}\\\\right) &= \\\\omega(g^{-1}, g), \\\\ \\\\xi\\\\left(g, g^{-1}\\\\right) &= \\\\xi(g^{-1}, g) = 0 \\\\quad (\\\\operatorname{mod} 2\\\\pi). \\\\ \\\\end{align} Upon redefinition of the phases, :U(g) \\\\mapsto \\\\hat{U}(g) = \\\\eta(g)U(g) = e^{i\\\\zeta(g)}U(g), which is allowed by last theorem, one finds There is an error in this formula in the book. :\\\\begin{align} \\\\hat{\\\\omega}(g, h) &= \\\\omega(g, h)\\\\eta(g)\\\\eta(h)\\\\eta(gh)^{-1},\\\\ \\\\hat{\\\\xi}(g, h) &= \\\\xi(g, h) + \\\\zeta(g) + \\\\zeta(h) - \\\\zeta(gh) \\\\quad (\\\\operatorname{mod} 2\\\\pi),\\\\end{align} where the hatted quantities are defined by :\\\\hat{U}(f)\\\\hat{U}(g) = \\\\hat{\\\\omega}(f, g)\\\\hat{U}(fg) = e^{i\\\\hat{\\\\xi}(f,g)}\\\\hat{U}(fg). Utility of phase freedom The following rather technical theorems and many more can be found, with accessible proofs, in . The freedom of choice of phases can be used to simplify the phase factors. For some groups the phase can be eliminated altogether. * Theorem: If is semisimple and simply connected, then is possible. In the case of the Lorentz group and its subgroup the rotation group SO(3), phases can, for projective representations, be chosen such that . For their respective universal covering groups, SL(2,C) and Spin(3), it is according to the theorem possible to have , i.e. they are proper representations. The study of redefinition of phases involves group cohomology. Two functions related as the hatted and non-hatted versions of above are said to be cohomologous. They belong to the same second cohomology class, i.e. they are represented by the same element in , the second cohomology group of . If an element of contains the trivial function , then it is said to be trivial. The topic can be studied at the level of Lie algebras and Lie algebra cohomology as well. Assuming the projective representation is weakly continuous, two relevant theorems can be stated. An immediate consequence of (weak) continuity is that the identity component is represented by unitary operators.This is made plausible as follows. In an open neighborhood in the vicinity of the identity all operators can be expressed as squares. Whether an operator is unitary or antiunitary its square is unitary. Hence they are all unitary in a sufficiently small neighborhood. Such a neighborhood generates the identity. * Theorem: (Wigner 1939). The phase freedom can be used such that in a some neighborhood of the identity the map is strongly continuous. * Theorem (Bargmann). In a sufficiently small neighborhood of e, the choice is possible for semisimple Lie groups (such as , SO(3,1) and affine linear groups, (in particular the Poincar√© group). More precisely, this is exactly the case when the second cohomology group of the Lie algebra of is trivial.

Early life  Safi was given the name Sam Mirza when he was born. He was the son of Mohammad Baqer Mirza, the eldest son of Shah Abbas I, and Dilaram Khanum, a Georgian wife.Sussan Babaie and others: Slaves of the Shah (I.B. Tauris, 2003) p.104 In 1615, Abbas had Mohammed Baqer killed, fearing he was plotting against his life. Over the next few years, the suspicious Abbas killed or blinded his other sons, leaving his grandson Safi heir to the throne.  Reign  Rostom (also known as Rustam Khan), viceroy of Kartli, eastern Georgia, from 1633-1658. Safi was crowned on 28 January 1629 at the age of eighteen. He ruthlessly eliminated anyone he regarded as a threat to his power, executing almost all the Safavid royal princes as well as leading courtiers and generals. He paid little attention to the business of government and had no cultural or intellectual interests (he had never learned to read or write properly), preferring to spend his time drinking wine or indulging in his addiction to opium. Supposedly, however, he abhorred tobacco smoke as much as his grandfather did, going as far as to have those caught smoking tobacco in public killed by pouring molten lead in their mouths. The dominant political figure of Safi's reign was Saru Taqi, appointed grand vizier in 1634. Saru Taqi was incorruptible and highly efficient at raising revenues for the state, but he could also be autocratic and arrogant. Iran's foreign enemies took the opportunity to exploit Safi's perceived weakness. Despite firm initial Safavid successes and humiliating defeats in the Ottoman‚ÄìSafavid War (1623‚Äì1639) by Safi's grandfather and predecessor Shah Abbas the Great, the Ottomans, having had their economy and military stabilized and reorganized under Sultan Murad IV made incursions in the west in one year following Safi's ascension to the throne. In 1634 they briefly occupied Yerevan and Tabriz and in 1638 they finally succeeded in recapturing Baghdad Reconquest of Baghdad (1638) and other parts of Mesopotamia (Iraq) which, despite being taken again several times later on in history by the Persians and most notably by Nader Shah, it would all remain in their hands until the aftermath of World War I. Nevertheless, the Treaty of Zuhab which ensued in 1639 put an end to all further wars between the Safavids and the Ottomans. Apart from the Ottoman wars, Iran was troubled by the Uzbeks and Turkmens in the east and briefly lost Kandahar in their easternmost territories to the Mughals in 1638, due to what seems as an act of revenge by their own governor over the region, Ali Mardan Khan, after being dismissed from office.Kohn 2007, p. 338 In 1636 he received a trade delegation from Frederick III, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp, which included Adam Olearius. Olearius wrote a book about this visit in 1647, which was widely published in Europe. In 1639, Safi sent a return delegation to Holstein-Gottorp, bestowing gifts on the Duke. However, the Duke did not succeed in his ultimate aim - starting a regular trading relationship with Iran (and Russia) and making the Duke's newly-founded town of Friedrichstadt into a European trade terminus. Safi died on 12 May 1642 and was buried in Qom. He was succeeded by his son Abbas II. His death was related to heavy drinking. According to one account, found in Archangelo Lamberti's Relation de la Colchide ou Mengrellie (1654), Safi died in a drinking contest with a certain Scedan Cilaze (Chiladze), a renowned Georgian drinking champion invited to Isfahan from Mingrelia.

(Trademark of Youth) is a German futurepop/synthpop band. The project was formerly known as Evils Toy, which was closer to electro-industrial in sound. History=As Evils Toy Evils Toy started out in 1992 as the project of Volker Lutz and Thorsten Brenda. Thorsten and Volker were introduced by a mutual friend who knew that each of the duo were heavily into industrial music and were already working on music of their own. After completing several tracks together they sent a demo tape to several labels, including the German Hypnobeat label (a sub-label of Hyperium Records) who released their debut album Human Refuse at the end of 1993. Their second full- length release, Morbid Mind, was released a year later and was recorded at Andr√© Schmechta's T.G.I.F. Studios, known for recording works by Andr√©'s project X-Marks the Pedwalk and many other well-known German EBM and industrial bands. This studio collaboration with Andr√© also yielded an XMTP remix of \\"Dear God\\" that was included on the album. Their combination of distorted vocals and EBM rhythms with occasional touches of melody proved relatively successful, though their real breakthrough came in 1995 with their \\"Organics\\" single, which received significant airplay on both sides of the Atlantic. The Illusion album, released in 1997, was the last album by this act that might accurately be defined as \\"industrial\\". The Angels Only! album, released the following year, moved away from distorted vocals and towards a more synthpop style. This was the first Evils Toy recording to feature Oliver Taranczewski, as well as the last recorded with Thorsten Brenda. For background vocals and live keyboards Volker brought in his long-time girlfriend Cordula K, who also appears in the videos for \\"Virtual State\\" and \\"Dream With Me\\". Silvertears in 2000 was the last release under the name Evils Toy. The project was known as \\"T.O.Y.\\" thereafter. As T.O.Y. Soon after renaming themselves, the re-formed band released their first album: Space Radio, which defined a fresh and revitalized style. Their second album under the name, White Lights, was diverse and followed a similar line that was familiar to listeners of the previous album. The band have produced many remixes for other bands like Apoptygma Berzerk, In Strict Confidence, De/Vision and !Bang Elektronika. Volker has also undertaken many album productions in his SonicStage Recording Studios. He has worked with bands like And One, L'√Çme Immortelle, Funker Vogt and Pulcher Femina. In 2004 Volker made a song for the German radio play The three investigators-Song contest. Also in 2004, the computer game giant Konami used a special song done by T.O.Y. on the new PS2 & Xbox release: Dance Dance Revolution Ultramix 2. The track was a remix of the popular DDR and Beatmania IIDX song \\"i feel...\\" by famous game music composer, Akira Yamaoka. Bands like Neuropa, Echo Image, Alien#Six13 and Midihead also contributed to the soundtrack. In 2005 Oliver released an album under the name Yavin 4 in the US. An album sounding more like the older Evils Toy releases mixed with modern dance and drum & bass elements. Also he produced the Cruciform Injection album Aftermath that was released in 2006 After split-up rumours concerning the future of T.O.Y. they are, in fact, working on new songs. All such songs are more or less raw demos, some with vocals, some without, but represent the kind of music fans expect to hear on the next T.O.Y. release. In May 2009 Taranczewski left the band for good. Volker said he would finish the album, entitled PAIN IS LOVE, on his own.Volker Lutz on Facebook After Taranczewski's departure, Markus Helmert and Christian \\"L√©o\\" Leonhardt joined Volker, playing keyboards and drums, respectively. In September 2014, Helmert had to quit the band due to health reasons. About the same time, Taranczewski re-joined the band as a keyboardist, while Leonhardt was replaced by Marc A. Nathaniel on drums. Together the new/old lineup will finish the upcoming album Pain is Love as well playing live gigs.Official T.O.Y.

Though not a supervillain, his mercenary activities often bring him into conflict with superheroes. Publication history Paladin first appeared in Daredevil #150 (January 1978), with follow-up appearances in #152 (May 1978) and #154 (September 1978) as part of the same story arc. The character had a one-shot story published in Marvel Premiere #43 (August 1978), and was a billed guest star in the Spider-Man team-up title Marvel Team-Up #108 (August 1981). From there on, Paladin has mostly appeared as a guest star across the Marvel Universe,http://www.comics.org/character/name/paladin/sort/chrono/ with occasional forays as a superteam member, in Silver Sable and the Wild Pack, Heroes for Hire and Thunderbolts, and occasional feature appearances in the Marvel Comics Presents anthology. Fictional character biography Paladin is a mercenary and private investigator, whose past is largely unrevealed. When first seen, he sought Daredevil while engaged in an assignment to track down the Purple Man, and battled Daredevil. He clashed with Daredevil a second time after the crime fighter inadvertently interfered with Paladin's search for the Purple Man. Paladin allied with Daredevil in battle against the Cobra, the Jester, and Mister Hyde, who were under control of the Purple Man.Daredevil #152, 154 Paladin next battled the Ghost.Marvel Premiere #43 Paladin aided the Wasp against Baron Brimstone, acquired a modified uniform, and began a romance with the Wasp.Avengers #251 Paladin aided the Avengers in battle against the Masters of Evil.Avengers #271 Paladin allied with Spider-Man and the Wasp against mobsters; despite respecting Spider-Man's abilities, Paladin is incredulous that Spider-Man offers his heroic services without charge (Paladin literally laughs in Spider-Man's face upon learning thisMarvel Team-Up #108), while Spider-Man in turn is disgusted by Paladin's mercenary ways.Spectacular Spider-Man #105-106 Paladin also considers Spider-Man's incessant battle banter \\"unprofessional\\".Heroes for Hire #6 Paladin was later employed by Silver Sable to investigate a conspiracy which threatened her native country of Symkaria, and he allied with Spider-Man.Amazing Spider-Man #320-321 Paladin was then hired by Diamondback to raid Serpent Society headquarters. He was captured, but freed by Captain America.Captain America #381-382 Paladin accompanied Captain America in his search for Diamondback, the Asp, and Black Mamba. With his new allies, Paladin battled Superia's horde of female superhumans.Captain America #386-392 An unabashed womanizer, Paladin often flirted with whoever woman caught his eye. He briefly dated the Wasp at a time when she was separated from Hank Pym, much to the Black Knight's jealousy, who was also attracted to her. For a time, he also enlisted Generation X into helping him retrieve a sword for Adrienne Frost, the sister of current X-Men member Emma Frost. During this period, the mutant known as Jubilee was strongly attracted to Paladin, but that affection disappeared when Generation X and Paladin later went their separate ways. He has also been a longtime ally to Silver Sable and her Wild Pack organization, working for pay, of course. He once helped them protect a scientist from a kidnapping attempt by the Heroes for Hire, a group he would later join. His main opponent was Misty Knight, who seemed to be an equal match. Paladin had exhibited a certain amount of honor in some cases. For example, he was once hired by a corrupt government to assist rebels as part of a sting operation. He aided the rebels in a bomb- laying operation at a government facility. When the rebels were caught, his government handler remarked how lucky they were that the bomb had not gone off. Paladin replied, \\"I'm sorry, that would have been extra,\\" and activated the bomb by remote control while driving away.Amazing Fantasy, Vol 2, #16 In the 1990 one-shot The Punisher: No Escape, he was offered 10 million dollars by mobster Vincent Mangano to kill the Punisher. Paladin agreed to this arrangement, but did not succeed, and in the ensuing fight both of his legs were broken by the U.S. Agent. Paladin once took down Daredevil with a sniper rifle from a helicopter at a great distance. He did so for the FBI, in exchange for getting his record expunged. The hit, while serious, was not fatal; Paladin's sniper attack led to Daredevil's arrest.Daredevil issue 79 by Brian Michael Bendis on November 23, 2005 Paladin was a main character in the 2006 Heroes for Hire series, although as Misty Knight said he was just there for the money. As it turns out, he was a traitor to the group, only using the Heroes as a means to hunt down Captain America for S.H.I.E.L.D. as part of the Civil War. He single-handedly defeated Captain America and the entire Heroes for Hire team, with the exceptions of Tarantula, and Orka, who weren't present when the fight took place, with a special gas weapon that affected the nervous system. He then radioed S.H.I.E.L.D. and told them he had Captain America in custody.Heroes for Hire v2 #2 However, he did not account for Shang-Chi's ability to hold his breath over an extended period (thanks to his martial arts training) and was overpowered by him. Shang-Chi then aided Captain America, who afterwards switched his costume with Paladin, causing S.H.I.E.L.D. to take Paladin instead into custody.Heroes for Hire v2 #3 In the Dark Reign storyline, Paladin became a member of the post-Secret Invasion Thunderbolts, serving as Norman Osborn's personal black ops team. Hired to assassinate Elektra for 82 million dollars, Paladin broke into H.A.M.M.E.R. headquarters. However, Elektra overpowered him by choking him with one of her teeth that was loosened when Paladin punched her. Begging for his life, Paladin gave Elektra the key to escape her prison.Dark Reign: Elektra #1 During the Siege of Asgard, Paladin and the other Thunderbolts were sent to Asgard with the mission of stealing the Spear of Odin for Osborn. After fighting through a contingent of Asgardians, they managed to find the Spear of Odin. Paladin, finally having had enough of serving a madman like Osborn, turned on his teammates and tried to take back the object. After being attacked by fellow Thunderbolt Grizzly, Paladin was saved by Ant-Man. Grizzly then lost the Spear of Odin to Mr. X who in turn was easily defeated by Quicksilver. Ant-Man recovered the Spear of Odin and gave it to Paladin who decided to take the object in order to keep Osborn from using its power for his own ends. Paladin then departed from Asgard after saying goodbye to Ant-Man.Thunderbolts #143 During the Shadowland storyline, Paladin is paired with Silver Sable, Misty Knight, and Shroud when Daredevil's Hand ninjas end up targeting members of the mafia.Shadowland: Blood on the Streets #1 Following this, Misty Knight reopens Heroes for Hire under the influence of Puppet Master; Paladin joins the team and soon realizes this and frees Misty from Puppet Master's control with the help from Iron Fist. After the defeat of Puppet Master, Paladin convinces Misty to keep the operation open, but under their terms.Heroes for Hire Vol. 3 #1-5 Powers and abilities Paladin's physical strength, speed, stamina, agility, reflexes, and durability are all slightly superhuman. He is also a highly skilled hand-to-hand combatant, with knowledge of Boxing,All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Update #3 (September 2007) Judo, Savate,Heroes for Hire vol. 3 #6 (July 2011) and Taekwondo. In addition, Paladin is a skilled marksman, actor, espionage agent, bodyguard and detective. While he has been written using lethal force, his preferred weapon is his stun gun, which fires a beam which scrambles the signals within the target's nervous system sufficiently to render most people unconscious. The range and effectiveness are unknown. The gun is equipped so that only Paladin may operate it. Paladin wears a body-suit of synthetic stretch fabric, and his boots, gloves, helmet, torso, and knee and elbow guards are made of bulletproof composite materials. Paladin's helmet is equipped with a belt activated faceplate which slides down to make the helmet airtight, and has its own one-hour air supply. The lenses in Paladin's helmet can be adjusted for infrared vision. Other versions=Ultimate Marvel The Ultimate Marvel version of Marc Spector used the Paladin name for a period of time while working for the Roxxon Corporation.Ultimate Spider-Man #80 In other media=Television Paladin makes his animated debut in the 2017 Spider-Man animated series, voiced by Trevor Devall. He is a member of the Wild Pack. In the episode \\"Take Two\\", Paladin pretends to steal from Oscorp so that he can fight Spider-Man in order for Silver Sable to study his moves. Though he is webbed up, Paladin later frees himself and joins the Wild Pack into stealing the Neuro Cortex from Horizon High. During Spider-Man and Doctor Octopus' fight with the Wild Pack, Spider-Man tricks Paladin and Battlestar into taking each other out with their weapons. When the Wild Pack is placed in prison, Paladin asks Sable if this was part of the plan. She states that their anonymous client has plans for the Neuro Cortex.

Goetz, 68 N.Y.2d 96 (N.Y. 1986), \\"one of the most controversial cases in recent American history\\", was a court case involving subjective and objective standards of reasonableness in using deadly force for self- defense.Criminal Law - Cases and Materials, 7th ed. 2012, Wolters Kluwer Law & Business; John Kaplan, Robert Weisberg, Guyora Binder, , The final decision was written by Chief Judge Sol Wachtler in the New York Court of Appeals (the highest court in the state). While the decision does not mention it, this case sparked a media frenzy at the time due to the circumstances of the underlying incident. The defendant, Bernhard Goetz, was both vilified and exalted in the press and in public opinion.Magnuson, E., et al; Up in Arms Over Crime (Time, April 8, 1985) __TOC__ Grand Jury testimony As this decision was issued prior to a final disposition in the case, the facts presented here were still in dispute and the Court summarized the testimony given before the Grand Jury. The incident concerned a mass shooting that occurred in New York City on December 22, 1984. Four young black men (Troy Canty, Darryl Cabey, James Ramseur, and Barry Allen) boarded a New York City Subway car in the Bronx. Two of the men were carrying screwdrivers in their coats, which they later admitted were planned to be used to break into arcade game coin boxes. Bernhard Goetz, a white man, boarded the train in Manhattan, and sat near the four men. He was carrying an unlicensed .38 caliber pistol on a waistband holster, which was loaded with five rounds of ammunition. Canty approached Goetz and told him to give them five dollars. At this point, Goetz stood up, unholstered his pistol, and quickly fired four shots. Three of the men were hit, while Cabey was not struck. Goetz then fired another shot at Cabey, severing his spinal cord. Goetz fled the scene and on December 31 surrendered himself to the police in New Hampshire. He gave two lengthy statements to the police. Goetz admitted to carrying an unlicensed pistol in New York City since 1981, which he purchased after he was injured during a mugging. Goetz stated that when he was approached by the men on December 22, he could tell that they wanted to \\"play with me.\\" Although he did not believe any of the men were armed, he stated that he feared that he would be \\"maimed.\\" Goetz established a \\"pattern of fire,\\" firing from left to right. He admitted to shooting Cabey with his last bullet after the initial barrage. History The case, defended by Barry Slotnick, was presented to a Grand Jury, which returned an indictment on January 25, 1985, charging Goetz with one count of Criminal Possession of a Weapon in the Third Degree, and two counts of Criminal Possession of a Weapon in the Fourth Degree. The Grand Jury dismissed charges of Attempted Murder, Assault, and Reckless Endangerment. The prosecutor later sought permission from the court to resubmit the case to another Grand Jury with additional evidence. On March 27, 1985, the second Grand Jury returned an indictment charging Goetz with four counts of Attempted Murder, four counts of Assault, one count of Reckless Endangerment, and one count of Criminal Possession of a Weapon in the Third Degree. This indictment was consolidated with the prior indictment. On October 14, 1985, Goetz moved to dismiss the second indictment, claiming that the prosecutor's instructions with respect to the issue of justification were erroneous and prejudicial. While the motion was pending, a columnist with the New York Daily News interviewed Cabey in the hospital. Cabey told the columnist that the men had approached Goetz with the intention of robbing him. The following day, one of the first police officers on the scene informed the prosecutor that Cabey had admitted to him that the men intended to rob Goetz. The prosecutor informed the court and defendant about this communication. Goetz then expanded his motion to dismiss to include the claim that Ramseur and Canty, who had testified before the Grand Jury, must have committed perjury. On January 21, 1986, the Criminal Term court granted the defendant's motion to dismiss with respect to all counts except for the reckless endangerment charge, with leave to represent to a third Grand Jury. The reasoning by the court was that the prosecutor, when charging the Grand Jury with respect to the justification defense, incorrectly told the Grand Jury that they must consider whether Goetz's actions were those of a \\"reasonable man in [Goetz's] situation\\". The court held that this charge created an objective test of Goetz's beliefs. The court held that the test for whether the use of deadly force is justified should be entirely subjective, focused on the defendant's state of mind at the time of the incident. An additional reason given by the court for dismissal was that it was extremely likely that the Grand Jury based their decision on perjured testimony, pursuant to the Daily News article and the subsequent statement by the police officer. On April 17, 1986, the Appellate Division affirmed the decision of the lower court, prompting the appeal to the New York Court of Appeals. Opinion of the Court Judge Sol Wachtler wrote for a unanimous court. The Court held that to use an entirely subjective test to determine whether a defendant appropriately used deadly physical force would be very dangerous, in that it would permit a jury to acquit every defendant who believed that his actions were reasonable, regardless of how bizarre the rationale. The Court explained that the justification statute requires an objective element, in that deadly physical force is only permissible if a reasonable person would believe that he is in imminent fear of serious physical injury or death. This would prevent the slippery slope of a different reasonable test necessary for every single defendant claiming justification. With respect to the lower court's alternate theory for dismissal, the perjury issue, the Court held that there was no basis for the lower court to suspect perjury, and that there was no basis in statute or case law permitting a dismissal merely because new information comes to light which may lead a defendant's acquittal. Therefore, the Court reversed the lower court on both grounds, and reinstated all counts of the indictment. Standard for justification The standard for justification shifted after rulings in the case. Jurors are now told to consider a defendant's background and to consider whether a reasonable person would feel imperiled if that reasonable person was the defendant. Aftermath The jury in the criminal trial acquitted Goetz of all the charges except criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree. One of the victims of the shooting, Darrell Cabey, who remained paralyzed, sued Goetz, represented by Kuby, who later went on to defend Long Island Rail Road mass murderer Colin Ferguson. The jury found in favor of Cabey and awarded him the sum of $18,000,000 in compensatory damages and $25,000,000 in punitive damages.\\"Arizona Daily Wildcat\\"; Jury hands down $43M verdict in lawsuit against Goetz (\\"Associated Press\\", August 2, 2004) Goetz declared bankruptcy in 1996, freeing himself from an estimated $16m in legal debts, but not from the $43m judgment.

It is composed of demo tracks recorded by Donovan in 1964. Sixty Four was released in the United States in February 2004 by Donovan Discs, his own record label. History In the summer of 1964, Donovan negotiated his first record contract with Pye Records and recorded several demo songs. At the time, these demos were intended to circulate within the record company and were not intended for public release. The tapes were subsequently archived and their existence was relatively unknown to the public. When Donovan was assisting with the compilation of his first compact disc boxed set Troubadour: The Definitive Collection 1964-1976 in the early 1990s, he gained possession of the original demos. Two of the songs were released on the boxed set; covers of Tim Hardin's \\"London Town\\" and Buffy Sainte-Marie's \\"Co'dine\\". The remainder of the tapes remained unreleased. After the release of Sutras in 1996, Donovan focused on reorganizing his business around his own website and launching his own independent music label, Donovan Discs. Donovan Discs issued the set of demos as Sixty Four exclusively through Donovan's new website. A limited number of copies were signed by Donovan and also sold from the website. The demo tapes feature an 18-year-old Donovan playing guitar and mouth harp. His style is remarkably close to that of both Woody Guthrie and Bob Dylan, but the songs also feature a distinct style that further developed on Donovan's first two albums, What's Bin Did and What's Bin Hid and Fairytale.

Resulting from the merger of the Directorate for Asylum Support Services and the Refugee Agency (which was part of the Department of Foreign Affairs), it is part of the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth. It was formerly part of the Department of Justice The IPAS is responsible for coordinating the provision of services to both asylum seekers and refugees, coordinating the implementation of integration policy for all refugees and persons granted leave to remain in the Republic of Ireland and responding to crisis situations which may result in large numbers of refugees arriving in the country. After a government decision of 2 March 2004, RIA was assigned responsibility for supporting the repatriation, on an ongoing basis for the Department of Social Protection, of nationals of the ten new EU member states (Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia) who might fail the Habitual Residency Condition attaching to Social Assistance Payments.  Direct Provision  One of the tasks of the RIA under the Government's policy of direct provision is to provide residential accommodation and ancillary services to asylum seekers while they await the outcome of their applications for asylum in the country. To meet this requirement, the Accommodation Procurement Unit of the agency has contracted various private companies to provide these services at several accommodation centres on the country, the largest being at Mosney. The system has been criticised by human rights organisations as illegal, inhuman and degrading.

Art by Romero. Axa was the title of a newspaper comic strip featuring the eponymous lead character, which was published in British daily tabloid The Sun from 1978 to 1986. It was written by Donne Avenell and drawn by Romero. Publication history Commissioned by The Sun in 1978, the series was designed as a daily three-panel adventure strip. The Sun abruptly cancelled the strip midway through a story in 1986. Romero created 2238 strips in black/white before the comic was cancelled. The last strip published in The Sun was number 2234. It was published on November 16, 1985 (according to the Ken Pierce re-production of the Axa comic in book #9). Romero also produced a long story in full color which was published in the Spanish magazine Creepy, in issuess #52-59 (1983-1984). Romero returned to draw his previous series, Modesty Blaise, but also took Axa to the American company Eclipse Comics, who published a two issue series of new adventures, though this time with much less nudity and Chuck Dixon as writer. Another comic book version of Axa was later produced for the Swedish comic magazine Magnum. All the strips from The Sun have been reprinted in trade paperback format by Ken Pierce Books. In January 2011, a mobile phone game was released based on the Axa character. The game targets mainly Nokia phones, but is written in Java and is therefore expandable to other platforms. Synopsis Opening on a post-apocalyptic Earth in the year 2080, Axa is a woman who, having grown sick of the regimented and stifling society inside a domed city, flees into the untamed wilderness. The strip mixed elements of science fiction and sword-swinging barbarian tales. However, it is arguable that the strip's main draw were the frequent depictions of the full-figured Axa's tendency to wind up topless or fully nude, as rendered by good-girl artist Romero.

Horsted Keynes on the Bluebell Railway  Precursor companies  The city of Leeds was one of the earliest centres of locomotive building; Matthew Murray built the first commercially successful steam locomotive, Salamanca, in Holbeck, Leeds, in 1812. By 1856, a number of manufacturers had sprung up in the city, including Kitson and Company, the Railway Foundry, and E. B. Wilson and Company.  Manning Wardle  Ayresome No 12 by Manning Wardle & Co. Ltd E.B.Wilson and Company operated in Leeds from 1838 to 1858. The company‚Äôs designs were purchased by Manning Wardle & Company, who located their Boyne Engine Works (established in 1840) in Jack Lane in the Hunslet district of the city. Within the next few years, two other companies, the Hunslet Engine Company and Hudswell, Clarke & Company also opened premises in Jack Lane. There was a good deal of staff movement between the three firms, leading to similar designs leaving all three works. Whilst Hudswell Clarke and Hunslet Engine Company built a wide variety of locomotive types, Manning Wardle concentrated on specialised locomotives for contractor‚Äôs use, building up a range of locomotives suitable for all types of contracting work. Many Manning Wardle locomotives ‚Äì of standard gauge and various narrow gauges ‚Äì were exported to Europe, Africa, the Middle East (e.g. the Palestine Railways Class M), the Indian sub-continent, Australasia (e.g. NZR Wh class) and South America.  Decline and closure  The company employed traditional construction throughout its existence, and failed to take advantage of the more efficient mass production techniques becoming available. As a result, Manning Wardle became more uncompetitive. The company ceased trading in 1927, after producing more than 2,000 steam locomotives. The last complete locomotive was No. 2047, a standard gauge delivered to Rugby Cement Works in August 1926. This locomotive was initially preserved at the Kidderminster Railway Museum on static display, but has now been moved to the Severn Valley Railway's workshop Bridgnorth to be dismantled and assessed for a return to working order. It will need a new boiler at least. Dismantling started in September 2011 and the old boiler is now in the SVR Boiler Shop so design work on a new boiler can begin.  Acquisition  Following closure in 1926, the company's drawings, designs, equipment and customers were acquired by Kitsons who made twenty three locos of Manning Wardle designs until they also closed in 1938. The patterns were passed to Robert Stephenson and Hawthorne who built a further five locos of Manning Wardle design. Today the Manning Wardle designs are owned by the Hunslet-Barclay, who are still a provider of services to the rail industry, based in Kilmarnock, Scotland. The intellectual property rights for historic locomotive designs are held by the Hunslet Engine Company. The trademark name Manning Wardle is owned by a company formed in 1999 to preserve the name for the Lynton & Barnstaple Railway, which from 1898 to 1935 operated what have become some of the company's most famous products, narrow gauge engines: Exe, Taw, Yeo and later Lew.

His story is set some 400 years in the future in an apocalyptic world some time after Armageddon where the Devil Phlegethonyarre has his servant, Abaddon the Angel of the Bottomless Pit and their Undead Army of Nightmares (Necro-Soldiers, Zombies powered by Hell's Darklight) dominate and hunt all humans. Daniel's life was an abusive one for the young man: he killed his abusive/drunken father with a laser rifle in order to protect his mother and sister, Madrid. He consequently spends most of his teen years and a portion of his 20s in various prison facilities on the Moons of Mars and Earth. During his time behind bars, he falls in love with a female Public Defender named \\"Mrs. Noon,\\" with whom he has a strong but short love, as she is apparently killed because of him for an unknown reason. Daniel's memories of his past are mostly filled with pain and anger, of being shocked with tazer-prods in prison or murdering a Crater-Gang thug by smashing the face-mask of his spacesuit with a rock. At some point Daniel Llanso escapes from a lunar prison in a stolen freighter, but as the story points out, the cargo on board was 'Fetid' or, more likely, booby-trapped. Daniel Llanso dies as his spaceship burns up in the Earth's atmosphere; his space suit melts and his flesh burns. He screams as his soul falls burning into the darkness of damnation ending deep within the Twelfth Level of Hell. Having died and resurrected as a Hellspawn, Daniel is at first lost in a blur of treacherous memory and whispers to do evil deeds and use his energy to violent ends. The Hellspawn rises from the barren earth just in time to stop a large demon from killing his sister and her son Matthew. Daniel instantly recognizes her, but not his nephew. She then fires her Energy rifle at the Hellspawn as Madrid and Matt escape. Spawn is left alone only to be 'found' by Abaddon who goads Spawn to kill the last humans on Earth. Spawn agrees. The forces of evil, now gathered within Vatican City, are led by the \\"Anti-Pope\\", who summons a demon named Bune to attack a human stronghold, while Abaddon goads Spawn to kill human soldiers and become Hell's General. Daniel resists at every turn, remembering the promise he made the last time he saw his sister alive: to never give up on himself. Abaddon reveals to Spawn that the Anti- Pope has already sent Death to claim Madrid and Matt, Spawn removes his mask and sees what he has become in a pool of water. In a moment of anger, he is confronted by his master Phlegethonyarre who admits to Daniel that his fate was sealed from the beginning and using his new necro powers consumes a part of his soul. The hellspawn Daniel races against time to rescue Madrid and her son Matt from an army of 'Navkies'(undead children) under the command of Bune. Phlegethonyarre gloats to Abaddon that once Spawn kills Madrid & Matthew the REAL Game can begin. The story arc during Curse of the Spawn ends on a cliffhanger. Daniel rescues his sister yet discovers that Matthew was kidnapped by Abaddon and taken to \\"The Tower\\". Spawn battles Bune and ultimately kills him with his own scythe. Spawn races to the top of the tower only to find Abaddon waiting, preparing Matthew for a demonic sacrifice. Abaddon gives Spawn the chance to 'save' Matt's soul by killing him so he'll go to heaven (though this is probably a lie); instead, Spawn talks to Matt and tells him to picture the place he most wants to be, teleporting Matt back to his mother, who flee while Spawn confronts Abaddon. Spawn and Abaddon battle and Spawn appears to win by using his Darklight energy to completely destroy the tower and Abaddon in one huge blast. Daniel, Madrid, Matthew and a few other minor characters survive the end of the story arc. The story concludes in its own miniseries called Spawn: Blood & Salvation. Issues 5-29 The rest of the Curse of the Spawn issues focuses around related characters from the main Spawn series, like Jessica Priest, Sam and Twitch, The Angel Abdiel and Angela, Hatchet a Zombie Spawn, and other tales of other hell throughout the comics timelines. Some of these stories include; An angel named Abdiel sent to spy on Malebolgia is tricked and banished from heaven, A Greek boy named Raenius, who was killed by Zeus (the god) and resurrected as a Hellspawn, who kills Zeus with the gorgon Medusa by his side.

Following an accidental soaking of the court by a fire sprinkler, Smits re-donated a new court. A display honoring Smits, including an Indiana Pacers jersey, can be found next to the basketball court. Another capital improvement in 2005 included the introduction of a NBA-style scorer's table. This project featured enhanced seating along the North baseline and an imposing high student section along the south baseline. The student section and pep band have seats located less than from the baseline, creating an imposing and loud student section. A summer 2011 renovation to the field house upgraded the facility to more modern standards for the college's Division 1 indoor-athletics programs. The original bleachers were removed and replaced with chair-back seating, with corner seating added to maintain capacity and to create more of an atmosphere typically seen at a sports arena. The floor was replaced with a new, all-maple hardwood surface; the lobby and restrooms were renovated, and an addition to the south end of the field house provides new men's and women's locker rooms, as well as offices for both basketball teams. The project designer was Robert A.M. Stern Architects while construction was managed by Kirchoff Consigli. The new floor was retrofit with a ScissorLoc‚Ñ¢ DC subfloor system by Aacer Sports Flooring, complete with the PowerVent‚Ñ¢ airflow system to ensure environmental control below the Northern Hard Rock Maple surface. Additionally video scoreboards were added in two opposite corners of the arena and a video table was added.

WRN is a member of the RecQ Helicase family. Helicase enzymes generally unwind and separate double-stranded DNA. These activities are necessary before DNA can be copied in preparation for cell division (DNA replication). Helicase enzymes are also critical for making a blueprint of a gene for protein production, a process called transcription. Further evidence suggests that Werner protein plays a critical role in repairing DNA. Overall, this protein helps maintain the structure and integrity of a person's DNA. The WRN gene is located on the short (p) arm of chromosome 8 between positions 12 and 11.2, from base pair 31,010,319 to base pair 31,150,818.  Structure and function  WRN is a member of the RecQ Helicase family. It is the only RecQ Helicase that contains 3' to 5' exonuclease activity. These exonuclease activities include degradation of recessed 3' ends and initiation of DNA degradation from a gap in dsDNA. WRN is important in repair of double strand breaks by homologous recombination or non-homologous end joining, repair of single nucleotide damages by base excision repair, and is effective in replication arrest recovery. WRN may also be important in telomere maintenance and replication, especially the replication of the G-rich sequences. WRN is an oligomer that can act as a monomer when unwinding DNA, but as a dimer in solution or a tetramer when complexed with DNA, and has also been observed in tetrameric and hexameric forms. The diffusion of WRN has been measured to 1.62 \\\\tfrac{\\\\mathrm{\\\\mu m}^2}{\\\\mathrm{s}} in nucleoplasm and 0.12 \\\\textstyle \\\\tfrac{\\\\mathrm{\\\\mu m}^2}{\\\\mathrm{s}} at nucleoli. Orthologs of WRN have been found in a number of other organisms, including Drosohphila, Xenopus, and C. elegans. WRN is important to genome stability, and cells with mutations to WRN are more susceptible to DNA damage and DNA breaks. The amino terminus of WRN is involved in both helicase and nuclease activities, while the carboxyl- terminus interacts with p53, an important tumor suppressor. WRN may function as an exonuclease in DNA repair, recombination, or replication, as well as resolution of DNA secondary structures. It is involved in branch migration at Holliday junctions, and it interacts with other DNA replication intermediates. mRNA that codes for WRN has been identified in most human tissues.  Post- translational modification  Phosphorylation of WRN at serine/threonine inhibits helicase and exonuclease activities which are important to post- replication DNA repair. De-phosphorylation at these sites enhances the catalytic activities of WRN. Phosphorylation may affect other post- translational modifications, including sumoylation and acetylation. Methylation of WRN causes the gene to turn off. This suppresses the production of the WRN protein and its functions in DNA repair.  Clinical significance  Werner syndrome is caused by mutations in the WRN gene. More than 20 mutations in the WRN gene are known to cause Werner syndrome. Many of these mutations result in an abnormally shortened Werner protein. Evidence suggests that the altered protein is not transported into the cell nucleus, where it normally interacts with DNA. This shortened protein may also be broken down too quickly, leading to a loss of Werner protein in the cell. Without normal Werner protein in the nucleus, cells cannot perform the tasks of DNA replication, repair, and transcription. Researchers are still determining how these mutations cause the appearance of premature aging seen in Werner syndrome. WRN roles in DNA repair pathways=Homologous recombinational repair WRN is active in homologous recombination. Cells defective in the WRN gene have a 23-fold reduction in spontaneous mitotic recombination, with especial deficiency in conversion-type events. WRN defective cells, when exposed to x-rays, have more chromosome breaks and micronuclei than cells with wild-type WRN. Cells defective in the WRN gene are not more sensitive than wild-type cells to gamma-irradiation, UV light, 4 ‚Äì 6 cyclobutane pyrimidines, or mitomycin C, but are sensitive to type I and type II topoisomerase inhibitors. These findings suggested that the WRN protein takes part in homologous recombinational repair and in the processing of stalled replication forks. Non-homologous end joining WRN has an important role in non- homologous end joining (NHEJ) DNA repair. As shown by Shamanna et al., WRN is recruited to double-strand breaks (DSBs) and participates in NHEJ with its enzymatic and non-enzymatic functions. At DSBs, in association with Ku (protein), it promotes standard or canonical NHEJ (c-NHEJ), repairing double- strand breaks in DNA with its enzymatic functions and with a fair degree of accuracy. WRN inhibits an alternative form of NHEJ, called alt-NHEJ or microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ). MMEJ is an inaccurate mode of repair for double-strand breaks. Base excision repair WRN has a role in base excision repair (BER) of DNA. As shown by Das et al., WRN associates with NEIL1 in the early damage-sensing step of BER. WRN stimulates NEIL1 in excision of oxidative lesions. NEIL1 is a DNA glycosylase that initiates the first step in BER by cleaving bases damaged by reactive oxygen species (ROS) and introducing a DNA strand break via NEIL1's associated lyase activity. NEIL1 recognizes (targets) and removes certain ROS-damaged bases and then incises the abasic site via Œ≤,Œ¥ elimination, leaving 3‚Ä≤ and 5‚Ä≤ phosphate ends. NEIL1 recognizes oxidized pyrimidines, formamidopyrimidines, thymine residues oxidized at the methyl group, and both stereoisomers of thymine glycol. WRN also participates in BER through its interaction with PolŒª. WRN binds to the catalytic domain of PolŒª and specifically stimulates DNA gap filling by PolŒª over 8-oxo-G followed by strand displacement synthesis. This allows WRN to promote long-patch DNA repair synthesis by PolŒª during MUTYH-initiated repair of 8-oxo-G:A mispairs. Replication arrest recovery WRN is also involved in replication arrest recovery. If WRN is defective, replication arrest results in accumulation of DSBs and enhanced chromosome fragmentation. As shown by Pichierri et al., WRN interacts with the RAD9-RAD1-HUS1 (9.1.1) complex, one of the central factors of the replication checkpoint. This interaction is mediated by the binding of the RAD1 subunit to the N-terminal region of WRN and is instrumental for WRN relocalization to nuclear foci and its phosphorylation in response to replication arrest. (In the absence of DNA damage or replication fork stalling, WRN protein remains localized to the nucleoli.) The interaction of WRN with the 9.1.1 complex results in prevention of DSB formation at stalled replication forks. WRN deficiencies in cancer Cells expressing limiting amounts of WRN have elevated mutation frequencies compared with wildtype cells. Increased mutation may give rise to cancer. Patients with Werner Syndrome, with homozygous mutations in the WRN gene, have an increased incidence of cancers, including soft tissue sarcomas, osteosarcoma, thyroid cancer and melanoma. Mutations in WRN are rare in the general population. The rate of heterozygous loss of-function mutation in WRN is approximately one per million. In a Japanese population the rate is 6 per 1,000, which is higher, but still infrequent. Mutational defects in the WRN gene are relatively rare in cancer cells compared to the frequency of epigenetic alterations in WRN that reduce WRN expression and could contribute to carcinogenesis. The situation is similar to other DNA repair genes whose expression is reduced in cancers due to mainly epigenetic alterations rather than mutations (see Frequencies of epimutations in DNA repair genes).

It was released on December 2, 2005 in Canada and is rated R for language and sexual content. It stars Heather Graham as Pippa, David Sutcliffe as Ian, and Taye Diggs as Hemingway. Plot The film follows the life of Pippa McGee (Heather Graham) as she takes a giant step between the ages of 29 and 30, which involves growing up, becoming responsible, and discovering true love. Pippa is a freelance travel writer who, after enjoying holidays in a Mexicanized Pamplona (Spain), comes home for a friend's wedding. She then finds herself running her father's wedding magazine while he recovers from a heart attack. Not only does Pippa have to run the magazine Wedding Bells, but she also has to save it from the chopping block. The future of magazine is at risk as hungry vultures wait to take over her father's media conglomerate. Pippa and her strait-laced father have never truly gotten along since her mother died. To complicate things, Pippa becomes involved in a love triangle with her father's right-hand man Ian (David Sutcliffe) and the free-spirited photographer Hemingway Jones (Taye Diggs). The story is completed by a cast of token friends, Lulu (Sandra Oh), Jane (Sarah Chalke), and Rachel (Sabrina Grdevich) who provide Pippa with the moral support she needs to get the job done, both in her love life and in her editor job. CastReception  Jen Johans of Film Intuition states that earlier in the film, the protagonist is a bit of an 'entitled princess', but once shifting her perception from viewing her as an airhead blonde stereotype to one of a Vince Vaughn style from Wedding Crashers, she becomes likeable once again. She believes the reason Graham seems so alienating in the film is because \\"Graham is playing a traditionally male role‚Äîa man who hates weddings aside from getting drunk and laid, someone who hates relationships that last longer than the initial few trysts that make one weak in the knees, a beatnik-like world traveler with a rich dad who has never worked a day in her life. Once this disconcerting character is identified, Grahams' usual liability sinks back in and we grow to enjoy watching her...\\". She goes on to say the film is clich√© ridden, with likeable costars such as Sandra Oh. Scott Weinberg of DVD Talk states \\"Cake is so conventionally sweet and airy that it could give diabetes to King Kong.\\" He also believes it was adequately directed and blandly written, with inconsistent humour, and nothing an audience hasn't seen before. He gives the film 2 out of 5 stars on content, 3 and a half stars out of five on video, two and a half out of five for extras, and only one and a half on its replay ability. David Nusair of Reel Film Reviews gives the film two out of four stars. He states that \\"Cake is a cute but utterly inconsequential romantic comedy that benefits greatly from the uniformly charismatic performances, though the predictable trajectory of the storyline - coupled with a sense of humor that'd be more at home in a sitcom - cements the film's status as an instantly forgettable piece of work.\\" He believes the film has a made-for-TV feeling to it, and feels the screenplay is a bit difficult to sit through. John McKay of the Telegraph-Journal; Saint John, N.B. published his review on November 30, 2005. He appreciates the movie and its humour, as well as appreciating the fact that it is Canadian made and proud, referencing Toronto and its surrounding area. In his review, he states \\"Yes, it smacks of being a chick flick, one that flirts dangerously with conventional theories, that monogamy and marriage are good, and freedom from commitment is bad.\\" Quoting Heather Graham, the film's star, on wedding pressure, she says there's a lot of societal pressure on women, while men get a pass. \\"Oh, it's the biggest thing in your life, who you are going to marry, you know? In some ways it is important, in other ways you feel like you want to rebel against it.\\" ReferencesExternal links * *Cake, Director's Page *Jen Johans' review on Film Intuition *Scott Weinberg's review on DVD Talk *David Nusair's review on Reel Film Reviews Category:2005 films Category:Canadian films Category:English-language films Category:2005 romantic comedy films Category:Canadian romantic comedy films Category:Films directed by Nisha Ganatra Category:Films scored by Andrew Lockington Category:Lionsgate films Category:2005 comedy films ","title":"Cake (2005 film)"},{"id":"3570866","text":"Lac du Bonnet (North) Water Aerodrome, , is located northeast of Lac du Bonnet, Manitoba, Canada.

It was built as a Works Progress Administration (WPA) project with a capacity of 7,500. In 1939 it was enlarged to hold 25,000 spectators. In 1948 and 1949 it staged the Delta Bowl, a college football bowl game. In 1947 the Arkansas‚ÄìTexas football game was played there. The annual Ole Miss‚ÄìTennessee game was also held there in 1960s. Memphis State University (now University of Memphis) home football games were played there until the completion of Memphis Memorial Stadium (now Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium) in 1965. The stadium was named for the late Memphis political boss E. H. Crump. It is now home to Central High School. History The need for a large stadium in Memphis was first proposed by Clarence Saunders, founder of Piggly Wiggly and owner of the Clarence Saunders Tigers, a semi-professional football team. After success against other established teams, it was thought that Memphis would join the fledgling National Football League, but the Great Depression wiped out Saunders, and Memphis missed out on professional football for the first time. In early 1932, plans for a large concrete stadium with a capacity of 25,000 persons was presented to the Mid- South Fair Association with the promise that if it were built, efforts would be made to land \\"big-time events of the tennis world\\". On July 17, 1932, the Memphis Park Commission gave tentative approval for a 25,000-seat stadium to be created at the Fairgrounds. Funds for the stadium were to be raised from the public through a \\"Buy a Barrel of Cement\\" project. However, that project was shelved in favor of a new field at Central High School. On August 20, 1932, plans for a new stadium for the City of Memphis were drawn up and approved by the city managers. Funding for this Depression-era project was achieved when, on December 16, 1933, a athletic field was approved by state and federal Civil Works Authority and construction was completed in 1934. The stadium's original configuration was 7,000 seat capacity on wood bleachers 15 rows high with space for another 4,000 on temporary seating. The stadium was under the control of the City Board of Education, but was available to all levels of teams, from high school to professional On February 27, 1934, the school board voted to name the new stadium for congressman and former mayor E. H. Crump. Mr. Crump accepted the honor saying he was \\"pleased\\" but felt such honors were best served posthumously. The next day, final approval of $35,000 was granted by the Civil Works Authority and work on the project began. By August 1934, the scope of the project had been increased to include a cinder running track and lighting consisting of six 80' towers each holding eight 1000-watt lamps, enabling night football to be played. From the outset, day- night double headers were the norm at the stadium. Despite this type scheduling, the first year of operation ran a deficit, with maintenance and operating costs running from $2,100 to $2,200 and gate receipts and concessions totaling only $951. After a 1936 game between Mississippi and Tennessee drew a record crowd of 11,000, the city decided that it should aggressively market itself as \\"neutral ground\\" to the regional teams and promote bringing big games to Memphis. The decision was made to remove the wooden bleachers on the south side of the field, replace them with concrete 46 rows high and increase capacity to 15,000. Control of the facility was transferred to the Park Commission on August 25, 1936, and $100,000 was allocated for the project. A news release from the WPA stated \\"California has its \\"Rose Bowl\\", Louisiana has its \\"Sugar Bowl\\" and now Memphis...is to have its \\"Cotton Bowl.\\" The WPA provided $90,050 and the City of Memphis chipped in another $44,305. City engineer Will Fowler was placed in charge of the project and stated at the time that he envisioned further expansion by creating a bowl which would seat 30,000. Fowler would play an aggressive role in frequent upgrades to the facility over time. 1936 also saw the first intercollegiate football game featuring a Memphis team, Southwestern (now Rhodes College), which at the time was acknowledged to be on the threshold of the \\"big time\\". There were 40 games played at Crump Stadium that season At the same time Crump Stadium was being expanded, it was decided to create a new field at the fairgrounds. Funds were acquired from the WPA for this new lighted field which Mayor Watkins Overton said would help take pressure off Crump Stadium by giving events with smaller attendance a new venue. The wood bleachers from the south side of Crump Stadium were relocated to the fairgrounds and installed. That field was located in the area now paved as parking between Libertyland and the Mid-South Coliseum. State Teachers College and Southwestern shared this field beginning in 1937 with high school and junior high teams. Both State Teachers and Southwestern had been playing at Hodges Field. In 1937, Southwestern moved five games to Crump Stadium, and State Teachers played two. Both squads played three games at the new fairgrounds facility. The first game played in Crump Stadium by State Teachers was against Tennessee Tech in November 1937. The Teachers would spend the next 27 years at Crump Stadium. New dressing rooms were constructed under the south stands in 1938. To reach the dressing rooms, teams had to go down steps leading to a tunnel underneath the cinder track and box seats to a second set of stairs which led back up to the entrance passage of the building where the teams turned left or right respectively. 1939 saw more expansion and renovation as the north side wooden bleachers were demolished and concrete stands were erected. The new north stands held just under 10,000 people and cost $186,000. The north stands were 42 rows high as opposed to the south stands which were 46 rows high. In 1940 a 600-seat section was added in the southwest corner along with a new separate entrance and toilet facilities for blacks, allowing those citizens access to the stadium for the first time. Capacity was increased to just over 25,000 and the city was able to attract marquee match-ups from throughout the region. Match-ups between Tennessee, Mississippi, Mississippi State and Arkansas were frequent with even a Texas-Arkansas game played at Crump Stadium. Crump Stadium would remain in essentially that configuration until 1960, when the City Commission recommended expanding the stadium again. This met with much controversy and opposition from the school board, which needed the land the stadium sat on for expansion of Central High School and to meet open space requirements. In November 1962, the City Commission approved spending of $1.4 million to increase capacity to over 45,000 and a contract was awarded. But less than a year later, the project was halted in favor of a new stadium at the fairgrounds. After Memphis Memorial Stadium was built, control of the facility was transferred back to the Memphis City Schools. Closing, demolition and refurbishment The Memphis school district closed Crump Stadium to competition after the 2004 high school football season. In the summer of 2006 the stadium underwent demolition and was replaced with a stadium more appropriately sized for high school football complete with a new track and other track and field amenities. The outer brick wall, original gates and entrances were retained and the name remains \\"Crump Stadium.\\" High school sporting competitions resumed in the fall of 2007, including high school football regular season and playoff games.

While traditionally located in and around Strathearn in central Scotland, it is more likely to have been located in and around Moray and Easter Ross in the north. Name The people of Fortriu left no surviving indigenous writings and the name they used to describe themselves is unrecorded. The population group was first documented in the late 4th century by the Roman historian Ammianus Marcellinus, who referred to them in Latin as the Verturiones (or Vecturiones). The Latin root verturio has been connected etymologically by John Rhys with the later Welsh word gwerthyr, meaning \\"fortress\\", suggesting that both came from a Common Brittonic root vertera, and implying that the group's name meant \\"Fortress People\\". A reconstructed form in the Pictish language would be something like *Uerteru. A connected Old Irish form of the name appears from the 6th to the 10th centuries in the Annals of Ulster and later sources, which contain repeated references to rex Fortrenn, (\\"the King of Fortriu\\"), la firu Fortrenn (\\"the men of Fortriu\\") and Maigh Fortrenn (\\"the plain of Fortriu\\"), alongside references to battles occurring i Fortrinn (\\"in Fortriu\\"). These are examples of a common pattern of Goidelic languages rendering with an f what in Brittonic languages is U/V, W or Gw. The word Fortriu is a modern reconstruction of a hypothetical nominative form for this word that has survived only in these genitive and dative cases. Anglo-Saxon sources, from the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle in the 6th century to Bede in the 8th century, refer to the group using the Old English form of the name W√¶rteras. Modern scholars writing in English usually refer to the Kingdom using the name Fortriu and the adjective Verturian, and use the name the W√¶rteras to refer to the people as an ethnic group. Location Traditionally the kingdom has been seen as centred on central Scotland, equivalent to the Kingdom of the Southern Picts, with a heartland perhaps in Strathearn. Over the last century or so this has become a scholarly consensus.see virtually any work dealing with the Picts before 2005. However, new research by Alex Woolf seems to have destroyed this consensus, if not the idea itself. As Woolf has pointed out, the only basis for it had been that a battle had taken place in Strathearn in which the Men of Fortriu had taken part. This is an unconvincing reason on its own, because there are two Strathearns ‚Äî one in the south, and one in the north ‚Äî and, moreover, every battle has to be fought outside the territory of one of the combatants. By contrast, a northern recension of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle makes it clear that Fortriu was north of the Mounth (i.e., the eastern Grampians), in the area visited by Columba. The long poem known as The Prophecy of Berch√°n, written perhaps in the 12th century, but purporting to be a prophecy made in the Early Middle Ages, says that Dub, King of Scotland was killed in the Plain of Fortriu.A. O. Anderson, Early Sources, Vol. I, p. 474. Another source, the Chronicle of the Kings of Alba, indicates that King Dub was killed at Forres, a location in Moray.A. O. Anderson, Early Sources, Vol. I, p. 473. Moreover, additions to the Chronicle of Melrose confirm that Dub was killed by the men of Moray at Forres.A. O. Anderson, Early Sources, Vol. I, pp. 473‚Äì4. Sueno's Stone, located in Forres. This large post-Pictish monument marks some kind of military triumph. The Prophecy of Berch√°n states that \\"Mac Bethad, the glorious king of Fortriu, will take [Scotland].\\"A. O. Anderson, Early Sources, Vol. I, p. 601. As Macbeth, King of Scotland may have been Mormaer of Moray before he became King of Scots, it is possible that Fortriu was understood to be interchangeable with Moray in the High Middle Ages. Fortriu is also mentioned as one of the seven ancient Pictish kingdoms in the 13th-century source known as De Situ Albanie. There can be little or no doubt then that Fortriu centred on northern Scotland. Other Pictish scholars, such as James E. Fraser are now taking it for granted that Fortriu was in the north of Scotland, centred on Moray and Easter Ross, where most early Pictish monuments are located. Hence, it is in these areas that the united kingdom of the Picts originated, perhaps acquiring southern Pictland after the expulsion of the Northumbrians by King Bridei III of the Picts at the Battle of Dun Nechtain in 685 CE. Relocating Fortriu north of the Mounth increases the importance of the Vikings. The Viking impact on the north was greater than in the south, and in the north, the Vikings actually conquered and made permanent territorial gains. The creation of Alba or the Kingdom of Scotland from Pictland, traditionally associated with a conquest by Kenneth MacAlpin (Old Irish: ') in 843, can perhaps be better understood in this context. It appears from a discovery made by Oliver Curran, a Northern Irish historian, that a tribe of the Fortriu were also located at Newry, County Down: according to an 18th-century translation of Ptolemy's map of Ireland they are seen in the wider area marked Voluntii which he says corresponds with the Cruithne (Picts). It is not yet known whether other scholars will be convinced.His correspondence concerning the find is on-going with the aforementioned Dr Alex Woolf. There have also been Pictish 'Z' rod carvings and a settlement found on Trusty's hill at Gatehouse of Fleet, Dumfries and Galloway. There are also numerous cup and ring carvings and megaliths in the Machars and the Rhins of Galloway hinting at a migration route to Ireland.

Its declared goal was to combat lawlessness, although it discreetly sought the transfer of Culmerland from the Teutonic Order to Poland.Turnbull, p. 79 The union was founded by Nicholas von Renys, John of Pulkow, Frederick of Kitnow, and Nicholas of Kitnow. It was named after its emblem, a lizard (), and expanded its influence to other provinces. During the Battle of Grunwald in 1410, Nicholas von Renys carried the banner of the Culmerland troops for the Teutonic Order, but lowered the banner prematurely, which was considered a signal for retreat. Some chroniclers of the time said that this contributed to the defeat of the Knights, which Heinrich von Treitschke's thesis Das deutsche ordensland Preussen popularized, but this lacks historical support. It is also possible that von Reyns didn't intentionally lower the banner early, and that it moved out of sight or fell when a bearer was killed. After their defeat at Grunwald, the Order sought to use the Lizard League as a scapegoat; the League was also believed to have been behind messages sent from Kulm advising the Order's surrender, when at the time its capital Marienburg was under Polish siege. Renys was executed by the Order after the war, causing the remaining members of the Lizard Union to flee to Poland.Turnbull, p. 80 The Union was declared illegal by Pope Gregory XII and Emperor Sigismund, and was subsequently dissolved. It laid the foundation, however, for the later Prussian Confederation, which requested the annexation of the Monastic State of the Teutonic Knights into Poland in 1454.

Career In 1969, American singer John Walker, of the Walker Brothers, toured in England, and was accompanied by keyboardist Brian Chatton, bassist Gordon \\"Flash\\" Smith, guitarist Ronnie Caryl and drummer Phil Collins. After the tour, they decided to go on together, calling themselves Hickory, and recorded a single in 1969, \\"Green Light/The Key\\". The group met songwriters Ken Howard and Alan Blaikley, who were looking for a band to record an album they were working on, so they changed their name to Flaming Youth. They released the album Ark 2 in 1969. In November, New Musical Express reported that the concept album was the subject of an hour-long television special, which the group had filmed in the Netherlands. The LP was released on Fontana Records in the UK to some critical but no commercial success. There was also a follow-up single recorded, \\"Man, Woman, and Child\\". The band had difficulty getting gigs; organist Rod Mayall (John Mayall's brother) briefly joined the band before they broke up in early 1970. Aftermath Collins and Caryl both auditioned for Genesis the following year, although Caryl was not successful, he played at a concert with them at Aylesbury, just before they recruited Steve Hackett. Caryl later played with Collins as rhythm guitarist on his solo tours. After he left Flaming Youth, Chatton joined Jackson Heights with Lee Jackson, bassist and singer of The Nice, along with multi-instrumentalist John McBurnie. They recorded three albums together.

He is venerated on 11 June, the day of his death. Life Born in Naples, Italy, to a deeply religious family (one of his sisters was a nun, and three other brothers were priests), at a very young age Sabbatini dedicated himself to a religious life. He involved himself with the Congregazione dei Pii Operai (Congregation of Pious Workers), teaching religion to the children of the poor and manual laborers of Naples and assisting in the celebration of mass at the Church of San Nicola alla Carit√°. In this church he was in charge of the so-called Congregazione dei Figlioli (Congregation of Sons). Sabbatini was ordained a priest at age 24 and soon began to teach at the religious academies of San Giorgio Maggiore and Santa Maria ai Monte. In 1684 he founded a monastery near the Santissima Annunziata Maggiore hospital, for abandoned young women who wished to enter religious life.Borrelli, Antonio. \\"Venerable Ludovico Sabbatini\\", Santi e Beati\\", November 18, 2002 In 1687, Sabbatini moved to Rome in order to promote the Congregation of Pious Workers in the Papal States. From that point, Sabbatini involved himself in many benevolent activities with the poor and ill in hospitals and prisons, as well as aiding Jewish people. He continued working as a teacher, at the Collegio dei Catecumini, where he founded an academy of dogma and exegesis. Returning to Naples in 1699, Sabbatini was elected general provost (Preposito Generale) of the Congregazione.

Following his 1903 departure from the U.S., Cook resided in Paris, Rome, Russia, and on the island of Majorca, in the Balearic Islands off the eastern coast of Spain. Today he is chiefly remembered not for his artistic achievements, but because, during World War I, he taught Stein to drive an automobile so that she could contribute to the French war effort, and because, in 1926, he commissioned the Swiss architect Le Corbusier (whose career was at an early stage) to design an innovative cubist home, on the outskirts of Paris, now called Maison Cook or Villa Cook. Formative years Cook grew up in the small community of Independence, Iowa, in the northeast section of the state. In the early 1890s, it was nationally known as a horseracing center, a distinction that earned it the popular name of the Lexington of the North. The son of an Iowa lawyer who also owned a number of farms, Cook left home to study at the Art Institute of Chicago in 1898 and then, shortly after that, at the National Academy of Design in New York. As was customary among aspiring artists, he then moved on to Paris in 1903, where he was a student of animal painter Jean-Paul Laurens and the famous (if much maligned) French academic master, the aging Adolphe-William Bouguereau, at the Acad√©mie Julian. Society painter A boost in Cook's career took place in 1907, when, while living temporarily in Rome, his request was approved by the Vatican to paint a portrait of Pope Pius X (the first American to do so). As a result, Cook was soon regarded as a young society artist (somewhat in the manner of John Singer Sargent, whom he admired and was acquainted with), and so received a flood of requests from other dignitaries to have their portraits painted. Expatriate modernist When Cook returned to Paris, he became somehow acquainted with Gertrude Stein and her companion, Alice B. Toklas. Consequently, the three became close and loyal friends, in part because he frequently brought influential visitors to the Saturday evening soirees at Stein's apartment at 27 rue de Fleurus, among them (as Stein reported later in her first autobiography) \\"a great many from Chicago, very wealthy stout ladies and equally wealthy tall good-looking thin ones.\\" By way of her soirees and other events, Stein introduced Cook to scores of Modern-era artists and writers, including Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque, Henri Matisse, Ernest Hemingway, Guillaume Apollinaire, Jacques Lipchitz, Robert Graves, and so on. Friendship with Stein On a more personal level, Stein and Cook were also friends for other reasons. Shortly before World War I, Stein and Toklas ended up vacationing together on the Spanish island of Majorca with (by coincidence) Cook and his mistress, a French artist's model and cleaning woman named Jeanne Moallic. Eventually, when the two couples returned to Paris, Cook worked in an automobile factory, then became a taxi driver, in the course of which he also test-drove Renaults. Using his taxi, Cook became Stein's driving instructor, so that she and Toklas could transport supplies for the French war effort. During this same time period, Cook may also have become a clandestine agent for the U.S. Secret Service, while continuing to work as a taxi driver. Inadvertently (as described in a piece called \\"A Movie\\" by Stein), he and Moallic apparently contributed to the arrest of U.S. Army thieves, with the result that they were invited to ride (together, in their Renault) in the famous victory parade through the Arc de Triomphe in July 1919. For several years after the war, Cook was a Red Cross worker in the Caucasus region of the USSR (and perhaps, as is sometimes suggested, a Secret Service source as well), providing food and other aid to refugees in the aftermath of the Russian Revolution of 1917. Prior to Cook's departure on that, he and Moallic were married on March 2, 1922, at an informal ceremony in which Stein and Toklas were their legal witnesses. Maison Cook Cook's father died in 1924, at which time he became an heir (along with a sister and two brothers) to a substantial amount of money. In connection with the settlement of his parents' estate, as well as to enable his wife to get to know his relatives (and vice versa), the Cooks drove across the U.S., from east to west and back again, during a period of about five months in 1925, staying for one month in his Iowa hometown. Returning to Europe, they decided to permanently settle in France. The sculptor Jacques Lipchitz introduced them to architect Le Corbusier, then largely unknown, who, during this time, was designing a series of villas, including innovative homes for Michael Stein (Gertrude's brother) and Lipchitz himself. In 1926, they commissioned the architect to design what Le Corbusier said was the first \\"true cubic house,\\" called Villa Cook or Maison Cook, on the outskirts of Paris, at 6 rue Denfert Rochereau in Boulogne-sur-Seine. Later life In his later life, as a friend of Stein's once noted, Cook was primarily known as \\"the occupant of a house built by Le Corbusier.\\" Already dismayed in the 1930s by his continuing lack of success as an artist, he apparently gave up painting, moved temporarily in Rome, and then settled with his wife in 1936 in Palma de Majorca, in the Balearic Islands. Majorca had by then become an affordable refuge for expatriate artists and writers, most notably Robert Graves. In their declining years, both William and Jeanne Cook turned to painting, and both became active participants in the island's artistic community. They spent their remaining years in the El Terreno district of Palma de Majorca, and are buried in above ground vaults in a small religious cemetery in the nearby district of Genova. Afterword As a friend of Gertrude Stein, Cook was one of the few who remained loyal to her throughout their lives. In part, this may have been because, without exception, she always wrote nice things about him. As American writer Robert McAlmon once said to Cook (as the latter reports in his letters), \\"[Stein] treats you better than anyone else. I think she likes you.\\" To which Cook replied, \\"Of course, she always did, and I always liked her.\\" In Stein's writings, there are frequent references to Cook, but almost never to his art. When conversing, they apparently almost always talked about bullfighting, religion, money, automobiles, and memories of their respective childhoods in the country that they both still loved (if preferably from a distance), the place that they fondly referred to in conversation and correspondence as \\"our native land.\\" Sources * Correspondence of William E.

The third named storm, second hurricane, and second major hurricane of the season, it developed from a tropical wave east of the Lesser Antilles. It moved briskly west-northwest, passing between the islands of Dominica and Guadeloupe. It strengthened to a hurricane in the eastern Caribbean Sea, and it struck Jamaica with winds near Category 3 intensity. It strengthened to a peak intensity of 130 mph (215 km/h) prior to landfall on Quintana Roo, Yucat√°n Peninsula. It weakened over land, and it re-strengthened over the Gulf of Mexico before it made a final landfall near Tampico. In its path, Charlie caused more than 250 deaths. The hurricane produced Jamaica's deadliest natural disaster of the 20th century, causing more than 152 deaths and $50,000,000 in damages. The hurricane was described as Tampico's worst tropical cyclone since 1936, and it caused more than 100 fatalities in the surrounding areas. Many bodies were not recovered after flooding. The hurricane produced peak gusts of 160 mph (260 km/h) at the airport, and its strongest sustained winds were unmeasured in mainland Mexico, suggesting that it may have been a Category 4 hurricane at landfall. Meteorological history On August 12, a tropical wave organized to a tropical depression about 930 miles (1,495 km) east-southeast of the island of Barbados. Operationally, the system was not detected until August 14, and it was believed to have been an area of low pressure when it moved through the eastern Caribbean. It moved to the west-northwest, and it slowly organized to a minimal tropical storm on August 14. Although Hurricane hunters reported winds of hurricane force in squalls, the system was discounted as an easterly wave. On August 15, Tropical Storm Charlie quickly intensified, attaining maximum sustained winds of 75 mph (120 km/h) after passing through the Lesser Antilles. The small center of circulation passed between Dominica and Guadeloupe in the early morning hours. On August 16, the hurricane moved steadily west-northwest 140 miles (225 km) south-southwest of San Juan, Puerto Rico. Hurricane Charlie continued to strengthen, and it reached Category 2 status on August 17 as it moved quickly westward across the Caribbean Sea. The cyclone intensified as it made landfall south of Kingston, Jamaica with 110 mph (175 km/h) sustained winds. The city reported peak winds of 110 mph (175 km/h) as the center passed 8 miles (10 km) to the southwest, so Charlie may have been a Category 3 hurricane in Jamaica. On August 18, the hurricane left the island as a Category 1 hurricane, and it quickly re-intensified over water. It passed south of the Cayman Islands with 105 mph (165 km/h) sustained winds. Grand Cayman reported gusts of 92 mph (150 km/h). Later, it attained major hurricane status on August 19. The hurricane peaked at 130 mph (215 km/h) just before hitting near Cozumel during the night, and it weakened as it crossed the Yucat√°n Peninsula on August 20. Upon reaching the Gulf of Mexico, Charlie had weakened to a 105 mph (165 km/h) hurricane. On August 21, it remained a Category 2 hurricane while crossing the Gulf of Mexico until 18 hours before landfall. On August 22, Charlie slowly intensified, and it strengthened to a second peak of 115 mph (180 km/h) off the mainland Mexican coast. Later, Charlie made landfall near Tampico with 115 mph (180 km/h) sustained winds. The strongest winds were believed to have been north of the eye, and were unrecorded. The storm quickly weakened over land, and it dissipated on August 23 in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas. Preparations On August 15, the Weather Bureau office in San Juan issued hurricane warnings for the eastern Caribbean from Martinique to Antigua, while storm warnings were released for the rest of the Leeward Islands. Later, hurricane warnings were also issued for the northern Leeward Islands, and northeast storm warnings were released for Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. In advance of the hurricane, flights' scheduled departures for the Barbados region were delayed. On August 17, the Weather Bureau noted that the hurricane would affect Jamaica, though it was not expected to strengthen significantly; the agency also reported that the probabilities were equal for the cyclone to pass north or south of the island. Later, the cyclone was forecast to pass \\"over or just south\\" of the island; Jamaica was urged to prepare for the cyclone, and the hurricane was expected to strengthen as the forward motion decreased. On August 20, the cyclone was expected to affect the northern Yucat√°n Peninsula between M√©rida and Campeche, and \\"extreme caution\\" was advised for the area. The hurricane was also expected to re-strengthen prior to its second landfall in Mexico, though the Weather Bureau also noted that there was a chance for the storm to affect Texas. Although the possibility never materialized, the agency expected rain bands and rough seas to affect southern Texas, and small watercraft were urged to remain in ports until the hurricane moved inland. On August 21, the cyclone was expected to move ashore between Nautla and Tuxpan, though it eventually made landfall further north near Tampico. Local officials expressed concerns about residents in huts and other vulnerable structures. In the Harlingen Valley region of southern Texas, precautionary measures were taken and Red Cross divisions organized a meeting at the local city hall. City departments and facilities were ready for disposal if the cyclone moved closer to the area. The cyclone's rains were also expected to impact unpicked cotton plants in the region. In advance of the storm, a Coast Guard plane dropped messages from the air to several vessels, advising them to seek shelter. In Tampico, oil industries erected barriers to protect fields, and authorities planned to evacuate residents from the surrounding low-lying areas. Thousands of residents stayed in refugee centers on elevated ground. Impact The cyclone was compact when it moved through the Lesser Antilles, and the strongest winds on land in the eastern Caribbean islands did not exceed 35 mph (55 km/h). In Jamaica, the hurricane produced heavy rainfall, peaking at 17 inches (430 mm) in Kingston, which caused numerous landslides across eastern sections of the island. Peak gusts were estimated near 125 mph (200 km/h) across the island. A hangar and installations were destroyed at Palisadoes Airport, and the facility received \\"extensive damage.\\" Consequently, \\"At Memphis, Tenn, Chicago & Southern Airline headquarters here reported that its north and southbound Constellation flights were unable to land at Kingston, bypassing the airport there on flights between Chicago and Caracas.\\" Several ships were sunk or overturned during the storm. Communications and power services were disrupted, suspending information from the island's interior. The hurricane also cut communications from the island to radio stations in the United States. 70‚Äì80 percent of the island's banana crops were destroyed, in addition to 30 percent of other crops. 70 convicted felons also escaped from a jail when winds blew down walls. Flooding was expected in the island's mountainous interior because of heavy precipitation. Heavy rains caused rock slides, damaging roads, railroads, and other sources of tourism. In Kingston, electricity was initially restored to essential services, including \\"hospitals, refrigerating plants, pumping stations and newspaper plants.\\" Charlie caused around $50 million (1951 USD, $380 million 2005 USD) in crop and property damage, 152 deaths, injured 2,000, and left 25,000 homeless. On the Yucat√°n Peninsula, Charlie destroyed up to 70% of the crops, though no loss of life was reported in the area. Unofficially, one person was reportedly killed on the peninsula. M√©rida reported winds of 70 mph (110 km/h). The winds toppled several thatched homes on Cozumel. A wind gust of 160 mph (260 km/h) was measured at the airport near Tampico, though peak gusts in the city did not exceed 110 mph (175 km/h). The storm was reported to be the worst in Tampico since 1936. The winds uprooted trees and destroyed telephone poles, and damages to corn crops were believed to exceed $500,000. At least 300 residences were \\"damaged or destroyed.\\" Outside the city, Charlie's heavy rain led to bursting dams and flooded rivers, where upward of 100 people died. In the city, four people died, and property losses were estimated near $1,160,000. The hurricane's outer fringes produced swells along the Texas coast, and swimmers were advised to be cautious because of hazardous conditions. The area was also experiencing rough swells and strong winds from an unrelated weather system, which produced peak gusts of 60 mph (95 km/h). The conditions snarled marine operations in the area, and three fishermen were missing during the squall. On August 23, Brownsville experienced gusts of 50 mph (80 km/h) when the hurricane struck the coast further south. Aftermath In the wake of this storm, Jamaica formed a new governmental entity known as the Hurricane Housing Organization. In 1956, this organization merged with the Central Housing Authority to become the Department of Housing.Reuters (1969). \\"It's time (June) to match for Anna...\\" The Daily Gleaner.

He wrote and edited several books dealing with the Canadian military, including ground-breaking works on Canadian distinguishing patches worn since 1916, as well as the uniforms of the Canadian Expeditionary Force, and was the Canadian subject matter expert on the Canadian Inglis High-Power Pistol (Browning High-Power). As a senior public servant for the Government of Canada, he worked with Global Affairs Canada, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and Transport Canada.  Early life  Clive Law was born in London, England, on May 14, 1954. He emigrated to Canada at the age of four and became a Canadian citizen on March 5, 1971. He attended Bishop's College School where he participated in the Cadet movement, attaining the rank of Cadet Regimental Sergeant Major.  Career and death = Military Service  Law began his military service as a \\"Corporal All- out\\" Staff Cadet on the establishment of the Regiment de Maisonneuve in June 1971. From September 1972 to April 1974, he was a Cadet Instructor List Officer with 2675 Royal Canadian Army Cadet Corps affiliated to 3rd Field Regiment (Royal Canadian Engineers). He officially enrolled in the Canadian Forces Primary Reserve on 23 May 1974, as an officer of the Governor General's Foot Guards. In 1976 he completed the Unit NBC Officer and Basic Parachutist courses before transferring to the Supplementary List in June 1976.  Service Publications  Service Publications (SP) was established in 1991 by Clive M. Law, an author and historian as well as former officer of the Governor General's Foot Guards. The company is devoted to the publication of books and periodicals regarding Canadian military subjects. SP sells books from other publishers as well as producing its own series of books. In addition to one-off titles by various authors, SP also releases titles as part of their own series of books, such as \\"Weapons of War\\" and \\"UpClose\\". In addition, MilArt, an acronym for Military Artifact, was originally published as a paper newsletter from 1996 to 1999, at which time it went dormant due to Law's other commitments with Service Publications. Even though collectors of Canadian militaria are well served by two large, national, collectors' organizations (and countless local groups) Clive Law felt that ready access, via the web, to quality articles would benefit the Collector Historian community. Some articles featured have been written exclusively for MilArt while others have previously appeared in other media. MilArt allows for colour images, and more of them than is normally found in print journals. A number of categories have been established and more will be added as needed.

It was established in order to protect the endangered giraffe, that is found only in the grasslands of East Africa. In 1979, the Giraffe Center, a nature sanctuary for visiting and including wildlife conservation education for urban school children, was started by Jock Leslie Melville, the Kenyan grandson of a Scottish Earl, when he and his wife Betty captured two baby giraffe to start a programme of breeding giraffe on their Langata property, site of the present Centre. Since then the programme has had huge success, resulting in the introduction of several breeding pairs of Rothschild Giraffe into Kenyan national parks. By 1983 enough money had been raised to establish the Giraffe Visitor's Center as a tourist destination just outside Nairobi. The main attraction for both school children and visitors is feeding giraffes from a raised observation platform. The Giraffe Center is also home to several warthogs which freely roam the area along with the giraffes.

The primary defining characteristic of American Tribal Style Belly Dance is group improvisation. Tribal is generally performed in a group, often at community events such as festivals and parades, with tribal dancers typically favoring a look provided by wide-legged pants gathered at the ankles (also known as pantaloons), tops known as cholis and full skirts.  Tribal style  The roots of tribal bellydance are accredited to Jamila Salimpour, who fostered a fusion of costumes and folkloric dances styles from the Middle East, North African, Spain, and India (such as the Banjara of Rajasthan). Salimpour began teaching and performing all over California and the West Coast. Using traditional folkloric dance elements and costumes inspired by traditional and ethnographic traditions, she presented on stage through Bal Anat, a colorful company of musicians, singers, and dancers that created a \\"souk\\" or almost circus feel. Taking what she had learned from native dancers from Morocco, Algeria, Turkey, Egypt, Syria and Lebanon who were dancing in the United States, she began to catalogue \\"belly dance movement\\" and began creating a basic repertoire terminology which is still the basis for Tribal Style and American Tribal Style repertoire. Jamila's Bal Anat \\"paved the way for others to use a fusion of the various regional dances of the Middle East and North Africa as inspiration for their own version of bellydance.\\" In the 1970s, a former student of Salimpour, Masha Archer, began teaching and directing her own troupe, San Francisco Classic Dance Company. Archer blended the diverse elements of Bal Anat into a single cohesive dance style which she styled as \\"bellydance\\". Whether done in ignorance of the different stylistic origins or as a conscious aesthetic choice, this approach was some of the earliest and most notable bellydance world fusion work in America. Archer's student Carolena Nerriccio is credited with codifying the first dance style and format to bear the name \\"tribal bellydance\\". She has registered their signature style American Tribal Style Bellydance, and over the last two decades plus, Carolena has grown her format and brought it to the mainstream bellydance community through videos, music compilations, and performances and workshops around the world. Dancers inspired by Carolena's work with ATS have since created multiple offshoots of the style, some retaining true stylistic elements of ATS while others have evolved quite far from the original form. Tribal Style today represents everything from folkloric inspired dances (such as the original Bal Anat) to a fusion of ancient dance techniques from India, the Middle East, Spain and Africa. As a general category, Tribal Style covers many flavors of American Belly Dance both the folkloric inspired and fusion and cross over styles which explore modern, jazz, dance theatre, and hip hop with belly dance, as well as fusion with traditional classical ethnic dance forms like Bhangra, Bharata Natyam, Flamenco and now even Polynesian and West African Dance. Improvisational choreography American tribal-style belly dance's movements are inspired by folkloric dances of the Middle East, North Africa, Spain and India. ATS is a method of improvisational choreography, using a vocabulary of movements and cues allowing the dancers to improvise together while dancing. The knowledge of the dance vocabulary allows ATS dancers from different regions to collaborate even if they have not previously danced with each other. American Tribal Style belly dancers always use finger cymbals or zils, but the focus is on the group as opposed to emphasizing solo performance. There are two families of movements: slow movements and fast movements. Zils are worn but not usually played while performing \\"slow movements\\". (However, for example, if the featured duet trio or quartet are dancing to a Moroccan 6 rhythm, members of the chorus may choose to accompany them through playing their zils.) During \\"fast movements\\", the zils are meant to be played. The most common rhythm played on the dancer's zils is the right-left-right pattern. Certain \\"fast\\" movements require the dancers and chorus to play the military zil pattern. Other, less frequently played patterns include the Moroccan 6; some troupes experiment with 9/8 Turkish rhythm. ATS features call-and-answer performance with other dancers or as a whole group as well as, more uncommonly, solos. Often there is a chorus that provides a moving back-drop while the featured duet, trio, or quartet is the focal point. Dancers take turns coming out of the chorus in duets, trios and quartets because if, for example, five dancers were to come out into formation, the sight-line (view of the leader) is not as effective. Groups of five or more are generally used towards specific formations to improve this site-line issue. The principal dancers and the chorus work in an improvisational manner. Formations for the principal dancers and the chorus are also formalized in the ATS format to maximize dancer visibility to the audience and likewise maximize group visibility of the leader. In most traditional ATS formations, the leader is farthest to the left, with followers behind and to the right. Dancers angle their bodies to the left to be able to clearly read the leader's cues. Similar rules apply for members of the chorus, whose leader is at the far left. When the dancers face each other in a circle, however, the lead is \\"neutral\\"; the next movement can be initiated by any dancer in the circle. Thus, maintaining eye contact is important when dancers are in a circle. The cues and formations are the secret behind group improvisational dance. They allow the dancers to move together without choreography. Sometimes, troupes will create formal choreography while still using the ATS-specific formations and cues.  Costuming  The style of ATS is also characterized by costumes derived from various \\"folkloric\\" traditions and cultures and is often composed of one or more long, full, tiered (usually 25-yard) skirts over full pantaloons; a short choli top that bares the midriff, over which a bra decorated with coins and textiles is worn; a decorative headband, turban, and/or hair flowers and other decorations; one or more hip scarves with yarn, tassels, or fringe; a decorative belt, often with tassels, coins, and/or medallions; and much oxidized silver jewelry. The jewelry commonly originates from Central Asia, from any number of nomadic tribes or empires (e.g., Kuchi, Turkoman, Rajasthan), and is often large and set with semi-precious stones or, when mass-produced, glass. Makeup usually focuses on a dark eye and red lip, and a decorative bindi is often worn. Some dancers \\"tattoo\\" their faces with kohl or kajal.[8] Dancers may perform barefoot or may wear dance shoes or sandals. > I can only speak for my troupe in terms of the evolution of costuming style. > My teacher, Masha, encouraged us to wear a choli and pantaloons, a fringe > shawl, lots of big, chunky jewelry and a headdress or some sort of > embellished hair worn up.

He was the first of the eight princes commonly associated with the War of the Eight Princes. Life Sima Liang was the fourth son of Sima Yi, by his concubine, Lady Fu. During Cao Wei regencies of his older brothers Sima Shi and Sima Zhao, he served as a mid-level official. After his nephew Sima Yan took the throne as Emperor Wu of Jin, ending Cao Wei and starting Jin, Sima Liang was created the Prince of Fufeng and put in charge of the military commands of Qin (Áß¶Â∑û, modern eastern Gansu) and Yong (ÈõçÂ∑û, modern central and northern Shaanxi) provinces. In 270, after his subordinate, the general Liu Qi (ÂäâÊóÇ) was defeated by the Xianbei rebel Tufa Shujineng, Sima Liang tried to have Liu's life spared by claiming fault; Liu's life was spared, but Sima Liang lost his post as a result. Despite this, Sima Liang was well respected among the Jin imperial clan for his virtues, including his filial devotion to Princess Dowager Fu. Because of this, Emperor Wu put him in charge of monitoring the imperial princes' behavior, to correct and rebuke them when necessary. In 277, Emperor Wu moved Sima Liang's principality to Ru'nan and put him in charge of the military commands of Yu Province (Ë±´Â∑û, modern eastern Henan). However, soon he recalled Sima Liang back to the capital to serve as a high-level advisor. As Emperor Wu grew ill in 289, he considered whom to make regent. He considered both Empress Yang Zhi's father Yang Jun and Sima Liang. As a result, Yang Jun became fearful of Sima Liang and had him posted to the key city of Xuchang. Several other imperial princes were also posted to other key cities in the empire. By 290, Emperor Wu resolved to let Yang and Sima Liang both be regents, but after he wrote his will, the will was seized by Yang Jun, who instead had another will promulgated in which Yang alone was named regent. Emperor Wu died soon thereafter and was succeeded by Emperor Hui. By this point, Sima Liang had not yet gone to Xuchang, but was fearful of Yang Jun, and so did not dare to attend Emperor Wu's wake. Yang was still suspicious that Sima Liang might have a coup in mind, and so prepared for his troops to attack Sima Liang. (Indeed, the justice minister He Xu (‰ΩïÂãó) suggested to Sima Liang that he overthrow Yang, but Sima Liang refused.) In order to avoid a military confrontation with Yang, Sima Liang immediately left for Xuchang. Map showing the Wars of the Eight Princes After Empress Jia Nanfeng, Emperor Hui's wife, in conjunction with Emperor Hui's brother Sima Wei the Prince of Chu, overthrew and killed Yang in a coup in spring 291, Sima Liang, as the most respected of the imperial princes, was summoned back to the capital Luoyang to serve as regent, along with Wei Guan. To appease those who might have been angry and had overthrown Yang Jun, Sima Liang widely promoted those who participated in the plot, and more than a thousand men were created marquesses. He and Wei, however, did try to get the government on track, but Empress Jia continued to interfere with governmental matters. They also became concerned about the violent temper of Sima Wei and therefore tried to strip him of his military command, but Sima Wei persuaded Empress Jia to let him keep his military command. Sima Wei's assistants Qi Sheng (Â≤êÁõõ) and Gongsun Hong (ÂÖ¨Â≠´ÂÆè) thereafter falsely told Empress Jia that Sima Liang and Wei planned to depose the emperor. Empress Jia, who had already resented Wei for having, during Emperor Wu's reign, suggested that he change his heir selection, also wanted more direct control over the government, and therefore resolved to undergo a second coup. In summer 291, Empress Jia had Emperor Hui personally write an edict to Sima Wei, ordering him to have Sima Liang and Wei Guan removed from their offices. His forces thereby surrounded Sima Liang and Wei Guan's mansions, and while both men's subordinates recommended resistance, each declined and was captured. Against what the edict said, both were killed‚ÄîSima Liang with his heir Sima Ju (Âè∏È¶¨Áü©) and Wei Guan with nine of his sons and grandsons. (Initially, the soldiers respected Sima Liang and did not dare to kill him, and indeed, as he sat in the prisoner's wagon, it appeared clear that he was suffering from the heat, and passersby were allowed to use fans to try to alleviate his suffering. Only after Sima Wei issued an order that whoever dared to cut off Sima Liang's head would receive a large sum of silk as reward did someone carry out the execution.)

The World Federation of Democratic Youth had decided to celebrate its first festival there in remembrance of the events of October and November 1939, when thousands of young Czechs rose in demonstrations against the occupation of the country by Nazi Germany. This caused a wave of repression that included the closing of all the superior schools, the arrest of more than 1850 students, and the internment of 1200 in the Nazi concentration camps. The WFYS also paid tribute to the Czech cities of Lidice and Le≈æ√°ky, which were eradicated as a response to the assassination of the German governor Reinhard Heydrich, nicknamed The Butcher of Prague. The WFYS was officially inaugurated before a crowd of 17,000 at Strahov Stadium on the afternoon of July 25, 1947. The blue flag with the emblem of the World Federation of Democratic Youth was raised and, for the first time, the Song of Democratic Youth, composed by Anatoli Novikov with lyrics by Lev Oshanin, was heard. This was the longest Festival in its history, lasting almost four weeks. Among the sporting events was an athletics competition.World Student Games (UIE). GBR Athletics. Retrieved on 2014-12-09.

Overview  The song was made in 1994 and is performed in theaters since then. He sings the song in an appearance of a person in Edo period with florid golden kimono, dancing with steps of samba and hip swaying, and with many male and female backup dancers around also in figures of the period. Because he plays a serious sh≈çgun as an actor on television in the first place and had been performing the song only in theaters, the performance amazed people who did not know it upon being introduced on television in 2004. The song became the biggest hit in the Matsuken Samba series. All the songs in the series combine traditional-style Japanese vocals with a slight Latino flair from Brazilian samba music and the inclusion of several Brazilian Portuguese words and phrases in the lyrics, although Matsuken Samba II has a word \\"bongo\\" which is a musical instrument not used in samba. The performances of the songs have a very glitzy, showy production value trademarked by his glittery appearance. The Matsuken in the title is a shortened version of the singer's name, a combination of Matsu from Matsudaira and his stage name Ken.  History  The first single of the line was this Matsuken Samba II, released on July 7, 2004. The song was officially a sequel to Matsuken Samba I that he had been performing at the close of his concerts prior to 2004, which was not released on CDs until it was added as one of the b-sides to Matsuken Samba II. Upon release, the song was a modest hit, mostly among Matsudaira's fanbase of primarily middle-aged women. But a gradual increase in media coverage and an affectionate parody of the song and dance by Katsuken on the popular idol group SMAP's television show SMAP√óSMAP made the song a certified hit. The single remained on the Oricon Top 100 chart for over a year, and spawned two additional single releases: Matsuken Samba II: Ole! EP, a CD of remixes of the original single, and Matsuken Samba III, a follow-up single that borrowed liberally from its predecessor. The latest in the series, released in 2014, is \\"Matsuken Samba 4 - Jounetsu no Salsa („Éû„ÉÑ„Ç±„É≥„Çµ„É≥„Éê4~ÊÉÖÁÜ±„ÅÆ„Çµ„É´„Çµ~)\\", and as the title implies, it is more so a Salsa than a Samba.

Bushman taught at Brigham Young University, Harvard University, Boston University, and the University of Delaware before joining the history faculty at Columbia. Bushman is the author of Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling, an important biography of Joseph Smith, and he serves as one of three general editors of the Joseph Smith Papers. Bushman has been called \\"one of the most important scholars of American religious history\\" of the late 20th century, and in 2012 a $3 million donation to the University of Virginia established the Richard Lyman Bushman Chair of Mormon Studies in his honor. Biography By Study and Also By Faith Documentary Richard L. Bushman was born on 20 June 1931, in Salt Lake City, Utah. His father, Ted Bushman (1902‚Äì1980), was a fashion illustrator, advertiser, and department store executive, and his mother, Dorothy Bushman (n√©e Lyman; 1908‚Äì1995), was a secretary and homemaker. Bushman's family moved to Portland, Oregon, when he was a young child. After graduating from high school in 1949, Bushman spent two years as an LDS missionary in the northeastern United States. After completing his missionary service, he matriculated at Harvard University, graduating in 1955 with an A.B. magna cum laude in history. Bushman married fellow historian Claudia Lauper Bushman in August 1955 and the couple raised six children. Bushman continued at Harvard as a graduate student, earning A.M. and Ph.D. degrees in the History of American Civilization, where he studied with distinguished early American historian Bernard Bailyn. While still a graduate student he was awarded the Sheldon Fellowship to work on his dissertation in London. Bushman first taught at Brigham Young University from 1960 to 1968 but two of those years he spent out on a doctoral fellowship to study history and psychology at Brown University. In 1967, he won the Bancroft Prize for his published dissertation, From Puritan to Yankee: Character and the Social Order in Connecticut, 1690-1765. Bushman was awarded a year-long fellowship in 1969 at Harvard's Charles Warren Center. At Harvard he was recruited to teach by Boston University. In 1977, Bushman transferred from Boston University to the University of Delaware to work with material culture at the Winterthur Museum. In an interview with Jed Woodworth, a historian, Bushman's \\"major work on refinement and gentility dated from those years, which included a year-long fellowship at the Smithsonian Institution.\\" In 1989, Bushman was asked to teach American Colonial history at Columbia University. During his time at Columbia he completed year-long fellowships at the Davis Center at Princeton, the National Humanities Center, and the Huntington Library. It was at the Huntington Library in 1997 that Bushman started his biography of Joseph Smith entitled Rough Stone Rolling. Bushman decided to retire from Columbia in 2001 to work full-time on the Joseph Smith biography. Bushman was recognized by Columbia University and become the Gouverneur Morris Professor of History in 1992. From 2008 to 2011, Bushman served as the first Howard W. Hunter Chair of Mormon Studies at Claremont Graduate University and held a Huntington Library fellowship. In 2012, the University of Virginia established the Richard Lyman Bushman Chair of Mormon studies in the Department of Religious Studies. The chair was funded by a $3 million endowment by anonymous donors. Awards and honors Bushman addressing the John Whitmer Historical Association in 2011 Bushman's scholarship includes studies of early American social, cultural, and political history, American religious history, and the history of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). In 1968, Bushman's From Puritan to Yankee: Character and Social Order in Connecticut, 1690-1765 won the Bancroft Prize, an award given by the trustees of Columbia University for the year's best book on American history. Bushman has also received the Phi Alpha Theta prize, and Evans Biography Awards, administered by the Mountain West Center for Regional Studies at Utah State University. He published Joseph Smith and the Beginnings of Mormonism, which was awarded best biography from the Mormon History Association in 1985. Bushman has held Guggenheim, Huntington, National Humanities Center, and National Endowment for the Humanities fellowships; and served as president of the Mormon History Association (1985‚Äì1986). Bushman was honored at the January 2011 annual meeting of the American Historical Association (MHA) where a breakout session entitled A Retrospective on the Scholarship of Richard Bushman was heavily attended. Rough Stone Rolling Bushman's work, Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling focuses heavily on new Mormon history. Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling sold over 100,000 copies and gathered many awards including the Evans Biography Award and the Mormon History Association's annual 2006 Best Book award. According to an article by Larry Gordon, LA Times writer, the initial response to the biography has \\"garnered many positive reviews, although some critics said it uncomfortably straddled reverence and logic.\\" Religion Bushman is a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He interrupted his undergraduate studies at Harvard to serve as a missionary in New England and Atlantic Canada where he overcame doubts about the existence of God and became convinced that the Book of Mormon was right.Richard Lyman Bushman, Believing History: Latter-Day Saint Essays (New York: Columbia University Press, 2007), 21-22. He later held various positions within the LDS Church, including Seminary teacher, bishop, stake president, and stake patriarch. On his decision to study the religion he is affiliated with Bushman replied, \\"Would you say that the only people who can do black studies are not blacks, or that to do women's studies you have to be a non-woman? You get all sorts of people who have deep personal commitments to a subject they teach, and that has its advantages.\\"  Publications  * From Puritan to Yankee: Character and the Social Order in Connecticut, 1690-1765.

She was the granddaughter of Josephine de Beauharnais, Empress of the French. Her father, Eug√®ne de Beauharnais, was the only son of Empress Josephine and her first husband Alexandre, Viscount of Beauharnais. He thus became a stepson of Napoleon Bonaparte when his mother married the future emperor. The mother of Empress Am√©lie was Princess Augusta, daughter of Maximilian I, King of Bavaria.  Family, childhood and youth  Am√©lie was the fourth child of General Eug√®ne de Beauharnais and his wife Princess Augusta of Bavaria. Her father was the son of Jos√©phine de Beauharnais and her first husband, Viscount Alexandre de Beauharnais. When Jos√©phine remarried, to Napoleon Bonaparte, Eug√®ne was adopted by the latter and made viceroy of the Kingdom of Italy. Am√©lie's mother was the daughter of King Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria and his first consort, Princess Augusta Wilhelmine of Hesse-Darmstadt. Among Am√©lie's siblings were Josephine of Leuchtenberg, queen consort of King Oscar I of Sweden, and Auguste de Beauharnais, 2nd Duke of Leuchtenberg, prince consort of Queen Maria II of Portugal (stepdaughter of Am√©lie). Napoleon III was Am√©lie's first cousin. After the defeat of Napoleon Bonaparte in 1814, Eug√®ne de Beauharnais, having been granted the title Duke of Leuchtenberg by his father-in-law, settled in Munich. The possibility occurred to Am√©lie's mother, Augusta, of marrying Am√©lie to the Emperor of Brazil, to guarantee the pretensions of the House of Leuchtenberg to royal status.  Marriage  Portrait of Am√©lie of Leuchtenberg; Franz Xaver Winterhalter, 19th century. After the death of his first wife, the Austrian archduchess Maria Leopoldina, in December 1826, Emperor Pedro I of Brazil (and King Pedro IV of Portugal) sent the Marquis of Barbacena to Europe to find him a second wife. His task was not easy; several factors complicated the search. First, Dom Pedro had stipulated four conditions: a good family background, beauty, virtue and culture. Conversely, the emperor of Brazil did not have a particularly good image in Europe: his relationship with the Marchioness of Santos was notorious, and few eligible princesses were expected to be eager to leave the courts of Europe to marry a widower who had a tarnished reputation as a husband, becoming step-mother to his five children. To make matters worse, the former father-in-law of Dom Pedro, Francis I of Austria, had a low opinion of his son-in-law's political views, and apparently acted to prevent a new marriage to ensure that his grandchildren would inherit the throne of Brazil if they survived infancy.Witte, Claudia Thom√©. \\"O casamento com D. Pedro I e toda a trajet√≥ria no Brasil da princesa b√°vara Am√©lia de Leuchtenberg\\" . In: Revista de Hist√≥ria online, . In Portuguese. Accessed . After refusals by eight princesses turned the ambassador into an object of scorn in the courts of Europe, Barbacena, in agreement with the Emperor, lowered his requirements, seeking for Dom Pedro a wife merely \\"good and virtuous.\\" Am√©lie now became a good possibility, but their encounter was brought about not by Barbacena, but by Domingos Borges de Barros, Viscount of Pedra Branca, minister in Paris, to whom she had been pointed out.Lustosa, Isabel. D. Pedro I. Companhia das Letras, 2006, pp. 284‚Äì286. In Portuguese. She came from a distinguished and ancient line on her mother's side, the Wittelsbachs, but her father, an exile who shared in the disgrace of Napoleon Bonaparte's deposition as emperor, was not an optimal marital match. However, that was her sole \\"defect\\". The princess was tall, very beautiful, well proportioned, with a delicate face. She had blues eyes and brownish-golden hair. Ant√≥nio Teles da Silva Caminha e Meneses, Marquis of Resende, sent to verify the beauty of the young lady, praised her highly, saying that she had \\"a physical air that like that the painter Correggio gave us in his paintings of the Queen of Sheba\\". She was also cultured and sensitive. A contemporary piece in The Times of London affirms that she was one of the best educated and best prepared princesses in the German world.Pinheiro Neto, Jo√£o. Pedro e Domitila: Amor em tempo de paix√£o. Mauad Editora Ltda, 2002, pp. 243‚Äì244. In Portuguese. The marriage contract was signed on in England, and ratified on June 30 in Munich by Am√©lie's mother, the Duchess of Leuchtenberg, who had tutored her daughter personally. On 30 July of that year, in Brazil, a treaty of marriage between Pedro I and Am√©lie of Leuchtenberg was promulgated. Upon confirming the marriage, Dom Pedro definitively broke his links to the Marchioness of Santos and, as evidence of his good intentions, instituted the Order of the Rose, with the motto \\"Amor e Fidelidade\\" (\\"Love and Fidelity\\"). A proxy marriage ceremony on 2 August in the chapel of the Palais Leuchtenberg in Munich was a simple affair with few in attendance, as Am√©lie insisted on donating to a Munich orphanage the appreciable amount Dom Pedro had sent for a ceremony with full pomp. Dom Pedro was represented by the Marquis of Barbacena. Am√©lie was barely seventeen years old; Dom Pedro was thirty. Am√©lie's mother foresaw the difficulties her daughter might face, and prepared her carefully. Besides a good dowry and trousseau, she gave her a great deal of advice, recommending that she be demonstrative of her feelings and overcome any timidity so as not to discourage her husband, that she be loving toward her stepchildren, and above all that she remain faithful, as empress, to the interests of the Brazilians. Scientist Carl Friedrich von Martius was sent with her on the journey to teach her about Brazil, and Ana Romana de Arag√£o Calmon, Countess of Itapagipe, to familiarize her with her husband's personality and the customs of the Brazilian court, and to teach her Portuguese.  Arrival in Brazil and life as empress The Emperor's Second Marriage, painted by Jean- Baptiste Debret. Am√©lie sailed to the New World from Ostende, Belgium on the frigate Imperatriz, arriving in Rio de Janeiro on , after a crossing that went more rapidly than planned. Traditions says that upon hearing that the ship was approaching, Dom Pedro embarked on a tugboat to meet it on the far side of the bar, and that he collapsed with emotion upon seeing his wife on deck. Among those accompanying her on board were Barbacena and the 10-year-old Maria II of Portugal in whose favor her father had renounced his rights to the Portuguese throne back in 1826. Barbacena, on that same trip, had received the mission to bring Maria to the care of her grandfather, Austrian emperor Francis I, but in the middle of the journey learned that the throne of the latter had been usurped by Miguel, brother of Dom Pedro, and decided instead to take her to England, which he considered a safer place. After concluding the imperial marriage contract, they embarked again for Brazil together with Am√©lie's entourage, including Am√©lie's brother, Auguste de Beauharnais, 2nd Duke of Leuchtenberg. Shortly after the newlyweds' first encounter, Dom Pedro's children by his first marriage were brought out to their new stepmother's ship for the couple and children to lunch together. The following day at noon, under a heavy rain, Am√©lie disembarked and was received with a solemn procession. She then went with Dom Pedro to the Imperial Chapel to receive the nuptial blessings. All were dazzled by her beauty, highlighted by a long white gown and a robe embroidered in silver, in the French fashion. After the ceremony came a public celebration with fireworks, and a grand state banquet for the court. Engraving of Am√©lie of Leuchtenberg Jean-Baptiste Aubry- Lecomte, after a painting by an unknown artist In January 1830 the new empress was formally presented in court, with a dance at which all of the ladies dressed in pink, the empress's favorite color. The following day, the couple began their honeymoon, spending six weeks at the ranch of Father Correa, in Serra da Estrela, future locale of the city of Petr√≥polis. On their return they encountered a court troubled by problems caused by the emperor's intimate confidante Chala√ßa (Francisco Gomes da Silva). Barbacena took the opportunity to rid himself of his old foe, recommending that he leave for Europe, in which he counted on the support of the new empress, anxious to break one more link to her husband's adventurous past. She had already shown a strong attitude in refusing from the outset to receive at court Isabel Maria de Alc√¢ntara, Duchess of Goi√°s, Dom Pedro's daughter by the Marchioness of Santos, and demanding that Isabel Maria be sent to school in Switzerland. Upon settling into the imperial palace, the Pa√ßo de S√£o Crist√≥v√£o, and perceiving what she considered an inadequate standard of protocol, Am√©lie established French as the court language and adopted a ceremonial modeled after European courts. She sought to update the cuisine and fashion, redecorated the palace, acquired new tableware and silverware, and attempted to refine the manners of the court. She achieved at least a partial success in this last, and the elegance of the Empress, always impeccably dressed, became internationally famous.Del Priore, Mary. \\"Amor e fidelidade num casamento imperial: Dom Pedro I e Dona Am√©lia. In: Gazeta Imperial, August 2011, year XVI, number 189, pp. 8‚Äì9. In Portuguese. Their marriage was a happy one, unlike Dom Pedro's first, and she reportedly had a good relationship with her legitimate stepchildren as well. Her beauty, good sense, and kindness promptly won the affections of both her husband and his children by his first marriage. She made sure that the latter had a good family environment and received a good education. Shortly after the marriage, a French traveler reported \\"it appears that the empress continues to exercise her influence over the children of Dom Pedro. The happy results are already apparent, she has already made considerable renovations to the palace, and order has commenced to reign; the princesses' education is supervised and directed personally by the empress\\", with the same care going to the heir to the throne, little Pedro de Alc√¢ntara (later Pedro II of Brazil); the proof of this last being that he soon began to call her \\"mam√£e\\" (\\"mommy\\"). Am√©lie always expressed her affection for Pedro II, and maintained a correspondence with him until the end of her life, trying to instruct and support him. Nearly six decades of their correspondence survive. Dom Pedro II reciprocated her kindness, soliciting her help in arranging marriages for his own daughters and visiting her in Lisbon in 1871.Carvalho, Jos√© Murilo de. D. Pedro II: ser ou n√£o ser.

Her presence was also important in restoring her husband's popularity and giving him courage during a difficult period for the new empire, but the popular enthusiasm generated by the marriage was short-lived. Jos√© Bonif√°cio advised her on what her husband would need to do to reconcile with the people of Brazil, but nothing worked. The precarious economic situation and political turbulence precipitated the inevitable crisis and on , Dom Pedro abdicated the throne in favor of his young son. Return to Europe Emperor Pedro I of Brazil with his second wife Am√©lie and eldest daughter Queen Maria II of Portugal, just a few months before Pedro's death, 1834. After Dom Pedro I abdicated the crown, Am√©lie accompanied her husband back to Europe. They now held the titles of Duke and Duchess of Braganza. She was three months pregnant and suffered badly from nausea on the sea voyage. After resupplying the ship at Faial Island in the Azores, they arrived at Cherbourg, in France, on . They were received with the honors appropriate to reigning monarchs, greeted with a 21-gun cannon salute and by a detachment of 5,000 soldiers of the National Guard. The prefecture of the city offered them a palace as accommodation, but a mere ten days after their arrival Dom Pedro left for London, leaving behind Am√©lie, who was reunited with Maria da Gl√≥ria the 23rd of the same month.Lustosa, p. 305 Am√©lie soon established residence in Paris, with Maria da Gl√≥ria and with Dom Pedro's illegitimate daughter Isabel Maria, Duchess of Goi√°s, whom Am√©lie ended up adopting as her own daughter.Sousa, Oct√°vio Tarqu√≠nio de.

Her father expressed his happiness in a letter to young Dom Pedro II: \\"Divine Providence has seen fit to diminish the sadness my paternal heart feels for the separation from V.M.I. (Vossa Majestade Imperial, \\"Your Imperial Majesty\\") giving to me a daughter and, to V.M.I., another sister and subject\\".Almeida, Sylvia Lacerda Martins de. Uma filha de D.

Meanwhile, Dom Pedro I, as Duke of Braganza, began a bloody battle against his brother Dom Miguel I of Portugal for the Portuguese crown, in the name of his daughter Maria da Gl√≥ria. Upon receiving the news of the Duke's victory in Lisbon, Am√©lie left with her daughter and stepdaughter for Portugal, arriving in the capital on .Sousa, p. 275 With Miguel defeated and exiled from Portugal, Dom Pedro and his family established themselves first at Ramalh√£o Palace and later at Queluz National Palace.Almeida, p. 54  Widowhood and final years  Maria Am√©lia, 1840. Maria Am√©lia, the Empress's only child, circa 1849. The venturesome life of Dom Pedro had undermined his health; he contracted tuberculosis, and died . Am√©lie respected the provisions of his will. He had wished that Maria Isabel de Alc√¢ntara, Countess of Igua√ßu, his illegitimate daughter by the Marchioness of Santos, be given a good European education like her sister, the Duchess of Goi√°s. However, the Marchioness declined to send the girl. Dom Pedro also stipulated legacies for his other illegitimate children, reducing the inheritance of Am√©lie and her own daughter; the provision showed that Dom Pedro loved all his children, legitimate or not.Lewin, Linda. Surprise Heirs: Illegitimacy, inheritance rights, and public power in the formation of Imperial Brazil, 1822‚Äì1889. Stanford University Press, 2003, pp. 155‚Äì156. Am√©lie never remarried; she moved to the Pal√°cio das Janelas Verdes (\\"Palace of Green Windows,\\" also known as the Pal√°cio de Alvor- Pombal, now housing Portugal's National Museum of Ancient Art) and dedicated herself to charitable works and to her daughter's education. Maria Am√©lia showed herself to be very intelligent and to be a talented musician. Occasionally, Am√©lie visited Bavaria with her daughter. Despite being established in Portugal, they were not considered part of the Portuguese royal family. Am√©lie solicited recognition for herself and her daughter as members of the Brazilian imperial family, thereby entitled to a pension, but Dom Pedro II was still a minor and the Brazilian Regency feared possible influence by the empress-widow Am√©lie in state business, as well as the possibility of her adherence to political factions that might harm the government. They refused to recognize her daughter Maria Am√©lie as a Brazilian princess and forbade her to set foot in the country. This situation changed when Dom Pedro II reached majority. His relations with them were good, and on Am√©lie and Maria Am√©lia were recognized as members of the Brazilian imperial family.Lyra, Heitor. Hist√≥ria de Dom Pedro II (1825‚Äì1891): Ascens√£o (1825‚Äì1870). Belo Horizonte: Itatiaia, 1977. vol. 1, pp. 42‚Äì43; 279. In Portuguese. Prior to that, Maria Am√©lia's status and place in the line of succession had been doubtful, because she was conceived in Brazil while her father, Pedro I, was still the emperor, but was born abroad, after his abdication, and Brazil's Constitution invested the Imperial Parliament to settle doubts pertaining to the imperial succession. Soon after the start of his personal reign, Pedro II requested that Parliament should recognize his sister's rights. On , Pedro II finally signed into law the statute approved by the Brazilian Parliament, recognizing Maria Am√©lia as a Brazilian princess. A rare photograph of the Empress in her final years. Princess Maria Am√©lia became engaged to Archduke Maximilian of Austria (later Emperor Maximilian of Mexico) at the beginning of 1852, but shortly afterward began to show symptoms of tuberculosis.

Under the terms of her will, her sister, Queen Josephine of Sweden, was her primary heir (receiving, among other things, the Braganza tiara), but many documents pertaining to Dom Pedro were willed to Brazil, where they reside in the Historic Archive of the Imperial Museum of Brazil in Petr√≥polis. Her remains were transported in 1982 to the crypt of the Monument to the Independence of Brazil in S√£o Paulo.Tirapeli, Percival e Silva, Manoel Nunes da. S√£o Paulo artes e etnias.

Family, youth and accession Sam Mirza was born in February 1648 (or March); he was the elder son of the previous shah Abbas II and Circassian slave Nakihat Khanum. Sam Mirza had a younger brother named Hamza Mirza, as well as two other brothers named Ismail Mirza and Mirza Ali Naqi. He also had two unnamed sisters. Sam Mirza grew up isolated in the royal harem, where he was cared for by Agha Nazira, a eunuch. Because of this, Sam Mirza's first language was Azerbaijani; it is still not clearly known how much Persian he was able to speak. Furthermore, due to the way Sam Mirza was raised, he was much less experienced and less energetic than his father, which had significant consequences for his reign. Abbas II died in Mazandaran on 25 September 1666, without revealing his successor. Five days later, the news spread to Isfahan. The eunuchs, who took care of the palace, now got to name the successor;. Most of them preferred the seven year-old Hamza Mirza, who they could easily control. However, the matter was decided when Hamza Mirza's tutor made a statement in the court supporting Sam Mirza to assume the throne. Reign=Reign after first coronation; 1666-1668 Artwork of Suleiman I's first coronation in 1666. One day later, on 1 October 1666, Sam Mirza was crowned as Safi II. The ceremony took place in the afternoon and was managed by Mohammad-Baqer Sabzavari, the shaykh al-Islam of Isfahan. Safi II was given the heads of some dead Uzbeks, and in turn rewarded those who had given him the heads with money. He also gave money to 300 exiles from the Ottoman Empire who sought refuge in Iran to avoid being enrolled into the Ottoman army. All administrative positions were reconfirmed that same day. The name \\"Abbas II\\" was removed from royal stamps, and new coins were minted in Safi II's name. Demonstrating the sleekness of the changeover, the city of Isfahan remained peaceful; \\"the shops stayed open, and life went on as if nothing had happened, causing foreign residents who, fearing disturbances and looting, had kept their houses locked, to emerge before the day was out.\\" The first year of his reign was markedly unsuccessful. A series of natural disasters such as earthquakes (1667 Shamakhi earthquake) in Shirvan, spread of deadly diseases around Iran, combined with devastating raids by the Cossack Stenka Razin on the coast of the Caspian Sea, convinced court astrologers that the coronation had taken place at the wrong time, and the ceremony was repeated on March 20, 1668. The shah took the new name Suleiman I. He had little interest in the business of government, preferring retreat to the harem. Reign after second coronation; 1668-1694 He left political decision-making to his grand viziers or to a council of harem eunuchs, whose power increased during the shah's reign. Corruption became widespread in Persia and discipline in the army was dangerously lax. At the same time revenues increased by the imposition of new taxes and higher taxes. This affected the country's economy and spread poverty, which resulted in many rebellions even in Suleiman's capital Isfahan. In 1672, shah Suleiman offered the former vizier Mohammad Beg to become vizier once again, which he agreed to, but while on his way to Isfahan, he died. According to the French traveler Jean Chardin, Mohammad Beg had been poisoned by Suleiman's vizier Shaykh Ali Khan Zangana. In 1676, Suleiman appointed the Georgian prince George XI as the ruler of Kartli. By the 1670s, Georgians came to make up an even larger part of the actual Safavid fighting forces, reaching a contested number of 40,000. Suleiman made no attempt to exploit the weakness of Safavid Persia's traditional rival, the Ottoman Empire, after the Ottomans suffered a serious defeat at the Battle of Vienna in 1683. He even refused the proposals from the European states to form a coalition against the Ottoman Empire. Persia also suffered raids by the Uzbeks and Kalmyks on the eastern and northern (North Caucasus) borders of the empire respectively. In 1688, George XI rebelled against Suleiman, and tried to urge the Ottomans to aid him. However, his request for help was fruitless, and Suleiman appointed another Georgian prince named Heraclius I as the ruler of Kartli, and forced George XI to flee from Kartli. To secure Iranian control over Kartli, he appointed Abbas-Quli Khan as the viceroy of the region. The Qizilbash remained an important part of the Safavid executive apparatus, even though ethnic Caucasians had come to largely replace them. For example, even in the 1690s, when ethnic Georgians formed the mainstay of the Safavid military, the Qizilbash still played a significant role in the army.  Diplomatic activity  Diplomatic activity had already started decreasing since the reign of Shah Abbas I (r. 1587‚Äì1629), but it decreased even more under Suleiman. Although Suleiman had requested King William III of England for adept artisans in 1668/69, he is not known to have been involved in an operating foreign diplomacy. Denmark In 1687 a ship of the Danish East India Company captured a Bengali ship and transported it into the port of Trankebar, which at that time was part of a Danish colony on the southeastern coast of India. The goods of the ship belonged to Armenian traders from New Julfa at Isfahan in Iran. The Danes had the ship with its wares sent to their capital of Copenhagen, where four years later a Safavid diplomat showed up to settle a payment for the goods. On 11 December 1691, the Safavid diplomat showed King Christian V (r. 1670-99) his diploma and a letter from Suleiman I directed to an earlier king, Christian III. The letter contained an inclusive stock of the contested goods and the names of the Armenian traders. Albeit the diplomat returned fortuneless, the elegantly adornmented wrapper in which he had bore his diploma and the letter is preserved in the Danish Museum of Art & Design. Appearance The French traveler Jean Chardin, who met the Safavid king in the late 1660s (or early 1670s), wrote that he was a tall and elegant, with blond hair dyed black, blue eyes, and pale white skin. His pale skin is often noticeable in various portraits of him. According to Nicolas Sanson, Suleiman was \\"tall, strong and active; a fine prince, a little too effeminate for a monarch who should be a warrior, with an aquiline nose, large blue eyes, a beard dyed black\\". Death and succession Suleiman died on July 29, 1694 at Isfahan, either as a result of heavy drinking or gout. On his deathbed, he asked his court eunuchs to choose between his two sons, saying that if they wanted peace and quiet they should pick the elder, Sultan Husayn, but if they wanted to make the empire more powerful then they should opt for the younger, Abbas Mirza. The ennuchs decided to make Sultan Husayn the new shah of Iran. Issue Suleiman I married numerous times, including Elena, daughter of the Atabegi of Samtzkh√©, in Georgia.

It was first published by American comic book publisher Pacific Comics in 1981. Kirby agreed to create a comic for the fledgling publisher because Pacific promised him full creative control, and ownership of the characters. Publication history One of Pacific Comics first titles, the original run of Captain Victory and the Galactic Rangers lasted thirteen issues, plus a special, through January, 1984. All were written, illustrated, and edited by Jack Kirby. In the last issues of the Pacific series, Kirby crafted an origin story for Captain Victory which he tied into the New Gods comic book that he had written and drawn for DC Comics in the 1970s. It was suggested that Captain Victory was the son of Orion, of the New Gods. Orion was not specifically named, but a number of clues were planted, including equipment said to belong to Captain Victory's father that was identical to the astro- harness ridden by Orion in the earlier series. Additionally, Captain Victory's grandfather, Blackmaas, was illustrated only as a cast shadow, but a shadow that to many readers bore a resemblance to Orion's father, Darkseid.Morrow, John \\"The Captain Victory Connection\\" (collected in The Collected Jack Kirby Collector Volume 1, TwoMorrows Publishing, . page 105) After the end of Pacific, no more was seen of Captain Victory until Topps Comics attempted to revive the character as part of planned 5-issue mini-series. It only lasted one issue (Victory #1, June 1994) before Topps cancelled all of the 'Kirbyverse' books in 1994. This issue was a part of a more complex project named Secret City Saga. TwoMorrows Publishing created a 'graphite edition' reprint of the first Captain Victory issue. The edition, in TwoMorrow's words, \\"presented [Captain Victory #1] as it was created (before it was broken up for the later Pacific Comics series), reproduced from copies of Jack's uninked pencils!\\" In 2000, Jack Kirby's grandson Jeremy Kirby launched Jack Kirby Comics, the fledgling company's only offering being a three-issue retelling of Captain Victory, reordered and rescripted by Jeremy. The quality of issues, anyway, is judged fairly inferior to the originals, despite the interesting cover art. The title of the comic book is the same as the original from 1981. The 3rd issue was published exclusively on the web. In March 2006, it was announced that a new series would be published, based on recently discovered initial, and rejected, character sketches for the Wonder Warriors. Lisa Kirby, Mike Thibodeaux, and Tom Brevoort on Galactic Bounty Hunters , Newsarama, September 29, 2006 Jack Kirby's Galactic Bounty Hunters was co-written by Jack's daughter, Lisa, and is creator-owned by her under Marvel's Icon imprint. Captain Victory and the Galactic Rangers guest-starred in issue #3 of the six-issue limited series. In late 2011, Dynamite Entertainment started a new series under the Kirby: Genesis title, which used many of Kirby's created and owned characters (many unpublished), including Captain Victory. This led, in November 2011, to a new Captain Victory title which lasted six issues. It was later collected into a trade paperback. A new continuing series, Captain Victory and the Galactic Rangers, written by Joe Casey and published by Dynamite Entertainment, is scheduled to begin in August 2014.Casey Brings Back Kirby‚Äôs CAPTAIN VICTORY, Newsarama, May 20, 2014 It ran for 6 issues and was collected into a trade paperback in 2016.

He was a well-educated aristocrat, and a Lieutenant-Colonel who commanded the personal guard of William VI, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel (or Hesse-Cassel), and acted as a personal aide to the ruler, with the title kammerjunker or Chamberlain. Early life Siegen came from an aristocratic family, and may have been born in the family castle of Von Sechten near Cologne, not in Utrecht, as traditionally believed, as he was baptised in Cologne in mars 1609.KL Spangeberg (ed), Six Centuries of Master Prints, Cincinnati Art Museum, 1993, no , His mother had died (perhaps in his birth) and his father moved to Holland when Ludwig was young, apparently because of his Calvinist beliefs. Here his father remarried, to an Anna Perez, a widow from Spain, also adopting her son Marcus Perez. Anna died in 1619 leaving Johann to resolve the future of both boys (Ludwig and Marcus). He obtained a place in a German school for Marcus but Ludwig remained in Holland with his step-mother's family to avoid the dangers of the recently begun Thirty Years War in Germany.The Mezzotint, History and Technique by Carol Wax Sechten was in Hesse-Kassel, and his father Johann von Siegen became an advisor to the Landgrave, Maurice, who in 1620 appointed him chancellor of the Collegium Mauritaneum, a school for young aristocrats which Siegen attended from 1621 to 1626. Then he studied law at the Hohe Schule in Herborn. His father moved to Holland to again in 1627, when the new Landgrave William V dissolved the Collegium Mauritaneum. Little is known about Siegen's life between 1629 and 1639, when he asked William V's widow, now Regent for her son William VI, for a position. He may have seen active military service in these missing years in the middle of the Thirty Years War. He was appointed kammerjunker, which as the Landgrave was a minor, may have been effectively a tutorial position, as well as head of the personal guard of the ruler. By 1641 he had decided to convert to Catholicism, which in the atmosphere of the Thirty Years War would not have been compatible with his position in the strictly Calvinistic court of Hesse-Kassel. After some friction at court, he therefore repeated his father's move to Holland, although for the opposite reason. He moved to Amsterdam in 1641 and announced his conversion there, remaining in contact with his former employers and sending them works of art he produced, sometimes commissioned by them. Invention of mezzotint Early mezzotint by Vaillerant, Siegen's assistant or tutor. Young man reading, with statue of Cupid. 27,5 x 21,3 cm In Amsterdam Siegen must have been aware of Rembrandt's increasingly tonal etchings, achieved by conventional methods, filling in the dark areas by repeated lines. In Italy at the same time Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione was also exploring the possibilities of tonality in printmaking, leading him to invent monotyping at almost the same moment as Siegen invented mezzotint. Mezzotint achieves tonality by roughening the plate with thousands of little dots made by a metal tool with small teeth. In a letter of 6 March 1641 to the Landgravine, Siegen announced that he had begun a portrait of her, and hinted that he would appreciate some money. News of his conversion had just reached the court, and the response seems to have been restrained. In August 1642, he finally finished the first known mezzotint engraving, a portrait of the Landgravine Amalia Elisabeth, Regent of Hesse-Kassel, the widow of his former employer. He sent this to her son, Landgrave William VI with a letter explaining that he had invented the process: \\".... I could not pass up dedicating such a rare and previously unseen work of art in humble honour before anyone else to your highness who is an extraordinary connoisseur of art. The way this work is made, no engraver or artist could explain or guess.\\". The portrait is rather stiff, but the full range of tones from the very light ones on the layered lace collars to the solid black of the left background make it a very effective showpiece for the potential of mezzotint. He worked from \\"light to dark\\", only roughening the plate where he wanted to produce tones, using \\"roulettes\\" or wheels with sharp teeth. This is unlike most later mezzotinters, who first roughened the whole plate, then scraped or burnished the roughness away where they wanted lighter tones, so working from \\"dark to light\\". In 1643‚Äì44, he produced portraits of Elizabeth of Bohemia, (the \\"Winter Queen\\", daughter of James I of England), William II of Orange and his wife, Mary, all after paintings by Gerard van Honthorst. All were perhaps potential employers. In 1654 he did a large portrait of Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor from memory, having seen him at the Diet in Regensburg. He distributed copies to the various princes gathered there, without attracting further commissions. Apart from portraits he did a St Bruno and in 1657 copied a Holy Family with St John the Baptist by Annibale Carracci.Anthony Griffiths (ed),\\"Landmarks in Print Collecting\\",1996, British Museum Press, His total mezzotint production was these seven plates, although he also produced paintings and medals. Siegen's later career After he left Amsterdam in 1644, Siegen first entered the armies of the Catholic Bishop of Hildesheim, and then those of the Archbishop of Cologne. In 1654, he went into the service of the Archbishop-Elector of Mainz as a Colonel retired from active service and then to the Protestant Augustus the Younger, Duke of Brunswick-L√ºneburg at Wolfenb√ºttel, where he remained after retirement. Most documents after this relate to lawsuits over estates and inheritances, the last mention being in 1676. Prince Rupert of the Rhine Prince Rupert of the Rhine (i.e. of the Palatinate), a famous Royalist commander in the English Civil War, was the cousin of William VI of Hesse-Kassel, and the son of Elizabeth of Bohemia. Prince Rupert was also an amateur artist, and in about 1654 learned of the process, either from his cousin, or possibly from Siegen himself - whether they ever met is a point of scholarly controversy. A number of letters between Rupert and William referring to the technique survive from the period following 1654. Rupert produced some stylish mezzotints himself, and through him, after his return to England with the English Restoration in 1660, the invention became known there, which was to be the main home of the technique. Rupert described it to John Evelyn, who published it (in very enigmatic terms) for the first time in 1662, crediting Rupert with the invention: \\" Of the new way of Engraving, or Mezzo Tinto, Invented, and communicated by his Highnesse Prince RUPERT, Count Palatine of Rhyne, &c.;\\" However Rupert probably did invent the \\"rocker\\", a wide curved tool with teeth, used to roughen a whole plate, which was an essential tool in the developed technique. Rupert's artistic assistant or tutor Wallerant Vaillant (1623‚Äì77) was the first to adopt the process commercially, in Amsterdam in the 1660s.

Performing in both English and Spanish, El Teatro Campesino was founded in 1965 as the cultural arm of the United Farm Workers and the Chicano Movement with the \\"full support of C√©sar Ch√°vez.\\" Originally based in Delano, California, during the Delano Strike, the theatre is currently based in San Juan Bautista, California. Currently, El Teatro Campesino‚Äôs mission is ‚Äú‚Ä¶to create a popular art with 21st century tools that presents a more just and accurate account of human history, while encouraging the young women and men of a new generation to take control of their own destiny through creative discipline, vibrant education, economic independence, and artistic excellence.‚Äù  History  Poster for Teatro Campesino performing at a strike benefit with Quicksilver Messenger Service; July 1966 at The Fillmore, San Francisco. Luis Valdez, along with Agustin Lira (Teatro de la Tierra), founded the troupe. After attending San Jose State University and working briefly with the San Francisco Mime Troupe, Luis Valdez met Agustin Lira,a local Chicano with theatrical experience who had already hit upon the idea of using theater as an organizing tool in the fields and was already involved in the United Farmworkers Union in Delano. Teatro Campesino's early performances drew on varied traditions, such as commedia dell'arte, Spanish religious dramas adapted for teaching Mission Indians, Mexican folk humor, a century-old tradition of Mexican performances in California, and Aztec and Maya sacred ritual dramas. El Teatro Campesino started as the cultural wing of the United Farm Workers union in California's central valley, to help raise both Mexican workers and American people awareness of the Delano grape strike controversies during the two years of the strike (1965 ‚Äì 1967). Although the troupe began by entertaining the farmworkers, within a year of their founding they began to tour to raise funds for the striking farm workers. While being relocated to Del Rey, California and then Fresno, California from 1967-1971, their subject matter had expanded to include aspects of Chicano culture that went beyond the fields: education, the Vietnam War, indigenous roots, and racism.The work of the theater has been considered by critics of Chicano art, such as Holly Barnet-Sanchez, as a \\"major catalyst for an explosion of Chicano/a arts.\\" Modern era In 1971, they moved their headquarters to San Juan Bautista and adapted traditional religious plays La Virgen del Tepeyac and La Pastorela for Christmas celebrations. As Chicano culture received unprecedented attention in the United States, Valdez received national attention, and taught drama at the University of California, Berkeley and University of California, Santa Cruz. In 1973 they worked with British theater director Peter Brook; in 1976 they toured the play La Carpa through Europe, sponsored by the U.S. State Department. The company continues their yearly Christmas pageants, alternating annually between La Virgen del Tepeyac and La Pastorela. They also did revivals of Valdez's play Zoot Suit in 2002 and 2007 at their playhouse, as well as a Southwestern tour of the production in 2004.

In April 1968, the completed study resulted in a three-volume report that proposed a series of recommendations for redeveloping and expanding Central Area communities, and for the replacement of The Loop elevated rapid transit system with a new loop subway under Randolph, Franklin, Van Buren, and Wabash, and a new distributor subway system in downtown Chicago (see Chicago \\"L\\"). Volume 1 of the three-volume report presented proposals resulting from the study as well as analyses of the various background reports that influenced such proposals. Also included were estimates of usage of the new subway system along with projections of probable economic and social benefits. Aesthetic considerations, construction scheduling and cost estimated were presented. Volume 2 included detailed preliminary plans, architectural, and engineering drawings, which were to be the basis for construction contracts for the proposed loop and distributor subway systems. Volume 3 detailed supplemental data gathered during the study phases. History Throughout its entire life, the two-mile (3 km), double-track loop elevated in Chicago's central area has coexisted with strong pressures, political and civic, to do away with it in favor of new downtown subways. The Union Loop Elevated has remained, however, virtually and placidly what it has been since its early days in the late 1890s to the present. Its trackage has been reworked to accommodate changing operational modes. Stations have been added, lengthened, consolidated and eliminated in response to changing riding habits. While no major alterations have been made during its lifetime, minor changes have been made at the stations to improve passenger flow, accessibility, and weather protection. These modifications have added Monel metal and fiberglass to the basic wood and steel construction and have replaced some of the original ornamentation. The Clark/Lake station was rebuilt from 1988‚Äì1992, and several have been replaced with new stations since then [Library-State/Van Buren, Washington/Wells, and Washington/Wabash], in compliance with ADA [Americans with Disabilities Act] requirements. Since its October 1897 opening, the Union Loop Elevated has provided rail rapid transit service to the Chicago central business district. Its construction permitted the inter-connection of the original elevated railroads, the South Side Elevated, the Lake Street Elevated and the Metropolitan West Side Elevated, and the distribution of passengers around the downtown area. Although development of major high-rise construction went well beyond its physical limits, its presence and configuration originally defined the most prestigious locations for offices and gave the central business district of Chicago its name, the \\"Loop\\". For more than 100 years it has served transit riders and has seen the city grow into a major metropolitan region of more than 9,000,000 people. Noisy, awkward, and casting a shadow over the streets in which it runs above, it has become an institution. From the earliest days when the first elevated railroad was constructed between the Central Area and the South Side in June 1892, the focus of rail rapid transit activity has been the Chicago Loop area. Each net addition to the Elevated system has added to the transportation accessibility of the Loop. The first formal transit plan in Chicago was the Burnham Plan of 1909, which described an extensive rapid transit and streetcar subway system in, and connected to, the central area. Many elements (some transposed with bus service in place of streetcars) are in operation today. This was followed by various traction plans presented by the City from the early twentieth century through the 1930s, all of which called for a unified system of surface, elevated and subway lines in the Loop.  A Comprehensive Plan for the Extension of the Subway System of the City of Chicago (1939)  When the State and Milwaukee‚ÄìDearborn subways were being constructed between 1938 and 1951, A Comprehensive Plan for the Extension of the Subway System of the City of Chicago was published in October 1939, forming the basis for all subsequent rail rapid transit improvements built through 1960. The plan proposed nearly of new rapid transit subways, which included extensions of the Dearborn Street subway and Lake Street subway, as well as the construction of Washington Street and Jackson Street (high-level streetcar) subways, a Wells Street subway, and the Crosstown subways. The plan also suggested a combination of rail rapid transit and expressway facilities within a common right-of-way. It stressed the fact that the \\"outstanding flaw in the existing pattern of Chicago's rapid transit system is the complete absence of facilities for north and south crosstown traffic ...\\", a flaw that exists today. It provided for new subways to be utilized for long-haul traffic, coordinated with surface street feeder and distributor routes within the Central Area. It proposed solutions that would permit the removal of elevated structures in the Loop, thus contributing to the dynamic growth of this area.  New Horizons for Chicago Metropolitan Area (1958)  Proposed (1958) Wells Street subway at Congress Street The next major step in the development of downtown subways in Chicago came in January 1958, when the Chicago Transit Authority proposed the New Horizons for Chicago's Metropolitan Area, a $315 million, 20-year rapid transit improvement and expansion program to be carried out once financial arrangements had been made. The program was divide into three principal categories: ;1.

Estimated cost, $20,000,000. ;3. Rolling stock required for the extensions For these proposed extensions and additions to CTA's rapid transit system, an estimated total of $35,500,000 in rolling stock would be required as follows: Northwest rapid transit extension, $7,500,000; Lake Street elevation and extension, $1,000,000; South Side rapid transit, $12,750,000; Southwest bus rapid transit extension, $630,000; Douglas Park elevation and extension, $1,500,000; Englewood-Clearing extension, $3,120,000; and the Crosstown extension, $9,000,000. ;Result The plan of expanded transit facilities would have undoubtedly benefited the whole Chicago metropolitan area. Many of the projects were basically completed, namely the extension of the West Side subway (Congress Line) in the median of the Eisenhower Expressway (in operation June 22, 1958), Lake Street Elevation (in operation October 28, 1962), a part of the Englewood rapid transit extension (to Ashland/63rd, in operation May 6, 1969), the Dan Ryan rapid transit line (in operation September 28, 1969), the Kennedy and O'Hare rapid transit extensions (in operation February 1, 1970, completed September 3, 1984), massive signal and train control system improvements between 1967 and 1976, and the Southwest rapid transit extension, built in the form of the Midway Line (in operation October 31, 1993). Rolling stock and equipment improvements were made between 1964 and 1992 with the delivery of the High Performance Generation cars (the 2000-Series, 2200-Series, 2400-Series, 2600-Series, and 3200-Series). Modernization of many traction power substations, and remodeling of several outlying terminal stations were also completed. Some curve straightening projects were also completed such as the 2002-built Harrison Street Curve on the Green and Orange Lines, although most were not. Only the proposed Wells Street subway and the Jackson Street subway in the Central Area, would have made possible the removal of the Loop and adjacent elevated structures.  Plan for expanding rapid transit service in the central area of Chicago (1962)  In April 1962, the Chicago Transit Authority proposed replacing the Union Loop Elevated with a downtown subway loop under La Salle Street, Randolph Street, Jackson Street and under the Grant Park parking lot. It was to be connected with major Loop buildings and fringe parking areas around the Central Area and included a rapid transit link to the McCormick Place Convention Center and the proposed rapid transit route in the median of the Dan Ryan Expressway.  Transit Planning Study, Chicago Central Area (1968)  These proposals and the growing demand for improved public transportation service in the Central Business District led to the Transit Planning Study Chicago Central Area, which began in 1965 and financed through interest-free funds advanced by the Communities Facilities Administration, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (USHUD). The study was conducted by the City of Chicago, the Chicago Transit Authority, and other public agencies to examine the rapid transit system in downtown Chicago, and develop a plan to maximize the contributions that effective public transportation could make toward the City's economic health. The main objectives were to produce a definitive plan to improve distribution of rapid transit and commuter railroad passengers in the Central Area, to permit removal of the \\"L\\" structures in the Loop, and to extend the rapid transit system to sectors of downtown Chicago not presently served ‚Äì thereby assuring that people working and visiting the Central Area could move about faster, easier, and in a more pleasant environment. Earlier proposals for transit facilities in the Chicago Central Area were reviewed, new plans were prepared and analyzed, and a recommended Central Area Transit Plan was developed. Loop area development potential was evaluated. Traffic projections were made. Consideration was given to architectural and environmental factors, operational requirements, and potential methods of financing the system. In April 1968 the study had culminated into an exhaustive three volume report recommending the construction of a fifteen-mile (24 km) subway system to replace the old elevated lines in downtown Chicago, naming it the Chicago Central Area Transit Project or CCATP. The system proposed as a result of the 1968 transit planning study consisted of two major transit facilities: # An east‚Äìwest, high-level \\"shuttle\\" or \\"distributor\\" subway extending from the University of Illinois at Chicago via Monroe Street to two branches serving, respectively, the intensely developing area north of Randolph Street and along and east of Michigan Avenue, and lakefront activities, including McCormick Place and developing areas to the southeast; and # A conventional subway following a loop pattern under Franklin, Randolph and Van Buren Streets and Wabash Avenue, crossing under the State and Dearborn Street subways. Improved subway connections to the Evanston‚ÄìRavenswood and Lake Street Elevated lines, and a connection to the Dan Ryan rapid transit route, and all-weather passageways within the Central Area were included. Implementation of the plan would permit removal of the Union Loop Elevated structures. Loop subway The \\"L\\" structures in downtown Chicago were to be replaced by subways under Franklin Street, Van Buren Street, Wabash Avenue, and Randolph Street. The proposed loop subway was to be linked to the Dan Ryan branch (then under construction at the time; now part of the Red Line) using the median strip of the proposed (but never built) Franklin Street Extension Expressway from the southwest corner of the Loop (Van Buren/Franklin) to Cermak-Chinatown. The Lake Street \\"L\\" (Green Line) was to be replaced from Damen Avenue to the northwest corner of the Loop (Franklin/Randolph) by a new subway under Randolph Street. The Northside \\"L\\" which carries Ravenswood (Brown Line) and Evanston Express (Purple Line) trains from Willow Street to the northwest corner of the Loop (Franklin/Randolph) would have been replaced by a new subway under Orleans Street to Division Street, and then northwest along Clybourn Avenue (adjacent to the State Street tubes) to the connection with the existing lines just south of Armitage. Train service in the new loop subway system were planned to offer the greatest potential in operational flexibility. CTA trains could have been operated on any number of routes, while through service was possible along the entire length of the Franklin Street subway, or to/from Lake Street via Randolph-Wabash-Van Buren. Lake-Dan Ryan (united to form the West-South Route between 1969 and 1993), Ravenswood, and Evanston Express CTA routes were planned to use the new subways. Had the system actually been built when it was proposed between 1969 and 1978, the Midway (Orange) Line would have also utilized the loop subway system through a connection with the Dan Ryan branch in the median of the Franklin Street Extension between Roosevelt Road and 16th Street by the time it began operation in October 1993. Stations planned for the loop subway system were to be located at North/Clybourn, Chicago/Orleans, Merchandise Mart, Roosevelt/Franklin, Ashland/Lake, and Canal/Randolph (directly linked to the present-day Ogilvie Transportation Center). The CBD stations under Randolph, Wabash, and Van Buren were to have continuous 28-foot center boarding platforms with station mezzanines either at each cross street or mid-block locations. The CBD stations under Franklin were designed to include double train tubes in a stacked arrangement with continuous side platforms from Jackson to Washington, with station mezzanines also at mid-block locations (Willis Tower was originally planned with basement-level access to the Franklin Street subway during its construction). Distributor subway The most novel part of the 1968 transit plan was the distributor subway system. It was to be routed from a terminal at Harrison and Morgan Streets at the University of Illinois at Chicago. From there, the line was to run north to Adams Street paralleling Morgan Street. At Adams Street the alignment was to turn east, meeting Monroe Street at Peoria Street. It would then follow Monroe Street, first under the Chicago River then across the Loop to a station just east of Michigan Avenue. East of Michigan Avenue the distributor would split ‚Äì with one branch extending north to Walton Place and the other south to the vicinity of McCormick Place. The latter branch was to consist of two tracks leaving the subway at Adams Street and occupy Illinois Central Railroad right- of-way at grade to the Stevenson Expressway. The double-track line to the north was to follow an alignment just east of Michigan Avenue under Stetson Street to the Chicago River serving the Prudential Building and the Illinois Center. North of the river, the line would turn north under Fairbanks Court to Chicago Avenue serving the Northwestern Memorial Hospital and the River East area of the Near North Side. Operating counterclockwise, a single track loop was to extend under De Witt Place, Walton Place, Rush Street, and Chicago Avenue to the point of beginning at Fairbanks Court. Stations planned for the distributor system were to be located at Harrison/Morgan-UIC, Halsted/Monroe, Clinton/Monroe, Franklin to Michigan (12-foot continuous side platforms with mezzanines at each cross street; 3 station stops were to be made at Wells/Monroe, Clark/Monroe, and Wabash/Monroe), Stetson/Randolph, Grand/Fairbanks, Erie/Fairbanks, Chestnut, Hancock, Rush, and Water Tower. The McCormick branch was to serve the Museums and Soldier Field (today's Museum Campus) and McCormick Place Convention Center. The Chicago Central Area Transit Plan called for subway construction to start in 1969, with the system opening in stages between 1973 and 1978. According to the 1968 report, the new loop and distributor subways should have carried more than 390,000 passengers on an average weekday, including 152,000 daily passengers using the distributor system. The total daily distributor subway travel by passengers who transferred to or from the commuter railroads (today's Metra and Amtrak) or other CTA rapid transit lines would have been twice these volumes. The Chicago Central Area Transit Plan's financial recommendations were, in retrospect, overly optimistic even for those days before the runaway inflation of the late 1960s and 1970s. The projected cost of building the loop and distributor subway systems was $478 million in 1969 dollars. In this and other financial projections, the CCATPS assumed an \\"escalation\\" of 5% per year, an unfortunate estimate of the unforeseeable 8‚Äì11% inflation rates of the next few years. The Chicago Urban Transportation District The Chicago Central Area Transit Project was formally adopted by the City of Chicago as part of the Comprehensive Plan of Chicago. In April 1970, the Chicago City Council passed a resolution authorizing the creation and implementation of the Chicago Urban Transportation District (CUTD). It also defined the boundaries of the District, a area encompassing downtown Chicago ‚Äì bounded on the north by North Avenue, on the west by Ashland Avenue, on the south by the Stevenson Expressway, and on the east by Lake Michigan. In June, the CUTD was approved by public referendum with the power to levy taxes to provide the local share of funds for the Chicago Central Area Transit Project, which might have been the seed money for massive Federal assistance, at last, to bury the venerable Union Loop. In July, it was established by Illinois Statute as a separate municipal corporation with taxing powers. The CUTD was formed for the sole purpose of carrying out the recommendations of the 1968 Central Area Transit Plan. In January 1971, CUTD applied for a $500.4 million grant from the Urban Mass Transportation Administration (UMTA), now the Federal Transit Administration (FTA), to build the loop and distributor subways. With the Central Area Transit Plan now in place, the stage was now set for further frustrations and a series of controversial set backs. Subway plan on hold In the early 1970s, while final planning was underway for a start on the new downtown subways, controversy began swirling in the District over the validity of the project and its cost. The 1968 Transit Plan was thought to be \\"mode restricted\\" and did not consider alternatives to the steel wheel-on- steel rail mode of rail rapid transit. Rail supporters argued that the \\"L\\" system was too extensive to replace with completely new equipment and vehicles, and that passenger volume on the core rail routes exceeded those which could be most efficiently carried by buses. In 1971, the CCATP was reviewed by local consultants to verify the assumptions and results of the 1968 transit planning study, based on new data then available. The 1968 study was determined to be reasonable, in terms of mode, service pattern, route alignments and station location. The 1971 report also looked beyond the recommended subway plan to possible extensions of the distributor system, and various operating options within the Loop system. It also explored the relationship of the CCATP with downtown parking facilities and the pedestrian passageway system, existing and planned for the Central Business District. The result of this report was a reaffirmation of the 1968 Chicago Central Area Transit Plan. In 1973, the CUTD retained another consultant, American-Bechtel, Inc., to further review and refine the CCATP, reevaluate the determination of system technology to be used in implementing the project, and conduct the necessary Environmental Impact Analysis of the resulting Transit Plan. This review and refinement was based upon the City of Chicago's community goals and objectives, as expressed in the Comprehensive Plan of Chicago. From this report was other alternative concepts of the plan, put forth by various groups since 1968. Four of these alternatives were selected for further analysis based on the evaluation of alternatives performed for the CUTD by American- Bechtel, which included: * Alternative 1 ‚Äì No-build ‚Äì leave the system as it is. * Alternative 4 ‚Äì Replace Loop \\"L\\" with east‚Äìwest distributor (Monroe Line) and north‚Äìsouth (Franklin Line) subways. * Alternative 6 ‚Äì Replace Loop \\"L\\" with 1968 recommended loop and distributor subways. * Alternative 12 ‚Äì Replace Loop \\"L\\" with new elevated structures and distributor subway (Clinton‚ÄìMonroe‚ÄìLake Front). Core Plan The CUTD remained dormant from 1971 to 1973, and the CCATP was put on hold pending finalization of legality tests and approval of its application for a Technical Studies Grant. Much of the District's resources had been transferred to other programs, including exhaustive and time-consuming validation and alternative analysis reports for the project. In June 1973, the CUTD commenced the first phase of the project, which included design criteria, specifications and general plans for the distributor subway, which was completed in 1974. Federal, state and local funds totaling $8.7 million were used for that eighteen-month effort. Similar predesign work was begun on the Franklin Line portion of the loop subway system, which in turn was completed in 1975. During this time, the CUTD and the City recommended the realignment of the Evanston‚ÄìRavenswood portion of the loop subway system proposed in 1968 for Orleans Street to an alignment under Kingsbury Street and Larrabee Street from the Chicago River to Clybourn Avenue. This alignment was adopted in 1974. Also, the western terminal for the Monroe Street distributor was rerouted in Desplaines Street from Monroe Street to the Eisenhower Expressway, and then through the existing north portals (which were built in the 1950s) near Halsted Street from whence the Blue Line emerges. Today, those portals remain unused. Following a public hearing in 1974, the CUTD submitted an Environmental Impact Analysis to the Federal government, and a revised application for a facilities grant for the Chicago Central Area Transit Project. The facilities grant application proposed a ten- year project that would cost $1.642 billion based on an annual escalation of 8% compounded to the mid-year of construction of each segment of the project. The application supported a system alignment made up of the five transit lines; that was used as the basis for the CUTD's presentation at the public hearing. The transit lines selected ‚Äì generally those recommended in the 1968 Transit Planning Study ‚Äì were Franklin, Randolph, Wabash-Van Buren, Monroe, Lakefront North and Lakefront South. Each of the transit lines were examined to determine which segments would provide the earliest return on investment in terms of service to greatest need, and permit early integration into the existing CTA system. The intention was to develop a sequential construction plan that would minimize disruption to urban transportation and stay within available funding. In the summer of 1974, the CUTD selected a Core Plan, the initial portion of the Chicago Central Area Transit Project to be built. It consisted essentially of the Monroe Line, the Franklin Line, and a portion of the Randolph Line. The Core Plan, which would take about six years to complete and cost $1 billion based on an August 1973 cost estimate, was submitted to the Federal government on August 21, 1974. The Core Plan was received well, however, it was recommended that the project be reduced to $700 million. Modifications to the original Core Plan were made and the revised Plan was presented to UMTA in September 1974. Subsequently, it was determined locally that certain options originally eliminated due to funding restraints placed on the project be reinstated. UMTA withdrew the cost ceiling, the adjustments were made after extensive interagency studies and conferences and the revised Core Plan was submitted to UMTA in August 1975. It was estimated to cost $1.43 billion and would take six years to design and build. None of the above actions have changed the Balance of the Project, which consisted of the portion of the Monroe Line to the University of Illinois at Chicago, the Lakefront Line (North and South), and the remaining portion of the Randolph, Wabash and Van Buren Lines. No work was ever started on those elements because they were determined to be subject to more changeable circumstances and potential modification and, therefore, responsive to further study of demand and benefit as part of the continuing planning process. Concurrent with development of the Core Plan, the CUTD had completed the predesign work needed for the Monroe Line in 1974 and performed similar work on the Franklin Line, which was completed in January 1976. Since September 1974, the CUTD was ready to begin final design and construction on the distributor subway (Monroe Line), but implementation was further delayed. End of the Loop? Additional funding constraints were placed upon the Chicago Central Area Transit Project, and the project was scaled down to more modest levels to meet the funding limits. Initially, the Core Plan, consisting essentially of the Franklin and Monroe Lines on specific alignments determined after extensive interagency studies and conferences in 1975 and 1976, was to be built first. Together, the lines of the Core Plan, when constructed, would permit better balanced operations in downtown Chicago and elimination of the Loop \\"L\\" structure. On June 9, 1976, after meeting with the Mayor of Chicago and representatives of all interested City and Regional agencies, a decision was made to separate the CCATP Core Plan into its two main components, the Franklin Line and Monroe Line, in a new implementation plan that introduced certain revisions to reduce the cost of each increment, and build one of them immediately. While each increment was desirable and viable in itself, and there was no particular cost advantage to either route, overriding and operational factors led to the conclusion that the Franklin Street subway was to be the first increment of the Chicago Central Area Transit Project to be constructed, and the CUTD had adopted that course. The Franklin Line (CUTD 1978) The Franklin Line, which was estimated to cost $496 million in 1977, was to extend nearly five miles from approximately Willow Street on the north (Evanston-Ravenswood Lines) to Cermak Road on the south (Englewood-Jackson Park Lines). From north to south, the Line was to follow Clybourn Avenue (parallel to the Red Line subway) to Larrabee Street then follow Larrabee and Kingsbury Streets through a station between the Merchandise Mart and the Apparel Center under Orleans Street. It would cross the Chicago River diagonally then curve under Franklin Street in the Central Business District in a stacked arrangement with stations and two continuous platforms (similar to the Red and Blue Line subways). South of the Loop, the line was to follow an alignment along the proposed Franklin Street Connector through a median strip station at Roosevelt Road and then continue south in subway running diagonally to the South Side \\"L\\" at 18th and State Streets and its connection near Cermak Road. There was also to be a connection between the Dan Ryan line and the portion of the Franklin Line in the median of the Franklin Street Connector between 15th Street and Cermak- Chinatown station. Five stations were proposed along the 4.65 mile subway route at North/Clybourn, Chicago/Larrabee, Merchandise Mart, Washington/Franklin, Monroe/Franklin, Jackson/Franklin, and Roosevelt/Franklin. A sixth station was planned at Division/Larrabee to provide transit access to Goose Island and the former Cabrini Green Housing project as well as other developments planned in the vicinity. According to the 1978 Draft Environmental Impact Statement (UMTA), construction of the Franklin Line was anticipated to begin in January 1979 and scheduled for completion in December 1983, however, an unexpected delay pushed the construction start time back one year to January 1980, with an estimated opening of the new subway in early 1985 (Chicago-Franklin Line FEIS, UMTA, 1979). The new subway was designed to offer dual-flexibility in routing rail transit service along the western (Franklin Street) and eastern (State Street) edges of the Loop. It would have created a second CTA North-South through operation ‚Äî Ravenswood-Englewood/Jackson Park service ‚Äî with Evanston Express service also routed into the new Franklin Line to a turn-back facility south of the planned Roosevelt/Franklin station. Howard-Dan Ryan (Red Line) service could have been started as early as 1984 or 1985, in lieu of CTA's February 21, 1993 rail system reroute. Lake Street \\"L\\" service was to continue operating over the remaining portion of the Union Loop \\"L\\" until some time later when financial arrangements permitted construction of the Monroe distributor subway, or at least until the Midway Line was built in 1993. The balance of the project (or the unbuilt segments of the CCATP) would be constructed further into the unforeseeable future. 1977 Chicago Loop derailment The overall effort to get started on the project acquired a sudden and shocking urgency brought about by one of the most extraordinary accidents in the history of Chicago's rapid transit system, the 1977 Chicago Loop derailment. Shortly after 5:00 p.m. on Friday, February 4, 1977, a Forest Park-bound Lake-Dan Ryan train departed from the Randolph/Wabash station and pulled into the tight, curve and Lake Street and Wabash Avenue and slammed head-on into the rear of a Ravenswood train at a standstill just beyond the turn. The four lead cars of the eight-car train derailed, two of them plunged into the street below. Eleven passengers were killed and 183 were injured. As CTA and City of Chicago crews worked diligently to clear the wreckage, one horribly tense moment was broadcast live on Chicago television. Cranes grappled with and lifted one car that had landed on its side in the street while viewers were held in suspense until word came that no pedestrians were caught beneath the 50,000 pound vehicle. \\"L\\" service was restored the next day. There was intense discussion about replacement subways for the Loop \\"L\\" for several days immediately following the disaster, which was the only major accident on the Loop in its history. Even as CUTD staff commenced selecting engineers and contractors for the Franklin Line subway, a murmur of opposition began to be heard in Chicago, voices that questioned the wisdom of replacing the Union Loop \\"L\\". These doubters were in no way against mass transportation ‚Äì rather they felt that the existing \\"L\\" structure, with improvement, could be useful for years to come. Then, there are the romantics who liken Chicago's downtown elevated line to what is left of the San Francisco cable-car network. Another group, namely the Chicago Chapter of the American Institute of Architects, went even further by trying to equate the elevated structure as one with the Eiffel Tower in Paris. They claimed it would have been a complete, final catastrophe to tear down so glorious an example from the years when man first began to use structural steel to remake the face of the Earth. Some criticized the Chicago Central Area Transit Plan to build new downtown subways to replace the Union Loop \\"L\\" as just one more instance of backroom political deals being made at the expense of taxpayers and daily transit riders. Chicago Central Area Transit Project cancelled In 1979, Chicago mayor Jane M. Byrne and Illinois governor James R. Thompson reached an agreement whereby the Franklin Street subway project, along with the Crosstown Expressway on the West Side, was to be cancelled, the Union Loop Elevated (which by then had been placed on the National Register for Historic Places) retained and improved upon, and rapid transit developments for residential sections of Chicago where improvements were needed. All of the federal grants earmarked for both projects, which had amounted to just over $2 billion, was diverted to fund other transportation programs. From these programs came various highway infrastructure projects, plus the O'Hare Extension of the Kennedy Line in 1984, the Howard-Dan Ryan subway link in 1993, and the Midway Line on the Southwest Side, also in 1993. Those funds have since been exhausted. The Chicago Urban Transportation District, which had suffered from a lack of support and funding, was abolished by state legislation in 1984, and the remaining $12 million it had was transferred to the CTA. Central Area Circulator A few years after the demise of the Chicago Central Area Transit Project (CCATP), the city was working on plans for new and less expensive transit alternatives for downtown Chicago. The central area had grown well beyond the expectations of the 1968 Transit Planning Study in terms of building development and employment growth. There were still concerns among Chicago's civic leaders that this growth would seriously outpace Chicago's mass transportation systems which had become insubstantial. By the 1980s and 1990s, replacement subways were deemed too expensive and extensions to the existing CTA heavy rail transit system were considered too limited in their benefits. Additional or expanded bus service on overcrowded and badly congested streets was considered impractical. The Central Area Circulator Project, coordinated by the Metropolitan Planning Council, opted for a light rail plan to enhance connectivity to a larger area of downtown by commuter railroad and rapid transit systems. The proposed system was dubbed the \\"Central Area Circulator\\", an eight-mile (13 km) light-rail transit network linking the North Western, Union and Randolph Metra suburban railroad stations to North Michigan Avenue, Streeterville, Navy Pier, the museums, and McCormick Place. The system was to include east‚Äìwest routes north and south of the Chicago River as well as north‚Äìsouth links on portions of Michigan Avenue and Columbus Drive. Construction was scheduled to begin after a preliminary engineering phase of the Project in 1993, with operations expected to begin by 1998. The Circulator Project was estimated at $689.4 million when it too was cancelled in 1995 after Illinois Governor Jim Edgar failed to appropriate money for it. Livability grant An aspect of a downtown circulator plan was revived when the United States Department of Transportation announced a Livability Program, Urban Circulator Grant to the Chicago Department of Transportation for the \\"Chicago Central Transitway,\\" a project to establish designated bus priority lanes, bus signal priority, \\"next bus\\" information, and bus shelter branding on Madison, Washington, Canal, and Clinton Streets. The city noted that the \\"project would meet the goals of the Chicago Central Area Action Plan by promoting transit, bicycle use and walking, thereby making the Central Area even more of an attractive place to do business, visit and live.\\". The project is known as \\"Loop Link\\" and broke ground in 2015. It was formerly called Central Loop BRT, because it contains some elements of bus rapid transit (BRT) systems like dedicated bus lanes, stations shared by several routes, level boarding, and traffic signal priority. Monroe distributor subway While no additional heavy rail rapid transit subways are planned for Chicago's Central Area because they are still deemed too high in construction costs and limited in their service potential, an east‚Äìwest, cross-the-Loop rail system to link the Near West Side, Loop, and Near North Side communities, as well as Chicago's Union Station, Ogilvie Transportation Center, and Millennium Station (Metra Electric & South Shore Lines) is very possible. When the Chicago Central Area Transit Project was shelved in 1979, only the Loop replacement portion of the project (The Franklin Line) was deferred. However, the Monroe Street distributor subway was never \\"officially\\" cancelled; it remains to this day an active, viable program. Even with the Loop Link BRT in place and no available funding for such an endeavor ($478 million in 1969; around $3.3 billion today) seems likely, the Monroe Street distributor subway (Harrison/Morgan to Walton Place) could provide a more direct link serving the downtown Metra, Amtrak, and NICTD terminal stations (except LaSalle Street Station), and connect with all CTA rapid transit lines on the Loop Elevated, State, and Dearborn subways. It could also provide better rail transportation to the University of Illinois at Chicago, Greektown, Millennium Park, Northwestern Memorial Hospital, Navy Pier, and the North Michigan Avenue business district, as it was originally planned to do.

She departed Boston on 3 January 1799 for the Windward Islands to protect American merchantmen in the Caribbean during the naval war with France. She arrived Prince Rupert Bay on the 20th, and, for the next two years, cruised in the West Indies and escorted convoys to the United States.

She took French letter-of-marque schooner Bonaparte 7 August and, with and , recaptured American schooner John on the 15th, after that ship had struck her colors to French privateer Revelleiu the day before. Merrimack freed American brig Ceres, 6 June 1800, after it had been taken by L'Hazard on 18 May 1800. On arriving off Cura√ßao, 22 September, she found that a French force of 16 ships from Guadeloupe was besieging the city with 1,400 men. That evening, with , Merrimack stood into the harbor through heavy fire from French cannon and muskets. The American gunners replied with great spirit driving the enemy troops from their guns, but from time to time, during the night, the French soldiers renewed the cannonade. The next morning, the French troops reembarked in confusion and fled. Merrimack captured French privateer sloop Phoenix on 20 October 1800, and later in the year took French brig Brilliant. A list of American prizes credits Merrimack with recapturing British schooner Godfrey, but gives no details about the action. She was stripped of naval equipment and sold in 1801. Subsequently, while operating in merchant service under the name Monticello, the ship was lost off Cape Cod, Massachusetts.

She was renamed Merrimack on 9 January 1942, and commissioned 4 February 1942, Captain William E. Hilbert in command. Service history Assigned to the Atlantic Fleet, the new fleet oiler spent the next two-and-a-half years steaming the Atlantic seaways carrying oil for Allied ships from Argentia, Newfoundland to Montevideo, Uruguay, and from ports along the United States East Coast to staging areas in the British Isles and the Mediterranean. Her primary duty was fueling the escorts which protected Allied convoys from German U-boats. Merrimacks most memorable crossing began on 23 October 1942 from Hampton Roads, Virginia, when she sailed with the Southern Attack Group of the Western Naval Task Force for Operation Torch, the invasion of North Africa. Twice during the passage she refueled the ships of the task force. A heavy storm broke on 4 November 1942 threatening the landings, but Admiral H. Kent Hewitt kept to the original plan. The task forces mission was to capture the harbor at Safi, Morocco, to cut off French forces in southern Morocco, and to enable the landing of Major General George S. Pattons tanks for operations against Casablanca. For more than a year and a half after the landings in Morocco, Merrimack carried oil to support operations in North Africa, Sicily, Italy, and France. On her transatlantic voyages, besides oil, she carried passengers and a wide variety of equipment including PT boats, patrol craft, and aircraft. While steaming toward Casablanca on 22 June 1943, she joined the minesweeper in rescuing 113 survivors from Lot, a French oiler that had been torpedoed. Merrimack departed Norfolk, Virginia, on 14 October 1944 for the Panama Canal and Ulithi in the Pacific, arriving on 1 December 1944. Allied forces were retaking the Philippine Islands and preparing for operations even closer to the Japanese Home Islands. Merrimack joined the United States Third Fleet's At-Sea Logistics Support Group to fuel the fast carrier task force. She began the new year of 1945 supporting raids on Formosa on 3 and 4 January 1945. The U.S. carriers struck enemy airbases on Luzon, Philippines, on 6 and 7 January to help neutralize Japanese resistance to the invasion of that strategic island which began on the beaches of Lingayen Gulf on 9 January 1945. Naval aircraft which she supported returned to Formosa on the 15th and hit targets along the China coast the following day. They again lashed out at Formosa on the 21st. From 16 February through 2 March, Merrimack supported the ships covering the landings on Iwo Jima. During the fight for Okinawa, Merrimack alternated between fueling ships involved directly in the landings and the aircraft carriers during raids to on the Japanese Home Islands. After Okinawa was secured, the Third Fleet concentrated on operations against Japan itself. From 10 through 29 July 1945, Merrimack supported raids of overwhelming force on Japanese targets which hastened the end of the war. Following Japan's capitulation on 15 August 1945, Merrimack made several cruises between the United States West Coast and East Asia bringing oil for ships supporting the occupation of Japan and operating along the coasts of China and Korea. She was assigned to Military Sea Transportation Service (MSTS) in October 1949, shortly before beginning pre-inactivation overhaul. Merrimack was decommissioned on 8 February 1950 and entered the Atlantic Reserve Fleet at Orange, Texas. After the Korean War began on 25 June 1950 when North Korean forces invaded South Korea, Merrimack was recommissioned on 6 December 1950. Assigned to MSTS, she served the Atlantic Fleet, making periodic deployments to the Mediterranean until she was decommissioned again on 20 December 1954, and entered the Pacific Reserve Fleet at San Diego, California. She was stricken from the Navy List on 4 February 1959, transferred to the Maritime Administration (MARAD), and placed in the National Defense Reserve Fleet at Beaumont, Texas. Merrimack was disposed of by MARAD exchange on 19 March 1982. She was sold to Eckhardt & Company GmbH, Hamburg, West Germany, for scrapping, and delivered on 29 March 1982 at Beaumont. Honors and awards Merrimack received eight battle stars for World War II service.

Launched in October 1962, the C-V8 series had fibreglass bodywork with aluminium door skins, as did the preceding 541 series. All C-V8s used big-block engines sourced from Chrysler; first the 361 and then, from 1964, the 383 in¬≥. Most of the cars had three-speed Chrysler Torqueflite automatic transmission, but seven Mk2 C-V8s were produced with the 6-litre engine and four-speed manual gearbox, followed by two manual Mk3s. The engine is entirely setback behind the front axle line which made the C-V8 one of the first front- mid-engined cars. While the great majority of C-V8s were made in right-hand drive (RHD), ten were made in left-hand drive (LHD). The car was one of the fastest production four-seaters of its era. The Mk II, capable of , ran a quarter-mile (~400 m) in 14.6 seconds, and accelerated from 0‚Äì in 6.7 seconds.THE AUTOCAR 16 April 1965 It was also one of the quickest cars to 60 mph in the world being significantly faster than such performance cars of the period as the Lamborghini Miura, Aston Martin DB5 and Jaguar E Type. The upgraded Mk II, introduced in October 1963, had Armstrong Selectaride electronically adjustable rear dampers and minor styling changes. Changes on the Mk III, the final version of the series which was introduced in June 1965, included a minor reduction in overall length, deeper windscreen, equal size headlamps without chrome bezels, improved interior ventilation, wood-veneer dashboard, the addition of overriders to the bumpers, and a dual-circuit braking system. Car no 104/2308, the blue car illustrated in this article is a mildly modified Mark Two which left the factory in May, 1965. The factory made two convertibles: a cabriolet, and a Sedanca that opened only above the front seats. The 1963 Sedanca was featured in an article by Paul Walton in the June 2008 issue of Ruoteclassiche, Italy's leading classic car magazine. The front of the C-V8 was styled with covered headlamps, similar to those on the Ferrari 275 GTB and Jaguar 3.8 E-type as a key element of the design. But because of concerns that they might reduce the effectiveness of the headlamps, the covers were deleted for the production cars. As a consequence the C-V8's front-end appearance was compromised and proved controversial for decades. Owners are now starting to return their cars to the original streamlined styling intended by the car's designer Eric Neale. The model was discontinued in 1966 after a total production run of 500. The fibreglass body, and the fact that the twin- tube frame was set in from the perimeter of the car, have contributed to the model's comparatively high survival rate. The C-V8 was little used in motor sports although a factory Jensen used the services of a team of racing drivers, including Roy Salvadori to take the Commanders Cup 4-hour endurance events at Snetterton race course in MKIII C-V8 in 1965. More recently a Jensen C-V8 has been one of the most awarded cars in Tarmac Classic Rallying, with over 120 trophies including multiple wins and podiums in Targa Tasmania, Classic Adelaide and Targa High Country (Outright and Handicap) and several championship series wins. One prototype C-V8 FF was fitted with four-wheel drive and an anti-lock braking system. It was used for development of the Jensen FF which was the first non-all-terrain production car equipped with four-wheel drive A C-V8 Mk II was featured in the 1965 to 1966 ITC television series The Baron. Famous owners of Jensen C-V8s include actor Sean Connery of James Bond fame who owned a MKII Reg AUW 70B, the pop star Susan Maughan, the guitarist Dave Hill from the glam-rock band Slade whose car carried the registration YOB 1 and Sir Greg Knight MP, the Chair of the All Party Parliamentary Historic Vehicles Group. A CV-8 was featured in the 2015 BBC television series London Spy driven by the character Scottie. One was also featured in series 4 episode 5 of Minder. It was driven by Jimmy Nail and hsd registration number 324 PE. In 2015 a Jensen CV-8 Mk II started to be modified with the aim of becoming the first Jensen to set a speed record on Speed Week 2018. The Sedanca was also featured in Classics Monthly magazine, issue 146, February 2009. In 1964 a Jensen C-V8 towed a 400, Alpine and Musketeer Caravan at over 100 mph at Duxford Aerodrome.

It is the opposite side of the river from Port Meadow and about southwest of the ruins of Godstow Abbey. History Binsey's most noted feature is the parish church of St Margaret, set at some distance north of the surviving houses. It dates from the 12th century and is a Grade I Listed Building.http://osneybenefice.org.uk/node/4/ Its fame lies mostly in that just outside its west end and belltower stands St Margaret‚Äôs Well, a Grade II Listed Building, which is the model for Lewis Carroll‚Äôs ‚ÄòTreacle Well‚Äô from Alice's Adventures in Wonderland; this is a holy well dedicated to St Frideswide, patron saint of Oxford. According to legend, she fled to Binsey in a bid to escape marriage to a king of Mercia, whose pursuit of her was halted when he was struck blind at the gates of Oxford. Frideswide‚Äôs prayers brought forth a healing spring, whose waters cured his blindness, and the spring was walled into a shallow well which became a focus for pilgrimage, the mediaeval sense of the word ‚Äòtreacle‚Äô meaning ‚Äòhealing unguent‚Äô. The well became a pilgrimage site in mediaeval times.At least one pilgrimage still takes place annually: in 2018 the pilgrimage is on Thursday 19 July (the Eve of the Feast of St Margaret) (https://www.osneybenefice.org.uk/events/updated-pilgrimage- holy-well-and-church-st-margaret-antioch). \\"Binsey beats off new homes bid\\", Oxford Times, (3 October 2001) The reason for the apparent separation of church and village is revealed best from the air; cropmarks show the floor- plans of houses that lay along the straight road that runs between them, suggesting a much larger village during the mediaeval period, or possibly one that has ‚Äòmigrated‚Äô south. The village and its associated farmland belonged to St Frideswide's Priory during the 14th and 15th centuries, until the priory's dissolution and (apparently) incorporation into Christ Church, a college of Oxford University, which now owns all of the buildings in Binsey, save one.\\"U-turn over pub pleases villagers\\", Oxford Times (10 October 2002) Plans in 2001 by Christ Church to double the size of the village by demolishing a barn and constructing seven new residences were met with worldwide protests, leading to withdrawal of the proposal. Binsey features a total of nine listed buildings. As well as St Margaret‚Äôs Church and St Margaret‚Äôs Well, Binsey has seven other listed buildings: * Medley Manor Farmhouse * Manor Farm Cottage * Manor Farm House * The Limes (known locally as ‚ÄòGreat Leys‚Äô) * Barn at Manor Farm * The Thatched Cottage *Perch InnThe Perch The Perch Inn An avenue of poplars in Binsey was made famous by Gerard Manley Hopkins in his poem ‚ÄòBinsey Poplars‚Äô, written when he found the riverside trees felled.

Its remit was subsequently extended to include roads in Scotland and Northern Ireland. DMRB is managed by the Highways England on behalf of the agencies responsible for trunk roads in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, however the requirements given may be subject to regional variations. In 1992 it was published as loose leaf set of documents in lever arch files. In 2002 the DMRB was made freely available on the internet at http://www.standardsforhighways.co.uk. Paper copies in the lever arch folders continued to be available to purchase as well as copies available on compact discs. 2015 review In 2015 as part of the Protocol attached to the licence for Highways England Ltd to be the Strategic Highways Company, there was a requirement to review the structure, usability and content of the DMRB by March 2020. Highways England appointed WSP to assist with thought leadership on what these changes should be. Between April 2015 and March 2016 a wide ranging stakeholder consultation and developed a number of recommendations. The first of the new format documents were published in June 2018.

Much of its history has centered on Flin Flon, Manitoba, where it has mined for over 90 years. Hudbay currently has operations in Manitoba, Peru, Chile and the United States, and is working towards building a copper mine in southern Arizona. History=Hudson Bay Mining and Smelting Co. The Flin Flon orebody was discovered by David Collins, a local trapper, and shown to prospector Tom Creighton in 1914. The first claim was registered in 1915. It took more than a dozen years to bring the mine into production because the huge, high grade ore body required large amounts of hydro energy, was isolated, and copper production required a smelter. In 1927, Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney (a member of the Whitney family of New York), along with Newmont Mining Corp and Mining Corp of Canada Ltd., founded Hudson Bay Mining & Smelting (HBM&S;), which took over controlling interest in the Flin Flon property. By 1930, the mine, smelter, hydroelectric dam and railroad were in full operation. Eight years later, the company was listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol HBM About Us: https://hudbayminerals.com/about-us/history/default.aspx. In 1958, Hudbay opened its first mine in Snow Lake, 215 kilometres east of Flin Flon. Six years later, production began at Stall Lake minehttp://www.snowlake.com/p/mining-history. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Hudbay continued to mine and explore in and around Flin Flon and Snow Lake, discovering new deposits, such as Trout Lake and Chisel North, and starting production at new mines, like Anderson Lake. After more than 60 years in operation, in 1992, Hudbay closed its original Flin Flon mine; however, one year later, as a result of underground exploration, Hudbay discovered a substantial orebody that would become its flagship 777 mine in Flin Flon https://hudbayminerals.com/about-us/history/default.aspx. Hudbay Minerals Inc. On December 21, 2004, OntZinc Corporation acquired HBM&S; for C$316 million from Anglo American plc. The purchase was financed by a public offering of C$143.8 million of equity and the issue of US$175 million of debt.Hudbay Minerals Inc. 2004 Annual Report The company then changed its name to Hudbay Minerals Inc. Hudbay was also listed on the TSX under the symbol HBM In 2007, Hudbay located a significant zinc deposit near Snow Lake that became known as Lalor. The deposit also contained a large volume of gold, large enough to support its own mine. Initial production began in 2012 and the mine officially opened in September 2014. In March 2011, Hudbay acquired Norsemont Mining Inc. and its Constancia copper mine in Peru for $520 million. Construction on the mine began in August 2012 and commercial production commenced in April 2015. Pan American Resources Inc. Founded as Pan American Resources Inc., the company first went public on the Montreal Exchange under the symbol PAN in the 3rd quarter of 1996.Pan American Resources Inc. 1996 Annual Report Pan American acquired all of OntZinc Corporation on March 12, 2002. Subsequently, the company renamed itself OntZinc Corporation on August 15, 2002.OntZinc Corporation SCHEDULE \\"C\\" filing December 20, 2002 Upon acquisition of HBMS, the company renamed itself Hudbay Minerals Inc. on December 24, 2004.Ontzinc Corporation December 23, 2004 News Release On August 26, 2008, Hudbay Minerals announced the completion of a business combination with Skye Resources Inc. Skye Resources was renamed HMI Nickel, and was a subsidiary of Hudbay Minerals until Hudbay divested of the project through the sale of its interest in CGN to the Solway Group in September 2011. In November 2008, Hudbay Minerals and Lundin Mining announced an agreement to merge. However, in February 2009, after a ruling by the Ontario Securities Commission that Hudbay must allow its shareholders to vote on the plan, the companies announced that the deal had been terminated after realizing it was unlikely to win shareholder support. On January 9, 2009, Hudbay Minerals suspended operations (and continue on care and maintenance) at Chisel North Mine in Snow Lake, Manitoba. The mine stopped producing in late February 2009, due to falling zinc metal prices and increased costs, and restarted operations in 2010. Operations Directly, and through its subsidiaries, Hudbay owns three polymetallic mines, four ore concentrators and a zinc production facility in northern Manitoba and Saskatchewan (Canada) and Cusco (Peru), and copper projects in Arizona and Nevada (United States). Hudbay currently operates two underground mines in the province of Manitoba. The 777 Mine is located in Flin Flon, and the Lalor Mine is located near Snow Lake. The 777 mine in Flin Flon produces zinc and copper along with lesser amounts of gold and silver, while the Lalor Mine produces gold, zinc and copper. In Peru, Hudbay operates the Constancia mine, an open pit mine that achieved commercial production in 2015. The mine produces copper and molybdenum concentrates. Hudbay also owns Pampacancha, a high-grade satellite copper deposit located only four kilometres from the Constancia mine. In Q1 2017, Hudbay produced 34,731 tonnes of copper, 20,723 ounces of gold and 30,570 tonnes of zinc. The company reported a quarterly loss per share of $0.01, impacted by lower sales volumes and by poor overall performance in all aspects of mining. Controversy surrounding HudBay's former Guatemalan operations  The Fenix ferro-nickel project in Guatemala is owned by Compa√±√≠a Guatemalteca de Niquel (CGN), which was 98.2% owned by HudBay Minerals from August 2008 to September 2011. The Fenix Project in eastern Guatemala is a substantial brownfield nickel laterite mine and process plant that has been on care and maintenance since 1980. HudBay Minerals and two of its subsidiaries are subject to an ongoing $12 million lawsuit in Canada over the killing of a prominent Mayan community leader at the Fenix Mining Project. The lawsuit alleges that on September 27, 2009, security personnel employed at the Fenix mine surrounded, beat and hacked at Adolfo Ich Cham√°n with machetes before shooting him in the head at close range in an unprovoked attack.http://www.chocversushudbay.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Fresh-As- Amended-Statement-of-Claim-filed.pdf An arrest warrant was issued for the Head of Security at the Fenix mine, Mynor Ronaldo Padilla Gonz√°les.Mining Weekly Guatemalan widow's lawsuit against HudBay could be precedent setting A non- governmental organization has referred to the murder as the \\"targeted killing of a well-known community leader.\\" Amnesty International has stated with respect to the murder allegation \\"[t]he allegations are very serious, and Amnesty International calls for a swift, full and impartial investigation into the death of Adolfo Ich Cham√°n and other incidents of violence, to make the results public and to bring those responsible to justice\\". HudBay states that it and CGN have cooperated fully with all investigations conducted by Guatemalan authorities in connection with the incidents which occurred on September 27, 2009, in El Estor.

A jury notice was filed in December 2013. As of February 2018, the court action was ongoing. The Fenix mining project is also subject to ongoing land claims by local Mayan communities. In 2006, the International Labour Organization, an agency of the United Nations, ruled that Guatemala had breached international law by granting the Fenix mining concession without first consulting with local Mayan people. The ILO released a report discussing the violation in 2007. In late 2006 and early 2007, Skye Resources (acquired by HudBay Minerals in 2008, renamed HMI Nickel and subsequently sold by HudBay in 2011) sought forced evictions of Mayan communities located on contested mine land. Homes were burned to the ground during these evictions. ReferencesExternal links * * Company Profile on SEDAR * Choc v. HudBay Minerals Inc. and Caal v.

SciTech High is a regional math and science magnet school that attracts students from Harrisburg and neighboring school districts and is affiliated with the Harrisburg University of Science and Technology. Beginning with the 9th grade, SciTech High prepares students for a university curriculum, studying toward degrees in science, engineering and technology. Enrollment is limited to 400 pupils The opportunity to create a unified 9-16 curriculum is unique in the nation and represents a potentially replicable approach to bridging the frequent discontinuity between high school and higher education. The school is a federally designated Title I school. In 2011, the Harrisburg City School District Board changed the name of the school to Harrisburg High School, SciTech Campus. In 2013, Harrisburg High School, SciTech Campus' enrollment was reported as 366 pupils in 9th through 12th grades, with 60% of pupils eligible for a free lunch due to family poverty. Additionally, 2.7% of pupils received special education services, while 1.9% of pupils were identified as gifted. The school employed 29 teachers.US News and World Report, Best High Schools, 2013 According to the Pennsylvania Department of Education 100% of the teachers were rated \\"Highly Qualified\\" under the federal No Child Left Behind Act.

The exams were administered in the Spring of each school year. The goal was for 100% of students to be on grade level or better in reading and mathematics, by the Spring of 2014. The tests focused on the state's Academic Standards for reading, writing, mathematics and science. The Science exam included content in science, technology, ecology and the environmental studies. The mathematics exam included: algebra I, algebra II, geometry and trigonometry. The standards were first published in 1998 and are mandated by the Pennsylvania State Board of Education. In 2013, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania changed its high school assessments to the Keystone Exams in Algebra 1, Reading/literature and Biology1. The exams are given at the end of the course, rather than all in the spring of the student's 11th grade year. =Reading achievement= ;11th grade Reading on grade level: * 2012 - 74% (4% below basic.

Students take advanced and engaging science related courses and earn college credit while completing high school graduation requirements. In the past, SciTech has allowed students to take classes at the nearby Harrisburg Area Community College campus as well as Harrisburg University. Funding for SciTech High comes from a variety of public/private sources. Since 2001, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has provided more than $124 million to support schools across the United States, including SciTech High. The school is a recipient of an Annenberg Foundation Pennsylvania High School Coaching Initiative grant. The initiative places one literacy and one math coach for every 600 students in 24 high-need high schools located in 15 school districts across Pennsylvania, with a total enrollment of over 32,000 students. The PAHSCI model is the nation‚Äôs only multi-tiered teacher coaching and mentoring initiative that provides trained teacher-leaders, called coaches, to schools and school districts; coaches and school/district administrators, in turn, receive professional and program support from the initiative‚Äôs team of mentors and facilitators. In 2008 the Board of Control approved a Memo Of Understanding between Harrisburg Area Community College and Sci-Tech High regarding the college in the High School Program/College in the Technical School Program. Students participate in a monthly Community Partnership Day.http://www.hbgsd.k12.pa.us//Domain/999 This day is used as an external teaching tool with each activity or group monitored by a staff member. Activities include speakers, volunteer events, and career development and exploration opportunities. This type of activity is unique to this high school in the area. Extracurricular activities The school has one of the few active robotics teams in Harrisburg. It is led by one of the school's first teachers, Robert Steps. The members of the robotics team greatly enjoy their time there. The program helps teach teamwork, ingenuity, and how to speak robot C, a code language designed for robots. The team joins in a tournament every year. Other current and former extracurricular activities include Math & Music Club, Student Council, Youth & Government, Brainbusters/Quiz Bowl, Choir, Key Club, International Club, and National Honor Society. Student athletes are eligible to compete for the Harrisburg High Cougars with students from the John Harris campus.

Socle of a group In the context of group theory, the socle of a group G, denoted soc(G), is the subgroup generated by the minimal normal subgroups of G. It can happen that a group has no minimal non-trivial normal subgroup (that is, every non-trivial normal subgroup properly contains another such subgroup) and in that case the socle is defined to be the subgroup generated by the identity. The socle is a direct product of minimal normal subgroups. As an example, consider the cyclic group Z12 with generator u, which has two minimal normal subgroups, one generated by u4 (which gives a normal subgroup with 3 elements) and the other by u6 (which gives a normal subgroup with 2 elements). Thus the socle of Z12 is the group generated by u4 and u6, which is just the group generated by u2. The socle is a characteristic subgroup, and hence a normal subgroup. It is not necessarily transitively normal, however. If a group G is a finite solvable group, then the socle can be expressed as a product of elementary abelian p-groups. Thus, in this case, it is just a product of copies of Z/pZ for various p, where the same p may occur multiple times in the product. Socle of a module In the context of module theory and ring theory the socle of a module M over a ring R is defined to be the sum of the minimal nonzero submodules of M. It can be considered as a dual notion to that of the radical of a module. In set notation, :\\\\mathrm {soc}(M) = \\\\sum { N \\\\mid N \\\\text{ is a simple submodule of }M }. Equivalently, :\\\\mathrm {soc}(M) = \\\\bigcap{ E \\\\mid E \\\\text{ is an essential submodule of }M }. The socle of a ring R can refer to one of two sets in the ring. Considering R as a right R module, soc(RR) is defined, and considering R as a left R module, soc(RR) is defined. Both of these socles are ring ideals, and it is known they are not necessarily equal. * If M is an Artinian module, soc(M) is itself an essential submodule of M. * A module is semisimple if and only if soc(M) = M. Rings for which soc(M) = M for all M are precisely semisimple rings. * soc(soc(M)) = soc(M). *M is a finitely cogenerated module if and only if soc(M) is finitely generated and soc(M) is an essential submodule of M. *Since the sum of semisimple modules is semisimple, the socle of a module could also be defined as the unique maximal semi-simple submodule. * From the definition of rad(R), it is easy to see that rad(R) annihilates soc(R). If R is a finite-dimensional unital algebra and M a finitely generated R-module then the socle consists precisely of the elements annihilated by the Jacobson radical of R.J. L. Alperin; Rowen B. Bell, Groups and Representations, 1995, , p. 136 Socle of a Lie algebra In the context of Lie algebras, a socle of a symmetric Lie algebra is the eigenspace of its structural automorphism that corresponds to the eigenvalue ‚àí1.

In 2012, they also appeared together on General Hospital. Todd was originated by Roger Howarth and later portrayed by actor Trevor St. John. On August 17, 2011, St. John's character was revealed to be Todd's identical twin brother, Victor Lord Jr., conditioned to believe he was Todd and assume Todd's identity. Blair has been portrayed by Kassie DePaiva since the couple's inception. The couple is often called \\"T&B;\\" or \\"TnB\\" (for Todd and Blair) by fans on Internet message boards. Their popularity led to a nomination at the Daytime Emmy Awards, cited as one of television's top couples. An often tempestuous but loving relationship, the two have been titled \\"hands down the most brilliantly complex couple on daytime\\". Writing Todd and Blair's creation as a couple is described as factoring in several aspects of their own personalities, as well as their individual life experiences. In an interview, former One Life to Live head writer Michael Malone detailed the varying elements, what he set out to create, and how the couple eventually evolved: > Todd and Blair were a great deal alike, two bad apples, two lost souls: > conniving, deceitful, wounded and hiding the wounds for all they were worth > behind a smart and sexy facade.

Their connection is so deeply rooted. Less is more with them. They don't even need dialogue to speak. What they don't say speaks volumes.\\"Soap Opera Digest, 12/4/01 In a 2008 interview, actor Trevor St. John, then-portrayer of Todd, spoke of Todd and Blair's on- again/off-again relationship. \\"It's a never-ending cycle,\\" he said. \\"That's what people expect; they want Todd and Blair together, and the writers give them what they expect. It's not necessarily true that they'll do exactly what the fans want, but they do have an expectation, so the writers meet it.\\" St. John did express discontent with the back and forth nature of the couple, however. He noted wanting something different. \\"Like I said\\", he stated, \\"there is an endless recycling of breaking up with Blair and getting back together, breaking up with Blair, then getting back together.\\"  Storyline  When Todd first appears on the show, in December 1992, he is an arrogant, cruel fraternity brother who leads his gang of \\"brothers\\" to participate in the brutal rape of Marty Saybrooke at a party in May 1993. After being sentenced to prison for eight years, Todd develops a burning desire to seek revenge on the two women he holds responsible for his jail time, Nora Gannon (his attorney who threw the case when she discovered that Todd was guilty) and Marty. After escaping from prison, Todd causes more terror when he holds a knife to Nora, who is blind at the time, and threatens to rape her. Nora is able to escape the attack when Bo Buchanan arrives in time to save her, and Todd flees. In time, Todd's run from the law soon ends on the night of the annual Costume Ball at a place called Serenity Springs. Bo is able to corner Todd and Todd has no other choice but to surrender. In a bizarre twist of fate, Todd is given a pardon after saving the lives of Marty and Tina and Cord's son, C.J. and Viki‚Äôs daughter Jessica Buchanan. But Todd's trouble is only beginning. After becoming a free man once again, Todd faces his next obstacle: A string of rapes in Llanview become a thorn in his side, as all suspicions are pointing to him. After doing some detective work on his own, Todd is able to find out that the true culprit is his old fraternity brother, Powell Lord III. After a showdown with Powell, Todd finally has a sense of the pain he caused Marty and sincerely apologizes to her for the rape. The next shockwave to hit Todd is the sudden death of his father, Peter Manning. It is a bittersweet goodbye to the man who abused him as a child, but upon his death, Todd learns something even more startling. It is in his mother's old letters that he learns that he was adopted, and that there is also a large sum of money for him. Schemers David Vickers and Dorian Lord discover that Todd Manning is really an heir to none other than Victor Lord, and is worth an estimated $30 million. In 1994, Todd's love life takes an unexpected turn as well, after he meets up with the very conniving Blair Daimler, who later learns of his \\"hidden\\" Lord fortune. Blair first meets Todd at Rodi's Bar. She goes there to lose her problems in a couple of drinks, which is exactly the same reason Todd is there. They bond almost immediately, become friends, and before long, they are making love. Their intimacy with each other is \\"no strings attached\\". It is after Blair discovers the truth about Todd being the Lord heir that she sets her plan into motion of marrying him. Blair tells Todd she is pregnant with his child, which starts out as a lie, but to the amazement of Blair, is actually true. They marry in 1995 and she becomes pregnant on their wedding night. It is not long after their wedding that Todd finds out that he is Victor Lord's son, and is now worth 27.8 million dollars. Trouble hits Todd again when he finds out that Blair knew all along about his inheritance. Todd files for divorce from Blair, who had already lost the baby she had been carrying. Todd is unaware that Blair has become pregnant a second time, and is keeping it a secret from him. Ironically, during the course of their marriage, Blair has fallen for Todd after all. In fall 1995, Todd and Blair reconcile, and once again became man and wife, ready to start a real family with their unborn daughter. Unfortunately, their happiness is very short-lived, as tragedy is about to strike again. Wanting to set things right with the woman he raped, Todd takes a short trip to Ireland in order to track down Marty to tell her that the young girl she knows named Paloma is dying of AIDS. Todd helps Marty and her new friend, Patrick Thornhart, out of a jam. After being mistaken for Patrick, Todd is shot, stuffed into the trunk of a car, and driven off of a cliff. Meanwhile, back in Llanview, Blair hears the terrible news that her husband is dead. In her grief, Blair blames Marty, accusing her of wrapping Todd around her finger and playing on his guilt, even fearing that Todd had only loved her out of a vague resemblance to Marty. Blair struggles to carry her daughter, Starr, to term and manages to deliver her, becoming a single mother in the process. Her vengeance against Marty eventually sends her straight into the comforting arms of a jilted Patrick Thornhart. Little does Blair know that one of her nights of passion with Patrick is witnessed by none other than her \\"dead\\" husband Todd. By mid-1996, Todd has \\"come back from the dead\\" and spies her in a clinch with Patrick. He is repulsed at her carrying Patrick's baby, and angrily engineers a kidnapping of Starr. The town rallies behind Todd and Blair over Starr's \\"disappearance\\", and Todd slowly softens towards Blair as she fears for their daughter. Starr is \\"rescued\\" with no one the wiser. A problem arises when it is discovered that Starr now needs a bone marrow transplant. Blair and Patrick's unborn baby is a match. A few weeks before delivery of the child, however, Patrick and Blair are slammed into head-on by another car (driven by Blair's cousin, Kelly Cramer, which sparks a rivalry that never truly fades away), killing Blair's unborn son \\"Brendan\\". Blair lapses into a coma, while a scheming Alex Olanov steps in as the unlikely donor to save Starr's life. Blair wakes up long enough to cast Todd from her life, having discovered that he is behind Starr's kidnapping, then she has a severe stroke. While Blair recuperates, Todd refocuses his attentions, and sues for custody of Starr. Todd marries his lawyer, T√©a Delgado, in 1997 to help him win custody of Starr, which he does. T√©a originally marries Todd because of the money he has paid her, but the two become much closer, and eventually Todd admits that he is in love with T√©a and proposes true marriage. Like Todd and Blair, Todd and T√©a fall in love and marry \\"for real\\". Todd hires Blair to work for him again and tries to prove Bo guilty for the murder of Georgie Phillips to get revenge on the Buchanans. When the evidence starts making Todd look guilty, he kidnaps everyone involved with Georgie and holds them all at the Buchanan lodge, determined to make the real murderer confess and thereby clear himself. Rachel Gannon finally confesses to Georgie's murder, and Todd runs off, taking T√©a with him. In a rage, after T√©a angrily taunts him for kidnapping her, he hits her. She later turns the tables on him when she knocks him out with a shovel, calls the police and has him arrested. Todd escapes soon after, says goodbye to Starr, and corners T√©a in a cabana. Sam Rappaport, Todd's former mentor and longtime father-figure, goes in to talk to Todd and learns that Todd was raped at age 14 by adoptive father Peter Manning. When Sam tries to introduce this fact in court, Todd collapses and goes into a catatonic state. When he awakes, he appears to have DID (split personalities), like his sister Viki. The personality called \\"Tom\\", a more childlike and gentle personality, is in control and is determined to have T√©a give him a second chance. She eventually admits that she is still in love with him. After an apparent \\"integration\\" of Todd's newfound \\"alters\\", Todd and T√©a soon marry again, but at the reception, Starr unknowingly plays a tape over the country club's loud speakers on which Todd confesses that he has been faking the DID to avoid criminal prosecution. Todd quickly leaves town in 1998 and T√©a files for divorce. Blair becomes romantically involved with her past lover, Max Holden. Some time later, Blair finds out that Max has been sleeping with Skye Chandler (later Quartermaine) and faking the brain damage everyone thinks he was recently saddled with. She tries to get revenge by destroying Max and Asa, using the dummy corporation \\"B&B; United\\", which she forms with Ben Davidson. But Blair does not leave Max until Todd Manning shows back up in town, in 2000, determined to win Blair back. This, after he returned earlier in the year for T√©a. Just as Blair starts to forgive Max for sleeping with Skye and they are reconciling, Todd makes sure that Max finds out about Blair's plot against him. Max throws Blair out, and she goes crazy, literally \\"seeing red\\" and shoots Max in the back. Todd helps Blair hide the evidence of the crime and pin the blame on Skye. Blair accepts Todd's marriage proposal and they make love. Todd rushes Blair's divorce through by bribing a judge and the couple plan to marry in the near future. But this marriage is not to be. Max and Skye, bent on revenge, set them up, making it appear as though Blair has slept with Max the night before her wedding to Todd. They drug Blair, making sure that Todd sees them together. Todd does not let on to Blair what he thinks he saw until the wedding itself. His voiced laced with hostility, he announces to everyone that he cannot marry Blair because she is the one who shot Max in the back. Blair is stunned at Todd's betrayal and cannot understand why he is doing this. She later forces Max, at gunpoint to tell her what he has done. Blair goes to Todd to tell him the truth, but it is too late. Todd has already made a deal with the DA and has turned in the clothes Blair wore the night of the shooting, in return for a deal where he is spared jail time. Blair is arrested for shooting Max and is put in jail. In the hope that he will testify on her behalf to keep her and her baby out of jail, she lies when she tells Max that she is pregnant with his child. Blair is unaware, however, that she really is pregnant. She later discovers this when Max drags her to the hospital for a pregnancy test -- except, she privately discovers that she is pregnant with Todd's child. Max agrees to testify on her behalf, but Starr locks him in Asa's wine cellar on the day of the hearing so that he never makes it there. Instead, Todd testifies that Blair was totally out of her mind the day that she shot Max. The judge sends Blair to St. Ann's instead of to jail and she sees her mother there. After talking with Addie, Blair realizes that Todd had actually been trying to help her by keeping her out of jail. Blair wonders if she should try again to tell Todd the truth. Blair goes back to Max and they plan on marrying since Blair is carrying Max's baby. But Blair, knowing that the child is actually Todd's, wrestles with the truth. She flies down to Mexico to have the child, since she is afraid that Todd will take the baby away the same way he took Starr. But Todd follows her to Mexico. There, Todd delivers her baby, unaware that it is his. Todd thinks it is Max's and arranges for Blair's midwife, Paloma Sanchez, who also owns the hacienda, to \\"get rid\\" of the child. The child is given to David Vickers, who takes the baby and gives it to a rich couple in Texas. This whole time, Blair thinks her baby is actually dead, since Todd tells her it is. Blair thinks that Todd will be upset when he finds out the baby \\"she let die\\" was his, so she tells Starr not to tell him. Todd and Blair plan to marry again, but are both haunted by the secrets they are keeping from each other involving the baby. Finally, one of them cracks, before they can go through with the ceremony. Blair reveals to Todd that the baby that \\"died\\" was his. Todd is shocked and scrambles to get their child back. When they finally marry for the third time in December 2001, Todd presents the baby to her on their wedding night as a gift, telling her it was an \\"adopted\\" child. Blair almost finds out the truth several times, when David pops up, demanding more cash, and when Paloma comes to town, trying to tell Blair in broken English that the baby is alive after all. All throughout 2002, the secrets surrounding Jack's birth and identity cause disaster to literally hang over Todd and Blair's marriage. Gabrielle Medina, whom Blair hates, finds out that the child is alive, and blackmails Todd into giving her a job. Blair thinks that Gabrielle is blackmailing him because Todd has gone through some \\"illegal procedures\\" in \\"adopting\\" their baby. But Todd's deception is discovered when baby Jack develops aplastic anemia, just like Starr had, and Todd has to bring Alex Olanov to town to, once again, be the bone marrow donor. Sam Rappaport, learning from Nora that Alex had been Starr's bone marrow donor too, puts everything together and tells Blair the truth, that Jack is her biological son and that Todd lied. Blair is furious with Todd, and she hires bodyguards to keep him away from the baby. She and Sam secretly take the family away to Hawaii to get away from Todd. But the bodyguards are working for Todd and he follows them to Hawaii and plans to kidnap the kids. However, he runs into former love T√©a Delgado there. T√©a warns Blair about Todd's plans, and she is able to bring Starr and Jack safely back to Llanview. Once there, Blair decides to repay Sam for his help by getting his \\"true love\\", Nora, back for him by seducing Troy MacIver and making Nora break up with Troy. Blair's plan fails and Troy and Nora find out what she had been trying to do. Sam is angry at first, but forgives her because she was only trying to help him. Sam and Blair grow closer during Todd's absence (they don't know that he is stranded on a deserted island with T√©a) and Blair begins to depend on him more and more. He helps her through signing her divorce papers from Todd. When Todd returns to town, Blair is worried that he will try to steal her children again, and calls the police when she finds him alone with Jack. She struggles with her feelings for Todd. Blair runs an expos√© of a mob family in The Sun, which brings death threats against her. She does not take them very seriously until one day in the park her daughter's nanny, Suzanne, is shot and killed by a hitman who thinks she was Blair. The hitman comes face to face with Blair when she rushes to Suzanne's side, but the sound of approaching sirens causes him to flee. Blair is taken to a local police station, where Sam, Cassie Callison (who is in town to see Viki) and Todd go to see her. They come up with a plan to protect her. They will tell everyone she has lost her mind and was sent to a clinic in Switzerland. In reality, she will stay at Todd's penthouse where she can hide and still be with her children. Sam and Blair grow closer, but eventually she realizes that Todd is the only man she has ever really been in love with. She comes back to the penthouse and after they both admit they love each other, she forgives him for what he did to Jack and they make love. After Todd saves Blair from the hitman, who is arrested, Todd surprises Blair by calling Rev. Andrew Carptenter, summoned to come over and marry them right away. Sam is suspicious about Todd \\"saving\\" Blair and decides to investigate further into Suzanne's death. During the middle of Todd and Blair's marriage ceremony, Sam shows up at the penthouse with a very much alive Suzanne in tow and interrupts the wedding. Blair moves back into the Cramer mansion and recoils from Todd's latest betrayal. She demands that he stay away from her and their children. Soon after, the reprehensible Mitch Laurence attempts to kidnap Starr in order to have a hold over Todd. Blair catches him in the middle of the act and beggs him to take her instead. He does, chaining her up in an abandoned theater. Todd rescues her, but she is still ambivalent about their relationship. Before she can come to a decision, Todd mysteriously disappears. Meanwhile, her confidante and close friend Sam Rappaport is shot and killed while watching over a sleeping Blair. After initial speculation towards Todd, the blame shifts to Blair. Blair senses immediately that Mitch is involved. Frustrated beyond the breaking point, Blair knocks Mitch out, drags him to Llanfair and plans to shoot him as payback for all he has done to her and Todd, but a just- back-in-town Dorian stops her. Blair is cleared when she, Troy MacIver, and the cops realizes that Mitch must have manipulated an unstable Lindsay Rappaport into killing Sam, as she thought he was Troy. Lindsay confesses and is sent to St. Ann's. Dorian (whose only reason for marrying Mitch is to bring him down and get his money) and Blair works with her to kidnap and use Jessica Buchanan, Mitch's daughter with Viki, as bait for Mitch. Mitch fall off a cliff while attempting to get her back. Blair breathes easy for a brief moment, and has Todd legally declared dead to free up his funds. She learns she will co-own the Sun with Viki and act as editor-in-chief until Starr is in her 20s. She also turns down Troy's romantic overtures. This all happened 2002 to mid-2003. Blair is jarred when a mysterious stranger shows up in town a little later claiming to be Mitch's brother. This man, Walker \\"Flynn\\" Laurence, is secretly working with Mitch, but sides with Blair when he learns of his brother's long list of crimes. Blair and Dorian take a shine to him, and Blair agrees to make him a reporter at The Sun. Blair finds herself the prime suspect in yet another murder when Mitch is killed days after his arrest. Blair, not realizing she is being manipulated by Walker, begins to suspect Dorian as the killer. The killer is actually Jessica, and Walker is trying to protect her. With that resolved, Walker and Blair grow closer and closer. Blair is also being pursued by Kelly's husband, Kevin Buchanan. Not wanting to break up their marriage or give in to her lust for him, Blair flings herself into a relationship with Walker. Walker surprises her by rushing a wedding. She initially hesitates, but finally agrees. Todd is finally gone from her life, she feels, not realizing that Todd is actually standing right beside her. After being brutally beaten and left near death by Mitch's goons, Todd convinced doctors to make him over to resemble Mitch's brother, Walker. As Mitch had not seen Walker in several years, Todd was able to fool him, along with all of Llanview. (In reality, Walker was a mobster who operated in Atlantic City, and the mastermind behind Todd's plastic surgery.) Kevin is the first to discover the secret, but keeps quiet for Blair's sake. When Blair realizes Todd's scheme, all hell breaks loose. She refuses to let him near their children and divorces him. Extremely drunk on New Year's Eve, 2003, Blair has a sleazy roll in the sheets with Kevin. Disgusted with herself, she prepares to leave the Palace Hotel. Todd spots her, realizes what her rumpled clothes mean, and follows her home, to her bedroom. 2004 opens with pure chaos when Blair accuses Todd of rape. She files charges, as well as custody papers. Throughout the trial, Todd goes easy on her, and Blair stays to her story, even as old nemesis Marty Saybrooke returns to town to testify and tell the court she feels that Todd is innocent. Soon after Todd's prison conviction, Blair passes out. She is suffering from a brain tumor. She realizes that she may have been wrong about what happened that night with Todd. As Todd gets a retrial (due to a juror's hearing aid not working), Blair ponders changing her story, not knowing of Todd's plan to tear her credibility to shreds during the new trial. With all the facts out in the open, Todd is exonerated. He still wants Blair back, but she is still unsure of their relationship. Blair is even more suspicious of Todd's new found closeness with Kelly, not knowing that Todd is helping her cover an illegal adoption of a baby to get back at Kevin. Starr is an emotional wreck over everything that has happened during the rape trial and her parents try to reassure her of things, though she still wants Todd and Blair back together. After a fire at the community center, Blair finally sees that she is still in love with Todd, and the two again begin to plan their lives together. But Todd disappears on the eve of their wedding in December 2004, leaving Blair devastated. At first, she is furious with herself for falling for his lies again, but it is not long before she realizes he has been kidnapped by an insane Margaret Cochran, who is in love with and obsessed with Todd. Blair sets out to rescue Todd, but ends up being taken prisoner herself. She thinks she has been rescued when Asa Buchanan appears, but Asa is still angry about Todd and Blair trying to take his home from him a few months earlier. Asa has her committed to a mental institution, where Todd finds her as she is standing on a window ledge. He takes her back to Llanview, where a newly nervous Blair spends most of her time bonding with new next door neighbor, Ginger Foley, and trying to help Todd get over being raped by Margaret. But 2005 does not end well for the couple. Blair meets the new doctor in town, Spencer Truman, when Jack needs to have an emergency tracheotomy performed. Blair and Spencer become fast friends, and their friendship helps her deal with Todd's arrest for the murders of Margaret Cochran and their unborn child, which Todd is convicted of and sentenced to prison for in early 2006. She and Todd eventually split over her growing belief that Todd committed the murders. This also strains her relationship with her daughter, Starr, who believes Todd is completely innocent. Spencer and Blair eventually become lovers, but Blair cannot let Todd out of her heart, and is heartbroken when he will not speak to her shortly before his execution. Blair watches as Todd is executed for the murders of Margaret Cochran and their infant son, and is shocked, as is everyone else, to learn that Margaret is alive and well. Blair feels horrible for believing, even for a moment, that Todd had been guilty. Seeing his lifeless body, she begs him to forgive her. With strained expertise, Todd is quickly brought back to life by Spencer, after Detective John McBain, Natalie Vega, and David Vickers bring a very much alive Margart Cochran into the room where the execution was held. Todd refuses to forgive Blair. Blair, however, refuses to give up on Todd. Determined to prove her love and loyalty to him, she embarks on a Mata Hari-like plan to prove that Spencer is the one behind everything. Spencer is eventually jailed. But halfway through the trial, he fakes insanity, including intentionally repeatedly banging his head on a table in his cell and writing WHORE, referring to Blair, on a wall in the cell with his own blood. He goes as far to hire Marty Saybrooke, who is now a psychologist, to be his doctor; they have several sessions together, and she testifies in court that \\"in her professional opinion, Dr. Truman is not mentally stable, not fit to stand trial\\". By this time, Blair has yet to earn Todd's forgiveness, but she is keeping from him the fact that she has just discovered that she is a few months pregnant with his second son. As a result of Marty's testimony, Truman is sentenced to go to a mental facility instead of jail time. Furious over this, Todd kidnaps him on his way to Wingdale, and holds him captive while performing Chinese water torture on him, in a building for about a week to get Spencer to confess where his son (by Margaret) is. But 2006 goes just as it came -- with all hell breaking loose. Blair gets in an accident when Truman lures her to the building and when she arrives, she finds Todd and Truman fighting on the roof. She gets in the middle of them, as Todd pushes Spencer off the building, accidentally pushing Blair off as well. They hit the ground, three stories below. After her accident, which caused her to miscarry her and Todd's unborn child, Todd forgives her, and immediately plans on proposing to her yet again when she awakes from her coma. Todd proposes to Blair in early 2007, but she turns him down, saying that they are \\"toxic\\" to each other and that they just do not work. When Blair gets out of the hospital, she, Starr and Jack move to La Boulaie with Dorian. In a futile attempt to get over Todd, Blair has sex with Cristian Vega, who in turn is trying to get over Evangeline Williamson. It does not work for either, and although the two become good friends, Blair remains in love with Todd. Acting on a tip from Spencer Truman's ex-patient Miles Laurence, Todd decides to travel to Chicago in the hopes of finding the infant son he had with Margaret Cochran. Blair follows him onto the plane, determined to help. Still heartbroken over their breakup and hurt by Blair's tryst with Cristian, Todd is angry, but still allows Blair to stay with him. The two began a search for the baby, but are soon separated. Todd is stabbed by a mysterious stranger and disappears. A desperate and scared Blair searched for him for months, but she turns up nothing. Eventually, it is revealed that Todd is being drugged and held by a young man named Hunter, who had been hired by Miles Laurence. Hunter's girlfriend turns out to be none other than Sarah Roberts, Todd's niece. Once a horrified Sarah realizes that her uncle is near death, she secretly calls Blair and reveals Todd's whereabouts. By the time Blair gets back to Chicago, Hunter has taken the unconscious Todd and dumped him back in Llanview on Miles' doorstep. In turn, Miles hauls Todd down to the storage room of his apartment building and continues to drug him. After several days, Miles' stepson Cole Thornhart (boyfriend to Todd and Blair's daughter, Starr, and son to Marty) accidentally stumbles upon Todd. Miles begins blackmailing a frightened Cole, telling him that if he tells anyone about Todd, then Cole's mother, Marty, will go to jail for killing Spencer Truman. Torn between his loyalty to his mother and his love for Starr, Cole remains silent, but eventually confesses what he knows to his mother and to the police. By this time, Miles has dumped a drugged Todd in the woods, and then instructs Hunter to drag him to a sleazy motel. It is here that Blair and John McBain finally find Todd boozed up, drugged, naked, and in bed with a prostitute named Kandi who claims she had been partying with him for weeks. A furious Blair does not buy Kandi's story, and rushes Todd to the emergency room. The Manning family, complete with Blair, Todd, Starr, and Jack are reunited at the hospital while Todd recovers from his injuries. Todd remembers little of his 12-week ordeal, but once he learns that Miles is responsible for his plight, he vows revenge. Blair lets Todd know she wants to reconcile with him, and Todd softens towards her. Todd and Blair are upset over what happened before Chicago with Cristian and Evangeline, and know they have a lot to work out. Luckily, for the first time in a long, they seem to be on the same page. Todd and Blair later become closer and nearly kiss. Unfortunately, in court, though Miles is charged with attempted murder for what he did to Todd, the judge throws out the case. Todd and Blair are furious, but can do little about it. They go to the Women of the Year Ceremony together, where things get chaotic as usual, and Lindsay Rappaport (who wins the award) is revealed to be Spencer's murderer. Todd and Blair make sure to cover this revelation in the Sun. After the ceremony, they celebrate their hot front-page story, but the mood is ruined when Miles shows up with information regarding where Todd's son is. Todd, sure that his son is dead, becomes angry and does not believe him, which leads to Todd beating Miles up. Miles, realizing that he has to get the truth to Todd some way, goes to Blair and tells her the truth and gives her proof. It is all there in writing -- Tommy Mcbain is Todd's son. When Marcie McBain is at large with his son, on December 20, 2007, Todd announces that \\"Tommy\\" will be renamed \\"Sam Manning,\\" in honor of his deceased mentor and friend, Sam Rappaport. It is not long afterward that his son is returned to him. Marcie is on the run with Todd's son for almost four months and Blair helps him deal with it. They reconnect during this time, and after a while, Blair comes clean and tells Todd she still loves him. Todd and Blair bring Sam home, everyone deals with adjustment issues, including Blair, who wonders if she will be able to raise Sam as her own son. Blair even starts having visions of Margaret, which she eventually tells Todd about. Todd is concerned and they talk about their issues, leading to Todd telling Blair that he loves her and wants a real marriage with her. The two make love and are reconciled once more. But in 2008, Starr becomes pregnant by Cole after the \\"move\\" Todd was going to have for protection. After Starr and Cole run away, they are found by John, Blair, and then later by Todd. Todd punches Cole and accidentally pushes Starr down the stairs. After Blair finds out that Starr is pregnant, Blair cuts Todd out of their lives for making Starr's life miserable. T√©a Delgado returns to Llanview, PA in late 2008 and begins a relationship with Todd shortly thereafter in 2009. Upon discovering Todd and T√©a's growing closeness, Blair launches a plan to win Todd back from T√©a. After a good effort and intricate plotting on her part, including having sex with Todd in Dorian's cabana, conspiring to defraud T√©a and blackmail, Todd chooses T√©a to Blair's chagrin. After being kidnapped by Ross Rayburn (the unintended result of her latest scheme to break up Todd and T√©a) alongside Todd and T√©a's daughter, Danielle, Blair concedes defeat. When a man appears in town in summer 2011 who has Todd's old face, it is revealed that the man who has been posing as Todd for the last eight years is not really Todd but rather his long-lost twin brother, Victor Lord Jr. Irene had twin boys but brainwashed Victor to take over Todd's life to aid her secret agency with many mission throughout the world. With the revelation that her long-lost love has returned, Blair and Todd may find themselves drawn to each other again, while T√©a is currently married to Victor. Todd blamed Blair for not knowing that Victor wasn't him and for letting him near their children and that he fought to get back to her. Todd moves to Port Charles, where Starr resides. Blair stays in Llanview with Tom√°s Delgado, but decides to come to Port Charles to support Starr when Starr has a singing debut. After the debut, Todd and Blair go back to his hotel room, where they exchange a kiss and he proposes marriage to her, but she says no because she is engaged to Tom√°s. Blair then heads back to Llanview. A few months later, Todd, Carly, and Skye find out Tom√°s could be Alcazar.  Impact  Todd and Blair are often recognized as one of television's most prominent pairings. The two were nominated for \\"Most Irresistible Combination\\" at the 32nd Daytime Emmy Awards, and in 2001, were nominated for About.com's couple of the year title. In 2002, Todd and Blair were named the top One Life to Live all-time romantic couple by magazine Soaps In Depth. They are also one of the most avidly watched supercouples. Before the writers secured Todd and Blair as a supercouple, the pairing was often in direct competition with rival couple Todd and T√©a, an alternate romantic pairing for Todd. This created an intense rivalry between the two fanbases, which became known as the \\"T&B; vs. TnT\\" wars, and were some of the genre's most notorious Internet battles. They left writers and producers with the task of deciding which couple would be the \\"true love\\" couple. In addition, viewers enjoyed the battles between Blair and T√©a, which became one of soap opera's most entertaining rivalries. While Todd is the town rapist (having raped Marty Saybrooke in college), Blair herself is the product of rape (as her mentally ill mother was raped and impregnated by an unnamed hospital attendant). Todd and Blair were the original founders of \\"The Most Pathetic Club\\" in which they competed for the title of \\"Most Pathetic.\\" They had their first real meeting at Rodi's Bar in 1994; Blair was drinking at the bar when Todd came up and asked if the seat next to her was taken. The writers also scripted Todd and Blair as best friends before the two ever became involved romantically.

It was endemic to the Mascarene island of Mauritius in the Indian Ocean east of Madagascar. It is unclear what other species it is most closely related to, but it has been classified as a member of the tribe Psittaculini, along with other Mascarene parrots. It had similarities with the Rodrigues parrot (Necropsittacus rodricanus), and may have been closely related. The broad-billed parrot's head was large in proportion to its body, and there was a distinct crest of feathers on the front of the head. The bird had a very large beak, comparable in size to that of the hyacinth macaw, which would have enabled it to crack hard seeds. Subfossil bones indicate that the species exhibited greater sexual dimorphism in overall size and head size than any living parrot. The exact colouration is unknown, but a contemporary description indicates that it had multiple colours, including a blue head, and perhaps a red body and beak. It is believed to have been a weak flier, but not flightless. The broad-billed parrot was first referred to as the \\"Indian raven\\" in Dutch ships' journals from 1598 onwards. Only a few brief contemporary descriptions and three depictions are known. It was first scientifically described from a subfossil mandible in 1866, but this was not linked to the old accounts until the rediscovery of a detailed 1601 sketch that matched both the subfossils and the accounts. The bird became extinct in the 17th century owing to a combination of deforestation, predation by introduced invasive species, and probably hunting as well. Taxonomy Woodcut from 1601, with the first published depiction of a broad-billed parrot (perched in a tree above). The legend reads: \\"5* Is a bird which we called the Indian Crow, more than twice as big as the parroquets, of two or three colours\\".Cheke and Hume (2008). p. 172. The earliest known descriptions of the broad-billed parrot were provided by Dutch travellers during the Second Dutch Expedition to Indonesia, led by the Dutch Admiral Jacob Cornelis van Neck in 1598. They appear in reports published in 1601, which also contain the first illustration of the bird, along with the first of a dodo. The Dutch sailors who visited Mauritius categorised the broad-billed parrots separately from parrots, and referred to them as \\"Indische ravens\\" (translated as either \\"Indian ravens\\" or \\"Indian crows\\") without accompanying useful descriptions, which caused confusion when their journals were studied. The British naturalist Hugh Edwin Strickland assigned the \\"Indian ravens\\" to the hornbill genus Buceros in 1848, because he interpreted the projection on the forehead in the 1601 illustration as a horn.Check & Hume. (2008). pp. 23‚Äì25. The Dutch and the French also referred to South American macaws as \\"Indian ravens\\" during the 17th century, and the name was used for hornbills by Dutch, French, and English speakers in the East Indies.Hume, J. P. (2007). pp. 4‚Äì17. The British traveller Sir Thomas Herbert referred to the broad-billed parrot as \\"Cacatoes\\" (cockatoo) in 1634, with the description \\"birds like Parrats, fierce and indomitable\\", but naturalists did not realise that he was referring to the same bird. Even after subfossils of a parrot matching the descriptions were found, the French zoologist Emile Oustalet argued in 1897 that the \\"Indian raven\\" was a hornbill whose remains awaited discovery. The Mauritian ornithologist France Staub was in favour of this idea as late as 1993. No remains of hornbills have ever been found on the island, and apart from an extinct species from New Caledonia, hornbills are not found on any oceanic islands. The first known physical remain of the broad-billed parrot was a subfossil mandible collected along with the first batch of dodo bones found in the Mare aux Songes swamp. The British biologist Richard Owen described the mandible in 1866 and identified it as belonging to a large parrot species, to which he gave the binomial name Psittacus mauritianus. This holotype specimen is now lost. The common name \\"broad-billed parrot\\" was first used by Owen in a 1866 lecture. In 1868, shortly after the 1601 journal of the Dutch East India Company ship Gelderland had been rediscovered, the German ornithologist Hermann Schlegel examined an unlabelled pen-and-ink sketch in it. Realising that the drawing, which is attributed to the Dutch artist Joris Joostensz Laerle, depicted the parrot described by Owen, Schlegel made the connection with the old journal descriptions. Because its bones and crest are significantly different from those of Psittacus species, the British zoologist Alfred Newton assigned it to its own genus in 1875, which he called Lophopsittacus. Lophos is the Ancient Greek word for crest, referring here to the bird's frontal crest, and psittakos means parrot. In 1973, based on remains collected by the French amateur naturalist Louis Etienne Thirioux in the early 20th century, the British ornithologist Daniel T. Holyoak placed a small subfossil Mauritian parrot in the same genus as the broad-billed parrot and named it Lophopsittacus bensoni. In 2007, on the basis of a comparison of subfossils, correlated with 17th and 18th century descriptions of small grey parrots, Hume reclassified it as a species in the genus Psittacula and called it Thirioux's grey parrot. In 1967, the American ornithologist James Greenway had speculated that reports of grey Mauritian parrots referred to the broad-billed parrot. Evolution Lithograph of the now lost subfossil holotype mandible, 1866 The taxonomic affinities of the broad-billed parrot are undetermined. Considering its large jaws and other osteological features, the British ornithologists Edward Newton and Hans Gadow thought it to be closely related to the Rodrigues parrot (Necropsittacus rodricanus) in 1893, but were unable to determine whether they both belonged in the same genus, since a crest was only known from the latter. The British ornithologist Graham S. Cowles instead found their skulls too dissimilar for them to be close relatives in 1987. Many endemic Mascarene birds, including the dodo, are derived from South Asian ancestors, and the British palaeontologist Julian Hume has proposed that this may be the case for all the parrots there as well. Sea levels were lower during the Pleistocene, so it was possible for species to colonise some of the then less isolated islands.Cheke and Hume (2008). p. 71. Although most extinct parrot species of the Mascarenes are poorly known, subfossil remains show that they shared features such as enlarged heads and jaws, reduced pectoral bones, and robust leg bones. Hume has suggested that they have a common origin in the radiation of the tribe Psittaculini, basing this theory on morphological features and the fact that Psittacula parrots have managed to colonise many isolated islands in the Indian Ocean. The Psittaculini may have invaded the area several times, as many of the species were so specialised that they may have evolved significantly on hotspot islands before the Mascarenes emerged from the sea. Description Artistic adaptation based on a tracing of the Gelderland sketch, 1896 The broad-billed parrot possessed a distinct frontal crest of feathers. Ridges on the skull indicate that this crest was firmly attached, and that the bird, unlike cockatoos, could not raise or lower it. The 1601 Gelderland sketch was examined in 2003 by Hume, who compared the ink finish with the underlying pencil sketch and found that the latter showed several additional details. The pencil sketch depicts the crest as a tuft of rounded feathers attached to the front of the head at the base of the beak, and shows long primary covert feathers, large secondary feathers, and a slightly bifurcated tail. Measurements of sub-fossils known by 1893 show that the mandible was in length, in width, the femur was in length, the tibia was , and the metatarsus . Unlike other Mascarene parrots, the broad-billed parrot had a flattened skull. Subfossils show that the males were larger, measuring to the females' and that both sexes had disproportionately large heads and beaks. The sexual dimorphism in size between male and female skulls is the largest among parrots. Differences in the bones of the rest of the body and limbs are less pronounced; nevertheless, it had greater sexual dimorphism in overall size than any living parrot. The size differences between the two birds in the 1601 sketch may be due to this feature.Hume, J. P. (2007). p. 51. A 1602 account by the Dutch sailor Reyer Cornelisz has traditionally been interpreted as the only contemporary mention of size differences among broad-billed parrots, listing \\"large and small Indian crows\\" among the animals of the island. A full transcript of the original text was only published in 2003, and showed that a comma had been incorrectly placed in the English translation; \\"large and small\\" instead referred to \\"field-hens\\", possibly the red rail and the smaller Cheke's wood rail. 1907 restoration by Henrik Gr√∂nvold (based on the Gelderland sketch), inaccurately showing the bird as entirely blue; the body probably had a different colour in reality There has been some confusion over the colouration of the broad-billed parrot. The report of van Neck's 1598 voyage, published in 1601, contained the first illustration of the parrot, with a caption stating that the bird had \\"two or three colours\\". The last account of the bird, and the only mention of specific colours, was by the German preacher Johann Christian Hoffman in 1673‚Äì75: In spite of the mention of several colours, authors such as the British naturalist Walter Rothschild claimed that the Gelderland journal described the bird as entirely blue-grey, and it was restored this way in Rothschild's 1907 book Extinct Birds. Later examination of the journal by Julian Hume has revealed only a description of the dodo. He suggested that the distinctively drawn facial mask may represent a separate colour. The British ecologist Anthony S. Cheke suggested in 1987 that in addition to size dimorphism, the sexes may have had different colours, which would explain some of the discrepancies in the old descriptions. The head was evidently blue, and in 2007, Hume suggested the beak may have been red, and the rest of the plumage greyish or blackish, which also occurs in other members of Psittaculini. In 2015, a translation of the 1660s report of the Dutch soldier Johannes Pretorius about his stay on Mauritius (from 1666 to 1669) was published, wherein he described the bird as \\"very beautifully coloured\\". Hume accordingly reinterpreted Hoffman's account, and suggested the bird may have been brightly coloured with a red body, blue head, and red beak; the bird was illustrated as such in the paper. Possible iridescent or glossy feathers that changed appearance according to angle of light may also have given the impression that it had even more colours. The Australian ornithologist Joseph M. Forshaw agreed in 2017 that the bill was red (at least in males), but interpreted Hoffman's account as suggesting a more subdued reddish-brown colouration in general, with a pale bluish-grey head, similar to the Mascarene parrot. Behaviour and ecology Sketch by Sir Thomas Herbert from 1634 showing a broad-billed parrot, a red rail, and a dodo Pretorius kept various now-extinct Mauritian birds in captivity, and described the behaviour of the broad-billed parrot as follows: Though the broad-billed parrot may have fed on the ground and been a weak flier, its tarsometatarsus was short and stout, implying some arboreal characteristics. The Newton brothers and many authors after them inferred that it was flightless, due to the apparent short wings and large size shown in the 1601 Gelderland sketch. According to Hume, the underlying pencil sketch actually shows that the wings are not particularly short. They appear broad, as they commonly are in forest-adapted species, and the alula appears large, a feature of slow-flying birds. Its sternal keel was reduced, but not enough to prevent flight, as the adept flying Cyanoramphus parrots also have reduced keels, and even the flightless kakapo, with its vestigial keel, is capable of gliding. Furthermore, Hoffman's account states that it could fly, albeit with difficulty, and the first published illustration shows the bird on top of a tree, an improbable position for a flightless bird. The broad-billed parrot may have been behaviourally near-flightless, like the now-extinct Norfolk Island kaka. Subfossil remains, including leg bones, a mandible, and a sternum Sexual dimorphism in beak size may have affected behaviour. Such dimorphism is common in other parrots, for example in the palm cockatoo and the New Zealand kaka. In species where it occurs, the sexes prefer food of different sizes, the males use their beaks in rituals, or the sexes have specialised roles in nesting and rearing. Similarly, the large difference between male and female head size may have been reflected in the ecology of each sex, though it is impossible to determine how. In 1953, the Japanese ornithologist Masauji Hachisuka suggested the broad-billed parrot was nocturnal, like the kakapo and the night parrot, two extant ground-dwelling parrots. Contemporary accounts do not corroborate this, and the orbits are of similar size to those of other large diurnal parrots. The broad-billed parrot was recorded on the dry leeward side of Mauritius, which was the most accessible for people, and it was noted that birds were more abundant near the coast, which may indicate that the fauna of such areas was more diverse. It may have nested in tree cavities or rocks, like the Cuban amazon. The terms raven or crow may have been suggested by the bird's harsh call, its behavioural traits, or just its dark plumage. The following description by the Dutch bookkeeper Jacob Granaet from 1666 mentions some of the broad-billed parrot's co-inhabitants of the forests, and might indicate its demeanour: Statues in Hungary of the likewise extinct Newton's parakeet of Rodrigues (left) and the broad-billed parrot Many other endemic species of Mauritius were lost after the arrival of man, so the ecosystem of the island is severely damaged and hard to reconstruct. Before humans arrived, Mauritius was entirely covered in forests, almost all of which have since been lost to deforestation. The surviving endemic fauna is still seriously threatened. The broad-billed parrot lived alongside other recently extinct Mauritian birds such as the dodo, the red rail, the Mascarene grey parakeet, the Mauritius blue pigeon, the Mauritius owl, the Mascarene coot, the Mauritian shelduck, the Mauritian duck, and the Mauritius night heron. Extinct Mauritian reptiles include the saddle-backed Mauritius giant tortoise, the domed Mauritius giant tortoise, the Mauritian giant skink, and the Round Island burrowing boa. The small Mauritian flying fox and the snail Tropidophora carinata lived on Mauritius and R√©union but became extinct in both islands. Some plants, such as Casearia tinifolia and the palm orchid, have also become extinct.Cheke and Hume (2008). pp. 371‚Äì373. Diet Seeds of Latania loddigesii, perhaps part of this parrot's diet Species that are morphologically similar to the broad-billed parrot, such as the hyacinth macaw and the palm cockatoo, may provide insight into its ecology. Anodorhynchus macaws, which are habitual ground dwellers, eat very hard palm nuts. The Brazilian ornithologist Carlos Yamashita suggested in 1997 that these macaws once depended on now-extinct South American megafauna to eat fruits and excrete the seeds, and that they later relied on domesticated cattle to do this. Similarly, in Australasia the palm cockatoo feeds on undigested seeds from cassowary droppings. Yamashita also suggested that the abundant Cylindraspis tortoises and dodos performed the same function on Mauritius, and that the broad-billed parrot, with its macaw-like beak, depended on them to obtain cleaned seeds. Many types of palms and palm-like plants on Mauritius produce hard seeds that the broad-billed parrot may have eaten, including Latania loddigesii, Mimusops maxima, Sideroxylon grandiflorum, Diospyros egrettorium, and Pandanus utilis. Mandible fragments in Naturalis On the basis of radiographs, Holyoak claimed that the mandible of the broad-billed parrot was weakly constructed and suggested that it would have fed on soft fruits rather than hard seeds. As evidence, he pointed out that the internal trabeculae were widely spaced, that the upper bill was broad whereas the palatines were narrow, and the fact that no preserved upper rostrum had been discovered, which he attributed to its delicateness. The British ornithologist George A. Smith, however, pointed out that the four genera Holyoak used as examples of \\"strong jawed\\" parrots based on radiographs, Cyanorhamphus, Melopsittacus, Neophema and Psephotus, actually have weak jaws in life, and that the morphologies cited by Holyoak do not indicate strength. Hume has since pointed out that the mandible morphology of the broad-billed parrot is comparable to that of the largest living parrot, the hyacinth macaw, which cracks open palm nuts with ease. It is therefore probable that the broad- billed parrot fed in the same manner. Extinction Though Mauritius had previously been visited by Arab vessels in the Middle Ages and Portuguese ships between 1507 and 1513, they did not settle on the island. The Dutch Empire acquired the island in 1598, renaming it after the Dutch stadtholder Maurice of Nassau, and it was used from then on for the provisioning of trade vessels of the Dutch East India Company. To the Dutch sailors who visited Mauritius from 1598 and onwards, the fauna was mainly interesting from a culinary standpoint. Of the eight or so parrot species endemic to the Mascarenes, only the echo parakeet of Mauritius has survived. The others were likely all made extinct by a combination of excessive hunting and deforestation. Because of its poor flying ability, large size and possible island tameness, the broad-billed parrot was easy prey for sailors who visited Mauritius, and their nests would have been extremely vulnerable to predation by introduced crab-eating macaques and rats. Various sources indicate the bird was aggressive, which may explain why it held out so long against introduced animals after all. The bird is believed to have become extinct by the 1680s, when the palms it may have sustained itself on were harvested on a large scale. Unlike other parrot species, which were often taken as pets by sailors, there are no records of broad-billed parrots being transported from Mauritius either live or dead, perhaps because of the stigma associated with ravens. The birds would not in any case have survived such a journey if they refused to eat anything but seeds.Cheke and Hume (2008). p. 38.

It was entered into competition at the 2000 Cannes Film Festival (\\"Official Selection 2000\\"), and later went on to win awards around the world. In a 2014 Sight & Sound poll, film critics voted The Gleaners and I the eighth best documentary film of all time. In 2016, the film appeared at No. 99 on BBC's list of the 100 greatest films of the 21st century. The subjects The film tracks a series of gleaners as they hunt for food, knicknacks, thrown away items, and personal connection. Varda travels the French countryside as well as the city to find and film not only field gleaners, but also urban gleaners and those connected to gleaners, including a wealthy restaurant owner whose ancestors were gleaners. The film spends time capturing the many aspects of gleaning and the many people who glean to survive. One such person is the teacher named Alain, an urban gleaner with a master's degree who teaches French to immigrants. Varda's other subjects include artists who incorporate recycled materials into their work, symbols she discovers during her filming (including a clock without hands and a heart-shaped potato), and the French laws regarding gleaning versus abandoned property. Varda also spends time with Louis Pons, who explains how junk is a \\"cluster of possibilities.\\" In order to find the subjects Varda claimed her method was to ask all the people she knew to talk to everyone - \\"the peasants, the owners, the farmers, the fruit growers - about our film. I said to my assistant, \\"Call everybody you know.\\" The result of these subjects, Varda stated that \\"The more l met them, the more I could see I had nothing to make as a statement. They make the statement; they explain the subject better than anybody.\\" This film has an unexpected brief interview with the psychoanalyst Jean Laplanche, plus follow-up segments on some of the featured people. Production Varda describes her filming and writing process as cinecriture: the process of writing narration, choosing shots, encountering subjects, editing, choosing music is ‚Äúall chance working with me, all this is the film writing that I often talk about.‚ÄùZeitgeist Films. She describes in the press kit for the film that she and her team would travel and shoot for roughly two weeks at a time and immediately proceed to edit while scouting for additional locations. Gleaners was filmed throughout France, in Beauce, Jura, Provence, the Pyrenees and in the suburbs of Paris. She says the entire process took place between September 1999 and April 2000. Varda traveled alone to get most of her ‚Äúgleaned‚Äù shots, scouting markets between 2 and 4 p.m. Most of the abandoned objects and shots she found, including the ‚Äúdancing lens cap‚Äù and the heart-shaped potato, were ‚Äú[strokes] of luck‚Äîand we immediately filmed it.‚Äù Varda produced The Gleaners and I under Cine-Tamaris, the company she founded in 1954 and that has produced most of her previous films. Gleaners was distributed by Zeitgeist Films in New York, a company that has distributed films from such directors as Christopher Nolan and the Brothers Quay. Technique The film is notable for its use of a hand-held camera and for its unusual camera angles and techniques. In one particular scene Varda, the filmmaker, forgets to turn off her camera. As the camera hangs to her side the filming proceeds, and the viewer can see the shifting ground and the dangling lens cap with a jazz music background. Varda calls this shot \\"The Dance of the Lens Cap\\". In The Gleaners and I, Varda films herself combing her newly discovered gray hair, and there are many visuals of her aging hands. In one scene, she \\"catches\\" trucks on the freeway, forming a circle with her hand in front of the camera framing the truck in the center, then closing her hand as she drives past them. Reception The Gleaners and I was first screened out of competition at the 2000 Cannes Film Festival (\\"Official Selection 2000\\").

The work was acclaimed by critics, achieving a score of 83/100 on Metacritic and a 92% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Peter Rainer dubbed it \\"lyrically ramshackle\\". Edward Guthmann of the San Francisco Chronicle argued, \\"Varda's subject matter is surprisingly rich, but it's her own energetic, curious nature that gives the film its snap.\\" In the Chicago Tribune, Michael Wilmington wrote, \\"In its frames, we see [Varda's] empathy, skill, curiosity, wit, poetry and passion for life: everything she has gleaned from a lifetime of love and movies.\\" Awards The Gleaners and I went on to earn awards around the world including top honors at the Chicago International Film Festival, Boston Society of Film Critics Awards, the European Film Awards, the French Syndicate of Cinema Critics, the Los Angeles Film Critics Association Awards, the National Society of Film Critics Awards (USA), the New York Film Critics Circle Awards, Online Film Critics Society Awards and the Prague One World Film Festival (\\"The Gleaners & I\\"). In addition to its festival honors, The Gleaners and I was ‚Äúdeclared the best French film of 2000 by the French Union of Film Critics, which broke with tradition by not choosing a dramatic film.‚ÄùRich, B.

Even Varda, herself, remarked at the film's success, \\"I've never in my entire career felt that people have loved a film of mine as much as this one.‚ÄùDarke, Chris. \\"Refuseniks (Agnes Varda's DV Documentary, the 'Gleaners and I').\\" SIGHT AND SOUND 11.1 (2001): 30-3.

Haden Guest argues that the ease with which Varda blends documentary and narrative technique is a key reason that her films continue to be so relevant, especially ‚Äúas we witness a resurgence of documentary and a particularly strong interest in hybridized modes of fiction/nonfiction cinema‚Äù (48). Jake Wilson, on the other hand, conjectures that Varda (while perhaps not fully realizing it) tapped into the cultural zeitgeist and constructed a film that ‚Äúembodies a quasi-anarchist ethos‚Äù that is built on a ‚Äúresistance to consumerism, a suspicion of authority, and a desire to reconnect politics with everyday life.‚Äù Varda's The Gleaners and I is notable in another regard, as well. In a film about gleaning, Varda recognizes that she is a gleaner. ‚ÄúI'm not poor, I have enough to eat,‚Äù says Varda, but she points to ‚Äúanother kind of gleaning, which is artistic gleaning. You pick ideas, you pick images, you pick emotions from other people, and then you make it into a film.‚ÄùAnderson, M., and A. Varda. \\"The Modest Gesture of the Filmmaker - an Interview with Agnes Varda.\\" CINEASTE 26.4 (2001): 24-7. To collect the objects of her gleaning, Varda chooses a digital video camera. In a number of scenes Varda shows and discusses the camera itself and in so doing transforms a film about waste into a reflexive meditation on the art of digital documentary. While Varda did not pioneer the reflexive documentary (that honor goes to Dziga Vertov and his 1929 masterpiece Man with a Movie Camera),Chapman, Jane. Issues in Contemporary Documentary. p. 144 Cambridge: Polity, 2009.

Print. Another factor that makes The Gleaners and I especially noteworthy in the context of cinematic history is the fact that a filmmaker of Varda's stature chose to abandon high-end film equipment for low-end digital video. For Varda, the decision was in many ways a practical one. As she notes in her interview with Melissa Anderson ‚ÄúI had the feeling that this is the camera that would bring me back to the early short films I made in 1957 and 1958. I felt free at that time. With the new digital camera, I felt I could film myself, get involved as a filmmaker.‚ÄùAnderson, M., and A. Varda. \\"The Modest Gesture of the Filmmaker - an Interview with Agnes Varda.\\" CINEASTE 26.4 (2001): 24-7. Varda's choice to make a camcorder a primary tool of production as well as a central element of her film, can be seen as an implicit (if not explicit) recognition of a new digital era in documentary filmmaking. Yet, for Varda, ‚Äúthe first-person, artisan film-making encouraged by digital video [was] nothing new.‚Äù While she acknowledges video's convenience, she downplays any larger significance: \\"What's missing in all this talk of digital technologies is the understanding that ... they're not ends in themselves.\\" For Varda, digital cameras and editing equipment are simply tools that enable her to film by herself and to get closer to people \\"and to collapse the time lapse between wanting to film something and actually being able to do it.\\" See also * The Gleaners painting by Jean-Fran√ßois Millet completed in 1857. * The Gleaners, a 2019 studio album by American jazz bassist Larry Grenadier, inspired by the film.

The theatre is a small movie house with one screen. It is one of the few remaining movie theaters, if not the only one, to use a rear-projection system; the projector is located behind the screen rather than behind the audience. The Brattle Theatre mainly screens a mixture of foreign, independent, and classic films, and began showing repertory and foreign films in February 1953. Despite the rapid disappearance of American arthouse theaters, the Brattle has managed to maintain a loyal base of moviegoers while remaining independently operated. History The theatre was started by the Cambridge Social Union, cofounded in January 1871 by the Reverend Samuel Longfellow, brother of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. In 1889, the union purchased the lot on Brattle Street for $9,000, and hired the Cambridge architectural firm headed by Alexander Wadsworth Longfellow, Jr. to draft plans for Brattle Hall. The gala opening occurred on January 27, 1890. Local and touring drama groups used the hall, which also housed a ballet school, lectures, and police calisthenics. The theatre sometimes came into conflict with the city, however. In 1928, the city attempted to ban a production of Fiesta, a politically controversial drama performed by the Harvard Dramatic Club, but could not close the show. The 1942 production of Othello starring African-American actor Paul Robeson played the Brattle, bolstering its reputation as a progressive institution.Brattle Theatre Cambridge History (Accessed June 16, 2015) In 1948, a group of World War II veterans attending Harvard founded the Brattle Theatre Company. The Company presented classic and contemporary serious drama with a group of repertory actors and directors. Among the players whose careers began with the Company were Jerome Kilty, Cavada Humphrey, Albert Marre, and Robert Fletcher. The actor Zero Mostel, who had been blacklisted for his political affiliations, made his national stage debut in a production of Moli√®re's The Imaginary Invalid, and the British actress Hermione Gingold made her American debut.Timeline of Brattle Theatre Accessed June 16, 2015 In the 1950s, Cyrus Harvey, Jr., a 1947 graduate of Harvard College, and Bryant Haliday, a 1947 Harvard graduate, established the Brattle as one of the first art house movie theaters. They revived forgotten American classic films and contemporary foreign films. Many of the foreign films have become classic, such as those by Akira Kurosawa, Ingmar Bergman, Federico Fellini, and Fran√ßois Truffaut.Rebecca J. Mazur, \\"Past Tense: The Brattle Theatre,\\" Harvard Crimson February 14, 2013 (Accessed June 16, 2015) Harvey and Haliday built on the Brattle model to establish Janus Films, which acquired and distributed world cinema and influenced the model used by The Criterion Collection.  Bogie Cult  Starting in the late 1950s, the Brattle started a tradition of screening Humphrey Bogart films during the week of final exams at Harvard University. Films such as Casablanca and The Maltese Falcon were watched again and again and the \\"Bogie Cult\\" at the Brattle was formed. It was not uncommon for fans to attend these movies in costume and recite the dialogue word for word. Even to this day, there is always a packed crowd to see a Bogart film, such as the traditional Valentine's Day showing of Casablanca. The Brattle today Today, the Brattle is operated as a non-profit and is run by the Brattle Film Foundation. It is currently the only independent cinema operated in the city of Cambridge. The Brattle continues to screen an eclectic mix of foreign, arthouse, and \\"recent rave\\" films. Ongoing events include, but are not limited to, the Schlock Around the Clock series, the Bugs Bunny Film Festival, the Art House Auction, the Oscar Party, and the Watch-a-thon. Starting in October 2005, the Brattle announced its largest fundraising mission in its 55-year history. The goal was to raise $500,000 over the next two years to pay down past rent and to solidify its outreach and community programs. On February 16, 2008, the Brattle Theatre celebrated its 55th anniversary as a movie theater in Harvard Square. In early 2013, the Brattle Theatre conducted a successful Kickstarter campaign to fund a digital projection system and a HVAC upgrade.\\"Brattle Theatre: Digital Projection & HVAC Renovation by Brattle Film Foundation\\", January 23 2013, Kickstarter.

These advertisements are the result of a business or a service providing a valuable consideration, usually money, in exchange for the station airing their commercial or mentioning them on air. The most common advertisements are \\"spot commercials\\", which normally last for no more than one minute, and longer programs, commonly running up to one hour, known as \\"informercials\\". The United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC), established under the Communications Act of 1934, regulates commercial broadcasting, and the laws regarding radio advertisements remain relatively unchanged from the Radio Act of 1927.\\"The Radio Act of 1927 as a Product of Progressivism\\" by Mark Goodman (scripps.ohiou.edu) In 2015, radio accounted for 7.8% of total U.S. media expenditures.\\"US Spending on Paid Media Expected to Climb 5.1% in 2016\\" March 25, 2016. (emarketer.com)  History  Commercial advertising by audio services goes back to even before the introduction of radio broadcasting, beginning with the 1893 establishment of telephone-based Telefon H√≠rmond√≥ of Budapest, Hungary. As of 1901, this \\"telephone newspaper\\" was selling twelve- second spots for one florin each to reach the subscribers listening to the service's programming.\\"The Telephone Newspaper\\" by Thomas S. Denison, World's Work, April 1901, page 642. The first radio stations, introduced in the late 1800s, used crude spark transmitters, which could only transmit the dots-and- dashes of Morse code. Beginning in the early 1900s, the first transmitters capable of audio transmissions were invented, and although initially these were primarily used for point-to-point communication, there was concurrent experimentation with the broadcasting of news and entertainment. The test transmissions for many of these earliest stations were in effect advertisements for their owners and the new technology. However, it soon became a fairly common practice for stations to arrange to play phonograph records in exchange for mentioning on the air the companies which provided the records. The earliest known example of this practice occurred in July 1912, when Charles Herrold in San Jose, California began making weekly radio broadcasts from his technical school, with the initial broadcast featuring phonograph records supplied by the Wiley B. Allen company.\\"Will Give Concert by Wireless Telephone\\", San Jose Mercury Herald, July 21, 1912, page 27. An even more ambitious effort took place in the fall of 1916, after the De Forest Radio Telephone & Telegraph Company began operating an experimental radio station, 2XG, in New York City. Lee de Forest made an arrangement with the Columbia Gramophone record company to broadcast phonograph records from their offices‚Äîthe phonograph company supplied records in exchange for \\"announcing the title and 'Columbia Gramophone Company' with each playing\\".Father of Radio: The Autobiography of Lee de Forest, 1950, page 337. The debut program was aired on October 26, 1916\\"Columbia Used to Demonstrate Wireless Telephone\\", The Music Trade Review, November 4, 1916, page 52. (mtr.arcade- museum.com) and it was announced that nightly transmissions of news interspersed with Columbia recordings would be sent from de Forest's Highbridge laboratory beginning on November 1. De Forest initially also took advantage of these broadcasts to advertise \\"the products of the De Forest Radio Co., mostly the radio parts, with all the zeal of our catalogue and price list\\", until comments by Western Electric engineers caused him to eliminate the sales messages.De Forest (1950) pages 337-338. At the time, a commentator in QST magazine noted that 2XG's efforts showcased the practicality of \\"conducting regular advertising and news talks by radio\\" which was \\"decidedly something to think about\\".\\"Radio Telephone Advertising\\", QST, April 1917, page 34. Radio broadcasting was suspended in April 1917 after the United States entered World War One, when a government ban silenced civilian radio stations for the duration of the conflict. This ban was lifted in October 1919, and some additional promotional record broadcasts took place, including Westinghouse engineer Frank Conrad over experimental station 8XK, located at his home in Wilkinsburg, Pennsylvania, who provided on-air acknowledgements to the Brunswick Shop in exchange for the store supplying him with recently released records.\\"Signing Off on the First Ten Years\\" by George W. Gray, World's Work, December, 1930, page 47. A more formal example was a late October 1920 broadcast, over the Precision Equipment Company of Cincinnati, Ohio's experimental station, 9XB, that was sponsored by the Randolph Wurlitzer Company, and featured the Victor records that would go on sale in November.\\"Wurlitzer presents the new November Victor Records by Wireless Telephone\\" (advertisement), Cincinnati Enquirer, October 31, 1920, page 9. However, shortly after radio broadcasting became widely established in the United States in 1922, the record industry became concerned that instead of promoting sales the radio broadcasts were actually suppressing purchases, and these promotional broadcasts ended. Many early broadcasting stations were put on the air by radio equipment manufacturers, such as Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company and General Electric, and radio receiver sales agents, including department stores such as Gimbel's, Bamberger's and Wanamaker's. This provided their customers programming for their purchases, with the sales financing station operations. But as more stations began operating, station owners were increasingly faced with the issue of how to continue to afford the costs, because operating a radio station became a significant expense, especially when it became the norm to pay performers, and after music publishers successfully argued that they were due royalties for the music the stations played. In February 1922, the American Telephone & Telegraph Company (AT&T;) announced it planned to begin establishing stations that would be dedicated to selling their airtime to interested parties, which AT&T; called \\"toll broadcasting\\".\\"National Radio Broadcast By Bell System\\", Science & Invention, April 1922, pages 1144, 1173. Its primary station, WEAF in New York (now WFAN), aired its first paid radio commercial on August 28, 1922 for the Queensboro Corporation, advertising a new apartment complex in Jackson Heights, Queens, near the just-completed #7 subway line.\\"And Now a Word From Our Sponsor\\", Broadcasting-Telecasting, October 15, 1956, page 110. Based on a series of industry cross-licensing agreements, AT&T; initially claimed that its patent rights gave it a monopoly on commercial radio transmissions. Although the courts upheld this contention, the practice was widely disliked, and AT&T; soon came up with a licensing scheme to allow individual stations to begin selling airtime.\\"Licensing Broadcast Stations\\", Radio Broadcast, August 1924, page 300. It appears that a few other radio stations may have quietly sold airtime and carried paid advertising before WEAF. Frank V. Bremer reportedly leased his Jersey City, New Jersey amateur station, 2IA, to the Jersey Review in May 1920, for $35 for twice-a-week broadcasts, then on January 1, 1922 further leased the station for $50 to the Jersey Journal for a New Year's broadcast.\\"Jersey Journal New Year Greetings, by Wireless, Heard Country Over\\", Jersey (City) Journal, January 3, 1922, page 10.The First Quarter-Century of American Broadcasting by E. P. J. Shurick, 1946, page 155. Additionally, on April 4, 1922 Alvan T. Fuller reportedly purchased time on WGI of Medford Hillside, Massachusetts, in order to promote his Packard automobile dealership.Boston Radio: 1920-2010 by Donna L. Halper, page 8.\\"Great Moments In Advertising: 1st Radio Spot\\" by Derrick Daye, August 25, 2009 (brandingstrategyinsider.com) Initially the idea of radio advertising was extremely controversial. An article in the November 1922 issue of Radio Broadcast magazine lamented that \\"driblets of advertising... are floating through the ether every day\\" and expressed concern that \\"The woods are full of opportunists who are restrained by no scruples when the scent of profit comes down the wind.\\"\\"Should Radio be Used for Advertising?\\" by Joseph H. Jackson, Radio Broadcast, November 1922, pages 72-76. Even though until the mid-1920s a few stations held out against carrying commercials, no other financing scheme proved practical, and by the late-1920s most U.S. radio stations were carrying commercially sponsored programs. During radio's golden age, advertisers sponsored entire programs, usually with some sort of message like \\"We thank our sponsors for making this program possible\\", airing at the beginning or end of a program. While radio had the obvious limitation of being restricted to sound, as the industry developed, large stations began to experiment with different formats. Advertising had become a hot commodity and there was money to be made. E. H. Sanders, advertising director at Shell Oil Co., urged radio broadcasters to deal directly with relevant advertisers, and sell tie-in commercial spots for established radio programs. Like newspaper ads at the time, Sanders figured that advertisers and radio would both benefit from selling ad spots to get the attention of listeners. Radio was an already prominent medium, but Sanders referred to his initiative as radio 'growing up' in terms of its business aspects and how it dealt with advertising.\\"Let Stations Build Programs, Sell Tie-ins\\" by E. H. Sanders. The \\"visual\\" portion of the broadcast was supplied by the listener's boundless imagination.Comedian and voice actor Stan Freberg demonstrated this point on his radio show in 1957,\\"A Lake of Hot Chocolate: Stan Freberg Shows the Way\\" by Harvey Jerkwater, April 20, 2005 (filingcabinetofthedamned.blogspot.com) using sound effects to dramatize the towing of a 10-ton maraschino cherry by the Royal Canadian Air Force, who dropped it onto a 700-ft. mountain of whipped cream floating in hot-chocolate filled Lake Michigan, to the cheering of 25,000 extras.\\"The Tip of the Freberg: The Stan Freberg Collection 1951-1998\\" by Stan Freberg. The bit was later used by the USA's Radio Advertising Bureau to promote radio commercials. The radio industry has changed significantly over time, and radio is big business today. Although other media and new technologies now place more demands on consumer's time, 95% of people still listen to the radio every week.\\"Keeping DJ Endorsements Alive\\" by Berry Berman, Media Week, March 17, 2008. U.S. Internet radio listening is also growing rapidly, rising from 12% in 2002 to over 50% in 2015.\\"Monthly Online Radio Listeners Now Exceed Half The Population 12+\\" by Edison Research, February 26, 2015. (edisonresearch.com) Although consumers have more choices today, a 2009 study reported that 92% of listeners stay tuned in when commercials break into their programming.\\"Radio Listeners Stay Tuned During Commercials 92%\\" (arbitron.com)  Formats  There is a broad range of choices for type and length of radio commercials. With changes in the radio industry and better production technologies, the mode of commercial presentation has changed, and commercial advertisements can take on a wide range of forms. The two primary types of radio ads are \\"live reads\\" and produced spots. Cousin to the ad-libbed commercial, live read refers to when a DJ reads an advertiser's spot on the air, delivered from a script, fact sheet or personal knowledge. It can also refer to when the DJ \\"endorses\\" the advertiser's goods or services. The Radio Advertising Bureau (RAB) defines an endorsement as: \\"where the station or personality \\"endorses\\" the advertiser's product or service, usually \\"live\\" on-air.\\"\\"Universal Spot Radio Buying and Selling Terms and Network Radio Terms Addendum\\" by the AAAA and The Radio Advertising Bureau (RAB.com) Produced spots appear to be more common. A spot is 'produced' if the radio station or an advertising agency record it for the client.\\"How Radio Ads Are Produced\\" by Kathy J. Kobliski, March 18, 2005. (entrepreneur.com) Produced commercial formats include: straight read with sound effects or background music, dialogue, monologue (where the voice talent portrays a character, as opposed to an announcer), jingles, and combinations of these.\\"Choosing a Radio Ad Format\\" by Gary Dahl (dummies.com) Studies show that the quality of the commercials is as important to listeners, generally, as the number of ads they hear.\\"Spot Load Study 2005: Managing Radio Commercial Inventories for Advertisers and Listeners\\" by Bill Rose and Joe Lenski and Joe Lenski (arbitron.com)  Research and rates  Radio stations today generally run their advertising in clusters or sets, scattered throughout the broadcasting hour. Studies show that the first or second commercial to air during a commercial break has higher recall than those airing later in the set.\\"Comparative Effectiveness of 30- versus 60-Second Radio Commercials on Recall and Rate\\" by David Allen, Journal of Radio Studies, November 2007, pages 165-177. Nielsen Audio is one of the primary providers of ratings data in the United States. Most radio stations and advertising agencies subscribe to this paid service, because ratings are key in the broadcast industry. Ad agencies generally purchase radio based on a target demographic. For example, their client may want to reach men between 18 and 49 years old. The ratings enable advertisers to select a specific segment of the listening audience and purchase airtime accordingly. Ratings are also referred to as \\"numbers\\" in the business. The numbers can show who is listening to a particular station, the most popular times of day for listeners in that group, and the percentage of the total listening audience that can be reached with a particular schedule of advertisements. The numbers also show exactly how many people are listening at each hour of the day. This allows an advertiser to select the strongest stations in the market with specificity and tells them what times of day will be the best times to run their ads. Besides the basic numbers, most radio stations have access to other data, such as Scarborough Research, that details more about the listening audience than just what age group they fall into. For example, some data will provide the types of activities listeners participate in, their ethnicity, what type of employment they do, their income levels, what kinds of cars they drive, and even whether or not they have been to a particular entertainment venue. Radio stations sell their airtime according to dayparts. Typically, a station's daypart lineup will look something like the following: 6am-10am, 10am-3pm, 3pm-7pm, and 7pm- midnight.\\"The Secrets to Effective Radio Advertising\\" (businesstown.com) The spots running after midnight, from 12am-6am, are referred to as \\"overnights\\". Though this schedule of dayparts can vary from station to station, most stations run similar daypart lineups and sell their advertisements accordingly. Drive times, or morning and evenings when people are commuting, are usually the most popular times of day and also when each station has the most listeners. The \\"rates\\", or what the station charges the advertiser, will reflect that. Rates can also be affected by the time of year an advertiser runs. January is almost always a very slow time of year, and many stations run specials on their rates during that month. This is not the case in warm weather markets like Florida, where \\"snow birds\\" migrate and increase population. In this situation rates are usually at their highest as the population swells. The cost of radio advertising also varies on how well the parties negotiate. During busier times of the year, stations can actually sell out of ads entirely, because, unlike the print media, radio stations only have a limited number of commercial units available per hour.\\"A Communication Guide\\" by AAAA/RAB Joint Radio Buying Guidelines Taskforce, second edition, December 2003 (rab.com) During the dot-com boom, some stations ran as much as twenty minutes of ads per hour.\\"Radio Killed the Radio Star\\" by Richard Fusco, October 6, 2005 (madisonavenuejournal.com) While commercial levels are nowhere near as high today, with the average station running approximately nine minutes of ads per hour,\\"Busting the Myth of Ad-cluttered Radio\\" by Diego Vasquez, Media Life, November 17, 2006. peak periods can and do sell out. Thus, advertising rates will vary depending on time of year, time of day, how well the station does in the particular demographic an advertiser is trying to reach, how well a station does compared to other stations, and demand on station inventory. The busier the time of year for the station, the more an advertiser can expect to spend. And, the higher ranked a station is in the market, according to the ratings data, the more an advertiser can expect to get charged to run on that station. Advertising rates can vary depending on the length of spot the advertisers elects to run. Although sixty second spots are the most common, stations also sell airtime in thirty, fifteen, ten and two second intervals.\\"Radio Ads: How Long Should They Be?\\" by Roy Williams, September 13, 2004 (entrepreneur.com) Thirty-second ads have always been popular in television advertising, but radio stations just adopted this format recently. Clear Channel kicked off the \\"Less is More\\" initiative in 2004, utilizing thirty-second commercials in markets across the US. Though studies show that fewer commercials cause better recall rates,\\"Clear Channel: Ad Cuts a Success\\" by David B. Wilkerson, Marketwatch, February 9, 2005. research indicates that traditional sixty-second spots may be the better option, with higher brand and message recall than the newer thirty-second ads. Stations also run ten-second spots, or \\"billboards\\". Typically, this type of spot runs adjacent to some station feature, such as the traffic report, stating, \\"This traffic brought to you by‚Ä¶\\", and is usually limited to about thirty words. Fifteen-second spots are generally reserved for station promotional announcements, although some stations sell them. In addition to traditional radio advertising, some stations are selling airtime during their streaming broadcasts.\\"Online Radio Gets a New Hook for Revenue\\" by Jos√© Alvear, September 25, 2000. (streamingmedia.com) In the past, the radio station stream included only the commercials that were also running on air. CBS announced it would begin airing 'live reads' in its streaming radio broadcasts, sold and voiced separately from the stations' regular spots, noting the efficacy of live endorsements.  Efficacy  More than eight out of ten Americans feel listening to commercials in exchange for free radio is a \\"fair deal\\". Furthermore, broadcast radio advertising often offers the advantage of being localized and inexpensive in comparison with other mediums such as television.\\"Radio Advertising in Today's World\\" by Karen Swager, March 3, 2014 (mediagaragegroup.com) Thus, radio advertising can be an effective, low-cost medium through which a business can reach their target consumer. Studies show that radio ads create emotional reactions in listeners. In turn, consumers perceive the ads as more relevant to them personally, which can lead to increased market awareness and sales for businesses running ad schedules. Twenty-five percent of listeners say they're more interested in a product or business when they hear about it on their preferred station. Local DJs create a personal relationship with their listening audience, and that audience is more likely to trust what they say and respond to their message.\\"Radio Endorsements-Credibility for Sale?\\" by Linda Thomas, May 8, 2009. Live endorsements are growing in popularity, as advertisers seek new means to reach consumers and cut through the surrounding clutter.Smith, Erika, \\"DJ Endorsements on Indy Stations Move Into Heavy Rotation\\", January 25, 2009, Indy.com Studies show that live reads have recall and response rates higher than the typical recorded spot. Perhaps because of the relationship listeners develop with their favorite station, twenty-six percent of listeners are more interested in a product or business when a DJ endorses it. As more advertisers turn to live endorsements, heavy demand is placed on DJs to announce them. And, as the number of available DJs shrinks, those that are left are often inundated with requests to do endorsements.  Regulatory considerations  The Communications Act of 1934 established the FCC, which, in turn, regulates the broadcasting media.\\"Telecommunications Act of 1996\\" (FCC.gov) In response to the payola scandal of the 1950s, the FCC established guidelines, known as \\"sponsorship disclosure\\" rules.\\"Payola and Sponsorship Identification - SPONSID\\" (FCC.gov) These rules apply to both pay-for-play and advertisements alike, recognizing that consumers deserve to know \\"by whom they are being persuaded\\".\\"73.1212 Sponsorship identification; list retention; related requirements\\" Public Information Collection Requirements Submitted to Office of Management and Budget for Review: OMB Approval No.: 3060-0174 (FCC.gov) Of particular importance to advertisers is Section 317 of the Act, the \\"Announcement of Payment For Broadcast\\" provision. It states, in general terms, that where money, services or other valuables are directly or indirectly paid to a radio station in exchange for mentions on the air, the station must disclose that fact. For example, if a cell phone provider gives a free cell phone to a station's DJ, who then talks about that cell-phone provider on the air, perhaps mentioning what great service he has, the announcer must disclose that it is an advertisement. Usually, listeners are able to discern radio advertisements from entertainment content. The Communications Act does include an \\"obviousness\\" exception: where it is obvious that something is a commercial, the announcement-for-payment provision does not apply. However, where anything of value has changed hands in exchange for mentions on the air, a station has a duty to disclose it. The Federal Trade Commission is also responsible for broadcast industry regulation, in terms of false or misleading advertising practices.\\"The Public and Broadcasting\\" (July 2008 edition) (FCC.gov) In October 2009, the FTC published guidelines regarding endorsements, requiring clear disclosure of the connection between an advertiser and an endorser. Under the FTC guidelines, an endorser is responsible for disclosing any \\"material connections\\" they have with a seller/business.\\"Advertisement Endorsements\\" (FTC.gov) In recent years, there has been a trend toward the blurring of entertainment/editorial and advertising content. Marketers are \\"embedding\\" products into the media so that consumers are not aware they are being advertised to.

To date, he is the last Democrat to have represented Wyoming in the House of Representatives. During the 1950s and 1960s, Roncalio served in multiple positions within the Wyoming Democratic Party. He was elected to the House of Representatives in 1964, and served until he unsuccessfully ran for the United States Senate in 1966. Roncalio was elected to the House of Representatives in 1970, and served until he announced that he would not seek reelection in 1978. Roncalio held positions in environmental committees during John F. Kennedy's administration and in the 1980s. During his tenure in the House of Representatives, he supported multiple environmental bills and was a staunch opponent of American involvement in the Vietnam War. After leaving the House of Representatives he remained active in politics and helped some of the remaining successful campaigns of the Wyoming Democratic Party before his death. Early life Celeste Domenico Roncaglio was born on March 23, 1916, in Rock Springs, Wyoming, to Frank and Ernesta Roncalio, Italians who had immigrated to the United States in 1903. His family later removed the G in their last name; he was known by the diminutive \\"Celestino\\", so was given the nickname \\"Tino\\" as a child, which later became Teno. In 1933, he earned his barber's license and after high school he worked as a reporter for the Rock Springs Rocket-Miner. He enlisted into the army following Pearl Harbor and during World War II he fought at the Battle of Gela and was later awarded a Silver Star for gallantry in the Normandy invasion on Omaha Beach. In 1945, he was discharged from the army with the rank of captain.}} In 1940, he started editing the Wyoming Collegiate features which were published by the Casper Tribune-Herald newspaper. While in college, he was elected as president of the student body, joined the Young Democrats, and Senator Joseph C. O'Mahoney offered him a job in Washington, D.C. In 1947, he graduated from the University of Wyoming with a law degree. Career=Politics In 1950, he began working as editor of the Wyoming Labor Journal. He served as the prosecuting attorney for Laramie County from 1950 to 1956. In 1957, he was elected as chairman of the Wyoming Democratic Party. Later that year Governor Milward Simpson proposed a civil rights bill that Roncalio had drafted after seeing a black couple being removed from a restaurant. He also served as a delegate to the 1956, 1960, 1964, and 1968 Democratic National Conventions. In 1958, it was speculated that he might be a possible Attorney General appointee, but on December 3, 1958, he stated that he did not want to be appointed to the office. As Chairman of the Wyoming delegation to the 1960 Convention, he cast the fifteen votes which gave John F. Kennedy the minimum amount needed to win the Democratic presidential nomination. Following Senator-elect Edwin Keith Thomson's death Kennedy asked Governor John J. Hickey to appoint Roncalio to fill the Senate vacancy, but he chose to instead appoint himself. Kennedy later appointed him as chairman of the International Joint Commission on Water Rights between the United States and Canada in 1961 and served until 1964. House of Representatives1965‚Äì1967= On April 28, 1964, he announced that he would run for the Democratic nomination for Wyoming's at- large congressional seat and in the general election he narrowly defeated incumbent Representative William Henry Harrison with the coattail effect of President Lyndon B. Johnson's victory in Wyoming during the presidential election helping him. Upon taking office he praised President Johnson for his state of the union speech and called it the \\"20th century restatement of the constitutional principles on which this nation is founded\\". During the 89th session he served on the Interior and Veterans Affairs committees. On June 15, 1966, he formally announced that he would run for Senate instead of seeking reelection, but was defeated in the general election by Governor Clifford P. Hansen. =Interlude= Snake River Canyon After losing the Senate election Roncalio filed multiple affidavits for land claims around the Snake River and it was publicly revealed in 1972 that his land claims were estimated to hold $7 billion worth of gold. In 1967, he was asked to run for the House again in the 1968 election, but chose not to. During the 1968 Democratic presidential primaries he supported Senator Robert F. Kennedy and was a member of his staff. When Roncalio heard about Robert Kennedy's assassination he stated that \\"I can't think of anything appropriate newsworthy or decent to say\\". After Kennedy's death he supported the anti-Humphrey movement at the national convention. In April 1969, William A. Norris Jr., Wyoming's Democratic national committeeman, announced that he would resign and on May 5, 1969, Roncalio was selected to replace him by acclamation after Joe Stewart, the only other candidate, withdrew two days before. =1971‚Äì1978= In 1969, he stated that he would not run against incumbent Senator Gale W. McGee in the Democratic primary and stated that he would either run for governor or house. On June 23, 1970, he announced that he would seek the Democratic nomination for Wyoming's at-large House seat. In the primary he easily defeated state representative and future governor Edgar Herschler and in the general election narrowly defeated Harry Roberts by 608 votes. Although he did not endorse him, Roncalio stated that Senator Edmund Muskie was the most balanced candidate during the 1972 Democratic presidential primaries, but later voted for George McGovern at the national convention in Miami Beach, Florida. Roncalio stated throughout 1971 that he would not run against Clifford P. Hansen for Senate again and on July 20, 1972, he filed to run for reelection and was reelected by a similar margin in the general election against Bill Kidd. On June 28, 1974, he announced that he would seek another term and defeated state senator Thomas F. Stroock by over 12,000 votes. In 1976, he won reelection against Larry J. Hart by almost 20,000 votes. During the Watergate investigation he remained uncommitted until after the \\"smoking gun\\" tape was released and supported his impeachment. He stated that an impeachment trial should happen after a new vice president was confirmed after Spiro Agnew's resignation and in 1973 he voted in favor of House Minority Leader Gerald Ford's appointment as vice president. Following Nixon's resignation and Ford's accession to the presidency Roncalio voted in favor of Nelson Rockefeller's appointment as vice president. On September 17, 1977, he announced that he would not run for reelection while at a University of Wyoming football game and stated that he would not run for governor giving his support to former state representative Edgar Herschler. In the 1978 election former White House Chief of Staff Dick Cheney easily won to succeed Roncalio and Roncalio resigned early on December 30, 1978. Later life He returned to Wyoming, where he served as Special Master in Wyoming's Big Horn adjudication of Indian Water Rights until 1982. In 1980, he endorsed Jim Rogers' house campaign, but he was defeated in a landslide by Dick Cheney and in 1982, he endorsed Rodger McDaniel's unsuccessful Senate campaign. In 1986, his wife served as co-chair of Kathy Karpan's Secretary of State campaign and in 1990, he donated $1,000 to Pete Maxfield's unsuccessful House campaign against Craig L. Thomas. In 1980, he explored for gold around Snake River in Teton county. In 2002, the post office in Rock Springs, Wyoming was named in his honor. On March 30, 2003, Roncalio died of congestive heart failure at the Life Care Center in Cheyenne, Wyoming and was buried in Mount Olivet Cemetery. Governor Dave Freudenthal, former Governor Mike Sullivan, Senator Craig L. Thomas, State Chief Justice William U. Hill, former Secretary of State Kathy Karpan, and other Wyoming political figures attended his funeral and a letter from Senator Ted Kennedy was read at it. Political positions=Domestic In 1965, he introduced legislation to extend the National Wool Act of 1954 through December 1972 in the House alongside Senator Gale McGee who introduced it in the Senate. In 1965, he introduced a bill that would have repealed Section 14B of the Taft‚ÄìHartley Act that prevents unions from negotiating contracts or legally binding documents requiring companies to fire workers who refuse to join the union, but it failed. In 1966, he proposed that every window on commercial airplanes should be turned into emergency exits and attempted to have the Federal Aviation Agency support his idea, but he was unsuccessful. In July 1974, he voted for an amendment that would prevent the use of federal funds for abortions, but it was defeated with two hundred forty seven against and one hundred twenty three in favor. =Amendments= In 1966, President Lyndon B. Johnson suggested during his state of the union address that Congress should pass a constitutional amendment giving members of the House of Representatives four- year terms instead of the current two years and Roncalio supported the idea, but the constitutional amendment was unsuccessful. In 1966, he introduced a resolution calling for the support of a constitutional amendment to lower the voting age. Although the resolution did not lead to a constitutional amendment Roncalio would later support the 26th amendment when he returned to the House of Representatives in 1971. =Environmental= In 1965, he started efforts to have the Agate Fossil Beds established as a protected landscape. The fossil beds were authorized as a national monument by Congress in 1965, but would not be officially established until June 14, 1997. In 1972, he helped in the establishment of Fossil Butte National Monument as a protected landscape. In 1973, he successfully defeated efforts to use underground nuclear blasts to produce natural gas. Foreign In 1965, he supported a bill created by Representative Omar Burleson that would reduce the United States' importation of oil from 2,200,000 barrels by 375,000 barrels daily and increase domestic production of oil. In 1966, he supported an effort to remove funding for the House Un-American Activities Committee and created a resolution demanding that France pay back its $6 billion in war debts to the United States. =Vietnam War= On February 12, 1965, Roncalio stated that the United States should continue its intervention in Vietnam despite threats by China to intervene and on April 5, 1965, supported an appropriations bill for the funding of a new American Embassy in Saigon, South Vietnam to show that the United States would continue its involvement in the area. However, when he returned to the House of Representatives in the 1970s he was staunchly against the Vietnam War. In 1969, he criticized Richard Nixon's Peace with Honor plan as a \\"phony promise\\" and that the United States had failed in Vietnam and should withdraw its soldiers. On November 10, 1971, he voted for a budget amendment that would have halted all defense spending by November 15 stating that he would not vote for any defense spending until a Vietnam withdrawal date was set, but it was defeated with three hundred fifty six against. In February 1971, he was one of ninety nine to vote against a two-year extension to the draft, but it was passed with two hundred ninety three in favor.

In 1832, he enrolled at the √©cole polytechnique, the first Afro-descendent student to do so. Perrinon graduated in 1834 and chose to become a Marine Artillery Officer. He was promoted Captain in 1840, the same year he married Marguerite-Louise-Charlotte T√©l√®phe, another Martiniquaise of mixed descent. In 1842, he was sent to the Caribbean as officer in the French garrison on the isle of Guadeloupe. Perrinon was promoted Major and awarded the Legion of Honour in 1847. He was of anti-slavery sympathy, and in 1847, in a pamphlet he authored entitled \\"R√©sultats d'exp√©rience sur le travail des esclaves\\" (\\"The Slave-Labor Experience\\") describing events on the isle of Saint Martin, he argued that the work being performed by slaves at the time could just as well be performed by free people and at equal cost. A year later, he was appointed to the Commission for the Abolition of Slavery by Victor Schoelcher, Under-secretary of State of the Colonies in the new Republican Government, and was sent to Martinique as \\"Commissioner of Abolition\\", later becoming General Commissioner and holding that post from June to November 1848. In 1849, he was elected, along with Victor Schoelcher, deputy to the French National Assembly. The National Assembly was dissolved in the wake of Napol√©on III's coup d'√©tat of 2 December 1851. Perrinon then returned to the Caribbean to live on Saint Martin, where he was involved in operations in salt marshes. His refusal, in a letter of 18 April 1853, to take an oath of allegiance to Napol√©on III resulted in his expulsion from the military. Perrinon died in 1861 in Saint Martin.

The first major breakthrough was the synthetic production of oxytocin and vasopressin in 1961. With further growth and expansion, the headquarters moved to Copenhagen, Denmark, and subsequently to Switzerland. In October 2011, Ferring acquired Cytokine PharmaSciences Inc.https://www.vd.ch/toutes-les- actualites/communiques-de-presse/detail/communique/les-competences-en-matiere- fiscale-respectees-1541676046/ (CPSI) and its UK subsidiary Controlled Therapeutics (Scotland) Ltd., a global biopharmaceutical company with a particular focus in obstetrics. In August 2016, the company announced it would acquire the phase III sciatica candidate drug - Condoliase (SI-6603) from Seikagaku for approximately $95 million.http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news- highlights/ferring-acquires-sciatica-candidate-from-seikagaku-for-up- to-95m/81253141/ In April 2018, Ferring announced its acquisition of Rebiotix Inc. an innovative biotechnology company and pioneer in the field of the human microbiome.https://endpts.com/ferring-buys-up-phiii-microbiome-drug-with- acquisition-of-rebiotix/https://bioct.org/member/rebiotix-inc/ In November 2019, Ferring Pharmaceuticals and Blackstone Life Sciences announced the joint investment of over $570 million USD in an investigational novel gene therapy in late stage development for patients with high-grade, Bacillus Calmette- Gu√©rin (BCG) unresponsive, non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC).

According to an article published by Swiss newspaper, Le Temps, Frederik Paulsen accompanied on several occasions Swiss politicians to Russia such as Pascal Couchepin, Isabelle Chassot, Fran√ßois Longchamp, G√©raldine Savary and Pascal Broulis. The nature of these visits has been the object of criticism and interrogations by Swiss judicial authorities, who have launched investigations on Pascal Broulis and G√©raldine Savary. The magistrate wished to clear if these trips were perceived as a bribe in return for fiscal arrangements for Frederik Paulsen and his company, Ferring Pharmaceuticals. The year before, on 21 February 2008, Russian president Vladimir Putin awarded Frederik Paulsen with the Order of Friendship. Three other expedition members of Arktika 2007 were also awarded titles at the occasion. During the expedition, a Russian flag was planted on the ocean floor of the North Pole, which sparked up controversy.  Legal procedures against Ferring  In the past, Ferring has been accused of disclosing misleading information about several of its products (Desmopressin, Glypressin, Penstasa) at the benefit of consumers. In July 2020, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, based in the United Kingdom, drew attention to the fact that Ferring Pharmaceuticals is recalling all Desmopressin nasal sprays. In 2016, a class action was filled against Ferring Pharmaceuticals regarding the Bravelle product. One year earlier, the company recalled Bravelle products after tests revealed that the drug was not as effective as declared, therefore exposing women to serious health risks. Ferring Pharmaceuticals is currently engaged in a legal battle opposing it to Professor Claudio de Simone. In the early 1990s, Professor Claudio de Simone invented a probiotic formulation fighting against intestinal disorders. The \\"De Simone formula\\" was the subject of several clinical tests, attesting of its efficiency to treat certain diseases. The pharmaceutical company distributed the formula under the name VSL#3. A few years after the end of the agreement between the two parties, Ferring Pharmaceuticals continued to distribute a product referred to as \\"VSL#3\\" in several countries, containing a modified formula. Products Products are used in reproductive health, gastroenterology, urology, orthopaedics and endocrinology.https://pharmaboardroom.com/directory/ferring-austria/ Reproductive health / Fertility * Triptorelin, which Ferring markets as Gonapeptyl or Decapeptyl in some countries * Menopur/ Menogon/ Repronex is ovarian-stimulating treatment used in the preparation for in vitro fertilization; * Propess for the induction of labour; * Endometrin / Lutinus (progesterone) * Tractocile (atosiban), to delay premature labor * Pabal/ Duratocin/ Lonactene / Duratobal / (carbetocin) to prevent post-partum hemorrhage * Choragon / Brevactid (u-hCG) * Lutrepulse / Lutrelef (gonadorelin acetate) * Norprolac (quinagolide hydrochloride); * Rekovelle (follitropin delta); Gastroenterology * Pentasa for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease * Picoprep / Clenpiq * Cortiment / Budesonide is indicated in adults for induction of remission in patients with active mild-to-moderate active ulcerative colitis * Glypressin (terlipressin) is indicated for the treatment of bleeding oesophageal varices and in some countries for the treatment of hepato-renal syndrome type 1. * Picoprep / Clenpiq (sodium picosulphate, magnesium oxide, citric acid) is indicated to clean the bowel Urology * Degarelix, marketed under the brandname Firmagon is a prostate cancer Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone blocker therapy * Minirin for bedwetting in children and nocturia in adults; * Nocdurna (desmopressin) is indicated for the symptomatic treatment of nocturia * Testim (testosterone) is a testosterone replacement treatment Orthopaedics * Euflexxa for osteoarthritis of the knee Endocrinology * Zomacton, a recombinant human growth hormone used to treat growth failure in children  See also  * List of pharmaceutical companies * Pharmaceutical industry in Switzerland  References External links * Ferring Global Website Category:Pharmaceutical companies of Switzerland Category:Pharmaceutical companies of Sweden Category:Biotechnology companies of Switzerland Category:Multinational companies headquartered in Switzerland Category:Companies based in the canton of Vaud Category:Pharmaceutical companies established in 1950 Category:Companies based in Malm√∂ Category:Swedish companies established in 1950 ","title":"Ferring Pharmaceuticals"},{"id":"3571580","text":"Irene Temple Bailey (February 24, 1869 ‚Äì July 6, 1953) was a popular American novelist and short story writer.Clayton, Marion E.

They are characterized by depositional coastal environments, where fine sediments (often with high organic content) collect in areas protected from high-energy wave action. The saline conditions tolerated by various mangrove species range from brackish water, through pure seawater (3 to 4%), to water concentrated by evaporation to over twice the salinity of ocean seawater (up to 9%). Birds sanctuaries Mangrove swamps are home and sanctuaries for thousands of aquatic bird species, including: * Pulicat Lake Bird Sanctuary * Mangalavanam Bird Sanctuary * Salim Ali Bird Sanctuary * Pichavaram * Coringa Wildlife Sanctuary * Sundarbans National Park Natural coastal protection Mangrove swamps protect coastal areas from erosion, storm surge (especially during hurricanes), and tsunamis. The mangroves' massive root systems are efficient at dissipating wave energy. Likewise, they slow down tidal water enough so its sediment is deposited as the tide comes in, leaving all except fine particles when the tide ebbs. In this way, mangroves build their own environments. Because of the uniqueness of mangrove ecosystems and the protection against erosion they provide, they are often the object of conservation programs, including national biodiversity action plans. The protective value of mangrove swamps is sometimes overstated. Wave energy is typically low in areas where mangroves grow,Baird, Andrew (26 December 2006) \\"False Hopes and Natural Disasters\\" New York Times editorial so their effect on erosion can only be measured over long periods. Their capacity to limit high-energy wave erosion is limited to events such as storm surges and tsunamis. Erosion often occurs on the outer sides of bends in river channels that wind through mangroves, while new stands of mangroves are appearing on the inner sides where sediment is accruing.

That is, it is the orbit that coincides with the current orbital state vectors (position and velocity). Etymology The word osculate is Latin for \\"kiss\\". In mathematics, two curves osculate when they just touch, without (necessarily) crossing, at a point, where both have the same position and slope, i.e. the two curves \\"kiss\\".  Kepler elements  An osculating orbit and the object's position upon it can be fully described by the six standard Kepler orbital elements (osculating elements), which are easy to calculate as long as one knows the object's position and velocity relative to the central body. The osculating elements would remain constant in the absence of perturbations. Real astronomical orbits experience perturbations that cause the osculating elements to evolve, sometimes very quickly. In cases where general celestial mechanical analyses of the motion have been carried out (as they have been for the major planets, the Moon, and other planetary satellites), the orbit can be described by a set of mean elements with secular and periodic terms. In the case of minor planets, a system of proper orbital elements has been devised to enable representation of the most important aspects of their orbits.  Perturbations  Perturbations that cause an object's osculating orbit to change can arise from: * A non-spherical component to the central body (when the central body can be modeled neither with a point mass nor with a spherically symmetrical mass distribution, e.g. when it is an oblate spheroid). * A third body or multiple other bodies whose gravity perturbs the object's orbit, for example the effect of the Moon's gravity on objects orbiting Earth. * A relativistic correction. * A non- gravitational force acting on the body, for example force arising from: ** Thrust from a rocket engine ** Releasing, leaking, venting or ablation of a material ** Collisions with other objects ** Atmospheric drag ** Radiation pressure ** Solar wind pressure ** Switch to a non-inertial reference frame (e.g. when a satellite's orbit is described in a reference frame associated with the precessing equator of the planet).  Parameters  An object's orbital parameters will be different if they are expressed with respect to a non-inertial reference frame (for example, a frame co-precessing with the primary's equator), than if it is expressed with respect to a (non-rotating) inertial reference frame. Put in more general terms, a perturbed trajectory can be analysed as if assembled of points, each of which is contributed by a curve out of a sequence of curves. Variables parameterising the curves within this family can be called orbital elements. Typically (though not necessarily), these curves are chosen as Keplerian conics, all of which share one focus. In most situations, it is convenient to set each of these curves tangent to the trajectory at the point of intersection. Curves that obey this condition (and also the further condition that they have the same curvature at the point of tangency as would be produced by the object's gravity towards the central body in the absence of perturbing forces) are called osculating, while the variables parameterising these curves are called osculating elements. In some situations, description of orbital motion can be simplified and approximated by choosing orbital elements that are not osculating. Also, in some situations, the standard (Lagrange-type or Delaunay-type) equations furnish orbital elements that turn out to be non-osculating.For details see: ; See also * Kepler orbit * Eccentricity vector * Orbital elements * Contact (mathematics) * Osculating circle * List of orbits References External links  * Diagram of a sequence of osculating orbits for the escape from Earth orbit by the ion-driven SMART-1 spacecraft: http://sci.esa.int/science-e/www/object/index.cfm?fobjectid=35722 * A sequence of osculating orbits for the approach to the Moon by the SMART-1 spacecraft: http://sci.esa.int/science-e/www/object/index.cfm?fobjectid=36359 ; Videos  * * Category:Astrodynamics Category:Orbital perturbations ","title":"Osculating orbit"},{"id":"3571606","text":"Talmadge L.

The programme was shown during the early hours of the mornings, and ran for two series between 2002 and 2004, each with thirteen 30 minute episodes. The show gained a cult following amongst students and insomniacs. It largely consisted of dada-inspired comedy sketches, interspersed with periods of hypnotic visuals. During these hypnotic visuals, its much-used catchphrase was often recited: \\"Fly like a mouse, run like a cushion, be the small bookcase\\". It was written and directed by Tim de Jongh (aka Tim Scott), who also acted in the show. Tim Firth and Michael Marshall Smith who both co-wrote some of the material were better known (along with Tim de Jongh) for their work on the BBC Radio 4 show, And Now In Colour. Tim Scott won a BAFTA in 2003 for co-writing and directing the children's show Ripley and Scuff. Dare To Believe was commissioned and then re-commissioned by David Liddament. The show was abandoned upon Liddament's exit from ITV. The show notably contained voice- over work and appearances by the late Patrick Allen. Characters Popular characters included The Aguamoose Man, the Twarb Coffee Woman and a lady who presented a weather style mini-programme that gave warnings on the size of elks to be expected in various parts of the UK that evening.

It is located on high left bank of the Klyazma River about from its source, from Mendeleyevo, and about from Zelenograd. Etymology The name \\"Lyalovo\\" supposedly originates from an Old Slavonic or a Uralic word lyalo (), which means a body of a boat upturned, or a shape similar to such body. The hill on which the village is located resembles this shape. History Lyalovo is believed to be one of the most ancient populated places in Moscow Oblast. Several settlements were discovered near this village, with the oldest of them dating back as far as four thousand years. Morozovka country estate, currently transformed into a VIP rest home, is located in Lyalovo. This country estate has been in the hands of many well known Russian owners. In the 1800s, it was owned by the Romodanovsky and Princes Beloselsky-Belozersky. (Prince Esper Alexandrovich Belosselsky- Belozersky is buried in the church at Lyalovo having succumbed to typhoid fever in 1846, which was epidemic during that year. He contracted the fever while inspecting the newly built Petersburg-Moscow railroad, for which he was the chief of police). Before the Russian Revolution, the estate belonged to the famous family of Morozovs‚Äîone of the richest Russian merchant families. A Church of the Nativity of the Theotokos is also located in Lyalovo. Many of the former estate owners' family members are buried in the church krypt and grounds. During the Soviet times, the estate was a \\"Sanatorium\\" as part of the \\"ZIK\\" complex of the party machine. Since 1992, Gazprom is the proprietor. Coat of arms The current coat of arms of Lyalovo was established in 1989. It shows a picture of a sheaf, symbolizing one of the first rural picture galleries in Russia that was established there, on a red background symbolizing the Battle of Moscow. The blue waves in the bottom signify the river Klyazma and the stone axe symbolizes the Neolithic settlements found there.

Generally accepted as a groundbreaking biography, the book places Emma Smith into a context that has better explained the trials and sacrifices of the members of the early Latter Day Saint church. The work made possible, along with other more recent historical works, a major reinterpretation of the formative period of Mormonism. The book won the 1984 Best Book Award for interpretive history by the Mormon History Association. Avery and Newell provided the following note in the book's introduction: Early leaders in Utah castigated Emma from their pulpits for opposing Brigham Young and the practice of polygamy, and for lending support to the Reorganization. As these attitudes filtered down through the years, Emma was virtually written out of official Utah histories. In this biography, we have attempted to reconstruct the full story of this remarkable and much misunderstood woman's experiences. Despite its quality and recognition, the biography was startling and controversial among leaders, administrators and members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Shortly after publication, Avery and Newell, both participating members in the church, were refused any opportunity to talk about their research or book in church meetings.http://religionnews.com/2013/04/23/the-reinvention-of-mormon-emma- smith/ In the preface to the second edition of the book, the authors wrote: ¬´After a ten-months stalemate Linda Newell successfully petitioned church leaders to reconsider the prohibition.

These same three officials also made up the Capitol Police Board. Key Guide Service personnel included the Director, four Assistant Directors, as well as many regular guides. Personnel of the Capitol Guide Service could also be transferred to the United States Capitol Police force at the discretion of the Capitol Guide Board to provide ushering and informational services, and other services not directly involving law enforcement. This sometimes happened during major events, such as presidential inaugurations and Lying in State ceremonies. South Visitor Facility The Capitol Guides operated out of facilities located on the south side of the United States Capitol. Visitors were processed through the South Visitor Facility which included security screening and then directed into the Capitol, itself, via a walk around the west front of the building to enter through a west terrace door. Behind the South Visitor Facility was a trailer, which served as the temporary rest area and locker facility for the guides. Upon the opening of the Capitol Visitor Center (CVC) on December 2, 2008, both buildings were removed and all guide-related operations as well as the guides themselves were transferred to the jurisdiction and oversight of the Architect of the Capitol, specifically the Visitor Services Division of the Capitol Visitor Center.

The full dress uniform was notable for its striking red blazer with a circular patch on the left breast. It was accompanied by a white shirt, navy blue tie, and navy blue pants. It could be accompanied by a navy blue vest. It was required for ceremonies and other formal occasions, as well as cold weather.

The summer uniform was generally not worn until temperatures were above 70 degrees Fahrenheit. Category:1876 establishments in Washington, D.C. Guide Service Capitol Guide Service Category:2008 disestablishments in Washington, D.C. ","title":"United States Capitol Guide Service"},{"id":"3571761","text":"In chess, the fortress is an endgame drawing technique in which the side behind in sets up a zone of protection that the opponent cannot penetrate. This might involve keeping the enemy king out of one's position, or a zone the enemy cannot force one out of (e.g. see the opposite-colored bishops example). An elementary fortress is a theoretically drawn (i.e. a ) position with reduced material in which a passive defense will maintain the draw. Fortresses commonly have four characteristics: # Useful pawn are not possible. # If the stronger side has pawns, they are firmly blocked. # The stronger side's king cannot penetrate, either because it is cut off or near the edge of the board. #Zugzwang positions cannot be forced, because the defender has available . Fortresses pose a problem for computer chess: computers fail to recognize fortress-type positions and are unable to achieve the win against them despite claiming a winning advantage . Fortress in a corner Perhaps the most common type of fortress, often seen in endgames with only a few pieces on the board, is where the defending king is able to take refuge in a corner of the board and cannot be chased away or checkmated by the superior side. These two diagrams furnish two classic examples. In both cases, Black simply shuffles his king between a8 and the available square adjacent to a8 (a7, b7, or b8, depending on the position of the white king and pawn). White has no way to dislodge Black's king, and can do no better than a draw by stalemate or some other means. Note that the bishop and wrong rook pawn ending (i.e. where the pawn is a rook pawn whose promotion square is the color opposite to that of the bishop) in the diagram is a draw even if the pawn is on the seventh rank or further back on the a-. Heading for a bishop and wrong rook pawn ending is a fairly common drawing resource available to the inferior side . The knight and rook pawn position in the diagram, however, is a draw only if White's pawn is already on the seventh rank, making this drawing resource available to the defender much less frequently. White wins if the pawn is not yet on the seventh rank and is protected by the knight from behind. With the pawn on the seventh rank, Black has a stalemate defense with his king in the corner . Example game: Serper vs. Nakamura, 2004 A fortress is often achieved by a sacrifice, such as of a piece for a pawn. In the game between Grigory Serper and Hikaru Nakamura,Serper vs. Nakamura 2004 in the 2004 U.S. Chess Championship, White would lose after 1.Nd1 Kc4 or 1.Nh1 Be5 or 1.Ng4 Bg7. Instead he played :1. Nxe4! Kxe4 :2. Kf1! Heading for h1. After another 10 moves the position in the following diagram was reached: Black has no way of forcing White's king away from the corner, so he played :12... Kf2 and after 13.h4 gxh4 the game was drawn by stalemate. Back-rank defense The back- rank defense in some rook and pawn versus rook endgames is another type of fortress in a corner (see diagram). The defender perches his king on the pawn's queening square, and keeps his rook on the back rank (on the \\"long side\\" of the king, not, e.g., on h8 in the diagram position) to guard against horizontal checks. If 1.Rg7+ in the diagram position, Black heads into the corner with 1...Kh8! Note that this defense works only against rook pawns and knight pawns . Rook vs. bishop In the ending of a rook versus a bishop, the defender can form a fortress in the \\"safe\\" corner‚Äîthe corner that is not of the color on which the bishop resides (see diagram). White must release the potential stalemate, but he cannot improve his position . :1. Rc3 Ba2 :2. Rc2 Bb3 :3. Rc7 Bg8 Pawn and bishop In this position from de la Villa, White draws if his king does not leave the corner. It is also a draw if the bishop is on the other color, so it is not a case of the wrong bishop . Rook and pawn versus queen In the diagram, Black draws by moving his rook back and forth between the d6- and f6-squares, or moves his king when checked, staying behind the rook and next to the pawn. This fortress works when all of these conditions are met: *the pawn is still on its second *the pawn is on b through g *the pawn is protecting its rook on the third rank *the opposing king is beyond the defender's third rank *the defending king protects its pawn . The white king is not able to cross the rank of the black rook and the white queen is unable to do anything useful. : 1. Qd5+ Rd6 : 2. Qb5+ Kd8 : 3. Qb8+ Kd7 : 4. Qb5+ ¬Ω-¬Ω Positions such as these (when the defending rook and king are near the pawn and the opposing king cannot attack from behind) are drawn when (see diagram): * the pawn is on the c-, d-, e-, or f-file and the second, sixth, or seventh rank * the pawn is anywhere on the b- or g-file * the pawn is on the a- or h-file and the third or seventh rank. Otherwise, the queen wins . Example from game In this position, with Black to move, Black can reach a drawing fortress. : 1...b4 : 2. Kd6 Rc3 : 3. Kd7 and now 3...Ka3 and several other moves reach the fortress. In the actual game, Black made the weak move 3...Rd3? and lost . Similar example In this 1959 game between Whitaker and Ferriz, White sacrificed a rook for a knight in order to exchange a pair of pawns and reach this position, and announced that it was a draw because (1) the queen cannot mate alone, and (2) the black king and pawn cannot approach to help . However, endgame tablebase analysis shows Black to have a forced win in 19 moves starting with 50... Qc7+ (the only winning move), taking advantage of the fact that the rook is currently unprotected ‚Äì again illustrating how tablebases are refining traditional endgame theory. Example with more pawns From the diagram, in Salov vs. Korchnoi, Wijk aan Zee 1997,Salov vs. Korchnoi White was able to hold a draw with a rook versus a queen, even with the sides having an equal number of pawns. He kept his rook on the fifth rank blocking in Black's king, and was careful not to lose his rook to a fork or allow a queen sacrifice for the rook in circumstances where that would win for Black. The players agreed to a draw after: :48. Kg2 Kg6 49. Rh5 Qe2+ 50. Kg3 Qf1 51. Kf4 Qe1 52. Rd5 Qc1+ 53. Kg3 Qc7+ 54. Kg2 Qf4 55. Rh5 Kf6 56. Rd5 Ke6 57. Rh5 Qd2+ 58. Kg3 f6 59. Rf5 Qc1 60. Rh5 Qg1+ 61. Kf4 Qe1 62. Rb5 Qc1+ 63. Kg3 Qg1+ 64. Kf4 Qh2+ 65. Ke3 Kf7 66. Rh5 Qg1+ 67. Kf4 Kg6 68. Rd5 Qh2+ 69. Ke3 Kf7 70. Rh5 Qg1+ 71. Kf4 Ke6 72. Rb5 Qh2+ 73. Ke3 Kd6 74. Rf5 Qb2 75. Rh5 Ke6 76. Kf4 Qc3 77. Kg3 Qc7+ 78. Kg2 Qf7 79. Rb5 Qe8 80. Rf5 Qg6 81. Rb5 ¬Ω‚Äì¬Ω Opposite-colored bishops In endings with bishops of opposite colors (i.e. where one player has a bishop that moves on light squares, while the other player's bishop moves on dark squares), it is often possible to establish a fortress, and thus hold a draw, when one player is one, two, or occasionally even three pawns behind. A typical example is seen in the diagram. White, although three pawns behind, has established a drawing fortress, since Black has no way to contest White's stranglehold over the light squares. White simply keeps his bishop on the h3‚Äìc8 diagonal . Example from game In an endgame with opposite-colored bishops, positional factors may be more important than material. In this position, Black sacrifices a pawn (leaving him three pawns down) to reach a fortress. : 1... Kf5! : 2. Kxf7 Bh5+ : 3. Kg7 Bd1 : 4. Be7 ¬Ω-¬Ω After 4...Be2 5.Kh6 Bd1 6.h5 Black just waits by playing 6...Be2 . Queen versus two minor pieces Here are drawing fortresses with two versus a queen . Usually the defending side will not be able to get to one of these positions. Bishop and knight The bishop and knight fortress is another type of fortress in a corner. If necessary, the king can move to one of the squares adjacent to the corner, and the bishop can retreat to the corner. This gives the inferior side enough tempo moves to avoid zugzwang. For example: :1. Kb5 Ka7 :2. Qd8 Ba8 :3. Ka5 Bb7. Two bishops In the two bishop versus queen ending, the queen wins if the Lolli position is not reached, but some of them take up to seventy-one moves to either checkmate or win a bishop, so the fifty-move rule comes into play. From the diagram: :1. Qe7+ Kc8 :2. Qe6+ Kb7 :3. Qd6 Ba7 :4. Qe7+ Kb6! :5. Qd8+ Kb7! :6. Ka5 Bc5! and White cannot prevent ... Bb6, which gets back to the Lolli position . Two knights In the two knights fortress, the knights are next to each other and their king should be between them and the attacking king. The defender must play accurately, though . There are several drawing positions with two knights against a queen. The best way is to have the knights adjacent to each other on a file or rank, with their king between them and the enemy king. This is not a true fortress since it is not static. The position of the knights may have to change depending on the opponent's moves. In this position (Lolli, 1763), : 1. Qd1 Nd2+ : 2. Ke2 Nb3 and Black has an ideal defensive position. If the knights cannot be adjacent to each other on a file or rank, the second best position is if they are next to each other diagonally (see diagram). The third type of defensive formation is with the knights protecting each other, but this method is more risky . With pawns Sometimes the two minor pieces can achieve a fortress against a queen even where there are pawns on the board. In Ree-Hort, Wijk aan Zee 1986 Ree vs. Hort (first diagram), Black had the material disadvantage of rook and bishop against a queen. Dvoretsky writes that Black would probably lose after the natural 1...Bf2+? 2.Kxf2 Rxh4 because of 3.Kg3 Rh7 4.Kf3, followed by a king march to c6, or 3.Qg7!? Rxf4+ 4.Kg3 Rg4+ 5.Kf3, threatening 6.Qf6 or 6.Qc7 . Instead, Hort forced a draw with 1... Rxh4!! 2. Kxh4 Bd4! (imprisoning White's queen) 3. Kg3 Ke7 4.Kf3 Ba1 (second diagram), and the players agreed to a draw. White's queen has no moves, all of Black's pawns are protected, and his bishop will shuttle back and forth on the squares a1, b2, c3, and d4. Knight versus a rook and pawn At the great New York City 1924 tournament, former world champion Emanuel Lasker was in trouble against his namesake Edward Lasker, but surprised everyone by discovering a new endgame fortress .Em. Lasker vs. Ed. Lasker Despite having only a knight for a rook and pawn, White draws by moving his knight back and forth between b2 and a4. Black's only real winning try is to get his king to c2. However, to do so Black has to move his king so far from the pawn that White can play Ka3‚Äìb2 and Nc5xb3, when the rook versus knight ending is an easy draw. The game concluded: :93. Nb2 Ke4 94. Na4 Kd4 95. Nb2 Rf3 96. Na4 Re3 97. Nb2 Ke4 98. Na4 Kf3 99. Ka3! Ke4 If 99...Ke2, 100.Nc5 Kd2 101.Kb2! (101.Nxb3+?? Kc2 and Black wins) and 102.Nxb3 draws. :100. Kb4 Kd4 101. Nb2 Rh3 102. Na4 Kd3 103. Kxb3 Kd4+ ¬Ω‚Äì¬Ω Bishop versus rook and bishop pawn on the sixth rank A bishop can make a fortress versus a rook and a bishop pawn on the sixth rank, if the bishop is on the color of the pawn's seventh rank square and the defending king is in front of the pawn. In this position, White would win if he had gotten the king to the sixth rank ahead of the pawn. Black draws by keeping the bishop on the diagonal from a2 to e6, except when giving check. The bishop keeps the white king off e6 and checks him if he goes to g6, to drive him away. A possible continuation: :1... Ba2 2. Kf4 2.f7 is an interesting attempt, but then Black plays 2...Kg7! and then 3...Bxf7, with a draw. 2...Kg7 prevents 3.Kf6, which would win. :2... Bc4 3. Kg5 Bd5! The only move to draw, since the bishop must be able to check the king if it goes to g6. :4. Rc7 Ba2! 5. Kg6 Bb1+! 6. Kh6 Ba2! 7. Ra7 If 7.f7 Bxf7!: the pawn can be safely when the white king is on h6. :7... Bc4 Draw, because White cannot make progress . Defense perimeter (pawn fortress) A defense perimeter is a drawing technique in which the side behind in or otherwise at a disadvantage sets up a perimeter, largely or wholly composed of a pawn chain, that the opponent cannot penetrate. Unlike other forms of fortress, a defense perimeter can often be set up in the middlegame with several pieces remaining on the board. The position in the first diagram, a chess problem by W.E. Rudolph (La Strategie 1912), illustrates the defense perimeter. White already has a huge material disadvantage, but forces a draw by giving up his remaining pieces to establish an impenetrable defense perimeter with his pawns. White draws with 1. Ba4+! Kxa4 (1... Kc4 2. Bb3+! Kb5 3. c4+ Kc6 4. Ba4+!, forcing Rb5, wins for White) 2. b3+ Kb5 3. c4+ Kc6 4. d5+ Kd7 5. e6+! Kxd8 6. f5! (second diagram). Now Black is up two rooks and a bishop (normally an overwhelming material advantage) but has no hope of breaking through White's defense perimeter. The only winning attempts Black can make are to place his rooks on b5, c6, etc. and hope that White them. White draws by ignoring all such offers and simply shuffling his king about . The above example may seem fanciful, but Black achieved a similar defense perimeter in Arshak Petrosian‚ÄìHazai, Schilde 1970A. Petrosian vs. Hazai (first diagram). Black has a difficult endgame, since White can attack and win his a-pawn by force, and he has no counterplay. Black tried the extraordinary 45... Qb6!?, to which White replied with the obvious 46. Nxb6+? This is actually a critical mistake, enabling Black to establish an impenetrable fortress. White should have carried out his plan of winning Black's a-pawn, for example with 46.Qc1 (threatening 47.Nxb6+ cxb6 48.h4! gxh4 49.Qh1 and Qh3, winning) Qa7 47.Qd2 followed by Kb3, Nc3, Ka4, and Na2‚Äìc1‚Äìb3. 46... cxb6 Now Black threatens 47...h4, locking down the entire board with his pawns, so White tries to break the position open. 47. h4 gxh4 48. Qd2 h3! 49. gxh3 Otherwise 49...h2 draws. 49... h4! (second diagram) Black has established his fortress, and now can draw by simply moving his king around. The only way White could attempt to breach the fortress would be a queen sacrifice at some point (for example Qxa5 or Qxe5), but none of these give White winning chances as long as Black keeps his king near the center. The players shuffled their kings, and White's queen, around for six more moves before agreeing to a draw . In Smirin-HIARCS, Smirin-Computers match 2002,Smirin vs. HIARCS the super-grandmaster looked to be in trouble against the computer, which has the , can tie White's king down with ...g3, and threatens to invade with its king on the light squares. Smirin, however, saw that he could set up a fortress with his pawns. The game continued 46... g3 47. h3! A surprising move, giving Black a formidable protected passed pawn on the sixth rank, but it begins to build White's fortress, keeping Black's king out of g4. 47... Bc5 48. Bb4! Now Smirin gives HIARCS the choice between an opposite-colored bishops endgame (in which, moreover, White will play Be7 and win the h-pawn if Black's king comes to the center) and a bishop versus knight ending in which Smirin envisions a fortress. 48... Bxb4 49. axb4 Kf7 Black could try to prevent White's coming maneuver with 49...Bd3, but then White could play 50.Nf3 Kh5 (forced) 51.Nd4. 50. Nb5! Ke6 51. Nc3! Completing the fortress. Now Black's king has no way in, and his bishop can do nothing, since White's king can prevent ...Bf1, attacking White's only pawn on a light square. The game concluded: 51... Bc2 52. Kg2 Kd6 53. Kg1 Kc6 54. Kg2 b5 55. Kg1 Bd3 56. Kg2 Be4+ 57. Kg1 Bc2 58. Kg2 Bd3 59. Kg1 Be4 60. Kf1 ¬Ω‚Äì¬Ω Other examples Here are some other drawing fortresses . Fortresses against a bishopFortresses against a knightFortresses against a rook=A semi-fortress The endgame of two bishops versus a knight was thought to be a draw for more than one hundred years. It was known that the temporary defensive fortress in this position could be broken down after a number of moves, but it was assumed that the fortress could be reformed in another corner. Computer endgame tablebases show that the bishops generally win, but it takes up to 66 moves. It takes several moves to force Black out of the temporary fortress in the corner; then precise play with the bishops prevents Black from forming the fortress in another corner. The position in the diagram was thought to be a draw by Kling and Horwitz but computer analysis shows that White wins in 45 moves (either by checkmate or by winning the knight). All of the long wins in this endgame go through this type of semi-fortress position . This gamePint√©r vs. Bronstein between J√≥zsef Pint√©r and David Bronstein demonstrates the human play of the endgame. The defender has two ideas: (1) keep the king off the edge of the board and (2) keep the knight close to the king. White reaches the semi-fortress after 71. Nb2!, which falls after 75... Kb5!. White gets to a semi-fortress again in another corner after 90. Ng2+. After 100. Ke3 White cannot hold that semi-fortress any longer, but forms one in another corner after 112. Nb7!. On move 117 White claimed a draw by the fifty move rule . Positional draw A \\"positional draw\\" is a concept most commonly used in endgame studies and describes an impasse other than stalemate. It usually involves the repetition of moves in which neither side can make progress or safely deviate. Typically a advantage is balanced by a positional advantage. Fortresses and perpetual check are examples of positional draws . Sometimes they salvage a draw from a position that seems hopeless because of a material deficit . Grandmaster John Nunn describes a positional draw as a position in which one side has enough material to normally win and he is not under direct attack, but some special feature of the position (often a blockade) prevents him from winning . A simple example is shown in the game between Lajos Portisch and Lubomir Kavalek. White could have won easily with 1.Be1 Kc6 2.b4. However, play continued 1. b4? Nb8 2. b5 Nc6+! The only way to avoid the threatened 3...Nxa5 is 3.bxc6 Kxc6, but the resultant position is a draw because the bishop is on the wrong color to be able to force the promotion (see above, wrong bishop, and wrong rook pawn) . Ludƒõk Pachman cites the endgame position in the diagram as a simple example of a positional draw. White on move simply plays waiting moves with the bishop (Bb1‚Äìc2‚Äìd3). As for Black, \\"If he is unwilling to allow the transition to the drawn ending of Rook versus Bishop, nothing else remains for him but to move his Rook at [e5] continuously up and down the [e-file].\\" Pachman explains, \\"The indecisive result here contradicts the principles concerning the value of the pieces and is caused by the bad position of the black pieces (pinned rook at [e4]).\\" . This position from a game between Mikhail Botvinnik and Paul Keres in the 1951 USSR Championship is drawn because the black king cannot get free and the rook must stay on the c-. The players agreed to a draw four moves later . The first diagram shows a position from a game between former World Champion Mikhail Tal and future World Champion Bobby Fischer from the 1962 Candidates Tournament in Cura√ßao.Tal vs. Fischer 1962 After 41 moves Tal had the advantage but Fischer sacrificed the exchange (a rook for a knight). The game was drawn on the 58th move . In this position from a game between Pal Benko and International Master Jay Bonin, White realized that the blockade cannot be broken and the game is a draw despite the extra material . Can White stop the h-pawn from queening? The position looks lost for White but he does have a defence which seems to defy the rules of logic. White will calmly construct a \\"fortress\\" which will hide his pieces from attack. The only weakness in White's \\"fortress\\" is the g-pawn. This pawn has to be defended by the bishop and the only square where this can be done safely is from h6. 1\\\\. Bf6! White threatens to stop the advance of the h-pawn with ...Be5+; building the fortress immediately does not work: 1.f6? h2 2.Kf8 h1=Q 3.Kg7 (3.Kg8 Qg2 4.Bf8 Qa8 5.Kg7 Kd7 6.Kg8 Ke6 7.Kg7 Kf5 8.Kg8 Bb3 9.Kg7 Qh1‚àí+) 3...Kd7 4.Bb4 Ke6 5.Bd2 Kf5 6.Be3 Qf3 7.Bd2 Qe2 8.Bc1 Qd1 9.Be3 Qd3 10.Bc1 Qc3‚àí+; 1... Kd6 2. Be7+ 2.fxg6? This move destroys the fortress 2...fxg6 3.Be7+ Kc6‚àí+. Chess computer programs have difficulty assessing \\"fortress\\" positions because the normal values for the pieces do not apply. 2... Ke5 3. Bd8! White can draw in another way without the need of a \\"fortress\\": 3.fxg6 fxg6 4.Bd8 Kd6 5.Nf6! h2 6.Ne4+ Ke6 7.Nf2 Bd5 8.Bf6 h1=Q 9.Nxh1 Bxh1=; 3... Kd6 The threat was ...Bc7+ 4\\\\. Be7+ Kc6 White has achieved the closing of the long diagonal a8‚Äìh1. The only way to avoid this would be for Black to repeat moves. Now White can build his \\"fortress\\" without the worry of the queen getting to the back rank via the long diagonal. 5\\\\. f6! h2 6. Bf8! h1=Q 7. Bh6! with the idea of 8.Kf8 and 9.Kg7. White will be safe behind the barrier of pawns. It is a positional draw.

He is regarded as one of the Four Guardians of the Tokugawa (Tokugawa-Shitenn≈ç).Chido Museum: Sakai clan history along with Honda Tadakatsu, Ii Naomasa, and Sakakibara Yasumasa. Biography Tadatsugu was born in 1527 to Sakai Tadachika, a hereditary vassal of the Matsudaira clan of Mikawa Province. When Tadatsugu came of age, he first served Tokugawa Ieyasu's father, Matsudaira Hirotada. After 1560, when Ieyasu broke off his ties with the Imagawa clan, Tadatsugu was given command of the Yoshida Castle in eastern Mikawa (present-day Toyohashi). During that time, it is said Tadatsugu killed a boar with his katana, earning it the name of the Inokiri (Áå™Âàá the Boar Slayer). The blade itself was a work of Masazane from the Tegai school of Nara, and a colleague of the famous Muramasa (or maybe another name for Muramasa himself). Masazane also authored Tonb≈çgiri (ËúªËõâÂàá the Dragonfly Slayer), the most famous of the Three Great Spears of Japan (Â§©‰∏ã‰∏âÂêçÊßç), favourite weapon of Honda Tadakatsu, another one of the Tokugawa Shitenn≈ç. Service under Ieyasu By 1567, the majority of daimy≈ç forces in the Tokugawa armies were organized in two divisions, each with a separate commander. Tadatsugu was placed over the forces of 18 Tokugawa daimy≈ç-vassals and his counterpart, Ishikawa Kazumasa, was given command over the forces of 13 daimy≈ç-vassals.Jansen, Marius. (1995) Warrior Rule in Japan, p. 182. Tadatsugu's qualities of proven loyalty, reliability, and leadership are demonstrably illustrated in this degree of delegated powers and authority. In 1572, during the Battle of Mikatagahara, Tadatsugu secured the Tokugawa's right flank, seeing his troops being badly beaten by the opposing Takeda forces; and when Ieyasu and his allies retreated to Hamamatsu Castle, Tadatsugu participated in the ruse which mitigated the effects of Takeda victory in the field; and the Takeda forces withdrew.Bryant, Anthony. (1994). Samurai, 1550‚Äì1600, p. 61. In 1575, during the Battle of Nagashino, he led a successful night attack against the Takeda along with Kanamori Nagachika. Turnbull, Stephen. (2000) Nagashino 1575: Slaughter at the Barricades, p. 60. In 1578, Tadatsugu's son, Sakai Ietsugu (1564‚Äì1619), took over his father's role as castellan of Yoshida Castle. The ie- in the beginning of Ietsugu's name was a special honor bestowed by Tokugawa Ieyasu, a special reward for special vassals, allowing them to use one of the kanji from his Nanori name.Plutschow, Herbert. (1995). \\"Japan's Name Culture: The Significance of Names in a Religious, Political and Social Context, p.53. In 1584, during the Battle of Komaki and Nagakute, he successfully turned back a move by Toyotomi Hideyoshi against Kiyosu Castle, which was led by Toyotomi commander Mori Nagayoshi. In 1590, during the Odawara Campaign, Tadatsugu was ordered to accompany Tokugawa Hidetada, Ieyasu's son and heir, to Kyoto, where he served as hostage for Ieyasu's loyalty to the Toyotomi during that campaign. After the battle, Hideyoshi ordered to Tokugawa clan to relocate from their ancestral holdings to the Kant≈ç region. Tadatsugu went into retirement, but his son Ietsugu received a 30,000 koku fudai fief at Usui, in Shim≈çsa Province, and Tadasugu accompanied them there. Death Tadatsugu died in Kyoto in the winter of 1596. After Tadatsugu's death, the Sakai clan continued to prosper. In 1604, his descendants moved to Takasaki Domain (50,000 koku) in K≈çzuke Province; in 1616, they relocated to Takata Domain (100,000 koku) in Echigo Province; in 1619, they were transferred to Matsushiro Domain in Shinano Province; and then, from 1622 through 1868, they were installed at Tsurugaoka Domain (120,000 koku) in Dewa Province.

Pencz was probably born in Westheim near Bad Windsheim/Franconia. He travelled to Nuremberg in 1523 and joined Albrecht D√ºrer‚Äôs atelier. Like D√ºrer, he visited Italy and was profoundly influenced by Venetian art; it is believed he worked with Marcantonio Raimondi. In 1525, he was imprisoned with the brothers Barthel Beham and Hans Sebald Beham, the so-called \\"godless painters\\", for spreading the radical views of Thomas M√ºntzer by asserting disbelief in baptism, Christ and transubstantiation. The three were pardoned shortly afterwards and became part of the group known as the \\"Little Masters\\" because of their tiny, intricate and influential prints. In Nuremberg, influenced by works he had seen in Italy, Pencz painted a number of trompe l'oeil ceilings in the houses of patrician families; one, for which a drawing survives, showed workmen raising building materials on a hoist, against an open sky, to create the illusion that the room was still under construction. Around 1539, Pencz briefly returned to Italy, visiting Rome for the first time, returning to Nuremberg in 1540, where he became the city painter and earned his greatest success as a portraitist. As an engraver, he ranks among the best of the German ‚ÄúLittle Masters‚Äù. Notable prints include Six Triumphs of Petrarch and Life of Christ (26 plates). The best of his paintings are portraits, such as Portrait of a Young Man , Portrait of Marshal Schirmer and Portrait of Erhard Schwetzer and his wife. In 1550, he was named court painter by Albert, Duke of Prussia, but died in Leipzig before arriving at the court.AA.VV., Alte Pinakothek Munich, Edition Lipp, Munich, 1986.

With biographer Linda King Newell, she co-authored Mormon Enigma: Emma Hale Smith, a biography of the wife of the founder of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Joseph Smith. Biography Avery was born in the agricultural and industrial city of Great Falls, Montana. She attended Rocky Mountain College in Billings, and Brigham Young University, in Provo, Utah. She married Charles C. Avery in 1961; the couple had four children, but divorced in 1986. In 1996, Avery married Bryan Collier Short. Avery attended graduate school at Northern Arizona University during her research for Emma Smith's biography. She earned a master's degree in history in 1981, and her Ph.D. in history in 1984. She served as president of the Mormon History Association between 1987 and 1988. Avery was well known in the western history field for articles, reviews and commentaries. She served as professor of history, with specialties in women's history and Colorado Plateau Studies, at Northern Arizona until her retirement in 2005. Avery died in Flagstaff, Arizona.  Major biographies  \\"Mormon Enigma: Emma Hale Smith\\" was well received by the scholarly community when it was first published in 1984. The biography won the Evans Biography Award, the Mormon History Association Best Book Award, and the John Whitmer Historical Association (RLDS) Best Book Award. Avery and Newell provided the following note in the book's introduction: :Early leaders in Utah castigated Emma from their pulpits for opposing Brigham Young and the practice of polygamy, and for lending support to the Reorganization. As these attitudes filtered down through the years, Emma was virtually written out of official Utah histories. In this biography, we have attempted to reconstruct the full story of this remarkable and much misunderstood woman's experiences. Despite its quality and recognition, the biography was startling and controversial among leaders, administrators and members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Shortly after publication, Avery and Newell, both participating members in the church, were refused any opportunity to talk about their research or book in church meetings. In the preface to the second edition of the book, the authors write: ¬´After a ten-months stalemate Linda Newell successfully petitioned church leaders to reconsider the prohibition. On April 26, 1986, she was informed that the restrictions ... were no longer in effect.¬ª Yet the fact that the lifting of that ban was not reported by the church-owned newspaper Deseret News led them to say that it ¬´gave the unmistakable message to faithful church members that both the book and its authors were still suspect.¬ª Avery produced a biography of the life of the youngest son of Joseph and Emma Smith, David Hyrum Smith, From Mission to Madness: Last Son of the Mormon Prophet in 1998. This biography also won the Evans Award for the best biography in Western history. She describes Smith's mental deterioration, starting with a probable breakdown early in 1870 and ending with his 1904 death in the Northern Illinois Hospital and Asylum for the Insane in Elgin, Illinois. He was confined in the institution for twenty-seven years. The book draws on a large body of Smith's correspondence and poetry to examine both his personality and his emotional state.

The terminology is used when applying for medical insurance or tax deduction status. Doctors have been prescribing these prostheses since the 1950s. Cranial prostheses also help to protect disease- weakened immune systems from the sun, and to regulate body temperature. Cranial hair prostheses have advanced due to technology. A cranial hair prosthesis is different from a regular wig. Cranial hair prosthesis is done in several steps that include the taking of the cranial perimeter mold to achieve a perfect fit. The mold is done at the base where the hair is attached. The base is made using a hypoallergenic fabric because people having chemotherapy are usually very sensitive to any material, and their scalp is prone to allergies. The same is done when applying the hair to the base. The technique used to attach the hair is focused on avoiding that the knotting touches the scalp.

Musical career  Barfield's first two albums (Beyond Me and My Heart Is Quiet) were independently produced. In 2003, he was signed to CCM label Creative Trust Workshop (CTW), which gave him more exposure. 'My Heart Goes Out' and 'Mistaken', songs from his third album 'Warren Barfield' project became Top 10 Christian radio hits. CTW folded soon thereafter, and Barfield's second studio album, \\"Reach\\", was released by Reunion Records in 2006. His third studio album, Worth Fighting For, was released on Essential Records in 2008, produced by Charlie Peacock. The song, \\"Love Is Not a Fight\\", from this album was included in the 2008 film, Fireproof. The film inspired a tour, \\"Love Worth Fighting For\\", that was dedicated to the theme of preserving marriage and ran from 2009 till 2018. Barfield created and produced the tour partnering with promoter Mike Williams. Over 200,000 people have attended the event. The tour featured speaking by actor Kirk Cameron, who had played the lead role in Fireproof, and speaking, comedy and music by Barfield, whose aforementioned song had been inspired by realizations about his own marriage. Barfield's 2012 album, Redbird, was independently produced (with members of the production team including Wayne Kirkpatrick, Bryan White, and members of Needtobreathe) and featured a more acoustic sound compared to his earlier albums. Mark Rice of JesusFreakHideout has called the album less accessible than Barfield's previous work, likely to turn off the fans of his early overproduced pop-style music, but \\"a very rewarding listen\\" that showed that Barfield was \\"still a force to be reckoned with in Christian music.\\" In 2009 Barfield became a speaker and child sponsorship advocate. In the 2017, Barfield officially retired from his work in the Christian music industry.  Personal life  Warren has been married since September 1, 2001 and has two children.

The group is notable for having the first Christian rock album nominated for a Grammy award and the first American Christian group to have a video entered into MTVs rotation. They are also noted as being among the first groups to raise the level of technical excellence to match general market releases of the time. While the group played blues based rock with a minor British progressive rock influence, they migrated to a more pop and rock style as time went on. DeGarmo played keyboards and sang background vocals (and occasionally lead), while Key played lead guitar and did the majority of the lead vocals. The other musicians at the time of formation in the late 70s were John Hamptone, David Spain, Max Richardson and Terry Moxley (drums) along with Joe Hardy and Ken Porter (bass). Later members included Tommy Cathey on bass (1982), Greg Morrow on drums as well as Tony Pilcher on rhythm and second lead guitar. Their best known songs are: \\"Destined to Win\\", \\"Let the Whole World Sing\\", \\"Six, Six, Six\\", \\"Boycott Hell\\", \\"Every Moment\\" and \\"Casual Christian\\". The group is also noted for their albums Streetlight (1986), D&K; (1987), and The Pledge (1989). Other musicians who have recorded or toured with DeGarmo & Key include Kenny Porter (bass), Kevin Rodell (drums), Chuck Reynolds (drums), Steve Taylor (guitar) (not related to another Steve Taylor, who is also a contemporary Christian artist) and Mark Pogue (guitar). The group was nominated for seven Grammy Awards and five Dove Awards DeGarmo and Key disbanded in 1995.  History  Eddie DeGarmo and Dana Key grew up in Whitehaven, Tennessee; a large neighborhood in South Memphis which is also home to Graceland. Key indicated in an interview that Elvis Presley was one of his earliest musical influences. Key and Degarmo met in first grade at Graves Elementary. There is disagreement among sources as to when the pair formed their first band, Globe. It may have been during their 5th, 6th or 7th grade year at Graves or Hillcrest. While at Hillcrest High School, Globe had signed with Hi Records which was owned by Willie Mitchell at that time. In 1972, DeGarmo - responding to an altar call at a Dallas Holm concert -and Key - witnessed to by DeGarmo in a janitor's closet - became Christians while seniors at Hillcrest High. They approached the other members in Globe wanting to change the direction of the band to Christian music. After much discussion, Key and DeGarmo parted with their bandmates as friends, leaving Globe at some point in 1972. The two put music on hold for a time and chose to do ministry work for Youth for Christ, along with opening a storefront coffeehouse. Being influenced by Larry Norman's album Only Visiting This Planet, they saw in Norman's work what they believed God could do through Contemporary Christian music. A decision was made to put together a trio which they called the Christian Band; changing its name to the DeGarmo and Key Band. Youth for Christ loaned the band money to record a demo tape. The tape contributed to them securing a contract with Lion & Lamb which released their debut album \\"This Time Thru\\" in 1977. The \\"Straight On\\" album, which showed a prog rock influence, followed in 1979. This was the only DeGarmo & Key album to make the critic's poll of the 100 best albums list published by CCM in 2001. The group's third album, \\"This Ain't Hollywood\\" released in 1980, became the first Christian rock album to be nominated for a Grammy for best Gospel performance, contemporary or inspirational. The album included a duet with Amy Grant, \\"Nobody Loves Me Like You Do\\". This association lead to Grant touring with D&K; as an opening act with D&K; as her musical support/backup band in 1981. This was Grant's first big tour and was a boost for both artists. Dan Brock, D&K;'s manager/booking agent, explained, \\"She was the darling of the gospel industry at that time and they (D&K;) were the outcasts. We (D&K;) got a lot of bad press from the gospel establishment people who said they were ruining Amy's music by playing it too loud, but at the time she was drawing a couple thousand people and we were only drawing about 400 or 500, so it gave us a lot of exposure.\\" This pairing did close to 40 dates and improved Grant's act along with giving her a harder rock sound. Some of the dates were recorded resulting in Grant's two releases, \\"Amy Grant-In Concert\\" and \\"In Concert Vol. 2\\". With the release of their sixth album, \\"Communication\\", DeGarmo & Key became the first American Christian group to have a music video appear on MTV. The video production of \\"Six, Six,Six\\", one of the songs included on \\"Communication\\", became the first song from a religious record label to placed in MTV's regular rotation. The original video for the song was one of a number of videos that MTV pulled from rotation due to violent content. The removal was prompted by a public reaction to the U.S. Senate hearings on sex and violence in music. MTV had misinterpreted the song \\"Six, Six, Six\\" as an anti- Christian statement. According to industry news reports at the time, MTV executive Sandra Sparrow was unaware that DeGarmo & Key were a Christian band when she included the video in a list of videos to be excised. MTV allowed DeGarmo & Key to submit a re-edited version which was placed back into light rotation. Removed from the re-edited video was a short scene of a man representing the Antichrist being set on fire. Another notable inclusion on the album was a cover of Pacific Gas & Electric's (which was founded by Glenn Schwartz of the All Saved Freak Band) \\"Are You Ready\\". The album \\"D&K;\\", the group's ninth, was packaged with a free second album/cassette with identical content for the first 100,000 copies. The intention of this promotion was for the buyer to give the free copy to an \\"unsaved friend\\". Promotion for their 11th album, \\"The Pledge\\" released in 1989, used the tag line \\"Take the Pledge - Read the Word\\" and was made in concert with the publisher of the New International Version of the Bible. For the 1991 album release, \\"Go to the Top\\", the duo developed and published a Bible study curriculum to go with the album. During their time together both Key and DeGarmo recorded two solo albums apiece. Awards During early 2007 Key and DeGarmo received the ASCAP Vision Award at the 29th Annual ASCAP Christian Music Awards. The duo were 2010 inductees into the Gospel Music Association's Hall of Fame in January 2011. Reunions Key and DeGarmo reunited to do a concert on October 21, 2007 at TLC Church in Cordova, Tennessee. They also performed at the 2008 Cornerstone Festival in Bushnell, Illinois. Personnel DeGarmo is a descendant of Davy Crockett. In 1987 DeGarmo, along with Key and two other individuals, co-founded ForeFront Records for which DeGarmo worked until leaving the label in 1999. Season 3 American Idol finalist Diana DeGarmo is his niece. Key is a descendant of Francis Scott Key. He was an executive with Ardent Records and authored two books - ‚ÄúDon't Stop the Music‚Äù (1989) and ‚ÄúBy Devine Design‚Äù (1995).

The story of Clara Ward, who commonly used one or another version of the title \\"Princesse de Caraman-Chimay\\", is poorly known today, but for some years in the early 1890s she was the toast of the United States. During the late 1890s and the Edwardian years, she spent much time in both the society and gossip columns of two continents. She was widely known, envied and admired, desired, loathed and reviled. Early life Clara Ward was born in Detroit, Michigan, the daughter of Captain Eber Brock Ward (1811‚Äì1875) and his second wife, Catherine Lyon, a niece of Senator Benjamin Wade. A wealthy man, often stated to be Michigan's first millionaire, E.B. Ward had holdings in Great Lakes steamships; lumbering at Ludington, Michigan; iron and steel manufacturing at Wyandotte, Michigan, Leland, Michigan, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and Chicago, Illinois; and silver mining in Colorado. He manufactured the first Bessemer steel to be made in the United States at his plant in Wyandotte. Ward was president of the Flint and Pere Marquette Railroad from 1860 until his death on 2 January 1875 in Detroit. Captain Ward died when Clara was less than two years old. The mill and timber holdings at Ludington passed into the hands of Clara's mother and were managed by her brother, Thomas R. Lyon, as the firm of Thomas R. Lyon, Agent. As a child, Clara and her mother periodically visited Ludington to see their kin and inspect the mills. First marriage She came to the public's attention in 1889 or early 1890, when it was announced that a distinguished Belgian visitor to the United States, the Prince of Caraman-Chimay, a member of the Belgian Chamber of Deputies, had proposed marriage to the very young, very attractive daughter of a very wealthy family. The Ch√¢teau de Chimay is in the county of Hainaut, Belgium, near the French border. The holder of the title \\"Prince of Caraman-Chimay\\" did so rightfully and possessed a long and proper noble pedigree. This princely title was of the \\"foreign prince\\" type of the old French monarchy, in which \\"Prince\\" is a noble rank rather than a method showing the degree of relationship to the crown. The wife of that sort of prince becomes a \\"Princess\\", and so Clara became, entirely legitimately, a European princess. That her husband-to-be was more than twice her age, quite poor, and even, perhaps, not very handsome, seems to have been of minor consequence. They were married on 20 May 1890, in Paris. Clara was married at age 16 and her husband was 31. Ward was now properly styled \\"Princesse de Caraman-Chimay\\", but usually went by \\"Clara, Princess of Chimay\\". Americans were ecstatic about their new princess. (The first American princess had been Catherine Willis Gray, great-grandniece of George Washington, who married a nephew of Emperor Napoleon, Prince Achille Murat of Naples, in 1826; Baltimore heiress Betsy Patterson had previously married Napoleon's brother J√©r√¥me (later King of Westphalia) in 1803, but Napoleon annulled the marriage within a few years.) In 1891 she was the subject of a portrait by G.P.A. Healy, today in the collection of the Illinois State Museum in Springfield. Two children shortly followed the marriage: * Marie Elisabeth Catharine Anatole de Riquet, Comtesse de Caraman-Chimay (1891‚Äì1939) * Marie Joseph Anatole Pierre Alphonse de Riquet, Prince de Caraman-Chimay (1894‚Äì1920) There is evidence that she and the Prince favored the more prestigious Parisian restaurants with their patronage. Specifically, the great chef Escoffier named both Oeufs √† la Chimay and Poularde Chimay after Princess Clara. Second marriage Clara Ward and her second husband, Rig√≥ Jancsi, from a photograph on a German postcard from about 1905 A French albumen print of Ward, wearing a flesh-colored bodystocking and holding a mirror aloft, from about 1905 Some time after the birth of their second child, in early November 1896, the Prince and Princess Chimay were dining in Paris, at what may be expected to have been a suitably elegant establishment. Present at the restaurant was a Hungarian, Rig√≥ Jancsi, who eked out a living providing Gypsy music. (Being Hungarian, \\"Rig√≥\\" was the gentleman's family name meaning \\"blackbird\\", and \\"Jancsi\\" his given name ‚àí it is the Hungarian version of \\"Johnny\\".) Rig√≥ was a Gypsy violinist (he is sometimes listed as a chef but it is not true.) After a series of secret meetings, Ward and Rig√≥ eloped in December 1896. To her family's consternation, the Ludington Record of 24 December 1896 carried a news service dispatch about the elopement with a woodcut illustration of Ward and the headline \\"Gone With a Gypsy\\". It was stated that Prince Joseph would at once institute divorce proceedings against his wife. Subsequent editions of the newspaper carried brief notices as to where Ward and Rig√≥ had been reported seen during their trek across Europe to Hungary. In Budapest a well-known cube-shaped chocolate sponge cake and chocolate cream pastry was named Rigo Jancsi after the scandalous affair Ward and Rig√≥ were having. The Prince and Princesse de Caraman-Chimay were divorced on 19 January 1897. The new couple married, probably in Hungary. Some accounts indicate that they soon moved to Egypt, where Clara taught her husband the intricacies of reading and writing. Not too surprisingly, Clara Ward, still usually called the Princess Chimay, soon found her resources dwindling. The never-very-full Chimay coffers were certainly closed to her, and although Ward was resourceful, her American family had to intervene from time to time to straighten out her tangled finances. Her main talents were being beautiful by the standards of the time, and being famous. She combined the two by posing on various stages, including at least the Folies Berg√®re and probably also the Moulin Rouge, while wearing skin-tight costumes. She called her art-form her poses plastiques. Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec made a scarce lithograph of her and Rig√≥ in 1897, \\"Idylle Princi√®re\\". She was often photographed, and featured on many postcards during the Edwardian period, sometimes in a pose plastique and sometimes in more or less conventional dress. Kaiser Wilhelm II is said to have forbidden the publication or display of her photograph in the German Empire because he thought her beauty \\"disturbing\\". Later life Perhaps the income from this odd occupation was sufficient for the couple to live reasonably well. The idyll was not to last, Rig√≥ being unfaithful to her. They were divorced fairly soon after their marriage, either shortly before or after Ward met her next love, one Peppino Ricciardo, sometimes stated to have been Spanish, but who was most likely Italian. He is believed to have been a waiter whom she met on a train. They married in 1904, but Peppino Ricciardo probably did not last long. The timing is vague, but Ward's next love, and her last husband, is thought to have been a station manager of the little Italian railroad that helped visitors tour Mount Vesuvius, a Signor Cassalota. Ward is believed to have still been married to her fourth husband when she died in Padua, Italy, on 9 December 1916, aged 43. It was not until some three years after Ward's death that her first husband, Prince Joseph de Riquet of Chimay and Caraman, finally remarried ‚Äî to a young lady who had only been a few months old when he and Clara originally married. Legacy Marcel Proust was fond of Clara. This is affirmed by Marthe, Princess Bibesco, who quoted from a letter he wrote to her cousin, Antoine, that he wrote to her and - although, alas, he hadn't seen her for some years, he still liked her just as much. (My paraphrase, from Bibesco's memoir, \\"Au Bal avec Marcel Proust\\", available from Gallimard). In fact, Proust based a character in \\"√Ä la recherche du temps perdu\\" on Clara Ward: that of a cousin of the Baron Charlus. The major character of the Duchesse de Guermantes was chiefly based on Clara Ward's first sister-in-law, Elisabeth, who became the Comtesse de Greffulhe after her marriage. The character of Simone Pistache in the film version of Cole Porter's musical Can- Can was based in part on Clara Ward. In the film, set in Paris in 1896, Shirley MacLaine as Pistache dances in a skin-tight, flesh-colored costume like that favored by Ward.

Named after Major General Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, it was established to provide a nature and forest preserve for aesthetic and conservation purposes. The refuge is one of seven refuges administered by the Savannah Coastal Refuges Complex in Savannah, Georgia. The complex has a combined staff of 31 with a fiscal year 2005 budget of $3,582,000. History Pinckney Island NWR is archaeologically rich, with 115 prehistoric and historic sites identified. Analysis of the prehistoric sites indicate human occupation dating from the Archaic Period (8000-1000 BC), with intensive use during the Mississippian Period (1000-1500 AD). Historic artifacts indicate that small scale, impermanent settlements were made on Pinckney by French and Spanish groups in the 16th and 17th centuries. Permanent settlements did not occur until 1708 when Alexander Mackay, an Indian trader, obtained title to of present-day Pinckney Island. By 1715, Mackay had acquired the rest of the island, as well as most of the other islands which comprise the present refuge. In 1736, Mackay's widow sold the islands to Charles Pinckney, father of General Charles Cotesworth Pinckney. General Pinckney was a commander during the Revolutionary War, a signer of the United States Constitution, and, in 1804 and 1808, a presidential candidate for the Federalist Party. After he inherited the islands from his father, Pinckney was an absentee landowner until 1804, when he moved to the island and began managing the property. The Pinckney family developed the islands into a plantation, removing much of the maritime forest and draining and tilling the fertile soil. By 1818, over 200 slaves labored to produce fine quality long-staple Sea Island Cotton on ; 386 slaves lived on the island by 1840. The plantation flourished until the American Civil War, when it was occupied by Union troops. Small skirmishes took place on Pinckney Island. The most significant incident occurred on August 21, 1862, when the Confederate Beaufort Light Artillery/11th Infantry attacked the camp of Company H, Third Regiment, New Hampshire Volunteers, killing four Union soldiers and wounding ten men (eight Confederate, two Union). US Army records reflect that black troops were recruited for the Union Army from the area. Five military (U.S. Colored Troops) headstones are located in a cemetery on the northwest side of Pinckney Island. It is possible that the U.S. Army had recruited slaves from the Pinckney plantation. After the war and late century agricultural recession, the plantation did not prosper. By the 1930s, it was virtually abandoned. In 1937, after more than 200 years of Pinckney family ownership, the plantation was sold to Ellen Bruce, wife of James Bruce, a New York banker who used the property as a hunting preserve. The Bruces planted hardwoods and pine, built ponds to attract waterfowl and provide for irrigation, and placed 70 percent of the farm fields back into cultivation. In 1954 Edward Starr and James Madison Barker, a distinguished MIT alumnus and early leader in the field of international business, purchased the islands. They continued to manage them as a game preserve. In 1975, they donated the islands to the United States Fish and Wildlife Service to be managed exclusively as a National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) and as a nature and forest preserve for aesthetic and conservation purposes. The Pinckney Island NWR was established on December 4, 1975. Topography The refuge includes Pinckney Island, Corn Island, Big Harry and Little Harry Islands, Buzzard Island and numerous small hammocks. Pinckney is the largest of the islands and the only one open to public use. Nearly 67% of the refuge consists of salt marsh and tidal creeks. A wide variety of land types are found on Pinckney Island alone: saltmarsh, forestland, brushland, fallow field and freshwater ponds. In combination, these habitats support a diversity of bird and plant life. Wildlife Wildlife commonly observed on Pinckney Island include waterfowl, shorebirds, wading birds, raptors, neo-tropical migrants, and white-tailed deer, with large concentrations of white ibis, herons, and egrets. Other species include the American alligator, flatwoods salamander, nine-banded armadillo, bald eagle, and the wood stork. Facilities There is no visitor center at the refuge. However, there are opportunities for hiking, cycling, photography and wildlife observation. Each year the refuge holds a one-day quota deer hunt to ensure that population numbers remain in balance with the surrounding habitat. However, fishing is prohibited from the land portions of the refuge. Trails There are of hiking trails on the refuge and nine recommended hikes: * Ibis Pond - , round trip; one and a half hours walking at a leisurely pace * Shell Point - , round trip; four hours and 15 minutes * Wood Stork Pond - , round trip; two and a half hours * Osprey Pond - , round trip; three hours * Nini Chapin Pond - , round trip; three and a half hours * Bull Point - , round trip; five hours * Dick Point - , round trip; six and a half hours * Clubhouse Pond - , round trip; five and a half hours * White Point - , round trip; seven hours See also * List of National Wildlife Refuges External links * Pinckney Island National Wildlife Refuge homepage * FWS profile of Pinckney Island NWR Category:Protected areas of Beaufort County, South Carolina Category:Islands of South Carolina Category:National Wildlife Refuges in South Carolina Category:Pinckney family Category:Wetlands of South Carolina Category:Islands of Beaufort County, South Carolina Category:1975 establishments in South Carolina ","title":"Pinckney Island National Wildlife Refuge"},{"id":"3571869","title":"Demography of Scotland"},{"id":"3571871","text":"Stop the Express (also known as Bousou Tokkyuu SOS (Êö¥Ëµ∞ÁâπÊÄ•SOS, \\"Runaway Express SOS,\\" in Japan) is a video game developed by Hudson Soft and published in 1983. It was written for the Sharp X1 and later ported to the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, and MSX. It was remade for Nintendo Family Computer as Challenger („ÉÅ„É£„É¨„É≥„Ç∏„É£„Éº) in 1985.  Gameplay  In Stage 1, the player runs along the top of an express train, jumping between carriages while avoiding enemy knives and obstacles. Halfway along the train, the player enters the train, and Stage 2 begins. The player must then proceed through the carriages, towards the front of the train, so that it can be stopped. Upon the completion of each level, the game displays the Engrish message \\"Congraturation! You Sucsess!\\". The game then repeats from Stage 1, with more enemies. Enemies, known as \\"redmen\\", initially pursue from the rear on the roof of the train, and the front once inside, and will throw knives which the player must dodge by ducking under, or jumping over, them. In addition, once inside the train, the player can jump up and hang from the overhead straps out of the way of the redmen. However, ghosts flit up and down the carriages making it extremely dangerous to stay there too long. Once a few levels have been completed, redmen will approach from both front and rear. The player has only two weapons at his disposal. When on the roof of the train, he can catch birds that fly overhead and then release them to run along the carriage and knock the redmen off, as well as high kicking them. Whilst inside, the high kick is the only option. DevelopmentReception Stop the Express was rated as the 4th best Spectrum game by Your Sinclair, in their list of the top 100 Spectrum games. Retro Gamer, meanwhile, ranked it as the twelfth best game for the Spectrum. Legacy An NES/Famicom port was planned, but due to only having the first train level, three levels were added and became Challenger, which was released only in Japan.

The station was owned by SMC Communications. WWBI was licensed as a Class A station, even though the calls list it as an \\"-LP\\"; this was the case with many other stations licensed prior to 1999, when the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) began to assign the \\"-CA\\" suffix for Class A licenses. On cable, WWBI was seen on Charter channel 10 in Plattsburgh and Comcast digital channel 142 in Burlington, Vermont. History WWBI signed on in 1992 as an independent station. The station originally had plans to become the Fox affiliate for the Burlington‚ÄìPlattsburgh market and Montreal, but negotiations failed and the station adopted the UPN affiliation in 1995. However, three stations changed affiliation in 1999: UPN moved to former WB station WBVT-LP, The WB moved to Fox station WFFF-TV as a secondary affiliate, and WWBI initially went independent before switching to Ion (then known as Pax TV). Some of its programming included The Jerry Springer Show and WWF/E Jakked/Metal. Word of God Fellowship, Inc., parent company of the Daystar Television Network, reached an agreement to purchase WWBI-LP in the fall of 2005; the station began running Daystar programming under a local marketing agreement (LMA) by the end of the year. There was originally word that the station would run Daystar programming part-time while keeping some programming from i: Independent Television (which Pax had become in July 2005) as part of the schedule, however, by at least as of January 2006, it changed over to full- time Daystar (religious) programming. Following this, WWBI was replaced by the i satellite feed on local cable systems, who were never obligated to carry WWBI in the first place since it is a low power station. In October 2006, however, WWBI's sale to Daystar had fallen through; as a result, the station once again returned to programming from the i network (which became Ion in January 2007) and returned to local cable systems by mid-November 2006. On June 6, 2006, WWBI's former studio, the Hotel Holland in Rouses Point, New York, was destroyed in a fire. The Hotel Holland was used for WWBI's studios back in the days when they were an independent station and UPN affiliate, and when the fire occurred, was used as storage for broadcasting equipment after relocating their studios. Since July 2007, WWBI's signal had been off the air. Its license expired on June 1, 2007 and was not renewed. As of March 29, 2011, WWBI's license has been canceled and its call sign deleted by the FCC.http://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi- bin/prod/cdbs/forms/prod/getimportletter_exh.cgi?import_letter_id=25219 WWBI's cable slots have been replaced with the national Ion feed.Per Zap2it, zip codes 12901 and 05401. Translator WWBI operated one translator, W14CK in Newport, Vermont, which was added in 1997; this station's transmitter was located atop Jay Peak. Like the parent station, W14CK, despite being a translator and being assigned a translator call sign, was licensed as a Class A station. W14CK's license remained active (as that station did file for license renewal); however, it was downgraded from Class A status and reverted to the standard low-power repeater class on October 24, 2012 due to failure to file E/I children's television reports. On June 12, 2015, W14CK's license was canceled by the FCC for failure to file a license renewal application.

These problems were never corrected, and WWBI-LP was withdrawn from the service by orders from the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC). Usually, the main WWBI signal only reached the international border, though many in the Montreal area have managed to pull the signal in, with varying results.

Biography  Born in Milan, he began studying piano when he was six and cello when he was eight. Initially taught by Giovanni Berti, Janigro enrolled in the Verdi Conservatory of Milan, where he was instructed by Gilberto Crepax. By 1934 Janigro was studying under Diran Alexanian and Pablo Casals at the √âcole Normale in Paris. He graduated from the school in 1934 and began performing solo and in recitals with Dinu Lipatti, Paul Badura-Skoda and Alfredo Rossi., \\"Al Conservatorio: Sciostacovic\\", journal La Stampa, 04/04/1948, Italia. An unfortunately timed vacation in Yugoslavia left Janigro stranded in that country for the duration of World War II. He became a professor of cello and chamber music at the Zagreb Conservatory, where his influence developed modern cello playing in Yugoslavia. He also performed as part of the Maƒçek-≈†ulek-Janigro Trio. At war's end Janigro travelled throughout South America and the Far East as a soloist. In 1949, he started his career as a conductor. In 1959, he was Fritz Reiner's soloist, along with Milton Preves and John Weicher, in a renowned Chicago Symphony Orchestra recording of Strauss's Don Quixote. An extraordinarily gifted teacher, Janigro educated many cellists around the world. Most of them studied at the Staatliche Hochschule f√ºr Musik und Darstellende Kunst Stuttgart and the Mozarteum Salzburg. Among his students were Julius Berger, Mario Brunello, Thomas Demenga, Michael Flaksman , Michael Gro√ü, Antonio Meneses, Andrej Petrac, Mario de Secondi, Giovanni Sollima, Gustavo Tavares, Enrico Dindo and Christoph Theinert. Janigro was a highly regarded conductor who led a symphony orchestra for Radio Zagreb and guest-conducted throughout Europe. The chamber orchestra I Solisti di Zagreb was created by Janigro and Dragutin Hrdjok in 1954 and was led by Janigro until he left the ensemble in 1968. He died in Zagreb.

The derisive name was coined by the magnates, who for the most part supported the King and claimed that the conflict's only effect was the near-extinction of the local chickens, eaten by the nobles gathered for the rokosz at Lw√≥w, in Ruthenian Voivodeship. The magnates' choice of \\"kokosz\\"‚Äîmeaning \\"an egg laying hen\\"‚Äîmay have been inspired by a play on words between \\"kokosz\\" and the similar-sounding \\"rokosz\\". The Chicken War was the first rokosz of the Szlachta in Polish history.Na podstawie: Stanis≈Çaw Rosik, Przemys≈Çaw Wiszewski, Poczet polskich kr√≥l√≥w i ksiƒÖ≈ºƒÖt, Wroc≈Çaw 2004, str. 215 Backgrounds At the start of his reign, King Sigismund I the Old inherited a Kingdom of Poland with a century-long tradition of liberties of the nobility, confirmed in numerous privileges. Sigismund faced the challenge of consolidating internal power to handle external threats to the country. During the rule of his predecessor, Alexander I, the statute of \\"Nihil novi\\" had been instituted, effectively forbidding kings of Poland to promulgate laws without the consent of the Parliament. This proved crippling to Sigismund's dealings with his nobles and serious threats to the country's stability. To strengthen the royal authority, he initiated a set of reforms, establishing a permanent conscription army in 1527 and extending the bureaucratic apparatus necessary to govern the state and finance the army. Supported by his Italian consort, Bona Sforza, he began buying up land and started several agricultural reforms to enlarge the royal treasury. He also initiated a process of restitution of royal properties, previously pawned or rented to the nobles. The Rokosz In 1537, however, the King's policies led to a major conflict. The nobility, gathered near Lw√≥w to meet with a lev√©e en masse, called for a military campaign against Moldavia. However, the lesser and middle strata of the nobility called a rokosz, or semi-legal rebellion, to force the King to abandon his reforms. According to contemporary accounts, 150,000 militia had been assembled for the rebellion. The nobles presented him with 36 demands, most notably: # Confirmation and extension of the privileges of the nobility; # The carrying out of a law requiring the appointment of only the local nobles to most important local offices; # Lifting of the toll or exemption of the nobility from it; # Exemption of the nobility from the tithes; # A cleanup of the Treasury rather than its expansion; # A cessation of further land acquisitions by Queen Bona Sforza; # The creation of a body of permanent advisors to the king - and # Adoption of a law concerning incompatibilitas‚Äîthe incompatibility of certain offices that were not to be joined in the same hand (for instance, that of a Starosta and of a Palatine or Castellan); Finally, the angry protesters criticized the role of Queen Bona, whom they accused for the \\"bad upbringing\\" of young Prince Sigismund Augustus (future King Sigismund II), and seeking to increase her power in the state, even if both involvements were generally positive. It soon transpired, however, that the nobility's leaders were divided and that achieving a compromise was almost impossible. Too weak to start a civil war against the King, the protesters finally agreed to what was thought a compromise. The King rejected most of their demands, while accepting the principle of incompatibilitas the following year and agreeing not to force the election of the future king vivente rege, that is, in the lifetime of the reigning king. Thereupon, the nobility returned to their homes, having achieved little.

With hundreds of ships, and possibly tens of thousands of men, the Vikings arrived outside Paris in late November 885, demanding tribute. This was denied by Odo, Count of Paris, despite the fact he could assemble only several hundred soldiers to defend the city. The Vikings attacked with a variety of siege engines but failed to break through the city walls despite days of intense attacks. The siege was maintained for months but without any significant assaults after the initial attack. As the siege continued, most of the Vikings left Paris to pillage further upriver. The Vikings made a final unsuccessful attempt to take the city during the summer. In October, Charles the Fat arrived with his army. To the frustration of the Parisians who had fought to defend the city, Charles stopped short of attacking the Viking invaders. Instead, he allowed them to sail further up the Seine to raid Burgundy (which was in revolt) and promised a payment of 700 livres (257 kg) of silver. Odo, highly critical of this, attempted to defy Charles' promises. When Charles died in 888, Odo was elected the first non-Carolingian king of the Franks. Background Although the Vikings had attacked parts of Francia previously, they reached Paris for the first time in 845, eventually sacking the city. They attacked Paris three more times in the 860s, leaving only when they had acquired sufficient loot or bribes.Davis (2001) p. 53 In 864, by the Edict of Pistres, bridges were ordered built across the Seine at P√Ætres and in Paris, where two were built, one on each side of the √éle de la Cit√©, which served admirably in the siege of 885. The chief ruler in the region around Paris (the √éle-de-France) was the duke of Francia (also the Count of Paris), who controlled the lands between the Seine and Loire. Originally this was Robert the Strong, margrave of Neustria and missus dominicus for the Loire Valley. He began fortifying the capital and fought the Norsemen continuously until his death in battle against them at Brissarthe. His son Odo succeeded him, but royal power declined. Paris continued to be fortified due to local, rather than royal, initiative.Hooper, Bennet (1996) p. 23 West Francia suffered under a series of short-reigning kings after the death of Charles the Bald in 877. This situation prevailed until 884, when Charles the Fat, already King of Germany and Italy, became king, raising hopes of a reunification of Charlemagne's empire. While it was thought that the Franks had gained an upper hand against the Vikings after the victory of Louis III at the Battle of Saucourt in 881, in 885, a year after the succession of Charles, the Vikings launched their largest attack on Paris.Bradbury (1992) p. 43 Siege Danish Vikings under Sigfred and SinricTucker (2009) p. 226 sailed towards West Francia again in 885, having raided the north-eastern parts of the country before. Sigfred demanded a bribe from Charles, but was refused, and promptly led 700 ships up the Seine, carrying perhaps as many as 30,000 or 40,000 men.Kohn (2006) p. 588 The number, the largest ever recorded for a Viking fleet in contemporary sources, originates from Abbo Cernuus. Although an eyewitness, there is general agreement among historians that Abbo's numbers are \\"a gross exaggeration,\\"Hodgkin (1959) p. 741 with Abbo being \\"in a class of his own as an exaggerator.\\"Brooks (2000) pp. 51‚Äì53 Historian C. W. Previt√©- Orton has instead put the number of ships at 300,Previt√©-Orton (1955) p. 367 and John Norris at \\"some 300.\\"Norris (2007) p. 31 Although the Franks tried to block the Vikings from sailing up the Seine, the Vikings eventually managed to reach Paris. Paris at this time was a town on an island, known today as √éle de la Cit√©. Its strategic importance came from the ability to block ships' passage with its two low-lying foot bridges, one of wood and one of stone. Not even the shallow Viking ships could pass Paris because of the bridges. Odo, Count of Paris prepared for the arrival of the Vikings by fortifying the bridgehead with two towers guarding each bridge. He was low on men, having no more than 200 men-at-arms available (also according to Abbo Cernuus),Brooks (2000) p. 51 but led a joint defence with Gozlin, Bishop of Paris (the first \\"fighting bishop\\" in medieval literature),Abbo, Dass (2007) p. 8 and had the aid of his brother, Robert, two counts and a marquis.Davis (2001) pp. 53‚Äì54 The barques of the Vikings The Vikings arrived in Paris on 24Bradbury (2004) p. 133Logan (1991) p. 130 or 25Davis (2001) p. 54 November 885, initially asking for tribute from the Franks. When this was denied, they began a siege. On 26 November the Vikings attacked the northeast tower with ballistae, mangonels, and catapults. They were repulsed by a mixture of hot wax and pitch. All Viking attacks that day were repulsed, and during the night the Parisians constructed another storey on the tower.Logan (1991) p. 131 On 27 November the Viking attack included mining, battering rams, and fire, but to no avail. Bishop Gozlin entered the fray with a bow and an axe. He planted a cross on the outer defences and exhorted the people. His brother Ebles also joined the fighting. The Vikings withdrew after the failed initial attacks and built a camp on the right side of the river bank, using stone as construction material. While preparing for new attacks, the Vikings also started constructing additional siege engines.Bradbury (1992) p. 45 In a renewed assault, they shot a thousand grenades against the city, sent a ship for the bridge, and made a land attack with three groups. The forces surrounded the bridgehead tower, possibly mainly aiming to bring down the river obstacle. While they tried setting fire to the bridge, they also attacked the city itself with siege engines. Map of Paris in the 9th century (on √éle de la Cit√©) For two months the Vikings maintained the siege, making trenches and provisioning themselves off the land. In January 886 they tried to fill the river shallows with debris, plant matter, and the bodies of dead animals and dead prisoners to try to get around the tower. They continued this for two days. On the third day they set three ships alight and guided them towards the wooden bridge. The burning ships sank before they could set the bridge on fire, but the wooden construction was nonetheless weakened. On 6 February, rains caused the debris-filled river to overflow and the bridge supports to give way. The bridge gone, the northeast tower was now isolated with only twelve defenders inside. The Vikings asked the twelve to surrender, but they refused, and were all subsequently killed. The Vikings left a force around Paris, but many ventured further to pillage Le Mans, Chartres, Evreux and into the Loire. Odo successfully slipped some men through Norse lines to go to Italy and plead with Charles to come to their aid. Henry, Count of Saxony, Charles' chief man in Germany, marched to Paris. Weakened by marching during the winter, Henry's soldiers made only one abortive attack in February before retreating. The besieged forces sallied forth and to obtain supplies. Morale of the besiegers was low and Sigfred asked for sixty pounds of silver. He left the siege in April. Another Viking leader, Rollo, stayed behind with his men. In May, disease began to spread in the Parisian ranks and Gozlin died. Odo then slipped through Viking-controlled territory to petition Charles for support; Charles consented. Odo fought his way back into Paris and Charles and Henry of Saxony marched northward. According to Joshua J. Mark, \\"at some point in 886 CE, Odo returned with the armies of Charles the Fat. He fought his way through the Viking forces and into the city with his men; the Vikings in quick pursuit. Odo organized an immediate defense and the Danes were again driven back to their ships \\" Henry died, however, after he fell into the Viking ditches, where he was captured and killed.Bradbury (1992) p. 46 That summer, the Vikings made a final attempt to take the city, but were repulsed. The imperial army arrived in October and scattered the Vikings. Charles encircled Rollo and his army and set up a camp at Montmartre. However, Charles had no intention of fighting. He allowed the Vikings to sail up the Seine to ravage Burgundy, which was in revolt. When the Vikings withdrew from France the next spring, he gave them 700 livres (pounds) of silver as promised,Davis (2001) p. 55Logan (1991) pp. 131‚Äì132 amounting to approximately 257 kg.One \\"livre d'estelin\\" or \\"livre de Charlemagne\\", the standard used from c. 800 to c. 1350, is equivalent to 367.1 g (Zupko 1990, p. 346). Converted, 700 livre equals 257 kg (700 * .3671 = 256.97). Aftermath The Parisians and Odo refused to let the Vikings down the Seine and the invaders had to drag their boats overland to the Marne to leave the country. When Charles died in 888, the French elected Odo as their king. Odo's brother, Robert I of France, was later elected king as well, in opposition to the Carolingian Charles the Simple. Throughout the next century, the Robertians, descendants of Robert the Strong, remained leading figures in West Francia and eventually took the throne permanently when Robert I's grandson, Hugh Capet, was elected king in 987.

They were based in Lancaster, Pennsylvania and toured extensively. The lasting legacy of Reg Kehoe and his Marimba Queens is in \\"A Study In Brown\\", a two- minute black-and-white film made in early 1940 (link below). One of hundreds of \\"Soundie\\" films, they were printed backwards (mirror image) so they could appear correct when played in a Panoram machine (an early film jukebox about the size of a refrigerator) which employed a series of mirrors to reflect an image from a projector onto a 27-inch, reverse-projection, etched-glass screen in the tight, enclosed cabinet. \\"A Study In Brown\\" was also shown in movie houses as a bonus before the main feature. Reg Kehoe and His Marimba Queens played from about 1938 to 1955 and was a popular act, starting and ending each yearly tour with appearances at Hersheypark in Hershey, Pennsylvania. In between, the troupe played along the East Coast and throughout the Midwest, traveling by bus, making the rounds of the major dance halls‚Äîincluding in Chicago The Aragon, Willowbrook (Oh Henry Ballroom), Melody Mill, Midway Gardens and Trianon. Stealing the show in \\"A Study In Brown\\" was 'hep-cat' bass player Frank DiNunzio, Sr., of Hershey, Pennsylvania, who played his standup‚Äìslap bass almost until his death in February 2005. The woman playing the marimba next to the maraca player, Grace Bailey, in the film is Reg's wife, Fern Marie, who died in July 2006. On the back marimba is Joyce Shaw on the upper, Ruth Hauser on the middle octave, and Janet Yonder on the lower. On the side marimba, Madee Greer is on the upper and Polly Weiser on the lower. The reappearance of a grainy copy of the haunting \\"A Study In Brown\\"‚Äîwhich is now in the public domain‚Äîon Internet video sites has sparked a resurgence in curiosity and interest among a new legion of fans, and has rekindled the band's fame. Most viewers notice the sound is not necessarily synched to the video. This is because when making Soundies the artist first recorded an acceptable copy of the audio, then various camera takes were made using different camera angles and closeups as the performers lip-synched the lyrics and acted as though playing the instruments. The results were edited to create the appearance of several cameras doing the filming, when in most cases one camera was used. This films was shown at many Army Camps. No other Panoram recordings made by Reg Kehoe and his Marimba Queens are known to exist. Thanks to their two-minute \\"soundie\\", the legacy of the Marimba Queens lives on. The band played its last engagement at the Bedford Springs Hotel, Bedford, Pennsylvania in 1962. NOTE: Reg Kehoe and his Marimba Queens did make additional recordings in the 1940s.

The medium-height, masonry gravity dam is one of the largest non-federal hydroelectric dams in the U.S. The dam sits about from the river mouth at the Chesapeake Bay, south of the Pennsylvania border and northeast of Baltimore, on the border between Cecil and Harford counties. The dam supports a 9,000-acre reservoir, which today covers the original town of Conowingo. During dam construction, the town was moved to its present location about northeast of the dam's eastern end. The rising water also would have covered Conowingo Bridge, the original U.S. Route 1 crossing, so it was demolished in 1927. U.S. Route 1 now crosses over the top of the dam. The Conowingo Reservoir, and the nearby Susquehanna State Park, provide many recreational opportunities.  Construction and hydroelectric power generation  Postcard of dam The area, which appears on a 1612 map by John Smith, was originally known as Smyth's Falls. On January 23, 1925, Philadelphia Electric Company awarded the construction contract for the dam to Stone & Webster of Boston, who did the design. Construction, which started in 1926, was carried out by Arundel Corporation of Maryland. (Abandoned railroad tracks for transporting heavy equipment to the dam site can be seen along the western shore of the river below the dam.) When completed in 1928, it was the second- largest hydroelectric project by power output in the United States after Niagara Falls.\\"A Hydro Plant That Rivals Niagara.\\" Popular Science Monthly, November 1930, p. 49. Some 5,000 workers flocked to this rural northeastern corner of Maryland, seeking to earn good pay as construction got underway. In addition to those working directly on the dam, large numbers relocated railroad tracks, paved new roads, and constructed steel towers to stretch the mighty transmission lines toward Philadelphia. This was nearly fifty years before Congress passed the Occupational Safety and Health Act, which guaranteed the right to a safe job. While these men struggled to earn a living, many suffered disabling injuries handling high voltage electric lines, tumbling from high elevations, managing explosives, encountering poisonous snakes, and much more. When Maryland Public Television aired its documentary, \\"Conowingo Dam: Power on the Susquehanna\\" for Chesapeake Bay Week in April 2016, the question came up about how many workers died performing their duties. While investigating the death of Hunter H. Bettis on November 26, 1927, Darlington Coroner Wiliam B. Selse commented in the Baltimore Sun that more than twenty men had lost their lives. In an attempt to create a registry or census of job-related fatalities, death certificates, newspaper accounts, and funeral home books were examined. Fourteen individuals were identified. The dam was built with 11 turbine sites, although only seven turbines were initially installed, driving generators each rated for 36 megawatts. A turbine house, on the southwestern end of the dam, encloses these seven units. One additional \\"house\\" unit provides 25 Hz power for the dam's electric railroad system (identical to that used by the Pennsylvania Railroad, which had an electrified line [now under Norfolk Southern ownership] running on the eastern shore). In 1978, four higher-capacity turbines were added. Each drives a 65-megawatt generator, increasing the dam's electrical output capacity from 252 to 548 megawatts. The four newer turbines are in the open air section at the northeast end of the powerhouse. The generators produce power at 13,800 volts. This is stepped up to 220,000 volts for transmission, primarily to the Philadelphia area. The dam currently contributes an average of 1.6 billion kilowatt-hours annually to the electric grid. Through subsidiaries and mergers, the dam is now operated by the Susquehanna Electric Company, part of Exelon Power Corporation. The current Federal Energy Regulatory Commission license for the dam was issued in 1980 and expired in 2014. The Conowingo Hydroelectric Station would be a primary black start power source if the regional PJM power grid ever had a widespread emergency shutdown (blackout).  Flood control  Spillway on east side of the dam The dam has 53 flood control gates, starting at the northeastern end of the powerhouse and spanning the majority of the dam. The flood gates are operated by three overhead cranes rated for each and built by the Morgan Engineering Company of Ohio. The cranes run on rails the length of the dam and are electrically powered from lines that run above the face of the dam. An additional crane was recently (c. 2006) installed at the power house end of the rails, which required installing new power rails below the existing power wires. As of 2017, all new overhead cranes have been installed with the original Morgan cranes removed and scrapped. The new cranes have backup generators installed on them to allow operation during a facility grid power failure. In 1936, all the flood gates were opened for the first time. During Hurricane Agnes, in 1972, all 53 flood gates were opened, for only the second time, and explosives planted to blow a section of the weir, as the waters rose during the early morning hours of June 24 within of topping the dam (a record crest of , above normal level for the entire long Conowingo Reservoir.) Paul English, dam superintendent, released a bulletin at 10:30 p.m. on June 23 saying that the water levels were reaching a point at which the stability of the dam \\"cannot be controlled. When it reaches ...it will be in the hazy area...It is not known...whether a structure of the dam may give and...people downstream should be advised.\\"http://www.portdeposit.org/?a=history_detail and The Baltimore Sun, June 24, 1972 At this time, the flow sensor in the dam recorded its record discharge of , and the stream height gauge, at the dam's downstream side, registered a record . On January 20, 1996, the gauge recorded its second- highest recorded crest of . A severe ice jam also developed behind the dam on this date. The record minimum recorded discharge was on March 2, 1969, when the flow sensor registered . On September 9, 2011, 44 flood gates were opened due to the impact of the remnants of Tropical Storm Lee. The Susquehanna River behind the dam was , the third-highest in history. The town of Port Deposit, located 5 miles southeast of the dam, was evacuated. On July 26, 2018, 20 of the 53 floodgates were opened due to rising floodwaters resulting from several days of torrential downpours in the Mid-Atlantic. The Susquehanna saw water levels of over , placing nearby cities, like Port Deposit, MD, at risk of flooding like in 2011. The ecological impact of this event is not known, but Chesapeake Bay ecologists are concerned about the health of the Chesapeake Bay with the influx of sediment and limiting nutrients, such as phosphorus and nitrogen, impacting water clarity and promoting algal blooms. The Coast Guard issued warnings for all vessels in the Chesapeake Bay regarding the fields of debris, floating and submerged, that had been released when the floodgates opened.  Ecology and environmental impacts  View north on US 1 just before crossing the dam The river water impounded by the dam forms the long Conowingo Reservoir, known locally as Conowingo Lake. The reservoir is used as a drinking water supply for Baltimore and the Chester Water Authority; as cooling water for the Peach Bottom Nuclear Generating Station; and for recreational boating and fishing. In low rainfall or drought conditions, balancing the desire to maintain the reservoir level with the water flow needs for the downstream ecology is one of the challenges faced by the dam operators. The Conowingo Dam, and to a lesser extent the Holtwood and Safe Harbor Dams further upstream, stopped migratory fish species, especially American shad, from swimming further up the Susquehanna River to spawn. In 1984, a fish capture feature was added at Conowingo and shad were trucked upstream above all three dams and released. This program ended in 1999. A fish lift was installed in 1991. All three dams completed installation of fish lifts in time for the 2000 season. During the 2000 migration season, 153,000 American shad passed through the Conowingo fish lift. \\"However, passage rates of shad from Conowingo to Holtwood have been only 30 to 50 percent, suggesting that fish are having difficulty moving upstream in the waters of the Conowingo pool.\\" The three dams are also involved with another ecological concern. Normally, the reservoirs above each dam trap sediment and nutrients that run off from the watershed and prevent some of that from reaching the Chesapeake Bay. A 1998 USGS study suggests that they may reach capacity before 2020, and cease to reduce the nutrient and sediment load hitting the bay. However, the scouring of major floods, and other factors, affect this.

CRREL also provides technical support to non-government customers. CRREL arose from a consolidation of three antecedent organizations whose purpose was to understand frozen ground, permafrost, snow and ice as factors which were important in strategic northern areas during the Cold War. In its first 25 years CRREL researchers contributed to the understanding of polar ice caps, permafrost, and the engineering technology for developing natural resources in cold climates, such as Alaska. More recently, CRREL researchers have made contributions to science in climate change, the understanding of wave propagation for sensor systems, the control of snow on structures and ice in navigable waterways, and the environmental remediation of military installations. Mission areas The stated mission of CRREL is to \\"solve interdisciplinary, strategically important problems of the US Army Corps of Engineers, Army, DOD, and the Nation by advancing and applying science and engineering to complex environments, materials, and processes in all seasons and climates, with unique core competencies related to the Earth's cold regions.\\" Eagle River Flats, near Anchorage, Alaska.

Facilities Evaluation of surfactants to control oil on ice-infested water within the refrigerated test basin of the Ice Engineering Facility. The main facility is located in Hanover, New Hampshire, north of Dartmouth College. The facilities include: * Cold Rooms for experimentation on frozen materials * A Frost Effects Research Facility (FERF), devoted to the study of large-scale soil systems, like pavements. * An Ice Engineering Facility (IEF), which is devoted to the study of ice effects in navigable waterways, hydrology and hydraulics problems, flooding and other matters that may result from ice formation. * A Remote Sensing and Geographic Information System (RS/GIS) facility * A permafrost tunnel near Fairbanks, Alaska. Other laboratories cover chemistry, biology, and civil engineering topics. CRREL maintains an office at Fort Wainwright, near Fairbanks, Alaska, and an office at the Army Corps of Engineers Alaska District in Anchorage, Alaska. History CRREL was formed on 1 February 1961 from a merger of the earlier Snow, Ice and Permafrost Research Establishment (SIPRE)SIPRE (Snow, Ice, and Permafrost Research Establishment) with the Arctic Construction and Frost Effects Laboratory (ACFEL). Antecedents and establishment Cold room for studying snow and ice at SIPRE CRREL's antecedents and establishment were chronicled in an official history. In 1944-53 the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers established three independent organizations that were the antecedents to CRREL. Within its New England Division, the Corps of Engineers founded the Frost Effects Laboratory to \\"coordinate research on the effects of frost on the design and construction of roads, airfields and structures in frost-affected areas,\\" based in Boston, Massachusetts, in 1944. The Corps of Engineers' St. Paul (Minnesota) District established its Permafrost Division in 1944 to determine design methods and construction procedures for the construction of airfields on permafrost. The Corps established SIPRE (the Snow, Ice and Permafrost Research Establishment) in 1949, which moved to Wilmette, Illinois, in 1951. Its purpose was to \\"conduct basic and applied research in snow, ice and frozen ground.\\" In 1953, the Corps merged the Frost Effects Laboratory and Permafrost Division of the St. Paul District to establish ACFEL (the Arctic Construction and Frost Effects Laboratory) in Boston. In 1959, SIPRE researchers participated in the establishment of Camp Century in Greenland to study technical and scientific issues with a facility, based on the Greenland Ice Cap. Having built a new facility for the combined SIPRE and AFCEL organizations, the Corps established CRREL on 1 February 1961 in Hanover, New Hampshire, 1961-1986 Thermal drill used to bore into the Greenland ice sheet at Camp Century During its first quarter century, CRREL researchers and staff were active in the Arctic, Antarctica, Alaska and the Great Lakes, providing climatic history data, addressing resource extraction issues and extending winter navigation. =Drilling through ice caps= In 1966, CRREL researchers successfully drilled through the Greenland ice cap to a depth of . The effort took three years, but provided a continuous ice core that represented more than 120,000 years. This extended the ability of scientists to interpret climatic history and became an early source of information about global climate change. In 1968, the same CRREL team was the first to penetrate the Antarctic ice cap, after drilling through over of ice, providing a climatic record at a second location on the globe. =Facilitating Alaska North Slope oil development= heat pipes traversing discontinuous permafrost in Alaska The 1967 discovery of oil north of Alaska's Brooks Range raised two basic questions that CRREL was positioned to answer as a consultant to participating oil companies: how to extract oil from frozen terrain, permafrost, or from under the perennially frozen Beaufort Sea, and how best to transport the crude oil to the continental U.S. for refining and consumption. CRREL staff members participated in the exploration of two transportation options, the use of an ice-breaking oil tanker, and the use of an over-land pipeline that would cross much of Alaska over regions of permafrost. As for the Beaufort Sea, CRREL researchers conducted studies of the properties and behavior of arctic sea ice, which would present a problem for off-shore drilling operations. CRREL researchers were active participants in both voyages of the icebreaking oil tanker SS Manhattan to assess the feasibility of the sea transport option. At the same time, CRREL engineers reviewed and advised the federal inspector of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline. During the construction of the pipeline, CRREL researchers studied the engineering implications of foundations and roadways over permafrost and ice. =Freshwater navigation= In the 1970s CRREL supported a Corps of Engineers initiative to extend navigation through the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Seaway throughout the winter. They developed methods to address icing of locks and the clogging of waterways with floating ice that included booms, bubblers, and coatings of locks. =Cold War role= Move of DYE 2 radar facility to new foundations on the Greenland ice cap CRREL played a role in assisting the U.S. Air Force to establish and maintain a system of Distant Early Warning (DEW) Line facilities during the Cold War era. In 1976, a CRREL researcher was instrumental in the moving of a 10-story-high, 3,300-ton DEW Line facility on the Greenland Ice Cap from a foundation that had been compromised by the movement of the ice on which it was built to a new foundation. In 1984, CRREL personnel completed their survey reports for 31 sites of the new North Warning System that replaced the DEW line. A continuing scientific exchange between CRREL and Soviet cold regions research institutions began in 1972, these included the Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute in Leningrad and Permafrost Research Institute in Yakutsk. 1986-present CRREL's second 25 years saw the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the end of the Cold War and a shift in funding that reduced the emphasis of direct appropriations from Congress to a greater reliance on reimbursement for research from CRREL's customers, as evidenced by the sponsorship of its technical reports. Customers funding CRREL research included various components of the U.S. Army, Air Force and Navy. In addition, civilian agencies turned to CRREL for research answers, including the National Science Foundation, the Environmental Protection Agency, and NASA. In addition, a variety of private organizations funded CRREL research to solve problems that they faced. CRREL's list of technical reports lists 27 topical categories, covering science and engineering. =Military research= Army vehicle maneuvering in thawing conditions CRREL continued to grow its capability to serve the U.S. military with programs in signal propagation that would facilitate the detection of enemy movements via infrared imaging, radar, acoustics or seismic sensors in any meteorological conditions. It served the environmental needs of the U.S. Army by facilitating the identification and clean-up of contaminants on training lands, due primarily to partially detonated explosives or unexploded ordnance (UXO). Other researchers addressed mobility issues with vehicles over snow and muddy terrain. CRREL researchers participated in defining tactical runway requirements for the C-17 military transport aircraft. =Civilian research= Ice station SHEBA base, Canadian Coast Guard Ship Des Groseilliers (right) with CCGS Louis S. St-Laurent ICESCAPE crew crosses meltwater ponds to retrieve airdropped supplies, July 2011. Research Civil Engineer monitoring the acceptance tests of the Phoenix Runway for wheeled aircraft at McMurdo Station as a Boeing C-17 takes off. CRREL staff continued to make a mark in polar research, both in the Arctic and Antarctic. In the Arctic, CRREL researchers were active in modeling shipping in the Northern Sea Route and the Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic Ocean (SHEBA) experiment, conducted in the Arctic Ocean from October 1997 to October 1998 to provide polar input to global climate models. Other researchers performed traverses of Antarctica and Greenland to collect data, pertinent to global climate change. In 2010, a CRREL researcher was co-chief scientist on another icebreaker-based scientific mission, called \\"Impacts of Climate Change on Ecosystems and Chemistry of the Arctic Pacific Environment\\" or ICESCAPE, to determine \\"the impact of climate change on the biogeochemistry and ecology of the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas.\\" Other CRREL researchers developed ways to upgrade and maintain the research facilities of the U.S. National Science Foundation in Antarctica, including the design and construction of a new South Pole Station and developing criteria to allow modern aircraft to land on snow runways. CRREL staff explored and helped develop a new overland supply route across the Ross Ice Shelf over the Antarctic Range and the Antarctic ice cap to lower the cost of supplying the South Pole Station. In 2016, CRREL research civil engineers designed, built and tested a new snow runway for the McMurdo Station, called \\"Phoenix\\". It is designed to accommodate approximately 60 annual sorties of heavy, wheeled transport aircraft. In its Corps of Engineers Civil Works mission, CRREL researchers developed innovative ways to avoid ice jams and databases to address the widespread occurrence of such problems. A substantial ice engineering facility was built to support modeling of these problems. A remote-sensing and GIS (geographic information system) facility and organization were established to better employ the resources of satellite imagery and mapping of information to address problems worldwide. Another major facility, the Frost Effects Research Facility, was built to study problems associated with airfields and roadways, subject to freeze-thaw. An automated loading machine was acquired to simulate the passage of vehicle and aircraft tires on pavements. In building technology, researchers helped develop statistical means to identify snow and icing loads throughout the United States and standards for measuring heat loss, roof moisture detection, and frost-protected shallow foundations. =Realignment= In October 1999, CRREL became a member of an umbrella organization of Corps of Engineers laboratories, called the Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC). The consolidation of seven laboratories, the Coastal and Hydraulics, Environmental, Geotechnical and Structures, and Information Technology Laboratories in Vicksburg, Mississippi; the Construction Engineering Research Laboratory in Champaign, Illinois; CRREL in New Hampshire; and the Topographic Engineering Center in Alexandria, Virginia, established the ERDC in four geographic sites around the country. =Remediation of trichloroethylene spills= Originally, CRREL cold-room facilities used trichloroethylene (TCE) as a refrigerant. At the time there were few known environmental hazards attributed to TCE. Subsequently, TCE has been identified as a carcinogen. In 1970, an industrial accident resulted in a spill of approximately 3,000 gallons of TCE. In 1978, TCE was introduced into the ground via an experimental well. After the 1990 discovery of TCE in groundwater, CRREL embarked on a remediation plan, approved by the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services (NHDES), with assistance from the U.S. Army Toxic and Hazardous Materials Agency and the Corps of Engineers New England Division. NHDES reports that CRREL no longer stores TCE on site and the remediation of TCE in the groundwater is subject to monitoring in test wells. According to an Army press release cited in the local newspaper, the Army expanded monitoring of TCE at other locations on the CRREL campus and found some elevated readings in 2011. Thereafter, they initiated a monitoring well and soil sampling program to map the concentrations of the substance on the site. The information gained should lead to a new cleanup strategy for the site, according to the 2012 report. Army environmental specialists have detected TCE at neighboring residential and school properties.

Early life Robert Lee Thaves was born on October 5, 1924, in Burt, Iowa, where his father, John, published local newspapers. His father died when he was 13. Thaves' desire to become a cartoonist began in his childhood. He had no formal training; instead, he practiced by studying and drawing the works of other cartoonists. He was so skilled he could identify the cartoonist of a comic strip without looking at the signature. He attended the University of Minnesota, where he received both a bachelor's and master's degree in psychology. His cartoons were published in the university humor magazine Ski-U-Mah and newspaper The Minnesota Daily. During World War II, Thaves served in Europe in the Army's 89th Infantry Division. He married his wife Katie in 1954, and moved with her to Manhattan Beach, California three years later. He enrolled in the Ph.D. program at the University of Southern California, but left before completing his degree due to the success of his business career. Career While still at college, the first of his cartoons was printed in magazines. He continued to be interested in cartooning, and developed the Frank and Ernest strip while working as an industrial psychologist, occasionally selling comics to publications such as the Saturday Evening Post, True, and Cosmopolitan. Frank and Ernest began appearing in magazines as early as the 1960s. It was first nationally syndicated on November 6, 1972. Frank and Ernest's distributor, United Media, said that the strip was carried by more than 1,300 newspapers and read by 25 million people. It was the first single panel strip to appear in the \\"panel\\" format, and the first to use block letters for its dialogue. He also drew the short-lived King Baloo strip, which ran during the 1980s. Co-created with Scott Stantis, its format was identical to Frank and Ernest, but featured the titular King. His son Tom began collaborating with him on Frank and Ernest in 1997. The elder Thaves had planned on transitioning his son to take over the strip before his death. Ginger Rogers quote In a 1982 Frank and Ernest comic strip, Thaves wrote about Fred Astaire: \\"Sure he was great, but don't forget that Ginger Rogers did everything he did, backwards‚Ä¶ and in high heels.\\" The official Ginger Rogers website credits Thaves and uses his original line. Often the quote is incorrectly attributed to Faith Whittlesey. Sometimes the quote is attributed to Ann Richards, who popularized the line in her 1988 Democratic National Convention speech, paraphrasing it as: \\"But if you give us a chance, we can perform. After all, Ginger Rogers did everything that Fred Astaire did. She just did it backwards and in high heels,\\" though Richards credited television journalist Linda Ellerbee for giving her the line. Ellerbee said she heard the line from a fellow passenger on an airplane.Keyes, Ralph (2006) The Quote Verifier: Who Said What, Where, and When. New York: St. Martin's Griffin. p. 77 Awards He won several awards for Frank and Ernest including the National Cartoonist Society Newspaper Panel Cartoon Award for 1983, 1984 and 1986. He won the H.L. Mencken Award for the best cartoon in 1985 and he was selected as \\"Punster of the Year\\" in 1990. Death Thaves died of respiratory failure in Torrance, California at the age of 81. Tributes Several comic strips paid tribute to Thaves in the weeks after his death in 2006: Candorville on August 14; Arlo & Janis on August 29, and Prickly City (a strip written by his King Baloo collaborator Scott Stantis) on September 10.

In hopes of improving the image of the regime in Western circles, the government authorized some fake democratic openings, such as the creation of the MUD, in October 1945. The opposition groups were already organized in the Movement of National Antifascist Unity (MUNAF), which was quickly replaced by the MUD. The MUD quickly developed a strong structure, based on local committees at district, parish and neighborhood level. Initially, MUD was dominated by the moderate elements of the opposition, but soon the Portuguese Communist Party became the main force inside the Movement. The growing influence of the MUD in the Portuguese society, combined with the strong anti-communist action of the government, led to the banning of MUD in January 1948. In 1946, the MUD created a youth wing, the Juvenile MUD (Portuguese: MUD Juvenil or MUDJ). This wing was the most influenced by the Communist Party.

Biography Prince was born and raised in Los Angeles, California. After graduating as valedictorian from Dixie College (St. George, Utah), he served a two-year mission in Brazil for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- day Saints (LDS Church) at age 19. Upon returning to the United States in 1969, Prince attended graduate school at the University of California, Los Angeles, receiving a D.D.S. (valedictorian) in 1973 and a Ph.D in pathology in 1975. In 1975 he and his wife, JaLynn Rasmussen, moved to Washington D.C., for a post-doctoral fellowship at the National Institutes of Health. After spending more than a decade at NIH and Johns Hopkins University, he co-founded Virion Systems, Inc. (VSI), a biotechnology company focused on the prevention and treatment of pediatric infectious diseases. Building on discoveries that Prince made as a doctoral student, VSI pioneered the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) disease in high-risk infants through the use of monoclonal antibody. (RSV is the primary cause of infant pneumonia throughout the world.) VSI's technologies were licensed to MedImmune, Inc., and the collaborative efforts of the two companies and other partners resulted in the approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration of Synagis, a drug that is currently given to approximately a quarter-million high-risk infants throughout the world each year. Prince currently serves as president and CEO of VSI. In 2008, Prince and his wife established the Madison House Autism Foundation, named after their youngest son who is autistic, for the purpose of addressing the perplexing issues facing adults with autism, along with those facing family members, caregivers and society at large. Prince serves on the boards of several non-profit institutions including the National Advisory Council, Dixie State University; the National Advisory Board, J. W. Marriott Library, University of Utah; the National Presidential Advisory Board, Utah Valley University; the Dean's Advisory Council, University of Utah School of Dentistry; and the Board of Governors, Wesley Theological Seminary. In the 2010s, Prince began to call for a better understanding, within the views common among Latter-day Saints, of certain causal relationships between biology and sexual orientation. In recognition of his lifetime achievements, Prince was inducted into the Dixie State College Hall of Fame in 1999, and in 2012 was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Humanities by the same institution. In 2013 he was named Alumnus of the Year of the UCLA School of Dentistry, and in 2017 he was given the Distinguished Service Award by Utah State University. Prince was one of several leading figures in Mormon studies interviewed for the PBS documentary The Mormons. He lives with his family in Potomac, Maryland. Publications Prince is the author of over 150 scientific publications in the field of infectious diseases, the majority dealing with RSV. He has also published several articles on religious history and theology, as well as five books in the same field: Having Authority: The Origins and Development of Priesthood During the Ministry of Joseph Smith (1993); Power from On High: The Development of Mormon Priesthood (1995); David O. McKay and the Rise of Modern Mormonism (2005), co-authored with William Robert Wright; Leonard Arrington and the Writing of Mormon History (2016); and Gay Rights and the Mormon Church: Intended Actions, Unintended Consequences (2019).

After 1560, when Ieyasu abandoned the Imagawa, Kazumasa then became a valued retainer and administrator under him. In 1562, when Ieyasu managed to convince Imagawa Ujizane to release his family, Kazumasa acted as guardian of the Imagawa, which at the time was a very dangerous task. By 1567, the majority of daimy≈ç forces in the Tokugawa armies were organized in two divisions, each with a separate commander. Kazumasa was placed over the forces of 13 Tokugawa daimy≈ç- vassals and his counterpart, Sakai Tadatsugu, was given command over the forces of 18 daimy≈ç-vassals. He participated in the 1572 Battle of Mikatagahara. and 1575 Battle of Nagashino. After Toyotomi Hideyoshi's victory over Shibata Katsuie in 1583, Ieyasu expressed his congratulations to Hideyoshi through Kazumasa. Later, Kazumasa and Sakakibara Yasumasa accordingly issued statements attacking Hideyoshi, due to the Tokugawa's decision. Kazumasa served at the Komaki headquarters during the Komaki- Nagakute Campaign. In 1585, Kazumasa, very dismayed by what he saw as Tokugawa's foolhardy path of resistance against Toyotomi Hideyoshi, switched sides to Hideyoshi. This inconvenienced Ieyasu, who had to reconstruct his military organization and defensive policies, since Kazumasa had significant knowledge about their organization.

He is among the most notable Slavicists of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and the first to prepare complete monographs on the history of Polish language and culture. He published more than 1,500 titles and discovered the oldest extant prose text in Polish (the Holy Cross Sermons). Life Br√ºckner was born in Brze≈ºany (Berezhany) in Galicia, Austrian Empire, to an Austro-Polish family who had moved there from Stryj three generations earlier. He studied at the German Gymnasium in Lemberg (Lw√≥w) under Omelian Ohonovsky, in Vienna under Franz Miklosich, and in Berlin under Vatroslav Jagiƒá. Br√ºckner first taught at Lemberg (Lw√≥w University). In 1876 he received a doctorate at the University of Vienna, and in 1878 his habilitation for a study on Slavic settlements around Magdeburg (Die slawischen Aussiedlungen in der Altmark und im Magdeburgischen). In 1881 he received professorship at the Berlin Universary, where he long held (1881‚Äì1924) the chair in Slavic Philology. He received funds for travel and studies from his University and he resided in Berlin continuously for 58 years until his death. He was a member of many learned societies, including the Polish Academy of Learning in Krak√≥w, the Saint Petersburg Academy of Sciences, the Shevchenko Scientific Society in Lemberg, and the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, as well as academies in Prague and Belgrade. Br√ºckner wrote extensively in both Polish and German on the history of the Slavic languages and literature, on folklore, ancient Slavic and Baltic mythology, and on the history of Polish and Russian literature. His most important works include a history of the Polish language (Lemberg, 1906), several histories of Polish literature in Polish and German, a history of Russian literature, an etymological dictionary of the Polish language (S≈Çownik etymologiczny jƒôzyka polskiego, 1927), works on Slavic and Baltic mythology, an encyclopedia of Old Poland, and a 4-volume history of Polish culture (Krak√≥w, 1930‚Äì46). Br√ºckner was a specialist on the older periods of Polish and Slavic culture and was the discoverer, interpreter, and publisher of the oldest known manuscript in Polish, the Holy Cross Sermons. He had an incomparable knowledge of medieval Polish literature, which he knew from the original manuscripts, and was an expert on Renaissance and early modern Polish literature. In general, Br√ºckner tried to raise the prestige of old Slavic culture both in the eyes of the Germans among whom he worked and in the eyes of the Poles with whom he sympathized. He was critical of the Russian autocracy and the centralized Russian state of his time, including the Russian liberals (Kadets) who supported a centralized state and opposed either federalism or national autonomy for the non-Russian peoples of the Russian Empire. During the First World War, he favored the Central Powers but opposed the Treaty of Brest- Litovsk, which he believed was largely directed against a resurgent Poland and, moreover, made deep concessions to the Ukrainians in his native eastern Galicia. It was, however, scholarship, not politics, which always remained his main concern. On the most central questions of Slavic scholarship, he believed that in ancient times the Slavic and Baltic languages had a common ancestor and he always stressed this common Balto-Slavic bond. He placed the original homeland of the Slavs farther west than most Slavists, on the territory of today's Poland. He believed that the apostles to the Slavs, Cyril and Methodius, had originated the idea of their mission on their own, and he played down the invitation from Moravia; and finally, in a polemic with the Ukrainian historian Mykhailo Hrushevsky, he took a Normanist position on the origins of the Rus', stressing the linguistic and historical evidence for a Scandinavian connection. In 1924, he retired from the university and spent most of his time writing concise histories of Polish culture and language, especially of the Old Polish period. After his death in Berlin, his final book, a short German-language synthetic history of Polish culture, went unpublished. Bibliography * Aleksander Br√ºckner 1856-1939 ed.

Anderson is the author of the biography The Life of Brigham Young. The book is an account written sixteen years following Brigham Young's death in 1877. In this volume, Young's activities during his early years in Mormonism are discussed; his close relationship with Joseph Smith; and the rise of his leadership following Smith's death. Anderson was born in Billeberga, Sweden. His family joined The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) when he was young and they came to Utah Territory in 1864 in William B. Preston's Mormon pioneer company. In 1869, Anderson was baptized a member of the LDS Church. He lived in Millcreek, Farmington and Huntsville, Utah, in his early years. He graduated from the University of Utah in 1877 and then became a teacher in Weber County, Utah. In 1881, he married Jane Ballantyne, a daughter of Richard Ballantyne, the founder of the LDS Church's Sunday School movement. In about 1880, Anderson entered the newspaper business in Ogden, Utah. He later served on the staff of The Contributor. From 1890 to 1892, Anderson served as president of the Scandinavian Mission of the LDS Church. In 1893, he became a member of the Young Men's Mutual Improvement Association (YMMIA) General Board and in 1899 succeeded B. H. Roberts as associate editor of the Improvement Era. In 1900, Anderson became a member of the Weber Stake High Council. Anderson served in the YMMIA until 1907. Anderson was still listed as co-editor of the Improvement Era in 1922, with Heber J. Grant, the President of the LDS Church, listed as the other editor.Clark, James R., Messages of the First Presidency, Vol. 5, p. 219 In addition to his biography of Brigham Young, Anderson also wrote A Brief History of the Church. Andrew Jenson also included some of writings by Anderson in his Latter-day Saints Biographical Encyclopedia.See, e.g., vol. 1, p. 66 where a sketch on the life of Joseph F. Smith by Anderson appears, and vol. 1, p. 136 where Anderson's byline is inserted at the end of the article on Francis M. Lyman. Anderson served as the clerk of the LDS Church's general conference on several occasions in the 1910s and 1920s.See, e.g., 1927 Conference Report. In 1900, Anderson was elected to the Utah House of Representatives. He was appointed surveyor-general for Utah, a federal appointment, in 1901. Anderson and his wife Jane had seven children.

The plot centers around a \\"Mandroid\\" constructed by an evil scientist from the body of a downed pilot, who teams up with the scientist responsible for android technology, her pet robot Spot, a riverboat guide, and a martial arts warrior. Plot After returning from a scouting mission in a time machine, the Mandroid gives a Roman centurion shield to his master Abbot Reeves. Reeves orders the Mandroid to be dismantled (killed), but Reeves' assistant Takada tries to help the Mandroid to escape. Although Takada dies in the escape attempt, he tells the Mandroid to seek scientist Col. Nora Hunter for help in stopping Reeves from enacting an evil plan. In the U.S., the Mandroid finds Hunter and reveals himself to her. She believed Reeves to be dead and recognizes her designs for a Mars probe in the Mandroid. She repairs damage done to the Mandroid in his escape. The Mandroid plans to return to stop Reeves' evil plans (whatever they may be) and Hunter insists on accompanying him as his mechanic. She also brings along S.P.O.T., a small flying scout robot of her own design. Arriving in Mexico, Hunter hires the best river boat captain she can find in a seedy bar, one Harry Fontana, and they head down a river. After running afoul of rival riverboat captains and Reeves' men, they end up finding the Mandroid's crashed plane after an encounter with a tribe of cavemen brought to this time by Reeves' time travel experiments. They also meet Kuji, the ninja son of Doctor Takada, who has come to find his father. The Mandroid informs him that his father is dead, killed by Reeves. He joins the group, which then storms Reeves' headquarters, only to be captured by Reeves, now a cyborg himself, more advanced than the Mandroid, whose body is designed to look like Roman armor. Reeves plans to travel back to ancient Rome and become the new Caesar. The Mandroid fights Reeves and is quickly defeated. Badly damaged, the Mandroid sacrifices his life to free the rest of the group. They pursue Reeves to his laboratory just in time to watch him escape to ancient Rome in his time machine. In frustration, Fontana smashes the laboratory control panel, causing the time machine to overshoot its target date and maroon Reeves hundreds of millions of years in the past.

It is sold under a variety of trade names and is used as a thickener and emulsifier in various food and cosmetic products, and also as a bulk-forming laxative. Like cellulose, it is not digestible, not toxic, and not an allergen. In 2017, it was the 272nd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than one million prescriptions.  Uses  Methyl cellulose has a wide range of uses.  Medical  Constipation = Methyl cellulose is used to treat constipation. Effects generally occur within three days. It is taken by mouth and is recommended with sufficient water. Side effects may include abdominal pain. It is classified as a bulk forming laxative. It works by increasing the amount of stool present which improves intestinal contractions. It is available over the counter. A month supply in the United Kingdom costs the NHS about ¬£5.30 as of 2019. It is sold under the brand name Citrucel among others. = Artificial tears and saliva = The lubricating property of methyl cellulose is of particular benefit in the treatment of dry eyes. Solutions containing methyl cellulose or similar cellulose derivatives are used as substitute for tears or saliva if the natural production of these fluids is disturbed. = Medication manufacturing = Methyl cellulose is used in the manufacture of drug capsules; its edible and nontoxic properties provide a vegetarian alternative to the use of gelatin. Consumer products Thickener and emulsifier = Methyl cellulose is very occasionally added to hair shampoos, tooth pastes and liquid soaps, to generate their characteristic thick consistency. This is also done for foods, for example ice cream or croquette. Methyl cellulose is also an important emulsifier, preventing the separation of two mixed liquids because it is an emulsion stabilizer. Methyl cellulose is also used as paint rheological modifier to prevent paint sagging. =Food= The E number of methyl cellulose as food additive is E461. E464 is hydroxypropylcellulose and more soluble in water. Methyl cellulose, as a gel, has the unique property of setting when hot and melting when cold. Methyl cellulose is used as an ingredient in some meat analogues that are intended to replicate the texture of meat. = Lubricant = Methyl cellulose may be used in personal lubricant.  Construction materials  Methyl cellulose finds a major application as a performance additive in construction materials. It is added to mortar dry mixes to improve the mortar's properties such as workability, open and adjustment time, water retention, viscosity, adhesion to surfaces etc. Construction grade methyl cellulose is not to be identified with food and pharmaceutical grade methyl cellulose and hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, as it may be cross-linked with glyoxal for easy dispersion in water. The construction materials can be cement-based or gypsum-based. Notable examples of dry mixture mortars which utilize methyl cellulose include tile adhesives, EIFS, insulating plasters, hand-troweled and machine-sprayed plaster, stucco, self-leveling flooring, extruded cement panels, skim coats, joint & crack fillers, and tile grouts. Typical usage is about 0.2% ‚Äì 0.5% of total dry powder weight for dry mixtures. Derivatives of methyl cellulose which improve performance characteristics include hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC) and hydroxyethyl methyl cellulose (HEMC). These derivatives typically improve the characteristics such as water retention, vertical surface slip resistance, open time, etc. = Glue and binder = Methyl cellulose can be employed as a mild glue which can be washed away with water. This may be used in the fixing of delicate pieces of art as well as in book conservation to loosen and clean off old glue from spines and bookboards. Methyl cellulose is the main ingredient in many wallpaper pastes. It is also used as a binder in pastel crayons and also as a binder in medications. = Paper and textile sizing = Methyl cellulose is used as sizing in the production of papers and textiles as it protects the fibers from absorbing water or oil.  Cell culture Methyl cellulose is also used in cell culture to study viral replication. It is dissolved in the same nutrient- containing medium in which cells are normally grown. A single layer of cells is grown on a flat surface, then infected with a virus for a short time. The strength of the viral sample used will determine how many cells get infected during this time. The thick methyl cellulose medium is then added on top of the cells in place of normal liquid medium. As the viruses replicate in the infected cells, they are able to spread between cells whose membranes touch each other, but are trapped when they enter the methyl cellulose. Only cells closely neighboring an infected cell will become infected and die. This leaves small regions of dead cells called plaques in a larger background of living uninfected cells. The number of plaques formed is determined by the strength of the original sample. = Bacterial and protozoal motility inhibitor = Aqueous methyl cellulose solutions have been used to slow bacterial and protozoal cell motility for closer inspection. Changing the amount of methyl cellulose in solution permits the adjustment of the solution's viscosity. = Stem cell differentiation = Methyl cellulose is used in the most common approaches to quantify multiple or single lineage-committed hematopoietic progenitors, called colony-forming cells (CFCs) or colony-forming units (CFUs), in combination with culture supplements that promote their proliferation and differentiation, and allow the clonal progeny of a single progenitor cell to stay together and thus form a colony of more mature cells. Chemistry It is a hydrophilic white powder in pure form and dissolves in cold (but not in hot) water, forming a clear viscous solution or gel. Methyl cellulose is used as a buffer additive in capillary electrophoresis to control electroosmotic flow for improved separations.  Special effects  The slimy, gooey appearance of an appropriate preparation of methyl cellulose with water, in addition to its nontoxic, nonallergenic, and edible properties, makes it popular for use in special effects for motion pictures and television wherever vile slimes must be simulated. In the film Ghostbusters, the gooey substance the supernatural entities used to \\"slime\\" the Ghostbusters was mostly a thick water solution of methyl cellulose. The Aliens ooze and drip a great deal of methyl cellulose‚Äîespecially the queen. Methyl cellulose has been used to safely simulate molten materials, as well. In several of the Terminator films, it was back-lit with colored gels and films to reproduce the heated glow of iron in the large pouring ladles used to transport the metal from the smelting ovens to the various molds and forms. Methyl cellulose was also a stand-in for the lava flows in Los Angeles in Volcano and on the volcanic surface of Mustafar, in Star Wars: Episode III ‚Äì Revenge of the Sith.  Chemistry  Methyl cellulose does not occur naturally and is synthetically produced by heating cellulose with caustic solution (e.g. a solution of sodium hydroxide) and treating it with methyl chloride. In the substitution reaction that follows, the hydroxyl residues (-OH functional groups) are replaced by methoxide (-OCH3 groups). Different kinds of methyl cellulose can be prepared depending on the number of hydroxyl groups substituted. Cellulose is a polymer consisting of numerous linked glucose molecules, each of which exposes three hydroxyl groups. The Degree of Substitution (DS) of a given form of methyl cellulose is defined as the average number of substituted hydroxyl groups per glucose. The theoretical maximum is thus a DS of 3.0, however more typical values are 1.3‚Äì2.6. Different methyl cellulose preparations can also differ in the average length of their polymer backbones.  Solubility and temperature  Methyl cellulose has a lower critical solution temperature (LCST) between 40 ¬∞C and 50 ¬∞C. At temperatures below the LCST, it is readily soluble in water; above the LCST, it is not soluble, which has a paradoxical effect that heating a saturated solution of methyl cellulose will turn it solid, because methyl cellulose will precipitate out. The temperature at which this occurs depends on DS-value, with higher DS-values giving lower solubility and lower precipitation temperatures because the polar hydroxyl groups are masked. Preparing a solution of methyl cellulose with cold water is difficult however: as the powder comes into contact with water, a gel layer forms around it, dramatically slowing the diffusion of water into the powder, hence the inside remains dry. A better way is to first mix the powder with hot water, so that the methyl cellulose particles are well dispersed (and so have a much higher effective surface area) in the water, and cool down this dispersion while stirring, leading to the much more rapid dissolution of those particles.

Looking west from Clinton Street towards Manhattan Bridge Cherry and Catherine Streets, 1848 Cherry Street is a one-way street in the New York City borough of Manhattan. It currently has two sections, mostly running along parks, public housing, co-op buildings, tenements, and crossing underneath the Manhattan Bridge overpass. Description Cherry Street's eastern terminus is at the intersection of FDR Drive's southbound service road and Grand Street, where it bends right and turns into Cherry Street. It then runs west for one block, along the north edge of Corlears Hook Park, to Jackson Street. Then it is demapped for approximately two blocks, from Jackson Street to Gouvernour Street and Gouvernour Street to Montgomery Street (with the Vladeck Houses built over demapped section). It continues west, running parallel to the FDR Drive and one block north of it, for three blocks, to Pike Street/Slip. Afterward, it runs west from Pike, under the Manhattan Bridge access ramp, one block to Market Street; Cherry Street then goes one block further west, parallel to and one block north of Water Street. Cherry Street has its western terminus here, at its intersection with Catherine Street/Slip. History Cherry Street was originally established in colonial times to run from the intersection of Pearl Street and Frankfort Street in Lower Manhattan, approximately east to Grand Street in Corlear's Hook. The section between Pearl Street and Catherine Street was removed block-by-block due to development, starting with the building of the Brooklyn Bridge in the 1860s. The removed section now contains the Alfred E. Smith Houses. The section between Jackson Street and Montgomery Street, was also removed and demapped to provide for Vladeck Park. Vladeck Park was subsequently replaced with Vladeck Houses, a public housing building complex project. The two demappings left a \\"widowed\\" one block stretch of Cherry at the eastern end, from Montgomery to the FDR Drive South service lane, which bends into Cherry Street as it ends. Prior to the constructions of the FDR, both Cherry Street and Grand Street extended a short distance further east than they now do, and met each other at the riverbank. The street was named for the cherry orchard that sat on the general location that was owned by Goovert Loockermans, a wealthy Dutch merchant who was the New Amsterdam representative of the Amsterdam trading firm of Gillis Verbrugge & Company in the 1660s. Cherry Street was renamed for Firefighter Robert Foti in honor if his sacrifice on September 11, 2001. Notable places Loockermans' heirs sold the land in 1672 for $60.00. Richard Sackett acquired part of it, and opened a beer garden and a bowling green which became known as \\"Sackett's Orchard\\". In 1785, the four-story mansion at 3 Cherry Street was leased by the Continental Congress to serve as the Executive Mansion for Richard Henry Lee, President of the Congress under the Articles of Confederation. It continued to serve as such for the next three Presidents and, in 1789 served as the first Executive Mansion for the President of the United States, George Washington, and Martha Washington.Chorlton, Thomas Patrick, The First American Republic 1774-1789 The mansion belonged to Col. Samuel Osgood, the first Postmaster General of the United States. Another house on Cherry Street, later demolished, was the first gas-lit house in Manhattan, owned by Samuel Leggett, a founder of Con Edison. The house was served via gas pipe from Pearl Street. Though Cherry Street once ran through to Pearl Street, it has since been terminated at Catherine Street due to the Civic Square development. In 1818, Henry Sands Brooks opened H. & D. H. Brooks & Co. on the northeast corner of Catherine and Cherry Streets in Manhattan \\"to make and deal only in merchandise of the finest body, to sell it at a fair profit, and to deal with people who seek and appreciate such merchandise.\\"Advanced Market Training January 25th, 2011 Notable Business Series ‚Äì Brooks Brothers In 1850, his three sons, Elisha, Daniel, and John, inherited the family business and renamed the company \\"Brooks Brothers,\\" which is the oldest men's clothier chain in the United States. Young Irving Berlin lived at 330 Cherry Street with his family for years. In the 1930s, the first \\"superproject\\" development proposal in New York City was initiated for the Cherry Street area of Corlear's Hook. The Vladeck Houses, 24 six-story buildings, built on the former Vladeck Park, were completed in 1940. They were a precursor to the larger Unit Plans for public housing that predominated in later decades, including the Alfred E. Smith Houses that occupy the other \\"lost\\" section of Cherry Street. A $50 million renovation of the Vladeck Houses began in 1998. Cherry Street also traverses the Rutgers Houses and La Guardia Houses. All three of these large-scale housing projects are NYCHA developments. Currently, the majority of structures along Cherry Street are residential co-op apartments, public housing, and older tenement buildings south of the Manhattan Bridge.

Serving as the administrative center of the Koziatyn Raion (district), the town itself is not a part of the district and is separately incorporated as the town of oblast significance, and is located from oblast capital, Vinnytsia, at around (approximately from Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine). It lies on the banks of the Huyva River. Population: History The village of Koziatyn was first mentioned in 1734. The city was founded at the time of construction of Kyiv-Baltic railway. Koziatyn became a town of the Berdychiv district of Kyiv Governorate on July 7, 1874. In April 1920, during the Polish-Bolshevik War, the town was captured by Polish forces in what became known as the Raid on Koziatyn. In 1923 Koziatyn became the district center of Berdychev okrug. A few years later, the district was included in the Vinnitsa Oblast. Economic details Railway office in Koziatyn A total of 13 railways, 5 industrial, and more than 150 private enterprises build up Koziatyn's vivid economy. The reason behind the abundant economic growth is town's unique location on an intersection of major railways. The railroad business accounts for 90% of town's budget income.

Movius in 1948 to demonstrate a technological difference between the early prehistoric tool technologies of the east and west of the Old World. Movius had noticed that assemblages of palaeolithic stone tools from sites east of northern India never contained handaxes and tended to be characterized by less formal implements known as chopping tools. The most noticeable difference were the lack of Acheulean/Mode 2 tools in East Asia. These were sometimes as extensively worked as the Acheulean tools from further west but could not be described as true handaxes. Movius then drew a line on a map of India to show where the difference occurred, dividing the tools of Africa, Europe and Western and Southern Asia from those of Eastern and South-eastern Asia. Movius also proposed that the lack of Middle Paleolithic tools in East Asia could be due to a techno-cultural connection between Acheulean and Levallois traditions in tool manufacture. Similarly, research in 2006 showed that there are significantly fewer handaxe sites in East Asia than in East Africa and India. Fossil evidence also suggests a difference in the evolutionary development of the people who made the two different tool types across the Movius Line and it has remained in use as a convenient distinction between the two traditions. The existence of the line, both in terms of stone tool technology and human evolution has needed to be explained. Theories to explain the existence of the Movius Line include the idea that perhaps the ancestors of the toolmakers who settled in eastern Asia left Africa before the handaxe was developed. Alternatively the settlers moving to Asia may have known how to make handaxes but passed through a 'technological bottleneck', that is a region where suitable materials to make them were lacking. The skills were thus forgotten and isolation by distance meant that the knowledge was never re-introduced. An alternate theory states that rather than stone axes, early humans in east Asia used bamboo tools instead. Exceptions New archaeological evidence from Baise, China and Jeongok-ri, South Korea has shown that handaxes were also used in eastern Asia. Stone tools found at Ban Don Mun in the Lampang province of northern Thailand have trifacial elements which are a short step from the bifacial aspects of African hand axes. It is possible that the environmental differences on either side of the Movius line prompted the invention of hand axes in one area and choppers in another.Zeitoun V, Forestier H, Rasse M, Auetrakulvit P, Kim J and Tiamtinkrit C 2013. The Ban Don Mun artifacts: A chronological reappraisal of human occupations in the Lampang province of Northern Thailand. Journal of Human Evolution 65(1) Also found in Thailand, in Sao Din, were various chopping and unifacial tools similar to those found in India, China, Korea, and southern Sumatra. The structure of the cobble artifacts are most comparable to the traditions found in China than to other traditions found in continental Asia or the southeastern Asian archipelago. These findings throughout the regions east of the Movius line brings to question the accuracy of the divide of Palaeolithic technological traditions.Zeitoun V, Forestier H, Auetrakulvit P, Khaokhiew C, Rasse M, Davtian G, Winayalai C and Tiamtinkrit C 2012.

He was born in Su≈°ak on March 24, 1914, and died in Zagreb on May 26, 2002. On account of his diverse social work, for his work as pianist, composer and editor, he was the recipient of numerous awards and recognitions. Life Ivo Maƒçek was born in Su≈°ak on March 24, 1914, and died in Zagreb on May 26, 2002. He inherited his love for music from his parents, Dr Pavao (1880‚Äì1932) and Marija Maƒçek n√©e Heffler (1892‚Äì1978). And while his father, a history and geography teacher, played \\"two or three instruments\\" in his youth, his mother learned piano and violin and played the viola in the Society Orchestra of the Croatian Music Institute in Zagreb until her death in 1978. In 1922, he started his music education with a private teacher, Vjekoslav Rosenberg-Ru≈æiƒá (1870‚Äì1954). From the very next year he went on studying the piano with Rosenberg-Ru≈æiƒá in the Junior Music School in Zagreb, and then in the Secondary Music School (1927‚Äì1931), and then at the High School of the State Music Academy in Zagreb. In 1934, just a year after graduating from the Second Classics High School in Zagreb, he took a certificate in the piano, his major, taking the Vjekoslav Klaiƒá Prize of the Croatian Music Institute as the best student of the year. When his course was over, Maƒçek went to Svetislav Stanƒçiƒá (1895‚Äì1970) for further studies, and then, although brought up in the tradition of the German pianistic school, he continued his studies in 1939 in Paris with the French pianist Alfred-Denis Cortot (1877‚Äì1962). With Cortot he mastered an interpretative technique that was always there to serve style and poetic idea. Amalgamating the best features of both schools, German precision, speed and huge sound, and French expressiveness and fine shading, Maƒçek developed into a pianist who avoided any endeavour to find favour with the public via superficial virtuosity. He was a refined interpreter, precise and readable in his performance, with a discreet and unobtrusive style. He gave concerts in many cities of Croatia and the former Yugoslavia as well as in Austria, Czechoslovakia, Egypt, France, Great Britain, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Lebanon, Poland, Slovakia and Switzerland. His career as a soloist lasted from 1926 to 1958. He broke a long period of silence as solo performer with a concert performance on October 30, 1994, when he gave the first performance of his own Concertino for Piano and Chamber Orchestra in the Croatian Music Institute in Zagreb accompanied by the Croatian Chamber Orchestra conducted by Pavle De≈°palj. Maƒçek took up chamber music in the Secondary Music School. In the context of the school's own performances from 1928 to 1933, the talented young pianist in his earliest chamber outings showed both musicality and a brilliant ability to accommodate his playing to the soloist. Later, as a leading chamber musician, he was founder-member of two celebrated piano trios. His collaboration with violinist Stjepan ≈†ulek and violinist Stanko ≈Ωepiƒá (from 1935 to 1939) started not long after the end of Maƒçek's studies at the Music Academy. They drew favourable comments from the public in a concert in the Croatian Music Institute on May 16, 1938, playing for the first time Maƒçek's Piano Trio. In the opinion of the reviewers, Maƒçek had shown in this compositional first-born that he had both talent and knowledge; he had successfully mastered the form, adroitly worked out the ideas in terms of motifs, made use of interesting harmonies and successfully combined the three instruments. The best known Croatian piano trio, Maƒçek ‚Äì ≈†ulek ‚Äì Janigro, was founded at Maƒçek's initiative. During their five years of working together (from 1940 to 1945) they interpreted works of different stylistic periods, opening up the roads for their own artistic maturation and virtuosity and the capacity for a profound understanding of what they performed. In association with cellist Antonio Janigro (1939 to 1941; 1944 to 1949) and Ludwig Hoelscher (1942), with Enrico Mainardi (1949 to 1950, 1953) and Mirko Dorner (from 1952 to 1953), Maƒçek stood out as an excellent, reliable and valuable accompanist. The most successful of all these associations was with Mirko Dorner, in a duo with whom he won the first prize at the 3rd international music competition in Vercelli (1952). After many years of absence from public musical life (he gave his last chamber concert in 1957), Maƒçek returned to the concert stage with the cellist Valter De≈°palj (from 1975 to 1979). During his chamber career, Maƒçek worked with the violinists Stjepan ≈†ulek, Ivan Pinkava, Zlatko Balokoviƒá, Zlatko Topolski and Aleksandar Szegedi, and created a celebrated piano duo with Jurica Murai (from 1952 to 1957). He also worked with vocal artists, such as the soprano Irma Turkoviƒá, the alto Marijana Radev, the tenor Mario Djuranec, the baritone Ivo Lhotka-Kalinski and the bass Tomislav Neraliƒá. Work Three composers were particularly influential in the shaping of Maƒçek's composing personality. He studied composition at the Music Academy in Zagreb with Franjo Dugan Sr (1874‚Äì1948), who, employing Romantic expressive resources in his oeuvre, also used elements of Baroque polyphony as a support on which to hang firmly rounded forms. Thanks to a French government scholarship from 1939 to 1940, he went on with his studies with Jean Jules Aimable Roger-Ducasse (1873‚Äì1954), who, as composer, was uncompromising in rejecting the sentimental outpourings of late Romanticism and its conservative patterns and developed his style on elements of what was then up-to-date French music. In 1942 Maƒçek went to Salzburg to Joseph Marx's (1882‚Äì1964). The music of this Austrian composer breathed the spirit of French Impressionism, and successfully conjoined the beauty of lush melody with harmonic refinement. The composing personality of Ivo Maƒçek was formed in a classical mould. He drew on the best patterns of earlier centuries, but also paid heed to the speech of his time. In his creative work he did not aspire for radical changes, had a circumspect attitude to contemporary musical trends and did not show any experimental audacity in his work. His oeuvre comprises sixteen compositions, two for choirs, six for piano, seven for various chamber ensembles, and one composition for piano and chamber orchestra. The two choral compositions are in fact motets in the classical polyphonic style: Gressus meos, for a four-part mixed choir, and Confortamini for a five-part mixed choir, composed during his composition studies at the Music Academy in Zagreb (in 1934). The piano compositions of Ivo Maƒçek are good examples of his composing poetics. They reflect a composer who had developed while creating music primarily via the piano medium. Unlike the Romantic saturation of the piano texture of his earlier compositions (Intermezzo, 1935; Improvisation, 1937; Theme and Variations, 1939), the later compositions (Sonatina, 1977; Sonata, 1985; Prelude and Toccata, 1987 and Concertino for piano and chamber orchestra, 1991) had a lighter and more transparent facture, dominated by thematically more profiled ideas. In the piano oeuvre of Maƒçek, it can be seen that his music expression is the consequence of a mixture of styles. While in the earlier works, within the Romantic expressiveness, he shows a sensitivity for Impressionist colourism, he wrote the later works within the context of neo-Classicist patterns filled with a unique bitonality, polymeters and polyrhythms, with a flat dynamics or full of energy. The major part of his oeuvre is made up of chamber compositions: Piano Trio (1935), Sonata for Violin and Piano (1955), 1st String Quartet (1980), Sonata for Violin and Piano (1985), Wind Quintet (1987), Wind Trio (1994) and 2nd String Quartet (1997). They are perhaps the best example of the evolutionary line of Maƒçek‚Äôs composing work. The first Maƒçek chamber composition, Trio for Violin, Violoncello and Pianoforte, is an example of his re-interpretation of the Romantic heritage, while the last five compositions are marked by the style of neo-Classicism. Sonata for Cello and Piano is alone between these two periods of his work (the first from 1935 to 1940 and the second from 1977 to 1997). In it one can feel on the one hand a connection with the Romantic orientation of the earlier compositions and on the other an inkling of the neo-Classicist features of his later compositions. The chamber compositions of Ivo Maƒçek reflect a pianist composer, who through chamber playing became familiar with different instruments, their capacities and technical problems. His works are characterised by richness of invention and power of imagination that followed his emotions. Maƒçek as a teacher In parallel with his career in piano and in composing, Ivo Maƒçek had a third string to his bow, the educational. His work in education was started when he was a teacher of piano at the Lisinski Private Music School in Zagreb (1936‚Äì1939). Working as a rehearsal pianist in the National Theatre in Zagreb in 1940, Maƒçek took over the duty of trainee music teacher in the Third Boys' Real High School. He had the same duties in school year 1940‚Äì41 in the Secondary School of the Academy of Musical and Theatrical Art in Zagreb. From 1941 to 1945 he worked as music teacher at the Secondary Music School of the Music Academy. In the period from 1943 to 1945 he was employed as piano teacher in the Army Piano School in Zagreb. Then from 1945 to 1950 he was assistant professor (dozent) in piano at the Music Academy, and in 1950 to 1959 associate professor. He became full professor in 1961 and from 1967 to his retirement in 1977 he was head of department for piano and organ. Inheriting the best characteristics of his own teachers, as an educator Ivo Maƒçek developed his pupils' natural capacities and trained a series of well known concert pianists and teachers. In addition to all this, Maƒçek found time to edit sheet music compositions of other composers. He edited the following editions: Six and Twelve Little Preludes, Johann Sebastian Bach; F√ºr Elise; Sonata in F minor op. 2, no. 1; Sonata in C minor op.10, no 1; Sonata in F major op. 10. no 2; Sonata in D major op. 10, no. 3; Sonata in C minor (Path√©tique), op.13; Sonata in E major op. 14, no. 1; Sonata in G major op. 14, no. 2; Sonata in C sharp minor op. 27, no. 2; Sonata in G minor op. 49, no 1; Sonata in G major, op. 49, no. 2; Sonata in G major op. 79 of Ludwig van Beethoven and Piano Works of Josip ≈†tolcer-Slavenski in two volumes. Maƒçek's contributed much to society. The most important and responsible functions were confided to him. He was the first president of the Federation of Music Artists of Yugoslavia (1950) and the long-term president of the Association of Music Artists of Croatia (1950 ‚Äì 1951; 1955 ‚Äì 1960). As a versatile and high level music artist he was elected, for his musical culture, knowledge and capacity, a corresponding member (fellow) of the Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts (1954), afterwards a full member (1983). As well as all this, Ivo Maƒçek found time to carry out the duties of a delegate of the Council for Education at the final examinations of secondary music schools. In addition, from 1968 to 1970 he taught music, as guest professor, at the international music seminars of the Franz Liszt College of Music in Weimar. He was a member of juries of numerous competitions for young pianists at home (Contest of Music Artists of Yugoslavia) and abroad (the Tchaikovsky in Moscow in 1962 and the Chopin Competition in Warsaw in 1965, the Busoni in Bolzano in 1965 and the Johann Sebastian Bach Competition in Leipzig in 1964 and 1968).

This party dissolved itself on 11 November 1945.  Background  The Vietnamese Communist Party was founded on 3 February 1930 by uniting the Communist Party of Indochina (despite its name, this party was active only in Tonkin) and the Communist Party of Annam (active only in Cochinchina). Thereafter, the Communist League of Indochina (active only in central Annam) joined the Vietnamese Communist Party. However, the Comintern argued that the communist movement should be promoted in the whole of French Indochina (including Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam) rather than only in Vietnam, therefore it urged the Vietnamese Communist Party to transform itself into the Indochinese Communist Party.\\"Ho Chi Minh and the Communist Movement\\" .  League for National Salvation of Vietnamese Residents of Kampuchea  The League for National Salvation of Vietnamese Residents of Kampuchea was a pro-Viet Minh movement of Vietnamese inhabitants in Cambodia. The organization emerged from a network of revolutionary committees formed among Vietnamese residents in the border areas of Cambodia towards the end of 1946. Such groups had emerged in places like Tak√©o Province, Prey Veng Province and southern Kandal Province. The League for National Salvation of Vietnamese Residents of Kampuchea was set up as a front organization of the Indochina Communist Party in March 1947, merging the various local revolutionary committees.UQAM.

It was rebuilt in the 15th and early 16th centuries, with walls of flint rubble, stone and brick. The church has a tower with a spire and a ring of thirteen bells, twelve of which were cast by John Warner & Sons at Cripplegate and were dedicated in 1913.Centenary Peal at Chelmsford Cathedral The Ringing World No 5385 11 July 2014 p719 The nave partially collapsed in 1800, and was rebuilt by the County architect John Johnson, retaining the Perpendicular design, but using Coade stone piers and tracery, and a plaster ceiling. The upper part of the chancel was rebuilt in 1878. Cathedral The chancel In 1914 the church became the cathedral for the newly created diocese of Chelmsford. The south porch was extended in 1953 to mark Anglo-American friendship after World War II and the many US airmen stationed in Essex. In 1954, the cathedral was additionally dedicated to Saints Peter and Cedd. In 1983, the interior of the cathedral was extensively refurbished, with a new floor, seating, altar, bishop's throne, font and artwork. In 1994 and 1995 two pipe organs were installed, the first in the nave and the second in the chancel. The stained- glass windows were all installed in the 19th and 20th centuries. In 2000 a sculpture, Christ in Glory by Peter Eugene Ball, was placed above the chancel arch. In 2004 two further major works of art were commissioned, and are now in place: Mark Cazelet's Tree of Life painting in the North Transept, and Philip Sanderson's altar frontal in the Mildmay Chapel. The cathedral celebrates its links with Thomas Hooker, who was Chelmsford Town Lecturer between 1626 and 1629. He fled to the New World because of his Puritan views and founded the town of Hartford, Connecticut and was one of the founders of American democracy.

The highway runs from its southern terminus at a signalized intersection with U.S. Route 224 (US 224) on the Summit- Portage county line approximately south of Mogadore on the border of Springfield Township and Suffield Township to its northern terminus at a diamond interchange with Interstate 76 (I-76), at its exit 29 within the Tallmadge city limits. SR 532 was established in the late 1930s. Once a connector route that linked Akron to SR 8, the route is now merely a short connector linking I-76 to US 224\\\\. The portion of SR 532 that was removed from the state highway system continues from I-76 to the center of Tallmadge as Southeast Avenue. The route straddles the Summit-Portage county line from its southern terminus to where it bends into Summit County near the northern village limits of Mogadore. Route description This state highway is not included as a component of the National Highway System, a system of routes identified as being most important for the economy, mobility and defense of the country. History The SR 532 designation was established in 1937. Originally, the highway began at the intersection of Canton Road, at the time a segment of SR 8, and Tisen Road south of Mogadore. It followed Tisen Road east to where it turns north on the Summit-Portage county line and defaults into Portage Line Road, continuing north from that point up to US 224\\\\. SR 532 then utilized its entire present alignment, continuing northwest of where the I-76 interchange is located today along Southeast Avenue up to the downtown Tallmadge traffic circle. It continued from there northwest along Northwest Avenue and Tallmadge Road to the present SR 59 intersection, which at the time was a part of SR 5, in Cuyahoga Falls. SR 532 ran concurrent with SR 5 along Front Street northeast. Departing from SR 5, SR 532 traveled north out of Cuyahoga Falls by following Bailey Road to the northwest and the north, then turning to the southwest on Graham Road and traveling along that road a short distance to Wyoga Lake Road. The route then went north along Wyoga Lake Road to where it meets Akron-Cleveland Road, which in 1937 was a part of SR 8\\\\. That intersection marked the endpoint of SR 532. The shortening of SR 532 began in 1942, when the portions of the highway south of US 224 along Tisen Road and Portage Line Road were removed from the state highway system. Then, by 1981, with the impending completion of the SR 8 freeway in the vicinity of Cuyahoga Falls, all of SR 532 to the northwest of I-76 through Tallmadge and Cuyahoga Falls was eliminated. Consequently, at that point the state highway took on the status of short connector route between US 224 and I-76 that it has today.

A terrace consists of a flat or gently sloping geomorphic surface, called a tread, that is typically bounded on one side by a steeper ascending slope, which is called a \\"riser\\" or \\"scarp\\". The tread and the steeper descending slope (riser or scarp) together constitute the terrace. Terraces can also consist of a tread bounded on all sides by a descending riser or scarp. A narrow terrace is often called a bench.Howard, A.D., R.W. Fairbridge, J.H. Quinn, 1968, \\"Terraces, Fluvial‚ÄîIntroduction\\", in R.W. Fairbridge, ed., The Encyclopedia of Geomorphology: Encyclopedia of Earth Science Series, vol. 3. Reinhold Book Corporation. New York, New York.Jackson, J.A., 1997, Glossary of Geology. American Geological Institute. Alexandria, Virginia. The sediments underlying the tread and riser of a terrace are also commonly, but incorrectly, called terraces, leading to confusion. Terraces are formed in various ways. Fluvial terraces Fluvial terraces are remnants of the former floodplain of a stream or river. They are formed by the downcutting of a river or stream channel into and the abandonment and lateral erosion of its former floodplain. The downcutting, abandonment, and lateral erosion of a former floodplain can be the result of either changes in sea level, local or regional tectonic uplift; changes in local or regional climate; changes in the amount of sediment being carried by the river or stream; change in discharge of the river; or a complex mixture of these and other factors. The most common sources of the variations in rivers and streams that create fluvial terraces are vegetative, geomorphic, and hydrologic responses to climate. More recently, the direct modification of rivers and streams and their watersheds by cultural processes have resulted in the development of terraces along many rivers and streams.Blum, M., and T.E. Tonqvist, 2000, \\"Fluvial responses to climate and sea-level change, a review and look forward.\\" Sedimentology. v. 47 suppl. 1, pp. 2-48. Hypothetical valley cross-section illustrating a complex sequence of aggradational (fill) and degradational (cut and strath) terraces and deposits (upland gravels). Note ct = cut terraces, ft = fill terraces, ft(b) = buried fill terrace, fp = active floodplain, st = strath terrace, and ug = upland gravels. Kame terraces Kame terraces are formed on the side of a glacial valley and are the deposits of meltwater streams flowing between the ice and the adjacent valley side. Marine terraces A marine terrace represents the former shoreline of a sea or ocean. It can be formed by marine abrasion or erosion of materials comprising the shoreline (marine-cut terraces or wave-cut platforms); the accumulations of sediments in the shallow-water to slightly emerged coastal environments (marine-built terraces or raised beach); or the bioconstruction by coral reefs and accumulation of reef materials (reef flats) in intertropical regions.Pirazzoli, P. A., 2005, \\"Marine Terraces\\". in M. L. Scheartz, ed., pp. 632-633. Encyclopedia of Coastal Science. Springer, New York, New York. The formation of a marine terrace follows this general process: A wave cut platform must be carved into bedrock (high wave energy is needed for this process). Although this is the first step to the process for the formation of a marine terrace, not all wave cut platforms will become a marine terrace. After the wave cut platform is formed it must be removed from interaction with the high wave energy. This process happens by either change in sea level due to glacial-interglacial cycles or tectonically rising landmasses. When the wave cut has been raised above sea level it is preserved. The terraces are most commonly preserved in flights along the coastline.Clark, Alisha, Marine Terraces, University of California, Santa Cruz Island Geology and Geomorphology, accessed October 2013 Lacustrine terraces A lake (lacustrine) terrace represents the former shoreline of either a nonglacial, glacial, or proglacial lake. As with marine terraces, a lake terrace can be formed by either the abrasion or erosion of materials comprising the shoreline, the accumulations of sediments in the shallow-water to slightly emerged environments, or some combination of these. Given the smaller size of lakes relative to the size of typical marine water bodies, lake terraces are overall significantly narrower and less well developed than marine terraces.Bowman, D., 1971. \\"Geomorphology of the shore terraces of the late Pleistocene Lisan Lake (Israel)\\". Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology Palaeoclimatology. v. 9, no. 3, p. 183-209.Prieto, F.J.G., 1995, \\"Shoreline forms and deposits in Gallocanta Lake (NE Spain)\\". Geomorphology. v. 11, no. 4, p. 323-335. However, not all lake terraces are relict shorelines. In case of the lake terraces of ancient ice-walled lakes, some proglacial lakes, and alluvium-dammed (slackwater) lakes, they often represent the relict bottom of these lakes.Shaw. E.D., 1915, \\"Newly discovered beds of extinct lakes in southern and western Illinois and adjacent states\\". Bulletin no. 20, Illinois State Geological Survey, Champaign, Illinois, p. 139-157.Clayton, L., J.W. Attig, N.R. Ham, M.D. Johnson, C.E. Jennings, and K.M.

Journal of Quaternary Science. v. 24, no. 8, p. 960 - 981. Finally, glaciolacustrine kame terraces are either the relict deltas or bottoms of ancient ice marginal lakes.Bitinas, A. D. Karmaziene, and A. Jusiene, 2004, \\"Glaciolacustrine kame terraces as an indicator of conditions of deglaciation in Lithuania during the Last Glaciation\\". Sedimentary Geology. v. 165, no. 3-4, p. 285‚Äì294. Structural terraces In geomorphology, a structural terrace is a terrace created by the differential erosion of flat-lying or nearly flat-lying layered strata. The terrace results from preferential stripping by erosion of a layer of softer strata from an underlying layer of harder strata. The preferential removal of softer material exposes the flat surface of the underlying harder layer, creating the tread of a structural terrace. Structural terraces are commonly paired and not always associated with river valleys. Travertine terraces A travertine terrace is formed when geothermally heated supersaturated alkaline waters emerge to the surface and form waterfalls of precipitated carbonates.

He has produced hundreds of features over the course of his 15+ year career. He specializes in producing lesbian pornography as well as foot fetish videos. His popular titles include the Pink Velvet trilogy, the Unfaithful series, and The Art of Kissing series. The Story of She 2 starring British model Lexi Lowe was his best-selling movie of 2013.  Career  He has also produced an equal number of heterosexual works. The majority of his work was produced prior to the British government lifting some of the more stringent laws regarding what could be shown in pornographic films; when those laws were repealed in 1999, Thomas moved into producing hardcore material exclusively. However, after a court decision confirmed that R18 rated hardcore DVDs can only be sold via licensed sex shops in the UK, not mail-order via the internet, Thomas decided to move his whole operation from Acton, West London to Portugal. He also maintains a studio in Budapest. Thomas is known for producing artistic pornographic films with an emphasis on high production values and has been nominated for numerous awards and has won at the AVN awards in the past. His contemporaries include the established pornographic director/producers Andrew Blake, Michael Ninn and Marc Dorcel. Thomas' more recent work has starred almost exclusively Hungarian, Czech, and other Central European models, although he does feature some British performers, such as Ian Tate, as well as Americans such as the former Penny Flame. Other British models he has worked with include Lexi Lowe (Lowe worked exclusively with Thomas for the first year of her lesbian film career), Alicia Rhodes, Michelle Thorne, Kelle Marie, and Roxanne Hall. Central European models who are frequently featured in his videos include Eve Angel. His productions are distributed by Girlfriends Films (USA and the world) and Erigo Distribution (UK and Europe).

The theatre is widely known for having given birth to the acting careers of several notable actors and actresses, whose careers started at the Ring Theatre, including Steven Bauer, Ray Liotta, Sylvester Stallone and others. The theatre is named for University of Miami alumnus Jerry Herman, whose career on Broadway has included composing and other credits for scores for hit Broadway musicals, including Hello, Dolly!, Mame, and La Cage aux Folles. The theater was founded in 1946, and 2006 marks its 60th anniversary. Since its founding, the Ring has performed at three different sites. In addition to its current location, the Ring has been located previously in a circus tent and a round building used to train Allied navigators during World War II. The name for the Ring grew out of the company's first in-the-round performance, which placed the audience in a \\"ring\\" around the stage. The current building was designed by Robert M. Little and Marion M. Manley and constructed started in 1951 with completion in 1953.\\"Ring Around the Stage.\\" Popular Mechanics, December 1953, pp. 106-107. Its unusual circular design and first-of-its-kind, flexible seating arrangement drew national attention in the world of theater. The main building has a roof constructed of poured concrete that is held in place by a large 3 inch wide steel ban like the ban placed old wagon wheels in the 1800s and heated then shrunk. The Ring Theater was designed and built to withstand hurricanes with winds up to 250-mph. In the 1970s, the Ring permanently changed its seating configuration to three-sided thrust. After a complete renovation of the theatre house, the Ring has now returned to total flexibility and offer three different kinds of staging as well as three seating arrangements. While the theatre itself is named for Jerry Herman, the new stage was named the Alvin Sherman Family Stage in honor of Alvin Sherman's generous support of the renovation project. The Ring Theatre is served by the Miami Metrorail at the University Station.

Going by the name Toni Lanier, she became known in Hollywood circles for her extramarital relationship with future husband MGM studio head Eddie Mannix, who was married at the time to Bernice Fitzmaurice. Following Fitzmaurice's death in 1937, Lanier moved in with Mannix, the couple later marrying in 1951. It was not long after her marriage to Mannix that she began a notorious affair with actor George Reeves, also in 1951. Early life Mannix was born Camille Bernice Froomess on February 19, 1906 in New York City. Her father, Charles, was a French immigrant, and her mother, Elizabeth, was a French Canadian Roman Catholic. The large family would ultimately include 11 children: seven boys and four girls. The children were raised in their mother's faith. Mannix's father was a department store window decorator in Rochester, New York, and her mother was a homemaker.1920 U.S. Census Career For a time, Mannix was a Ziegfeld Follies showgirl, and appeared in the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer biography of Florenz Ziegfeld's life, The Great Ziegfeld (1936). Personal life As Toni Lanier, the Ziegfeld dancer and actress met MGM's general manager Eddie Mannix in the 1930s. She later lived with him as his mistress, and then as his wife, until his death in 1963. Shortly after her marriage to Mannix in 1951 and shortly before the launch of George Reeves as star of the successful television series Adventures of Superman, Mannix met and began an affair with Reeves, with the acquiescence of her husband, according to Reeves' co-stars Noel Neill and Jack Larson.Ward, Larry Thomas. Truth, Justice, & The American Way: The Life and Times of Noel Neill, The Original Lois Lane, Nicholas Lawrence Books, 2003. . p. 83 Reeves ended the affair in 1958 after meeting and starting a relationship with \\"B-girl\\" Leonore Lemmon in New York while he was travelling on business. His death by gunshot wound to the head five months later was officially ruled a suicide, although questions have been raised about the circumstances under which he died. Kashner and Schoenberger's partially fictionalized biography Hollywood Kryptonite states as unsourced fact that Mannix, via her husband's criminal connections, ordered Reeves murdered by a hit-man.Who killed Superman?, John Patterson, The Guardian, November 18, 2006 This theory was endorsed by publicist Edward Lozzi, who stated in 1999 that he had witnessed Mannix's deathbed confession. Although the 2006 film Hollywoodland uses Eddie Mannix's complicity as one possible solution to the Reeves mystery, the film remains ambiguous about the truth behind his death. Mannix was devastated by Reeves' death and remained dedicated to him, reportedly building a shrine to him in her house. Later years and death Mannix, wealthy following the death of her husband in 1963, developed Alzheimer's disease when she was in her seventies. She died in 1983 in Beverly Hills at the age of 77, having neither remarried nor having had children. She interred next to husband Eddie Mannix at Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City, California. Her crypt niche's memorial marker reads: \\"Camille Toni Mannix, 1906-1983, God Bless\\". Toni Mannix was portrayed in the 2006 film Hollywoodland by Diane Lane and by Alison Pill in the 2016 Coen Brothers film, Hail, Caesar!.

Career Olivier Coipiel started as a movie animator, working as an assistant on Balto (film) and then The Prince of Egypt, then as a full animator at The Road to El Dorado. Coipel came to prominence and significant controversy as the artist of the American DC Comics book Legion of Super-Heroes during the tenure of writers Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning., beginning with the \\"Legion of the Damned\\" story arc. Despite complaints about his art style by long-time Legion of Super-Heroes fans - who felt his style was \\"too rough and unrefined\\", leading to more than one prominent critic to refer to him as \\"Ol' Scratchy\\" - Coipel continued to draw the series when it was relaunched under the new title The Legion. Coipel signed an exclusive contract with Marvel Comics in January 2005. He was named in August 2005 as one of Marvel's \\"Young Guns,\\" a group of artists that included Jim Cheung, David Finch, Trevor Hairsine, Adi Granov, and Steve McNiven, which according to Marvel Editor-in-Chief Joe Quesada, exhibited the qualities that make \\"a future superstar penciller.\\" One of Coipel's first major works at Marvel was House of M, an eight issue New Avengers/X-Men crossover limited series with writer Brian Michael Bendis. Coipel was then announced as artist on a new Thor ongoing series that launched in July 2007 with writer J. Michael Straczynski. The title was nominated for an Eisner in 2009 in the category for Best Continuing Series\\"2009 Eisner Award Nominees Announced\\". Comic Book Resources. April 7, 2009. Coipel left the title in 2009 when it was announced Straczynski would be leaving. Coipel re- teamed with Bendis for the four-issue 2009 Marvel Comics event series Siege. In 2010, he provided art for a Magneto-focused backup story leading into the Young Avengers miniseries Avengers: the Children's Crusade, before returning to Thor in 2011, illustrating the first arc on Matt Fraction's The Mighty Thor. On April 9, 2011 Coipel was one of 62 comics creators who appeared at the IGN stage at the Kapow! convention in London to set two Guinness World Records, the Fastest Production of a Comic Book, and Most Contributors to a Comic Book. With Guinness officials on hand to monitor their progress, writer Mark Millar began work at 9am scripting a 20-page black and white Superior comic book, with Coipel and the other artists appearing on stage throughout the day to work on the pencils, inks, and lettering, including Dave Gibbons, Frank Quitely, John Romita Jr., Jock,\\"Kapow!

She is currently the co-director of graduate studies in the Department of Psychology at Georgetown University. Her research focuses on understanding the learning and memory mechanisms that develop during infancy. Because infants are preverbal, her techniques rely on imitation and learning methods to find out what infants have learned and how well and how long they remember it. Her previous research has focused on how infants pick up information from different media sources, television, siblings, adults, and different contexts. Most recently, Barr's studies focus on factors that might enhance infant learning from television. Barr's lab is called the Georgetown Early Learning Project. Information about the research conducted can be found at http://www.elp.georgetown.edu/. In 2005, Barr became part of the Sesame Beginnings Advisory Board, which included other \\"national child development and media experts\\".. This year also marked her involvement in the ZERO TO THREE Leaders Development Initiative. She is currently a reviewer for many popular and prestigious peer journals including: Journal of Experimental Child Psychology, Infant Behavior and Development, Developmental Psychobiology, Developmental Psychology, Developmental Science, Current Directions in Psychological Science, Archives of Pediatric and Adolescent Research, Child Development, Infant and Child Development. Her posters and presentations are often found at international child development conferences such as SRCD and ISIS. Her education includes a Ph.D. in Developmental Psychology (completed in 1998), Diploma in Clinical Psychology, and BSc. (Hons) in Psychology from the University of Otago.

Biography Palmer received his M.A. in American history from Brigham Young University (BYU) in 1968, writing his thesis on the Godbeite movement. He pursued doctoral studies from 1974 to 1975, but did not complete them. During his career Palmer was active in the Mormon History Association. Palmer's wife died of cancer in late 1992. He later remarried the former Connie ChristensenConnie's maiden name from her father's obituary. and they lived in Sandy, Utah. After retiring Palmer worked as a real estate developer. He died on September 25, 2017.http://www.larkinmortuary.com/obituary/grant-hart-palmer/ Career Initially Palmer was hired to teach history at the Church College of New Zealand. Shortly later he began teaching religion, which led to a 34-year career in the Church Educational System (CES). He was director of the LDS Institute of Religion in Whittier, California (1970‚Äì73) followed by Chico, California (1975‚Äì80). Returning to Utah, he then taught LDS seminary at East High School in 1980 and at Brighton High School from 1980 to 1988. During this time the infamous Salamander Letter surfaced, challenging the orthodox story of Mormon beginnings, though the letter was eventually found to be a forgery. As an ardent student of LDS history the letter caused Palmer to consider the influences of American folk magic on Joseph Smith's religious practices. In 1985 Palmer's research on this issue led him to write and circulate a manuscript called \\"New York Mormonism\\" under the pseudonym \\"Paul Pry, Jr.\\" which became the first draft of An Insider's View of Mormon Origins. As he grew uneasy with some aspects of LDS history, Palmer approached his CES supervisor about changing positions to teach adults at the Salt Lake County Jail. Teaching more general Christian and Biblical lessons of faith and ethics to all inmates, he was the jail's chaplain and director of its Institute program from 1988 until his 2001 retirement. He also served on the board of directors of the Salt Lake Legal Defenders Association. After completing his long-coming manuscript, he published the controversial book An Insider's View of Mormon Origins with Signature Books in 2002, in which Palmer challenged the orthodox teachings of Mormonism's beginnings. Palmer's prison teaching led him to write another book, The Incomparable Jesus, published by Greg Kofford Books in 2005. In 2003 An Insider's View was criticized by BYU's Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies (FARMS) in reviews written by Daniel C. Peterson, Davis Bitton, Steven C. Harper, Mark Ashurst-McGee, and Louis Midgley. These were published in the FARMS Review alongside an official statement from BYU's Joseph Fielding Smith Institute for Latter-day Saint History disagreeing with Palmer's conclusions. In the following Review issue, historian James B. Allen published another critical review.  Church discipline and resignation  Palmer asserts that he was disfellowshipped from the LDS Church in December 2004 as a result of his book, An Insider's View of Mormon Origins, which was skeptical of Mormonism's claimed origins (being disfellowshipped results in probational loss of some church privileges without being forced to leave the church). Palmer concluded that while he liked many of the teachings of Joseph Smith, \\"the foundational events in church history are too problematic to ignore\\". He found that much of what Latter Day Saints take for granted as literal history has, over the years, been modified to emphasize certain aspects over others. This, he believes, has resulted in an inaccurate picture of LDS Church history. Palmer argues also that the 'Mormon Jesus' is very different to the current Christian Jesus due to the modern practices of the LDS Church such as tithing, avoidance of alcoholic beverages and use of special clothing. At the time of his disfellowshipment, Palmer stated that he still loved the church, and was pleased he was not excommunicated. He also stated that he no longer attended church meetings specifically to avoid offending other members with his opinions as well as due to his rejection of standard LDS beliefs. In 2010, Palmer resigned his membership in the LDS Church.Grant H. Palmer, \\"Timeline of Events for Grant Palmer and the LDS Church\\", mormonthink.com.  Afterward  Critics of the LDS Church, and Palmer himself, have compared the disfellowshipment of Grant Palmer to the trial of Galileo Galilei by the Roman Catholic Church. In May 2006, a four-part interview of Grant Palmer was featured on John Dehlin's podcast Mormon Stories. This interview was followed in January 2007 with a five-part interview of Richard Bushman, historian and author of Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling, with Bushman's LDS-believing views presented in contrast to Palmer's skeptical take on Mormon origins. Palmer and Bushman were also among the wide range of people interviewed in the 2007 PBS documentary The Mormons. In 2008 Palmer wrote an article in The Salt Lake Tribune comparing the Mormon and Catholic Churches to the Pharisees, whose observance of strict laws and oral traditions was decried by Jesus. Palmer believed that, instead, a true belief in Christian religion is centered in individually becoming good and loving people. Palmer stated in a Mormon Stories interview in 2012 that due to the publication of a two and half page article in 2010, \\"Religious feeling and truth\\", for an obscure Baptist journal in Kansas City, a second disciplinary council was scheduled but Palmer handed in his resignation before the hearing was held. Several reasons led to his decision, mainly, that the first disciplinary council lasted an exhausting seven hours and he did not want to repeat that experience and also that the presiding authority of the second council let him know beforehand that to stay a member and avoid excommunication he would need to repudiate all of the details from his book and also regain his testimony of the church. After learning that Palmer had terminal cancer, John Dehlin promptly announced on February 3, 2017 that the Open Stories Foundation would organize an event to celebrate the life and works of Palmer, tentatively scheduled for February 15. He died September 25, 2017. Publications *.  * * Online reprint from MormonThink.com.

The land the tower was built on was intended to be part of the I. M. Pei Erieview urban renewal plan. The site was cleared in 1963 but was not developed and was used as a parking lot. It was sold to Medical Mutual by John W. Galbreath in 1979 to develop a \\"people oriented\\" office building. Ground was broken on October 30, 1980, and construction was completed in 1983. The tower's base is structured into a five-story glass garden atrium. It also houses a fitness center on the top two floors of the contiguous parking structure, and a 400-seat conference center named the Cleveland Metropolitan Bar Association Conference Center. One Cleveland Center also uses Citigroup Center-style diagonal trusses. During construction of One Cleveland Center, the trusses were added to make the One Cleveland Center more rigid and able to handle Cleveland's sometimes windy downtown conditions, especially in the winter months. One Cleveland Center also uses Citigroup Center-style skin. The Trusses can be seen at night when the building is lit up. In 2003, CNBC reported from One Cleveland Center about an investment banker named Frank Gruttadauria. Gruttadauria worked for Lehman Brothers at their Cleveland Offices, which are based at One Cleveland Center. Gruttadauria was charged with embezzlement of investment funds from the Fazio family who at one time owned a Cleveland-area chain of grocery stores. He served some time in Federal jail until his release in 2009. Renovations In 2009, it was announced that the plaza and landscaping of One Cleveland Center were to be renovated. Construction began in August 2009 when crews demolished the original 1983 designed plaza. In addition to the outdoor plaza, the 1983 lobby will also be renovated with new flooring, a new canopy entrance, and amenities such as an LCD display televisions and a news ticker in the lobby.

Brother Sun, Sister Moon was released exclusively on the iTunes Music Store in 2004. History In the early 1970s, Donovan agreed to write and record songs for the English version of Franco Zeffirelli's Brother Sun, Sister Moon (1972). The accompanying soundtrack album included none of Donovan's original recordings, as only the Italian version was released, with vocals by Claudio Baglioni and score by Riz Ortolani. The non-availability of the Donovan recordings prompted many of Donovan's fans to request an official release of the songs. To satisfy demand, Donovan embarked on acquiring the rights to the original recordings. Due to the nature of the original contract and complex publishing rights issues, it became evident to Donovan that releasing the original Brother Sun Sister Moon recordings would be extremely difficult. In the absence of this release, Donovan decided to record new versions of the original songs and release it exclusively through the iTunes Music Store. For the new recordings, Donovan opted not to recreate the lush orchestration and choir vocals of the original recordings. Instead, he plays guitar and sings solo, in a style reminiscent of his Sutras album.

Two trains collided, resulting in 11 deaths and 19 injured. Background Although the signalman on duty was ultimately responsible for the collision, there were several contributing factors. The layout of the section was complex, with four running lines and a junction between the main Warrington-Preston line and the Warrington-Earlestown branch line. Those two lines carried so much traffic that the signalman had a booking lad with him in the signal box, whose function was to keep the train register and use it to remind the signalman of the position of trains within the section at any time. Sequence of events Shortly after 9pm a local train from Warrington, destined for Wigan and drawn by 2-4-2 tank engine No. 6632, entered the section. It was due to be turned off onto the Earlestown branch line, but Signalman Bloor at the Winwick Junction signal box was already busy with no fewer than seven other trains, and probably engaged on the telephone to Warrington, discussing a necessary change to the running order to cater for an express freight train carrying perishable goods (fish). The local train therefore came to a halt at the Winwick Junction home signals, and Fireman Hayes left the train to walk to the signal box away to carry out Rule 55, by which he was to remind the signalman of the train's presence and ensure that it was protected. Before Hayes could reach the signal box, the signalman at Winwick Quay to the south rang Call attention for an express train from Euston to Blackpool. As the Regulations did not permit him to send the Is Line Clear? bell signal until he had received Train Out of Section for the local train, he intended to send the bell signal Shunt engine for following train to pass upon acknowledgment of Call attention, i.e. he expected Bloor to switch the local train temporarily to another running line and halt it while the express passed. However, Bloor forgot that the local train was standing at his signals, and thought that he had failed to clear his block instruments after a preceding train. He gave the reply, Train out of section and cleared his signals. The booking lad, E. Derbyshire, who was supposed to alert him to the position of the train, failed to do so. He too had been distracted by a telephone call about a weekly timetable change, and on hearing Bloor exclaim \\"Good Heavens! I haven't given the 2-1 [i.e. the train out of section call] here yet\\", he assumed that he himself had missed the passage of the local train. Instead of prompting Bloor that the train register entries for the local train were incomplete, which might have alerted Bloor in time to avert the collision, he used guesswork to fill in the register, indicating the local train was out of the section. When the Winwick Junction home signals cleared, Driver Hope of the local began moving forward slowly to pick up the fireman, but was struck by the express, drawn by LNWR Prince of Wales Class No. 25648, running at high speed. Even though the coaches of the local train were modern steel rolling stock, three of them were badly telescoped. The guard and five passengers in the local train, and three passengers in the express train were killed. Two passengers (it is not known from which train) later died in hospital. Aftermath Signalman Bloor readily admitted his responsibility, but the booking lad's assumption about train movement led the Inspector to recommend that booking lads should be made more aware that entries other than from personal knowledge should be verified with the signalman. The lack of a telephone at the signal post, or a track circuit which would have alerted the signalman that the track was occupied and prevented him accepting the express, was also a factor. The Inspecting Officer's report recommended that track circuits be installed at the junction. 1967 accident Another accident occurred at Winwick Junction in 1967. A passenger DMU collided with a goods train after failing to stop at a semaphore signal which, although \\"on\\", had jammed at approximately 17¬∞ to the horizontal. There were no fatalities or serious injuries. The official inquiry concluded that routine maintenance of the signal had been inadequate, and the signalman was at fault for not checking that the signal had properly returned to \\"Danger\\" when the lever was replaced. A similar accident, with much more serious consequences, occurred at Invergowrie in 1979.

Incompletely processed proteins and fats can build up, leading to a dangerous chemical imbalance called acidosis. Genetics Glutaric acidemia type 2 has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. Mutations in the ETFA, ETFB, and ETFDH genes cause glutaric acidemia type II. Mutations in these genes result in a deficiency in one of two enzymes that normally work together in the mitochondria, which are the energy-producing centers of cells. The ETFA and ETFB genes encode two subunits of the enzyme electron transfer flavoprotein, while the ETFDH gene encodes the enzyme electron transfer flavoprotein dehydrogenase. When one of these enzymes is defective or missing, the mitochondria cannot function normally, partially broken-down proteins and fats accumulate in the cells and damage them; this damage leads to the signs and symptoms of glutaric acidemia type II. This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means the defective gene is located on an autosome, and two copies of the gene ‚Äì one from each parent ‚Äì are needed to inherit the disorder. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive disorder are carriers of one copy of the defective gene, but do not show signs and symptoms of the disorder themselves. Diagnosis Glutaric acidemia type 2 often appears in infancy as a sudden metabolic crisis, in which acidosis and low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) cause weakness, behavior changes, and vomiting. There may also be enlargement of the liver, heart failure, and a characteristic odor resembling that of sweaty feet. Some infants with glutaric acidemia type 2 have birth defects, including multiple fluid-filled growths in the kidneys (polycystic kidneys). Glutaric acidemia type 2 is a very rare disorder. Its precise incidence is unknown. It has been reported in several different ethnic groups. Treatment It is important for patients with MADD to strictly avoid fasting to prevent hypoglycemia and crises of metabolic acidosis; for this reason, infants and small children should eat frequent meals. Patients with MADD can experience life-threatening metabolic crises precipitated by common childhood illnesses or other stresses on the body, so avoidance of such stresses is critical. Patients may be advised to follow a diet low in fat and protein and high in carbohydrates, particularly in severe cases. Depending on the subtype, riboflavin (100-400 mg/day), coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), L-carnitine, or glycine supplements may be used to help restore energy production. Some small, uncontrolled studies have reported that racemic salts of beta-hydroxybutyrate were helpful in patients with moderately severe disease; further research is needed.

They were part of a revivalist movement recreating mid-1960s to mid-1970s style funk and soul music. In December 2014, the band was nominated for a Grammy, in the category Best R&B; Album of the Year for Give the People What They Want. Sharon Jones died in 2016, with the band releasing the posthumous final album Soul of a Woman in 2017. Her backing band have since performed together live and worked with other artists. Desco: the early years In the mid-1990s, Philip Lehman and Gabriel Roth (aka Bosco Mann) founded a band called the Soul Providers, and began recording an album of James Brown-inspired instrumentals and vocal collaborations with deep funk recording artist Lee Fields. After hearing Sharon Jones, a former corrections officer turned singer,\\"Sharon Jones and the Dap-Kings Interview\\". Ace, September 14, 2010 record backing vocals for a Fields track, Lehman and Roth recorded a solo track of Jones singing \\"Switchblade\\", a song which had been intended for a man's voice. This track along with another Jones solo, \\"The Landlord\\", were included on the Soul Providers debut album Soul Tequila, released in about 1996 on the now-defunct French label Pure Records. Lehman and Roth then started a new label in Brooklyn, New York called Desco Records, with a studio and distribution office in the basement of the Desco vacuum cleaner store on West 41st Street. They reissued Soul Tequila as a vinyl-only LP and renamed Gimme the Paw, and included only one of the Jones collaborations, \\"Switchblade\\". Sharon Jones & the Dap-Kings at the Moers Festival 2007 Desco showcased its artists with revue-style shows and released their music on vinyl 45-rpm records. Jones, backed by the Soul Providers who had become the Desco house band, released three 45s for the label. Recording dates were deliberately omitted from the labels and the records were often marketed as being released in the 1970s. Two other Soul Providers albums were released, an instrumental soundtrack to a Sam Lung kung-fu film, The Revenge of Mr Mopoji, credited to Mike Jackson and the Soul Providers, and a solo album by Lee Fields, Let's Get a Groove On, for which the Soul Providers provided the backing.  Daptone: a new label and the birth of the Dap-Kings  In 2000 Lehman and Roth decided to part ways, and the Soul Providers disbanded. Lehman set up Soul Fire Records; Roth started Daptone Records with Sugarman 3 saxophonist Neal Sugarman. A new group, the Dap-Kings, was formed, consisting of label owners Roth on bass and Neal Sugarman on saxophone, plus original Soul Providers: guitarist Binky Griptite, organist Earl Maxton, percussionist Fernando Velez and trumpeter Anda Szilagyi. Joining them were original members of the Mighty Imperials whose album, Thunder Chicken, was the last release on the Desco label: tenor saxophonist Leon Michels and drummer Homer Steinweiss. The band secured a summer residency at The Boite, a club in Barcelona, Spain, and recorded an LP, Dap Dippin' with Sharon Jones and the Dap-Kings in 2001. A few hundred copies were pressed, so that sales during the residency would provide financial support for what would have otherwise been a financially draining trip. Promotional copies were sent to funk DJs and reviewers, and the album was officially released as the first LP and CD on Daptone Records in 2002, and attracted an enthusiastic review from quarterly hip-hop and funk magazine Big Daddy. Following the album, three 45s not on the album were also released: \\"What If We all Stopped Paying Taxes\\", released in 2002 just ahead of the U.S. Election, was a militant anti-war statement denouncing the Iraq War. \\"Genuine (parts 1 & 2\\" (2004) was a hard funk record. Their cover of \\"Just Dropped In (To See What Condition My Condition Was In)\\", released in 2005, was recorded for a KFC commercial in 2002 but was never used. Personnel changes About this time Maxton and Szilagyi left the band to become members of Antibalas, a New York-based afrobeat band. Trumpeter David Guy and guitarist Thomas Brenneck joined in their stead. In 2003 the Daptone Recording Studio, with a sixteen track analog tape machine, was open for business. The band intended to record two albums back-to-back, but during the final sessions of the first of these albums, Roth suffered serious eye injuries in a car crash, and only one LP and CD, Naturally, was released in 2005. This album included a mix of both soul and funk influences; the production and recording values were crisper than the slightly duller \\"scratchy 45\\" sound of the first album. The band embarked on an international promotional tour. Michels left the band soon after the release of Naturally to help start a new label, Truth & Soul Records, and released a solo LP that was originally intended for Daptone, Sounding Out the City, credited to El Michels Affair. When Lehman closed the Soul Fire label and moved to the Bahamas, the back catalog of Soul Fire was handled by Truth & Soul Records who, along with Soul Fire, used many of the same artists in their recordings, including Lee Fields, Homer Steinweiss, Thomas Brenneck and Michels himself. The Dap-kings took on Ian Hendrickson-Smith, a local saxophone player who had released several jazz albums under his own name. In late 2006, the band recorded a third studio album, 100 Days, 100 Nights. A non-album funk-style single, \\"I'm Not Gonna Cry\\", was released in April 2007, and the album was released in October along with two B Sides or Bonus Tracks: \\"Settlin' In\\" and \\"The Collection Song\\". Further albums included I Learned the Hard Way (2010),Sharon Jones & the Dap-Kings, \\"I Learned the Hard Way\\" by Billboard, April 23, 2010. Give the People What They Want (2014), and the holiday release It's a Holiday Soul Party. Also in 2014, Jones and her band performed at the Hamilton, Ontario Supercrawl.\\"Sharon Jones & the Dap Kings James St. North, Hamilton ON, September 12\\". Exclaim!, By Calum Slingerland. Sep 13, 2015. A film about Jones' battle with pancreatic cancer was released in 2016, with a soundtrack compilation. Jones died on November 18, 2016 at the age of 60. No specific announcement has been made regarding the band's future; however, the Dap-Kings have subsequently performed at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards in 2017 and were the house band for Joe's Pub Presents: A Holiday Special which taped in November, 2016. Collaborations Six of the tracks on Amy Winehouse's 2006 album Back to Black feature various members of the Dap-Kings, including two hits from the album, \\"Rehab\\" and \\"You Know I'm No Good\\". Several tracks recorded at Daptone Studios are miscredited as \\"Dapking Studios\\". Various members of the band feature on all but one of the track on Mark Ronson's second album, Version (2007). The Dap-Kings became the backing band for Amy Winehouse's first U.S. tour. After Winehouse's passing, Sharon Jones and the Dap-Kings joined Nas, Florence Welch, Wanda Jackson, and The Roots in tribute to her during VH1 Divas Celebrates Soul. In 2007 the Dap-Kings worked with British singer Ben Westbeech to record a new version of his song \\"So Good Today\\". Jones lends her vocals on one song \\"The Way We Lived\\", on Wax Tailor's second album Hope & Sorrow, released in April 2007. Jones is also featured on releases by They Might Be Giants (The Else) and Rufus Wainwright (Release the Stars). Jones contributed six period numbers by Bessie Smith and others to the soundtrack for the film The Great Debaters, recorded in the Ardent Studio in Memphis. Jones is also a featured on the Verve Records Baby Loves Jazz books/CDs and has had character books published by Penguin Books in conjunction with the series, entitled Ella the Elephant: Scats Like That. Sharon Jones and the Dap-Kings are featured on Michael Bubl√©'s 2009 album, Crazy Love, in the track \\"Baby (You've got what it takes)\\". In the fall of 2009 Sharon Jones and David Guy appeared with Phish for their musical costume at Phish's Festival 8 in Indio California, where they covered the Rolling Stones' Exile on Main St.. The Dap-Kings horn section backed the Heavy in a 2010 appearance on the Late Show with David Letterman, and they appeared with Muse on Saturday Night Live in 2012, providing support during their performance of Panic Station. The Dap-Kings appear on the 2012 David Byrne and St. Vincent collaboration Love This Giant. Dap-Kings drummer Homer Steinwess appears on St. Vincent's self-titled fifth album. In 2014, the Dap-Kings horn section collaborated with the Antibalas horn section, Mark Ronson, and Bruno Mars to record Uptown Funk and other tracks from Mark Ronson's 2015 album Uptown Special. They also performed Uptown Funk together on Saturday Night Live in November 2014. In February 2017, the Dap-Kings served as the backing band for country musician Sturgill Simpson's performance of his song \\"All Around You\\" at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards. In July 2017, it was revealed that the Dap-Kings Horns collaborated with Kesha on her song \\"Woman\\", from her album Rainbow. Use in advertisements In 2006, Sharon Jones & the Dap-Kings were featured in an I Love NY commercial directed by Kurt Lustgarten and set to their cover of Woody Guthrie's \\"This Land Is Your Land\\". The band's cover of Stevie Wonder's \\"Uptight (Everything's Alright)\\" appeared in a Chase Manhattan Bank commercial that same year. In Australia, their song \\"Got a Thing on my Mind\\" featured in a 2005 commercial for Cadbury's Boost Chocolate bar. In 2008 Sharon Jones & the Dap-Kings worked with Tropicana on a song promoting Tropicana orange juice, titled \\"Sweet & Lovely.\\" Ziggy Marley and Bebel Gilberto were featured in similar projects.

C. (Bob) Kershaw (died 6 May 1998) was a fighter pilot and later businessman of South Africa, notable as the first South African recipient of the Distinguished Service Order in World War II, for his daring rescue of downed squadron leader John Frost. Kershaw and Frost were flying Hawker Hurricanes in the No. 3 Squadron of the South African Air Force when they were sent to Kenya in early 1941 as part of a campaign against the Italians in Abyssinia. On 15 March, during an attack on Diredawa airfield, Frost's tank of glycol coolant was hit and he had to put his plane on the ground quickly before the overheating engine seized. Frost landed at a satellite airfield near Diredawa, and set his plane on fire to prevent its capture, but Kershaw had seen Frost go down and followed, putting his plane down on the same field. Space in the Hurricane was tight, so Frost had to discard his parachute and sit in Bob's lap. With Bob working the rudder's foot pedals and Jack using the throttle and control stick, they were able to take off and return to base. The rescue was a sensation in South Africa, Bob receiving an immediate DSO. His portrait was painted (it now hangs in the South African National War Museum), and the portrait was in turn adapted for a 1¬Ω-pence postage stamp issued in August 1942. Kershaw returned to flying, and eventually rose to the rank of Major. He flew the Supermarine Spitfire after they were delivered to the SAAF. Later he and his engineer would design the prototype twin payload bomb rack for the Spitfire, as it was ineffectual with a single payload. He was shot down and captured later. He received a Distinguished Flying Cross. After the war he went into the automobile business in East London, becoming managing director of Grosvenor Ford. He later retired to Knysna, where he joined the commando wing of the SAAF, rising to the rank of commandant. He died in Knysna in 1998.

Because the main rotor blades are spinning, the swashplate is used to transmit three of the pilot's commands from the non-rotating fuselage to the rotating rotor hub and mainblades. Swashplate on a radio-controlled helicopter 1 Non-rotating outer ring (blue) 2 Turning inner ring (silver) 3 Ball joint 4 Control (pitch) preventing turning of outer ring 5 Control (roll) 6 Linkages (silver) to the rotor blade Assembly The swashplate consists of two main parts: a stationary swashplate and a rotating swashplate. The stationary (outer) swashplate is mounted on the main rotor mast and is connected to the cyclic and collective controls by a series of pushrods. It is able to tilt in all directions and move vertically. The rotating (inner) swashplate is mounted to the stationary swashplate by means of a bearing and is allowed to rotate with the main rotor mast. An anti-rotation link prevents the inner swash from rotating independently of the blades, which would apply torque to the actuators. The outer swashplate typically has an anti-rotation slider as well to prevent it from rotating. Both swashplates tilt up and down as one unit. The rotating swashplate is connected to the pitch horns by the pitch links. Alternative mechanics to the stationary (outer) swashplate are the hexapod and the universal joint. Swashplates for helicopters having two rotors mounted on the same shaft are much more complex than the single rotor helicopters. Cyclic blade control Cyclic controls are used to change a helicopter's roll and pitch. Push rods or hydraulic actuators tilt the outer swashplate in response to the pilot's commands. The swashplate moves in the intuitively expected direction, tilting forwards to respond to a forward input, for instance. However \\"pitch links\\" on the blades transmit the pitch information way ahead of the blade's actual position, giving the blades time to \\"fly up\\" or \\"fly down\\" to reach the desired position. That is, to tilt the helicopter forward, the difference of lift around the blades should be maximum along the left-right plane, creating a torque that, due to the gyroscopic effect, will tilt the rotor disc forward and not sideways. Collective blade control To control the collective pitch of the main rotor blades, the entire swashplate must be moved up or down along its axis without changing the orientation of the cyclic controls. Conventionally, the entire swashplate is moved along the mainshaft by a separate actuator. However, some newer model helicopters remove this mechanically complex separation of functionalities by using three interdependent actuators that can each move the entire swashplate. This is called cyclic/collective pitch mixing. Animations Image:HelicopterSwashPlate_Flat.gif  Swash plate in the resting position. Image:HelicopterSwashPlate_Raised.gif  A raised swashplate causing negative collective blade pitch and thus down-force. Note that the control arms are on the trailing side of the blades, causing the raised swashplate to decrease the blade pitch. Image:HelicopterSwashPlate_Tilted.gif  A tilted swashplate giving cyclic blade control. Note the change in pitch of the blades during rotation. History The swashplate was originally proposed by Russian Boris Yuryev in 1911, though he did not use it on his first helicopter of 1912.Principles of Helicopter Aerodynamics. J. Gordon Leishman, Cambridge University Press, New York, 2002 p13 Pescara helicopters (1919‚Äì30) are coaxial rotors helicopters, each rotor being controlled by a swashplate (oscillating bearing) driven by the first control stick for helicopter (UK 178,452 Improvement in or relating to Joy Sticks for helicopters.Improvement in or relating to joy sticks for helicopters - Google Patents Convention date in Spain: April 12, 1921). French engineer and helicopter precursor Etienne Oehmichen filed an application to patent a swashplate device on June 18, 1926 in France and later in the U.S. (August 12, 1929).E. ≈íhmichen : Lifting Device - Google Patents Today, on most modern aircraft the swashplate is above the transmission and the pushrods are visible outside the fuselage, but a few early designs, notably light helicopters built by Enstrom Helicopter, placed it underneath the transmission and enclosed the rotating pushrods inside the mainshaft. This reduces rotor hub drag since there are no exposed linkages. Other swashplate and control design have been used. For instance, Kaman Aircraft helicopters do not use a traditional swashplate and instead operate servo flaps on the rotor blades to adjust the angle of attack of the blades.

He was a left- handed batsman and a left-arm fast-medium bowler. Born in Worthing, he played for Sussex from the beginning of his career in 1994 until his retirement in 2009, a career spanning 16 years, in spite of numerous injuries.  Career  Lewry began his first-class career at Sussex in 1994, and spent his whole career with Sussex. He had been successful for Goring Cricket Club in 1993, and had also played for the Duchess of Norfolk's XI against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) at Arundel Castle. In 1996, he played for a \\"Rest of England\\" side in 1996, and was a possibility for the 1996 England A tour, until he suffered an injury‚Äîlater diagnosed as a stress fracture in his back. Lewry did not bowl for 22 months, and missed the entire 1997 season. Lewry returned to cricket in 1998, and in a match against Gloucestershire, he took a hat-trick with deliveries in two innings. He took the wicket of Mike Smith to end Gloucestershire's first innings, and then with the first two balls of their second innings, he took the wickets of Nick Trainor and Dominic Hewson, to complete his hat-trick. He took 60 Championship wickets in the season, and in 1998/99 was selected for an England A tour of South Africa and Zimbabwe. Lewry played two matches, against Zimbabwe Cricket Union President's XI, and Zimbabwe A, but was forced to return to England early, due to a troublesome shoulder that required surgery. On the tour, Lewry had also suffered knee problems and food poisoning. He never played for England teams again, and when fellow left-armer Ryan Sidebottom was chosen ahead of him for the England team in 2001, this signalled the end of his international career. In 1999, Lewry discussed the possibility of a move with Nottinghamshire and Hampshire, but ultimately stayed at Sussex. In 2001, Lewry took seven wickets in 14 balls in a County Championship match against Hampshire. It was the best County Championship bowling since 1971, when Pat Pocock took 7 wickets in 11 balls, and in the process, Lewry became the first Sussex player for 20 years to take a hat-trick at Hove, and achieved his career-best match figures of 13‚Äì79. Lewry was given a Benefit Year by Sussex in 2002, and in 2003, Lewry took 8/106 in the County Championship title-deciding match, as Sussex won their first title. He played every Championship game in 2003, taking 42 wickets. In 2004, Lewry was the third wicket as Dimitri Mascarenhas took the first hat- trick in Twenty20 cricket. He took 40 wickets in 2005, but missed the last six matches due to a groin injury. He returned to the side for the 2006 season, and was part of the side that won the Championship that season, and also in 2007. From 2004, Lewry played fewer List A matches, playing only seven times between 2004 and 2008. Lewry was the leading wicket-taker in the 2008 County Championship, taking 41 wickets. For the 2009 season, he signed a contract only to play Championship matches, saying \\"I have only played seven games since 2004 so I have effectively retired from one-day cricket anyway\\" and \\"I want to play on and prolong my career. I certainly wouldn‚Äôt go anywhere else ‚Äì I‚Äôm Sussex through and through.\\" After the 2009 season, in which he took 10 wickets, Lewry announced his retirement from first-class cricket; He had hinted at retirement many times since 2005, so much so that his hints at retirement \\"have become something of a joke in Sussex\\". Lewry actually retired this time. He went to play for Goring Cricket Club, the team that he had left in 1994 to join Sussex.

The choir commissions a carol from a contemporary composer for each year's Festival. History=Early history The original statutes specified that the choir should consist of ten chaplains, six clerks (lay singers) and sixteen choristers who were to be \\"poor and needy boys, of sound condition and honest conversation ... knowing competently how to read and sing\\". Perhaps recognising the workload placed upon the choristers who were to sing Matins, Mass and Vespers daily, the statutes also stated that \\"they should be doubly occupied with their prescribed duties and with their education\\". By 1449 recruitment had resulted in this full choir being in place singing daily services. The choir sang High Mass, Lady Mass and from daybreak, the eight services of the Liturgy of the Hours. In addition the boys alone sang daily \\"in the finest manner they know\\" the Little Office of the Blessed Virgin Mary and also the evening votive antiphon. When Henry VI was deposed during the Wars of the Roses in 1461, a period of brief instability resulted in reduced numbers for a while due to lack of funds. However in 1479 with the appointment of Provost Walter Field the choir came to fulfil the full potential of Henry VI's vision. Field oversaw the acquisition of innovative polyphonic music in the Eton Choirbook style, and appointed a new precentor with expertise in the complicated Salisbury Liturgy. A peak of splendour was reached under Robert Hacumblen, Provost from 1509. This was maintained until the succession of Protestant Edward VI in 1547, when a deterioration in choral music at King's began which lasted until the late Victorian period. During this time the choir were singing in a temporary chapel, with the main King's College Chapel still under construction. In 1506 Henry VII visited Cambridge and attended evensong, and afterwards resolved to fund continued construction. This was continued by his successor Henry VIII with choral services commencing in the completed chapel in 1544. Elizabeth I visited the chapel in 1564, and attended evensong on 5 August and again the following night, although she turned up late, causing the service to be restarted. It is recorded that pricksong was sung (an early form polyphony with a melody performed as a counterpoint to a plainsong) as it likely had been since the foundation of the college. During Oliver Cromwell's rule the number of choral services were reduced, and departing choristers were not replaced. By 1651 there was only one chorister left and by 1654 there were none. Lay clerks were still retained during this time; it is likely that they sang secular anthems, including on Guy Fawkes Night. Upon the restoration of the monarchy in 1660, ten choristers were appointed immediately; the choir was at full strength by 1666. In 1827 a survey of choir schools in England noted of King's: \\"the Choristers attend service in the Chapel once a day in the afternoon on common days; on Sundays and Saints' days twice, morning and evening. They are also permitted to sing at the Chapels of other Colleges, and at St. Mary's Church. They are instructed in singing by the organist, and in reading, writing, and arithmetic by a master appointed by the College. The Statutes prescribe that they should be under 12 years of age at their admission. They are generally admitted about eight years of age, and leave the Choir when the voice breaks.\\" Reform during the nineteenth century Queen Victoria and Prince Albert entering King‚Äôs College Chapel, 1843. By the 1860s it was recognised that musical standards in the choir needed improvement. John Jebb's 1843 enquiry into Anglican choirs found that \\"in Cambridge, the Choral Service has suffered mutilation in every place where it is retained. King's College has reduced the original number of its Conduct Chaplains from three to one; and though retaining its sixteen Choristers (which evidently were intended to be proportionate to a more numerous body of adult singers), there are but a small number of Clerks, too weak for the magnificent organ which accompanies them, and for the unrivalled Chapel where they minister. The Choir indeed attends twice daily; but the prayers are not chanted (a very modern innovation), and at the Sunday morning service the Nicene Creed is not sung.\\". Amongst the lay clerks, whose duties were at this time divided by also singing at Trinity, indiscipline and absenteeism were common. Reform began after the passing of the Cambridge University Act 1856, which enabled the statutes and governance of the college to be altered. Two chaplains and twelve lay clerks were specified, and sharing duties with Trinity was ended in 1871. The same year a new Master over the Choristers was appointed, who was tasked with being \\"watchful of their moral conduct\\" and \\"maintaining disciple without undue severity at all times\\". Conditions for choristers were improved with the intention of recruiting boys from a higher social background. They were given instruction in instrumental music and financial assistance upon leaving. To further widen the field for selection it was decided to open a boarding school instead of paying for choristers to be lodged with local families. From 1876 it was decreed that choristerships should be open to all candidates \\"whether resident in Cambridge or elsewhere\\" with those resident outside the city lodged at the expense of the college, and a purpose-built King's College School was opened two years later. Also in 1876 it was decided that choral scholarships were to be awarded, with students replacing the permanently employed lay clerks. Existing contracts meant this was a slow process, with the last clerk leaving in 1928. 1876 also saw the appointment of a new organist on an increased salary, Arthur Henry Mann. There was little if any formal training of choir instructors at this time in England - most were organists who taught the choir following whatever technique they themselves had been subjected to as former choristers. Mann was fortunate in this regard having been a chorister at Norwich Cathedral under the renowned Zechariah Buck. Mann was therefore an outstanding choir trainer himself and greatly improved the reputation of King's College Choir. He worked on improving the diction and timing of the choir to allow them to work with the acoustic of the chapel and its particularly lengthy reverb. He also opened up services to the public, where previously visitors needed written permission to attend. Membership of the Choir=Choristers Kings College Choristers 1882 The statutes of the College provide for sixteen choristers. These are boys who are educated at King's College School. They come from a variety of backgrounds with bursaries being available to families unable to afford the subsidised school fees. Boys usually join the choir as probationers aged eight following a successful audition at age six or seven. After two years as probationers, they enter the choir as full choristers, departing three years later or earlier if their voice changes. Choral Scholars From the beginning of the 20th century, the fourteen lower voices of the choir have been provided by undergraduates who sing as Choral Scholars. These students must gain an academic place at Cambridge University as well as successfully obtaining a choral award at King's College through an audition process. They remain in the choir throughout their typically three-year degree. Although some will study for a degree in music, many study other subjects, with only medicine and architecture being incompatible. Fan Vault Very occasionally, a Lay Clerk may be appointed in place of a Choral Scholar, usually if a vacancy arises unexpectedly: for example, when a student, having gained a conditional place at the college (subject to A-level grades being achieved) fails to meet the conditions. Such Lay Clerks have, to all intents and purposes, the same status as a Choral Scholar. The few Lay Clerks that have existed (since the establishment of Choral Scholars) have often been Choral Scholars agreeing to remain for an additional year. The Choral Scholars form collectively, in their spare time, a separate group, The King's Men, singing a wide range of music written for men's voices, from early music through to barbershop arrangements (many of the latter having been written exclusively for the group by present/former Choral Scholars). =Groups spawned from the Choral Scholars= Various singing groups have been spawned from groups of Choral Scholars: * The King's Men, formerly known as Collegium Regale, made up of the current Choral Scholars * The King's Singers (1968‚Äìpresent) * The Scholars (1968-2010) and The Scholars Baroque Ensemble * Pange Lingua, directed by Berty Rice (1990s) * Polyphony (1986‚Äìpresent) Organ Scholars The organ is played by two Organ Scholars, who, like the Choral Scholars, are students (typically undergraduates) at the College. An Organ Scholarship is awarded as necessary to ensure that there are always two undergraduate Organists in the College - a new Scholar is appointed to arrive when the previous one graduates. If the Director of Music is not present for any reason, an Organ Scholar takes responsibility for conducting the Choir. Performing and recording activities The choir maintains a strong recording and touring schedule, in addition to its duties at King's College Chapel, in Cambridge. Tours and performances The choir first toured in 1936, visiting Netherlands, Germany, Denmark and Sweden. In recent years, the choir has toured throughout Europe, the US, South America, Australia and Asia. The choir regularly performs in the United Kingdom, giving concerts in the major London concert halls, as well as at numerous festivals around the country. In 2013, the Choir of King's College, Cambridge sang at the Prime Minister's Easter reception held at 10 Downing Street. The choir also performs with symphony orchestras, such as the BBC Symphony Orchestra at the BBC Proms in 2005 and 2009, the London Symphony Orchestra, and performs an annual Christmas concert with the Philharmonia Orchestra at the Royal Albert Hall. Recordings The choir's first commercial release was a 1929 recording of Bach's 'God liveth still' and 'Up, up my heart with gladness' on the HMV label, released in 1931. In 1963 the choir released a landmark recording of Allegri's Miserere featuring treble soloist Roy Goodman. A little-known work at the time, this release led to it becoming one of the most popular a capella choral works. The choir has recorded more than 100 albums, on the EMI and Decca labels. In 2013 the choir launched its own label, King's College Recordings, which would allow it to gain more artistic freedom over its releases. Releases on this label include 100 Years of Nine Lessons and Carols which remained at number 1 in the classical charts for nine weeks. The choir has been innovative in its release of recordings, as apart from standard CDs they have offered Super Audio CD, Dolby Atmos, audio Blu-ray, and 24-bit FLAC download versions of albums. In 2013 the choir began making available recordings of its choral services. These can be listened to on the choir's web site. In 2017 for the first time they made the Carols From King's televised Christmas service available as a video download.

Most are in the form of reading practice quizzes, although some are curriculum-based with multiple subjects. Many of the company's quizzes are available in an optional recorded voice format for primary-level books, in which the quiz questions and answers are read to the student taking the quiz. These quizzes are designed to help emerging English And (some) Spanish readers take the quizzes without additional assistance. The Renaissance Place version of Accelerated Reader also includes quizzes designed to practice vocabulary. The quizzes use words from books, and are taken after the book has been read. Bookmarks can be printed out that display the vocabulary words so that, as students read, they can refer to the bookmark for help. The quizzes keep track of words learned. Reports * Reports are generated on demand to help students, teachers, and parents monitor student progress.

Evaluation research  # A number of studies have been conducted regarding the effectiveness of using Accelerated Reader in the classroom. The following two studies were reviewed by the What Works Clearinghouse and were found to meet their high standards for research.Press release about the What Works Clearinghouse Ross, Nunnery, and Goldfeder studied 1,665 students and 76 teachers (grades K-8) from 12 schools in Memphis, Tennessee. Some teachers were randomly selected to use Accelerated Reader and the others continued the regular curriculum without using the software. Students in classrooms with Accelerated Reader demonstrated gains. Many of the teachers that used the software responded positively to it and indicated that they would continue to use the software. # In another study, Nunnery, Ross, and McDonald assessed the reading achievement of students in grades 3‚Äì8. They assessed the effects of individual, classroom, and school factors that impact reading achievement. Those in Accelerated Reader classrooms still outperformed students in control classrooms. Students with learning disabilities in very high implementation classrooms did not suffer from their disabilities as much as similar students in low or no implementation classrooms.Nunnery, Ross, & McDonald (2006) research paper (PDF). Other evaluations In a controlled evaluation, Holmes and Brown found that two schools using the School Renaissance program achieved statistically significant higher standardized test scores when compared with two comparison schools that only used the Renaissance program in a limited way.Holmes, C.T., & Brown, C.L. (2003). A Controlled Evaluation of a Total School Improvement Process, School Renaissance. Technical Report. Athens, GA: University of Georgia. Because so many schools in the United States are using Accelerated Reader, it was difficult for the authors of this study to find two schools in Georgia that were not already using Accelerated Reader. The authors noted: :\\"In all nine comparisons involving standardized test scores in reading, language arts, and mathematics, the Renaissance schools' children outperformed the contrast school's children. It can only be concluded that the Renaissance program was highly effective in raising the performance of these elementary students.\\" In 2003, Samuels and Wu found that, after six months, third- and fifth-grade students who used Accelerated Reader demonstrated twice the gain in reading comprehension as those that did not use Accelerated Reader.Research papers by Samuels and Wu.Samuels & Wu (2003) research paper (PDF). The comparison students completed book reports, suggesting that delayed feedback through book reports is not as useful as the immediate feedback provided by Accelerated Reader. In another study, Samuels and Wu found students in Accelerated Reader classrooms, after controlling for the amount of time spent reading each day, outperformed students in control classrooms.Samuels & Wu (2004) research paper (PDF).

In some cases Renaissance Learning provides funding for research studies about the efficacy of the Accelerated Reader software system. Criticism Educators have argued that the use of Accelerated Reader does not teach reading for comprehension; it only teaches reading for recall.A mailing list from a teacher critical of Renaissance Learning's Accelerated Reader and Accelerated Math software packages. A minimal number of Literacy Skill Quizzes in Accelerated Reader claim to assess higher order thinking skills. Eight Literacy Skill Quizzes have an ATOS level of 1.0-3.0, which provides limited support for higher order thinking skills for developing readers. Renaissance Place includes recognizing setting and understanding sequence as examples of higher order thinking. , Review Pages 6 & 7 of Accelerated Reader Advanced Topics: Literacy Skill Quizzes PowerPoint. Turner and Paris's study on the role of classroom literacy tasks is particularly relevant. Their vignettes describing open versus closed tasks may inform how we consider Accelerated Reader. In this program, students usually take end-of-book tests called Reading Practice Quizzes that are composed of literal-recall questions to which there is only one answer. Turner and Paris would classify these quizzes as \\"closed tasks.\\". Turner and Paris ultimately concluded that open-ended tasks are more supportive of literacy growth in the future. This research prompts some educators to refrain from using Accelerated Reader quizzes out of fear that students will begin to perceive the purpose of reading as answering literal-recall questions and possibly lose the desire to read. Florida Center for Reading Research,The Florida Center for Reading Research is a \\"Florida State University Center.\\" citing two studies that support the product noted both the lack of available books in a school's library and the lack of assessment of \\"inferential or critical thinking skills\\" as weaknesses of the software. Their guide also noted a number of strengths of the software, including its ability to motivate students and provide immediate results on students' reading habits and progress. Renaissance Learning, the product's developer, has stated that its intended purpose is to assess whether or not a student has read a book, not to assess higher order thinking skills, to teach or otherwise replace curriculum, to supersede the role of the teacher, or to provide extrinsic reward.Abstract of a 1997 report, originally published by The Institute for Academic Excellence, Inc., and republished by Renaissance Learning, covering the use of rewards with Accelerated Reader. An e-mail address is given to request a copy of the report. The Literacy Skill Quizzes do attempt to assess higher-order thinking skills, even though this isn't intended purpose of the program. Nonetheless, educator and reading advocate Jim Trelease describes Accelerated Reader, along with Scholastic's Reading Counts!, as \\"reading incentive software\\" in an article exploring the pros and cons of the two software packages.An excerpt from Jim Trelease's Read-Aloud Handbook, covering \\"computerized 'reading incentive' programs.\\" Please note that this review is severely out of date (e.g., the author cites \\"Advantage Learning Systems\\" as the proprietor of Accelerated Reader). Similarly, Stephen D. Krashen, in a 2003 literature review, asserts that reading incentives is one of the aspects of Accelerated Reader.An article by Stephen D. Krashen titled \\"Does Accelerated Reader Work?\\" Please note that certain studies were not reviewed, which may result in a biased viewpoint, and that new studies have been conducted since this review. In this review, Krashen reiterates prior research stating that reading for incentives does not create long-term readers. However, as noted above, Renaissance Learning does not promote the use of incentives, and the software can be used without incentives. Use of the program has been criticized as preventing children from reading from a variety of difficulty levels. As an example, research from Scholastic indicates that 39% of children between the ages of five and ten have read a Harry Potter novel, with 68% of students in that age range having an interest in reading or re-reading a Harry Potter book.Scholastic Presentation mjfufjhbjdhngdr By Yankelovich 2006, slide 16 For example, the ATOS reading level of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is 5.5 (with ATOS numbers corresponding to grade levels). This would indicate that students below that grade range may not be able to read and comprehend the book. Since teachers, parents and student use readability levels to select books, this may discourage students from reading the book, as the student is under pressure to earn Accelerated Reader points during the school year, although students can take tests and earn points for books at any ATOS level. Progress charts Progress charts are ideas to implement in classrooms and work well with the Accelerated Reading program. Other names for these charts are star charts or sticker charts. They are a way for students to easily keep track of reading goals and motivates students to read more for a reward. ‚Äú[Webre] suggests creating and implementing progress charts in the classroom setting for the purposes of student reflection and self-evaluation, celebration of small daily successes/accomplishments, stimulation of active learning, student choice, and control.‚Äù ReferencesExternal links *Accelerated Reader webpage *ERIC - Education Resources Information Center *National Center on Student Progress Monitoring Category:Software for children Category:Renaissance Learning software Category:Children's educational video games ","title":"Accelerated Reader"},{"id":"3572452","text":"State Route 261 (SR 261) is an east-west state highway located in northeastern Ohio that passes through Medina, Summit, and Portage counties.

It is characterized by delayed development and intellectual disabilities, distinctive facial features, unusually flexible joints, and loose folds of extra skin, especially on the hands and feet.James, William; Berger, Timothy; Elston, Dirk (2005). Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: Clinical Dermatology. (10th ed.). Saunders. . Heart abnormalities are common, including a very fast heartbeat (tachycardia), structural heart defects, and overgrowth of the heart muscle (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy). Infants with Costello syndrome may be large at birth, but grow more slowly than other children and have difficulty feeding. Later in life, people with this condition have relatively short stature and many have reduced levels of growth hormones. It is a RASopathy. Beginning in early childhood, people with specific mutations on the Costello syndrome gene variant have an increased risk of developing certain cancerous and noncancerous tumors. Small growths called papillomas are the most common noncancerous tumors seen with this condition. They usually develop around the nose and mouth. The most frequent cancerous tumor associated with Costello syndrome is a soft tissue tumor called a rhabdomyosarcoma. Other cancers also have been reported in children and adolescents with this disorder, including a tumor that arises in developing nerve cells (neuroblastoma) and a form of bladder cancer (transitional cell carcinoma). Costello syndrome was discovered by Dr Jack Costello, a New Zealand Paediatrician in 1977. He is credited with first reporting the syndrome in the Australian Paediatric Journal, Volume 13, No.2 in 1977. Signs and symptomsGenetics Costello syndrome is caused by any of at least five different mutations in the HRAS gene on chromosome 11. This gene provides instructions for making a protein, H-Ras, that helps control cell growth and division. Mutations that cause Costello syndrome lead to the production of an H-Ras protein that is permanently active. Instead of triggering cell growth in response to particular signals from outside the cell, the overactive protein directs cells to grow and divide constantly. This unchecked cell division may predispose sufferers to the development of benign and malignant tumors. It remains unclear how mutations in HRAS cause other features of Costello syndrome, but many of the signs and symptoms may result from cell overgrowth and abnormal cell division. HRAS is a proto-oncogene in which somatic mutations in healthy people can contribute to cancer. Whereas children with Costello syndrome typically have a mutation in HRAS in every cell of their bodies, an otherwise healthy person with a tumor caused in part by HRAS mutation will only have mutant HRAS within the tumor. The test for the mutation in cancer tumors can also be used to test children for Costello syndrome. Costello syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, which means one copy of the altered gene is sufficient to cause the disorder. Almost all cases have resulted from new mutations, and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. This condition is rare; as of 20 April 2007, 200 to 300 cases have been reported worldwide. Diagnosis Costello Syndrome can be difficult for doctors to immediately clinically diagnose, as there are similar conditions that resemble this syndrome. A physician will start by assessing the child's height, the size of the head, and birth weight. Full genome and Exome next generation DNA testing is the primary diagnostic tool for Costello Syndrome. Treatments At the 2005 American Society of Human Genetics meeting, Francis Collins gave a presentation about a treatment he devised for children affected by Progeria. He discussed how farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTIs) affects H-Ras. After his presentation, members of the Costello Syndrome Family Network discussed the possibility of FTIs helping children with Costello syndrome. Mark Kieran, who presented at the 1st International Costello Syndrome Research Symposium in 2007, agreed that FTIs might help children with Costello syndrome. He discussed with Costello advocates what he had learned in establishing and running the Progeria clinical trial with an FTI, to help them consider next steps. Another medication that affects H-Ras is Lovastatin, which is planned as a treatment for neurofibromatosis type I. When this was reported in mainstream news, the Costello Syndrome Professional Advisory Board was asked about its use in Costello Syndrome. Research into the effects of Lovastatin was linked with Alcino Silva, who presented his findings at the 2007 symposium. Silva also believed that the medication he was studying could help children with Costello syndrome with cognition. A third medication that might help children with Costello syndrome is a MEK inhibitor that helps inhibit the pathway closer to the cell nucleus. Research Spanish researchers reported the development of a Costello mouse, with the G12V mutation, in early 2008. Although the G12V mutation is rare among children with Costello syndrome, and the G12V mouse does not appear to develop tumors as expected, information about the mouse model's heart may be transferable to humans. Italian and Japanese researchers published their development of a Costello zebrafish in late 2008, also with the G12V mutation. The advent of animal models may accelerate identification of treatment options. Historical  That genetic mutations in HRAS cause Costello syndrome was first reported in 2005. These mutations, along with mutations that cause cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome, found soon after, surprised geneticists and changed how genetic syndromes can be grouped. Before this, geneticists looked for new mutations in genes with mutations that caused syndromes similar to the unknown syndrome. For example, researchers looked at and around the most common Noonan syndrome mutation, PTPN11, but did not find anything related to Costello syndrome or cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome. The first mutation that is now identified as one of the Costello syndrome alleles was found unexpectedly when Japanese researchers used the DNA of children with Costello syndrome as a control, looking for another Noonan gene Geneticists realized that the syndromes they were grouping together clinically according to their signs and symptoms were related in a way they had never realized: the mutations that cause Costello syndrome, Noonan syndrome and cardiofaciocutaneous syndromes are linked by their cellular function, not by being on or close to a gene with a known mutation. The cellular function that links them is a common signalling pathway that brings information from outside the cell to the nucleus. This pathway is called the Ras-MAP-kinase signal transduction pathway (Ras-MAPK Pathway).Lisa Schoyer, 2007 Costello syndrome medical symposium.

The northernmost part of the road is available only to convoys, driving at fixed times, during the winter months. E69 is the northernmost road in the world with connections to a major international road network. Roads further north in locations including Svalbard and Greenland are isolated and short.  History  In the first version of the current E-road network established in 1975, E69 was a longer and completely different road from Warsaw to Wiener Neustadt through Piotrk√≥w, Katowice, ƒåesk√Ω Tƒõ≈°√≠n, ≈Ωilina, Trenƒç√≠n, Pie≈°≈•any and Bratislava. This route is now mostly part of E75, and that time, the E75 went through Krak√≥w and Bansk√° Bystrica, which is now part of E77. It was later modified south from Mattersburg. Instead of Wiener Neustadt, it went further to south touching Oberpullendorf and Oberwart following the Austrian route 50, ending in E66. This version was never signposted along roads, instead a modified version was implemented with E75 on this route.

A ferry line was set up between Russenes near Olderfjord and Honningsv√•g, a distance of around . The road between Honningsv√•g and North Cape was opened in 1956. In 1968 the road was extended to a new ferry site at K√•fjord, and the ferry to Honningsv√•g was shortened to . E69 was given its current route number in 1992. Before that, the road was number 95 in Norway. Since then, it has no distinct national number. The North Cape Tunnel and the Honningsv√•g Tunnel were opened in 1999, thereby eliminating the ferry. From then to 29 June 2012, the North Cape Tunnel and adjacent tunnels were tolled. The near the southern end of E69 opened in 1968 and is a bottleneck. It is partly only wide, so wide vehicles cannot use it at the same time in opposite directions, and there is rockslide danger in the area. Therefore, a new tunnel is to be built in 2018‚Äì2021, which also will shorten the route by 2 km.

T. c. carolina is native to the eastern part of the United States. The eastern box turtle is a subspecies of the common box turtle (Terrapene carolina). While in the pond turtle family, Emydidae, and not a tortoise, the box turtle is largely terrestrial. Box turtles are slow crawlers, extremely long lived, slow to mature, and have relatively few offspring per year. These characteristics, along with a propensity to get hit by cars and agricultural machinery, make all box turtle species particularly susceptible to anthropogenic, or human-induced, mortality. In 2011, citing \\"a widespread persistent and ongoing gradual decline of Terrapene carolina that probably exceeds 32% over three generations\\", the IUCN downgraded its conservation status from Near Threatened to Vulnerable.  Description  Eastern box turtles have a high, dome-like carapace and a hinged plastron that allows total shell closure. The carapace can be of variable coloration, but is normally found brownish or black and is accompanied by a yellowish or orangish radiating pattern of lines, spots or blotches. Skin coloration, like that of the shell, is variable, but is usually brown or black with some yellow, orange, red, or white spots or streaks.https://boxturtlesite.info/eastern-box- turtle/ This coloration closely mimics that of the winter leaf of the tulip poplar. In some isolated populations, males may have blue patches on their cheeks, throat, and front legs. Furthermore, males normally possess red eyes (irises) whereas females usually display brown eyes. Eastern box turtles feature a sharp, horned beak, stout limbs, and their feet are webbed only at the base. Eastern box turtles have 5 toes on each front leg, and normally 4 toes on each hind leg, although some individuals may possess 3 toes on each hind leg. Staying small in size, most range from 4.5 to 6 inches, but occasionally reach over 7 inches. In captivity, box turtles are known to live over 100 years, but in the wild, often live much shorter lives due to disease and predation. Eastern box turtle in Florida Eastern box turtles have many uniquely identifying characteristics as part of the box turtle group. While the female's plastron is flat, it is concave in males so the male may fit over the back end of the female's carapace during mating. The front and back of the plastron are connected by a flexible hinge. When in danger, the turtle is able to close the plastron by pulling the hinged sections closely against the carapace, effectively sealing the soft body in bone, hence forming a \\"box\\". The shell is made of bone covered by living vascularized tissue and covered with a layer of keratin. This shell is connected to the body through its fused rib cage which makes the shell permanently attached and not removable. When injured or damaged, the shell has the capacity to regenerate and reform. Granular tissue slowly forms and keratin slowly grows underneath the damaged area to replace damaged and missing scutes. Over time, the damaged area falls off, revealing the new keratin formed beneath it. Unlike water turtles such as the native eastern painted turtle (Chrysemys picta), box turtle scutes continue to grow throughout the turtle's life and develop growth rings. Water turtles typically shed their scutes as they grow.  Distribution and habitat  The eastern box turtle is found mainly in the eastern United States, as is implied by its name. They occur as far north as southern Maine and the southern and eastern portions of the Michigan Upper Peninsula, south to southern Florida and west to eastern Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. In the northern parts of their range, they are rarely found above 1,000 feet in elevation, while they may be found up to 6,000 feet in the southern parts of their range. The eastern box turtle is considered uncommon to rare in the Great Lakes region; however, populations can be found in areas not bisected by heavily traveled roads. In the Midwest, they are a Species of Concern in Ohio, and of Special Concern in Michigan and Indiana. Eastern box turtles prefer deciduous or mixed forested regions, with a moderately moist forest floor that has good drainage. Bottomland forest is preferred over hillsides and ridges. They can also be found in open grasslands, pastures, or under fallen logs or in moist ground, usually moist leaves or wet dirt. They have also been known to take \\"baths\\" in shallow streams and ponds or puddles, and during hot periods may submerge in mud for days at a time. However, if placed in water that is too deep (completely submerged), they may drown.  Reproduction  Reproduction for the eastern box turtle can occur at any point throughout the late spring, summer, and early fall months, but egg-laying is most likely to occur in May and June, when rain is frequent. After finding a mate (there is no pair-bonding, and mate-finding mechanisms are unclear), which can be a difficult task in areas where mates are sparse, the couple will embark on a 3-phase courtship event. Following fertilization, the female finds an appropriate nesting site. Nest site selection is vital to egg development, as predation and temperature are primary concerns. Temperature affects the sex of offspring (Type I temperature-dependent sex determination), developmental rate, and possibly fitness. Females will use their hind feet to dig a shallow nest in loose soil; this process can take 2 to 6 hours. Eggs are generally deposited shortly after the digging phase, and each egg is deployed into a particular position. Eggs are oblong, 3 centimeters long, creamy white, and leathery. Nests are then concealed with grass, leaves, or soil. A female can lay anywhere from 1 to 5 clutches of about 1 to 9 eggs in a single year, or even delay laying her clutch if resources are scarce. Females exhibit delayed fertility, wherein sperm can be stored in oviducts for several years until conditions are favorable for fertilization and laying. Incubation ranges widely depending on temperature, but averages 50 to 70 days.  Diet  The eating habits of eastern box turtles vary greatly due to individual taste, temperature, lighting, and their surrounding environment. Unlike warm-blooded animals, their metabolism does not drive their appetite; instead, they can just lessen their activity level, retreat into their shells, and halt their food intake until better conditions arise. In the wild, eastern box turtles are opportunistic omnivores and will feed on a variety of animal and vegetable matter. There are a variety of foods which are universally accepted by eastern box turtles, which include earthworms, snails, slugs, grubs, beetles, caterpillars, grasses, weeds, fallen fruit, berries, mushrooms, flowers, duck weed, and carrion. Studies at Jug Bay Wetlands Sanctuary in Maryland have also shown that eastern box turtles have fed on live birds that were trapped in netting. Many times, they will eat an item of food, especially in captivity, just because it looks and smells edible, such as hamburger or eggs, even though the food may be harmful or unhealthy.  In captivity  Thousands of box turtles are collected from the wild every year for the domestic pet trade, primarily from South Carolina, the only remaining state where they can legally be captured from the wild and sold for profit. Captive turtles may have a life span as short as three days if they are not fed, watered, and held in a proper container. The vivid shell color found in many eastern box turtles often fades when a turtle is brought into captivity. This has led to the mistaken belief that the color fades as the turtle ages. The truth is that insufficient access to full sunlight causes the color in the keratin layer to fade. The eastern box turtle is protected throughout most of its range, but many states allow the capture and possession of box turtles for personal use. Captive breeding is fairly commonplace, but not so much that it can supply the market demand. Although box turtles may make hardy captives if their needs are met, and are frequently kept as pets, they are not easy turtles to keep, owing to their many specific requirements. Eastern box turtles require high humidity, warm temperatures with vertical and horizontal thermal gradients, suitable substrate for burrowing, and full spectrum ultraviolet lighting that mimics sunlight. A basking area at one end of the enclosure is important to offer the turtle the ability to warm itself and is critical to sexually mature males and females for development of sperm and egg follicles respectively. Therefore, a large, easily accessible water dish for bathing and drinking is important to their health. Water should be fresh and clean and available at all times. Because box turtles seldom get the nutrients they need to foster shell growth and skeletal and skin development, they also may require vitamin supplements to keep them healthy such as calcium, vitamin A, and folic acid. Captive diets include various live invertebrates such as crickets, worms, earthworms, beetles and grubs (beetle larvae), cockroaches, small mice as well as wild strawberries, and fish (not goldfish). Mixed berries, fruit, romaine lettuce, collard greens, dandelion greens, chicory, mushrooms and clover are suitable for box turtles as well. While some high quality moist dog foods may be occasionally offered, whole animals are preferable. Reptomin is a suitable food for hatchling and immature/subadult box turtles. State reptiles The eastern box turtle is the official state reptile of two U.S. states: North Carolina (which gives rise to the species and subspecies name carolina carolina) and Tennessee. In Pennsylvania, the eastern box turtle made it through one house of the legislature, but failed to win final naming in 2009. In Virginia, bills to honor the eastern box turtle failed in 1999 and then in 2009; a core reason is the creature's close links to North Carolina.

It is in length. It runs east‚Äìwest through the central part of the state, beginning at unincorporated Tabler, east of Chickasha, and ending east of Konawa. Along the way, SH-39 serves the counties of Grady, McClain, Cleveland, Pottawatomie, and Seminole. It currently has no lettered spurs. SH-39 was built in 1923 but not added to the state highway system until approximately 1936. Originally connecting Tabler to Purcell, SH-39 was extended to the east over the next five years, first to Asher and then to Konawa. Route description SH-39 shield on SH-24 near their intersection. The highway begins at the concurrency of U.S. Highway 62 (US-62)/US-277/State Highway 9 (SH-9) near the unincorporated community of Tabler, east of Chickasha. The road begins traveling east from there, intersecting SH-76 later west of Dibble. From Dibble, it continues east, meeting the eastern terminus of SH-59 and intersecting SH-24 in the unincorporated town of Woody Chapel. It then continues east to Purcell. In Purcell, SH-39 passes under Interstate 35, but does not have a junction with it. The highway soon encounters US-77/SH-74 just east of the interstate. Here, it turns northward and begins an overlap with the two highways through Purcell. SH-74 splits off after a few blocks while SH-39 and US-77 turn eastward and cross over the Canadian River on the James C. Nance Memorial Bridge. After crossing the river, the highways arrive in the town of Lexington and US-77 splits off to the northeast. SH-39 continues eastward, serving the Lexington prison and overlapping for less than a mile with SH-102. In the town of Asher, the highway intersects SH-3W and SH-59 again. later, the highway meets SH-9A in Konawa. The highway ends east of Konawa at US-377/SH-3E/SH-99. The mainline of the highway becomes SH-56. History The road that would become SH-39 was built in 1923, but it was not assigned a state route number until at least late 1936, first appearing on the 1937 state map. Originally, the route's eastern terminus was at US-77 in Purcell. By April 1939, it had been extended eastward to end at Asher. The route first reached its current termini in 1941 (although at the time, SH-99 passed through Konawa). A short gap existed west of Asher in the SH-39 designation between 1946 and 1947; by 1948 this gap had been filled. The final change to SH-39 occurred in 1968 or 1969, when SH-99 was rerouted to bypass Konawa, and SH-39 was extended east of town to end at the present junction. No changes have been made since. Spurs SH-39 once had one spur route, SH-39B. It ran along what is now May Avenue from SH-39's junction with SH-59 to SH-74B east of Cole, Oklahoma.Map of McClain County. Date unknown.

It is in the parish of Gairloch, the community of Torridon and Kinlochewe and the Highland council area. It lies near the head of Loch Maree in its magnificent valley, and serves as a junction between the main Ullapool road north, and that which heads west to the coast at Loch Torridon. Loch Maree was at one time also known as Loch Ewe, hence the village's apparently confused name. Community Kinlochewe has a couple of shops, a hotel and bunkhouse, mountain chalets, several bed and breakfasts, a post office (with internet caf√©), and one of very few petrol filling stations for many miles in any direction. Buses connect the village with Gairloch, the railhead at Achnasheen, Dingwall and Inverness. The village contains two churches, Kinlochewe Free Church, built in 1873, and the Church of Scotland. To the north of the village, by the car park, is a First World War (1914‚Äì18) memorial. Two sergeants from the Seaforth Highlanders are remembered. Both were awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal, and both later died of their wounds. Others from Canada and New Zealand are also remembered. Mountains The village is at the south-east corner of the Beinn Eighe national nature reserve, centred on the mountain of that name, which includes some surviving areas of natural forest, the majority of which was cut down from the 16th century onwards for iron smelting which was the major industry in the area. A short but steep woodland trail runs through pine forest on the lower slopes of the reserve, giving fine views over Loch Maree and the mountain of Slioch on the other side of the loch. A longer, rougher mountain trail climbs further up the slopes of Beinn Eighe. Liathach seen from Beinn Eighe. With the Munro ‚ÄúTop‚Äú of Stuc a' Choire Dhuibh Bhig (915 metres) in the foreground and the two Munro summits in the background. Slioch seen from the shores of Loch Maree The area is well known for its spectacular mountain scenery, especially the Torridon Hills which includes such peaks as Beinn Eighe and Liathach. Although many peaks in the North-west highlands exhibit Torridon geology, the Torridon hills are generally considered only to be those in the Torridon Forest to the north of Glen Torridon. Specifically, these are: * Liathach * Beinn Eighe * Beinn Alligin * Beinn Dearg The Torridon Hills exhibit some of the most dramatic mountain scenery in the British Isles, surpassed in grandeur probably only by the Cuillins of Skye. The landscape around the village is dominated by the Torridonian sandstone, a Precambrian and very old rock formation. Each of the Torridon Hills sits very much apart from each other, and they are often likened to castles. They have steep terraced sides, and broken summit crests, riven into many pinnacles. There are many steep gullies running down the terraced sides. The summit ridges provide excellent scrambling, and are popular with hill walkers and mountaineers. However, like many ridge routes, there are few escape points, so once committed, the scrambler or hillwalker must complete the entire ridge before descent. Roads In 2005 and 2006, the narrow, winding A832 road that snakes into the valley and the village from Glen Docherty in the south-east, was widened and improved for easier access. Climate As with the rest of the British Isles and Scotland, Kinlochewe experiences a maritime climate (K√∂ppen Cfb). The weather station has the lowest average annual level of sunshine for any low level site in the British Isles, at just over 890 hours a year. Some of this may be due to the relief of the surrounding area rather than cloud cover obscuring the sun, but nonetheless, the western highlands are typically the cloudiest part of the country, in general not receiving much more than 1100 hours a year. Rainfall, at over a year, is higher than in most low-level sites in the British Isles. Temperature extremes since 1960 have ranged from in February 1960, to during July 2006. The lowest temperature to be recorded in recent years was during December 2010.

Palmer, a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) who is a retired Church Educational System instructor and Institute director with a master's degree in history. Palmer's stated purpose in writing the book was to incorporate recent critical historical and scholarly studies of LDS history in an orthodox defense of the faith. He states that his aim is to \\"increase faith, not diminish it.\\" Overview of the book The book concludes that: *Joseph Smith mistranslated a number of documents including the Book of Abraham and that he used the King James Bible extensively in constructing the Book of Mormon. *The Book of Mormon is most likely pieced together from sources that have been established to be available to Smith (King James Bible, local revival evangelism, Smith family biography/dreams, American antiquities; he has later also included the War of 1812 and anti-masonic hysteria to that list); therefore the book is not a translation from ancient golden plates. Regardless, these plates were not used and often not even present during dictation to scribes‚Äîinstead Smith translated by looking into a hat with a stone placed in it, and he was in the earlier stages separated from his scribe by a blanket hung between them (and later used other methods to distance those transcribing). *DNA evidence demonstrates that the origin of Native Americans is not as claimed in the Book of Mormon. *The King James Bible is a source for numerous Book of Mormon stories; many of these stories contain anachronisms and King James translators' errors copied in erroneous form into the Book of Mormon. Palmer asks, \\"Why would God reveal to Joseph Smith a faulty KJV text?\\" *Many theological issues addressed in the Book of Mormon probably derived from Smith's Upstate New York religious environment (as opposed to the golden plates he claimed to be translating from). *There are more parallels between a published story by E.T.A. Hoffmann and Smith's account of the angel Moroni's visits than could possibly be coincidence. *In spite of the LDS Church's current claims, evidence shows that none of the eleven witnesses claimed to have actually seen the physical gold plates. Instead, they reported visualizing them \\"with spiritual eyes\\" in a prayer-induced trance state. *Smith's claim to have been personally ordained by John the Baptist, Peter, James and John as resurrected beings, was not at all what Smith originally claimed. Instead, this evolved over a number of years from the original claim that didn't involve any beings such as the previously mentioned New Testament figures. *The LDS Church's official claim that Joseph Smith claimed to have been visited by God the Father and Jesus Christ as two separate beings \\"is not supported by the historical evidence\\" either in the number of beings alleged seen or in the year and circumstances as now officially claimed. Palmer's book suggests that the foundation events were rewritten by Joseph Smith, Oliver Cowdery and other early church officials. This reworking made the stories more useful for missionary work. Palmer asks, \\"Is it right to tell religious allegories to adults as if they were literal history?\\" LDS response to Palmer's book Mormon apologists dispute Palmer's claim that his intent is to \\"increase faith\\", and instead regard him as a skeptic. Some speculate that Palmer may be a cultural Mormon, whose research has led him to believe that the Church is not entirely what it claims to be. Palmer argues that \\"faith needs to be built on truth--what is, in fact, true and believable\\". This statement can be perceived to be in opposition to the methods used by practitioners of what has been termed \\"faithful history\\". Critics of \\"faithful history\\" argue that this sort of scholarship often appears to be based on conclusions, not evidence. Mark Ashurst-McGee, an LDS member, states that Palmer presents only one side of an issue and only uses evidence that supports his own views. According to Ashurst-McGee, Palmer used the Hurlbut affidavits from Eber D. Howe's book Mormonism Unvailed for the purpose of \\"overlaying run-of-the-mill treasure lore\\" onto Joseph Smith's original account of the recovery of the golden plates. Response to LDS criticism of Palmer's book Responding to five negative reviews of Palmer's book by FARMS (the LDS affiliated Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies), Ron Priddis states: \\"Is nothing beyond the reach of sarcasm by FARMS polemicists?\\" Priddis refers to the book reviews by FARMS as \\"tabloid scholarship.\\" Church action against Palmer Palmer was disfellowshipped from the Church in December 2004. Palmer has been quoted as saying that he still loves the church, and is pleased he wasn't excommunicated. A disfellowshipped member retains church membership but loses certain privileges. In 2010, Palmer resigned his membership in the church and did not reinstate it before his death in 2017. NotesReferences  *.

Russell is best known for his horror fiction, although he also wrote mystery and science fiction stories. His most famous short fiction is \\"Sardonicus\\", which appeared in the January 1961 issue of Playboy magazine, and was subsequently adapted by Russell into a screenplay for William Castle's film version, titled Mr. Sardonicus. American writer Stephen King called \\"Sardonicus\\" \\"perhaps the finest example of the modern gothic ever written\\". \\"Sardonicus\\" was part of a trio of stories with \\"Sanguinarius\\" and \\"Sagittarius\\". Early life Born in Chicago,Morgan, Chris. \\"Russell, Ray (Robert)\\" in Pringle, David. 1998. St. James Guide to Horror, Ghost & Gothic Writers. Detroit, MI: St. James Press, (p.494-6). Russell served in the U.S. Air Force in the South Pacific from 1943 to 1946, after which he studied at the Chicago Conservatory of Music and the Goodman Memorial Institute. Prior to becoming a writer, Russell worked for the United States Treasury. Writing career Russell's first novel was The Case Against Satan (1962), about a young girl possessed by a demon. It was published almost a decade before a more famous novel with a similar plot, The Exorcist by William Peter Blatty.Darrell Schweitzer, \\"The Devil\\" in S. T. Joshi, ed., Icons of Horror and the Supernatural: an Encyclopedia of our Worst Nightmares (Greenwood, 2007), (p. 161-186) Darrell Schweitzer described The Case Against Satan as \\"a Catholic Turn of the Screw\\" and said the novel \\"succeeded brilliantly\\" in making the concept of the Devil frightening to modern readers. In the 1950s, Russell began working for Playboy magazine as a fiction editor. In this capacity Russell published a large amount of science fiction, fantasy and horror in the magazine; Russell also encouraged and promoted the fiction of Charles Beaumont. He also contributed to the Paris Review. In 1961, Russell wrote his first screenplay, Mr. Sardonicus‚Äîbased on his own short story‚Äîfor director William Castle. He would write several other screenplays over the next five years, including Zotz! (1962), also for Castle. For Roger Corman he wrote the screenplays for The Premature Burial (1962) and X (1963)‚Äîthe former of which was based on the Edgar Allan Poe short story. In 1976, he published Incubus, a horror novel about a creature raping and murdering young women in a small town. He would adapt the novel for the 1982 film of the same name, directed by John Hough and starring John Cassavetes. Death Russell died of complications resulting from a stroke at a nursing home in Los Angeles, California on March 15, 1999. He was survived by his wife, Ada Szczepanski, and their two children.

He also achieved international fame for his award winning modern designs for Mexican postage and revenue stamps (1935‚Äì1953) and for his 1968 redesign of the Mexican coat of arms, still used today on Mexican government documents, coins and the national flag. Biography Eppens' paternal grandfather, Adolfo Dietrich Eppens, was born in Basel, Switzerland, and moved to Mexico in 1863, where he married Elo√≠sa Campillo of Hermosillo, Sonora. They moved to Switzerland, where Francisco Eppens Campillo, the artist's father, was born in 1888. Subsequently, the family relocated to San Luis Potos√≠, Mexico, where they operated a hardware business. The artist's father married Mercedes Helguera (b. 1884) of San Luis Potos√≠, Mexico, where Eppens was born on February 1, 1913.Valdiosera pp. 13-16 & Fig. 1. In 1920, the family moved to Mexico City, where Eppens received his primary education. In 1927, he enrolled in a bachelor's degree program in engineering and architecture at the Escuela Nacional Preparatoria of the National Autonomous University of Mexico. Eppens left that program, however, and the following year studied painting and sculpture at the \\"Escuela de Artes Pl√°sticas\\" (School of Fine Arts) of the Academia de San Carlos. For a few years, Eppens designed advertisements and posters, and starting in 1930 he worked at the Industria Cinematogr√°fica Nacional as an artist.Eppens p. 31. In 1947 he married Mar√≠a Lascurain Segovia, with whom he had three children. He died in Mexico City on September 6, 1990. Postage stamp designs In 1935, Eppens was employed by the Mexican government office which produced postage stamps and government securities, the Talleres de Impresi√≥n de Estampillas y Valores de M√©xico. Between 1935 and 1951, he designed a large number of postage and revenue stamps in a modernist or Art Deco style.Valdiosera pp. 33-50. Representative examples are the Helmsman stamp from 1940, issued in connection with the Inauguration of Mexican President Manuel √Åvila Camacho, or the Wheat Sower stamp from 1942, issued to commemorate an international agricultural conference. He also designed the small, but iconic, 1939 postal tax stamp depicting a man attacked by a giant mosquito, issued to raise funds to combat malaria. His stamp designs were popular internationally, receiving awards for \\"one of the best 10 stamps in the world\\" (1939) and \\"one of the six best stamps in the world\\" (1940), both awarded by Scott's Monthly Stamp Journal, and an exhibition of his stamps was held at the Collectors Club of New York in 1944. In 2009, an exhibition of his stamps with original drawings and paintings was held in Oaxaca, Mexico, Julieta Ortiz Gait√°n, Francisco Eppens y los mensajeros del M√©xico moderno and a full length study of his stamp designs in the exhibit was published.Gaitan Paintings and Murals In 1940, Eppens became associated with the \\"Escuela Mexicana del Realismo Critico\\" characterized by nationalistic themes, and also joined the Rancho del Artista group where he met Diego Rivera and other artists. In 1950, he became part of the group known as the Frente Nacional de Artes Pl√°sticas, and in the late 1970s joined the group called Pict√≥rico Contempor√°neo A.C. In the 1940s and 1950s, Eppens painted many murals in the interiors of institutional buildings. In the 1960s, he created similar glass mosaic murals for the exteriors of buildings, as well as some large metal sculptures. In the 1970s and 1980s he primarily created paintings. Eppens' artistic style is characteristic of the Mexican Mural Renaissance and his works commonly feature characteristic Mexican themes such as Aztec and colonial architecture, scenes of folk life, farm animals, the Mexican eagle and symbol of the country, and Catholic images. Eppens' best known art works include: Paintings * Alcatraces (Calla lilies), 1965 * Contrafuertes Coloniales (Colonial buttresses), 1971 * Arquitectura Prehisp√°nica (Pre-Hispanic buildings), 1983 * La Danza de la Media Luna (Dance of the half moon), 1984 * Las Hermanas (The sisters), 1988 Murals * Faculty of Medicine at the National University of Mexico in Mexico City, 1952 Image * La Revoluci√≥n, Edificio del Partido Revolucionario Institucional, 1963.

Exhibitions Eppens' work was shown in various collective exhibitions over the years, including a group exhibit at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City in 1930, but with the exception of the 1944 exhibit of his stamps, he did not have solo exhibits until the 1980s:Eppens pp. 33-34.Valdiosera pp. 129-131. * Collectors Club of New York, New York City, 1944. * \\"Exposici√≥n Individual de Pinturas, Dibujos y Monotipos\\", Hotel Canc√∫n Sheraton, Canc√∫n, 1983. * \\"Francisco Eppens: Pintor, Escultor y Muralista\\", Instituto Cultural Caba√±as, Guadalajara, 1987. * \\"Francisco Eppens: Pintor, Escultor y Muralista\\", Museo del Palacio de Bellas Artes, Mexico City, 1987. * \\"El Mural Mexicano: Homenaje a Francisco Eppens\\", Edificio de la Sede del Partido Revolucionario Institutional, Mexico City, 1989. * \\"Francisco Eppens, Artista Potosino\\", Instituto Potosino de Bellas Artes, Mexico City, 1990. * \\"Francisco Eppens: Pintor, Escultor y Muralista\\", Casa de Cultura, San Luis Potos√≠, 1993. * \\"Exposici√≥n - Homenaje del Artista Francisco Eppens\\", Secretaria de Gobernaci√≥n, Mexico City, 1996. * \\"Francisco Eppens, Pintor Muralista\\", Museo de Arte de Quer√©taro, Quer√©taro, 1999. * \\"Francisco Eppens, Pintor Muralista\\", Edifico de la Real Caja, Centro Cultural Universitario, San Luis Potos√≠, 1999. * \\"Los Potosinos y los Simbolos Patrios\\", Museo de la Cultura Potosina, San Luis Potos√≠, 2000. * \\"Exposici√≥n - Homenaje del Artista Francisco Eppens\\", Edificio del Senado de la Rep√∫blica, Mexico City, 2000. * \\"Eppens: Mensajeros del Mexico Moderno\\", Museo de Filatelia de Oaxaca, Oaxaca, 2009.

The HRAS gene is located on the short (p) arm of chromosome 11 at position 15.5, from base pair 522,241 to base pair 525,549. HRas is a small G protein in the Ras subfamily of the Ras superfamily of small GTPases. Once bound to Guanosine triphosphate, H-Ras will activate a Raf kinase like c-Raf, the next step in the MAPK/ERK pathway.  Function  GTPase HRas is involved in regulating cell division in response to growth factor stimulation. Growth factors act by binding cell surface receptors that span the cell's plasma membrane. Once activated, receptors stimulate signal transduction events in the cytoplasm, a process by which proteins and second messengers relay signals from outside the cell to the cell nucleus and instructs the cell to grow or divide. The HRAS protein is a GTPase and is an early player in many signal transduction pathways and is usually associated with cell membranes due to the presence of an isoprenyl group on its C-terminus. HRAS acts as a molecular on/off switch, once it is turned on it recruits and activates proteins necessary for the propagation of the receptor's signal, such as c-Raf and PI 3-kinase. HRAS binds to GTP in the active state and possesses an intrinsic enzymatic activity that cleaves the terminal phosphate of this nucleotide converting it to GDP. Upon conversion of GTP to GDP, HRAS is turned off. The rate of conversion is usually slow but can be sped up dramatically by an accessory protein of the GTPase activating protein (GAP) class, for example RasGAP. In turn HRAS can bind to proteins of the Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factor (GEF) class, for example SOS1, which forces the release of bound nucleotide. Subsequently, GTP present in the cytosol binds and HRAS-GTP dissociates from the GEF, resulting in HRAS activation. HRAS is in the Ras family, which also includes two other proto- oncogenes: KRAS and NRAS. These proteins all are regulated in the same manner and appear to differ largely in their sites of action within the cell.  Clinical significance = Costello syndrome  At least five inherited mutations in the HRAS gene have been identified in people with Costello syndrome. Each of these mutations changes an amino acid in a critical region of the HRAS protein. The most common mutation replaces the amino acid glycine with the amino acid serine at position 12 (written as Gly12Ser or G12S). The mutations responsible for Costello syndrome lead to the production of an HRAS protein that is permanently active. Instead of triggering cell growth in response to particular signals from outside the cell, the overactive protein directs cells to grow and divide constantly. This uncontrolled cell division can result in the formation of noncancerous and cancerous tumors. Researchers are uncertain how mutations in the HRAS gene cause the other features of Costello syndrome (such as mental retardation, distinctive facial features, and heart problems), but many of the signs and symptoms probably result from cell overgrowth and abnormal cell  Bladder cancer  HRAS has been shown to be a proto-oncogene. When mutated, proto-oncogenes have the potential to cause normal cells to become cancerous. Some gene mutations are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in certain cells. These changes are called somatic mutations and are not inherited. Somatic mutations in the HRAS gene in bladder cells have been associated with bladder cancer. One specific mutation has been identified in a significant percentage of bladder tumors; this mutation substitutes one protein building block (amino acid) for another amino acid in the HRAS protein. Specifically, the mutation replaces the amino acid glycine with the amino acid valine at position 12 (written as Gly12Val, G12V, or H-RasV12). The altered HRAS protein is permanently activated within the cell. This overactive protein directs the cell to grow and divide in the absence of outside signals, leading to uncontrolled cell division and the formation of a tumor. Mutations in the HRAS gene also have been associated with the progression of bladder cancer and an increased risk of tumor recurrence after treatment.  Other cancers  Somatic mutations in the HRAS gene are probably involved in the development of several other types of cancer. These mutations lead to an HRAS protein that is always active and can direct cells to grow and divide without control. Recent studies suggest that HRAS mutations are common in thyroid, salivary duct carcinoma, epithelial-myoepithelial carcinoma, and kidney cancers. DNA copy- number gain of a segment containing HRAS is included in a genome-wide pattern, which was found to be correlated with an astrocytoma patient's outcome. The HRAS protein also may be produced at higher levels (overexpressed) in other types of cancer cells.

The site was started in 1999 as Blam.bungie.org based on the project's development name before it was called Halo. The site covers all Halo properties (including those associated with 343 Industries) and posts game news, rumors, and fan art and videos. Halo.Bungie.Org grew to become the most widely read Halo fansite, receiving about 600,000 page views a day in 2007. While his cofounders ceased involvement in the site, Errera continued to update the site with the occasional assistance of others. Aside from contests, Halo.Bungie.Org also coordinates charitable endeavors and fundraisers. History Claude Errera and several friends created bungie.org for developer Bungie's other video games, namely Marathon, in 1998. Before bungie.org, Errera had been involved in other Bungie-related sites. Halo.bungie.org began as \\"blam.bungie.org\\" on May 22, 1999, after information about what was to become Halo was leaked soon after the Electronic Entertainment Expo in 1999. While Errera had used his real name for previous Bungie sites, his cofounder wanted to remain anonymous. At the time, little was known about the new project other than that it was set on a ringworld‚Äîa massive ring-shaped habitat. As such, the site founders took aliases from Larry Niven's novel Ringworld; Errera assumed the name \\"Louis Wu\\", after the novel's protagonist. Though the universe's Halo megastructures turned out to have more in common with Iain Banks' Orbitals, the aliases stuck and it was too late to change them. The first Halo trailer was unveiled in July 1999, and the site was renamed. Errera and the other founders searched the web for information and provided a place on Halo.bungie.org for fans to discuss and contribute. Over time one member of staff dropped out followed by another shortly after Bungie's acquisition by Microsoft, leaving Errera the sole webmaster and the main force on the site. Errera says that the only reason he has become known as the \\"Godfather\\" of Halo is due his long-term presence in the community. Halo.Bungie.Org is unusual among large non- commercial sites in having no paid advertisements of any kind on any portion of the pages. Overview Halo.bungie.org received about 600,000 page views a day in 2007. The site covers game news and rumors, strategy, fan-made machinima, stories and art, contests and forums. In the site's early years, it received only a small amount of fan-submitted material, which ballooned and made constant site maintenance a challenge. Errera attributed the site's longevity to the fact that it provided fans with not just Halo news but a place to share their love of the franchise. At a time when there was no easy video sharing via YouTube, Halo.bungie.org posted and categorized Halo films that fans submitted. Each day, Errera read through the Halo.Bungie.Org forums, looking for interesting items to put on the news page and monitoring comments. He then checked other Halo and gaming-related sites for more news. He also approves fan movies or artwork and updates batches of new submitted content. Errera credits the site's success to its longevity; \\"When you‚Äôre there from the beginning, and you add new content every day, folks tend to come back,\\" he said. Recognition and charity Bungie has a strong relationship with bungie.org and called the page the ultimate Halo fansite. Halo.bungie.org is listed as a source on Bungie's project pages; Bungie employees frequent the Halo.bungie.org forums, often to point out a new Bungie update or answer questions from fans. Halo.bungie.org often receives promotional items from Bungie to give away in various contests. Halo Franchise development lead and former Bungie staffer Frank O'Connor noted that when he started at Bungie, HBO was included in the company's orientation. Its administrators and members have been repeatedly quoted in mainstream publications. Errera has been interviewed numerous times by gaming sites such as Microsoft's Xbox.com and mainstream media organizations such as CBS and the BBC. The site was nominated for IGN's \\"best fansite\\" award in 2005. Halo.bungie.org has used its notability to conduct several fundraisers for various causes, including raising money for Hurricane Katrina disaster relief. The site's members took part in a massive effort by the Halo community to raise money, primarily through selling collectible items through eBay auctions.Blow Me Away charity auction These auctions raised just under $11,000 for the relief effort. Members of the community also chipped in through personal means; one member held a charity Xbox live night and raised $139. In 2003, following news that community member Brian Morden's cancer had returned, the community decided to set up a donation fund to support him. Although Brian died later that year, the fund became the Brian Morden Memorial Fund.

The term has come to mostly designate the temples built by six or seven pharaohs of the Fifth Dynasty during the Old Kingdom period. However, sun temples would make a reappearance a thousand years later under Akhenaten in the New Kingdom with his building of the Karnak Temple in Thebes. Fifth Dynasty sun temples were built in two localities, Abu Gorab and Abusir, within of each other and around south of modern-day Cairo. They may have been modeled after an earlier sun temple in Heliopolis. Six or seven temples are thought to have been built, but only two have been uncovered: that of Userkaf and that of Nyuserre.Robert G Morkot, The Egyptians: An Introduction. pp. 223 The six kings associated with having built sun temples are: Userkaf, Sahure, Neferirkare, Reneferef or Neferefre, Nyuserre, and Menkauhor. Djedkare Isesi, the eighth king of the 5th Dynasty, seems to have abruptly stopped the building of sun temples. The uncovered temple of Nyuserre near the village of Abu Gorab still holds impressive remains, in particular the central altarpiece which includes a well-preserved sacrificial altar composed of a number of alabaster parts. The two found sun temples (thus far) are so destroyed that excavators rely mostly on the hieroglyphic signs in the temples' names in order to reconstruct the shape of a characteristic Egyptian sun temple features like the obelisk. However, ruins suggest that these were open air worship structured instead of enclosed.  Mythology and factual basis  According to a tale from Middle Kingdom period, \\"Tale of Djedi and the Magicians\\", the first few kings of the Fifth Dynasty were triplets and the actual progeny of the sun god Ra. There appears to be some truth behind this myth: not only were the second and third kings of the fifth dynasty brothers, but these rulers also started an unusually strong devotion to Ra that lasted throughout the V and VI Dynasties.  Discovery  The sun temples' meaning and evolution are ingrained into both the architectural and religious history of the Old Kingdom, specifically the Fifth Dynasty of Egypt and Sixth Dynasty of Egypt. The first sun temple was discovered at the end of the nineteenth century. The first of these temples discovered was Niuserre's. The second excavated was Userkaf's. Study of this type of temple did not really start until the 1950s.  Function  Debate exists as to what exactly the functions of these temples were, since they seem to have been for more than just royal funerary purposes, unlike Egyptian pyramids, but nevertheless seem to have been part of the cultic worship of kingship, since it was essential for each king to have a personal temple. According to the scholar Massimiliano Nuzzolo, during the V and VI Dynasties, \\"The Pharaoh appears to have acquired a new socio-religious meaning as 'sun- king' and 'sun god'\\". This correlates well with the fact that these sun temples are the first found instances of Egyptian monarchs dedicating large structures made from stone entirely separate from funerary pyramids.  Importance and different temples  Due to the fact that there are six to seven different names of sun temples mentioned in primary sources from this period, it is suggested there are at least six different temples. However, there is no specific term for sun temple in ancient Egyptian. The temples were also a source of great wealth and importance in ancient Egypt. The founder of the Fifth Dynasty, Userkaf, built the first temple to Ra in Abusir, a few kilometres north of the necropolis of Saqqara, where he had built his pyramid. In total, the following temples were built: * Nekhenre (Nekhen-Ra), \\"The fortress of Re\\", built by Userkaf * Sekhetre, \\"The field of Re\\", built by Sahure * Setibre, \\"The favourite place of Re\\", built by Neferirkare Kakai * Hetepre, \\"The offering place of Re\\", built by Neferefre * Conjectural: Hotepibre, \\"Satisfied is the heart of Re\\", started by Shepseskare * Shesepibre \\"Joy of the heart of Re\\", built by Nyuserre Ini * Akhetre, \\"The horizon of Re\\", built by Menkauhor Kaiu. Only the solar temples of Userkaf and Nyuserre have been discovered to date. Nyuserre's temple contains a large catalogue of inscriptions and reliefs from this king's reign. Structure The sun temples were built on the west bank of the Nile and like pyramids had one way in and one way out. Each sun temple seems to have had three main sections: first, there appears to have been a small valley temple near a canal or cultivation site; second, a short causeway led up to the desert from the small valley temple; on the desert plateau stood the third and most important part, the sun temple proper.

Located approximatively south of Pisa, the medieval town sits on the Poggio la Croce hill overlooking the Cecina Valley and the larger hilltown of Volterra, which lies just away. Local agriculture and the old copper mine provided Montecatini Val di Cecina with a degree of prosperity in the early Middle Ages. Like many Tuscan hilltop towns, its medieval aspect has been preserved precisely because lack of economic development. Today, Montecatini Val di Cecina is enjoying a small economic revival through tourism though on a modest scale. History Montecatini Val di Cecina was first settled by ancient Etruscans, who populated the nearby city of Volterra. Later it served as a Roman look-out post as it overlooks what was a busy Roman road. The castle and tower that dominate the town were built in the Middle Ages by Filippo Belforti, whose family ruled the territory for about a century. By the 11th century, Montecatini Val di Cecina was in the Catholic parish administered from nearby Gabretto. In 1351, the area came under the rule of the Bishop of Volterra. In 1452, it was absorbed into the Republic of Florence (later Grand Duchy of Tuscany), to which it belonged until the unification of Italy in 1861. The mines Since the Etruscan, the history of Montecatini Val di cecina is closely related with its copper mine which remained operational until 1907 and it is now converted to a museum. The town has given name to one of the biggest mining industries in Europe in the early 20th century, the Montecatini - Societ√† Generale per l'Industria Mineraria e Chimica, which later merged in the more famous Montedison. Other subsoil resources in the area were salt, alabaster, chalcedony, lignite and geothermal energy. Main sights Inside the village walls, which feature cylindrical towers around the perimeter, medieval buildings are tightly spaced, separated by narrow streets or alleys, and a few small piazzas. The town is dominated by the Belforti tower. Other buildings include the Palazzo Pretorio, with an elegant porch that runs underneath a cross-ribbed vaulted roof supported by six Ionian columns, and San Biagio built in the romanesque - gothic style during the 14th Century. The church has an asymmetrical shape with a very plain portal facing a side street. The church is divided by a central nave with two side aisles separated by columns. Nearby there is the frazione (village) of Querceto, with the Romanesque parish church Chiesa San Giovanni. Also on a hill, and also possessing a fortified tower that offers a commanding view of the country stretching toward Volterra and the Tyrrhenian Sea, is the village of La Sassa. An old copper mine lies between two other very old villages, Casaglia and Gello.

Life and career=Early life Lethaby was born in Barnstaple, Devon, the son of a fiercely Liberal craftsman and lay preacher. After an early apprenticeship with a local architect he found work in London in 1879 as Chief Clerk to architect Richard Norman Shaw. Shaw quickly recognized Lethaby's talent as a designer and Lethaby was to contribute significant pieces of work to major Shaw-designed buildings such as Scotland Yard in London and Cragside in Northumberland. While working for Shaw, Lethaby became involved in the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings, which campaigned to preserve the integrity and authenticity of older buildings against the Victorian practice of 'improving' them to the point of almost completely rebuilding and redesigning them. Through this he became a personal friend of Arts and Crafts Movement pioneers William Morris and Philip Webb, becoming a significant and influential member of their circle and acting as co-founder of the Art Workers Guild in 1884. He was a lifelong socialist. The Guild was formed from a nucleus drawn from two separate groups, the St George's Art Society, a group of architects who had seen service in the offices of Norman Shaw, including Ernest Newton, Mervyn Macartney, Reginald Barratt, Edwin Hardy, Lethaby and Edward Schroeder Prior, and the Fifteen, founded by the designer and writer Lewis Day and the illustrator and designer Walter Crane. Prior wrote the prospectus for the Guild. It initially met in Newton's chambers by St George's Church, Bloomsbury. Independent practice 122‚Äì124 Colmore Row, BirminghamFrom 1889 Lethaby worked only part-time for Shaw and increasingly practiced independently, designing a wide range of products‚Äîbooks, furniture and stained glass as well as buildings‚Äîexploring the mystical symbolism of medieval and non-European design and architecture: themes he was to elaborate in his first and most famous (though arguably least representative) book Architecture, Mysticism, and Myth, published in 1891. This was the first major work of architectural theory to treat architecture as a system of symbols with identifiable philosophical meanings, rather than as abstract systems of aesthetic principles. Lethaby finally left Shaw's practice in 1892 after the completion of his first major independent architectural project‚Äîthe country estate of Avon Tyrrell in Hampshire, built for Lord Manners. The next decade was Lethaby's most productive in terms of built works as his contacts in the Birmingham area, where the ideas of the arts and crafts movement were particularly well received, led to series of commissions for buildings in the Midlands or for Birmingham-based clients. He built Monkwood Cottage, Loughton, Essex, for his friend, Hubert Llewellyn Smith. London County Council In 1894 Lethaby was appointed Art Inspector to the Technical Education Board of the newly formed London County Council. Here he had a pioneering role in developing education in the fine and practical arts, most notably as the founder of the Central School of Arts and Crafts in 1896. His most significant innovations lay in breaking down academic barriers between design (perceived as an artistic and intellectual pursuit) and production (widely perceived as the less sophisticated activity of the craftsman or artisan). Lethaby believed that this was an artificial distinction and sought to have both taught as equally valuable parts of the process of producing a high quality end-product. Academic and pioneer of conservation In 1901 Lethaby was appointed the first Professor of Design at the Royal College of Art. This, coupled with his appointments as Principal of the Central School of Arts and Crafts in 1902 and as Surveyor of Westminster Abbey in 1906 meant that he was increasingly devoted to the academic study of the theory and history of architecture and design. He effectively ceased architectural practice around this time, though he remained an immensely influential figure through his writings and teaching. Lethaby's role as a guide and mentor to German Cultural Attach√© Hermann Muthesius during his investigations into English architecture was to prove particularly significant in the light of Muthesius's later role as an influence on the early pioneers of the Bauhaus. At Westminster Abbey, Lethaby was able to put into practice his belief in sympathetic and historically accurate restoration, conducting extensive research into the history of its structure and design and largely setting the template that the restoration and preservation of historic buildings was to follow for the rest of the century. Lethaby died on 17 July 1931 at Bayswater in Middlesex. He was buried in the churchyard of St Mary's Church at Hartley Wintney in Hampshire. Awards Lethaby was offered the Royal Institute of British Architects Gold Medal award but turned it down. He is the last person to have done so. Influence and reputation Lethaby has traditionally been seen by figures such as Nikolaus Pevsner as significant primarily in his role as a precursor of the early modern movement. He was the acknowledged theorist behind the work of Ernest Gimson and the group of architect-craftsmen who worked with him in Sapperton, Gloucestershire, intent to found a \\"school of rational building\\". Lethaby's emphasis on \\"good, honest building\\" is viewed as making explicit the functionalism implicit in the writings and architecture of Pugin, Ruskin and Philip Webb, with his connection to Muthesius as the means through which this idea was to influence the German modernist pioneers.

It was the joining point of the Beaufort Ironworks Tramway running to Ebbw Vale in the north, and the Monmouthshire Canal Tramway running to Newport in the south. It was closed in 1962. In 2008 the low-level line running through Crumlin resumed passenger services as the Ebbw Valley Railway, with the nearest access being at Newbridge railway station.

Biography  Lillian was born on Thursday 8 December 1887 in St Pancras, London, England.Thring Lillian (Harris). Retrieved 21 October 2016. She was the eldest of seven children born to Benjamin Harris, a marine store keeper and Elizabeth Tasker who had married in Marylebone, Middlesex earlier that year. In the early 20th century Lillian became an active member of the suffragette movement and also around this time she was working as a shop assistant in Selfridges in Oxford Street, London before moving to Australia in December 1911. Lillian lived in Melbourne and also become a suffragette there, joining the Women's Political Association and the Industrial Workers of the World. Whilst in Australia she gained a reputation for being a brilliant public speaker and newspapers reported on her talk to a Socialist audience on 'White Slaves and Militant Suffragettes' at the Gaiety Theatre, Melbourne on 18 May 1913 Having moved back to England in 1915 Lillian joined the Women's Socialist Federation, which had been set up in 1914 as the East London Federation of Suffragettes by Sylvia Pankhurst, who was to become a friend. She married Cyril Guy Thring in 1913. By 1918, Thring, as she liked to be known, had joined the North London Herald League and become active in the 'Hands off Russia' campaign as well as regularly giving talks on left platforms. On 1 November 1920, she took a leading role in the occupation of Islington Library as part of the workers movement. Originally, the occupation had been agreed by the local authorities but all those involved had to be removed by Police when they refused to leave on the mayor's request on 16 November. On 15 April 1921, a conference was called at the International Socialist Club, Hoxton to establish the National Unemployed Workers' Movement. The movement produced a fortnightly paper called 'Out of Work'; Lillian was the papers first editor. The paper had a readership of some 50,000. Lillian was arrested and bound over in the sum of ¬£5 to keep the peace on 4 October 1921 at a large demonstration concerning the unemployed. In December 1921, Lillian was arrested again and charged for an article which had been printed in 'Out of Work' that allegedly attempted to cause disaffection amongst police officers in an effort to induce them to withhold their services. She was fined ¬£10 and given 21 days in which to pay. Edward Froude, who had printed the paper, was bound over in ¬£50. Lillian may have refused to pay this fine and was sent to Holloway to pay of the debt Militant activity on behalf of the unemployed grew in the early 1920s and Lillian was highly active at this time. A small group, of which Lillian was a member, occupied a piano factory in St Pancras to persuade the workers to refuse to work overtime and to force the management to give them a wage increase. These sorts of occupations had become very common at the time. By the summer of 1921, Lillian was gaining publicity in the national and London press as 'Red Rosa', the 'mystery women with hypnotic eyes that was behind the unemployment agitation'. By August 1922, Lillian was living on Huntingdon Street, Caledonian Road in Islington. A police raid on this address found two German machine guns for which Lillian was arrested and taken into custody, but later acquitted. Whilst she was being held in custody, the headquarters of the Finsbury unemployed was renamed 'Thring Hall' in her honour. Around 1925, Lillian had moved to Battersea and during the 1926 General Strike was a member of the Battersea Council for Action. By 1927, Lillian and her husband Robert were living in Sonderburg Road, Islington and she had now become involved in the Women's Co-operative Guild as well as continuing her work with the unemployed. From the 1930s, Lillian was active in anti-Fascist politics in North London. She was also involved in union organising, especially amongst female shop workers. When the Second World War broke out, to which she was politically opposed, she helped men on the run from conscription. During the War, Lillian fell out with her son Cyril as he was working with British Intelligence at the time. By the end of the war, Lillian was a supporter of the local squatters movement and became the secretary of the Rochford branch of the Agricultural Worker's Union which became a strong force in the area with her help. Political Activity In 1920, she became a foundation member of the Islington Branch of the Communist Party but left in 1923 as she no longer agreed with it policies and attitudes. In October 1922, Lillian became a sub-agent for Shapurj Saklatvala, a member of the British Communist Party, who successfully stood with the backing of the Labour Party in Battersea North. Saklatvala was born in India in 1874 and was only the third Indian to become an MP in the Parliament of the United Kingdom. Lillian carried on her political work during the 1924 general election and was heavily involved in the July 1924 by-election in the Abbey division of Westminster supporting Fenner Brockway against Winston Churchill who stood as an independent anti-Socialist. The official Conservative candidate won by a narrow margin over Churchill but Brockway's large Socialist vote in Westminster caused a considerable sensation. Lillian's political activities attracted the attention of the Westminster Labour Party who asked her to stand as their parliamentary candidate which she refused, as she did will all subsequent offers from them. During the late 1940s until 1948, Lillian was an Independent Labour Party Councillor but joined the Official Labour Party in 1950. Personal life Whilst in Australia, Lillian met Cyril Guy Thring. Cyril was born on 10 February 1888 in Natal, South Africa to English parents. The two of them moved to Sudan in 1913 where Cyril worked as a postal official. They were married on 12 July 1913 in Khartoum. Later that year she gave birth to their only child, whose name was also Cyril. When Lillian returned to England in 1915 with her husband and their son, she was pregnant with their second child, which she lost. Cyril, Lillian's husband, died on 8 May 1917, back in Sudan at the relatively young age of 29. Around 1920, Lillian met Arthur Miller and they had a daughter born in 1921. In 1925 Lillian married Robert Harvey in Marylebone, Middlesex. Robert was born in Shoreditch, Middlesex in 1881. In 1929, Lillian gave birth to her third child, Rhona, in Islington, Middlesex. Lillian would often go under her husband's name of Harvey as but also used the aliases Thurston and Martin. Around 1935, Lillian left Robert and moved to Ashingdon near Rochford, Essex with her companion George Tasker, who was a men's hairdresser and a member of the Independent Labour Party. Death For the last three years of her life, Lillian was bedridden, she died on 13 March 1964 in Rochford.

The station opened on 6 February 2008 when services to and from Cardiff Central commenced after 46 years of being a freight-only line. A northwards extension of the line to a new terminus at Ebbw Vale Town opened on 17 May 2015, which accounts for the drop in usage in 2015‚Äì16. A direct service to Newport was expected to commence in 2018 following double-tracking and re- signalling works between Aberbeeg and Crosskeys, but this has now been pushed back to 2021. The station has been built on the site of the former Victoria station in the Victoria area of the Ebbw Vale conurbation. It consists of a single platform adjacent to Glan Ebbw Terrace, close to the A4046 Station Road. Services Today, the current service is one train per hour to Cardiff Central calling at Llanhilleth, Newbridge, Crosskeys, Risca, Rogerstone, Pye Corner and Cardiff Central, departing at 40 minutes past each hour. The journey times to Cardiff is approximately fifty minutes. Occasional services continue beyond Cardiff to Swansea, Bridgend or Maesteg.http://www.arrivatrainswales.co.uk/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=12884902121 Services are usually operated by Class 150 Sprinter units, although Class 142 & Class 143 Pacer units, Class 158 Express Sprinter and Class 175 Coradia units have been cleared to work the line. Demand for travel to and from the station was seriously under-estimated by the promoters of the line's reopening, even though the service provided was to Cardiff only and not to Newport as well, as originally assumed. For example, in 2008/09, usage at the station was forecast to be 50,000, for journeys on the lines to Cardiff and to Newport, but was actually about 250,000, for journeys on the line to Cardiff only. Part of the reason for the demand underforecast was the requirement that no demand from regeneration of the former steelworks area should be assumed. Bus interchange The station is a thirty eight minute walk (1.8 miles) from Ebbw Vale bus station (known as Inner Bypass), which is the terminus for a number of Stagecoach South Wales services to Cardiff, Abergavenny, Brynmawr, Tredegar, and other nearby villages. The station is closest served by the bus stop at Waunlwyd on the A4046. There are bus connections from here to nearby communities such as Cwm, the Garden Festival Shopping site, Ysbyty Aneurin Bevan and Ebbw Vale Town itself.

The western terminus of NY 301 is at an intersection with NY 9D in Cold Spring. Its eastern terminus is at a junction with NY 52 in Carmel. Along the way, NY 301 meets U.S. Route 9 (US 9) and the Taconic State Parkway and passes through Clarence Fahnestock State Park. The section of the route between NY 9D and US 9 is ceremoniously designated as the Sergeant Albert Ireland Memorial Highway. NY 301 was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, but only to the portion of its modern alignment west of US 9\\\\. At the same time, the section of what is now NY 301 between Kent Cliffs and Carmel became part of New York State Route 130, an east‚Äìwest route that continued southwest from Kent Cliffs to Peekskill. NY 301 was extended east to Kent Cliffs by 1932 via the Philipstown Turnpike and to Carmel by way of NY 130\\\\. Route description alt=A series of road signs in front of an intersection between two highways. The hill behind the intersection is covered in snow; electrical wires hang overhead. The western terminus of NY 301 is at a four-way junction with NY 9D in Cold Spring. At the intersection, Morris Avenue enters from the north, Chestnut Street comes in from the south, and Main Street enters from the west and leaves to the east on NY 301\\\\. The route climbs a hill into the Philipstown village of Nelsonville, where it remains Main Street until transitioning into Cold Spring Carmel Road and passing near the southeast border of the Hudson Highlands State Park. It crosses US 9, locally Albany Post Road, at Mekeel Corners and continues northeast into the woods of the Clarence Fahnestock State Park. The highway crosses over Clove Creek a few times and turns slightly towards the southeast; however, it soon resumes a northeasterly course as the Cold Spring Turnpike. Continuing through the state park, NY 301 skirts the southern bank of Lake Canopus before crossing the Taconic State Parkway in Putnam Valley. Roughly to the northeast at Mead Corners, NY 301 bears southeast toward Carmel. The road passes north of Sagamore Lake to hug the western shore of Boyds Corner Reservoir. Shortly thereafter, NY 301 follows the inside of the western fork of the West Branch Reservoir‚Äîpart of the Croton Watershed‚Äîjust southwest of the Nimham Mountain State Forest, before bisecting the body of water via a causeway. alt=Ground- level view of a causeway crossing a lake. On either side of the causeway are short stone walls. The lake's banks are surrounded by thick woods. NY 301 ends at NY 52 (Gleneida Avenue) to the north of Lake Gleneida in the county seat of Carmel. Lake Gleneida is a controlled lake, created when an original pond was dammed in 1870, that is part of New York City's water supply system. At the far end of the junction is the Putnam County Courthouse, a National Register of Historic Places-listed structure that was first constructed in 1814. The eastern terminus of NY 301 is just north of NY 52's eastern terminus at US 6. History=Philipstown Turnpike The portion of modern-day NY 301 west of Meads Corners was originally part of the Philipstown Turnpike. Initially, the county's proximity to the Hudson River supplied cheap means of transporting goods to Albany and New York City, though in the winter months, the river froze over. To resolve the issue, in 1815, the Philipstown Turnpike Company was organized to improve upon a toll road from Cold Spring to the Connecticut border. On April 15, 1815, \\"an act to incorporate the Philipstown turnpike company in the county of Putnam\\" was passed. East of the Connecticut border, the turnpike continued as the New Milford and Sherman Turnpike. NY 301's western terminus at NY 9D in Cold Spring. On the turnpike, wagons transported manufactures inland, and carried produce from the eastern part of the county. Before the advent of the railroad, the road was a business center for much of the county. One of the intentions of the turnpike was to \\"greatly promote the public good, as well contribute to their individual interest\\". However, the turnpike was eventually abandoned, because the tolls received were not sufficient to defray the expense of maintaining the road and associated bridges. The tolls were also inadequate for investors in the Philipstown Turnpike Company to make a profit. Designation and recent history NY 301 was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York to the portion of its modern alignment west of US 9\\\\. At the same time, the section of what is now NY 301 from County Route 21 (CR 21) in Kent Cliffs to NY 52 in Carmel was designated as part of NY 130, which continued southwest from Kent Cliffs to Peekskill via CR 21, Oregon Road, and Division Street. By 1932, NY 301 was extended eastward to NY 130 in Kent Cliffs by way of its modern alignment. NY 130 was replaced by an extended NY 301 from Kent Cliffs to Carmel and eliminated entirely . The section of NY 301 from the vicinity of Kittridge Drive, a local street southeast of Kent Cliffs, to NY 52 was initially county-maintained as CR 47. On April 1, 1980, ownership and maintenance of this section of the route was transferred to the state of New York as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government. The concurrent CR 47 designation was subsequently eliminated; however, the number was later reused for a former alignment of NY 301 in Kent Cliffs. On August 20, 2002, the portion of NY 301 between NY 9D and US 9 was designated as the \\"Sergeant Albert Ireland Memorial Highway\\". The ceremonial designation honors Albert L. Ireland, a U.S. Marine Corps sergeant from Cold Spring who was awarded many citations, including nine Purple Hearts, for his service during World War II and the Korean War. In June 2012, the entire roadway was designated as the Hudson River Turnpike by Putnam County with the intent of reminding \\"drivers of the picturesque landscape and historic areas along its path\\". United States Geological Survey maps (cf. the Oscawana Lake Quadrangle) designate the entire road as the \\"Cold Spring-Carmel Pike\\".

History S√®leco was born in 1965 as a spin-off from the home appliances maker Zanussi. In the first years of its life, S√®leco produced mostly black and white televisions with the Zanussi or Rex brand. The company was put up for sale in 1984, and was acquired by Gian Mario Rossignolo. He first became chairman and then main stockholder. During the 1980s, the company launched worldwide marketing campaigns and began sponsoring some of the most famous Italian soccer teams, such as S.S. Lazio. During the '90s, the company was mainly concentrated on the production of pay-TV decoders, but in 1993 suffered from a loss of competitiveness. With the intent to reshape its position and to get gave new life to the company, Gian Mario Rossignolo bought Brionvega from the Brion family, the founder. This attempt went nowhere, so the company was forced to declare failure in 1997. During the years, S√®leco has passed through ups and downs, and at the end it was overcome by the continuous changes in the electronics world. After the melt-down, the company and all its interests were bought by the Formenti family. This gave rise to the S√®leco-Formenti Group, owner of the rights for the brands S√®leco, Rex, Phonola, Imperial, Stern, Phoenix, Televideon, Kerion and Webrik. The Formenti family re-launched the company with the production of CRT-TVs. In 2000, the company suffered a strong crisis, following the price dumping made by Turkish manufacturers. This led to end of the S√®leco and Brionvega story, as the S√®leco-Formenti Group was forced to liquidation. In 2006, Trademark property were entrusted to Super//Fluo except for the Brionvega brand (bought by Sim2 Multimedia), up to the bankruptcy of company, after which S√®leco went to Selek Technology.

Cushnahan was educated at St Mary's Christian Brothers Grammar School and Queen's University, Belfast and worked as a teacher before going into politics. He worked as General Secretary of the Alliance Party from 1974 until 1982 and was a member of Belfast City Council between 1977 and 1985. In 1982 he was elected to the Prior Assembly for North Down and two years later he became the new leader of Alliance, succeeding Oliver Napier. During his tenure as leader he sought to strengthen the party's links with the British Liberal Party. The Anglo Irish Agreement was signed during this period and Cushnahan faced the difficult position of giving Alliance support to it and facing the united opposition of the Unionist parties. However, when the Assembly was dissolved in 1986, Cushnahan found it financially difficult to remain in politics and so stood down as leader in 1987 to be succeeded by John Alderdice. Two years later Cushnahan made a surprise political comeback when he moved to the Republic of Ireland and stood as a Fine Gael candidate in the 1989 election to the European Parliament, winning a seat in the Munster constituency.

It connects NY 9D in Philipstown at its northern end to US 9 in the hamlet of Graymoor, where the Appalachian Trail crosses both highways. At that intersection, NY 403 is signed as a route to the Bear Mountain Bridge. Half of its length is uphill going south. Route description NY 403 begins here at NY 9D in Philipstown NY 403 begins at an intersection with U.S. Route 9 (US 9) in the Philipstown hamlet of Graymoor. Also present at this intersection with the Appalachian Trail, which crosses US 9 at-grade. NY 403 heads up the hill overlook Graymoor to the west. NY 403 bends northwest at an old alignment of Cat Rock Road. Turning westward, NY 403 goes downhill past the Walker House, a house owned by Samuel Sloan, into the Highlands Country Club area of Philipstown. There, the route reaches an intersection with NY 9D. Present at this intersection is The Birches, a historic house built by Ralph Adams Cram. This marks the western terminus of NY 403\\\\. The road continues west as Putnam County Route 12, which descends into Garrison. History The alignment of current NY 403 was known as the Cat Rock Road, named after a local rock where a wild cat was regularly spotted. In 1932, Putnam County added Cat Rock Road along with nine other historical road sites in the village of Cold Spring. However the quality of Cat Rock Road was in rough shape in 1933. Despite some surveyors present in June 1933, local pressure was followed by demands of the town of Philipstown to rebuild Cat Rock Road. However reconstruction of the road became a political debate. Members of the Democratic Party urged reconstruction of the roadway, while the Republican Party stalled on the work. In January 1934, Putnam County Board of Supervisors passed a resolution demanding that Cat Rock Road be surveyed. The primary use of Cat Rock Road was for those trying to get to NY 9D and avoid the Bear Mountain Bridge toll. On January 23, 1934, the Board of Supervisors looked at acquiring right-of-way for the reconstruction of Cat Rock Road. On May 2, 1934, Cat Rock Road was added to the state highway map for reconstruction. However, reconstruction was delayed constantly, including Herbert Lehman's veto of construction on NY 9D in May 1934\\\\. As a result, this also delayed funding the Cat Rock Road work. Despite that, the local newspapers (The Beacon News and Peekskill Evening Star) endorsed construction of Cat Rock Road. They released editorials supporting the job noting that funding was available. However, the state released bid requests for Cat Rock Road in October 1934. Local residents were ready two weeks later to turn over some land for the reconstruction. However, construction did not start before the calendar switched to 1935. The rights-of-way were all acquired in April 1935, which changed the name legally from Cat Rock Road to Garrison‚ÄìPeekskill Road. With the road falling apart, the construction was dependent on federal funds from the Works Progress Administration. Despite the promising future, problems occurred in June 1935 noting that the State of New York had no money to fund construction and it would be requisite on all federal funds in July or August. In August 1935, the state expected the okay from the government for funding of Cat Rock Road's reconstruction. They noted the state signed off on everything and was just waiting on the federal government. Funding came through by September 1935, when bids were announced for the construction. These were led by A.E. Ottavino of Croton-on-Hudson for $152,697.70 (1935 USD). With the announcement of bids, it was expected that construction would begin in a few weeks. Construction began in October 1935 on the reconstruction of Cat Rock Road. Construction progressed into 1936, with graving and excavation work for the new road, which had a slated completion date of December 31, 1936. After a stoppage in work due to weather, construction resumed in March 1936 with the beginning of blast work. The construction continued through June 1936, with the elimination of several tight curves and more retaining wall construction. Grading was finished in early June, and concrete pouring began in August. On August 21, it was announced that Cat Rock Road would open to traffic on October 1, 1936. On September 17, 1936, the concrete was finished. Asphalt was applied to the intersections in September 1936 to help drivers. Despite the October 1 opening date, Cat Rock Road opened to both directions of traffic in late September 1936, despite some minimal work required to finish the road. The entirety of NY 403 was assigned at some point between 1933 and 1936.

Whitrow sketch by Patrick L. Gallegos Gerald James Whitrow (9 June 1912 ‚Äì 2 June 2000) was a British mathematician, cosmologist and science historian. Biography Whitrow was born on 9 June 1912 at Kimmeridge in Dorset, the elder son of William and Emily (n√©e Watkins) Whitrow. After completing school at Christ's Hospital, he obtained a scholarship at Christ Church, Oxford in 1930, earning his first degree in 1933, the MA in 1937, and the PhD in 1939. At Oxford he worked on an alternative theory of relativity with Professor Edward Arthur Milne. During World War II, he worked as a Scientific Officer for the Ministry of Supply. His work was on defence research, including ballistics, and he worked at Fort Halstead (near Sevenoaks) and Cambridge. After the war, he taught at the Imperial College, London, first as a Lecturer, then as Reader of Applied Mathematics (1951), and as Professor of the History of Mathematics in 1972. In 1955 Whitrow investigated the possibility of extradimensional space in \\"Why Physical Space Has Three Dimensions.\\"Gerald Whitrow, \\"Why Physical Space Has Three Dimensions,\\" British Journal for the Philosophy of Science, vol. 6, no. 21 (1955) He argued that if space has four dimensions and the laws of gravitation and electromagnetism remain unchanged, the inverse square law would be transformed into an inverse cube law, leading to unstable planetary orbits and atomic structures. These instabilities would worsen for dimensions larger than four. If spatial dimensions were reduced to two, the propagation and reflection of waves would be more difficult, which would reduce coherent behavior of complex systems. He concluded that life would not be possible in other than three space dimensions.Paul Davies, Cosmic Jackpot: Why Our Universe is Just Right for Life (2007) Following his 1979 retirement, he was Emeritus Professor and Senior Research Fellow of the Imperial College. For much of his life he was a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society, to which he made an extraordinary contribution by reorganizing its important library and archives when he became Chairman of the Library Committee in the early 1960s, a position he held until 1975. In 1971 he was among the founders of the British Society for the History of Science. Whitrow's interest in libraries and archives extended to the Athenaeum Club, of which he was elected a member in 1957. He served two terms on the club's Library Committee and was its chairman between 1979 and 1981. He was responsible for founding some of the various discussion groups that exist in the club and in the early 1990s he served on its Executive Committee. His main contributions were in the fields of cosmology and astrophysics, but his interests included the history and philosophy of science, with a particular focus on the concept of time. Among his publications, The Natural Philosophy of Time received special attention. His work placed him at the centre of the study of time and this led, in 1966, to his becoming the first president of the newly founded International Society for the Study of Time. Whitrow published an important paper on the cosmic background radiation (relic of the Primordial Fireball) with B. D. Yallop in 1964: Title: The background radiation in homogeneous isotropic world models, I. Authors: Whitrow, G. J. & Yallop, B. D.

It is a multi-use recreational trail suitable for bicycling, walking and horseback riding. It occupies an abandoned Chicago and North Western Railway corridor. When complete, the trail will run from Chadron to Norfolk, a length of , making it the longest rails-to-trails conversion in the United States. It is Nebraska's first state recreational trail. The trail runs across the Outback area of Nebraska. History Built by the Fremont, Elkhorn and Missouri Valley Railroad (a predecessor company of the Chicago & North Western Railway) in the late 1870s and early 1880s, the \\"Cowboy Line\\" was abandoned by the C&NW; west of Norfolk in 1992; the section east of Norfolk was abandoned in 1982. Only a small section from the 1982 abandonment was saved from Fremont to Hooper. The following year (1993), the Rails-to-Trails Conservancy purchased the railroad's right-of-way for $6.2 million and donated it to the state of Nebraska. The Nebraska Game and Parks Commission is responsible for the development and maintenance of the trail. Development of the trail has occurred at a rate of about 10 to 20 miles (15 to 30 km) each year. In the summer of 2009, the final segment between Valentine and Norfolk was completed, producing a continuous segment of 195 miles (314 km).Kane, Jerry (Fall/Winter 2009). \\"Cowboy Trail now complete from Norfolk to Valentine\\". Outdoor Nebraska p. 3. Published by Nebraska Game and Parks Commission, Lincoln, NE. A short- line railroad (the Nebkota Railway) did operate on the westernmost of the Cowboy Trail (from Chadron to Merriman) until 2007. The Cowboy Trail in that section was to be built on an easement parallel to the railroad. In view of the abandonment of the final section, details of where the last section of the Cowboy Trail will be built are still being worked out.

Major cities on the trail include (from west to east): *Chadron *Gordon *Valentine *Ainsworth *O'Neill *Neligh *Norfolk Trailheads are located in Valentine and Norfolk. Completed sections of the trail are crushed limestone. There are 221 bridges on the trail; all bridges have been converted for recreational use. The bridge across the Niobrara River east of Valentine is a quarter-mile long (400 m) and high; the bridge across Long Pine Creek at Long Pine is long and high. The trail parallels US 20 and US 275 for almost its entire length. A variety of landscapes are found along the trail: the Pine Ridge, the Sandhills, and the valleys of the Niobrara River, Long Pine Creek and the Elkhorn River.

His first language is the Amharic language, but since the 1980s he has lived in Canada so speaks and writes in English. Nega was born in Jijiga, the oldest son of Mezlekia, a bureaucrat in the Imperial government. Although initially supporting the revolution that deposed Emperor Haile Selassie, he grew strongly critical of the regime of Mengistu Haile Mariam. As a late teenager he abandoned his mother and siblings and set off with his best friend to join one of the armed rebel groups. In 1983 he left his position at Haramaya University to accept an engineering scholarship and study at Wageningen University. After two years in the Netherlands he was still unable to return home so moved to Canada instead. He has still never returned to Ethiopia. He recounted his life story in his first book, Notes from the Hyena's Belly. Published in 2000, his book won the Governor General's Award for English language non-fiction that same year. Mezlekia followed it up with the novel The God Who Begat a Jackal, which concerns an old Ethiopian myth. In 2006 his third book \\"The Unfortunate Marriage of Azeb Yitades\\" came out. Set in the period 1960 to 1990, it tells the tale of a small village in eastern Ethiopia struggling to maintain its identity and heritage as the modern world encroaches on its isolation.http://www.negamezlekia.com/the-unfortunate-marriage-of-azeb-yitades It was shortlisted as Best Book for the Commonwealth Writers‚Äô Prize, 2007.https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/canadians-win-commonwealth-writers- regional-prizes-1.663077 Controversy Shortly after Mezlekia's award win for Notes from the Hyena's Belly, poet and editor Anne Stone alleged that she had ghostwritten all but the final 20 pages of the book. While Mezlekia acknowledged that as a non-native speaker of English he needed some assistance in ensuring that his ideas made it to the page in correct English, he responded that the book was fundamentally his own and that Stone's role in the book's publication was strictly that of a copy editor, and sued Stone for defamation. The resulting controversy led to considerable debate in the Canadian press, with most critics acknowledging that it can be extremely difficult to clearly determine how much of a role an editor can take in shaping a text before they should properly be credited as a coauthor. Several scholarly theses on the nature and limits of the author/editor relationship have cited the Mezlekia case.

He attained his greatest success in the World League of American Football with the London Monarchs, where he was the league's Offensive Most Valuable Player in its inaugural season. He played college football at the University of Maryland. Early years Gelbaugh lettered in football, basketball and track at Cumberland Valley High School. He played as a quarterback, punter and placekicker. He accepted a football scholarship from the University of Maryland. As a redshirt freshman he was tried at wide receiver in the spring, before being switched back to quarterback in the fall. He spent his first two and a half years punting and as the backup to Boomer Esiason in 1983 and Frank Reich in the 1984 season. After Reich went down with a shoulder injury in Week 4 against Wake Forest, Gelbaugh took over the starting role. After a loss to Penn State in which he set a school record with 48 pass attempts, Gelbaugh and the Terps reeled off three straight victories. In Week 9, while visiting Bernie Kosar and the defending national champion Miami Hurricanes, the Hurricanes jumped out to a 31-0 lead at halftime. Gelbaugh was replaced by Reich, who led the Terps to a thrilling 42-40 comeback in the second half, a then- record comeback in college football history. Going into the following season, he was the starting quarterback for a team that was ranked #1 in the preseason poll. He passed for 2,475 yards, breaking Esiason's single-season record. He also broke the record for passing yardage in a game with 361 yards against Clemson University, led the ACC in total offense with 216.8 yards-per-game and was second in passing efficiency. Even though the team went 9-3 overall, the team had a perfect 6-0 record in the Atlantic Coast Conference, giving them the conference title. The season ended with a victory over Syracuse in the Cherry Bowl, where he passed for 223 yards and two touchdowns, and added another rushing score. Gelbaugh was named offensive MVP of the game. He finished his college career second overall in school history in yardage and third in completions. He had a 13-4 record in the games he started and became the first Terrapins quarterback with three career 300-yard games. Professional career=Struggles in Buffalo Gelbaugh was selected in the sixth round (150th overall) of the 1986 NFL Draft by the Dallas Cowboys. On August 18, he was waived after not being able to pass Reggie Collier on the depth chart. He briefly became a punter for the Saskatchewan Roughriders of the Canadian Football League and averaged 40.2 yards on 45 punts, before being waived on October 7. He also served as a backup quarterback, though he did not throw a pass. Gelbaugh signed with the Buffalo Bills in November 1986, and served as Jim Kelly's backup (he was active in 5 games). He injured his elbow during training camp the following year, and was placed on injured reserve. In 1988, he was waived and re-signed later in the week, though he still did not see any playing time and was active in only three games. Despite being waived three times by the Bills in 1989, he did see some action at the end of a game against the New York Jets, taking a knee to end the game. All told, during his time with the Bills, he was signed and waived four times. He signed with the Cincinnati Bengals in the 1990 offseason as a free agent. Even though coach Sam Wyche thought he was good enough to be a starter, he was cut before training camp was completed. In 1990, he was selling photocopiers and fax machines to make money while still looking for a job in football; he would later remark that he would sooner face a blitz than deal with secretaries. Success in Europe In the spring of 1990, the National Football League set up a developmental league for players, with several teams in Europe, called the World League of American Football. Jim Haslett, a former teammate of Gelbaugh's with the Bills, was an assistant coach with the Sacramento Surge. Haslett convinced Gelbaugh to give up selling office equipment and come back to football. The plan was for the Surge to draft Gelbaugh in the league's supplemental draft. However, the Surge passed on Gelbaugh and picked Anthony Henton, a linebacker. He ended up with the London Monarchs. London's head coach was Larry Kennan, who had worked out Gelbaugh while Kennan was an assistant with the Los Angeles Raiders. Gelbaugh didn't think the job would last, and even after being drafted, made plans to get his teaching certificate and teach at DeMatha Catholic High School in Hyattsville, Maryland. In the first game of the new league, Gelbaugh and fellow Monarchs quarterback John Witkowski led the Monarchs to victory over the Frankfurt Galaxy. Gelbaugh's 96-yard touchdown to Jon Horton was the league's first passing touchdown. In week 2, he took over the starting job full-time, and led the Monarchs to a comeback victory against the New York/New Jersey Knights in the Monarchs' home opener, the first of three straight 300-yard games for Gelbaugh. In Week 5, he threw for four touchdowns and 286 yards as the Monarchs beat the Montreal Machine 45-7. The following week, he led the Monarchs over the Raleigh-Durham Skyhawks with 361 yards and three touchdowns. After getting knocked out of a game against the Knights with a bruised shoulder in week 8, he returned the following game to throw for 325 yards and a touchdown in a victory over the Sacramento Surge. He credited much of his success to his offensive line, nicknamed the \\"Nasty Boyz\\", who allowed the fewest sacks in the league. The Monarchs finished the regular season with a loss to the Barcelona Dragons, 20-17; the loss would end up being the only one of the year. In the playoffs, Gelbaugh got revenge on the Knights for his injury by throwing for 391 yards and 5 touchdowns in a 42-26 comeback victory to send the Monarchs to the inaugural World Bowl. In the World Bowl, Gelbaugh managed the Monarchs effectively, throwing for 191 yards and two touchdowns en route to a 21-0 Monarchs victory over Barcelona. He finished the season atop several passing categories; his 2,655 yards, 92.8 passer rating, and .624 completion percentage were best in the league, and he was tied for the lead in touchdown passes (17). For his efforts, he was named Offensive Most Valuable Player of the league, earning him a $25,000 bonus. Phoenix Cardinals After his success in Europe, he initially failed to sign with an NFL team. Due to WLAF rules, any NFL team signing him would have had to pay double his WLAF salary, which ended up as $90,000 after bonuses, just to negotiate with him. In the end, the WLAF waived the fee, leaving Gelbaugh free to sign with any team. Although he was interested in joining the San Diego Chargers, he signed with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats of the CFL as a member of their practice squad. The two sides could not come to an agreement, and Gelbaugh was waived in August. He signed with the Kansas City Chiefs on August 12 and was waived seven days later. On September 18, he was signed by the Phoenix Cardinals, who were having quarterback trouble after starter Timm Rosenbach was injured for the season, and backup Tom Tupa was underperforming. After appearances in two games against Minnesota and the New York Giants, he earned his first start in a 14-10 loss to San Francisco in Week 12. A week later, he was picked off four times by the Philadelphia Eagles, and the next week he was pulled in favor of Chris Chandler after blowing a lead against the Washington Redskins. Gelbaugh played one more time in the season finale against New Orleans after Chandler was intercepted twice; Gelbaugh threw three interceptions in a Cardinals loss. Gelbaugh later announced that he would return to the Monarchs for the 1992 WLAF season; although he was contractually obligated to return, he viewed it as another opportunity for him to showcase his talents for a possible NFL return. Before his return, he was signed by the Seattle Seahawks, who picked him up as a Plan B free agent. He signed with Seattle because the Seahawks' offensive coordinator, Larry Kennan, was his coach with the Monarchs. Return to London Gelbaugh's first game back was an overtime victory over the Knights in London; he finished the day with 349 passing yards, two touchdowns, and one interception. Unfortunately, under new head coach Ray Willsey the Monarchs would go on a seven-game winless streak. The lone highlight of the season was a 45-13 drubbing of the Montreal Machine, but the Monarchs finished the season 2-7-1 and at the bottom of the European division. His numbers were down slightly from his MVP season a year earlier; he finished the season with 1,966 yards, and 11 touchdowns to 12 interceptions. Although the league suspended play after the 1992 season, Gelbaugh did not want to return anyway, citing the stress of two seasons in one year as too much. Seattle Seahawks: 1992‚Äì1996 Gelbaugh joined the Seahawks for the 1992 season, planning to be the third-string quarterback behind Dan McGwire and Kelly Stouffer. His first appearance came in relief of McGwire in week 7 against the Dallas Cowboys, but he threw an interception that was returned for a touchdown, and the Seahawks lost 27-0. With McGwire on injured reserve and Stouffer injured, Gelbaugh got the start the following week against the Los Angeles Raiders, but the Seahawks were shut out for the second consecutive week. He started the next two games, both Seahawks losses, while waiting for Stouffer to return from his shoulder injury. His next action would come in relief of Stouffer against the Denver Broncos, and he would lead the team to an improbable comeback on Monday Night Football, throwing a game- tying touchdown on the final play of regulation. The Seahawks would win the game in overtime on John Kasay's 32-yard game winner; Gelbaugh finished the evening with 164 yards and a touchdown in less than a full quarter's work. He would continue to trade time with Stouffer for the rest of the season, but the Seahawks were unable to win any more games, and finished the season with the fewest points scored in a 16-game season in league history. Although Gelbaugh was resigned for the 1993 season, his only appearance came in relief of injured starter Rick Mirer in the fourth quarter of a game against the New England Patriots. He then spent two years on the bench, only making a brief appearance in the 1994 season finale. In 1996, he started the last regular season game against the Raiders, but was injured on the second series of downs after tearing a groin muscle. Gelbaugh retired after the 1996 season. Personal life Gelbaugh's nickname while playing was \\"Blueprint\\", due to his knowledge of many different offenses. He is the Senior Vice President at Kalmia, an interior construction company in Maryland. Stan is married to Denise Del Vecchio Gelbaugh. He has two children, Paul and Elizabeth; three step-sons, Andrew, Patrick and Sam; and a grandson, Wyatt.

Although the municipality was established on 6 November 1836, the history of the region extends back to vestiges from different tribes and groups that lived in area, remoting to the pre-historic period. During this period ancient Neolithic tribes constructed dolmen funerary structures, such as the Mamoa 1 de Madorras in the Serra da Padrela (Arc√£), a monumental, yet well-preserved tomb. Also, the Castro culture of the Iron Age resulted in many of these stone fortifications scattered throughout the municipality; castros like the Castro of Sancha, Castelo dos Mouros or Castro de S√£o Domingos de Provesende, are located in sights of good visibility and natural defences, reinforced by the construction of moats and walls. The Castro of Sabrosa was actually adopted by the Romans, who left behind coins and a stone inscription dedicated to Jupiter. A Luso-Roman cemetery was also discovered in the parish of Provesende (in Quinta da Relva), and classified as a patrimony of public interest, but it was destroyed in the 1950s when the land was re-purposed for vineyards. The majority of the settlements in Sabrosa date back to the Middle Ages, and were formalized in forals bestowed by hereditary heirs of Afonso I of Portugal. Many of these settlements were actually established prior to 1143 (the establishment of the Kingdom of Portugal), such as Provesende, and have scattered paleo-Christian structures from this period, as in the cases of Arc√£, Vilar de Celas, Paredes, Provesende and Donelo. After the 15th century, records from the region began to become more detailed, identifying the residence of noblemen in the region, including the House of Pereira, where Ferdinand Magellan () was born. The life of these families were associated with the construction family estates distributed throughout the municipality. The prosperity of the region was due in part to the growth of Demarcated Region of the Douro, and through the exploitation by the Companhia Geral da Agricultura das Vinhas do Alto Douro, which was established by the Marquess of Pombal in 1756. By establishing a special wine region designation for the Douro region, he elevated the importance of the area, creating incentives to improve the production of Douro wines and improve quality exports. With the exception of Parada do Pinh√£o, S√£o Louren√ßo de Ribapinh√£o and Torre do Pinh√£o all the parishes of Sabrosa fell within the demarcated region. On 14 December 2001, UNESCO integrated the Alto Douro Vinhateiro on their list of World Heritage sites. Geography The landscape in the civil parish of Provesende { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"20\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"float:right;\\"  } The municipality of Sabrosa, with an area of approximately 180 km¬≤, is located in the district of Vila Real, within the Tourist Region of the Serra do Mar√£o. It is delimited in the north by the municipalities of Vila Pouca and Mur√ßa, in the east by Alij√≥, the west by Vila Real and Peso da R√©gua, and south by Douro River. Its configuration is reminiscent of an elongated tear-drop, oriented north-south. Sabrosa is a municipality with a geology that has been shaped by ancient forces: in the north, the area is granitic, covered in pines and extraction of aggregates; while the southern portion of the municipality is dominated by schists, promoting the feasibility of vineyards. Administratively, the municipality is divided into 12 civil parishes (freguesias): * Celeir√≥s * Covas do Douro * Gouvinhas * Parada de Pinh√£o * Pa√ßos * Provesende, Gouv√£es do Douro e S√£o Crist√≥v√£o do Douro * Sabrosa * S√£o Louren√ßo de Ribapinh√£o * S√£o Martinho de Antas e Paradela de Gui√£es * Souto Maior * Torre do Pinh√£o * Vilarinho de S√£o Rom√£o Culture The municipality is known for its embroidery, tanneries, basket-weaving, carpentry and cheesemaking. Sabrosa, which falls in the Tr√°s-os-Montes culture, has many examples of traditional gastronomy, which includes oven-brazed goat in rice (), the Cozido √† portuguesa, the bola de carne (), the typical embutidos, p√£o- de-l√≥, cavacas altas and cavaquinhas, in addition to the rich tradition of Douro and Porto wines.

Biography Barrett was born in Lexington, Nebraska. He attended Hastings College and then earned his license to become a real estate broker. Before seeking elective office, he served in the United States Navy, was a longtime real estate agent and Republican activist. He had also previously served as an administrator at his college alma mater. Barrett served as a member of the Nebraska Republican State Executive Committee in the 1960s and chaired the Nebraska arm of President Gerald Ford's campaign in 1976. In 1978, Barrett was elected to the unicameral Nebraska Legislature, where he served until his election to Congress. He was speaker of the legislature from 1987 to 1991 and generated some controversy in that position after heated state budget negotiations. In 1990, Barrett entered the Republican primary for the 3rd District after eight-term incumbent Virginia D. Smith announced her retirement. Despite being the highest-profile candidate in the field, he only won the five-way primary by 2,000 votes. He then faced fellow state senator Sandra Scofield in the general election. Although Barrett was initially thought to be a prohibitive favorite in this heavily Republican district, the race was extremely close, with Barrett only prevailing by 4,400 votes. This was the closest a Democrat had come to winning the 3rd since Smith won her first race in 1974 by only 737 votes. Barrett never faced another contest nearly that close, and was reelected four more times by well over 70 percent of the vote; the Democrats did not field a challenger in 1998. In Congress, Barrett was a low-key member who generally supported the priorities of Republican leaders. He served on the House Agriculture Committee, helping write the Freedom to Farm Act of 1996 and eventually rising to become vice chairman, as well as the Education and the Workforce Committee. Barrett retired from Congress in 2000 and resided in Lexington. He died on September 20, 2016 at age 87 at an assisted living facility in Lexington.

Etymology The name comes from the Asturian language, in which pita means \\"hen\\" and pinta means \\"painted\\" or \\"mottled\\". History The breed belongs to the Atlantic branch of domestic chickens and has common origins with other chicken breeds in the north of Spain, such as the Euskal Oiloa of the Basque Country. With the industrialisation of egg production in Asturias in the 1950s and 1960s, numbers of the breed fell dramatically, almost to the point of extinction. Recovery of the breed began between 1980 and 1990. A breeders' association, the Asociaci√≥n de Criadores de la Pita Pinta Asturiana, was founded in 2003; its 52 members have a total of 1842 birds. A herdbook was established in 2005; at the end of 2013, a total of 2172 birds were recorded.  Characteristics  The Pita Pinta is compact and of medium weight, about for males and for females. The comb is single with 5 to 7 points, smaller in hens than in cocks. The earlobes are always red, and the eyes orange. The skin is yellow, and the beak and legs yellow with black spots. There are four colour varieties, Pinta Negra (mottled black), Pinta Roxa (mottled red-brown), Blanca (white) and Abedul (black). In the Pinta Negra variety the feathers are black, edged with white, giving the characteristic mottled look. Ring size is for cocks and for hens. Use The Pita Pinta is a good, regular layer, tough and responsive to the environment. Eggs are the colour of burnt cream, with a soft texture, and weigh ReferencesFurther reading * G. Attard, P.

She was the daughter of Hugobert, seneschal of Clovis IV, and Irmina of Oeren. She was the regent of Neustria during the minority of her grandson Theudoald from 714 until 718. Biography Plectrude was described as politically active and influential upon her husband and his reign. She brought a large amount of property to the Arnulfing house.\\"Pippin II (d. 714) extended the family's influence further south by marrying Plectrude, whose family had founded the monastery at Echternach and controlled great tracts of land in the Ardennes and the middle Moselle region.\\" P. 183 During the reign of Pepin, she appears as his joint signatory in every legal instrument issued by him that is still preserved, which was unusual for this time period. Her son Grimoald was murdered in 714. She ensured Pepin II's assent that Theudoald, Grimoald's son, would be his main heir. When Pepin died soon thereafter, she took power in Neustria as regent of the under-age Theudoald. To ensure her reign, she imprisoned Charles Martel, Pepin II's son with his second wife Alpaida, in Cologne. Charles is often said to have been illegitimate, but this is considered by many today an anachronistic interpretation of his status. Charles' contemporaries most likely did not consider him illegitimate, as he was born while his mother Alpaida was married to Pepin the Frank, and noblemen practiced polygamy in this period. In 715, the Neustrian nobility rebelled against her in alliance with Radbod of Friesland and defeated her in the Battle of Compi√®gne, which took place on September 26, 715, causing her to take refuge in Cologne. Cologne was the homeland of her family clan and where she kept Pepin's money. In 716, Chilperic II, the king of the Franks, and Ragenfrid, the mayor of the palace, led an army into Austrasia, near Cologne, where Plectrude had gone. They defeated her and freed Charles Martel. The king and his mayor then turned to besiege their other rival in the city and claimed it. The treasury shortly after received recognition by the king and mayor. The juncture of these events favored Charles. In 717, he chased the king and the mayor to Paris before turning back to deal with Plectrude in Cologne. He then took the city and dispersed her adherents. Plectrude entered a convent, and died shortly after in the same year in Cologne, where she was buried in the monastery of Notre Dame which she had founded.

Historians devoted to the history of the Latter Day Saint movement may be members of a Latter Day Saint faith or non-members with an academic interest. They range from faith-promoting historians to anti- Mormon historians, but also include scholars who make an honest effort at objectivity. Range of perspective Authors of books on \\"faith-promoting history\\" are criticized as generally avoiding more controversial topics in an effort to promote faith among members. This sort of history has generally been endorsed by the leadership of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), and was encouraged by church apostle Dallin H. Oaks. :\\"Criticism is particularly objectionable when it is directed toward Church authorities, general or local. ... Evil-speaking of the Lord's anointed is in a class by itself. It is one thing to depreciate a person who exercises corporate power or even government power. It is quite another thing to criticize or depreciate a person for the performance of an office to which he or she has been called of God. It does not matter that the criticism is true. As President George F. Richards of the Council of the Twelve said in a conference address in April 1947: 'When we say anything bad about the leaders of the Church, whether true or false, we tend to impair their influence and their usefulness and are thus working against the Lord and his cause.' (CR April 1947, p. 24)\\"Dallin H. Oaks, \\"Reading Church History\\", Ninth Annual Church Educational System religious Educators' Symposium, August 16, 1985, Brigham Young University. :\\"Balance is telling both sides. This is not the mission of the official Church literature or avowedly anti-Mormon literature.Neither has any responsibility to present both sides.\\" On the opposite end of the spectrum are anti-Mormon historians, which Oaks mentioned in the above quote. Anti-Mormons generally write with the intention of disproving the claims of the LDS Church, sometimes to the point of fabricating lies about the LDS Church. Though such historians would not be considered Latter Day Saints, they could be considered Latter Day Saint historians as the LDS Church is the topic of their research. Many anti-Mormons are, in fact, non-practicing ex-Mormons and therefore may still consider themselves cultural Mormons. Other historians reject both faith-promoting history and anti-Mormon history, and seek to give a more objective analysis, basing their conclusions on actual evidence, rather than revealing selective evidence to reach their desired conclusions.

He was born in Rio de Janeiro. Biography=Early career Originally a Banco do Brasil clerk, Jaguar started sketching on a professional basis in 1952, when he offered the weekly magazine Manchete some cartoons loosely inspired by the work of the French-Hungarian cartoonist Andr√© Fran√ßois. After working for Manchete and the culture monthly Senhor, he became famous in the 1960s for his works, among whose highlights were his illustrations to the collections of satirical chronicles by Sergio Porto entitled FEBEAP√Å (acronym for \\"The Festival of Stupidities that plagues our country\\" - the chronicles dealt mostly with the petty ridicules of the Military Dictatorship in Brazil), as well as his cartoon anthology \\"√Åtila, voc√™ √© b√°rbaro\\" (\\"Attila, you're barbarous!\\"B√°rbaro\\", besides being Portuguese for \\"barbarian\\", at the time was also a Brazilian vernacular slang for \\"cool\\"\\"). In 1969 -together with his fellow cartoonists Mill√¥r Fernandes, Ziraldo and others journalistic celebrities, he founded the groundbreaking satirical newspaper O Pasquim. Critical acclaim One of his most popular creations at the time was the comic strip Chopiniks (from \\"chope\\", a Brazilian vernacular for draft beer), which was sketched by Jaguar on scripts written by Ivan Lessa. Originally designed as a means to advertise a new brand of beer, the strip was a satirical portrayal of the bohemian 1960s Rio de Janeiro intelligentsia that gathered around the neighbourhood of Ipanema, its chief characters being the bohemians Robespierre (from Maximilien Robespierre: the character was created after a friend of Jaguar's actually named Marat, after the French revolutionary) and \\"BD\\" (named after another friend of Jaguar's, the bohemian Hugo Bidet), who had as their sidekick BD's pet Sig (from \\"Sigmund\\"), a neurotic, debauched mouse (in the stories he's called a rat), who had as his real life model Bidet's pet white mouse (who died after being treated to a diet of bread crumbs drenched in vodka), but was at the same time conceived as a satirical answer to Mickey Mouse. Sig was in charge of most of the story's comic vignettes, many of whom were actual bon mots who had found their way into Jaguar's strip. Such is the case with the famous tag: \\"Intellectuals don't go to the beach. Intellectuals booze\\" (') - a phrase attributed by Jaguar to the journalist Paulo FrancisJaguar, interview, available as Adobe Acrobat document at \\\\- which is reproduced in one of the strips as being spoken by BD . In a late interview, Jaguar defined himself as a cartoonist, in the Brazilian vernacular sense of a cartum maker - cartum meaning a graphic joke based on stock models and situations, as opposed, in Jaguar's view, to caricature, which is concerned with offering satirical commentary on an actual situation. (Jaguar interview) In the portrayal of a particular milieu - that of bohemian 1960s Rio - he actually excelled, if only to be superseded by the demise of the same milieu. Pasquim foreclosure Jaguar was the last of the original Pasquim's founders that continued editing the paper through the 1980s, when the weekly had lost almost all of its customers and influence. Jaguar had to bank on the financial support of the Rio de Janeiro governor Leonel Brizola.Cf. Andr√©a Cristina de Barros Queiroz, \\"O enterro de um foli√£o: O Pasquim e os anos 1980\\", XII Encontro Regional de Hist√≥ria, ANPUH, 2006 available at When even that wasn't enough, Jaguar closed down the paper in 1991, something that left him personally bankrupt and saddened. During the 1990s, he worked as an editor at the tabloid daily A Not√≠cia.cf. http://www.colecaoopasquim.com.br/organizadores.asp In a 2001 interview, he said that \\"if I were a type who cared, I would have myself killed long ago\\".

Recurring status refers to performers who consistently act in less than three episodes out of a five-day work week, and who receive a certain sum for each episode in which they appear. This is opposed to contract status, where the performers have a contract to be paid flat fees over time‚Äîoften multi-year. Contract evaluations are periodically conducted, and actors that don't meet their \\"quota\\" may be dropped from their contract to cut costs. The practice has become widespread across the soap opera industry since the 1980s. Description In the U.S. soap opera industry, actors billed as recurring status are paid a certain sum for each episode in which they appear. Conversely, actors on contract are paid a flat fee over a timeframe‚Äîoften multi-year. Recurring performers consistently perform in less than three episodes out of a five-day work week whereas contract roles are guaranteed to appear in a certain number of episodes each week. Actors on contract are also committed to working for the show and cannot leave until the contract has expired; recurring roles allow actors to take other jobs. Contract evaluations are typically done every fiscal quarter, and the actors that don't meet their \\"quota\\" of episodes are in danger of being dropped from their contract to cut costs. Former contract actors may then return as recurring cast members, and recurring actors can be promoted to a contract role. Dynamics Almost unheard of from the beginning of television until the 1980s, more and more actors have been placed on \\"recurring\\" so the production company in charge of making the show doesn't go over-budget. Dwindling viewership and economic downturn have led to all U.S. soaps to placing actors (usually veterans who have been with the series in excess of ten years, and who are usually acclimated to higher salary figures) on recurring. Some actors accept the move to recurring status, while other actors balk at the contract cut, instead finding work on Broadway, prime time television series, or rival soap operas. Other regions On Australian and British soap operas, contract negotiations are different, and a term such as \\"recurring status\\" does not exist. However, many of those shows have guest stars that appear frequently enough that literally speaking they could be described as \\"recurring\\". In France, these employees are called intermittents du spectacle, and they receive unemployment benefits.

Situated at the mouth of the G√∂ta River, it protected medieval Sweden's only access to the North Sea and the Atlantic Ocean, along with the nearby settlement known today as Gothenburg (formerly named L√∂d√∂se, Nya L√∂d√∂se, √Ñlvsborg and Charles IX's Gothenburg). The original Old √Ñlvsborg Fortress ( or √Ñlvsborgs slott) was located on the mainland, on the southern shore of the estuary, above modern Klippan. Only few ruins are visible today in the vicinity of the Carnegie-pier. The old fortress was dismantled and relocated to one of the islands in the estuary, in the 17th century. This New √Ñlvsborg Fortress is still maintained. In 1643, a settlement in New Sweden, North America, was named Fort Nya Elfsborg (\\"Fort New √Ñlvsborg\\"), after the Swedish fortress. This settlement was abandoned in 1655. Gothenburg was the main centre for Swedes emigrating to America, and the fortress would have been one of the last sights the emigrants saw on leaving the country. Old √Ñlvsborg Fortress In medieval Sweden, √Ñlvsborg was the country's only access to the North Sea. Bohusl√§n, the area north of √Ñlvsborg, was part of Norway until 1658; Halland, the region to the south, was part of Denmark until 1645. Sweden's only Atlantic settlement, L√∂d√∂se, built about 1200, (known as \\"Gothenburg 1\\") was the first settlement located at the mouth of the G√∂ta √Ñlv. It was followed by New L√∂d√∂se (\\"Gothenburg 2\\") located near the modern town. In 1473, New L√∂d√∂se was granted substantial privileges. The Old √Ñlvsborg Fortress was built in the 14th century, located at the Klippan area near what is now the harbour entrance of Gothenburg. After the Danes easily conquered the fortress several times, fortification works was gradually expanded. New L√∂d√∂se was burned down by Danish forces in 1521, and after it was initially rebuilt at the same spot in 1526, it was later relocated (\\"Gothenburg 3\\") near the √Ñlvsborg fortress, west of the modern town. In 1563, when the Northern Seven Years' War broke out, the Swedish burned the town themselves to prevent Denmark from capturing it, and Denmark took control of √Ñlvsborg Fortress. The war ended with the Treaty of Stettin (1570), which obliged Sweden to pay 150,000 riksdaler to ransom the fortress of √Ñlvsborg.R. Nisbet Bain, Scandinavia a political history of Denmark, Norway and Sweden from 1513 to 1960: A Political History of Denmark, Norway and Sweden from 1513 to 1900, 2006, p.83, , To pay this extraordinarily high amount of money, Sweden heavily taxed all moveables in the country, resulting in further impoverishment of the war-torn population.

Built by Charles IX of Sweden, it was the first town named \\"G√∂teborg\\". The town was annihilated by Denmark in 1611, who retained possession of √Ñlvsborg between 1612 and 1619.

Considered a rare subspecies of mutants, most of them were X-Men antagonists. The original, unused name for the group was to be The Prophets, as seen on the back of the Sunspot & Gideon trading card included with X-Force #1. The characters first appeared in X-Force #10 (May 1992). Background The Externals are all mutants with the additional gift of immortality and, as expressed by Cable, they play an important role in the future and Apocalypse's rise to power. Their true origins are scattered throughout history, but its known that they all share a psychic-link with each other that separates them from other immortals as it allows them to not only sense each other and where, but allows them to summon each other at will from great distances and also allows them to sense when one rises from the dead and when one is killed. Saul, Absalom, Gideon, Nicodemus, Burke, Selene, Candra and Crule (to a lesser extent) formed the self-fashioned \\"High Lords\\", bent on playing power games and manipulating events behind the scenes. Crule was employed as an enforcer and assassin for the other High Lords, while Candra and Selene preferred to play their own schemes separately and didn't take any part on the High Lords gatherings. Each External was claimed to represent an intangible concept:X-Force (1st series) #36‚Äì37 * Absalom - despair * Burke - fortitude * Candra - guile * Cannonball - hope (His status as an External is still unclear, while his awakening was felt by all the other Externals, Selene and more recently Cable, had stated that Cannonball is not an External)X-Force #10X-Force #54Cable #151 * Crule - ferocity * Gideon - opportunity * Nicodemus - wisdom * Saul - patience * Selene - corruption * Apocalypse - evolution At one point, X-Men regular and former New Mutant Cannonball was declared an External by Cable.X-Force #8 Later, Selene betrayed her fellow ExternalsX- Force #52 and despite the efforts of X-Force, she managed to slay them by absorbing their life forces.X-Force #53 Selene ultimately escaped, but not before summarily dismissing the assumption that Cannonball was an External, calling into question Cable's conclusion and the reasons for it.X-Force #54 Yet, more recently, Cannonball was shot three times through the chest by Reverend Stryker's Purifiers, and was back up and around in a matter of hours. When asked about it, Hank McCoy mentioned Cannonball‚Äôs status as an immortal again, though it‚Äôs not sure if he was joking or not.New X-Men (2nd series) #28 Apocalypse has also been referred to as an External on several occasions; his longevity is believed by Selene to be mostly due to technological means, although Apocalypse was already many centuries old before his first encounter with the technology he would later integrate himself with. To note, Selene herself needs to maintain her supply of life force that she drains from human victims. More recently however it was revealed that all Externals previously believed to have been killed by Selene or the Legacy Virus had in fact survived.Cable #150 As it turns out, apparently the only way of effectively killing an External is by destroying their heartsCable #151 but when that happens the life-force of the slain External is channeled into the others making them virtually all powerful.Cable #154 Selene reveals she didn't accomplishing this deed herself because she could not handle the stress that came with it. Also, Selene's assumptions about Cannonball and Apocalypse not being part of the Externals cannot be taken lightly as she mentions to be a total of seven Externals when there's actually eight.Cable #154 Evidently, even after death, as long as there are at least two Externals alive in the same timeframe, those who died will simply be revived to life and health, as was the case seen with Burke, who was killed by the future version of Gideon only to be reborn as a baby with purple eyes because the present versions of Selene and Gideon were alive.Cable #154 More recently it was confirmed that Apocalypse is indeed an External and the performer of the process that created Candra's gem alongside Selene and the other Highlords eons ago. Later following the creation of a mutant nation on Krakoa, Apocalypse decided this as the right time to rescue his first Horsemen. He summoned his fellow Externals, Selene, Crule, Gideon, Saul, Candra, Nicodemus and Absolom, to the Eternal Caldera on Krakoa. Revealing his intentions to sacrifice some of their life energy to power the Arak Maw Gate, Apocalypse -- along with Selene, Gideon and Absolom, who are revealed to be a part of his plan -- quickly turns on their fellow immortals. With the unexpected help of Rictor, the group is actually able to wipe out four of the Externals and extract their life energy to fuel the crystals that powered the gateway to Arakko.Excalibur (2020) #12  Other versions = Askani  In (Earth-4935), the Externals were purged by Apocalypse who ascended to power and gained control of the entire planet up until the 39th century.  Age of Apocalypse  In the alternate reality created when the time traveling Legion killed his own father, it's unknown what happened with the Externals as only a few had made their presence known as soldiers of Apocalypse. Candra, Selene and Gideon were recruited as the first wave of Horsemen of Apocalypse.  In other media = X-Men: The Animated Series  * In the episode \\"Sanctuary Part 2\\", Saul and Gideon are seen watching Fabian Cortez announce his scheme to the Earth. * In the episode \\"Externally Yours\\", Gambit's past involvement with the respective guilds of Thieves and Assassins, as well as with the External Candra (merely known as \\"The External\\") are detailed.

We Were the Mulvaneys was featured in Oprah's Book Club in January, 2001. The novel chronicles the Mulvaneys, a seemingly perfect family living in the small, rural town of Mt. Ephraim, New York, during the latter part of the 20th century. The Mulvaneys own a successful roofing business, and are obsessed with social status. However, an incident that is hushed up in town and never spoken of again shatters the family fabric and has tragic consequences. Plot summary Michael and Corinne Mulvaney are the parents of four children: Michael Jr., Patrick, Marianne, and Judd. Living in a picture perfect farm in upstate New York, the Mulvaneys own a successful roofing company; Michael Mulvaney is considered a serious businessman. Corinne is a bubbly, earthy mother, whose life revolves around the family unit. For nearly twenty years the Mulvaney clan thrives, admired throughout the small town of Mt. Ephraim for being a model family. On St. Valentine's night 1976, after prom, Marianne Mulvaney goes to a party where she becomes intoxicated and is raped by an upperclassman, whose father is a well-respected businessman and friend of Mr. Mulvaney. Marianne's rape is the beginning of a tumultuous fifteen-year period. Her father, lost and angry, does not understand why his daughter will not press charges against her attacker. He can no longer look at his daughter the same way and sends her to live with a distant relative of Corinne's in Salamanca, New York. Marianne, moving haphazardly from place to place, continues to wait for her father to call on her, but he never does. Michael Mulvaney Sr.'s casual drinking turns into full-fledged alcoholism. Gradually, his reputation as a respected businessman disintegrates. The Mulvaneys are forced into bankruptcy and must sell the farm. Eventually, Corinne and Michael split up. For the other family members, things continue to get worse. All three of the Mulvaney boys leave home angrily, never to return. One of them \\"executes justice\\" on his sister's rapist. After many years, the Mulvaneys meet once again at a family reunion in Corinne's new home, which she shares with a friend. The family has extended to include spouses and children. Finally, the Mulvaneys come full circle and receive closure. Film adaptation The book was made into a Lifetime Television movie, also called We Were the Mulvaneys, in 2002 starring Beau Bridges (Michael Sr.), Blythe Danner (Corinne), Tammy Blanchard (Marianne), Jacob Pitts (Patrick), Thomas Guiry (Judd), and Mark Famiglietti (Michael Jr.). The film was nominated for three Emmys.

After a short career behind the scenes in the music industry, Stroud became a full-time wilderness guide, survival instructor and musician based in Huntsville, Ontario. Stroud has produced survival-themed programming for The Outdoor Life Network, The Discovery Channel, The Science Channel, and YTV. The survival skills imparted from watching Stroud's television programs have been cited by several people as the reason they lived through harrowing wilderness ordeals. Biography Stroud was born in the Mimico neighbourhood of Toronto and graduated from Mimico High School. Stroud went on to complete the Music Industry Arts program at Fanshawe College in London, Ontario. Stroud worked for several years at the Toronto-based music video channel MuchMusic, and as a songwriter for the band New Regime before a Temagami canoe trip sparked a career change. During this time he also worked as garbage collector for the City of Toronto. In 1990 Stroud became a guide for Black Feather Wilderness Adventures leading canoe excursions into the Northern Ontario wilds. It was also during this time while on a survival course he met his future wife, photographer Sue Jamison. They married in 1994 and together left for a year-long honeymoon in the remote Wabakimi area of Ontario which was to become the basis of the documentary Snowshoes and Solitude. Afterwards, the couple moved to Yellowknife in the Northwest Territories where Stroud was employed as an outdoor instructor to special needs individuals of aboriginal descent. Stroud and Jamison then settled in Huntsville, Ontario where they had two children and started both the outdoor instructional outfit Wilderness Voice and the media company Wilderness Spirit Productions. Inspired by the popularity of the television show Survivor, Stroud pitched a more authentic version of the show to The Discovery Channel Canada. Stroud produced two programs titled One Week in the Wilderness and Winter in the Wilderness for @discovery.ca in 2001. The success of these specials led to the development of Survivorman, a show that followed a similar format of leaving Stroud on his own, with minimal equipment, in the wilderness to videotape his survival experience. Film and television After his marriage to Jamison in 1994, the two of them spent one year in the Canadian wilderness to attempt a paleolithic existence. They travelled to Goldsborough Lake () deep in the Wabakimi, first building a tipi then an attached A-frame while using no metal, plastic, or otherwise manufactured tools. For the first half of the year, they took a store of traditional foods such as wild rice, squash, beaver and moose meat, bear fat, and maple sugar. In late September, Stroud's friends Doug Getgood and Fred Rowe brought in food for the next six months and chopped firewood for the couple. Stroud and Jamison built and equipped a winter cabin using an axe, a modern bow saw, and a trapper's tin wood stove left by Getgood and Rowe, along with a metal pot they found. Family and medical emergencies brought them out of the bush on three occasions. Once when Stroud's father was dying from cancer, another when they both went to be treated for giardiasis, and again when Jamison had a miscarriage. Stroud filmed their primitive living experience and released the 50 minute documentary, Snowshoes and Solitude, which was named Best Documentary at the Muskoka Film Festival and Best Film at the Waterwalker Film Festival. In 2001 Stroud produced two one-hour specials for the science news show @discovery.ca. These segments follow the same format as Survivorman with Stroud filming his own survival in the wilderness. They were originally broadcast as daily segments over the course of one week but were repackaged as two one-hour specials titled Stranded. The popularity of these pilots spawned the show Survivorman. Stroud produced 23 episodes of the show which began airing in 2004. Stroud also composed and performed the opening theme music of Survivorman. In 2006, Stroud produced a 90-minute special documenting his family's journey to building an off-the-grid home. The show, Off the Grid with Les Stroud, chronicled the process of buying property and refitting an old farm house with solar and wind power, a raincatcher and well, as well as the adjustments the Stroud family had to make to adapt to this style of living. Stroud has made multiple television appearances including on The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson, The View, The Ellen DeGeneres Show, and Larry King Live. Stroud has also hosted an episode of the Discovery channel show I Shouldn't Be Alive titled Lost In The Snow, which aired during its first season and the TV program Surviving Urban Disasters, which aired on the Science Channel and the 20th annual Shark Week on the Discovery Channel. In 2010, Stroud hosted and produced the Gemini nominated hit kids TV series Survive This and Survive This 2 (YTV, Cartoon Network) that takes teens into the wilderness to teach them how to survive by giving them some instruction and challenging them with survival scenarios. Stroud's follow-up show to Survivorman was titled Beyond Survival with Les Stroud and debuted in 2010.  Music  In addition to film making and wilderness survival, Stroud has also worked in the music industry as a professional musician. After graduation, Stroud worked both as an associate producer for the nascent music channel MuchMusic as well as production manager on music videos for artists such as Rush and Corey Hart. During this time Stroud also played in the David Bowie cover band Diamond Dogs and played lead guitar and composed music for his band New Regime which signed with RCA Records shortly after Stroud left the band. As frequently illustrated in his show Survivorman, Stroud is considered an exceptional blues harmonica player. This instrument is featured prominently in his self-titled debut CD which has been described as \\"a collection of diverse roots/blues and traditional folk, acoustic music that reflects the uniquely northern spirit of freedom and adventure.\\" Several songs off of this album can be downloaded from his official site. Stroud has performed in and around the Muskoka area and at the Orillia Blues Festival and Toronto Beaches International Jazz Festival. Stroud and The Northern Pikes have struck up a musical collaboration under the name Les Stroud and the Pikes. Throughout 2005 and 2006 they performed together live several times, and an EP born from this collaboration entitled Long Walk Home that was released in the spring of 2007.  Awards  Stroud has received several accolades as a musician. He has won \\"Best Acoustic/Folk Act\\", \\"Best Blues Act\\" and \\"Best Overall\\" awards at the Spirit of the North music festival in New Liskeard, Ontario. Stroud's documentary Snowshoes and Solitude was named Best Documentary at the Muskoka Film Festival and Best Film at the Waterwalker Film Festival. Stroud was nominated for six Gemini Awards for his work on Survivorman. In 2010, Stroud and his production team was nominated for Best Children's or Youth Non-Fiction Program or Series for Survive This. Personal life Stroud has extensive experience with survival and primitive living skills, initially training with expert David Arama. He went on to study with many others including John \\"Prairie Wolf\\" McPherson. Stroud has been an active participant in adventure racing and has competed at the Canadian championships. In late 2008, Stroud and his wife, Sue Jamison, separated.

Carpenter, 1997, \\"A giant coelophysoid (Ceratosauria) theropod from the Upper Triassic of New Mexico, USA\\", Neues Jahrbuch f√ºr Geologie und Pal√§ontologie, Abhandlungen 205 (#2): 189-208 is a dubious genus of coelophysoid theropod dinosaur named after the giant monster movie character Gojira (the Japanese name for the monster Godzilla). Etymology The composite term Gojirasaurus is derived from the name of the giant Japanese movie monster \\"Gojira\\" (Godzilla) and the Greek word \\"sauros\\" (œÉŒ±œÖœÅŒøœÇ) meaning \\"lizard\\"; thus, \\"Godzilla lizard\\". In addition, a theropod dinosaur with the name Godzillasaurus exists in the Heisei era of Godzilla films, and in that continuity is explained to be the unmutated form of Godzilla. \\"Gojira\\" was selected as a reference to the great size of this theropod, which exceeded that of its Triassic counterparts. The specific name quayi, is a reference to Quay County, New Mexico, where the holotype specimen was discovered. Gojirasaurus was described and named by Kenneth Carpenter in 1997 and the type species is Gojirasaurus quayi. Description Gojirasaurus is one of the largest meat-eating dinosaurs known from the Triassic Period, almost the size of its relative, the large coelophysoid Dilophosaurus.Parrish, J. M., and Carpenter, K., 1986, A new vertebrate fauna from the Dockum Formation (Late Triassic) of eastern New Mexico: In: The Beginning of the Age of Dinosaurs, Faunal change across the Triassic Jurassic Boundary, edited by Padian, K., Cambridge University Press, p. 151-160. The size of its tibia was 469 mm, which was comparable to that of Liliensternus (409 mm) and Dilophosaurus (555 mm), suggesting that it was a large triassic dinosaur, estimated to be about 5.5 m (18 ft) long, which can be extrapolated to a weight of approximately 150‚Äì200 kg (330‚Äì440 lb). Carpenter (1997) pointed to features of the pelvis and ankle suggesting that this was an immature individual, and could therefore have grown to even a larger size in maturity. Specimen NMMNH P-4666, which consists of only a pubis, was referred to this genus by Hunt in 1994. Classification In 1994 Adrian Hunt, in his unpublished thesis, described and named this material \\"Revueltoraptor lucasi\\" which is now considered a nomen nudum. Carpenter officially described and named UCM 47221, Gojirasaurus quayi in 1997 and classified it as a coelophysoid. The original remains attributed to this dinosaur included a serrated tooth, a cervical rib, two anterior dorsal ribs, one posterior dorsal rib, a right scapula, two gastralia, four vertebrae, one anterior chevron, a right pubis, a left tibia, and one metatarsal. Tykoski and Rowe (2004) and later Carrano et al. (2005) agreed that Gojirasaurus is more derived than DilophosaurusTykoski, R.S. & Rowe, T. (2004). \\"Ceratosauria\\". In: Weishampel, D.B., Dodson, P., & Osmolska, H. (Eds.) The Dinosauria (2nd edition). Berkeley: University of California Press. pg. 47‚Äì70 Carrano, Hutchinson and Sampson, 2005. New information on Segisaurus halli, a small theropod dinosaur from the Early Jurassic of Arizona. Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology. 25 (#4), 835‚Äì849. However, later study by Nesbitt et al. (2007) showed that the vertebrae actually belonged to the rauisuchian Shuvosaurus, and the pubis and tibia belonged to another coelophysoid, indistinguishable from the contemporary Coelophysis, making the status of Gojirasaurus as a valid genus dubious.Nesbitt, Irmis and Parker (2007). \\"A critical re-evaluation of the Late Triassic dinosaur taxa of North America.\\" Journal of Systematic Palaeontology, 5 (#2): 209‚Äì243.  Distinguishing anatomical features According to Nesbitt et al. (2007), Gojirasaurus can be distinguished based on the fact that its tibia is more robust than that of its relative Coelophysis. Mortimer (2012) has proposed that the observed difference in the leg bone might be just size-related, and not a true apomorphy. Rauhut (2003) attempted to diagnose this genus based on the fact that the mid/posterior dorsal vertebrae had taller neural spines than those observed in other coelophysoids. However, the reassignment of the dorsal vertebrae on which the diagnosis was based would render it invalid. Paleoecology The only known specimen of Gojirasaurus was discovered in the Cooper Canyon Formation of the Dockum Group near Revuelto Creek, Quay County, in New Mexico. This genus was discovered in 1981, in gray carbonaceous mudstone deposited during the Norian stage of the Late Triassic, which based on magnetostratigraphy,Molina-Garza, R. S., Geissman, J. W., and Lucas, S. G. 1993. Late Carnian-early Norian magnetostratigraphy from nonmarine strata, Chinle Group, New Mexico. was approximately 228 to 208 million years ago. This specimen is housed in the collection of the University of Colorado Museum, in Boulder, Colorado. Gojirasaurus's assignment to the Coelophysoidea, would suggest that it was a bipedal, terrestrial, actively mobile carnivore. Contemporaries of Gojirasaurus included the pseudosuchian Shuvosaurus, and the phytosaur Rutiodon.

Conrad was considered the luxury flagship brand in the Hilton Family of Brands, named after company founder Conrad Hilton, until being supplanted by The Waldorf-Astoria Collection in 2006. As of December 31, 2019, it has 39 locations with 12,550 rooms in 3 countries and territories, including two that are owned or leased with 778 rooms, 35 that are managed with 10,890 rooms, and two that are franchised with 882 rooms. History Conrad Hong Kong Conrad Centennial Singapore Barron Hilton, son of Conrad Hilton, founded Conrad Hotels, taking the name from that of his father. Hilton Hotels was, at the time, a separate company from Hilton International, and could not operate hotels outside the United States under the Hilton name. The newly named chain solved that problem. Hilton International had already started their own chain of Vista Hotels within the United States, as they faced the same prohibition on operating there under the Hilton name. The first Conrad hotel, the Conrad Jupiters Gold Coast in Australia, opened its doors in 1985. When the two Hilton chains were rejoined in 2005, the need for the Vista and Conrad names vanished. Vista was phased out, while the Conrad brand was retained as a luxury wing of Hilton. Numerous hotels have since been opened under that name in the United States.  2017 Conrad Religion Retaliation Case  In 2017, Marie Jean Pierre, a former dishwasher at the Conrad Miami Hotel, sued the Conrad in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida because the Miami hotel had violated the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 bans discrimination by employers based on race, color, religion, sex or national origin. Ms. Pierre stated that after working many years at the Conrad Miami Hotel she was fired in March 2016 for alleged misconduct, negligence, and unexcused absences. Because of her religious beliefs, she informed the human resources department that she could not work on Sundays. Ms. Pierre is a member of the Soldiers of Christ Church and stated in an interview, \\"I love God. No work on Sunday, because Sunday I honor God‚Äù. During her ten years with the hotel, the Miami hotel did not accommodate her religious beliefs and forced her to work on Sundays. To make Sunday service, Ms. Pierre would reach out to her coworkers and request to swap shifts. In 2015, her kitchen manager demanded that she come to work on Sundays. However, Ms. Pierre refused to show up to work because of religious reasons and her manager fired her from the hotel. Then in 2019, Ms. Pierre was awarded $21.5 million by a jury because the hotel scheduled her to work on Sundays even though she was not able to work. Ms. Pierre did not receive the full amount because punitive damages cannot exceed $300,000.  Hilton Response to the Coronavirus  The American Hotel & Lodging Association stated, 44% of hotel employees across the country, or up to 4 million people, could lose their jobs, either through layoffs or furloughs due to the novel coronavirus. Hotel workers who have recently been laid off are being affected and are struggling to make ends meet. In response to the COVID-19 crisis, Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. partnered with important companies to help workers who have been temporarily suspended from hotels find a short-term job. According to the Hilton Workforce Resource Center, some of the companies that are seeking temporary employees during the COVID-19 outbreak are Albertsons, Amazon, CVS, Lidl, Sunrise Senior Living, and Walgreens. Hilton is also helping local and national governments to provide housing for first responders and health care workers across the world. Hilton and American Express have begun making rooms available at no charge to frontline medical staff. These rooms will provide medical professionals a place to sleep, get some rest or self-isolate from their families to protect them. This will be offered to them through the end of May and rooms will be available in almost every Hilton brand. Each hotel offering these services will have ‚ÄúTeam Members‚Äù who have received training on health and safety measures to protect their health and the guests‚Äô health. Depending on the location, room availability may be limited.

The character, based on the Norse mythological figure Brynhildr, was created by Roy Thomas and John Buscema. First appearing in The Avengers #83 (December 1970), Valkyrie became a mainstay of the superhero team known as the Defenders and a close ally and one-time love interest of the superhero Thor. Valkyrie, also known by her Asgardian name Brunnhilde, was selected by Odin to lead his personal unit of shield-maidens, the Valkyrior. Renowned for her prowess in battle, Valkyrie is often accompanied by her winged horse Aragorn and carries the enchanted sword Dragonfang. In the 2010s, Valkyrie became a founding member of the Secret Avengers and co-leader of the Fearless Defenders with Misty Knight. Among Valkyrie's other aliases are Barbara Norris, Samantha Parrington, Sian Bowen and Annabelle Riggs, who all, at one point, hosted her spirit. Samantha Parrington, one of Valkyrie's previous hosts, later received superhuman powers and became a member of the Defenders herself. Tessa Thompson portrays the character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe films Thor: Ragnarok (2017), Avengers: Endgame (2019), and will return in Thor: Love and Thunder (2022). Publication history The Valkyrie first appeared as a guise of the Enchantress in The Avengers #83 (December 1970) and was created by Roy Thomas and John Buscema. Thomas used another iteration of the character when the Valkyrie persona was placed into a mortal woman named Samantha Parrington as an adversary for the Hulk in The Incredible Hulk #142 (August 1971). Writer Steve Englehart and artist Sal Buscema put the Valkyrie's essence into another mortal woman, Barbara Norris, in The Defenders #4 (February 1973) and had the character join the group as a longtime member. Englehart has stated that he added the Valkyrie to the Defenders \\"to provide some texture to the group\\". Steve Gerber introduced Jack Norris as the estranged husband of Barbara but the Valkyrie persona had no memory of him. Writers David Anthony Kraft and Ed Hannigan explained some of the Valykrie's backstory in The Defenders #66-68 (Dec. 1978‚ÄìFeb. 1979). Three years later, writers J. M. DeMatteis and Mark Gruenwald wrote a follow-up story in The Defenders #107-109 (May‚ÄìJuly 1982) which resolved remaining plot points from the Kraft and Hannigan story. The Valkyrie remained a member of the Defenders through most of the series' run and is apparently killed in the final issue, #152 (Feb. 1986). According to writer Peter B. Gillis, the Valkyrie's death was part of an editorial edict to free up the surviving Defenders for use in X-Factor. The character was restored to life in a Doctor Strange storyline written by Gillis in 1988 and made only a few appearances in the 1990s. In 2001, writer Kurt Busiek and co- writer/penciller Erik Larsen revived the Defenders series and restored Samantha Parrington as the mortal incarnation of the Valkyrie. The Valkyrie's Asgardian iteration was restored in a one-shot comic book and the character appeared regularly throughout the Secret Avengers series, from issue #1 (July 2010) through its final issue #37 (March 2013). Valkyrie appears in the 2013 series Fearless Defenders by Cullen Bunn and Will Sliney. Valkyrie began appearing as part of the Asgardians of the Galaxy team in 2018, and she plays a part in the War of the Realms storyline in 2019. Fictional character biography Brunnhilde was selected by Odin, King of the Gods of the realm of Asgard, to lead the Valkyrior (the Choosers of the Slain), a group of warrior goddesses who would appear over the battlefields of mortal worshippers of the Asgardian gods and choose which of the fallen were worthy to be taken to Valhalla, the land of the honored dead. Brunnhilde served capably in this capacity for centuries. According to a sentient, disembodied eye that claimed to have once belonged to Odin, the Asgardian monarch once gave his son Thor the mortal identity of the warrior Siegmund. Circumstances forced Odin to decree that Siegmund must be slain. Brunnhilde, recognizing that Odin was acting against his true wishes, sought to protect Siegmund, but Odin himself then caused Siegmund's death. Brunnhilde helped Siegmund's pregnant lover, Sieglinde get to safety. As punishment for her defiance, Odin removed Brunnhilde's Asgardian powers and immortality and cast her into a trance. She was eventually awakened by Siegfried, the son of Siegmund and Sieglinde and another mortal incarnation of Thor. Brunnhilde and Siegfried became lovers, and she made him invulnerable so long as his back was not turned on his foe. Siegfried fell under the influence of magic and betrayed her. He was later murdered, and Brunnhilde, still in love with him, leapt into his blazing funeral pyre (this part of her background was based on the Volsunga saga). Odin restored both of them to life, restoring their Asgardian roles and powers, but removing their memories of their earthly lives. It is unclear how much truth, if any, there is to this account by the eye. Brunnhilde and her fellow Valkyries continued to gather heroic mortal warriors for Valhalla until roughly a millennium ago, when Odin was forced to cease virtually all interaction with the Earth in accordance with a pact that he and the leaders of Earth's other pantheons of gods made with the extraterrestrial Celestials. From then onward, the Valkyries could only choose slain heroes from among fallen Asgardian warriors. Brunnhilde was bitter over being barred from choosing warriors on Earth and roamed Asgard in pursuit of something meaningful to do. In a tavern on the outskirts of Marmoragard, Brunnhilde encountered Amora the Enchantress, who offered her a life of adventure. For several weeks Brunnhilde accompanied the Enchantress on her conquests. Brunnhilde soon discovered Amora's immoral nature and tried to end their partnership. In response the Enchantress trapped Brunnhilde within a mystic crystal of souls. While Brunnhilde's body remained in suspended animation, her immortal soul became Amora's plaything. Over the centuries the Enchantress used Brunnhilde's spiritual essence to give the Valkyrie's powers to herself or to her pawns. Specific instances of Amora's exploitation of the Valkyrie before recent years are not yet known. The first time the Enchantress assumed the Valkyrie's physical aspect in recent years was in a plot to lead a handful of female superhumans against the male Avengers as the Lady Liberators. Her true identity was discovered and her plan thwarted. Months later, the Enchantress bestowed the Valkyrie's power upon a socialite named Samantha Parrington in an attempt to get revenge on the Hulk. Cover of The Avengers #83 (Dec. 1970) by John Buscema and Tom Palmer Finally, a woman driven mad by being trapped in another mystical dimension, Barbara Norris, was given the Valkyrie's power and consciousness by the Enchantress to help her then-allies, the group of superhumans called the Defenders, escape from the clutches of the sorceress Casiolena. Amora did not undo her spell on Norris after Casiolena's defeat. As a result, Norris' body now possessed Brunnhilda's consciousness, appearance, and powers, while Norris' own mental essence was trapped in Brunnhilde's real body in Asgard. Aware that she was an immortal essence in a mortal woman's body, the Valkyrie briefly left the Defenders in an attempt to discover Barbara Norris' past. She meets Norris' father, Alvin Denton, shortly before his death and then returns to the Defenders. It was not until a minor Asgardian warrior named Ollerus attempted to take over Valhalla that the Valkyrie's two mixed aspects met for the first time. Brunnhilde's mental essence trapped in Norris's transformed body, fought Norris‚Äô mental essence trapped in Brunnhilde's real body. At the end of that encounter, the Valkyrie's body, still possessed by Norris‚Äô mind, was consigned to Niffleheim, the realm inhabited by the spirits of the non-heroic Asgardian dead, while Brunnhilde's mind in Norris‚Äô transformed body accompanied the Defenders, who had made the other dimensional journey with her, back to Earth. For reasons yet unknown, Brunnhilde was not concerned at this time about reuniting her mind with her true body. It was not until Barbara Norris‚Äô body was murdered that the Valkyrie's spirit and mind were inadvertently freed from their mortal host. With the help of Doctor Strange's magic, Brunnhilde regained her true body, which was rescued from Niffleheim by the Enchantress. Back in her real body, Brunnhilde regained her full memory and normal warrior personality as well. Brunnhilde then battled Amora and banished her to the crystal of souls. Feeling estranged from Asgard in general and Odin in particular for their neglect of her centuries-long plight, Brunnhilde chose to return to Earth with the Defenders. Cover of The Defenders #66 (Dec. 1978) by John Buscema and Bob McLeod Odin placed the dangerously powerful self-styled goddess Moondragon into Brunnhilde's charge. Brunnhilde was to teach Moondragon humility, and Moondragon served alongside Brunnhilde in the Defenders. Brunnhilde was to take action against Moondragon should she again become a menace. Eventually Moondragon reformed, but later she fell once again under the malevolent influence of the alien entity called the Dragon of the Moon. Moondragon attacked the Defenders, but Brunnhilde, given temporary additional powers by Odin for this occasion, including the power to grow to gigantic stature, opposed her. Brunnhilde summoned other Valkyries to her aid and together with two other Defenders, the Angel and Cloud, they defeated Moondragon but failed to capture her. Months later Moondragon returned to attack the Defenders. During this encounter, her power was vastly augmented by the alien Beyonder. In order to defeat the Dragon, Brunnhilde and the Eternal called Interloper projected their immortal life forces against it. They were joined by Defenders member Andromeda and the Defenders' former foe Manslaughter, for it was necessary that Brunnhilde's and Interloper's life forces pass through \\"mortal instruments\\" in order that Moondragon be defeated as well. Joining hands, the four allies hurled the tremendous power of their combined life forces at the Dragon, Moondragon, and the Gargoyle II, whose body was now under the Dragon's control. Three other Defenders went to rescue endangered innocents, and when they returned, Brunnhilde, Interloper, Andromeda, Manslaughter, Moondragon, and Gargoyle had all seemingly been transformed into statues of ashes and dust, and the Dragon of the Moon was apparently gone. Brunnhilde was restored to life by Doctor Strange, now in the host body of a woman known as Sian Bowen. The other Defenders, Interloper, Andromeda, and Manslaughter were restored to life as well and they formed the Dragon Circle to battle the Dragon of the Moon. After the Dragon of the Moon was defeated, Brunnhilde returned to Asgard. Brunnhilde was killed in battle just before Loki's destruction of Asgard. With the return of the Asgardians to Earth, Brunnhilde was next seen as a member of the Secret Avengers. Writer Ed Brubaker confirmed that the Valkyrie on the team was indeed the original Brunnhilde. After the 2011 storyline \\"Fear Itself\\", Brunhilde seemingly defects from the Secret Avengers, embarking in a mission to steal and recover for herself the hammers used by the \\"Worthy\\", Cul's servants. She later reveals to have stopped consuming the Apples of Idunn, thus lessening her stamina and resilience and reverting to a mortal form, and as a Valkyrior she is able to seal within herself the hammers. She plans to die after the deed is over, so as to banish the worthy from the human plane of existence for the rest of eternity. At the end of the series, the All Mother (Freyja, Gaea, and Idunn) task her with selecting a new group of Valkyries. Only this time the new Valkyries are to be all women from Earth. The story continues in the 2013 The Fearless Defenders series in which Valkyrie recruits Misty Knight, Danielle Moonstar, Hippolyta, and the mortal scientist Annabelle Riggs as part of the new Valkyrior to stop Caroline le Fey, the daughter of Morgan le Fey, and the Doommaidens, corrupted undead Valkyries who have awakened in the Valkyrior's absence. During this time, Valkyrie develops a brief romance with Riggs, who later becomes host to Valkyrie's spirit after Riggs sacrifices herself to save the team. During the 2014 \\"AXIS\\" storyline, Valkyrie is among the heroes recruited by an inverted Doctor Doom to join his team of Avengers. During the 2017 \\"Monsters Unleashed\\" storyline, Valkyrie and Hippolyta are seen fighting Leviathon Tide monsters in Edinburgh. Angela recruits her to join the Asgardians of the Galaxy. During the \\"War of the Realms\\" storyline, Valkyrie and the rest of the Valkrior are massacred by Malekith and his forces invading New York where Valkyrie is beheaded by Malekith. Powers and abilities Valkyrie is the strongest of all Valkyrior. Like all her people, her body is several times denser than that of humans. She is not immortal, but she ages far more slowly than humans. Valkyrie is immune to all earthly diseases and is difficult to injure. Her Asgardian physiology grants her enhanced levels of stamina. Valkyrie can perceive the approach of death, in the form of a \\"deathglow\\" surrounding a person's body. She does not know how death will come but she can tell that it is imminent. Valkyrie can transport herself and a dying or dead body to and from the realm of the dead by willing it. Valkyrie has had extensive training in sword fighting as well as unarmed combat and horseback riding. Her natural fighting ability is among the best of all Asgardians, matched only by Sif. Weapons and equipment Valkyrie carries two weapons of choice. * An enchanted sword named Dragonfang. A wizard named Kahji-Da was said to have carved the sword from a tooth of an extra-dimensional dragon. The sword eventually passed into the possession of the Ancient One, who in turn gave it to his disciple Doctor Strange. Strange went on to return it to the Valkyrie after she had bequeathed the virtually indestructible Black Knight's Ebony Blade to its rightful owner. * An unnamed iron spear. The spear's name is Spear. Valkyrie rides a winged horse named Aragorn. Aragorn was given to her by the current Black Knight. Other characters named Valkyrie Samantha Parrington on the cover of The Order #4. Art by Carlos Pacheco. The Enchantress first transformed Samantha Parrington into the Valkyrie temporarily to gain revenge against the Hulk. On Earth, Pluto and Lorelei much later restored the Valkyrie's powers within Samantha Parrington. Pluto tricked Lorelei though, erasing her memory, draining her powers, and turning her into a duplicate of Valkyrie. While Samantha was used by Pluto to turn Earth into a realm of the dead, Lorelei was found by the Defender Nighthawk, who believed she was the real Valkyrie and made her a Defender, though she never spoke. When the Defenders tried to stop Pluto, Lorelei battled Samantha and was restored to her former self. Samantha was freed from Pluto's control and she became part of the Defenders again as Valkyrie. She and her teammate Hellcat later got an apartment together and Parrington remembered her real name when someone called her by her nickname \\"Sam\\". The two superheroines then met her parents, who thought that her transformation into Valkryie was just a phase she was going through. Much to Parrington's chagrin, her parents are proud of her and turned their mansion into the Defenders base. When Thor went insane with warrior madness, his insanity manifested as a woman, also called the Valkyrie. This Valkyrie had no relation to the regular Valkyries and had a different appearance. Other versions Ultimate Valkyrie is a 19-year-old girl named Barbara Norris who aspires to play the public role of superhero, despite, at first, having no actual powers or skills. She describes herself as a female Thor, only without the hammer, strength, or weather-powers. When Hank Pym was dismissed from the Ultimates, he decided to join the Defenders, a group of good hearted, but delusional, somewhat farcical individuals enamored with superheroes but without powers or exceptional abilities. This is how he met Barbara, who called herself \\"Thor-Girl\\", telling Pym during introductions that while she doesn't have any powers, she is extensively proficient in martial arts. This turned out to be a lie to impress Pym; she later confesses to him that she barely made it to an Orange Belt in karate and it took her several tries to pass the test. MCU-inspired version of Valkyrie on a variant cover of Exiles Vol. 3 #1 (June 2018). Art by Javier Rodriguez. Valkyrie next appears in The Ultimates 3 #1, now apparently super-powered, riding a black Pegasus and wielding a large, supposedly mystical sword that she uses to cleave Venom nearly in two, but seems to have no idea where these powers or weapons came from. At that point, she has been in a romantic live-in relationship with Thor for weeks and despite cultural differences, they are very close and allude to being in love. Since her last appearance, she appears to have been granted super strength and limited invulnerability; other superhuman attributes and abilities remain unknown. She speaks with a distinct valley girl accent, and while she does not seem to be the most intelligent of her teammates, she makes up for it with her loyalty, especially to Thor, and her big heart, along with being very powerful. At several points, she makes references to having lived a quiet, normal human life before becoming superhuman. She suggests she is more akin to Thor than it may seem, possibly meaning they may have some sort of shared Asgardian heritage. Her deepest fear is returning to the powerless, poor, and somewhat comically ordinary existence she had before. When confronted with this fear by the illusion-casting Mastermind, just before her two captors decide to assault her sexually, she is broken free of the illusion by a shadowy figure who claims to be the source of her new powers; she then retaliates by killing Mastermind and dismembering his partner Pyro, taking both his hands off at the wrists with her sword. During the 2009 \\"Ultimatum\\" storyline it is revealed that Valkyrie was killed and transported to Valhalla, the Asgardian afterlife for fallen warriors run by Hela, an Asgardian goddess, who is presented as above most other Asgardian gods in power and station. Thor learns of this and transports himself to Hela's dimension, demanding he let Valkyrie live again. Hela, then states that if he is able to overcome the challenge presented to him, he may bring Valkyrie back to the land of the living. In the middle of the ensuing battle, Thor finds that Captain America's soul is also there, having been killed in the real world as well. Thor and Capt. America win the challenge and Hela grants Thor's request, but with the catch that once a soul has entered Hela's realm, it cannot leave without being substituted, so Thor gives up his soul so that Valkyrie may live and Hela returns her to Earth, whole and unharmed (Capt. America is given a reprieve on his soul as well and is returned to the land of the living, but how this worked with the \\"Soul Quota\\" stipulation is not addressed), while Thor's soul remains in the afterlife. Valkyrie, enraged and heart broken at the loss and sacrifice of her love, joins the battle once more and attacks Magneto while trying to receive Thor's hammer and severs his arm. Magneto then uses his powers to slit her throat. She is then briefly shown, still alive, until Magneto collapses the ceiling on her. Her fate is unknown until New Ultimates where it is revealed she now wields Thor's hammer. She loses it in battle with the Defenders who now have superpowers due to Loki's intervention. She is killed in the battle which allows Thor to resurrect and face Loki. During the battle, Loki is suddenly killed by a spear thrown by Valkyrie. Although apparently alive again, she reveals that she is now a servant of Hela and departs with Loki's body but not before asking Thor to defend the Earth to which she once belonged. In January 2018, Marvel announced that a version of Valkyrie inspired by Tessa Thompson's portrayal of the character in Thor: Ragnarok would join the Exiles in a series by writer Saladin Ahmed and artist Javier Rodriguez. Ahmed said, \\"Though she's not technically from the Marvel Cinematic Universe reality, she's basically the literalization of the larger-than-her-physical-frame swagger that Tessa Thompson displayed in Thor: Ragnarok, turned up to 11.\\" Reception Valkyrie was ranked 30th in IGN's list of \\"The Top 50 Avengers\\", and 65th in Comics Buyer's Guide's \\"100 Sexiest Women in Comics\\" list.

Years prior to the film's events, the entire Valkyrie force was wiped out by Hela when Odin sent them to stop her. As the only survivor after being saved by a fellow warrior, she ended up on Sakaar, where she became one of the Grandmaster's primary warriors under the name Scrapper 142 and eventually went on to befriend the Hulk after he had also traveled there. She is alcoholic and somewhat sadistic, although this masks her PTSD and unattainable hope of running away from her problems and memories. When Thor arrives following his own battle with Hela, she is reluctant to help him escape, but changes her mind after Loki uses his powers to make her remember the past, and joins Thor and Banner in escaping. They make it to Asgard, where she helps the surviving population evacuate from Hela's undead forces. She continues to travel with her new allies, but their starship is intercepted by Thanos. Thompson stated that the character is bisexual, based on her comic book relationship with Annabelle Riggs, and convinced director Taika Waititi to shoot a glimpse of a woman walking out of Valkyrie's bedroom, but it was cut as Waititi thought it distracted from the scene's exposition. ** While Valkyrie does not appear in Avengers: Infinity War (2018), the movie's director Joe Russo revealed that she survived both Thanos' attack on the Asgardian ship and his snap at the end of the film. ** Thompson reprises the role in Avengers: Endgame (2019). She is settled into New Asgard on Earth, directing the visiting Hulk and Rocket to Thor's house when they come to recruit him for their mission to undo the snap. She later joins forces with the Avengers, the Guardians of the Galaxy, the Asgardians, and their allies in a final battle against Thanos. At the end of the film, Thor appoints her as the new ruler of New Asgard while he departs with the Guardians. ** Thompson will return as Valkyrie in the upcoming Thor: Love and Thunder, looking for her consort.

The trail is flat (and suitable for disabled access); running from Padstow to Wenford Bridge via Wadebridge and Bodmin, it is long and used by an estimated 400,000 users each year generating an income of approximately ¬£3 million a year. The trail is managed and maintained by Cornwall Council. Background history The trail follows the paths of two former rail lines: a section of the North Cornwall Railway between Padstow and Wadebridge and most of the Bodmin and Wadebridge Railway from Wadebridge to Wenford Bridge, along with a short branch from that line to Bodmin. The Bodmin and Wadebridge Railway was originally built at a cost of ¬£35,000 following a study commissioned in 1831 by local landowner Sir William Molesworth of Pencarrow. The line was intended to carry sand from the Camel estuary to inland farms for use as fertiliser. In the 1840s, England's railway network expanded towards Bodmin. The London and South Western Railway purchased the Bodmin and Wadebridge Railway in 1846 and intended to connect it to the rest of the system by a new line through North Cornwall. The line from Halwill reached Wadebridge in June 1895 and then Padstow in March 1899. Later the railway was used to ship slate and china clay from inland quarries to ships in Padstow and also transport fish landed in Padstow inland to London and other cities. When both quarrying and fishing died off, the railway lost most of its traffic. The last passenger train was in 1967, freight finally ceased in 1983, when a need to invest in new track forced closure of the line.  Current trail  Approaching Padstow, the Camel Trail crosses Petherick Creek on this bridge which formerly carried the North Cornwall Railway The railway was built so that the trains would not have any steep inclines or sharp turns. It is these characteristics which make it suitable as a cycle trail. The first bike hire in Cornwall was set up here in 1983. The trail is now owned by Cornwall Council who bought it for ¬£1 and the bike hire shops operating along it pay an annual fee to help with its maintenance. Only a small part of the trail, through Wadebridge, is on roads and shared with normal traffic. Car parking at Padstow, Wadebridge and Poley's Bridge allow the trail to be broken into sections for shorter rides. There were efforts in the 1990s to convert the northern part of the cycleway back into a railway, part of the Bodmin and Wenford Railway a heritage line, to carry china clay traffic again. This was rejected on the grounds that the cycleway provides more benefits to the local community than removing heavy lorries from the local narrow winding roads, many of which have had to be converted to one-way operation in order to allow them to carry the lorry traffic. The railway still has a long term aim to extend its operations from to Guineaport at Wadebridge alongside the cycleway. In 2006 two extensions to the trail were completed. The first was from Scarlett‚Äôs Well car park in Bodmin up into the town. The second was from Poley's Bridge near St Breward to Wenfordbridge through the old clay dries, which was made possible by Imerys donating the land.

It is a non-profit organization that exists to promote gardening and horticulture in Ottawa. This is done through a series of presentations, flower shows and workshops. The Society also carries out community beautification projects in Ottawa.  The origins of the Ottawa Horticultural Society 1854-1859  The roots of the OHS reach back to the time just before the city of Ottawa was incorporated. The first OHS was organized during a meeting held on March 9, 1854, and chaired by Mayor Friel at the town hall. Thomas McKay (1792‚Äì1855) was nominated as the first President. (He declined.) The Society was primarily involved in holding shows and it did so from its founding until 1859, when it appears that a declining number of exhibitors and volunteers to work on the shows led to the society becoming dormant.  Royal Horticultural Society of Ottawa 1862-1866  The Royal Horticultural Society of Ottawa was organized in 1862 by members from the previous society. The Society functioned until at least 1866. Although this has not been confirmed, the Society may have merged with the Ottawa Agricultural Society for a few years.  Valley of Ottawa Horticultural Society 1872-1882  The Valley of Ottawa Horticultural Society was organized in 1872 by members from the previous Royal Horticultural Society. The Society functioned until at least 1882. Some members of this Society later served in the present Society.  The founding of the present Society  In the autumn of 1892 a group of leading citizens and senior civil servants met at the City Hall to plan the launch of a local Horticultural Society. Their purpose was to create a society that would give instruction in the growing of fruits, vegetables, and flowers, and provide suitable conditions for exhibits of the produce of members‚Äô gardens in due and proper season. The inaugural meeting was on January 17, 1893, with \\"some thirty gentlemen present\\" to listen to a lecture on the newest and best horticulture techniques. Society fees were set at one dollar. The first meetings of the Society were mainly instructional, showing members how to garden. For instance, in July 1893 members heard a lecture on strawberries, followed by a panel discussion.  The activities of the Ottawa Horticultural Society over its history  The Society staged exhibits by well-known local amateur gardeners of the day such as R. B. Whyte. The Dominion Horticulturist for Canada, Dr. W. T. Macoun, was an active supporter as well as serving as President of the Society for one year. Dr. Macoun would bring new plants and display them for information to gardeners. In 1897 Lord Aberdeen, then Governor General of Canada, took an active interest in the Society and became the first Honorary Patron. Many of Canada's Governors General have been Patrons of the OHS. The Society began immediately to cultivate knowledge of horticulture in Ottawa. In 1893 it published a pamphlet that listed the best annuals, perennials, and vegetables for the Ottawa region. It published pamphlets describing how to grow flowers and vegetables; it distributed seeds and offered substantial prizes. By 1903 junior gardeners were receiving special attention. Geranium slips were given to the juniors with prizes for the best shaped plants and the most flowers. In 1916 the book \\"Ottawa, A City of Gardens\\" was published for the society by R.B. Whyte. The early members also aimed at the beautification of Ottawa and, working without a city Parks and Recreation Department, undertook many projects that would now be considered the responsibility of local government. One major project undertaken with the Parks Commission before the turn of the 20th century was the planning of plantings for the west bank of the Rideau Canal. The canal was then nothing more than a ditch with a beaten tow-path alongside, as the masonry walls had not yet been built, except at the locks. Beautification of the canal banks was an important improvement for the city. During the First World War the Society formed a Vacant Lot Association. It developed many wartime gardens, provided seeds, plants, labour (if needed), and instructional lectures to demonstrate how to \\"Grow Food and Help Win the War\\". After the war the Society re-focused on its beautification projects. The Great Depression of the 1930s saw the Society assisting in the \\"Relief Gardens for the Unemployed\\". Fostered by necessity, home gardens and public allotments achieved great importance. During World War II OHS members procured public lands, paid for ploughing and tools, and provided \\"know-how\\" for what were known as \\"Victory Gardens\\". The Society presented the first official street tree policy to Ottawa city politicians and did much to promote the adoption of the trillium as the floral emblem of Ontario. Two OHS members helped found the Ontario Horticultural Association in 1906. Today the OHS continues to present an annual series of lectures and flower shows. It also publishes a newsletter for its members and carries out community beautification projects.

Abduction of Boone's Daughter, 1855‚Äì56, detail, Amon Carter Museum of American Art He is known for an early painting of a colonial incident: his The Abduction of Boone's Daughter by the Indians (1855‚Äì56), a depiction of the 1776 capture near Boonesborough, Kentucky of Jemima Boone and two other girls by a Cherokee-Shawnee raiding party. Early life and education Born in Siegburg, Germany, Wimar immigrated to the United States at the age of 15 with his family. They settled in St. Louis, Missouri, which attracted numerous German immigrants in the major 19th century emigration. In 1846 he began studying painting with Leon Pomarede. Together they traveled up the Mississippi River. In 1852 he went to the D√ºsseldorf Academy to study with Emanuel Leutze. He is associated with the D√ºsseldorf school of painting. Career Wimar returned to St. Louis in 1856. About this time, he painted a notable incident from the colonial era, The Abduction of Boone's Daughter by the Indians (1855‚Äì1856). It was one of his first works to achieve notice in the United States. A recent exhibit at the Amon Carter Museum described the painting as showing five Indians and Jemima in a canoe, each wondering when rescuers would come for her.Exhibit at the Amon Carter Museum in Fort Worth, Texas Wimar primarily painted the themes of Indian life on the Great Plains, showing the Native American hunts of buffalo and other activities related to their nomadic lives. He also painted scenes of the emigrant wagon trains that carried pioneer settlers across the western expanses. He made two long trips in 1858 and 1859 up the Missouri River, and was inspired by his experiences and observations of Native American life. He also traveled up the Mississippi.

For an infinite crystal, the diffracted pattern is concentrated in Dirac delta function like Bragg peaks. Presence of crystalline surfaces results in additional structure along so-called truncation rods (linear regions in momentum space normal to the surface). Crystal Truncation Rod (CTR) measurements allow detailed determination of atomic structure at the surface, especially useful in cases of oxidation, epitaxial growth, and adsorption studies on crystalline surfaces. Theory Fig. 1: Crystal Truncation Rods produced by a simple cubic lattice with ideal termination A particle incident on a crystalline surface with momentum K_0 will undergo scattering through a momentum change of \\\\mathbf{Q}. If x and y represent directions in the plane of the surface and z is perpendicular to the surface, then the scattered intensity as a function of all possible values of \\\\mathbf{Q} is given by I(\\\\mathbf{Q})=\\\\frac{\\\\sin^2 \\\\left ( \\\\tfrac{1}{2}N_xQ_xa_x \\\\right )}{\\\\sin^2\\\\left (\\\\tfrac{1}{2}Q_xa_x\\\\right )}\\\\ \\\\frac{\\\\sin^2 \\\\left (\\\\tfrac{1}{2}N_yQ_ya_y \\\\right )}{\\\\sin^2 \\\\left (\\\\tfrac{1}{2}Q_ya_y \\\\right )}\\\\ \\\\frac{1+\\\\alpha^{2N_z}-2\\\\alpha^{N_z} \\\\cos \\\\left (N_zQ_zc \\\\right )}{1+\\\\alpha^2-2\\\\alpha \\\\cos \\\\left (Q_zc \\\\right )} Where \\\\alpha is the penetration coefficient, defined as the ratio of x-ray amplitudes scattered from successive planes of atoms in the crystal, and a_x, a_y, and c are the lattice spacings in the x, y, and z directions, respectively. E. Conrad (1996). \\"Diffraction Methods\\". In W. N. Unertl (Ed.), Physical Structure, pp. 279-302. Amsterdam: Elsevier Science. In the case of perfect absorption, \\\\alpha = 0, and the intensity becomes independent of Q_z, with a maximum for any \\\\mathbf{Q_{\\\\parallel}} (the component of \\\\mathbf{Q} parallel to the crystal surface) that satisfies the 2D Laue condition in reciprocal space \\\\mathbf{Q}_\\\\parallel = \\\\mathbf{G}_{hk} = h\\\\mathbf{a}^*_x + k\\\\mathbf{a}^*_y for integers h and k. This condition results in rods of intensity in reciprocal space, oriented perpendicular to the surface and passing through the reciprocal lattice points of the surface, as in Fig. 1. These rods are known as diffraction rods, or crystal truncation rods. Fig. 2: Intensity variation along a Crystal Truncation Rod from a simple cubic lattice When \\\\alpha is allowed to vary from 0, the intensity along the rods varies according to Fig. 2. Note that in the limit as \\\\alpha approaches unity, the x-rays are fully penetrating, and the scattered intensity approaches a periodic delta function, as in bulk diffraction. This calculation has been done according to the kinematic (single-scattering) approximation. This has been shown to be accurate to within a factor of 10^{-7} of the peak intensity. Adding dynamical (multiple-scattering) considerations to the model can result in even more accurate predictions of CTR intensity. Instrumentation To obtain high-quality data in X-ray CTR measurements, it is desirable that the detected intensity be on the order of at least 10^9 \\\\tfrac{photons}{mm^2s}. To achieve this level of output, the X-ray source must typically be a synchrotron source. More traditional, inexpensive sources such as rotating anode sources provide 2-3 orders of magnitude less X-ray flux and are only suitable for studying high-atomic number materials, which return a higher diffracted intensity. The maximum diffracted intensity is roughly proportional to the square of the atomic number, Z. Anode X-ray sources have been successfully used to study gold (Z=79) for example. When doing X-ray measurements of a surface, the sample is held in Ultra-High Vacuum and the X-rays pass into and out of the UHV chamber through Beryllium windows. There are 2 approaches to chamber and diffractometer design that are in use. In the first method, the sample is fixed relative to the vacuum chamber, which is kept as small and light as possible and mounted on the diffractometer. In the second method, the sample is rotated within the chamber by bellows coupled to the outside. This approach avoids putting a large mechanical load on the diffractometer goniometer, making it easier to maintain fine angular resolution. One drawback of many configurations is that the sample must be moved in order to use other surface analysis methods such as LEED or AES, and after moving the sample back into the X-ray diffraction position, it must be realigned. In some setups, the sample chamber can be detached from the diffractometer without breaking vacuum, allowing for other users to have access. For examples of X-ray CTR diffractometer apparatus, see refs 15-17 in CTR Rodscans For a given incidence angle of X-rays onto a surface, only the intersections of the crystal truncation rods with the Ewald sphere can be observed. To measure the intensity along a CTR, the sample must be rotated in the X-ray beam so that the origin of the Ewald sphere is translated and the sphere intersects the rod at a different location in reciprocal space. Performing a rodscan in this way requires accurate coordinated motion of the sample and the detector along different axes. To achieve this motion, the sample and detector are mounted in an apparatus called a four-circle diffractometer. The sample is rotated in the plane bisecting the incoming and diffracted beam and the detector is moved into the position necessary to capture the diffracted CTR intensity. Surface Structures Fig. 3: Examples of (a) miscut cubic lattice and (b) ordered surface roughness, and (c,d) the corresponding CTR profiles, respectively. Surface features in a material produce variations in the CTR intensity, which can be measured and used to evaluate what surface structures may be present. Two examples of this are shown in Fig. 3. In the case of a miscut at an angle \\\\alpha, a second set of rods is produced in reciprocal space called superlattice rods, tilted from the regular lattice rods by the same angle, \\\\alpha. The X-ray intensity is strongest in the region of intersection between the lattice rods (grey bars) and superlattice rods (black lines). In the case of ordered alternating steps, the CTR intensity is chopped into segments, as shown. In real materials, the occurrence of surface features will rarely be so regular, but these two examples show the way in which surface miscuts and roughness are manifested in the obtained diffraction patterns.

A phase angle regulating transformer, phase angle regulator (PAR, American usage), phase-shifting transformer, phase shifter (West coast American usage), or quadrature booster (quad booster, British usage), is a specialised form of transformer used to control the flow of real power on three-phase electric transmission networks. For an alternating current transmission line, power flow through the line is proportional to the sine of the difference in the phase angle of the voltage between the transmitting end and the receiving end of the line.The \\"equal area criteria\\" for power system stability requires that this angle be less than 90 degrees, so for practical purposes this angle will be measurably less than 90 degrees. Where parallel circuits with different capacities exist between two points in a transmission grid (for example, an overhead line and an underground cable), direct manipulation of the phase angle allows control of the division of power flow between the paths, preventing overload. Quadrature boosters thus provide a means of relieving overloads on heavily laden circuits and re-routing power via more favorable paths. Alternately, where an interchange partner is intentionally causing significant \\"inadvertent energy\\" to flow through an unwilling interchange partner's system, the unwilling partner may threaten to install a phase shifter to prevent such \\"inadvertent energy\\", with the unwilling partner's tactical objective being the improvement of its own system's stability at the expense of the other system's stability. As power system stability‚Äîhence reliability‚Äîis really a regional or national strategic objective, the threat to install a phase shifter is usually sufficient to cause the offending system to implement the required changes to its own system to greatly reduce or eliminate the \\"inadvertent energy\\" flowing through the offended system. The capital cost of a quadrature booster can be high: as much as four to six million GBP (6‚Äì9 million USD) for a unit rated over 2 GVA. However, the utility to transmission system operators in flexibility and speed of operation, and, more particularly, facilitating economic dispatch of generation, can soon recover the cost of ownership. Method of operation  Simplified circuit diagram of a three-phase quadrature booster. Arrows shown on shunt transformer secondary windings are movable taps; the windings have floating ends shown, and grounded centre taps (not shown). By means of a voltage derived from the supply that is first phase-shifted by 90¬∞ (hence is in quadrature), and then re-applied to it, a phase angle is developed across the quadrature booster. It is this induced phase angle that affects the flow of power through specified circuits.  Arrangement  A quadrature booster typically consists of two separate transformers: a shunt unit and a series unit. The shunt unit has its windings connected across the phases, so it produces output voltages shifted by 90¬∞ with respect to the supply. Its output is then applied as input to the series unit, which, because its secondary winding is in series with the main circuit, adds the phase-shifted component. The overall output voltage is hence the vector sum of the supply voltage and the 90¬∞ quadrature component. Tap connections on the shunt unit allow the magnitude of the quadrature component to be controlled, and thus the magnitude of the phase shift across the quadrature booster. The flow on the circuit containing the quadrature booster may be increased (boost tapping) or reduced (buck tapping). Subject to system conditions, the flow may even be bucked enough to completely reverse from its neutral-tap direction.  Illustration of effect  The one-line diagram below shows the effect of tapping a quadrature booster on a notional 100 MW generator-load system with two parallel transmission lines, one of which features a quadrature booster (shaded grey) with a tap range of 1 to 19. In the left-hand image, the quadrature booster is at its centre tap position of 10 and has a phase angle of 0¬∞. It thus does not affect the power flow through its circuit and both lines are equally loaded at 50 MW. The right-hand image shows the same network with the quadrature booster tapped down so as to buck the power flow. The resulting negative phase angle has diverted 23 MW of loading onto the parallel circuit, while the total load supplied is unchanged at 100 MW. (Note that the values used here are hypothetical; the actual phase angle and transfer in load would depend upon the parameters of the quadrature booster and the transmission lines.) Effect of tapping a quadrature booster The intended effect is opposite: equalizing power on lines where naturally one would be heavily loaded and one would be lightly loaded.

The commission has five elected members chosen in single-member districts for staggered six- year terms. Thus the commissioners have large constituencies (bigger, e.g., than congressional districts), long terms (6 years), and close involvement with issues of intense consumer interest (such as electricity bills); consequently membership on PSC has been known to serve as a springboard to even higher public office, as in the cases of Huey Long, Jimmie Davis, John McKeithen, and Kathleen Babineaux Blanco ‚ÄîPSC members who became governors of Louisiana. Jurisdiction The PSC is frequently in the news in Louisiana, largely because of its regulatory authority over investor-owned public utilities which offer electric, water, waste water, natural gas, as well as telecommunication services. It also regulates electric member-owned cooperatives, including those whose members have voted to vest the Commission with particular powers. The commission's authority does not extend within the city limits of New Orleans for electric retail services as that power is held by the city council. The PSC also is not vested with some of its regulatory authority for those electric utilities which are municipally-owned and have greater than 50 MW of load; those powers are held by the city councils for those governments, including city of Lafayette, Louisiana. It regulates intrastate transportation, including passenger carrier services, waste haulers, household goods carriers, non-consensual towing, and intrastate pipelines. These issues are inseparable from often strongly held opinions by consumers and the regulated industries. One of PSC's most-popular actions was its implementation, on January 1, 2002, of the \\"Do Not Call\\" program, which prohibits telemarketers from telephoning people who request that they not receive such calls.Louisiana Public Service Commission's DO NOT CALL Program Rules. The power of LPSC was reduced by the Supreme Court in favor of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for determining electric generation costs in Entergy Louisiana, Inc. v. Louisiana Public Service Commission. Background Ever since its founding as the Railroad Commission of Louisiana in the state constitution of 1898,The Railroad Commission of Louisiana was established in Louisiana's state constitution of 1898. The name of the Railroad Commission was changed to the Public Service Commission in the state constitution of 1921 and continued in the current state constitution adopted in 1974. the PSC has been politically powerful and involved, its districts being larger than congressional districts and the issues it has regulated (such as electricity bills) being immediately felt by voters. Thus, not surprisingly, four PSC members have been elected governor of Louisiana: Huey Pierce Long, Jr., in 1928; James Houston \\"Jimmie\\" Davis in 1944; John Julian McKeithen in 1964 and 1968; and Kathleen Babineaux Blanco in 2003. Davis recruited his 1944 and 1959 campaign manager from the PSC staff, Chris Faser, Jr., later a member of the Louisiana House from East Baton Rouge Parish. Another commissioner, Jay Blossman, abandoned the 2003 governor's race when opinion polls showed that he was making little headway. Blossman did not seek reelection in 2008. John G. Schwegmann, a New Orleans-area grocery store magnate who was defeated in the 1971 Democratic gubernatorial primary, was thereafter elected to the PSC in the second half of the 1970s. Other Louisiana political heavyweights who have served on the PSC include Wade O. Martin, Sr., patriarch of another Louisiana political family, Harvey Fields, a former Huey Long law partner, and John S. Hunt, II, of Monroe, a nephew of Huey and Earl Kemp Long, who served on the commission from 1964 to 1972, when he was unseated by Ed Kennon. Hunt's mother was Lucille Long Hunt. Ernest Clements of Oberlin in Allen Parish was another prot√©g√© of the Longs who served on the commission. Recent Elections Early in 2009 the PSC consisted of commissioners Foster L. Campbell, Jr., Jimmy Field, and Eric Skrmetta and a vacancy resulting from the resignation of Dale Sittig. Former U.S. Representative Clyde C. Holloway was effectively elected to replace Sittig when the other candidate in the special election runoff, state Senator Joe McPherson of Woodworth, conceded on April 13. Campbell, a Democrat from Bossier City, has served on the PSC since 2002, when he unseated his fellow Democrat Donald Lynn \\"Don\\" Owen of Shreveport, a former news anchor for KSLA- TV. Campbell failed in a gubernatorial bid in 2007. Owen had been elected to the PSC in 1984, when then-incumbent Edward Kennon, declined to seek a third term. Kennon's uncle was Robert F. Kennon, governor of Louisiana from 1952 to 1956. Ed Kennon, a Shreveport developer, also ran unsuccessfully for lieutenant governor in the 1971 Democratic primary. Dale Sittig of Eunice served on the PSC from 1995 to 2008, when he resigned to accept a position with the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port. On April 13, 2009, McPherson conceded to Holloway, making Holloway effectively the commissioner-elect. Holloway ran for lieutenant governor in 2003 on a gubernatorial ticket headed by then Public Service Commissioner Jay Blossman, who withdrew from the race. Holloway remained a candidate for lieutenant governor but was crushed in the primary election.\\"Senator drops out of runoff for PSC\\", New Orleans Times-Picayune, April 14, 2009, Saint Tammany Edition, p. A2. In replacing Democrat Sittig, Holloway's addition to the PSC (even including the forerunner Louisiana Railroad Commission) developed the body's first-ever Republican majority. Commissioners Jimmy Field and Eric Skrmetta are, like Holloway, Republican. Simultaneously, the PSC became the first statewide electoral group in Louisiana to develop a Republican majority since the Reconstruction era.A majority of the U.S. House delegation from Louisiana has been Republican since the 1990s, but that is at the federal level. Both houses of the Louisiana State Legislature continued to have a Democratic majority although the margin generally attenuated from the 1970s onward. In 2013, Jimmy Field (no relation to Harvey Fields) retired. He served on the PSC from 1996 to 2013 Field completed Blanco's term of office and won two further full terms. Field chose to step down rather than seek another term in 2012. Utilizing the 2010 census numbers, the Commission's electoral districts were redrawn by legislative act and the election for District 2 was the first to be contested using the new boundaries. Former Secretary of the Department of Natural Resources, Scott Angelle was elected to the seat. Angelle was eligible as his home parish of Saint Martin became included in the 2nd District upon redistricting. In succeeding Field, Angelle ran first in a field of six. He won in the open non- partisan primary held on November 6, 2012. He defeated the second-place finisher, Democrat Forest Wright, an energy-policy analyst, and fellow Republican State Representative Erich Ponti in third place, and several other Republican and No-Party candidates. In 2014, Eric Skrmetta was re-elected as the Commissioner from the 1st District defeating Democrat-turned-Republican Forest Wright. The typically obscure election was fiercely contested and colored by controversy over a firebombing incident targeted at Wright's campaign treasurer, Mario Zervigon. The key issue in the election was the ongoing rooftop solar debate. Incumbent Commissioner Skrmetta had enforced a limited cap on the number of homeowners in Louisiana who can install home solar panels and provide excess energy back to the grid under net metering. Candidate Wright supported expanding the availability of solar in the state and eliminating the cap. On November 4, Wright garnered enough votes to force a run-off, scheduled for December 6. The November 6th firebombing was questioned as being related to the contentious election. Current Commissioners *Eric Skrmetta, Republican, District 1 *Craig Greene, Republican, District 2 *Lambert Boissiere, Democrat, District 3 *Mike Francis, Republican, District 4 *Foster L. Campbell, Democrat, District 5  Controversy  The Louisiana Public Service Commission has enabled and enforced a limited cap on net metering, preventing many homeowners from across the state from installing solar panels on their homes. The cap, which is lower than almost any other state in the country, has faced criticism from homeowners who want the ability to go solar to save money on their electric bills. Some utilities in Louisiana have already begun to hit their cap. and new homeowners in those areas cannot install solar systems. If the Public Service Commission does not increase the cap, some solar companies may be forced to close or to leave the state. On March 28, 2016, the commission in a 4-1 vote approved the sale of Cleco, an energy company based in Pineville, to a group of foreign investors: Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets, British Columbia Investment Management Corporation, John Hancock Financial, and other infrastructure investors. Earlier, the commission had disapproved the sale despite support from business leaders and Cleco investors. In his opposition, Commissioner Clyde Holloway expressed fear for \\"the long term consequences of Cleco's captive ratepayers. Cleco as we know it has ceased to exist. It is now owned by a private foreign investment company that plans to flip it in eight to ten years. And that same private foreign investment company is financing the deal with a massive amount of debt. ...\\" NotesExternal links * Louisiana Public Service Commission official site * Federal Trade Commission Staff Comment with Louisiana Officials about Rules Governing Regulated Utilities/Unregulated Affiliates public service Category:Public utilities commissions of the United States ","title":"Louisiana Public Service Commission"},{"id":"3573137","text":"In Greek mythology, the name Batea or Bateia (; Ancient Greek: ŒíŒ¨œÑŒµŒπŒ±) refers to the following individuals: * Batea, daughter of Teucer.Pseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 3.12.1 * Batea, a Naiad, who married King Oebalus of Sparta.

The Mormon religion is predicated on what are said to be historical events such as the First Vision of Joseph Smith and the historicity of the Book of Mormon, which describes a detailed pre-Columbian history of the Americas.\\"The foundations of the Church are grounded in a series of historic events, without which the Restoration would be incomprehensible and impotent.\\" Douglas F. Tobler and S. George Ellsworth, \\"History, Significance to Latter- Day Saints,\\" in Daniel H. Ludlow, ed., Encyclopedia of Mormonism (New York: Macmillan, 1992), 596. Joseph Fielding Smith, the tenth president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), declared that \\"Mormonism, as it is called, must stand or fall on the story of Joseph Smith. He was either a prophet of God, divinely called, properly appointed and commissioned, or he was one of the biggest frauds this world has ever seen. There is no middle ground.\\"\\"If Joseph Smith was a deceiver, who willfully attempted to mislead the people, then he should be exposed; his claims should be refuted, and his doctrines shown to be false, for the doctrines of an impostor cannot be made to harmonize in all particulars with divine truth. If his claims and declarations were built upon fraud and deceit, there would appear many errors and contradictions, which would be easy to detect.\\" as quoted by As Jan Shipps has written, \\"Mormonism, unlike other modern religions, is a faith cast in the form of history,\\" and until after World War II, Mormons did not critically examine the historical underpinnings of their faith; any \\"profane\\" investigation of the church's history was perceived \\"as trespassing on forbidden ground.\\"Jan Shipps, Sojourner in the Promised Land: Forty Years Among the Mormons (Urbana: University of Illinois, 2000), 164-65. Although traditional Christianity is likewise a history religion,For instance, in I Corinthians 15. 14, St. Paul says, \\"if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain and your faith is also vain.\\" (KJV) few primary sources survive from two or three millennia ago, and biblical places such as Jerusalem, Jericho, and Bethlehem, are acknowledged to exist by scholars of every religious persuasion. Likewise, the Assyrian and Babylonian empires mentioned in the Bible are treated in all histories of the ancient Near East. By contrast, locations of Book of Mormon places are disputed even by Mormons, and the existence of those places is not acknowledged by any non-Mormon scholars. Martin Marty, a Lutheran scholar of American religion, has observed that LDS beginnings are so recent \\"that there is no place to hide. ... There is little protection for Mormon sacredness.\\"Martin Marty, \\"Two Integrities: An Address to the Crisis in Mormon Historiography,\\" in George D. Smith, ed., Faithful History: Essays on Writing Mormon History (Salt Lake City: Signature Books, 1992), 174. Faithful History is a collection of essays expressing different views about how to approach the history of the LDS Church. The work includes essays written by two articulate Church apologists, Louis Midgley and David Earl Bohn, although neither is a historian. \\"Mormons remember\\" As Richard and Joan Ostling have written, \\"Mormons remember.\\" There has been an official church historian since the organization of the LDS Church, and \\"Mormon youths and their sisters are exhorted to keep journals as part of their religious commitment. Missionaries are reminded by their superiors that the journals represent a part of their sacred duties.\\"Richard N. Ostling and Joan K. Osling, \\"Faithful History,\\" in Mormon America: The Power and the Promise (HarperSanFrancisco, 1999), 238-39. The pioneer era is an especially fertile field for faith-promoting history. As Wallace Stegner has written, the \\"tradition of the pioneer that is strong all through the West is a cult in Utah.\\"Wallace Stegner, The Gathering of Zion: The Story of the Mormon Trail (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1981), 2. Mormons \\"tell and retell their stories of pioneer privations and persecutions.\\" Mormon young people are often given the opportunity to pull a handcart through a patch of desert; Mormon children are early taught the miracle of the gulls, the story of seagulls that supposedly saved the crops of the earliest Utah pioneers from an invasion of crickets in 1848.Ostling, 241-42. \\"'Miracle' status apparently has grown since an 1853 General Conference mention by Apostle Orson Hyde, amplified and reinforced over the years by stories in Mormon publications and official church histories.\\" On the story of the gulls, see William G. Hartley, \\"Mormons, Crickets, and Gulls: A New Look at an Old Story,\\" in D. Michael Quinn, ed., The New Mormon History: Revisionist Essays on the Past (Salt Lake City: Signature Books, 1992), 137-151. Under church president Joseph F. Smith, the LDS Church began to purchase, refurbish, and reconstruct its sacred sites, beginning with Carthage Jail in 1903. \\"Visitors' centers, restored houses, historic parks, monuments, and trail markers sprouted everywhere.\\" In 1999, the church maintained forty-four such sites, many of which were staffed by its missionaries.Ostling, 240-41. Mormons have also developed \\"something of an annual outdoor pageant circuit\\" which serves as both a proselytizing tool and a \\"faith-affirming\\" experience to the volunteer participants and most of the audience.Ostling, 243. An elaborate Hill Cumorah pageant, on the site where Smith said the golden plates were given to him, has been annually performed since 1937. Other LDS pageants are regularly performed in eight locations in the United States, including Nauvoo, Illinois; Independence, Missouri; Manti, Utah; and Oakland, California. Likewise, the LDS Church has regularly produced faith-promoting films with excellent production values for showing in Salt Lake City and at the visitors' centers of Mormon historic sites. Historical films include Legacy: A Mormon Journey (1990), The Testaments of One Fold and One Shepherd (2000), and Joseph Smith: Prophet of the Restoration (2005). As the Ostlings have written, Legacy is \\"an example of ritualized history, effectively idealized and simplified.\\" In discussing the Mormon pioneer heritage, \\"there is no hint of polygamy or millennial land claims or any other distinctive Mormon doctrine, just the idea that a prophet Joseph Smith came up with a new sacred book asking people to lead holy lives.\\"Ostling, 242. Smith dies as a martyr without mention of Mormon destruction of a Nauvoo newspaper, which triggered the crisis. Nevertheless, \\"the drama and scenery of the trek are so beautifully photographed\\" that many Mormons saw the movie repeatedly when visiting Temple Square. History and theology Mormon high school students are encouraged to take seminary, a four-year course of religious study. These one-year courses have annual focus on the following: the Old Testament; New Testament; Book of Mormon; and church history and the Doctrine and Covenants. The objective is to enable each student to be familiar with the scriptures and to assist them in applying gospel principles in their daily life. College age students between the ages of 18 and 30 are also encouraged to take religious classes known as \\"institute\\". At private church-sponsored universities and colleges, religion courses are required for graduation. Comparatively little of Mormon doctrinal teaching involves \\"what traditional Christian catechism would call 'pure theology.'\\"Ostling, 247. Mormon \\"history evolves as part of the church's canon,\\" and an LDS Correlation Committee attempts to ensure that \\"all church publications, from periodicals to curriculum materials, follow official policy and express official interpretations. This means that sensitive historical issues frequently are downplayed, avoided, or denied.\\" > Even the scriptures have been rewritten to fit current doctrine, in line > with the idea of continuity and progressive revelation.

Michael Quinn, later excommunicated from the LDS Church, noted that traditional \\"Mormon apologists discuss such 'sensitive evidence' only when this evidence is so well known that ignoring it is almost impossible.\\"D. Michael Quinn, ed., The New Mormon History: Revisionist Essays on the Past (Salt Lake City: Signature, 1992), xiii In an oft-quoted speech to church educators in 1981, apostle Boyd K. Packer warned them from the temptation \\"to tell everything, whether it is worthy or faith-promoting or not. ... In an effort to be objective, impartial, and scholarly, a writer or a teacher may unwittingly be giving equal time to the adversary. ... Do not spread disease germs!\\"Boyd K. Packer, Fifth Annual Church Educational System Religious Eucators' Symposium, August 22, 1981, Brigham Young University, Brigham Young University Studies, quoted in Susan Stansfield Wolverton, Having Visions: The Book of Mormon Translated and Exposed in Plain English (New York: Algora Publishing, 2004), 57. See also, Boyd K. Packer, Let Not Your Heart Be Troubled (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1991), 106. In addition, speaking on \\"scholars\\" and \\"intellectuals,\\" Packer also stated \\"The dangers I speak of come from the gay-lesbian movement, the feminist movement (both of which are relatively new), and the ever-present challenge from the so-called scholars or intellectuals.\\" Online reprint by John W. Redelfs at ZionsBest.com Packer went so far as to question the spirituality of some Mormon historians: \\"One who chooses to follow the tenets of his profession, regardless of how they may injure the church or destroy the faith of those not ready for 'advanced history' is himself in spiritual jeopardy.\\" In the same speech, Packer described how the things historians tell one another are not uplifting and \\"go far beyond the audience they may have intended, and destroy faith.\\" Packer has not been the only LDS Church leader critical of historians. Ezra Taft Benson, the church's 13th president, was also been outspoken concerning LDS historians. According to Benson > This humanistic emphasis on history is not confined only to secular history; > there have been and continue to be attempts made to bring this philosophy > into our own Church history. Again the emphasis is to underplay revelation > and God's intervention in significant events, and to inordinately humanize > the prophets of God so that their human frailties become more evident than > their spiritual qualities. Benson also warns historians against adding context and background information concerning revelations and LDS history. According to one historian citing Benson > Elder Benson gives as examples the discussion by historians of the American > temperance movement in the 1830s as part of the circumstances out of which > Joseph Smith obtained the revelation on the Word of Wisdom, and he referred > to historians who explained the revelation on the three degrees of glory in > terms of contemporary questions by American philosophers about the afterlife The result of this attitude of Mormonism toward history is that truth, \\"supposedly embedded in history,\\" becomes \\"dynamic and fluid.\\"Ostling, 249. Therefore, as Marxist historian Mark Leone has written, \\"the church has discouraged any intellectual tradition that would interfere with disguising historical factors or with maintaining much of the social reality through the uncritical way lay history is done.\\"Mark P. Leone, The Roots of Modern Modernism, (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1979), 204, 211. \\"Faithful history\\" A 21st-century representation, based on eye-witness accounts, of Joseph Smith translating the golden plates by examining stones in his hat.

Palmer, An Insider's View of Mormon Origins (Salt Lake City: Signature Books, 2002), 1-2. During the early years of the church, Mormons concentrated on telling providential history as they had been commanded to do by Joseph Smith.Ronald W. Walker, David J. Whittaker, and James B. Allen, Mormon History (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 2001), 5. Church clerks compiled a history of the Latter-day Saint movement, weaving the accounts of various people together \\"into a seamless narrative as though Smith himself were speaking.\\" Then between 1902 and 1912, Mormon apologist B. H. Roberts prepared the work for publication, including as part of the title the phrase \\"History of Joseph Smith the Prophet, by Himself.\\" \\"Even worse than causing confusion over Smith's lack of authorship, Roberts made corrections, deletions, and emendations to the six-volume work without explaining his reasons for doing so.\\"Mormon History, 8. In the twentieth century, the term \\"faithful history\\" became a synonym for official Mormon historical writing that was apologetic and celebratory and that downplayed or avoided \\"sensitive aspects of Mormon history.\\"Ostling, 251. The church has always tried to retain control over the telling of its history. When in 1853 Orson Pratt published the memoirs of Joseph Smith's mother, Lucy Mack Smith, Brigham Young \\"was unhappy with the book and ordered the printing destroyed.\\" Ostling, 250. \\"It is not, for example, politically correct to suggest that Mormons, while victims, were not always innocent victims, or that though holiness may be an affront to the observer, ordinary Saintly holiness was not usually the cause of Mormon persecution.\\" \\"If the scholar was Mormon and the church did not like the message, it attacked the messenger.\\"Ostlings, 251. New Mormon History Between the works of \\"faithful historians\\" and historical works created by disillusioned Mormons, such as Fawn Brodie's No Man Knows My History (1945), grew the New Mormon History, which emphasized \\"examining the Mormon past in the hope of understanding it\\" rather than attacking or defending the religion itself.Walker, et al., 61. The most noted of the early New Mormon Historians was Leonard J. Arrington, who earned his doctorate in economics but whose early work culminated in the publication of Great Basin Kingdom, An Economic History of the Latter-day Saints (Harvard University Press, 1958), which became \\"a watershed in the writing of the New Mormon History.\\" Arrington was important in the organization of the Mormon Historical Association in 1965 and became its first president. In 1972, Arrington was called to serve as the LDS Church Historian, although he was not a General Authority.Walker, et al., 65. But Arrington's attempt to publish New Mormon History through the Church Historian's office met stiff resistance from members of the Quorum of the Twelve,Walker, et al., 67, specifically Ezra Taft Benson, Mark E. Peterson, and Boyd K. Packer, who according to D. Michael Quinn \\"shared a suspicion of what was going on in the historical department and misgivings concerning Leonard's appointment.\\" Some of Arrington's subordinates were not allowed to publish through church organs or imprints, and they were eventually removed. Privately, Arrington wrote, \\"Our great experiment in church-sponsored history has proved to be, if not a failure, at least not an unqualified success.\\"Walker, et al., 68. In 1982, the First Presidency sent Arrington a personal letter releasing him from his call as church historian, and the release \\"was not publicly announced in General Conference.\\"Ostling, 257. The East Wing of the Church Office Building contains a gallery of portraits of all the church historians‚Äîexcept for Arrington.Ostling, 258. According to Quinn discussing Arrington as the LDS Church historian \\"Leonard became the fall guy ... and the apostles blamed him for everyone who was disturbed or upset or embarrassed about something that they read based upon research that was done since 1972.\\" Mormon studies became an increasingly hazardous pursuit for Mormon scholars, \\"especially if they were members of the Brigham Young University faculty.\\"Ostling, 251. As an end run around church policy, some Mormon families donated photocopies of their general-authority ancestors to other libraries, and researchers donated transcriptions and photocopies of their materials to also make them available to the general public. D. Michael Quinn, Early Mormonism and the Magic World View, Revised and Enlarged (Salt Lake City: Signature Books, 1998), 327. The Church restricted access to papers formerly available to non-Mormons and asked researchers to sign releases \\"giving the church permission to exercise pre- publication censorship.\\" The sensational Mark Hofmann murder and forgery case of 1985, could only have developed from the \\"curious mixture of paranoia and obsessiveness\\" with which both the LDS Church and individual Mormons approached the history of their faith.Ostling, 252. Tension between faith and scholarship=D. Michael Quinn Some LDS Church historians have lost their membership after publishing their work. The most well-known is former Brigham Young University (BYU) professor D. Michael Quinn, who was eventually excommunicated for insubordination. To become a BYU professor, Quinn had to meet with LDS Church apostle Boyd K. Packer, and according to Quinn, Packer told him at that meeting that he had \\"a hard time with historians, because historians idolize the truth.\\" Later Quinn's local bishop told him that on the authority of LDS Church apostles, he had been asked to withdraw Quinn's temple recommend until Quinn agreed to stop publishing material damaging to the LDS Church, which it viewed as \\"speaking ill of the Lord's anointed\\". According to Quinn, the bishop told him to \\"find some way to do history without these conflicts with the brethren.\\" Quinn said he replied that he would do his best but that he did not know how he \\"could do both at the same time.\\" Because BYU professors were required to have a temple recommend, the bishop put the recommend in his desk drawer and told Quinn if anyone asked him if he had a temple recommend, he could say yes. Quinn taught at BYU for a few more years but eventually decided to resign rather than be forced out. Quinn never again held an academic position and was eventually excommunicated from the church for insubordination because he refused to meet with LDS local leaders concerning \\"an accusation of apostasy based upon my publications.\\" Richard Bushman Richard Bushman, an academic historian who is also a believing Mormon, has written about the tension he feels in writing accurately while also supporting his faith. In his book, Rough Stone Rolling, Bushman does not conceal the more controversial aspects of Joseph Smith's character, but he does try to ameliorate their impact on believing readers while still maintaining historical objectivity. In his essay \\"The Balancing Act: A Mormon historian reflects on his biography of Joseph Smith,\\" Bushman noted that one reviewer had written of his \\"walking a high wire between the demands of church conformity and the necessary openness of scholarly investigation.\\"Richard L. Bushman, \\"The Balancing Act: A Mormon historian reflects on his biography of Joseph Smith\\" In response, Bushman argued that one did not have to be objective to write history. > Passion and belief are certainly not requirements for historical inquiry, > but neither are they crippling handicaps. Once we relinquish, as we must, > the \\"noble dream\\" of objective history, personal commitment becomes a > valuable resource ... Contrary to the idea that belief closes the mind, our > passions open our eyes and ears. Stifling my belief in Joseph Smith would > extinguish one of my greatest assets. Bushman said that he could not give way to writing a hagiography because > I also knew that if I overly idealized Smith, I would lose credibility with > non-Mormons. With a broad readership in mind, I could not conceal his flaws. > Moreover, I tried to voice unbelieving readers' likely reactions when Smith > married additional wives or taught doctrines foreign to modern > sensibilities. When he went beyond the pale, I acknowledged readers' dismay. In a short but revealing book published after his book tour for Rough Stone Rolling, Bushman concluded that he had \\"the educated Mormons\\" with him but that although he had the respect of most non-Mormon scholars, he did not have \\"their acquiescence. I have not given them a Joseph they can believe in.\\"Richard Bushman, On the Road with Joseph Smith: An Author's Diary (Salt Lake City: Greg Kofford Books, 2007), 122. Grant Palmer Initially Grant Palmer was hired to teach history at the Church College of New Zealand. Shortly later he began teaching religion, which led to a 34-year career in the Church Educational System (CES). He was director of the LDS Institute of Religion in Whittier, California (1970‚Äì73) followed by Chico, California (1975‚Äì80). Returning to Utah, he then taught LDS seminary at East High School in 1980 and at Brighton High School from 1980 to 1988.Palmer, Grant H. \\"My Years in the Church Education System, 1967-2001\\". Signature Books. Retrieved 2012-02-26. During this time the infamous Salamander letter surfaced, which challenged the orthodox story of Mormon beginnings, though the letter was eventually found to be a forgery. As an ardent student of LDS history, the letter caused Palmer to consider the influences of American folk magic on Joseph Smith's religious practices. In 1985, Palmer's research on this issue led him to write and circulate a manuscript called \\"New York Mormonism\\" under the pseudonym \\"Paul Pry, Jr.\\" which became the first draft of An Insider's View of Mormon Origins. As he grew uneasy with some aspects of LDS history, Palmer approached his CES supervisor about changing positions to teach adults at the Salt Lake County Jail. Teaching more general Christian and Biblical lessons of faith and ethics to all inmates, he was the jail's chaplain and director of its Institute program from 1988 until his 2001 retirement. He also served on the board of directors of the Salt Lake Legal Defenders Association. After completing his long-coming manuscript, he published the controversial book An Insider's View of Mormon Origins with Signature Books in 2002, in which Palmer challenged the orthodox teachings of Mormonism's beginnings. Palmer's prison teaching led him to write another book, The Incomparable Jesus, published by Greg Kofford Books in 2005. In 2003 An Insider's View was criticized by BYU's Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies (FARMS) in reviews written by Daniel C. Peterson, Davis Bitton, Steven C. Harper, Mark Ashurst-McGee, and Louis Midgley. These were published in the FARMS Review alongside an official statement from BYU's Joseph Fielding Smith Institute for Latter-day Saint History disagreeing with Palmer's conclusions. In the following Review issue, historian James B. Allen published another critical review. Palmer asserts that he was disfellowshipped from the LDS Church in December 2004 as a result of An Insider's View of Mormon Origins. (Being disfellowshipped results in probational loss of some church privileges without being forced to leave the church). Palmer concluded that while he liked many of the teachings of Joseph Smith, \\"the foundational events in church history are too problematic to ignore\\". He found that much of what Latter-day Saints take for granted as literal history has, over the years, been modified to emphasize certain aspects over others. This, he believes, has resulted in an inaccurate picture of LDS Church history. Palmer argues also that the Mormon Jesus is very different from the current Christian Jesus due to the modern practices of the LDS Church such as forced tithing, avoidance of wine drinking, and use of special clothing. In 2008, Palmer wrote an article in The Salt Lake Tribune comparing the Mormon and Catholic Churches to the Pharisees, whose observance of strict laws and oral traditions was decried by Jesus. Palmer believed that, instead, a true belief in Christian religion is centered in individually becoming good and loving people.Palmer, Grant (March 1, 2008). \\"Jesus stressed kind behavior, not rituals, to get to heaven\\". The Salt Lake Tribune. Retrieved 2012-02-26. Palmer stated in a Mormon Stories interview in 2012 that due to the publication of a two and half page article in 2010, \\"Religious feeling and truth\\", for an obscure Baptist journal in Kansas City, a second disciplinary council was scheduled but Palmer handed in his resignation before the hearing was held. Several reasons led to his decision; mainly, that the first disciplinary council lasted an exhausting seven hours and he did not want to repeat that experience and also that the presiding authority of the second council let him know beforehand that to stay a member and avoid excommunication he would need to repudiate all of the details from his book and also regain his testimony of the church.

Daniel Itzig (also known as Daniel Yoffe 18 March 1723 in Berlin ‚Äì 17 May 1799 in Potsdam) was a Court Jew of Kings Frederick II the Great and Frederick William II of Prussia. Biography Medal posted for Daniel Itzig's 70th birthday in 1793 Itzig was born in Berlin. His family was mercantile. Itzig was a banker and a mintmaster in partnership with Veitel-Heine Ephraim. Together they leased all the mints in Saxony and Prussia. During the Seven Years' War they assisted Frederick the Great in debasing the Saxonian currencyConway (2012) 145. and spreading the Ephraimiten, not only in Saxony, but also in Silesia, Poland, Bohemia and Courland. Itzig was one of the very few Jews in Prussia to receive full citizenship privileges, as a \\"Useful Jew\\". He became extraordinarily wealthy as a consequence. Book by Romineli commemorating Itzig in Berlin Together with his son in law David Friedlander, Itzig was appointed to lead a committee which was to discuss ways to improve the Jewish civil and social standing in Prussia, which led to the removal of many restrictions. He funded early members of the Haskalah secular movement, including Rabbi Israel of Zamosch (Moses Mendelssohn's teacher), Samuel Rominow (an Italian Jewish artist) and Isaac Satanow.Masa BaArav, (Hebrew), Samuel Romanelli, Berlin 1781 In 1761 he began planning a school for poor Jewish boys in Berlin, and in 1778 his son together with Daniel Friedlander opened the first \\"free school\\" (Freischule) called \\"Hinuch Neorim\\", Hebrew: 'Teaching the Youth'. The school and adjacent printing house later became one of the main institutions of the Haskalah movement. At the same time he founded and funded a Yeshiva and brought Rabbi Hirschel Levin and Rabbi Joseph ben Meir Teomim to Berlin to teach there. Itzig was the official head ('Ober√§ltester') of the Jewish community in Berlin from 1764 until his death in 1799.Conway (2012) 145. He was made the Prussian court banker by Frederick's successor, Frederick William II of Prussia in 1797. Legacy His wife Miriam Wulff's ancestors included Rabbi Moses Isserles of Cracow and Joseph ben Mordechai Gershon.Daniel Itzig in the Jewish Encyclopedia (1901‚Äì1904) Many of Itzig's thirteen children (see Itzig family) became influential in German Jewish society. Two of his granddaughters married two of Moses Mendelssohn's sons. One of them was Lea (n√©e Solomon), mother of Felix Mendelssohn and Fanny Hensel, a pianist and composer.

It functions similar to a recirculating wind tunnel, but uses water as the working fluid, and related phenomena are investigated, such as measuring the forces on scale models of submarines or lift and drag on hydrofoils. Water tunnels are sometimes used in place of wind tunnels to perform measurements because techniques like particle image velocimetry (PIV) are easier to implement in water. For many cases as long as the Reynolds number is equivalent, the results are valid, whether a submerged water vehicle model is tested in air or an aerial vehicle is tested in water. For low Reynolds number flows, tunnels can be made to run oil instead of water. The advantage is that the increased viscosity will allow the flow to be a faster speed (and thus easier to maintain in a stable manner) for a lower Reynolds number. Whereas in wind tunnels the driving force is usually sophisticated multiblade propellers with adjustable blade pitch, in water and oil tunnels the fluid is circulated with pumps, effectively using a net pressure head difference to move the fluid rather than imparting momentum on it directly. Thus the return section of water and oil tunnels does not need any flow management; typically it is just a pipe sized for the pump and desired flow speeds. The upstream section of a water tunnels generally consists of a pipe (outlet from the pump) with several holes along its side and with the end open followed by a series of coarse and fine screens to even the flow before the contraction into the test section. Wind tunnels may also have screens before the contraction, but in water tunnels they may be as fine as the screen used in window openings and screen doors. Additionally, many water tunnels are sealed and can reduce or increase the internal static pressure, to perform cavitation studies. These are referred to as cavitation tunnels. Cavitating propeller model in 'David Taylor Model Basin' Methods Because it is a high-speed phenomenon, a special procedure is needed to visualize cavitation. The propeller, attached to a dynamometer, is placed in the inflow, and its thrust and torque is measured at different ratios of propeller speed (number of revolutions) to inflow velocity. A stroboscope synchronized with the propeller speed \\"freezes\\" the cavitation bubble. By this means, it is possible to determine if the propeller would be damaged by cavitation. To ensure similarity to the full-scale propeller, the pressure is lowered, and the gas content of the water is controlled. Often, a tunnel will be co-located with other experimental facilities such as a wave flume at a Ship model basin.

He founded the Liberty and Property Defence League. Early life He was the eldest son and heir of Francis Wemyss-Charteris, 9th Earl of Wemyss and Lady Louisa Bingham. Among his siblings was younger brother Hon. Richard Charteris (who married Lady Margaret Butler, a daughter of Richard Butler, 2nd Earl of Glengall) and sister Lady Louisa Wemyss-Charteris (wife of William Wells, MP for Beverley and Peterborough). His paternal grandparents were Francis Douglas, 8th Earl of Wemyss and the former Margaret Campbell (daughter of Scottish landowner Walter Campbell, 3rd of Shawfield and Islay and 9th of Skipness). His maternal grandparents were Richard Bingham, 2nd Earl of Lucan and Lady Elizabeth Belasyse, third daughter of Henry Belasyse, 2nd Earl Fauconberg and former wife of Bernard Howard, 12th Duke of Norfolk. He was educated at Eton and graduated from Christ Church, Oxford with a B.A. degree. Career As Lord Elcho he was commanding officer of the London Scottish Rifles Volunteers regiment for 17 years from its formation in 1859, gaining the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel. Charteris was a member of the Canterbury Association from 27 March 1848, and belonged to the management committee. He developed an interest in the alternative medical practice of Homeopathy, even becoming President of the London Homeopathic Hospital until his death. The strength of his belief is evidenced by his writing in March 1914: > I wish all success to Homoeopathy, to which I attach my physical well-being > in great measure. When I was 90 I was asked to what I attributed my well- > being at that late period of life. My answer was, \\"To parentage and > moderation\\".

Overview The concept was introduced in 1988 by Constantino Tsallis as a basis for generalizing the standard statistical mechanics and is identical in form to Havrda‚ÄìCharv√°t structural Œ±-entropy, introduced in 1967 within information theory. In scientific literature, the physical relevance of the Tsallis entropy has been debated. However, from the years 2000 on, an increasingly wide spectrum of natural, artificial and social complex systems have been identified which confirm the predictions and consequences that are derived from this nonadditive entropy, such as nonextensive statistical mechanics, which generalizes the Boltzmann‚ÄìGibbs theory. Among the various experimental verifications and applications presently available in the literature, the following ones deserve a special mention: # The distribution characterizing the motion of cold atoms in dissipative optical lattices predicted in 2003 and observed in 2006. # The fluctuations of the magnetic field in the solar wind enabled the calculation of the q-triplet (or Tsallis triplet). # The velocity distributions in a driven dissipative dusty plasma. # Spin glass relaxation. # Trapped ion interacting with a classical buffer gas. # High energy collisional experiments at LHC/CERN (CMS, ATLAS and ALICE detectors) and RHIC/Brookhaven (STAR and PHENIX detectors). Among the various available theoretical results which clarify the physical conditions under which Tsallis entropy and associated statistics apply, the following ones can be selected: # Anomalous diffusion. # Uniqueness theorem. # Sensitivity to initial conditions and entropy production at the edge of chaos. # Probability sets that make the nonadditive Tsallis entropy to be extensive in the thermodynamical sense. # Strongly quantum entangled systems and thermodynamics. # Thermostatistics of overdamped motion of interacting particles. # Nonlinear generalizations of the Schroedinger, Klein‚ÄìGordon and Dirac equations. # Blackhole entropy calculation. For further details a bibliography is available at http://tsallis.cat.cbpf.br/biblio.htm Given a discrete set of probabilities {p_i} with the condition \\\\sum_i p_i=1, and q any real number, the Tsallis entropy is defined as :S_q({p_i}) = {k \\\\over q - 1} \\\\left( 1 - \\\\sum_i p_i^q \\\\right), where q is a real parameter sometimes called entropic-index. In the limit as q \\\\to 1, the usual Boltzmann‚ÄìGibbs entropy is recovered, namely :S_{BG} = S_1(p) = -k \\\\sum_i p_i \\\\ln p_i . For continuous probability distributions, we define the entropy as :S_q[p] = {1 \\\\over q - 1} \\\\left( 1 - \\\\int (p(x))^q\\\\, dx \\\\right), where p(x) is a probability density function. The Tsallis Entropy has been used along with the Principle of maximum entropy to derive the Tsallis distribution.  Various relationships  The discrete Tsallis entropy satisfies :S_q = -\\\\lim_{x\\\\rightarrow 1}D_q \\\\sum_i p_i^x where Dq is the q-derivative with respect to x. This may be compared to the standard entropy formula: :S = -\\\\lim_{x\\\\rightarrow 1}\\\\frac{d}{dx} \\\\sum_i p_i^x  Non-additivity  Given two independent systems A and B, for which the joint probability density satisfies :p(A, B) = p(A) p(B),\\\\, the Tsallis entropy of this system satisfies :S_q(A,B) = S_q(A) + S_q(B) + (1-q)S_q(A) S_q(B).\\\\, From this result, it is evident that the parameter 1-q is a measure of the departure from additivity. In the limit when q = 1, :S(A,B) = S(A) + S(B),\\\\, which is what is expected for an additive system. This property is sometimes referred to as \\"pseudo-additivity\\".  Exponential families  Many common distributions like the normal distribution belongs to the statistical exponential families. Tsallis entropy for an exponential family can be written as :H^T_q(p_F(x;\\\\theta)) = \\\\frac{1}{1-q} \\\\left((e^{F(q\\\\theta)-q F(\\\\theta)}) E_p[e^{(q-1)k(x)}]-1 \\\\right) where F is log-normalizer and k the term indicating the carrier measure. For multivariate normal, term k is zero, and therefore the Tsallis entropy is in closed-form.  Generalized entropies  Several interesting physical systems abide by entropic functionals that are more general than the standard Tsallis entropy. Therefore, several physically meaningful generalizations have been introduced. The two most generals of those are notably: Superstatistics, introduced by C. Beck and E. G. D. Cohen in 2003 and Spectral Statistics, introduced by G. A. Tsekouras and Constantino Tsallis in 2005. Both these entropic forms have Tsallis and Boltzmann‚ÄìGibbs statistics as special cases; Spectral Statistics has been proven to at least contain Superstatistics and it has been conjectured to also cover some additional cases.

When asked about his time in Japan, Gullickson said it was strange; the only English words that he saw were \\"Sony and Mitsubishi.\\" Overcomes diabetes to excel Although only in Japan for a short time, Gullickson left behind a positive legacy. When he was in Japan, it was considered a miracle that Gullickson, a patient with type 1 diabetes mellitus, played a professional sport. Since 1998, the Japan Diabetes Mellitus Society (JADMC) has awarded the \\"Gullickson Award\\" for the patient who is deemed a superior influence on society. While in Japan, Gullickson also developed a close friendship with a young Japanese pitcher, Masumi Kuwata, and even named his son \\"Craig Kuwata Gullickson\\" in his honor. Kuwata learned many things from Gullickson and grew to be one of the best players in Japan. Meanwhile, Kuwata had always wished to play in MLB, and at last, this dream was realized in 2007, as he became a member of the Pittsburgh Pirates. Nearly 20 years after meeting Gullickson, Kuwata became an MLB rookie, at the age of 39. At the age of 12, Sam Fuld, an aspiring baseball player who also had diabetes, met Gullickson, and talked to him for two minutes. \\"That was enough to inspire me\\", Fuld said. \\"Any time I can talk to young diabetic kids, I look forward to that opportunity\\", said Gullickson. Chicago Sun-Times. Fuld went on to play eight seasons in the Major Leagues. Back to MLB (1990‚Äì1994) Gullickson signed as a free agent with the Houston Astros after the 1989 season, and had a mediocre 1990 season before being released. He then signed a multimillion-dollar contract with the Detroit Tigers, with whom he pitched for four seasons. While with the Tigers he met a young boy, who was then 12, who also had diabetes, and talked to him for two minutes. It was future major leaguer Sam Fuld, who battled to make the Cubs' 2008 team. \\"That was enough to inspire me\\", Fuld said. \\"Any time I can talk to young diabetic kids, I look forward to that opportunity.\\" In Gullickson led the American League in wins, with 20, his career high, but in was forced to retire due to injuries, at age 35.

The current firm was formed as the result of the 2001 merger of two predecessors: the Chicago-based Sidley & Austin, founded in 1866, and the New York‚Äìbased Brown & Wood, founded in 1914. The firm's headquarters is at One South Dearborn in Chicago's Loop. History=Origins in Chicago The firm that was to become Sidley Austin was formed in Chicago in 1866 by Norman Williams and John Leverett Thompson as the partnership of Williams & Thompson. Among the firm's first clients were the Pullman Company, the manufacturer of specialty sleeping railway cars, and former first lady Mary Todd Lincoln, then the widow of President Abraham Lincoln. Other early clients included Western Union Telegraph Company, which moved its Midwest headquarters from Cleveland to Chicago in 1869. After the Great Chicago Fire of 1871, the firm represented numerous insurance companies including Equitable Life Assurance Society. In 1892, William Pratt Sidley joined the firm after having earned an LLB from Union College of Law and a M.A. from Harvard Law School. By 1913, the firm's name was changed to Holt, Cutting & Sidley, although Sidley would be the guiding personality for the Chicago firm through the 20th century. Three years later‚Äîthe firm then fifty years old‚Äîhad four partners, four clerks (associates), and ten staff employees with gross income of around $100,000 (roughly $1.9 million in 2008 dollars). Buffeted by the Great Depression, the firm experienced a dramatic fall in revenues until the New Deal in the 1930s reinvigorated the capital markets. The firm represented Halsey, Stuart & Co., a Chicago-based underwriter in one of the first transactions under the Securities Act of 1933. In 1944, the name was changed to Sidley, Austin, Burgess & Harper and shortened to Sidley & Austin in 1967. Towards a national firm After the Second World War, Sidley & Austin began expanding beyond its Chicago roots as many of its clients entered new markets. In 1963, its Washington, D.C. branch was established which would soon become an important player in that city's legal market through its representation of the American Medical Association, American Bar Association and the International Minerals & Chemical Corporation. The firm developed strengths in antitrust and the representation of clients in front of the Federal Trade Commission. Sidley & Austin was among several law firms caught up in the Savings & Loan Crisis and paid $7.5 million to settle legal malpractice claims stemming from its representation of the Lincoln Savings and Loan Association. Such legal work was profiled in the book by Ralph Nader and Wesley J. Smith, No Contest: Corporate Lawyers and the Perversion of Justice in America. Expansion and consolidation Sidley & Austin expanded significantly in the 1970s and 1980s. In 1972, the firm merged with the 50 lawyers of Chicago firm Leibman, Williams, Bennett, Baird & Minow. Additional offices were then established in London, Los Angeles, Singapore and New York. In 2001, the firm merged with Brown & Wood, a New York-based law firm established in 1914 with 400 attorneys and additional domestic offices in Washington, D.C., San Francisco and Los Angeles and overseas branches in London, Beijing and Hong Kong (where it practiced English law in addition to U.S. law). Brown & Wood was known for its securities, structured finance and securitization practices. The firm's well-regarded publication, Accessing the U.S. Capital Markets: An Introduction to United States Securities Law, continues to be updated annually today. Brown & Wood had offices in the World Trade Center. The firm was known as Sidley Austin Brown & Wood until the name was rebranded as Sidley Austin in 2006. Appellate Practice Group In 1985, U.S. Solicitor General Rex E. Lee founded Sidley Austin's Appellate Practice Group to represent clients in all appellate courts, including the United States Supreme Court, the federal courts of appeals, and state appellate and supreme courts. Following Lee's death, the group was led by Carter Phillips, who has argued more cases before the Supreme Court than any lawyer in private practice and who now chairs the firm's executive committee. The current co-chairs of the practice group are former Acting Attorney General Peter Keisler and former Principal Deputy Associate Attorney General Joseph Guerra. The Appellate Group has argued several landmark cases before the Supreme Court including U.S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton (constitutionality of state-imposed term limits on members of Congress), Missouri v. Jenkins (proper role of federal courts in imposing desegregation remedies), and United States v. Lopez (Commerce Clause challenge to a federal statute prohibiting the possession of firearms within 1,000 feet of a school).

The flag is symbolic of the islanders' position that a great debt is still owed by the United States to the people of Bikini because in 1954 the United States government detonated the Castle Bravo hydrogen bomb on the island, poisoning islanders and others with nuclear fallout.  Design  Flag of Bikini Atoll The 23 white stars in the canton of the flag represent the 23 islands of Bikini Atoll. The three black stars in the upper right represent the three islands that were disfigured in March 1954 during the 15-megaton Bravo test by the United States. The two black stars in the lower right corner represent where the Bikinians live now, Kili Island, 425 miles to the south of Bikini Atoll, and Ejit Island of Majuro Atoll. These two stars are symbolically far away from Bikini's stars on the flag as the islands are in real life (both in distance and quality of life). The Marshallese language words on the flag, , reportedly represent the reply of the Bikinian leader Juda to U.S. Commodore Ben Wyatt in 1946 when the American went to Bikini to ask the islanders to give up their islands for the good of all humankind for nuclear weapons testing. They translate as \\"Everything is in the hands of God.\\"  Symbolism  The similarity to the American flag design and the striking isolation of the 3-star group and the 2-star group represent the position of the islanders that the Government of the United States still has obligations to their people, including reparations for the nuclear testing and resettlement of the Bikinians who were exiled.

The circulation area covers most of Douglas County including Canyonville, Glide, Myrtle Creek, Oakland, Roseburg, Sutherlin, and Winston.  History = Origins  The Roseburg Ensign was the original predecessor of The News-Review. It was founded Thomas and Henry R. Gale, two brothers from Eugene, on April 30, 1867. The first issue of the four-page weekly came out on May 28 for the price of $3. In September 1871 their newspaper plant was destroyed in a fire and would resume publication on January 6 the next year.  The Plaindealer  The Republican Gales were bitter rivals of southern Democrat William ‚ÄúBud‚Äù Thompson, the publisher and owner of The Plaindealer. Thompson's paper was founded in March 1870 after he had sold his Eugene City Guard in Eugene for $1,200. That same year Democrat La Fayette Grover was elected Governor of Oregon, ending an eight-year run of Republican governors. The new government favored The Plaindealer with lucrative public-notices. This escalated tensions between the two papers.  Roseburg Newspaper Shootout  The inciting incident occurred when one Saturday Thompson ran into Thomas Gale at the post office. Reports on what happened vary. Thompson writes in his memoir that Thomas Gale tried to draw a pistol, but Thompson grabbed his hand and slapped him in the face. However, newspaper accounts report Thompson spat in Gale's face and slapped him. Bystanders quickly separated the two before a full-on brawl could develop and Thomas Gale stormed off. Two days later as Thompson was stepping out of his office, he was confronted by the Gale brothers in downtown Roseburg on June 11, 1871. Newspapers report the encounter started with Thompson apologizing to Thomas for spitting in his face, which was not accepted. Reports conflict on what happened next. Thompson writes of the event in his memoir, writing: > ‚Äú... Success was not attained without gaining the enmity and bitter hatred > of my would-be rivals in business. Theirs was an old established paper > conducted by two brothers, Henry and Thomas Gale. . . They sought to regain > (business) by indulging in abuse of the coarsest character. . . June 11, > 1871, I went to my office. ...to write my letters...on leaving the office I > was joined by a young friend, Mr Virgil Conn. As we proceeded down the > street towards the post office I saw the brothers standing talking on the > street. . . I saw at once it was to be a fight. . .‚Äù It is unknown who fired the first shot. All three were wounded in the shoot- out, but none killed. Thompson, age 23 at the time, was wounded in the neck and with a bullet lodging in the back of his eye. Henry Gale was seriously wounded. Having never fully recovered from the incident, he would die in 1889. Thompson sold his paper in February 1872 to L. F. Mosher and would go on publish the Salem Mercury. Mosher sold the Plaindealer in 1873 to William H. Byars, who quickly converted it from Democratic to Republican and published it for about 10 years. (Byars was elected State Printer in 1883, about the time he bought 50% of the Oregon Statesman, which he co-owned for about 18 months; in 1888, Byars bought Salem's Capital Journal newspaper.)  New name and ownership change  The Ensign was sold to R. Tyson and renamed to The Pantagraph in 1872. In April 1875, the paper was renamed to the Douglas Independent under the ownership of John W. Kelley. In 1885 the paper was sold again to former Confederate soldier Rev. John Richard Newton Bell. He renamed the paper to the Roseburg Review and converted it from a weekly to a daily newspaper on May 9, 1888. Bell was a Democrat and used the paper to express his political opinions.  Merger  The Plaindealer became the Umpqua Valley News in 1905 and merged with the Roseburg Review in 1920 to form The News-Review. Also published on the Chronicling America web site (Library of Congress)Frank Jenkins bought the paper in 1930 and sold it to Scripps League Newspapers in 1960. Phil Swift of Swift Communications acquired The News- Review after the Scripps League broke up in 1975. It was at this time the paper added a Sunday edition, bringing the paper to a 6 day-a-week publication.  Lotus Media  In September 2015, the paper was purchased from Swift by Patrick Markham and his company, Lotus Media Group. Markham is the president of Brooke Communications, owner of five Roseburg radio stations.

In particular, Egypt possessed large stockpiles of 8mm Mauser ammunition that had been manufactured by a number of countries (Germany, Turkey, Greece, etc.) Egypt decided to manufacture a semi-automatic main battle rifle, and so purchased the tooling and plans for the Swedish Ag m/42 rifle. They reengineered this rifle to use the 8mm Mauser cartridge and added a gas adjustment valve. This rifle was called the Hakim, and Egypt manufactured and fielded it from the early 1950s until about 1961. They also briefly manufactured another reengineered Ag m/42, this time chambered for the 7.62√ó39mm Soviet cartridge, called the Rasheed. These guns were replaced in the 1960s by the Maadi AK-47 a licensed copy of the widely distributed Soviet automatic assault rifle. During the late 1950s Egypt built the Jabal Hamzah ballistic missile test and launch facility to test-fire and experiment indigenously built Al Zafir and Al Kahir SRBMs. Egypt was involved in supplying the CIA with various weapons for Operation Cyclone and the Soviet Afghan war. Officer Gust Avrakotos managed to set up a deal with Abd al-Halim Abu Ghazala for Egypt to manufacture .303 ammunition for the hundreds of thousands of Lee‚ÄìEnfield rifles the CIA had supplied to the Mujahideen through Pakistan's ISI. Congressman Charlie Wilson (close with Avrakotos) helped grease the political wheels for the deals to go through.Charlie Wilson's War, George Crile, 2003, Grove/Atlantic. Agencies The Arab Organization for Industrialization supervises nine military factories which are producing civilian goods as well as military products. Initially the owners of AOI were Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, before both countries gave back to Egypt their shares in 1993, valued at $1.8 billion. AOI now is entirely owned by the government of Egypt. AOI has about 19,000 employees out of which are 1250 engineers. AOI fully owns 6 factories and shares in 3 joint ventures, beside the Arab Institute for Advanced Technology.

Established in 1916, it was one of four combat squadrons of the Australian Flying Corps during World War I, and operated on the Western Front in France before being disbanded in 1919. It was re-raised as a permanent squadron of the RAAF in 1925, and during World War II operated in the Mediterranean Theatre. The Cold War years saw the squadron disbanded and re-raised twice. It was based at RAAF Butterworth during the Malayan Emergency and the Indonesia‚ÄìMalaysia Konfrontasi. Equipped with McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet multi-role fighters from 1986, the squadron deployed to Diego Garcia in 2002 to provide local air defence, and the following year contributed aircraft and crews to the invasion of Iraq as part of Operation Falconer. In April 2016, it deployed to the Middle East as part of the military intervention against ISIL. History=World War I No. 3 Squadron was formed at Point Cook, Victoria, on 19 September 1916 under the command of Major David Blake.Eather, Flying Squadrons of the Australian Defence Force, p. 11 It was one of four operational squadrons of the Australian Flying Corps, and its personnel were members of the Australian Army. Shortly afterwards, the unit embarked upon the HMAT Ulysses and sailed to England for training, before becoming the first AFC squadron deployed to France, in September 1917, equipped with the R.E.8 two- seat reconnaissance/general purpose aircraft. To avoid confusion with the British No. 3 Squadron RFC, it was known to the British military as \\"No. 69 Squadron RFC\\".Halley, The Squadrons of the Royal Air Force & Commonwealth, p. 135 This terminology was never accepted by the squadron or the Australian Imperial Force who continued to use the AFC designation regardless,O'Connor, Airfields and Airmen of the Channel Coast , p. 173 and in early 1918, the British designation was dropped. R.E.8s of No 3 Sqn AFC After moving to the Western Front, the squadron was initially based at Savy. In November 1917, it was assigned the role of a corps reconnaissance squadron and allocated to I Anzac Corps, which was based around Messines, and established itself at Bailleul. No. 3 Squadron would remain with I Anzac for the remainder of the war, and participated in bombing, artillery spotting and reconnaissance missions supporting ANZAC and other British Empire ground forces. Its first air-to-air victory came on 6 December 1917; by the end of the war its aircrews had been credited with another 15 German aircraft, and a total of 10,000 operational hours.Stephens, Royal Australian Air Force, pp. 9‚Äì19 In early 1918, the collapse of Russia allowed the Germans to concentrate their strength on the Western Front, and launched a major offensive.Baldwin, World War I: An Outline History, p. 127 & 141 As the Allies were pushed back, the squadron's airfield at Baileul came into range of the German guns and it was moved first to Abeele and then, as the Allies were pushed back further, it moved again to Poulainville. During the offensive, the squadron operated mainly in the Somme Valley, providing artillery observation. In April 1918, the squadron became responsible for the remains of the \\"Red Baron\\", Manfred von Richthofen, after he was shot down in its sector.Eather, Flying Squadrons of the Australian Defence Force, p. 12 Blake initially believed that one of the squadron's R.E.8s may have been responsible but later endorsed the theory that an Australian anti-aircraft machine gunner actually shot down the Red Baron.McGuire, The Many Deaths of the Red Baron, p. 82 In July, the squadron undertook reconnaissance and deception operations in support of the Australian attack at Hamel,Nunan, Diggers' Fourth of July, pp. 31‚Äì32 before later joining the final Allied offensive of the war around Amiens in August, flying support operations until the armistice in November. Shortly before the end of the war, the squadron began converting to the Bristol F.2 Fighter. Following the end of hostilities, the squadron was engaged briefly in mail transport duties before being withdrawn to the United Kingdom in early 1919. It was disbanded in February and over the course of the next couple of months its personnel were repatriated back to Australia. Casualties amounted to 32 killed and 23 wounded, of which the majority were aircrew; the squadron lost 11 aircraft during the war.Barnes, The RAAF and the Flying Squadrons, p. 20 1925 ‚Äì 1939 In 1925, the squadron was re-formed as part of the fledgling independent Royal Australian Air Force. Under the command of Squadron Leader Frank Lukis, it was based initially at Point Cook and then at Richmond, operating a variety of aircraft including S.E.5As, DH.9s, Westland Wapitis and Hawker Demons. World War II No. 3 Squadron ground crew in front of a P-40 in 1942. At the outbreak of World War II, the squadron was one of 12 permanent RAAF squadrons. It was initially given an army co-operation role, and was deployed to the Middle East in mid-1940, to support the 6th Division of the Australian Army. The squadron was to spend the entire war in the Mediterranean theatre, and became part of the Allies' Desert Air Force (later the First Tactical Air Force), supporting the 8th Army.Eather, Flying Squadrons of the Australian Defence Force, p. 25. Commanded by Squadron Leader Ian McLachlan, the squadron's personnel travelled by sea to Egypt, where it was to be provided with aircraft from RAF stocks. Initially, it used two obsolete biplane types, the Gloster Gauntlet and Gloster Gladiator, for close air support, along with the Westland Lysander, for reconnaissance sorties, against Italian forces in Egypt and Libya. In the course of these operations, the squadron clashed with aircraft from the Regia Aeronautica. It then, briefly, operated the Hawker Hurricane instead, before converting to the Curtiss P-40B/C Tomahawk in 1941. It saw action against Vichy French aircraft during the Syria‚ÄìLebanon campaign. With the Tomahawk and its successor, the Kittyhawk (P-40D ‚Äì P-40N), the squadron returned to the North African campaign, during which it often engaged in intense air battles with state of the art fighters operated by the Reggia Aeronautica (such as the Macchi C.202) and German Luftwaffe (Messerschmitt Bf 109E/F), during 1941‚Äì1943.Eather, Flying Squadrons of the Australian Defence Force, pp. 25‚Äì26 There is evidence that 3 Sqn was the DAF Kittyhawk squadron that attacked German ground forces at Mezzouna, Tunisia, on 3 April 1943 and caused, in the process, severe injuries to Claus Von Stauffenberg (who would, the following year, attempt to assassinate Adolf Hitler, as part of a failed coup against the Nazi regime).3 Sqn veteran Tom Russell states that: \\"operational records and pilot diaries\\" indicate that the other DAF P-40 squadrons were \\"operating away from Mezzouna\\" at the time.

CAC CA-18 Mustang warbird painted to represent a North American P-51 Mustang of No. 3 Squadron used in Italy during World War II No. 3 Squadron's longest-serving commanding officer (CO) during the war was Squadron Leader Bobby Gibbes, whose tour lasted from February 1942 to April 1943. Gibbes was replaced by Squadron Leader Brian Eaton, who led the unit until February 1944. During this period, No. 3 Squadron took part in the Allied invasions of Sicily and Italy. It re-equipped with P-51 Mustangs in November 1944 and continued to operate in Italy and Yugoslavia until the end of the European war in May 1945. No. 3 Squadron's record of 25,663 operational flight hours and 217.5 enemy aircraft destroyed made it the highest-scoring RAAF fighter squadron.Barnes, The RAAF and the Flying Squadrons, p. 23 Cold War At the end of the war, No. 3 Squadron returned to Australia and disbanded at Point Cook on 30 July 1946. It was re-formed at RAAF Base Fairbairn in Canberra in early 1948 when No. 4 Squadron RAAF was renumbered as No. 3 Squadron. Equipped with Mustangs, CAC Wirraways and Austers, the squadron served briefly as a tactical reconnaissance and close support squadron before disbanding again in 1953.Eather, Flying Squadrons of the Australian Defence Force, pp. 27 & 29 The squadron re-formed on 1 March 1956 at RAAF Base Williamtown, New South Wales. It operated CA-27 Sabres out of Butterworth, Malaya, from 1958 engaging in warlike operations associated with the Malayan Emergency and Konfrontasi. As Australian involvement in the Vietnam War intensified, No. 3 Squadron returned to Australia and re-equipped with Mirage IIIO fighters at Williamtown in 1967.Eather, Flying Squadrons of the Australian Defence Force, p. 27 The CO, Wing Commander Vance Drummond, was killed during air combat manoeuvres at No. 2 Operational Conversion Unit in May. He was succeeded by Wing Commander Jake Newham (later Chief of the Air Staff).Barnes, The RAAF and the Flying Squadrons, p. 24 After training in air- to-air and air-to-ground roles, the squadron deployed to RAAF Butterworth in Malaysia in February 1969, detachments were also deployed to RAF Tengah and Paya Lebar Air Base. During this period, the aircraft became known as \\"lizards\\", in reference to their camouflage paint scheme and low altitude operations. The frill neck lizard was adopted as an informal squadron insignia. After 15 years deployed to Malaysia, No. 3 Squadron returned to Australia, and after transferring aircraft and personnel to No. 79 Squadron, on 29 August 1986 No. 3 Squadron became the first operational RAAF unit to receive F/A-18 Hornets. Post-Cold War Two No. 3 Squadron Hornets in 2013 The squadron continues to operate the Hornets from its home base at RAAF Base Williamtown. In February 2002, during the Afghanistan War, elements of No. 3 Squadron were deployed to Diego Garcia, in the Indian Ocean, to relieve No. 77 Squadron, providing air defence for the Coalition base there. No. 3 Squadron personnel also participated in Operation Falconer, No. 75 Squadron's deployment to the Iraq War during 2003, conducting air interdiction operations and combat air patrols.Holmes, US Marine Corps and RAAF Hornet Units of Operation Iraqi Freedom, pp. 87‚Äì93 The squadron currently forms part of the Air Combat Group's No. 81 Wing RAAF. In April 2016, No. 3 Squadron deployed to the Middle East during Operation Okra as part of the military intervention against ISIL, taking over from No. 77 Squadron. On 8 December 2017, No. 3 Squadron ceased F/A-18 flight operations, followed by the disbandment of the squadron, under Wing Commander John Haly on 14 December 2017 and subsequent re-establishment of the squadron at Luke AFB in Arizona, under command of Wing Commander Darren Clare. All of its Hornets and most of its personnel were transferred to No. 77 Squadron.McLaughlin, To the Future, p. 30 As of February 2018, No. 3 Squadron was equipped with two F-35 Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning IIs and was scheduled to have ten of the type by the end of the year. It is planned to dispatch two of these F-35s to Australia in late 2018, with the other eight remaining in the United States for training purposes.

Its objective is to transport the resources of the Intelligent Network to the wireless network, utilizing the TIA-41 set of technical standards. Basing WIN standards on this protocol allows changing to an intelligent network without making current network infrastructure obsolete. Overview Today's wireless subscribers are much more sophisticated telecommunications users than they were five years ago. No longer satisfied with just completing a clear call, today's subscribers demand innovative ways to use the wireless phone. They want multiple services that allow them to handle or select incoming calls in a variety of ways. Enhanced services are very important to wireless customers. They have come to expect, for instance, services such as caller ID and voice messaging bundled in the package when they buy and activate a cellular or personal communications service (PCS) phone. Whether prepaid, voice/data messaging, Internet surfing, or location-sensitive billing, enhanced services will become an important differentiator in an already crowded, competitive service-provider market. Enhanced services will also entice potentially new subscribers to sign up for service and will drive up airtime through increased usage of PCS or cellular services. As the wireless market becomes increasingly competitive, rapid deployment of enhanced services becomes critical to a successful wireless strategy. Intelligent Network (IN) solutions have revolutionized wireline networks. Rapid creation and deployment of services has become the hallmark of a wireline network based on IN concepts. Wireless Intelligent Network (WIN) will bring those same successful strategies into the wireless networks. The evolution of wireless networks to a WIN concept of service deployment delivers the following advantages, similar to the IN benefits reaped by wireline providers: ‚Ä¢ Multivendor product offerings that faster competition ‚Ä¢ Uniform services to subscribers across service areas ‚Ä¢ Efficient network use ‚Ä¢ Service creation and deployment TIA-41 Standards TIA-41 describes procedures necessary to provide certain services requiring interaction between different cellular systems to cellular radio telephone subscribers. The standards aim to address the ongoing and developing concerns of the cellular radiotelecommunications industry with regard to useful and effective services requiring standardized intersystem procedures.

Life In 535 he was sent to Rome, as legate of a great African national synod of two hundred and seventeen bishops, to consult Pope Agapetus I (535-6) about a number of questions (Harduin, II, 1154; Mansi, VIII, 808). Like most north Africans he was vehemently opposed to Justinian's edict against the \\"Three Chapters\\" (544). He was frequently employed by the African bishops as their ambassador in the disputes that arose from that question. \\"Tired with the fatigue of traveling, and resting the mind a little from temporal cares\\" (according to the introduction to his book), he used his leisure to compose a summary history of the two great heresies of the preceding century. His object in writing it was avowedly to show how misjudged the emperor's condemnation of the Three Chapters was. The work is called Breviarium causae Nestorianorum et Eutychianorum (\\"A Short Account of the Affair of the Nestorians and Eutychians\\"), most often simply the Breviarium of Liberatus. The Breviarium begins with the ordination of Nestorius (428) and ends with the Fifth Ecumenical Council. From the fact that the author mentions Patriarch Theodosius I of Alexandria as being still alive, it is evident that it was written before 567, the year that Theodosius died. On the other hand, Liberatus records the death of Pope Vigilius (June 555). His authorities are the Historia tripartita of Cassiodorus, acts of synods, and letters of contemporary Fathers. In spite of Liberatus's controversial purpose and his indignation against Monophysites and all of those involved in the condemnation of the Three Chapters, his short history is well and fairly written. It forms an important document for the history of these movements.

Early life He was born in Tochigi Prefecture, about 100 km from Tokyo, Japan. In 1900, he graduated from the electrical engineering department of Tokyo Imperial University. Following his graduation, he joined a mining company as an engineer in its power plant. From there, he went on to several electric power companies. In 1906, he joined the Kuhara Mining Company at its Hitachi copper mine as an engineering section chief. Although his main duties at the mine were to ensure a stable supply of electricity and to maintain the mine's electrical equipment, he and his colleagues began working on the manufacture of a five-horsepower electric motor. This marked the beginning of the development that would become Hitachi, which was founded by Odaira in 1910. However, because it was started as an in-house venture of the Kuhara Mining Company, the owner of Hitachi was Fusanosuke Kuhara, the president of the mining company, not Odaira. Hitachi Ltd. was incorporated as an independent company in 1920. Odaira acted as the managing director of Hitachi from 1910 to 1929 and the president from 1929 to 1947. In 1947, Odaira was ordered out of this position by the U.S. occupation authorities. In 1951, this order was lifted, and he returned to the company as chairman emeritus.

It is controlled by No. 81 Wing, and equipped with McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet multi-role fighters. The squadron was formed at RAAF Station Pearce, Western Australia, in March 1942 and saw action in the South West Pacific theatre of World War II, operating Curtis P-40 Kittyhawks. After the war, it re-equipped with North American P-51 Mustangs and deployed to Japan as part of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force. The squadron was about to return to Australia when the Korean War broke out in June 1950, after which it joined United Nations forces supporting South Korea. It converted from Mustangs to Gloster Meteor jets between April and July 1951 and remained in Korea until October 1954, claiming five MiG-15s and over five thousand buildings and vehicles destroyed during the war for the loss of almost sixty aircraft, mainly to ground fire. The squadron re-equipped with CAC Sabres at Williamtown in November 1956. Two years later it transferred to RAAF Butterworth in Malaya to join the air campaign against communist guerrillas in the last stages of the Emergency. The squadron remained at Butterworth during the 1960s, providing regional air defence during the Konfrontasi between Indonesia and Malaysia. It returned to Williamtown in early 1969 to re-equip with Dassault Mirage III supersonic jet fighters. No. 77 Squadron began converting to Hornets in June 1987. It supplied a detachment of four aircraft to the American base on Diego Garcia in 2001‚Äì02, supporting the war in Afghanistan, and deployed to the Middle East as part of the military intervention against ISIL in 2015‚Äì16. Along with its Hornets, the squadron briefly operated Pilatus PC-9s in the forward air control role in the early 2000s. The RAAF plans to replace its Hornets with Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II fighters commencing in 2018, and No. 77 Squadron is scheduled to convert to the new type in 2021.

No. 81 Wing maintains three fighter squadrons for offensive and defensive counter-air operations. As well as air-to-air combat, No. 77 Squadron is tasked with land strike, close air support and maritime strike missions. Its staff includes maintenance, supply and other support personnel. The unit motto is \\"Swift to Destroy\\" and the crest features an oriental temple lion, a legacy of No. 77 Squadron's role in the Korean War. Nicknamed the \\"grumpy monkey\\", the lion represents \\"a defender of peace, which, when disturbed, is swift to destroy\\". The squadron operates McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet multi-role fighters, the first of which was delivered in June 1987. The twin-engined Hornet is armed with a 20 mm cannon and can carry short- and medium-range air-to-air missiles and a variety of guided and unguided air-to-surface ordnance. It can be refuelled in flight by the RAAF's Airbus KC-30A Multi Role Tanker Transports. No. 77 Squadron primarily operates the single-seat F/A-18A Hornet; each Hornet squadron also operates one or two F/A-18Bs, a two-seat model used for pilot conversion.

Three days later the Japanese attacked Milne Bay; the squadron claimed four bombers and a fighter for the loss of one Kittyhawk.Johnston, Whispering Death, pp. 285‚Äì287 By this time, Allied headquarters had finalised plans for a drive north to the Philippines involving heavy attacks on Rabaul and the occupation of territory in New Guinea, New Britain and the Solomon Islands.Odgers, Air War Against Japan, pp. 21‚Äì22 alt=Two single-engined military aircraft parked in front of palm trees No. 77 Squadron began moving to Goodenough Island in May 1943, and was fully established and ready for operations by 15 June.Odgers, Air War Against Japan, pp. 33‚Äì36 As Japanese fighter opposition was limited, the squadron took part in several ground-attack missions in New Britain, armed with incendiary and general-purpose bombs, a practice that had been employed by Kittyhawk units in the Middle East.Johnston, Whispering Death, p. 320 During one such raid on 2 August, Cresswell's designated successor as commanding officer, Flight Lieutenant Daryl Sproule, was forced to crash-land on a beach and was captured and executed by the Japanese.Odgers, Air War Against Japan, p. 71 Cresswell remained in command until Squadron Leader \\"Buster\\" Brown took over on 20 August. Japanese fighter strength in New Britain and New Guinea increased in September and October, and eight of No. 77 Squadron's Kittyhawks were briefly detached to Nadzab as escorts for the CAC Boomerangs of No. 4 Squadron, which were supporting the 7th Australian Division.Odgers, Air War Against Japan, pp. 80, 86 In January 1944, No. 77 Squadron took part in the two largest raids mounted by the RAAF to that time, each involving over seventy aircraft attacking targets in New Britain.Odgers, Air War Against Japan, pp. 130‚Äì131 It was subsequently assigned to Los Negros in the Admiralty Islands, joining Nos. 76 and 79 Squadrons under No. 73 Wing.Odgers, Air War Against Japan, p. 170 No. 77 Squadron's ground party went ashore at Los Negros on 6 March, in the middle of a firefight with Japanese forces.Odgers, Air War Against Japan, p. 173 Fourteen of the squadron's Kittyhawks arrived a week later, and another ten on 28 March.Odgers, Air War Against Japan, pp. 176, 179 Their primary duty was providing air cover for Allied shipping, though no Japanese aircraft were encountered; they also flew ground-attack missions in support of US troops on Manus Island.Johnston, Whispering Death, p. 340 Following the capture of the Admiralties, which completed the isolation of Rabaul, No. 77 Squadron remained with No. 73 Wing on garrison duty at Los Negros from May to July 1944.Odgers, Air War Against Japan, pp. 180‚Äì181Odgers, Air War Against Japan, p. 249 Between 13 August and 14 September 1944, the squadron transferred to Noemfoor in western New Guinea to join Nos. 76 and 82 Squadrons as part of No. 81 Wing under No. 10 Operational Group (later the Australian First Tactical Air Force), which had taken over the mobile role previously performed by No. 9 Group and was supporting the American landings along the north coast of New Guinea. Cresswell, now a wing commander, arrived for his second tour of duty as commanding officer on 26 September. Operating P-40N Kittyhawks, No. 77 Squadron bombed Japanese positions on the Vogelkop Peninsula in October and on Halmahera in November.Odgers, Air War Against Japan, p. 312 Cresswell handed over command in March 1945. The squadron moved to Morotai on 13 April and conducted ground-attack sorties over the Dutch East Indies until 30 June, when it redeployed with No. 81 Wing to Labuan to support the 9th Australian Division in North Borneo until hostilities ended in August 1945.Odgers, Air War Against Japan, pp. 470‚Äì473 The squadron's tally of aerial victories during the war was seven aircraft destroyed and four \\"probables\\", for the loss of eighteen pilots killed.Johnston, Whispering Death, p. 448 Occupation of Japan alt=Three single-seat military monoplanes, two with engines exposed, parked on tarmac with huts and mountains in the background No. 77 Squadron began re-equipping with North American P-51 Mustangs at Labuan in September 1945.Odgers, Air War Against Japan, pp. 495‚Äì496 In the wake of Japan's surrender, No. 81 Wing became part of Australia's contribution to the British Commonwealth Occupation Force (BCOF). No. 77 Squadron was the last of the wing's three flying units to deploy to Japan, arriving at Bofu, a former kamikaze base, on 21 March 1946.Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, pp. 213‚Äì216 No. 481 (Maintenance) Squadron provided technical service for the Mustangs.Stephens, Going Solo, p. 214 Occupation duties proved uneventful, the main operational task being surveillance patrols, but units maintained an intensive training regime and undertook combined exercises with other Allied forces.Stephens, Going Solo, pp. 216‚Äì218 Many RAAF personnel were accompanied to Japan by their families.Stephens, Going Solo, p. 220 No. 81 Wing transferred to Iwakuni in April 1948, the same month that the Federal government decided to reduce Australia's contribution to BCOF, retaining only No. 77 Squadron in Japan. Wing headquarters and No. 481 Squadron disbanded in November 1948, and No. 77 Squadron came under the aegis of a new organisation called RAAF Component. The squadron was now the largest operational unit in the RAAF, with a strength of 299 officers and men, forty Mustangs, three CAC Wirraways, two Douglas C-47 Dakotas and two Austers.Stephens, Going Solo, p. 222 The Dakotas and Austers formed the No. 77 Squadron Communications Flight.Wilson, The Brotherhood of Airmen, p. 170Hurst, The Forgotten Few, p. 29 In December 1949, the Mustangs competed in a gunnery competition against three groups of Mustangs and two groups of F-80 Shooting Star jets belonging to the US Far East Air Force (FEAF). No. 77 Squadron's Flight Lieutenant \\"Bay\\" Adams achieved the highest individual score of the competition, earning the personal congratulations of Lieutenant Generals George E. Stratemeyer, commander of FEAF, and Horace Robertson, commander of BCOF.Eather, Odd Jobs, pp. 17‚Äì18 The RAAF personnel were preparing to return to Australia when, on 25 June 1950, they were placed on standby for action in the Korean War, which had just broken out.Stephens, Going Solo, pp. 222‚Äì224 Korean War alt=Man in flying suit in the cockpit of a single-seat fighter Led by Wing Commander Lou Spence, No. 77 Squadron was committed to action over Korea as part of United Nations Command (UN), and came under the operational control of the US Fifth Air Force.Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, pp. 229‚Äì230 The Australian unit was specifically requested by General Douglas MacArthur, commander of UN forces; the Mustang was considered the best long-range ground-attack aircraft in the theatre, and Stratemeyer contended that No. 77 Squadron was the best Mustang outfit in Japan.O'Neill, Australia in the Korean War: Volume 1, pp. 52‚Äì53 The squadron flew its initial escort and patrol sorties from Iwakuni on 2 July 1950, becoming the first non-American UN unit to commence operations.Stephens, Going Solo, p. 225 Several Australian families were still living at Iwakuni pending their repatriation from what had become an operational theatre, and could watch the Mustangs depart for missions over Korea.Hurst, The Forgotten Few, pp. 32‚Äì33 A friendly fire incident occurred on 3 July 1950, when No. 77 Squadron attacked a train full of US and South Korean troops on the main highway between Suwon and Pyongtaek, inflicting many casualties, twenty-nine of them fatal.O'Neill, Australia in the Korean War: Volume 2, p. 305Eather, Odd Jobs, p. 86 Spence had raised concerns before the mission that the North Koreans could not have penetrated so far south, but was assured by Fifth Air Force controllers that the target was correct; the incident was widely reported in US newspapers but a public statement by Stratemeyer cleared the RAAF of any blame.Stephens, Going Solo, p. 226Hurst, The Forgotten Few, p. 35 No. 77 Squadron did not encounter enemy aircraft in the opening phase of the war but often faced intense ground fire. It suffered its first fatality on 7 July when its deputy commander, Squadron Leader Graham Strout, was killed during a raid on Samchok. He was also the first Australian, and the first non-American UN serviceman, to die in Korea.Hurst, The Forgotten Few, p. 39Eather, Odd Jobs, p. xvii For the next two months, equipped with bombs, rockets and napalm, No. 77 Squadron supported UN troops retreating before the North Korean advance. To expedite turnaround times between missions, the Mustangs, which were still based at Iwakuni, often refuelled and rearmed at Taegu near the Pusan Perimeter, where UN forces made a last-ditch stand on the southern tip of Korea.Eather, Odd Jobs, pp. 92‚Äì94 One of the squadron's Dakotas regularly flew between Iwakuni and Taegu carrying ordnance and spare parts. According to the official history of the Air Force in 1946‚Äì71, the squadron's part in the victory at Pusan earned recognition \\"not only for the RAAF but also Australia at the highest political levels in the United States\\". During a visit to Japan in August 1950, Prime Minister Robert Menzies presented the Gloucester Cup to No. 77 Squadron as the RAAF's most proficient unit of the past year. That month, the squadron claimed thirty-five tanks, 212 other vehicles, eighteen railway engines or cars, and thirteen fuel or ammunition dumps destroyed.Hurst, The Forgotten Few, p. 55 alt=Twelve men in flying suits in a semi-circle around another man in front of a twin-engined jet aircraft On 3 September 1950, Sergeant Bill Harrop was forced down behind enemy lines and executed by the North Koreans.Eather, Odd Jobs, pp. 95‚Äì96Hurst, The Forgotten Few, p. 59 Six days later, Spence was killed when his Mustang failed to pull out of a dive during a napalm attack on Angang- ni.Stephens, Going Solo, p. 227Hurst, The Forgotten Few, p. 61 His death was a serious blow to the squadron, and the RAAF despatched Cresswell on his third tour as commanding officer to replace him. Cresswell arrived at Iwakuni on 17 September and set about restoring morale, undertaking four sorties on his first day of operations three days later.Hurst, The Forgotten Few, pp. 62‚Äì64 MacArthur had meanwhile launched an amphibious landing behind North Korean lines at Inchon on 15 September, forcing the communists to retreat from the Pusan Perimeter. No. 77 Squadron was transferred from Iwakuni to Pohang, South Korea, on 12 October, to support UN forces advancing northwards.Stephens, Going Solo, pp. 227‚Äì228 On 20 October, the squadron became a component of the RAAF's newly established No. 91 (Composite) Wing, which also included No. 391 (Base) Squadron, No. 491 (Maintenance) Squadron, and No. 30 Communications Flight, formerly the No. 77 Squadron Communications Flight.Stephens, Going Solo, p. 228 The wing and all units except No. 77 Squadron, which came under the operational control of the US 35th Fighter-Interceptor Group, were headquartered at Iwakuni. China entered the war in mid-October 1950, attacking advancing UN troops as they closed in on the Yalu River. No. 77 Squadron undertook its first sorties against Chinese ground forces on 1 November.Stephens, Going Solo, p. 229Eather, Odd Jobs, p. 102 The squadron flew its first missions supporting the Australian Army on 5 November, when it attacked Chinese troops opposing the 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, at Pakchon.Hurst, The Forgotten Few, p. 84 No. 77 Squadron personnel were housed in tents in freezing conditions at Pohung; two pilots died from burns after a fire in their quarters on 14 November.Eather, Odd Jobs, pp. 100‚Äì101 Two days later the Australians began moving forward with the 35th Group to Yonpo Airfield, near Hamhung.Hurst, The Forgotten Few, p. 80 North Korea's counter-attack, supported by Chinese forces, led to the squadron being withdrawn to Pusan on 3 December 1950.Stephens, Going Solo, p. 231 The communists operated a Russian-designed swept-wing jet fighter, the Mikoyan- Gurevich MiG-15, that was far superior to all other fighters in the theatre except the new North American F-86 Sabre.Stephens, Going Solo, pp. 229‚Äì230 Although the MiGs carried Chinese or North Korean markings, they were frequently operated by seasoned Russian air force pilots, whose deployment was unofficial, as the Soviet Union was not a combatant in the Korean War.Krylov; Tepsurkaev, Soviet MiG-15 Aces of the Korean War, pp. 40, 51Hurst, The Forgotten Few, pp. 107, 140 alt=Twin-jet military aircraft parked at airfield The RAAF attempted to procure Sabres to replace No. 77 Squadron's Mustangs, but the priority being given to re-equipping the USAF meant that deliveries would not be possible until 1954. The Australian government agreed to purchase Gloster Meteor straight-wing jet fighters from Britain as the only viable alternative; the initial order included thirty-six single-seat Mk.8 interceptors and four two-seat Mk.7 trainers. No. 77 Squadron completed its last Mustang mission on 6 April 1951 and returned to Iwakuni the next day to begin converting to Meteors. It subsequently transferred to Kimpo, South Korea, and commenced operations with its new aircraft on 29 July.Eather, Odd Jobs, pp. 119, 126Hurst, The Forgotten Few, pp. 126, 142 The squadron deployed twenty-two Meteors at Kimpo, and came under the control of the USAF's 4th Fighter-Interceptor Wing. Although it had operated effectively as a ground- attack unit with its Mustangs, No. 77 Squadron's primary role in the RAAF was interception, and it was expected that with the Meteor it could again focus on fighter duties, particularly as by this stage the USAF had only two squadrons of Sabres in the theatre.Stephens, Going Solo, pp. 231‚Äì233 Wing Commander Gordon Steege succeeded Cresswell on 16 August 1951, by which time No. 77 Squadron's Meteors had conducted offensive sweeps up the Yalu River with USAF Sabres, and escorted Boeing B-29 Superfortresses on bombing missions.Stephens, Going Solo, p. 234Hurst, The Forgotten Few, pp. 143‚Äì145 MiG-15s had appeared on several occasions without engaging the Meteors; it was speculated at the time, and subsequently confirmed, that they had been observing the performance of the newly arrived RAAF jets.Eather, Odd Jobs, pp. 126‚Äì127 No. 77 Squadron's first Meteor fatalities occurred on 22 August, when two aircraft collided in mid-air as they returned to Kimpo after a sweep.RAAF Historical Section, Fighter Units, p. 58 The Meteors first engaged MiG-15s on 25 August, but scored no hits. Four days later, eight Meteors and sixteen Sabres fought twelve MiGs; one RAAF pilot ejected when his aircraft was shot down, and a second Meteor was badly damaged. One week later another Meteor suffered severe damage in a dogfight with MiGs.Hurst, The Forgotten Few, pp. 147‚Äì151 As a result of these clashes, Steege became convinced that the Meteor was outclassed as a fighter. Following discussions with the Fifth Air Force, he decided to take No. 77 Squadron out of its air-to-air combat role and curtail its operations in \\"MiG Alley\\", the area between the Yalu and Chongchon Rivers on North Korea's border with Manchuria. This caused controversy among those who believed that proper tactics exploiting the Meteor's manoeuvrability and heavy armament would have allowed it to remain competitive as a fighter; for the Australian pilots the change of role amounted to a loss of prestige.Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, pp. 236‚Äì237O'Neill, Australia in the Korean War: Volume 2, pp. 335, 358 The Chief of the Air Staff, Air Marshal George Jones, backed the decision, which relegated the squadron mainly to escort duty and local air defence. Morale suffered and it was not until Wing Commander Ron Susans succeeded Steege on 26 December 1951 that the Meteors were once more assigned an offensive role, namely ground attack.Wilson, The Brotherhood of Airmen, pp. 181‚Äì182 No. 77 Squadron pilots and their Meteors at Kunsan, South Korea, June 1954.

Both sides apparently overestimated the scale of the battle and the damage inflicted to their opponents: three Meteors‚Äîone flown by Pilot Officer Vance Drummond‚Äîwere lost, but Soviet pilots claimed nine destroyed; Australian pilots claimed one MiG shot down and another damaged, from a formation of at least forty, though Russian sources suggest that all the MiGs returned to base and less than twenty-five were available to 176 GvIAP at the time.Hurst, The Forgotten Few, pp. 171‚Äì172Krylov; Tepsurkaev, Soviet MiG-15 Aces of the Korean War, pp. 48‚Äì49 On 8 January 1952, Susans led the squadron on its first ground-attack mission in Meteors, which were armed with eight rockets under the wings as well as their four internal 20 mm cannon, at Chongdan.Stephens, Going Solo, p. 238Hurst, The Forgotten Few, p. 182 They continued to operate mainly in the ground-attack role until the end of the war, but registered two more victories over MiGs near Pyongyang on 4 and 8 May 1952.Stephens, Going Solo, p. 241Hurst, The Forgotten Few, pp. 194‚Äì195 The squadron took part in a mass air strike on 29 August, when 420 UN aircraft attacked Pyongyang.Eather, Odd Jobs, pp. 150‚Äì151Hurst, The Forgotten Few, pp. 201‚Äì202 One Meteor was shot down and another damaged by MiGs following a ground-attack mission on 2 October 1952.Eather, Odd Jobs, p. 152 The squadron played a leading role in the destruction of a large North Korean convoy on 16 March 1953: two Meteors discovered a line of some 140 vehicles in a mountain pass south of Wonsan, halted it by destroying trucks at the front and rear of the convoy, and then called in further support from Kimpo and the USAF. The Australian aircraft eventually claimed twenty-four trucks out of a total of ninety vehicles destroyed or damaged by UN forces.Hurst, The Forgotten Few, p. 214‚Äì215 No. 77 Squadron was credited with downing its last MiG southeast of Pyongyang on 27 March.Hurst, The Forgotten Few, pp. 215‚Äì216 Squadron Leader Len McGlinchey became its final wartime fatality when his Meteor crashed while taking off from Kimpo on 16 July.Hurst, The Forgotten Few, p. 223 Following the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement on 27 July 1953, the squadron remained in South Korea on garrison duties‚Äîinitially at Kimpo, later at Kunsan‚Äîuntil transferring to Iwakuni on 12 October 1954.Stephens, Going Solo, p. 242 It departed for Australia on 19 November and arrived in Sydney on 3 December, having been based overseas for eleven years, a record for an RAAF unit. Its performance in the early days of the war has been cited as a factor in the United States' decision to ratify the ANZUS treaty in September 1951.Stephens, Going Solo, pp. 35‚Äì36 The squadron's casualty rate in Korea was twenty-five percent killed or captured.Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, p. 240Eather, Odd Jobs, p. 162 Forty-one pilots died, thirty-five from the RAAF and six on exchange from the Royal Air Force.Hurst, The Forgotten Few, p. 207 A further seven pilots became prisoners of war.RAAF Historical Section, Fighter Units, p. 59Hurst, The Forgotten Few, p. 228 Aircraft losses totalled almost sixty, including over forty Meteors, mostly to ground fire.Hurst, The Forgotten Few, pp. 230‚Äì232 The squadron flew 18,872 sorties, including 3,872 in Mustangs and 15,000 in Meteors.Hurst, The Forgotten Few, p. 224 It was credited with shooting down five MiG-15s and destroying 3,700 buildings, 1,408 vehicles, ninety-eight railway engines and carriages, and sixteen bridges.Hurst, The Forgotten Few, p. 231 Malayan Emergency and Konfrontasi alt=Single-engined fighter jet being refuelled from tanker truck No. 77 Squadron became operational at RAAF Base Williamtown, New South Wales, on 4 January 1955.O'Neill, Australia in the Korean War, p. 592 On 21 March, it joined Nos. 3 and 75 Squadrons as part of No. 78 Wing, which had recently been reorganised following garrison duty in Malta.No. 78 Wing, \\"Operations Record Book\\", pp. 372‚Äì373 No. 77 Squadron ceased Meteor operations in August 1956 and re-formed on 19 November equipped with CAC Sabres. Between October 1958 and February 1959, Nos. 3 and 77 Squadrons deployed with No. 78 Wing to RAAF Butterworth in Malaya, to support Commonwealth forces in the Emergency. The Sabres were among the first to wear the RAAF's recently introduced \\"leaping kangaroo\\" roundel.Stephens, Going Solo, pp. 252, 259‚Äì260 No. 478 (Maintenance) Squadron provided servicing for the aircraft.RAAF Historical Section, Maintenance Units, pp. 59‚Äì62 No. 77 Squadron undertook its first mission dive-bombing communist guerrillas on 13 August 1959, and flew two more ground-attack sorties on 10 June 1960.No. 77 Squadron, \\"Operations Record Book\\" (1958‚Äì79), pp. 80, 115 The RAAF pilots also sometimes tried to startle the communists by diving their jets through the sound barrier to create sonic booms that simulated the sound of artillery fire.Eather, Odd Jobs, p. 76 Two No. 77 Squadron Sabres collided in mid-air on 22 July, but both pilots ejected safely. The Emergency was declared officially over on 31 July 1960. The RAAF squadrons remained at Butterworth as part of Australia's contribution to the Commonwealth Strategic Reserve. Eight Sabres, along with their pilots and ground crew, were detached from No. 77 Squadron in May 1962 to re-form No. 79 Squadron at Ubon, Thailand.Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, pp. 254‚Äì255No. 77 Squadron, \\"Operations Record Book\\" (1958‚Äì79), pp. 200‚Äì201 The Sabres were flown to Thailand via Singapore to give the appearance that they were not drawn from the Strategic Reserve, thus preserving Malaysia's neutrality. Personnel and equipment from Nos. 3 and 77 Squadrons continued to rotate through No. 79 Squadron on a regular basis.Susans, The RAAF Mirage Story, p. vi The Butterworth-based Sabres, armed with Sidewinder missiles, were responsible for regional air defence during the Konfrontasi between Indonesia and Malaysia from July 1963 until August 1966, though no combat took place.Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, pp. 251‚Äì252 From 26 October until 27 November 1965, a detachment of six Sabres from No. 77 Squadron was based at Labuan to conduct combat patrols over the Indonesian‚ÄìMalaysian border on Borneo. Following the disbandment of No. 78 Wing in November 1967, No. 77 Squadron became an independently operating unit under the command of Headquarters RAAF Butterworth. Supersonic era No. 77 Squadron returned to Williamtown in early 1969 to re-equip with Dassault Mirage III supersonic fighters, undertaking its initial flights on 7 July.Susans, The RAAF Mirage Story, p. 94 The Mirages were charged with interception, high- and low-angle bombing, close air support, and photo reconnaissance; their armament included 30 mm cannon, Sidewinder missiles and conventional bombs.Susans, The RAAF Mirage Story, pp. 94‚Äì99, 151 No. 77 Squadron's prime role was ground attack, although none of the RAAF's Mirages ever saw combat.Stephens, Going Solo, p. 359Susans, The RAAF Mirage Story, pp. 94, 120 No. 481 Squadron was responsible for day-to-day servicing, as well as most heavy maintenance.Susans, The RAAF Mirage Story, pp. 147, 152 No. 77 Squadron suffered its first fatal Mirage accident on 3 April 1973, when an aircraft crashed during a training flight at low altitude. Another pilot was killed when his Mirage hit the water during formation flying at night on 24 June 1976.Susans, The RAAF Mirage Story, p. 156 The squadron began training with laser-guided bombs in October 1980.Susans, The RAAF Mirage Story, p. 103 As of March 1984, its aircraft complement was nineteen Mirages.Susans, The RAAF Mirage Story, p. 106 Two pilots died following a mid-air collision at low level on 9 April that year.Susans, The RAAF Mirage Story, p. 157 alt=Side view of two delta-wing jet fighters in flight On 1 January 1985, in preparation for the introduction of the McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet to Australian service, No. 77 Squadron took over all Mirages and Macchi MB-326s of No. 2 Operational Conversion Unit, assuming responsibility for fighter combat instructor, introductory fighter, and Mirage conversion courses.RAAF Historical Section, Training Units, pp. 62‚Äì64Susans, The RAAF Mirage Story, pp. 90, 107 The transfer swelled the squadron's strength to fifty-six aircraft‚Äîforty Mirages and sixteen Macchis‚Äîand over 500 officers and men, making it the largest operational unit in the RAAF.Wilson, Phantom, Hornet and Skyhawk in Australian Service, p. 116 Along with a heavily expanded training program, and its existing Australian Army close support role, No. 77 Squadron's fleet support commitment was increased to take up the slack resulting from the diminution of the Royal Australian Navy's fixed-wing capability.Susans, The RAAF Mirage Story, pp. 79, 90‚Äì91 Its last fatal accident with the Mirage occurred on 2 May 1986; the aircraft crashed into water during air-to-air gunnery practice.Susans, The RAAF Mirage Story, p. 158 The squadron began phasing out the Mirage in July 1986, and took delivery of its first Hornet on 29 June 1987.Susans, The RAAF Mirage Story, p. 110 It had come under the control of a newly re-formed No. 81 Wing that February. No. 77 Squadron's last Mirage departed Williamtown on 27 November 1987.Susans, The RAAF Mirage Story, p. 153 Hornet maintenance at Williamtown was the responsibility of No. 481 Wing, which had evolved from No. 481 Squadron.RAAF Historical Section, Maintenance Units, pp. 116‚Äì117Odgers, Air Force Australia, p. 192 One of No. 77 Squadron's Hornets crashed near Rockhampton, Queensland, on 19 May 1992, killing the pilot and his passenger, a defence scientist. In September that year, the squadron undertook a proving exercise over Halifax Bay in Far North Queensland, when four of its Hornets‚Äîrefuelled in flight on the round trip from Williamtown by a Boeing 707 tanker‚Äîbecame the first jet aircraft in Australia to drop aerial mines.Wilson, Phantom, Hornet and Skyhawk in Australian Service, pp. 122‚Äì123 No. 481 Wing was reorganised as No. 402 Wing in July 1996; the latter transferred its functions to No. 81 Wing's flying squadrons in July 1998.

Four Hornets from No. 77 Squadron were deployed to protect the US base at Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean between November 2001 and February 2002, during the early phase of the war in Afghanistan. In March 2006, the squadron sent a detachment of aircraft to RAAF Base East Sale, Victoria, to assist with security for the Commonwealth Games being held in Melbourne. No. 77 Squadron deployed to the Middle East in September 2015 as part of Operation Okra, Australia's contribution of the military intervention against ISIL; it handed over to the next rotation, from No. 3 Squadron RAAF, in April 2016. The Australian government plans to replace the Hornet force with seventy-two Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II fighters. Under the Defence Materiel Organisation's Project AIR 6000 Phase 2A/B, the first Lightnings will be delivered to the RAAF in late 2018. Each of No. 81 Wing's three fighter squadrons will operate sixteen of the new aircraft. No. 77 Squadron is scheduled to begin conversion in 2021; RAAF Hornet operations are expected to cease the following year.Department of Defence, Facilities Requirements for the New Air Combat Capability, pp. 1‚Äì4 In December 2017, No. 77 Squadron received all of No. 3 Squadron's Hornets and most of its personnel when that unit was re-formed as an F-35 unit.

McQuarrie, Statistical Mechanics, Harper & Row, 1973 traditionally refers to the component of the canonical partition function resulting from the vibrational degrees of freedom of a system. The vibrational partition function is only well-defined in model systems where the vibrational motion is relatively uncoupled with the system's other degrees of freedom. Definition For a system (such as a molecule or solid) with uncoupled vibrational modes the vibrational partition function is defined by Q_{vib}(T) =\\\\prod_j{\\\\sum_n{e^{-\\\\frac{E_{j,n}}{k_B T}}}} where T is the absolute temperature of the system, k_B is the Boltzmann constant, and E_{j,n} is the energy of j'th mode when it has vibrational quantum number n= 0, 1, 2, \\\\ldots . For an isolated molecule of n atoms, the number of vibrational modes (i.e. values of j) is 3n ‚àí 5 for linear molecules and 3n ‚àí 6 for non-linear ones.G. Herzberg, Infrared and Raman Spectra, Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1945 In crystals, the vibrational normal modes are commonly known as phonons. Approximations=Quantum harmonic oscillator The most common approximation to the vibrational partition function uses a model in which the vibrational eigenmodes or normal modes of the system are considered to be a set of uncoupled quantum harmonic oscillators. It is a first order approximation to the partition function which allows one to calculate the contribution of the vibrational degrees of freedom of molecules towards its thermodynamic variables. A quantum harmonic oscillator has an energy spectrum characterized by: E_{j,n}=\\\\hbar\\\\omega_j(n_j +\\\\frac{1}{2}) where j runs over vibrational modes and n_j is the vibrational quantum number in the j 'th mode, \\\\hbar is Planck's constant, h, divided by 2 \\\\pi and \\\\omega_j is the angular frequency of the j'th mode. Using this approximation we can derive a closed form expression for the vibrational partition function. Q_{vib}(T) =\\\\prod_j{\\\\sum_n{e^{-\\\\frac{E_{j,n}}{k_B T}}}} = \\\\prod_j e^{-\\\\frac{\\\\hbar \\\\omega_j}{2 k_B T}} \\\\sum_n \\\\left( e^{-\\\\frac{\\\\hbar \\\\omega_j}{k_B T}} \\\\right)^n = \\\\prod_j \\\\frac{e^{-\\\\frac{\\\\hbar \\\\omega_j}{2 k_B T}}}{ 1 - e^{-\\\\frac{\\\\hbar \\\\omega_j}{k_B T}} } = e^{- \\\\frac{E_{ZP}}{k_B T}} \\\\prod_j \\\\frac{1}{ 1 - e^{-\\\\frac{\\\\hbar \\\\omega_j}{k_B T}} } where E_{ZP} = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\sum_j \\\\hbar \\\\omega_j is total vibrational zero point energy of the system. Often the wavenumber, \\\\tilde{ u} with units of cm‚àí1 is given instead of the angular frequency of a vibrational mode and also often misnamed frequency. One can convert to angular frequency by using \\\\omega = 2 \\\\pi c \\\\tilde{ u} where c is the speed of light in vacuum. In terms of the vibrational wavenumbers we can write the partition function as Q_{vib}(T) = e^{- \\\\frac{E_{ZP}}{k_B T}} \\\\prod_j \\\\frac{1}{ 1 - e^{-\\\\frac{ h c \\\\tilde{ u}_j}{k_B T}} }  References See also * Partition function (mathematics) Category:Partition functions ","title":"Vibrational partition function"},{"id":"3573308","text":"Kolomensky District () is an administrativeLaw #11/2013-OZ and municipalLaw #43/2005-OZ district (raion), one of the thirty-six in Moscow Oblast, Russia.

In the late 1930s he was considered a potential contender for the World Championship. Eliskases was granted the title of grandmaster by FIDE in 1952. Chess career Born in Innsbruck, Austro-Hungarian Empire, he learned chess at the age of twelve and quickly displayed an aptitude for the game, winning the Schlechter chess club championship in his first year at the club, aged just fourteen. At fifteen, he was the Tyrolean Champion and at sixteen, joint winner of the Austrian Championship. His college education in Innsbruck and Vienna centred on business studies; it was chess, though, that captured his imagination and he had exceptional results representing Austria at the Olympiads of 1930, 1933 and 1935. After the Anschluss of March 1938, he won the German national championship at Bad Oeynhausen in 1938 and 1939. Other early successes included outright or joint first place at Budapest 1934 (the Hungarian Championship), Linz 1934, Z√ºrich 1935, Milan 1937; and match wins against Rudolf Spielmann (in 1932, 1936 and 1937). He acted as a to Alexander Alekhine during Alekhine's successful world championship rematch against Max Euwe in 1937. His best two years were 1938 and 1939.The Life and Times of ERICH ELISKASES (1913 ‚Äì 1997), New in Chess, 1997, n.5 In June 1938 he won a tournament in Noordwijk ahead of Paul Keres (who later that year would win the great AVRO 1938 chess tournament) and previous world champion Max Euwe.Noordwijk (1938), Chessgames.com His victory in Noordwijk was his best career result,The World's Great Chess Games, Reuben Fine, David McKay Company, 1976 and began a streak of eight consecutive tournaments in which he was undefeated: six in 1938 and 1939, including Krefeld 1938, Bad Harzburg 1939, Bad Elster 1939, Vienna 1939; and two later in South America. He also a won match against previous world championship challenger Efim Bogoljubov in 1939. These successes led to suggestions of a World Championship match with Alekhine. Documentary evidence later showed that the Nazi regime had scheduled him a 1941 match with the World Champion, but had subsequently abandoned the idea. In 1941, Alekhine spoke out in favour of a match with either Eliskases or Keres, preferring the former. But Dutch grandmaster Hans Ree argues that it does not mean Eliskases was the strongest contender: it was one of a series of antisemitic articles attributed to Alekhine, and the suggestion of a German contender was probably politically motivated. In 1939, Eliskases emigrated to South America. He played under the German flag at the 1939 Buenos Aires Olympiad, during which World War II began, when Eliskases (along with many other players) decided to stay in Argentina (and for a while in Brazil) rather than return to Europe. During those years he struggled to make a living; and in Brazil he was threatened with internment and expulsion, though some Brazilian chess enthusiasts helped Eliskases avoid that fate by hiring him as a chess teacher. In 1951 he returned to Argentina, where he eventually became a naturalized Argentine citizen and represented his new country at the Olympiads of 1952, 1958, 1960 and 1964. Thus he represented three different countries at Olympiads: Austria, Germany and Argentina, possibly the only person to do so. Tournament success in South America included first or joint first at √Åguas de S√£o Pedro/S√£o Paulo 1941, S√£o Paulo 1947, Mar del Plata 1948, Punta del Este 1951 and C√≥rdoba 1959. FIDE awarded Eliskases the titles of International Master and Grandmaster in 1950 and 1952, respectively. He carried on playing through the 1950s, 1960s and even into the 1970s, but his results were less convincing. He married the Argentinian Mar√≠a Esther Almeda in 1954 and had a son, Carlos Enrico. In 1976, he and his wife went back to the Austrian Tyrol, but the couple failed to settle and returned to C√≥rdoba in Argentina. Eliskases was also a strong correspondence player and his notes showed that he scored over 75 percent during his most active period. He was considered an expert in the endgame‚Äîat Semmering 1937, he outplayed and beat Capablanca in this phase, despite this being the forte of the Cuban ex-world champion. Hans Ree observes that Eliskases is one of only four players (along with Keres, Reshevsky and Euwe) to beat both Capablanca and Bobby Fischer.Eliskases, Hans Ree, NRC-Handelsblad March 8, 1997 He had even scores against Euwe (3‚Äì3),Eliskases versus Euwe, Chessgames.com Capablanca (2‚Äì2)Eliskases versus Capablanca, Chessgames.com and Fischer (1‚Äì1).Eliskases versus Fischer, Chessgames.com Notable games * This was the first of Eliskases' three wins (in seven games) against Euwe, who became world champion the same year.

Sadleir was the son of Clement William Sadleir, a farmer, of Shrone Hill, County Tipperary. His mother was the daughter of James Scully, a local banker. His brother John, with whom he was involved in the Tipperary Joint Stock Bank, was MP for Carlow Borough from 1847. Entry to politics James Sadleir was approached to stand as a Liberal candidate for the Tipperary constituency in the 1852 election and initially refused, but was eventually induced to accept; he was formally nominated by the incumbent, Nicholas Maher, and was elected easily. He supported the idea of religious equality in Ireland, although without much enthusiasm for the Roman Catholic priests in his county who passed a vote of censure in April 1853. His brother served in Lord Aberdeen's government as a Junior Lord of the Treasury from December 1852 to January 1854 when he resigned, having been implicated in an attempt to imprison a depositor of the Tipperary Joint Stock Bank who had refused to vote for him. Banking scandal The scandal that led to both of their downfalls arose through the crash of the Tipperary Bank in February 1856. The Bank's London agents, Glyn and Co., refused to pay on draughts of the bank, returning them with the words \\"not provided for\\". The Bank of Ireland continued to pay as usual for a week more, resulting in a rush of investors withdrawing their money there. Then, on 17 February, John Sadleir, who had been the principal creditor of the bank, committed suicide on Hampstead Heath. He sent a suicide note to James' wife Emma which read \\"James is not to blame‚ÄìI alone have caused all this dreadful ruin. James was to me too fond a brother but he is not to blame for being deceived and led astray by my diabolical acts. Be to him at this moment all the support you can. Oh what I would not suffer with gladness to save those whom I have ruined. My end will prove at least that I was not callous to their agony.\\" It was found by the Irish courts that John Sadleir had begun to abstract money from the bank from about the end of 1854, and took a total of ¬£288,000. Investigations James Sadleir was Chairman, Managing Director and a public agent of the bank, and on 29 February the first creditor sued him to recover ¬£2,827 15s. 4d. It was recognised that he would inevitably bear the brunt of the failure, and The Times reported that there was \\"a wide- spread feeling of pity\\" for him as he was already a ruined man. Other creditors of the bank rushed to try to recover their money from him. An early judgment absolved the managers of the bank of responsibility, but was soon reversed. The court inquiries disclosed letters written from John to James which implicated him in organising the frauds. However, Sadleir absconded on 17 June. Questions were asked why no criminal charges had been brought against him by this stage, any previous sympathy for his position having disappeared. Charges were brought on 18 July. Expelled from the House No-one was entirely sure where Sadleir was. In September, a Carlow newspaper reported that the police were on the wrong scent in looking in New Orleans, as he had made his way to South America. By February 1857, all patience was at an end, and the Attorney-General for Ireland successfully moved for Sadleir's expulsion for failing to surrender to the warrants for his arrest. A letter was read in the debate which placed Sadleir in Paris where he dined every day at the Palais Royal. He was expelled by the House on 16 February. His estates and those of his wife were seized by creditors and sold. Fate On 13 May, a letter from Sadleir, posted in Paris, was published in the Dublin Evening Post. He denied involvement in the frauds, and stated that he had denounced his brother when he learnt what he had been doing. This apologia was swiftly countered by James Scully, his cousin who was also implicated in the scandal, who described James as a \\"notorious culprit\\". Sadleir was maintained by an annuity paid by his wife's family, the Wheatleys. He never returned to face justice, and moved to Switzerland in 1861, living in Geneva and then Z√ºrich. Twenty years later, while taking his regular walk up the Z√ºrichberg, Sadleir came upon a thief intent on robbing him of his gold watch. He resisted and was shot dead, his body being concealed in the thicket by the side of the path where it was discovered a week later. His funeral was well-attended. His will was dated 23 May 1856, although the executors suspected that he may have made a later will which they were unable to find.

Born at S√£o Clemente de Basto, Celorico de Basto, son of Jos√© Ribeiro (born ca 1860) and wife Ana Gon√ßalves (born ca 1904), both from the same location, Ribeiro was ordained as a priest on 5 July 1953 in Braga. On 3 July 1967 he was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of Braga and Titular Bishop of Tigillava, and was consecrated a bishop on 17 September. Ribeiro graduated with a degree in theology from the Pontifical Gregorian University of Rome and lectured in the Superior Institute of Catholic Culture. His doctoral thesis, written in 1959, was The Doctrine of Errors in Saint Thomas Aquinas. During the 1960s he continued his studies in Braga and was made member of such institutions as the Superior Institute of Social and Political Sciences. He also attended the Theological Faculties of Innsbruck and Munich. Meanwhile, in 1960 he also began to appear in television with a program called Dia do Senhor (The Lord's Day), and collaborated with several religious magazines and newspapers, beyond his own publications. On Manuel Gon√ßalves Cerejeira's retirement as Patriarch in 1971, Ribeiro became his successor. He was appointed Vicar Apostolic of the Portuguese Military in 1972, and was elevated by Pope Paul VI on 5 March 1973 to Cardinal-Priest of Sant'Antonio da Padova in Via Merulana,Cardinal Title S. Antonio da Padova in Via Merulana GCatholic.org at the age of 44 becoming the youngest cardinal since Cerejeira himself forty-four years earlier. He remains the youngest cardinal appointed since 1930. He attended the 1978 August and October Conclaves. In 1991, he was the papal envoy to the 5th centennial celebration of evangelization in Luanda, Angola. Recognised as a man of compromise (and markedly less close to the Estado Novo government than Cerejeira had been), Ribeiro was nevertheless very determined in defending the rights and privileges of the Church in his country. He died of cancer in Lisbon in 1998 two months before his 70th birthday and is buried in the tomb of the patriarchs in the Monastery of S√£o Vicente de Fora. He was the Principal Consecrator in 1978 of Jos√© da Cruz Policarpo, who succeeded him as Patriarch, and in 1989 of Janu√°rio Ferreira, who succeeded him as Military vicar of Portugal in 2001.

It is regarded as important contributor to the Community Arts Movement. Starting in 1967, many of its productions involved Craigmillar Castle.  Inception  The Craigmillar Festival Committee was established in 1962, when a mothers group at Peffermill Primary School, south-east side of Edinburgh, created a Festival to celebrate local talent with the aid of then local councillor Jack Kane.http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12210123.Jack_Kane/ By 1962, Craigmillar was suffering from all the social ills of 20th century urban living and decay. The crunch came when the school's reply to a request for music lessons for her son from local mother Helen Crummy was ... \\"it takes us all our time to teach these children the 3Rs far less music.\\" Biting their tongues the frustrated mothers in Peffermill School Mothers Club responded by knocking on doors, pulling out local talent and staging a People's Festival of music, drama, and the arts. The Festival was an instant success which brought joy, colour and fun to a drab and grey environment. The festival married fun with passion for intensive political action. This led to politicians working not just for, but WITH, the local people. Combining culture with satirical criticism, the people wrote and produced their own community musicals and historical productions, basing them on the area's multitude of social concerns and issues.  Growth and development  In 1970 the Craigmillar Festival Committee gained official recognition, charitable status and changed its name to the Craigmillar Festival Society (CFS). By 1976 the Society was employing 600 people and involving 1500 volunteers. That year, 17000 people either took part or attended the annual festival. By this time, it had received a major anti-poverty research grant from The European Community. A prime example of what the CFS did in the community was through the tireless work of the Bingham neighbourhood worker Claire Elder. In 1970, she persuaded some neighbours to go dressed as a gypsy tribe to the Mediaeval Fayre. Later calling themselves the Bingham Belles, they formed a drama and music group and became stars of the Festival's Old Tyme Musical Hall. Entertaining in and beyond Craigmillar, they successfully campaigned to obtain much needed amenities for Bingham, including their own community centre and youth facilities. Several CFS workers AND volunteers who came from AND lived in the community went on to become teachers and trainers of the CFS ethic in their later lives with other organisations and even government quangoes. But they were first and foremost at the heart of the CFS activities in the community. The CFS created and developed many concepts including Communiversity, Arts As The Catalyst, Creative Shared Government, Neighbourhood Workers Scheme and the hugely influential planning document \\"The Comprehensive Plan for Action\\" where Art and culture were the catalyst in all aspects of regeneration. One of the CFS founders, Helen Crummy created an MBE in 1973 (later awarded an honorary doctorate), produced a book called \\"Let The People Sing\\" that provides an account of the background and development of the CFS.  Achievements  Many artists, politicians and researchers came to Craigmillar, either to see or become involved in the community activities. Each of these have taken the seed and rooted it worldwide, from The Easterhouse Festival Society, Notting Hill Carnival and also in the work of Neil Cameron and Reg Bolton in Australia. Craigmillar Festival Society helped create many things, amongst them; The Mermaid Sculpture by Pedro Silva; The Gentle Giant Sculpture by Jimmy Boyle; The Bill Douglas Trilogy, in particular \\"My Childhood\\" (funded by British Film Institute). The Craigmillar Festival Society was the recognised leader in the production of The Community Musical theatre productions, where professional actors worked very closely with local people. In effect, since 1962, local people came together and produced well over 100 productions. From 1973's first Community Musical \\"The Time Machine\\", 1974's \\"Castle, Cooncil & Curse, 1975's \\"Time and Motion Man\\", 1976's \\"Willie Wynn\\", 1977's Culture Vultures\\" and 1978's \\"Oh Gentle Giant\\", to the 1980s with \\"Shoo\\", \\"For A' That & A' That\\", \\"Dampbusters\\" and \\"Watch It\\", the 1990s and \\"Fit For Heroes\\", \\"Kicking Up A Stink\\" and \\"In Your Dreams\\" and the more recent \\"Grease Niddrie Style\\". All included songs such as \\"Craigmillar Now\\", \\"When People Play Their Part\\", \\"Arled Bairn\\", \\"Candy Barrie\\" and \\"He Promised Me\\". Many local people who began performing in Community productions went on to become successful professional performers, Alice Henderson and Johnni Stanton, who went on to form their own companies, but most notably, Faye Milligan (The Steamie), and James (Micky) MacPherson, whose company Plum Films won a BAFTA award. Both returned to Craigmillar and directed local productions. Craigmillar was at the forefront of the Golden Age of artistic expansion in Edinburgh in the early 70s and helped to create several lasting institutions, among them, Theatre Workshop Edinburgh. It also has links with Professor Eric Trist and The Tavistock Institute, Billy Connolly, Richard Demarco, Anne Lorne Gillies, Joan Bakewell, Michael Marra and Bill Paterson.  Commentary  The effectiveness of the Society's work began to be noticed from both near and far with distinguished commentators making reference to it. *The Social Impact of Participation in the Arts Seminar, 1997 at The House of the Art Lover, Glasgow, organised by Scottish Arts Council, chaired by Seona Reid, Director. *Donald Campbell (Cities of the imagination/Edinburgh, 2003, Signal Books) *Eric Trist (New directions of hope, 1979) *Eric Trist (QWL Quality of Working Life and the 80's (The Closing Address to the International Conference on QWL and the 80's, Harbour Castle Hilton, Toronto, 30 August ‚Äì 3 September 1981) *Rafael Ramirez (The Beauty of Social Organization, Accedo, Munich, 1991) *Alan Barnett (Community Murals, The Peoples Art, 1984, Associated University Press) *Malcolm McEwen (‚ÄòThe Other Edinburgh‚Äô, New Statesman, 18 August 1972.) *George McRobie (Small Is Possible, London: Jonathan Cape, 1981 -- this is part of the E.

In recent years The Bromley by Bow Centre has taken up The Communiversity concept to develop its education programme.  Into the future  By 2002 after a public investigation into alleged improper use of funding, funding was cut off and the remaining CFS projects were made independent organizations. Although the original CFS organization is now defunct, its spirit lives on within the community and it continues to attract attention through the \\"Arts As A Catalyst\\" Exhibition at The City Arts Centre, Edinburgh in 2004 and an award-winning documentary, which won The Saltire Award at The Edinburgh International Film Festival in 2005. The local arts scene is also kept alive by two community organisations currently existing within the community, Craigmillar Community Arts, who provide a variety of arts based projects at Craigmillar Arts Centre on Newcraighall Road and the Greater Craigmillar Archives who are devoted to recording and preserving a physical and digital record of the Craigmillar community through the years.

It was organized as seven companies of volunteers from across Massachusetts, and Mayhew's company from the 25th Continental Regiment during the later months of 1776. The regiment was assigned to the Northern Department on 9 February 1777. It was reassigned to the Highland's Department on 13 March 1777. On 12 June 1777 it was assigned to 2nd Massachusetts Brigade and three days later, 15 June 1777, it was reassigned to the 1st Massachusetts Brigade. The brigade was reassigned to the Northern Department on 1 July 1777 and the regiment was relieved from the brigade on 31 March 1778. The regiment re-organized to nine companies on 25 September 1778 and reassigned to the Northern Department on 14 June 1779. The regiment was reassigned to the New Hampshire Brigade of the main army on 23 August 1779. On 14 November 1779, the regiment was reassigned to the 3d Massachusetts Brigade in the Highland Department. On 1 January 1781, the regiment was reassigned to the 1st Massachusetts Brigade. The regiment was furloughed on 12 June 1783 at West Point, New York and disbanded on 15 November 1783. The regiment saw action at the Battles of Saratoga, the Cherry Valley massacre (in which Colonel Alden was killed and Lt. Col. William Stacy was captured), and the Sullivan Expedition.

Choke valves are generally used in naturally aspirated engines with carburetors to supply a richer fuel mixture when starting the engine. Most choke valves in engines are butterfly valves mounted in the manifold upstream from the carburetor jet to produce a higher partial vacuum, which increases the fuel draw. In heavy industrial or fluid engineering contexts, a choke valve is a particular design of valve with a solid cylinder placed inside another slotted cylinder.  Carburetor  Cross-sectional schematic of a basic carburetor, showing the choke valve at top A choke valve is sometimes installed in the carburetor of internal combustion engines. Its purpose is to restrict the flow of air, thereby enriching the fuel-air mixture while starting the engine. Depending on engine design and application, the valve can be activated manually by the operator of the engine (via a lever or pull handle) or automatically by a temperature-sensitive mechanism called an autochoke. Choke valves are important for naturally-aspirated gasoline engines because small droplets of gasoline do not evaporate well within a cold engine. By restricting the flow of air into the throat of the carburetor, the choke valve reduces the pressure inside the throat, which causes a proportionally- greater amount of fuel to be pushed from the main jet into the combustion chamber during cold-running operation. Once the engine is warm (from combustion), opening the choke valve restores the carburetor to normal operation, supplying fuel and air in the correct stoichiometric ratio for clean, efficient combustion. The choke pull handle in a Hyundai Excel Note that the term \\"choke\\" is applied to the carburetor's enrichment device even when it works by a totally different method. Commonly, SU carburetors have \\"chokes\\" that work by lowering the fuel jet to a narrower part of the needle. Some others work by introducing an additional fuel route to the constant depression chamber. Chokes were nearly universal in automobiles until fuel injection began to supplant carburetors. Choke valves are still common in other internal-combustion applications, including most small portable engines, motorcycles, small propeller-driven airplanes, riding lawn mowers, and normally-aspirated marine engines.  Industrial  In heavy industrial or fluid engineering contexts, a choke valve is a particular design of valve that raises and lowers a solid cylinder (called a \\"plug\\" or \\"stem\\") which is placed around or inside another cylinder that has holes or slots. The design of a choke valve means fluids flowing through the cage are coming from all sides and that the streams of flow (through the holes or slots) collide with each other at the center of the cage cylinder, thereby dissipating the energy of the fluid through \\"flow impingement\\". The main advantage of choke valves is that they can be designed to have a totally linear relationship between the flow rate and the position of the valve. Heavy-duty industrial choke valves control the flow to a certain flow coefficient (Cv), which is determined by how far the valve is opened. They are regularly used in the oil industry. For highly-erosive and corrosive fluids, they are often made of tungsten carbide or inconel.

It means a very high degree of probability, sufficient for action, but short of absolute or mathematical certainty. Origins The notion of different degrees of certainty can be traced back to a statement in Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics that one must be content with the kind of certainty appropriate to different subject matters, so that in practical decisions one cannot expect the certainty of mathematics. Aristotle, Ethics 1094b (I.3), 1098a (I.7), 1104a (II.2), 1165a IX.2). The Latin phrase moralis certitudo was first used by the French philosopher Jean Gerson about 1400,H. E. Braun/E. Vallance eds., The Renaissance Conscience (2011) p. 19 to provide a basis for moral action that could (if necessary) be less exact than Aristotelian practical knowledge, thus avoiding the dangers of philosophical scepticism and opening the way for a benevolent casuistry.Braun, p. 12 and p. 19 The Oxford English Dictionary mentions occurrences in English from 1637. Law In law, moral (or 'virtual') certainty has been associated with verdicts based on certainty beyond a reasonable doubt.Legal definition of \\"moral certainty\\" Moral certainty, a quantum of evidence of about 100 percent proof, is required in two kinds of cases: # In a criminal prosecution, when no direct evidence exists, the circumstantial evidence must be morally certain; see Lizzie Borden. # In a paternity testing case, when a putative father has been adjudicated to be the actual father by clear and convincing evidence, then moral certainty is required to disprove paternity, the onus being moved to the newly found father. Legal debate about instructions to seek a moral certainty has turned on the changing definitions of the phrase over time. Whereas it can be understood as an equivalent to 'beyond reasonable doubt', in another sense moral certainty refers to a firm conviction which does not correlate but rather opposes evidentiary certainty:R. L. Moore, Mass Communication Law and Ethics (1999) pp. 52‚Äì3 i.e. one may have a firm subjective gut feeling of guilt ‚Äì a feeling of moral certainty ‚Äì without the evidence necessarily justifying a guilty conviction.

This enzyme is important for the effective use of biotin, a B vitamin found in foods such as liver, egg yolks, and milk. In many of the body's tissues, holocarboxylase synthetase activates other specific enzymes (called biotin-dependent carboxylases) by attaching biotin to them. These carboxylases are involved in many critical cellular functions, including the production and breakdown of proteins, fats, and carbohydrates. The catalyzed reaction: :ATP + biotin + apo-propionyl-CoA:carbon-dioxide ligase (ADP-forming) \\\\rightleftharpoons AMP + diphosphate + propionyl-CoA:carbon-dioxide ligase (ADP-forming) The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP, biotin, and apo-[propionyl-CoA:carbon- dioxide ligase (ADP-forming), whereas its 3 products are AMP, diphosphate, and propionyl-CoA:carbon-dioxide ligase (ADP-forming). Holocarboxylase synthetase may also play a role in regulating the activity of genes. In the nucleus, the enzyme likely attaches biotin molecules to histones, which are structural proteins that bind to DNA and give chromosomes their shape. Changing the shape of histones may help determine whether certain genes are turned on or off; however, it is not known how adding biotin affects gene regulation. The HLCS gene is located on the long (q) arm of chromosome 21 at position 22.1, from base pair 37,045,059 to base pair 37,284,372.  Related conditions  Holocarboxylase synthetase deficiency: About 30 mutations in the HLCS gene have been identified in people with holocarboxylase synthetase deficiency. Most of these mutations substitute one amino acid (a building block of proteins) for another amino acid in the holocarboxylase synthetase enzyme. Many of the known mutations occur in a region of the enzyme that binds to biotin. These mutations reduce the enzyme's ability to attach biotin to carboxylases and histones. Without biotin, carboxylases remain inactive and are unable to process proteins, fats, and carbohydrates. A lack of holocarboxylase synthetase activity may also alter the regulation of certain genes that are important for normal development. Researchers believe that these disruptions in important cellular functions lead to breathing problems, skin rashes, and the other characteristic signs and symptoms of holocarboxylase synthetase deficiency.

Because of his Arian faith, Auxentius is considered by the Catholic Church as an intruder and he is not included in the Catholic lists of the bishops of Milan such as that engraved in the Cathedral of Milan. Auxentius came to be regarded as the great opponent of the Nicene Creed in the West. His theological doctrines were attacked by Hilary of Poitiers, whose Liber contra Auxentium remains the chief source of information about him. Life Auxentius was a native of Cappadocia, and he was ordained as a priest in 343 by Gregory of Cappadocia, the Arian Bishop of Alexandria. According to his opponent Athanasius of Alexandria, Auxentius was \\"even ignorant of the Latin language, and unskilful in everything except impiety\\". The historical period in which Auxentius lived was marked by the fight between the Arians and the supporters of the faith of the Council of Nicaea. In 355 the Roman Emperor Constantius II convened a Synod in Milan, in which the bishop of Milan Dionysius, along with Eusebius of Vercelli and Lucifer of Cagliari, opposed to the Arian leanings of the Emperor. This resulted in the exile of the three bishops, including Dionysius. Shortly later the Arian bishops, with the support of the Emperor, appointed as new bishop of Milan the Arian Auxentius. In 359 Auxentius played a relevant role in the Council of Rimini which supported the Semi-Arian doctrines stated in the Second Council of Sirmium in 351. Auxentius was left undisturbed in his diocese after Constantius' death by the pagan Emperor Julian (died 363). Under the following Christian Emperors, Jovian and Valentinian I, there were many attempts by the supporters of the Nicaean faith to depose Auxentius. In 364 Auxentius was publicly accused in a disputation with Hilary of Poitiers held in Milan by order of the Emperor Valentinian I. His submission was only apparent, however, and he remained powerful enough to compel the departure of Hilary from Milan. Also Eusebius of Vercelli and Athanasius of Alexandria failed to obtain the deposition of Auxentius. In 372 Pope Damasus I summoned a synod which explicitly condemned Auxentius as heretic. However, Auxentius remained in Milan until his death in 374, even if the Nicaean priest Philastrius (later bishop of Brescia) operated in Milan in supporting the Catholic population. Auxentius was succeeded by the Nicaean Ambrose.

They are considered pioneers of mathcore and were known for its aggressive style of music and reckless live shows. The band broke up in 2010 and has performed two reunion shows since then. History=Formation and early years (1994-1996) Before forming Coalesce, guitarist Jes Steineger and bassist Stacy Hilt were members of the Krishnacore band Amara, Jim Redd was the drummer of the alternative metal band Loathe, and Sean Ingram was the frontman of the straight edge band Restrain, all from Kansas City, Missouri. Both Amara and Restrain performed several times together and were friends. Ingram, who was a big fan of Earth Crisis and the burgeoning vegan straight edge scene, relocated to Syracuse, New York on Christmas Day, 1993. For their part, Steineger and Hilt wanted to establish a new band and had numerous attempts looking for a drummer, and after locating Jim Redd during a show, they were impressed by his musical ability and together formed Breach in January 1994. Disillusioned by the militant attitude of the Syracuse scene, Ingram went back to Kansas around Easter 1994 and almost immediately auditioned for Breach, writing the lyrics for \\"Harvest of Maturity\\" and being accepted to join them. The band changed their name to Coalesce to avoid confusion with a Swedish band of the same name. The U.K. division of Earache Records was impressed by Coalesce's demo and invited them to record an EP for Earache's 7\\" series imprint, New Chapter. The EP, titled 002, was recorded in one day and released in 1995. 002 marked the beginning of Coalesce's relationship with Red House Studios and producer Ed Rose, who would record all of Coalesce's following material. In the summer of 1995, Coalesce embarked on their first U.S. tour to promote 002. They supported the bands Bloodlet and 108. The tour served as a cause of Coalesce's first break-up, as the clashing of personalities had amplified between vocalist Sean Ingram and drummer Jim Redd while on the road. Once Coalesce returned home from the road, Redd convinced the other bandmates to oust Ingram from the band. Sean showed up at band practice to find that James Dewees was auditioning for vocalist. Ingram engaged in a confrontation with drummer Redd, resulting in Coalesce disbanding altogether in March 1996. In July 1996, guitarist Jes Steineger called Ingram and the two decided to reform the band. Stacy Hilt was included as bassist in the reunion, and included James Dewees as drummer, the same person who had attempted to secure the available vocalist position before Coalesce had broken up; drummer Jim Redd decided not to rejoin the band again because he was attending the University of Maryland in Baltimore, Maryland. This incarnation of the band dusted off some older material and revised it so they could release it on the records A Safe Place 7\\" on Edison Recordings and the Earache-distributed split EP with grind veterans Napalm Death, entitled In Tongues We Speak. Give Them Rope and Functioning on Impatience (1997-1998) In 1997, Coalesce wrote and recorded their first full length, Give Them Rope (released on Edison Recordings), as well as songs for several compilations and split 7\\" records with The Get Up Kids, Today is the Day, and Converge. After weeks of performing new material on tour, including a violent show in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, the work began on what would become Functioning on Impatience, but Stacy Hilt's increasing exhaustion due to their aggressive performances led to him quitting the band. After Hilt left the band he was replaced by Nathan Ellis, a guitarist willing to switch to the bass to join one of his favorite bands. Coalesce entered Red House Studios in the spring of 1998 to record the album Functioning on Impatience in three days. Shortly after, Coalesce recorded songs for a split 7\\" with Boy Sets Fire. Both the full- length and the split record were released that summer. Coalesce again entered Red House to record There is Nothing New Under the Sun, a one-off release on Hydra Head of Led Zeppelin covers, which was released in late 1998. Coalesce attempted a US tour in support of this record, managing to play the east coast dates with Neurosis, Nile and The Dillinger Escape Plan, but the tour ended abruptly as unresolvable problems with their touring van brought tensions to a head and rendered Coalesce unable to complete the tour. They discarded the van, returned home in a U-Haul and subsequently disbanded once more. 0:12 Revolution in Just Listening, hiatus and return to touring (1999-2004) After Steineger stopped being part of the Hare Krishna movement, Coalesce was offered to work with the Christian label Solid State Records, but they ultimately declined it because of their volatile nature. Afterward, they signed with Relapse Records and the members recorded their next album, 0:12 Revolution in Just Listening, in separate sessions from each other. A lineup impervious to breaking up was something that would always elude Coalesce. The usual cause for a Coalesce breakup was either standard in house feuding between band members, lack of money, or intermittent bouts of leaving and rejoining Coalesce due to religious reasons. Coalesce reformed in 2002 sans Jes Steineger, replacing him with The Esoteric guitarist, Cory White, for a national tour and short recordings. Ox and second hiatus (2005-present) In August 2005, Coalesce was scheduled to play Hellfest in Trenton, New Jersey with original guitarist Jes Steineger and a new drummer, Nathan Richardson, but legal problems prevented the festival from taking place. Having already made travel arrangements, the band performed shows at two smaller venues in Philadelphia and in the Wilkes-Barre area. The band played what they advertised as their 'final show' in Lawrence, Kansas in September 2005. During the Philadelphia and Lawrence reunion shows lead singer Sean Ingram announced that the band was going to begin writing new music under a new moniker, but this idea was abandoned. On January 3, 2007 lead singer Sean Ingram announced on his personal blog website that Coalesce had recorded 2 new songs on December 28 and 29 at Black Lodge Studios. The songs would be on an upcoming final 7\\" to be self-released by the band along with a DVD and book in 2007. On February 9, 2007 Coalesce announced, via MySpace, that they intended to do some touring in August 2007. Possible areas included Europe, Japan and the United States (East Coast). On March 21, 2007 Ingram announced on the Coalesce website that the release would be titled Salt and Passage. The tracks would be titled \\"Son of Son of Man\\" and \\"I Am This\\". It was also said that re-recording of the vocal tracks for There is Nothing New Under the Sun were completed for the re-release through Hydra Head Records. On May 26, 2007 on the official website announcements were made in regards to the upcoming 7\\" and DVD. Instead of releasing them together they would be released separately. The 7\\" to be released in a hand screened gatefold cover with limited different colors on September 11, 2007. The DVD will be a collection of as many complete shows that they could get and it is entitled No Business in this Business. The DVD was released in late August to early September. Coalesce's latest full-length record Ox features 14 songs and was released on June 9, 2009 (North America) and June 15 (international) on Relapse Records. The band has completed a two- week headlining tour of Europe in support of Ox. Furthermore, the band has released a follow-up EP titled OXEP that features seven songs and was released November 10. On June 18, 2010, Coalesce announced they would be taking a break from making music to focus on their personal lives. Coalesce reunited at Krazy Fest 2011‚Äîa three-day music festival in Louisville, Kentucky in May 2011. On October 20, 2012 Coalesce played with Converge, Torche and Kvelertak at Granada Theatre in Lawrence, Kansas. Artistry=Musical style Coalesce's music is characterized by odd time signatures, abrasive vocals, sudden changes and angular-dissonant guitars. Usually, they also include free- form noise sections, and drastically different guitar and bass parts performed all together. They are often described as mathcore and metalcore. Most of Coalesce instrumentals and creative direction were started by Jes Steineger, while Sean Ingram wrote all the lyrics and song titles. Coalesce' style originated after Steineger was startled by the technical proficiency of drummer Jim Redd during their first rehearsal, which got him \\"so scared and finally concluded that now was the time to step up\\". Through jam sessions, they challenged each other to write heavier and more complex music, with Redd later stating that he wanted the band to be \\"Tool... heavy guitars, heavy drums, wacky time signatures, and loud/quiet dynamics\\", but \\"with none of the quiet parts\\". Among the band's initial influences were Earth Crisis, Tool, The Jesus Lizard and Tortoise. Other main inspirations included Ritual Device, Pantera, Fugazi, Crawlpappy, Helmet and Dazzling Killmen. While their early work drew mainly on chromatic scales and disjointed structures, they began incorporating pentatonic scales and 1970s hard rock grooves since their 1999 cover album There is Nothing New Under the Sun. On 2009's Ox and OXEP, Steineger and Nathan Ellis were immersed in Americana music and Spaghetti Western films, and, while maintaining their original style, they included more between-song dynamics, clean singing and yowls. For these albums they acknowledged, among others, Gillian Welch, Nickel Creek, Bill Monroe, the Stanley Brothers and Stevie Ray Vaughan as influences, as well as the soundtracks of O Brother, Where Art Thou? and Deadwood. Vocals and lyrics Vocalist Sean Ingram's original style consisted in high-pitched throat screaming. During their first tours, he learned to use his diaphragm to produce a lower and more powerful vocal delivery, which he started recording since the split EP In Tongues We Speak. Ingram's lyrics deal with complicated family and intimate relationships, his experiences with death, tragic news stories and cynicism towards the straight edge, hardline and Hare Krishna ideologies which were prominent at the time. These are usually written from the perspective of an essayist rather than a diarist or poet. Although the lyrics were initially about his own life and disillusionments, the 1990s hardcore punk scene was highly politicized and some people felt personally attacked, especially members of the militant straight edge branches who even send death threats to him and the band. In 2000, Ingram cited Phil Anselmo and Karl Buechner as his biggest vocal influences, and Lisa Loeb and Maynard James Keenan as the lyrical ones. After their 2005 reunion, he acknowledged Sufjan Stevens' personal approach to songwriting as his main inspiration.  Live performances  Coalesce's live performances were known for their dangerous and volatile nature. The band destroyed their gear and typically ended their shows throwing it all over the stage, and when fights broke out they kept playing. During Coalesce's first tours, Steineger and Hilt played with Hindu clothes. The former had the most erratic behaviors, thrusting his guitar without a pick to play it and masturbating at the end of some performances. Some attendants, especially straight edge people, tried to attack and start arguments with the band members because of their lyrics, particularly with Ingram. Legacy Coalesce is often considered pioneer of mathcore and one of its most influential bands. Many artists have cited Coalesce as an influence or have expressed their admiration for them, including Norma Jean, Josh Scogin, Every Time I Die, Frank Iero of My Chemical Romance, Ben Weinman of The Dillinger Escape Plan, Tim McIlrath of Rise Against, Cult of Luna, James Hart of Eighteen Visions, Don Clark of Demon Hunter and Training for Utopia, The Ocean, Greg Kubacki of Car Bomb, Knut, Rob Fusco of Most Precious Blood, War from a Harlots Mouth, Chris Tzompanakis of Skycamefalling and Curran Reynolds of Today Is the Day.

The trains were built by GEC Alsthom- Metro-Cammell and entered service in 1997. They are similar to the 1995 Stock used on the Northern line. The original 59 trains were initially built as 6-car trains. In 2005 an additional trailer car was added to lengthen each train to 7-cars and four additional 7-car trains delivered, bringing the total to 63 7-car trains. History The 1996 stock was ordered for the opening of the Jubilee Line Extension (JLE) from Green Park to Stratford. The original plan was to heavily refurbish the original 1983 stock with similar exteriors and interiors to the 1996 stock, and replace the single-leaf doors with double doors, but this proved too expensive and was abandoned. Delays in the construction of the JLE meant that the 1996 stock entered service on the existing Jubilee line, replacing the 1983 stock, well before the JLE was opened. The first train was delivered in July 1996, entering service on 24 December 1997, with the final train entering service on 31 July 2001, although it was several months later than the rest of the fleet had entered service.Underground stock arrives Railway Gazette International August 1996 page 472 The development of the 1995 stock and the 1996 stock were conducted in parallel. Detailed design was done by Alstom at its Washwood Heath and Rugby facilities, and the first six train sets were manufactured at Alstom's Barcelona factory to the 1996 stock design. All type approvals were conducted on these early train sets. The 1995 stock was produced in the Barcelona factory afterwards, and the balance of the 1996 stock followed. Final assembly and equipping was at Alstom's facility at Washwood Heath on adjacent production lines. Overview The 1996 Stock has an identical exterior car body to the 1995 Stock, but the two rolling stocks have different interiors, seating layouts and cabs (designed by Warwick Design Consultants), traction packages and train management systems, and slight differences in tripcock geometry. 1995 Stock uses LED body-side lights, 1996 Stock filament bulbs. The most apparent difference is the bogie: 1996 Stock uses an Alstom bogie with a rubber suspension, 1995 Stock has AdTranz bogies with air suspension to cope with the arduous track conditions of the underground portions of the Northern line. The main technical differences arose because 1996 Stock was designed for \\"cheapest first cost\\", while 1995 Stock was designed for \\"life cycle cost\\", as Alstom had won the contract to act as the service provider and maintainer of this stock. Alstom subsequently won the maintenance contract for 1996 Stock, to be carried out at the new Stratford Market Depot in East London. The 1996 Stock was delivered as six-car trains, with two three-car units coupled together, each consisting of a Driving Motor car [DM], a Trailer car [T] and an Uncoupling Non-Driving Motor car [UNDM]. The standard train formation was . Twelve later trailer cars had de-icing equipment; these are referred to as De- Icing Trailer cars [DIT]. The cars are odd-numbered at one end of the train, even numbers at the other. Each number has five digits: the first two are the stock type (96); the third refers to the car type: 0 or 1 for DM, 2 or 3 for T, 4 or 5 for UNDM, 6 or 7 for ST (special trailers added in 2005) and 8 or 9 for DIT. Thus, for example, a six-car train set would be 96001, 96201, 96401, 96402, 96202, 96002.  Traction control  1995 and 1996 stock trains have the same body shell design, but they use different AC traction control systems. The 1995 stock system is more modern, since the 1996 stock design specification was 'frozen' in 1991. 1996 stock trains use three-phase induction motors fed from a single-source inverter using a GTO (gate-turn-off) thyristor derived from those on Class 465 Networker trains, whereas the 1995 stock uses Alstom's \\"Onix\\" three-phase Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor (IGBT) drive. Earlier stock, like most electric trains manufactured before the 1990s, used DC motors. These are now regarded as inefficient, partly because they are traditionally controlled by resistors, and partly because a 3-phase AC induction motor can provide higher specific power and volumetric power density. The carbon brushes and commutator of a DC motor can easily wear down over time and need regular maintenance, whereas an induction machine does not. In an AC motor supplied by a fixed-frequency supply, maximum torque can only be achieved when the resistance of the rotor windings is equal to their reactance. AC motors in an industrial setting are normally operated at approximately constant speed, so if a wound-rotor machine is employed large banks of resistors can be used on start-up to raise resistance and maintain torque. This would be inefficient in a small motor designed for stop-start operation. Thus it was only the adoption of electronic control systems from the 1980s that made AC traction viable for trains. The motor can be supplied using an inverter, and by varying the inverter's output frequency it is possible to keep the frequency of the current in the rotor windings, and hence the reactance, constant. (The reactance depends on frequency, whereas the resistance is fixed.) The GTO thyristor achieves this by \\"chopping\\" the supply voltage in order to drive a sinusoidal current in the motor windings (pulse width modulation), creating the characteristic whine associated with the stock and with the Class 465 Networker trains that share its traction drive system. The sound changes as the pulse length changes. The noise is produced by the switching frequency current ripple and the resulting torque pulsation experienced by the rotor of the induction machine. More modern AC traction, such as on 1995 stock, uses an IGBT (which is essentially a combination of the MOSFET and BJT), which can operate at much higher switching frequencies than the GTO. The whining sound is far less noticeable because of the higher switching frequency of IGBT drives. Addition of seventh car In early 2005, as part of a capacity upgrade to the Jubilee line, 87 additional carriages were ordered. A seventh car was added to each of the existing 59 sets, and four new seven-carriage sets were built. The original factory on the Barcelona sea front had been closed, and the new stock was manufactured in Alstom's new factory at Santa Perp√®tua de Mogoda in the Barcelona suburbs. The four new trains were built as six-car trains and modified to seven-car configuration at Stratford Market Depot.Jubilee Line trains to come from Barcelona in ¬£150m Alstom deal Rail issue 493 4 August 2004 page 12Jubilee Line Tube trains to be built in Spain The Railway Magazine issue 1242 October 2004 page 9 From 25 December 2005, the line was closed for completion of the conversion to seven cars, including signalling alterations and software modification to the platform-edge doors. The original plan was to hard-wire two cars together so that the onboard computer would \\"see\\" them as one car, but this proved unnecessary. Since the 1996 Stock had been future-proofed, being designed as six-car sets with the ability to add a seventh car, the platforms were already long enough for seven-car trains and the platform-edge doors at the 1999 extension stations had been built with space for a seventh car. The line was scheduled to close for five days, but the work was completed ahead of schedule and the line reopened two days early. The new car is a trailer car in the \\"odd\\" unit, with design designation \\"G\\". An example of a seven-car train set would be 96117, 96317, 96717, 96517, 96518, 96318, 96118 (the seventh car in bold.) There were various differences between the new and old cars at the time of introduction: * Amber passenger information displays (PIDs) instead of red, similar to the displays on the 1995 Stock * Black vestibule floor instead of grey * Yellow strip on door seal * Better fitted seat covers * The ridged vestibule floor extends for the full width of the car Following refurbishment, many of these differences are no longer visible. The new cars are numbered 96601 to 96725 (odd numbers only). The step-plate on the new cars reads \\"Alstom 1996\\" for continuity reasons, but they feature the newer Alstom logo instead of the original GEC-Alsthom. Upgrades and refurbishment alt= The trains were originally delivered with seats with a mauve and grey moquette. They formed the letter J for Jubilee (the Northern line's moquette formed the letter N). This was replaced in November 2005 with the new dark blue Tube Lines moquette with multi-coloured and multi-size hollow squares, introduced at the same time on the 1973 and 1995 stock. At the same time, the purple armrests were repainted blue to match the new seats. From April 2012, all units received a refresh, with the new Barman moquette being introduced on all units, prior to the 2012 Olympics. From 2014 onwards, the external LCD destination displays were replaced with LED units. The new units use orange text, instead of the original yellow. Starting in 2017, the 1996 stock underwent refurbishment, some 20 years after first being introduced. New flooring was fitted, with contrasting colours and grooves in the doorways. All grab rails were repainted Jubilee line silver, and new wheelchair backboards were provided in some trailer cars. The interior turquoise blue panels were also repainted white. The external door open/close buttons were also plated over. The first refurbished train entered service on 23 February 2017, and the last one entered service in December 2019.https://www.squarewheels.org.uk/rly/stock/1996tubeStock/#midlife All trains have now been refurbished. Automatic train operation It had been intended to open the Jubilee Line Extension with an Automatic train operation system, however delays and technical difficulties meant that a conventional signalling system was hastily installed, and until 2011 the trains were always driven manually by the driver using a dead man's handle, also known as the Traction-Brake controller. Eventually, from 2009 a new signalling system was installed by Thales, called SelTrac. Also known as Transmission-based train control, it allows the trains to be operated automatically, with the driver only responsible for opening and closing the doors, and initiating departure. The system uses inductive track loops, placed between the running rails, to communicate with the train In order to operate with the new signalling system, all 1996 stock underwent modification, which included the installation of two Vehicle On Board Controllers (VOBC), and a new Train Operators Display (TOD) in the cab. From the beginning of January 2011, ATO was introduced on a gradual basis, and since 26 June 2011, the line has been operated entirely under ATO. As a result, the peak service frequency was increased to 27 trains per hour in July 2011, and it has since been increased further to 30 trains per hour.

It is owned by Entercom and airs a soft adult contemporary radio format. The station's offices and studios are located on American Drive in Southfield. The transmitter is located near Lyndon Street at Cloverdale Street in the City of Detroit.Radio-Locator.com/WDZH WDZH broadcasts with an effective radiated power (ERP) of 50,000 watts from an antenna at 463 feet in height above average terrain (HAAT). History=WBFG (1961‚Äì1980)  The station signed on the air in 1961 as WBFG (\\"We Broadcast For God\\").Broadcasting Yearbook 1963 page B-90 The station broadcast religious programming for nearly two decades and was owned by the Trinity Broadcasting Corporation (not connected with the current-day Trinity Broadcasting Network). Studios were located on Lyndon Avenue. The station sold segments of time to local and national religious leaders, who presented religious instruction and also sought donations on the air to support their ministry. WLLZ, Detroit's Wheels (1980‚Äì1995) On July 16, 1980, WBFG was sold to Doubleday, which owned a number of radio stations around the U.S. in addition to its large publishing business. Doubleday soon changed the call sign to WLLZ.Broadcasting Yearbook 1982 page C-117 The call letters stood for \\"Detroit's WheeLLZ,\\" since Detroit is the home of the American auto industry. On August 11, 1980, at 5:07 p.m., WLLZ debuted a new AOR/CHR format. The first song played on the new \\"Detroit's Wheels\\" was \\"Let It Rock\\" by Bob Seger. The new WLLZ became an instant hit. \\"Wheels\\" had one of the most successful premieres in Detroit radio history. It debuted at #2 (behind only WJR) in total persons 12+ in the Fall 1980 Arbitron ratings for Detroit radio. It also posted #1 ratings in the teen, 18-34 and 18-49 listener demographics. Detroit's other rockers were hit hard, particularly 106.7 WWWW (W4), which, having been a top 10-rated station just a year earlier (and had ranked as high as #2 in the spring 1979 ratings), had tumbled completely out of the top 20 by the fall of 1980. In January 1981, just days after the fall Arbiton ratings were released, W4 changed formats from rock to country music, and terminated morning man Howard Stern, whose show had been crushed by his WLLZ competition of John Larson and Jeff Young. The rock format on WABX also was switched for a Top 40/CHR format in 1982, leaving WLLZ and WRIF to go head-to-head in the AOR format for the rest of the 1980s and into the early 1990s, with WLLZ occasionally beating the heritage rocker in the 12+ ratings. In an Ann Arbor News article in 1987, Michael Solon, the station's general manager at the time of the rock format's launch, credited WLLZ's success to the perception that the station featured less chatter and took a more mass-appeal, hit-oriented approach to its rock music than competing stations: \\"It was a wonderful time, making such a splash with an all-new station. I was no genius. I just figured that if the other stations were awfully chatty and going four songs deep on albums, we would do well by playing album-music hits.\\" In April 1986, Legacy Broadcasting bought WLLZ. In 1988, WLLZ also introduced the nation's first weekly sports talk show on an FM rock and roll station, \\"The Sunday Sports Albom\\", hosted by Mitch Albom. In December 1989, Westinghouse Broadcasting bought the station. (Westinghouse was merged into CBS in 1995, with the radio division being renamed Infinity Broadcasting in 1997.)http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC- YB/1991/B-Radio-AL-MT-1991-B&W.pdf; WLLZ saw its fortunes slip in the early 1990s with the emergence of \\"alternative rock\\" groups like Nirvana and Pearl Jam, which drove many of the 1980s \\"hair bands\\" off the charts. A format tweak from AOR to modern rock in June 1995 (which put the station in competition with 89X and The Planet 96.3) failed to reverse the station's dropping ratings. Smooth Jazz V98.7 (1995‚Äì2009) On December 20, 1995, at 10 a.m., after playing Led Zeppelin's \\"Stairway To Heaven\\", WLLZ flipped to Smooth Jazz as \\"V98.7\\". The format was introduced by musician Kenny G, followed by the first song: \\"Smooth Operator\\" by Sade.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1996/R&R-1996-01-05.pdf; The WVMV call letters were adopted on February 16, 1996. V98.7 logo 2002-2009 The flip put the station in competition with the similarly formatted WJZZ, until the latter flipped to urban in August 1996. In December 2005, WVMV's parent company, Infinity Broadcasting, was renamed CBS Radio. 98-7 AMP Radio (2009‚Äì2018) AMP Logo 2009-2013 AMP logo, 2013-2018 At 5 p.m. on October 2, 2009, after almost fifteen years as a smooth jazz station, \\"V98.7\\" signed off with the first song the station played in December 1995, \\"Smooth Operator\\" by Sade. The station then briefly stunted by playing a montage of jingles and airchecks of WLLZ, claiming that \\"Detroit's Wheelz\\" was back on the air, following up by playing \\"Welcome To The Jungle\\" by Guns N' Roses. Halfway through the song, it was interrupted by the audio of Kanye West's famous \\"Imma let you finish\\" scene from the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards (with new station voiceover announcer Dr. Dave Ferguson responding by saying \\"Uh, OK. Then we'll play Beyonc√©.\\"), followed by Beyonc√©'s \\"Sweet Dreams\\", and officially flipped to Top 40. Instead of revealing the name of the new format, WVMV was branded for that weekend as \\"98-7 Takeover,\\" inviting listeners to register online and guess what the name of the new station was going to be. The winner of the contest would be awarded $1,000, and the real name would be revealed at 8 a.m. the following Monday, October 5. At that time, the station officially launched as \\"98-7 AMP Radio\\", modeled after sister stations KAMP-FM in Los Angeles, and WBMP in New York City. Unlike those two stations, WVMV did not start with 10,000 songs commercial free, instead offering commercial-free Mondays, which were discontinued in April 2011. The station adopted the WDZH call sign on May 3, 2010. The \\"AMP Radio\\" format featured a tight rotation of mainly current hits, similar to Mike Joseph's Hot Hits formatted stations of the late 1970s and early 1980s, which had been heard locally on WHYT. On February 2, 2017, CBS Radio announced it would merge with Entercom. The merger was approved on November 9, 2017, and was consummated on the 17th. 98.7 The Breeze (2018‚Äìpresent) Shortly after 5:00 p.m. on November 9, 2018, WDZH began stunting with Christmas music as The Rudolph Network at 98.7. However, at 5:00 p.m. on November 12, the station flipped to a soft adult contemporary format as 98.7 The Breeze, launching with a commercial-free marathon of 10,000 songs. The station competes primarily with iHeartMedia's mainstream AC WNIC. Beginning in 2019, WDZH has carried Christmas music for the holiday season, replacing sister station WOMC as Entercom's home for the programming within its Detroit cluster. As with its main format, the Christmas programming competes primarily with WNIC, which has historically been known for the format in Detroit.

It is commonly used to resolve cases where full prosecution is not seen as the most appropriate solution. Accepting a caution requires an admission of guilt. Purpose A police caution (since 2005 more properly known as a simple caution) is a formal warning given by the police to anyone aged 10 years or over who has admitted that they are guilty of a minor crime. A person may refuse to admit guilt and not accept a caution, but can then be subject to criminal prosecution. A police caution as a non-statutory disposal of an offence is quite different from the caution used for the purpose of advising a suspect of their right to silence.A police caution administered to a suspect upon arrest or prior to questioning them about their involvement in a suspected offence may be phrased as: \\"You do not have to say anything but it may harm your defence if you do not mention, when questioned, something which you later rely on in court. Anything you do say may be given in evidence.\\" The aims of the formal police caution are: # to offer a proportionate response to low-level offending where the offender has admitted the offence; # to deliver swift, simple and effective justice that carries a deterrent effect; # to record an individual's criminal conduct for possible reference in future criminal proceedings or in criminal record or other similar checks; # to reduce the likelihood of re-offending; # to increase the amount of time officers spend dealing with more serious crime and reduce the amount of time police officers spend completing paperwork and attending court, whilst simultaneously reducing the burden on the courts. Types of cautions As a result of changes made by the Criminal Justice Act 2003, cautions can be administered in two forms: as a simple caution or as a conditional caution, the latter of which has specific conditions attached that the offender must satisfy‚Äîattending a course aimed at targeting offending behaviour, for example. The Home Office has released guidance to the police and prosecutors on the use of the simple caution.Home Office Circular Simple Cautioning of Adult Offenders Although a caution is not a conviction, it forms a part of a person's criminal record and can be used as evidence of bad character if a person is prosecuted for another crime, and Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) checks (previously called Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) checks) for certain types of employment. A caution can cause some countries not to allow a person to visit or reside in the country. Circumstances for use In order to safeguard the offender's interests, the following conditions must be met before a caution can be administered: :* there must be reasonable suspicion to believe an offence has been committed :* the offender must admit that they are guilty of the offence :* the offender must understand the significance of a caution and give informed consent to being cautioned. Where the available evidence does not meet the standard normally required to bring a prosecution, a caution cannot be administered. A caution will not be appropriate where a person does not make a clear and reliable admission of the offence (for example if intent is denied or there are doubts about their mental health or intellectual capacity). Cautions are typically administered in the case of an offence that is triable summarily or either-way.Guidance to Police Officers and Crown Prosecutors Issued by the Director of Public Prosecutions , section 9.1 \\"Where the police consider that the Threshold Test is met in a case, other than an indictable only offence, and determine that it is in the public interest instead to administer a simple caution, or to administer a reprimand or final warning in the case of a youth, the police may issue that caution, reprimand or final warning as appropriate, without referring the case to a Crown Prosecutor.\\" The Ministry of Justice recommends that the decision to offer a simple caution for the most serious of offences (an indictable only offence, an either-way offence routinely dealt with at the Crown Court or any offence which the sentencing guidelines indicate has a starting point at high level community order or sentence of imprisonment) is taken only in exceptional circumstances. People aged 17 or under may receive a youth caution where the following conditions are met: :* there must be evidence that the offender has committed an offence; :* the quality of the evidence must be sufficient to give a realistic prospect of conviction; :* the offender must admit the offence; :* the offender must have no previous convictions; :* a prosecution of the offence would not be in the public interest. On 13 April 2015, the Criminal Justice and Courts Act 2015 implemented restrictions on the use of cautions by the police:CJCA 2015, s. 17 :* for indictable offences, they may be used only in exceptional circumstances, and then only with the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions; :* for specified either-way offences, only \\"in exceptional circumstances relating to the person or the offence;\\" :* for summary offences and all other either-way offences, where a person has been convicted or cautioned in the previous two years for a similar offence, only \\"in exceptional circumstances relating to the person, the offence admitted or the previous offence;\\" and :* only a police officer at or above a minimum rank specified by order may determine where exceptional circumstances and similar offences exist. Administration There is no statutory basis for the formal caution, it is a discretionary procedure adopted by the police under Home Office guidance. Only the police have the power to administer a caution. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) does, however, have a role to play in helping the police to ensure that the Ministry of Justice guidelines contained within the Guidance are applied consistently and fairly. CPS officers are instructed to refer to the police any case in which they consider a caution is the appropriate way of handling the offence. Where the CPS remains satisfied that a caution is appropriate but the police refuse to administer one, the CPS guidance recommends that the case is not accepted for the prosecution. Duration Per the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974, simple cautions, reprimands and final warnings become spent (meaning that they do not need to be disclosed, unless applying for particular types of work) immediately, and conditional cautions become spent after 3 months.What is the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974? Cautions will appear on a DBS certificate until 6 years have passed (or 2 years if the person was under 18 at the time of caution) provided the offence is not on the prescribed list of offences that will never be filtered from a criminal record check. All information relating to simple cautions (as well as convictions) issued for a recordable offence is retained on the Police National Computer (PNC). Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) guidelines set out how long this information will be retained for. The information is kept for police operational reasons and in the interest of prevention and detection of crime. History It is likely the practice of using police cautions began early in the nineteenth century. In the 1920s written warnings started being given for motoring offences. In 1928 the Home Office published statistics on cautions, and by 1931 was giving advice on the wording of cautions. In 1959 the Street Offences Act made a provision for removing cautions from criminal records. In 1962 Royal Commission on the Police noted concerns about the uneven enforcement of cautions. In 1978 the Home Office issued its first circular to bring about consistency in the use of cautions for juveniles, and in 1985 for adults. From 1995 cautions were recorded on the Police National Computer, and it was recommended that cautions should be retained for 5 years, though each police force could follow its own guidelines. The 1997 Police Act made provision for disclosing cautions to employers of those who might have unsupervised contact with children. The Criminal Justice Act 2003 introduced the concept of statutory Conditional Cautions. By the early 2000s police forces were given targets for the number of offences brought to justice. As giving a caution was a way of bringing an offence to justice more easily than going to court, in some policing areas the number of cautions given increased to about 30% of all offences brought to justice. In 2006 new guidelines were issued for the retention of records until the subject reached 100 years of age, but after 5 or 10 years, depending on the severity of the offence, they would only be used for DBS checks. In 2008 a Home Office circular made clear suspects must receive a written explanation of the implications before accepting a caution, to meet the informed consent obligation, and provided a new form to be signed by the offender which explained in considerable detail the consequences. From 2014, as part of the anti-social behaviour, crime and policing act 2014, a less stringent resolution of low-level offences has often been used by police forces in England and Wales instead of a caution. This is usually called a 'community resolution' and invariably requires less police time as offenders are not arrested. A community resolution does not require any formal record, but the offender should admit the offence and the victim should be happy with this method of informal resolution. Concerns have been expressed over the use of community resolution for violent offences, in particular domestic violence.

Terracotta, originally modelled in clay. Giant clay sculptures in Caruaru (Brazil). Roses and seashells made of Paperclay (DECO) Industrial clay: a clay model of a BMW Modelling clay is any of a group of malleable substances used in building and sculpting. The material compositions and production processes vary considerably.Putman, Brenda, (1939). The Sculptor‚Äôs Way: A Guide to Modelling and Sculpture. Farrar & Rinehart, Inc, New York, p. 8 Ceramic clay Ceramic clays are water-based substances made from clay minerals and other raw materials. They are baked at high temperatures in a process known as firing to create ceramics, such as terra cotta, earthenware, stoneware, and porcelain. Paper clay produced by pottery clay manufacturers is a clay body to which a small percentage of processed cellulose fiber has been added. When kiln-fired, the paper burns out, leaving the clay body. Consequently, the firing temperatures and glazes selection should be the same on those used with the clay body. Oil-based clay Oil-based clays are made from various combinations of oils, waxes, and clay minerals. Because the oils do not evaporate like water, oil-based clays remain malleable even when left in dry environments for long periods. Articles made from oil-based clays cannot be fired, and thus are not ceramics. Because rising temperature decreases oil viscosity, the malleability is influenced by heating or cooling the clay. Oil-based clay is not water-soluble. As it can be re-used, it is a popular material for animation artists who need to bend and move their models. It is available in a multitude of colors and is non-toxic. Readily worked in fine detail, oil-based clays are also suitable for the creation of detailed sculptures from which molds can be made. Castings and reproductions can then be produced from much more durable materials. Cars and airplanes may be created using industrial design-grade modelling clay. Oil-based clays are referred to by a number of genericized trademarks. * Plastilin (or Plasteline), which was patented in Germany by Franz Kolb in 1880, was developed by Claude Chavant in 1892 and trademarked in 1927. * Plasticine was invented in 1897 by William Harbutt of Bathampton, England. * Plastilina is trademarked as Roma Plastilina by Sculpture House, Inc. According to their website, their formula is 100 years old. Roma Plastilina contains sulfur, and since certain moldmaking compounds do not set in sulfur's presence, making molds of items made of industrial plasticine is difficult. Polymer clay Polymer clay is a modelling material that cures when heated from for 15 minutes per of thickness, and does not significantly shrink or change shape during the process. Despite being called \\"clay\\", it generally contains no clay minerals. Polymer clay is sold in craft, hobby, and art stores, and is used by artists, hobbyists, and children. Polymer clay is also popular in animation, since it allows static forms to be manipulated frame after frame. Leading brands of polymer clay include Fimo, Kato Polyclay, Sculpey, Modello and Crafty Argentina. Paper clay Paper clay is handmade or commercially available clay to which a small percentage of processed cellulose fiber is added. The fiber increases the tensile strength of the dry clay and enables dry-to-dry and wet-to-dry joins. Commercial paper clays air-dry to a firm, lightweight sculpture, with minimal shrinking during the drying process. Paper clay can be used as an unfired body in craft and doll-making. It is used in ceramic art studios as sculptural and functional studio pottery.

Salle was born in Norman, Oklahoma, and lives and works in East Hampton, New York. He earned a BFA and MFA from the California Institute of the Arts, Valencia, California, where he studied with John Baldessari. Salle‚Äôs work first came to public attention in New York in the early 1980s.  Biography  David Salle was born to Russian Jewish parents on September 28, 1952, in Norman, Oklahoma, but grew up in Wichita, Kansas. He developed an interest in art at a very young age, spending his childhood and teenage years in art classes provided by a local art organization. At the age of eight or nine, he began taking life-drawing classes at the Wichita Art Association. During high school, he attended outside art classes three days a week. After graduating from high school, Salle attended the California Institute of the Arts. There he trained and studied under John Baldessari, whom he credits for showing him a path to his artistry. Salle earned his BFA in three years, then received his MFA in two. After graduating, Salle relocated to New York, where he worked with Vito Acconci. During this time, he established a working partnership with Mary Boone, a renowned gallery owner, and still works with her to this day. Around the same time, Salle was hired by the American Ballet Theatre to design set and costumes. His work with dancer and choreographer Karole Armitage made the ballet a success, and Salle and Armitage fell in love. They eventually broke up, but continued to work together as friends. In 1995, Salle made his Hollywood directorial debut with Search and Destroy (1995 film), starring Christopher Walken and Griffin Dunne and produced by Martin Scorsese. The film met with mixed reactions. Salle now lives in East Hampton, New York.  Art  Salle's paintings and prints comprise what appear to be randomly juxtaposed and multilayered images, or images placed on top of one other with deliberately illogical techniques, in which he combines original and appropriated imagery. Imagery he uses includes items from popular culture, such as Donald Duck, and pieces from art history, such as parts from a Caravaggio painting. At a 2005 lecture, Salle said: Salle has worked with different media and processes. Many of his works consist of juxtaposed images, where he takes abstraction and the human figure. He manipulates images by combining a variety of different styles, recognizable imagery, and textures. Exhibitions of his work have taken place at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York, the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam, Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, Castello di Rivoli (Torino, Italy), the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, and the Kestnergesellschaft Museum in Hannover, Germany. Salle's work was also featured in The Pictures Generation, an exhibition curated by Douglas Eklund at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. His work was shown among a number of other contemporary artists including Richard Prince, Sherrie Levine, Cindy Sherman, Nancy Dwyer, Robert Longo, Thomas Lawson, Charles Clough and Michael Zwack. Salle's process typically starts with photographs he takes for reference, such as hired models. This was both groundbreaking and controversial at the time, primarily because the combination of these two art forms was not common practice. During this period, painters and photographers were often debating which form had more merit, or whether they had merit at all. Though his collection of photographs is considered art itself, Salle has said he would paint his final images because it took images from the real world and placed them in the world and context of painting. About his photographs as an artistic method, he has said: According to Salle, his intention was to eliminate any narrative from his work, though one might attempt to decipher a story from the imagery. His decision-making process begins with one image he is attracted to, to which he continues to add pieces from specific images he acquired until the painting feels complete. Though Salle's works do not contain a narrative, they do not lack meaning or relation. He has said that his choices of image are far from random, and that the pieces he chooses are cross-referenced with one another in complex ways. He believes this to be his form of originality in pieces that he appropriates. Salle has also done set and costume design and directed films. In 1986 he received a Guggenheim Fellowship for theater design, and directed the feature film Search and Destroy. He is a longtime collaborator with the choreographer Karole Armitage, designing sets and costumes for her ballets.  Written works  Salle is also a prolific writer on art. His essays and reviews have appeared in Artforum, Art in America, Modern Painters, The Paris Review, Interview, and numerous exhibition catalogs and anthologies. He was a regular contributor to Town & Country magazine. His collection of critical essays, How to See, was published by W. W. Norton in 2016. Salle worked closely with fellow contemporary artists such as Jeff Koons, Roy Lichtenstein, and John Baldessari in creating this collection. According to Dwight Garner: Salle's writing is much like his artistic style, witty and intriguing. He believes the jargon associated with art history can and should be simplified so that those who are interested but lack fine art schooling can still learn about and appreciate art.  Criticism and praise  Though Salle insists that his works are not a random assortment of images layered onto one another, critics were difficult to convince. Some common critiques are that his paintings are incoherent and the images he chooses arbitrary and unrelated to one another. The art critic and philosopher Arthur Danto wrote that Salle's paintings convey a \\"sense of purposiveness with no specific purpose.\\" Critic Robert Storr was fascinated by the work's \\"graphic double-exposure\\" and \\"kaleidoscopic effect,\\" as well as its infinite meanings and interpretations. Another point of contention was Salle's use of pornographic images of women, which some critics found a form of voyeurism or downright provocation, particularly to the feminist movement. Mira Schor, a feminist artist and writer, wrote that his portrayals of women seem \\"to be a continuation of a male conversation which is centuries old, to which women are irrelevant except as depersonalized projections of man's fears and fantasies.\\" Salle, as well as many critics, says that the images, though sexually explicit, are not \\"particularly erotic\\" because they are faded and blurred, distancing them from reality. Salle has said: Collections Salle's work is in the permanent collections of numerous art museums, including the Museum of Modern Art, New York; Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles; Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA); Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago; Walker Art Center, Minneapolis; Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; Tate Modern, London; and the National Gallery of Australia, Canberra.

The group works live and for television, generally in the context of special events such as the annual F√™te nationale du Qu√©bec as well as in various comedy programmes. It won a Prix G√©meaux in 2004 (the francophone equivalent of Canada's Gemini awards) for best comedy, variety or talk-show performance. The group's name comes from the Zapatista Army of National Liberation, a Mexican political movement that defends the Chiapas Indians, and from l'Apart√©, a small Montreal caf√© where the group was founded. Despite a generally careful use of language, the group's slogan is \\"against corruption, cultural uniformity, soundbites and sloganeering, the privatisation of our natural resources, military incompetence and loads of other stuff.\\" (¬´[...] s'opposer √† la corruption, √† la culture du consensus, √† la langue de bois, √† la privatisation de nos ressources, √† la d√©bilit√© militaire pis √† ben d‚Äôautres affaires¬ª) This slogan is in their manifesto, whose style harkens back to the roots of Quebec's Quiet Revolution. The humour of Les Zapartistes targets what they take to be immorality and illegality in Canadian politics. The group advertises itself as supportive of Quebec independence with respect to the Canadian federal government, which has been undermined by the recent Sponsorship scandal, but does not necessarily promote Quebec sovereignty. The group often performs parodies of popular music to make its point. For example, its song Les Fonds publics (Public finance) is a parody of Les Amoureux des bancs publics by Georges Brassens, through which it attacks financial abuses in the production of television programmes. The members of Les Zapartistes are: * Fran√ßois Parenteau * Fran√ßois Patenaude * Ga√©tan Troutet (the group's music specialist); * Christian Vanasse * Nadine Vincent (the group's editing specialist).
