Biography Mazzuchelli was the son of Count Federico Mazzuchelli (it., Brescia, 1671‚Äì1746) and Margaret Muzzi. Due to poor health during early childhood, he studied at first with a private tutor. He continued his studies in Bologna, where he studied under Francesco Saverio Quadrio, and later in Padua, where he studied under Domenico Lazzarini, where he graduated in 1728. In the same year, he married Barbara Chizzoli, an heiress whose dowry allowed him to devote himself to historical studies. Mazzucchelli's father bought the Moggi's sixteenth-century family house,Mazzucchelli Villa Museum located between Brescia and Lake Garda, in 1722, and added the central building and the west wing some time later. Giammaria completed the construction in 1753, as stated on the memorial tablet set between the pronaos' central door architrave and the tympanum. Works Notizie istoriche e critiche intorno alla vita, alle invenzioni, ed agli scritti di Archimede siracusano (1737) He began with numerous scholarly and accurate biographies of ancient and more modern authors, e.g., Archimedes, Pietro Aretino,Giammaria Mazzuchelli, Pietro Aretino's life written by Count Giammaria Mazzuchelli Brescia, Padova, following Giuseppe Comino , 1741Giammaria Mazzuchelli, Pietro Aretino's life written by Count Giammaria Mazzuchelli Brescia, decorated with seven tables , Milan, and Francesco Sonzogno Comp Contrada della Spiga, P.

From this experience, he conceived an ambitious plan to collect biographies of all the writers of Italy from the earliest times, including the history of their works. In this endeavor, he relied on the Queriniana library in Brescia, donated by the Cardinal Angelo Maria Quirini, and his extensive correspondence with the scholars of Italy and Europe. He began to compile a dictionary of great writers of Italy, but the work remained unfinished because of his untimely death.Giammaria Mazzuchelli, Writers of Italy, that is, historical news and criticism about the lives and writings of the Italian literati, Brescia, Bossini, 1753‚Äì1763..

EDHASA, 2006, 359 pages, () Originally a Christian from Castile, she converted to Islam under the name of Zoraya. She exerted a strong influence over her spouse. Life De Sol√≠s was the daughter of Castilian nobleman Sancho Jim√©nez de Sol√≠s. When Granada's new king refused to continue paying tribute to the crown of Castile, Christian armies began raiding the Kingdom of Granada. In reprisal, Al-Zagal, the sultan's brother, began conducting raids on Castile. On one such occasion, Isabel de Sol√≠s was captured while taking refuge in a church. At the time, it was common practice to ransom captured prisoners who came from noble families. However, even though de Sol√≠s was noble by birth, her family refused to pay the ransom because of her previous rebellious behavior toward her father, who had condemned her to live in a convent for the rest of her life. For this reason, she was taken to the Alhambra palace in Granada and sold as a slave to Abu l-Hasan Ali, the sultan of Granada. De Sol√≠s was forced to become one of the sultan's concubines, but Abu l-Hasan Ali fell in love and married her, exiling his first spouse Aixa from the palace. Upon de Sol√≠s' conversion to Islam, she took the name Turai, Soraya or Zoraya. She had two sons with the sultan, Nasr and Said. Because Aixa (known as Fatima) was a descendant of the Prophet Mohammed, the people, especially the religious leaders, caused a civil war in Granada in 1482. Abu l-Hasan Ali was eventually deposed by his first wife Aixa, with the help of Aliatar, the warlord of Loja. De Sol√≠s was taken captive by the Aixa faction and allowed to live on condition that Abu l-Hasan Ali give up the throne to his son Boabdil. Later, Abu l-Hasan Ali dedicated his life to conducting many successful raids on Castile, which caused him to regain his popularity among the people of Granada. As a result, he ended up rescuing de Sol√≠s and recovering some of his lost power in Granada for a short while before dying. After the death of her husband, de Sol√≠s and her sons converted to Catholicism and took the names Juan de Granada and Fernando de Granada.rtve.es Fiction Isabel de Sol√≠s appears as a character in the historical fiction work People of the Book by Geraldine Brooks, as does Abu l-Hasan Ali.

H. Lawrence, Margot Asquith and many others. In 1925 he was hired by William Berry as editor-in-chief of the Sunday Chronicle to become the second youngest (after John Delane) British editor-in-chief of a newspaper ever, and remained in that position until 1946, whereupon he undertook a variety of other occupations. Among other things Drawbell wrote three autobiographies, which, in addition to being valuable and often minute accounts of the changing age, also contain unique and insightful recollections of his encounters with famous people from all walks of life‚Äîranging from great men of letters such as Fitzgerald to politicians such as Hitler.  Life  Drawbell, the youngest of 6 siblings to survive to maturity, was born in Falkirk to a pupil teacher from Linlithgow and a daughter of a locally prominent entrepreneurial and authoritative figure, one Francis Wedgwood Broome, whose late-life penchant for his newspaper Bo'ness Journal must have influenced Drawbell's choice of career. Drawbell's early years were overshadowed by his father's drinking problem, which always kept the family at the brink of poverty; the marital discord finally resulted in Drawbell's father's being forced to leave for the Colonies for good. The rest of the family shortly thereafter emigrated to Edinburgh, where Drawbell attended school. At the age of 17 he enlisted in one of Scottish infantry regiments where he served until the Great War ended. After a while Drawbell together with a friend sailed to Canada in pursuit of a position in journalism, but, unsatisfied with limited prospects Montreal had to offer, moved to New York. There he held a variety of jobs with different editions (such as The Journal and The World) and made a number of acquaintances; in particular, it was there that he first crossed paths with Coward and Fitzgerald. Ultimately, at the age of 23, he elected to return to London, where he worked first in John Bull and then as editor-in-chief of the Sunday Chronicle, a newspaper in which he was to achieve the pinnacle of his journalistic career. Drawbell sought to revitalise the edition by making it relevant, up-to-date and sometimes verging on provocative, and so engaged the most diverse contributors and attracted exclusive material. For example, his was the only newspaper to offer Jacob Epstein space for an apology of Rima, then a newly erected statue in Kensington Gardens that the contemporary public had by and large considered scandalous; he bought exclusive rights to Isadora Duncan's memoirs for ¬£300 (up to ¬£50,000 in today's money), thereby indirectly sponsoring Duncan's perilous Amilcar ride; he encouraged Monica Dickens in her literary pursuits; and was one of the first recipients of Lady Chatterley's Lover (he dismissed it as a falsification). Drawbell's consistent anti-Nazi stance is also notable: as he led the newspaper through the period leading up to and including World War II, he worked methodically to dispel‚Äîemploying targeted pieces even from such people as Leon Trotsky‚Äîthe notion that Hitler harboured no ill will towards Britain; and consistently underlined the poor preparedness of Britain for the war which he saw as inevitable already in 1930, when his correspondent James Mellor wrote from Berlin: \\"Hitler is fanatical and ruthless... he is a real menace to the British Empire and to world peace\\".Drawbell, J.

The strip continued to run in \\"Buster\\" until the magazine ceased publication in 2000. The series was written by Keith Reynolds and drawn by Tom Paterson.http://www.bustercomic.co.uk/schoolbelle.html Concept The series centered on a pretty and popular girl named \\"School Belle\\", a pun on the terms 'school bell' and belle of the ball, and the attempts of various boys to become her latest boyfriend. A recurring theme was Belle's feud with the unattractive and jealous Grotty Glenda, who would often plot to cause trouble for Belle. Glenda usually enlisted her steady boyfriend, the physically imposing but henpacked Beefy Bernie, to help her; however, he secretly found Belle attractive, and she was often able to distract him from Glenda's schemes by flirting. In 1988 Belle was given a regular boyfriend, public schoolboy Sebastian. Another theme of the strip was the attempt of various 'nurks' - nerdy and unattractive boys - to gain Belle's attention. The nurks became such a popular feature of the strip that, in 1987, it began featuring a 'Know Your Nurks' breakout box, in which a different comically named nurk (e.g. Cyril Stinkinbottom) would appear in detail alongside an amusing fact about him. Sometimes the strip would have Belle be on the \\"losing end\\", particularly when she got too taken with her personal appearance. One example being where a movie was shooting in Belle's hometown and she found work as an extra. When the leading man is a handsome movie star, Belle (like most other girls) is beside herself. When she arrives on set, she learns the film is actually a horror movie, and she is cast as a vampire, whilst the hunky leading man is a vampire hunter! In 1990, following comments from readers that Belle was not actually that pretty, she was redrawn in a very different style, with a more modern hairstyle and casual clothing replacing her old-fashioned school uniform. The change was explained in a strip which showed Grotty Glenda dressing up as Belle to pose for the strip's artist, making Belle look bad in the process. Belle's boyfriend Sebastian was also replaced by a more modern counterpart. However, when Buster went fortnightly in the mid-nineties and switched to reprints, the original Belle reappeared.

He is a board member of FINROSFORUM. He is known for his clashes with the Finnish and Swedish authorities concerning the hosting of the Kavkaz Center's website on his servers. In 2011‚Äì2012, he has also been involved in a court case, in which he was found guilty of arranging illegal entry into Finland of 25 Chechens. Hosting of Kavkaz Center in Finland In Finland Storsj√∂ became a public figure in October 2004, when the Lithuanian government banned the Kavkaz Center website, and Storsj√∂ moved the website to his server in Finland. The Finnish Security Intelligence Service (FSIS) then confiscated his servers. In the public discussion that then ensued, there was a general agreement that the authorities had violated the freedom of speech with their actions. After these events, Storsj√∂ has continued to support Kavkaz Center by offering them the use of his servers both in Finland and in Sweden. Kavkaz Center is an internet news agency which publishes news on Chechnya and the Caucasus region from the point of view of the Mujahideen warriors. It is believed that the Kavkaz Center is in the control of the ‚Äúminister of public relations‚Äù of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria, Movladi Udugov. Udugov belongs to the Islamic warriors of the region.Chechnya Weekly Volume 7, Issue 38 (October 05, 2006), Andrei Smirnov: Dokku Umarov: Between Jihad and the Struggle for Freedom: ‚ÄúThis rhetoric of Dokku Umarov could not be ignored by the Islamic wing of the insurgency. The Kavkaz-Center website, which is controlled by Movladi Udugov, started to censor Umarov‚Äôs statements.‚Äù The publishing activities of the Kavkaz Center are known to be a sore point for Russia, which is involved in a war in the area. Russia has tried to resort to diplomatic means in order to prevent the website from being hosted in various countries, including Sweden and Finland. The Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov has said that the website is being used to incite people to conduct terrorist activities. Those who defend the website, however, argue that mediation of news based on pluralistic values is the only way that both parties of the conflict can make their views known to the public. The Kavkaz Center website was closed in Lithuania in the autumn of 2004, on request by Russia, after the Beslan school hostage crisis, when the website had published a message from Shamil Basayev, in which he assumed responsibility for the attack. After this Storsj√∂ offered the website the services of his servers in his web hotel. Finnish Foreign Minister Erkki Tuomioja then wrote in his own website, after he found out about the existence of the website on a Finnish server, that ‚Äú[in Finland] measures were taken immediately to close down the website‚Äù and that the website had now been closed down. Later Tuomioja stated that the actions by the authorities may have been initiated at the same time or after the information about the opening of the website was passed on to the foreign minister, but these actions were not based on any instructions from the Foreign Ministry, to whose jurisdiction they do not by any means belong. According to the acting head of the FSIS, Mr. Hannu Moilanen, the actions of the security intelligence service were approved from a high level: We were in good co-operation with the head of the state, who blessed our actions and considered them quite necessary. The Finnish Security Intelligence Service first asked the internet operator TeliaSonera to disconnect Storsj√∂‚Äôs server from the web. TeliaSonera did not agree to this, since in their opinion the Chechen rebels website did not break any law. After this the Finnish Security Intelligence Service asked Storsj√∂ to remove the Kavkaz Center website from his server, but Storsj√∂ refused to do this, citing freedom of speech as his grounds. On the following day representatives of the Security Intelligence Service went to see an associate of Storsj√∂ in order to discuss the matter, and the associate handed the server over to the Security Intelligence Service so that they could investigate it. Due to these events, president of the Committee on Constitutional Matters of the Finnish Parliament, MP Kimmo Sasi submitted a written question to the government on the actions of the Security Intelligence Service, to which Minister of the Interior, Mr. Kari Rajam√§ki replied, ‚Äúthat there was nothing in the actions of the Security Intelligence Service that would merit a reprimand.‚Äù During his visit to Finland, Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Fradkov thanked Finnish Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen for having closed down the Kavkaz Centerin website. When it was no longer possible to operate in Finland, Storsj√∂ transferred Kavkaz Center to his servers in Sweden, but when it was found out that the website was legal in Finland, he opened it on his Finnish servers. The Russian ambassador to Finland, Mr. Vladimir Grinin then asked Finnish members of Parliament why it was allowed in Finland to keep the Kavkaz Center website on Finnish servers and nothing had been done about it. On the basis of discussion carried out by members of the public, the MPs answered him that freedom of speech is in force in Finland and that politicians cannot interfere with websites so long as no law is broken. Storsj√∂ has also been involved in arm wrestling with the authorities and the Russian ambassador in Sweden. However, both a court of law and the Chancellor of Justice have ruled that the contents of the website are legal and that there are no grounds on which it should be closed down. The great amount of publicity that kavkazcenter.com got in Finland and the significance of these developments have to do with the principle of freedom of speech and questions relating to it, and thus the case was widely commented upon in the editorials of Finnish newspapers and elsewhere in the media. This discussion has helped to draw the line at which the authority of courts of law and the police ends in matters relating to freedom of speech. Alleged Financial Support for Chechen Terrorists Storsj√∂ said in May 2005 an interview with Turun Sanomat that he is collecting money through donations that anyone can make to an association called ‚ÄúSupport for information service on the Caucasus‚Äù, from which moneys are directed to the support of Kavkaz Center. He did, however, admit that the moneys end up with Chechen rebels, among whom there are ‚Äúelements that have tendencies towards terrorism.‚Äù The matter was first made public by Aamulehti, and Storsj√∂ said that this was a false report, since no association called ‚ÄúSupport for information service on the Caucasus‚Äù ever has existed. It is not possible to find out anything about this alleged association with the Google search engine, and no such association exists in the Finnish Register for Associations. Apprehension on Odessa Ukrainian authorities apprehended Storsj√∂ in Odessa on May 26, 2008, because he was on the list of personae non gratae in the Russian Federation. Storsj√∂ was released from jail on May 28, 2007, and the Ukrainian authorities had cause to review their practises concerning lists of personae non gratae. Court Case Concerning Alleged Organisation of Chechens‚Äô Illegal Entry into Finland In early June 2009, Storsj√∂ declared that he had arranged the entry into Finland of around 50 Chechens who had been living in exile in Turkey. He said the Finnish Border Guard suspected him of arranging a gross illegal entry to Finland in April 2009. In a court case that began on March 24, 2011, in the Vantaa Local Court, the prosecutor Mikko Sipila accused Storsj√∂ altogether of three cases of arranging an illegal entry, of which one he considered to be a gross one. He demanded that Storsj√∂ be given a jail sentence. The alleged crimes had taken place from 2007 to 2010. According to the prosecution, Storsj√∂ had brought 22 Chechens from Turkey to Finland on three separate occasions, and 9 of these people had been minors. None of these people had carried travel documents that would have entitled them to enter Finland. The prosecution also deemed that even though Storsj√∂ had not benefited from this activity financially, he had reaped benefits in other ways, such as gaining a reputation and the respect of certain circles.‚Äù Storsj√∂ denied having benefited from gains in reputation. He had publicly disclosed his activities only after the Border Guard had released statements to the effect that they suspected him of committing crimes. In fact he had only had losses from his activism, since he had paid the air fares of the Chechens from Istanbul via Helsinki to St. Petersburg from his own and his company‚Äôs funds. Storsj√∂ denied having broken Finnish law. According to him the criminal law allows the arrangement of entry to foreigners when there are acceptable grounds for such action. ‚ÄúI have decided to help these people, and I have done so fully conscious of the risks on my part.‚Äù The court case concluded on May 9, 2011. Storsj√∂ was acquitted of all charges. The court held that his activity had not been of criminal kind, but that there had been acceptable grounds for it. The judge referred to the same section of the law that Storsj√∂ had cited in court. The judge considered that Storsj√∂‚Äôs grounds for his activity were credible: this was a case of humanitarian activity based on empathy. The judge considered that the Chechens really were in need of protection, since nearly all of them had already been awarded asylum in Finland. The judge also considered that Storsj√∂ had not benefited personally from his activism; on the contrary, he had received various threats because of it. The prosecutor had stated that he shall appeal the decision and the case may yet continue in the Hovr√§tt, that is, The Court of Appeals. In June 2012, it reversed the lower court's decision and handed down a four-month suspended sentence, ruling that the Chechens were not in danger. Storsj√∂ plans to appeal to the Supreme Court of Finland. Political career Storsj√∂ was a candidate for the Green League of Finland in Helsinki in the 2008 Finnish municipal elections.Storsjo.net He received 106 votes and was not elected.

Director of the Legislative Research Commission Byerman assumed office on October 1, 2015, taking the helm of an agency that had been racked by a sexual harassment scandal and poor management practices. Glasgow Daily Times, October 7, 2015 Citing a highly professional workforce, Byerman expressed early optimism in a full recovery for the agency. CN2 Interview, Time Warner Cable, October 7, 2015 He wrote an op/ed less than a week into his tenure, which was widely run in every major newspaper in the state, in which he was widely quoted saying that LRC needed to \\"get its swagger back.\\" Op/Ed, \\"It's Time for LRC to Get Its Swagger Back, 10/5/15\\" Byerman assumed office on October 1, 2015 and currently makes $141,750 a year under a contract extension announced in September 2017.

Article, \\"New chief of Ky legislative staff brings reform\\" Louisville Courier Journal 12/19/16 In his first two months with the agency, over 125 employees scheduled one-on-one meetings with the Director. He has moved to shore up internal LRC communications, establishing a daily internal news bulletin, launching a bimonthly newsletter, and establishing a social media presence under the handle @DirectorLRC. He also changed a longtime policy where employees were awarded a set number of comp time hours at the sole discretion of the Director, opting instead to adopt a \\"one for one\\" comp time approach. In August 2016, Byerman presented, and the Legislative Research Commission approved, an employee classification plan. This established‚Äîfor the first time in the agency's history‚Äîformal job descriptions for all positions and a formal organizational structure. For years, LRC employees operated without clearly explained procedures for advancement or pay increases, with the staff feeling that many decisions were being made arbitrarily by previous directors. Then House Speaker Greg Stumbo gave Byerman's plan high marks, saying it was a good plan that addressed longstanding issues documented by the National Conference of State Legislatures. Glasgow Daily Times, August 3, 2016 Byerman plans to implement performance evaluations based on the classification plan. In 2017, the LRC announced that it had updated its measurement of employee satisfaction, using an identical survey to one used to diagnose widespread employee dissatisfaction previously. The updated survey dramatic improvement for the agency under Byerman's leadership, with LRC showing improvements in 49 of the 54 areas in which employee satisfaction was measured. The area that showed the biggest change between 2014 and 2017 reflected increased confidence that LRC‚Äôs hiring practices are consistent for all job openings. On a four-point scale, employee responses on that topic were almost nine-tenths of a point higher in this year‚Äôs survey.

The initiative for the organization of the institution was undertaken by the mathematician Constantin Carath√©odory. However, the University of Smyrna, the first to be established in the city, never operated due to the Greek defeat in the Greco-Turkish War and the subsequent evacuation in September 1922. Background Greek education in Smyrna was already thriving during the Ottoman period. A total of 67 educational institutions were operating in early 20th century thanks to support from the local Greek community, the church as well as from private institutions. The most notable schools in the city were the Homer School for Girls, the Graeco-German Lycee and the Evangelical School. The latter was the most renowned possessing an archaeological museum, a natural science collection and a library.Georgiadou, 2004: 145 Carath√©odory's initiative Constantin Carath√©odory (1873-1950) Smyrna came under Greek control, as part of the post World War I political developments, while the creation of a university in the city was one of Greek High Commissioner's, Aristidis Stergiadis, dearest projects. For this purpose, Constantin Carath√©odory, mathematician, professor at the University of G√∂ttingen, Germany, and close friend of Albert Einstein, came to Smyrna. He took up the management of the University on the instructions of the Greek government.Georgiadou, 2004: 146 For the same purpose, in September 1920 Georgios Ioakimoglou, lecturer of Pharmacology at Humboldt University of Berlin, was also called to Smyrna to assist Carath√©odory in organising the project and to take full professorship for hygiene and microbiology. On the evening of their arrival in Smyrna, Carath√©odory and Ioakeimoglou, discussed with Stergiadis the situation and the measures that should be taken regarding the foundation of the University. Stergiadis promised to support this initiative and indeed, the Greek administration covered the expenses for the foundation, organization and management and granted them a large building, which was half-erected that time.Georgiadou, 2004: 151 The foundation of the Ionian University was proclaimed with a High Commissioner's decree, at December 1920. This decree corresponded to the ideas that Carath√©odory presented in a memorandum. Facilities and schools The building was begun in 1911 for the School of Union and Progress (ƒ∞zmir ƒ∞ttihad ve Terakki Mektebi) by the governor of the Aydin Vilayet Mustafa Rahmi Bey. However, its construction was not completed.\\"ƒ∞zmir Kƒ±z Lisesi\\" in the official website of the municipality of Konak, ƒ∞zmir, Retrieved 5 June 2011 \\"Tarih√ßemiz\\" in the official website of the Izmir Girls' High School, Retrieved 19 June 2011 The University was to comprise four schools, namely for agriculture and natural sciences, oriental languages, for social and economic sciences and for trade and supervision of construction work. Parallel to the education of specialists in agriculture, the School of Agriculture had the task to organize seminars for landowners and farmers as well as advising them on more efficient cultivation methods; on how to fight plant and animal diseases and to conduct scientific research in its laboratories. It operated in conjunction with a big experimental farm at Tepekoy, near Smyrna, while British historian and correspondent of the Manchester Guardian in Smyrna that time, Arnold J. Toynbee, was very impressed by his visit in the university farm.Georgiadou, 2004: 155 One of Carath√©odory's concerns was also the university library. On May 11, 1921 the High Commissioner's Office agreed to his proposed expenditure of 18,000 Swiss francs for the purchase of the library.Georgiadou, 2004: 162 Carath√©odory organized the library according to the current European standards and thus he initiated cooperation with one of Leipzig‚Äôs most prominent book catalog agencies. He also hired specialized technical personnel from Berlin in order to prepare plans for the library‚Äôs indoor architecture and detailed designs for the metallic bookshelves. Greek was the intended language of instruction, in some cases Turkish or other languages would be allowed. Admission to the university was to be open to all, irrespective sex or nationality provided the prerequisites determined through special regulations were met. Additionally, the university would have the right to accept guest students and to award doctorates, diplomas and certificates. The central administration of the institution would be accountable to the General Secretary.Geogriadou, 2004: 153-154 Evacuation of Smyrna and the fate of the library On the eve of the Greek defeat in Anatolia during the Greco-Turkish War, all the measures necessary for managing the university had been taken. The Institute of Hygiene and the library were scheduled for inauguration in October 10, 1922. However, the university would not be able to open due to developments in the ongoing Greco-Turkish War which ended with the Greek defeat and the evacuation of Asia Minor, in September 1922.Georgiadou, 2004: 167 Carath√©odory managed to transfer the material, which was originally destined for use at the University of Smyrna, to the new Central Library of Athens University. In 1923, after the Turkish recovery of the city, the building began to be used as the Izmir Teachers' College for Males (ƒ∞zmir Erkek Muallim Mektebi). In 1936, after the Teachers' College for Males moved to Kƒ±zƒ±l√ßullu (It was renamed as \\"Paradiso\\" during Greek occupation, now ≈ûirinyer), Buca under the authority of the Village Institutes that was forming at the time, the building was assigned to ).

They compete in the Atlantic Coast Conference. The Tar Heels won the NCAA championship in 2001 and 2011. History The UNC men's varsity soccer team was founded in 1947 by Dr. Marvin Allen, the teams first coach. Before the team had only been at the club level. Dr. Allen led the team until 1977 when the current UNC women's soccer team coach Anson Dorrance took over. Dorrance spent 12 successful seasons with the men's team until 1988. One of the main reasons for his retirement from the men's team was to focus on the women's program, which he had begun coaching while he was the men's coach. Dorrance led the Tar Heel's to their first ACC Tournament Championship in the tournament's inaugural year, 1987. Elmar Bolowich took the reins from Dorrance and led the team to a National Championship in 2001, the first of the program. Bolowich resigned in 2011, and the former assistant coach, and current head coach, Carlos Somoano was hired. In his first year as head coach, Somoano won the 2011 national championship, a feat only accomplished by one other coach, Indiana's Mike Freitag. The same year, he also won the ACC regular season, and the ACC Tournament, winning every title possible for the year. Since the programs founding in 1947, Carolina has posted only 2 losing seasons. Making 4 consecutive College Cup appearances from 2008‚Äì2011, UNC has established itself as a powerhouse in modern-day college soccer in one of the most dominant conferences in the country. Facilities =Fetzer Field= Fetzer Field was originally built in 1935 as a part of president Franklin D. Roosevelt's Works Project Administration, which brought much needed jobs to native Tar Heels. It was originally constructed for the track and field team, named after a previous UNC athletic director, Bob Fetzer. However, Fetzer Field soon served home to men's soccer in 1947, men's lacrosse in 1949, women's soccer in 1979, and women's lacrosse in 1996. It has also served as a site for numerous men's and women's lacrosse and soccer ACC Championship events, National Junior Olympic events, and as the home training site for the U.S. Track and Field Team in 1996. =McCaskill Soccer Center= Located right next to Fetzer Field, the McCaskill Soccer Center serves multiple functions for Tar Heel men's and women's soccer. It holds the offices of both men's and women's coaches and a meeting room on the second level, complete with a deck. On the first level there are the men's and women's team locker rooms, as well as a team meeting room. Named after long time Tar Heel supporters, the McCaskill family, the McCaskill Soccer Center has been in use since 1999. National Championship NCAA Tournament overviews =2001= The 2001 NCAA Division I Men's Soccer Championship was the first national title that the men's soccer team had earned. The road to the championship game saw the #7 seeded Tar Heel's defeat #3 seeded Stanford by a score of 3‚Äì2 in overtime of the semifinals. That moved the tar heels along to the National Championship game against #4 seeded Indiana. The game would be won 2‚Äì0 by the Tar Heels in regular time with goals from Ryan Kneipper and Danny Jackson. When asked about the game, Coach Bolowich said, \\"I thought David- as well as our entire defense ‚Äì played a fantastic game and the team effort was there\\". The team's record of 21‚Äì4 saw the program claim its first national title. =2011= The 2011 NCAA Division I Men's Soccer Championship was the second national title the men's soccer team had earned. During the course of the tournament, the #1 seeded Tar Heels defeated Coastal Carolina (3‚Äì2), Indiana (1‚Äì0 in OT), and Saint Mary's (2‚Äì0) respectively, to reach the College Cup. In the semifinal, the Tar Heels faced #13 seeded UCLA, and would win the game 2‚Äì1, by way of a penalty kick shootout (3‚Äì1). Carolina faced the unseeded Charlotte 49ers in the final, winning the game 1‚Äì0 on a second-half Ben Speas goal. Team captain, Kirk Urso, who died due to a congenital heart defect at age 22, said in an interview after the game \\"My whole college career has been awesome, but there was something extra about this team. To cap it off with this is something I'm going to remember the rest of my life.\\" A final record of 21‚Äì2‚Äì3 illustrates what a special year the Tar Heels had. Rivalries =Duke= The North Carolina vs. Duke rivalry is considered to be one of the greatest rivalry in the history of sports. That doesn't change when the two schools meet on the soccer field.

The centre also contained the electrical control centre for the line and the LNE regional control office of Network Rail. Its responsibility for signalling across Yorkshire was transferred to York Rail Operating Centre in December 2018. History The centre originally opened in May 1989, first replacing local boxes in the area, including the 1951 York power box. The 1951 box was at the time one of the largest route-relay interlockings in the world, its relay room 46 metres long by 10 metres wide, containing nearly 3,000 relays. It replaced seven mechanical boxes containing a total of 868 levers ‚Äì the largest of which was Locomotive Yard, the largest mechanical signal box in the UK. York IECC also replaced the LNER power boxes at Northallerton, Thirsk (dating from 1933) Tollerton and Skelton Junction When the first stage of York IECC was completed in April 1990, its control area boundaries were Church Fenton, Low Gates, just south of Great Heck to Just south of Darlington on the ECML. In the early 2000s, the IECC was further extended to take in the 1960s Leeds PSB area, Church Fenton and the newly electrified lines to Skipton. The control area was further extended in 2011 with the closure of Moorthorpe and Hickleton signal boxes. Control area The IECC now has seven workstations: York North, York South, Leeds West, Leeds North-West, Leeds East, Leeds East Assist and Leeds Ardsley. The workstations are supplied with automatic route setting (ARS) to assist with the signallers' workload. The overall control area is Danby Wiske on the ECML to north of Shaftholme Junction and from Gargrave (north of Skipton)/Bradford Forster Square/Ilkley/New Pudsey/Woodlesford/Cottingley/Bolton on Dearne/South Elmsall/Horsforth through Leeds station to York (via Church Fenton). Leeds station handles around 1,000 train services per day, and York around 420. The centre drives a number of Solid State Interlockings (SSI) and older Route Relay Interlockings (RRI), for example some of the relay rooms provided for the 1983 Selby Diversion, which was controlled from a separate mosaic panel inside the old 1951 box before the area was controlled by the IECC. There is also a Westlock interlocking controlling the Moorthorpe/Hickleton area. Other Part of the centre's overview screens are displayed in the National Railway Museum at York. The most recent update to York IECC was at Christmas 2011, when there were changes to the track layout at the south end of the York station to improve the capacity of the station by providing an additional approach track from Holgate Junction.Network Rail press release The updates required to the IECC and the SSI interlockings were undertaken by DeltaRail. By the end of 2016, signalling controlled by York IECC was due be transferred to the Rail Operating Centre located adjacent to the IECC building. However, most of this was delayed until the Christmas period over 2018/2019 and the IECC will then be decommissioned. The transfer was completed between 24 and 27 December 2018 The IECC building may also be demolished to make way for more platforms in station.

He was also editor of The Philatelic Record for the first seven years of its existence from 1879. Early life At the age of 15, Burnett was sent to Frankfurt to complete his education and it was there that he began to collect stamps. On his return to Scotland he gave his collection to his sister before beginning his legal training. His sister did not add to the collection and subsequently Burnett decided to renew his interest in stamps.Birch, Brian J. Philatelic and Postal Bookplates. 5th edition. Standish, Wigan: 2010, p. 139. Organised philately Burnett joined The Philatelic Society London, now The Royal Philatelic Society London, in March 1877, subsequently becoming a Fellow of the society. Many early meetings of the society took place at Burnett's chambers in Gray's Inn. Hard times According to Brian Birch, Burnett fell on hard times in 1887 following the crash of his business interests in the West Indies and ceased his subscription to the Royal Philatelic Society London.Birch, Brian.

At its greatest extent, the colony included the present-day State of Queensland, the Territory of Papua and the Coral Sea Islands Territory.  History  =Nineteenth century= In 1823, John Oxley sailed north from Sydney to inspect Port Curtis (now Gladstone) and Moreton Bay as possible sites for a penal colony. At Moreton Bay, he found the Brisbane River whose existence Cook had predicted, and proceeded to explore the lower part of it. In September 1824, he returned with soldiers and established a temporary settlement at Redcliffe. On 2 December, the settlement was transferred to where the Central Business District (CBD) of Brisbane now stands. The settlement was initially called Edenglassie, a portmanteau of the Scottish towns Edinburgh and Glasgow. Major Edmund Lockyer discovered outcrops of coal along the banks of the upper Brisbane River in 1825. In 1839, transportation of convicts ceased, culminating in the closure of the Brisbane penal settlement. In 1842, free settlement was permitted. In the same year Andrew Petrie reported favourable grazing conditions and decent forests to the north of Brisbane, which led shortly to the arrival of settlers to Fraser Island and the Cooloola coast region. Immigrants aboard the Artemisia arrived at the colony of Moreton Bay in 1848. In 1847, the Port of Maryborough was opened as a wool port. The first immigrant ship to arrive in Moreton Bay was the Artemisia in 1848. In 1857, Queensland's first lighthouse was built at Cape Moreton. =Frontier war= Fighting between Aborigines and settlers in colonial Queensland was more bloody than in any other colonial state in Australia, perhaps partly due to Queensland having a larger pre-contact indigenous population than any other colony in Australia, accounting for over one third, and in some estimates close to forty percent, of the entire pre- contact population of the continent. The latest and hitherto most comprehensive survey estimates that some 1,500 European settlers ‚Äì and their Chinese, Aboriginal and Melanesian allies ‚Äì died in frontier skirmishes with Aboriginals in Queensland during the nineteenth century. The same study indicates that the casualties Aboriginal people suffered in these battles with settlers and native police (frequently described by contemporary political leaders and newspapers as \\"warfare\\", \\"a kind of warfare\\", \\"guerrilla-like warfare\\", and at times as a \\"war of extermination\\") is highly likely to have exceeded 30,000. (That is a tripling of the hitherto used minimum estimates for Queensland.)√òrsted-Jensen, Robert: Frontier History Revisited: ‚Äì Colonial Queensland and the 'History War, Brisbane 2011Evans, Raymond: The country has another past: Queensland and the History Wars, in ‚ÄòPassionate Histories: Myth, memory and Indigenous Australia‚Äô Aboriginal History Monograph 21, September 2010 (Edited by Frances Peters-Little, Ann Curthoys and John Docker).Queenslander 1 May 1880 & Brisbane Courier, 8 May 1880, p.2e-f, editorial; The Way We Civilise; Black and White; The Native Police: ‚Äì A series of articles and letters Reprinted from the ‚ÄòQueenslander‚Äô (Brisbane, December 1880)Rusden: History of Australia Vol 3 pp.146‚Äì56 & 235 Yet even this figure is liable to increase if the results of the first attempt to use extensive primary sources to calculate the Aboriginal casualties due to violence on the Queensland frontier in this period is used. A paper prepared by Raymond Evans and Robert √òrsted-Jensen for the annual AHA conference at University of Queensland on 9 July 2014 indicated that a minimum figure of 65,000 Aboriginal casualties is a more realistic figure. The \\"Native Police Force\\" (sometimes \\"Native Mounted Police Force\\"), recruited and deployed by the Queensland government, was a key instrument in the oppression, dispossession and murder of indigenous people during this period. The three largest massacres of whites by Aborigines in Australian colonial history all took place in Queensland.

The Battle of One Tree Hill and Darkey Flat massacre also took place in the 1840s. =Colony of Queensland= In 1851, a public meeting was held to consider Queensland's separation from New South Wales. On 6 June 1859 Queen Victoria signed Letters Patent to form the colony of Queensland. A proclamation was read by George Bowen on 10 December 1859 whereupon Queensland was formally separated from New South Wales. Bowen became the first Governor of Queensland and Robert Herbert became the first Premier of Queensland. Queensland was the only Australian colony that commenced immediately with its own parliament, instead of first spending time as a Crown Colony (i.e. having a Governor appointed by The Crown). By this time, Western Australia was the only Australian colony without responsible government. Ipswich and Rockhampton became towns in 1860, with Maryborough and Warwick becoming towns the following year. In 1861, rescue parties for Burke and Wills, which failed to find them, did some exploratory work of their own, in central and north-western Queensland. Notably among these was Frederick Walker who originally worked for the native police. Brisbane was linked by electric telegraph to Sydney in 1861, however the first operating telegraph line in Queensland was from Brisbane to Ipswich in the same year. Gold rush Early gold miners were prepared to live rough to strike it rich. Although smaller than the gold rushes of Victoria and New South Wales, Queensland had its own series of gold rushes in the later half of the nineteenth century. In 1858, gold was discovered at Canoona. In 1867, gold was discovered in Gympie. Richard Daintree's explorations in North Queensland lead to several goldfields being developed in the late 1860s.G. C. Bolton, 'Daintree, Richard (1832‚Äì1878) '. Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University. 1972. Retrieved 9 October 2015. In 1872, William Hann discovers gold on the Palmer River, southwest of Cooktown. Chinese settlers began to arrive in the goldfields, by 1877 there were 17,000 Chinese on Queensland gold fields. In that year restrictions on Chinese immigration were passed. =Other events= Mary River residence, 1870 Mackay in the 1880s 1862 saw Queensland's western boundary changed from longitude 141¬∞ E to 138¬∞E. In 1863, the first Chief Justice, Sir James Cockle was appointed. 1864 was an annus horribilis for Queensland. In March of that year, major flooding of the Brisbane River inundated the centre of town, in April, fires devastated the west side of Queen Street, which was the main shopping district and in December, another fire, which was Brisbane's worst ever, wiped out the rest of Queen Street and adjoining streets. 1865 saw the first steam trains in Queensland, travelling (from Ipswich to Bigge's Camp, which is now known as Grandchester). Townsville gazetted as a town in the same year. In 1867, the Queensland Constitution was consolidated from existing legislation under the Constitution Act 1867. Sugar production was by then becoming a major industry. In 1867, six mills produced 168 tons of cane-sugar, by 1870 there were 28 mills with a production of 2,854 tons. The production of sugar started around Brisbane, but spread to Mackay and Cairns, and by 1888 the annual output of sugar was 60,000 tons. 1871 saw George Phipps, 2nd Marquess of Normanby become the Governor of Queensland. The first record of a rugby match played in Queensland occurred in 1876. In 1877, Arthur Edward Kennedy became the Governor of Queensland. The first meat processed in the state occurred at Queensport along the Brisbane River in 1881. In 1883, Queensland Premier Sir Thomas McIlwraith annexes Papua (later repudiated by British government). On 2 June the decision to form a rugby union association was made at the Exchange hotel in Brisbane. The same year Queensland's population passed the 250,000 mark. In 1887, the Brisbane-Wallangarra railway line was opened, and in 1888 there was a line opened between Brisbane and Charleville. There were other lines that were nearly complete from Rockhampton to Longreach, and others being constructed around Maryborough, Mackay and Townsville. By 1888, there were more than 5 million cattle in Queensland. South Brisbane during the 1893 Brisbane flood 1891 saw the Great Shearers' Strike at Barcaldine leads to formation of the Australian Labor Party. The issue in the strike was whether employers were entitled to use non-union labour. There were troops and police called in, some sheds were fired, and there were mass riots. There was a second shearers strike in 1894. Union sponsored candidates won sixteen seats at the Queensland elections in 1893. The 1893 Brisbane flood caused much destruction including destroying the Victoria Bridge. The land where the Brisbane Cricket Ground now sits was first used as a cricket ground in 1895, with the first cricket match played there in December 1896. In 1897, Native (Aboriginal) Police force disbanded. Coal mine in Ipswich, 1898 In 1899, the world's first Labor Party Government, with Premier Anderson Dawson as the leader, was elected into power only to last one week. In July 1899 Queensland offered to send a force of 250 mounted infantry to help Britain in the Second Boer War (Second Anglo-Boer War). Also in that year, gold production at Charters Towers peaked. The first natural gas find in Queensland and Australia was at Roma in 1900 as a team was drilling a water well. The Mahina Cyclone of 1899 strikes Cape York Peninsula, destroying a pearling fleet in Princess Charlotte Bay. The cyclone claimed the lives of around 400 people, making it Queensland's worst maritime disaster. Immigration During the 1890s many workers known as the Kanakas were brought to Queensland from neighbouring Pacific Island nations to work in the sugar cane fields. Some of whom had been kidnapped under a process known as Blackbirding. When Australia was federated in 1901, the White Australia policy came into effect, whereby all foreign workers in Australia were deported under the Pacific Island Labourers Act of 1901. At this time there were between 7,000 and 10,000 Pacific Islanders living in Queensland. Most of them had been deported by 1908, by which time there were only 1500‚Äì2500 remaining. =European exploration and settlement= = Exploration= In 1606, the Dutch navigator Willem Janszoon landed near the site of the modern-day town of Weipa on the western shore of Cape York. His arrival was the first recorded encounter between European and Australian Aboriginal people. In 1614, Luis V√°ez de Torres, a Spanish explorer may have sighted the Queensland coast at the tip of Cape York. In that year, he had sailed the Torres Strait, the body of water now named after him. In 1768, the French explorer Louis Antoine de Bougainville sailed west from the New Hebrides islands, getting to within a hundred miles of the Queensland coast. He did not reach the coast because he did not find a passage through the coral reefs, and turned back. Lieutenant James Cook wrote that he claimed the east coast for King George III of England on 22 August 1770 when standing on Possession Island off the west coast of Cape York Peninsula, naming eastern Australia \\"New South Wales\\".European discovery and the colonisation of Australia culture.gov.au http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/australianhistory/ This included the present Queensland. Cook charted the Australian east coast in his ship HM Barque \\"Endeavour\\", naming Stradbroke and Morton (now Moreton Island) islands, the Glass House Mountains, Double Island Point, Wide Bay, Hervey Bay and the Great Sandy Cape, now called Fraser Island. His second landfall in Australia was at Round Hill Head, 500 km north of Brisbane. The Endeavour was grounded on a coral reef near Cape Tribulation, on 11 June 1770 where he was delayed for almost seven weeks while they repaired the ship. This occurred where Cooktown now lies, on the Endeavour River, both places named after the incident. On 22 August the Endeavour reached the northern tip of Queensland, which Cook named the Cape York Peninsula after the Duke of York. In 1799, in the Norfolk, Matthew Flinders spent six weeks exploring the Queensland coast as far north as Hervey Bay. In 1802 he explored the coast again. On a later trip to England, his ship HMS Porpoise and the accompanying Cato ran aground on a coral reef off the Queensland coast. Flinders set off for Sydney in an open cutter, at a distance of , where the Governor sent ships back to rescue the crew from Wreck Reef.

As a medical practitioner in Tombstone, Arizona Territory, Goodfellow treated numerous bullet wounds to both lawmen and outlaws. He recorded several significant medical firsts throughout his career, including performing the first documented laparotomy for treating an abdominal gunshot wound and the first perineal prostatectomy to remove an enlarged prostate. He also pioneered the use of spinal anesthesia and sterile techniques in treating gunshot wounds and is regarded as the first civilian trauma surgeon. Goodfellow was known as a pugnacious, \\"brilliant and versatile\\" physician with wide-ranging interests. He not only practiced medicine but also conducted research into the venom of Gila monsters; published the first surface rupture map of an earthquake in North America; interviewed Geronimo; and played a role in brokering a peace settlement in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. He was a skilled boxer, and in his first year at the United States Naval Academy he became the Academy's boxing champion, though he was soon dismissed for his involvement in a hazing incident against the first African-American to attend the institution. In 1889, he got into a fight with another man and stabbed him, but was found to have acted in self-defense. Goodfellow treated Virgil Earp and Morgan Earp after they were wounded in the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral. His testimony later helped absolve the Earps and Doc Holliday of murder charges for having shot and killed three outlaw cowboys during the gunfight. He treated Virgil again when he was maimed in an ambush and rushed to Morgan's side when he was mortally wounded by an assassin. Goodfellow left Tombstone in 1889 and established a successful practice in Tucson before moving to San Francisco in 1899 and opening a medical office there. He lost his practice and all of his personal belongings in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and subsequently returned to the Southwest, where he became the Chief Surgeon for the Southern Pacific Railroad in Mexico. He fell ill in 1910 and died later that year in Los Angeles. Early life and education Goodfellow's mother returned to San Francisco aboard the Pacific Mail Steamship Company ship S.S. Golden Gate Goodfellow's father, Milton J. Goodfellow, came to California in 1853 to mine for gold. His mother, Amanda Baskin Goodfellow, followed two years later by boat, mule across the Isthmus of Panama, and then again by boat, arriving in San Francisco on the steamship S.S. Golden Gate. Goodfellow was born on December 23, 1855 in Downieville, California, then one of the largest cities in the state. His parents also had two daughters, Mary Catherine (\\"Kitty\\") and Bessie. His father became a mining engineer and maintained an interest in medicine. Goodfellow grew up around California Gold Rush mining camps and developed a deep interest in both mining and medicine. When he was 12, his parents sent him across the country to a private school in Pennsylvania. He returned to California two years later where he attended the California Military Academy in Oakland. He was then accepted to the University of California at Berkeley, where he studied civil engineering for one year before he applied to the United States Naval Academy. In 1870, he was living with his family in Treasure City, Nevada, where his father was a mining superintendent. =Dismissed from Naval Academy= Goodfellow declined a Congressional appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point and instead accepted an appointment from Nevada congressional representative C.W. Kendall to attend the United States Naval Academy, arriving there in June 1872. He became the school's resident boxing champion and was well-accepted by his fellow midshipmen. Like many of his fellow cadets, he took exception to the presence of the Academy's first black cadet, John H. Conyers. While marching, Goodfellow and another cadet began kicking and punching Conyers, who had been shunned and constantly and brutally harassed since his arrival. Goodfellow later knocked Conyers down some stairs. News of the incidents and the constant hazing experienced by Conyers leaked to the newspapers, and a three-man board was convened to investigate the attacks. Goodfellow denied any wrongdoing and Conyers claimed he could not identify any of his attackers. The board nonetheless concluded that \\"His persecutors are left then without any excuse or palliation except the inadmissible one of prejudice.\\" The review board believed the Academy needed to give Conyers a fair chance at succeeding on his own merits, and recommended that strong measures should be taken. In December 1872, Goodfellow and two other students were dismissed from the Academy. Goodfellow immediately set about trying to get reinstated. His mother Amanda wrote a personal letter to First Lady Julia Grant, who was known to consider blacks as inferior and whose family had owned slaves before the Civil War. Amanda closed her letter by reminding the first lady of their mutual friends. Goodfellow also appealed to his mother's uncle and United States Attorney Robert Baskin for assistance. Baskin interceded with his friend, President Ulysses S. Grant, who promised to reinstate Goodfellow, but the uncle left his office and Grant was busy seeking reelection. None of the efforts for reinstatement proved fruitful. =Medical education= Concerned about disappointing his father, Goodfellow sought out his cousin, Dr. T.H. Lashells, in Meadville, Pennsylvania, and read for medicine. He found he had a ready aptitude for the medical field and moved to Cleveland, Ohio, where an uncle lived. He attended Wooster University Medical School and on February 23, 1876, he graduated with honors. Goodfellow briefly opened a medical practice in Oakland. He was soon invited by his father to join him in Yavapai County, Arizona Territory, where Milton was a mining executive for Peck, Mine and Mill. Goodfellow worked in Prescott as the company physician for the next two years until he secured permission to serve with George Armstrong Custer's 7th Cavalry. His orders to join the unit were delayed, however, and he missed the Battle of the Little Bighorn on June 25, 1876, at which most of the unit was destroyed. Instead, Goodfellow joined the U.S. Army as acting assistant surgeon at Fort Whipple in Prescott. In 1879, he became for a brief period the contract surgeon at Fort Lowell near Tucson. Family On November 4, 1876, Goodfellow married Katherine (\\"Kate\\") Colt, daughter of Henry Tracy Colt, the proprietor of Meadville's Colt House, whom he had met while reading medicine in Meadville. Ironically, she was a cousin to Samuel Colt, inventor of the Colt revolver, a weapon that would later play a significant role in Goodfellow's medical practice. The Goodfellows left Meadville immediately after they were married, during the week of November 9, 1876, and traveled to Oakland, California. The Goodfellows had a daughter, Edith, born on October 22, 1879 in Oakland. They also had a son, George Milton, born in May 1882 in Tombstone, Arizona Territory, who died from \\"general bleeding\\" on July 18. Kate Goodfellow died on August 16, 1891, at her mother-in-law's home in Oakland. Goodfellow and his daughter Edith caught the train to Oakland from Benson, Arizona, and when his wife died, he and Edith returned to Tombstone before he relocated to Tucson and took over the practice of his deceased friend, Dr. John C. Handy. Goodfellow married again, to Mary Elizabeth, sometime before March 1906. Medical practice in Tombstone A cabinet photograph of Dr. Goodfellow by C.S. Fly, a noted Tombstone, Arizona Territory photographer Goodfellow arrived in Tombstone in 1880 as the town was booming during its silver mining peak and practiced there for 11 years Dr. Goodfellow's office was on the second floor of the Crystal Palace Saloon, seen here in 1885 In 1880, Goodfellow decided to open his own medical practice. On September 15, he canceled his Army contract and he and his wife relocated to the silver mining boomtown of Tombstone, in Cochise County, Arizona Territory. The town was less than a year old but its population had exploded from about 100 residents in March 1879, when it consisted mostly of wooden shacks and tents; by the fall of 1879 more than a thousand hardy miners and merchants lived in a canvas-and-matchstick camp built on top of the richest silver strike in the United States, and by the time Goodfellow arrived, the town had a population of more than 2,000. There were already 12 doctors practicing in Tombstone, but only Goodfellow and three others had medical school diplomas. At age 25, Goodfellow opened an office on the second floor of the Crystal Palace Saloon, one of the most luxurious saloons in the West. It was also the location of offices for other notable officials, including County Coroner Dr. H.M. Mathews, Deputy U.S. Marshal Virgil Earp, attorney George W. Berry, Cochise County Sheriff Johnny Behan, and Justice of the Peace Wells Spicer. When he was not busy tending to patients, Goodfellow walked down the outside stairs to the saloon below, where he spent many hours drinking, playing faro, and betting on horse races, foot races, wrestling and boxing matches. He reportedly got along well with all of the town's diverse social classes, from the hardscrabble miners to the wealthy elite, as well as characters like the notoriously drunk lawyer Allen English. Goodfellow lost his office when the saloon and most of downtown Tombstone burned to the ground during a large fire on May 26, 1882\\\\. The building was quickly rebuilt and the Crystal Palace earned a reputation for its gambling, entertainment, food and the best brands of wines, liquors, and cigars available 24 hours a day. Goodfellow cared for the indigent and was reimbursed by the county at the rate of $8,000 to $12,000 per year. Tombstone was a dangerous frontier town at the time and the scene of considerable conflict that produced many of Goodfellow's patients. Most of the leading cattlemen as well as numerous local outlaws, including the Cowboys, were Confederate sympathizers and Democrats from Southern states, especially Missouri and Texas. The mine and business owners, miners, city lawmen including brothers Virgil, Morgan, and Wyatt Earp, and most of the other townspeople were largely Republicans from the Northern states. There was also the fundamental conflict over resources and land, of traditional, Southern- style, ‚Äúsmall government‚Äù agrarianism of the rural Cowboys contrasted to Northern-style industrial capitalism. The Tombstone Daily Journal asked in March 1881 how a hundred outlaws could terrorize the best system of government in the world, asking, \\"Can not the marshal summon a posse and throw the ruffians out?\\" Goodfellow later famously described Tombstone as the \\"condensation of wickedness.\\" =Treatment of O.K. Corral lawmen= Virgil Earp Morgan Earp During the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral on October 26, 1881, Deputy U.S. Marshal Virgil Earp was shot through the calf and Assistant Deputy U.S. Marshal Morgan Earp was shot across both shoulder blades. Doc Holliday was grazed by a bullet. Goodfellow treated both Earps' wounds. Cowboy Billy Clanton, who had been mortally wounded in the shootout, asked someone to remove his boots before he died; Goodfellow was present and obliged. After the gunfight, Ike Clanton filed murder charges against the Earps and Doc Holliday. Goodfellow reviewed Dr. H.M. Mathew's autopsy reports on the three outlaw Cowboys the Earps and Holiday had killed: Billy Clanton and brothers Tom and Frank McLaury. Goodfellow's testimony about the nature of Billy Clanton's wounds during the hearing supported the defendants' version of events, that Billy's arm could not have been positioned holding his coats open by the lapels or raised in the air, as witnesses loyal to the Cowboys testified. Goodfellow‚Äôs testimony was helpful in exonerating the Earps and the judge ruled that the lawmen had acted in self-defense. Goodfellow treated Virgil Earp again two months later, on December 28, 1881, after he was ambushed. At about 11:30 PM that night, three men hid in an unfinished building across Allen Street from the Cosmopolitan Hotel where the Earps were staying for mutual support and protection. They shot Virgil as he walked from the Oriental Saloon to his room, hitting him in the back and left arm with three loads of double-barreled buckshot from about . Goodfellow advised Virgil that the arm ought to be amputated, but Virgil refused. Goodfellow operated on Virgil in the Cosmopolitan Hotel using the medical tools he had in his bag, and asked George Parsons and another fellow to fetch some supplies from the hospital. Virgil had a longitudinal fracture of the humerus and elbow that could not be repaired, requiring Goodfellow to remove more than of shattered humerus bone from Virgil's left arm, leaving him permanently crippled. The next victim of the feud between the Cowboys and the Earps was Morgan Earp. At 10:50 PM on March 18, 1882, Morgan was playing a round of billiards at the Campbell & Hatch Billiard Parlor against owner Bob Hatch. Dan Tipton, Sherman McMaster, and Wyatt Earp watched, having also received death threats that same day. An unknown assailant shot Morgan through a glass-windowed, locked door that opened onto a dark alley between Allen and Fremont Streets. Morgan was struck in the back on the left of his spine and the bullet exited the front of his body near his gall bladder before lodging in the thigh of mining foreman George A.B. Berry. Morgan was mortally wounded and could not stand even with assistance. They laid him on a nearby lounge where he died within the hour. Drs. Matthews, Millar, and Goodfellow all examined Morgan. Even Goodfellow, recognized in the United States as the nation's leading expert at treating abdominal gunshot wounds, concluded that Morgan's wounds were fatal. As County Coroner, Goodfellow conducted Morgan Earp's autopsy. He found the bullet \\"entering the body just to the left of the spinal column in the region of the left kidney emerging on the right side of the body in the region of the gall bladder. It certainly injured the great vessels of the body causing hemorrhage which undoubtedly causes death. It also injured the spinal column. It passed through the left kidney and also through the loin.‚Äù Berry recovered from his wound. =Treatment of Cowboys= Goodfellow treated outlaws as well as lawmen, including a number of the notorious Cochise County Cowboys active in the Tombstone area during the 1880s. On May 26, 1881, the Arizona Daily Star reported that Curly Bill Brocius was drunk when he got into an argument with Lincoln County War veteran Jim Wallace, who had insulted Brocius' friend and ally, Tombstone Deputy Marshal Billy Breakenridge. Brocius took offense and even though Wallace apologized, Brocius threatened to kill him. When Wallace left, Curly Bill followed him and Wallace shot him though the cheek and neck. Goodfellow treated Brocius, who recovered after several weeks. Marshal Breakenridge arrested Wallace but the court ruled he had acted in self- defense. Quoted from the May 26, 1881 edition of the Arizona Daily Citizen. Goodfellow was noted for his wry humor. Once, a gambler named McIntire was shot and killed during an argument over a card game; Goodfellow performed an autopsy on the man and wrote in his report that he had done \\"the necessary assessment work and found the body full of lead, but too badly punctured to hold whiskey.\\" =County Coroner= Tombstone citizens lynched John Heath (also spelled Heith) on February 22, 1884\\\\. As County Coroner, Goodfellow ruled he died of \\"strangulation, self-inflicted or otherwise.\\" On the morning of December 8, 1883, a group of five outlaw Cowboys robbed the Goldwater & Castaneda Mercantile in Bisbee, Arizona, which was rumored to be holding the $7,000 payroll for the Copper Queen Mine. But the payroll had not yet arrived, and the outlaws decided to steal whatever they could take from the safe and the employees and customers. They stole between $900 and $3,000 along with a gold watch and jewelry. In what became known as the Bisbee massacre, some of the robbers waiting outside began shooting passersby, killing four people, including a pregnant woman and her unborn child. John Heath (sometimes spelled Heith) had been a cattle rustler in Texas, but since arriving in Arizona he had served briefly as a Cochise County deputy sheriff and had also opened a saloon. When the five bandits were caught, they quickly implicated Heath as the man who had planned the hold-up. He was arrested and tried separately from the other five, who were convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to hang. Heath was convicted of second-degree murder and conspiracy to commit robbery, and the judge could reluctantly sentence him only to a life term at the Yuma Territorial Prison. The citizens of Tombstone were outraged and broke into the jail, forcibly removing Heath and stringing him up from a nearby telegraph pole. Heath's last words were: \\"I have faced death too many times to be disturbed when it actually comes. ... Dont mutilate my body or shoot me full of holes!\\" Goodfellow, who was present at Heath's hanging, was County Coroner and responsible for determining the exact cause of death. His wry conclusion reflected the popular sentiment of the town. He ruled that Heath died from ‚Äú...emphysema of the lungs which might have been, and probably was, caused by strangulation, self-inflicted or otherwise, as in accordance with the medical evidence.‚Äù Authority on gunshot wounds Goodfellow is today remembered for having pioneered the practical use of sterile techniques in treating gunshot wounds by washing the patient's wound and his hands with lye soap or whisky. He simultaneously became America's leading authority on gunshot wounds and was widely recognized for his skill as a surgeon. On July 2, 1881, President James Garfield was shot by assassin Charles J. Guiteau. One bullet was thought later to have possibly lodged near his liver but could not be found.Candice Millard, Destiny of the Republic. Location 4060 Standard medical practice at the time called for physicians to insert their unsterilized fingers into the wound to probe and locate the path of the bullet. Neither the germ theory nor Dr. Joseph Lister's technique for \\"antisepsis surgery\\" using dilute carbolic acid, which had been first demonstrated in 1865, much less surgically opening abdominal cavities to repair gunshot wounds, had yet been accepted as standard practice by prevailing medical authorities. Sixteen doctors attended to Garfield and most probed the wound with their fingers or dirty instruments. Historians agree that massive infection was a significant factor in President Garfield's death two months later. On July 4, two days after the President was shot, a miner outside Tombstone was shot in the abdomen with a .32-caliber Colt revolver. Goodfellow was able to treat the man nine days later, on July 13, 1881, when he performed the first laparotomy to treat a bullet wound. Goodfellow noted that the abdomen showed symptoms of a serious infection, including distension from gas, tumefaction, redness and tenderness. The man's intestines were covered with a large amount of \\"purulent stinking lymph.\\" The patient's small and large intestine were perforated by six holes, wounds very similar to President Garfield's injury. Goodfellow followed Lister's recommended procedure for sterilizing everything: his hands, instruments, sponges, and the area around the wound. He successfully repaired the miner's wounds and the miner, unlike the President, survived. A laparotomy is still the standard procedure for treating abdominal gunshot wounds today. Goodfellow often traveled many hours to treat cowboys miles from Tombstone and performed surgery under primitive conditions. He traveled to Bisbee, from Tombstone, in January 1889 to treat a patient struck in the abdomen by a bullet from a .44 Colt. At midnight, he operated on the patient stretched out on a billiards table. Goodfellow removed a .45-caliber bullet, washed out the cavity with two gallons of hot water, folded the intestines back into position, stitched the wound closed with silk thread, and ordered the patient to take to a hard bed for recovery. He wrote about the operation: \\"I was entirely alone having no skilled assistant of any sort, therefore was compelled to depend for aid upon willing friends who were present‚Äîthese consisting mostly of hard-handed miners just from their work on account of the fight. The anesthetic was administered by a barber, lamps held, hot water brought and other assistance rendered by others.\\" The man lived for 18 hours after surgery, long enough to write out his will, but died of shock. =Thesis on abdominal wounds= Goodfellow circa 1885 Goodfellow was the first physician known to operate successfully on abdominal gunshot wounds, which had been previously considered an all-but- certain death sentence. During his career, he published 13 articles about abdominal bullet wounds based on treatments and techniques he developed while practicing medicine in Tombstone. His articles were laced with colorful commentary describing his medical practice in the primitive west. He wrote, \\"In the spring of 1881 I was a few feet distant from a couple of individuals [Luke Short and Charlie Storms] who were quarreling. They began shooting. The first shot took effect, as was afterward ascertained, in the left breast of one of them, who, after being shot, and while staggering back some 12 feet, cocked and fired his pistol twice, his second shot going into the air, for by that time he was on his back.\\" He included a description of the bullet wounds he most often treated: \\"The .44 and .45 caliber Colt revolver, .45-60 and .44-40 Winchester rifles and carbines were the toys with which our festive or obstreperous citizens delight themselves.\\" The .45-caliber Colt Peacemaker round contained 40 grains of black powder that shot a thumb-sized, 250-grain slug at the relatively slow velocity of 910 feet per second. But the large bullet could smash through a pine board at . Goodfellow saw the effect of these large-caliber weapons up close and was very familiar with their powerful impact. In an article titled \\"Cases of Gunshot Wound of the Abdomen Treated by Operation\\" in the Southern California Practitioner of 1889 he wrote, \\"the maxim is, shoot for the guts; knowing death is certain, yet sufficiently lingering and agonizing to afford a plenary sense of gratification to the victor in the contest.\\" His article described five patients with penetrating abdominal wounds, four of whom survived, and the laparotomies he completed on all of them. He wrote, \\"it is inexcusable and criminal to neglect to operate upon a case of gunshot wound in the abdominal cavity.\\" Goodfellow learned that the caliber of the bullet determined whether a medical procedure was needed. If the bullet was .32-caliber or larger, it \\"inflicted enough damage to necessitate immediate operation.\\" He noted, \\"Given a gunshot wound of the abdominal cavity with one of the above caliber balls [.44 and .45], if the cavity be not opened within an hour, the patient by reason of hemorrhage is beyond any chance of recovery.‚Äù W.W. Whitmore wrote in an October 9, 1932, article in the Arizona Daily Star that Goodfellow \\"presumably had a greater practice in gunshot wounds of the abdomen than any other man in civil life in the country.\\" =Conceived of bulletproof fabrics= Faro dealer Luke Short shot Charlie Storms in the heart, but he did not bleed. Dr. Goodfellow later found a silk handkerchief had stopped the bullet. On February 25, 1881, faro dealer Luke Short and professional gambler and gunfighter Charlie Storms got into an argument in Tombstone. Storms had successfully defended himself several times with his pistol, but had inaccurately sized Short up as someone he could \\"slap in the face without expecting a return.\\" Bat Masterson initially defused a confrontation between the two men, but Storms returned, yanked Short off the sidewalk, and pulled his cut-off Colt .45 pistol. Luke Short was quicker and pulled his own pistol, shooting Charlie Storms twice before he hit the ground. The first shot was from such close range it reportedly set fire to Storms' shirt. Short's actions were ruled self-defense. In an autopsy of Storms' body, Goodfellow found that he had been shot in the heart but was surprised to see \\"not a drop of blood\\" exiting the wound, and noted that the bullet that struck Storms would ordinarily have passed through the body. He discovered that the bullet had ripped through the man's clothes and into a folded silk handkerchief in his breast pocket. He extracted the intact bullet from the wound and found two thicknesses of silk wrapped around it and two tears where it had struck the vertebral column. Goodfellow showed the slightly flattened .45-caliber bullet and bloody handkerchief to George Parsons. Another case that attracted his attention was an incident when Assistant City Marshal Billy Breakenridge shot Billy Grounds from with a shotgun, killing him. Goodfellow examined Billy and found that two buckshot grains had penetrated Billy's thick Mexican felt hat band, which was embroidered with silver wire. These two buckshot and two others penetrated his head and flattened against the posterior wall of the skull, and others penetrated the face and chest. He also noted that one of the grains had passed through two heavy wool shirts and a blanket-lined canvas coat and vest before coming to rest deep in his chest. But Goodfellow was fascinated to find, in the folds of a Chinese silk handkerchief around Grounds' neck, two shotgun pellets but no holes. The Tombstone Epitaph reported, \\"A silken armor may be the next invention.\\" In a third instance, he described a man who had been shot through the right side of the neck, narrowly missing his carotid artery. A portion of the man's silk neckerchief had been carried into the wound by the bullet, preventing a more serious injury, but the scarf was undamaged. To Goodfellow, the remarkable protection offered by the silk was plainly evident from these examples, with the second case of the buckshot perhaps best illustrating the protection afforded by silk. In 1887, Goodfellow documented these cases in an article titled \\"Notes on the Impenetrability of Silk to Bullets\\" for the Southern California Practitioner. He experimented with designs for bullet-resistant clothing made of multiple layers of silk. By 1900, gangsters were wearing $800 silk vests to protect themselves. In 2018, the US military began conducting research into the feasibility of using artificial silk as body armor.Air Force scientists study artificial silk for body armor, parachutes =Other medical firsts= Goodfellow was an innovative physician who was forced to experiment with differing methods than those utilized by physicians in more civilized eastern practices. He pioneered the idea of treating tuberculosis patients by exposing them to Arizona's dry climate. Along with performing the first laparotomy, Goodfellow recorded several other surgical firsts, including performing the first appendectomy in the Arizona Territory. During 1891 at St. Mary‚Äôs Hospital in Tucson, he performed what many consider to be the first perineal prostatectomy, an operation he developed to treat bladder problems by removing the enlarged prostate. He traveled extensively across the United States over the next decade, training other physicians to perform the procedure. Among these was Dr. Hugh Young, a well-known and respected urology professor at Johns Hopkins University. Goodfellow completed 78 operations and only two patients died, a remarkable level of success for the time period. He was among the first surgeons anywhere, let alone on the frontier of the United States, to implement the use of spinal anesthesia, which he improvised by crushing cocaine crystals in spinal fluid and re-injecting the mixture into the patient's spine. Other scientific pursuits Goodfellow on El Rosillo, a gift from Mexican President Porfirio D√≠az In addition to his medical practice and related studies, Goodfellow had other scientific interests. He published articles about rattlesnake and Gila monster bites in the Scientific American and the Southern California Practitioner. He was among the first to research the actual effects of Gila monster venom when the lizard was widely feared for its deadly bite. The Scientific American reported in 1890 that \\"The breath is very fetid, and its odor can be detected at some little distance from the lizard. It is supposed that this is one way in which the monster catches the insects and small animals which form a part of its food supply‚Äîthe foul gas overcoming them.\\" Goodfellow offered to pay local residents $5.00 for Gila monster specimens. He bought several and collected more on his own. In 1891, he purposefully provoked one of his captive lizards into biting him on his finger. The bite made him ill and he spent the next five days in bed, but he completely recovered. When Scientific American ran another ill-founded report on the lizard's ability to kill people, he wrote in reply and described his own studies and personal experience. He wrote that he knew several people who had been bitten by Gila monsters but had not died from the bite, suggesting that the bite was not necessarily fatal, as was commonly believed at the time. =1887 Sonora earthquake= Sketch by Dr. George Goodfellow of the 1887 Sonora earthquake fault zone based on several weeks of field study. The Arizona‚ÄìSonora border is shown at top. When the Bavispe earthquake struck the Mexican state of Sonora on May 3, 1887, it destroyed most of the adobe houses in Bavispe and killed 42 of the town's 700 residents. Goodfellow spoke excellent Spanish and he loaded his wagon with medical supplies and rode to aid survivors. The townspeople named him El Doctor Santo (\\"The Sainted Doctor\\"), and in recognition of his humanitarian contributions, Mexican President Porfirio D√≠az presented him with a silver medal that had belonged to Emperor Maximilian and a horse named El Rosillo. Goodfellow was fascinated by the earthquake and began a personal study of its effects. He noted that it was very difficult to pin down the time of the earthquake due to the absence of timepieces or a nearby railroad and the primitive living standards of the area's residents. Goodfellow returned twice more, the second time in July with Tombstone photographer C.S. Fly, to study and record the effects of the earthquake. He traveled over through the Sierra Madre mountains recording his observations, mostly on foot. The United States Geological Service praised his \\"remarkable and creditable\\" report, describing it as \\"systematic, conscientious, and thorough.\\" On August 12, 1887, he wrote a letter following up on his initial report in the top U.S. scientific journal, Science. It included the first surface rupture map of an earthquake in North America and photographs of the rupture scarp by C.S. Fly. The earthquake was at the time the ‚Äúlongest recorded normal-fault surface rupture in historic time.‚Äù It was later described as an ‚Äúoutstanding study‚Äù and a ‚Äúpioneering achievement‚Äù. Goodfellow simultaneously developed a friendship with Mexican politician Ram√≥n Corral and hosted him in 1904 when he visited San Francisco. Personal reputation Along with being an extremely talented and innovative surgeon, Goodfellow developed a reputation as a hard-drinking, irascible ladies-man. He kept company with some of the courtesans who frequented the Crystal Palace Saloon. He was also known to be a vocal supporter of the Earps, town business owners, and miners, but that did not keep the rural Cowboys from seeking his services during the 11 years his office was located in Tombstone. He delivered babies, set miners' broken bones, treated gunshot wounds to cowboys and lawmen alike, and provided medical care to anyone in need. Tombstone had a large number of silver mines during its peak production period, and Goodfellow entered smoke-filled mining shafts on more than one occasion to help treat trapped and injured miners. The Tombstone Epitaph said Goodfellow had \\"both skill and nerve, both of which were brought into requisition on Contention Hill\\" when he personally rescued unconscious miners in late May 1886. While Goodfellow lived in Tombstone, he was a founder in 1880 of the plush Tombstone Club located on the second floor of the Ritchie Building. The rooms were furnished with reading tables and chairs. The 60 male members had access to more than 70 publications. Goodfellow also helped organize the Tombstone Scientific Society. He was active in other community affairs, and invested in the Huachuca Water Company, which in 1881 built a pipeline from the Huachuca Mountains to Tombstone, along with a community swimming pool. During the Tombstone fire in June 1881, George W. Parsons was helping to tear down a balcony to prevent the fire from spreading when he was struck by the falling wood. Parsons' upper lip and nose were pierced by a splinter of wood, severely flattening and deforming his nose. Goodfellow devised a wire framework and in a series of treatments successfully restored Parsons' nose to his pre-injury profile. He refused payment because Parsons had been hurt as he was assisting others. Goodfellow was not a man to be taken lightly. In August 1889, he got into a fight while drunk during which he stabbed Frank White with a triple- edged, poignard. White was seriously injured but Goodfellow was not arrested, as the judge ruled Goodfellow had acted in self-defense. Later life In 1884, Goodfellow's father was a mining engineer in nearby Fairbank, Arizona, on the railroad line from Tucson to Nogales. His father died in 1887 in San Diego. In 1886, Goodfellow reportedly rode with the U.S. Army while they were attempting to recapture Geronimo after he left the San Carlos Reservation against Army orders. During his escape, he and his warriors killed \\"fourteen Americans dead in the United States and between 500 and 600 Mexicans dead south of the border.\\" After Geronimo was apprehended, Goodfellow, who spoke fluent Spanish and some Apache, befriended Geronimo. =Move to Tucson= When Dr. John C. Handy assaulted his estranged wife's attorney, he was shot in the lower abdomen, and Goodfellow unsuccessfully tried to repair 18 perforations of his intestines By 1890, Tombstone was on the decline. The price of silver had fallen, many of its silver mines had been permanently flooded, and a number of residents had left town. Goodfellow's wife fell ill and died in Oakland, California at her mother-in-law's home in August 1891. Goodfellow and their daughter Edith attended her funeral at his mother's home in Oakland on August 16. At noon on September 24, 1891, Goodfellow‚Äôs good friend and colleague Dr. John C. Handy was shot on the streets of Tucson. Handy had divorced his wife and had recently been trying to evict her from the home the court had granted her. When she hired attorney Francis J. Heney, Handy repeatedly threatened to kill him. He assaulted the attorney on the street that afternoon and Heney shot him in self-defense. Hearing the news, Goodfellow rode by horseback to Benson, Arizona, where he caught a locomotive and caboose, set aside just for him, to Tucson. In an effort to save Handy, he apparently took over the engine from the engineer and drove the train at high speed, covering the in record time. Handy had been attended by Drs. Michael Spencer, John Trail Green, and Hiram W. Fenner until Goodfellow arrived in Tucson at 8:15 PM. He began operating on Handy at about 10:00 PM. He found 18 perforations in Handy‚Äôs intestines, which he immediately set about cleaning and closing. Goodfellow was too late, however, and Handy died at 1:15 AM, before Goodfellow could complete the surgery. After Handy's death, Dr. Goodfellow was invited to take over his Tucson practice, and he and his daughter Edith relocated there. He purchased the old Orndorff Hotel located near present-day City Hall and used it as a hospital. He also practiced at St. Mary's Hospital. In 1891, he operated on the chief surgeon of the Southern Pacific Railroad, who, like Handy, had been shot by his estranged wife's attorney. The surgeon died, and Goodfellow soon after accepted the railroad job, serving from 1891 to 1896. He was appointed by Governor Louis C. Hughes in 1893 as the Arizona Territorial Health Officer, a position he held until 1896. He was living in Los Angeles in 1896 and was listed in the 1897 Los Angeles City Directory. =Further military service= Goodfellow returned to Tucson in 1898 and later that year he became the personal physician to his friend General William \\"Pecos Bill\\" Shafter during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. Appointed as a major, he was in charge of the general's field hospital. Shafter relied on Goodfellow‚Äôs excellent knowledge of the Spanish language to help negotiate the final surrender after the Battle of San Juan Hill. Goodfellow attributed part of his success to a bottle of ‚Äúol‚Äô barleycorn‚Äù he kept handy in his medical kit, which he properly prescribed to himself and Spanish General Jos√© Toral, lending a more convivial atmosphere to the conference. Goodfellow was recognized with a commendation for his service that cited his \\"especially meritorious services professional and military\\". =Practice in San Francisco= In late 1899, Goodfellow moved to San Francisco and established his practice at 771 Sutter St. On January 19, 1900, he was appointed as the surgeon for the Sante Fe Railroad headquartered in San Francisco. He was an active member of the Bohemian Club and attended their summer camp on the Russian River regularly. On February 15, 1900, Wells Fargo Express Agent Jeff Milton, a friend of Goodfellow, arrived on board a train in Fairbank, near Benson, Arizona. Former lawman-turned-outlaw Burt Alvord and five other robbers attempted to rob an arriving train of its cash. Milton was seriously wounded in the left arm and the railroad dispatched a special engine and boxcar to transport Milton from Benson to Tucson for treatment. In Tucson, Dr. H.W. Fenner tied the shattered bone together with piano wire. When the wound failed to heal, he sent Milton to San Francisco where he could be seen by experts at the Southern Pacific Hospital there. They wanted to amputate his arm at the elbow, but he refused and got a ride to Dr. Goodfellow's office. Goodfellow successfully cleaned and treated Milton's wound but told him he would never be able to use the arm again. Milton's arm healed but was of little use and noticeably shorter than his right arm. In April 1906, at the time of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, Goodfellow had remarried and was living at the St. Francis Hotel. He lost all of his records and personal manuscripts in the hotel and his office due to the earthquake and subsequent fires. His finances were ruined and Goodfellow returned to the Southern Pacific Railroad, where he was Chief Surgeon in Guaymas, Mexico, from 1907 to 1910. =Death= Goodfellow fell ill in the summer of 1910 with an illness which he had reportedly been exposed to during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. He sought treatment from his sister Mary's husband, Dr. Charles W. Fish, in Los Angeles. Over the next six months his health gradually declined, and soon a nervous disorder prevented him from performing surgery. He was hospitalized for several weeks at the end of 1910 at Angelus Hospital in Los Angeles. Goodfellow declared he did not want to live any longer and on December 7, 1910, he died. His brother-in-law gave his cause of death as \\"multiple neuritis\\". His obituary attributed his death to a nervous breakdown. However, a local urologist and others thought alcoholism may have played a role in his death. Goodfellow was buried in the Angelus-Rosedale Cemetery in Los Angeles. Legacy Goodfellow is credited as the United States' first civilian trauma surgeon. His pioneering work in the treatment of abdominal wounds, specifically those caused by gunshots, as well as his recognition of the significance of sterile technique at a time when much of the medical establishment had not yet accepted it as a surgical necessity, has contributed to his modern image as a physician well ahead of his time. Decades after his death, by the late 1950s, mandatory laparotomy had become and remains the standard of care for managing patients with abdominal penetrating trauma. To recognize financial supporters, the University of Arizona School of Medicine established the George E. Goodfellow Society.

History  Ibiza Old Town with Cathedral In 1234, the future conquerors of the island, Guillermo de Montgr√≠, Peter of Portugal and Nuno San√ß, signed an agreement stipulating that establishing a parish dedicated to Saint Mary would be one of their first obligations upon conquest. As a result, the parish was established once the City of Eivissa was taken on August 8, 1235. At first worship took place in an already-existing building, perhaps a Muslim mosque adapted for use by Christians. The existing structure is the result of numerous changes to the original building, including additions to the east side that include a trapezoidal bell tower and a polygonal apse with its five chapels. It is a very solid building, built in the Catalan Gothic style in the 16th century. In 1435, the church had five chapels, dedicated to Saint James and Saint Michael, to Saint Tecla and Saint Anthony, to Saint John Baptist and Saint John Evangelist and to Saint Peter and Saint Paul. A new nave was built at the end of the 15th century, finished off with the Fonda chapel made by the Francolins in 1538. In the 18th century, the church was heavily refurbished, as a result of the bad condition of the structure. The works were directed by Jaume Espinosa and Pere Ferro, who were the obrers de la vila (Town Builders). The renovations took place between 1715 and 1728. In 1782, Pope Pius VI established the episcopal see of Ibiza and the medieval church, renovated, became the Cathedral. It nonetheless remains perpetually suffragan to Tarragona‚Äîas it had been as a parish‚Äîbecause of the Catalan origin of its old Christian conquerors. Today, the cathedral keeps many works of art, among which are several notable pieces: a Gothic monstrance of golden silver, made by Francesc Mart√≠ in 1399, two Gothic panels of Saint Tecla and Saint Anthony, painted by Francesc Cornes in the 14th century, and another two‚Äîfrom the 15th century‚Äîby the master Valent√≠ Montoliu that represent Saint James and Saint Matthew.

Spanning both Jewfish Creek and Lake Surprise, it carries the Overseas Highway (U.S. Route 1) between the Florida Keys and the Florida mainland. The bridge is tall and opened in 2008, replacing a small drawbridge. History Henry Flagler's private rail car, Rambler, crossing Jewfish Creek on the Overseas Railroad Jewfish Creek Drawbridge (1944-2008) The original Jewfish Creek beam bridge opened for traffic in 1944 along with the current stretch of the Overseas Highway between Florida City and Key Largo (locally known as the 18 Mile Stretch). Prior to this, the Overseas Highway was connected to the mainland via the nearby Card Sound Bridge (which at the time was also a small drawbridge). The current route was built along the original right of way of the Overseas Railroad, which shortened the driving distance between Florida City and Key Largo by nearly . The United States Navy, which continues to have a large presence in Key West, sought an improved access to the mainland during World War II, which is the reason the Overseas Highway was rerouted onto the former railroad right of way. The original Card Sound Bridge was closed to vehicular traffic after the completion of the Jewfish Creek Bridge and its remains were destroyed by a fire shortly afterward. The current Card Sound Bridge opened in 1969, restoring the original route and giving the Florida Keys two vehicular accesses to the mainland.History of Overseas Highway The Jewfish Creek drawbridge was replaced by the current bridge on May 22, 2008, as a part of larger $300 million project to reconstruct the entire stretch of U.S. 1 between Florida City and Key Largo. In addition to the drawbridge, the current bridge allowed for the removal of the Lake Surprise Causeway, which dated back to the days of the railroad, restoring the natural water flow into Florida Bay. The project also included the addition of a jersey barrier between the northbound and southbound lanes throughout, passing lanes in various locations, and the replacement of the non-functional C-111 canal drawbridge with a small fixed bridge. Features The current structure is tall. It carries two lanes separated by a Jersey barrier, and also features outside berms to prevent road pollutants from entering Florida Bay.

Early life and education  Alek Rapoport spent his childhood in Kiev (Ukraine SSR). During Stalin's \\"purges\\" both his parents were arrested. His father was shot and his mother spent ten years in a Siberian labor camp. Rapoport lived with his aunt. At the beginning of World War II, he was evacuated to the city of Ufa (the Bashkir Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic). A time of extreme loneliness, cold, hunger and deprivation, this period also marked the beginning of Rapoport's drawing studies. After the war, Rapoport lived in Chernovtsy (Western Ukraine), a city with a certain European flair. At the local House of Folk Arts, he found his first art teacher, E.Sagaidachny (1886‚Äì1961), a former member of the nonconformist artist groups Union of the Youth (Soyuz Molodyozhi) and Donkey's Tail, popular during the 1910s‚Äì1920s.Bowlt, John. Crossroads: Modernism in Ukraine 1910s‚Äì1930s. Nashe naslediye, No. 82, Moscow, 2007 His other art teacher was I. Beklemisheva (1903‚Äì1988). Impressed by Rapoport's talent, she later (1950) organized his move to Leningrad, where he entered the famous V.Serov School of Art (the former School of the Imperial Society for the Promotion of Arts, OPKh, later the Tavricheskaya Art School). His association with this school lasted eight years, first as a student, and then, from 1965 to 1968, as a teacher. With \\"Socialist realism\\" the only official style during this time, most of the art school's faculty had to conceal any prior involvement in non-conformist art movements. Ya.K.Shablovsky, V.M.Sudakov, A.A.Gromov introduced their students to Constructivism only through clandestine means. The school emphasized fundamental drawing skills and an appreciation for Italian Renaissance art. Additionally, Rapoport continued to educate himself, spending hours at the Hermitage Museum, copying paintings of the Old Masters, and studying art at public libraries. Rapoport's generation expressed an increasing interest in contemporary art. Expositions of French Impressionists came to Leningrad, followed by other exhibitions of modern art from various European countries. This new freedom proved a powerful source of ideas. His last year in school was interrupted by the military draft. He was stationed in Birobidzhan (the Jewish Autonomous Oblast), where he continued to draw and paint during his free time, making a series of sketches vividly depicting scenes of a soldier's everyday life and creating the oil painting The Taking of a Hill for a Khabarovsk museum. After his military service, Rapoport returned to the Serov School of Art. His diploma work Laying the Wreaths on the Field of Mars (1958), was denounced as \\"formalist,\\" a stigma which followed him from then on. Over the next four years (1959‚Äì1963) Rapoport studied stage design at the Leningrad Institute of Theater, Music and Cinema under the supervision of the famous artist and stage director N.P.Akimov. Akimov taught a unique course based on theories of Russian Suprematism and Constructivism, while encouraging his graduate students to apply their knowledge to every field of art design. Despite differences in personal artistic taste with Akimov, who was drawn to Vermeer and Dal√≠, Rapoport was influenced by Akimov's personality and liberalism, as well as the logical style of his art. In 1963, Rapoport graduated from the institute. His highly acclaimed MFA work involved the stage and costume design for I.Babel's play Sunset. In preparation, he traveled to the southwest regions of the Soviet Union, where he accumulated many objects of Judaic iconography from former ghettos, disappearing synagogues and old cemeteries. He wandered Odessa in search of Babel's characters and the atmosphere of his books. Rapoport considered himself a practitioner of Russian Constructivism with roots in ancient Mediterranean and Byzantine art forms. He was strongly influenced by Tartu's school of structural semiotics and by its founder, Yuri Lotman. Concurrently, Rapoport pursued a deep study of Byzantine art and icons. His final studies while in Russia concentrated on the works of the Russian Orthodox priest Father Pavel Florensky and the art historian Lev Zhegin.  Career  After graduation, Rapoport's life was full of a variety of activities, but his most important goal was to try to combine official art with his own creative ideas. The greatest opportunities for this came through work for the theater in the town of Volkhov, as well as at Houses of Culture. He made sketches for sets and costumes for various plays such as Brecht's The Good Woman from Szechuan and Fear and Misery of the Third Reich, Pushkin's The Queen of Spades, Brandon Thomas's Charley's Aunt and V.Ivanov's Armored Train 14-69. At this time, Rapoport also worked as an artist's assistant at \\"Lenfilm\\" and as a book designer and illustrator for various publishing houses. However, his greatest satisfaction came from teaching specialty courses in composition, design and human anatomy at the Serov Art School. He organized a new liberal course in technical aesthetics, introducing his students to Lotman's theory of semiotics, the Modulor of Le Corbusier, the Bauhaus school, Russian Constructivism, Russian icons and contemporary Western art. As a result of his \\"radicalism,\\" Rapoport was fired for \\"ideological conspiracy.\\" Thereafter, Rapoport channeled all his energy into his own creative work. His main projects centered on Biblical themes, Anti-Semitism and subjects of everyday life. He sought to cultivate himself as Jewish artist. This became particularly noticeable after the Six-Day War, when the Israeli victory led intellectuals, including the Jewish intelligentsia, to feel a heightened interest in Jewish culture and its Biblical roots. Rapoport's works of this period include Three Figures, a series of images of Talmudic Scholars, and works dealing with anti-Semitism. = 1970s = In the 1970s Rapoport joined the non-conformist movement, which opposed the dogmas of \\"Socialist realism\\" in art, along with Soviet censorship. The movement sought to preserve the traditions of Russian iconography and the Constructivist/Suprematist style of the 1910s. Despite the authorities' persecutions of nonconformist artists (including arrests, forced evictions, terminations of employment, and various forms of routine hassling), they united in a group, \\"TEV ‚Äì Fellowship of Experimental Exhibitions.\\" TEV's exhibitions proved tremendously successful.From Gulag to Glasnost: Nonconformist Art from the Soviet Union. The N&N; Dodge Collection. Thames and Hudson, New York, 1995. In the same period, Rapoport became one of the initiators of another anti-establishment group, ALEF (Union of Leningrad's Jewish Artists). In the United States this group was known as \\"Twelve from the Soviet Underground.\\" 12 FROM THE SOVIET UNDERGROUND. Catalog. Berkeley, CA, 1976 Rapoport's involvement with this group increased tension with the authorities and attracted KGB scrutiny, including \\"friendly conversations,\\" surveillance, detentions and house arrests. It became increasingly dangerous for him to live and work in the USSR. In October 1976, Rapoport with his wife and son were forced to leave Russia. Following the usual path among Russian immigrants of that time, the family traveled through Austria and Italy, then moved to the U.S. They lived in Italy half a year. Despite missing Russia, Rapoport savored his exposure to Italian culture and art, which had intrigued him since childhood. The entire environment strongly inspired his mind and creative work.Rapoport, Alek. Nonconformism Endures (–ù–æ–Ω–∫–æ–Ω—Ñ–æ—Ä–º–∏–∑–º –æ—Å—Ç–∞—ë—Ç—Å—è). St.Petersburg, DEAN, 2003 (in Russian). .

Marsilio Editori, 1977, 10-0463-8 participated in television programs about nonconformist art in the Soviet Union, and created lithographic works continuing his theme of Jewish characters from Babel's play Sunset. In 1977, Rapoport's family was granted U.S. immigration status and settled in San Francisco. With assistance from the Bay Area Council of Soviet Jews (BACSJ), Rapoport traveled to many American cities as a representative of the \\"ALEF\\" group, known in U.S. as \\"12 from the Soviet Underground,\\" accompanying exhibitions of these artists and lecturing.Alek Rapoport. An Artist's Journey. Album, Michael Dunev Gallery, San Francisco, 1998. Rapoport grew up in the anti-religious Soviet environment. An encounter with the New Testament at age 16 led his first creation of religious artwork. Beginning in the 1960s, images of the Biblical prophets emerged as a recurring theme in Rapoport's art.Bernstein, Boris. Rapoportian Space. Canadian-American Slavic Studies. Publisher Charles Schlacks, Vol. 41, No. 2, Summer 2007, California, USA, P. 205-216. His inspiration came from various sources: the stories of the Old and New Testaments, the art of Russian (Byzantine) icons as well as the humanistic art of Renaissance, and Russian religious philosophers such as S.Bulgakov, N.Berdyayev, V.Solovyov. Among this latter group, Rapoport had a special regard for Father Pavel Florensky. Rapoport dedicated his painting Short Life of Euphrosynos the Cook (1978) to the memory of Florensky, who perished in a Gulag in 1944. For almost nine years, Rapoport was employed as a draftsman- designer of stage equipment, while continuing his own creative work. Initially overwhelmed by a sense of freedom in his new life, he soon came to feel that these liberties restricted more than they permitted, with freedom limited to the narrow views of artists who followed the demands of the market. He experienced difficulty fitting into the American contemporary art mainstream, which he considered frivolous, career-oriented and devoid of any spirituality or artistic merit.Alek Rapoport. An Artist's Journey.Rapoport, Alek. Nonconformism Endures (–ù–æ–Ω–∫–æ–Ω—Ñ–æ—Ä–º–∏–∑–º –æ—Å—Ç–∞—ë—Ç—Å—è). = 1980s = For Rapoport, the 1980s were a time full of creativity and significant life events. He participated in numerous exhibitions in San Francisco and other American cities, sold his paintings in auctions in Europe and the U.S., illustrated Erotic Tales of Old Russia by A.Afanasyev (Scythian Books, Oakland, CA), and traveled to European countries. A visit to Spain made a profound impression on him, confirming a sense of personal connection, even blood ties, with the art and culture of the country of El Greco. Rapoport began a new series of paintings inspired by his experiences in Spain. In 1984, a significant event in Rapoport's life occurred in his meeting with San Francisco gallery owner Michael Dunev,Dunev, Michael. Art of Conscience: The Paintings of Alek Rapoport. ARTS, Eleven one, 1999, New Brighton, MN, USA, P. 36-37 who became his friend and representative, organizing all his exhibitions until the artist's death. Rapoport tried to make a connection to bridge the gap between his art and the American viewers, a goal perhaps reflected in his new series of paintings, Images of San Francisco. While in Russia, Rapoport had concentrated on interior and spiritual subjects; in San Francisco, he broadened his art with new sources. He valued the city's international flavor, theatrical and dramatical image, phantasmal ocean-accented light and geographical structure, capturing these qualities with his characteristic forced spherical perspectives and expressionistic coloration, evoking a sense of a spontaneous theater of everyday life. Images of San Francisco came to constitute a second major body of subjects in Rapoport's art. At the same time, the idea of \\"brotherhood\\" and artists \\"guild\\" had always attracted Rapoport, and he particularly missed this sense of fellowship while in the U.S. Accordingly, in 1992, he organized the group \\"SPSF\\"(Saint Petersburg-San Francisco). SPSF consisted of two artists and two photographers, all St. Petersburg natives who had wound up in San Francisco. The four saw themselves as heirs of the great St. Petersburg cultural tradition, while also having absorbed the new San Francisco environment. Their exhibitions were enthusiastically received by Russians and Americans.Jane, R. Russian Artists at OPTS Art. Asian Art News, Vol. 5, No. 1, January‚ÄìFebruary 1995, San Francisco, CA In 1987, Rapoport was finally able devote himself completely to his creative work. While his subject matter did not change, his works increased in emotional impact and his technical skills became fully developed. = 1990s = Toward the end of the 1980s and beginning of the 1990s, Rapoport completed his most ambitious works on the theme of the Old Testament prophets: Samson Destroying the House of the Philistines (1989), Lamentation and Mourning and Woe (1990), the four paintings Angel and Prophets (1990‚Äì1991) and Three Deeds of Moses (1992). In 1992, the artist's friends in St. Petersburg organized the first exhibition of his works there since his departure into exile, with works patiently gathered from collectors and art museums. This exhibition, held in the City Museum of St. Petersburg and accompanied by headlines such as \\"A St. Petersburg artist returns to his town,\\" was followed by much larger ones in 1993 (St. Petersburg and Moscow),Alek Rapoport. St. Petersburg ‚Äî San Francisco. Catalog. APOLLON, St. Petersburg, 1993 organized in collaboration with Michael Dunev Gallery under the name California Branches ‚Äì Russian Roots. The exhibitions, with an invitation featuring Rapoport's painting Self-portrait as a Mask of Mordecai (1985), marked the artist's first visit to Russia since his departure in 1976. Rapoport had always protested loudly and openly. In Russia, he protested against the rigidity of the system of teaching, against the communist ideology and censorship in art, against the suppression of religious art. He took a leading part in the creation of the dissident art groups TEV and ALEF. For this he was persecuted by the authorities and forced to emigrate. Then, in the U.S., Rapoport protested against commercialism in art, against the dominance of ideas of market over ideas of spirit, against the crushing of religious art by public indifference, against the loss of Judeo-Christian values. \\"In search of these values, I turn again and again to the Old Masters from the Mediterranean region, where at the very outset of Western Civilization, the art of Pictorial Image was born, art in which both the Divine Spirit and the Human Being served as the measure for all things.\\" This was the subject of Rapoport's \\"loud and bitter cry.\\" The last five years of Rapoport's life (1993‚Äì1997) were spent in voluntary seclusion. He did not endure emigration easily. \\"What a pathetic life, everything repeats itself,\\" he said, quoting from the letters of Albrecht D√ºrer, another artist who saw himself as born in the wrong place and time. During these years, Rapoport concentrated on his own creative world. In his own words, he worked not for the sake of art, but because art gave him the means to express himself. He sought to reach the very core and heart of the image, an urge complemented by his ever-present inner desire to attain the ideal. In 1995, he began an association with CIVA (Christians in Visual Arts), participating in the group's exhibitions and conferences. He produced more expressionistic paintings on religious themes, while continuing his ongoing series Images of San Francisco. His works became increasingly spiritual and magically expressive. The art critic V.Baranovsky (Moscow-San Francisco) noted, \\"One can not leave unnoticed the strange power of these paintings, which remind us of the incandescent coals of Old Russian icons.\\" Anastasis-1, 1996 By 1996, the artist almost never left his studio, completing Anastasis 1, based on the apocryphal fourth-century Gospel of Nicodemus. The painting was his final and most personal religious work.  Death  On February 4, 1997, Alek Rapoport died suddenly and unexpectedly in his studio while working on his new painting Trinity.Levintov, Aleksandr. Alek Rapoport and Others. American Russia.

The character was initially conceived in 2009 by head writer Robert Guza Jr., as a previously unknown member of the wealthy Cassadine family looking to wreak havoc on both the Cassadine and Spencer families. However, initial plans for the character's introduction were delayed and completely abandoned by 2010. In 2016, it was announced that All My Children alumnus James Patrick Stuart had joined the cast in the mystery role of Theo ‚Äî who is revealed to be Valentin. Valentin is known for being the most evil of the Cassadine sons, having been disowned by his father at a very young age. At one point, he poisons his stepmother Helena (Constance Towers). Stuart's performance has been met with critical acclaim, having garnered him a Daytime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series in 2020. Storylines In October 2009, a deathly ill Helena Cassadine (Constance Towers) confides in her longtime rival Luke Spencer (Anthony Geary) that she needs his help to fend off her evil stepson Valentin. According to Helena, the illegitimate Valentin had been disowned by his father Mikkos (John Colicos) upon his birth, denying him the privileges of being a Cassadine. Helena contacts Valentin hoping to use him against her rebellious grandson, Nikolas (Tyler Christopher) but instead, Valentin overpowers Helena taking over the family's private island in Greece and he slowly poisons Helena. Valentin's henchmen try to keep Helena, Luke from escaping with Helena only for Nikolas to come to her rescue. She warns everyone Valentin has promised to destroy not only the Cassadines, but also the Spencers. Mikkos's daughter Alexis Davis (Nancy Lee Grahn) reveals she had only heard of her brother's treachery toward their father specifically, but Alexis had come to believe the never before seen Valentin was only a front for Helena and her schemes. Luke later accuses Helena of having Valentin murdered and she admits she thought Valentin had died as well but later realized he is alive and well. Much like Luke and Alexis, Nikolas believes Valentin is long dead and Helena is just using the threat of Valentin to manipulate him. In July 2016, fisherman Theo Hart claims to have been trapped on Cassadine Island due to bad weather. Jason (Billy Miller) and Sam (Kelly Monaco) agree to let him stay. Theo feigns surprise when Nikolas (Nick Stabile) is also on the island, and explains they met briefly when Nikolas was a teenager. Theo announces his plans to leave the island when the storm clears only to return and take several hostages at gun point and reveal himself to be Valentin. He then separates Nikolas and Ava from the group wanting him to sign over his entire fortune in exchange for Valentin sparing the lives of his friends and family. When Valentin threatens to kill Ava Jerome (Maura West) anyway, a struggle ensues and Nikolas is seemingly shot falling out a window to his presumed death. Ava attempts to seduce Valentin only to attack him and attempt her escape once caught she returns to the group and tells her version of events to Nik's devastated mother, Valentin shoots Kevin Collins (Jon Lindstrom) who comes to Laura's defence during the groups escape. Valentin decides his plan isn't working and while escaping himself sabotages the group's boat stranding them on the island where a mysterious woman comes to their aid. Using his alias, Valentin makes his way to Port Charles where he has a one-night stand with Nina Reeves (Michelle Stafford) accidentally leaving behind his phone as he goes off to kidnap his grand nephew Spencer (Nicolas Bechtel) only for his plans to be foiled when Nina finds the phone he left behind and tips off Jason and Spencer's uncle Sonny Corinthos (Maurice Benard), enough for PCPD commissioner Jordan Ashford (Vinessa Antoine) to make the arrest. As Valentin is extradited to Greece, he assures Lulu Spencer (Emme Rylan) and Dante Falconeri (Dominic Zamprogna) he isn't involved in her father's apparent death and he also promises to see Nina again despite her turning him in. Valentin resurfaces in October 2016 to confront his ex-lover Claudette Beaulieu (Bree Williamson). On Halloween, Valentin claims the Cassadine fortune starting with Nikolas' house. Valentin also appeals to his sister Alexis to help prove the legitimacy of his claim on the family fortune. He also pays a visit to Nina claiming no ill will toward her for sabotaging his outing with his nephew Spencer, insisting he was so taken with her he lost his head, promising to visit again due to their mutual attraction something Nina denies strongly. Meanwhile, super spy Anna Devane (Finola Hughes) puts Valentin on notice that he will regret causing trouble for anyone in Port Charles, He retorts with a Latin phrase which startles Anna as it is used by WSB agents; it means \\"open your eyes\\". He then shocks Anna's stepson Griffin Munro (Matt Cohen) by claiming Charlotte, Griffin's daughter with Claudette, is actually his child‚Äîto avoid complications, he agrees to a DNA test. Valentin discovers Nina's interest in children finding her reading a book of baby names, as he leaves he encourages her to read the page containing his It links him to Valentine's Day and love. With the help of her colleague Diane Miller (Carolyn Hennesy), Alexis discovers Mikkos had changed his will his before his death willing the family fortune to his oldest living male heir, Valentin. Anna and Griffin unsuccessfully try to keep Charlotte away from Valentin, but he is awarded custody by the courts and moves into Wyndemere all the time hinting at a connection to Anna she can't place. Laura leaves Wyndemere in disgust, Valentin offers to let her stay with a loaded comment about the two being family she leaves anyway. Nina discovers Valentin is actually the father of Charlotte, the lost little girl who appeared in her office, they then bond over their mutual dislike of Ava and Charlottes mother Claudette, Ava having stolen Nina's husband and Claudette having deceived Nina's brother Nathan about Charlotte's paternity. Valentin begins to pursue Nina romantically, the two sleeping together when she becomes stranded on his island. Nina asserts she sees a vulnerable, good side to Valentin and adores his daughter Charlotte, a little girl she now believes is motherless after the alleged death of Claudette (last seen boarding a plane with Valentin). In 2020, following Nikolas' return the previous year, it is revealed Valentin is not Mikkos' son, but in fact Helena's, thus disinheriting him as the heir of the Cassadine family fortune. Development =Creation and casting= Matt Borlenghi (left) was originally cast in the role of Valentin in 2009, before plans to introduce the character were abandoned. In late September 2009, it was announced that Matt Borlenghi, best known to daytime viewers for his portrayal of Brian Bodine on All My Children had been cast in the role of Valentin Cassadine. Borlenghi expressed his excitement about joining the cast, admitting that he always wanted to work on the series; \\"I can't imagine anywhere I'd rather be right now\\" he continued. The actor further stated \\"I don't know the extent of my stay, but I can only hope it's long enough for me to hang my shingle up and get down and dirty with Valentin.\\" However, the character of Valentin seemed to have been abandoned completely until 2013, when it was rumored that daytime actor Vincent Irizarry had been hired as a recast. Borlenghi took to Twitter with \\"Wasn't enough that I got Franco'd before? Hurts.\\" Then head writer Ron Carlivati denied the rumors immediately, claiming that Borlenghi had no reason to be upset. Borlgenhi released a statement in which he explained that the false news \\"opened an old wound.\\" On June 16, 2016, Soap Opera Digest reported that another All My Children alumnus James Patrick Stuart known for his portrayal of Will Cortlandt would debut in July. Soaps In Depth reported that Stuart would debut as Theo on July 8. \\"I get bored easily and I love a smorgasbord\\", the actor said. So when his agent informed him about General Hospital, Stuart couldn't turn it down. At the time, \\"I was bouncing between soccer games with my children and all of a sudden\\" Stuart's agent contacted him about Frank Valentini's interest in him for the role. Stuart consulted with his wife who encouraged him to meet with the producers. \\"The role that they were talking about was so fun, it just seemed like it would be exactly the way that I would want to go back.\\" The only catch was that Stuart had to cancel a trip to Hawaii that conflicted with taping dates. The casting reunites Stuart with his former All My Children co- star Genie Francis as well as Jon Lindstrom, the husband of his former co-star and close friend Cady McClain. While he was flattered to have been handpicked for the role, Stuart credits his close friends Ricky Paull Goldin and Michael E. Knight (also former co-star) with convincing him to sign on. \\"To have the chance to get back and do it again has been really yummy\\" the actor said of his return to daytime. When asked if he would commit to the series long term during his second stint, Stuart joked \\"Right now, [the show and I are] definitely dating.\\" =Characterization= Borlenghi described Valentin as \\"morally bankrupt.\\" James Patrick Stuart insisted that he wouldn't have taken a role that was too \\"subtle.\\" The character was presented to Stuart as \\"brash and take no prisoners.\\" Stuart said Theo might have similarities to his former character Will Cortlandt. Stuart said the character has \\"literal crazy confidence.\\" Stuart said that initially, \\"you're struck by the fact that this guy is just being a jerk.\\" However, \\"the more you play it, the more fleshed- out he becomes.\\" Stuart declared that he had no interest in seeing Valentin become a good guy because he relished in \\"playing the misunderstood [bleep]hole.\\" Valentin \\"is not the guy who comes in a raises an eyebrow\\" Stuart insisted any potential plans to reform the character. The actor continued that Valentin \\"has much to say. He's been wronged and he needs to make sure that you understand that. He has a specific agenda!\\" =Introduction= Borlenghi was expected to make his debut on October 14, 2009, and the actor had already reported for his first day of work when he learned of plans to postpone the role due to several creative changes behind the scenes, including the departure of Sarah Joy Brown as Claudia Zacchara, Jonathan Jackson returning to the role of Lucky Spencer replacing Greg Vaughan and the arrival of James Franco. Head writer Robert Guza, Jr. explained that \\"sweeps and the immediate aftermath are so full that frankly, I didn't have room for it.\\" In December 2009, Soap Opera Digest reported that the producers wanted Valentin \\"beefed up\\" and made plans to pen a \\"powerful story\\" for his arrival. By late January 2010, Borlenghi had still not appeared and a spokesperson for the series claimed that plans for Valentin were still on hold, but would eventually come to fruition. In February 2010, Constance Towers commented on the character's delayed introduction: \\"We have been serenading his entrance for quite awhile, [sic] but he hasn't made it yet. The character will be probably the only person that Helena is truly afraid of.\\" However, plans for Valentin's introduction never came to fruition. On July 1, 2016, Jamey Giddens of Daytime Confidential reported that James Patrick Stuart's character Theo was to be revealed as the infamous Valentin Cassadine. To avoid suspicion, Valentin creates Theo and assumes a Greek accent. Stuart himself was quite shocked by the plot twist as he was given very little information on the character. The producers asked if Stuart could play a Greek fisherman and he agreed unaware of the character's true identity. Stuart admitted to being nervous about learning some Greek words for the role. While the revelation of his true identity shocks everyone on Cassadine Island, head writer Jean Passanante hinted that it would also \\"leave at least one of them fighting for their life.\\" While Valentin does not intend to harm his nephew Nikolas (Stabile), he isn't fazed by his presumed death which he knows benefits him in the long run. According to Stuart, Valentin's reaction just shows how dangerous he is. Valentin is bitter because he has been deprived of what Nikolas grew up with. Despite the character being sent to prison on August 12, Soaps In Depth reported that Valentin was slated to reappear. Stuart described his initial stint as \\"sort of like a 10-day getting-to-know- you period.\\" After his first stint, Stuart's manager informed him that a return had not been set in stone which worked out perfectly for the actor as he took time to book a play and spend time with his family. = Return = The November 7 edition of Soaps In Depth reported that Stuart was set to return for a lengthier stint and had already been filming. After wrapping his first stint, Stuart wasn't aware of any plans to bring Valentin back until he was contacted by the series several weeks prior and they told him \\"We've got a ton of stuff for you to do!\\" \\"I hit the ground running\\" Stuart said of his returns as he filmed five episodes in three days. Stuart had much more information about his character upon his return. \\"Last time, [Frank Valentini] didn't really give me much of a backstory and this time, he did.\\" However, Stuart was warned to keep quiet about the information. \\"There's a reason Valentin's come to town, and it makes sense\\" the actor explained. Stuart continued, \\"I actually think it's really cool.\\" Valentin is adamant about getting what he feels he is owed, the Cassadine fortune and \\"He's not secretive about it.\\" He has \\"massive chip on his shoulder\\" due to his father Mikkos not fighting for him to avoid upsetting his stepmother Helena. Valentin was shipped off and did not have any contact with his family for years so he doesn't have an allegiance to family. Nikki Gantt from Soap Opera Spy speculated that Valentin could be the father of Charlotte (Scarlett Fernandez), the daughter of his ex- lover Claudette Beaulieu (Bree Williamson) whom Claudette attempts to pass off as the child of her cop ex-husband, Nathan West (Ryan Paevey) to protect Charlotte from Valentin. Meanwhile, SoapHub speculated that putting Valentin on Nathan's radar was to make way for the writers to reveal Valentin to be Nathan's long-lost father‚Äîa mystery that had been speculated on for two years. =Romances= Upon his arrival in Port Charles, Valentin takes a romantic interest in Nina Clay (Michelle Stafford) and they have a one-night stand. According to James Patrick Stuart, Valentin and Nina \\"have a lot more in common than just lust.\\" He continued, \\"There's an attraction there for a reason and they are really going to click.\\" Reception The announcement of Stuart's casting was well received by fans and critics alike. Fans took to social media to congratulate Stuart on his new gig and welcome him to the show. \\"The summer keeps getting hotter on 'General Hospital',\\" Soap Opera Spy said of the casting news. Stuart's memorable tenure on and exit from All My Children immediately struck a chord with longtime ABC soap fans after nearly 25 years and Dan J. Kroll said \\"That means Stuart's upcoming General Hospital stint better deliver.\\" Jamey Giddens of Daytime Confidential described Valentin as \\"one of the most talked about, yet previously unseen, supervillains\\" in the history of the series. \\"This could be exactly the kind of game-changer this soap needs,\\" Giddens said in praise of Stuart's casting. \\"Intriguing casting news\\" Michael Fairman said in reaction the announcement of Stuart's casting. \\"And that role is turning out to be quite the humdinger!\\" Michael Fairman exclaimed in reaction to the news of the character's true identity. Jenn Bishop of TVSource Magazine raved about Stuart as \\"excellent casting.\\" \\"He's very entertaining,\\" Bishop later said of Valentin. Soaps In Depth said in praise of Valentin's introduction, \\"Go figure -- sometimes, the wait is really worth it!\\" Donald Thompson of Canyon News believed that Valentin was \\"evil enough\\" to fulfill the much-needed role of a resident villain, which the series had not had since Helena Cassadine's demise.  Notes  # The character's scripting as the illegitimate son of Mikkos Cassadine was shown in the summer of 2009 under executive producer Jill Farren Phelps and head writer Robert Guza, Jr. However, the character was further developed by head writers Jean Passanante and Shelly Altman and first appeared under executive producer Frank Valentini in 2016.

Abuzayyad is also a former member of the Palestinian Legislative Council (1996‚Äì2006), former Minister of State in the Palestinian Authority (1998‚Äì2002), and former Deputy Chairman of the Political Committee of the Euro-Med Parliament (2004‚Äì2005). He was also the head of the Palestinian delegation to the Middle East multilateral peace talks in the Arms Control and Regional Security Working Group (ACRS) from 1994 to 1996. AbuZayyad was an advisor to the Palestinian negotiating team in Washington, DC in 1992, and later a member of the post-Oslo negotiating team that concluded the 1994 Israeli-Palestinian Agreement (\\"The Cairo Agreement\\" that led to the establishment of the Palestinian Authority). He has been imprisoned several times by Israeli authorities; the last was administrative detention for six months (November 1990 to May 1991). Immediately after his release he joined the Palestinian team led by Faisal Husseini to negotiate with U.S. Secretary of State James Baker the arrangements for the Madrid Conference of 1991. In 1986, well before the Oslo Accords, AbuZayyad founded the Palestinian bi-monthly Hebrew language journal Gesher (The Bridge), of which he was publisher and editor. He is interviewed frequently by Israeli and international media on current issues of the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict, and participated in numerous regional and international conferences on the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict, and interfaith dialog. AbuZayyad co-authored The West Bank Political Lexicon, together with prominent Israelis, Meron Benvenisti and Danny Rubinstein, and co-edited the book Islamophobia and Anti-Semitism together with Hillel Schenker. Awards In 2012, Ziad AbutZayyad was awarded a joint Outstanding Contribution to Peace Award with co-editor Hillel Schenker at the 8th annual International Media Awards in London.International Media Awards - Winners 2012 References * External links * The Palestine-Israel Journal * Council of Europe Biography Page. * https://web.archive.org/web/20120604011012/http://internationalmediaawards.org:80/ Category:1940 births Category:Living people Category:Palestinian lawyers Category:Palestinian journalists Category:Palestinian politicians Category:Damascus University alumni Category:State ministers of Palestine ","title":"Ziad Abuzayyad"},{"id":"31994181","text":"Michael Coles may refer to: * Michael Coles (speedway rider) (born 1965), British speedway rider * Michael Coles (cricketer) (born 1981), English cricketer * Michael Coles (actor) (1936‚Äì2005), English actor See also *Michael Cole (disambiguation) ","title":"Michael Coles"},{"id":"31994185","text":"A loggerhead sea turtle with a data storage tag that assists in monitoring the animal's migration Sea turtle migration refers to the long-distance movements of sea turtles (superfamily Chelonioidea) notably as adults but may also refer to the offshore migration of hatchings. Sea turtle hatchings emerge from underground nests and crawl across the beach towards the sea. They then maintain an offshore heading until they reach the open sea. The feeding and nesting sites of adult sea turtles are often distantly separated meaning some must migrate hundreds or even thousands of kilometres. Several main patterns of adult migration have been identified. Some such as the green sea turtle shuttle between nesting sites and coastal foraging areas. The loggerhead sea turtle uses a series of foraging sites. Others such as the leatherback sea turtle and olive ridley sea turtle do not show fidelity to any specific coastal foraging site. Instead, they forage in the open sea in complex movements apparently not towards any goal. Although the foraging movements of leatherbacks seem to be determined to a large part by passive drift with the currents, they are still able to return to specific sites to breed. The ability of adult sea turtles to travel to precise targets has led many to wonder about the navigational mechanisms used. Some have suggested that juvenile and adult turtles might use the Earth's magnetic field to determine their position. There is evidence for this ability in juvenile green sea turtles. Hatchling migration Efficient movement of hatchlings away from the beach and shallow coastal waters is important in reducing the length of time that they are vulnerable to predators, which target the hatchlings on the beach or in shallow waters. Therefore, sea turtle hatchlings move offshore as an innate behaviour. The first part of the hatchling migration is called the 'frenzy period' which involves almost continuous swimming for the first 24‚Äì36 hours. Orientation and navigation Studies of loggerhead and leatherback hatchlings have shown that moonlight reflected from the sea is an important visual cue in guiding movement from the beach to the sea. This navigational mechanism becomes a handicap if nesting sites are affected by artificial lighting since this can mean that hatchlings head towards the artificial lights rather than offshore towards the moonlit sea.Salmon (2003). Artificial lighting and sea turtles. Biologist 50, 163‚Äì168. Hence, the use of moonlight by turtle hatchings as a navigational cue can be considered an 'evolutionary trap'. Loggerhead and green turtles can detect the orbital movement of waves and use this information to swim perpendicular to the waves crests. This means they swim offshore, since close to the shore, wave crests run parallel to the beach. Further offshore the Earth's magnetic field is used to maintain an offshore direction and therefore head towards the open sea. The ability to head in a given direction without reference to landmarks, is called a compass mechanism and where magnetic cues are used to achieve this it is called a 'magnetic compass'.Goodenough et al. (2010). Perspectives on animal behaviour, 3rd edition. Chapter 10, p.204. Hatchling loggerheads mature within the North Atlantic Gyre and it is important that they stay within this current system since here water temperatures are benign. It has been shown that loggerheads use the magnetic field to stay within the gyre. For example, when exposed to fields characteristic of a region at the edge of the gyre they responded by orienting in a direction which would keep them within the gyre. These responses are inherited rather than learned since the hatchlings tested were captured before reaching the ocean. Adult turtles may learn aspects of the magnetic field and use this to navigate in a learned rather than innate way. Post-hatchling migration Juveniles often reside in coastal feeding grounds as is the case with green sea turtles and loggerheads. Adult sea turtles can be divided into 3 categories according to their movements. Leatherbacks and olive ridley turtles roam widely and unpredictably before returning to specific breeding sites. Satellite tracking of leatherbacks showed however that they tended to stay within relatively food-rich areas of the ocean during their migration. Kemp's ridley sea turtles, loggerheads and flatback sea turtles migrate between breeding areas and a series of coastal foraging areas. Green sea turtles and hawksbill sea turtles shuttle between fixed foraging and nesting sites. Both species of ridley sea turtle nest in large aggregations, a phenomenon called an arribada. It is thought to be an adaptation against predators ‚Äî there are simply too many eggs for the predators to consume. One unifying aspect of sea turtle migrations is their ability to return to specific nesting sites over vast areas of ocean year after year. They may return to the beach where they hatched, an ability called natal philopatry and this has been demonstrated in green turtles using mitochondrial DNA analysis. The precision migration of adults across featureless and dynamic oceans requires more than a compass mechanism, something Darwin pointed out in 1873: > \\"Even if we grant animals a sense of the points of the compass ... how can > we account for [green sea turtles] finding their way to that speck of land > in the midst of the great Atlantic Ocean\\". (referring to the migration of green sea turtles from the coast of Brazil to Ascension Island, a journey of 2200 km to an island only 20 km in diameter) An error in heading of only a few degrees would lead a turtle to miss the island by almost 100 km and animal compass analogues are not thought to be this precise. Moreover, a compass mechanism does not correct for current displacement since there is no position-fix. Some have suggested that turtles use aspects of the Earth's magnetic field to gauge their position and in this way they could correct for displacement by currents or by an experimenter. =Green sea turtles= The post-nesting migration of adult female green sea turtles from Ascension Island to Brazil has been recorded using satellite transmitters as part of an experiment into their navigation. In addition to the transmitters, some turtles were fitted with magnets which were expected to disrupt any ability to use the Earth's field for navigation. There was no difference in migratory performance between these turtles and turtles which were not carrying magnets, but the experimental design has been criticised. There is strong evidence that green turtles are sensitive to magnetic cues. For example, juvenile green turtles exposed to fields north and south of a capture site (i.e. displaced in geomagnetic but not geographical space) oriented in a direction that would have led them back to the capture site, suggesting that they can use the earth's magnetic field to acquire positional information. Adult turtles also use magnetic cues. Whilst geomagnetic cues may guide navigation over long distances, close to the goal, it is thought that turtles use wind-borne cues emanating from the goal to home in on their target. Most recently, it has been shown that juvenile greens can orient using a 'sun compass'. In other words, they can use directional information to determine their headings. Migration methods Turtle navigational skills for migrations are still unknown. There are several hypotheses including astronomical cues and the Earth's magnetic fields. Although unknown, there is scientific evidence that the sea turtles do have a navigational compass when making long migrations. The astronomical cue hypothesis for sea turtle migration one without scientific evidence. These cues would include light from the sun, moon, and stars. If the sea turtles used astronomical cues, they would not be able to navigate in waters where light does not attenuate well, on cloudy days or when the moon is blocked by clouds. The moon is not a good astronomical cue because there is a new moon every 28 days. With narrowing out the astronomical hypothesis, the use of earth's magnetic fields can be viewed as the navigational tool for long-migration patterns of sea turtles. Earth's magnetic fields are used for migration for a wide variety of species including bacteria, mollusks, arthropods, mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians. In order to understand the Earth's magnetic fields, the earth can be viewed as a large magnet. As a typical magnet has a north and south end, so does the earth. The north pole magnet is located at the Earth's north pole and the south pole magnet is located at the Earth's south pole. From this north and south pole span magnetic fields. The magnetic field leaves the poles and curves around the earth until it reaches the opposite pole. In regards to the magnetic field hypothesis, there are three main concepts that should be considered. The concepts include electromagnetic induction, magnetic field chemical reactions, and magnetite. In regards to electromagnetic induction, it is assumed that the sea turtles have electroreceptors. Although evidence has been found in other species such as rays and sharks, no evidence has shown that there are electroreceptors in sea turtles making this hypothesis invalid. A second concept from the experimentation by Irwin involves chemical reactions which is commonly found in a variety of species of newts and birds. The strength of the magnetic field affects the chemical reactions within the bodies of the newts and birds. The final concept includes the magnetic crystals that form during the magnetic pulses from the earth's magnetic fields. These magnetic crystals formed by magnetite give the turtles directional information and guides in migration. The magnetite affects the cells of the nervous system of the sea turtle by producing a signal that references the forces of the magnetic field and the direction and magnitude that is applied. If this magnetite is used in the migration, when the earth's magnetic poles reverse at the dipole moment, the signal that the sea turtle nervous system receives will change the migration direction. Regardless of the hypothesis, hatchling turtles have the ability to determine the direction and inclination angle of which they are swimming with aide from magnetic fields.

They were related to the Gdeim Izik protest camp in Western Sahara established the previous fall, which had resulted in violence between Sahrawi activists and Moroccan security forces and supporters. The protests also purportedly drew inspiration from the Arab Spring and successful revolts in Tunisia and Egypt, though according to some commentators, the Arab Spring proper did not reach Western Sahara. No significant protests were reported beyond May 2011, though international media coverage of Western Sahara is incomplete at best. There is renewed calls for peaceful protests from the Polisario Front.Polisario English: Call for renewed protests 2012 Background The Gdeim Izik protest camp was a protest camp in Western Sahara established on 9 October 2010 and lasting into November, with related incidents occurring in the aftermath of its dismantlement on 8 November. While protests were initially peaceful, they were later marked by clashes between civilians and security forces.  Timeline  = Dakhla riots = On 25 February 2011, clashes were reported in Dakhla, the second largest city of Western Sahara. The unrest started late that night after the \\"Sea & Desert\\" Dakhla music festival concerts when, according to Sahrawi sources, \\"hundreds of Moroccan youths armed with sticks, swords, and Molotov cocktails attacked and looted Sahrawi houses, burning their cars\\". The next day, hundreds of protesters gathered on the city center, protesting against police inaction on the previous night. They attacked government buildings, banks and shops using stones and gas cylinders, without police intervention. The music festival was then suspended. On the night, riots started again without police presence. On Friday, police were deployed in the streets to prevent new protests. According to Mayor Hamid Shabar, \\"Separatist elements tried to take advantage of a quarrel that occurred among some youths late last Friday night/early Saturday morning in order to disrupt the peaceful atmosphere that this area enjoys.\\" Official Moroccan press agency (MAP) reported that two civilians were intentionally run over by a four-wheel drive vehicle driven by protesters, and that 14 people were injured. According to a Radio France International reporter, at least 100 people were injured, but many were afraid to go to the hospital for treatment. = Laayoune sit-ins = On 2 March, a group of about 500 people, comprising old workers of Bu Craa, fishermen, vocational education student graduates, members of the dialogue committee of the Gdeim Izik camp and families of political prisoners, made a sit-in in front of the Mining and Energy Ministry in Laayoune; they asked for the release of all prisoners of conscience. The Moroccan security forces intervened then and dispersed the demonstration. According to the Polisario, between 13 and 68 people were injured during the intervention of the Police, including three people carrying Spanish citizenship. On 8 April, families of \\"political prisoners\\" held a new protest in the Moroccan- administered city in a bid to draw attention to the alleged poor treatment of Sahrawi detainees and call upon Moroccan authorities for their release, a Sahrawi human rights group said. The group also claimed that though police and intelligence officers kept a close watch on the vigil, protesters were nonviolent and no clashes erupted. Similar to major days of demonstration in other Arab states experiencing concurrent protests, the vigil was held on a Friday, though it was unclear if this was intentional on the part of protest organizers. Later in the month, peaceful protests in Laayoune became tri- weekly events, taking place on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, accompanying an \\"indefinite\\" sit-in held by unemployed university graduates outside of the Moroccan Ministry of Labour building in the city that started 20 April, according to several Sahrawi interest groups who spoke to media in mid-May. These groups also claimed other protests were being held in solidarity with Laayoune's activists in several more cities and towns in Western Sahara. However, these reports have not been independently verified. = May activism = A sit-in at the family home of a Sahrawi boy allegedly killed by Moroccan police was dispersed on 19 May, with 30 protesters left injured by security officers, pro-Sahrawi media reported. A handful of activists in Essmara also started a sit-in and hunger strike to protest the suspension of their wages for visiting Polisario-administered refugee camps in the Algerian Sahara. Protests were also reportedly held in Guelmim and Assa in southern Morocco proper to protest the death and arrest of several Sahrawi youth activists in late April, though Sahrawi sources claiming knowledge of these events did not specify when they took place and their reports could not be immediately verified by independent media or observers. Connection to regional events Media reported in February 2011 that Sahrawis were closely watching the Arab Spring, the popularly dubbed wave of pro-democracy, anti-government protests throughout North Africa and the Middle East that started in December 2010, and celebrated the downfall of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in a popular revolution. Some Sahrawis called for organization in protest camps to replicate the events of the Egyptian uprising, though opinion was reportedly divided on whether they believed they could join forces with a protest movement in Morocco proper. According to afrol News, the initial protest in Dakhla appeared to be an isolated reaction to the alleged violence of the night before, though more organized demonstrations had apparently spread to El Aaiun and possibly throughout the territory by March and April. While Foreign Policy reported in April that the Arab Spring seemed to have not had much effect in Western Sahara, with the international community not reacting strongly to the 2010 Sahrawi protests and the Moroccan security clampdown in early 2011, Polisario Front official and president of the partially recognized Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic Mohamed Abdelaziz said in early April, \\"Like our brothers and sisters in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya and Bahrain, the Saharawi people just want a vote to freely decide their own future. It worked in South Sudan. It will work in Western Sahara too.\\" See also *List of protests in the 21st century References Sahrawi Category:2011 in Morocco Category:2011 in Western Sahara Category:Western Sahara conflict Western Saharan Western Sahara Category:Protests in Western Sahara Category:2011‚Äì2012 Moroccan protests ","title":"2011 Western Saharan protests"},{"id":"31994535","text":"A number of authors have carried out comparisons of Nazism and Stalinism in which they have considered the similarities and differences of the two ideologies and political systems, what relationship existed between the two regimes, and why both of them came to prominence at the same time. During the 20th century, the comparison of Nazism and Stalinism was made on the topics of totalitarianism, ideology and personality cult. Both regimes were seen in contrast to the liberal West, with an emphasis on the similarities between the two.Geyer (2009). p. 16. The political scientists Zbigniew Brzezinski, Hannah Arendt and Carl Friedrich and historian Robert Conquest were prominent advocates of applying the totalitarian concept to compare Nazism and Stalinism.Geyer, pp. 4‚Äì9. On the other hand, there is a revisionist school including Michael Geyer and Sheila Fitzpatrick that highlights the differences between Nazism and Stalinism.  Hannah Arendt  = Origins of totalitarianism = One of the first scholars to publish a comparative study of Nazi Germany and Stalin's Soviet Union was Hannah Arendt. In her 1951 work The Origins of Totalitarianism, Arendt puts forward the idea of totalitarianism as a distinct type of political movement and form of government, which \\"differs essentially from other forms of political oppression known to us such as despotism, tyranny and dictatorship.\\"Hannah Arendt, The Origins of Totalitarianism (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 460 Furthermore, Arendt distinguishes between a totalitarian movement (such as a political party with totalitarian aims) and a totalitarian government. Not all totalitarian movements succeed in creating totalitarian governments once they gain power. In Arendt's view, although many totalitarian movements existed in Europe in the 1920s and 1930s, only the governments of Stalin and Hitler succeeded in fully implementing their totalitarian aims.Hannah Arendt, The Origins of Totalitarianism (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 310 Arendt traced the origin of totalitarian movements to the nineteenth century, focusing especially on antisemitism and imperialism. She emphasized the connection between the rise of European nation-states and the growth of antisemitism, which was due to the fact that the Jews represented an \\"inter-European, non-national element in a world of growing or existing nations.\\"Hannah Arendt, The Origins of Totalitarianism (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 22 Conspiracy theories abounded, and the Jews were accused of being part of various international schemes to ruin European nations.Hannah Arendt, The Origins of Totalitarianism (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 28 Small antisemitic political parties formed in response to this perceived Jewish threat, and, according to Arendt, these were the first political organizations in Europe that claimed to represent the interests of the whole nation as opposed to the interests of a class or other social group.Hannah Arendt, The Origins of Totalitarianism (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 38 The later totalitarian movements would copy or inherit this claim to speak for the whole nation, with the implication that any opposition to them constituted treason. European imperialism of the 19th century also paved the way for totalitarianism, by legitimizing the concept of endless expansion.Hannah Arendt, The Origins of Totalitarianism (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 125 After Europeans had engaged in imperialist expansion on other continents, political movements developed which aimed to copy the methods of imperialism on the European continent itself. Arendt refers specifically to the \\"pan-movements\\" of pan-Germanism and pan-Slavism which promised continental empires to nations that had little hope of overseas expansion.Hannah Arendt, The Origins of Totalitarianism (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 223 According to Arendt, \\"Nazism and Bolshevism owe more to Pan-Germanism and Pan-Slavism (respectively) than to any other ideology or political movement.\\"Hannah Arendt, The Origins of Totalitarianism (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 222 = Recruitment, propaganda and indoctrination = Arendt argues that both the Nazi and Bolshevik movements \\"recruited their members from [a] mass of apparently indifferent people whom all other parties had given up,\\"Hannah Arendt, The Origins of Totalitarianism (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 311 and who \\"had reason to be equally hostile to all parties.\\"Hannah Arendt, The Origins of Totalitarianism (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 312 For this reason, totalitarian movements did not need to use debate or persuasion, and did not need to refute the arguments of the other parties. Their target audience did not have to be persuaded to despise the other parties or the democratic system, because it consisted of people who already despised mainstream politics. As a result, totalitarian movements were free to use violence and terror against their opponents without fear that this might alienate their own supporters. Instead of arguing against their opponents, they adopted deterministic views of human behavior and presented opposing ideas as \\"originating in deep natural, social, or psychological sources beyond the control of the individual and therefore beyond the power of reason.\\" The Nazis in particular, during the years before their rise to power, engaged in \\"killing small socialist functionaries or influential members of opposing parties\\" both as a means to intimidate opponents and as a means of demonstrating to their supporters that they were a party of action, \\"different from the 'idle talkers' of other parties.\\"Hannah Arendt, The Origins of Totalitarianism (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 344 Totalitarian governments make extensive use of propaganda, and are often characterized by having a strong distinction between what they tell their own supporters and the propaganda they produce for others.Hannah Arendt, The Origins of Totalitarianism (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 342 Arendt distinguishes these two categories as \\"indoctrination\\" and \\"propaganda\\". Indoctrination consists of the message that a totalitarian government promotes internally, to the members of the ruling party and that segment of the population which supports the government. Propaganda consists of the message that a totalitarian government seeks to promote in the outside world, and also among those parts of its own society which may not support the government.Hannah Arendt, The Origins of Totalitarianism (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 343 Thus, \\"the necessities for propaganda are always dictated by the outside world,\\" while the opportunities for indoctrination depend on \\"the totalitarian governments' isolation and security from outside interference.\\" The type of indoctrination used by the Soviets and the Nazis was characterized by claims of \\"scientific\\" truth, and appeals to \\"objective laws of nature.\\"Hannah Arendt, The Origins of Totalitarianism (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 345 Both movements took a deterministic view of human society and claimed that their ideologies were based on scientific discoveries regarding race (in the case of the Nazis) or the forces governing human history (in the case of the Soviets). Arendt identifies this as being in certain ways similar to modern advertising, in which companies claim that scientific research shows their products to be superior, but more generally she argues that it is an extreme version of \\"that obsession with science which has characterized the Western world since the rise of mathematics and physics in the sixteenth century.\\"Hannah Arendt, The Origins of Totalitarianism (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 346 By their use of pseudoscience as the main justification for their actions, Nazism and Stalinism are distinguished from earlier historical despotic regimes, who appealed instead to religion or sometimes did not try to justify themselves at all. According to Arendt, totalitarian governments did not merely use these appeals to supposed scientific laws as propaganda to manipulate others. Rather, totalitarian leaders like Hitler and Stalin genuinely believed that they were acting in accordance with immutable natural laws, to such an extent that they were willing to sacrifice the self-interest of their regimes for the sake of enacting those supposed laws.Hannah Arendt, The Origins of Totalitarianism (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 349 For instance, the Nazis treated the inhabitants of occupied territories with extreme brutality and planned to depopulate Eastern Europe in order to make way for colonists from the German \\"master race,\\" despite the fact that this actively harmed their war effort.Hannah Arendt, The Origins of Totalitarianism (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 415 Stalin repeatedly purged the Communist Party of people who deviated even slightly from the party line, even when this weakened the party or the Soviet government, because he believed that they represented the interests of \\"dying classes\\" and their demise was historically inevitable. = Leader = Arendt also identifies the central importance of an all-powerful leader in totalitarian movements.Hannah Arendt, The Origins of Totalitarianism (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 373 As in other areas, she distinguishes between totalitarian leaders (such as Hitler and Stalin) and non-totalitarian dictators or autocratic leaders. The totalitarian leader does not rise to power by personally using violence or through any special organizational skills, but rather by controlling appointments of personnel within the party, so that all other prominent party members owe their positions to him.Hannah Arendt, The Origins of Totalitarianism (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 380 With loyalty to the leader becoming the primary criterion for promotion, ambitious party members compete with each other in trying to express their loyalty, and a cult of personality develops around the leader. Even when the leader is not particularly competent and the members of his inner circle are aware of his deficiencies, they remain committed to him out of fear that without him the entire power structure would collapse. = \\"Enemies\\" = Once in power, according to Arendt, totalitarian movements face a major dilemma: they built their support on the basis of anger against the status quo and on impossible or dishonest promises, but now they have become the new status quo and are expected to carry out their promises.Hannah Arendt, The Origins of Totalitarianism (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 392 They deal with this problem by engaging in a constant struggle against external and internal enemies, real or imagined, so as to enable them to say that, in a sense, they have not yet gained the power they need to fulfill their promises. According to Arendt, totalitarian governments must be constantly fighting enemies in order to survive. This explains their apparently irrational behavior, for example when Hitler continued to make territorial demands even after he was offered everything he asked for in the Munich Agreement, or when Stalin unleashed the Great Terror despite the fact that he faced no significant internal opposition.Hannah Arendt, The Origins of Totalitarianism (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 393 = Concentration camps = Arendt points out the widespread use of concentration camps by totalitarian governments, arguing that they are the most important manifestation of the need to find enemies to fight against, and are therefore \\"more essential to the preservation of the regime's power than any of its other institutions.\\"Hannah Arendt, The Origins of Totalitarianism (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 456 Although forced labor was commonly imposed on inmates of concentration camps, Arendt argues that their primary purpose was not any kind of material gain for the regime: \\"The only permanent economic function of the camps has been the financing of their own supervisory apparatus; thus from the economic point of view the concentration camps exist mostly for their own sake.\\"Hannah Arendt, The Origins of Totalitarianism (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 444 The Nazis in particular carried this to the point of \\"open anti- utility,\\" by expending large sums of money, resources and manpower ‚Äì during a war ‚Äì for the purpose of building and staffing extermination camps and transporting people to them.Hannah Arendt, The Origins of Totalitarianism (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 445 This sets apart the concentration camps of totalitarian regimes from older human institutions that bear some similarity to them, such as slavery. Slaves were abused and killed for the sake of profit; concentration camp inmates were abused and killed because a totalitarian government needed to justify its existence. Finally, Arendt points out that concentration camps under both Hitler and Stalin included large numbers of inmates who were innocent of any crime ‚Äì not only in the ordinary sense of the word, but even by the standards of the regimes themselves. That is to say, most of the inmates had not actually committed any action against the regime.Hannah Arendt, The Origins of Totalitarianism (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 451 = Future of totalitarian systems = Throughout her analysis, Arendt emphasized the modernity and novelty of the governmental structures set up by Stalin and Hitler, arguing that they represented \\"an entirely new form of government\\" which is likely to manifest itself again in various other forms in the future.Hannah Arendt, The Origins of Totalitarianism (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 478 She also cautioned against the belief that future totalitarian movements would necessarily share the ideological foundations of Nazism or Stalinism, writing that \\"all ideologies contain totalitarian elements.\\"Hannah Arendt, The Origins of Totalitarianism (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 470  Carl Friedrich and Zbigniew Brzezinski  Zbigniew Brzezinski = Totalitarian systems and autocracies = The totalitarian paradigm in the comparative study of Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union was further developed by Carl Friedrich and Zbigniew Brzezinski, who wrote extensively on this topic both individually and in collaboration. Similar to Hannah Arendt, they state that \\"totalitarian dictatorship is a new phenomenon; there has never been anything quite like it before.\\"Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy, Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 19 Friedrich and Brzezinski classify totalitarian dictatorship as a type of autocracy, but argue that it is different in important ways from most other historical autocracies. In particular, it is distinguished by a reliance on modern technology and mass legitimation.Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy, Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 4 Unlike Arendt, Friedrich and Brzezinski apply the notion of totalitarian dictatorship not only to the regimes of Hitler and Stalin, but also to the USSR throughout its entire existence, as well as the regime of Benito Mussolini in Italy and the People's Republic of China under Mao Zedong. Carl Friedrich noted that the \\"possibility of equating the dictatorship of Stalin in the Soviet Union and that of Hitler in Germany\\" has been a deeply controversial topic and a subject of debate almost from the beginning of those dictatorships.Carl J. Friedrich (editor) et al., Totalitarianism [proceedings of a conference held at the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, March 1953], New York: Grosset and Dunlap, 1964, p. 2 Various other aspects of the two regimes have also been the subject of intense scholarly debate, such as whether Nazi and Stalinist ideologies were genuinely believed and pursued by the respective governments, or whether the ideologies were merely convenient justifications for dictatorial rule.Carl J. Friedrich (editor) et al., Totalitarianism [proceedings of a conference held at the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, March 1953], New York: Grosset and Dunlap, 1964, p. 6 Friedrich himself argues in favor of the former view. Friedrich and Brzezinski argue that Nazism and Stalinism are not only similar to each other, but also represent a continuation or a return to the tradition of European absolute monarchy on certain levels.Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy, Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 8 In the absolute monarchies of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the monarch ultimately held all decisional power, and was considered accountable only to God. In Stalinism and Nazism, the leader likewise held all real power, and was considered accountable only to various intangible entities such as \\"the people\\", \\"the masses\\" or \\"the Volk.\\" Thus the common feature of autocracies ‚Äì whether monarchical or totalitarian ‚Äì is the concentration of power in the hands of a leader who cannot be held accountable by any legal mechanisms, and who is supposed to be the embodiment of the will of an abstract entity. Friedrich and Brzezinski also identify other features common to all autocracies, such as \\"the oscillation between tight and loose control.\\"Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy, Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 11 The regime alternates between periods of intense repression and periods of relative freedom, often represented by different leaders. This depends in part on the personal character of different leaders, but Friedrich and Brzezinski believe that there is also an underlying political cycle, in which rising discontent leads to increased repression up to the point at which the opposition is eliminated, then controls are relaxed until the next time that popular dissatisfaction begins to grow. Thus, placing Stalinism and Nazism within the broader historical tradition of autocratic government, Friedrich and Brzezinski hold that \\"totalitarian dictatorship, in a sense, is the adaptation of autocracy to twentieth-century industrial society.\\"Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy, Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 15 However, at the same time, they insist that totalitarian dictatorship is a \\"novel type of autocracy\\"Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy, Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 17 and argue that twentieth century totalitarian regimes (such as those of Hitler and Stalin) had more in common with each other than with any other form of government, including historical autocracies of the past. Totalitarianism can only exist after the creation of modern technology, because such technology is essential for propaganda, for surveillance of the population, and for the operation of a secret police.Carl J. Friedrich (editor) et al., Totalitarianism [proceedings of a conference held at the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, March 1953], New York: Grosset and Dunlap, 1964, p. 24 Furthermore, when speaking of the differences and similarities between fascist and communist regimes, Friedrich and Brzezinski insist that the two kinds of totalitarian governments are \\"basically alike\\" but \\"not wholly alike\\" ‚Äì they are more similar to each other than to other forms of government, but they are not the same.Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy, Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 20Carl J. Friedrich (editor) et al., Totalitarianism [proceedings of a conference held at the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, March 1953], New York: Grosset and Dunlap, 1964, p. 50 Among the major differences between them, Friedrich and Brzezinski identify in particular the fact that communists seek \\"the world revolution of the proletariat,\\" while fascists wish to \\"establish the imperial predominance of a particular nation or race.\\" = Five pillars of totalitarian systems = In terms of the similarities between Nazism and Stalinism, Friedrich lists five main aspects that they hold in common: First, an official ideology that is supposed to be followed by all members of society, at least passively, and which promises to serve as a perfect guide towards some ultimate goal. Second, a single political party, composed of the most enthusiastic supporters of the official ideology, representing an elite group within society (no more than 10 percent of the population), and organized along strictly regimented lines. Third, \\"a technologically conditioned near-complete monopoly of control of all means of effective armed combat\\" in the hands of the party or its representatives. Fourth, a similar monopoly held by the party over the mass media and all technological forms of communication. Fifth, \\"a system of terroristic police control\\" that is not only used to defend the regime against real enemies, but also to persecute various groups of people who are only suspected of being enemies or who may potentially become enemies in the future.Carl J. Friedrich (editor) et al., Totalitarianism [proceedings of a conference held at the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, March 1953], New York: Grosset and Dunlap, 1964, p. 53 Two first pillars of any totalitarian government, according to Friedrich and Brzezinski, are the dictator and the Party. The dictator, whether Stalin, Hitler or Mussolini, holds supreme power. Friedrich and Brzezinski explicitly reject the claim that the Party, or any other institution, could provide a significant counterweight to the power of the dictator in Nazism or Stalinism.Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy, Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 31 The dictator needs the Party in order to be able to rule, so he may be careful not to make decisions that would go directly against the wishes of other leading Party members, but ultimate authority rests with him and not with them. Like Arendt, Friedrich and Brzezinski also identify the cult of personality surrounding the leader as an essential element of a totalitarian dictatorship, and reference Stalin's personality cult in particular.Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy, Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 33 They also draw attention to the fact that Hitler and Stalin were expected to provide ideological direction for their governments and not merely practical leadership. Friedrich and Brzezinski write that \\"unlike military dictators in the past, but like certain types of primitive chieftains, the totalitarian dictator is both ruler and high priest.\\" That is to say, he not only governs, but also provides the principles on which his government is to be based. This is partly due to the way that totalitarian governments arise. They come about when a militant ideological movement seizes power, so the first leader of a totalitarian government is usually the ideologue who built the movement that seized power, and subsequent leaders try to emulate him.Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy, Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 34  Dictator and his henchmen  The totalitarian dictator needs loyal lieutenants to carry out his orders faithfully and with a reasonable degree of efficiency. Friedrich and Brzezinski identify parallels between the men in Hitler and Stalin's entourage, arguing that both dictators used similar people to perform similar tasks. Thus, for example, Martin Bormann and Georgy Malenkov were both capable administrators and bureaucrats, while Heinrich Himmler and Lavrentiy Beria were ruthless secret police chiefs responsible for suppressing any potential challenge to the dictator's power.Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy, Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 35 Both Hitler and Stalin promoted rivalry and distrust among their lieutenants so as to ensure that none of them would become powerful enough to challenge the dictator himself.Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy, Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 37 This is the cause of an important weakness of the totalitarian regimes: the problem of succession. Friedrich points out that neither the Nazi nor the Stalinist government ever established any official line of succession or any mechanism to decide who would replace the dictator after his death. The dictator, being the venerated \\"father of the people,\\" was regarded as irreplaceable. There could never be any heir apparent, because such an heir would have been a threat to the power of the dictator while he was alive. Thus the dictator's inevitable death would always leave behind a major power vacuum and cause a political crisis. In the case of the Nazi regime, since Hitler died mere days before the final defeat of Germany in the war, this never became a major issue. In the case of the USSR, Stalin's death led to a prolonged power struggle.  Totalitarian party  Friedrich and Brzezinski also identify key similarities between the Nazi and Stalinist political parties, which set them apart from other types of political parties. Both the Nazi Party and the CPSU under Stalin had very strict membership requirements and did not accept members on the basis of mere agreement with the Party's ideology and goals. Rather, they strictly tested potential members, in a manner similar to exclusive clubs, and often engaged in political purges of the membership, expelling large numbers of people from their ranks (and sometimes arresting and executing those expelled, such as in the Great Purge or the Night of the Long Knives).Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy, Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 45 Thus, the totalitarian party cultivates the idea that to be a member is a privilege which needs to be earned, and total obedience to the leader is required in order to maintain this privilege. While both Nazism and Stalinism required party members to display such total loyalty in practice, they differed in the way they dealt with it in theory. Nazism openly proclaimed the hierarchical ideal of absolute obedience to the F√ºhrer as one of its key ideological principles (the F√ºhrerprinzip). Stalinism, meanwhile, denied that it did anything similar, and claimed instead to uphold democratic principles, with the Party Congress (made up of elected delegates) supposedly being the highest authority.Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy, Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 48 However, Stalinist elections typically featured only a single candidate, and the Party Congress met very rarely and simply approved Stalin's decisions. Thus, regardless of the differences in their underlying ideological claims, the Nazi and Stalinist parties were organized in practice along similar lines, with a rigid hierarchy and centralized leadership.Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy, Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 58 Each totalitarian party and dictator is supported by a specific totalitarian ideology. Friedrich and Brzezinski argue, in agreement with Arendt, that Nazi and Stalinist leaders really believed in their respective ideologies and did not merely use them as tools to gain power. Several major policies, such as the Stalinist Scollectivization of agriculture or the Nazi Final Solution, cannot be explained by anything other than a genuine commitment to achieve ideological goals, even at great cost.Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy, Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 86 The ideologies were different and their goals were different, but what they had in common was a utopian commitment to reshaping the world, and a determination to fight by any means necessary against a real or imagined enemy. This stereotyped enemy could be described as \\"the fat rich Jew or the Jewish Bolshevik\\" for the Nazis, or \\"the war-mongering, atom-bomb-wielding American Wallstreeter\\" for the Soviets.Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy, Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 90  Ideology and symbolism  According to Friedrich and Brzezinski, the most important difference between Nazi and Stalinist ideology lies in the degree of universality involved. Stalinism, and communist ideology in general, is universal in its appeal and addresses itself to all the \\"workers of the world.\\" Nazism, on the other hand, and fascist ideology in general, can only address itself to one particular race or nation ‚Äì the \\"master race\\" that is destined to dominate all others. Therefore, \\"in communism social justice appears to be the ultimate value, unless it be the classless society that is its essential condition; in fascism, the highest value is dominion, eventually world dominion, and the strong and pure nation-race is its essential condition, as seen by its ideology.\\"Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy, Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 95 This means that fascist or Nazi movements from different countries will be natural enemies, rather than natural allies, as they each seek to extend the dominion of their own nation at the expense of others.Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy, Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 96 Friedrich and Brzezinski see this as a weakness inherent in fascist and Nazi ideology, while communist universalism is a source of ideological strength for Stalinism. Friedrich and Brzezinski also draw attention to the symbols used by Nazis and Stalinists to represent themselves. The Soviet Union adopted the hammer and sickle, a newly-created symbol, \\"invented by the leaders of the movement and pointing to the future.\\" Meanwhile, Nazi Germany used the swastika, \\"a ritual symbol of uncertain origin, quite common in primitive societies.\\"Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy, Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 89-90 Thus, one is trying to project itself as being oriented towards a radically new future, while the other is appealing to a mythical heroic past.  Propaganda and terror  Hitler and Stalin in 1930's propaganda posters Wochenspruch der NSDAP 8 June 1941: \\"True socialism, however, is the doctrine of the strictest performance of duty.\\" Totalitarian dictatorships maintain themselves in power through the use of propaganda and terror, which Friedrich and Brzezinski believe to be closely connected. Terror may be enforced with arrests and executions of dissenters, but it can also take more subtle forms, such as the threat of losing one's job, social stigma and defamation. \\"Terror\\" can refer to any widespread method used to intimidate people into submission as a matter of daily life. According to Friedrich and Brzezinski, the most effective terror is invisible to the people it affects. They simply develop a habit of acting in a conformist manner and not questioning authority, without necessarily being aware that this is what they are doing.Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy, Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 129 Thus, terror creates a society dominated by apparent consensus, where the vast majority of the population appears to support the government. Propaganda is then used to maintain this appearance of popular consent.Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy, Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 130 Totalitarian propaganda is one of the features that distinguishes totalitarian regimes as modern forms of government and separates them from older autocracies, since a totalitarian government holds complete control over all means of communication (not only public communication such as the mass media, but also private communication such as letters and telephone calls, which are strictly monitored). The methods of propaganda were very similar in the Stalinist USSR and in Nazi Germany. Both Joseph Goebbels and Soviet propagandists sought to demonize their enemies and present a picture of a united people standing behind its leader to confront foreign threats. In both cases there was no attempt to convey complex ideological nuances to the masses, with the message being instead about a simplistic struggle between good and evil. Both Nazi and Stalinist regimes produced two very different sets of propaganda ‚Äì one for internal consumption and one for potential sympathizers in other countries. And both regimes would sometimes radically change their propaganda line as they made peace with a former enemy or got into a war with a former ally.Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy, Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 133-134 Paradoxically, a totalitarian government's complete control over communications renders that government highly misinformed. With no way for anyone to express criticism, the dictator has no way of knowing how much support he actually has among the general populace. With all government policies always declared successful in propaganda, officials are unable to determine what actually worked and what didn't.Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy, Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 135 Both Stalinism and Nazism suffered from this problem, especially during the war between them. As the war turned against Germany, there was growing opposition to Hitler's rule, including within the ranks of the military, but Hitler was never aware of this until it was too late such as with the 20 July plot. In 1948, during the early days of the Berlin Blockade, the Soviet leadership apparently believed that the population of West Berlin was sympathetic to Soviet Communism and that they would request to join the Soviet zone.Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy, Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 136-137 Given enough time, the gap between real public opinion and what the totalitarian government believes about public opinion can grow so wide that the government is no longer able to even produce effective propaganda, because it does not know what the people actually think and so it does not know what to tell them. Friedrich and Brzezinski refer to this as the \\"ritualization of propaganda\\": the totalitarian regime continues to produce propaganda as a political ritual, with little real impact on public opinion.Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy, Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 140  Arrests, executions and concentration camps  Emaciated survivors of Ebensee concentration camp, May 1945 The totalitarian use of mass arrests, executions and concentration camps ‚Äì also noted by Arendt ‚Äì was analyzed at length by Friedrich and Brzezinski. They hold that \\"totalitarian terror maintains, in institutionalized form, the civil war that originally produced the totalitarian movement and by means of which the regime is able to proceed with its program, first of social disintegration and then of social reconstruction.\\"Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy, Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 183 Both Stalinism and Nazism saw themselves as engaging in a life-or-death struggle against implacable enemies. But to declare that the struggle had been won would have meant to declare that most of the totalitarian features of the government were no longer needed. A secret police force, for instance, has no reason to exist if there are no dangerous traitors who need to be found. Thus the struggle, or \\"civil war\\" against internal enemies, must be institutionalized and must continue indefinitely. In the Stalinist USSR, the repressive apparatus was eventually turned against members of the Communist Party itself in the Great Purge and the show trials that accompanied it.Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy, Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 187, p. 190 Nazism, by contrast, had a much shorter lifespan in power, and Nazi terror generally maintained an outward focus, with the extermination of the Jews always given top priority. The Nazis did not turn inward towards purging their own party except in a limited way on two occasions (the Night of the Long Knives and the aftermath of the 20 July plot).Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy, Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 185 The peak of totalitarian terror was reached with the Nazi concentration camps. These ranged from labor camps to extermination camps, and they are described by Friedrich and Brzezinski as aiming to \\"eliminate all actual, potential, and imagined enemies of the regime.\\"Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy, Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 197 As the field of Holocaust studies was still in its early stages at the time of their writing, they do not describe the conditions in detail, but do refer to the camps as involving \\"extreme viciousness.\\"Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy, Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 198 They also compare these camps with the Soviet Gulag system, and highlight the use of concentration camps as a method of punishment and execution by Nazi and Stalinist regimes alike. However, unlike Hannah Arendt, who held that the Gulag camps served no economic purpose, Friedrich and Brzezinski argue that they provided an important source of cheap labor for the Stalinist economy.Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy, Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 199  Moshe Lewin and Ian Kershaw  Ian Kershaw = Germany and Russia = The comparative study of Nazism and Stalinism was carried further by other groups of scholars, such as Moshe Lewin and Ian Kershaw together with their collaborators. Writing after the dissolution of the USSR, Lewin and Kershaw take a longer historical perspective and regard Nazism and Stalinism not so much as examples of a new type of society (like Arendt, Friedrich and Brzezinski did), but more as historical \\"anomalies\\" ‚Äì unusual deviations from the typical path of development that most industrial societies are expected to follow.Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison, Cambridge University Press, 1997, , p. 2 Therefore, the task of comparing Nazism and Stalinism is, to them, a task of explaining why Germany and Russia (along with other countries) deviated from the historical norm. At the outset, Lewin and Kershaw identify similarities between the historical situations in Germany and Russia prior to the First World War and during that war. Both countries were ruled by authoritarian monarchies, who were under pressure to make concessions to popular demands. Both countries had \\"powerful bureaucracies and strong military traditions.\\" Both had \\"powerful landowning classes,\\" while also being in the process of rapid industrialization and modernization. And both countries had expansionist foreign policies with a particular interest in Central and Eastern Europe.Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison, Cambridge University Press, 1997, , p. 4 Lewin and Kershaw do not claim that these factors made Stalinism or Nazism inevitable, but rather that they help to explain why the Stalinist and Nazi regimes developed similar features. = Similarities and differences of the systems = Ian Kershaw admitted that Stalinism and Nazism are comparable in \\"the nature and extent of their inhumanity,\\" but noted that the two regimes were different in a number of aspectsIan Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison, Cambridge University Press, 1997, , p. 88-89 Lewin and Kershaw question the usefulness of grouping the Stalinist and Nazi regimes together under a \\"totalitarian\\" category, saying that it remains an open question whether the similarities between them are greater or smaller than the differences.Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison, Cambridge University Press, 1997, , p. 3Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison, Cambridge University Press, 1997, , p. 3-5 In particular, they criticize what they see as the ideologically-motivated attempt to determine which regime killed more people, saying that apologists of each regime are trying to defend their side by claiming the other was responsible for more deaths.Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison, Cambridge University Press, 1997, , p. 8  Personality cult  Lewin and Kershaw place the cult of personality at the center of their comparison of Nazism and Stalinism, writing that both regimes \\"represented a new genre of political system centred upon the artificial construct of a leadership cult ‚Äì the 'heroic myth' of the 'great leader', no longer a king or emperor but a 'man of the people.\\"Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison, Cambridge University Press, 1997, , p. 9 With regard to Stalinism, they emphasize its bureaucratic character, and its \\"merging of the most modern with the most archaic traits\\" by combining modern technology and the latest methods of administration and propaganda with the ancient practice of arbitrary rule by a single man.Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison, Cambridge University Press, 1997, , p. 10 They compare this with the Prussian military tradition in Germany, which had been called \\"bureaucratic absolutism\\" in the eighteenth century, and which played a significant role in the organization of the Nazi state in the twentieth century.Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison, Cambridge University Press, 1997, , p. 11 Kershaw agrees with Mommsen that there was a fundamental difference between Nazism and Stalinism regarding the importance of the leader. Stalinism had an absolute leader, but he was not essential. He could be replaced by another. Nazism, on the other hand, was a \\"classic charismatic leadership movement,\\" defined entirely by its leader. Stalinism had an ideology which existed independently of Stalin. But for Nazism, \\"Hitler was ideological orthodoxy\\" ‚Äì Nazi ideals were by definition whatever Hitler said they were. In Stalinism, the bureaucratic apparatus was the foundation of the system, while in Nazism, the person of the leader was the foundation.Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison, Cambridge University Press, 1997, , p. 12-13 Moshe Lewin also focuses on the comparison between the personality cults of Hitler and Stalin, and their respective roles in Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. He refers to them as the \\"Hitler myth\\" and the \\"Stalin myth,\\" and argues that they served different functions within their two regimes. The function of the \\"Hitler myth\\" was to legitimize Nazi rule. The function of the \\"Stalin myth\\" was to legitimize not Soviet rule itself, but Stalin's leadership within the Party. Stalin's personality cult existed precisely because Stalin knew that he was replaceable, and feared that he might be replaced, and so needed to bolster his authority as much as possible. While the \\"Hitler myth\\" was essential to Nazi Germany, the \\"Stalin myth\\" was essential only to Stalin, not to the Soviet Union itself.Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison, Cambridge University Press, 1997, , p. 116  Intrinsic instability of totalitarian systems  Together with fellow historian Hans Mommsen, Lewin argues that the Stalinist and Nazi regimes featured an \\"intrinsic structural contradiction\\" which led to \\"inherent self-destructiveness\\": they depended on a highly organized state bureaucracy which was trying to set up complex rules and procedures for every aspect of life, yet this bureaucracy was under the complete personal control of a despot who made policy decisions as he saw fit, routinely changing his mind on major issues, without any regard for the rules and institutions which his own bureaucracy had set up. The bureaucracy and the leader needed each other, but also undermined each other with their different priorities. Mommsen sees this as being a much greater problem in Nazi Germany than in Stalin's Soviet Union, as the Nazis inherited large parts of the traditional German bureaucracy, while the Soviets largely built their own bureaucracy from the ground up.Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison, Cambridge University Press, 1997, , p. 12 He argues that many of the irrational features of the Nazi regime ‚Äì such as wasting resources on exterminating undesirable populations instead of using those resources in the war effort ‚Äì were caused by the dysfunction of the Nazi state rather than by fanatical commitment to Nazi ideology.Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison, Cambridge University Press, 1997, , p. 75 In accordance with the F√ºhrerprinzip, all decisional power in the Nazi state ultimately rested with Hitler. But Hitler often issued only vague and general directives, forcing other Nazi leaders lower down in the hierarchy to guess what precisely the F√ºhrer wanted. This confusion produced competition between Nazi officials, as each of them attempted to prove that he was a more dedicated Nazi than his rivals, by engaging in ever more extreme policies. This competition to please Hitler was, according to Mommsen, the real cause of Nazi irrationality.Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison, Cambridge University Press, 1997, , p. 81-82 Hitler was aware of it, and deliberately encouraged it out of a \\"social-darwinist conviction that the best man would ultimately prevail.\\"Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison, Cambridge University Press, 1997, , p. 82 Mommsen argues that this represents a structural difference between the regimes of Hitler and Stalin. In spite of its purges, Stalin's regime was more effective in building a stable bureaucracy, such that it was possible for the system to sustain itself and continue even without Stalin. The Nazi regime, on the other hand, was much more personalized and depended entirely on Hitler, being unable to build any lasting institutions.Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison, Cambridge University Press, 1997, , p. 85-87  Stalin and Hitler  Kershaw also saw major personal differences between Stalin and Hitler and their respective styles of rule. He describes Stalin as \\"a committee man, chief oligarch, man of the machine\\" and a \\"creature of his party,\\" who came to power only thanks to his party and his ability to manipulate the levers of power within that party.Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison, Cambridge University Press, 1997, , p. 90 Hitler, by contrast, came to power based on his charisma and mass appeal, and in the Nazi regime it was the leader that created the party instead of the other way around. According to Kershaw, \\"Stalin was a highly interventionist dictator, sending a stream of letters and directives determining or interfering with policy,\\" while Hitler \\"was a non-interventionist dictator as far as government administration was concerned,\\" preferring to involve himself in military affairs and plans for conquest rather than the daily routine of government work, and giving only broad verbal instructions to his subordinates regarding civilian affairs, which they were expected to translate into policy.Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison, Cambridge University Press, 1997, , p. 91-92 Furthermore, although both regimes featured all-pervasive cults of personality, there was a qualitative difference between those cults. Stalin's personality cult was \\"superimposed upon the Marxist-Leninist ideology and Communist Party,\\" and could be abandoned (or replaced with a personality cult around some other leader) without major changes to the regime. On the other hand, \\"the 'Hitler myth' was structurally indispensable to, in fact the very basis of, and scarcely distinguishable from, the Nazi Movement and its Weltanschauung.\\"Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison, Cambridge University Press, 1997, , p. 94 The belief in the person of Adolf Hitler as the unique savior of the German nation was the very foundation of Nazism, to such an extent that Nazism found it impossible to even imagine a successor to Hitler.Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison, Cambridge University Press, 1997, , p. 97 Thus, in Kershaw's analysis, Stalinism was a fundamentally bureaucratic system while Nazism was the embodiment of \\"charismatic authority\\" as described by Max Weber. Stalinism could exist without its leader. Nazism could not.Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison, Cambridge University Press, 1997, , p. 98  Henry Rousso, Nicholas Werth and Philippe Burrin  Nicolas Werth The topic of comparisons between Nazism and Stalinism was also studied in the 1990s and 2000s by historians Henry Rousso, Nicolas Werth and Philippe Burrin.Henry Rousso (ed.), Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared, University of Nebraska Press, 2004, , p. 9 = Differences between Stalinism and Nazism = Rousso defends the work of Carl Friedrich by pointing out that Friedrich himself had only said that Stalinism and Nazism were comparable, not that they were identical. Rousso also argues that the popularity of the concept of totalitarianism (the way that large numbers of people have come to routinely refer to certain governments as \\"totalitarian\\") should be seen as evidence that the concept is useful, that it really describes a specific type of government which is different from other dictatorships. At the same time, however, Rousso notes that the concept of totalitarianism is descriptive rather than analytical: the regimes described as totalitarian do not have a common origin and did not arise in similar ways. Nazism is unique among totalitarian regimes in having taken power in \\"a country endowed with an advanced industrial economy and with a system of political democracy (and an even older political pluralism).\\" All other examples of totalitarianism (including the Stalinist regime) took power, according to Rousso, \\"in an agrarian economy, in a poor society without a tradition of political pluralism, not to mention democracy, and where diverse forms of tyranny had traditionally prevailed.\\"Henry Rousso (ed.), Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared, University of Nebraska Press, 2004, , p. 11 He sees this as a weakness of the concept of totalitarianism, because it merely describes the similarities between Stalinism and Nazism without dealing with the very different ways they came to power.Henry Rousso (ed.), Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared, University of Nebraska Press, 2004, , p. 12 On the other hand, Rousso agrees with Hannah Arendt that \\"totalitarian regimes constitute something new in regard to classical tyranny, authoritarian regimes, or other forms of ancient and medieval dictatorships,\\" and he says that the main strength of the concept of totalitarianism is the way it highlights this inherent novelty of the regimes involved. = Conflict between the dictator and bureaucracy = Nicolas Werth and Philippe Burrin have worked together on comparative assessments of Stalinism and Nazism, with Werth covering the Stalinist regime and Burrin covering Nazi Germany. One of the topics they have studied is the question of how much power the dictator really held in the two regimes. Werth identifies two main historiographical approaches in the study of the Stalinist regime: Those who emphasize the power and control exercised by Joseph Stalin himself, attributing most of the actions of the Soviet government to deliberate plans and decisions made by him, and those who argue that Stalin had no pre-determined course of action in mind, that he was reacting to events as they unfolded, and that the Soviet bureaucracy had its own agenda which often differed from Stalin's wishes.Henry Rousso (ed.), Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared, University of Nebraska Press, 2004, , p. 29 Werth regards these as two mistaken extremes, one making Stalin seem all-powerful, the other making him seem like a weak dictator.Henry Rousso (ed.), Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared, University of Nebraska Press, 2004, , p. 30 However, he believes that the competing perspectives are useful in drawing attention to the tension between two different forms of organization in the Stalinist USSR: an \\"administrative system of command,\\" bureaucratic and resistant to change but effective in running the Soviet state, and the strategy of \\"running the country in a crudely despotic way by Stalin and his small cadre of directors.\\"Henry Rousso (ed.), Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared, University of Nebraska Press, 2004, , p. 31-32 Thus, Werth agrees with Lewin that there was an inherent conflict between the priorities of the Soviet bureaucracy and Stalin's accumulation of absolute power in his own hands. According to Werth, it was this unresolved and unstated conflict that led to the Great Purge and to the use of terror by Stalin's regime against its own party and state cadres.Henry Rousso (ed.), Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared, University of Nebraska Press, 2004, , p. 32 In studying similar issues with regard to the Nazi regime, Philippe Burrin draws attention to the debate between the \\"Intentionalist\\" and \\"Functionalist\\" schools of thought, which dealt with the question of whether the Nazi regime represented an extension of Hitler's autocratic will, faithfully obeying his wishes, or whether it was an essentially chaotic and uncontrollable system that functioned on its own with little direct input from the F√ºhrer.Henry Rousso (ed.), Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared, University of Nebraska Press, 2004, , p. 56 Like Kershaw and Lewin, Burrin says that the relationship between the leader and his party's ideology was different in Nazism compared to Stalinism: \\"One can rightly state that Nazism cannot be dissociated from Hitlerism, something that is difficult to affirm for Bolshevism and Stalinism.\\" Unlike Stalin, who inherited an existing system with an existing ideology and presented himself as the heir to the Leninist political tradition, Hitler created both his movement and its ideology by himself, claiming to be \\"someone sent by Providence, a Messiah whom the German people had been expecting for centuries, even for two thousand years, as Heinrich Himmler enjoyed saying.\\"Henry Rousso (ed.), Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared, University of Nebraska Press, 2004, , p. 57 Thus, there could be no real conflict between the Party and the leader in Nazi Germany, because the Nazi Party's entire reason for existence was to support and follow Hitler. However, there was a potential for division between the leader and the state bureaucracy, due to the way that Nazism came to power ‚Äì as part of an alliance with traditional conservative elites, industrialists, and the army.Henry Rousso (ed.), Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared, University of Nebraska Press, 2004, , p. 58 Unlike the USSR, Nazi Germany did not build its own state, but rather inherited the state machinery of the previous government. This provided the Nazis with an immediate supply of capable and experienced managers and military commanders, but on the other hand it also meant that the Nazi regime had to rely on the cooperation of people who had not been Nazis prior to Hitler's rise to power, and whose loyalty was questionable.Henry Rousso (ed.), Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared, University of Nebraska Press, 2004, , p. 58-59 It was only during the war, when Nazi Germany conquered large territories and had to create Nazi administrations for them, that brand new Nazi bureaucracies were created without any input or participation from traditional German elites. This produced a surprising difference between Nazism and Stalinism: When the Stalinist USSR conquered territory, it created smaller copies of itself and installed them as the governments of the occupied countries. When Nazi Germany conquered territory, on the other hand, it did not attempt to create copies of the German government back home. Instead, it experimented with different power structures and policies, often reflecting a \\"far more ample Nazification of society than what the balance of power authorized in the Reich.\\"Henry Rousso (ed.), Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared, University of Nebraska Press, 2004, , p. 65-66 = Role of terror and violence = Another major topic investigated by Werth and Burrin was the violence and terror employed by the regimes of Hitler and Stalin. Werth reports that the Stalinist USSR underwent an \\"extraordinary brutalization of the relations between state and society\\" for the purpose of rapid modernization and industrialization, to \\"gain one hundred years in one decade, and to metamorphose the country into a great industrial power.\\"Henry Rousso (ed.), Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared, University of Nebraska Press, 2004, , p. 73 This transformation was accomplished at the cost of massive violence and a sociopolitical regression into what Werth calls \\"military-feudal exploitation.\\" The types of violence employed by the Stalinist regime included loss of civil rights, mass arrests, deportations of entire ethnic groups from one part of the USSR to another, forced labor in the Gulag, mass executions (especially during the Great Terror of 1937‚Äì38), and most of all the great famine of 1932‚Äì33, known as the Holodomor.Henry Rousso (ed.), Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared, University of Nebraska Press, 2004, , p. 73-74 All levels of Soviet society were affected by Stalinist repression, from the top to the bottom. At the top, high-ranking members of the Communist Party were arrested and executed under the claim that they had plotted against Stalin (and in some cases they were forced to confess to imaginary crimes in show trials). At the bottom, the peasantry suffered the Holodomor famine (especially in Ukraine), and even outside of the famine years they were faced with very high grain quotas.Henry Rousso (ed.), Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared, University of Nebraska Press, 2004, , p. 74 Werth identifies four categories of people that became the targets of Stalinist violence in the USSR. He lists them from smallest to largest. The first and smallest group consisted of many of Stalin's former comrades-in-arms, who had participated in the revolution and were known as Old Bolsheviks. They were dangerous to Stalin because they had known him before his rise to power and could expose the many false claims made by his personality cult. The second group consisted of mid-level Communist Party officials, who were subject to mass arrests and executions in the late 1930s, particularly during the Great Purge. Eliminating them served a dual purpose: It helped Stalin to centralize power in the Kremlin (as opposed to regional centers), and it also provided him with \\"corrupt officials\\" that he could blame for earlier repressions and unpopular policies. Werth draws parallels between this and the old Tsarist tradition of blaming \\"bad bureaucrats\\" ‚Äì rather than the Tsar ‚Äì for unpopular government actions. The third group was made up of ordinary citizens from all walks of life who resorted to petty crime in order to provide for themselves in the face of worsening living standards (for example by taking home some wheat from the fields or tools from the factory). This type of petty crime became very widespread, and was often punished as if it were intentional sabotage motivated by political opposition to the USSR. The fourth and largest category consisted of ethnic groups that were subject to deportation, famine, or arbitrary arrests under the suspicion of being collectively disloyal to Stalin or to the Soviet state. This included the Holodomor famine directed at the Ukrainians, the deportation of ethnic groups suspected of pro-German sympathies (such as the Volga Germans, the Crimean Tatars, the Chechens and others), and eventually also persecution of ethnic Jews, especially as Stalin grew increasingly antisemitic near the end of his life.Henry Rousso (ed.), Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared, University of Nebraska Press, 2004, , p. 75Henry Rousso (ed.), Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared, University of Nebraska Press, 2004, , p. 87 Burrin's study of violence carried out by the Nazi regime begins with the observation that \\"violence is at the heart of Nazism,\\" and that Nazi violence is \\"established as a doctrine and exalted in speech.\\"Henry Rousso (ed.), Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared, University of Nebraska Press, 2004, , p. 96 This marks a point of difference between Nazism and Stalinism, according to Burrin. In Stalinism, there was a gulf between ideology and reality when it came to violence. The Soviet regime continuously denied that it was repressive, proclaimed itself a defender of peace, and sought to conceal all the evidence to the contrary. In Nazism, on the other hand, \\"doctrine and reality were fused from the start.\\" Nazism not only practiced violent repression and war, but advocated it in principle as well, considering war to be a positive force in human civilization and openly seeking \\"living space\\" and the domination of the European continent by ethnic Germans. Burrin identifies three motivations for Nazi violence: political repression, exclusion and social repression, and racial politics.Henry Rousso (ed.), Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared, University of Nebraska Press, 2004, , p. 97 The first of these, political repression, is common in many dictatorships. The Nazis aimed to eliminate their real or imagined political opponents, first in the Reich and later in the occupied territories during the war. Some of these opponents were executed, while others were imprisoned in concentration camps. The first targets of political repression, immediately after Hitler's rise to power in 1933, were the parties of the left in general and the Communists in particular. Then, after the mid-1930s, repression was extended to members of the clergy, and later to the conservative opposition as well (especially after the failed attempt to assassinate Hitler in 1944). The death penalty was used on a wide scale, even before the war. During the war, political repression was greatly expanded both inside Germany and especially in the newly occupied territories. Political prisoners in the concentration camps numbered only about 25,000 at the beginning of the war. By January 1945 they had swelled to 714,211 ‚Äì most of them non-Germans accused of plotting against the Reich. The second type of Nazi violence, motivated by exclusion and social repression, was the violence aimed at purging German society of people whose lifestyle was considered incompatible with the social norms of the Nazi regime (even if the people involved were racially pure and able-bodied). Such people were divided into two categories: homosexuals and \\"asocials.\\" The \\"asocials\\" were only vaguely defined, and included \\"Gypsies, tramps, beggars, prostitutes, alcoholics, the jobless who refused any employment, and those who left their work frequently or for no reason.\\" The third and final type of Nazi violence, by far the most extensive, was violence motivated by Nazi racial policies. This was aimed both inward, to cleanse the \\"Aryan race\\" of \\"degenerate\\" elements and life unworthy of life, as well as outward, to seek the extermination of \\"inferior races\\". Germans considered physically or mentally unfit were among the first victims. One of the first laws of the Nazi regime mandated the forced sterilization of people suffering from physical handicaps or who had psychiatric conditions deemed to be hereditary. Later, sterilization was replaced by murder of the mentally ill and of people with severe disabilities, as part of a \\"euthanasia\\" program called Aktion T4.Henry Rousso (ed.), Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared, University of Nebraska Press, 2004, , p. 99 Burrin notes that this served no practical political purpose ‚Äì the people being murdered could not have possibly been political opponents of the regime ‚Äì so the motivation was purely a matter of racial ideology.Henry Rousso (ed.), Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared, University of Nebraska Press, 2004, , p. 100 The most systematic and by far the most large-scale acts of Nazi violence, however, were directed at \\"racially inferior\\" non-German populations. As laid out in Generalplan Ost, the Nazis wished to eliminate most of the Slavic populations of Eastern Europe, partly through deportation and partly through murder, in order to secure land for ethnic German settlement and colonization.Henry Rousso (ed.), Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared, University of Nebraska Press, 2004, , p. 101 But even more urgently, the Nazis wished to exterminate the Jews of Europe, whom they regarded as the implacable racial enemy of the Germans. This culminated in the Holocaust, the Nazi genocide of the Jews. Unlike in the case of all other target populations, the Jews were to be exterminated completely, with no individual exceptions for any reason.Henry Rousso (ed.), Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared, University of Nebraska Press, 2004, , p. 102  Michael Geyer and Sheila Fitzpatrick  In Beyond Totalitarianism: Stalinism and Nazism Compared, editors Michael Geyer and Sheila Fitzpatrick disputed the concept of totalitarianism, noting that the term entered political discourse first as a term of self-description by the Italian Fascists and was only later used as a framework to compare Nazi Germany with the Soviet Union.Geyer (2009). p. 3-4 They argued that the totalitarian states were not as monolithic or as ideology-driven as they seemed.Geyer (2009). p. 8 Geyer and Fitzpatrick describe Nazi Germany and the Stalinist USSR as \\"immensely powerful, threatening, and contagious dictatorships\\" who \\"shook the world in their antagonism.\\"Geyer (2009). p. 9 Without calling them totalitarian, they identified their common features, including genocide, an all-powerful party, a charismatic leader, and pervasive invasion of privacy.Geyer (2009). p. 12 However, they argue that Stalinism and Nazism did not represent a new and unique type of government, but rather that they can be placed in the broader context of the turn to dictatorship in Europe in the interwar period.Geyer (2009). p. 17 The reason they appear extraordinary is because they were the \\"most prominent, most hard-headed, and most violent\\" of the European dictatorships of the 20th century.Geyer (2009). p. 19 They are comparable because of their \\"shock and awe\\" and sheer ruthlessness, but underneath superficial similarities they were fundamentally different and that \\"when it comes to one-on-one comparison, the two societies and regimes may as well have hailed from different worlds.\\"Geyer (2009). p. 21 According to Geyer and Fitzpatrick, the similarities between Nazism and Stalinism stem from the fact that they were both \\"ideology driven\\" and sought to subordinate all aspects of life to their respective ideologies. The differences stem from the fact that their ideologies were opposed to each other and regarded each other as enemies. Another major difference is that Stalin created a stable and long-lasting regime, while Nazi Germany had a \\"short-lived, explosive nature.\\" Notably, the stable state created by Stalinism was based on an entirely new elite, while Nazism, despite having the support of the traditional elite, failed to achieve stability.Geyer (2009). p. 30 However, the two regimes did borrow ideas from one another, especially regarding propaganda techniques (most of all in architecture and cinema), but also in terms of state surveillance and antisemitism. At the same time, they both vigorously denied borrowing anything from each other.Geyer (2009). p. 23-24 While their methods of propaganda were similar, the content was different. For instance, Soviet wartime propaganda revolved around the idea of resisting imperial aggression, while Nazi propaganda was about wars of racial conquest.Geyer (2009). p. 36 Geyer and Fitzpatrick also take note of the fact that both Stalinism and Nazism sought to create a New Man, an \\"entirely modern, illiberal, and self-fashioned personage,\\" even though they had different visions about what being a \\"New Man\\" would mean.Geyer (2009). p. 34 = Biopolitics, eugenics and social engineering = Among the other authors contributing to the volume edited by Geyer and Fitzpatrick, David L. Hoffmann and Annette Timm discuss biopolitics and the pro-natalist policies of the Nazi and Stalinist regimes. Both governments were highly concerned over low fertility rates in their respective populations, and applied extensive and intrusive social engineering techniques to increase the number of births.Geyer (2009). pp. 83-97. Reproductive policies in the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany were administered through their health care systems‚Äîboth regimes saw health care as a key pillar to their designs to develop a new society.Geyer (2009). p. 98. While the Soviet Union had to design a public health care system from scratch, Nazi Germany built upon the pre-existing public health care system in Germany that had existed since 1883, when Otto von Bismarck's legislation had created the world's first national public health care program. The Nazis centralized the German health care system in order to enforce Nazi ideological components upon it, and replaced existing voluntary and government welfare agencies with new ones that were devoted to racial hygiene and other components of Nazi ideology.Geyer (2009). pp. 98-99. The Nazi and Stalinist attempt to control family size was not unique, as many other European states practiced eugenics at this time (including most of the Allies), and the Stalinist and Nazi ideals were vastly different.Geyer (2009). p. 87. In fact, they had more in common with third parties than with each other: Nazi Germany's policies were rather similar to those in Scandinavia at the time, while the USSR's policies resembled those in Catholic countries.Geyer (2009). p. 29 The common point between Nazi and Stalinist practices was the connection of reproduction policies with the ideological goals of the state ‚Äî \\"part of the project of a rational, hypermodern vision for the re-organization of society\\".Geyer (2009). p. 88. There were nevertheless substantial differences between the two regimes' approaches. Stalin's Soviet Union never officially supported eugenics as the Nazis did‚Äîthe Soviet government called eugenics a \\"fascist science\\"‚Äîalthough there were in fact Soviet eugenicists. The two regimes also had different approaches to the relationship between family and paid labor‚ÄîNazism promoted the male single-breadwinner family while Stalinism promoted the dual-wage-earner household.Geyer (2009). p. 90. = Mass violence, xenophobia and persecution of ethnic minorities = In another contribution to the same volume, Christian Gerlach and Nicolas Werth discuss the topic of mass violence, and the way that it was used by both Stalinism and Nazism.Geyer (2009). p. 133. Both Stalin's Soviet Union and Nazi Germany were violent societies where mass violence was accepted by the state, such as in the Great Terror of 1937 to 1938 in the Soviet Union and the Holocaust in Nazi Germany and its occupied territories in World War II.Geyer (2009). Pp. 135, 139-151. Both the Stalinist Soviet Union and Nazi Germany utilized internment camps led by agents of the state ‚Äì the NKVD in the Soviet Union and the SS in Nazi Germany. They also both engaged in violence against minorities based on xenophobia ‚Äì the xenophobic violence of the Nazis was outspoken but rationalized as being against \\"asocial\\" elements while the xenophobic violence of the Stalinists was disguised as being against \\"anti-soviet\\", \\"counter- revolutionary\\" and \\"socially harmful\\" elements ‚Äì a term which often targeted diaspora nationalities.Geyer (2009). p. 135. The Stalinist Soviet Union established \\"special settlements\\" where the \\"socially harmful\\" or \\"socially dangerous\\" who included ex-convicts, criminals, vagrants, the disenfranchised and \\"declassed elements\\" were expelled to.Geyer (2009). Pp. 139-140. These \\"special settlements\\" were largely in Siberia, the far north, the Urals, or other inhospitable territories.Geyer (2009). p. 140. In July 1933, the Soviet Union made a mass arrest of 5,000 Romani people effectively on the basis of their ethnicity, who were deported that month to the \\"special settlements\\" in Western Siberia. In 1935, the Soviet Union arrested 160,000 homeless people and juvenile delinquents and sent many of them to NKVD labor colonies where they did forced labor.Geyer (2009). p. 141. The Nazi regime was founded upon a racialist view of politics and envisioned the deportation or extermination of the majority of the population of Eastern Europe in order to open up \\"living space\\" for ethnic German settlers.Geyer (2009). p. 152 This was mainly intended to be carried out after an eventual German victory in the war, but steps had already started being taken while the war was still ongoing. For instance, by the end of 1942, the Nazis had deported 365,000 Poles and Jews from their original homes in western Poland (now German-annexed) and into the General Government. A further 194,000 Poles were internally displaced (not deported to another territory but expelled from their homes). The Nazis had also deported 100,000 persons from Alsace, Lorraine, and Luxembourg, as well as 54,000 Slovenians.Geyer (2009). p. 154 Stalinism in practice in the Soviet Union pursued ethnic deportations from the 1930s to the early 1950s, with a total of 3 million Soviet citizens being subjected to ethnic-based resettlement.Geyer (2009). pp. 157-158. The first major ethnic deportation took place from December 1932 to January 1933, during which some 60,000 Kuban Cossacks were collectively criminally charged as a whole with association with resistance to socialism and affiliation with Ukrainian nationalism.Geyer (2009). p. 158. From 1935 to 1936, the Soviet Union deported Soviet citizens of Polish and German origins living in the western districts of Ukraine, and Soviet citizens of Finnish origins living on the Finland-Soviet Union border. These deportations from 1935 to 1936 affected tens of thousands of families. From September to October 1937, Soviet authorities deported the Korean minority from its Far Eastern region that bordered on Japanese-controlled Korea. Soviet authorities claimed the territory was \\"rich soil for the Japanese to till\\" ‚Äì implying a Soviet suspicion that the Koreans could potentially join forces with the Japanese to unite the land with Japanese-held Korea. Over 170,000 Koreans were deported to remote parts of Soviet Central Asia from September to October 1937. These ethnically-based deportations reflected a new trend in Stalinist policy, a \\"Soviet xenophobia\\" based on ideological grounds that suspected that these people were susceptible to foreign influence, and which was also based on a resurgent Russian nationalism. After Nazi Germany declared war on the Soviet Union in 1941, the Soviet Union initiated another major round of ethnic deportations. The first group targeted were Soviet Germans. Between September 1941 and February 1942, 900,000 people ‚Äì over 70 percent of the entire Soviet German community ‚Äì were deported to Kazakhstan and Siberia in mass operations.Geyer (2009). pp. 158-159. A second wave of mass deportations took place between November 1943 and May 1944, in which Soviet authorities expelled six ethnic groups (the Balkars, Chechens, Crimean Tatars, Ingush, Karachai, and Kalmyks) that together numbered 900,000.Geyer (2009). p. 159. There were also smaller-scale operations involving ethnic cleansing of diaspora minorities during and after World War II, in which tens of thousands of Crimean Bulgarians, Greeks, Iranians, Khemshils, Kurds, and Meskhetian Turks were deported from the Black Sea and Transcaucasian border regions. Two ethnic groups that were specifically targeted for persecution by Stalin's Soviet Union were the Chechens and the Ingush. Unlike the other nationalities that could be suspected of connection to foreign states which shared their ethnic background, the Chechens and the Ingush were completely indigenous people of the Soviet Union. Rather than being accused of collaboration with foreign enemies, these two ethnic groups were considered to have cultures which did not fit in with Soviet culture ‚Äì such as accusing Chechens of being associated with \\"banditism\\" ‚Äì and the authorities claimed that the Soviet Union had to intervene in order to \\"remake\\" and \\"reform\\" these cultures. In practice this meant heavily armed punitive operations carried out against Chechen \\"bandits\\" that failed to achieve forced assimilation, culminating in an ethnic cleansing operation in 1944, which involved the arrests and deportation of over 500,000 Chechens and Ingush from the Caucasus to Central Asia and Kazakhstan.Geyer (2009). pp. 159‚Äì160. The deportations of the Chechens and Ingush also involved the outright massacre of thousands of people, and severe conditions placed upon the deportees ‚Äì they were put in unsealed train cars, with little to no food for a four-week journey during which many died from hunger and exhaustion.Geyer (2009). p. 160. The main difference between Nazi and Stalinist deportations was in their purpose: while Nazi Germany sought ethnic cleansing to allow settlement by Germans into the cleansed territory, Stalin's Soviet Union pursued ethnic cleansing in order to remove minorities from strategically important areas.Geyer (2009). p. 161.  Other scholars  Other historians and political scientists have also made comparisons between Nazism and Stalinism as part of their work. In his work on fascism, Stanley Payne said that although the Nazi Party was ideologically opposed to communism, Adolf Hitler and other Nazi leaders frequently expressed recognition that only in Soviet Russia were their revolutionary and ideological counterparts to be found. Both placed a major emphasis on creating a \\"party-army,\\" with the regular armed forces controlled by the party. In the case of the Soviet Union this was done through the political commissars, while Nazi Germany introduced a roughly equivalent leadership role for \\"National Socialist Guidance Officers\\" in 1943.Payne (1983). p. 103. In his work on communism titled Passing of an Illusion, Fran√ßois Furet commented that Hitler personally admired Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, and on numerous occasions publicly praised Stalin for seeking to purify the Communist Party of the Soviet Union of Jewish influences, especially by purging Jewish communists such as Leon Trotsky, Grigory Zinoviev, Lev Kamenev and Karl Radek.Fran√ßois Furet. Passing of an Illusion: The Idea of Communism in the Twentieth Century. University of Chicago Press, 1999. . Pp. 191-192. Richard Pipes draws attention to Stalin and his antisemitism in a parallel with Nazi antisemitism. He notes that soon after the 1917 October Revolution, the Soviet Union undertook practices to break up Jewish culture, religion and language. In the fall of 1918, the Soviet Communist Party set up the Jewish section Yevsektsiya, with a stated mission of \\"destruction of traditional Jewish life, the Zionist movement, and Hebrew culture.\\"Richard Pipes, \\"Russia Under the Bolshevik Regime\\", New York: NY, Vintage Books, Random House Inc., 1995, p. 363 By 1919, the Bolsheviks began to confiscate Jewish properties, Hebrew schools, libraries, books, and synagogues in accordance with newly imposed anti-religious laws, turning their buildings into \\"Communist centers, clubs or restaurants.\\"Richard Pipes, \\"Russia Under the Bolshevik Regime\\", New York: NY, Vintage Books, Random House Inc., 1995, p. 364 After Joseph Stalin rose to power, antisemitism continued to be endemic throughout Russia, although official Soviet policy condemned it. On 12 August 1952, Stalin's personal antisemitism became more visible, as he ordered the execution of the most prominent Yiddish authors in the Soviet Union, in an event known as the Night of the Murdered Poets. Shortly before his death, Stalin also organized the anti-Semitic campaign known as the Doctors' plot. A number of research institutions are focusing on the analysis of fascism/Nazism and Stalinism/communism, and the comparative approach, including the Hannah Arendt Institute for the Research on Totalitarianism in Germany, the Institute for the Study of Totalitarian Regimes in the Czech Republic and the Institute of National Remembrance in Poland. In comparing the deaths caused by both Stalin and Hitler's policies, historians have asserted that archival evidence released after the collapse of the USSR confirms that Stalin did not kill more people than Hitler. In 2011, American historian Timothy D. Snyder said the Nazi regime killed about 11 million non-combatants (which rises to above 12 million if \\"foreseeable deaths from deportation, hunger, and sentences in concentration camps are included\\"), with analogous figures for Stalin's regime being roughly 6 and 9 million. Australian historian and archival researcher Stephen G. Wheatcroft posits that \\"The Stalinist regime was consequently responsible for about a million purposive killings, and through its criminal neglect and irresponsibility it was probably responsible for the premature deaths of about another two million more victims amongst the repressed population, i.e. in the camps, colonies, prisons, exile, in transit and in the POW camps for Germans. These are clearly much lower figures than those for whom Hitler's regime was responsible.\\" Wheatcroft also says that, unlike Hitler, Stalin's \\"purposive killings\\" fit more closely into the category of \\"execution\\" than \\"murder\\", given he thought the accused were indeed guilty of crimes against the state and insisted on documentation, whereas Hitler simply wanted to kill Jews and communists because of who they were, and insisted on no documentation and was indifferent at even a pretence of legality for these actions. Kristen Ghodsee, an ethnographer of post-Cold War Eastern Europe, contends that the efforts to institutionalize the \\"double genocide thesis\\", or the moral equivalence between the Nazi Holocaust (race murder) and the victims of communism (class murder), and in particular the recent push at the beginning of the global financial crisis for commemoration of the latter in Europe, can be seen as the response by economic and political elites to fears of a leftist resurgence in the face of devastated economies and extreme inequalities in both the East and West as the result of neoliberal capitalism. She notes that any discussion of the achievements under communism, including literacy, education, women's rights, and social security is usually silenced, and any discourse on the subject of communism is focused almost exclusively on Stalin's crimes and the \\"double genocide thesis\\", an intellectual paradigm summed up as such: \\"1) any move towards redistribution and away from a completely free market is seen as communist; 2) anything communist inevitably leads to class murder; and 3) class murder is the moral equivalent of the Holocaust.\\" By linking all leftist and socialist ideals to the excesses of Stalinism, Ghodsee concludes, the elites in the West hope to discredit and marginalize all political ideologies that could \\"threaten the primacy of private property and free markets.\\" Political scientist Michael Parenti states that many of the narratives which equate Nazism (or Fascism more generally) and Stalinism (or Communism more generally) are often simplistic and usually omit the class interests of each respective movement. Parenti says that the fascists in Germany and Italy, in spite of \\"some meager social programs\\" and public works projects designed to bolster nationalist sentiment, supported and served the interests of big business and the capitalist class at the expense of the workers by outlawing strikes and unions, privatizing state-owned mills, plants and banks along with farm cooperatives, abolishing workplace safety regulations, minimum wage laws and overtime pay, and subsidizing heavy industry. This resulted in the fascists having many admirers and supporters among the capitalist class in their own nations and throughout the West, including the United States. By contrast, while stating there were deficiencies in Marxist‚ÄìLeninist states (some of which he attributes to maldevelopment due to outside pressure from a hostile capitalist world) and acknowledging the numerous state-sanctioned imprisonments and killings (which he claims were exaggerated for political reasons), Parenti asserts that the Stalinist regime in particular \\"made dramatic gains in literacy, industrial wages, health care and women's rights,\\" and communist revolutions in general \\"created a life for the mass of people that was far better than the wretched existence they had endured under feudal lords, military bosses, foreign colonizers and Western capitalists.\\" The comparison of Stalinism and Nazism remains a neglected field of academic study.Geyer (2009). p. 19.

The 2008 Prague Declaration on European Conscience and Communism, initiated by the Czech government and signed by figures such as V√°clav Havel, called for \\"a common approach regarding crimes of totalitarian regimes, inter alia Communist regimes\\". It also called for \\"[r]eaching an all-European understanding that both the Nazi and Communist totalitarian regimes each to be judged by their own terrible merits to be destructive in their policies of systematically applying extreme forms of terror, suppressing all civic and human liberties, starting aggressive wars and, as an inseparable part of their ideologies, exterminating and deporting whole nations and groups of population; and that as such they should be considered to be the main disasters, which blighted the 20th century\\". The Communist Party of Greece opposes the Prague Declaration and has criticized \\"the new escalation of the anti-communist hysteria led by the EU council, the European Commission and the political staff of the bourgeois class in the European Parliament.\\" The Communist Party of Britain opined that the Prague Declaration \\"is a rehash of the persistent attempts by reactionary historians to equate Soviet Communism and Hitlerite Fascism, echoing the old slanders of British authors George Orwell and Robert Conquest.\\" The 2008 documentary film The Soviet Story, commissioned by the Union for Europe of the Nations group in the European Parliament, published archival records which listed thousands of German Jews who were arrested in the Soviet Union by the NKVD (People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs) from 1937 to 1941 and handed over to Gestapo or SS officials in Germany. These German Jews had originally sought asylum in the USSR. The documentary film accuses Stalin's regime of being an accomplice in Hitler's Holocaust by arresting these asylum seekers and sending them back to Germany.Snore, Edvins (writer/director).

Since 2009, the European Union has officially commemorated the European Day of Remembrance for Victims of Stalinism and Nazism, proclaimed by the European Parliament in 2008 and endorsed by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe in 2009, and officially known as the Black Ribbon Day in some countries (including Canada). The former President of the European Parliament and Christian Democratic Union member, Hans-Gert P√∂ttering, argued that \\"both totalitarian systems (Stalinism and Nazism) are comparable and terrible.\\" In some Eastern European countries, the denial of both Nazi and Communist crimes has been explicitly outlawed, and Czech foreign minister Karel Schwarzenberg has argued that \\"there is a fundamental concern here that totalitarian systems be measured by the same standard.\\" However, the European Commission rejected calls for similar EU-wide legislation, due to the lack of consensus among member states. A statement adopted by Russia's legislature said that comparisons of Nazism and Stalinism are \\"blasphemous towards all of the anti- fascist movement veterans, Holocaust victims, concentration camp prisoners and tens of millions of people ... who sacrificed their lives for the sake of the fight against the Nazis' anti-human racial theory.\\" British journalist and Labour Party aide Seumas Milne posits that the impact of the post-Cold War narrative that Stalin and Hitler were twin evils, and therefore Communism is as monstrous as Nazism, \\"has been to relativise the unique crimes of Nazism, bury those of colonialism and feed the idea that any attempt at radical social change will always lead to suffering, killing and failure.\\"Milne, Seumas (12 September 2002). \\"The battle for history\\".

Location Elcho Priory was located in the parish of Rhynd about three miles southeast of Perth on the south bank of the River Tay. It was the only Cistercian convent in Scotland north of the Firth of Forth. It was a mile west of Elcho Castle. In addition to its own land, the priory rented nearby lands, one being part of the Hill of Coates, which was behind the nunnery. The nunnery church stood on the north side of the site, aligned east-west with entrance on the west. It originally measured 7 m. wide x 15 m. long but was expanded in a second phase of building to 8 m. x 21 m. The priory was located in the western portion of the barony of Elcho, which, with Elcho Castle, was held by the Wemyss family. Before the Reformation, the reciprocal relationship between the two was that the laird of Wemyss would provide protection for the nuns during periods of English invasion, and, in return, the priory leased certain of their lands to him. Founding Scottish historian Ian B. Cowan once said of Elcho, ‚ÄúThe history of the nunnery is obscure.‚Äù It is said to have been founded ‚Äúbefore 1241‚Äù by David Lindsay of Glenesk (ancestor of the earls of Crawford) and his mother, Mary Abernethy, daughter of Alexander Abernethy of that Ilk, who held lands at Elcho during the reign of Robert the Bruce. Alternatively, the mother of David Lindsay has been identified as Aleonora de Limesay or Limassi, daughter of Gerarde de Limesay. According to Ballingal, Elcho was originally attached to Dunfermline Abbey and later to the Abbey of Scone, but Stuart states that ‚Äúfrom charter evidence this convent continued to be a dependency of the priory of May and the abbots of Reading.‚Äù A Cistercian house, Elcho was one of four monasteries founded along the Tay River, the others being Scone Abbey, which was Augustinian; Lindores Abbey, which was Tironensian, and Balmerino Abbey, which was another Cistercian house. Cistercian Order As a Cistercian establishment, Elcho would have enforced one of the strictest monastic codes. The nuns would have lived at subsistence levels, strictly observing all fasts and refraining from conversation, except on religious subjects. Cistercians maintained ‚Äúan establishment of labourers‚Äù for agricultural labor, tilling, gardening, tending orchards and fields, and keeping sheep and cattle. Inhabitants Historian Kimm Curran has pointed out that women in medieval Scottish convents came primarily from families in the surrounding area, ‚Äúmost within a fifteen-mile radius of their convent.‚Äù Ballingal believed likewise, showing that the roll for the year 1532 listed eleven nuns whose surnames are all connected with the district: Elinor Stewart, Christian Moncrief, Kathryn (or Katrina) Smith, Christian Redpath, Margaret Swinton, Isabel Barclay, Margaret Towers, Elizabeth Pollok, Christian (or Christine) Wemyss, Isobel Wedderburn, and Eupheme Leslie, the prioress. Euphemia Leslie (often presented in documents as Eupheme, Eufeme, or Euphame] is perhaps the most well-known prioress, yet her parentage and family connections have been the subject of much speculation. *She has been identified as the illegitimate daughter of Walter Leslie, parish priest at Kirkton of Menmuir (a parish within today's Angus). *Based on the fact that her personal seal bore the arms of Leslie and Stewart of Atholl, historian Marion L. Stavert has suggested her father was probably James Leslie, 2nd baron of Pitcaple, and her mother, a daughter of John Stewart, Earl of Atholl, though there is no record of a marriage between the two. *In his history of the family of Leslie, Col. Charles Joseph Leslie states unequivocally that she was the daughter Walter Leslie, parson at Monymusk, and his second wife, Elizabeth Stewart, daughter of the earl of Atholl. (Walter Leslie was the son of James Leslie, 2nd Baron of Pitcaple, and his wife Elizabeth Seton, daughter of the baron of Meldrum.) *Others have associated her with the Leslies of Rothes. *She is also said to be the sister (or half-sister or daughter) of Robert Leslie, who was procurator for the convent in the arrangements regarding the succession of Euphemia to the position of prioress. Janet Leslie, niece of Euphemia Leslie, was at the convent during her aunt's tenure as prioress, 1539-40 specifically. A known subprioress of Elcho (1525‚Äì26) was Elizabeth Rollock, who is later listed as a nun (1532‚Äì40). Though the prioresses would have come mainly from wealthy families, Curran speculates that some of the nuns were daughters of common folk, noting specifically Katrina Smith, whose surname, she believes, indicates humble origins. Certainly it is known that not all of the nuns were literate. In a document of 1532, the prioress signed as ‚ÄúEufem priores with our hand,‚Äù but the names of the other nine, who were recorded as ‚Äúsiesciens scribere‚Äù (not knowing to write), were written down by the notary. The name of Elizabeth Pait is known inasmuch as she was listed as receiving a pension from Elcho and was mentioned in Euphemia Leslie's will. However, her family is unknown. Not all residents at the priory were nuns. Margaret, the second daughter of Scotland's king, James II, took up residence at Elcho during the reign of her nephew, James IV, arriving around Martinmas in 1489 with enough money to maintain her until 1502. The king's support for Margaret is apparent in his account books, where ‚Äúsupplies for the Lady Margaret‚Äù are frequently itemized, once with the specific notation of ‚Äúa new dress for the ladye in Elquo.‚Äù Margaret was not a nun, but as Ballingal explains, ‚Äú those unsettled times a religious house was the only safe place for an unprotected lady.‚Äù The king's interest in Elcho persisted, since Margaret Swinton of Kimmerghame suggested having royal protection under James IV when she was prioress in 1503. Indeed, on 20 June that year, he signed a deed in which he granted his ‚Äúfirm peace and protection to the Prioress and the religious women with her for their lands, their men, and their whole possessions and goods, moveable and immoveable, ecclesiastical and secular.‚Äù Notice of this service was published on 1 July at the market cross of Haddington in East Lothian since some of the property of the priory, the Standards (or Standardlandis), was situated in the constabulary of Haddington. 16th-Century Insolvency and Recovery Euphemia Leslie was apparently brought up at Elcho, and at the age of 18 sought papal dispensation to become the convent's prioress, a request that was granted by a papal bull c. 1524/5. This bull also called for the resignation of Elizabeth Swinton, under whose headship the monastery had been brought near financial ruin. Dame Elizabeth maintained the problems were brought on not by her personal mismanagement, but by the violence of John Stewart, 3rd Earl of Atholl and Bishop Andrew Stewart of Caithness, who, with a force of 80 armed men, had forced their way into the monastery and confined her in a chamber. For three years or more, due to various pleas against the monastery which ‚Äúuplifted the fruits and possessions ‚Äòby force and arms,‚Äô‚Äù the only way she could sustain and protect the monastery was to sell priory possessions such as ‚Äúcups and other precious things.‚Äù Whatever the cause of the disaster, it was up to Euphemia Leslie to reinvigorate the priory. To this end, her brother Robert Leslie of Innerpeffray, devised various ways to help the monastery recover financially, including the expenditure of his own money to redeem the cups and to sustain the monastery for two years. In return, Dame Euphemia ‚Äúgranted him a charter of the lands of Kinnaird and the ‚Äòfeu-farm‚Äô of the same and also the fermes [feus] of the lands of Binning amounting respectively to 50 and 21 merks.‚Äù Assassination As David II was preparing to invade England in 1346, he summoned his barons to meet at Perth. Among these were Raghnall Mac Ruaidhr√≠ and William III, Earl of Ross, from whom Raghnall held Kintail. Responding to the call, Raghnall quartered his men at the priory of Elcho a few miles from the city. He apparently was planning to meet up with the king the following day, but during the night, earl William, who had entered into a feud with Raghnall, took advantage of his vassal‚Äôs proximity. In the middle of the night, he broke into the monastery, killed Raghnall and seven of his men, and fled north, others following, so that the king was left short-handed on the eve of his invasion. The act of treachery was deemed a bad omen by many, and, in fact, soon after, David was taken captive in England, where he remained a prisoner for eleven years. Mugdrum Cross According to local tradition, the nuns of Elcho would annually make their way south to Ecclesia Magridin, or Exmagirdle, in Fife to pay respects to Saint Magridin. Along the way, they would stop at Mugdrum Cross (the name Mugdrum being a corrupted pronunciation of Magridin), where they would be met by the monks of Lindores Abbey. At the cross, they greeted each other and paid their devotions to the saint before proceeding on to Ecclesia Magridin. The causeway on which the monks traveled to Mugdrum can no longer be seen, though James Cant reported that parts were still visible near Muirmouth in 1774. Attack and decline After Scotland‚Äôs defeat by England‚Äôs Henry VIII at the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh, September 1547, the English tried to establish themselves in the Scottish Lowlands and Border areas, and on 29 December the English commander at Broughty ‚Äúsent Mr. Wyndham to burn a nunnery within 2 miles of St. Johnstoun [Perth] who brought away all the nuns and many gentlemen‚Äôs daughters at school with them.‚Äù Sir John Wemyss, who was charged with their protection, came to their assistance after this attack, giving them money for repairs to the church and other buildings. He also lent them twenty bolls (6,300 lbs.) of barley, which they gratefully acknowledged, promising to repay the barley from the following year's crop. A few years later, he lent them 200 merks to relieve debts which were about to place them ‚Äúunder process of cursing,‚Äù a form of excommunication which has been described as ‚Äúlegal execution against person and property‚Äù and ‚Äúthe preliminary step of a warrant for arrest and imprisonment, and for the impounding and seizure of goods.‚Äù In such a case, the religious work of the priory would have come to an end. Unable to repay Wemyss, the priory feued (i.e., leased) to him the Mains and Grange of Elcho for ¬£40 Scots yearly. ‚ÄúThus, by the time of the Reformation of 1560, all the priory lands except the building itself and its orchard were in the hands of John Wemyss who continued to look after the nuns‚Äô affairs until his death in 1572. However, it would appear that they were unable to return to Elcho as it was beyond their means to repair.‚Äù By the end of 1570, Euphemia Leslie had died and the commendatorship of the priory had passed to Andrew Moncrieff, who conveyed the monastery along with its ‚Äúorchards, precincts, and pertinents‚Äù to his brother William, describing them all as ‚Äúlying waste and without inhabitant.‚Äù Though no longer at the monastery, the nuns were probably still in the neighborhood, possibly under Wemyss's protection, as they ‚Äúappointed him their procurator to pursue the commendator and his father for satisfaction and sustentation of them during their lives.‚Äù Euphemia Leslie and two of her servants are known to have resided in a property in Perth from the time they left the priory until her death. One of them, Helen Stewart, married and, with her husband, acknowledged receiving a yearly pension of 20 merks from the rents of Elcho paid by the then laird of Wemyss. Remains Very little remains today of the priory of Elcho. In 1760, Bishop Richard Pococke could still see ‚Äúthe tower of the church and the foundations of the buildings,‚Äù and in 1789, some remains of the nunnery were still visible ‚Äúencompassed with an orchard.‚Äù However, by 1905, James Ballingal noted that Grange of Elcho had ‚Äúupon it the scarcely visible remnants of Elcho nunnery,‚Äù and in the 1960s, archaeologists reported only ‚Äúgrassed-over foundations of at least two rectangular buildings.‚Äù Archaeological excavations occurred at the site of Elcho priory between October 1968 and July 1973. Though it cannot be known with certainty whether burials unearthed at the site were made during the time when the nunnery was active, excavators discovered skeletal remains of 31 persons: 21 infants, children, and young adults; and 10 adults, both male and female, ranging in age from 20 to 55. These were probably the remains of persons who would have expected a privilege of burial at the site of the priory. This would include patrons of the nunnery and their families as well as the families of the lay workers who farmed and maintained the priory's lands. Artifacts found at the priory also included pottery, stained glass, pins and lace-ends for shrouds, and parts of a bronze lamp. Also uncovered were Scottish coins from the reign of James IV (1488-1513) and English coins from that of Henry VIII (1509-1547); an iron key; leatherworking tools; and items of worked bone, including a die, two beads (possibly rosary beads), and parts of possible handles). Animal bones discovered at the site revealed the presence of both domesticated animals and farm animals: cattle, sheep or goats, pigs, birds, fish and shellfish, a horse, a dog, a cat, a hare, a squirrel, and possibly a roe deer.

The gang was formed in the jails of El Paso in 1986 and expanded into a transnational criminal organization. Currently one of the most violent gangs in the United States, they are said to have over 3,000 members across the country in locations such as New Mexico, Texas, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania as well as at least 5,000 members in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico. In 2008, Barrio Azteca formed an alliance with La L√≠nea, the armed wing of the Ju√°rez Cartel, to fight off the forces of the Sinaloa Cartel, who were attempting to take over the drug smuggling routes in the area. Control of the routes in Ciudad Ju√°rez, known as the \\"Ju√°rez plaza,\\" is vital for drug trafficking organizations, since they are a major illicit conduit into the United States. The DEA estimates that about 70% of the cocaine to enter the United States does so through the area. The gang's primary source of income derives from smuggling drugs across the border from Mexico to the United States. They are also responsible for the distribution and sale of narcotics both in and outside prisons. Besides drug trafficking, they have been charged with a medley of different crimes. The gang, which operates in the U.S. and Mexico, has morphed into a prime example of the \\"cross-border nature of Mexico's drug war.\\" Members usually have U.S. citizenship, making them ideal cross-border killers able to move back and forth across the U.S.-Mexico border. By June 2020, the Sinaloa Cartel's Los Salazar cell, and not Barrio Azteca, was the only other organized crime group which was considered on par with La Linea for control of the Ciudad Ju√°rez drug trafficking market. History =Background= The Barrio Azteca gang was formed in the jails of El Paso in 1986 and gained an image of being a tough and loyal gang willing to commit murder of civilians in order to keep fear in the minds of its members and ensure their loyalty/obedience. Some believe that the growth of Barrio Azteca in Mexico is due to the area's distinctive cross-border nature. The area of El Paso and Ciudad Ju√°rez is in many ways one community, with families, friends, businesses ‚Äì and even gangs ‚Äì joined in the same urban sprawl. Some illegal Mexicans arrested in the United States are imprisoned in Texan prisons and consequently join Barrio Azteca. When they are absolved from their sentences, they are sent back across the border into Mexico, where they quickly join the gang's ranks and carry out a number of crimes. The Barrio Azteca has long sold drugs moved by the Ju√°rez Cartel. As Barrio Azteca grew in power, it began to work directly with the Juarez Cartel and their alliance grew stronger. The gang began to directly buy large sums of cocaine from the cartel at cheaper rates, and in return the gang would buy weapons in so called straw purchases from Texan gun shops and then smuggle them across the border. Furthermore, if the cartel needed to intimidate or carry out an assassination in the United States, they would simply call on the Barrio Azteca. When the Sinaloa Cartel made its first incursion into Ciudad Ju√°rez in 2008, Barrio Azteca was called to defend the plaza. They are alleged by the Mexican authorities to have committed numerous brutal assassinations in the city, although the exact numbers are unknown. In addition, Barrio Azteca controls most of the drug sales for the Ju√°rez Cartel in Ciudad Ju√°rez's streets and prisons, although other gangs and independent operators abound. Barrio Azteca is also reported to have kidnapped people in El Paso and drive them south into Ciudad Ju√°rez to kill them. A murder in Texas drives a huge investigation which often leads to an arrest. But in Ciudad Ju√°rez, it is one of the more than ten corpses found dead on a daily basis. The gang also tortures and murders its victims in front of a large and cheering gang audience. According to the testimony of an alleged Barrio Azteca member, gang members torture and kill their victims by digging up holes in the ground, throwing a bunch of mesquite, and then pouring in some gasoline. The gang members then beat up their victims and throw them in the hole. Then they light the whole thing on fire. =Eduardo Ravelo's era= Eduardo Ravelo, the current leader of the Barrio Azteca, began his criminal career in the year 2003, amassing a list of charges for racketeering and numerous conspiracy charges with the intent to distribute narcotics. In the year 2005, an informant and former lieutenant of the gang testified that Ravelo was looking for a man who had stolen goods from the Ju√°rez cartel. The informant said that Ravelo was taken to a house in El Paso where a gang member was being held, his mouth, wrists, and ankles bound with duct tape. Ravelo then ordered the traitor to be sent to the Ju√°rez cartel, and he was never heard from again. In El Paso Ravelo's gang is known as Barrio Azteca, a gang originally morphed from the so-called Mexican Mafia prison gang. During its initial years, the gang's aim was street robbery to collect funds to liberate prisoners in jail. Today, the gang has expanded into a large criminal gang with presence in both the United States and Mexico, besetting by drug trafficking and human smuggling. In Ciudad Ju√°rez, however, the gang is known as Los Aztecas. Under the tutelage of Ravelo, the gang moves narcotics along the border with the aid of Vicente Carrillo Fuentes' cartel. According to reports of U.S. authorities, Ravelo was born in Mexico but has permanent residence in the United States. He allegedly pays his sicarios (hitmen) less than 500 pesos (or about $40 U.S. dollars) a week to carry out assassinations. When drug loads go missing while being smuggled, suspects are kidnapped and taken to Ciudad Ju√°rez. Some are shot dead, while others are tortured and then shot. Some, however, are beheaded. Not all the killings carried about by Ravelo's gang are a result of drug disputes. Some murders are carried out to intimidate and as retaliation attacks. =Ciudad Ju√°rez prison massacres= ;First prison massacre A fierce battle between rival drug trafficking organizations broke loose inside a prison on the outskirts of Ciudad Ju√°rez on 5 March 2009. The violence resulted in the deaths of 20 inmates. It took the guards, police, and Mexican military more than three hours to put down the unrest inside the prison. From a distance, family members awaited news as black smoke drifted from the prison and helicopters patrolled overhead. At one point, inmates could be seen lighting mattresses and bodies being thrown from second-story windows. The brawl, which was between Barrio Azteca and Los Mexicles, erupted at around 6 a.m. after the conclusion of a series of conjugal visits. Alongside Los Mexicles were the Artistas Asesinos, a rival gang and an enforcer group of the Sinaloa cartel. All 20 of the dead were members of Los Mexicles and Artistas Asesinos, indicating that the prison fight was instigated by members of the Barrio Azteca group. One report issued by Los Angeles Times stated that members of Barrio Azteca stole the keys of a prison guard and were able to free their cohorts and begin a rampage in cells controlled by their rival groups. In a relatively low-security area inside the prison, the gang members began to produce knives and force other guards to liberate 150 fellow members. Once they took the guards hostage, Barrio Azteca members went into high- security blocks where the rival members were in, forced the guards to open them, and went about killing the rival inmates. Some of the victims were stabbed with knives, while others were beaten to death; some were killed with home-made guns. The Mexican authorities were able to militarize the area with more than 200 federal police officers, 50 soldiers, two helicopters, a plane, and an unknown number of state and municipal police forces. The exact reasons for the massacre are unknown, but the feud between Barrio Azteca and Artistas Asesinos runs deep, and they often fight for the control of drugs, guns, and other illicit contrabands inside prisons. This massacre had come after a rare experience of 24 hours without any drug-related assassinations in Ciudad Ju√°rez and after a large military buildup during that weekend. Back in 2005, the Barrio Azteca gang had carried out a murderous attack against members of Los Mexicles inside the same prison, leaving six dead. ;Second prison massacre At around 9:00 p.m. on 26 July 2011, the Barrio Azteca carried out an attack on Los Mexicles, a street gang of the Sinaloa cartel, which left 17 dead and 20 injured inside a prison in Ciudad Ju√°rez. Some of the violence was captured by a surveillance video that shows two gunmen clearing a hallway of guards before unlocking a door and allowing several triggermen to shoot inside a room where the inmates were killed. The violence continued elsewhere throughout the prison until around 2 a.m. the next day. Although there was no audio in the video, the footage shows how two gunmen order the guards to leave. Despite being armed, they seem to follow the orders of the gang members without any resistance. Following their exit, the two men open a different door and allowed four other accomplices into the hallway, some of them who were carrying assault rifles. At that point, the triggermen opened the doors of another room, and that is when the firing began. Officials of the state of Chihuahua said they were unable to locate the five weapons used in the massacre; nonetheless, an AR-15 assault rifle, one of the weapons thought to be used in the massacre, was confiscated. Initial reports had stated that the massacre had started as a clash between prison gangs, but the surveillance video shows \\"cold-blood executions,\\" and that the members of the Barrio Azteca gang carried out the shootout without any provocation from their enemies. According to The Guardian, the video suggests that the guards may have allowed the assassins to kill the inmates, proving that the prison was plagued by \\"weak controls, disorganisation and possible corruption.\\" Their reports state that the inmates had broken the rules of the jail and held large parties, possibly with the guards' permission. Moreover, the prison was highly overcrowded, with over 2,700 inmates in a facility with a capacity of only 850 prisoners. =Villas de Salv√°rcar massacre= Gunmen burst into a party in a small working-class neighborhood known as Villas de Salv√°rcar in Ciudad Ju√°rez, killing 16 teenagers on 31 January 2010. Witnesses said that the cartel members arrived at the crime scene in seven cars with tinted windows, closed down the street and blocked the exits. Then they stormed the party and opened fire at the victims as they were watching a soccer game. Some of the teenagers were shot as they tried to flee and their corpses were found in the neighboring houses. As neighbors hid in their houses, some dialed the emergency services but the Mexican military and the Federal police did not arrive until after the killers had left. When the Mexican authorities arrived, a large crowd gathered at the crime scene as the neighbors and family members of the victims, whose ages ranged from 15 to 20, cried and set down candles. They pleaded for their names not to be released for the fear of the hit men returning and taking revenge. The relatives and witnesses interviewed after the massacre insisted that the teenagers had nothing to do with the drug trade and were \\"good kids.\\" What was troubling for the authorities was that the victims were not gathered inside a bar or at a rehab center, but rather at a private home. They gave no official statement for the motives behind the killing, but the massacre bore all the signs of the drug violence that Ciudad Ju√°rez was living for the past three years. Videos from the crime scene depict a sparsely furnished home with large puddles of blood and taints smeared on the walls; in addition, more than 100 AK-47 bullet casings were found at the crime scene. The Mexican authorities issued a money reward of $1 million pesos for anyone who could provide information that led to the arrest of the killers. One by one, the coffins of the victims were carried out from their homes on 4 February 2010, as their families demanded for justice. The governor of the state of Chihuahua, Jos√© Reyes Baeza Terrazas, showed up at the funeral unexpectedly to pay his respects to the families. Felipe Calder√≥n, Mexico's president, also visited the family members and handed a memorial plaque to the parents of the victims. The mayor of Ciudad Ju√°rez said that the massacre was a random act of violence by Mexico's drug gangs because the victims had no apparent ties with organize crime. But Calder√≥n was widely criticized for his initial comments after the massacre, where he claimed that the investigations had showed that those killed were almost certainly targeted for being involved in organized crime. The parents of the victims hung huge placards outside their houses accusing Calder√≥n of failing to solve the massacre and explicitly saying that \\"until those responsible are found, [he was] the murderer.\\" The federal government of Mexico responded to the massacre by implementing the \\"Todos Somos Ju√°rez\\" program, which aimed to improve education and social development, create jobs, and improve the health benefits in Ciudad Ju√°rez. It has fed up $400 million to repair the city's social fabric. Calder√≥n has met with young people and representatives of the federal program to discuss and analyze the city's achievements. He also unveiled a billboard facing traffic in El Paso, Texas heading into Mexico that reads \\"No More Weapons,\\" and criticized the United States for not renewing a ban on the sales of assault weapons that expired in 2004. Four days after the massacre, a suspect identified as Jos√© Dolores Arroyo Chavarr√≠a was arrested by the Mexican military. He confessed to the authorities that the Ju√°rez Cartel had received reports from within the organization that members of a rival drug trafficking organization were at the party the night the teenagers were killed. The suspect said he acted as a lookout for the 24 gunmen that perpetrated the killing and had orders to \\"kill everyone inside.\\" By mid-2011, four men linked to the massacre were found guilty of the killings and were sentenced to 240 years each by the state of Chihuahua. In 2012 it was later confirmed by the Mexican authorities that the massacre was ordered by Jos√© Antonio Acosta Hern√°ndez (El Diego), a former drug baron of La L√≠nea that is now imprisoned. A gang leader of Barrio Azteca also admitted to have ordered the massacre because he thought rival gang members were there. Despite the arrests, many of the family members were unhappy with the efforts of the Mexican government and said that they were planning to abandon Mexico and seek safe haven in Texas to protect their children. \\"I never even gave the United States much thought,\\" said one of the family members, \\"But Mexico has abandoned us, betrayed us.\\" 2010 was the most violent year in the history of Ciudad Ju√°rez, where more than 3,000 people were killed. Massacres, shootings, beheadings, torture videos on YouTube, and even car bombs were recorded in Ciudad Ju√°rez that year. Numerous media outlets around the world considered Ciudad Ju√°rez as one of the most dangerous ‚Äì if not the most dangerous ‚Äì city on the planet in 2010. =U.S. Consulate assassinations= Initial reports stated that unknown gunmen of a drug trafficking organization shot and killed a pregnant U.S. consulate woman and her husband at broad daylight in Ciudad Ju√°rez on 13 March 2010, leaving a baby wailing in the back seat of the car. Later on that same day, gunmen killed the husband of another consulate worker and wounded his two young children. The shootings took place in different locations, and it was the \\"first deadly attack\\" against U.S. officials and their families from the Mexican criminal organizations. The attack came during a violent weekend across Mexico, were nearly 50 people were killed across the country. The killings angered the White House, who had quietly allowed the families of the U.S. consulate workers to live across the border in Texas even before they were killed. The weapons used in the attack and the style the U.S. officials were killed pointed to drug traffickers as suspects; evidence provided from American intelligence and Mexican authorities then pointed to Barrio Azteca as the perpetrators. A day after the killings, the United States Department of State authorized the temporary departure of the workers in the U.S. consulate throughout northern Mexico, including the cities of Tijuana, Nogales, Matamoros, Nuevo Laredo, Monterrey, and Ciudad Ju√°rez. This was not solely a response for the incident in Ciudad Ju√°rez, but because of the drug-related violence along the border. The leader of Barrio Azteca, Arturo Gallegos Castrell√≥n, better known for his nickname El Farmero, ordered the execution of two American consulate workers and a Mexican with ties to the agency in Ciudad Ju√°rez on 13 March 2010. Gallegos targeted the American officials because he believed they had given visas to members of a rival gang, although some say it was a case of mistaken identity. According to Reuters, the killings was an ongoing effort by Barrio Azteca to take control of the El Paso‚ÄìJu√°rez drug trafficking corridor. After the arrest of a suspect in connection with the killings, the gang member said that Barrio Azteca was pursuing a guard from the El Paso County Jail and not the U.S. officials, but this information has not been confirmed. Reportedly, the gang leaders wanted the guard dead for mistreating members of the gang in jail. The speculation of this hypothesis was bolstered by the fact that the second victim was also in a white SUV, but U.S. authorities do not discard the possibility that the gunmen were searching for someone else in the second attack and coincidentally happened to be a white vehicle too, killing the consulate workers by mistake. Others had other speculations on the attack; it was unclear whether the consulate worker was targeted for being slow with the visas of some cartel members; whether the worker had angered some members inside a Texan prison; whether the attack intended to be a message to the American drug agents; or whether simply case of mistaken identity. Whatever the reasons, the attack sent shock waves and huge concern for the United States' role in Mexico, and how American street gangs are quickly adopting the violent tactics of Mexico's drug trafficking organizations and making alliances with them just across the border. On April 5, 2012, the authorities concluded that the Barrio Azteca murdered the three U.S. consulate members as part of an agreement with Jos√© Antonio Acosta Hern√°ndez (El Diego), a former top lieutenant of the Ju√°rez cartel who was imprisoned after being convicted and receiving a life sentence. On March 9, 2020, Mexican police arrested Luis ‚ÄúEl Tio‚Äù (‚ÄòThe Uncle‚Äô) Gerrado Mendez, a former member of Barrio Azteca who later became the reputed founder of La Empresa (‚ÄòThe Company‚Äô), for his connection to the consulate murders as well.https://cbs4local.com/news/cbs4-special-reports/manhunt-continues- as-10th-anniversary-of-us-consulate-in-juarez-murders- nearshttps://www.occrp.org/en/daily/12381-mexico-arrests-gangster-wanted-for- us-consulate-murders Mendez, who was the El Paso FBI office's most wanted fugitive and the last person sought for the attacks, also made La Empresa a hybrid of Barrio Azteca. With his arrest, all 35 suspects named by the U.S. Justice Department in 2011 for involvement in the consulate killings had been captured. =Horizontes del Sur massacre= During a boy's birthday party at the Horizontes del Sur neighborhood in Ciudad Ju√°rez, Chihuahua, several gunmen broke into a house and killed 14 people and wounded more than a twenty on 23 October 2010. After firing more than 70 bullets, the attackers fled the scene in three different cars at around 11:00 p.m. According to the witnesses' descriptions, the attackers were teenagers who had secured the area by blocking traffic. The Mexican police declined to comment if the killing was drug-related, but Felipe Calder√≥n's response was remarkably different from the Villas de Salv√°rcar massacre, where he claimed that the massacre was most likely due to internal adjustments between the cartels. The killing in Horizontes del Sur bore striking similarities with the massacre in the Villas de Salv√°rcar neighborhood earlier that same year, which took place just a mile away and where 15 were gunned down at a party too. This attack came just a week before several gunmen stormed two houses, killing 7 at a party and 2 at a nearby house. The Mexican authorities concluded that there were two possible explanations for the massacre: Either La L√≠nea and Barrio Azteca were responsible for the killings; or \\"independent gunmen\\" paid to kill a person nicknamed El Rat√≥n, an alleged member of Artistas Asesinos. =Decline= In June 2020, it was reported that La L√≠nea was the Ju√°rez Cartel's most powerful fraction in Ciudad Ju√°rez.https://www.insightcrime.org/news/analysis/jalisco- cartel-dominate-mexico/ Los Salazar, a powerful cell of the Sinaloa Cartel, had by this point also managed to build a significant presence in Ciudad Ju√°rez and was seen as on par with La L√≠nea in the Ciudad Ju√°rez drug trafficking market as well. Modus operandi The gang has a militaristic structure, and includes captains, lieutenants, sergeants, and foot soldiers used with the sole purpose of maintaining territorial control and enriching its members and associates through drug trafficking, homicide, money laundering, extortion, and intimidation. In and outside of prison, from gang beatings to drive-by shootings, Barrio Azteca disciplines its own members and rivals. The \\"life-blood\\" of the gang is the drug sale, which they buy at a low cost due to their alliance with the Ju√°rez cartel and profits from its own importation to the U.S. They also tax (\\"quota\\") independent drug dealers in El Paso, in other parts of West Texas, and in the Eastern part of New Mexico. Once the money is collected, the Barrio Azteca members deposit it into the bank accounts of imprisoned leaders of their own organization, often using fake names and female associates by wire transfer. The gang also utilized a sophisticated communication network where they utilize coded letters, contraband cell phones that are smuggled into prison cells, and distribution of membership roster and hit-lists. To prevent officers from understanding their communication network, Barrio Azteca also created a secret language based on Nahuatl. The locus of power of Barrio Azteca is based inside prisons, prompting worries that the operational capacity of the gang is not hindered when its leaders are imprisoned. Members of Barrio Azteca tend to have both Mexican and U.S. citizenship, and authorities believe they carry out crimes in Ciudad Ju√°rez and then return legally to the United States. In March 2010, the FBI and the police department in El Paso stated that Barrio Azteca was more powerful than Los Zetas in the Ju√°rez plaza. They had a membership of 2,000 strong in Ciudad Ju√°rez alone that year. There are around 500 small gangs working for the Barrio Azteca and looking to earn a position by \\"joining the big shots.\\" Gang members in the organizations refer to each other as \\"carnal,\\" a slang term for brother. Outside of prison, members would contact imprisoned leaders to verify a status of a person using the name of Barrio Azteca to operate and see if they were in good standing with the organization. Those who were not in good standing were executed. Officials on both sides of the border have observed how Barrio Azteca locate their targets, stalk them and finally ambush them in multiple car chases, using coded radio communications, coordinated blocking maneuvers, and with well-trained shooters wearing ski masks and body armor. After fulfilling their mission, the gang members return to safe houses throughout the city or return across the international bridge to El Paso. Ciudad Ju√°rez is filled with safe houses, armories and garages with stolen cars for the cartel members and assassins to use. They work day in and day out, often with a list of people to kill. Barrio Azteca has also authorized the killings of U.S. law enforcement officials for cracking down their criminal operations, offering up to $200,000 U.S. dollars. Drug-sniffing dogs were also under a bounty. None of the threats were materialized, however. Arrests On June 26, 2018, Barrio Azteca Capo Eduardo \\"Tablas\\" Ravelo was arrested. Ravelo, who was also on the FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list, is believed to have been in charge of the gang's operations in Ju√°rez.https://www.elpasotimes.com/story/news/crime/2018/06/26/fbi-10-most- wanted-texas-fugitive-barrio-azteca-gang-leader-eduardo-ravelo- arrested/736982002/ Several other members of the Barrio Azteca were arrested with Ravelo as well. On November 7, 2018, Rene Gerardo Santana Garza, known as \\"El 300,\\" was arrested in Chihuahua City.https://www.elpasotimes.com/story/news/crime/2018/11/09/mexico-federal- police-arrest-barrio-azteca-gang-leader-el-300-juarez-chihuahua/1932483002/ Santana is accused of being a major force in the recent bloodshed which occurred in Ju√°rez.

Although later converted to diesel power, Concordia was the last inland commercial steamboat ever built on either Puget Sound or the Columbia river.  Career Concordia was built in 1930 at Tacoma, Washington.Newell, Ships of the Inland Sea. Concordia, popularly called the Conkie, was the last steamboat built on either Puget Sound or the Columbia, and was one of only four steamboats constructed on Puget Sound after 1920. (None were built on the Columbia River). The others built on Puget Sound were Virginia V, Sightseer (ex-Vashona), and Arcadia.Newell, ed., McCurdy Marine History, at page 304 and 509.Kline, Mary S., Steamboat Virginia V, at 34. Concordia was built by the Vashon Navigation Company to replace the larger Vashona. The volume of business on the company's major route, from Tacoma to Quartermaster Harbor, had fallen off, and would not support the larger vessel. Originally Concordia was to be , but John Manson, the company president, discovered that if the vessel were less than 65, the maritime regulations would permit the vessel to be operated with one less crewman. Four feet of hull were then omitted from the final design on the stern end, which gave the completed vessel a truncated or lopped-off appearance.Findlay and Paterson, Mosquito Fleet of South Puget Sound, at page 94. Vashona was then sold to the Anderson Steamboat Company.Newell, McCurdy Marine History, at 411. Operations Concordia was placed on the Tacoma-Quartermaster Harbor route. One of Concordia's commanders on the Tacoma-Quartermaster Harbor run was the well-known and popular Thomas W. \\"Billy\\" Phillips (1877-1949).Carey, The Sound of Steamers, at page 87. On August 2, 1936, the Tacoma Times newspaper chartered Concordia for the annual picnic of its 300 young newspaper carriers at Redondo Beach, Washington. This was part of a regular practice of the Tacoma Times of sponsoring events for their carriers.Tacoma Public Library digital collections, Image series Series: T112-1 notes, citing Tacoma Times, 8/3/1936 p.14. (accessed 06-05-11). In 1937 the vessel was refitted with a 90-horsepower diesel engine. In 1942, Concordia passed into the hands of Joe Boies and Irving Frank, doing business as Harbor Island Ferries. They then placed Concordia in service transporting shipyard workers across Elliott Bay from downtown Seattle. In 1958 Concordia was operated by Horluck Transportation Company as part of their commuter and tourist fleet operating out of Bremerton and Port Orchard, Washington.Newell and Williamson, Pacific Steamboats, at 192. Deposition In 1976, Concordia was laid up in Lake Union. Currently Concordia is moored on Lake Union at the foot of Stone Way Ave N.

He is the Professor of Surgery and Biomedical Engineering and the Owen and Sarah Davidson Wangensteen Chair in Experimental Surgery Emeritus at the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota. Early life and education Buchwald was born in Vienna, Austria, in 1932 to Andor and Renee Buchwald. In 1938, his family fled Austria to survive the Nazis. Henry and his mother came to New York City where Renee supported them. In 1939, Henry's father, who was forced to hide and evade capture by the Nazis in his birthplace of Hungary while he waited for a place on the U.S.'s Hungarian Jewish quota, arrived in New York. Henry attended the Bronx High School of Science, and then Columbia College in New York City, graduating as class valedictorian with Summa Cum Laude honor in 1954. He pursued further studies by attending Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons from which he graduated in 1957 with an M.D. degree. He took his internship at the Columbia Presbyterian Hospital in 1957‚Äì58, and served in the U.S. Air Force as chief flight surgeon at Strategic Air Command (SAC) Headquarters in Bellevue, Nebraska, until the fall of 1960. After the service, Buchwald resumed his studying, earning an M.S. degree in biochemistry and Ph.D. in surgery. Career During his more than 50 years at the University of Minnesota, Buchwald has been a surgeon, teacher, mentor, researcher, and inventor. He is Professor of Surgery and Biomedical Engineering, Director of Graduate Surgical Training, Director of Resident Training, and Director of In-Training Examination. He was the first Owen H. and Sarah Davidson Wangensteen Chair in Experimental Surgery from 2001-2004 and holds the post as Emeritus. In 2002, the Minnesota Medical Alumni Society of the University of Minnesota presented him with the Harold S. Diehl Lifetime Achievement Award for Outstanding Professional Contributions.University of Minnesota Medical Foundation: \\"Harold S. Diehl Lifetime Achievement Award.\\" Retrieved September 22, 2019. His long- term research interests include cholesterol and atherosclerosis, obesity surgery, implantable devices, hyperlipidemias, and measurement of blood oxygen transport. Early in his career, he discovered that the part of the small intestine called the ileum is the primary site for the absorption or cholesterol and bile acids (the primary end-products of cholesterol metabolism), and, that performing surgery‚ÄîBuchwald's partial ileal bypass surgery‚Äîa procedure that bypasses part of the ileum, lowers cholesterol levels and dramatically improves the lives of those with familial hypercholesterolemia.Buchwald H, Stoller D, Campos C, Matts J, and Varco RL Partial Ileal Bypass for Hypercholesterolemia, 20- to 26-year Follow-up of the First 57 Consecutive Cases. Annals of Surgery (1990). 212(3): 318‚Äì331. . Buchwald trained with Richard Varco who performed the first obesity surgery in 1953. Since 1966, Buchwald has performed more than 4,000 obesity surgeries (also known as bariatric surgeries) and become one of the most influential and innovative surgeons in the field. As fellow bariatric surgeon Walter Pories said in a 2006 interview with Minnesota Monthly's Tim Gihring, \\"If you named maybe 10 international leaders [in bariatric surgery] . . . Henry would fall on any list that people in the field would make.\\" Throughout his career as a general surgeon, Buchwald has performed many thousands of surgeries, including all open gastrointestinal surgeries, partial ileal bypasses, jejunoileal bypasses, gastric bypasses, Fobi Pouch, vertical banded gastroplasty, roux- en-y bypasses, and duodenal switches. His writing and influence also go into the realm of biomedical ethics and insurance reform. He has been president of the Central Surgical Association (1997‚Äì1998), the American Society of Bariatric Surgery (1998-1999), and the International Federation of Surgery for Obesity (2003-2004). He serves on editorial advisory board of the Bariatric Times, the editorial board of the Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases, and is a co-editor of the journal, Obesity Surgery. He is a Fellow of the American Surgical Association, American College of Surgeons, Central Surgical Association, Epidemiology Council of the American Heart Association, and International College of Surgeons. Declining opportunities to enter private practice, Buchwald has continued to devote tremendous energy towards mentoring younger surgeons. In 2002, the 53rd Volume of the Surgical Forum was dedicated to Buchwald. In the dedication to that issue, Marshall Z. Schwartz lists some of Henry Buchwald's many accomplishments, commenting: \\"The above noted accomplishments and contributions alone warrant this dedication. But it has been Dr. Buchwald's strong commitment to mentoring many young individuals (which he proudly lists in his curriculum vitae), including medical students, residents (both surgical and medical), and graduate students, that has made him a great academic role model. What makes Dr. Buchwald unique is his lifelong commitment to his trainees.\\"Marshall Z. Schwartz, Dedication, Journal of the American College of Surgeons, 195, N. 3 (Supplement), September, 2002, p. s2-3. Research Buchwald was still in his residency when he was granted his first research laboratory. At the time he was a Helen Hay Whitney Fellow. He studied histamine release, as well as groundbreaking work in lipids and the absorption of cholesterol. In 1973, The National Institute of Health (NIH) awarded Buchwald their largest investigator-initiated grant given to a principal investigator (one of the largest the University of Minnesota has ever received). The grant initiated the Program on the Surgical Control of the Hyperlipidemias (POSCH) trial.

Buchwald has received seven additional NIH research grants. Buchwald, who has a joint appointment at the University of Minnesota in Biomedical Engineering, holds 17 patents for medical devices. These include the world's first infusion port, peritoneovenous shunts, and specialty vascular catheters. He also invented the first implantable infusion pump, a precursor to implantable infusion pumps in use throughout the world today. He was inducted into the Minnesota Inventors Hall of Fame in 1988 for his extensive contributions to bioengineering devices.\\"Minnesota Inventors Hall of Fame\\" website In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Buchwald's research has included: Type II diabetes and its reduction through bariatric surgery; oxygen transport and the development of a device to measure it; heart disease in women; and new technological approaches to bariatric surgery. One of his latest projects is the development of a new type of bariatric surgery called micro-orifice surgery, surgery performed open (as opposed to laparoscopically) but with very small incisions (to avoid complications of general anesthesia and make patients' recovery faster and easier). His innovative research and development work continues. Publications Buchwald has authored or co-authored more than 300 peer- reviewed manuscripts.

It is written by Rush guitarist Alex Lifeson and bassist/vocalist/keyboardist Geddy Lee, and its lyrics are written by drummer and lyricist Neil Peart. The lyrics depict how one would feel while running in an actual marathon, but the meaning of the song is meant to use a marathon (an extreme challenge) as a metaphor for life, and say that life is full of obstacles and is all about achieving one's personal goals. In a 1986 interview, Peart said \\"(Marathon) is about the triumph of time and a kind of message to myself (because I think life is too short for all the things that I want to do), there's a self-admonition saying that life is long enough. You can do a lot -- just don't burn yourself out too fast trying to do everything at once. Marathon is a song about individual goals and trying to achieve them. And it's also about the old Chinese proverb: 'The journey of a thousand miles begins with one step.\\" The live-version released on \\"A Show of Hands\\" reached #6 on the US Mainstream Rock chart in 1989.  Composition  During the mid-1980s, Rush's style was beginning to lean towards a more synthesizer based style of rock music, as opposed to their earlier, heavier guitar based hard rock and progressive rock. During the mid-1980s, Neil Peart was also beginning to experiment with an electronic drum kit. Power Windows is perhaps Rush's most heavily synthesizer influenced album. All of these elements are evident throughout the album, including on \\"Marathon\\". It contains different sections with both Geddy Lee's synthesizer as the lead instrument, as well as Alex Lifeson's guitar as the lead instrument. During the chorus, Lee's synthesizer is most prominent, while during the verses and solo passages there is a mix between synthesizer and guitar.  Live performances  Marathon was first played on the 1985-1986 Power Windows Tour and was dropped after the 1990 Presto tour. The song was brought back live into the set list of Rush's 2010-2011 Time Machine Tour. When the song was played on this tour, a pyrotechnic effect was used during the second verse after Lee sang the lyrics \\"more than just the bottom line or a lucky shot in the dark.\\" Performances of Marathon are included on the A Show of Hands concert film and A Show of Hands live album as well as the concert DVD, Blu-ray and double CD Time Machine 2011: Live in Cleveland.

It was previously classified in the genus Raja as Raja koreana until discoveries identified this species as a member of a distinct genus. Taxonomy and systematics =Mitochondrial genome= The complete mitochondrial genome was investigated in 2014. The genome is 16,906 base pairs in length, and contains 2 rRNA, 22 tRNA, and 13 protein coding genes. The genome has the same gene order and structure as genomes of the other Rajidae species, which is the family that Hongeo koreana belongs to. =Etymology= *Hongeo comes from the Korean word for 'skate', (). *koreana comes from its geographic range in the Korean waters where it was collected. Description The Korean skate has a relatively short, deep snout that is slightly obtuse. Its mouth is weakly arched and large, with 51 rows of teeth. It has five pairs of gill slits. For fins, the Korean skate has two dorsal fins located near each other close to the tip of the tail, with a small, low caudal fin located near to the second dorsal fin. Its tail is shorter than its body length, with a groove along the ventral midline and a well-developed lateral fold on the tail, extending to the tip of the tail. Its coloration is slightly different for males than females as the males are overall blacker than females, but other than that they look very similar in terms of color. The females‚Äô dorsal surface is brown with scattered dark brown spots and indistinct marks. The ventral surface is black/brown with gray surrounding the pores (the nostrils and gill slits). Similarly, the tail's dorsal surface is brown with 3 brown bands and dark brown spots, while the tail's ventral surface is gray. The Korean skate has several distinct characteristics. One is cartilage that is continuous with the neurocranium. The cartilage is proximally stout, very slender, and distally uncalcified. Another is a distinct row of thorns along the midline of the dorsal surface of the tail. Both males and females display this row of thorns. Most thorns are directed anteriorly. Distribution and habitat The Korean skate is found mostly in the southern coast of the Korean Peninsula, in a relatively small area including the Jeju Strait, Heuksan Islands, and Cheongsando. The species has also been found off the shore of Japan, near Tsushima Island and the Got≈ç Islands, but these reports are rarer. Their depth range is , off the southern coast of the Korean Peninsula, and when they have been found off the coast of Japan. Life cycle The Korean skate is oviparous, meaning that they lay eggs. The females lay the eggs on muddy or sandy substrates. The embryos feed solely on yolk when in the egg. The eggs have horn-like projections on the shell. Consumption Hongeo koreana is a relatively high commercial fishery target species in southern Korea. A Korean fish specialty dish is Hongeo-hoe (), which is a fermented skate dish that is famous for its sharp, pungent aroma and a texture that is hard to swallow due to the fish's cartilage. The dish is usually prepared and eaten raw. Not all Hongeo-hoe is made from Hongeo koreana, but any skate can be used, including the Korean skate.

The historic building, built in 1905, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. The historic courthouse is the fifth building to serve Washington County, with the prior buildings located near the Old Post Office on the Historic Square.\\"Historic Washington County Court House.\\" Building Profile/History. Retrieved 2011-06-05. The building is one of the prominent historic buildings that compose the Fayetteville skyline, in addition to Old Main. A new building was acquired in 1989 to better serve Washington County's county administration needs. The present-day courthouse is located at the intersection of College Avenue and Dickson Street, just north of historic building. Most county offices are located in the new building, with the historic courthouse serving as a repository for county records. History Washington County was established on October 17, 1828 by the Arkansas General Assembly. The county seat was established at Washington, which was later renamed Fayetteville after confusion with Washington, Arkansas in South Arkansas. =Planning= This historic courthouse first became a reality when County Judge Millard Berry was elected into office in 1900. He was aware of the need for a new courthouse, and when the Courthouse and Jail Committee of the Levying Court deemed the current 1868 brick courthouse \\"unfitted for the business of the county, unsafe and not worthy of repair\\", the Judge proposed raising money for a new building. In 1902, the City of Fayetteville passed a resolution giving $5,000 to the Courthouse Sinking Fund in exchange for office space within the new building, a 99-year rental of the Fayetteville Public Square, and an agreement to build the courthouse 1¬Ω blocks away from the Square. The courthouse was eventually built along the former Butterfield Overland Mail route near a former stagecoach stop. The route had been instrumental in growing Fayetteville in the mid‚Äì1800s. Judge Berry fell ill with typhoid fever while investigating surrounding Arkansas and Missouri courthouses, and appointed J.H. McIlroy to proceed with the building. In 1904, McIlroy acquired the services of Little Rock architect Charles L. Thompson, who had already worked on many buildings in the Little Rock area. The budget for the courthouse was increased to $100,000, but was contracted for slightly less to George Donaghey of Conway. Courtroom in which circuit court first met in April 1905. =Construction= The cornerstone was laid on October 1, 1904, with over 2,000 people attending the ceremony. A time capsule, containing coins, documents and newspapers was also set. Limestone was brought in from Carroll and Madison Counties, furniture and carpets were purchased from the People's Furniture Store of Fayetteville, a water system was installed by Fayetteville Water Company, and a new septic system was installed by Duggan Brothers. Smoking was prohibited, and spittoons were placed throughout in the interest of preserving the building. A typewriter was used for record keeping. Circuit court first met in the courthouse in April 1905, weeks prior to the official opening on May 4. =Early use= The courthouse had many construction problems in its early years, including the closing of the hydraulic elevator, rotting of basement floorboards, birds in the bell tower, and eventually too many occupants. After relations and space grew tighter, the County Judge ordered the sheriff to evict all City of Fayetteville workers from their offices in 1927. The city appealed to the Circuit Judge, who sided with the County. The Fayetteville-occupied offices were emptied by 1928, but structural problems continued to plague the building. After repairing the roof three times in the 1920s, the courthouse's structural problems began to fall out of official record. The 1934 Quorum Court meetings took place in the Arkansas National Guard Armory immediately to the south between the courthouse and the County Jail, possibly due to courthouse structural problems kept quiet by the Great Depression. The clock steeple was removed in 1965 and returned by helicopter in 1974. The clock face is now illuminated. The Works Progress Administration praised the courthouse during a 1936 audit, mentioning the tidy offices and public access to records. The WPA also warned that record space was dwindling, as the vaults were almost full. This was partially due to heroic actions during the Civil War, when county records were stored in a cave near Black Oak while the second courthouse was burned. As a result, Washington County held more records than most counties in the area. A 1945 proposal to construct a new courthouse was voted down by citizens who pointed out that Washington County still owed money to George Donaghey from the 1904 construction, and felt the current building was not being maximized. County Judge Witt Carter ordered the front steps of the courthouse be moved in 1947 to enable the widening and straightening of College Avenue (U.S. Route 71B). The following year, a grand jury reproached the county for poorly maintaining the structure, including unsanitary bathrooms, fire traps, attic storage, and using the boiler room as storage. The roof was repaired again, and the courthouse again had complaints about too little space. =Later use= Parking became scarce in the 1950s and County Judge Arthur Martin attempted to raise support for a new courthouse and jail. The grand jury returned to cite a non-fireproof vault, poor heating/cooling systems, dangerous electrical systems, inadequate office space, and records in hallways, outdoor porches, or missing. The following year, the clock tower \\"steeple\\" was deemed dangerous and was removed. Washington County purchased the adjacent National Guard Armory in December 1968. The courthouse began incremental improvements under County Judge Vol Lester, who was instrumental to the National Register of Historic Places listing the property in 1972. The county took advantage of federal programs to build a bomb shelter to store county records in the 1970s, which relieved stress on many of the vaults. Despite these improvements, a grand jury report from the 1970s states \\"the building now resembles a rabbit- warren\\" and \\"the Washington County Courthouse in Fayetteville is a disgrace\\". Today, the Washington County Courthouse holds only the county records and a few offices. The 273rd Aviation Company from Fort Sill, Oklahoma returned the clock tower in 1974, using the largest helicopter in the western world. The fourth floor was renovated into a courtroom, but by 1979, the vaults were again too small. Newly elected County Judge Charles Johnson began large renovations, including brand-new plumbing, and removal of ad hoc offices which had been built in the hallways. An even larger renovation began in 1989 with architecture firm Witsell, Evans & Rosco. On December 12, 1989, the county purchased the First South Centre at 280 North College Avenue for $3.3 million. The First South Centre became the Washington County Courthouse in 1994, and the transition was complete in 1995. Staircase within the courthouse. Architecture The courthouse contains three stories and a basement, a grand staircase, and hydraulic elevator. The basement (first floor) housed the offices promised to the City of Fayetteville, including the mayor. The second floor housed court clerks, the county judge, a vault, and three outdoor porches. The third floor housed a large courtroom with a slanted floor, jury rooms, judge chambers, and a porch. The fourth floor contained a balcony over the courtroom and access to the clock/bell tower. The courthouse features round-top arches over its windows, porches, and grand entrance, round towers with conical roofs, and brickwork, each characteristic of Richardsonian Romanesque architecture. Inside, the building contains glazed brick fireplaces in all offices, and ceramic mosaic floor tiles in all foyers and corridors. There is a mural dedicated to those Washington County persons who died in World War I, completed in 1920 by William Steene. The building also contains the Freedom Shrine, housing replicas of many important freedom documents such as the Mayflower Compact and the Declaration of Independence.

It was proposed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers as an alternative to the construction of Glacier View Dam on the western boundary of Glacier National Park, to capture the flow of the Flathead River. The earth embankment dam was planned to be about high, impounding a reservoir of . While it was viewed as a desirable power generation and water storage project by the Corps of Engineers, it was opposed by those it would displace from towns and productive agricultural lands, and was never built. Proposal The dam was proposed in the 1940s as an alternative to the controversial Glacier View Dam, which was strenuously opposed by the National Park Service and conservation organizations as an intrusion into national park lands. It would have inundated of already-irrigated and farmed lands, with the reservoir extending up the Clark Fork and up the Flathead to the base of Kerr Dam. The project required the relocation of roads, rail lines and houses and businesses in several communities. The cost in 1950 was estimated at $265,569,000. Alternative sites at The Plains, five miles downstream from Plains, Montana, and the Weeks site, three miles downstream from the Plains site, were examined but rejected on grounds of poor foundation conditions. Three other sites, Knowles (river mile 4), Perma (river mile 11) and Oxbow (river mile 41) were rejected on similar grounds.Corps of Engineers 1950 Columbia River and Tributaries Report, p. 156 Reception While the project was supported by some local organizations, local opposition was intense, focusing on displacement of productive agriculture and populations and intrusion on Indian rights. Land replacement compensation for the National Bison Range was considered likely. As a result, planning was not pursued and the project remained an alternative to other project farther upstream. In the event, none of the proposed reservoirs in the area were built, apart from Hungry Horse Reservoir. Description The complex arrangement placed a earth embankment across the main channel of the river, diverting the flow to the west, where a straight intake dam structure extending parallel to the riverbed on the riverbank would receive water for the powerplant. A separate curved spillway dam would be located downstream from the intake dam. At the end of the diverted channel an embankment saddle dam would seal the channel. The powerplant was planned to have an initial capacity of 576 MW with eight 72MW units, expandable to 1000 MW with six more generators in the future.Corps of Engineers 1950 Columbia River and Tributaries Report, Paradise Dam schematic plan References Category:United States Army Corps of Engineers proposed dams Category:Buildings and structures in Sanders County, Montana ","title":"Paradise Dam (Montana)"},{"id":"31995074","text":"Paradise Dam may refer to: * Paradise Dam (Queensland), a dam in Australia * Paradise Dam (Montana), an unbuilt dam project in Montana, USA ","title":"Paradise Dam"},{"id":"31995109","text":"Stops of Various Quills is a 1895 book written by William Dean Howells. 55 pages in length, it features 43 poems and illustrations by Howard Pyle.

Born in rural Yorkshire, England, he emigrated to Upper Canada in 1817, settling initially in the Township of Vaughan. Birdsall received a license for land surveying in 1819 and began his career that same year. Birdsall would go on to survey many areas in Newcastle District as well as other parts of what is now Southern Ontario, establishing the boundaries of many townships of the province and laying out the roads and farming lots within them.  Early Life  Birdsall was born sometime in 1799 in Thornton- le-Dale, a small village in the northeast of Yorkshire, England. He was schooled in the nearby village of Londesborough, graduating in 1817. His parents had hoped this education would be followed by a career in the Royal Navy, however with the conclusion of the wars in both Europe and North America, the prospects for a naval career seemed slim. Birdsall instead chose to pursue opportunities in the growing colony of Upper Canada. His education made him a qualified candidate for becoming a surveyor. Upon his arrival in Upper Canada he set to acquire the requisite licensing, which included performing an apprenticeship under Deputy Surveyor Reuben Sherwood.  Career  Birdsall's career began in 1819, when he received a license to be a deputy land surveyor in Upper Canada. Shortly thereafter, he was hired by Zacheus Burnham, a militia captain and land speculator residing in Hamilton Township. Burnham had in 1818 received the contracts by the colonial government to survey several townships in the vicinity of Rice Lake. Burnham, in turn, hired Birdsall to complete these surveys. Birdsall steadily worked through these contracts, surveying Otonabee Township in 1819, Asphodel Township in 1820, Douro Township and Dummer Township in 1823, and the town site for Peterborough in 1825. Birdsall also undertook surveying jobs elsewhere in the colony, unaffiliated with the Burnham contracts. Such jobs included the surveying of part of Innisfil Township in 1820. In addition to his role as a surveyor, Birdsall secured for himself several important civil positions. In 1822 Birdsall was made a captain in the 2nd Regiment, Northumberland militia, and in 1827 he was appointed as a Justice of the Peace for Newcastle District. During this time he married Elizabeth Burnham, the daughter of his surveying employer Zaccheus Burnham, and had four children with her. Birdsall established a farmstead with her in Asphodel Township, where Elizabeth died as a result of an accident in 1827. Birdsall continued surveying despite his new civic duties, albeit with less intensity. In 1830 he completed the survey of Smith Township, which had only been partially done in 1818. He also worked with fellow surveyor William Hawkins on establishing the northern boundary of the Huron Tract. By 1830 Birdsall had also become an agent for the Canada Company, tasked with inspecting settlers on company land throughout the colony for compliance with the developmental terms of settlement. In order to keep their land settlers were required to clear it, establish proper housing on it, and turn it into a viable farm within a period of a few years. These inspections occupied most of Birdsall's attention for the remainder of his life. Birdsall's rank of captain in the local militia put him in charge of the Asphodel contingent when the militia was activated in response to the Upper Canada Rebellion in 1837, though it appears his contingent was not involved in any notable incidents. Immediately following the end of the rebellion Birdsall paid to raise and equip a new militia battalion based in Peterborough. The summer before the rebellion, Birdsall married for a second time, to Charlotte Jane Everett of Belleville, and this union produced four children. = Political Career = As a judicial officer, Birdsall was extensively involved with the litigation that followed the 1838 construction of a dam on the Trent River near Hastings, Ontario. The dam caused the water levels in Rice Lake to rise, damaging many waterfront properties in the area. His exposure to many of the inhabitants of the District in his roles as justice and land agent formed the basis for his transition into politics. Upon the creation of Colborne District in 1841, Birdsall became the representative for Asphodel Township on the District Council for two years. This was followed by an attempt to join the Parliament of the newly created Province of Canada. While Birdsall chose not to run in the election in 1844 to represent Peterborough, he did campaign in the election of 1848. This saw a splitting of the vote with another Conservative candidate, resulting in a victory for the Reform candidate. In 1850, the Districts in Canada were replaced by Counties, and political offices for the municipalities were created. Birdsall became the first Reeve of Asphodel Township, while representing Asphodel on the council of the new Peterborough County. Two years into this role, while on a business trip to Cavan Township, Birdsall fell ill with pneumonia, from which he did not recover. Birdsall died of this illness on 21 January 1852 in Bailieboro. He is buried at St. Michael's Anglican Church in Westwood, a few miles from his homestead.

Apache war-leader and chief Baishan (\\"Knife\\"), son of the famed chief Fuerte aka Soldato Fiero, was a most respected war leader among the Tchihende bands along almost three decades from the beginning of 1830s, and the principal chief the Warm Springs local group of the Tchihende (\\"Chihenne\\") Apaches after Fuerte's death in 1837 near Janos; he was also the second principal chief of the whole Tchihende (or Mimbre√±o) Apaches after his long-time companion (and possibly brother-in-law) Mangas Coloradas, chief of the Coppermine local group of the same Tchihende (or \\"Chihenne\\") Apaches. His name was translated by the Mexicans as Cuchillo (\\"Knife\\") or -- because of the Apache practice of blackening their weapons to make them less conspicuous -- as Cuchillo Negro (\\"Black Knife\\"). About 1835 (or 1837), Fuerte, chief of the Warmspring Mimbre√±o Apache, was killed near Santa Rita del Cobre by Mexican troops belonging to the garrison of Janos, but Juan Jos√© Compa, the old leader of the Coppermine Mimbre√±o Apaches who was friendly to the Mexicans, rejected Cuchillo Negro's request of help to assault and destroy Santa Rita; Cuchillo Negro led a bloody raid to Sonora. After Juan Jos√© Compa too was killed for bounty money in 1837 in the massacre at Santa Rita del Cobre, Cuchillo Negro joined Mangas Coloradas in his revenge, the two chiefs operating a series of retaliatory raids against the Mexicans, killing and destroying all around the mining town and placing Santa Rita under siege, finally attacking the column of fleeing Mexicans and slaughtering a large number. In 1844 Cuchillo Negro was falsely claimed to have been killed by Mexican troops in the Oputo Mountains. In 1847, to revenge the Galeana massacre, Cuchillo Negro called a council with the Tchihende (Mimbre√±o), Tsokanende (Chiricahua) and Ndendahe (Mogollon) chiefs. Late in that autumn Mangas Coloradas, Cuchillo Negro and, probably, the Tsokanende leaders Miguel Narbona, Tapil√† and Yrigollen went to raid Chihuahua with 200 warriors, occupying Ramos, near Janos, and killing most of the inhabitants. In 1848 Mangas Coloradas and Cuchillo Negro with their Mimbre√±os, and Miguel Narbona and Yrigollen with their Chiricahuas, attacked Sonora, and on February 18 they burned Chinapa, killing or capturing many Mexicans. Cuchillo Negro's name is mentioned in military and civilian records of treaties and other dealings with Apaches during the early years of U.S. jurisdiction over the New Mexico Territory. In 1851 the settlement at Santa Rita del Cobre of the U.S. delegation (with General J.R. Bartlett) in the Mexican-American Border Commission and the reopening of the Santa Rita del Cobre copper mines effected a meeting with the Anglo-American newcomers; and Cuchillo Negro, just as Mangas Coloradas, Delgadito, Ponce, Coleto Amarillo and all the most important Tchihende and Ndendahe chiefs, had to face new problems. In June 1851 Mangas Coloradas, with Delgadito, Ponce and Coleto Amarillo, went to Santa Rita del Cobre to meet General Bartlett. The discussions went on until the Apaches no longer felt themselves disappointed and betrayed by the newcomers. Cuchillo Negro, too, had to face some problems in connection with some young Mexican boys who had been adopted into his band. In 1853, along with Ponce, Delgadito and Victorio, he signed a treaty in Fort Webster with Indian agent Edward H. Wingfield, who had been sent by the governor of the New Mexico Territory, William Carr Lane. Death The U. S. Army claims Cuchillo Negro was killed in the Black Range by Pueblo scouts, under Col. William W. Loring, during the Bonneville Expedition in 1857 (May 25, Ca√±on de los Muertos Carneros). However, the Fort Sill Apache, Chiricahua ‚Äì Warm Springs Mimbre√±o Apache website erroneously says he \\"Died in the revenge raid on Ramos (1850).\\" Famed Nana (Kas-tziden, \\"Broken Foot\\") was his natural heir as chief of the Warm Spring Tchihende, but young Victorio's rising star overtook him since the early years 1860. Legacy Several geological features in Sierra County, New Mexico bear his name: Cuchillo Negro Mountains, Cuchillo Negro Creek, and the town of Cuchillo, New Mexico. Robert Hixson Julyan, The place names of New Mexico, University of New Mexico Press, 1996, p.41, 103 A painting of Cuchillo Negro on horseback was done by John Mix Stanley in 1846. The painting hangs in the Smithsonian American Art Museum. It measures 42 1/2 x 52 in. (107.8 x 132.1 cm). Since Apaches traditionally did not wear feathers in this way there is some doubt the artist ever saw his subject. \\"Black Knife\\" appears as a character in a 2011 science fiction film, Cowboys & Aliens.

Dos Santos is best known today for lending his voice to the soundtrack of the classic 1959 film Orfeu Negro. He is also credited with playing a role in the development of the careers of other important Bossa Nova artists, such as Jo√£o Gilberto and Milton Nascimento. Dos Santos' voice was a baritone with bright coloring and a light vibrato, singing in a style called (in Portuguese) \\"crooner da orchestra\\". Career Agostinho dos Santos was born in S√£o Paulo, in the neighborhood called Bela Vista or Bixiga. One of his first jobs in music was singing at a taxi-dancing club called O maravilhoso in S√£o Paulo. Early in his career, Dos Santos sang with the orchestra of Osmar Milani, and on a lunchtime radio program hosted by Manuel de N√≥brega on Radio Nacional. Dos Santos' first recordings were successes. The first, Vendedor de laranjas (Orange Seller) became widely popular in Brazil, while his second major hit, Meu benzinho was a Portuguese version of the song \\"My Little One\\" recorded in English by Frankie Laine. Also during this period Dos Santos successfully recorded a Portuguese version of the Bill Haley hit \\"See You Later Alligator\\", \\"At√© Logo, Jacar√©.\\" During 1959, Dos Santos frequently appeared on a music program featuring Tom Jobim, called O bom Tom, broadcast on TV Paulista in S√£o Paulo. Dos Santos provided his voice to an important film of the Bossa Nova era, Orfeu Negro (Black Orpheus) (1959), dubbing the songs sung by the lead character in the film (Orpheu), played by Breno Mello. Dos Santos was selected to dub the part in preference to Jo√£o Gilberto, who also auditioned for the part, because the producers felt Dos Santos' voice sounded more black (Dos Santos was in fact black, and Gilberto was white). As a result of his work in the film, Dos Santos received offers to appear in music clubs, theaters, and on television worldwide. Dos Santos was a participant in the historic 1962 concert Bossa Nova at Carnegie Hall, in which he enjoyed great success with the audience. A review in The New York Times cited Dos Santos' performance particularly, stating that his voice was the most beautiful voice of the decade. In 1963, he traveled with Jose Scatena, president of the RGE record label, on a visit that inaugurated the release of RGE offerings through the Argentinian record company Fermata. By 1964, Dos Santos was one of the highest paid television performers in Brazil. In 1971 he participated in the first Onda Nueva music festival in Venezuela. During his career, Dos Santos toured through the U.S., Italy, Germany, Portugal, Chile, Uruguay, Argentina, Venezuela, and Mexico. He performed in the U.S. and in Brazil with Johnny Mathis, and, in Italy, with Caterina Valente. Dos Santos appeared on TV in France, Portugal, England, and Belgium. His compositions include \\"For√ßas Ocultas\\" (with Ant√¥nio Bruno), \\"Sozinho Com Voc√™\\" (with Dirce Morais/Heitor Canilo), \\"Chuva Para Molhar O Sol\\" (with Edison Borges), \\"Podem Falar\\" (with Renato Duarte), \\"Dist√¢ncia √© Saudade,\\" and \\"Quem Levou Maria.\\" Influence on Brazilian popular music Bossa Nova historian Walter Silva states that it was Dos Santos who introduced Jo√£o Gilberto to the rhythmic innovations of Johnny Alf (Alfredo Jos√© da Silva), considered to be the father of Bossa Nova. p. 109. Gilberto would go on to build an illustrious career on this stylistic foundation. In their history of Brazilian popular music, Chris McGowan and Ricardo Pessanha credit Dos Santos with submitting the work of Milton Nascimento to the 1967 Second Festival Internacional de Can√ß√£o (FIC) (International Song Festival), resulting in Nascimento's work being accepted to the festival and triggering further growth in Nascimento's career. Dos Santos was also artistic director of the LP album of performances at the festival, which was issued by the Brazilian record company Codil. Personal life Dos Santos had three children.Silva, Vou te contar, 2002, p. 10. Dos Santos played soccer (futebol) for a team from his neighborhood in S√£o Paulo called Boca Junior, and also for on a team composed of fellow musicians. Death Dos Santos was a passenger on Varig Flight 820, traveling from Gale√£o Airport, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to Orly Airport, Paris, France, on July 11, 1973, when a fire on board the airplane caused it to make an emergency landing in a field not far from the airport.

The relative value of the Wilson ratio, compared to the Wilson ratio for the non-interacting Fermi gas, can provide insight into the types of interactions present.  Applications  = Fermi liquid theory = The Wilson ratio can be used to characterize strongly correlated Fermi liquids.Condensed Concepts (Blogspot) Long live Fermi liquid theory Retrieved March 2015 The Fermi liquid theory explains the behaviour of metals at very low temperatures. Two important features of a metal which obey this theory are: # At temperatures much below the Fermi temperature the specific heat is proportional to the temperature # The magnetic susceptibility is independent of temperature Both of these quantities, however, are proportional to the electronic density of states at the Fermi energy. Their ratio is a dimensionless quantity called the Wilson (or the Sommerfeld-Wilson) ratio,Condensed Concepts (Blogspot) Wilson's ratio for strongly correlated electrons Retrieved March 2015 defined as: :R_\\\\mathrm{w}=\\\\frac{4}{3}\\\\pi^2k_B^2T\\\\chi_\\\\mathrm{P}/\\\\mu_0(g\\\\mu_B)^2C_\\\\mathrm{elec} After substituting the values of œáP (Pauli susceptibility) and Celec (electronic contribution to specific heat), obtained using Sommerfeld theory, the value obtained for Rw in the case of a free electron gas is 1. In the case of real Fermi-liquid metals, the ratio can differ significantly from 1. The difference arises due to electron-electron interactions within the system. These tend to change the effective electronic mass, which affects both specific heat and magnetic susceptibility. Whether or not this increase in both is given by the same multiplicative factor is shown by the Wilson ratio. In some cases, electron-electron interactions give rise to an additional increase in susceptibility. The converse is also true, i.e. a deviation of the experimental value of Rw from 1 may indicate strong electronic correlations.Fundamentals of the Physics of Solids - Volume 2 by Jen√∂ S√≥lyom Very high Wilson ratios (above 2) indicate nearness to ferromagnetism.

The first season premiered on June 1, 2011, and ended on July 6, 2011. The series features a team of paranormal investigators led by demonologist John Zaffis, who investigate alleged haunted locations with the hopes of identifying and removing any on-site artifacts or trigger objects that may be the source of the supposed paranormal or poltergeist activity. The production of the second season started in December 2011 and premiered on June 6, 2012. On September 17, 2012, Syfy announced that the series was renewed for 12-episode third season, which premiered on March 6, 2013. On November 8, 2013, Syfy announced that it had cancelled Haunted Collector. Plot Demonologist John Zaffis and his family investigate the sites of alleged paranormal occurrences. The Zaffis family and their team travel around the world to investigate items that Zaffis identifies as having something to do with spirits or energies. Zaffis removes the items from the location and takes them to his haunted relics museum in a barn on his property in Stratford, Connecticut. Broadcast The programme broadcast on Syfy in the United States and Really in the United Kingdom. Summary According to Zaffis, an artifact itself may either be of a paranormal nature such as a religious object once used in occult rituals or a non-paranormal nature such as an antique purchased at an estate sale or garage sale. Once an artifact is deemed to be a possible source of paranormal activity, it is removed from the premises in hopes that the activity in the location being investigated will be mitigated or cease altogether. The artifact is then housed in John Zaffis' paranormal artifact museum.

The convention immediately passed an ordinance of secession and authorized the governor to call for volunteers to join the military forces of Virginia to defend the state against Federal military action. Despite scheduling a popular vote to ultimately determine whether Virginia would secede from the Union, the actions of the Virginia Secession Convention and of the state government, especially Virginia Governor John Letcher, effectively took Virginia out of the Union.Detzer, David.

Meyer. The Wake of the Lorelei Lee is the 8th book in the Bloody Jack series. The series begins with Bloody Jack, Curse of the Blue Tattoo, Under the Jolly Roger, In the Belly of the Bloodhound, Mississippi Jack, My Bonny Light Horseman, Rapture of the Deep, and continues in The Mark of the Golden Dragon, Viva Jacquelina!, Boston Jacky, and Wild Rover No More. Plot introduction Jacky has purchased a ship, the Lorelei Lee, with the Spanish gold she recovered from the Caribbean sea. When she arrives in London she is arrested for piracy. Instead of being executed, Jacky is sentenced to life in the penal colony of Australia. To make matters worse, the Lorelei Lee is taken from Jacky and is used to transport Jacky and 200 female convicts to the penal colony. Plot summary In the previous book, Rapture of the Deep, Jacky is forced by British Naval Intelligence to recover Spanish gold from the bottom of the Caribbean Sea. She used a diving bell to recover the gold, which she still has in her possession. Jacky kept some of this gold and bought a ship, the Lorelei Lee. The Lorelei Lee has four large cabins, 24 regular-sized cabins, and three levels of open hammock spaces. Jacky plans to carry passengers across the Atlantic Ocean. Before the voyage to London, Jacky and her dear friend, Amy, travel to Amy's family farm, Dovecote. While on the farm Jacky sees her friend and Amy's brother Randall. She finds out that Randall has joined the United States Marine Corps and is going to sea. They attend a religious revival at the farm, where Jacky sees her old associates Mr. Fennel and Mr. Bean, who are stage performers. They are putting on the show with a girl that Jacky discovers to be Polly Von, a former member of Jacky's gang in Cheapside. When Jacky sails into London she is taken to Newgate Prison by her old enemies, Bliffil and Flashby. Jacky goes before the court and is sentenced to life at the penal colony in Australia. To make matters worse, the Lorelei Lee is confiscated and used to transport Jacky and 250 other female convicts, to become \\"breeders\\" to populate Australia. Jacky had decked out the Lorelei Lee to carry passengers across the Atlantic Ocean, so it was equipped for the voyage to Australia. The Lorelei has three levels of open hammock spaces and Jacky, knowing which level is best, claims the top level of hammocks for her and her new crew of girls. Four groups form on the ship, the Lizzies, the Judies, and the Tartans, named after their leaders, and Jacky's group, called the Newgaters Crew, which includes Mary Wade and Esther Abrahams. Captain Laughton tells the girls that after they reach Gibraltar the different hammock levels will be auctioned off. The other three crews, being prostitutes, plan on making their money that way. The Newgaters Crew, consisting of twelve girls, including Jacky, plan on doing the ship's laundry in an attempt to make money. Captain Laughton also tells the girls and the crew that they are welcome to mingle and get together. The Captain gets more money if, when they arrive in Australia, any girls are pregnant or have had a child, so they are welcome to it, and they will get a shilling in return. Meanwhile, the book switches to letters from Jaimy to Jacky. The letters do not reach Jacky, but it tells the reader what has happened to Jaimy. Jaimy has been convicted of defrauding the king and sentenced to seven years in the penal colony of Australia. Jaimy has been told by the prison guards that Jacky has not been hanged and has been sent to Australia. The father and brother confirm this and Jaimy is put on the ship to Australia. On the ship, Jaimy finds Ian McConnaughey and Arthur McBride, from Jacky's former ship the Emerald, as well as other members of the former crew. The Lorelei Lee arrives in Gibraltar. They ship is to be there for three days and the other crews go on with their profession to make money to be able to buy the good levels of hammocks. The next day, Jacky goes onto the dock in her swim suit. She invites people to throw coins into the water, which she will retrieve. She works the docks all day, though not making nearly as much as the other crews. Later Jacky sees that the ship is taking on a few more girls and that one of them is Mairead. Mairead has been sentenced to life in Australia as well. Mairead tells her of her arrest and the fact that she is pregnant. As Jacky continues to dive for coins she sees some old shipmates from the Wolverine. She also sees Gully MacFarland, her old partner in Boston, who Jacky put upon a British Navy ship after he got drunk and hit her. He tells her he is now sober and she is the reason, which he is thankful for. After the Lorelei Lee leaves Gibraltar the Captain auctions off the hammock spaces to the four different crews. The three other crews outbid Jacky and her crew for the best hammock spaces. However, this was Jacky's plan all along. Jacky and her crew make the laundry room their home. Jacky, being the former owner of the Lorelei Lee, knows where the extra mattresses are, and with some help from the carpenter, they make bunk beds for the crew. As the ship sails on, the Captain begins to have dinner parties in his cabin, with the officers attending. Jacky is there too, being the entertainment. During these parties Major George Johnston, an officer, has been attending with a girl from Jacky's crew, Esther Abrahams. At one of the dinners they announce their engagement and the next day they are married. After the wedding the Captain pushes Higgins to take a girl for himself. Higgins takes this opportunity to protect himself as well as Jacky by taking her as his wife. The first mate Mr. Ruger has been coming on to Jacky and by marrying Higgins, she can somewhat ward off his advances. Jacky on the other hand, uses their marriage to tease Higgins to no end by asking him to carry her across the threshold of their cabin and calling him \\"Dear Husband John\\" and such. That night, as Jacky and Higgins jump on the bed and make noises to make their marriage look, if not sound, real, she jokingly slides her hands down his waist and asks him if he would want her to, being legally married and all. They both have a laugh over this and fall asleep. The ship then makes it to India. Jacky and Mairead go out to explore India with Higgins and Captain Laughton. Jacky and Mairead get separated from the others. A small boy named Ravi offers to be their tour guide. Ravi is part of the untouchable caste and is an orphan after his mother died. Ravi shows them around, exchanges their money. The girls are sticking out so Ravi uses their money to buy them Indian clothing. He shows them the different Indian gods, including the Goddess Kali and the God Ganesh. After the girls eat some Indian food they are able to ride an elephant. Riding the elephant, Jacky and Mairead go on to be part of a procession through town, where at the end, in the Governor's box, sit Captain Laughton and Higgins. Jacky decides to joke around. While on the elephant, Jacky stands in front of Mairead and puts her arms out, imitating the Goddess Kali. This outrages the Kali followers, and they chase Jacky and Mairead. They run, led by Ravi. He gets them to the ship so they will be safe. Jacky knows if Ravi is left behind the Kali followers will kill him for helping her, so she grabs him and puts Ravi on the ship. The Captain is outraged when the ship is asked to leave the port immediately. The book then switches to a letter from Jaimy to Jacky. The letter is not written down, but rather in his head. Jaimy and the others are on the ship Cerberus. Every day, the convicts are allowed on deck for some exercise and fresh air. Jaimy plans a riot. Ian and Arthur create a diversion by singing a song about some of the guards. The two guards, Corporal Vance and Sergeant Napper, are enraged and begin beating some of the convicts. This diversion allows Jaimy to grab a belaying pin from the deck and tuck it under his clothes. The weeks go by on the Lorelei Lee. One day a fight breaks out between two girls, Violetta Atkins and Jane Wheelden. They were fighting over a man. Jacky tries to break up the fight and ends up in the middle of it. Fighting is forbidden on the ship and is punishable by whipping. However, this time Mr. Ruger decides to punish the girls by rigging up the dunking stool, where the girls will be dunked into the sea for ten seconds. Jacky knows the other two girls would not be able to take the punishment and takes it for them, meaning she would be underwater for 30 seconds. As Jacky is dunked underwater she counts the seconds. She soon realizes that she is being kept longer than she should. Jacky soon passes out and wakes up on the deck. Higgins tells her that something was caught in the winch to reel up the rope. Higgins thinks it was a knitting needle. Mrs. Barnsley, Mrs. MacDonald, and Mrs. Berry are the leaders of the other crews, and don't like Jacky very much. However, they come to Higgins and tell them that even though they haven't gotten along with Jacky, they did not try to harm her. Just then Ravi comes in to inform Jacky of an arriving ship. All the women come on deck to see the ship Cerberus. While the Captains exchange news and try to trade passengers, Jacky spots her old Irish crew on the ship. Jacky continues to spot more of her old crew, including Mairead's husband, Ian. Mairead yells to Ian and the crew yells back. McBride, seeing Jacky yells, \\"Fletcher, it's your Jacky.\\" The two girls are at the edge of the ship, and are being held back from jumping off. The Captain tells them they are inflicting punishment to rioting prisoners, and Jacky and Mairead, seeing that their Jaimy and Ian are being hurt, manage to jump on board the Cerberus to save/comfort their men. The guards force Jacky to watch as Jaimy is beaten, doing the same for Mairead and Ian. But afterwards as Jacky is kissing Jaimy (who is nearing unconsciousness), she slyly puts her shiv in his boot. The Captain throws the girls over and sails off. Back on the Lorelei Lee, the girls continue to travel, all while First Mate Ruger continues to eye Jacky and Mairead. One day, while partying on the deck the Captain, obviously drunk, yells for more everything and just dies, his last word being, \\"More.\\" With Ruger as Captain, everyone stays below as much as possible. He drinks himself into a frenzy and brutally abuses anyone in his way. He continues to pursue Jacky and Mairead. All the gangs decide to form a truce with each other as well as the other ship officers to keep everyone safe from Ruger. Meanwhile, the boys plan to hijack the Cerberus, sail to the nearest port, supply themselves, and sail to Australia to save their girls. Their opportunity arrives when the crew is drunk during the Captain's birthday and their escort ship is off to escort a more important ship. They manage to steal a club and considerable amount of rope and plot to start their take over the next night. When the guards walk by, McBride starts telling a rather nasty joke involving Jacky, himself, and Jaimy. Jaimy, pissed off, tells Arthur the two will settle scores later. The next night, Padric and Ian tease Weisling, their guard, about how he got beat up by Jacky on the Wolverine. They make up a song to an Irish drinking tune about his embarrassment, and soon the Weasel unlocks the door to beat them, but Duggan puts out the Weasel with their stolen belaying pin. They unchain themselves with the Weasel's keys and wait for the other two guards to come out. The other two guards walk by and young Daniel Connolly begs them for protection from his bigger and meaner cell mates. They guards decide to unlock him to have some fun with him themselves (they mean to rape him), when Jaimy and McBride kill both of them. The men steal the guards' uniforms, raid the ship's weaponry, and go out killing and injuring most of the other guards, throwing them overboard in a life raft. They gain full control of the ship and set sail for Batavia (Jakarta). Jaimy and McBride see this as a perfect time to settle their scores and get into a fight. Jaimy wins, claims captain and appoints his officers. Ian as first mate, Padric as second, and McBride as third. Meanwhile, Ruger finally decides that he has waited long enough and orders Jacky to his room. She refuses, telling him that she is married, and if he forces her, it will be rape. Ruger tells her he knows of her sham marriage and this time orders both Jacky and Mairead to his room. Mairead tells him to back away and that she has a baby. Jacky tries to save her by telling Ruger he can have her, and leave Mairead alone, but he does not. Ruger, angered, punches Mairead in her stomach, killing her baby. He goes back into his cabin while the other women help Mairead recover. Jacky, angered, shoots Ruger with an arrow, but misses as he ducks and runs away. To keep the officers from killing Jacky for attempted murder, most of the women barricade themselves below the ship, and only will let officers pass for supplies if they agree to keep to their terms of truce. Under deck, Jacky and Higgins make themselves a makeshift room for the two and discuss matters with Ravi and their monkey Josephine, who they picked up from India. Higgins tells her it is unlikely that Ruger will be convicted of anything, while she might be hanged for attempted murder. Jacky dimly sees that her only hope is if Jaimy helps her, which is unlikely. Just then, a ship has been spotted and Jacky runs up to see if it is Jaimy. The ship turns out to be a pirate's Chinese junk and attacks them by throwing phosphorus rockets at them from a long distance. Deciding that she must fight fire with fire, and that no one should hurt the ship she paid for, she takes a few of her own arrows, as well as some flaming pitch, and drops down in a life boat with Ravi to defend her Lorelei Lee. She manages to set fire to the junk's sails, which burn quickly as they are made of straw-like material. But, as she finishes off their sails, the Chinese shoot their arrows at her and manage to take her and Ravi captive. On board, a woman stops her execution, and her words are translated to Jacky by an Italian monk. The woman, whose name is Cheng Shih, is obviously the boss, asks the monk to record Jacky's entire life. The monk and Jacky talk and eventually she learns that Cheng Shih is the most dreaded pirate in these lands and commanded hundred of ships. The monk mocks her, as she was proud only a minute ago by having command of two ships in her days as a pirate. The monk, Brother Arcangelo Rossetti, tells Jacky that Cheng Shih is intrigued by her and wants to keep her. When meeting Cheng Shih in her cabin, she tells Jacky that she does not believe her story. Jacky, miffed at this, shows her how she can dive for coins. She takes all her clothes off and jumps into the water, quickly getting the coin, but staying down long enough to think her drowned. She swims around the ship, jumps on deck, surprising Cheng Shih. Impressed by Jacky's ability, the pirate takes Jacky under her wing, dressing her in all the latest Chinese fashions, and treating her as a pet. The book goes back to Jaimy who is stuck in the middle of the ocean and cannot go anywhere as the wind will not blow. He is fearful of Chinese pirates that scout out his ship daily. Later in Cheng Shih's cabin, Jacky learns of how she always keeps a Buddha statue near her to remind herself of a debt unpaid. It turns out while raiding the monastery there, Cheng Shih also tried to take their giant golden Buddha statue, but it sank under water. Seeing all the monks dive after it and drowning, she vowed to bring it back up. But no amount of tugging would do the job. She marked the water there and left, failing in her task. Hearing this, Jacky thinks of how her diving bell managed to help her pull up the bow of a sunken Spanish ship, and the next morning proposes to bring the statue back up, if she, Jaimy, and the passengers of the Lorelei Lee (as well as the ship) are all freed. Cheng Shih is angry and whips Jacky for even thinking of asking for freedom, but agrees to let everyone go except Jacky. To show Jacky that she is under the ownership and protection of her, Cheng Shih orders her assistant to tattoo on her neck a golden dragon, this being Shih's mark. They immediately change course and sail toward the Cerberus, their plan to take over the ship and sail to the Lorelei Lee. It is unknown to them that Jaimy has managed to take command of the vessel. They come closer to the unarmed ship, and are about to fire when Jacky sees that management has changed. She climbs aboard, stopping the slaughter, and tells Jaimy to throw down his sword. When he does, she tells him about her plan, and together the two ships sail toward the Lorelei Lee. While together, Jacky and Jaimy spend a lot of time with each other, much to the displeasure of Cheng Shih. One such occasion includes a very saucy time in a bathtub. There, Jaimy realizes that Jacky is a sort of slave to the pirate and is angered. He demands Jacky to sneak off with him, as he is afraid she will be used as a prostitute. Jacky comforts him, and quickly changes the subject and asks Jaimy what his plan is for the prisoners. He tells her that he will pose as the now- dead captain of the ship, collect the money for delivering the prisoners and sail back with her. She tells him that it is a great plan, but does not mention that she cannot leave. Jaimy asks about her marriage to Higgins, and Jacky starts to tell him it is a sham, but Jaimy stops her saying that he could never be jealous of their good friend Higgins. Jacky is sure he thinks she is no longer a maiden and wants to tell him that she is, but says nothing to make sure he would still love her any way she was. When they reach the Lorelei Lee, they board the ship and Ian kills Captain Ruger for killing his unborn son, and laying his hands on Mairead. Everyone has a happy reunion and they all sail towards the sunken Buddha. Higgins and Jacky have a talk about their marriage, and agree to get a divorce. Higgins can see that Jacky is anxious to be back with Jaimy, so the two get divorced in the quick Muslim way, since they are close to Muslim waters. The crew sets up the diving bell, and Jacky, donning her swimsuit, dives for the statue. She brings it up in no time and the Chinese fix it to its original place. But in the process Chi-Chi (Cheng Shih's assistant) falls into the water. Jacky saves him, making him her assistant. As they sail back, Jaimy and Jacky have to say goodbye. Jaimy is outraged and wants to fight the pirates, as he cannot believe that they are keeping his Jacky as a slave. Jacky tells him that she is treated well, like a pet, and he should not worry, as she will have lots of adventures around Asia, and that adventure was why she got on the Dolphin years ago. She tells him to go back to Australia, continue with his plan and to start a life elsewhere without her. Jacky begins to cry, and when Jaimy tries to hug her she tells him not to, as Shih is watching and will kill them both. Jaimy protests saying that he will fight them all for her freedom, but she tells him to leave. She asks Cheng Shih if she can kiss Jaimy one last time, but the pirate says no. Jacky's heart breaks at how she will never be able to feel Jaimy again and sobs into her hands. The monk quickly explains that Cheng Shih meant that she would not allow Jacky to stay, and that she wants Jacky to leave with her fiance as she would hate her Golden Child to feel so sad. Not wanting to wait as Cheng Shih might change her mind, the two run off the ship, quickly climb their ships and set sail to Australia. En route to Australia, Jacky and Jaimy are mostly on separate ships, and she makes no move to invite him over, telling him she is busy. In reality, she just wanted to distance herself from him, as she did not feel ready for sex. She had known that would be on Jaimy's mind, as Mairead and Ian had been \\"busy making another Irish baby\\" and McBride had given him a hard time about her easy ways. At Australia, Jaimy and Higgins act as the captains of the two ships, collect the money, leave the prisoners, and sail a good distance away to talk matters through. Jaimy and Jacky, now finally alone, begin talking. She tells him to sail to Singapore and spend every cent of his money to arm his ship. Jaimy is confused as he thought that this would be the perfect time for him and Jacky to make up for lost time in their relationship, but he goes, with only a few kisses from his fiance. She later has a talk with Higgins, just like the one on the Nancy B., but this time she agrees with Higgins, admitting that getting married and having children could wait until she was older and more successful. Higgins smiles quietly, and it is obvious he knew she would say this. A few days after the ships separate, the Dart (the Cerberus 's companion ship) returns from its different duty to find and sail with it back to England. The Captain climbs aboard the Lorelei and Jacky sees that it is Joseph Jared, one of the men she had a relationship with on the Wolverine, as since then. He tells her that he has finally met her after what seemed like forever. He technically has authority over her, as she is an escaped prisoner, and he wants her in bed. She says no politely and persists, but Jared pulls her onto the bed anyway. Just then the Cerberus pulls up, with Jaimy jumping aboard and Jacky smiles and asks Jared, \\"Now who exactly is the prisoner of whom?\\" The three captains discuss what to do with their illegal profits, the ships, and where to stay, as both Jacky and Jaimy are wanted. Jared insists that it is his duty to turn in Jacky and Jaimy (he is still angry from Jacky's refusal, and the fact that Jaimy is actually present this time to stop him from getting his way with Jacky), but seeing the others' expressions and their armed guards, he quickly agrees that he is open for discussion. Together, they agree to let the Dart sail with them to England, where the Cerberus and it will stay, and where Jaimy will go with his lawyer to plead his innocence in court. Jared, now a captain, will vouch for him with his influence. Jacky, along with the Irish crew and Higgins, would go to Boston, and continue with Faber Shipping, as all chances of her acquittal is lost. The three shake hands and are about to continue with the matter of the money, when Chi-Chi yells, warning them of a typhoon. The book ends with Jacky panicking about the fast approaching storm.

In January 1860, he traveled by snowshoe all the way to Sparta to catch the nearest train to the state capitol in Madison. A famous image of him is a photograph taken during his journey, in which he is wearing his showshoes, along with a pistol tucked into his belt. This 1860 photo was the basis of a mural in Ashland. As a member of the Wisconsin Legislature, he was successful in petitioning the division of La Pointe County, and the creation of Ashland County (in which the city of Ashland is the county seat).

His \\"Window to Paris\\" (1993) remains one of the most popular movies in Russia. His Buddhist-themed film \\"Don't Think About White Monkeys\\" (2008) is popular among the Russian noncomformist youth, including punks and rockers. Mikhail Bortnikov's review of the film \\"Don't Think About White Monkeys\\" Yuri Mamin is the only person in Russia to have won the Chaplin's Golden Cane award. The award was presented by Charlie Chaplin's widow, Oona Chaplin, at the festival marking 100 years since the birth of the great comedian. The festival was held in the Swiss city of Vevey, where Chaplin was buried. Mamin's works are known for a strong emphasis on social justice and criticism of hypoctitical social norms. Because of this, he found difficult to find support for his productions in the totalitarian USSR, as well as in today's Russia, where film makers became dependent on corporate oligarchy. His characters often portray an inspired citizen in the fight for social justice against corporate capitalism. Yuri Mamin's 2010 political interview for Radio Liberty Yuri Mamin began his directing career under the communist regime. He was never a communist and was always opposed to the oppressive power of the Communist Party. Because of this, he could not create his films until the beginning of Perestroika in 1985 and Mikhail Gorbachev's arrival to power. His works are popular among alternative socialist groups who criticize both capitalism and the Soviet system. The Gorbachev period ended in 1991 and Yuri Mamin again became a persona non grata for the criminal tycoons who almost immediately took over all the leading positions in Russian cinema and mass media. Yuri Mamin's 2009 interview in Nevskoye Vremya (The Neva Time) From the early 1990s, a group of official Russian film critics, controlled by the regime, began a period of notorious denigration of the film director and his art. Against this background, Mamin's films won the love of audiences throughout the nation. Almost all of his films received numerous grand prizes and other awards. Yuri Mamin's 2005 interview for Novaya Gazeta (\\"The New Newspaper\\") The official state-supported Russian Encyclopedia of National Cinema, edited by L. Arkus, contains offensive critical reviews of Mamin's films, while acknowledging his talent and important place in the history of Russian cinematography. Offensive criticism of Yuri Mamin in the state- supported Russian Encyclopedia of National Cinema Personal life =Childhood and youth= Yuri Mamin was born in 1946. His grandfather, Dmitry Dmitrievich Mamin, was the People‚Äôs Commissar of the Petrograd river routes and a descendant of Northern Tatars. He was repressed and shot during Stalin's Great Purge in 1937. According to Yuri Mamin's maternal grandmother, his grandfather considered the writer Dmitry Mamin-Sibiryak a relative. Galina Dmitrievna Mamina, the film director‚Äôs mother, was an art historian and theater worker who taught theater history at the Leningrad Higher Trade-Union School of Culture. Several of her students became directors of concert halls and heads of Departments of Culture. Yuri Mamin inherited his Tatar surname from his mother. His stepfather, Nikolai Nikolaevich Chizhov, was a famous player for the Football Club Zenit in the beginning of the 1950s. Many years later, Mamin would name the main character of his film \\"Window to Paris\\" after his father. =Student life= Immediately after graduating from high school, Yuri applied for the theater directing course at the Leningrad Institute of Theater, Music and Cinematography. At that time, young people aged 25 years and older were accepted into the directing program, but not of younger age. It was considered, and rightly so, that directors could only be people with life experience, practice working with people, and a cultural knowledge base. But professor Leonid Fyodorovich Makaryev, a People‚Äôs Artist of the USSR, liked the 18-year-old boy who, at a colloquium, boldly answered questions about theater, film and literature, Peter Brook and existentialism - a result of his mother‚Äôs teaching. An exception was made, and Mamin was accepted into an experimental acting-directing course, where budding directors studied alongside budding actors. They worked on all acting skills, including voice, dance, fencing, etc. Additionally, from the first year on they studied how to put on sketches, fragments and entire plays with their classmates. During his collaborative study at the institute, Mamin gained confidence in both acting and directing skills, participating in student revues and in plays on the stage of the old Young Spectator's Theatre (TUZ). For his graduation play, Yuri Mamin was sent to the regional city of Velikiye Luki, where he was commissioned by the leaders of the local drama theater to direct Denis Fonvizin‚Äôs comedy \\"The Minor\\" for a high school program. Having decided to follow in the footsteps of his idol, Vsevolod Meyerhold, Mamin directed \\"The Minor\\" in such an uninhibited manner and with so much eccentricity, that the teachers forbade their students from seeing the play, which caused a frenzy in the city. The play was a resounding success and Mamin's name became famous well beyond the confines of the theater and the city. The Regional Committee discussed a possible position for him as director of the theater. Perhaps it could have happened, and that prestigious position would have tied the young director to the stage career for a long time, if not forever. However, at that time Mamin received his draft notice from the army. He was sent to serve in the Armed Forces and never returned to Velikiye Luki again. Biographic note on Yuri Mamin in the Russian Cinema and Theater portal Writer and social critic Larisa Volodimerova's talks with Yuri Mamin Stage director career After having served his military conscription term, Mamin was demobilized. He returned to Leningrad, where no one but his family was waiting for him. The circumstances were not easy; all the director positions in city theaters were filled. The only opportunity was Lenconcert, where the director's position had just become available. Since Mamin had already worked with this organization before his military service and had delivered to them a variety show that received an award at the All-Russian Competition, Yuri was hired. During his theater career, he adapted modern and classical works of literature for the stage and led the student theater \\"Podorozhnik\\" along with the poet and dramatist Vyacheslav Leikin, who would later become the screenwriter for some of Mamin‚Äôs films. =The Kremlin Chimes= In 1994, when Mamin already became a famous film director, he staged a new theatrical play, \\"Kremlin Chimes, or Come to Us After... Many Years\\", at the Theater on Liteiny in Saint Petersburg. Mamin wrote this play together with Arkadi Tigai. In the play there are two Lenins, played by Viktor Sukhorukov and Aleksandr Zhdanov. Perhaps, in this play Yuri Mamin wished to return to his youth; \\"Kremlin Chimes\\" was abundant with jokes and gags. Dmitry Bykov came twice to Moscow to see this play that he considered one of the best examples of modern satire, as he remarked in his radio program on City FM. Film career In 1976, Yuri Mamin made a life-changing decision. After leaving Lenconcert, he entered Lenfilm as a director‚Äôs assistant on a film crew for Sergey Mikaelyan‚Äôs movie \\"Victory Day\\" (\\"Widows\\"). The second director of the film was Viktor Aristov, Mamin‚Äôs friend from the theater institute, who had already worked in film for 10 years. Mamin says that Aristov became for him like \\"Virgil for Dante who guided him through the unknown world of cinematography\\". After working as an assistant on a few movies, Mamin entered the two-year higher course for directors and screenwriters in Moscow. In that year, three workshops were organized: one by Eldar Ryazanov, who focused his workshop on screenwriting, one by Georgi Daneliya and one by Nikita Mikhalkov. In total, twelve students were enrolled in the group, including Ivan Dykhovichny, Vladimir Khotinenko, and Isaak Fridberg. At this time period, from 1979 till 1982, which became an important milestone in Soviet cinematography, the courses offered a uniquely eclectic curriculum that included philosophy lectures by Merab Mamardashvili and history classes by Natan Eidelman. Among other lecturers were the art critic P. Volkova and film directors Alexander Mitta, Leonid Trauberg and Andrey Tarkovsky who left the USSR after a long period of participation as a teacher. =I Wish You= Mamin's final coursework, which received the highest grade, was the film \\"–ñ–µ–ª–∞—é –í–∞–º. –ü—Ä–æ–≤–∏–Ω—Ü–∏–∞–ª—å–Ω–∞—è —Å–∫–∞–∑–∫–∞\\" (\\"I Wish You! A Provincial Tale\\"), based on a screenplay written by V. Leikin.http://www.yurimamin.com/RU/8/ Before starting an independent director career, Mamin also co-directed Viktor Aristov film \\"Gunpowder\\", timed to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the World War II Victory.:ru:–ü–æ—Ä–æ—Ö (—Ñ–∏–ª—å–º, 1985) =Neptune's Holiday= In 1985, a meeting with the talented screenwriter Vladimir Vardunas, a playwright whom Mamin compares to Gogolian, had determined the fate of both cinematographers. The first collaborative satirical film of Mamin and Vardunas \\"Neptune‚Äôs Holiday\\" (1986) became immediate popular. Attendees at the Fifth Congress of Soviet Filmmakers and at writer and journalist conventions responded vigorously to Mamin's work, calling it \\"the first film of Perestroika\\". \\"Neptune‚Äôs Holiday\\" was honored with a number of professional film prizes, including the Golden Ducat award in Mannheim (1986) and the Charlie Chaplin Great Award in Gabrovo (1987). =Fountain= Mamin's philosophical film \\"Fountain\\" (1988) written by Vladimir Vardunas was unanimously chosen for first prize at the first International Film Festival \\"Golden Duke\\" in Odessa. The judging panel, led by Eldar Ryazanov, consisted of the satirist Mikhail Zhvanetsky, journalist Vitaly Korotich, composer Nikita Bogoslovsky and artist Ilya Glazunov. In 1989, Mamin won the Chaplin's Golden Cane Award for his film \\"Fountain\\" in Vevey, Switzerland, the second Chaplin award in Gabrovo, Bulgaria, as well as numerous other awards at different international film festivals. The actors of the film - Viktor Mikhailov, Sergey Dreiden (Dontsov), Ivan Krivoruchko, Lyudmila Samokhvalova, Zhanna Kerimtaeva and Nina Usatova - won the prize for the best ensemble cast at the festival \\"Sozvezdie\\" (\\"Constellation\\"). =Bakenbardy= In 1990, Mamin released the film \\"Bakenbardy\\" (\\"SIDEBURNS\\"), written by V. Leikin, a brutal Brechtian farce about a fanatical \\"national- Pushkinist\\" scholar and his clique, who were obsessed with nationalist ideas and the poetry of Alexander Pushkin. This film was made in a time of rampant nationalism in Russia. \\"Bakenbardy\\" has not yet been released in Russian theaters for ideological reasons. However, it received the prestigious FIPRESCI Award at the film festival in San Sebastian, Spain. =Window to Paris= \\"Window to Paris\\" (1993) is the most famous of Mamin‚Äôs works, which remains highly popular in Russia. \\"Windows to Paris\\" in the Roskino list of 100 best Russian movies It combines elements of science fiction, romance and sharp social satire. While sharply criticizing demoralized Russian nouveau riche and wannabe businessmen who humiliate the intelligentsia, it is a romantic story about a Russian musician who discovers an interdimensional portal and suddenly ends up in Paris together with his drunk roommates. In turn, a French woman, played by Agn√®s Soral, ends up in decaying slums of Saint Petersburg. =Rains in the Ocean= In 1994, after the death of his friend, film director Viktor Aristov, Yuri Mamin completed Aristov's film \\"Rains in the Ocean\\". In that year the film received two awards at the film festival \\"Kinoshok\\" for innovative directing and best actress. =Television shows= Mamin's return to the stage was not caused by nostalgia, but by the inability to continue working in cinematography. The government had halted funding the creation of films, and private commercial firms did not support cinema. During this period, movies were shot on cheap, low-grade film, which by international standards would be considered trash. Because of this situation, Yuri Mamin moved to television at the end of 1994 and began hosting educational, humorous, musical and original TV programs such as \\"From Forte to Piano\\" and \\"Chameleon\\" for the channel RTR, appreciated by artists and popular among the intelligentsia. =\\"Gorko!\\"= In 1997 Mamin was approached by private investors to film a funny, non-satirical, entertaining comedy about weddings. Together with his closest associates, including Vladimir Vardunas and Arkady Tigai, they came up with a screenplay for a film consisting of ten funny short stories about brides. The film was released in theaters in 1998, and won the award for best comedy film at the festival \\"Window to Europe\\" in Vyborg, Russia. =Grim Tales From Russia= From 2000 to 2003, Yuri Mamin's spirit of social activism was embodied in the independent satirical television series \\"Grim Tales From Russia\\", which was similar to the American series X-Files, but projected into Russian reality. The producer of the series was Ali Telyakov, a young businessman who had previously worked with Yuri Mamin on other TV programs. The series \\"Grim Tales From Russia,\\" which totaled eighteen episodes, was shown on the federal channel STS. The series was so radically different from the other projects on the channel that the management could not decide when the series should be shown. Finally, a \\"wise\\" solution was found: the series was aired at night when the majority of viewers were sleeping. However, the population in the Russian regions to the east of Moscow greatly appreciated the originality of \\"Grim Tales From Russia\\". The director tols that multitudes of his fans kept troubling thim during the following years asking for the full series. Finally, the Saint Petersburg company \\"Bomba- Piter\\" released the series on DVD in 2009, which immediately led to their appearance on file sharing websites. =Don't Think About White Monkeys= In 2005, Yuri Mamin‚Äôs wife, actress and producer Lyudmila Samokhvalova, and their daughter, Katerina Ksenyeva, convinced the distinguished film director to return to the big screen. They found investors who supported his socially critical film \\"Don‚Äôt Think About White Monkeys,\\" written together with Vladimir Vardunas and rendered into verse by the poet Vyacheslav Leikin. The film has a second name, given in the captions: \\"Chaldean Face.\\" The financial support for the film was obtained slowly, with long breaks in between; the work stopped for months at a time on more than one occasion. For that reason, the director, as an experienced, skilled worker capable of fulfilling tasks within a tight schedule, had been working on this film for over three years. However, if not for the financial support of a few honorable people - successful Russian businessmen - the film would never have been finished. Nevertheless, it was completed in 2009 and was successfully shown at a number of film festivals. The film opened in limited release. Even before its release, the film was fiendishly stolen by criminals who produced infringing DVDs and distributed the film illegally on the Internet, thus causing great financial difficulties for the film's sales in Russia. Nevertheless, after having won two prestigious grand prizes at international film festivals in England and Morocco (Rabat), western distributors became interested in the film. It is slated to be dubbed into English by the famous British sound engineer Ray Gillon. Notably, it will be the first time in the history of cinema that a Russian film in verse will be translated poetically into English verse. The film premiered successfully in the United States (New York and Minneapolis), France, Portugal, Lithuania, Ukraine, Canada and Germany. The mystical ballad \\"Insomnia\\", sung in the film by the actress Katerina Ksenyeva, is very popular with its listeners. Reviews of Katerina Ksenyeva's songs Yuri Mamin‚Äôs film \\"Don‚Äôt Think About White Monkeys\\" won the first prize at the first ever online film festival, ‚ÄúDouble 2‚Äù, organized by the Russian Gazette (\\"Rossiyskaya Gazeta\\"). During the festival, the competing films were watched in 56 countries all around the world, thus proving that a mindful and soulful film can, indeed, be victorious. Valery Kitchin's review of the film \\"Don't Think About White Monkeys\\" Current activities Today, Yuri Mamin conducts a master studio for directors of screen entertainment at the Saint Petersburg Institute for Television, Business and Design. He regularly holds professional classes in Russia and abroad. In addition, he is the creator and host of the educational program \\"House of Culture\\" on the Saint Petersburg channel TV-100, where he speaks on the defense of citizen rights, about the values of world culture, and about the protection of the environment and of animals in grave danger of extinction in Russia. Yuri Mamin is a member of the International Tibet Support Network. He is also a member of the Society for the Protection of Animal Rights and is a staunch opponent of hunting. The TV program \\"House of Culture\\" is run in an interactive fashion whereby Yuri Mamin engages in direct discussions with viewers on matters of public concern. Besides the aforementioned program, Yuri Mamin released the satirical TV journal ‚ÄúShards‚Äù (‚ÄúOskolki‚Äù). Seven episodes of ‚ÄúShards‚Äù appeared on TV-100 in 2010.

At first, he wanted to become a pianist and study at a conservatory, but he broke his arm in a street fight and had to give up his dreams of a professional musical career. However, Mamin served in the military orchestra of a missile unit. Later he told that his experience as a military musician helped him to understand better the Soviet system and the history of his country. His theatrical work \\"One Day in the Life of a Conscript Soldier, A Musician in a Brass Band\\" was presented to Eldar Ryazanov as an entrance exam for Ryazanov's workshop of comedy film. Ryazanov liked the work and subsequently accepted Mamin. 2005 talk with Yuri Mamin in Rolan Magazine In his youth, when Mamin studied at the theater institute, he met the actress Lyudmila Samokhvalovah who remains his wife and lifelong creactive partner. He says that due to her influence he decided to switch from theater to film career. She also advised him to take the higher course for directors and screenwriters. Quotes :* To me, movies are musical works of art, and I create them according to the laws of music, which is, in essence, the most perfect of all things produced by the human mind and heart. (Yuri Mamin, ) :* You used to raise builders of communism, now you are raising builders of capitalism, but the product remains the same: a brute, a know-nothing and a thief\\" (says Nikolai Chizhov, the teacher of music and literature, angrily to the business managers of the lyceum;Window to Paris) :* You were born in a terrible time in a poor, devastated country. But it is your country, after all! Don't you want to make it better? (says the same teacher, Chizhov, to his students on the steps of the Sacr√©-C≈ìur Basilica in Paris; Window to Paris) :* Patriotic films may be understood in different ways. It is possible to make colorful trash with a multi-million dollar budget drawn on government funds acquired through an acquaintance with the prime minister. But it is also possible to make something like all Mamin's films: coming from the soul, touching the heart and forcing you to think, without flattery and hypocrisy, sometimes hurtful, somewhat ugly and unpleasant, but always truthful and honest, scathing and passionate, in the spirit of such great artists as Nikolai Gogol and Mikhail Saltykov-Shchedrin, Alexander Pushkin and Vladimir Korolenko, Leo Tolstoi and Maxim Gorky. For this one needs to have a pure soul and to be a deeply decent person, citizen and humanist. This is how Yuri Mamin will be remembered in the history of cinematography.

Lawyer ;Victor Regalado case In the 1980s, Sciortino represented Salvadorean journalist Victor Regalado, one of the first persons in Canada to be detained on a security certificate. Government ministers Robert Kaplan and Lloyd Axworthy ordered Regalado's arrest and deportation in 1982, charging that his continued presence in Canada was \\"detrimental to the national interest.\\" The evidence against Regalado was kept secret, although the government suggested that he had entered the country \\"to carry out certain activities which are prohibited under Canadian law\\" and was working for the overthrow of \\"a government\\" (which media sources noted was presumably a reference to the right-wing government of El Salvador). Regalado denied being involved in any illegal activity, but indicated that he had been a member of the Communist Party of El Salvador and would face persecution if deported.\\"Supreme Court refuses Salvadoran journalist leave to appeal deportation order,\\" Ottawa Citizen, 30 January 1987, A11.

During the campaign, he was designated as the Quebec NDP's spokesperson for the province's cultural communities.At the time, the term \\"ethnic groups\\" was used instead than \\"cultural communities.\\" The term was then not considered pejorative. See Marian Scott, \\"Viau: Miron dump raises the biggest stink in riding,\\" Montreal Gazette, 28 November 1985, A7. The New Democratic Party did not have a strong presence in Quebec during this period, and Sciortino finished third. In 1987, Sciortino strongly criticized the Canadian government's decision to prevent eighty-five Chilean refugees stranded in Argentina from gaining access to Canada. When interviewed on the matter, he said that the Chileans wanted to come to Canada to escape the \\"terrifying dictatorship\\" of Augusto Pinochet.Jennifer Robinson, \\"Party tells Ottawa: open doors for Chileans, other refugees,\\" Montreal Gazette, 16 March 1987, A5.

This press conference was not endorsed by the NDP leadership, and many believe that it cost the party support among Quebec's anglophones. Sciortino finished a fairly strong third on election day, amid a rise in NDP support among Montreal's francophone voters.Elizabeth Thompson, \\"Tories hold Blais-Grenier's old riding,\\" Montreal Gazette, 22 November 1988, B12; Ingrid Peritz, \\"Language hard-liners hurt NDP in west end,\\" Montreal Gazette, 23 November 1988, A10. ;Parti Qu√©b√©cois Sciortino later left the NDP and affiliated with the Quebec sovereigntist Parti Qu√©b√©cois (PQ), serving on its national executive. The PQ has traditionally had only limited support among Quebec's cultural communities, and Sciortino was one of its most prominent members from the Italian community. In 1992, he wrote a public letter defending PQ against charges that it was based around a narrow ethnic nationalism.Giuseppe Sciortino, \\"PQ invites all to keep an open mind\\" [letter], Montreal Gazette, 20 November 1992, B2. The following year, he called for a \\"new linguistic agreement\\" that would protect the spirit of Quebec's Charter of the French Language while also recognizing the concerns of other linguistic communities.Giuseppe Sciortino, \\"Quebec shouldn't rush to change language law,\\" Montreal Gazette, 27 May 1993, B3. In the buildup to the 1994 provincial election, Sciortino sought the PQ nomination for the east-end Montreal seat of Mercier. His candidacy was widely regarded as an important development for the PQ in building a support base among non-francophone voters. Sciortino initially won the nomination in a close contest over Robert Perreault, but the result was annulled due to voting irregularities.The first round of balloting at the first nomination meeting saw Perreault receive 245 votes, compared with 114 for Sciortino, 89 for retired civil servant Claude Bernard, and 71 for Jean-Louis H√©rivault. Perreault's opponents joined forces, and Sciortino was elected by fourteen votes on the second ballot. The results were annulled when it was discovered that at least fifteen of Bernard's supporters had given improper addresses. See Don Macpherson, \\"Minority candidate; Sciortino's nomination is a step forward for the PQ,\\" Montreal Gazette, 22 June 1994, B3; Lysiane Gagnon, \\"Pauline Julien versus Camille Laurin: a spectacular match,\\" Globe and Mail, 25 June 1994, D3; Ed Bantey, \\"Sciortino's nomination by PQ shows Quebec is growing up,\\" Montreal Gazette, 26 June 1994, A5; Jean-Claude Leclerc, \\"A big sacrifice; PQ gave up top candidate to show its ethnic diversity,\\" Montreal Gazette, 27 June 1994, B3; Philip Authier, \\"PQ will hold new nomination meeting because of \`irregularities' in Mercier,\\" Montreal Gazette, 21 July 1994, A10.

The PQ won a majority government in the 1994 provincial election, and Sciortino initially remained a member of the party's executive. He supported the sovereigntist option in the 1995 Quebec referendum and, after its narrow defeat, acknowledged that the PQ's outreach efforts to minority communities had not been successful.Richard Mackie, \\"Parizeau's ethnic view hurt cause, PQ admits,\\" Globe and Mail, 14 November 1995, A4. See also Giuseppe Sciortino, \\"Bridge building: Sovereignists have work to do in making ethnic Quebecers feel welcome,\\" Montreal Gazette, 30 November 1995, B3. He resigned from the PQ executive in April 1996 and largely withdrew from party activities after this time.Don MacPherson, \\"Sciortino's resignation is a blow to PQ's image,\\" Montreal Gazette, 23 April 1996, B3. On the night of the 1995 referendum, PQ premier Jacques Parizeau delivered a speech that blamed the sovereigntist defeat on \\"money and the ethnic vote.\\" Sciortino later described this as a \\"wretched phrase ... pointless, and objectively false\\" and \\"not what one would expect from a statesman, from a democrat, as many, myself included, consider or considered Jacques Parizeau to be.\\"Giuseppe Sciortino, \\"Growing intolerence: Both sides in unity debate resorting to new lows,\\" Montreal Gazette, 22 September 1997, B3. ;Italian community activism In October 1996, Sciortino joined with other federalist and sovereigntist Italian Quebecers to issue a manifesto that recognized the right of all Quebecers to determine their future, called for reform in the Quebec Italian community's political culture, and encouraged the PQ to fully accept Quebec as a pluralistic society.Ed Bantey, \\"Theres Italian wisdom in Declaration of the Fourteen,\\" Montreal Gazette, 13 October 1996, A4; Robert McKenzie, \\"Parizeau keeps Quebec guessing,\\" Toronto Star, 27 October 1996, A1. Four years later, he led a movement to have the Papineau-Leblanc Bridge between Montreal and Laval named after the late Canadian Senator Pietro Rizzuto. Sciortino indicated that he did not agree politically with Rizzuto, who was a Liberal, but nonetheless believed that his contributions to Quebec should be recognized.Ingrid Peritz, \\"A name change rekindles an old Quebec passion,\\" Montreal Gazette, 12 January 2000, A5.

This happens with the tacit support of political parties including those in government. In Malayalam, 'nokku kooli', translates into 'gawking wages' or 'wages for (just) looking on'. It had gained widespread notoriety all over Kerala, but the practice has been considerably curtailed in recent times. Nokku kooli often enjoys a quasi-statutory status. The wages list finalized by the Head-load Workers Welfare Fund Board in an industrial zone in Kochi shows Rs. 200 per load of ready-mix concrete. This, when the entire process is machine-driven. Similarly, one tipper load (lorry which can mechanically tip the load) fetches Rs. 15 for the union. At least 1,000 tipper lorries are at work in the Vallarpadom container trans-shipment terminal site in Kochi. Yet another example was in Idukki. Recently, the state Power minister A.K. Balan publicly censured head-load workers who took Rs 3,000 each as nokku kooli while cranes installed some 14 turbines, each weighing 80 tonnes, atop 120-ft towers, for a windmill farm.  Modus Operandi  The modus operandi is usually as follows: At almost every industrial zone and residential area in the state, worker's unions posts \\"lookouts\\" whose task is to spot vehicles carrying goods. Once a quarry is spotted the news is quickly conveyed to all available union members, who then descend en masse to the place where the goods are to be offloaded. Heated negotiations then commence. The leaders often demand extortionist rates for doing the work. Their demand for a \\"right to work\\" is often not matched by an obligation to be efficient. So the usual compromise is for pay the union workers a certain amount for just watching - or gawking - while the work is done mechanically or using in-house workers. The employer, of course, loses both ways while making a double payment for the same work - he pays one group of \\"workers\\" for not working and another for actually getting it done. A Malayalam Writer, Paul Zakaria, illustrates Nokku Kooli with the following example: :You are, say, moving house. The worker comrades demand a prodigious sum to load/unload; so you decide to do it yourself with help from friends. The comrades look on from a distance; when you‚Äôre done, they ask to be paid the demanded wages. If you don‚Äôt pay up, there is a bit of violence and you get hurt. The revolution in Kerala says the worker must be paid even if he doesn‚Äôt work. That is a kind of workers‚Äô paradise even Marx did not anticipate. Widely recognized as an unethical labour practice, it is cited as one of the reasons for poor industrial development in Kerala. Following a recent change of government in the state, the new Labour Minister Shibu Baby John has said attempts to end the menace of ‚Äònokku kooli' will commence as part of the department's agenda for the 100-day development program of the State government declared by Chief Minister Oommen Chandy. This move by the government has been substantial success and various cities and districts have been declared Nokku Kooli-free.. On 2018 May 1, an official release from the Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan office said that trade unions had offered full support to the state government's move to end 'nokku kooli' in the state and 'Nokku kooli' to become history.

Charles Bent In 1846 Charles Bent was appointed Governor of the territory of New Mexico during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. An Anglo-American government rule was culture shock to the Native Americans who had lived in the land for many centuries and then coexisted with Hispanic people during Spanish colonization and then possession by Mexico. Protesting American's possession of the territory, an angry mob descended on his home in January, 1847 and killed Governor Bent, survived by his wife and children who escaped through a hole in the adobe wall to the neighboring home. Prior to becoming governor, Bent was a well-respected trader who owned a number of wagon trains on the Santa Fe Trail and trading posts in Santa Fe and Taos. Bent built Bent's Fort in Colorado with his brother William and Ceran St. Vrain. It was a famous trading center for Native Americans and early mountain men. He traded with frontier mountain men, exchanging supplies for furs and buffalo hides. Museum Located just north of the Taos Plaza at 117 Bent Street, the Governor Bent House is a private museum open to the public. Inside the museum are memorabilia and artifacts of the uprising. Within the house is the hole in the wall that allowed family members to escape. The museum also has works of local artists. The building is Spanish Pueblo Revival / Hispanic Vernacular built about 1835 of adobe stucco over adobe bricks and wooden framed building.

Early life Seter was born Marc Starominsky in Novorossiysk, Russia, in 1916 and emigrated with his family to Mandate Palestine in 1926.Encyclopaedia Judaica, Volume 14 (1972) Seter learned to play the piano from the age of seven in Russia, and continued with his lessons and studies in Tel Aviv. In 1932, he went to Paris, France, where he studied composition at the Ecole Normale de Musique with Paul Dukas and Nadia Boulanger. He also had some lessons with Stravinsky. With Boulanger, Seter mastered Renaissance polyphony and contemporary French style, but in 1937, frustrated by the extent of her devotion to Stravinskian neoclassicism, he returned to Palestine.Ronit Seter, \\"Mordecai Seter,\\" in Oxford Music Online, accessed 15 February 2016 There, he pursued a musical language founded on his own unique synthesis of the latter, and other, European influences with more local ones. Style Upon his return to Palestine in 1937, Seter grew interested in developing a style inspired by Middle Eastern Jewish musical traditions. In Paris, he had been fascinated with cantus firmus-based techniques found in Western Medieval and Renaissance music, which derived from Catholic plainchant. Therefore, when, in 1938, he encountered the volumes of Abraham Zevi Idelsohn's Thesaurus of Hebrew Oriental Melodies that contained traditional Sephardic and Mizrahi liturgical tunes, he consciously adopted them as a major influence, not only in and of themselves, but eventually as sources for the intervalic character of his own new modes. That this melos bore the local accent of spoken Hebrew was a further attraction for Seter, especially since he was focused on choral music at the time.Ronit Seter, \\"Nationalism in Jewish-Israeli Art Music, 1940-2000,\\" Ph.D. dissertation, 2004 In some ways, Seter's usage and internalization of traditional material resembled that of Bart√≥k, and like Bart√≥k (though to a lesser extent), he made many transcriptions himself. In most particulars, however, Seter's methods were fully distinct and strikingly original. In the 1940s and 50s, when his output was largely choral, he mainly used the traditional tunes in dramatically-charged polyphonic textures. But the later part of this period was transitory for Seter: his Sonata for two violins (1951) is built from Western church modes, while his Duets for two violins (1951‚Äì54) are based on collections of between four and ten pitches. The stage was set for his magnum opus, the oratorio Midnight Vigil, commissioned by Sarah Levi-Tanai and the Inbal Dance Theatre, which reached its final of five versions in 1961. Here, Mizrahi tunes are prominent, but also fundamental to the work's sound and structure is a twelve-note synthetic scale of alternating minor and augmented seconds. This scale interacts seamlessly with the borrowed melodies and governs the cantata's harmonic language, ensuring its remarkable cohesion through the common features of its musical elements. After Midnight Vigil, Seter consistently used modes and scales of at least twelve notes, which subsumed the borrowed materials but retained their essence. At first, as in the ballet Judith (1962‚Äì63), commissioned by Martha Graham (as was the later Part Real, Part Dream [1964]), his modes took the form of twelve-tone rows and their treatment that of serial technique, though without transposition and with emphasis on certain pitches to create at times a sense of tonal center. Seter felt his methods then and later to be more like theme and variation than serialism. By the 1970s, his style had developed further: the modes now unfold the aggregate diatonically over as many as two octaves (in as many as 25 pitches), leading in such cases to pitch-class repetition and contributing to Seter's cherished sense of pitch centricity. The modes' adjacent intervals are always seconds, whether minor, major, augmented, or doubly-augmented. Seter's works from 1970 on, all for chamber combinations or piano, are intensely introspective, perhaps mirroring the contemporaneous feelings of the man who wrote them. As one scholar writes: [A]round 1970, when he felt that the fame he had gained following the Israel Prize (1965) was more a burden than a joy, he gradually withdrew from social activity, including contacts with performers, to the point that he refused to write on commission, and kept composing upon inspiration only. Nevertheless, \\"his music possessed a spirituality that was sensed by critics and audiences alike.\\" Teaching career Beginning in 1946, Seter taught at the Music Teachers' College. From 1951 until his retirement in 1985, Seter was one of the most influential teachers at the Rubin Academy of Tel Aviv University (previously the Israel Conservatory). His students included composers Tzvi Avni, Arie Shapira, Nurit Hirsh and the conductor Gary Bertini. Reception Seter's Midnight Vigil is regarded as one of the most important Israeli works, and was paired with Beethoven's Ninth Symphony on the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra's Millennium Festival program of 1 January 2000.

The school is affiliated to the Central Board of Secondary Education. School is functioning in the space earmarked by the National Institute of Technology Calicut and is being promoted as a staff welfare measure of the institute and the Department of Electronics and Accreditation of Computer Classes centre in Kozhikode.  Campus The Spring Valley School is a senior secondary, co- educational, English medium school functioning in the National Institute of Technology Calicut campus since 1992. The school is affiliated to the Central Board of Secondary Education, New Delhi. It is managed by National Institute of Technology Calicut Spectra, a charitable society registered under the Societies Act (1860). The members of the society are the faculty members of National Institute of Technology Calicut. The sole objective of the society is to run the school. Spring Valley School  Academics  At the primary level, classes I through IV- children are engaged to acquire knowledge and the teacher functions as a guide and facilitator in the process. They are introduced to social norms and moral values through instructions and indoor/outdoor activities. Attempts are made to identify the talents in them and training is given to develop these. Drawing, painting, dance, music, elocution, storytelling, recitation, writing, dramatics, display drills, sports and games are the skill areas. Science projects, creative writing, clay modeling, craft work etc. form an important part of the activities at this level. These are aimed at developing the creativity in children. The classroom instructions involve mostly interactive works to develop the childrens' communication abilities. This forms the core of the educational process at this level and hence special efforts are made to develop the four language skills of learning, speaking, reading and writing. In the middle school section ‚Äì classes fifth through eighth ‚Äì scope is progressively widened and greater emphasis is given to self learning, logical thinking, analyzing and arriving at correct inferences by the children. In the high school section ‚Äì classes IXth and Xth ‚Äì greater emphasis is given to acquire proficiency in specific subject areas. Development of higher cognitive skills is also emphasized. In the senior secondary section- Plus 2 classes- The children are elevated to further heights by narrowing down to specific fields and thrusting on the foundations for further higher studies to professional and non professional levels.  Achievements  The institution has been able to maintain the track record of academic excellence by securing 100 percent results in the CBSE X examination for the past 8 years. The xchool was awarded the Sahodaya Award of Excellence for the cent percent result in the All India Secondary School Examination, and many students of this school have secured ranks ranging from 1 to 15 throughout the years. Even under the changed Evaluation system the students have exhibited spectacular performance by securing A+ and A grades. Besides academic excellence, the school continues to shine in the CBSE Kalotsav conducted by Malabar Sahodaya Complex, from the district to the state level. The students have also won prizes in various Quiz Competitions at the District/State/National level which was commendable. During the first decade of existence since 1992, the children had brought many laurels to the school and the same stands as the proof of commitment of the school to its objectives. Even though the school is situated away from the city with no hostel facilities for the students, the challenges of keeping the moral high and maintaining high academic standards have been met to the greatest extent possible.

He was educated under his relative, John Banister, the surgeon. He devoted himself especially to certain branches of surgery, such as ‚Äòthe help of hearing by the instrument, the cure of the hare-lip and the wry-neck, and diseases of the eyes.‚Äô He studied under various persons eminent in these subjects, among whom were ‚ÄòHenry Blackborne, Robert Hall of Worcester, Master Velder of Fennie Stanton, Master Surflet of Lynn, and Master Barnabie of Peterborough.‚Äô To complete his education he studies the works of authors such as Rhazes, Mesne, Fernelius, and Vesalius. Banister then established himself in Stamford, and acquired considerable reputation as an oculist. He was in demand in all the nearby large towns, and was even asked to go to London. He appears to have performed numerous operations for cataract, and to have cured twenty-four blind persons at Norwich, of which he obtained a certificate from the mayor and aldermen. In 1622 Banister published a second edition of a Treatise of One Hundred and Thirteen Diseases of the Eyes and Eyelids, with some profitable additions of certain principles and experiments, by Richard Banister, oculist and practitioner in physic. It is a translation from the French of Jacques Guillemeau, made by one A. H., and at its first publication dedicated to the elder Banister. Guillemeau was a distinguished surgeon at the courts of Charles IX, Henry III, and Henry IV of France, and his work, Trait√© des Maladies de l'≈íil (Handbook for treatment of ailments of the eye), was published in Paris in 1585, and at Lyon in 1610, and was translated both into Flemish and into German. The English translation by A. H. having become out of print, a second edition was published in 1622 by Richard Banister, together with an ‚Äòappendant part‚Äô called Cervisia Medicata, Purging Ale, with divers aphorisms and principles. The work received the name of Banister's Breviary of the Eyes in which the curative properties of Malvern water are also mentioned. In this treatise he names the best oculists for the last fifty or sixty years, not university graduates. Banister was buried at St Mary's Church, Stamford, 7 April 1626. His wife Anne was buried there 16 April 1624.

On 31 May 2011 an apparent magnitude 13.5 type II supernova (the explosion of a single massive star) was detected in M51 at coordinates 13:30:05.08 +47:10:11.2. It was discovered by Tom Reiland; Thomas Griga; Am√©d√©e Riou; and Stephane Lamotte Bailey and confirmed by several sources, including the Palomar Transient Factory. A candidate progenitor has been detected in Hubble Space Telescope images at coordinates 13:30:05.119 +47:10:11.55. The progenitor may have been a highly luminous yellow supergiant with an initial mass of 18-24 solar masses. The supernova appears to have peaked near apparent magnitude 12.1 on 19 June 2011. Emission spectra from W. M. Keck Observatory, obtained by Palomar Transient Factory indicate that this is a type II supernova with a relatively blue continuum with P Cygni profiles in the Balmer series. This is a unique event, because it occurs in a galaxy that is imaged almost constantly. It is expected to be observable for northern hemisphere observers for several months. This is the third supernova to be recorded in the Whirlpool galaxy since 1994 (following SN 1994I and SN 2005cs) which is a lot for a single galaxy. The galactic supernova frequency is estimated to be around one event every 40 years. Observing In terms of visual stargazing with a large amateur telescope, this object may not jump out at the viewer. As of June 25, 2011, it was holding reasonably steady at magnitude 12.7. At that time, the supernova was about 300 times fainter than the naked eye magnitude of 6.5.Math: 2.512(12.7 ‚àí 6.5) = 302 The supernova is an easy target for an amateur telescope equipped with a modern CCD camera under a dark sky.

No impact absorbing material or tires line the edge of the Armco barriers and, as such, the barriers are all bent out of shape. At the main straightaway, a 20-foot gap opens in the barrier halfway down with no impact absorbing material. Even on a quiet day, the pit area is packed with kids running around and between cars. When cars are parked on both sides of the narrow pit area, only one car pass. The access tunnel to the pit area is narrow and low, barely wide enough for trucks.

Published by Pantheon Books in 2011, it brought Katchor the National Cartoonists Society's Graphic Novel Award. The book deals with its characters' obsessive tourism. It was Pantheon's first graphic novel to be released in ebook format in addition to the hardcover edition. Overview The story follows Emile Delilah, a compulsive vacationer, who loves other cultures so much that he cannot keep himself at home; and the \\"supranationalist\\" Elijah Salamis, who walks around in his underwear in all weather, rejecting national and cultural boundaries. Publication history The story was originally serialized, as The Jew of New York and his Julius Knipl strips, in various alternative newspapers, and was originally completed in 2000. The collected edition, however, wasn't released until March 15, 2011Katchor's first book in over ten years. In the collected edition, the original strips were left as is, but new material was added \\"to amplify the through-story\\", Katchor said, and the new material can be spotted by careful readers. \\"I wanted the new pages to look like an annotation, a new kind of drawing\\". Katchor says the time was right to return to The Cardboard Valise, as we're living in an age where people are thinking about the disappearance of paper and the culture that went with it. The book was also Pantheon's first (and to date, only) graphic novel to be released as an e-book simultaneously with the hardcover edition. To date (Nov. 2011), the e-book has not been released. The hardcover edition also featured fold-out cardboard handles.  References  External links * Review: Beauty and eccentricity.

The plan was commissioned under EU Renewable Energy Directive 2009/28/EC which required member states of the European Union to notify the European Commission with a road map. The report describes how Germany plans to achieve its legally binding target of an 18% share of energy from renewable sources in gross final consumption of energy by 2020.  Main targets in Germany  In the National Action Plan, the federal government estimates the share of renewable energies in gross final energy consumption to be 19.6% in 2020. The share of renewable energies in the electricity sector will therefore amount to 38.6%, the share in the heating/cooling sector will be 15.5%, while in the transport sector it will be 13.2%.  Main incentives and laws in Germany  Under the Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG), sector-specific tariffs are set for electricity from renewable energies fed into the public supply grid. The amount of compensation follows the principle of cost-covering compensation and is based on the specific electricity production costs of the specific sectors. KfW's funding program Renewable Energy (Erneuerbare Energien) section Standard provides low- interest loans for investments in installations for electricity production in accordance with the EEG, cogeneration plants and for small heat production installations. In program section Premium low interest loans with repayment subsidies are granted for renewable energy heat produced in large installations. KfW funding programs for energy-efficient construction and renovation ( building renovation program), which promote the development of renewable energies, are Energy efficient Construction (Energieeffizient Baue), Energy Efficient Renovation (Energieeffizient Sanieren) or Energy-efficient Renovation ‚Äì Local Authorities (Energieeffizient Sanieren ‚Äì Kommunen) and Social Investment - Building Refurbishment (Sozial Investieren- Energetische Geb√§udesanierung). The Heat-and-power Cogeneration Act (KWKG) regulates the funding of old and new combined heat and power (CHP) plants and the development and construction of heating networks into which heat from CHP- plants is fed. Guidelines on the promotion of mini-CHP plants promote through investment grants the new construction of CHP - plants up to 50kWel. The Energy Tax Act (EnergieStG) provides tax relief for energy products used for combined heat and power production if the CHP plant has a monthly or annual efficiency of at least 70%. There is also a tax exemption for biogas which is combusted immediately after production or is used in a CHP plant.

Koya is the technical term for the space between the roof and the ceiling. is a type of roof widely used in Japan both at Buddhist temples and Shinto shrines. It is composed of a true roof above and a second roof beneath, permitting an outer roof of steep pitch to have eaves of shallow pitch, jutting widely from the walls but without overhanging them. The second roof is visible only from under the eaves and is therefore called a \\"hidden roof\\" (giving its name to the whole structure) while the first roof is externally visible and is called an \\"exposed roof\\" in English and in Japanese. Invented in Japan during the 10th century, its earliest extant example is H≈çry≈´-ji's Daik≈ç-d≈ç, rebuilt after a fire in 990. History and structure Section of a temple's roof showing the inner structure of a hidden roofJapanese Buddhist architecture and most Shinto architecture are not indigenous, but were imported from China and Korea together with Buddhism around the 6th century. Climate in Japan being different from that on the continent, several structural adaptations became necessary, the most important of which is the noyane, invented some time during the Heian period (794‚Äì1185). During the previous Nara period (710‚Äì794), the structural elements of a roof were considered ornamental and therefore left exposed by design. The rafters supporting the roof's eaves would enter the building and would then be visible from below. Above the rafters would be laid directly on the roofing material, for example wood shingles. This is the structure of H≈çry≈´-ji's kon-d≈ç or five-storied pagoda. Because the local climate is more moist than in either China or Korea, roofs had to have a steeper incline to help quicken the flow of rainwater. Due to the permeable nature of the walls, and the lack of channelled roof drainage, it was necessary that eaves project far from the walls. On a roof of steep pitch, the wide eaves were also deep, restricting light to the windows and trapping humidity. The solution devised by Japanese artisans was to construct a hidden roof raised above a ceiling which had non-structural rafters as aesthetic elements. From the hidden roof projected the principal rafters of the shallow- pitched eaves. The structural elements of the outer roof were raised above this, with an outer inclination completely independent of the pitch of the eaves. The earliest extant example of hidden roof is H≈çry≈´-ji's Daik≈ç-d≈ç, built in 990 and was discovered only in the 1930s during repair work. Influence H≈çry≈´-ji's Daik≈ç-d≈ç is the earliest extant example of noyaneThis structure not only solved drainage problems, but eliminated deep shadows and gave the whole temple a feel that was very different from that of its ancestors of the Asian continent. It was as a consequence extremely successful and was widely adopted all over the country. One important exception is the architectural style called Daibutsuy≈ç which, although arrived in Japan from China at the end of the 12th century, thus well after the invention of the hidden roof, never adopted it. Also, although all extant Zen temples have it, it is likely that the Zensh≈´y≈ç style, which arrived roughly at the same time of the Daibutsuy≈ç, adopted the hidden roof only some time after its arrival. Because the hidden roof allowed the structure of the roof to be changed at will with no impact on the underlying building, its use gave birth to many structural innovations. For example, Fuki-ji's ≈å-d≈ç has a square roof over a rectangular footprint. Ways were also found to make use of the space between the two roofs. For example, at J≈çruri-ji in Ky≈çto (1107) part of the Hon-d≈ç's ceiling was raised above the rest to give space to the room. Later it would become common to raise the exposed roof above the entire core of a temple building. The same evolution we have seen in Buddhist architecture can be seen in the roofs of several Shinto architectural styles it influenced. The kasuga- zukuri, nagare-zukuri, hachiman-zukuri, hie-zukuri all followed the evolution path we have seen. All extant examples of the ancient shinmei-zukuri, taisha- zukuri and sumiyoshi-zukuri styles however show no sign of a hidden roof. =Tsumakazari= H≈çry≈´-ji, Denp≈ç-d≈ç. The tsumakazari, all structural elements in this case are visible within the gable. Before the invention of the hidden roof the so-called were simply structural elements left visible by design. See for example H≈çry≈´-ji's Denp≈ç-d≈ç in the photo to the right, where the brown elements within the gable are all part of the roof's support system. After the adoption of the hidden roof, the tsumakazari remained in use, albeit with a purely decorative role. =Nakazonae= Kentozuka, T≈çsh≈çdai-ji Another of the repercussions of the invention of the hidden roof was the role change undergone by struts called . Nakazonae are intercolumnar struts provided in the intervals between bracket complexes (toky≈ç) at religious buildings in Japan. In origin they were necessary to support the roof above, however at the end of the 10th century the invention of the hidden roof, which had its own hidden supporting structure, made them superfluous. They remained in use, albeit in a purely decorative role, assuming a variety of forms, and are typical of the Way≈ç style.

It is the fourth film by Rajendra Talak after the National Award winning Aleesha in 2004, Antarnad in 2006 and Sawariya.com in 2008. Plot Maria is a single woman of forty plus, living alone with her mother, running a quiet business of putting up tourists in her house by the sea and a small restaurant. She has the good fortune of owning a land and a house in a prime spot by the sea which is eyed by developers. The subject of sale of land in Goa and the outsider/insider issue has been plaguing the state for sometime and O Maria revolves around the same subject. In 2009 another Konkani film Zagor was also made on the same lines. Maria (Shernaz Patel) is a middle aged single woman who lives with her ailing mother (Sulbha Arya) and has foreign tourists as paying guests at her beachside home while she also runs a small restaurant. While one of her brother's sons Kevin (Kevin D'Mello) looks upon her as a mother, the other Jack (Aryan Khedekar) teams up with his mother, Philomena (Meenacshi Martins) to sell their ancestral property which is at a prime location to a Gujarati property developer Jiten Shah 'Jitubhai' (Tiku Talsania). For this he needs Maria‚Äôs approval because her brother John (tiatrist Roseferns) has already signed an agreement to this effect. Mike (Cory Goldberg), an American staying as a guest with Maria, also gets dragged into the issue. Cory Goldberg had earlier played the role of a tourist in the Incredible India ad campaign. Ruzar (tiatrist John D'Silva) plays the sacristan who gets the villages together. Reception The director was praised for his mature handling of the theme and for his realistic portrayal of Goans involved in the tourism industry and also his depiction of the way of life of Goan Christians.http://www.navhindtimes.in/iwatch/well-done-maria Not only did the film become the first Konkani film to cross the 50-day and 100-day barriers, but it also completed 25 weeks at the Inox multiplex at Panjim on 3 June 2011. However, there has been criticism that the plot was over simplified and the significant role of corrupt Goan politicians in such land deals was not shown. Music director, Remo Fernandes, disappointed that the song 'Maka Naka Tuka Naka' against corruption was dropped from the movie for unknown reasons after its video was filmed, said that since the CD was released by the Chief Minister and the Chief Minister was thanked in the very first frame, the director probably found his hands tied up. The choice of Shernaz Patel for the lead role was also commented upon as being a non-Goan, her pronunciations of Konkani were not up to the mark, even though her acting efforts were appreciated. Music Remo Fernandes has played every instrument on these tracks, sung all the male voices, and played the role of recording and pre-mixing engineer. The lyrics are by Saish Poi Palondikar. Four tracks were released by M. B. Creations and music label Rock and Raaga:http://www.navhindtimes.in/iwatch/music-launch-o-maria * Laranchim Cantaram: Sung by Remo Fernandes * Surganchim Fati: Sung by Remo Fernandes and Queenie Fernandes * Adeus Mai: Voices by Chriselle Mendonsa and Shine Fernandes * Maka Naka Tuka Naka: Sung by Remo Fernandes The music of the movie has become very popular and has been critically acclaimed.

Cross was a left back for Barnsley from 1983 to 1991. He progressed through the ranks of the youth side, finally achieving first team status under the management of local lad head-hunter, Allan Clarke. The defender owes much of his recognition to Eric Winstanley, a huge influence and early mentor of Cross. Cross was plagued with injury early in his career but persevered at Barnsley until 1991 before moving to Hartlepool United when the chairmanship was under financial scrutiny. Cross was joint-manager of Northern League club Crook Town between September 1997 and October 1998 alongside former Darlington teammate Kevan Smith. Cross has been a frequent radio commentator on Northern Derby matches between Darlington and Hartlepool, both teams he has played for.

The central part of the stained glass by Taddeo Gaddi =Gaddi artworks= The fresco cycle represents the Stories of the Virgin. In this work, Gaddi showed his mastership of Giotto's style, with a narrative disposition of the characters in the scenes, which are more crowded than his master's. He also continued to experiment the use of geometrical perspective in the architectural background, obtaining illusionistic effects in details such as the oblique staircase in the Presentation at the Temple. The two niches with still lifes in the basement are perhaps inspired by Giotto's ones in the Scrovegni Chapel. The delicate and soft features are characteristic of Gaddi's late style. The adoption of night light in the Annunciation to the Shepherds is nearly unique in the mid-14th century painting of central Italy. Gaddi also designed the stained glasses, with four prophets on the exterior, and perhaps had a hand in the altarpiece also: this, dating to c. 1328, has the signature Opus Magistri Jocti, but the style shows the hands of assistants, including Gaddi himself. It is an elaborate polyptych, depicting the Coronation of the Virgin surrounded by a crowded Glory of Angels and Saints. The cusp of the altarpiece is now at the San Diego Museum of Art of San Diego, California, United States. The original frame was replaced by a new one during the 15th century. =Other artworks= Baroncelli Polyptych, painted by Giotto. Other artworks in the chapel include, on the right wall, a Madonna of the Cintola by Sebastiano Mainardi. The Baroncelli Polyptych, painted by Giotto di Bondone c.1334, is in the chapel. The Baroncelli family owned the tomb on the external wall, which was designed by Giovanni di Balduccio in 1327. He also sculpted the statuettes of the Archangel Gabriel and the Annunciation on the arcade's pillars. The \\"Madonna with Child\\" sculpture inside the chapel was created by Vincenzo Danti in 1568.

It is used for decorative purposes on paints and plastics, giving them a matte, metal-like appearance.  Production process  Fig. 1: Pure aluminium oxide flakes Pure aluminium oxide flakes In the first step of the production process, Al2O3 (Aluminium oxide) flakes with a very smooth surface are formed. The flakes are produced using a crystal growth process. They are formed in the corundum structure (Œ±-Al2O3). The desired flake shape is achieved by controlled crystal growth in the axial and equatorial directions. The color purity and transparency of the effect pigments obtained by coating the Al2O3 flakes with metal oxides can be attributed to the synthesis procedure yielding single-crystalline thin flakes Nitta, K., Shau, T. M. Sugahara, J. EP 763 573Sharrock, S., Sch√ºl, N. \\"New Effect Pigments Based on SiO2 and Al2O3 Flakes\\", Eur. Coat. J. (1/2) (2000) 20 The coating of the alumina platelets with high-refractive metal oxides, such as with titanium dioxide and iron(III) oxide leads to strongly reflecting effect pigments. These pigments possess a strong glitter effect. The coating process is analogous to that used for metal oxide mica pigments except it starts from an aqueous suspension of Al2O3 flakes. The complete manufacturing process of pigments based on aluminum oxide platelets, consisting of the flake production and the coating with metal oxides is shown in Figure 1 Teaney, S., Pfaff, G., Nitta, K., \\"New Effect Pigments Using Innovative Substrates\\", Eur. Coat. J. (4) (1999) 90 For outdoor applications they are modified with an additional weather stabilizing surface treatment. Products Thickness of TiO2 determines the inference color Silverwhite and interference pigments based on Al2O3flakes can be produced‚Äîanalogous to similar pigments based on mica platelets‚Äîin different colors, e.g. gold, red, blue or green, by variation of the titanium dioxide layer thickness. Depending on the layer thickness, the coating with iron oxide leads to bronze-, copper- or red-colored effect pigments. The pigments obtainable at the market possess a narrow particle size distribution of about 5 to 30 Œºm as well as a high aspect ratio. The sparkle effect referred to above has its origin in the optimized thickness of all layers in the pigment structure, including the Al2O3substrate. Analytical investigations show that the thickness range of the aluminum oxide platelets and the resultant pigments can be controlled very precisely.Huber, A., Pfaff, G., \\"Spezielle Effektpigmente\\", Ph√§nomen Farbe (3) (2005) 34Etzoldt, G., Kittel ‚Äì Lehrbuch der Lacke und Beschichtungen (Pigmente, F√ºllstoffe und Farbmetrik), 2. Aufl., S. Hirzel Verlag Stuttgart-Leipzig, 2003, 160 Special effects car dummy coated with iron oxide coated Alumina flake The sparkle effect of the pigments in coating applications is controlled by the quantity of the added pigment. The effect is visible already at concentrations of 0.1% in the paint system. The intensity is steadily increased up to pigment concentrations of about 2%. The single light spots arising from the pigment structure and orientation in the paint system seem to spring back and forth when a painted metal plate is tilted. Also, the color of the other components of the paint has an influence in addition to the concentration of the pigment. A dark color, for example, forms a high contrast to the bright light spots and strengthens the effect. Favorable is also the use of a covering varnish in order to achieve an optimal effect.Pfaff, G., Huber, A., ‚ÄúSpezielle Effektpigmente auf Basis von Aluminiumoxid-Pl√§ttchen‚Äù, Welt der Farben (9) (2005) 14] The pigments can be applied with all painting techniques established for conventional pearlescent and interference pigments. Effect pigments based on alumina flakes may be applied in all substantial systems, i.e. in coatings, plastics, printing inks and cosmetic formulations. An additional surface treatment is applied to the pigment particles to adjust them to solvent-based and water-based coating systems. The pigments can be used in combination with many conventional pigments as well as with other effect pigments. Nearly unlimited styling possibilities are the result of these combinations.

Plot  In the final book of the trilogy, we discover that Loethar is actually the older half brother of King Brennus and thus the rightful heir to the throne. On the other hand, the supposedly retarded half brother Piven has matured beyond his age and also discovered his magical abilities as a healer. However, it is said that with every bit of magic he uses, the further he goes to the dark side and when he brings a boy called Roddy back to life, he finally enters the threshold of being evil. Piven then proceeds to trammel Greven, his foster father by brutally severing off his hand and roasting it before finally eating it. Piven manages to use the unlimited resources that come with an Aegis to kill Sergius. During all this time, Roddy has been following Piven because he senses some sort of attraction to him, hinting that he may be an Aegis as well. When Roddy arrives at the scene, Sergius is already dead and his trusty friend Raven is there, mourning his death. Raven then goes through a process where he attains a human body, which looks exactly like the first Valisar. When Roddy and Raven meet, they share an instant connection and they become friendly with one another.

The Gustav-Ammann-Park is a public park in Oerlikon, Zurich, is built on the former area of the B√ºrhle AG and covers 32,291 ft¬≤. In 1996, the privately owned park became a preserve. One year later, the formerly nameless facility was handed over to the population as Gustav-Ammann-Park. It was gently renovated in 2004/2005, maintaining all historical garden monuments. The name of the park reminds us of Gustav Ammann (1886‚Äì1955), a well-known Swiss landscape architect who worked in the modernist style.Gustav-Ammann-Park. Office of Parks and Open Spaces of Zurich, 2005. Development In 1942, a ¬´welfare building¬ª and accompanying park were built on the site of the former tool factory B√ºhrle & Co for their staff. With welfare in mind, a garden was created which focussed on the relaxation of the staff, not the appearance. The landscape architect Gustav Ammann created a peaceful refuge from the noise of the factory. With the conversion of parts of the factory area, the former welfare garden was opened to the public and renamed as the Gustav-Ammann Park. As before, the park is privately owned and the right of use by the population and maintenance by the Office of Parks and Open Spaces of Zurich is regulated in a contract. For the most part, the park retained its original form, however many areas were in a bad condition and had to be renovated. On behalf of the Office of Parks and Open Spaces, Ryffel & Ryffel Landscape Architects, Uster composed a written report in 1994 and from 2004 to 2005 they carefully restored the park with consideration of the garden as a monument. The project planned to restore all surface areas and the sandstone dry walls. Many timbers in the large pergola were rotten and were replaced by polygonal ones as per the historical model. Some timbers had to be cleared for reasons of health or space, together with any shrubbery added in error. This gives the park a more open appearance. The new herbaceous borders around the building give accents of colour again today. The former solid factory door has been replaced by a lighter construction.project information: Renovation of Gustav-Ammann-Park. Office of Parks and Open Spaces of Zurich, 2004. Design Today the Gustav- Amman Park, which is a protected monument, supplements the park landscape in Oerlikon, which is characterized by new innovative green areas in particular. As a welfare garden, the Gustav-Ammann-Park is unique in Switzerland. The design of the park includes many characteristic features of a residential garden and, together with the building, has been protected since 1996. Small seating areas, covered promenade paths, natural stone walls, shrubs, intricate granite stone paths, and a small pond give an almost Mediterranean atmosphere.Vor den Werktoren das Tessin: Der Wohlfahrtsgarten der Firma B√ºhrle 1941/42.

Life and career Corri was born in Walworth, London, the son of William Charles Cunningham Corri and Maria Louisa Pennal. He came from an Italian family of musicians who settled in Britain in the 18th century.

The Baglioni Chapel is a chapel in the Collegiate church of Santa Maria Maggiore, Spello, central Italy. It is known for its Renaissance frescoes executed by Pinturicchio from c. 1500 to 1501. History The decoration was commissioned by the prior (later bishop) Troilo Baglioni, and the end of the work is assigned to 1501. The work was the last important one by Pinturicchio in Umbria, before his sojourns in Rome and Siena. The paintings, typically for Pinturicchio, were executed rapidly thanks to a well-organized workshop, with other masters painting above his drawings. In the later 16th century, the chapel received a pavement with Deruta ceramics. It was restored in 1976‚Äì77 and provided with an air conditioning system against the effects of humidity. The Annunciation. Description The chapel has a quadrangular floor plan with a cross-vault. The frescoes' theme is stories from the childhoods of Mary and of Jesus. The vault contains four Sibyls, sitting on thrones and flanked by cartouches with prophecies of the coming of Jesus. Largely damaged and over-painted, they were perhaps made by Bartolomeo Caporali. The wide grotesque candelabra on the ogives are perhaps from the same artist, due to similarities to those he painted in church of Sant'Antonio Abate at Deruta. The three main scenes, in the shape of lunettes, occupy the three available walls and are enclosed within painted pillars and arches. The latter's painted intrados has geometrical and rosetta decorations, and creates the illusionistic effect of a Greek-cross plan. Detail of Pinturicchio's self-portrait in the Annunciation. =Annunciation= The left wall shows the Annunciation, set in a large Renaissance loggia whose pavement, depicted in geometrical perspective, leads, behind the hortus conclusus, to a richly detailed landscape. The main characters are conventional ones: Mary is distracted from reading by an angel, who kneels to bless her with a white lily in one hand, a symbol of her virginal purity. In the upper part God the Father is depicted, surrounded by angels, emitting a ray of light incorporating the Holy Ghost in the form of a dove. The right part of the fresco shows a window with a grid; on the left is a shelf with books and an amphora: under it is a self-portrait of Pinturicchio, featuring the dedicatory bejewelled inscription, \\"BERNARDINVS PICTORICIVS PERVSIN[VS]\\". The Adoration of the Shepherds. =Adoration of the Shepherds= The central wall features the Adoration of the Shepherds, depicting the arrival of the Magi procession in the background. The scene is set on a lawn before the stable, portrayed with sotto in su perspective. A landscape can be seen behind a window in the stable. The shepherds in the foreground have expressive and detailed features, after the fashion of early Netherlandish painting which influenced Pinturicchio. The young man on the left with a goat is depicted with a more idealized beauty, inspired by ancient reliefs with sacrifice motifs. The group of the Madonna with Child re-uses the typology of the Adoration of the Shepherds painted by Pinturicchio in the Presepio Chapel of Santa Maria del Popolo in Rome. In the upper part there is a choir of angels. The background is rich in detail, including a well-defined city with a miniature appeal. Among the allegoric elements, a peacock sits on the stable as a symbol of immortality. =Dispute with the Doctors= The right wall is occupied by the Dispute with the Doctors. The Child Jesus is surrounded by two groups of philosophers of the Temple of Jerusalem, which can be seen in the background and is characterized by a large dome. The scene follows a scheme already used by Pinturicchio in the Bufalini Chapel, which was in turn derived from that adopted by Perugino in his Delivery of the Keys in the Sistine Chapel. The edifice has a central plan and has two niches with decorations, grotesques and ancient statues. The crowd is formed by standard characters including young spouses, wise men, toothless women and other normal spectators. These include some portraits, such as that of Troilo Baglioni on the left, wearing the dress of a protonotary apostolic.

In June 2010, they bought the Castle League franchise of The Guys, and hereby bought a promotion to play in the Vodacom League. Their first season at this level proved to be very successful. They managed to win the Eastern Cape Province, and thus qualified for the Promotional playoffs in June 2011, with a chance of further promotion to the National First Division. Currently they are using Jan Smuts Stadium both as training field and home venue. Achievements Won the Eastern Cape province in Vodacom League 2010‚Äì11, after achieving 21 victories, 5 draws and 4 defeats. This was good enough to win the league, 6 points ahead of Tornado. After the season, a complaint and appeal case was launched by Tornado, claiming that FC Buffalo was guilty of a disciplinary violation, and thus not the rightful winner of the division. SAFA however refused this appeal, and ruled that FC Buffalo was the rightful winner of the division, now to enter the round robin stage of the Promotional Playoffs from June 7‚Äì12.

It is bordered to the north by Cape Range National Park. The station has an area of approximately and offers accommodation to travellers to the area in the form of camp-sites. The station is located adjacent to Ningaloo Reef as are Gnaraloo Station to the North and Cardabia Station and Warroora Station to the South. Operating since at least 1919, the station produced at least 33 bales of wool in that year. The station was operated as a partnership between Herbert William Cope, Douglas Black and Leslie Leon Grant Black. Receiving good falls of rain, by June, in 1923 the land contained excellent feed and lambing was heavy. A new machine shearing shed and quarters were constructed using materials from the schooner Geraldton that were landed in May. Fire broke out at the station early in November but was quickly brought under control with only minimal damage occurring. Later the same year over 9,000 sheep were shorn and 215 bales of wool were produced by a shearing team of seven men over the course of three weeks, this was a record clip for the station. The wool was collected by Geraldton and shipped to Perth. Over 1,200 sheep were removed from the station in 1924 and droved overland by Mr Cope to the port at Carnarvon over a period of 25 days. Although water was only available every second day only a dozen sheep were lost and the flock reached the port in excellent condition. Later the same year 10,100 sheep were shorn at the station, yielding 175 bales of wool; 3,000 lambs were also shorn, yielding an additional 30 bales. Cope dissolved the partnership with the Blacks when he decided to retire in June 1924; the Blacks then took over sole ownership of the property. The station had good falls of rain in 1927 and the country was reported as looking the best for five years, with good feed available. In all of rain fell between March and July, but shearing was expected to be poor with only 1000 lambs around due to the poor conditions from the previous years. 3,490 sheep were sold off from the station at the Midland Junction sale yards in 1929. The Blacks sold the station in June 1937 to F. Lefroy and M. McBolt, who took possession of the property immediately. Ningaloo and other nearby stations, including Wooramel Station, suffered from extensive damage from flooding following the passing of the remnants of a cyclone over the area in 1945. The area received heavy rains in 1953 with Ningaloo being deluged with 303 points of rain overnight. Surrounding stations received falls of up to . In 2008 there was a rally of over 300 people to protest against the Department of Environment and Conservation move to take over the management of camping along the station's pristine coastline. The Lefroy family, who have held the lease on the station for over 70 years, were shocked at only being given five days to hand over management of its camp- sites. The state government also plans to extend its removal of the station coastline by , covering an area of .

In these two types of enzymes, the C-terminal domain forms a zinc finger. DNA glycosylase/AP lyase enzymes are involved in base excision repair of DNA damaged by oxidation or by mutagenic agents. These enzymes have both DNA glycosylase activity (EC) and AP lyase activity (EC). Examples include formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylases (Fpg; MutM) and endonuclease VIII (Nei). Formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylases (Fpg, MutM) is a trifunctional DNA base excision repair enzyme that removes a wide range of oxidation-damaged bases (N-glycosylase activity; EC) and cleaves both the 3'- and 5'-phosphodiester bonds of the resulting apurinic/apyrimidinic site (AP lyase activity; EC). Fpg has a preference for oxidised purines, excising oxidized purine bases such as 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG). ITs AP (apurinic/apyrimidinic) lyase activity introduces nicks in the DNA strand, cleaving the DNA backbone by beta-delta elimination to generate a single-strand break at the site of the removed base with both 3'- and 5'-phosphates. Fpg is a monomer composed of 2 domains connected by a flexible hinge. The two DNA-binding motifs (a zinc finger and the helix-two-turns-helix motifs) suggest that the oxidized base is flipped out from double-stranded DNA in the binding mode and excised by a catalytic mechanism similar to that of bifunctional base excision repair enzymes. Fpg binds one ion of zinc at the C terminus, which contains four conserved and essential cysteines. Endonuclease VIII (Nei) has the same enzyme activities as Fpg above, but with a preference for oxidized pyrimidines, such as thymine glycol, 5,6-dihydrouracil and 5,6-dihydrothymine. An Fpg-type zinc finger is also found at the C terminus of isoleucyl tRNA synthetase (EC). This enzyme catalyses the attachment of isoleucine to tRNA(Ile). As IleRS can inadvertently accommodate and process structurally similar amino acids such as valine, to avoid such errors it has two additional distinct tRNA(Ile)-dependent editing activities. One activity is designated as 'pre- transfer' editing and involves the hydrolysis of activated Val-AMP. The other activity is designated 'post-transfer' editing and involves deacylation of mischarged Val-tRNA(Ile).

The Grand Dictation of the Dutch Language (Dutch: Groot Dictee der Nederlandse Taal) was a televised spelling test for adults organized by the Belgian newspaper De Morgen, the Dutch newspaper de Volkskrant and the Dutch public broadcaster NTR.http://grootdictee.nps.nl, accessed June 6, 2011. In May 2017 it was announced no more dictations would be held due to the number of viewers strongly receding. From its first edition in 1990 through its final one in 2016, the Grand Dictation was held annually in December. Starting 1991, it was televised on Dutch and Dutch-language Belgian television. The Dictation was presented and read by Dutch former anchorman Philip Freriks. Since 2005 Freriks presented jointly with Belgian anchorwoman Martine Tanghe, except in 2011 when Tanghe was recovering from breast cancer. The dictation took place in the plenary hall of the First Chamber in The Hague. Each year there were about sixty participants: forty from the Netherlands and twenty from Belgium. Half of each group consisted of invited prominent figures and half of members of the public, selected from a qualifying round in De Morgen and de Volkskrant. From 2004 onwards, the text of the Dictation was written by prominent writers, including Jan Mulder and Remco Campert (2004), Herman Koch (2005), Martin Bril (2006), Jan Wolkers (2007), Kristien Hemmerechts (2008), Gerrit Komrij (2009), Tommy Wieringa (2010), Arnon Grunberg (2011) and Adriaan van Dis (2012). The spelling rules adhered to were those of what is popularly known as the Green Booklet. For words not mentioned in the Green Booklet, the Van Dale dictionary applied. Out of the first 23 shows, fourteen were won by Flemish and eleven by Dutch contestants. Once, in 2011, first place was shared between a Dutch and a Belgian contestant. The Belgian newscaster Freek Braeckman is the only invited prominent figure to have won. In 2011 the Walloon journalist Christophe Deborsu was the first French-speaking participant.

His wife ‚Äì who is French ‚Äì has been barred since January 2016 from entering Israel or the Occupied West Bank to visit him. Hamouri was arrested in 2005 and accused of plotting to murder Ovadia Yosef. After over 3 years' detention without trial, on the advice of his lawyer, while protesting his innocence he admitted culpability in a plea bargain in order to avoid a 14-year term of imprisonment, and was condemned by a military tribunal to serve a 7 year sentence. A number of committees have formed to protest against his treatment and affirm his innocence. Hamouri was released in exchange for the return of the Israeli POW Gilad Shalit in December 2011. He has been repeatedly placed under a regime of administrative detention ‚Äì which Amnesty International considers 'a major human rights violation' ‚Äì a procedure depriving people of their personal liberty by arresting and keeping them in custody, without laying charges or putting them on trial. The procedure can be repeated indefinitely. It has been claimed that he has been held in detention for a crime of opinion.  Biography  Salah Hamouri, is a native Jerusalemite, resident in the one neighbourhood, Dahyat el-Barid, of Al-Ram enclosed within Israel's Jerusalem municipal boundaries. He was born 25 April 1985 in Jerusalem, one of three children ‚Äì a brother, Amir, and a sister, Caroline -to a French mother, Denise-Annick Hamouri, , from Bourg-en-Bresse, who teaches French at a private Catholic school in West Jerusalem, and a Palestinian father, Hassan Hamouri, who manages a restaurant in East Jerusalem. He is trilingual in Arabic, Hebrew and French, and has dual nationality, Palestinian and French, with French citizenship and an Israeli identity card. An alumnus of the Catholic private school of Fr√®res de Lasalle de J√©rusalem in East Jerusalem, after his Baccalaureate he enrolled in sociology at Bethlehem University, and subsequently studied law and qualified as a lawyer. On 29 May 2014, he married Elsa Lefort, an employee of the Institut fran√ßais du Proche-Orient, resident in East Jerusalem and daughter of the French politician, long time French Communist Party deputy and secretary to Georges Marchais Jean-Claude Lefort. On 5 January 2016, his wife, then six months pregnant, was arrested and detained for two days after arriving at Ben- Gurion Airport and thereafter expelled from Israel, despite having a consular visa valid until October of that year. Previous attempts to renew her visa had met with repeated refusals on the grounds that her husband was free as part of a prisoners' exchange deal, which automatically left him blacklisted by every branch of the Israeli government. She was forbidden to reenter either Israel or the West Bank under military administration, for a period of 10 years, on the grounds that she constituted a threat to the security of Israel. When he is held in detention no correspondence is allowed between Hamouri and his French wife. Both his wife and his French father-in-law have been since subject to harassment and threats after a website published their addresses. By refusing to allow his wife to finish her pregnancy in Jerusalem, the Israeli authorities automatically deprived their child of the right to a residency permit in that city, a decision that, it has been argued, also reflects a battle for demographic ascendency, as reflected in the policy of the Judaization of Jerusalem. = Early Arrests and accusations = In the early months of the Al-Aqsa Intifada, Hamouri was shot in the thigh with live ammunition during a confrontation between Israeli troops and demonstrators at Al-Ram in northern Jerusalem. The bullet remains lodged there to this day. He was first arrested and placed under administrative detention when he was 16 years old, in 2001. He was caught handing out leaflets protesting Israeli colonization, and was sentenced to five months in jail for 'anti-Israeli propaganda' or/and for being a member of a student union (syndicat des √©tudiants). On his release he resumed his studies at the lyceum, and graduated in June 2003. At 19, he was again arrested by the Shin Bet in 2004, and from February of that year served another five month term in prison, without trial, on suspicion of being a member of George Habash's Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine(PFLP), a Palestinian Marxist organization Israel regards as terroristic. Hamouri has denied being a member of that organization, though he defends the movement as an integral member of the PLO and sympathises with its aims. =Alleged involvement in a plot against Ovadia Yosef= In September 2005 Moussa Darwish (22) from the East Jerusalem village of Isawiya, who had joined the PFLP in 2000, confessed that he had planned to assassinate Ovadia Yosef, the head of the ultra-orthodox Shas party. Darwish, after entering a plea bargain agreement, was subsequently sentenced to a 12 year prison term in mid-December of that year. Darwish had been employed by a grocery near Ovadia's house and had made home deliveries to his residence in Har Nof, something that afforded him the opportunity to case the property and familiarize himself with its security arrangements. He developed a plan, and suggested to another PFLP member that they kill Ovadia by shooting him while driving by on a motorbike. The two accomplices were believed to have visited Givat Shaul in December 2004 to prepare their attempt, but the plan was foiled the following month when a scheduled consignment of ammunition from a third party at the Shuafat checkpoint was blocked by the presence of IDF soldiers which made the proposed transfer too risky. In delivering their judgment the court stated that Darwish's plot, if executed, would have jeopardized the security of Israel by instigating revenge attacks against Arabs in Jerusalem. The foiling of such a plot had been cleared for publication several months earlier in April 2005, a month after Hamouri's own arrest. It was reported then that, in addition to Darwish, Hamouri, then 19, and Moatsam (var. Muatztaf) Sheikh (25) from 'Anata, were involved. Security sources were reported as asserting that Hamouri together with a friend, having purchased arms, had driven past Ovadia's home in January 2005 in order to case it; that PFLP inmates incarcerated in Jericho on suspicion of being involved in the murder of Rehavam Ze'evi several years earlier had mulled the idea of selecting Ovadia as a target and this had filtered through to Hamouri during his detention. Other sources state that Darwish came up with the idea. Hamouri was arrested on 13 March 2005 at the Qalqilya checkpoint while he was driving home to Ramallah. He was ordered to get out of his vehicle by soldiers, blindfolded and handcuffed, and arrested without explanation before being sent for detention in Jerusalem's Moscovia Prison where he was held incommunicado under administrative detention for three months. Two hours later Israeli agents ransacked his parents' home in East Jerusalem, seizing his computer's hard disk, and even dismantling the toilet in search of evidence. His parents only learned of the charges laid against him from the newspapers a month later, where it was claimed he had driven past Ovadia's home in January after having purchased arms. Hamouri was kept in administrative detention for three years and eventually shifted to Gilboa prison near the Syrian frontier, where he learnt Hebrew in order to pursue courses given to prisoners there. No more than two books ‚Äì one of which had to be of a religious nature ‚Äì were allowed to detainees. Hamouri chose as his defense lawyer Leah Tsemel. On 16 February 2008, during a visit to Israel by Bernard Kouchner Hamouri's mother Denise managed to tell him she thought three years detention was more than enough. Kouchner took this as a request for a speedy trial, and two days later, the military prosecutor contacted Tsemel and offered a bargain: a seven year term of imprisonment, rather than fourteen, if he admitted to the facts. The charges were that * That he was a member of a youth cell of the PFLP * That he intended to participate in a plot (against Ovadia). The evidence for the latter was based on the fact that he was seen by an informer passing in front of Ovadia's home. The material for an indictment in the hands of the prosecution was thin. There was no physical evidence, weapons, intercepted letters, plan or phone taps. The only proof they could introduce consisted of testimonies, later retracted, given by other Palestinians, and Salah's own admission that he had indeed driven past Ovadia's home with a friend, one of the accused. Otherwise, Hamouri maintained he was innocent of the charges laid against him, and dismisses the idea that he and his friends were involved in a 'plot'. On Tsemel's advice, while protesting his innocence, Hamouri entered into a plea bargaining arrangement before a military tribunal, ‚Äì a compromise 95% of Palestinian prisoners adopt ‚Äì admitting culpability in exchange for a 7 year prison sentence in order to avoid a longer term of imprisonment. Israeli authorities had also given him the option of either leaving Israel for 10 years or face 7 years in prison, Hamouri preferred incarceration to the prospect of exile. 2011 Release: the Shalit-Hamouri prisoner exchange Hamouri was eventually released on 18 December 2011 as part of a second tranche in a prisoner exchange deal between Israel and Hamas involving another French citizen, the soldier Gilad Shalit who had been captured by Hamas and used as a bargaining chip by Hamas for the release of Palestinian prisoners. A disparity has been noted in the two cases: while Shalit was detained, French diplomacy was highly active in endeavours to secure the release of the French- Israeli, whereas a parallel request that a French Palestinian's case be raised as a political issue was ignored. Requests by Hamouri's mother, a Frenchwoman with a son in detention, to be received by Nicolas Sarkozy at the √âlys√©e were rebuffed. Sarkozy had requested Israel to release Hamouri during his visit to the country in June 2008, and the following year in a letter to the Prime Minister on 30 July 2009, asked for clemency and a reduction of his sentence by a third in recognition of his good behaviour, as did Bernard Kouchner. With the appointment of Alain Jupp√© as head of Foreign Affairs at the Quai d'Orsay, there was a slight change in the climate. Jupp√© wrote to Marie-France Beaufils, a senator, on 31 March 2011 that: > I regret that the Israeli authorities did not make a decision to remit the > sentence, especially as the confession made at the hearing was not > corroborated by any evidence. I appreciate his family's grief as he is at an > age for dedicating himself to study. I also understand that the person > concerned has chosen not to ask for a pardon. It's an attitude worthy of > respect.' Hamouri's release was conditioned on Ovadia's consent, which the latter gave reportedly in order to secure Shalit's release. Binjamin Netanyahu had regularly turned down official French requests for clemency on the grounds that he had to defer to the views of Ovadia. In 2011 Sarkozy therefore repeated the request directly in a letter to Ovadia, who, after consulting with Zvi Ammar in Marseilles, replied that he would not oppose Harmouri's release. On regaining his freedom, when asked about his imprisonment, Hamouri replied he had no regrets about the choices he had made. With regard to Ovadia, he stated that the rabbi was and would remain a symbol of racism and fanaticism in Israel: Ovadia had likened Palestinians to reptiles in 2000, suggested that Arabs be wiped out with missiles, and hoped that God would smite them with a plague. His remarks were construed in Israeli media as confirming a desire by Hamouri that Ovadia be killed, a suggestion he rebuffed as a lie churned out by propaganda machinery. His wife later commented that in Hamouri's case, French diplomacy had been based on 'discretion': 'they have been very discrete. The mere fact of being imprisoned in Israel turns one into a suspect, despite everything.' In France many commentators, prominent among them Pascal Boniface, have noted a striking incongruency between the way French diplomacy showcased the imprisonment of Shalit and treated his release as a matter of urgency, and the muted discretion ‚Äì some say 'indifference' ‚Äì shown to Hamouri's plight during his incarceration without trial for three years. 2011-2016 Hamouri changed his vocational interests from sociology to law, and enrolled as a law student at Al Quds University near Abu Dis in the West Bank. His access to the University suffered from several bureaucratic hassles () regarding his freedom of movement. In April 2015, the military commander of the West Bank Nitzan Alon banned him from entering the area for a period of six months, from 24 March until 24 September 2015, meaning that he would not be able to sit his exam in July to qualify as a lawyer. He subsequently enrolled in graduate school for a master's degree in human rights. The ban was renewed twice hindering his practical training to be a lawyer. The restriction, whose rationale was unexplained, lasted continuously for one and a half years, destroying his social life, obstructing his participation in social events with family such as weddings and graduation ceremonies; and denied him access to his workplace in Ramallah, or visiting his parents in Al-Ram. Re-arrest On 20 August 2017, having completed his legal studies, Hamouri was admitted to the Palestinian bar as a qualified lawyer. He lacked only certification to practice, which was scheduled on taking an oath in September. Three days later, he was re-arrested during a night raid on his home in Kafr Aqab on 23 August, and placed under detention for five days. His family only learned of his arrest after his neighbour phoned them. A hearing took place on 27 August, and, when the prosecution failed to list a charge sheet for indictment, the judge order his release conditionally: he was to be confined for 10 days in Reineh, banned from Jerusalem for 3 months, prohibited from travel for the same period, and required to post bail for $3,000. His father immediately undertook to post the bail, but the bureaucratic procedure took time. Before it was completed, on the 29 August the Israeli Minister for Defense Avigdor Lieberman issued an order once more placing him under the regime of administrative detention for six months in Ktzi'ot Prison in the Negev where his mother was permitted to visit him for 45 minutes once a month. The detention blocked his completion of his Master's degree in law. On 5 September, a date set aside to confirm the order, the Jerusalem Magistrate Court, rather than confirm the order, adopted a different decision, determining that Hamouri was to serve the three months in prison remaining over from his 2005 conviction. This ruling was challenged by the prosecution and eventually, the Israeli District Court ruled in its favour, reinstating the 6 month detention order. In November, Israel declared seven members of a French delegation of 20 politicians intending to visit Israel to examine the state of Palestinians in detention, as personae non gratae. Among the seven denied entry were Pierre Laurent, Cl√©mentine Autain, Patrick Le Hyaric and Pascal Durand. The other 13 were given entry permits conditional on their not meeting Marwan Barghouti and Hamouri. On 28 December 2017 Israeli authorities informed him he would be moved to the high-security Megiddo prison for engaging in 'incitement': he had given an interview with a French journalist and had discussed the techniques used by the IPS in dealing with people under conditions of administrative detention . The order was renewed for another four months on the expiry of its term in February 2018. Amnesty International's Deputy Director for the Middle East and North Africa demanded that Israel either release him or charge him immediately, since in the view of that organization the detention regime under which he is held places him in an 'indefinite limbo' on secret evidence he or his lawyers have no access to. Hamouri was due to be release on the expiry of his second term of detention without trial on 30 June. On 1 July, however, the regime of administrative detention was prolonged by another three months. 109 French public figures, including the socialist Senator Monique Cerisier-ben Guiga offered collectively to take his place in jail, as hostages, to permit his release. After serving 13 consecutive months in prison without trial, he was finally released on 30 September 2018. The allegations against him remained unspecified but the terms of his release stated he was prohibited from demonstrations, protests or celebrating the occasion for one month, and he was required to post a bond of $825 to that effect. While in Europe he made frequent public appearances to plead for an improvement in the conditions of incarceration of some 6,000 Palestinian prisoners. =2020= Since the beginning of the occupation in 1967, over 14,500 Palestinian Jerusalemites have been deprived of their residency rights in the city. In 2018 a law was passed in the Knesset empowering the Israeli government revoke permanent resident status in cases where it deemed a person had committed what it calls a 'breach of trust against the state'. In one calculation the use of breach of trust to expel Palestinian residents predates this bill, with at least 15 Palestinians being stripped of their residency rights on those grounds since 2006. In February 2019, the Israeli Ministry of Strategic Affairs issued a report in which Hamouri is one of three prominent Palestinian human rights figures ‚Äì the other two being Shawan Jabarin, director-general of the Al-Haq organization, and Raja Sourani, director of the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights ‚Äì listed as 'terrorists in suits'. Hamouri was arrested on Tuesday 30 June 2020 near a Sheikh Jarrah Health Centre while taking a Covid19 test, preliminary to leaving on a flight to Paris the following Saturday, 4 July. He was then taken to the Moscovia Detention Centre and detained their for 8 days for 'further investigations', until he secured release by paying a further $US290 to the $585 in bail money he had already posted, with an interdiction order not to speak for three months (90 days) to a number of people, though he was not provided with a list of their names. On 3 September, he was informed by letter by Interior Minister Aryeh Deri, now the head of Ovadia's Shas party, that his residency permit would be revoked. He was given a month to appeal the decision. The reason given was that it was believed that Hamouri continued to be an active member of the PFLP and as such was classified as an internal enemy as part of Israel's ongoing war against terrorism. The French government registered an official protest, requesting that his expulsion be postponed and that he be allowed to rejoin his family. On 7 September, the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) expressed alarm at what they called the 'judicial harassment' of Hamouri, and argued that the Israeli law (Entry into Israel Law of 1952, article 11) used to revoke Hamouri's residential status violates International Humanitarian Law. Secondly they argued that the law is also in breach of Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, according to which > Individual or mass forcible transfers, as well as deportations of protected > persons from occupied territory to the territory of the Occupying Power or > to that of any other country, occupied or not, are prohibited, regardless of > their motive. In the opinion of Munir Nusseibeh of Al-Quds university, the planned measure also violates article 8 of the statute of the International Criminal Court, and the implementation of the expulsion would make Aryeh Deri liable to prosecution for a war crime.

His choice of art was based on the history of the neighborhood. Antoine Poncet, at that time president of de l'Acad√©mie fran√ßaise, opened the exhibition. It was supported by international galleries, the Rijksakademie, Dutch company collections, artists and museums like the Stedelijk Museum. The event attracted 90,000 visitors. * ARTZUID 2011: The second edition of ARTZUID was called The World Around - Equality in Diversity and opened by Queen Beatrix. Curator Jan Cremer, a leading writer and artist, mixed European sculptures with works by artists from Brazil, Surinam, India, Ghana, China, Indonesia, the US, and more to reflect the mixed population of Amsterdam. Artists from 21 countries participated with fifty-eight sculptures from various artists like Anthony Caro, Jean Tinguely, Anthony Gormley, Marcel Pinas, Salvador Dal√≠, Ryas Komu, Lu Shengzhong, Eko Prawoto, Thomas Houseago, Jaume Plensa, Atelier van Lieshout, Subodh Gupta, Yayoi Kusama, Jean Dubuffet, Rodin, Dennis Oppenheim, Ugo Rondinone, Joost Conijn etc. * ARTZUID 2013: The theme of the third exhibition was Engagement. Foundation ArtZuid, together with curator Henk van Os, professor of Art and Society at the University of Amsterdam, decided to \\"shake up assumptions and suppositions\\", demonstrating how engagement unites artists from all continents. Moreover, all the sculptures were meant to add meaning to the so-called Plan Zuid (\\"South Plan\\") of architect Hendrik Petrus Berlage. * ARTZUID 2015: Amsterdam, City of Sculptures. Rudi Fuchs, former director of the Stedelijk Museum, was a curator of the fourth edition of the exhibition. That time the open-air sculpture route in Amsterdam attracted more than 500,000 visitors. The highlights of the exhibition were: Tony Cragg's bronze works, Mimmo Paladino's statues, KAWS' cartoon figures, Jaume Plensa's monumental sculptures. * ARTZUID 2017: The celebration of the fifth edition ARTZUID shared with 100th anniversary of De Stijl movement. This time Rudi Fuchs chose abstraction, \\"the great new revelation of modern art\\", to be a theme which embraced all the sculptures placed in a 2,5 kilometer route in Amsterdam. ARTZUID 2019 takes place from May 17 to September 15, 2019. Dynamic sections are created for solo presentations, group exhibitions and site-specific installations.

Cubam is essentially composed of amnionless (AMN), and cubilin. Cubilin is essential as a cell receptor recognizing the \\"vitamin B12-intrinsic factor\\" complex, whereas amnionless is more involved in the receptor mediated endocytosis of the complex.  Clinical significance  Vitamin B12 is an essential water- soluble vitamin, the absorption of which relies on a functional secretion of salivary haptocorrin, functional secretion of gastric intrinsic factor, functional cleavage of the haptocorrin via pancreatic protease, and a functional absorption via the Cubam at terminal ileum. As expected, a defect at any point of the aforementioned list, can cause malabsoption of vitamin B12, and subsequent macrocytic anemia. The most common cause of Vitamin B12 deficiency is deficiency of the intrinsic factor (IF) usually due to atrophic gastritis, which reduces the number of parietal cells secreting intrinsic factor. This can lead to pernicious anemia. However, a rare abnormality of AMN can also cause vitamin B12 anemia; this condition is referred to as \\"Imerslund-Gr√§sbeck syndrome (IGS).\\" Autosomal recessive mutations in both components of Cubam (AMN, and cubilin) is responsible for Imerslund-Gr√§sbeck syndrome, which manifests as macrocytic, megaloblastic anemia. Severe vitamin B12 deficiency is most commonly caused by an autoimmune mediated deficiency in intrinsic factor. Rarely, a mutations in the gene CUBN, coding for cubilin, or AMN, coding for amnionless cause an autosomal recessive form of vitamin B12 deficiency, known as the Imerslund-Gr√§sbeck syndrome. Cubilin and amnionless also play a role in renal tubular function. Cubilin is essential for embryonic development in rodents, but appears not to be essential for normal human embryonic development.

It is located south of the major West Java city of Bandung. Main industries of the Pangalengan district include dairy farming and tourism, the latter arising from the popularity of the many traditional villages and natural attractions such as lakes, ponds, hot springs and waterfalls in the district. The area is an important centre of activity for the tea industry in Indonesia. There is also considerable interest in the potential for the use of geothermal sites in the region for the production of electricity. The Wayang Windu plant, the largest geothermal plant in Indonesia with a capacity of 227 megawatts, is located to the east of Pangalengan on the slopes of the Wayang Windu volcano.

These laid the world away; poured out the red Sweet wine of youth; gave up the years to be Of work and joy, and that unhoped serene, That men call age; and those who would have been. Their sons, they gave, their immortality. Blow, bugles, blow! They brought us, for our dearth. Holiness, lacked so long, and Love, and Pain.

IV: The Dead These hearts were woven of human joys and cares, Washed marvellously with sorrow, swift to mirth. The years had given them kindness. Dawn was theirs, And sunset, and the colours of the earth. These had seen movement, and heard music; known Slumber and waking; loved; gone proudly friended; Felt the quick stir of wonder; sat alone; Touched flowers and furs and cheeks. All this is ended.

It was sponsored by King Charles III of Spain and headed by physician Mart√≠n Sess√© y Lacasta, who led a team of botanists that included Jos√© Mariano Moci√±o and is part of the crown's general program of economic revitalization, known as the Bourbon Reforms. The expedition, commonly referred to by botanists as the Sess√© and Moci√±o expedition, identified many species new to science and brought back a large trove of valuable botanical illustrations. The expedition was \\"an undertaking that was to signal Spain's reassertion of its colonial might and of its relevance to the Enlightenment.\\"L√≥pez, Rick A. \\"Nature as Subject and Citizen in the Mexican Botanical Garden, 1787-1829\\" in Christopher R. Boyer, ed. A Land Between Waters: Environmental Histories of Modern Mexico. Tucson: University of Arizona Press 2012, p.73 Background Mart√≠n Sess√©, a Spanish physician employed by the Royal Botanical Garden of Madrid already established in Mexico, conceived of the expedition. He wrote to the Spanish botanist Casimiro G√≥mez Ortega suggesting a botanical expedition that would serve two purposes: first to classify the natural resources of the Viceroyalty of New Spain, and second to implement new health-related procedures in the colonial territories. Coincidentally, around the same time, cosmographer Juan Bautista Mu√±oz found in the library of the Colegio Imperial de Madrid parts of the original manuscripts from an earlier botanical expedition, the Francisco Hern√°ndez Expedition of 1570‚Äì1577. G√≥mez Ortega was then charged with updating and publishing those manuscripts, and this combination of circumstances seems to have convinced the king to support a new expedition. On March 20, 1787, he issued a royal decree authorizing the expedition and providing the funds needed. Preparations Royal Botanical Garden of Madrid Preparation for the expedition began in 1787 with a series of trips by Sess√© to Santo Domingo, Puerto Rico, and Cuba, where earlier expeditions had taken place, in order to gather information from the experiences of other scientific teams. He also collaborated on some of the studies being carried out in those places, such as research in Cuba on treatment of a parasitic illness. Once he returned to the Mexican mainland, Sess√© was joined by a team of Spanish scientists and botanists chosen by the director of the Royal Botanical Garden of Madrid. This select group included Vicente Cervantes, a botany professor in New Spain; Jos√© Longinos Mart√≠nez from the Museum of Natural History; the pharmacist and botanist Juan Diego del Castillo; and botanists Jos√© Maldonado and Jos√© Mariano Moci√±o. Among the painters and illustrators who joined the expedition were two young Mexican artists, Juan de Dios Vicente de la Cerda and Atanasio Echeverr√≠a, who later had the genus Echeveria named after him; about the third artist, Pedro Oliver, not much is known. Establishment of the Royal Botanical Garden The project was envisioned to be multifaceted. A large garden of 56.25 hectares was to be established in central Mexico City to cultivate and propagate plants of New Spain that were of economic interest to the crown. Another component was to be a school to train doctors and pharmacists. A third aspect was to analyze and publicize New Spain's botanical riches. Although there was considerable indigenous knowledge of plants and their medicinal uses, the expedition did not draw on it, but rather imposed the system of classification of Carolus Linn√¶us.L√≥pez, Rick A. \\"Nature as Subject and Citizen in the Mexican Botanical Garden, 1787-1829\\" pp. 73-78 Travels outside the capital During the first year the members of the expedition only made short journeys into the countryside, besides assisting in the creation of Mexico's Botanical Garden, which opened on March 27, 1788. In May of the same year, the team began exploring the areas of Cuernavaca, Tixtla, Chilpanzingo, and Acapulco, among others. During 1790, the team explored large areas of the territories that comprised New Spain, crossing Michoac√°n, Sonora, and Apatzingan. When they reached Guadalajara, the group split in two, with Moci√±o, del Castillo, and Echeverr√≠a heading for Aguas Calientes, via √Ålamos and Tarahumara, while Sess√© traveled to the same destination via an alternative route crossing Sinaloa. When they regrouped in Aguas Calientes in 1792, they were made aware of a royal provision ordering them to travel to Nootka Island, which at the time was under litigation between Spain and Great Britain. All explorers set route for the northwest coast, except Juan del Castillo, who died of scurvy in 1793, shortly after having finished his book Plantas descritas en el viaje de Acapulco. After returning from Nootka, expedition members focused their efforts on the southern territories. They split into two teams, one led by Moci√±o that explored Mixteca and the Tabasco coast, and the other led by Sess√© that headed for Jalapa and Guaztuco. The two groups reunited in C√≥rdoba, continued to Veracruz, and returned to Mexico City via Tehuantepec and Tabasco. In March 1794, Sess√© was granted permission to extend the expedition in order to further explore Central America, specially Guatemala, Cuba, Santo Domingo, and Puerto Rico. The expedition again split into two teams, with Sess√© and Echeverr√≠a going to Cuba, while Moci√±o, de la Cerda, del Villar, and others went to Guatemala. Sess√© was finally ordered to conclude their studies and return to Spain, but it took another two years to compile and classify all the material collected during the different explorations. The team ultimately brought back some 3500 species, including 200 new genera and more than 1000 species new to science. They also created several thousand drawings and watercolors, mostly of botanical subjects, and including in many cases duplicate sets. These appear to be largely the work of Echeverr√≠a (the best of the expedition artists) and de la Cerda, though most are unsigned. The members of the exploration team finally returned to Spain at different times during 1803. Aftermath and legacy Both Sess√© and Moci√±o were honored for their work by being promoted to the Royal Academy of Medicine in Madrid in 1805. During the years following their return to Spain, Sess√© and Moci√±o published a few medical works, such as Sess√©'s writings on the eradication of yellow fever, which was prevalent in southern Spain in 1804. Sess√© underlined the importance of environmental and hygiene conditions that had been disregarded until then. Sess√© died on October 4, 1808, after which Mocin√µ‚Äîwho had proven to be one of the most active of the expedition's botanists‚Äîtried to keep interest in the project alive. However, due to his Bonapartist sympathies he was forced to flee from Spain in 1812, taking refuge in Montpellier, France. He entrusted some of the manuscripts and drawings related to the expedition to the Swiss botanist Augustin de Candolle, who had some 1200 of the illustrations copied by local artists in Geneva in early 1817 before giving the originals back to Moci√±o. In that same year, Moci√±o was finally able to return to Spain, but his health had deteriorated, and he died on May 19, 1820. Thereafter, the collection of expedition illustrations appears to have passed through many hands, beginning with Moci√±o's last doctor, before eventually winding up in the hands of a Catalan family from which Carnegie-Mellon University was able to acquire the collection in 1981. During the intervening century and a half, the whereabouts of the original illustrations was uncertain, so many publications about the expedition's work had to rely on the Geneva copies. After Sess√© and Moci√±o died, other botanists like G√≥mez Ortega, de Candolle, and Mariano Lagasca published new species based on their plants and drawings. But due largely to various political upheavals in Spain throughout the century, the bulk of the expedition's work was not published until the 1880s, nearly a century after the expedition set out. Some manuscripts from the expedition were published in Mexico in different editions between 1887 and 1894. The volume titled Plantae Novae Hispaniae focuses on plants of Mexico, while the misleadingly titled Flora Mexicana is a miscellany of species from all parts of the New World visited by the expedition. By the time any of these publications appeared, the expedition's work had been substantially superseded by the appearance, starting in 1815, of the monumental Nova Genera et Species by the German botanist Carl Sigismund Kunth. Many of the collected plants and seeds, as well as engravings and some duplicate copies of drawings and watercolors, ended up in the Royal Botanical Garden of Madrid, where today they share space with plants collected during other Spanish scientific expeditions. The set of copies made under de Candolle's oversight remains in Geneva. Tracings have been made from the Geneva set from time to time, and these have found their way into collections around the world. In 1981, the Hunt Institute for Botanical Documentation at Carnegie-Mellon University acquired many of the original botanical illustrations made during these expeditions from the nephews of a Catalan historian named Lorenzo Torner Casas. Now called the Torner Collection of Sess√© and Moci√±o Biological Illustrations, it comprises some 2000 drawings by Echeverr√≠a, de la Cerda, and Oliver. Of these, 1800 are botanical subjects while the rest range across mammals, birds, reptiles, fish, and insects.

The plan was commissioned by the Directive 2009/28/EC which required Member States of the European Union to notify the European Commission with a road map. The report describes how Finland planned to achieve its legally binding target of a 38% share of energy from renewable sources in gross final consumption of energy by 2020.  Main targets in Finland  The main outlines of the approach to increasing the use of renewable energy are set out in the Long-term Climate and Energy Strategy submitted as a report to the [Finnish Parliament] in November 2008 (VNS 6/2008 vp). On account of the general development of the economy and the structural change taking place in the forestry industry, the government supplemented these outlines in April 2010. In 2020 it is estimated that 56 TWh will be available in fuels dependent on forestry industry production (residual lyes and industrial wood waste). The estimate is based on the production of 13.7 m tons of paper and board. It is estimated that in the same year renewable energy sources yielding 77 TWh will be the subject of policy measures, as against 37 TWh in 2005. Final energy consumption in 2020 is estimated at 327 TWh.  Main incentives and laws in Finland  = Wind power = According to the Climate and Energy Strategy, wind power production will rise to 6 TWh by 2020. In order to promote wind power, there are plans to introduce a market- based feed-in tariff scheme in 2011. Wind power plants which were not covered by the feed-in tariff scheme would continue to receive a fixed subsidy of ‚Ç¨6.90 per megawatt-hour. = Wood chips and other energy from wood = The use of wood chips in CHP production and separate heat production will be increased to 13.5 million m3. The target for use of wood chips in the Climate and Energy Strategy was 12 million m3 in 2020. In order to increase the use of forest energy, a three-part aid package has been devised which will increase the competitiveness of forest energy to a level at which the required growth can happen. The support package to be presented comprises energy support for small-sized wood, a feed-in tariff to compensate for the difference in costs between wood chips and alternative fuels, and a feed-in tariff for small CHP plants. = Hydro power = Hydro power production is to be increased by around 0.5 TWh per year of average water flow, to 14 TWh in 2020. The Ministry of Employment and the Economy is drafting an amendment to the guidelines for granting support which will make it possible to grant support for plants of up to 10 MW, rather than the current maximum of 1 MW. = Small-scale use of wood = There are plans to increase the flexibility of demand on the electricity market by means of hourly metering. Hourly metering makes it possible to apply electricity tariffs which vary hour by hour. This provides incentives to use wood as a source of extra heating when the market price of electricity is high. = Heat pumps = Renewable energy production by heat pumps should be increased to 8 TWh by 2020. Measures to promote this are currently being prepared. = Transport biofuels = The use of transport biofuels is to be increased to 7 TWh by 2020. Promotion of the use biofuels would be based primarily on a distribution obligation incumbent on vendors of transport fuels. Use of biofuels will also be promoted by means of the tax reform which is being prepared. = Biogas = The use of biogas should be increased to 0.7 TWh by 2020. In order to promote CHP production using biogas (reactor plants) a market-based feed-in tariff scheme will be introduced. Use of landfill gas will be promoted using the energy subsidy. = Pellets = The target for use of pellets is 2 TWh in 2020. Measures to promote this are currently being prepared. = Recycled fuels = The target for recycled renewables is 2 TWh. The use of recycled fuels is subsidized by means of a fixed subsidy payable on the basis of electricity generation. = Solar energy = Support for solar heating and solar power generation systems will continue with the aid of the energy subsidy in accordance with current practice. In the case of one-family houses, solar heating systems are promoted through the tax system by granting an offset for the household.

Description Corymbia papuana is a tree that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has smooth white, creamy white or pale grey bark. Young plants and coppice regrowth have hairy, elliptic to egg-shaped or lance-shaped leaves that are long and wide on a short petiole. Adult leaves are arranged alternately, the same shade of dull green on both sides, lance-shaped, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils on a branched peduncle long, each branch of the peduncle with three or seven buds on pedicels long. Mature buds are pear- shaped, long and wide with a rounded operculum that sometimes has a small point in the centre. Flowering has been observed in October and November and the flowers are creamy white and perfumed. The fruit is a woody barrel-shaped or urn-shaped capsule long and wide with the valves enclosed in the fruit. Taxonomy and naming This eucalypt was first formally described in 1875 by Ferdinand von Mueller who gave it the name Eucalyptus papuana. The description was published in von Mueller's book Descriptive notes on Papuan plants from specimens collected \\"[on] the mainland of new Guines opposite to Yule-Island, about twelve miles [19 km]) distant from the shores.\\" In 1995, Ken Hill and Lawrie Johnson changed the name to Corymbia papuana.

In 2011, EuroNanoForum and Nanotech Europe joined forces to create a valuable opportunity to immerse in the multidisciplinary nanotechnology scene, to learn about the latest developments and future research challenges. The three-day event included conference, exhibition and matchmaking. EuroNanoForum 2011 gathered 1200 members of the nanotechnology community from over 50 countries. The event was supported by the European Commission and Hungarian National Innovation Fund, and was organised by the National Innovation Office in partnership with Spinverse under the auspices of the Hungarian Presidency. The EuroNanoForum 2011 conceived as a supportive action for Nanosciences, nanotechnologies, materials & new production technologies (NMP) programme of European Commission‚Äôs Seventh Framework Programme for research and technological development (FP7). The event drew together nanotechnologies which could contribute to the solution of grand challenges, including renewable energy, ageing populations, and resource efficiency. Presenters described hundreds of solutions such as nanoparticle-based cancer therapies, retinal and cochlear implants, nanomaterials for improving energy density of batteries and mass production of flexible solar cells, and materials to improve the performance and energy efficiency of electronics. A plenary presentation on the potential applications of graphene also underlined the fact that nanotechnology is being constantly expanded by new developments and discoveries. The event was also able to contribute to the ongoing discussion about the future of nanotechnology both in terms of the ongoing work to support Key Enabling Technologies and the Common Strategic Framework. An industrial panel during the closing plenary discussed ways in which public funding could contribute to the whole innovation pipeline, from research through demonstration to commercialisation and deployment. Athanasios Skouras from University of Patras received the EuroNanoForum 2011 award for the best poster presented by a young researcher. An exhibition accompanied the event, at which 60 organisations presented themselves. The best exhibitors, as voted for by attendees included NanoNext, the Netherlands nanotechnology network, the NMPTeAM network of national contact points, and Estonian electrospinning pioneer Esfil Tehno. A matchmaking event on 1 June also saw 425 meetings take place, stimulating networking for technology transfer and for new project consortia. The event hosted a venture capital session, where leading investors from Europe gave awards for start-up companies. The winner of Best Start-up Award was Nanoference from Denmark with its ambitious, disruptive business plan based on scientific discovery. Skeleton Technologies from Estonia got a special mention for a very well structured pitch. General observation from the session was that Europe is running short of venture capital money. More public funding and tax policies were expected to speed up growth of European start-ups. Research funding needs to be complemented with instruments that support also product development and business development.

The term Fujimorism or Fujimorismo (the Spanish term is also used in English language texts) denotes the policies and the political ideology of former President of Peru Alberto Fujimori as well as the personality cult built around him, his policies and his family. The ideology is defined by its support for social conservatism and neoliberal economics, as well as his opposition to political left and democratic liberalism. Presently, Alberto's children Keiko Fujimori and Kenji Fujimori have taken political strides in Peru, with Keiko's party Popular Force controlling much of the Congress of the Republic of Peru until 2020 through a system that was constitutionally drafted by her father.  History  = 1990s = Keiko Fujimori, contemporary head of Fujimorism.

In Peru in the 1980s, the \\"surprise\\" 1990 election of Fujimori to the office of the President led to a constitutional crisis in 1992, followed by \\"extraordinary measures\\" ostensibly directed against domestic terrorists. Following the 1992 crisis, the Constitution of Peru was rewritten by Fujimori and his supporters and is currently used today. This constitution would later come to benefit Alberto Fujimori's children. = 2000s = Fujimori took refuge in Japan when faced with charges of corruption in 2000. On arriving in Japan he attempted to resign his presidency via fax, but his resignation was rejected by the Congress of the Republic, which preferred to remove him from office by the process of impeachment.

Retrieved 12 December 2007. The Supreme Court upheld the decision upon his appeal. In April 2009 Fujimori was convicted of human rights violations and sentenced to 25 years in prison for his role in killings and kidnappings by the Grupo Colina death squad during his government's battle against leftist guerrillas in the 1990s. = 2010s = Following Fujimori's fall from power, his self-exile to Japan, his extradition back to Peru and his subsequent trial and imprisonment, there emerged political parties that continued to proclaim to follow the legacy of Alberto Fujimori. The most prominent of these groups that formed in the aftermath of Alberto's downfall is Popular Force (Fuerza Popular), a political party that was created and is led by the former president's daughter Keiko Fujimori, a presidential candidate in 2011 and again in 2016.As a result of the 2016 Peruvian general election, Keiko Fujimori lost the presidential race, though her Popular Force party gained control of Peru's congress while economist Pedro Pablo Kuczynski won the presidency. Shortly after the election, Fujimorist congress immediately began to politically attack President Kuczynski, beginning two impeachment proceedings against the president; a failed attempt in 2017 and another attempt in 2018. Shortly after the first impeachment vote failed, President Kuczynski pardoned Alberto Fujimori, with Kuczynski, citing Fujimori's health and age as the main reason for his pardoning. Days before the second vote was to occur, Kenji Fujimori ‚Äì who was then still part of his sister's party Popular Force ‚Äì was involved in the Kenjivideos scandal where he was seen attempting to buy the votes in favor of President Kuczynski to avoid the president's impeachment. As a result of the scandal, President Kuczynski resigned the presidency. Following this series of events, First Vice President Mart√≠n Vizcarra was sworn into the presidency by the Fujimorist-led congress. During this ceremony, some Peruvians took to the streets to protest against the government, calling for the removal of all politicians. Others have stated that the attacks against President Kuczynski was a conspiracy of the Fujimorists to gain control of Peru's political system once more. Soon after taking office, President Vizcarra made attempts to remove corruption within Peru, proposing a national referendum effort surrounding the country's legislative branch and election funding 28 July 2018. On 3 October 2018, Alberto Fujimori's pardon was overturned by a Peruvian court and a week later on 10 October 2018, Keiko Fujimori was detained by police as part of an investigation surrounding the Odebrecht scandal and money laundering allegations that involved her 2011 presidential campaign. During their majority in congress, Fujimorists \\"earned a reputation as hardline obstructionists for blocking initiatives popular with Peruvians aimed at curbing the nation‚Äôs rampant corruption\\" according to the Associated Press.  Characteristics  = Ideology = Alberto and Keiko Fujimori in 1995 Fujimorism is characterized by its social conservatism, as well as its strong opposition to groups of left and far-left that identify with socialist Marxist militancy. The principal foundations of the regime were staunch anti- communism, forceful anti-terrorist actions, pro-free market policies and disregard for political institutions.Lawson (2010), pp. 185‚Äì190. In terms of the decision-making process, a logic of closed and isolated decision-making at the top became the major characteristic of Fujimori governance.Lawson (2010), p. 186. Fujimorism is considered neoliberal economically as it minimized the role of the state functions through privatizations of public companies and by signing contracts with transnational companies to support foreign investment in large sectors. = Parties = Self-proclaimed Fujimorist parties and electoral coalitions include Cambio 90, S√≠ Cumple, Peru 2000, Alliance for the Future (2006‚Äì2010) and Popular Force (since 2010).

Biography He was born in the village of Longa, Mallabia (province of Biscay). A blacksmith by trade, he and 100 men engaged the French in guerrilla warfare, attacking the lines of communication around Pancorbo, Ordu√±a and Valdeajos. From these humble beginnings, he subsequently became the commander of the Iberian Division. In 1813 he was appointed General, later Field Marshal and in 1825, Lieutenant-General. He died in 1831 at 48 years of age. Francisco Anchia y Urquiza (10 April 1783 ‚Äì 1831) became known as Francisco de Longa because of his leadership of that village and surrounding area. He was born in Spain in the Biscay province of Longa, Mallabia and was a blacksmith before the war. Longa was first a Spanish guerrilla in 1809 with a few followers. These partidas, or groups, were encouraged by the military and civil authorities. Part of the reason for this was logistical: the bands depended upon supplies from the regular forces including arms and ammunitions. Longa‚Äôs partidas attacked lines of communications. Then he formed a battalion of 700 men by 1811 as lieutenant colonel, and he ascended to the command of the Iberian Division by 1812 as colonel. He and his forces fought in the Cantabrian mountains for four years and were familiar with the terrain, which served Wellington‚Äôs campaign well. He became commander of the Spanish Fourth Army, was made a brigadier general by 1814, lieutenant general by 1815, and then later a field marshal. Longa supported Wellington‚Äôs Anglo-Portuguese campaign of 1813. At the Battle of Vitoria, Longa‚Äôs division was part of Sir Thomas Graham‚Äôs column that ran through the mountains that were to the north. Their mission was designed to prevent the French forces from retreating east from Vitoria and they were directed to not be decisively engaged before the other columns. They faced the French Army of Portugal that had the mission of protecting the French lines of communication. They fought in the eastern area of Gammarra Mayor and sustained the highest casualties; it was named ‚ÄúGomorrah‚Äù because of the nature of devastation of the battle. Longa‚Äôs forces were able to cut the main French retreat route. Longa‚Äôs support aided the allied forces under Wellington to victory. Longa‚Äôs guerilla forces were able to aide in depriving the French forces from intelligence and instead provide intelligence of French locations to Wellington‚Äôs allied forces. Longa also achieved disruption: French internal coordination and logistics were hampered, negatively affecting both the discipline and morale of the French forces. The major achievements of the Battle of Vitoria were a greater French casualty rate than the allied forces (approximately 8,000 to 5,000 respectively) and capture of 151 of 153 French cannons and 415 French caissons (ammunition chests). Some argue that without forces like Longa‚Äôs guerillas, the French forces would not have been defeated. Within the next month, most French forces left Spain and French rule was practically ended.SPAIN REMEMBERS ITS WAR TO END ALL WARS: [1ST Edition] Nash, Elizabeth.

Formerly the National Out of School Alliance and then the Kids' Club Network, the organisation was formed in 1983 to develop after-school provision following research conducted by Bassac. 4Children ran 88 Sure Start Children‚Äôs Centres across the country, 42 nurseries, 21 out of school clubs and provides services in 24 activity centres at Royal Air Force bases in partnership with the RAF Benevolent Fund. History =National Out of School Alliance (1980-1987)= * In 1980 a number of research and pilot projects set up during the International Year of the Child in 1979 led the following year to the formation of the Out of School Project which aimed to support and encourage community-based out of school schemes and local authority provision in schools, youth clubs etc., through advice, information, training and research. Through its work with the Thames Television Telethon and the support it provided to new and existed local groups, this eventually led to the formation of the National Out of School Alliance, which became an independent organisation in 1983. The Alliance aimed to promote the care and education of children during the out of school hours and school holidays. * By 1987 National Out of School Alliance was working at the national level to advocate for the need for out of school provision and was working with the European Commission Childcare Network on its review of provision throughout Europe and on follow-up action. * The number of staff employed had doubled by 1989 and the Alliance published its Guidelines of Good Practice for Out of School Care ‚Äì the first such guidelines to be issued which were awarded the 1989 Prince of Wales award. =Kid's Club Network 1990-1999= In 1990 the Alliance was re- registered as the Kids‚Äô Clubs Network. There were 300 kids‚Äô clubs in the UK, but the organisation estimated that a total of 25,000 clubs ‚Äì one in every neighbourhood or near every primary school ‚Äì were needed. A year later the first regional offices opened in Merseyside and Wales. By 1992 10 regional development projects were operational and the number of kids‚Äô clubs had risen to 600, and in 1994 the 1000th kids‚Äô club was opened in Walsall - an important milestone for the kids‚Äô clubs movement. Kids‚Äô Clubs Network had expanded rapidly in Wales and a Welsh Head Office was established in Cardiff with a national manager heading up a team of local project managers. Tony Blair attended the opening of the 2000th Kids‚Äô Club at Sedgefield Out of School Fun Club. The first ever national campaign day - National Kids‚Äô Clubs Day was launched on 7 June 1995. Over 600 delegates attended at the 1998 Kids‚Äô Clubs Network‚Äôs biggest ever conference. The key note speaker, David Blunkett, spoke about the National Childcare Strategy to improve the provision of childcare in the UK. A In 2000, Kids‚Äô Clubs Network set up the Childcare Commission ‚Äì an independent inquiry into the future for childcare and family support. Chaired by the Harriet Harman MP, the Commission published its findings in January 2001. =4Children= In 2004 Kids‚Äô Clubs Network changed its name to 4Children. The newly named organisation was officially launched at the organisation‚Äôs annual policy conference ‚ÄòTomorrow‚Äôs World‚Äô at the Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre in Westminster. The following year the charity announced plans to expand their work by running children's centres in partnership with local government. In 2009, 4Children launched the Family Commission, an inquiry which asked 10,000 families their experiences of family life and family policy in the UK. Chaired jointly by Esther Rantzen and Anne Longfield, the report underlined the need for greater understanding in public services for the reality of family life, and successfully called for the extension of Children's Centres. =Strategic Partnership= 4Children is Department for Education's strategic partner for early years and childcare. Through The Children‚Äôs Partnership (the Government's voluntary sector partnership for children and families) 4Children brings early years and childcare organisations together, supporting the development of quality and advising Government. 4Children's Foundation Years website supports early years professionals. Developed collaboratively by professionals in the sector, for the sector, it brings together information from many sources that help support the development of children. =Campaigns= Give Me Strength Give Me Strength, was launched in May 2011. It calls on government, communities and families to take action to solve problems early to prevent family breakdown. The campaign is also calling on central and local Government to provide: A new family friendly approach to services, support for all families with specialist support for those families with complex and multiple problems, a new approach to services to put families first with practical help and support to tackle problems early as they develop Make Space for Health Make Space is the charity‚Äôs longest-running campaign, managed in conjunction with Nestle‚Äôs Healthy Kids programme, and helps to spread the message about the importance of healthy lifestyle choices among young people. The campaign looks to do this through youth centres and other out-of-school settings as young people told 4Children‚Äôs Youth Review they wanted advice about healthy living from respected adults in informal settings. As well as working directly with young people through Make Space ambassadors, the campaign provides resources for all youth workers to use for free. Shout out for a sure start The ‚ÄòShout out for a sure start‚Äô campaign was launched in February 2010 to ensure that Sure Start Children's Centres were kept at the top of the agenda through the 2010 election and beyond. A coalition of more than 30 charities and other organisations along with children‚Äôs TV character Peppa Pig backed the campaign and Sure Start funding was protected in cash terms in that autumn‚Äôs Comprehensive Spending Review. The campaign later released research on projected Sure Start Children's Centre closures and received widespread national media attention before issuing guidance for parents on how to campaign against local cuts and closures to Sure Start. Closure 4Children began a period of rapid corporate growth under its Chief Executive Anne Longfield. However, this was not matched by growing revenues and the charity ran into financial trouble. It ceased operations and entered administration on 1 September 2016. Before its financial difficulties were publicly known, Longfield was appointed Children's Commissioner for England. Many of its functions were assumed by Action for Children.

The website launched on November 1, 2011, and uses Vox Media's proprietary multimedia publishing platform Chorus. In 2013, Nilay Patel was named editor- in-chief and Dieter Bohn executive editor; Helen Havlak was named editorial director in 2017. The Verge won five Webby Awards for the year 2012 including awards for Best Writing (Editorial), Best Podcast for The Vergecast, Best Visual Design, Best Consumer Electronics Site, and Best Mobile News App.  History  = Origins = Between March and April 2011, up to nine of Engadgets writers, editors, and product developers, including editor-in-chief Joshua Topolsky, left AOL, the company behind that website, to start a new gadget site. The other departing editors included managing editor Nilay Patel and staffers Paul Miller, Ross Miller, Joanna Stern, Chris Ziegler, as well as product developers Justin Glow, and Dan Chilton. In early April 2011, Topolsky announced that their unnamed new site would be produced in partnership with sports news website SB Nation, debuting some time in the fall. Topolsky lauded SB Nation similar interest in the future of publishing, including what he described as their beliefs in independent journalism and in-house development of their own content delivery tools. Jim Bankoff of SB Nation saw an overlap in the two sites' demographics and an opportunity to expand SB Nation model. Bankoff previously worked at AOL in 2005, where he led their Engadget acquisition. Other news outlets viewed the partnership as positive for both SB Nation and Topolsky's staff, and negative for AOL's outlook. Bankoff, chairman and CEO of Vox Media (owner of SB Nation), said in a 2011 interview that though the company had started out with a focus on sports, other categories including consumer technology had growth potential for the company. Development of Vox Media's content management system (CMS), Chorus, was led by Trei Brundrett, who later became the chief operating officer for the company. = This Is My Next = Following news of his untitled partnership with SB Nation in April 2011, Topolsky announced that the Engadget podcast hosted by Patel, Paul Miller, and himself would continue at an interim site called This Is My Next. By August 2011, the site had reached 1 million unique visitors and 3.4 million page views. By October 2011, the site had 3 million unique views per month and 10 million total page views. Time listed the site in its Best Blogs of 2011, calling the prototype site \\"exemplary\\". The site closed upon The Verges launch on November 1, 2011. On June 11, 2014, The Verge launched a new section called \\"This Is My Next\\", edited by former editor David Pierce, as a buyer's guide for consumer electronics. = Launch = The Verge launched November 1, 2011, along with an announcement of a new parent company: Vox Media. According to the company, the site launched with 4 million unique visitors and 20 million pageviews. At the time of Topolsky's departure, Engadget had 14 million unique visitors. Vox Media overall doubled its unique visitors to about 15 million during the last half of 2012. The Verge had 12 former Engadget staffers working with Topolsky at the time of launch. In 2013, The Verge launched a new science section, Verge Science, with former Wired editor Katie Drummond leading the effort. Patel replaced Topolsky as editor- in-chief in mid-2014. Journalist Walt Mossberg joined The Verge editing team after Vox Media acquired Recode in 2015. By 2016, the website's advertising had shifted from display advertisements, matched with articles' contents, to partnerships and advertisements adjusted to the user. = 2016‚Äìpresent = Vox Media revamped The Verge visual design for its fifth anniversary in November 2016. The Verge logo featured a modified Penrose triangle, an impossible object. On November 1, The Verge launched version 3.0 of its news platform, offering a redesigned website along with a new logo. In September 2016, The Verge fired deputy editor Chris Ziegler after it learned that he had been working for Apple since July. Helen Havlak was promoted to the editorial director position in mid-2017. In 2017, The Verge launched \\"Guidebook\\" to host technology product reviews. In May 2018, Verge Science launched a YouTube channel, which had more than 638,000 subscribers and 30 million views by January 2019. The channel received more than 5.3 million views in November 2018 alone.  Content  = Podcasts = The Verge broadcasts a live weekly podcast, The Vergecast. The inaugural episode was November 4, 2011. It included a video stream of the hosts. A second weekly podcast was introduced on November 8, 2011. Unlike The Vergecast, The Verge Mobile Show was primarily focused on mobile phones. The Verge also launched the weekly podcast Ctrl- Walt-Delete, hosted by Walt Mossberg, in September 2015. The Verge What's Tech podcast was named among iTunes's best of 2015. The podcast Why'd You Push That Button?, launched in 2017 and co-hosted by Ashley Carman and Kaitlyn Tiffany, received a Podcast Award in the \\"This Week in Tech Technology Category\\" in 2018. = Video content =  On The Verge  On August 6, 2011, in an interview with the firm Edelman, The Verge co-founder Marty Moe announced it was launching The Verge Show, a web television series. After its launch, the show was named On The Verge. The first episode was recorded on Monday, November 14, 2011, with guest Matias Duarte. The show is a technology news entertainment show, and its format is similar to that of a late-night talk show, but it is broadcast over the Internet, not on television. The show's first episode was released on November 15, 2011. Ten episodes of On The Verge were broadcast, with the most recent episode going out on November 10, 2012. On May 24, 2013, it was announced that the show would return under a new weekly format, alongside a new logo and theme tune.  Other video content  On May 8, 2013, editor-in-chief Topolsky announced Verge Video, a website that contains the video backlog from The Verge. Circuit Breaker, a gadget blog, launched in 2016, has amassed nearly one million Facebook followers and debuted a live show on Twitter in October 2017. The blog's videos average more than 465,000 views, and Jake Kastrenakes serves as editor-in-chief, as of 2017. Also in 2016, USA Network and The Verge partnered on Mr. Robot Digital After Show, a digital aftershow for the television series Mr. Robot. In December, Twitter and Vox Media announced a live streaming partnership for The Verge programs covering the Consumer Electronics Show. The series Next Level, hosted and produced by Lauren Goode, debuted in 2017 and was recognized in the \\"Technology\\" category at the 47th annual San Francisco / Northern California Emmy Awards (2018). In August 2017, The Verge launched the web series Space Craft, hosted by science reporter Loren Grush.  Controversy  In September 2018, The Verge published the article \\"How to Build a Custom PC for Editing, Gaming or Coding\\" and uploaded a video to YouTube entitled \\"How we Built a $2000 Custom Gaming PC\\", which was criticized for numerous errors presented by the video's reporter, Stefan Etienne, including but not limited to: PSU being installed in the wrong direction, hammering the I/O shield to the case, and saying that LED‚Äôs are the main reason to buy RAM. After initially disabling comments, The Verge removed the video though reuploads exist. In February 2019, lawyers from The Verges parent company Vox Media filed a DMCA takedown notice, requesting YouTube remove videos critical of The Verges video, alleging copyright infringement. YouTube took down two of the videos, uploaded by YouTube channels BitWit and ReviewTechUSA, while applying a copyright \\"strike\\" to these two channels. YouTube reinstated the two videos and retracted the copyright \\"strikes\\" after a request from Verge editor Nilay Patel, although Patel acknowledged that he agreed with the legal argument that led to their removal. Timothy B. Lee of Ars Technica described this controversy as an example of the Streisand effect, saying that while law regarding fair use is unclear regarding this type of situation, \\"the one legal precedent ... suggests ... that this kind of video is solidly within the bounds of copyright's fair use doctrine.\\"  See also    References   External links  * Category:Computing websites Category:Internet broadcasting Category:Internet properties established in 2011 Category:Internet television Category:Mass media in New York City Category:Podcasting companies Category:Video bloggers Category:Video podcasts Category:Vox Media ","title":"The Verge"},{"id":"31998207","text":"Stjepan Periƒá (; born March 1, 1983) is a Croatian actor.

Solutions to Wahba's problem are often used in satellite attitude determination utilising sensors such as magnetometers and multi-antenna GPS receivers. The cost function that Wahba's problem seeks to minimise is as follows: : J(\\\\mathbf{R}) = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\sum_{k=1}^{N} a_k\\\\ \\\\mathbf{w}_k - \\\\mathbf{R} \\\\mathbf{v}_k \\\\^2 for N\\\\geq2 where \\\\mathbf{w}_k is the k-th 3-vector measurement in the reference frame, \\\\mathbf{v}_k is the corresponding k-th 3-vector measurement in the body frame and \\\\mathbf{R} is a 3 by 3 rotation matrix between the coordinate frames.The rotation \\\\mathbf{R} in the problem's definition transforms the body frame to the reference frame. Most publications define rotation in the reverse direction, i.e. from the reference to the body frame which amounts to \\\\mathbf{R}^T. a_k is an optional set of weights for each observation. A number of solutions to the problem have appeared in literature, notably Davenport's q-method, QUEST and singular value decomposition-based methods. This is an alternative formulation of the Orthogonal Procrustes problem (consider all the vectors multiplied by the square-roots of the corresponding weights as columns of two matrices with N columns to obtain the alternative formulation). Several methods for solving Wahba's problem are discussed by Markley and Mortari.  Solution by Singular Value Decomposition  One solution can be found using a singular value decomposition as reported by Markley 1\\\\.

He composed the cantata in Leipzig for the third day of Pentecost and first performed it on 22 May 1725.  History and words  Bach wrote the cantata in his second year in Leipzig for Pentecost Tuesday, the third day of Pentecost. In this second year Bach had composed chorale cantatas between the first Sunday after Trinity and Palm Sunday, but for Easter returned to cantatas on more varied texts, possibly because he lost his librettist. Nine of his cantatas for the period between Easter and Pentecost are based on texts of Christiana Mariana von Ziegler. Bach later assigned most of them, including this cantata, to his third annual cycle. The prescribed readings for the feast day were from the Acts of the Apostles, the Holy Spirit in Samaria (), and from the Gospel of John, the Good Shepherd (). The cantata is thematically divided in two parts, movements 1 to 4 and movements 5 to 7, but performed consecutively. Both begin with a quotation from the gospel. The first part deals with Jesus as the Good Shepherd and the sheep who hear his voice. The second part deals with those who don't hear this voice. The poet uses the term \\"\\" (deluded reason), possibly addressing the attitude of the intellectual movement \\"\\" (Age of Enlightenment). The cantata is closed with the ninth stanza of Johann Rist's hymn \\"\\". Bach first performed the cantata on 22 May 1725.  Scoring and structure  The cantata in seven movements is distinctively scored for three vocal soloists (alto, tenor and bass), a four- part choir only in the closing chorale, two trumpets, three recorders, two violins, viola, violoncello piccolo and basso continuo. The recorders give a pastorale character to the first part about the Good Shepherd. # Recitative (tenor): # Aria (alto): # Recitative (tenor): # Aria (tenor): # Recitative (alto, bass): # Aria (bass): # Chorale:  Music  The Good Shepherd, by Jean-Baptiste de Champaigne The first quotation from the Bible is sung by the tenor, like an Evangelist. This recitative, saying \\"\\" (He calls His sheep by name and leads them out), is accompanied by three recorders, an instrument with pastoral associations. The recorders also colour the first aria, a movement in 12/8 time with a text which refers to green fields. The following short recitative asks in a dissonant and dramatic way, like a lost sheep for its shepherd: \\"\\" (Where can I find you? Ah, where are you hidden?). The second aria is about the shepherd's arrival. Bach took the music from the secular cantata , although the meter of Ziegler's poetry does not fit, as if Bach had not communicated the idea of the parody with the poet. Bach transposes movement 7 from his congratulatory cantata up a minor third for tenor rather than bass voice and with an obbligato part for violoncello piccolo contrasting with the low range of the instruments he used in the first version. It is in the form of an extended da capo bourr√©e. The central recitative, movement 5, is the first movement of the cantata accompanied by the strings. It begins with the quotation from the gospel \\"\\" (But they did not grasp what it was, that He had said to them), sung by the alto as the Evangelist, and leads to an arioso on the final warning not to overhear the words of Jesus, which \\"may be to your well-being\\" (). This warning is enforced by two trumpets in the bass aria which reminds of the death of Jesus: \\"\\" (Jesus has sworn to you that He has laid low devil, death). The trumpets are silent in the middle section, dealing with the gifts of Jesus, \\"grace, sufficiency, abundant life\\" (). The aria may also be a parody, but the model is not known. The chorale is repeated from the cantata for Pentecost, . The melody of the hymn for Pentecost \\"\\" is set for four parts and three independent recorder parts, instead of strings in the earlier version, thus returning to the scoring of the beginning of the cantata.

The club is a FA Charter Standard Community Club.The Club Orpington FC History Orpington F.C. was founded in 1880 and had played in local leagues up until the 1920s before folding for unknown reasons. The current incarnation of the club was founded in 1939. From 1970 to 1998 (with a brief spell in the London Spartan League Intermediate Division from 1987 to 1991) the club played in the South London Alliance, winning the league a number of times. Since then the O's have been playing in the Kent County League, reaching the Premier Division in 2007‚Äì08 before relegation in 2009‚Äì10 left them in Division One West.

The club endured a miserable start to the season and eventually finished bottom of the league, with 24 points. Their second season, under the leadership of former goalkeeper Sean Glover, saw a massive improvement as the club finished comfortably in mid-table with a 9th-place finish. The 2013‚Äì14 season saw another step forward under Sean Glover as the club finished a respectable 5th. Byron Beard was appointed as manager of the first team for the 2014‚Äì15 with Sean Glover having resigned, Byron later stepped down during the 2015‚Äì16 season as Marc Bentz took over until the end of the 2016‚Äì17 season, each coach ensuring mid-table finishes. However, at the end of the season, financial problems led to the board resigning from the Southern Counties East Football League and dissolve their first team, with the reserves taking their place in the Kent County League. Appointing Steve Hall as manager, they were admitted to Division One West for the coming season, along with announcing a move from Green Court Sports Club to Goddington Dene, sharing with Westcombe Park RFC. An abysmal season followed, losing all of their first 10 games and conceding 75 goals in the process. Relegation followed, however the club stabilised the next season, finishing in 5th place.

The Texanita exploded and sank with the loss of 47 men, while a further life was lost on the Oswego Guardian. The accident was a catalyst for change to marine traffic separation procedures as well as oil tanker inerting. Accident The Oswego- Guardian was rounding the southern tip of Africa, fully loaded with crude oil from the Middle East, while the Texanita was in ballast, and headed in the opposite direction from Trinidad to Ras Tanura. Both ships were approximately 100,000 tons deadweight and registered in Liberia. The ships collided in dense fog off Stilbaai, near Cape Agulhas. The oil vapours in the Texanitas two empty tanks ignited, creating a massive explosion that tore the ship apart, causing it to sink in four minutes with the loss of 47 of its 50 crew; the explosion was heard away, inland from the coast. On August 22, The New York Times reported that \\"not much\\" oil had leaked from the site of the incident and serious shore pollution was not expected. Captain Salvourdas (the master of the Texanita), a crewman, Vasilos Tanos, and an unidentified Chinese messman from the Oswego Guardian were taken to a hospital in Mossel Bay. Roughly 10,000 tonnes of crude oil and fuel oil were spilled, and an estimated 500 African penguins were oiled by the slick. A United Nations resolution that would have made the use of inert gas safety systems mandatory for oil tankers, was still in draft in 1972. Experts believe that were the Texanita inerted, her fate might have been less tragic, possibly like that of the Venoil. The subsequent investigation determined that the masters of both ships failed to maintain an adequate lookout or to plot the course of the opposite ship; both ships also failed to reduce speed, despite observing one another on radar. At the time, the accident was the biggest tanker collision on record. One of the Texanitas lifeboats was found at Bunbury, Western Australia two years later. Aftermath The accident contributed to an overhaul of the international maritime traffic separation system that was in force at the time.

The project was rejected twice before being finally approved in 1783 by King Charles III of Spain, and was headed by Jos√© Celestino Mutis, a Spanish priest, who was also a botanist, mathematician and teacher. Background Jos√© Celestino Mutis Before the King sanctioned the expedition, Mutis had already proposed it on two occasions, in 1763 and 1764 respectively, but he had been ignored. However, years later, after he retired to live in Mariquita, he met Archbishop and Viceroy Antonio Caballero y G√≥ngora, who made a third proposal on his behalf that was finally accepted by the King, who named Mutis first botanist and astronomer of the botanical expedition. Preparations Since the first failed proposals Mutis had maintained regular contacts with European scientists, among which was Carl Linnaeus. When it was known that the expedition was finally under way it aroused the interest of the European scientific community at the time. On 1784 Mutis was appointed member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, and a member of the Royal Academy of Medicine. His news about American plants were eagerly awaited by botanists in Europe, keen on learning about the new species of plants. On his \\"Memorial Instructivo y Curioso de la Corte de Madrid\\" he had reported his conclusions on the medicinal uses of certain plant species of New Granada, and informed the Spanish Crown about the possibility of trading with tea leaves coming from Bogot√°, whose properties he praised. Expedition On April 29, 1783 the expedition was formally launched with a team composed by botanists Eloy Valenzuela and Fray Diego Garc√≠a, geographers Bruno Landete and Jose Camblor, painters Pablo Antonio Garcia, Francisco Javier Matiz, Anthony and Nicholas Cortez, Vicente S√°nchez, Antonio Barrionuevo, Vicente Silva, his assistant Salvador Rizo Blanco, foreman Roque Gutierrez, several collectors and a messenger. In 1790 they moved to Santafe de Bogot√° (Bogot√°) where exploration activities would continue until 1816. Mutis recruited new members, such as the botanist Francisco Antonio Zea, his nephew Sinforoso Mutis, geographer Francisco Jos√© de Caldas and chemist and zoologist Jorge Tadeo Lozano. Jos√© Antonio Candamo was hired to look after the Herbarium. In Santa Fe Mutis funded a free public School of Drawing, and following Linnaeus criteria began classifying the flora of New Granada under orders of the King who had commissioned him with the writing of the Flora de Bogota. He also created an Astronomical Observatory, considered to be the first high-learning scientific institution of Colombia. Several smaller expeditions were sent to extend geographical coverage. Among them was the one led by Francisco Jos√© de Caldas, who explored the present lands of Ecuador during four years, returning to Santa Fe in 1808 bringing a very extensive herbarium. Another member, Fray Diego Garcia, explored the Upper Magdalena Valley, between La Palma and Timana, reaching the Andaqu√≠es area and collecting many animal and geological samples. Additionally, Eloy Valenzuela, who had been deputy director of the expedition during its first year, was commissioned to Santander, although he had to prematurely retire to Bucaramanga due to health problems. On 1801 Alexander von Humboldt visited Mutis during his expedition to America, sharing quarters with him for over two months. He expressed his admiration for Mutis work and praised his botanical collection. All together Mutis led the expedition for over 25 years during which they explored some 8,000 km2. He developed a meticulous methodology that included harvesting of the samples in the field together with detailed descriptions, including data about the surrounding environment of each species and their medical or industrial uses. Mutis died on September 11, 1808, and was replaced by his nephew Sinforoso, who led the expedition until 1816. 6,000 new species were discovered and described during the expedition. As a result, 6717 drawings and 20,000 plates with 2,738 different taxa were produced. Publications Between 1793 and 1794 one of Mutis works, Arcanum of Quina, where he describes seven new species with medical and therapeutic uses, was published in a Santa Fe newspaper. 306 of Mutis's taxa were published by Linnaeus, Linneo fil., Humboldt & Bonpland, Cavanilles and certain botanists of the 20th century. On 1932 F. P. Killip, curator of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, started to study the Herbarium. In 1937 on the occasion of the bicentennial celebrations of Mutis birth, the governments of Spain and Colombia jointly produced the publication of the Flora de la Real Expedici√≥n Bot√°nica del Nuevo Reino de Granada. In 1952 began the publication of the enormous work in its entirety, that is still not completed and is expected to need more than sixty volumes, with the added requirement of having to identify the plants under the drawings according to the current nomenclature and creating a meaningful descriptive text adapted to modern times. Royal Botanical Garden of Madrid Aftermath All plates, maps, correspondence, notes and manuscripts, and all the material from Mutis museum composed of more than 24,000 dried plants, 5,000 drawings of plants by his pupils, and a collection of woods, shells, resins, minerals, and skins, were sent to Spain and was inventoried and classified on arrival to Madrid, ending up at the Royal Botanical Garden of Madrid where they have remained since, except for a small part that was sent in 1889 to the Real Academia de la Historia.

These territories were known as ennetbirgische Vogteien or \\"transmontane bailiwicks\\". History of the campaigns The Leventina was the first transalpine possession of the Swiss cantons of Uri and Obwalden, acquired in 1403. Other territories were acquired in 1418 and 1419. A first setback came with the Battle of Arbedo in 1422, where the Swiss were defeated by the Duchy of Milan, and in a treaty of 1426, the border of the duchy was moved back to the Gotthard Pass. Renewed campaigns took place in 1439, 1441 and 1447, until in 1449 the Swiss were beaten again by troops of the Golden Ambrosian Republic in the Battle of Castione. In 1466, the duke of Milan promised to grant the Leventina to the confederates, but he was slow to act on his promise, and as the Swiss were tied up in the Burgundian Wars he even formed a pact with the Burgundians. This prompted Uri to send an expedition to the Leventina, which was greeted as liberators by the local population. The Swiss tried to conquer Bellinzona as well, but after a two weeks' siege gave up and returned home. The Battle of Giornico was for once a Swiss victory, in which a force of Uri of about 175 men, with the support of about 400 men from the local population, managed to rout a Milanese army of 10,000. From this time, the Leventina was an undisputed possession of Uri, while Bellinzona remained under Milanese control. In 1487, the Valais together with Lucerne wanted to expand into the Ossola. Besieging Domodossola and marauding the valleys, the Swiss were decisively defeated by the Duchy of Milan army at the Battle of Crevola in April 1487. This was the situation at the beginning of the Italian Wars in 1494. Bellinzona was finally occupied by Uri in 1500, and officially granted to the confederacy by Louis XII of France in 1503. The Battle of Novara (1513) was a success for the Swiss Confederacy and the allied Three Leagues which secured their possessions of Locarno, Lugano, Mendrisio, Cuvio, Travaglia, Chiavenna, Bormio, Tre pievi and Valtellina. The defeat in the Battle of Marignano (1515) set an end to Swiss aspirations to further extend their possessions, but the peace of 1516 allowed them to keep their possessions, except for Ossola which was handed back to Milan. These ennetbirgische Vogteien were governed partly by the entire confederacy, partly just by Uri, Schwyz and Nidwalden (and the Leventina just by Uri) throughout the early modern period. The Valtellina, governed by the Three Leagues from 1512, was lost to Spain in the course of the B√ºndner Wirren, in 1639.

The short was released on April 17, 1954, and stars Sylvester the Cat and Hippety Hopper. The story sees Sylvester in his \\"mouse chaser\\" persona, once again confusing baby kangaroo Hippety Hopper for a giant mouse. This plot is intertwined with a reversal of the \\"belling the cat\\" fable from the Middle Ages; instead of mice wanting to avoid becoming prey to a hungry cat, here, a pack of starving alley cats hope to place a bell around the neck of the largest mouse they can find, so that upon its approach, they can ambush, kill and feast on its carcass. Sylvester comes into the picture when ‚Äì wanting to join a fraternal organization called \\"The Loyal Order of Alley Cats Mouse and Chowder Club\\" ‚Äì he is offered the opportunity for membership by the leader of the club by successfully placing the bell around the mouse's neck. Plot Sylvester has once again been \\"blackballed\\" from membership to the Loyal Order of Alley Cats Mouse and Chowder Club, a fraternity of alley cats, that he so desperately wants to join. Meanwhile, Hippety Hopper escapes from a cage at the local city zoo office and hides in a trash can. The Grand High Exalted Poobah of the Order, digging through the trash to find food, expresses his frustration aloud at not being able to find anything good to eat and says he could eat the largest mouse possible...at which time he finds Hippety. Hippety proceeds to do to him what he usually does to Sylvester, prompting the Poobah to call an emergency meeting. Meanwhile, Sylvester makes one last attempt to gain membership into the Brotherhood. The Poobah ‚Äì seeing Sylvester as a sucker ‚Äì offers to let Sylvester join if he can place the bell around the neck of the largest mouse he can find, so the cats can gang up on the mouse when they hear him coming. Soon Sylvester and Hippety quickly bump into each other and the following gags occur (all with Sylvester getting pummeled into submission): * Sylvester simply tries to place the bell around Hippety's neck, but the kangaroo kicks the cat. The bell winds up around Sylvester's neck, earning him his first beating. * The cat hides in a delivery cart, with two bells around its frame. Hippety accidentally knocks the parked wagon's handle, causing it to careen down a steep hill. The other alley cats hide to ambush what they think is the \\"giant mouse\\", but instead smash the cart (and Sylvester) flat with a huge club wielded by all of them at once. * Sylvester finds Hippety hiding in a junkyard and tries to use a teeter totter to catapult his antagonist into a wall. But Hippety will not budge (after Sylvester jumps from a stack of junk onto the board), and the cat smashes into a wall...next to a stoplight that sounds a bell-type sound when the lights change. Sylvester knows what this means and tries to hide on the stoplight...exactly where the other cats strike. In the end, Sylvester finally uses a mirror trick to get Hippety to place the bell around his neck. Sylvester is, naturally, excited about finally one-upping his long-time nemesis and calls the cats into position. But by the time the cats are ready to pounce on the baby kangaroo-mistaken-for-a-giant-mouse, Hippety is back in the city zoo truck and very happy with his new toy. The oblivious cats jump in the path of the truck, getting them all run over. Taking the opportunity, Sylvester now gets to serve as the Loyal Order's Grand High Exalted Poobah (since he is now the only active member because the others are all bandaged up) only to be \\"blackballed\\" again...this time after declaring himself leader and pounding the gavel on the table too hard.

It was set up by Tony Allen and Alexei Sayle in the summer of 1979 shortly after they had met at the newly opened London Comedy Store. They quickly recruited comedians Jim Barclay, Andy de la Tour and Pauline Melville; plus folk duos Chisholm and Stevens and Gasmask and Hopkins, and jazz salsa band Combo Passe. Echoing what was already happening in a few fringe theatres, most notably the Albany Deptford and the Half Moon Mile End, members were encouraged to open regular club nights under the name Alternative Cabaret in pub function rooms, student union bars and community venues around London. The flagship Alt Cab night was run by Allen and Sayle in the back bar of the Elgin in Ladbroke Grove, between August 1979 and May 1980. While always an adamant non-member Keith Allen was a regular guest at many Alt Cab club nights. Among other regular guests were Maggie Steed and Arnold Brown. The non-racist, non- sexist, and often radical slant to the material of Alternative Cabaret‚Äôs comedians soon became the main attraction and the focus of press interest; as a consequence the phrase Alternative Comedy became parlance and was employed to describe an emerging approach to comedy entertainment across the London fringe including The Comedy Store where audiences and performers were still often being polarised into opposing Alternative and Traditional camps. Shortly before he parted company with Alternative Cabaret, Alexei Sayle joined Tony Allen to play the Edinburgh festival in Aug 1980 with Late Night Alternative at the Heriot-Watt Theatre. From October 1980 he fronted the first season of alternative cabaret titled The Comic Strip at the Boulevard Theatre within the Raymond Revuebar, bringing in selected stand-up acts from the Comedy Store, a lineup who were soon to become television stars with The Comic Strip Presents. Meanwhile in 1981 Allen returned to the Edinburgh festival with Andy De La Tour, Jim Barclay and Pauline Melville and Alternative Cabaret at the Assembly Rooms was a noted hit. Highlights of the ensuing national tour were released as an album ‚ÄòAlternative Cabaret‚Äô on original records later that year. Having served its purpose, Alternative Cabaret then quietly disbanded and merged into what was becoming the thriving London Alternative Comedy circuit.

Over time, some of their mixed descendants intermarried with Africans, creating a tri-racial Creole culture. Census records from the year 1514 reveal that 40% of Spanish men on the island of Hispaniola had Ta√≠no wives, yet ethnohistorian Lynne Guitar writes that the Ta√≠no were declared extinct in Spanish documents in the sixteenth century, as early as 1550. Evidence suggests that some Ta√≠no men and African women inter-married and lived in relatively isolated Maroon communities in the interior of the islands, where they developed into a hybrid population of peasants with little or no interference from the Spanish authorities. In the Spanish Colony of Jamaica, known as the Colony of Santiago, Taino men and women fled to the Bastidas Mountains, later called the Blue Mountains by the English, where they intermingled with escaped African slaves, and were the ancestors of the Jamaican Maroons of the east, including those communities led by Juan de Bolas and Juan de Serras. The Maroons of Moore Town claim descent from the Taino and escaped African slaves.Agorsah, E. Kofi, \\"Archaeology of Maroon Settlements in Jamaica\\", Maroon Heritage: Archaeological, Ethnographic and Historical Perspectives, ed. E. Kofi Agorsah (Kingston: University of the West Indies Canoe Press, 1994), pp. 180‚Äì1. Scholars also note that contemporary rural Dominicans retain elements of Ta√≠no culture: linguistic features, agricultural practices, food ways, medicine, fishing practices, technology, architecture, oral history, and religious views. Often these cultural traits are looked down upon by urbanites as backward, however. Sixteen \\"autosomal\\" studies of peoples in the Spanish-speaking Caribbean and its diaspora (mostly Puerto Ricans) have shown that between 10‚Äì20% of their DNA is indigenous. Some individuals have slightly higher scores and others have lower scores or no indigenous DNA at all. A recent study of a population in eastern Puerto Rico where the majority of persons tested claimed Ta√≠no ancestry and pedigree showed that they had 61% mtDNA (distant maternal ancestry) and 0% y-chromosome DNA (distant paternal ancestry) demonstrating as expected that this is a hybrid creole population. The ancestors of the Ta√≠no originated in South America, and the Ta√≠no culture as documented developed in the Caribbean. Ta√≠no groups were in conflict with the Island Caribs of the southern Lesser Antilles. At the time of contact, the Ta√≠no were divided into several groups. Western Ta√≠no groups included the Lucayans of the Bahamas, the Ciboney of central Cuba, and the inhabitants of Jamaica. The Classic Ta√≠no lived in Hispaniola and Puerto Rico, while the Eastern Ta√≠no lived in the northern islands of the Lesser Antilles. At the time of Columbus's arrival in 1492, there were five Ta√≠no chiefdoms in Hispaniola, each led by a principal (chief), to whom tribute was paid. The Ta√≠no name for Hispaniola was (\\"land of high mountains\\"), which is the source of the name Haiti. Cuba was divided into 29 chiefdoms, many of which have given their name to modern cities, including Havana, Bataban√≥, Camag√ºey, Baracoa, and Bayamo. Ta√≠no communities ranged from small settlements to larger centers of up to 3,000 people. They may have numbered 2 million at the time of contact, and almost 3 million at the end of the 15th century. Columbus was surprised by the civility of the Ta√≠no people. Columbus stated, \\"They will give all that they do possess for anything that is given to them, exchanging things even for bits of broken crockery,\\" he noted upon meeting them in the Bahamas in 1492. \\"They were very well built, with very handsome bodies and very good faces....They do not carry arms or know them....They should be good servants.\\" The Spanish conquered various Ta√≠no chiefdoms during the late fifteenth and early sixteenth century. According to The Black Legend and some contemporary scholars such as Andr√©s Res√©ndez, warfare and harsh enslavement by the colonists decimated the population. Men were forced to work on colonial plantations and gold mines, as a result, there was no Ta√≠no left to cultivate their own crops and feed their population. Conversely, most scholars believe that diseases brought from Old World caused the majority of deaths. A smallpox epidemic in Hispaniola in 1518‚Äì1519 killed almost 90% of the surviving Ta√≠no.Alfred W. Crosby, The Columbian Exchange Westport, 1972, p. 47. The remaining Ta√≠no were intermarried with Europeans and Africans, and were incorporated into the Spanish colonies. The Ta√≠no were considered extinct at the end of the century. However, since about 1840, there have been attempts to create a quasi-indigenous Ta√≠no identity in rural areas of Cuba, the Dominican Republic, and Puerto Rico. This trend accelerated among Puerto Rican communities in the mainland United States in the 1960s.Alexandra Aikhenvald (2012) Languages of the Amazon, Oxford University Press At the 2010 U.S. census, 1,098 people in Puerto Rico identified themselves as \\"Puerto Rican Indian\\", 1,410 identified as \\"Spanish American Indian\\", and 9,399 identified as \\"Ta√≠no\\". In total, 35,856 Puerto Ricans considered themselves Native American. Terminology Reconstruction of a Ta√≠no village in Cuba A direct translation of the word \\"Ta√≠no\\" signified \\"men of the good\\". Additionally, the name was used by the indigenous people of Hispaniola to indicate that they were \\"relatives\\".Alegr√≠a, \\"Ta√≠nos\\" vol. 1, p. 345. The Ta√≠no people, or Ta√≠no culture, has been classified by some authorities as belonging to the Arawak, as their language was considered to belong to the Arawak language family, the languages of which were present throughout the Caribbean, and much of Central and South America. The early ethnohistorian Daniel Garrison Brinton called the Ta√≠no people the \\"Island Arawak\\". Nevertheless, contemporary scholars have recognized that the Ta√≠no had developed a distinct language and culture. Ta√≠no and Arawak appellations have been used with numerous and contradictory meanings by writers, travelers, historians, linguists, and anthropologists. Often they were used interchangeably; \\"Ta√≠no\\" has been applied to the Greater Antillean nation only, or including the Bahamian nations, or adding the Leeward Islands nations, or all those excluding the Puerto Rican and Leeward nations. Similarly, \\"Island Ta√≠no\\" has been used to refer to those living in the Windward Islands only, to the northern Caribbean inhabitants only, as well as to the population of the entire Caribbean. Modern historians, linguists and anthropologists now hold that the term Ta√≠no should refer to all the Ta√≠no/Arawak nations, except for the Caribs, who are not seen to belong to the same people. Linguists continue to debate whether the Carib language is an Arawakan dialect or creole language, or perhaps an individual language, with an Arawakan pidgin used for communication purposes. Rouse classifies as Ta√≠no all inhabitants of the Greater Antilles (except the western tip of Cuba), the Bahamian archipelago, and the northern Lesser Antilles. He subdivides the Ta√≠no into three main groups: Classic Ta√≠no, mostly from Haiti, Puerto Rico, and the Dominican Republic; Western Ta√≠no, or sub-Ta√≠no, for population from Jamaica, Cuba (except for the western tip), and the Bahamian archipelago; and Eastern Ta√≠no for those from the Virgin Islands to Montserrat. Origins The Guanahatabey region in relation to Ta√≠no and Island Carib groups Two schools of thought have emerged regarding the origin of the indigenous people of the Caribbean. * One group of scholars contends that the ancestors of the Ta√≠no came from the center of the Amazon Basin, and are related to the Yanomama. This is indicated by linguistic, cultural and ceramic evidence. They migrated to the Orinoco valley on the north coast. From there they reached the Caribbean by way of what is now Guyana and Venezuela into Trinidad, proceeding along the Lesser Antilles to Cuba and the Bahamian archipelago. Evidence that supports this theory includes the tracing of the ancestral cultures of these people to the Orinoco Valley and their languages to the Amazon Basin.Rouse, pp. 30‚Äì48. * The alternate theory, known as the circum-Caribbean theory, contends that the ancestors of the Ta√≠no diffused from the Colombian Andes. Julian H. Steward, who originated this concept, suggests a migration from the Andes to the Caribbean and a parallel migration into Central America and into the Guianas, Venezuela, and the Amazon Basin of South America. Ta√≠no culture as documented is believed to have developed in the Caribbean. The Ta√≠no creation story says that they emerged from caves in a sacred mountain on present-day Hispaniola.Rouse, p. 16. In Puerto Rico, 21st century studies have shown a high proportion of people having Amerindian mtDNA. Of the two major haplotypes found, one does not exist in the Ta√≠no ancestral group, so other Native American people are also part of this genetic ancestry. Culture Dujo, a wooden ceremonial chair crafted by Ta√≠nos Ta√≠no society was divided into two classes: naborias (commoners) and nita√≠nos (nobles). These were governed by male chiefs known as caciques, who inherited their position through their mother's noble line. The nita√≠nos functioned as sub-caciques in villages, overseeing naborias work. Caciques were advised by priests/healers known as bohiques. Caciques enjoyed the privilege of wearing golden pendants called guan√≠n, living in square boh√≠os, instead of the round ones of ordinary villagers, and sitting on wooden stools to be above the guests they received. Bohiques were extolled for their healing powers and ability to speak with deities. They were consulted and granted the Ta√≠no permission to engage in important tasks. The Ta√≠no had a matrilineal system of kinship, descent, and inheritance. When a male heir was not present, the inheritance or succession would go to the oldest male child of the sister of the deceased. The Ta√≠no had avunculocal post-marital residence, meaning a newly married couple lived in the household of the maternal uncle. He was more important in the lives of his niece's children than their biological father; the uncle introduced the boys to men's societies. Some Ta√≠no practiced polygamy. Men, and sometimes women, might have two or three spouses. A few caciques had as many as 30 wives. Dominican folk artist Irka Mateo The Ta√≠no women were highly skilled in agriculture. The people depended on it, but the men also fished and hunted. They made fishing nets and ropes from cotton and palm. Their dugout canoes (kanoa) were made in various sizes, which could hold from 2 to 150 people. An average-sized canoe would hold about 15‚Äì20 people. They used bows and arrows for hunting, and developed the use of poisons on their arrowheads. Ta√≠no women commonly wore their hair with bangs in front and longer in back, and they occasionally wore gold jewelry, paint, and/or shells. Ta√≠no men and unmarried women were usually naked. After marriage, women wore a small cotton apron, called a nagua. The Ta√≠no lived in settlements called yucayeques, which varied in size depending on the location. Those in Puerto Rico and Hispaniola were the largest, and those in the Bahamas were the smallest. In the center of a typical village was a central plaza, used for various social activities such as games, festivals, religious rituals, and public ceremonies. These plazas had many shapes, including oval, rectangular, narrow, and elongated. Ceremonies where the deeds of the ancestors were celebrated, called areitos, were performed here.Rouse, p. 15. Often, the general population lived in large circular buildings (bohios), constructed with wooden poles, woven straw, and palm leaves. These houses, built surrounding the central plaza, could hold 10‚Äì15 families each.Alegr√≠a, \\"Tainos\\" p. 346. The cacique and his family lived in rectangular buildings (caney) of similar construction, with wooden porches. Ta√≠no home furnishings included cotton hammocks (hamaca), sleeping and sitting mats made of palms, wooden chairs (dujo or duho) with woven seats, platforms, and cradles for children. Caguana Ceremonial ball court (batey), outlined with stones The Ta√≠no played a ceremonial ball game called batey. Opposing teams had 10 to 30 players per team and used a solid rubber ball. Normally, the teams were composed of men, but occasionally women played the game as well.Alegr√≠a (1951), p.348. The Classic Ta√≠no played in the village's center plaza or on especially designed rectangular ball courts called batey. Games on the batey are believed to have been used for conflict resolution between communities. The most elaborate ball courts are found at chiefdom boundaries. Often, chiefs made wagers on the possible outcome of a game. Ta√≠no spoke an Arawakan language and used an early form of writing Proto-writing in the form of petroglyph. Some words that they used, such as barbacoa (\\"barbecue\\"), hamaca (\\"hammock\\"), kanoa (\\"canoe\\"), tabaco (\\"tobacco\\"), yuca, batata (\\"sweet potato\\"), and jurac√°n (\\"hurricane\\"), have been incorporated into Spanish and English. For warfare, the men made wooden war clubs, which they called a macana. It was about one inch thick and was similar to the coco macaque.  Cacicazgo/society  Smithsonian 1901 map of Puerto Rico caciques The Ta√≠no were the most culturally advanced of the Arawak Group to settle in what is now Puerto Rico. Individuals and kinship groups that previously had some prestige and rank in the tribe began to occupy the hierarchical position that would give way to the cacicazgo. The Ta√≠no founded settlements around villages and organized their chiefdoms, or cacicazgos, into a confederation. The Taino society, as described by the chroniclers, was composed of four social classes: the cacique, the nita√≠nos, the behiques, and the naborias. According to archeological evidence, the Ta√≠no islands were able to support an enormous number of people for approximately 1,500 years. Every individual living in the Ta√≠no society had a task to do. For the Ta√≠nos, it was very important that everyone living in their islands ate properly. They followed a very efficient nature harvesting and agricultural production system. Either people were hunting, searching for food, or doing other productive tasks. Tribal groups settled in villages under a chieftain, known as cacique, or cacica if the ruler was a woman. Many women the Spaniards called cacicas were not always rulers in their own right, but were mistakenly recognized as such because they were the wives of caciques. Chiefs were chosen from the nita√≠nos and generally obtained their power from the maternal line. Male rulers were more likely to be succeeded by his sister's children than his own, unless their mother's lineage allowed them to succeed in their own right. The chiefs had both temporal and spiritual functions. They were expected to ensure the welfare of the tribe and to protect it from harm from both natural and supernatural forces. They were also expected to direct and manage the production process. The caciques power came from the number of villages he controlled and was based on a network of alliances related to family, matrimonial and ceremonial ties. These alliances showed unity of the indigenous communities in a territory that would get together as a defensive strategy to face external threats, like the attacks by the Caribs on communities in Puerto Rico. Polygamy allowed the cacique to have women in different localities, thus extending his power. The cacique carried, as a symbol of his hierarchy, a guan√≠n of South American origin made of an alloy of gold and copper. This symbolized the first Ta√≠no mythical cacique Anacacuya that means star of the center or central spirit. In addition to the guan√≠n, the cacique used other artifacts and adornments that served to identify it. Some examples are tunics of cotton and feathers, crowns and masks or \\"guaizas\\" of cotton with feathers; colored stones, shells or gold;cotton woven belts; and necklaces of snail beads or stones with small masks of gold or other material. left Under the cacique there social organization was composed of two tiers: The nita√≠nos at the top and the naborias at the bottom. The nita√≠nos were considered the nobles of the tribes. They were the warriors and family of the cacique. Advisers that assisted in the mundane matters of assigning and supervising communal work, planting and harvesting crops, and keeping peace among the village's inhabitants, were selected from among the nita√≠nos. The naborias were simply working peasants of the lower class. The behiques were priests who represented religious beliefs. Behiques dealt with negotiating with angry or indifferent gods as the accepted lords of the spiritual world. The behiques were expected to communicate with the gods, to soothe them when they were angry, and to intercede on the tribe's behalf. It was their duty to cure the sick, heal the wounded, and interpret the will of the gods in ways that would satisfy the expectations of the tribe. Before carrying out these functions, the behiques performed certain cleansing and purifying rituals, such as fasting for several days and inhaling sacred tobacco snuff. Food and agriculture Cassava, starchy (yuca) roots, the Ta√≠nos' main crop Ta√≠no staples included vegetables, fruit, meat, and fish. There were no large animals native to the Caribbean, but they captured and ate small animals, such as hutias and other mammals, earthworms, lizards, turtles, and birds. Manatees were speared and fish were caught in nets, speared, trapped in weirs, or caught with hook and line. Wild parrots were decoyed with domesticated birds, and iguanas were taken from trees and other vegetation. The Ta√≠no stored live animals until they were ready to be consumed: fish and turtles were stored in weirs, hutias and dogs were stored in corrals.Rouse, p. 13. River Saliente in Jayuya, Puerto Rico Because of the lack of large game, the Ta√≠no people became very skilled fishermen. One method was to hook a remora, also known as a suckerfish, to a line secured to a canoe and wait for the fish to attach itself to a larger fish or even a sea turtle. Once this happened, some of the Ta√≠no would dive into the water to assist in retrieving the catch. Another method used by the Ta√≠nos was to shred the stems and roots of poisonous senna plants and throw them into nearby streams or rivers. Upon eating the bait, the fish were stunned, allowing boys time enough to collect them. This toxin did not affect the edibility of the fish. The Ta√≠no also collected mussels and oysters in shallow waters within the exposed mangrove roots. Some young boys hunted waterfowl from flocks that \\"darkened the sun\\", according to Christopher Columbus. Ta√≠no groups in the more developed islands, such as Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, and Jamaica, relied more on agriculture (farming and other jobs). Fields for important root crops, such as the staple yuca, were prepared by heaping up mounds of soil, called conucos. This improved soil drainage and fertility as well as delaying erosion, allowed for longer storage of crops in the ground. Less important crops such as corn were raised in simple clearings created by slash and burn technique. Typically, conucos were three feet high and nine feet in circumference and were arranged in rows.Rouse, p.12. The primary root crop was yuca or cassava, a woody shrub cultivated for its edible and starchy tuberous root. It was planted using a coa, a kind of hoe made completely from wood. Women processed the poisonous variety of cassava by squeezing it to extract the toxic juices. Then they would grind the roots into flour for baking bread. Batata (sweet potato) was the next most important root crop. Contrary to mainland practices, corn was not ground into flour and baked into bread, but was cooked and eaten off the cob. Corn bread becomes moldy faster than cassava bread in the high humidity of the Caribbean. Corn also was used to make an alcoholic beverage known as chicha. The Ta√≠no grew squash, beans, peppers, peanuts, and pineapples. Tobacco, calabashes (West Indian pumpkins), and cotton were grown around the houses. Other fruits and vegetables, such as palm nuts, guavas, and Zamia roots, were collected from the wild. Spirituality Ta√≠no zem√≠ sculpture Walters Art Museum Ta√≠no spirituality centered on the worship of zem√≠s. A zem√≠ is a spirit or ancestor. The major Ta√≠no zemis are Atabey and her son, Y√∫cahu. Atabey, was the zemi of the moon, fresh waters, and fertility. Other names for her include Atabei, Atabeyra, Atabex, and Guimazoa. The Ta√≠nos of Quisqueya (Dominican Republic) called her son, \\"Yucah√∫ Bagua Maorocot√≠\\", which means \\"White Yuca, great and powerful as the sea and the mountains\\". He was the spirit of cassava, the zemi of cassava ‚Äì the Ta√≠nos' main crop ‚Äì and the sea. Guabancex was the non-nurturing aspect of the zemi Atabey who had control over natural disasters. She is identified as the goddess of the hurricanes or as the zemi of storms. Guabancex had twin sons: Guataub√°, a messenger who created hurricane winds, and Coatrisquie, who created floodwaters.Rouse, p. 121. Iguanabo√≠na was the goddess of the good weather. She also had twin sons: Boinayel, the messenger of rain, y Marohu, the spirit of clear skies. The minor Ta√≠no zemis related to the growing of cassava, the process of life, creation, and death. Baibrama was a minor zemi worshiped for his assistance in growing cassava and curing people from its poisonous juice. Boinayel and his twin brother M√°rohu were the zemis of rain and fair weather, respectively.Rouse, p. 119. Maquetaurie Guayaba or Maketaori Guayaba was the zemi of Coaybay or Coabey, the land of the dead. Opiyelguabir√°n', a dog-shaped zemi, watched over the dead. Demin√°n Caracaracol, a male cultural hero from whom the Ta√≠no believed themselves to be descended, was worshipped as a zem√≠. Macocael was a cultural hero worshipped as a zemi, who had failed to guard the mountain from which human beings arose. He was punished by being turned into stone, or a bird, a frog, or a reptile, depending on interpretation of the myth. Zem√≠, a physical object housing a zemi, spirit, or ancestor Lombards Museum Zem√≠ was also the name the people gave to their physical representations of the Zemis, whether objects or drawings. They were made in many forms and materials and have been found in a variety of settings. The majority of zem√≠s were crafted from wood, but stone, bone, shell, pottery, and cotton were used as well.Rouse, pp. 13, 118. Zem√≠ petroglyphs were carved on rocks in streams, ball courts, and on stalagmites in caves. Cem√≠ pictographs were found on secular objects such as pottery, and on tattoos. Yucah√∫, the zemi of cassava, was represented with a three-pointed zem√≠, which could be found in conucos to increase the yield of cassava. Wood and stone zem√≠s have been found in caves in Hispaniola and Jamaica.Rouse, p. 118. Cem√≠s are sometimes represented by toads, turtles, fish, snakes, and various abstract and human-like faces. Cohoba Spoon, 1200‚Äì1500 Brooklyn Museum Rock petroglyph overlaid with chalk in the Caguana Indigenous Ceremonial Center in Utuado, Puerto Rico Some zem√≠s are accompanied by a small table or tray, which is believed to be a receptacle for hallucinogenic snuff called cohoba, prepared from the beans of a species of Piptadenia tree. These trays have been found with ornately carved snuff tubes. Before certain ceremonies, Ta√≠nos would purify themselves, either by inducing vomiting (with a swallowing stick) or by fasting.Rouse, p. 14. After communal bread was served, first to the zem√≠, then to the cacique, and then to the common people, the people would sing the village epic to the accompaniment of maraca and other instruments. One Ta√≠no oral tradition explains that the Sun and Moon come out of caves. Another story tells of people who once lived in caves and only came out at night, because it was believed that the Sun would transform them. The Ta√≠no believed they were descended from the union of the cultural hero Demin√°n Caracaracol and a female turtle. The origin of the oceans is described in the story of a huge flood that occurred when a father murdered his son (who was about to murder the father). The father put his son's bones into a gourd or calabash. When the bones turned into fish, the gourd broke, and all the water of the world came pouring out. Ta√≠nos believed that Jupias, the souls of the dead, would go to Coaybay, the underworld, and there they rest by day. At night they would assume the form of bats and eat the guava fruit. Spaniards and Ta√≠no Columbus and the crew of his ship were the first Europeans to encounter the Ta√≠no people, as they landed in The Bahamas on October 12, 1492. After their first interaction, Columbus described the Ta√≠nos as a physically tall, well-proportioned people, with a noble and kind personality. In his diary, Columbus wrote: At this time, the neighbors of the Ta√≠no were the Guanahatabeys in the western tip of Cuba, the Island-Caribs in the Lesser Antilles from Guadeloupe to Grenada, and the Calusa and Ais nations of Florida. Guanahan√≠ was the Ta√≠no name for the island that Columbus renamed as San Salvador (Spanish for \\"Holy Savior\\"). Columbus called the Ta√≠no \\"Indians\\", a reference that has grown to encompass all the indigenous peoples of the Western Hemisphere. A group of Ta√≠no people accompanied Columbus on his return voyage to Spain. On Columbus' second voyage to their culture, he began to require tribute from the Ta√≠no in Hispaniola. According to Kirkpatrick Sale, each adult over 14 years of age was expected to deliver a hawks bell full of gold every three months, or when this was lacking, twenty-five pounds of spun cotton. If this tribute was not brought, the Spanish cut off the hands of the Ta√≠no and left them to bleed to death.Kirkpatrick Sale, \\"The Conquest of Paradise\\", p. 155, These cruel practices inspired many revolts by the Ta√≠no and campaigns against the Spanish ‚Äî some being successful, some not. In 1511, several caciques in Puerto Rico, such as Ag√ºeyban√° II, Arasibo, Hayuya, Jumacao, Urayo√°n, Guarionex, and Orocobix, allied with the Carib and tried to oust the Spaniards. The revolt was suppressed by the Indio-Spanish forces of Governor Juan Ponce de Le√≥n. Hatuey, a Ta√≠no chieftain who had fled from Hispaniola to Cuba with 400 natives to unite the Cuban natives, was burned at the stake on February 2, 1512. In Hispaniola, a Ta√≠no chieftain named Enriquillo mobilized more than 3,000 Ta√≠no in a successful rebellion in the 1520s. These Ta√≠no were accorded land and a charter from the royal administration. Despite the small Spanish military presence in the region, they often used diplomatic divisions and, with help from powerful native allies, controlled most of the region. In exchange for a seasonal salary, religious and language education, the Ta√≠no were required to work for Spanish and Indian land owners. This system of labor was part of the encomienda. Women Ta√≠no society was based on a matrilineal system and descent was traced through the mother. Women lived in village groups containing their children. The men lived separately. Because of this Ta√≠no women had extensive control over their lives, their co-villagers, and their bodies.Saunders, Nicholas J. Peoples of the Caribbean: An Encyclopedia of Archeology and Traditional Culture. Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-CLIO, 2005. Web. Since they lived separately from men, they were able to decide when they wanted to participate in sexual contact. This social organization partially shaped the views of conquistadors who came in contact with Ta√≠no culture. They reportedly perceived women as \\"macha women\\" who had strong control over the men. Ta√≠no women played an important role in intercultural interaction between Spaniards and the Ta√≠no people. When Ta√≠no men were away fighting intervention from other groups, women assumed the roles of primary food producers or ritual specialists.Dale, Corrine H., and J. H. E. Paine. Women on the Edge: Ethnicity and Gender in Short Stories by American Women. New York: Garland Pub., 1999. Web. Women seem to have participated in all levels of the Ta√≠no political hierarchy, occupying roles as high up as being cazicas.Taylor, Patrick, and Frederick I. Case. The Encyclopedia of Caribbean Religions Volume 1: A-L; Volume 2: M-Z. Baltimore: U of Illinois, 2015. Web. Chapter title Ta√≠nos. Potentially, this meant Ta√≠no women could make important choices for the village and could assign tasks to tribe members. There is evidence that suggests that the women who were wealthiest among the tribe collected crafted goods that they would then use for trade or as gifts. Despite women being seemingly independent in Ta√≠no society, during the era of contact Spaniards took Ta√≠no women as an exchange item, putting them in a non-autonomous position. Dr. Chanca, a physician who traveled with Christopher Columbus, reported in a letter that Spaniards took as many women as they possibly could and kept them as concubines.Hotep, Amon. \\"Women.\\" Race and History.com  TAINO  Women. N.p., n.d. Web. 29 Nov. 2016. Some sources report that, despite women being free and powerful before the contact era, they became the first commodities up for Spaniards to trade, or often, steal. This marked the beginning of a lifetime of kidnapping and abuse of Ta√≠no women.Sloan, Kathryn A. Women's Roles in Latin America and the Caribbean. Santa Barbara, CA: Greenwood, 2011. Web. Depopulation Early population estimates of Hispaniola, probably the most populous island inhabited by Ta√≠nos, range from 100,000 to 1,000,000 people. The maximum estimates for Jamaica and Puerto Rico are 600,000 people. The Spanish priest and defender of the Ta√≠no Bartolom√© de las Casas (who had lived in Santo Domingo) wrote in his 1561 multi-volume History of the Indies: Researchers today doubt Las Casas' figures for the pre- contact levels of the Ta√≠no population, considering them an exaggeration. For example, Anderson C√≥rdova estimates a maximum of 500,000 people inhabiting the island. They had no resistance to Old World diseases, notably smallpox.Citation Needed The encomienda system brought many Ta√≠no to work in the fields and mines in exchange for Spanish protection, education, and a seasonal salary. Under the pretense of searching for gold and other materials, many Spaniards took advantage of the regions now under control of the anaborios and Spanish encomenderos to exploit the native population by seizing their land and wealth. Historian David Stannard characterizes the encomienda as a genocidal system which \\"had driven many millions of native peoples in Central and South America to early and agonizing deaths.\\" It would take some time before the Ta√≠no revolted against their oppressors ‚Äî both Indian and Spanish alike ‚Äî and many military campaigns before Emperor Charles V eradicated the encomienda system as a form of slavery. Diseases obviously had a lot to do with the destruction of the indigenous population, but forced labor was also one of the chief reasons as to why the population decimated. The first man to introduce this forced labor among the Ta√≠nos was leader of the European colonization of Puerto Rico, Ponce de Le√≥n. This forced labor eventually led to the Ta√≠no rebellions, in which the Spaniards responded with violent military expeditions known as cabalgadas. The purpose of the military expedition was to capture the indigenous peoples. This violence by the Spaniards was a reason why there was a decline in the Ta√≠no population since it forced many of these people to emigrate to other islands and the mainland. In thirty years, between 80% and 90% of the Ta√≠no population died.\\"La trag√©die des Ta√Ønos\\", in L'Histoire n¬∞322, July‚ÄìAugust 2007, p. 16. Because of the increased number of people (Spanish) on the island, there was a higher demand for food. Ta√≠no cultivation was converted to Spanish methods. In hopes of frustrating the Spanish, some Ta√≠nos refused to plant or harvest their crops. The supply of food became so low in 1495 and 1496 that some 50,000 died from famine. Historians have determined that the massive decline was due more to infectious disease outbreaks than any warfare or direct attacks. By 1507, their numbers had shrunk to 60,000. Scholars believe that epidemic disease (smallpox, influenza, measles, and typhus) was an overwhelming cause of the population decline of the indigenous people, and also attributed a \\"large number of Ta√≠no deaths...to the continuing bondage systems\\" that existed. Academics, such as historian Andr√©s Res√©ndez of the University of California, Davis, assert that disease alone does not explain the total destruction of indigenous populations of Hispaniola. While the populations of Europe rebounded following the devastating population decline associated with the Black Death, there was no such rebound for the indigenous populations of the Caribbean. He concludes that, even though the Spanish were aware of deadly diseases such as smallpox, there is no mention of them in the New World until 1519, meaning perhaps they didn't spread as fast as initially believed, and that unlike Europeans, the indigenous populations were subjected to slavery, exploitation, and forced labor in gold and silver mines on an enormous scale. Res√©ndez says that \\"slavery has emerged as a major killer\\" of the indigenous people of the Caribbean. Anthropologist Jason Hickel estimates that a third of indigenous workers died every six months from lethal forced labor in these mines.  Ta√≠no descendants today  Histories of the Caribbean commonly describe the Taino as extinct, killed off by disease, slavery, and war with the Spaniards. Some present-day residents of the Caribbean self-identify as Taino, and claim that Taino culture and identity have survived into the present. Groups advocating this point of view are known as Neo-Ta√≠nos, and are established in the Puerto Rican communities located in New Jersey and New York, as well. A few Neo-Ta√≠no groups are pushing not only for recognition, but respect for their cultural assets. A genetic study published in 2018 provided some evidence of a present-day Caribbean population being related to the Ta√≠nos. DNA was extracted from a tooth of a 1,000-year-old female skeleton found in a cave in Lucaya, Bahamas, and the genetic results show that she is most closely related to present-day Arawakan speakers from northern South America. The study's authors write that this demonstrates continuity between pre-contact populations and present-day Latino populations in the Caribbean. Today, Ta√≠nos from places such as the diaspora in the United States and the islands, are gathering together. As of 2006, there were a couple of dozen activist Taino organizations from Florida to Puerto Rico and California to New York with growing memberships numbering in the thousands. These efforts are known as the \\"Ta√≠no restoration\\", a revival movement for Ta√≠no culture that seeks official recognition of the survival of the Ta√≠no people. In Puerto Rico, the history of the Ta√≠no is being taught in schools and children are encouraged to celebrate the culture and identity of Ta√≠no through dance, costumes and crafts. Mart√≠nez Cruzado, a geneticist at the University of Puerto Rico at Mayag√ºez said celebrating and learning about their Ta√≠no roots is helping Puerto Ricans feel connected to one another. While the scholar Yolanda Mart√≠nez-San Miguel sees the development of the Neo-Taino movement in Puerto Rico as a useful counter to the domination of the island by the United States and the Spanish legacies of island society, she also notes that the Neo-Taino movement in Puerto Rico \\"could be seen as a useless anachronistic reinvention of a 'Boricua coqui' identity.

The organization also seeks to ensure that accounting academics make the maximum contribution to development of excellent accounting standards. Foundation The origins of the IAAER can be traced back to meetings of the International Congresses on Accounting that started in 1904. The International Federation of Accountants began holding separate International Conferences on Accounting Education in 1962. IAAER was founded in 1984 to serve as a co-host with the Japanese Accounting Association for the sixth of these conferences, which was scheduled to be held in Kyoto, Japan in 1987. Its organization was defined at a meeting in Toronto, Canada on 17 August 1984, with representatives from Australia, Canada, Japan, Netherlands, Germany, the United States and the United Kingdom. Membership IAAER offers institutional, university, individual, and student memberships. As of 2009, IAAER had about 50 institutional members, including professional accounting bodies such as the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and accounting academic organizations such as the American Accounting Association. In 2009, IAAER announced that all members would have access to eIFRS, an online repository of material about International Financial Reporting Standards. Activities IAAER contributes to international accounting and auditing standards through relationships with various international bodies, bringing a research-based academic viewpoint. Specifically, IAAER is represented on the International Accounting Education Standards Board (IAESB) of the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC), the Education Advisory Group of the International Accounting Standards Committee Foundation and the Standards Advisory Council of the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). IAAER commissions research projects to develop improvements to international accounting and educational standards, and promotes development of accounting skills by working with local and regional bodies and organizing conferences and workshops. For example, in 2006 IAAER and KPMG invited research proposals under the Defining, Recognizing and Measuring Liabilities Research Program. In November 2007, IAAER and the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA) announced that they were providing up to five research grants of up to $25,000, funded by ACCA, to support the work of the IAESB. In July 2010 IAAER and ACCA again issued a call for proposals for research supporting development of international standards of education. The IAAER sponsors and coordinates the World Congress of Accounting Educators and Researchers, which is held every four years in conjunction with IFAC World Congress.

Leading apiarist While living in rural Annapolis, Missouri, Holekamp developed an interest in apiology and began beekeeping. He continued the hobby upon his return to St. Louis, and Holekamp became among the first to engage in urban apiculture in the United States. Concerned about the spread of foulbrood disease among bees in Missouri, Holekamp proposed a bill and successfully lobbied both houses of the Missouri State Legislature to pass a law to address the epidemic. When the measure was unexpectedly vetoed by Governor Joseph W. Folk in 1908, Holekamp personally appealed to the Governor and convinced him to change his mind. Holekamp's bill created the state office of bee inspector, making Missouri among the first states to regulate the commercial beekeeping industry.Dadant, C.P. American Bee Journal. June 1922, p. 267.

In 1961, Kayashima released 45,000 O. sertatus spiders into a Cryptomeria forest in Japan (in a test plot) and noted a 53% reduction in damage by Contarinia inouyei.Kayashima 1961 Other studies in India (Sharma & Sarup, 1979; Rao et al., 1981) have noted similar results.Young & Lockley 1985 However, some studies note that O. salticus (and other Oxyopids) also predate beneficial insects (e.g., bees and other pollinators), so their importance in pest control is somewhat questioned.Weems 2001 Gallery File:Oxyopes salticus Kaldari 01.jpgO. salticus male.

This is why plaintiffs try to name all possible parties that might be blamed when filing a lawsuit.

He was the Perpetual Curate of All Hallows Staining church in London, where Mount Brown compiled large parts of his catalogue. The church was believed to be the one mentioned by Charles Dickens in Dombey & Son. Alumni Cantabrigienses, philatelic sources, and Stainforth's death certificate all give his forenames as Francis John. An 1894 work by the Rev. A. Povah records his name incorrectly as Frederick J. Early life and military career Baptized on 14 December 1797, at St Peter-le-Poer in the City of London, Stainforth was the son of Richard Stainforth, by his marriage to Maria, the eldest child of Sir Francis Baring, 1st Baronet, of Devon. In 1817 he joined the Bengal Cavalry as a Cadet and by 1825 had been promoted to Captain. Resigning his commission in 1827, he was admitted to St John's College, Cambridge, where he graduated BA in 1830 and was promoted to MA in 1833.'Stainforth, Francis John', in John Venn, Alumni Cantabrigienses, vol. 4, p. 5 Stainforth had an older brother, George, born in 1796, who was educated at Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge, and was President of the Cambridge Union Society in 1816.

In 1841 he became Curate of Camden Chapel, Camberwell, in 1846 Curate of St Pancras, London, in 1852 Perpetual Curate of All Hallows', Staining. In October 1838 he married secondly Elizabeth, daughter of Edward Southwell Ruthven. Origins of the Royal Philatelic Society Stainforth met at the Rectory in 9 Mark Lane, which adjoined the church, on Saturday afternoons with a group of like-minded collectors to pool their knowledge. Apart from Mount Brown, these included Dr. Charles W. Viner, Henry Haslett, Frederick Philbrick, William Hughes-Hughes and Sir Daniel Cooper.The Stamp Lover, Vol. 1, No. 1, June 1908, pp. 5-6.

Standish, Wigan: 2008, p. 1362. The group that met at the church were thought to be the most serious British collectors of the day and have been credited with being the nucleus that eventually formed The Philatelic Society, London, which subsequently became the Royal Philatelic Society London, the oldest philatelic society in the world.

It uses GPS as its primary mode of guidance complemented by an advanced Inertial Navigation System and a radar-based Terrain Referenced Navigation system, allowing the missile to skim the terrain during its flight in order to evade local defence systems. According to the developer, it features advanced geometry and aerodynamics over similar missile systems, as well as lightweight composite components that minimize the radar cross-section of the missile. A terminal stage infrared imager detects the individual target by matching its signature with a pre-loaded database of similar targets allowing for precision strike. It can also be used to provide image-based midcourse navigation by taking snapshots of waypoints and comparing them against predicted position to update the navigation system. Thus, if GPS capability is denied or degraded, the missile can follow its waypoints using infrared based terrain updates.

The game features four game modes: \\"Jedi Destiny\\", the primary game mode; podracing; Rancor Rampage; and Galactic Dance-off. In Jedi Destiny, players assume the role models of Jedi Padawans as they wield their lightsabers and use the Force to attack enemies mostly from the prequel trilogy using gestures. Podracing is a race-based game mode, Rancor Rampage is a destruction-based game mode, and Galactic Dance-off is a dance-based game mode similar to the Dance Central series. Microsoft Studios had planned to make a Star Wars game that utilizes the Kinect since the early development of the motion-sensing system. The game was formally announced at E3 2011 and released worldwide on April 3, 2012. It was the last game to be published by LucasArts. Craig Derrick served as lead producer on the game. Kinect Star Wars received generally mixed reviews, with reviewers often praising the game's art and presentation but criticizing the perceived underdeveloped gameplay, weak writing, and inaccurate controls. Gameplay Kinect Star Wars features four subgames. In its primary mode, known as Jedi Destiny: Dark Side Rising, players take control of one of multiple Jedi Padawans. Using the Kinect, the player uses their hands to wield a lightsaber in combat. Players also can lift and throw objects with the Force using specific gestures. The story takes place during the prequel trilogy timeline of the Star Wars universe, beginning shortly after Star Wars: Episode I ‚Äì The Phantom Menace and concluding with the events of Star Wars: Episode III ‚Äì Revenge of the Sith. Body movement to control vehicles in specific sections of this mode. A second Jedi-centric mode, Duels of Fate, allows players to experience one-on-one duels with characters from the Jedi Destiny campaign as well as famous Star Wars villains such as Darth Vader. The game's podracing utilizes the Kinect to simulate the dual throttle controls on podracers. Players extend arms fully to operate at full speed, and retract their arm to throttle back on one or both engines. Multiple courses are offered. Rancor Rampage, the game's third mode, allows players to control one of multiple species of rancor which are let loose in various Star Wars locales. Arm movements synchronize between the player and their rancor, and players can execute special attacks in this destruction- based game mode. The final game mode in Kinect Star Wars is Galactic Dance- off. Here players control one of several famous Star Wars characters through the use of the Kinect. Gameplay is a combination of Dance Central series and Just Dance in which players must dance in synchronization with the on-screen character. Cues to upcoming dance moves are shown to the player to ensure they can stay in synchronization with the character. The song selection consists of parodies with title and lyrics rewritten in a Star Wars theme. For example, Gwen Stefani's \\"Hollaback Girl\\" is rewritten as \\"Hologram Girl\\", and Village People's \\"Y.M.C.A.\\" is rewritten as \\"Empire Today\\". Dance locales are themed to the character and a particular moment for them in the Star Wars saga story; for example, Princess Leia's dance takes place in front of Jabba the Hutt, and Han Solo's dance takes place in the carbon-freezing chamber on Bespin. Development and release Microsoft Studios had planned to develop a Star Wars game since early in the development of the Kinect system. Kudo Tsunoda, creative director for Kinect, said of this decision: \\"It's one of those things where you can see how the unique parts of Kinect can bring to life the fantasy of being a Jedi in a way no other game console or media can do.\\" The release of the game was formally announced at the Electronic Entertainment Expo on June 6, 2011, where the first gameplay trailer and portions of the game were shown. A social media application was released for iOS, Android, and Windows Phone mobile devices. It combined Twitter and Facebook feeds on the game in the style of the Star Wars opening crawl. Craig Derrick was LucasArts' lead producer on Kinect Star Wars. The visuals of the animation were augmented in such a way to make the Jedi fighting techniques appear realistic because according to Derrick \\"What we found early in development is that no one wants to look like 'Star Wars kid' in front of their friends.\\" It was the last game to be published by LucasArts. Five individual downloadable content pieces are available. The first, a podracer piloted by an adult Anakin Skywalker, is only available through a promotion with Brisk. Select bottles of iced tea feature a Microsoft M-Tag barcode which can be scanned by the Kinect to unlock the podracer. The remaining four consist of playable characters in different modes: a Snow Rancor, a Korriban Rancor, bounty hunter Aurra Sing and Jedi Master Kit Fisto. It was released worldwide on April 3, 2012. A limited- edition console bundle was launched alongside the game with the Xbox 360 S set designed to look like R2-D2. The bundle included the console with a 320 GB hard drive, a white Kinect sensor and the gold controller modeled after C-3PO. The bundle was sold for a MRP of $449.99 in the United States and ¬£349.99 in the United Kingdom and is the first custom Xbox 360 bundle to be released. Reception Kinect Star Warss Galactic Dance-off mode was the subject of both praise and criticism from reviewers. The Han Solo dance in particular was considered an absurd addition to the game, and went on to become an internet meme. Kinect Star Wars has received mixed reviews at aggregate website Metacritic, with scores ranging from 30/100 to 80/100. Reviewers often praised the game's art and presentation, but had complaints about the perceived underdeveloped gameplay, weak writing and inaccurate controls. Kinect Star Wars debuted at number one on the UK All Formats Chart, making it the first Kinect-exclusive game to do so in the UK. It is also the first Star Wars game to top the charts since 2008. It also appeared on numerous lists of the worst Star Wars games ever developed. Anthony Gallegos of IGN felt that the game was simply a collection of minigames instead of the larger \\"Jedi epic fans are dying for.\\" Meanwhile, Liam Martin of Digital Spy maintained that there was a strong sense of effort from the developer, and to simply \\"call Kinect Star Wars a mini-game compilation would be to do it a disservice.\\" Martin praised the games setting, which is narrated by R2-D2 and C-3PO. He did concede, however that certain elements of the game's controls were unresponsive at times, and that this could cause frustrations to players. Jonathan Deesing of G4 gave the game's Rancor Rampage and Galactic Dance-off modes high marks. He stated that some modes might feel tiresome to players, and noted that, during his time playing the podracing mode, he would sit in a chair to minimize fatigue and to feel further immersed. He, however, criticized the game's graphics for resembling that of a Wii game. In a more critical review Brad Shoemaker from Giant Bomb stated, \\"It doesn't matter who you claim Kinect Star Wars is for, it's a shoddy product on almost every level\\". Lorenzo Veloria of GamesRadar praised the game for seldom having to repeat a move (e.g. a kick and a lightsaber slash) to make the action work and making one of the best uses of the Kinect in an action game. Justin McElroy of Polygon criticized the Jedi Destiny mode for imprecise blocking controls, the repetitive combat formula, and limited strategy. Mark Walton of GameSpot praised the Galactic Dance-off mode for being \\"silly\\" and \\"comical fun\\", but criticized the lightsaber duels for being slow-paced and the storyline for being a derivative of the original trilogy.

It may be implemented in several ways, such as applying a fixed percentage to all customer's bills, or to large groups, or on a customer by customer basis. Economists have varied opinions on the issue of mandatory tipping. Argument against mandatory tipping include higher food price at the restaurant to make up for wages and loss of control of dining experience. General discussion Some bars in New York City's borough of Manhattan have instituted mandatory tipping. Mandatory tipping is considered an oxymoron, as tipping is by definition a voluntary act on the part of the customer. The BBC has reported that some find the practice bothersome; particularly those who are not aware that the tipping is used to subsidize the sub-standard pay at the workplace. One waiter in London, England has criticized the low wages to the popular press. Mandatory tipping and voluntary tipping are illegal in some cases: Australian casino employees,Tasmanian Gaming Control Act 1993 and US government employees, for example. Tipping is not generally part of Japanese culture, and can be confusing or offensive. Tipping in China is frowned upon, except for those living in the semi-westernized regions of Hong Kong and Macau.A few tips on handling gratuities worldwide Slightly less authoritative sources are appellate court decisions, with the U.S. Supreme Court at the top. Appellate courts regard mandatory gratuities as income for servers rather than a tip, thus affecting taxation. However, court cases have yet to set a precedent that failing to pay \\"mandatory gratuity\\" is illegal. A Google Scholar search of the exact phrase \\"mandatory gratuity\\" among all legal opinions and journals found 17 hits (excluding two articles), and all of those cases regarded mandatory gratuities as mandatory. Restaurant customers who pay the food portion of their bill but not the mandatory gratuity have at times been arrested, but charges are generally dropped.NBC10 Philadelphia: Theft Charges Dropped Against No-Tip Couple (November 24, 2009)New York Times: Charges were dropped yesterday against a Long Island man who was arrested last week for failing to leave a required 18 percent gratuity at Soprano's Italian and American Grill in Lake George, N.Y. (September 25, 2004) Some cruise lines charge their patrons $10/day in mandatory tipping; this does not include extra gratuities for alcoholic beverages. Judith Martin in her 2005 manners book opines that fast food restaurants will never charge mandatory tipping for their customers, despite the presence of tip jars,\\"Miss Manners Guide to Excruciatingly Correct Behavior, Freshly Updated\\" by Judith Martin, p. 762. 2005. Emily Post Institute‚ÄîTip Jar Survey Results and considers tipping for non-table services to be inappropriate. Ian Ayres, Fredrick E. Vars & Nasser Zakariya published a paper suggesting that tipping contributed to racial prejudice, since ethnic minorities would often be less able to pay a large tip. Another paper by Yoram Margalioth of Tel Aviv University argued that there was a negative externality associated with tipping, and that the practice facilitated tax evasion. Two other American studies have contributed to the thesis that tipping is racially discriminatory, finding that ethnic minority servers and taxicab drivers received lower tips on average than their white counterparts. In the study of the servers, an attempt by the author to isolate other possible contributing factors, such as poor service, found that \\"After controlling for these other variables ‚Ä¶ the server race effect is comparable across customer race.\\" Labour laws =Canada= According to guidelines established by the Canadian Restaurant and Foodservices Association, autograts and any tip pools controlled and distributed by the restaurant are legally subject to income tax and other mandatory deductions before being paid to the servers. All other gratuities are deemed direct tips and it is the server's responsibility to declare them as taxable income when filing for income tax.

Season three aired on Sundays at 9:00 pm ET and consisted of 13 episodes. Sally Fields had a guest appearance as the judge for the episode. Storylines =Jane/Deb & Grayson= Grayson nearly marries Vanessa, but she backs out on the day of the wedding. Jane has two relationships during the season that indicate she is trying to move on from Grayson. The first, with Dr. Bill Kendall (Ben Shenkman), ends when he reveals that Jane is one of the several women he is dating and that he is not ready to get serious with any one of them. The second, toward the end of the season, is with a fun-loving new judge named Owen French (Lex Medlin). =Kim & Parker= Kim and Parker's relationship was short lived, after Kim realized that Parker just ignored all of his ex-partners. In the end of Season 2, Jane shares with Kim that she saw Harrison and Parker kissing in Parker's office. Kim is outraged and goes to Parker's house to tell him that they're over. Harrison fires Kim from the firm in the end of Season 2, but she returns in Mid-Season 3. In early Season 3, Parker still tries to charm Kim and begs her to come back to him. She refuses, and keeps moving on with her job and maintaining a platonic relationship with her boss. They end up together in a later episode, seemingly giving their relationship another try. But when Parker hired his former flame Elisa (Brandy) as a temp, Kim became jealous, putting Jane in a tough situation, knowing that Elisa has a son with Parker and Parker doesn't know anything about it. =Fred & Stacy= Stacy shares with Jane that she's afraid Fred thinks that the kissing IS the relationship, and they have not progressed to intercourse. Stacy keeps waking up early to run, claiming she runs a lot when she's frustrated. Jane then gives Fred advice, because Jane knows everything Stacy wants in a man. Afterward, it appears the relationship has been consummated and is going well, because Stacy claims she \\"may never run again.\\" Stacy finally gets a part on a TV show as a main star. She claims that she has to keep her relationship with Fred a \\"secret\\" for publicity purposes, but eventually she ends up cheating on Fred with her co-star, Brian (Robert Hoffman), and Fred witnesses the two sharing a passionate kiss. Stacy is unable to choose between Brian and Fred; despite Jane's advice for her to talk to Fred, the choice is made for Stacy when Fred eventually confronts her and angrily leaves. Stacy becomes distraught and upset with Jane, believing Jane told Fred of her infidelity. Fred is later shown having drinks with Grayson and Teri, who comfort him. Stacy's behavior ends up annoying not only Fred, but also Jane/Deb and Teri when she becomes a diva and starts treating her friends like dirt, leading to a failed intervention. Brian steals her commercial deal and sleeps with her assistant, resulting in Stacy punching out Brian and getting arrested for assault. She is later cleared of the charges, but kisses Grayson after he represented her. Although the two quickly realize it was a mistake, Stacy is unaware that Jane saw it. Jane also tells Fred at the airport about what happened, thus devastating Fred who was ready to forgive Stacy and propose to her.

He made his MLB debut with the Florida Marlins in 2011. After being released by the Marlins in 2016, he was claimed off waivers by the San Diego Padres. He was a two-time MLB All-Star with the Padres before he was traded to the Indians in 2018. Early life Hand is a 2008 graduate of Chaska High School in Chaska, Minnesota. He was named the Star Tribune Metro Player of the Year in baseball for 2008. Hand committed to attend Arizona State University on a scholarship to play college baseball for the Arizona State Sun Devils. Professional career =Florida / Miami Marlins= The Florida Marlins selected Hand in the second round, with the 52nd overall selection, of the 2008 MLB draft. He signed with the Marlins, rather than attend Arizona State. He played at the Rookie-level in 2008, pitching to a 3‚Äì2 win‚Äìloss record and a 2.64 earned run average (ERA). He pitched for the Greensboro Grasshoppers of the Class A South Atlantic League in 2009, ending the year with a 7‚Äì13 record and a 4.86 ERA. He spent the 2010 season with the Jupiter Hammerheads of the Class A-Advanced Florida State League. As a 21-year-old, Hand spent the 2011 season shuttling between the Double-A Jacksonville Suns and the Major Leagues. Hand was called up to the majors for the first time on June 6, 2011. He made his debut the next day against the Atlanta Braves. In his debut, Hand became the second starter since 1946 to throw at least 6 innings and allow one hit or less to lose the game. Hand got his first big league win on July 8, 2011 against the Houston Astros, throwing seven, two-hit shutout innings. In a total of four stints at the Major League level, Hand accumulated a 1‚Äì8 record and 4.20 ERA in 12 starts while posting an 11‚Äì4 record and 3.40 ERA in 18 starts at Jacksonville. Hand pitching for the New Orleans Zephyrs in Hand spent most of 2012 with the Triple-A New Orleans Zephyrs. On August 3, Hand was called up for a doubleheader game against the Washington Nationals so as not to disrupt the starting rotation. He pitched 3 innings, giving up seven runs on six hits and six walks, and took the loss. The next day, he was sent back down to New Orleans. He finished the season with the Zephyrs going 11‚Äì7 with a 4.00 ERA and a 1.38 WHIP in 148 innings pitched, with 75 walks and 141 strikeouts in 27 games started. Hand also began 2013 as a starter for the Triple-A club. He was recalled to the Marlins on April 30 after the team used 7 pitchers in an extra-inning game the previous night, but was optioned back after a single relief appearance. After a May injury and a rehab assignment with the Rookie League club, Hand rejoined the Zephyrs on July 30. Hand made a total of 15 starts with the Zephyrs, going 3‚Äì5 with a 3.42 ERA. He was recalled to the Marlins in September, where he made six appearances, including two starts. For the season, he compiled a 3.05 ERA over 20 big league innings. Hand made the 25-man roster for the Marlins in 2014 as a long reliever and spot starter. Used mostly as a reliever in the first half, Hand went to the disabled list with an ankle sprain in late May. After a rehab assignment, he returned to the Marlins in July and was placed in the rotation as the Marlins had already looked at a number of starting pitcher options. Hand had varied results with an ERA of 3.80 as a starter after his return. For the full 2014 season, Hand pitched to a 4.38 ERA in 111 innings. In 2015, Hand prepared for a starting role in spring training. He was used mostly as a long reliever early in the season, but was inserted into the rotation in August. Hand had a 4‚Äì6 record and 5.68 ERA in 12 starts, and a 4.71 ERA in 36 innings over 26 appearances in relief. Hand was one of the final cuts in spring training in 2016, and was designated for assignment on April 3. =San Diego Padres= Hand was claimed off waivers by the San Diego Padres on April 8, 2016. Hand quickly became a fixture in the back half of the Padres bullpen in 2016, regularly pitching the 7th inning for the club, although 22 of his appearances spanned more than one inning. Hand pitched 89 innings and led the league with 82 appearances. He averaged 11.2 strike-outs per 9 innings on the year, a marked improvement over the 5.9 strike-outs per 9 he averaged over his 90 games with the Marlins, and posted a 2.92 ERA. He became the sixth Padres reliever to strike out more than 100 batters in a season. Of all MLB pitchers, he held left-handed batters to the lowest batting average, .124 (in 20 or more innings). In 2017, Hand was selected as the Padres representative for the All- Star Game. Hand earned the honor by putting up a 2.30 ERA and 60 strike-outs over 47 innings in the first half, and he pitched a perfect seventh in the game itself. Hand was also named The Hartford National League Reliever of the Month for July. Hand was regularly pitching the 7th or 8th inning for the Padres, but moved into the closer role once Brandon Maurer was traded in late July and saved 21 games on the season. He finished with a 2.16 ERA and 104 strikeouts in 79 innings and 72 appearances. On January 14, 2018, the Padres signed Hand to a three-year extension, buying out his first year of free agency, with a club option for 2021. Owning a 2.91 ERA with 24 saves, Hand was named to the 2018 MLB All-Star Game. =Cleveland Indians= On July 19, 2018, Hand was traded to the Cleveland Indians, along with fellow reliever Adam Cimber, for catcher and outfielder Francisco Mej√≠a. Towards the end of the season, Hand replaced Cody Allen as the team's closer, saving eight games for the Indians in 28 appearances. Between the two teams he was 2‚Äì5 with a 2.75 ERA and 32 saves. In 2019, Hand performed strongly in the first half, earning 23 saves with a 2.17 ERA. However, his effectiveness dwindled for the remainder of the season, as he recorded a 6.08 ERA and a .351 batting average against in the final two months. Overall, Hand earned 34 saves with a 3.30 ERA and 84 strikeouts in innings in 2019. In 2020, Hand was a perfect 16-for-16 in save opportunities, leading the AL in saves and in games finished (21), and had a 2.05 ERA in the regular season. However, in his first postseason appearance, he blew a save in an elimination game against the New York Yankees, resulting in the end of the Indians' season. Personal life Hand married longtime girlfriend Morgan Baker on February 28, 2015. The couple's first child, a daughter, was born in 2015. Their second child, a son, was born in 2017.

He has conducted fieldwork and published works on the archaeology of the American Southwest and the Great Plains in South Dakota. His work emphasizes on a strong understanding of cultural history and statistical analysis. Early life and education Charles McNutt was born in Denver, Colorado on December 11, 1928. The son of an army officer, McNutt spent his early years traveling around the country. He attended Sewannee Military Academy for his last three years of high school, and graduated in 1946 at the rank of Cadet Captain. McNutt attended the University of the South at Sewanee, majoring in mathematics. He excelled in college, earning the highest grades of his freshman class, one of four Rockefeller General Education Board scholarships, and graduated as Valedictorian in 1950. Wanting to expand his interests in graduate school, McNutt enrolled in the Department of Anthropology at the University of New Mexico. After receiving an M.A. in Anthropology at New Mexico in 1954 he enrolled in the PhD program at the University of Michigan. He received the PhD in Anthropology in 1960. Early fieldwork McNutt's first field experience came when he was a crew chief for the summer of 1951 at a non-ceramic cave excavation in Lincoln County, New Mexico, supervised by Dr. Paul Rieter. The site had excellent preservation, and numerous woven goods, such as sandals and, baskets were excavated. McNutt would continue work in the Southwest for the next three years, working both a student and paid crew member on such notable excavations as the Early Pueblo site near Santa Anna in 1953 and the Tesque By-pass Site in 1955. He completed his Master's Thesis for Anthropology, A Re-evaluation of the San Juan Basket Maker Culture, in 1954.A Re-evaluation of the San Juan Basket Maker Culture. 1954. Master's Thesis, University New Mexico. McNutt described the theoretical approach of the University of New Mexico curriculum as Boazian, with an emphasis on culture history. In 1955 he started in the Ph. D. program at the University of Michigan for his doctorate in 1955, where he described his education as geared in a more evolutionary anthropological direction. This was during Albert Spaulding‚Äôs time at Michigan, an influential archaeologist known for his reliance on quantitative methods for typifying cultures. McNutt's first experience with Southeastern archaeology was during a trip in 1955 as a graduate student to Poverty Point with Albert Spaulding and James B. Griffin,Shannon Tushingham, Jane Hill, Charles H. McNutt, 2003. Histories of Southeastern Archaeology. University of Alabama Press, Tuscaloosa. to meet James A. Ford and other noted archaeologists of the time to discuss the site. They subsequently visited Monk's Mound in Cahokia and attended the 14th annual SEAC (Southeastern Archaeological Conference). However, it was not until 1959 that he began work in what would later become his area of expertise, the southeastern United States. McNutt worked continually in the field during this period, excavating and publishing on a number of sites in the Northern Great Plains, although his doctoral dissertation, on the early Puebloan occupation of the Tesque By-pass site, was indicative of his continued interest in the Southwest. Archaeological career McNutt's first teaching position was at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville, where he excavated and published on the Melton Hill Reservoir. McNutt stayed at the University of Tennessee two years as an Assistant professor, ending in the Spring of 1962. He then took a job at Northern Arizona University in the summer of 1962. After two years at Northern Arizona, where he worked with Bob Euler, McNutt returned to Tennessee in 1964, to Memphis State University (now the University of Memphis), where his presence would lead the program its emphasis on the Southeast from the 1970s onward. Throughout his tenure at Memphis State, McNutt worked excavations throughout the Midsouth and produce numerous publications. At MSU, he taught a wide range of classes for more than 25 years, with subjects ranging from general anthropology and the application of mathematics and statistics to the archaeology of numerous culture areas in prehistoric North America and studies of economics among non-literate cultures. He also worked very closely with graduate students, co-authoring many publications with them. The volume Histories of Southeastern Archaeology is written in his honor. In 1992, McNutt helped establish the Tennessee Council of Professional Archaeologists and served as its president during its initial years.

Memphis State University Anthropology Research Center, Occasional Papers, no. 1. Senior author; with J. Bennett Graham. The investigations made significant progress in understanding the effects of lake- shore action on artifact weathering and distribution. McNutt also published also extensively on archeological theory and application, as evidenced by his 1971 article \\"On the Methodological Validity of Frequency Seriation.\\" McNutt asserted that the highly popular method of type-frequency seriation, commonly known as ‚Äòbattle-ship curves‚Äô was methodologically unsound, noting the assumptions of unidirectional societal evolution made by the method. McNutt is also known for his close work with his graduate students, who have included many now notable archaeologists, among them Dr. Shannon Tushingham of Washington State University, Dr. Jane Hill of the University of Pennsylvania, Guy Weaver, RPA, with whom McNutt has published on multiple sites, such as the Duncan Tract Site,\\"The Duncan Tract Site, (40TR27), Trousdale County, Tennessee.\\" 1983.

St Peter's is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. History The church was built in 1863‚Äì66 and designed by the Lancaster architect E. G. Paley. It cost ¬£9,507 (), and provided seating for 689 people. Architecture =Exterior= St Peter's is constructed in rock-faced stone with ashlar dressings and has a slate roof. Its plan consists of a five-bay nave with a clerestory, north and south aisles, a chancel with a southwest vestry, north and south porches, and a northeast tower with a broach spire. The tower has diagonal buttresses, a stair turret to the east, and a three-light north window. The bell openings are paired, each having two lights and louvres. At the top of the tower is a cornice and gargoyles. The spire has two tiers of lucarnes, the lower tier having two lights. Along the walls of the aisles are two-light windows containing Geometric tracery. Between the windows are buttresses with gables, the cornices of which are carved with animals. Along the clerestory are pairs of two-light windows. At the west end of the nave is a four-light window flanked by gabled buttresses. There are two-light windows at the west ends of the aisles. The east window has three lights, and is also flanked by gabled buttresses. In the south wall of the chancel is a two-light window with a trefoil head. =Interior= Organ The arcades are carried on round piers with crocketted capitals. The wagon roof is supported by separate corbelled shafts. In the church are two wrought iron chandeliers. The font is round and is carried on a quatrefoil column. Its bowl is carved with roundels. The stained glass includes a window dated 1881 to the memory of a nine-year-old child; it incorporates his photograph twice. The organ is at the west end. It has three manuals and was made by Edmund Schulze in 1873. It was rebuilt in 1903 with pneumatic action by Thomas Pendlebury of Leigh. In 1966 J. H. Cowen of Liverpool added a detached electric console and more stops. In 1977 most of the alterations made by Cowan were reversed by the Pendlebury Organ Company of Cleveleys, who also added a new detached drawstop console. The organ has been awarded a Historic Organ Certificate, Grade II*. This organ is no longer in a playable condition, and the church currently uses a digital computing organ built by Hugh Banton in 2004. There is a ring of eight bells, all cast in 1866 by Mears and Stainbank of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry.

After issuing a hit batsman and a single, he struck out the side.Expanded box score for Cubs game of September 8, 2019 On December 2, 2019, Hultzen was non-tendered by Chicago and became a free agent. On January 22, 2020, Hultzen re-signed with the Cubs on a minor league deal. Scouting report Hultzen was considered one of the most polished prospects in the 2011 draft class due to the excellent command he has over his pitches. In addition to his pitching, Hultzen is considered an excellent position player, although it's unlikely that he'll ever be developed as a position prospect. His main pitch is a four-seam fastball at 91‚Äì94 mph. He also has a two-seam fastball with similar velocity. His off-speed pitches are a slider and vulcan changeup in the low 80s. Hultzen struggled with his control in AAA in 2012, walking 43 hitters in innings. Addressing those concerns, Hultzen said, \\"You need to learn how to fail in this game ... I haven't faced a lot of failure as a pitcher. You need to learn how to cope with it, and I think I have. Hopefully most of it is behind me.\\" References External links *Player Bio: Danny Hultzen *Danny Hultzen interview Category:1989 births Category:Living people Category:All-American college baseball players Category:All-Star Futures Game players Category:Major League Baseball pitchers Category:Baseball players from Maryland Category:People from Bethesda, Maryland Category:Chicago Cubs players Category:Virginia Cavaliers baseball players Category:Jackson Generals (Southern League) players Category:Tacoma Rainiers players Category:Arizona League Mariners players Category:Peoria Javelinas players Category:Arizona League Cubs players Category:Iowa Cubs players Category:St. Albans School (Washington, D.C.) alumni ","title":"Danny Hultzen"},{"id":"31999346","text":"Therme Erding is the second largest thermal bath complex in Europe (after Therme Bucharest) at .

The comic appeared as a daily strip in the Austrian tabloid 'Das Kleine Blatt' published by Vorw√§rts-Verlag from October 5, 1930. Tobias Seicherl can be regarded as the first continental European daily comic strip. The comic strip has been written in Viennese and was one of the first European comics featuring balloons.Ludwig Kmoch (lambiek.net) ‚ÄòSeicherl‚Äô has two meanings in Viennese, which are semantically connected. The original meaning of ‚Äòsmall sieve‚Äô later gave rise to the second meaning of ‚Äòweakling‚Äô; someone who lacks moral character - letting everything ‚Äòsieve straight through‚Äô them.  Main characters  Tobias Seicherl, a typical petit bourgeois, was drunk on many occasions and often took to strolling through the streets of Vienna with his walking stick, pipe and dog named Struppi. It's somewhat ironic that the dog was the voice of reason in this strip. Little was known or discussed about Seicherl‚Äôs career or his living conditions, which made him the ideal person with which social-democratic readers could identify themselves, helping to vent their frustrations toward the bourgeois of the time.Konstantin Kaiser: Die Karrieren des Kleinen Mannes. Hirnschal, Seicherl, Schwejk und Bockerer im Zweiten Weltkrieg. (literaturepochen.at)  History  Between 1930 and 1939, the comic was published on a daily basis in ‚ÄòDas Kleine Blatt‚Äô, although sporadically so into the first part of 1940. The series was politically orientated between the years 1930‚Äì1934, in which Tobias Seicherl was seen to sympathize with Adolf Hitler. However, from 1934 onwards, with the introduction of the Austro-fascist dictatorship, Seicherl inevitably became unpolitical. By the end of the 1930s the strip displayed some nationalistic tendencies.Auf der Suche nach √∂sterreichischen Comic-Strips (www.raketa.at) Tobias Seicherl was so popular that special edition volumes have been published as early as 1933. After the closing days of WWII attempts were made to revive the comic strip. From 1958 to 1961, the Seicherl series appeared in a variety of different Viennese newspapers yet was unable to once again achieve the high point of its earlier success.

DEH includes five divisions: * Animal Protection and the Denver Animal Shelter (DAS)Community Health & Decision Support (CHDS) * Environmental Quality (EQ) * Public Health Inspections (PHI) * The Office of the Medical Examiner (OME) Brief History In 1990, the board of Denver Department of Health & and Hospitals, then a city department, concluded and recommended to then Mayor Pena that the Coroner's Office (now known as the Office of the Medical Examiner in Environmental Health) be removed from the Denver Department of Health & Hospitals due to conflict of interest in the Coroner‚Äôs duty to investigate suspicious deaths that occur in hospital settings. Since the Department of Health & Hospitals included Denver General Hospital, the board concluded that the Coroner's Office should be run as a \\"medical examiner system\\" separate from Denver General Hospital, and should meet the National Association of Medical Examiner's accreditation standards and be run by a Chief Forensic Pathologist. In 1997, the Department of Health and Hospitals, a city charter department within the City & County of Denver, separated from the city to become Denver Health & Hospital Authority (DHHA). DHHA was created under State statute as an independent State Authority, run by a board of directors appointed by the Mayor. No longer a department under the city with city authority, the statute provides that as an independent authority \\"the city shall have no further control over the operations of the health system.‚Äù Reason for separation: Among others, # Allow Denver Health to be free of Denver‚Äôs personnel and procurement system to enable DHHA to compete more effectively with other health care providers. # As an independent entity, DHHA would be better able to raise charitable contributions and to compete with other hospitals for private-pay patients The Denver Department of Environmental Health (DEH) was established to replace the Department of Health and Hospitals to be city's neutral and publicly accountable, public health agency. While DHHA maintained the medical service functions, DEH was established to administer and exercise control over all City programs and functions pertaining to public, mental and environmental health of the public and to enforce related City rules and regulations. DEH retains city charter authority and responsibilities, except the hospital and medical care functions. This authority includes: * Appointing the County Coroner * Preparing and administering the department's budget and being accountable to taxpayers (public as part of the Colorado Open Records Records Act), which includes payment for some of DHHA's health and medical services * Exercise governmental powers including rulemaking, issuance and enforcement of public health orders including isolation and quarantine orders. This includes issuing fines and orders to comply in regulated food service facilities (restaurants, grocery stores, school cafeterias), Animal Care & Control violations (failure to spay or neuter, vaccinate, license, etc.), violations of the city's air quality, land and water quality-related ordinances. * Contract with DHHA for health and medical services pursuant to terms and conditions approved by agreement (the \\"Operating Agreement\\"). * DEH undertakes its public and environmental health responsibilities through its agencies and partnerships, including DHHA pursuant to the Operating Agreement. * DEH provides oversight of the Operating Agreement (OA) on behalf of and in coordination with multiple City agencies who receive medical services from DHHA.

Between 1403 and 1408, he held the office of (\\"chief administrator\\") of Bohemia.  Life  It is not known when and where Boƒçek II was born. His parents were Boƒçek I of Podƒõbrady and Elisabeth of Lichtemburk (; ), a daughter of Henry of Lichtenburg at ≈Ωleby Castle. Boƒçek was named after the founder of the Podƒõbrady branch of the House of Kun≈°t√°t. Boƒçek is sometimes called \\"the Elder\\", to contrast him with his son Boƒçek III of Podƒõbrady, who was called \\"Boƒçek the Younger\\". Boƒçek II is first mentioned in a deed of 1375, about the division of the inheritance of his father, who died in 1373. Since Boƒçek II was the first born, he inherited the larger part of his father's possessions, which were mostly in eastern Bohemia. In 1376 he received Lipnice as a fief from the King Charles IV of Bohemia. In 1377, he transferred the Lordship of Pot≈°t√°t to his wife Anna Elisabeth as a dowry. Between 1377 and 1387, he may have held the position of Treasurer or Chief Treasurer of Bohemia.This is questioned in recent research. See: Ond≈ôej Felcman et al., p. 55 In 1387 Boƒçek II and P≈Øta II of ƒåastolovice bought the Lordship of Skuhrov nad Bƒõlou and Rychmberk Castle in the foothills of the Orlick√© hory mountains from the brothers Jan and Jaroslav of ƒåesk√© Mezi≈ô√≠ƒç√≠. During the reign of King Wenceslaus, Boƒçek II was initially on his side, but later turned away from him. In 1394 he was among the nobles who signed the initiative of the Margrave Jobst of Moravia, a joint statement with which they turned against the king, who was eventually captured. Presumably in return for this support, Margrave Jobst gave Boƒçek possessions in Moravia. In 1402 he supported King Wenceslaus again, in that he was against the candidacy of Wenceslaus brother Sigismund. This is probably why he received the position of Oberstlandschreiber (chief administrator) of Bohemia in 1403. He also was chairman of the manorial court and member of the royal Council. Thanks to a mutual inheritance treaty from 1385 between Boƒçek and his relative Gerhard of Kun≈°t√°t, Boƒçek II was able to strengthen his position in Moravia after Gerhard's death in 1406. From Gerhards he inherited among others Kun≈°t√°t, Bouzov, Moravsk√° T≈ôebov√°, Py≈°olec Castle, Boskovice, T√Ωnec na Moravƒõ and Velk√© B√≠lovice. He sold some of these possessions soon afterwards. In early 1415, Boƒçek II signed a petition, in which the high Bohemian nobles protested against the capture of Jan Hus. Later that year, after Hus was burned at the stake, Boƒçek was the third noble to sign a letter of complaint by the Bohemian nobility. Also in 1415, Boƒçek acquired the Lordships of N√°chod and Hummel in Eastern Bohemia from Henry of Lazan, in exchange for the South Bohemian Lordship of Bechynƒõ. Since the latter still belonged to Bohemia, Boƒçek came geographically closer to the County of Kladsko, which would be very important to his descendants and would serve as a county seat and seat of power to the sons of George of Podƒõbrady. They would become counts of Kladsko, and as Dukes of M√ºnsterberg they would found the Silesian (M√ºnsterberg-Oels) branch of the Podiebrad family.  Marriage and offspring  Boƒçek II was married with Anna Elisabeth Lipa (), a daughter of Henry of Leipa (). The couple had four sons: # John (; ; died circa 1408), married in 1398 with Elisabeth of Wartenberg () # Boƒçek III of Podƒõbrady, (d. 1429) # Hynek Boƒçek of Podƒõbrady (d. 1426), married N.

After school he was sent to work as a laboratory assistant in a Windsor medical clinic. This introduction to science led him to begin a degree in metallurgy at Imperial College, London. However, he dropped out of university after just two terms. Hooper then went to Ireland to work as an armed bodyguard, before eking out a living as a painter. Career At the start of World War II he enrolled as an air gunner, but was soon transferred to ground staff. During the war he met Anthony Armstrong, editor of the training manual, Tee Emm, and together they created the character of PO Prune as a way of instructing wartime pilots what not to do if they wanted to save their lives and their aircraft. In the post-war years, Hooper and Armstrong produced a number of successful books.

They have also been defined as ‚Äòthoughts and actions, consciously chosen and operationalized by language learners, to assist them in carrying out a multiplicity of tasks from the very outset of learning to the most advanced levels of target language performance‚Äô. The term language learner strategies, which incorporates strategies used for language learning and language use, is sometimes used, although the line between the two is ill-defined as moments of second language use can also provide opportunities for learning. History Language learning strategies were first introduced to the second language literature in 1975, with research on the good language learner. At the time it was thought that a better understanding of strategies deployed by successful learners could help inform teachers and students alike of how to teach and learn languages more effectively. Initial studies aimed to document the strategies of good language learners. In the 80s the emphasis moved to classification of language learning strategies. Strategies were first classified according to whether they were direct or indirect, and later they were strategies divided into cognitive, metacognitive or affective/social categories. In 1990, Rebecca Oxford published her landmark book \\"Language Learning Strategies: What Every Teacher Should Know\\" which included the \\"Strategy Inventory for Language Learning\\" or \\"SILL\\", a questionnaire which was used in a great deal of research in the 1990s and early 2000s. Controversy over basic issues such as definition grew stronger in the late 1990s and early 2000s, however, with some researchers giving up trying to define the concept in favour of listing essential characteristics. Others abandoned the strategy term in favour of \\"self regulation\\". Classification of language learning strategies =O'Malley and Chamot classification= In 1990, O'Malley and Chamot developed a classification of three types of language learning strategies: *Metacognitive strategies, which involved thinking about (or knowledge of) the learning process, planning for learning, monitoring learning while it is taking place, or self-evaluation of learning after the task had been completed. *Cognitive strategies, which involved mental manipulation or transformation of materials or tasks, intended to enhance comprehension, acquisition, or retention. *Social/affective strategies, which consisted of using social interactions to assist in the comprehension, learning or retention of information. As well as the mental control over personal affect that interfered with learning. This model was based on cognitive theory, which was commended, but it was also criticized for the ad hoc nature of its third category. =Oxford taxonomy= Also in 1990, Rebecca Oxford developed a taxonomy for categorizing strategies under six headings: *Cognitive‚Äîmaking associations between new and already known information; *Mnemonic‚Äîmaking associations between new and already known information through use of formula, phrase, verse or the like; *Metacognitive‚Äîcontrolling own cognition through the co-ordination of the planning, organization and evaluation of the learning process; *Compensatory‚Äîusing context to make up for missing information in reading and writing; *Affective‚Äîregulation of emotions, motivation and attitude toward learning; *Social‚Äîthe interaction with other learners to improve language learning and cultural understanding. In later years this classification system was criticized for its problems in separating mnemonic strategies from cognitive strategies, when one is a sub-category of the other, and the inclusion of compensatory strategies, which are connected to how a learner uses the language, rather than learns it. =Recent research= More recent research has examined language learner strategies in more context-specific situations, rather than catch-all categories. That is, when learners study academic writing, for example, they are likely to deploy a different set of strategies than if they were to study daily conversation. The terms cognitive and meta-cognitive strategies remain common in strategy research, but others related to managing a learners' own affective state or social environment have been examined under the umbrella term self-regulation. Controversies First, although originally promoted as a means of helping students to achieve success in language learning, a synthesis of historical research on language learning strategies has produced conflicting results on the relationship between strategies and language learning success. In fact, much of the research that emerged in the 1990s included numerous conflicting studies based on use of the SILL as a research instrument, of which very few met rigorous research criteria. A second problem associated with researching language learner strategies is the definitional fuzziness of major concepts in the field. Researchers in field, such as Ernesto Macaro argue there is a lack of consensus of: *Whether strategies occur inside or outside of the brain; *Whether learner strategies consist of knowledge, intention, action or all three; *Whether to classify strategies in frameworks, hierarchies [or clusters]; *Whether strategies survive across all learning situations, tasks and contexts; *Whether they are integral or additive to language processing. Due to the definitional fuzziness of language learning strategies, critics have argued the whole field should be replaced with the psychological concept of self-regulation. However, language learning strategy researchers have argued that replacing the field would be a matter of 'throwing the baby out with the bathwater' in that it throws away 30 years of research because of definitional issues. It has also been argued that self-regulation and language learning strategies are measuring different parts of the learning process, and thus can be used in tandem to observe a more accurate picture of how learners learn a second language. Interest in the potential of strategies to promote learning remains strong, however, as evidenced from recent books on the topic, and number of special issues of academic journals on the topic. A particularly important question for educators is whether learners can benefit from strategy instruction, both in terms of improved linguistic outcomes and improved self- efficacy for learning. For example, in a study within the context of England, Graham and Macaro (2008) found improved listening skills and improved self- efficacy for listening among learners of French who had received instruction in listening strategies. Another important question is also the extent to which teachers have knowledge and understanding of how to incorporate language learning strategies into their teaching, with research indicating that this is an area for development . Related concepts Language learning strategies has naturally strong links to the fields of self-regulation, self-directed learning, and learner autonomy as they share core notions of independent learning, learner-centredness, and the necessity for learners to exercise responsibility for their own learning.

Life =Rise= Kilspindie was the fourth son of Archibald Douglas, 5th Earl of Angus, and his second wife, Elizabeth Boyd, herself a daughter of Robert Boyd, 1st Lord Boyd. In 1513, Kilspindie's two older brothers were killed at the Battle of Flodden, along with King James IV. His nephew, Archibald Douglas, 6th Earl of Angus married the King's widow, Margaret Tudor, and was regent for the young King James V, during this time Kilspindie became very popular with the boy-king, who knew him as Greysteil, the name of the subject of a popular ballad of the time. Kilspindie married Isobel Hoppar, described in 1515 as a \\"rich widow of Edinburgh\\" by Baron Dacre.Letters & Papers Henry VIII, vol.2 (1864), p.205 no.779, (Dacre not Dr. Magnus as in some sources) While the Douglas family were in power, Kilspindie became Lord High Treasurer of Scotland. He was Provost of Edinburgh in 1526, when the King granted him and his wife, Isobel Hopper, a tenement on the south side of Edinburgh's Netherbow.Register of the Great Seal, 1513-1546, HM Register House (1883), no.356 cf. no.649, between the houses of the deceased Henry Cant senior and Gilbert (or William) Lauder & Robert Tod. Adam Otterburn picked up the deeds of the house which had belonged to Philip Forrester and lay within Andrew Moubray's property. Andrew Moubray was married to Isobel Hoppar's niece, Katrine Hoppar. They built Moubray House on the north side of the street which still survives in part.Durkan, John, ed.,Protocol Book of John Foular, 1528-1985, (1985), p.2 no.3 =Fall= The King escaped from Angus's control in May 1528. According to the chronicle history by Robert Lindsay of Pitscottie, James V escaped from the Douglas family at Falkland Palace, riding to Stirling Castle while Kilspindie was visiting his mistress at Dundee. Finding the King had fled, he rode to Stirling with his nephew George Douglas of Pittendreich but the King's herald was in place on the bridge to demand they desist from approaching the King. Kilspindie and the Douglas family were condemned for treason and their lands forfeited at the September 1528 Parliament of Scotland. The King gave Kilspindie's tenement in Edinburgh to the new Treasurer, Robert Cairncross. Lands in Cunninghame went to Robert, Lord Maxwell, and Reidside near Tantallon Castle was given to Hugh Johnson, the King's cook.Register of the Great Seal, 1513-1546, HM General Register House (1883), nos. 643, 644, 649, the tenement now described with the Netherbow to the south, between Andrew Moubray's, William Lauder's and Robert Tod's. The Douglases were already on the Scottish borders or in exile in England, and James laid siege to their castle at Tantallon. On 5 September 1528 the Earl of Angus shouted over the Tweed to the Earl of Northumberland's steward that if his family was forced into exile at Norham Castle, Isobel Hoppar would wait on Margaret Douglas. Margaret crossed the Tweed to Norham in October. The English diplomat Thomas Magnus believed that Isobel was a significant factor in events, writing to Cardinal Wolsey in November: > \\"the Erle of Angus ... I suppoos of trouth, totally ordoured not of hym self > but by his frendes, and specially by George his broder, as is Archebalde by > his wiff. Which twayne, by reaporte, have brought thaym all to this trouble > and busyness.\\"State Papers Henry Eighth, vol. iv (London, 1836), pp. > 509-510, 539-40 (quoted here): Letters & Papers Henry VIII, vol. 4 (London, > 1875), no. 4709 In November Thomas Magnus heard that James Hamilton of Finnart and the Sherrif of Ayr, despite being two \\"cherished servants\\" and counsellors of James V, had met the forfeited rebels Kilspindie and George Douglas of Pittendreich at Cockburnspath to discuss the restoration of the Earldom of Angus.State Papers Henry Eighth, vol. 4 part 4 (London, 1836), pp. 526, 530. In December 1528 Dr Magnus heard a rumour that the merchant communities of Veere and Middelburg had tried to contact Kilspindie before his forfeit, to ask him to support a marriage between James V and a sister or close relation of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor.Letters and Papers Henry VIII, vol. 4 (London, 1875), no. 5044 Isobel's son by her first marriage, Andrew Murray of Blackbarony, was officially forgiven for helping Archibald and Isobel in April 1542.Pitcairn, Ancient Criminal Trials, vol. 1 issue 1 (Bannatyne Club, 1833), p.258 A later history of the family by David Hume of Godscroft has Kilspindie returning to Scotland 10 years later. He approached the King at the Royal Park of Stirling. The King recognised him but ignored him and rode up the hill to the Castle. Kilspindie, though wearing concealed chain-mail, followed on foot and arrived exhausted at the same time, but no-one would give him a drink since James had showed him no favour. He then went to France on the King's orders. Family His wife Isobel Hoppar was described in legal documents as his widow in 1536. Their son and heir Archibald Douglas, succeeded as Laird of Kilspindie in 1543 following a reversal of his family's forfeiture, and also went on to be Provost of Edinburgh three times: 1554-1557, 1559-1562 and 1562-1565.Bingham, Caroline, James V, Collins (1971),61, 72-73, 77, 142-3: Reid, David, ed., David Hume of Godscroft's History of the House of Angus, vol. 1, STS (2005), 101-3 References Sources Fraser, Sir William, The Douglas Book IV vols, Edinburgh 1885 Category:16th-century Scottish people Category:Court of James V of Scotland Category:Provosts of Edinburgh Category:Scottish diplomats A Category:Treasurers of Scotland Category:Scottish knights Category:Lairds Category:People from East Lothian ","title":"Archibald Douglas of Kilspindie"},{"id":"31999673","text":"HCPCS Level II codes are alphanumeric medical procedure codes, primarily for non-physician services such as ambulance services and prosthetic devices,.

Background Born in Manchester, he was the son of Henry S Straus of Sedgley Park, a merchant and vice consul for the Netherlands. Following education at Harrow School he was articled to Hale & Sons, colonial brokers in the City of London. The company specialised in the importation of ostrich feathers, ivory, rubber, mother of pearl, drugs, gums, spices, cocoa, mica, isinglass, fibres and carpets. He subsequently became a partner in the business, from which he retired in 1898. He was later chairman of Virol Limited, manufacturers of \\"Virol\\", a malt extract based vitamin preparation. Politics Straus entered politics as a member of Marylebone Vestry, and was later elected as a Progressive Party Councillor to represent Mile End on the London County Council in 1898, and was re-elected in 1901 and 1904.The London County Council Elections, The Times, 4 March 1898, p.10London County Council Election, The Times, 4 March 1901, p.7London County Council Election, The Times, 7 March 1904, p.12 At the 1895 general election Straus was chosen as the Liberal candidate to contest the constituency of Marylebone West, but failed to be elected. At the next general election in 1900 he stood at Tower Hamlets, St George, narrowly failing to be elected. St George's in London County with boundaries used in 1900 When the 1905 Mile End by-election was held at Mile End in 1905, Straus came close to winning the seat, losing to the Liberal Unionist candidate Harry Levy-Leveson by 78 votes. Mile End in London County with boundaries used 1905‚Äì1910 When a general election was held in the following year, Straus again faced Levy-Lawson at Mile End and managed to unseat him to become member of parliament. Straus was only to hold the seat for a single term, with Levy-Leveson regaining it at the next election in January 1910 by 57 votes. When a further election was held in December 1910, Straus and Levy-Lawson again faced each other, with Levy-Lawson holding the seat by only 6 votes. He did not stand for parliament again. Straus never married and died at his home at Hyde Park Mansions in August 1933, aged 66. He was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium.

The demonstration was in response to an attack, one week earlier, on Brad Forkner and Christopher Rosevear, a gay male couple who had been holding hands while walking across the bridge. According to the couple and the Portland Police Bureau, a group of five men followed Forkner and Rosevear along the bridge before physically assaulting them. The assault was condemned by Portland's mayor, Sam Adams, and its police chief, Mike Reese, and news of the attack spread throughout the Pacific Northwest and the United States. The attack prompted volunteers from the Q Center, a nonprofit organization that supports the LGBT community, to form street patrols as a means of monitoring Portland's downtown area. Several LGBT and human rights organizations sponsored Hands Across Hawthorne in response to the attack, with the purpose of linking hands across the entire span of the Hawthorne Bridge to show solidarity. More than 4,000 people attended the rally, which had been publicized on a single Facebook page 72 hours previously. Forkner, Rosevear, Mayor Adams, and other community leaders spoke at the rally. The event received attention throughout the United States. On June 5, residents of Spokane, Washington, held a similar hand-holding rally called \\"Hands Across Monroe\\", crossing the Monroe Street Bridge in Riverfront Park. Background =Hate crimes in Portland= Portland Police Bureau statistics showed a decrease in the number of \\"bias crime assaults\\", or \\"hate crimes\\", from 26 incidents in 2007 to 15 in 2009. In 2010, of just over 50 hate crime incidents reported in Portland, 20 involved gender or sexual orientation, far outnumbering racial hate crimes. In May 2010, a group of men in drag were harassed and assaulted by a group of five men. The filing of a police report resulted in a community forum at Portland's Q Center (a nonprofit organization supporting the LGBT community), which was attended by Portland Police Chief Mike Reese, Mayor Sam Adams, and Deputy District Attorney Rod Underhill, together with more than 100 city residents. The attacks led to the formation of the Queer Patrol (or Q Patrols) in July 2010, which consisted of foot patrols specifically designed to protect the LGBT community in downtown Portland. Sarah Mirk of The Portland Mercury attributed the rise in the recorded number of crimes related to gender or sexual identity in 2010 to the increased number of filed police reports, this due in part to the work of the Q Patrols. Hate crimes continued in the city; in November 2010, a man perceived to be gay was severely beaten and left unconscious while walking home in southeast Portland. According to Portland Police, eight bias crimes were reported between January 1 and April 30, 2011, half the number reported during the same period in 2010. =Assault= Rally participants crowd at the intersection of Tom McCall Waterfront Park, where the events leading to the attack began, and the Hawthorne Bridge Brad Forkner and Christopher Rosevear (aged 23 and 24, respectively) were attacked on the Eastbank Esplanade on May 22, 2011, after holding hands while walking across the Hawthorne Bridge in Portland, Oregon. Details of the attack were released by Portland Police on May 24. Forkner and Rosevear said a group of five men followed them from Tom McCall Waterfront Park across the bridge, then beat them as they came down a ramp along the Esplanade. According to the description released by Portland Police, \\"as [the couple] walked they knew several men were behind them talking, laughing and pointing but they were not sure it was directed at them.\\" Three of the five men attacked the couple from behind. Forkner was pushed into a railing and punched multiple times before breaking away to call 9-1-1. The attackers reportedly continued hitting Rosevear on the head, face, back and ribs until Forkner was able to call for police help. Forkner later recalled that he did not hear specific homophobic remarks, but believed the attackers may have been yelling in a foreign language. Forkner had swelling on his face, and Rosevear required stitches in his lip. The victims said that several witnesses were nearby, but did not offer help in any form. Police investigated the case as a \\"bias crime\\", noting the lack of provocation. the five men who attacked Forkner and Rosevear remained unidentified. The attack was reported by newspapers in the Pacific Northwest and by gay-oriented media outlets nationwide. Sam Adams, Portland's gay mayor, and Police Chief Mike Reese both spoke out against the attack. Adams said, \\"We seek to be the city of the most equal opportunity, and we can only be that city if all people are safe and have a sense of safety on our streets and in our parks.\\" The Cascade AIDS Project, where Forkner was the Pivot Center Coordinator at the time, launched a Facebook campaign following the attack called \\"Holding Hands, In Solidarity\\", encouraging people to post pictures of hand-holding. The Q Center also condemned the attack. The assault once again prompted Q Center volunteers to form Q Patrols as a means of monitoring the streets and reporting hate crimes to police. Plans were made to have Q Patrols available between 11 pm and 3 am until the weekend of Halloween. Rally Hands Across Hawthorne participants spanning the Hawthorne Bridge in Portland, Oregon, on May 29, 2011 Following the attack, Basic Rights Oregon (BRO), Cascade AIDS Project, Pride Northwest, the Q Center, and local churches organized a rally to link hands spanning the length of the Hawthorne Bridge to show solidarity. The event was publicized by a single Facebook page, created only 72 hours previously from Cascade AIDS Project's hand-holding photo gallery. Stephen Cassell, event organizer and Q Center board member, reportedly \\"thought of the action plan in the middle of the night and quickly posted the idea on Facebook.\\" The organization Progressive Oregon, which advocates for progressivism within that state, also advertised the event. More than 4,000 people attended the event, which began at 7:30 pm. Members of the Community of Welcoming Congregations, a coalition of more than 100 congregations in Oregon that welcome members of the gay community, and the Portland chapter of the Human Rights Campaign, also attended the rally. As demonstrators gathered at the west side of the bridge, the rally began with speeches by Forkner and Rosevear. Forkner said that this was not the first time he had feared for his safety, nor did he expect it to be the last: Mayor Sam Adams speaking at the rally Following Forkner's speech, Basic Rights Oregon executive director Jeana Frazzini thanked the couple, spoke of the symbolism of the hand-holding rally, and encouraged supporters to volunteer for the Q Patrol. During the rally, the crowd sang The Beatles' \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\\". According to Cassell, Hands Across Hawthorne marked one of the first instances where Portland's major LGBT rights organizations worked together on an event other than the Portland Pride Festival. Details of the rally were reported by various publications. The Huffington Post contributor Chuck Currie, a United Church of Christ minister from Portland, used the attack and rally to question the impact of conservative evangelical religion and other anti-gay-rights organizations. Progressive Oregon and Just Out (an LGBT newspaper in Portland) noted the failure of the city's largest newspaper, The Oregonian, to cover the rally; the former sent a letter and petition to the paper's publisher N. Christian Anderson III, requesting \\"fair and balanced\\" coverage. Peter Bhatia, editor for The Oregonian, responded to the criticism and petition signed by more than 1,400 people by saying the paper's lack of coverage was a \\"mistake\\" caused by \\"human error\\". One week after the rally, Mayor Sam Adams and his staff linked hands at Portland City Hall in solidarity. On June 5, residents of Spokane, Washington, held a similar hand-holding rally in solidarity with the Portland community called \\"Hands Across Monroe\\", crossing the Monroe Street Bridge in Riverfront Park. That event was sponsored by The LGBT Center.

It provides theory for atomic decomposition of a range of Banach spaces of distributions. Among others the well established wavelet transform and the short-time Fourier transform are covered by the theory. The starting point is a square integrable representation \\\\pi of a locally compact group \\\\mathcal G on a Hilbert space \\\\mathcal H, with which one can define a transform of a function f \\\\in \\\\mathcal H with respect to g\\\\in \\\\mathcal H by V_g f (x) = \\\\langle f, \\\\pi(x)g \\\\rangle. Many important transforms are special cases of the transform, e.g. the short-time Fourier transform and the wavelet transform for the Heisenberg group and the affine group respectively. Representation theory yields the reproducing formula V_g f = V_g f * V_g g. By discretization of this continuous convolution integral it can be shown that by sufficiently dense sampling in phase space the corresponding functions will span a frame for the Hilbert space. An important aspect of the theory is the derivation of atomic decompositions for Banach spaces. One of the key steps is to define the voice transform for distributions in a natural way. For a given Banach space Y, the corresponding coorbit space is defined as the set of all distributions such that V_g f \\\\in Y. The reproducing formula is true also in this case and therefore it is possible to obtain atomic decompositions for coorbit spaces.

This experiment played a major role in the general acceptance of the wave theory of light. In Young's own judgement, this was the most important of his many achievements. Theories of light propagation in the 17th and 18th centuries During this period, many scientists proposed a wave theory of light based on experimental observations, including Robert Hooke, Christiaan Huygens and Leonhard Euler. However, Isaac Newton, who did many experimental investigations of light, had rejected the wave theory of light and developed his corpuscular theory of light according to which light is emitted from a luminous body in the form of tiny particles. This theory held sway until the beginning of the nineteenth century despite the fact that many phenomena, including diffraction effects at edges or in narrow apertures, colours in thin films and insect wings, and the apparent failure of light particles to crash into one another when two light beams crossed, could not be adequately explained by the corpuscular theory which, nonetheless, had many eminent supporters, including Pierre-Simon Laplace and Jean-Baptiste Biot. Young's work on wave theory While studying medicine at G√∂ttingen in the 1790s, Young wrote a thesis on the physical and mathematical properties of sound and in 1800, he presented a paper to the Royal Society (written in 1799) where he argued that light was also a wave motion. His idea was greeted with a certain amount of skepticism because it contradicted Newton's corpuscular theory. From a book published in 1807 relating lectures given by Young in 1802 to London's Royal Institution Nonetheless, he continued to develop his ideas. He believed that a wave model could much better explain many aspects of light propagation than the corpuscular model: thumb200pxThomas Young's sketch of two-slit interference based on observations of water waves. He demonstrated the phenomenon of interference in water waves. In 1801, he presented a famous paper to the Royal Society entitled \\"On the Theory of Light and Colours\\" which described various interference phenomena, and in 1803 he described his famous double-slit experiment. Strictly speaking, there was no double slit in the original experiment as described by Young. Instead, the sunlight reflected off a steering mirror passed through a small hole in a paper, and the resulting thin light beam was then split in half alongside a paper card. Modern illustration of the experiment Geometry for far-field fringesThe figure shows the geometry for a far-field viewing plane. It is seen that the relative paths of the light travelling from the two points sources to a given point in the viewing plane varies with the angle Œ∏, so that their relative phases also vary. When the path difference is equal to an integer number of wavelengths, the two waves add together to give a maximum in the brightness, whereas when the path difference is equal to half a wavelength, or one and a half etc., then the two waves cancel, and the intensity is at a minimum. The linear separation (distance) - \\\\Delta y between fringes (lines with maximum brightness) on the screen is given by the equation : \\\\Delta y = L\\\\lambda / d where L is the distance between the slit and screen, \\\\lambda is the wavelength of light and d is the slit separation as shown in figure. The angular spacing of the fringes, , is then given by : \\\\theta _f \\\\approx \\\\lambda / d where <<1, and Œª is the wavelength of the light. It can be seen that the spacing of the fringes depends on the wavelength, the separation of the holes, and the distance between the slits and the observation plane, as noted by Young. This expression applies when the light source has a single wavelength, whereas Young used sunlight, and was therefore looking at white-light fringes which he describes above. A white light fringe pattern can be considered to be made up of a set of individual fringe patterns of different colours. These all have a maximum value in the centre, but their spacing varies with wavelength, and the superimposed patterns will vary in colour, as their maxima will occur in different places. Only two or three fringes can normally be observed. Young used this formula to estimate the wavelength of violet light to be 400 nm, and that of red light to be about twice that ‚Äì results with which we would agree today. In the years 1803‚Äì1804, a series of unsigned attacks on Young's theories appeared in the Edinburgh Review. The anonymous author (later revealed to be Henry Brougham, a founder of the Edinburgh Review) succeeded in undermining Young's credibility among the reading public sufficiently that a publisher who had committed to publishing Young's Royal Institution lectures backed out of the deal. This incident prompted Young to focus more on his medical practice and less on physics. Acceptance of the wave theory of light In 1817, the corpuscular theorists at the French Academy of Sciences which included Sim√©on Denis Poisson were so confident that they set the subject for the next year's prize as diffraction, being certain that a particle theorist would win it. Augustin-Jean Fresnel submitted a thesis based on wave theory and whose substance consisted of a synthesis of the Huygens' principle and Young's principle of interference. Poisson studied Fresnel's theory in detail and of course looked for a way to prove it wrong being a supporter of the particle theory of light. Poisson thought that he had found a flaw when he argued that a consequence of Fresnel's theory was that there would exist an on-axis bright spot in the shadow of a circular obstacle blocking a point source of light, where there should be complete darkness according to the particle-theory of light. Fresnel's theory could not be true, Poisson declared: surely this result was absurd. (The Poisson spot is not easily observed in everyday situations, because most everyday sources of light are not good point sources. In fact it is readily visible in the defocused telescopic image of a moderately bright star, where it appears as a bright central spot within a concentric array of diffraction rings.) However, the head of the committee, Dominique-Fran√ßois-Jean Arago thought it was necessary to perform the experiment in more detail. He molded a 2-mm metallic disk to a glass plate with wax. To everyone's surprise he succeeded in observing the predicted spot, which convinced most scientists of the wave-nature of light. In the end, Fresnel won the competition. After that, the corpuscular theory of light was vanquished, not to be heard of again till the 20th century. Arago later noted that the phenomenon (which is sometimes called the Arago spot) had already been observed by Joseph-Nicolas Delisle and Giacomo F. Maraldi a century earlier.

These may include the right to restitution, the right to a victims' advocate, the right not to be excluded from criminal justice proceedings, and the right to speak at criminal justice proceedings.For a description of typical U.S. victim's rights, see For statutory protection of victim's rights, see, e.g.,  United States  The Crime Victims' Rights Movement in the United States is founded on the idea that, during the late modern period (1800-1970), the American justice system strayed too far from its victim-centric origins. Since the 1970s, the movement has worked to give victims a more meaningful role in criminal proceedings, aiming at the inclusion of \\"the individual victim as a legally recognized participant with rights, interests, and voice.\\" = History = During the colonial and revolutionary periods, the United States criminal justice system was \\"victim-centric,\\" in that crimes were often investigated and prosecuted by individual victims. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, however, the focus shifted so that crime was seen primarily as a \\"social harm.\\" The criminal justice system came to be seen as a tool for remedying this social harm, rather than an avenue for redress of personal harm, and the role of the victim in criminal proceedings was drastically reduced. The modern Crime Victims' Rights Movement began in the 1970s. It began, in part, as a response to the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court Decision in Linda R.S. v. Richard D. (410 U.S. 614). In Linda R.S., the Court ruled that the complainant did not have the legal standing to keep the prosecutors' office from discriminately applying a statute criminalizing non-payment of child support. In dicta, the court articulated the then-prevailing view that a crime victim cannot compel a criminal prosecution because \\"a private citizen lacks a judicially cognizable interest in the prosecution or non-prosecution of another.\\" This ruling served as a high-water mark in the shift away from the victim-centric approach to criminal justice, making it clear that victims in the 1970s had \\"no formal legal status beyond that of a witness or piece of evidence.\\"NCVLI Bulletin, \\"Fundamentals of Victims' Rights: A Brief History of Crime Victims' Rights in the United States,\\" available at ncvli.org If the Linda R.S. Ruling was a clear representation of the problem of victim exclusion, it also hinted at a solution to the problem. The Court stated that Congress could \\"enact statutes creating victims' rights, the invasion of which creates standing, even though no injury would exist without the statute.\\" With this statement, the Court provided a legal foundation for victims' rights legislation. Along with these legal developments, there was a concurrent growth in social consciousness about victims' rights. This was due, in part, to the fact that concern for the fair treatment of victims provided a nexus between disparate, but powerful, social movements. The law and order Movement, the Civil Rights Movement, and the feminist movement all challenged the criminal justice system to think more carefully about the role of the victim in criminal proceedings. Supporters of these causes helped form the grassroots foundation of the modern Victims' Rights Movement, providing educational resources and legal assistance, and establishing the country's first hotlines and shelters for victims of crime. In 1982, President Ronald Reagan's Task Force on Victims of Crime released its final report which detailed the concerns of victims' rights advocates, claiming that \\"the innocent victims of crime have been overlooked, their pleas for justice have gone unheeded, and their wounds - personal, emotional, financial - have gone unattended.\\" The report contained 68 recommendations for service providers and government officials, many of which are mandated through victims' rights legislation today. The report included a recommendation for a victims' rights amendment to the U.S. Constitution. In the decades that followed, proponents of victims' rights experienced substantial legislative success. Today, the Victims' Rights Movement continues to promote legislation that guarantees substantive rights for victims, and provides the procedural mechanisms to effectively enforce those rights. Victims' rights organizations also do ground-level advocacy, providing individual victims with legal guidance and support, and educate future legal professionals on issues related to victims' rights. =Victims' rights legislation= Since 1982, thirty-three states have amended their constitutions to address victims' rights, and all states have passed victims' rights legislation. That same year, Congress passed the first piece of federal crime victims' rights legislation, the Victim and Witness Protection Act. In 1984, the Victims of Crime Act was passed. A decade later, in 1994, the Violence Against Women Act became law. In 2004, the landmark Crime Victims' Rights Act was passed, granting crime victims eight specific rights, and providing standing for individual victims to assert those rights in court.See: Statement of Sen. Feinstein re. CVRA (150 Cong. Rec s2329, April 22, 2004; and Jon Kyl, Stepven J. Twist, Stephen Higgins, \\"On the Wings of Their Angels: The Scott Campbell, Stephanie Roper, Wendy Preston, Lourna Gillis, and Nila Lynn Crime Victims' Rights Act,\\" Lewis and Clark Law Review, 581, (2005) =Federal law= Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) VOCA established the Crime Victims Fund, which awards grants to crime victim compensation programs, victim notification systems, and victim assistance programs. The Fund is financed by offender fees. Crime Victims' Rights Act of 2004 The Crime Victims' Rights Act, part of the Justice for All Act of 2004, enumerates the rights afforded to victims in federal criminal cases. The Act grants victims the following rights: # The right to protection from the accused, # The right to notification, # The right not to be excluded from proceedings, # The right to speak at criminal justice proceedings, # The right to consult with the prosecuting attorney, # The right to restitution, # The right to a proceedings free from unreasonable delay, # The right to be treated with fairness, and respect for the victims' dignity and privacy The Crime Victims' Rights Act was named for Scott Campbell, Stephanie Roper, Wendy Preston, Louarna Gillis, and Nila Lynn, murder victims whose families were denied some or all of the rights granted by the Act in the course of their cases. =State law= All states have passed legislation that protects the rights of victims of crime, and most have passed constitutional amendments that afford protection to crime victims. Some state laws apply to only victims of felony offenses, while other states also extend rights to victims of less serious misdemeanor offenses. When a victim is a minor, disabled, or deceased, some states permit family members to exercise rights on behalf of the victim. Common state law protections include: *The right to be treated with dignity and respect, *The right to be informed about the prosecution, plea offers, court proceedings, and sentencing, *The right to make a statement in court at the time of sentencing, *The right to protection, *The right to seek compensation from a state victim's rights fund, *The right to restitution from the offender, *The right to return of personal property, and *The right to be informed of parole proceedings or release from incarceration, and the right to make a statement to the parole board, *The right to enforcement of victim's rights. Many prosecuting attorneys' offices have a victim's rights officer or multiple employees who assist victims of crime during and after a prosecution. A crime victim who is seeking compensation or restitution should submit a timely claim for compensation to the probation department or prosecuting attorney, along with documentation in support of the claim, in order to ensure that the amounts are included in a restitution order when the defendant is sentenced. =U.S. victims' rights organizations= National Crime Victim Law Institute National Crime Victim Law Institute (NCVLI) is a national non-profit legal advocacy organization based at the Lewis & Clark Law School in Portland, Oregon. The organization was founded in 1997 by Professor Doug Beloof. It seeks to enhance victims' rights through a combination of legal advocacy, training and education, and public policy work. NCVLI also hosts an annual 2-day Crime Victim Law conference, and maintains a Victim Law Library, which contains laws and educational resources related to victims rights. National Alliance of Victims' Rights Attorneys (NAVRA) NAVRA is a membership alliance of attorneys and advocates dedicated to the promotion of crime victims' rights. It is a project of the National Crime Victim Law Institute. Membership in NAVRA provides access to expert services for crime victims, including a searchable database of case summaries, amicus briefs, and sample pleadings, as well as a directory of victims' rights professionals.navra.org National Organization for Victim Assistance (NOVA) NOVAtrynova.org is a private non-profit organization dedicated to promoting rights and services for victims of crime. Founded in 1975, NOVA is the oldest national victims rights organization. The organization is focused both on national advocacy and on providing direct services to victims. National Center for Victims of Crime National Center for Victims of Crime is a nonprofit organization based in Arlington, Virginia, that advocates for victims' rights.\\"About Us\\". National Center for Victims of Crime. Rise Rise is an NGO working to implement a bill of rights for sexual assault victims.  Europe  = European Union = The Stockholm programme explicitly mentions gender-based violence victims in Sect. 2.3.4, stating that victims of this kind are particularly vulnerable, and therefore in need of special support and legal protection by the state. Victims of gender-based or domestic violence are entitled to the same protections as those who become victims of crime in an EU member state to which they are not nationals, as these kinds of victims are deemed to be more vulnerable and/or exposed to further harm. Victims of terrorism are also deemed to be in need.  Directive 2012/29/EU  The goal specifically for the Directive 2012/29/EU, as stated by the European Union (EU), was to \\"improve the real, day to-day situation of millions of victims of crime across Europe to the greatest extent possible\\". The EU's efforts to increase freedom of movement between states has resulted in a growing concern for maintaining the rights of citizens of the EU when visiting a different member state. The EU deemed that the most important way to solve this was to clearly outline the rights of victims, to strengthen and increase victims' rights as well as increase participation of victims in criminal proceedings. = Austria = Austria has established protections for Victims of Crime that reside in the EEA Area (EU countries as well as Norway, Lichtenstein and Iceland) or those that are Austrian citizens or permanent residents. Victim services include free access to legal advice and representation, counselling and monetary compensation. Monetary compensation however is capped and is only available to victims of serious crimes, which is defined as crimes where the offender serves no less than six months imprisonment. The compensation is funded by fines imposed on convicted offenders and other sources. Although Austria is a signatory to the Victims of Crime Directive (Directive 2012/29/EU) it has not been wholly compliant, given there is little emphasis on rights of interpretation. Applications, phone calls or emails must be made in either English or German which may hinder victims of crime from accessing services fully or understanding their rights without the help of an embassy or consulate. Another breach of the Directive involves the benefits afforded only to Austrian citizens. Austrian citizens are entitled to compensation if they are a victim of crime, even if they suffer an injury in another country, an additional protection for Austrian citizens only. Non EEA nationals have less protection from the state in Austria and must rely instead in contravention of the Directive, on Weissering which is a NFP organisation which provides services for victims of crime. Due to the limited resources (only partly funded by the government, largely reliant on donations) of Weissering, any victim seeking compensation will be means tested and assessed on a case by case basis. Emergency assistance may be available in some cases. In terms of engagement, the Austrian Government recently participated in Victims of Crime Awareness Day, promoting the rights of victims in the workplace which is an issue in Austria, in relation to employee/employer violence but also employee/client violence. This indicates that the Austrian Government is trying to raise awareness about victims of crime, specifically in areas that are presenting a current issue in accordance with the Directive = Bulgaria = Bulgaria's attempts to protect and support the rights of victims of crime are generally considered superficial. Victims are entitled to participate in criminal trials as witnesses, private accusers or complainants, with assistance from legal counsel. Additionally, legislation provides for protection of vulnerable witnesses (e.g. children, victims of sexual offences) during witness examination way police handled their matters. A recent International Crime Victims Survey (ICVS), shows that only 40% of victims are satisfied with the way police handled their matters.  Issues for rape victims  Bulgaria's rape laws have been controversial, with a number of applications made to the European Court of Justice for breaches of the Convention on Human Rights. In M.C. v Bulgaria, the ECJ held that the decision not to prosecute the rape of a 14-year-old rape victim breached her rights provided under Articles 3 and 8. The legislation enshrined a practice where rapes would only be prosecuted where there was evidence of physical force and active resistance. The court held that rape laws must apply to all forms of non-consensual sexual acts. More recently, a number of breaches of the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) were highlighted in a Committee report. The report was critical of Bulgaria's failure to provide for adequate compensation for victims of sexual offences as well as the reliance on gender stereotypes when drafting legislation.  Issues with human trafficking laws  A recent Council of Europe on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings found that no adult victims of human trafficking received any form of assistance from the Bulgarian Government. A key reason for this seems to stem from peculiarities and uncertainty surrounding the legislative framework on human trafficking. First, it has two separate definitions: one for criminalisation of conduct and one for identification of victims. The latter is more restrictive, so a person may be considered a victim for the purposes of a criminal trial yet fall outside the definition of 'victim' where support services and compensation are concerned. Secondly, Bulgaria's legislation operates solely from the perspective of Bulgaria being a country of 'origin' ‚Äì i.e. that trafficking involves the relocation of Bulgarian nationals to other countries. As a consequence, victims who are within Bulgaria but are non-EU nationals may fall through cracks in the legislation. = Croatia = The rights of victims of crimes in Croatia have been improving steadily since Croatia became a candidate for the European Union in 2004. As a result of their wish to become a part of the EU certain prerequisites had to be fulfilled in regards to their criminal justice system and human rights. Croatia, in order to fulfil said prerequisites, initiated change in their criminal justice system in relation to the rights of victims. The change instigated by the government was in the form of the Department for Support to Witnesses and Other Participants in War Crimes Trials (2005). At a legislative level, the Criminal Procedure Act (2008) increased the rights of victims both within and of out criminal proceedings and recognised victims as a separate entity in court in addition to their role as a witness and injured party. These rights include the \\"right to efficient psychological and other expert help and support from the authority, organisation or institution for aiding victims of criminal offences\\" and the \\"right to compensation for material and immaterial damages from the state fund\\". 2008 also saw the enactment of the Crime Victims Compensation Act. This act resulted in the ability for Croatian citizens to receive compensation if they have endured serious personal injury. Croatia's progressive stance can be exemplified through the recent case of the introduction of laws regarding the compensation to the victims of rape committed during the 1991‚Äì1995 Independence War. This move to compensate said victims was a display of the acceptance of the United Nations Security Council's 2008 resolution which stated rape could be considered a war crime. In line with the Crime Victim Compensation Act, Croatia's parliament, in 2015, adopted laws awarding victims of rape, committed in the Independence War, compensation. This compensation was in the form of a one off payment, coupled with a monthly allowance and access to free therapy, medical and legal services. = Cyprus = Under the Compensation of Victims of Violent Crimes Law of 1997, Cyprus outlines that a victim is a person who has suffered serious bodily harm or impairment to one's health, which is attributed directly to a violent crime, or to an individual who has died as a result of such crime. As a result of this interpretation, crimes against the person which are not considered to be violent, will not result in the labelling of anyone as a 'victim'. This fact can be seen as being particularly relevant to crimes often perpetrated against tourists, such as petty theft. This is crucial in relation to compensation claims, whereby foreign citizens are not afforded the same access to compensation. Nationals of states party to the European Convention on the Compensation of Victim of Violent Crimes are granted access to compensations, as are nationals of all Member States of the Council of Europe who are permanent residents in Cyprus. All other foreigners are not granted eligibility in regards to claiming compensation as a victim of any classification of crime committed against them. The prosecution of traffickers within Cyprus has been identified as a point of issue by the US Department of State. According to statistics gathered, there has been a 55 percent decrease in the conviction of traffickers within Cyprus. Furthermore, perpetrators are often being convicted under statutes which prescribe a much less serious penalty than other anti-trafficking laws. This decrease in convictions reflects a negative impact on victims of trafficking, who may lack faith in a system of criminal justice which does not adequately identify and punish offenders. = Denmark = When in Denmark victims of crime can access a number of services and support mechanisms to guide them through the criminal justice process. These services and support mechanisms are implemented through domestic legislation and not international law. A controversial issue surrounding Danish Victim law is the decision not to sign any European Union directive on victims' rights. One of the most influential articles of EU legislation for victims constitutes Directive 2012/29/EU, which set minimum standards for victims' rights. However, as Denmark is not a signatory they are not obligated to implement the directive. Despite this decision, Denmark still has a relatively high standard for Victims rights within domestic legislation.The Victims Compensation Law of 2005 allows Danish and foreign citizens as well as Danish citizens living outside of Denmark access to compensation for victims of crime with serious injuries. Danish police are required by law to accept any criminal report irrespective of the language used. Compensation for victims of crime is extensive within Denmark. Compensation can be given to those who suffered serious injuries and dependents of homicide victims. For medical expenses and loss of income there is no limit, whilst other forms of compensation (compensable costs) are capped at 1000 Danish Kroner, being decided by a compensation board. A time period of two years applies for all applications for compensation. Other support services for victims of crime within Denmark include free legal aid for violent crime upon application and automatic free legal aid for victims of sexual assault. For all other crimes the court will decide on free legal services on the grounds of economic situation and necessity. In addition, every victim whom comes before the system has the right to an interpreter as well as free translation of legal documents from the victim's primary language of understanding. In addition, victim support services are accessible to all residents even in circumstances where no crime has been reported, nor is there any criminal proceeding underway. This allows victims to access services and undergo rehabilitation, even in the instance where a choice is made to not report the crime. In the instance of mediation between offender and the victim, whereby the offender expresses remorse and the victim accepts the apology and reconciles, the judge and therefore the court may formally acknowledge the situation, still applying the sentence, however with a lighter punishment. This empowerment of the victim is often more necessary to provide closure than the strict punishment of the offender. Upon investigation of the alleged crime, a regional public prosecution or law enforcement officials will decide how to proceed with the case. If there is a decision not to prosecute on behalf of the police, and therefore not proceed to a court trial (closure of the case), the victim can appeal the decision before a regional public prosecutor. If the regional public prosecutor has initially decided to close the investigation, then the next avenue is a submission of appeal is to be directed towards the Director of public prosecutions. = Estonia = The Estonian citizenship report a high trust in the incorruptibility of their judicial system (74%), legislators (67%) and police (83%). By contrast, however, only 43% of victims of serious crimes said they reported it to the police, and only 17% said they were satisfied with the treatment of their complaint to police. The NGO 'Estonian Crime Victim Support Society' has been in operation for over 20 years, and released a Victim Support Handbook in 2002 that led a debate about legislation dealing with victim support issues that ultimately cumulated in the Victim Support Act in 2003. This Act was the beginning of a paradigmatic shift in Estonian criminal justice from a strongly retributive mindset to one of restorative justice, and showed a need and interest in caring for victims, as well as much more attention and real practical and material help for victims of crime. However, the NGO lacks state support and funding, and so is unable to offer high quality victim support throughout Estonia. State victim support only deals with certain types of offences with a fixed agenda and is far more regulated, making the process much more official, and leading to victims uncomfortable participating. Victims of crime of violence committed within the Republic of Estonia are entitled to state compensation pursuant to the Victim Support Act. Serious damage to one's health, a health disorder lasting at least 6 months or death as a result of a crime of violence may entitle a victim and/or their dependents compensation. A single victim and all his dependents are entitled to compensation equaling 80% of material damage as a result of the crime, but no more than a total 9590 euros, on the basis of: damage arising from work incapacity; medical treatment expenses; damage due to victim death; damage caused to appliances substituting for bodily functions (e.g. spectacles, dentures, contact lenses) and to clothes; funeral expenses of victim. = France = France is a signatory to the EU's directive on Victims' rights and had until November 2015 to transpose it. As of February 2016, it had still failed to notify the EU what, if any, policies it had implemented to fulfill this. Criminal proceedings in France take the form of an investigation and a trial. Investigations are undertaken by French detective police under the authority of the prosecutor (police investigation) or the investigating magistrate (judicial investigation). If the investigation goes to trial, victims have the right to be involved in the trial and have access to legal counsel.  Compensation  Under France's Framework Justice Act (2002), police are obligated to inform victims of their right to apply for compensation and seek a civil remedy. Police can register compensation claims on behalf of victims so there is no need to go to court.A state fund for compensation for victims of violent crimes exists called The State Fund for the Victims of Crime. This is partly funded by Criminal Justice bodies who recoup funds from perpetrators (The Reform Act 1990).  Victim resources  There a number of organisations within France dedicated to providing justice and support for victims of crime in France. The European Justice e-porta fact sheet, offered in over 23 languages, outlines a number of different ones, including the National Victim Support and Mediation Institute (INAVEM). It is partially funded and certified by the department of Justice, and aims to drive, coordinate, and promote victim support missions. The organisation's 08VICTIMS (08 84284637) helpline is always available. It directs victims towards their nearest INAVEM support office who can get the victim assistance from the relevant victim organisation. It also promotes awareness of victims rights, as well as representing victims' aid associations at national, European and international level. The INAVEM has been pushing the French Government to implement the directive, providing recommendations based on their assessment of victims' needs.  Human trafficking:  In 2012, France was found to have violated Article 4 of the European Convention of Human Rights due to its failure to provide an adequate framework to protect the rights of human trafficking victims. As of 2013, however, the Government of France was in full compliance with the required minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking. Despite this, the protection was still largely focused on victims of sex trafficking and not victims of labour trafficking. = Germany = Justice proceedings in Germany take place under the Inquisitorial System of Justice, meaning that the judge has an active role within the investigation and trial process. In contrast to the Adversarial System of trial, it is possible to have more than two opposing parties in a criminal trial, as there is not such a large requirement of a balance between the prosecution and the rights of the defendant. Therefore, the German Code of Criminal Procedure 1987 (herein 'Criminal Code') gives victims a number of rights, including the right to participate in the trial; the right to appeal after the conclusion of the trial; and the right to seek compensation for their loss.  Links with the European Union  As a founding member of the European Union, Germany is required to sign and implement to EU's directive on Victims' Rights into their national laws by 16 November 2015. The EU requires that victims are recognised and treated with respect and dignity; protected from further victimisation/intimidation from the offender or within the criminal justice proceedings; receive appropriate support and have access to compensation. Germany's Criminal Code has not been amended since April 2014, therefore nothing has been further implicated. However it is clear that Germany's Criminal Code already satisfies the EU requirements through their extensive rights and protections of the victim, entrenched within their Criminal Code.  Legal representative for victims in the trial  Unlike many other jurisdictions, Part Five of the Criminal Code allows victims of crime to participate in the criminal proceedings against the accused. For victims of personal offences such as defamation; bodily injury; and property damage,For full list, see s 374 German Code of Criminal Procedure victims are automatically entitled to engage a Private Accessory Prosecutor ('PAP') who will represent their interests at trial. For victims of crime not mentioned in s 374 of the Criminal Code, permission can be sought from the Public Prosecution Office ('PPO'). The Criminal CodeGerman Code of Criminal Procedure 1987, s 385 rules that the status of the PAP is that of the PPO in the preferred public charge, meaning they are able to participate to the same extent and be heard in the proceedings on the private charges. Furthermore, the PAP is entitled to a period of one week between summons and the main hearing and holds the right to inspect the files through an attorney. Furthermore, should victim's not be eligible for PAP or choose not to do so, they have the right to engage a legal representative as a witness to uphold their interests when, for example, they are being questions as a witness at the main trial.Braun, K 2014, 'Legal Representatives for Sexual Assault Victims ‚Äì Possibilities for Law Reform?', Current Issues in Criminal Justice, Vol 25, No 3, p 828.  Victims' opportunity to appeal the judgment  PAP in principle, are entitled to appeal a judgement on grounds of fact and law only. However, an appeal by a PAP will be rejected should it be solely on account of leniency of the sentence. Part three in the Criminal Code addresses appellate remedies and states that an appeal on fact and law needs to be filed with the court of first instance either orally to be recorded by the registry or in writing within one week after pronouncement of the judgment.German Code of Criminal Procedure 1987, Chapter 3, s 314 A PAP may withdraw at any stage throughout the proceedings but needs to consented by the defendant after the commencement of their examination of the main hearing. The PAP would be deemed to have withdrawn charges, if an appeal on the fact and law was filed by them, this would immediately be dismissed.German Code of Criminal Procedure 1987, s 391 Once the PAP withdraws, it may not be brought back a second time.German Code of Criminal Procedure 1987, s 392 However, it is important to note that the PAP may demand restoration of the 'status quo ante' (previously existing state of affairs) within one week after the default subject to the conditions specified in sections 44 and 45.  Victims' compensation  Germany has a compensation program for victims of violent or personal crimes. A police report needs to be filed within a year in order to be eligible for compensation. According to the Crimes Victims Compensation Act (1985), all European Union citizens from foreign member states are also eligible for financial compensation. This covers special compensatory damages (out of pocket expenses), such as loss of earnings and medical expenses. However, it does not cover general damages which are non-monetary for example, mental anguish, pain and suffering. = Greece = In Greece, you are considered a victim if you have suffered damage (either personal injury or harm to/loss of property) as a result of an incident that constitutes a crime under national law. The motivation behind the Directive 2012/29/EU, effectively setting a minimum standard for victims rights, is illustrated by the case of Robbie Hughes in 2008, a victim of a serious attack in Greece who was left with no support or advice. The EU Member States (except Denmark) were required to implement the Directive into national law by 16 November 2015. However, Greece is one of the 16 countries facing infringement proceedings for the non- communication of the Directive. In Greece, victims of crime enjoy rights before, during and after the trial process. In certain circumstances, such cases where the victim is a minor or has suffered sexual abuse, victims are afforded additional rights, support and protection. There is no discrimination by support services against foreigners.http://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/fra_uploads/country-study- victim-support-services-el.pdf Foreign victims are entitled to an interpreter when testifying to the police. However, Greece has been criticised for its lack of upholding minority victims rights and its failure in remedying human rights in cases of hate crime. In order to file a complaint, the current law requires the payment of a fee, dissuading victims of hate crime from reporting offences. This deficiency is exacerbated by the lack of protection for undocumented migrants experiencing hate crime. Demonstrating the limited victim status of migrants and minority groups members is the inadequacy of support where such groups are victims of police abuse. Greece has been condemned by the European Court of Human Rights 11 times for the misuse of weapons by police and the subsequent absence of effective investigations. Migrants or members of minority groups were victims in ten of these incidents. Compensation for victims of intentional crimes of violence in Greece For victims of domestic violence and other intentional crimes such as child abuse, if the offender lacks the means to provide compensation for their crime(s), or if the offender remains anonymous, the state of Greece, under the Compensation Directive 2004/80/EC is obliged to provide compensation to victims of intentional crimes of violence. The compensation provided by the perpetrator or the state of Greece must cover financial losses associated with physical damage resulting from the violent crime, this includes medical fees, loss of income and funeral costs. However, psychological damage and trauma resulting from the crime are not compensated. Victims of crime in Greece have five days to report the crime; if the crime is not reported in this timeframe, victims are not eligible for compensation. An application form is required for processing compensation claims, and this is to be completed in Greek. The Hellenic Compensation Authority processes claims for compensation. Support services available to victims of crimes in Greece There are a number of services available to victims of crime in Greece. These include: EKKA ‚Äìdomestic violence and racist attacks Association for Minors' Protection, NGOs: Hamogelo tou Paidiou, Arsis‚Äì social service for children = Hungary = In Hungary there is a general lack of understanding in how to combat and prevent domestic violence. This often stems from cultural ideas about women in Hungarian society and the idea that some amount of violence is inevitable. Until new legislation was introduced in 2013, Domestic Violence was not categorized as a separate offence from other assaults. This means that victims of domestic violence in Hungary were accosted the same rights as victims from a range of circumstances. According to Human Rights Watch, \\"authorities [often] told victims that extreme physical violence‚Ä¶should be considered light, and not sufficiently serious to trigger an investigation. However, in other cases when women reported the abuse to the police, the alleged offenders were taken into custody but, quite often released instantaneously without being taken to court. This highlights a lack of support from the police and the courts in combating domestic violence. In many instances, it is the responsibility of the victim, not the prosecution or the police to start a course of legal action which hinders effective remedies of domestic violence. In the ECtHR case Kalucza vs. Hungary 2012, the applicant complained that the Hungarian authorities had failed to protect her abuse from her husband in her home. The ECtHR concluded that Article 8 (right to respect for private life and family life) had been abused by Hungarian authorities.http://echr.coe.int/Documents/FS_Domestic_Violence_ENG.pdf After the changes in 2013 however, harsher penalties were introduced for perpetrators of domestic violence. At this time as well, the onus was placed upon the prosecution and not the victim to pursue legal action. This increased the rights of the victims within Hungary in relation to domestic abuse. In spite of these changes however, an instance of domestic violence will only be considered if there have been two separate instances of abuse. Furthermore, the amendments only protected partners who were living together and neglected to protect those who were not living in the same residence. The new legislation is also lacking in a plan of a National level that could effectively combat domestic violence as an issue. Procedures have been put in place to help police respond to instances of domestic violence however, no such guidelines exist for judges, prosecutors, social workers and healthcare workers. Ultimately the provisions are not strong enough to deal with the issue sufficiently they are also not accepted and applied. Hungary also did not sign up to the Istanbul Convention, a practical convention aimed at combating domestic violence. It concluded that countries should \\"establish hotlines, shelters, medical and foreign services, counselling and legal aid\\" in order to protect abused women. = Ireland = Following the introduction of the directive on victims rights by the EU in 2012.(reference the directive) It is particularly relevant to examine the avenues available to victims in terms of compensation and legal aid, and avenues for retribution.  Compensation  There are a number of ways to claim compensation as a victim of crime, be it through a court order dictating that an offender must pay compensation to you. If you are injured as a result of a crime, you can seek to claim compensation under the Scheme of Compensation for Personal Injuries Criminally Inflicted. This would be funded through the Department of Justice and Equality and administered by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal. To seek compensation for an injury inflicted in another EU state you need to contact the compensation tribunal to gain information around how to claim compensation from the member state in question. There is no time limit to making a claim if the injury inflicted resulted in the death of a victim. if this did not occur, claims must be made within 3 months.  Eligibility for compensation  Compensation will be provided to victims, or in the event of a fatality, the immediate family of the victim. The scheme of compensation is available to you if you were injured as a result of violent crime or if you were injured in assisting another victim of crime or whilst attempting to save a life. You do not need legal representation to apply for compensation and then tribunal is not obliged to cover any legal costs. No compensation will be given to you in the event you were living with the perpetrator at the time of the attack, meaning this is not available to victims of domestic violence. In addition, the compensation scheme does not exist to provide retribution for pain and suffering, but instead to cover out of pocket expenses and medical bills. Compensation is means tested and may vary depending on welfare payments, salary, and sick leave. The tribunal also considers your character and way of life when deciding compensation level. If you are found to have provoked the injury, compensation is unlikely to be provided.  How to apply for compensation  There are a number of ways to claim compensation as a victim of crime, be it through a court order dictating that an offender must pay compensation to you. If you are injured as a result of a crime, you can seek to claim compensation under the Scheme of Compensation for Personal Injuries Criminally Inflicted. This would be funded through the Department of Justice and Equality and administered by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal. To seek compensation for an injury inflicted in another EU state you need to contact the compensation tribunal to gain information around how to claim compensation from the member state in question. There is no time limit to making a claim if the injury inflicted resulted in the death of a victim. If this did not occur, claims must be made within 3 months- to make a claim for compensation a police report must have been completed.  Avenues for seeking assistance as a victim of crime  *Ireland Human Rights Advocates *Ireland Irish Council for Civil Liberties: Ireland (Consortium Leader and Western European Cluster) Irish Council for Civil Liberties (ICCL) (1976), headquarters in Dublin, ICCL is Ireland's independent human rights watchdog, which monitors, educates and campaigns around the protection and promotion of human rights in Ireland.

Victims also have the right to oppose the Judge for the Preliminary Investigation's request for dismissal of the case and to protect their rights by having a defending counsel if necessary. Article 90 of the Code of Penal Procedure states that victims are allowed to present written memories and statements at any stage of the judicial process that indicate evidence. Furthermore, section 3 of Article 90 states that if a victim has died as a result of the crime then the power of rights as states by law are able to be exercised by close relatives of the victim. Victims are able to access assistance agencies, which have the primary objective of providing adequate compensation. The amount and source of compensation is determined by the nature and severity of the crime. For instance, victims of organized crime and terrorism are entitled to up to 100,000 US dollars from the State while victims that have experienced property or medical damage will be compensated by their offenders. Additionally, a victim with special needs may be granted of free legal aid and will be compensated by both private donations and a proportion of the pay received by convicted working prisoners from the Department of Prisons. The victims' assistance agencies also provide the option to accompany the victim at trial with their consent.  Child victims  One of the most vulnerable victim groups in Italy is children under the age of 16. Some of the most prevalent challenges faced by children in Italy include child labor, forced participation in organized crime and also becoming refugees after fleeing their own nation. Although young victims have rights explicitly stated in the Italian Penal Code, the Italian criminal justice system lacks ongoing supportive resources to protect the rights of children. The European Commission has outlined the rights of the victims and states that all victims will be individually assessed to identify vulnerability. Young victims are always presumed vulnerable and particular attention is paid to categories such as victims of terrorism, organized crime, human trafficking, gender-based violence, victims with disabilities, sexual violence and exploitation. Furthermore, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and article 609 decies of the Italian Penal Code, a child victim of sexual exploitation is to be assisted throughout the entire proceedings. Article 498 of the Italian Code of Penal Procedure states that the investigatory examination of a child in a court of law must be undertaken by the President of questions and is also assisted by a family member or child psychologist. = Malta = Following a report commissioned by former justice minister Chris Said lamenting the poor state in which victims were treated, Malta introduced the Victims of Crime Act (2015) on the 2nd of April of that year. The report emphasised the need to increase the amount of resources for the legal aid office and said that victims should be able to receive benefits from the service. The new Act provides free legal aid to victims of crime, where this was only open to the accused prior to its assent. According to Dr Roberta Lepre, director of Victim Support Malta, there are three primary focuses in the legislation: information, support, and protection. In terms of information, victims now have the right to easily access to clear information about the relevant procedures, what support services are available, how to access legal aid services, how to access compensation, and whether they are entitled to translation services. Victims also now have the right to receive acknowledgement of a complaint, outlining the basic elements of the crime concerned as well as ongoing information about his or her case. Further, if police do not arraign suspect, the victim has right to be informed of the decision in writing. When it comes to support, victims now have the right to free use of support services following a needs and risk assessment. Support services also include information on how to receive information on prevention of further risk of victimisation, and access to counselling for emotional or psychological damage. Competent authorities are also obliged to inform victims of ways in which they can be protected, such as seeking a protection order. The legislation is primarily aimed at allowing victims a greater voice, and potentially working towards reconciliation between victim and offender by decreasing the hardship of the former. For the purposes of the Act, a victim is one who has suffered \\"physical, mental or emotional harm or economic loss which was directly caused by a criminal offence\\". This also applies to family members of those who have died as a direct result of a crime. Such broad provisions allow for the benefits to be accessed by many people. It is too early to say, however, whether the new legislation has been implemented effectively. = Lithuania = Lithuania has several national mechanisms relating to the rights and support for victims of crime. The Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Police Department of the Ministry of the Interior each provide legal aid and set up measures of protection for victims of crime. As of 1996, the Parliament of Lithuania has adopted a law providing for the protection of parties in relation to criminal offences, which can be extended towards victims of crime and their families against further victimization. As per methods of victim compensation, additional provisions such as Article 107 allows for voluntary compensation for victims of crime. If this has not occurred, Article 110 stipulates that the victim can charge the offender with a civil suit, be it of a direct or indirect consequence. Further, if the offender is not able to provide compensation for the victim, Article 118 contends that the state will provide compensation in advance. In addition to these rights provided to victims of crime, there are many NGO's operating within Lithuania to provide facilities and support for victims. These include the 'Crime Victim Care Association of Lithuania'. Cartias Lithuania, Missing Person's Support Centre, Klaipeda Social and Psychological Support Centre, Child House and the International Organization for Migration ‚Äì Vilinius Office. Studies have been conducted into the physical and psychological state and needs of victims post criminalization, especially that of victims of trafficking. These studies greatly assist NGO's understanding and assisting victims of crime providing greater relief during the criminal trial process, incarceration system and return to everyday life. = Latvia = Latvia does not have a comprehensive victim support system, nor is there a single policy that suggests that the development of such a system would be seen as a priority in the near future. Despite this, the criminal procedure law of Latvia includes a specific chapter dedicated to victims. This chapter outlines the procedural rights and obligations of victims. In Latvia, in order to be recognized as a victim under the criminal procedure law four steps must be undertaken. Firstly, a criminal procedure must be initiated. Secondly, there must be information that suggests as the result of the offence the person was harmed. Thirdly, the person who experienced the harm must agree to become a victim within the criminal proceedings. Fourthly and finally, the person in charge of the criminal proceedings must recognise that the person is a victim. Once these four steps take place, and the person is established as a victim, the victim gains victim rights. Victims of crime in Latvia have access to legal aid. Legal aid is often unaffordable to victims however, as although expenses for legal assistance be reimbursed from the offender, the victim has to pay the costs upfront at the time. State compensation, for moral injury, physical suffering or financial loss, is available to victims of certain types of crimes. This includes in cases of intentional criminal offences, if the offence resulted in death, if the offence resulted in severe bodily injuries or if the perpetrator of the offence was not identified and thus has not been held criminally liable. The maximum amount of compensation is give minimal monthly wages and the amount awarded depends on the severity of the crime. In the case of the crime causing the victim's death, 100% of compensation shall be awarded.  Human trafficking  Latvia is a Tier 2 source and destination country persons trafficked for sexual exploitation and forced labour. To safeguard the rights of victims of trafficking, the government of Latvia has increased the accessibility of government funded protections, such as offering victims of trafficking temporary residency in exchange for participating in the judicial process against human traffickers. During this period of investigation, qualifying victims are offered government aid, which is 70% of the maximum amount of state compensation. Victims who do not meet the qualifying criteria are referred to non-governmental organisations for aid. Furthermore, victims who may have directly or indirectly participated in unlawful activity as a result of their trafficking can avoid prosecution. Intersecting with social services and assistance laws, the Latvian government also ensures the social rehabilitation of the victims of human trafficking. The Government of Latvia has also established an \\"anti-trafficking action plan\\" for 2014‚Äì2020 to strengthen the rights of victims of trafficking, and to increase awareness of the crime. = Luxembourg = Luxembourg has a well-developed program of victim support services through the state run Victim Support Service (part of the Ministry of Justice). It is one of only five Member States where the Ministry of Justice is solely responsible for the distribution of these services.http://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/fra_uploads/country-study- victim-support-services-lu.pdf Victims' rights are also actively enforced during the different stages of the criminal justice process, including: during the investigation of a crime, during a trial and after a trial. The state also coordinates with non-profit organisations, including through the provision of financial support, in order to assist in the development of legal reforms and to better coordinate at a grass roots level.http://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/fra-2015-victims-crime-eu- support_en_0.pdf For example, one such organisation, Women in Distress, works to provide women, their children and young girls with effective protection against violence by way of refuges and information and consultation centres. Through this process, Luxembourg has become one of only nine Member States to fulfil the Council of Europe's recommendation of one counselling centre per 50,000 women. Victims of crime can report the crime to the police or directly to the public prosecutor. Reports must be submitted in one of Luxembourg's official languages: Luxembourgish, French and German. An interpreter is available for free of charge for people who do not speak these languages. Statutory limitation periods for reporting apply. Victims are able to be directly involved in the process by acting as witnesses and providing testimony. Interpreters are free of charge and the victims are entitled to be represented by lawyers. Police must undergo a mandatory course on victimology which is partly run by the 'Service d'aide aux victims' (SAV). Police are obligated to inform victims of their rights to: (i) receive assistance from VSS; (ii) compensation for damages; (iii) receive legal aid (available on the fulfilment of certain conditions); and (iv) to be fully informed about the status of their proceedings. If the case does not proceed to court, reasons for this outcome must be provided in order to help the victim decide whether to appeal this decision.  Compensation  In the interest of justice, Luxembourg offers compensation for victims who have suffered physical injuries from crime. Compensation is only paid out in instances were victims were unable to obtain adequate compensation from insurance, social security or from the offender. In 2012, over 405,000 Euro was paid out in compensation. This exceeded the budgeted amount of 350,000. A request for compensation has to be initiated within two years of an offence occurring and is addressed to the Ministry of justice. A commission formed by a magistrate, senior civil servant of the Minister of Justice and a lawyer will then meet within an applicant to assess if an application is successful. The maximum amount that could be awarded as of 2009 was 63.000 Euros. By way of appeal, legal action against the State can be brought before the 'tribunal d'arrondissement' of Luxembourg or Diekirch.  Directive 2012/29/EU  Directive 2012/29/EU seeks to ensure that all victims of crime have better rights, support and protection throughout all of Europe. Member states, including Luxembourg, were required to implement the terms of the Directive into national legislation by 16 November 2015. However, almost 60% of these have failed to comply with the requirement to communicate the legislative texts which transpose the Directive to the Commission. As Luxembourg is one of these states, it now has an infringement case open against it.  Hotlines  The government of Luxembourg has implemented two telephone hotlines to assist victims of crime. The first, which assists victims in general, can be reached at +352 475 821-628/627. The second, directed specifically at youth and children, can be reached at + 352 12345. Further support is available online. = Netherlands = Criminal Justice in Netherlands has seen an era of reform with a greater focus placed on the rights of victims of crime. In 1987, a new victim- orientated reform was put in place in which victim's interested were to be taken into account during all processes of the criminal justice system. The reform of criminal law in the eyes of victims brought forth regulations in favor of victims' rights. Various procedural elements allow for victim compensation and institutional obligation to protect victim rights through policing, criminal proceedings and victim rehabilitation. In practice, all official institutions are subject to monitoring by the National Ombudsman. If victims of crime feel they have been unjustly treated and victim-related rules were not correctly protected, they are able to raise a complaint with the Ombudsman. In light of this, Netherlands enforces levels of state compensation, which offers a 'one-off' payment, and has been institutionalized since 1974. For further victim support, various NGO's operate within Netherlands on a local level and care for victims of crimes through providing emotional support, practical advice and judicial advice. An example of this support is seen within the nationwide agency Slachtofferhulp is partly funded by the government and gives aid to victims in specific groups and to victims of crime in general. = Poland = Domestic violence rates are very high in Poland, due to a number of factors. After surveying Polish women, it was found that as many as one in six women, from a variety of backgrounds and age groups, were victims of domestic violence. The Polish criminal justice system fails to effectively assist these victims and does not take their cases seriously. Unfortunately many perpetrators only receive suspended sentences and their female partners are often financially dependent on them and must continue to live with them. Furthermore, the authorities mistrust women who report domestic violence. Poland fails to meet its obligations under international human rights law, in relation to the rights of domestic violence victims. In order to improve the rights of domestic violence victims in Poland, the Blue Card program was introduced as a way of standardising police interaction with those that involved in cases of domestic violence, including the family of the victim. This program enables persons who have alleged to be victims of domestic violence (DV) to gain access to services in counseling, support and reparations. Assistance to Victims of Crime in Poland, 2013. (8 July 2015) Anonymous or suspicion of DV is enough for issuance of a \\"Blue Card ‚Äì B\\". A Blue Card ‚Äì B consists of a brochure detailing further actions against violence, help and support centre's near by, and is applicable to the whole of Poland. The efficiency of support centres indicates a positive increase in individuals attending victim support centre's, it however does not indicate a decrease in DV occurrence. In 2000 the Ministry of Justice in Poland sparked the notion of \\"Victim Support Week\\", connected to the International day of Victims of Crime These proactive measures are not legally regulated however do show promise in moving the Polish Nation forward to support those effected by domestic violence. General victim support centres have extended ranges since 2012 following the implementation of tasks in article 11 of the Ministry of justice Directive. Such implementation includes covering costs of heath services, medical products, secondary or vocational education, temporary accommodation and other facilities. Weak aspects still include; uneven support on a national basis in provinces that are further reaching, non-uniform project development and insufficient numbers for providing assistance, both legally and psychologically. Strong aspects however must be acknowledged, including the establishment of networks with communicative and mutual support, as well as assistance fund establishments and legal compensation. Social attitudes need to be changed in Poland, towards victims of domestic violence and the criminal justice system needs to recognise the prevalence of domestic violence, in order to hinder its occurrence and assist victims. = Portugal = In Portugal, victims of crime (both tourists and national citizens) have 6 immediate rights; The Right to Information, The Right to Receive a Statement of the Complaint, The Right to Translation, The Right to Compensation for Participation in the Process and to the Reimbursement of Expenses, The Right to Compensation from the Perpetrator of the Crime, and The Right to Compensation from the Portuguese State. A 'victim of crime' is defined as; having \\"suffered damage, as a result of an incident which constitutes a crime according to national law\\". During legal proceedings, a victim in Portugal has a limited role, where they act only to provide evidence to support the claim for damages The Portuguese Government offers several avenues of help and support for victims of crime such as; the National Commission for Protection of Children and Young People at Risk, Directorate General of Social Affairs, The Portuguese Association for Victim Support, the Commission for Equality and Against Racial Discrimination, and Open Window ‚Äì Support to Victims of Domestic Violence. = Slovakia = Slovakia is a nation where various targeted groups, particularly young women, as well as men, the disabled, the uneducated and the unemployed are commonly susceptible to the likes of fabricated international job prospects; and in turn increase their likelihood of becoming a victim of the human trafficking trade. Many Slovakian's end up being deported to highly active trafficking countries; such as, 'Germany, Austria, the UK, Ireland, Switzerland and Poland'. Slovakia is a prominent country which specifically has victims from Bulgaria, Romania, Vietnam, Ukraine and Moldova. People from these countries are then transported against their own will, compelled into sexual activity and prostitution. The Government of the Slovak Republic undertook numerous steps to tackle the fight against human trafficking. In 2005 an Action Plan was initiated to undertake steps to 'control and coordinate' the activity of the slave trade. This Action was further improved with the implementation of the 2011 'National Program to Combat Trafficking in Human Beings for the years 2011‚Äì2014'. Improvements regarded achieving an effective solution to combat human trafficking. Additionally, emphasis surrounded ensuring adequate support and care for subjected victims. This includes victims receiving 'comprehensive care' and prepare them for their return to their home country. = Slovenia = Slovenia currently has a very low crime rate (30.75 and 7.32 rapes per million people, as of 2010). Slovenia has regulated the rights of victims of crime during legal proceedings in the Criminal Procedure Act. Before this act was introduced, victims of crime were still entitled to compensation under civil law. In 2005, the Witness Protection Act, the Crime Victims Compensation Act, and the Resolution for Preventing and Combating Crime came into effect. The Resolution focuses particularly on protecting human rights and fundamental freedoms, in terms of victims of crime. Slovenia's definition of victims includes immediate families of the injured party. Victims are entitled to: Be heard during proceedings, to give evidence, to pose questions to witnesses and experts involved, to be acquainted with all rights and for the injured party, a right to inspect material evidence supplied. They are also entitled to a translator to avoid language difficulties. Slovene is the national language, but Italian and Hungarian are also spoken in certain regions of Slovenia. To claim compensation either through the criminal proceedings, or through civil suit if necessary to avoid delays. In certain criminal offences, such as sexual abuse or mistreatment and neglect of minors or trafficking in human beings, the minor-injured party is required to have a specific authority to look after their rights, and certain stipulations apply to the investigation procedures, such as preventing the offender from being in the courtroom at the same time as the minor-offender during the proceedings. Witness protection: If during criminal proceedings, the physical safety of the victim and/or their immediate families is in danger, they are entitled to the greatest amount of protection possible in pre-trial, during and after the procedure is completed. Within the Slovenian Police, the Endangered Persons Protection Unit specifically oversees the protection of witnesses under the Witness Protection Act. The Unit is also encouraged to engage with non-governmental organizations if necessary in order to provide appropriate psychological and legal assistance to the protected persons, separate from other forms of compensation they may receive. The Unit also allows for alternate measures during proceedings, for example providing evidence via video conference. These are set out in the Official Gazette of the Republic of Slovenia, as is the Code of Obligation which specifically concerns the rights of victims of terrorist violence in Slovenia. Code of Obligation regarding victims of terrorist violence: If terrorist violence occurs, the Code of Obligation states that the state, or the person who should have prevented the harm (depending on whether there was a statewide or individual failure), is responsible for redressing the harms to the victims, and liable for damages. Liability will still apply regardless of whether the person or state who should have prevented the violence, did everything they could to prevent it. These rules also apply to acts of violence that occur during public demonstrations or gatherings. For victims of crime in Slovenia, there are several websites dedicated to assisting victims understand the process for receiving compensation such as the European Judicial Network (soon to updated to the European e-Justice Portal). Here the process is clearly outlined including conditions for applying for compensation, legal assistance available and the form and amount of evidence required. Of particular concern to Slovenia's government is the protection of women's rights. In place to protect women's right under Slovenian Law are Article 14 of the Constitution of Slovenia which, \\"guarantees everyone equal human rights and fundamental freedoms\\" and \\"equality before the law\\" as well as article 53 which states, \\"marriage is based on the equality of both spouses\\" and \\"the state shall protect the family\\", article 141 of the Criminal Code \\"Violation of Right to Equality\\", as well as the 2002 Act on Equal Opportunities for Women and Men which imposes punishments on all people, especially an official who can be imprisoned for up to three years for discrimination. The Slovenian government has also established an Office for Equal Opportunities to manage Acts related to equal opportunities and engage in activities which focus on areas such as the inclusion of women political and violence against women. = Spain = Victims of crime in Spain have a number of avenues available to them to seek legal compensation or aid for the damages they have suffered. The Ministry of Justice is the state body who is in charge of awarding compensation to victims. It also is responsible for state legal aid, and has a separate department for protection of victims of terrorism-related crimes. Beyond the Ministry of Justice, there are organisations such as the Office of Crime Victims Assistance Barcelona, the Association of Terrorism Victims, the 11-M Association of Victims of Terrorism and the National Association of Victims of Violent Crime (which provides psychological assistance and specialises in aiding victims of domestic violence). These associations are all able to assist with legal aid and providing general information to people affected by crime about their rights. If you are a foreign citizen who is a victim of crime in Spain, you should contact your country's embassy or consulate as soon as possible.  Legal process  In a criminal trial in Spain, the victim can choose to participate in the trial either as a witness, or as a 'private prosecutor' ('acusaci√≥n particular') which grants them additional rights and responsibilities, and makes them an official party to the trial. If you wish to claim compensation in Spain, you must submit an application form to the Ministry of Finance, and a separate 'petition for assistance' must be filed with the Ministry of Economy and Finance. There will then be a hearing, and the state attorney will submit a report for consideration. During the hearing, the victim must prove they were legally in Spain at the time of the crime. If you are a foreign citizen and you wish to apply for compensation, then you must provide evidence during the hearing of situations where your home country has provided compensation similarly for Spanish citizens ‚Äì this is referred to as 'proof of reciprocity'.  Compensation  Compensation will only be awarded after the criminal trial is concluded and the offender is found guilty. In exceptional circumstances, a victim or the family members of a victim may claim emergency compensation before the conclusion of the trial, if their 'precarious' situation can be validated by the relevant authority. Spanish law does not provide a maximum amount of compensation that can be awarded, but determines a maximum amount for the individual based on different factors. The amount of compensation a victim or their beneficiaries is entitled to is determined based on the minimum monthly salary of the victim, and the negative mental and physical effects the victim suffers as a direct result of the crime. The financial situation of the victim, the number of people dependant on the victim, and the cost of therapy and psychological healthcare are all considered when deciding how much compensation is awarded. Compensation can be awarded to cover medical expenses, mental health expenses, lost wages for disabled victims, lost wages for dependants of homicide victims, and funeral and burial expenses. The compensation amount is paid by the offender, and if they are unable to pay then the Spanish government will cover the amount ‚Äì however if the victim's losses are covered by insurance (i.e. in circumstances of theft) then they are not eligible for compensation.  Directive on victims' rights  According to the European directive on victims' rights, Spain is showing compliance with the directives. However, information for victims of crime for citizens and non citizens can be quite strenuous to find due to specialised websites for each organisation. In comparison, the UK have implemented one simple to use website for victims of crime which makes information for victims rights far more accessible. A similar system could better help victims of crime in Spain with creating awareness of their rights. = Sweden = Various laws addressing victim's crimes were enacted from the mid-1980s onward in Sweden. In 1988 alone, Sweden ratified the European Convention on the compensation of victims of violent crimes and passing the Act on Visiting Bans Act on Counsel for Injured Party in 1988. Crime victims may be represented y a legal advisor throughout the legal process under the provisions of the latter Act. Under the 1994 Government Bill \\"Crime Victims in Focus\\" various provisions were designed to improve for crime victims. For example, The Crime Victim Fund established together with the Crime Victim Compensation and Support Authority allows the assessment of state compensation and provide economic support for research, education and information on crime victims, financed through a few imposed in everyone convicted of a crime punishable by imprisonment. Crime victims became a separate area of responsibility for Swedish social services in 2001 through the Social Service Act. Despite not actually strengthening crime victims' rights not increase costs at the time, it served as a normative reorientation of the Social Services Act towards a holistic view and right to assistance according to need.  Victim‚Äìoffender mediation  Swedish multiplicities are obliged to offer mediation, based on restorative justice principles, to offenders under 21 years old. Simultaneously, offenders are offered the chance to deeply apologise for their actions and redeem themselves. The expectation is that mediation has the potential to substantially reduce cases of recidivism. The mediation system in Sweden evolved independently from any political decision-making procedure in the second half of the 1980s. In 1998, the role of mediation in the justice system for young offenders was analysed by the Commission on Mediation which then founded their policy recommendations for legislative reforms on these evaluation studies in 2000. Mediation was formally acknowledged in 2002 by the Mediation Act (Swedish Code of Statutes, 2002:445), where the aim of mediation is explained in Section 3 as: Mediation happens for the interests of both sides. The goal is to reduce the negative effects of the crime committed. Mediation aims to help to increase insight for the offender of the consequences of the offence. At the same time, opportunities are given to the victims to process and finally in a comprehensive way integrate the painful experience. The act offers the chance for victims to express their emotional needs and have them addressed in an attempt to prevent recurrent symptoms of anxiety, self-image distortions and loss of self-esteem and self-confidence as the result of being victimised. Mediation is one of several procedural operations available to a prosecutor, and sentencing an offender to mediation may be seen as a lenient sentence where the offender benefits. Another criticism is that mediation will further violate the victim's integrity and well-being. = Romania =  Human trafficking  Human trafficking in Romania is a prominent issue. The country is used as a 'source, transit and destination country for men, women and children subject to labor trafficking and women and children subject to sex trafficking',United States Embassy, \\"Trafficking Persons Report\\", United States, 2013 meaning that various victims in different stages of trafficking are either poached from, exploited or transferred to Romanian soil. Promisingly, the numbers have been to decreasing in recent years ( in 2005 there were 2551 recorded victims of human trafficking, in 2009 there were 780) perhaps due to mechanisms such as the National Agency for Preventing Trafficking in Persons and for monitoring the Assistance Granted to Victims of Trafficking in Persons Agency, legal implementations such as Law 678/2001 (combating trafficking in persons); G.D 299/2003 (standard rules for application of Law 678); law 211/2004 (protection of victims) and G.D 1654/2006 to approve the National Strategy against Trafficking to approve the National Strategy against Trafficking in Persons in persons 2006‚Äì2010). Romania also prescribed to international legal mechanisms such as the UN Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and Council of Europe Convention on Action against trafficking Human Beings, showing that is making a conscious effort to eradicate human trafficking within the state. These mechanisms show that Romania is taking active steps towards ensuring that all individuals can live a life free from exploitation.  Violent crimes  Between the years of 2004‚Äì2011, 800 people were killed as a result of crimes involving domestic violencehttp://www.mmuncii.ro/pub/imagemanager/images/file/Proiecte%20legislative/2012-09-20_Anexa1_strategie%20violenta%20sept%202012.pdf Psychological counselling is provided to victims of attempted homicide, murder, hitting and other violent criminal offences. Counselling is provided free of charge for up to 3 months, and 6 months for victims under the age of 18. Other forms of assistance by not governmental organisations, independent or in partnership, can also be provided by way of referral.Ministry of Justice of Romania, '27th Conference of European Ministers of Justice. Victims: Place, Rights and Assistance', Yerevan, 2006, p.1 Upon application, free legal aid is provided to several categories of victims. Factors taken into account include the seriousness of the offence committed and material status of the victim. Direct victims of serious violent or sexual offences (e.g., homicide, serious bodily harm, rape, sexual perversion committed upon a minor) are provided with free legal aid. Additionally, indirect victims of such offences, such as close family members, may also be granted free legal aid. For any of the above offences, free legal aid is granted if the offence was committed within Romanian territory, or if the victim is a Romanian citizen or foreign citizen living legally in Romania and the criminal prosecution is taking place within Romania. Prior to the commencement of Law 211/2004, when a perpetrator of a crime remained unknown, insolvent, or was missing, the \\"costs\\" of the offence were incurred by the victim alone. Currently, upon application, a victim may be granted financial compensation for serious violent and sexual crimes.Ministry of Justice of Romania, '27th Conference of European Ministers of Justice. Victims: Place, Rights and Assistance', Yerevan, 2006, p.3 The birth of the National Agency for Family Protection (NAFP) has increased support for victims of domestic violence. The agency has assisted in the setting up of shelters for victims of domestic violence, recuperation centers for victims of violence and assistance centers for aggressors.Ministry of Justice of Romania, '27th Conference of European Ministers of Justice. Victims: Place, Rights and Assistance', Yerevan, 2006, p.4 = United Kingdom = In 1974, the charity Victim Support was set up in Bristol, aimed at providing help and support to victims of crime on a local and national level. Trained volunteers and employees offer free, confidential, practical and emotional support to people affected by crime in England and Wales. The charity offers support to around one million victims of crime per year. People may seek practical or emotional help, for example, making their home secure after a burglary, applying for compensation from the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority, getting re-housed, or asking for counselling through a GP. Victim Support also provides specialist services, such as: a national \\"homicide service\\", helping families who have been bereaved by murder or manslaughter, local services helping victims of domestic or sexual violence, exploitation, anti-social behaviour, or hate crime, local services for young victims of crime, including specialist support for children who have to testify in court and for recent victims of grooming, and using restorative justice to help victims. In Scotland and Northern Ireland, similar services are provided by the charities Victim Support Scotland and Victim Support NI.  UN declaration  In 1985, the United Nations adopted the Declaration of Basic Principles of Justice for Victims of Crime and Abuse of Power, which outlines international best practices for treatment of crime victims. The report recognizes an offender's obligation to make fair restitution to his or her victim, acknowledges that victims are entitled to fair treatment and access to the mechanisms of justice, and generally draws attention to the need for victims' rights in the criminal justice process. Other United Nations provisions that touch on victims' rights include (1) The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR); (2) the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination of Women (CEDAW); and (3) the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC). The ICCPR has been ratified by 172 nations, including the United States, Canada, Russia, and France. It includes the following provisions related to victims' rights: * Rights to be protected from harm, which impose obligations on governments to have effective criminal justice systems (Article 6.1, Article 7, and Article 17) * Rights to be recognized by and treated equally before the law (Articles 2, 3, 16, and 26) * A right of non-discrimination (Article 2) * Rights to a remedy and to access to justice (Articles 2 and 14) * Due process rights (Articles 9, 10, 14, and 15) In 2008, Human Rights Watch published an analysis comparing United States victims' rights laws to international Human Rights Standards. This report, titled \\"Mixed Results: U.S. Policy and International Standards on the Rights and Interests of Crime,\\" found that \\"while U.S. Jurisdictions, both federal and state, have made significant progress in recent decades, much more can be done to ensure that victims' rights and legitimate interests are upheld.\\" The report states that the U.S. should use the UN's Basic Principles as a guide to inform their laws and policies. In addition, it recommends that the U.S. adopt policies that: (1) Remove arbitrary limits on the definition of \\"victim\\" in state and federal laws; (2) Expand access to victim services and compensation; and (3) \\"Maintain and enforce standards for the collection and preservation of evidence, particularly rape kit evidence.\\" The report also recommends U.S. ratification of the CEDAW and CRC. Criticisms of the victim-inclusion approach There are three major criticisms of the Victims' Rights Movement, and the accompanying victim-inclusion approach to criminal justice. #Some claim that proposed incorporation of victims' rights will directly undermine defendant's rights, since designating the accuser as a \\"victim\\" presupposes that the alleged crime actually occurred even before this has been established to be the case in a court of law. #Some view victims' rights as impinging on prosecutorial discretion. #Some argue that victim participation will inappropriately focus criminal proceedings on vengeance and personal emotion. In connection with the last of these criticisms, it has been noted that victims seeking \\"closure\\" may promote outcomes as diverse as retribution, on one hand, and forgiveness on the other, and the legal system is inadequate to providing therapeutic satisfaction in either case. Proponents of victims' rights respond by noting that victims' rights of privacy, protection and participation are civil rights that ensure that individual harm is among the harms recognized by the system, and that such rights afford a voice in the process, not a veto of enforcement discretion. Proponents also cite the criminal courts' well-established capacity to afford rights to participants other than the defendants (such as the media), suggesting that accommodation of victims' interests is both possible and desirable.

A bolt is a form of threaded fastener with an external male thread. Bolts are very closely related to screws.  Bolts vs. screws  Bolted joint in vertical section Screw joint The distinction between a bolt and a screw is commonly misunderstood. There are several practical differences, but most have some degree of overlap between bolts and screws. The defining distinction, per Machinery's Handbook, is in their intended purpose: Bolts are for the assembly of two unthreaded components, with the aid of a nut. Screws in contrast are used in components which contain their own thread, and the screw may even cut its own internal thread into them. Many threaded fasteners can be described as either screws or bolts, depending on how they are used. Bolts are often used to make a bolted joint. This is a combination of the nut applying an axial clamping force and also the shank of the bolt acting as a dowel, pinning the joint against sideways shear forces. For this reason, many bolts have a plain unthreaded shank (called the ) as this makes for a better, stronger dowel. The presence of the unthreaded shank has often been given as characteristic of bolts vs. screws, but this is incidental to its use, rather than defining. The unthreaded grip length should be chosen carefully, to be around the same length as the thickness of the material and washers through which the bolt passes. An overly long unthreaded length prevents the nut from being tightened down correctly. An insufficient unthreaded length results in the threads extending into the hole, and places the dowel shear load onto the threads, which may cause fretting wear on the hole. No more than two turns of the thread should be within the hole. Where a fastener forms its own thread in the component being fastened, it is called a screw. This is most obviously so when the thread is tapered (i.e. traditional wood screws), precluding the use of a nut, or when a sheet metal screw or other thread-forming screw is used. A screw must always be turned to assemble the joint. Many bolts are held fixed in place during assembly, either by a tool or by a design of non-rotating bolt, such as a carriage bolt, and only the corresponding nut is turned.  Bolt heads  Bolts use a wide variety of head designs, as do screws. These are designed to engage with the tool used to tighten them. Some bolt heads instead lock the bolt in place, so that it does not move and a tool is only needed for the nut end. Common bolt heads include hex, slotted hex washer, and socket cap. The first bolts had square heads, formed by forging. These are still found, although much more common today is the hexagonal head. These are held and turned by a spanner or wrench, of which there are many forms. Most are held from the side, some from in-line with the bolt. Other bolts have T-heads and slotted heads. Many screws use a screwdriver head fitting, rather than an external wrench. Screwdrivers are applied in-line with the fastener, rather than from the side. These are smaller than most wrench heads and cannot usually apply the same amount of torque. It is sometimes assumed that screwdriver heads imply a screw and wrenches imply a bolt, although this is incorrect. Coach screws are large square-headed screws with a tapered wood screw thread, used for attaching ironwork to timber. Head designs that overlap both are the Allen or Torx heads; hexagonal or splined sockets. These modern designs span a large range of sizes and can carry a considerable torque.  Bolt types  * Anchor bolt - Bolt designed to allow objects to be attached to concrete. The bolt head is usually placed in concrete before it has cured or placed before the concrete is poured, leaving the threaded end exposed. *Arbor bolt - Bolt with a washer permanently attached and reversed threading. Designed for use in miter saw and other tools to auto tighten during use to prevent blade fall out. *Carriage bolt - Bolt with a smooth rounded head and a square section to prevent turning followed with a threaded section for a nut. *Elevator bolt - Bolt with a large flat head used in conveyor system setups. *Hanger bolt - Bolt that has no head, machine threaded body followed by a wood threaded screw tip. Allow nuts to be attached to what is really a screw. *Hex bolt - Bolt with a hexagonal head and threaded body. Section immediately under head may or may not be threaded. *J bolt - Bolt shaped like the letter J. Used for tie downs. Only the non curved section is threaded for a nut to be attached. *Lag bolt - Also known as lag screw. Not a true bolt. Hex bolt head with thread screw tip for use in wood. * Rock bolt - Used in tunnel construction to stabilize walls. *Sex bolt or Chicago Bolt - Bolt that has a male and female part with interior threads and bolt heads on either end. Commonly used in paper binding. * Shoulder bolt or Stripper bolt - Bolt with a broad smooth shoulder and small threaded end used to create a pivot or attachment point. *U-Bolt - Bolt shaped like the letter U where the two straight sections are threaded. A straight metal plate with two bolt holes is used with nuts to hold pipes or other round objects to the U-bolt.  Selection of bolt material  Regarding the requirement of the strength and circumstance, there are several types of material can be used for the Fastener Material Selection. * Steel Fasteners (Grade 2,5,8) - the level of strength * Stainless Steel Fasteners (Martensitic Stainless Steel, Austenitic Stainless Steel), * Bronze and Brass Fasteners - Water proof usage * Nylon Fasteners - it is used for the light material and water proof usage. * In general, Steel is the most commonly used material of all fasteners (90%) or more.

The growth may be with respect to weight or length (or height in humans). For example, oftentimes the body weights of animals who experience nutritional restriction will over time become similar to those of animals who did not experience such stress. It is possible for high compensatory growth rates to result in overcompensation, where the organism exceeds normal weight and often has excessive fat deposition. An organism can recover to normal weight without additional time. Sometimes when the nutrient restriction is severe, the growth period is extended to reach the normal weight. If the nutrient restriction is severe enough, the organism may have permanent stunted growth where it does not ever reach normal weight. Usually in animals, complete recovery from carbohydrate and protein restriction occurs. Compensatory growth has been observed in a number of organisms including humans, other species of mammals, birds, reptiles, fish, plants (especially grasses and young tree seedlings and saplings), fungi, microbes, and damselflies. History In 1911, Hans Aron performed the earliest study of growth after periods of undernourishment. He underfed a dog and found that it still had the capacity to rapidly gain weight, though it did not reach the final weight of a dog that was fed normally. In 1915, Osborne and Mendel were the first to demonstrate that rats fed after growth restriction had an accelerated growth rate. In 1945, Brody developed the idea of ‚Äúhomoestasis of growth‚Äù in the book Bioenergetics and Growth. In 1955, Verle Bohman was the first to use the term ‚Äúcompensatory growth‚Äù in an article pertaining to beef cattle. Mechanism In animals, homeostatic and homeorhetic processes are involved in the abnormally high growth rates. Homeostatic processes usually affect compensatory growth in the short term, whereas homeorhetic processes usually have a long-term effect. The exact biological mechanisms for compensatory growth are poorly understood, though it is clear that in some animals the endocrine system is involved in the metabolism and nutrient partitioning in the tissues. First, during nutrient starvation, a reduction of basal metabolism takes place. The gut tissues are the first tissues to be reduced in weight and activity. Then, during the realimentation (re-feeding) phase, an increase in feeding enables more dietary protein and energy to be contributed for tissue growth instead of basal metabolism. The gut tissues are the first to increase in weight, followed by muscle tissue and finally adipose tissue. Studies of growth in anorexic human patients Anorexia nervosa can have serious implications if its duration and severity are significant and if onset occurs before the completion of growth, pubertal maturation or prior to attaining peak bone mass. Both height gain and pubertal development are dependent on the release of growth hormone and gonadotrophins (LH and FSH) from the pituitary gland. Suppression of gonadotropins in patients with anorexia nervosa has been frequently documented. In some cases, especially where onset is pre-pubertal, physical consequences such as stunted growth and pubertal delay are usually fully reversible. Height potential is normally preserved if the duration and severity of anorexia nervosa are not significant and/or if the illness is accompanied with delayed bone age (especially prior to a bone age of approximately 15 years), as hypogonadism may negate the deleterious effects of undernutrition on stature by allowing for a longer duration of growth compared to controls. In such cases, appropriate early treatment can preserve height potential and may even help to increase it in some post-anorexic subjects due to the aforementioned reasons in addition to factors such as long-term reduced estrogen-producing adipose tissue levels compared to premorbid levels. Factors affecting compensatory growth In 1960, Wilson and Osborne outlined six factors that could affect compensatory growth in a review article. The importance of each, some, or all of these factors is not well understood. These factors are as follows: * The nature of the restricted diet * The degree of severity of undernutrition * The duration of the period of undernutrition * The stage of development at the commencement of undernutrition * The relative rate of maturity of the species * The pattern of re-alimenation Animal factors that can affect compensatory growth may include the maturity level and fat proportion of the animal at the time of nutrient deprivation, the genotype, the gender, and the metabolic changes. The stage of development of the animal when the nutrient restriction occurs greatly affects its body composition.

Conventionally the cylinder head is bolted to the cylinder block and the crankshaft main bearings are in turn bolted to the crankcase by separate bolts.The cylinder block and crankcase may either be bolted together by a third set of fasteners, or more commonly today, cast together as a monobloc. In the long-bolt engine however, a single set of long bolts is used, spanning from the cylinder head right through to the crankshaft bearing caps.  Origins  = Aircraft = The long-bolt design began with aircraft engines, particularly those that combined high power and lightweight construction of aluminium alloy. These early engines used long studs from the crankcase to the cylinder heads. As most at this time used monobloc heads only one bolt would anyway be needed to join the two pieces, but a long fastener the full height of the cylinder was used so as to place the tension forces into the stud, rather than stressing and possibly distorting the cylinder walls. Curtiss and air-cooled Renault engines even used an X-shaped cap above the outside of the cylinder head, with the studs bolted though that so as to distribute the forces evenly across the head. As forces were still transmitted between these studs and the main bearings by the walls of the crankcase, these early engines are not however considered as long-bolt engines. The final developments of the aircraft piston engine were the horizontally-opposed H-engines such as the Rolls-Royce Eagle and the Napier Sabre. These compact engines were tightly packed and, unlike the previous V engines, there was no access to the crankshaft or its bearings once the two halves of the crankcase were assembled. Accordingly long through-studs were used, passing right through the engine from one side to the other. On the Sabre, some of these studs were short and served only to clamp the crankcase halves together. The others passed between cylinder heads on each side. The entire tensile force across the engine was taken on these studs, with no tension being placed on the crankcase. = Diesel engines = Owing to their high compression ratios and their high bmep, diesel engines place a high tensile stress on their cylinder block. Light alloy cylinder blocks have their usual weight advantages, but these must also withstand the high forces. Some designs, such as the US Hercules, achieve this by using long through bolts. In the Hercules design these are long studs with a nut at both top and bottom; they are prevented from rotating by an eccentric collar in the middle. = Cars = In the early 1980s, Fiat invested heavily in robot automation throughout its factories, to both improve product quality and to reduce labour costs. The new Fully Integrated Robotised Engine was developed as part of this, to replace the previous range of small Fiat engines. Although taking the opportunity to update performance and emissions from Fiat's venerable 903cc pushrod engine, the primary goal of this new design was for easy assembly by robots. Key to this was the 'layer cake' construction of the new engine, held together by its long through bolts. The FIRE engine has been regarded as a success, having produced efficient and reliable engines from 769 cc with growth into 1368 cc and 16 valve versions. The 1242 cc 16 valve 'Super FIRE' also used a ladder frame main bearing carrier, giving a crankcase and block more rigid than any comparable engine in its class. One drawback to the FIRE engine was a perception by mechanics servicing them that it was now difficult to perform a top-end overhaul without also requiring the bottom end to be dismantled, with re-assembly and re-torquing in strict sequence. In the late 1980s, Rover were aware that they needed to adopt innovative and reliable new techniques if they were to survive as a car maker and, like Fiat, to throw off their previous problems of poor build quality. One result was the K engine, to be built by Rover's partner Powertrain Ltd. This used a ladder main bearing in all models, giving an extremely rigid block that would later permit a very high redline speed in applications such as the MGF, Lotus Elise and for racing. Unlike the FIRE though, and despite the large numbers sold that served reliably for many years, this engine was tarred with Rover's past flaws and gained a reputation as unreliable. The flaws that gave rise to this reputation were caused by only some components used in only some models: particularly the head gasket and wet liners. Regarding these problems with particular component versions as indicative of poor overall engine design was undeserved. Equally, none of these problems are inherent with the techniques of wet liners or through- bolting.  Advantages  For modern car manufacture, the long-bolt engine offers several advantages: * Simpler assembly, with fewer components, fewer fasteners to tighten, and fewer intermediate assembly steps. * Tensile forces are taken on the studs, not the cylinder block or crankcase. In particular, the force is a pure tension, rather than a twisting force owing to any offset between the bearing cap and cylinder wall bolt. This permits the block and crankcase to be made lighter and less stiff, whilst still reducing the amount of deflection and twist exhibited in service. * When a ladder-frame main bearing cap is used, the crankcase assembly becomes considerably stiffer. These advantages are primarily for the initial production of engines, particularly when this is a robot-based assembly. Secondary advantages may also be gained of improved service life.  Disadvantages  There is less, if any, advantage for ongoing servicing during the life of the car. Some aspects have clear disadvantages, particularly when previous simple servicing operations are made more complicated. This is acceptable because of the greatly increased intervals between major servicing for modern cars. Many cars today will go for their entire lifetimes of over 100 thousand miles without having their engine removed or dismantled. Specific disadvantages are: * The torque schedule for re-assembling the long studs may require both ends to be dismantled before a complete re-assembly from scratch. A usually simple task of removing the top-end for attention to the valves may now require the bottom-end to be dismantled as well, often requiring the whole engine to be removed. * Short-cut re-torquing practices that avoid dismantling both ends may be less reliable than an engine assembled, as intended.

It is useful for evaluating the extent of damage to the lungs. The simple abbreviation as oxygenation can lead to confusion with other conceptualizations of oxygenation index. The Horowitz index is defined as the ratio of partial pressure of oxygen in blood (PaO2), in millimeters of mercury, and the fraction of oxygen in the inhaled air (FIO2) -- the PaO2/FiO2 ratio. In healthy lungs the Horowitz index depends on age and usually falls between 350 and 450. A value below 300 is the threshold for mild lung injury, and 200 is indicative of a moderately severe lung injury. A value below 100 as a criterion for a severe injury. The Horowitz index plays a major role in the diagnosis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

This solution was proposed in 1983 by Howell Peregrine, researcher at the mathematics department of the University of Bristol.  Main properties  Contrary to the usual fundamental soliton that can maintain its profile unchanged during propagation, the Peregrine soliton presents a double spatio-temporal localization. Therefore, starting from a weak oscillation on a continuous background, the Peregrine soliton develops undergoing a progressive increase of its amplitude and a narrowing of its temporal duration. At the point of maximum compression, the amplitude is three times the level of the continuous background (and if one considers the intensity as it is relevant in optics, there is a factor 9 between the peak intensity and the surrounding background). After this point of maximal compression, the wave's amplitude decreases and its width increases and it finally vanishes. These features of the Peregrine soliton are fully consistent with the quantitative criteria usually used in order to qualify a wave as a rogue wave. Therefore, the Peregrine soliton is an attractive hypothesis to explain the formation of those waves which have a high amplitude and may appear from nowhere and disappear without a trace.  Mathematical expression  = In the spatio- temporal domain = Spatial and temporal profiles of a Peregrine soliton obtained at the point of maximum compression The Peregrine soliton is a solution of the one-dimensional nonlinear Schr√∂dinger equation that can be written in normalized units as follows : : i \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\psi}{\\\\partial \\\\tau} + \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 \\\\psi}{\\\\partial \\\\xi^2} + \\\\psi^2 \\\\psi = 0 with \\\\xi the spatial coordinate and \\\\tau the temporal coordinate. \\\\psi (\\\\xi, \\\\tau) being the envelope of a surface wave in deep water. The dispersion is anomalous and the nonlinearity is self-focusing (note that similar results could be obtained for a normally dispersive medium combined with a defocusing nonlinearity). The Peregrine analytical expression is: : \\\\psi (\\\\xi, \\\\tau) = \\\\left[ 1-\\\\frac{4 (1 + 2 i \\\\tau)}{1+4 \\\\xi^2 + 4 \\\\tau^2} \\\\right] e^{i \\\\tau} so that the temporal and spatial maxima are obtained for \\\\xi = 0 and \\\\tau = 0. = In the spectral domain = Evolution of the spectrum of the Peregrine soliton It is also possible to mathematically express the Peregrine soliton according to the spatial frequency \\\\eta: \\\\tilde{\\\\psi} (\\\\eta, \\\\tau) = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2 \\\\pi}} \\\\int{\\\\psi (\\\\xi, \\\\tau) e^{i \\\\eta \\\\xi} d\\\\xi} = \\\\sqrt{2 \\\\pi} e^{i \\\\tau} \\\\left[ \\\\frac{1+2 i \\\\tau}{\\\\sqrt{1+4 \\\\tau^2}} \\\\exp \\\\left( -\\\\frac{\\\\eta}{2} \\\\sqrt{1+4 \\\\tau^2} \\\\right) - \\\\delta(\\\\eta) \\\\right] with \\\\delta being the Dirac delta function. This corresponds to a modulus (with the constant continuous background here omitted) : \\\\tilde{\\\\psi} (\\\\eta, \\\\tau) = \\\\sqrt{2 \\\\pi} \\\\exp \\\\left( -\\\\frac{\\\\eta}{2} \\\\sqrt{1+4 \\\\tau^2} \\\\right). One can notice that for any given time \\\\tau, the modulus of the spectrum exhibits a typical triangular shape when plotted on a logarithmic scale. The broadest spectrum is obtained for \\\\tau = 0 , which corresponds to the maximum of compression of the spatio-temporal nonlinear structure. = Different interpretations of the Peregrine soliton= Peregrine soliton and other nonlinear solutions  As a rational soliton  The Peregrine soliton is a first-order rational soliton.  As an Akhmediev breather  The Peregrine soliton can also be seen as the limiting case of the space-periodic Akhmediev breather when the period tends to infinity.  As a Kuznetsov-Ma soliton  The Peregrine soliton can also be seen as the limiting case of the time- periodic Kuznetsov-Ma breather when the period tends to infinity.  Experimental demonstration  Mathematical predictions by H. Peregrine had initially been established in the domain of hydrodynamics. This is however very different from where the Peregrine soliton has been for the first time experimentally generated and characterized. = Generation in optics = thumbuprightRecord of the temporal profile of a Peregrine soliton in optics In 2010, more than 25 years after the initial work of Peregrine, researchers took advantage of the analogy that can be drawn between hydrodynamics and optics in order to generate Peregrine solitons in optical fibers. In fact, the evolution of light in fiber optics and the evolution of surface waves in deep water are both modelled by the nonlinear Schr√∂dinger equation (note however that spatial and temporal variables have to be switched). Such an analogy has been exploited in the past in order to generate optical solitons in optical fibers. More precisely, the nonlinear Schr√∂dinger equation can be written in the context of optical fibers under the following dimensional form : i \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\psi}{\\\\partial z} - \\\\frac{\\\\beta_2}{2} \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 \\\\psi}{\\\\partial t^2 } + \\\\gamma \\\\psi^2 \\\\psi = 0 with \\\\beta_2 being the second order dispersion (supposed to be anomalous, i.e. \\\\beta_2 < 0) and \\\\gamma being the nonlinear Kerr coefficient. z and t are the propagation distance and the temporal coordinate respectively. In this context, the Peregrine soliton has the following dimensional expression: : \\\\psi (z,t) = \\\\sqrt{P_0} \\\\left[ 1-\\\\frac{4 \\\\left( 1 + 2 i \\\\dfrac{z}{L_{NL}} \\\\right) }{1+4 \\\\left( \\\\dfrac{t}{T_0} \\\\right) ^2 + 4 \\\\left( \\\\dfrac{z}{L_{NL}} \\\\right) ^2} \\\\right] e^{ \\\\dfrac{i z}{L_{NL}}} . L_{NL} is a nonlinear length defined as L_{NL} = \\\\dfrac{1}{\\\\gamma P_0} with P_0 being the power of the continuous background. T_0 is a duration defined as T_0 = \\\\sqrt{\\\\beta_2 L_{NL}}. By using exclusively standard optical communication components, it has been shown that even with an approximate initial condition (in the case of this work, an initial sinusoidal beating), a profile very close to the ideal Peregrine soliton can be generated. However, the non-ideal input condition lead to substructures that appear after the point of maximum compression. Those substructures have also a profile close to a Peregrine soliton, which can be analytically explained using a Darboux transformation. The typical triangular spectral shape has also been experimentally confirmed. = Generation in hydrodynamics = These results in optics have been confirmed in 2011 in hydrodynamics with experiments carried out in a 15-m long water wave tank. In 2013, complementary experiments using a scale model of a chemical tanker ship have discussed the potential devastating effects on the ship. = Generation in other fields of physics = Other experiments carried out in the physics of plasmas have also highlighted the emergence of Peregrine solitons in other fields ruled by the nonlinear Schr√∂dinger equation.

Various groups of people attempted to approach or breach Israel's borders from the Palestinian-controlled territory, Lebanon, Syria, Egypt and Jordan. At least a dozen people were killed when protesters attempted to cross the border from Syria. On 5 June 2011, there were further protests on the border with Syria and, according to Syrian authorities, 23 protesters were killed and 350 wounded by live fire from Israeli forces, though Israeli sources suggested these figures were exaggerated. Israeli army spokesman Yoav Mordechai accused Syria of creating \\"a provocation\\" at the border to distract attention from the Syrian government's crackdown on the Syrian uprising.  15 May events Inspired by the uprisings and revolutions taking place in the Arab world, Palestinians used Facebook to call for mass protests throughout the region on 15 May 2011 Nakba Day. A page calling for a \\"Third Palestinian Intifada\\" to begin on 15 May was started on 9 March 2011, garnered more than 350,000 \\"likes\\" before being taken down by Facebook managers at the end of March after complaints from the Israeli government as well as a counter group which repeatedly requested Facebook to block the page on the grounds that it incited violence. The page called for mass marches to Israel and Palestinian Authority from Egypt, Lebanon, Syria and Jordan to commemorate the Nakba and demand the right of return for all Palestinian refugees. =Egypt= Organizers in Egypt had been preparing for weeks to implement the calls made on Facebook for a mass march to the border. On Saturday 14 May, thousands were planning to make their way toward the Rafah crossing with Gaza in convoys set to depart from Cairo, Alexandria, Suez, Damietta, North Sinai, Gharbiya, Beni Suef, Assiut, Qena and Sohag. However, an order from the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces to tourism companies not to send buses to the convoy organizers left them without sufficient transportation and the few buses they did manage to procure were stopped by the army. The blockage of access by Egyptian forces to the Sinai Peninsula, meant that only about 80 activists managed to reach the border with Rafah.Egyptians rally at Rafah for Palestinian rights .

Jordanian authorities said a total of 25 people were injured, including 11 police officers. The political arm of the Muslim Brotherhood in Jordan, the Islamic Action Front, condemned police actions which they described as \\"shocking\\" stating: \\"We condemn the attack, which is part of government policies to impose its will on the people, and we demand an end to such policies that have harmed Jordan's image.\\"Jordan police say 25 hurt in Nakba clashes . Ma'an News Agency. 16 May 2011. =Lebanon= Activists had organized an event on a mountaintop in the village of Maroun al-Ras that overlooks the border with Israel. Some 30,000 people, including Palestinian refugees from various Palestinian refugee camps across Lebanon attended. After walking up the mountain to the protest site, many decided to descend the opposite side, and continued on towards the border. Lebanese Army soldiers fired into the air in a failed effort to deter them. Crossing through a minefield that was laid by Israel during the 2006 Lebanon War, they reached the border fence, and threw stones over it, chanting for their right of return. The Lebanese army intervened and began firing M16 assault rifles and tear gas, which sent protesters fleeing back up the mountain. Eleven participants were killed and 100 injured by gunfire before the protesters retreated. There were conflicting reports of who shot them. Media reported that the protesters were shot by the IDF. The IDF said most of those killed were likely shot by the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) and that they had a video that established this, but would not release it on the grounds that it might cause embarrassment to the Lebanese Army. =Gaza Strip= Between 500 and 600 Palestinians marched towards the Erez Crossing, a border crossing between Israel and the Gaza Strip on 15 May. Palestinian medical officials said that IDF forces fired on the group intermittently over the course of a couple of hours with tanks, machine guns, gas canisters and sound bombs, killing one demonstrator and wounding more than 80. =Palestinian Authority= In the West Bank, Palestinians from a burgeoning new youth movement convened seminars on strategies for non-violent resistance to prepare for a 15 May march on the Qalandia checkpoint separating Ramallah from Jerusalem, and several of them were arrested by Palestinian Authority police in the month before the protest date. On 15 May, more than 1,000 protestors marched through the Qalandia refugee camp until they reached within 100 metres of the checkpoint separating Ramallah from Jerusalem where Israeli forces used tear gas to disperse most of them. Around 100 Palestinian protesters engaged in a standoff with Israeli forces over the next seven hours, throwing stones, as Israeli troops fired tear gas and rubber bullets. More than 80 protestors, including three paramedics, sustained injuries and twenty were hospitalized; a doctor at the hospital said the last time he saw so many casualties in one day was during the Second Intifada. =Syria= In Syria, the events were organized by phone and internet by Palestinian refugees, most of them university students independent of any political faction, in response to the call for a \\"Third Palestinian Intifada\\" on Facebook. Demonstrators gathered near the Israeli-Syrian ceasefire line waving Palestinian flags, and then marched toward and breached the fence, entering the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights. The first wave of demonstrators to move toward the fence were stopped by Syrian police who were later overtaken when a second group arrived. The sole Israeli patrol present was similarly overwhelmed and opened fire on the demonstrators. Four demonstrators were killed and dozens injured.Palestinians killed in 'Nakba' clashes. Al-Jazeera English. 15 May 2011. The Israeli military stated that it only fired warning shots when about 1,000 demonstrators approached the fence, and some 300 children among them, rushed toward the fence.Israeli forces open fire at Palestinian protesters. BBC News. 15 May 2011. More than a hundred managed to bypass the fence and enter the Arab Druze town of Majdal Shams. About a dozen members of Israel's security forces were injured in clashes in Majdal Shams. Two demonstrators were arrested and detained, but were returned to Syria.  5 June events  =Gaza Strip= In the northern Gaza Strip, dozens of demonstrators tried to march towards the Erez border crossing with Israel. Hamas police had erected checkpoints to stop protesters from reaching Israel's border and clashed with protestors, arresting around a dozen who had left a rally organized in the northern town of Beit Hanun. =Palestinian Authority= At the Qalandia checkpoint in the West Bank, around 300 demonstrated in a protest that began with about 10 people forming a human chain in front of Israeli soldiers who responded with tear gas, sound bombs and rubber bullets. After they sat on the ground refusing to leave, they were forcefully removed by soldiers in riot gear and youth at the back of the crowd began throwing stones. Over the course of several hours, 120 were injured, mostly by tear gas, but also by rubber bullets, sound bombs, and a new stink spray being used for crowd control purposes. Dozens of protesters from the northern West Bank village of Deir al-Hatab also tried to march to the nearby Elon Moreh settlement. =Lebanon= Palestinian organizers in Lebanon planned for a march along the Lebanese-Israeli border for 5 June, but following a decision by the Lebanese Army to ban all protests along the border, the \\"Palestinian preparatory committee of the return march\\" canceled the protest on 3 June. Palestinian refugees in Lebanon held strikes instead. Groups independent of the Return to Palestine March Committee still attempted to reach the border, and the Lebanese army stopped a group of 20 youths in the border town of Kfar Kila. =Syria= Naksa Day\\" Riots\\" On 5 June 2011 Palestinian and Syrian protesters moved towards the Golan Heights line of control near Quneitra and Majdal Shams. According to Syrian officials, 23 people were killed and 350 people were injured by Israeli snipers as they attempted over the course of several hours to breach the barbed-wire border. Among the dead was also reportedly an unarmed 12-year-old boy.\\"Israeli troops kill 14, including 12-year-old boy, as protesters bid for border\\", Catrina Stewart. Belfast Telegraph. 6 June 2011. Accessed 6 June 2011 According to Israeli officials, they counted 10 dead, none of whom were killed by Israeli fire. The New York Times said that, either way, this clash produced the greatest loss of life in the Golan since the Yom Kippur War in 1973. Palestinians from the suburbs of Damascus were reportedly bused into the area and massed the border without interference from Syrian troops. The IDF described this as a provocation by President Bashar Assad, that was designed to distract world attention away from the ongoing \\"slaughter of protesters\\" in Syria by Assad's troops, referring to the Syrian uprising. Israeli soldiers shouted warnings in Arabic via loudspeakers asking the Palestinians to refrain from trying to cross the frontier, adding that those who did so would endanger their lives. Israeli forces were under orders to prevent the protesters from crossing the line of control. Although no protesters managed to cross the border, the protesters thought the day was a success, as they believed that there would be outrage against Israeli troops for firing on unarmed protesters. In response the US State Department said that it was \\"troubled\\" by the loss of life, but noted that Israel has the right to defend its sovereign borders. In the aftermath, thousands began a sit-in near Golan,\\"Press Digest\\", The Daily Star (Lebanon). 6 June 2011.

Accessed 6 June 2011 Paramedics on the Syrian side of the border asked that the IDF grant them cease-fires to clear the wounded. The army agreed to the request, but then saw activists exploiting the quiet to try to cut the border fence, bringing the truce to an end. One of those killed, Ezzat Maswadi, was a Palestinian born in Jerusalem in 1977, who grew up in al- Eizariya. His father, who lives in al-Eizariya, could not procure a permit to travel to Damascus to attend his funeral. The United States lobby group the Syrian Reform Party issued a statement accusing the Syrian regime of hiring Syrian protesters to storm the border to deflect attention from its own crackdown against the 2011 Syrian uprising, further claiming that protesters were paid about 1,000 dollars for protesting, with 10,000 being offered to their family if the protester was killed. Syrian State TV reported six hours live from the incident, and it is claimed that it did not report on Syrian crackdowns during that time. Clashes broke out at a funeral for the dead in the Palestinian refugee camp of Yarmouk in Damascus on 6 June. Allegedly angered by the PFLP-GC's refusal to take part in the protests, thousands of mourners attacked and burnt-down its headquarters in Yarmouk.

It is found growing in disturbed rocky slopes above streams in moist subtropical forest at elevation. It is widespread from the Peruvian border, in the Andean cordillera, to the Santa Cruz area. The plant apparently needs disturbed ground to become established, as it is not found growing in undisturbed areas. In spite of its wide distribution, distinct populations tend to be very small, typically only one to ten plants. Observed plants, both herbarium specimens and wild plants, apparently do not have seeds, possibly due to loss of its native pollinator. For that reason, the wild populations of the plant are vulnerable, though many nurseries carry the plant as of 2012. Salvia oxyphora grows to high, with lanceolate to ovate leaves that are long and wide. The inflorescence consists of terminal bracteate racemes that are approximately long when young, extending to a long spike. The corolla is red, long, with fine hairs that can be sparse to dense. The flowers are pollinated by hummingbirds, similar to most red-flowered Salvia species, thought it differs from other Salvia in that the anthers are within the upper lip of the corolla. Salvia oxyphora was first collected by German botanist Otto Kuntze in 1892 in the Corani area near Cochabamba, Bolivia, and described by John Isaac Briquet in 1896. A surviving S. oxyphora specimen from Kuntze is held at the New York Starr Virtual Herbarium.

To know whether the levels of POPs are increasing or decreasing over time, information on environmental and human exposure levels of these chemicals should enable detection of trends. GMP looks at background levels of POPs at locations not influenced by local sources, such as ‚Äòhot spots‚Äô. For human sampling, the focus is on the general population rather than on individuals who may have suffered high exposure to POPs.  Scope and implementation  The programme covers 22 POPs listed under the Stockholm Convention. It provides a harmonized framework for the collection of comparable measurement data in air, human milk and blood and other media. The monitoring plan provides guidance on how information is to be collected, analyzed, statistically treated, and reported. Ambient air, and human milk and blood are used as core media for the sampling and analysis of POPs. Open ocean and coastal waters and large lakes serve as core media for sampling perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), its salts and perfluorooctane sulfonyl fluoride (PFOS-F). Monitoring data under the GMP are derived from existing international and regional programmes and activities, existing national programmes and activities, and national or regional arrangements and through capacity-building activities. National data are mostly available in developed countries, while capacity building projects and partnerships support data collection in developing countries.  Air monitoring  Air monitoring data are indicators of environmental exposure to POPs. Ambient air is an important matrix because it has a very short response time to changes in atmospheric emissions. It is also an entry point into food chains and a medium of global transport of POPs loadings to the environment.  Biomonitoring  The objective of human monitoring within the GMP is to identify temporal and spatial trends in levels of POPs in humans. Biomonitoring under the GMP uses human milk and maternal blood as core media. Among human monitoring activities under the GMP, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) / World Health Organization (WHO) monitor human exposure over time in order to evaluate whether the Stockholm agreement is effective in reducing the release of these chemicals into the environment and ultimately human exposure. The surveys include human breast milk samples from a wide range of countries with large differences in food consumption patterns and environmental levels of POPs. In addition, maternal blood plasma is regularly monitored with standardized protocols such as the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP).  Awareness-raising  Human biomonitoring under the Global Monitoring Programme is a principal subject of the Safe Planet Campaign Body Burden Forum.

In a work of narrative fiction, Doyle writes from the perspective of a middle-aged bachelor named John Smith recovering from rheumatic gout. Unlike his later work in detective fiction, fantasy, and science fiction, this novel unfolds through a series of tangential, essay-like thoughts stemming from observations on everyday life. The subjects are of a ‚Äúpersonal-social-political complexion‚Äù. Synopsis =Plot= Each day is represented by a chapter. Beginning with John Smith's diagnosis of rheumatic gout, the doctor confines him to bed rest for one week; Smith conveys his dismay, then reluctantly accepts. Dr. Turner encourages Smith that the mind can ‚Äúmake a heaven of hell‚Äù and that he should set to work writing a book.Conan Doyle 2011, p. 12. They begin to debate the circumstances which might drive talent out of a man, and after the doctor exits, Smith considers the immense service a doctor contributes to the world. After many short, uncorrelated thoughts, Smith dwells on his surroundings as stimulants and companions (and his particular affinity for knick-knacks). This leads the internal conversation towards personal anecdotes and various thoughts on a broad spectrum. Smith describes his landlady, Mrs. Rundle, and observes her three children on their way home fighting over a penny. Because of this, he notes, ‚ÄúRemember that the era of civilization is but the narrow golden border which trims the dense blackness of primeval history.‚ÄùConan Doyle 2011, p. 31. The second chapter begins with the Doctor, discussing current medical topics with Smith. Left to his own devices alone again, Smith expresses hopes for Lamarckism: the eradication of disease and eventually of the perfection of the human race through education and invention. He introduces his neighbors, the Olivers: an old man and his daughter, a painter about the age of thirty. The two have fallen on hard times and Smith secretly commissions Miss Oliver through Mrs. Rundle. Smith debates Roman Catholicism as the Doctor defends Anglican Protestantism upon his return. Afterwards, a veteran known as ‚Äúthe Major‚Äù enters with a limp and grey eyes‚Äîthey converse on the tragedy of war, condemning Imperialism. Smith reveals himself as an art enthusiast, while he observes Miss Oliver paint. He then tells a joke about his poverty during the gold rush in Australia‚Äîhis friends having bought scrap meat claiming it was for dogs. This leads Smith to analyze humor, then genius, and instinct, after which he writes about the labors of writing, including instruction as well as opinion on popular literature. Looking for something to debate, Smith asks the Doctor about the ideal conditions for human life and if eternal life can be attained. This leads into his thoughts about evolution leaving the human race hairless and toothless, eventually becoming demigods. Smith briefly mourns the present plagued condition of humanity, grieving and dying. The Major enters, suited for war claiming able-bodiedness at age sixty, ready to fight the Russians advancing towards China, at which the narrator is greatly alarmed and internally states the Major's uncharacteristic over eagerness for war. Smith reflects on medicinal goal of lengthening human life compared to war, slaying for the greater good, and which is true philanthropy. Without prior notice, Miss Oliver visits Smith, revealing her knowledge of his commission through Mrs. Rundle and thanking him. Showing him the drawings, he approves cordially, though he detests them. She notes that his room is decorated with masterpieces, to which he responds that he is speculating her impending fame. He requests another picture, but she declines on grounds of her wedding the next month. Upon her departure, Smith considers marriage ‚Äúthe great female destiny‚Äîto become the supplement of a man‚Äù. His thoughts continue onto Britain's political standing among the nations of the world, the unpredictability of literary success, and the creation of man. A curate visits, listening to Smith's opinions about Jesus Christ, Creation, and organized religion, questioning if he is a ‚Äúdissenter‚Äù, then determining that he is a prideful infidel, leaving insulted. The final chapter is of Smith and the doctor discussing disease as a battle; the doctor pronounces Smith's victory. They begin to discuss leucocytes in the bloodstream when the manuscript ends. =Characters= The introduction describes the novel's loosely developed characters as ‚Äúextensions of [the narrator]‚Äù.Editors of The Narrative of John Smith Jon Lellenberg, Daniel Stashower, Rachel Foss 2011, p. 5. Their purpose in many scenarios seems to be to probe the inner workings of John Smith through action or dialogue. Some of the characters, however, became prototypes for more developed characters in the Sherlock Holmes stories. John Smith is a fifty-year-old man confined to bed rest for one week on account of rheumatic gout. The novel, being told from his point of view, consists of conscious thought as well as dialogue on contemporary topics with external figures. He characterizes himself by his activeness (a continuous reminder of his physical state) and identity as an art enthusiast and writer. A photograph of Arthur Conan Doyle in The Narrative of John Smith. The doctor begins as Dr. Turner, midway through chapter two changes to Dr. Pontiphobus, in chapter four becomes Dr. Julep, and in chapter six loses his name to simply ‚Äúdoctor‚Äù. The morphing of his name may suggest his various purposes throughout. Noted by the editors, ‚ÄúIn the name ‚ÄòDr. Pontiphobus‚Äô Conan Doyle may have been suggesting ‚Äòaversion to Pontiffs,‚Äô or Popes‚Äîi.e., the Roman Catholic Church, which he had renounced without having embraced Dr. Pontiphobus's Anglican Church instead.‚Äô Conan Doyle 2011, p. 129. Jon Lellenberg, Daniel Stashower, Rachel Foss 2011, footnote 62. Julep is supposedly a Middle English slang term for a syrupy substance used to sweeten medicine.Jon Lellenberg, Daniel Stashower, Rachel Foss 2011, footnote 90. This is his name during a debate between Roman Catholicism, of which Smith becomes an advocate, and Anglican Protestantism, defended by the doctor. In other scenarios, the doctor humors Smith in short- lived discussions oscillating between religion and disease, one example being medical research on splenic fever in cattle. He functions primarily as a friend to John Smith. Mrs. Rundle, John Smith‚Äôs landlady, is a minor caretaker of John. More than once, John equates her behavior to generalizations about the female sex. In chapter two, he recounts her insisting on using mustard to remedy his gout, relating this tendency to ‚Äúthe average woman‚Äù. Later on, he remarks after Mrs. Rundle has talked with him about her life as a widow, ‚ÄúStrange how women love to talk of what has been saddest in their loves. Even in the lowest orders a man usually keeps his past griefs to himself while a woman cackles them forth to anyone who will listen to her.‚Äù Conan Doyle 2011, p. 85. Smith, though at times frustrated, generally appreciates Mrs. Rundle's company and service. She acts as a motherly figure to Smith. Mrs. Rundle is a preliminary character of Arthur Conan Doyle, later developed into Mrs. Hudson in the Sherlock Holmes series. Smith is visited by his neighbor, an unnamed army Major, who expresses the need for war in order to exert power over England's formidable neighbor, China. Smith thinks, ‚ÄúI suppose that every country is afflicted with ultra-patriots of this explosive type. Jingoism, Chauvinism, Panslavism, Spread-eagleism, it breaks out in nasty blotches all over the globe, and a very unhealthy irritative condition it is.‚Äù Conan Doyle 2011, p. 93. This character is contrasted by a previous conversation with the same character about the negative effects and lightheartedness of statesmen declaring war. Miss Oliver is an artist whom Smith observes through his window. Although there is no personal relation, he secretly commissions her to give her a source of income due to her father's unemployment. She is an object of attention for John Smith. The Curate makes a brief appearance, drawing out Smith's opinions on the person of Jesus Christ and organized religion, exiting hotly and offended. Mrs. Rundle's three children are used in the second chapter to illustrate the nature of mankind as they fight over a penny outside Smith's window. =Genre= The Narrative of John Smith is Conan Doyle's first attempt to make the transition from short story writer to novelist. Conan Doyle expressed uncertainty in his developing abilities as a novelist as well in 1884. The introduction prefaces the style of his first writing: ‚ÄúThere is very little in the way of plot or characterisation: the work is essentially a series of lengthy reflections on contemporary debates occupying the young Conan Doyle in his early twenties.‚Äù In The Narrative, observations of neighbors outside Smith's window fuel some internal conversations, others are initiated between him and his doctor, and others by unexpected guests. Smith expresses thoughts on a variety of topics ranging from the innate goodness of mankind to then current literature. These many scattered reflections are reassembled in a number of other works throughout Conan Doyle's career. =Themes= A recurring theme in The Narrative is the idealization of science and the forces working in opposition. Smith praises the doctor for his altruistic work and discusses emerging theories for the betterment of mankind. He hopes for the near eradication of disease and criminal activity through invention and human moralistic evolution over time. This hope, from the perspective of a plagued man, becomes a continual source of hope. War and imperial power exemplifies a threat to the well-being of humanity in The Narrative. Smith's neighbor, the Major, appears a man of sixty in poor condition because of the past war, humbled by circumstances. Few days later, the old man enters Smith's room hotly, declaring war on the Russians for an event of little consequence. The event strikes Smith as one who has little regard for human life and too much patriotic ambition. This mindset is set as the enemy of medicine, a force working to revive humanity. The role and value of women appears through Smith's observation of and interaction with the characters Mrs. Rundle and Miss Oliver. Smith consistently admirers Miss Oliver from his window, commissioning her based on her observed character rather than merit. His estimation of her (and as he reveals of womankind) is based primarily upon her sexuality and place within marriage, terming marriage ‚Äúthe great female destiny‚Äù. Mrs. Rundle, on the other hand, is valuable to Smith because of her friendship and service, though she is widowed with children. Religion is a topic of debate both between Smith and the doctor and Smith and the curate. Though the doctor tends to disagree with some of Smith's assertions regarding Anglican Protestantism, he nevertheless listens and interacts respectfully. The curate, on the other hand, readily condemns Smith, leaving offended by his opinions. The disjunction between the characters reflects and describes Smith's complications with organized religion. Literary and historical background =Publication= Originally written and submitted for publication in 1883, the manuscript was lost in the mail and never recovered. Conan Doyle reminisced ten years after the fact: \\"Alas for the dreadful thing that happened! The publishers never received it, the Post Office sent countless blue forms to say that they knew nothing about it, and from that day to this no word has ever been heard of it.\\"‚ÄúMy First Book‚Äù January 1893, The Idler Conan Doyle attempted to rewrite the novel, but failed to bring this attempt to completion. Although the final chapter begins with a point of recovery and conclusion, a conversation between two men breaks mid- page, as noted in the published copy. The index notes that the rewritten manuscript of the novel is part fair copy and part working document; the first half contains copious visible editing while the latter pages are mostly unmarked. In Conan Doyle's retrospective article about The Narrative, he also wrote, \\"I must confess that my shock at its disappearance would be as nothing to my horror if it were suddenly to appear again ‚Äì in print.\\"\\"My First Book\\", January 1893, The Idler Though he would not have considered publishing this work, he continued to use quotes, character frames, and themes of The Narrative of John Smith in many of his other works, such as The Stark Munro Letters, \\"Through the Magic Door\\", A Study in Scarlet, and The Hound of the Baskervilles. In 2004, the then untitled manuscript of Arthur Conan Doyle's rewritten unpublished first novel was purchased at auction by The British Library. It was first published in 2011 by The British Library, edited by Jon Lellenberg, Daniel Stashower, and Rachel Foss. =Biographical context= At the age of twenty-three when Conan Doyle wrote The Narrative of John Smith, the narrator expressed opinions on various contemporary topics. While some of the opinions of John Smith closely mimic those of Conan Doyle, some vary significantly. John Smith reminisces about his days in the Australian gold- rush, claiming a ‚ÄúBohemian disposition.‚Äù The editors note, ‚ÄúYoung Conan Doyle was convinced that, despite his profession and his conformity to its cannons, his was a Bohemian disposition. Recounting his first visit to London, staying with his uncles and aunts, he wrote in Memories and Adventures: ‚ÄòI fear that I was too Bohemian for them and they too conventional for me.‚Äô He felt he was Bohemian by nature, living a Bohemian life in Southsea, and transferred this posture to Sherlock Holmes, who Dr. Watson said ‚Äòloathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian soul.‚Äô‚Äù Jon Lellenberg, Daniel Stashower, Rachel Foss 2011, footnote 78. Image on the cover of The Narrative of John Smith. Smith defines women by their value to a man and in marriage through Miss Oliver. ‚ÄúSo she is going off to fulfil the great female destiny‚Äîto become the supplement of a man.‚Äù He writes that unmarried women are ‚Äústill full of vague unrests, of dim ill-defined dissatisfaction, of a tendency to narrow ways and petty thoughts.‚Äù Conan Doyle 2011, p. 99. Though this one of the many sexist opinions of Smith, Conan Doyle most likely did not reflect these sentiments. After his father collapsed into alcoholism, his older sister's wages allowed the furthering of his education; he also maintained a strong relationship with his highly educated mother through letters. Editors note, ‚Äú‚Ä¶in later years [he] became president and spokesman of the Divorce Law Reform Union, to make divorces easier and less disadvantageous for women to obtain.‚Äù Jon Lellenberg, Daniel Stashower, Rachel Foss 2011, footnote 76. Many of Smith's thoughts are preoccupied with the labor of and attitudes toward writing, which seem to strongly echo personal experience of Arthur Conan Doyle. Smith writes about toiling over chapters, ‚ÄúIf the secret history of literature could be written, the blighted hopes, the heart-sickening disappointments, the weary waiting, the wasted labour, it would be the saddest record ever penned‚Ä¶Very slowly and very laboriously, with much knitting of brows and burning of oil, chapter is added to chapter‚Ä¶The articles which I sent forth came back to me at times with a rapidity and accuracy which spoke well for our postal arrangements.‚Äù Conan Doyle 2011, p. 27-29 Conan Doyle writes in his article My First Book, ‚ÄúFifty little cylinders of manuscript did I send out during eight years, which described irregular orbits among publishers, and usually came back like paper boomerangs to the place that they had started from.‚Äù‚ÄúMy First Book‚Äù January 1893, The Idler In A Life in Letters, he shares the difficulty of becoming an established author. Smith writes, ‚ÄúRobert Louis Stevenson appears to be one of the few who are capable of producing a first-class tale and who can still excel in a more sustained effort.‚Äù Conan Doyle 2011, p. 72. When Conan Doyle published his short story ‚Äú J. Habakuk Jephson‚Äôs Statement‚Äù anonymously in 1884 in The Cornhill, critics accredited the work to Robert Louis Stevenson, a comparison by which Conan Doyle was proud and flattered.Jon Lellenberg, Daniel Stashower, Rachel Foss 2011, p. 4. Though Conan Doyle was raised in the Roman Catholic tradition and attended a Jesuit school for his education, he became an agnostic before returning to spiritualism in 1916. The period in which this book was written may allude to some of Conan Doyle's personal opinions through Smith.Jon Lellenberg, Daniel Stashower, Rachel Foss 2011, p. 6. =Criticism= In 2004, Tim Cornwell reports the purchase of Arthur Conan Doyle‚Äôs notebooks by the British Library in literary publication, The Scotsman. Cornwell notes difficulty with which it was obtained from disputing descendants and the cultural significance of the work explained by professor Owen Dudley Edwards of the University of Edinburgh, ‚Äúthe book [is] a missing link in the Conan Doyle canon‚Ä¶ It will tell an awful lot about the road to his becoming the author of the most famous literary characters of his time.‚ÄùCornwell 2004, The Scotsman In 2011, many newspapers around the world the publication of Conan Doyle's first novel, some of which include The New York Times, The Daily Star, Los Angeles Times, and more. Many reviews of The Narrative of John Smith were written in 2011 and onward. James Kidd of the South China Morning Post writes, ‚ÄúThe story behind The Narrative of John Smith is more compelling than the story contained within.‚ÄùKidd 2011 Kidd goes on to explain the purpose of the novel in relation to the beginning of Conan Doyle's career. Many of the early reactions to Conan Doyle's novel are exactly this: the critical purpose for The Narrative is in its relationship to him as an author, not particularly the work itself. In 2012, Colin Fleming wrote in the Times Literary Supplement, ‚ÄúThere are no henchmen afoot, nor lost worlds to escape from, but what one will find, on occasion, is that balance between place and voice that marks Conan Doyle‚Äôs later, and better, fiction‚Ä¶ The drama of this novel is of a quiet kind.‚ÄùFleming 2012, p. 20. The Narrative shows an author's rough work‚Äîa slur of ideas, later organized into cohesive stories with compelling plotlines.

Multiple sclerosis, understood as a central nervous system (CNS) condition, can be difficult to diagnose since its signs and symptoms may be similar to other medical problems. Medical organizations have created diagnostic criteria to ease and standardize the diagnostic process especially in the first stages of the disease. Schumacher criteria were the first internationally recognized criteria for diagnosis, and introduced concepts still in use, as CDMS (clinically definite MS). Sometimes it has been stated that the only proved diagnosis of MS is autopsy, or occasionally biopsy, where lesions typical of MS can be detected through histopathological techniques, and that sensitivity and specificity should be calculated for any given criteria Context Historically, the first widespread set of criteria were the Schumacher criteria (also spelled sometimes Schumacker). Currently, testing of cerebrospinal fluid obtained from a lumbar puncture can provide evidence of chronic inflammation of the central nervous system, looking for oligoclonal bands of IgG on electrophoresis, which are inflammation markers found in 75‚Äì85% of people with MS., but at the time of Schumacher criteria, oligoclonal bands tests were not available, and they also lacked MRI. The most commonly used diagnostic tools at that time were evoked potentials. The nervous system of a person with MS responds less actively to stimulation of the optic nerve and sensory nerves due to demyelination of such pathways. These brain responses can be examined using visual and sensory evoked potentials. Therefore, clinical data alone had to be used for a diagnosis of MS. Schumacher et al. proposed three classifications based in clinical observation: CDMS (clinically definite), PrMS(probable MS) and PsMS(possible MS). Summary To get a diagnosis of CDMS a patient must show the following:Paul O'Connor, James Marriott, Multiple Sclerosis, Chapter 2, Differential Diagnosis and Diagnostic Criteria for Multiple Sclerosis: Application and Pitfalls #Clinical signs of a problem in the CNS #Dissemination in space, shown by clinical evidence of damage in two or more areas of CNS. #Evidence of white matter involvement #Dissemination in time shown by one of these: Two or more relapses (each lasting ‚â• 24 hr and separated by at least 1 month) or disability progression (slow or stepwise) #Patient should be between 10 and 50 yr old at time of examination #No better explanation for patient‚Äôs symptoms and signs should exist The last condition, no better explanation for symptoms, has been heavily criticised, but it has been preserved and it is currently included in the new McDonald criteria in the form that \\"no better explanation should exist for MRI observations\\" Influence These criteria were later substituted by Poser criteria and McDonald criteria. Poser criteria introduced the CNS oligoclonal bands into the diagnosis criteria, while McDonald criteria focus on a demonstration with clinical, laboratory and radiologic data of the dissemination of MS lesions in time and space for non-invasive MS diagnosis. All the later criteria were heavily influenced by the original Schumacher work.

He founded the Sabine Pass and East Texas Railway and was that company's first president.Edwards, Haden Harrison. Handbook of Texas. Retrieved on June 6, 2011. Military career Edwards was already a well- travelled cattle trader when the Texas Revolution broke out. He was soon elected captain of a company of volunteers which served at the Siege of Bexar. Further military service in Indian campaigns after the Revolution led to the Republic of Texas government's appointing him as a brigadier general. After the annexation of Texas, the Texas military was dissolved and its commissions no longer recognized, so when the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War subsequently broke out, Edwards enlisted as a private in Company E, Second Regiment of the Texas Mounted Rifles. However, he was granted a discharge due to disability on August 31, 1846. Politics Edwards was elected to the 1st Congress of the Republic of Texas as a Representative for a district centered around Nacogdoches. Following statehood, he was also a member of the 1st and 8th Texas Legislatures, again representing the Nacogdoches area, and also represented that area as a delegate to the Texas Succession Convention, which voted to leave the Union in 1861. Business Edwards served as president of the Sabine Pass and East Texas Railway, beginning in 1858. Construction began and some rails were in place when the outbreak of the American Civil War halted all activity. Subsequently, the rails which had been laid were taken up and used in the fortification of Sabine Pass. As soon as the war ended, Edwards began working to revive the railroad, and was in Cincinnati, Ohio in August, 1865 trying to arrange financing for it when he died. Personal Edwards married the former Sarah Forbes in Nacogadoches on October 22, 1843. Mrs. Edwards subsequently gave birth to eight children.

After the arrest of the Russian Imperial Family following the February Revolution, he voluntarily accompanied the family into internal exile in Tsarskoe Selo and later Tobolsk. He was barred from joining them in Yekaterinburg in April 1918, and was killed by order of the Bolshevik government in that July. Early life Vasily Alexandrovich Dolgorukov was born in 1868 to Prince and Princess Alexander Vasilievich and Mary Sergeyevna Dolgorukov. Career Prince Vasily Dolgorukov (right) with Countess Anastasia Hendrikova, Pierre Gilliard, Count Ilya Tatishchev & Catherine Schneider In 1907 Dolgorukov became an adjutant, in 1910 a General, and in 1914 a commander of the Imperial Guard cavalry regiment, the Life-Guard Horse Artillery unit. During World War I, he was appointed Marshal of the Imperial Court. In this position, he assisted his stepfather, Count Pavel Benckendorff, in giving military advice to the Tsar. Deeply devoted to the Tsar, on August 14, 1917 he voluntarily accompanied the Imperial family to imprisonment in Tobolsk. He was separated from them when they were transferred to Ekaterinburg. Dolgorukov was initially allowed to stay in the city when he arrived at the end of April, but was arrested by the Cheka secret police, along with Count Ilya Tatishchev, as \\"enemies of the socialist revolution\\", after maps of the region showing river routes were allegedly found in his lodgings.Helen Rappaport, p. 117 During imprisonment, Dolgorukov constantly pressured the British Consulate in Ekaterinburg to help the Imperial family, using pencil-written notes smuggled from his prison cell.Helen Rappaport, p. 34 Accused of plotting to rescue the Imperial family, Dolgorukov and Tatishchev were taken by Bolshevik revolutionary Grigory Nikulin and Cheka agents beyond the city's Ivanovskoe Cemetery on July 10, shot in the head and thrown into a pit. Nikulin went on to murder the Romanov family a week later. The bodies of Dolgorukov and Tatishchev were never found.Rappaport (2014), p. 377 Canonization On October 31/November 1, 1981 the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia canonized the Prince as The Holy Martyr Warrior, Vasily.

On September 9, 2000 Borger became the first Calgarian to successfully swim the English Channel. As a part of the English Channel swim Borger raised $100,000 for the Canadian Mental Health Association. On May 11, 2011 Borger became the first Canadian to have both swum the English Channel and to have climbed Mount Everest. The Mount Everest climb was used to raise funds for the Calgary Handibus Association; for this charity Borger raised $400,000. Borger's website states, as of June 6, 2011 that monies raised for the Calgary Handibus Association are $502,350. The combined efforts of climbing Mount Everest and swimming the English Channel placed Borger as the fifth person ever to do so; these combined events are known as Peak and Pond. Bill Borger is currently the President of the Borger Group of Companies. Mountain climbing Borger began climbing in 2000 and, from 2009 to 2011, had climbed over 40 peaks in North and South America, Asia, and Europe including Mount Rainier and Mount McKinley in North America and The Matterhorn and Mont Blanc in Europe (the highest peak in the Alps). On July 14, 2012 Bill Borger along with climbing partner John Furneaux set a new route during their summit of Mount Thor that they named, The Great Escape. This climb was also the first free climb of the Southwest Face. Swimming July 23, 2000, Borger placed third on the 26.4 km long Lake Zurich Swim with a time of 8h 52m 45 sec. September 9, 2000, Borger crossed the 21-mile English Channel. The feat took him 12 hours and 11 minutes of continuous swimming without a wetsuit.

Early career  Having taken an MA (Oxon) from Christ Church, Oxford (where he read \\"Greats\\") and an MBA from INSEAD (Institut Europeen d'Administration des Affaires), Michael Stewart joined PA Management Consultants in London as a Senior Consultant and later the Northern Ireland Finance Corporation as a Senior Executive. For a period thereafter, he became variously involved in turnkey construction projects in Saudi Arabia, international oil and gas broking and trading in liquidated consumer stocks.  Writing  In 1983 he entered on a career as a novelist and, later, screenwriter. After two political thrillers (\\"Twilight Strike\\" and \\"The 51st\\"), he began developing the genre for which he became known - psychological thrillers turning on breaking scientific developments. The first, \\"Monkey Shines\\", was adapted in 1988 into the American horror film of the same name. He published a further seven in the same genre. In 1995 he turned to television, devising, co-writing and executive-producing the drama series \\"Bliss\\" for ITV and a feature-length film for BBC-1 entitled \\"Breakout.\\" He has spoken widely on science in the arts and the place of science in the creative imagination. He was a speaker and moderator on the topic for three years at the World Economic Forum at Davos, and in 1996 he won the Grand Prix prize for the Public Awareness of Science and Engineering (PAWS).  Recent career  Since 2000, he has been involved in the development of an advanced hybrid air vehicle (see www.worldskycat.com). This revolutionary design combines the aerostatic lift of a conventional airship with the aerodynamic lift of an aeroplane to create a wholly new air vehicle capable of carrying payloads up to 1,000 tons and able to land on virtually any terrain without need of ground infrastructure. He continues to develop concepts and scripts for film and television while working on a novel set in the future.  Family  Michael Stewart married Martine Brant in 1989.

He is particularly known as a painter but was also active as an engraver, draftsman, book illustrator and sculptor. Early life and education (1933‚Äì1955) ƒêuriƒá was born on 4 October 1933, in Cetinje, the historic capital of Montenegro, then part of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, and grew up in a middle-class family. His mother, Vjera ƒêuriƒá (n√©e Kujaƒçiƒá), was a biology teacher, and his father, Ranko ƒêuriƒá, belonged to a family of entrepreneurs. His childhood years were affected by world events and by personal tragedies. During World War II, Yugoslavia endured Italian and German occupation, while the local Partisans initiated a resistance that led to the emergence of Tito's Yugoslavia. At the age of 11, ƒêuriƒá lost his mother in a country still coping with the wounds of war. He then temporarily moved to Slovenia to be put up by a maternal uncle. Although uninterested in general education, ƒêuriƒá developed a strong interest in art and displayed early creative skills. His family supported him to develop his talent and he started studying fine arts in the maritime town of Herceg Novi between 1947 and 1951. From 1951, ƒêuriƒá moved to Serbia to carry on his education in the fine arts school of Belgrade. Arrival in France and first exhibitions in Paris (1956‚Äì1961) Encouraged by one of his teachers in Belgrade, ƒêuriƒá moved to Paris, France, in 1956 in the hope to work there as an artist. He survived thanks to small jobs and eventually was hired in a lithography workshop run by G√©rard Patrice. In the meantime and through his professional environment, he learned French fast enough to be able to meet and interact with well-established artists such as Kalinowski and Jean Dubuffet. These meetings and his showing some of his drawings and paintings raised the curiosity of artists and art dealers alike. Art dealer and former resistant Daniel Cordier discovered the young ƒêuriƒá and offered him the unique opportunity to show his work in his art gallery in 1958: Dado's professional career was launched. Dado quickly moved from Paris to the countryside of Vexin. In 1960, he settled in a former water mill in H√©rouval, Oise. This place was a haven of creation and social life until his death. During these first years in France, he developed a particularly strong friendship with Bernard R√©quichot, a French artist who died in 1961. Active years in France (1962‚Äì2010) =Painting and drawing= Dado's painting and drawing activities extended across almost six decades. His paintings are mainly oil painting on linen but he also used acrylic paint and wood or even metal plates as supports. Oil painting on linen ‚Äì untitled, 1997 Though his creative world is highly recognizable, his style and painting technique evolved along the years. While painting, he conducted a permanent search for the essence of energy, progressively abandoning details and fine techniques in favour of more colourful and dynamic compositions. An illustration of this evolution can be seen in large paintings such as Les Limbes or Le Massacre des Innocents (1958‚Äì1959), La Grande Ferme. Hommage √† Bernard R√©quichot (1962‚Äì1963), Le Diptyque d'H√©rouval (1975‚Äì1976) and L'√âcole de Prescillia (2001‚Äì2002), in the collections of the Centre Pompidou, Mus√©e national d'art moderne, Paris. From the 1990s, Dado also involved himself in several ambitious fresco projects. The four most noticeable achievements are a blockhaus in F√©camp (Normandy), the embassy of the IVth International in Montjavoult (near H√©rouval), a set of frescos in a former vine industry building in Domaine des Orpelli√®res, H√©rault and a Last Judgment fresco in the former chapel of a leper colony in the town of Gisors, Eure. Drawing had been present in Dado's creative means of expression since his beginnings. The artist initially used pencils and India ink. He also resorted to mixed techniques using gouache, pencils and India ink, realising impressive collages. =Engravings= Dado realised his first engraving (a dry-point) in 1966 in Georges Visat's workshop. He was also interested in lithography. Dado started exploring the techniques of engraving (copper-plate engraving and etching) with the help of Alain Controu in Normandy in 1967. Their collaboration continued until the 1990s. Engraving on copper-plate ‚Äì untitled, 2004 He continued a substantial work in this domain, including several years in the 1980s in the Lacouri√®re-Fr√©laut Engraving workshop in Paris and in an engraving workshop close to H√©rouval (collaboration with engraver Biel Genty). A part of his engraving work features in the collections of the D√©partement des estampes et de la Photographie of the Biblioth√®que nationale de France. =Sculpture and ceramics= Sculpture played a particular role in Dado's creation, as premises can be seen as early as in 1962 but most works were made in the 2000s until his death. In 1962, Dado's first achievement in sculpture was a pole using cattle bones collected in a knacker's yard. In 1968, Dado exhibited a Citro√´n Traction Avant car in the CNAC, Paris. The car wreck appearance was totally changed by a profusion of bones. Dado returned mainly to sculpture in his last decade of creation. In 2009 and under the auspices of Montenegro, a set of 27 sculptures Les El√©gies Zorzi was exhibited in the Zorzi palace during the Venice Art Biennale. Temporary Installation of Sculptures by the artist, autumn 2010 From the mid-1990s to 2000, the artist also explored the use of ceramics as a medium for his creation. A most noticeable achievement in this field is a set of ceramics tiles in tribute to French writer Ir√®ne N√©mirovsky. =Collection books= A fervent books collector and reader, Dado found opportunities to work with writers, poets or essayists, who most of time were friends of him. Having met French writer Georges Perec, Dado illustrated Alphabets, a book dedicated to word play (1976). After Georges Perec's death, Dado would work on a second version of the book, mainly consisting in enriched illustrations of the first version. In 1985, he worked on a series of 9 dry- point engravings to illustrate Le Terrier by Franz Kafka, at the Lacouri√®re- Fr√©laut workshop.Le Terrier; une lecture par Dado, dans la traduction de Alexandre Vialatte, √©claircissements et √©clairages de Philippe Audoin, note de Max Brod In 1989, he illustrated Le Bonheur dans le crime by Barbey d'Aurevilly published with the Imprimerie nationale. Two important collaborators of Dado were the writers Claude Louis-Combet and Pierre Bettencourt. Bettencourt and Dado produced illustrated versions of Les plus belles Phrases de la Langue fran√ßaise (1990), Voyage sur la Plan√®te innomm√©e (1990) and Les N√©griers jaunes (1995). Their collaboration started in 1984 when Pierre Bettencourt wrote a text for an exhibition catalogue of paintings inspired by Buffon's work.Pierre Bettencourt, Dado. Buffon naturalis√©, La Diff√©rence, Paris, 1988 As a son of the teacher of biology, Dado was fascinated by natural science. Claude Louis-Combet, a long-time friend, and Dado produced several books. Some of those texts were specifically written in order to be published with illustrations of Dado. Including those is Les Oiseaux d'Ir√®ne (2007), a personal tribute of both artists to writer Ir√®ne N√©mirovsky and Dadomorphes & Dadopathes, with 5 engravings by Dado, published with Deyrolles in 1992. In the 2000s, Dado worked with Jean-Marc Rouillan with the publishing of Les Visc√®res polychromes de la Peste brune, 2009.Les Visc√®res polychromes de la Peste brune, Jean Marc Rouillan Editions La Diff√©rence, 2009; . =Production design= *In 1993, Dado took part to the production design of Handel's Tamerlano for the Badisches Staatstheater Karlsruhe, direction Jean-Louis Martinoty, conductor Roy Goodman. *In 1996, Dado renewed his experience in production design with the world premiere of Llanto por Ignacio Sanchez of Stavros Xarchakos, based on a poem by Lorca, direction Pierre Jourdan, in the Th√©atre Imp√©rial de Compi√®gne, France. =Digital works= Dado realizes his first digital collages from 1996 in the printing workshop of his sister, Marija. Some of these works will be reproduced later in the Swiss art review Trou.Trou, n¬∞ 14, 2004. Several digital collages based on photographs by Domingo ƒêuriƒá were shown at the Venice Biennale in 2009. From 2007, Dado devoted himself to the creation of a website with the help of his son-in-law, a virtual antimuseum, The Dado Syndrome. Thus, he created special works for the website. As a virtual museum, the website was granted by ICOM permission to use the top-level domain for its English version in 2010.Catherine Millet, ¬´ En hommage √† Dado ¬ª, Art press n¬∞375, p. 94 The site is trilingual: French/Montenegrin/English.

Originally native of the Caribbean, she moved to H√©rouval and married him. They raised five children together. Though staying most of the time in his secluded home, Dado occasionally left his place to feed his interest in the outer world. In 1984, he was made a Chevalier of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres. Besides travelling several times to New York, he had a unique experience joining a team of medical researchers in Central Africa in 1974, spending a month with the Pygmies of the Central African Republic rainforest. Other noticeable experiences were a discovery of India in 1992 and a trip to Guatemala in 1997. Influence of these trips is reflected in paintings such as the Boukoko triptyque (1974) and Tikal (1998). Dado died at the age of 77 in Pontoise near Paris on November 27, 2010.
