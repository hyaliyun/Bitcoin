It first appeared as a six-part serial in The Blue Book Magazine from March‚ÄìAugust 1929. It was first published in book form in hardcover by Metropolitan Books in May 1930. Plot summary First paperback edition of Tanar of Pellucidar The author's friend Jason Gridley is experimenting with a new radio frequency he dubs the Gridley Wave, via which he picks up a transmission sent by scientist Abner Perry, from the interior world of Pellucidar at the Earth's core, a realm discovered by the latter and his friend David Innes many years before. There Innes and Perry have established an Empire of Pellucidar, actually a confederation of tribes, and attempted with mixed success to modernize the stone-age natives. Lately things have not gone well, and Innes is currently held captive in an enemy realm. Perry transmits a lengthy account of how this has come about, as reported by Innes's native comrade in arms Tanar, and appeals for aid from the outer world. Tanar's narrative comprises the bulk of the novel. Innes had led an army to the relief of the member tribe of Thuria and the remnants of the Empire's former foes, the reptilian Mahars. Both had been attacked by a previously unknown people, the Korsars (corsairs), the scourge of the internal seas. These, it is eventually learned, are the descendants of outer world Moorish pirates who had penetrated Pellucidar centuries before through a natural polar opening connecting the outer and inner worlds. The empire's forces succeed in repulsing the Korsars, but the raiders retain as hostage Tanar, son of Innes‚Äô ally Ghak of Sari. They hope to trade him for the secret of the empire's superior weaponry. Leaving his forces to construct ships to counter the enemy fleet, Innes and his comrade Ja of Anoroc set out alone to rescue Tanar, guided by their own prisoner, the Korsar Fitt. On the enemy flagship Tanar is interrogated by the Cid, leader of the Korsars, and his ugly henchman Bohar the Bloody. The young warrior also encounters Stellara, supposedly the Cid's daughter, who attempts to intercede on behalf of Tanar and his fellow captives. A storm destroys the ship, and the crew takes to the lifeboats, leaving Tanar and Stellara adrift on the wreckage. Stellara confides to him that she is not really a Korsar, as her mother Allara was stolen by the Cid from the native island of Amiocap and she bears a birthmark proving she is actually the daughter of Fedol, her mother's former mate. Eventually the derelict ship drifts to Amiocap itself, but the island's suspicious inhabitants take the two for Korsar spies and imprison them in the village of Lar. Escaping, they by chance encounter Fedol, who recognizes Stellara by her birthmark and gives them refuge in his own village of Peraht. But Bohar's group of Korsars attacks Peraht and kidnaps Stellara, while Tanar falls prey to the Coripies, a cannibalistic subterranean race. Escaping again, Tanar kills Bohar and frees Stellara, to whom he avows his love. Their joy is short-lived, as she is then abducted by Jude of the nearby island of Hime, who had shared Tanar's captivity among the Coripies. Tanar pursues them to Hime, where they are overtaken by Bohar's crew. Seeing Tanar with Gura, a girl of Hime who has developed a crush on him, Stellara rejects him and reassumes her former role among the Korsars; Tanar and Gura are taken in chains across the ocean to the Korsar city. There Tanar finds himself a fellow prisoner with David Innes and Ja of Anoroc, whose quest to succor him has miscarried. The three feign acquiescence to the Cid's demand they manufacture modern firearms for him, and so are given greater liberty. Meanwhile, Gura has discovered that Stellara, despite her jealous anger, still loves Tanar, and lets Tanar know. The party plans its escape and flees north with the reconciled Stellara. After confirming the existence of the polar opening they turn south again, bound for Sari, only to encounter a large party of pursuing Korsars, at which they split up in an attempt to ensure some at least can carry word back to the empire. Stellara, Tanar and Innes are recaptured, and the latter two each confined solitarily in lightless, snake- infested cells. Tanar, in his cell, eventually locates the opening through which the snakes enter, widens it, and achieves freedom. He locates Stellara in a heated faceoff with Bulf, the Korsar to whom the Cid has promised her; she swears to kill him and herself both rather than submit. Tanar intervenes and dispatches Bulf. He and his lover then leave the city in Korsar guise, and after many perils return to Sari, where they find Ja and Gura to have arrived safely as well. After hearing the complete transmission, Jason Gridley pledges to lead an expedition to Pellucidar through the polar opening and rescue David Innes, thus setting the stage for the sequel Tarzan at the Earth's Core, a cross-over novel linking Burroughs‚Äô Pellucidar and Tarzan series.

Each module has a temperature of over 600 degrees Celsius and delivers 250 watts at the time of manufacture. They measure 9.948 cm wide x 9.32 cm deep x 5.82 cm high and weigh no more than 1.44 kg each. Safety GPHSs are designed with safety in mind and employ iridium-clad plutonium-238 dioxide pellets. The generated alpha particles are blocked by the cladding, thus no further radiation shielding is necessary. The pellets are encased within nested layers of carbon-based material and placed within an aeroshell housing to comprise the complete module. The modules can withstand extreme conditions including a launch-pad explosion or a high-speed reentry.

During the 1980s and again in the early 2000s, efforts were made to certificate the design for series production under the name Seafire. It was a four-seat all- metal flying boat with a shoulder-mounted cantilever wing and a T-tail. The engine was mounted tractor-fashion on a tall pylon above the wings, and the aircraft was equipped with retractable tricycle undercarriage for alighting on land. Sales of plans to homebuilders were suspended after 32 sets had been sold while initial efforts were made to certificate the design. These proved fruitless but a second attempt in the early 1980s resulted in the flight of a prototype Seafire (registered N16SA) on 10 December 1982. The new entity created to handle the certification and production, International Aeromarine Corporation (IAC), expected the process to be complete by 1987, but this too fell by the wayside, and rights to the design reverted to Thurston with 85% of the process complete. In the meantime, refinements made to the design during the certification trials were incorporated into the plans for homebuilders. In 1998, a new company, Aquastar Inc was formed to revive the certification project. The Seafire prototype was refurbished and re-registered in 2000, recommencing certification trials in 2002. The Seafire was publicly re- launched at EAA AirVenture Oshkosh that same year, but the project stalled again in mid-2003.

Yudin was born on February 1, 1928 in Stalingrad (modern Volgograd). Yudin started his scientific and pedagogical activity as Uighurologist in 1950 after graduating Moscow Institute of Oriental Studies, where he completed a postgraduate study in Uighur philology under a known Turkologist Prof. V.M. Nasilov. In 1955 Yudin started his work at the Kazakhstan Pedagogical Institute in a newly opened Uighur branch, where he lectured in Uighur language the classes of ancient and classical Uighur literature, folklore and language. In 1960-1976 he lectured in the Kazakhstan State University and worked in the Uighurology Department of the Linguistics Institute of Kazakhstan SSR Academy of Sciences. Alongside the Kazakhstan artifacts, Yudin investigated from historical and philological points the richest manuscript heritage of the Uighur people. Yudin authored over 80 scientific publications in Russian, Uighur and Kazakh languages, some of them were re-published in English. Yudin studied manuscripts unearthed in Xinjiang, northwest China, including \\"Chingiz-name\\" by Utemish-Khodja (16th century), \\"Tarih-i Shaibani\\" (beginning of 17th century), \\"Ziya' al-kulub\\" by Mukhalemad Avaz (beginning of 17th century). Yudin's work \\"Clan and tribal composition of Moghuls of Moghulistan and Moghulia and their ethnic connections with Kazakh and other neighboring peoples\\" (News of Kazakhstan SSR Academy of Sciences, Social sciences, 1965, No. 3) broke ground in \\"nonconventional\\" illumination of the Moghulia state as distinct from Moghulistan in ethnic, territorial and chronological relations, state structure, and about Moghulian ethnic composition which contributed to the Kazakh, Uighur and Kirgiz peoples. Much of Yudin's research was not published during his lifetime, including his translations of sources, research on history of the Kazakhs and Uighurs and other subjects.

Accessed Jan. 18, 2016.Howard Nostrand at the Lambiek Comiclopedia was an American cartoonist and illustrator best known for his 1950s comic book stories and his 1959-60 syndicated comic strip Bat Masterson, based on the television series. Biography =Early life= This 1974 magazine cover was Nostrand's first humorous horror art since his stories for Harvey Comics' Flip in the early 1950s. Howard Nostrand was born in Hoboken, New Jersey. In 1932, his family moved to Hempstead, New York, where he graduated from high school in 1946. After working for his father's furniture construction and restoration business, painting gold leaf, scroll work and other embellishments, he attended the Art Career School. \\"It didn't teach very much of anything,\\" Nostrand recalled in 1974, so \\"I left after one semester.\\" =Comic books= In 1948, through one of his father's friends, Nostrand found work as an assistant to comic book artist Bob Powell, who drew for Harvey Comics and Fiction House. Nostrand recalled working alongside his fellow assistants, background artist George Siefringer and \\"Martin Epp, who inked, lettered and helped George on backgrounds. I started out inking and then got into doing backgrounds... and then penciling.\\" Nostrand worked for Powell on features that included \\"Red Hawk\\" in Magazine Enterprises' Straight Arrow and \\"Bobby Benson's B-Bar-B Riders\\", based on the children's television series, in the same publisher's comic book of that title, but it was the horror comics that Harvey would begin publishing in the early 1950s that would feature some of Nostrand and Powell's finest comic art. For Fawcett Comics, he did work in Hot Rod Comics, an adaptation of the 1951 John Huston film The Red Badge of Courage and \\"a couple of Westerns\\", including the movie spin-off feature \\"Lash LaRue\\". Writer and artist credits were not routinely given in comics during this time; historians cite as Nostand's first confirmed full inking work the seven-page Powell-penciled horror story \\"Servants of the Tomb\\" in Harvey's Witches Tales #6 (Nov. 1961).Howard Nostrand at the Grand Comics Database Nostrand left Powell in March 1952 and found work with Harvey Comics editor Sid Jacobson. \\"I think the first job I did for Harvey was a story called 'Man Germ', written by a fellow named Nat Barnett... about a trip through the interior of a person's body. Turns out this fellow as a germ, though, and the body expires. Cute.\\"Nostrand, p. 19 Nostrand also worked on Harvey's short-lived 3-D comics, as well as on such horror titles as Black Cat Mystery, Chamber of Chills, Tomb of Terror and Witches Tales. Since EC comics were leading the way in the horror comics genre of the day, most publishers were advising their artists to adopt a similar style and in some cases outright art swipes from Tales From the Crypt and other comics published under the Entertaining Comics banner. Nostrand did a flawless imitation of Jack Davis and in one case completely redrew a sequence by Wally Wood from EC's Two-Fisted Tales but changed the positioning and layout of every panel. Wood and other EC artists praised Nostrand's work and saw that he was talented enough not to do outright swipes, but only work influenced by other artists. With the mid-1950s slump in comic books that followed the Senate hearings on juvenile delinquency and the creation of the Comics Code. Nostrand turned to commercial art. In a 1974 autobiographical magazine article, he recalled: He eventually found a staff position at the New York commercial art firm Penthouse Studios (no relation to Penthouse magazine) at Eighth Avenue and West 58th Street. Comic strip With writer Ed Herron, he produced the 1959-60 syndicated comic strip Bat Masterson, based on the television series, on which he was assisted by artist Neal Adams. In 1975, he returned to comic books with stories for Seaboard (Targitt), and Marvel (Vampire Tales), followed by more than a dozen contributions to Cracked. His last recorded comics work was the back-cover gag, \\"Great Moments in Technology: Marcus Bulovas Invents the Wristwatch\\", of Cracked #172 (October 1980). In the 1980s, Nostrand returned to the EC swipe/Jack Davisesque style he had used in Harvey horror comics of the 1950s and did several parody stories for National Lampoon magazine, featuring characters like the Old Fag Hag. Awards Nostrand won an award in the 1960s from the American Institute of Graphic Arts for his subway poster showing a cigar-puffing gangster.

Working in Oxford, London and Boston, he made major contributions to the field of neurology, such as the development of electromyography, physiology of micturition and the treatment of Wilson's disease. Biography Born in New Zealand, he studied at the University of Otago at Dunedin, South Island, where he qualified in medicine in 1924. He then took up a fellowship to perform research at the department of Dr Sir Charles Scott Sherrington, where he studied motor neuron physiology. He obtained a DPhil and published sixteen scientific papers on his research. In 1928 he took up a clinical post at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery in London, and over the subsequent years underwent neurological specialist training, as well as serving as a lecturer, at the National Hospital and Guy's Hospital. The National Hospital was at the forefront of the developing specialty of neurology, and he was influenced by some of the senior staff such as Gordon Holmes, Charles Symonds and Samuel Alexander Kinnier Wilson. In 1933 he joined the Territorial Army (TA) section of the Royal Army Medical Corps (RAMC), being commissioned as a lieutenant on 9 December 1933, and promoted captain a year later. He was appointed as a neurologist at St Bartholomew's Hospital in 1935. He spent 1936 in Baltimore at Yale University performing research with former Oxford colleague John Fulton, then returned to London to work at the National Hospital. He married Sylvia Summerhayes in 1937; they were to have four sons. He transferred from the TA active list to the reserve of officers on 5 March 1938. Denny-Brown was offered the professorship of neurology at Harvard Medical School in 1939, but the Second World War intervened, he was placed back on the active list on 9 October 1939 as the British mobilisation intensified. The next two years he worked in Oxford, and only after direct pressure on Winston Churchill by Harvard president James Conant was his mobilisation cancelled, and he was able to accept the offer at Harvard, where he started work in 1941, as well as assuming the directorship of neurology at Boston City Hospital. From 1945 to 1946 he was called again by the British army to direct the neurology services of the RAMC in India and Burma, with the local rank of brigadier, but he finally left the RAMC in 1950, and was granted the honorary rank of major. He became a US citizen in 1952,\\"Denny-Brown, Derek Ernest, O.B.E.\\", An Encyclopaedia of New Zealand and in Boston he did clinical work, teaching and training of residents, and physiological research. He was president of the American Neurological Association between 1959 and 1960, and brought it closer to the more recently established American Academy of Neurology. After his retirement in 1967 he continued basic research, mainly on the peripheral nervous system, in Boston. From 1972 until his death from multiple myeloma in 1981 he was scholar in residence at the National Institutes of Health. Works Research in 1938, with J.B. Pennybacker, laid the foundation for clinical electromyography (EMG). In 1951 he introduced British anti-Lewisite as the first treatment for the copper overload disorder Wilson's disease. This discovery was one of the first effective treatments for a neurological condition. Denny-Brown also made contributions to the understanding of many other neurological diseases. Influence Denny-Brown came to the United States in a time when neurosurgery and psychiatry outshadowed the small field of neurology. He is credited with training a large number of neurology professors, and bringing the field of neurology into prominence.

He was a batsman, a very occasional slow bowler, and a slip fielder. His Wisden obituary said of his batting: \\"Of graceful style, he showed to special advantage in cutting and hitting to leg...\\" He exceeded one thousand runs in a season on four occasions. During his time with Surrey they won the County Championship in 1894, 1895, and 1899, though only in 1895 did he make a significant contribution. He had seven elder brothers who encouraged him to join in their games of cricket from when he was only three years old. He joined the Surrey ground staff when he was 17. He made a successful debut for the county, aged 18, in his only first-class appearance of the 1894 season, in a non-Championship fixture. He scored 76 in his only innings. The following season, he played in 22 matches and scored 832 runs at an average of 33.28. This would prove to be one of only two times that his season's batting average exceeded 30. He made his first two centuries, including his career highest score of 171 against Cambridge University. He and Bobby Abel added 306 for the third wicket. In 1896 he made two more hundreds, but his average declined to 24.26. In 1897 he played in only nine matches, but 1898 was his best year. He passed one thousand runs for the first time, recorded his best average of 34.25, and made two more hundreds. However the following season he played in only four fixtures. He was a regular in the side once more in 1900, but in 20 fixtures he managed only 571 runs at an average of 20.39. 1901 was a better year, with two centuries in 16 matches, and a total of 701 runs at 25.96. However the next season he appeared only seven times. From 1903 until the end of his career, he was no longer in and out of the side but appeared in almost every fixture, even though his seasonal average never rose above the twenties. He scored 1129 runs in 30 matches in 1903, his highest aggregate, but his highest score was only 97 and his average 23.52. His next season scores were worse, with 848 runs from 25 matches at 20.68, but he did manage one century. During his last four seasons (1905 to 1908) he managed to keep his average in the upper twenties. His slip catching also came to the fore. Having never previously held more than 18 catches in a season, he now managed 30, 30, 23 and 32. In 1905, 26 matches yielded 1079 runs at 27.66, with one hundred. His figures the next season were very similar: 26 matches, 968 runs at 28.47 and two hundreds. In 1907 he played as many as 31 matches, scoring 1081 runs. Though his highest score was only 72, he was consistent enough to average 26.36. In his final season, he scored 664 runs in 21 matches at 28.86. again failed to make a century, but in scoring 87 against Somerset he assisted Jack Crawford (who made 232) to put on 308 for the fifth wicket. This stood as the Surrey record for this wicket until Mark Ramprakash and Azhar Mahmood had a partnership of 311 in 2005. Following his departure from Surrey he became the cricket coach at Oundle School. His son-in-law, H.O. Bloomfield, also played for Surrey.

Based on census data, it indicates that they are the seventh largest population of British Arabs by country of birth. =Communities= Yemenis are present across the entire UK. Cities with large and notable Yemeni populations are: * Birmingham The first immigrants arrived in the early 20th century, because they were offered work in the local metal-forming trades. However, as industry declined, unemployment rose in the city, and many Yemenis returned home. Despite this, Yemenis still have a strong presence in the city and have diversified by improving educational qualifications and setting up businesses. There are an estimated 10,000 Yemenis in Birmingham, about 1% of the city's population. * Cardiff Yemeni seamen (Lascars) first arrived in the UK during the 19th century, with many settling in Cardiff among other areas to work in the docks and associated industries or on the railway. In the 1920s, an estimated 1,500 Yemenis lived in the city, making up half of its ethnic minority population. There are no reliable estimates of the present Yemeni-origin population of Cardiff. * Hull Kingston upon Hull is also another port which saw the city's ethnic makeup drastically change in the early 20th century, although not to such an extent as in South Shields, Liverpool and the South Wales coast. * Liverpool The first Yemenis arrived in Liverpool in the early 1900s, seamen and their families. The present Yemeni-origin population of Liverpool is not known, but an estimated 400 Yemeni-owned newsagents are in the city. The Liverpool Yemeni/Arabic Centre was established by locals in 1997. Most Arabs in Liverpool are of Yemeni origin. * London Despite being the largest city in the UK and the home of the country's Yemeni embassy, it is unknown how many Yemenis live in London. Its Yemeni community is not as notable as other British locations. Many Jews of Yemenite descent live in NW London and Stamford Hill. * Manchester Many Yemenis migrated to Manchester around the early 20th century, largely attracted to the city's growing industrial base. They are located across the whole city, but one of the most noted communities is Salford, where today at least 500 people are of Yemeni origin. * Middlesbrough Middlesbrough is another industrial town that witnessed a significant number of Yemeni arrivals. The present Yemeni population is not known, but it is considerably smaller than the Yemeni population of the mid 1900s. This is due to decreasing industry, with many Yemenis either returning to Yemen or migrating to the Arab states of the Persian Gulf or the United States. * Newport The Welsh port is home to a fairly large Yemeni community that consists of several generations. Many Yemenis came to the city to seek a better life. * Sheffield One of the UK's largest Yemeni communities is located in Sheffield, one of the industrial cities that attracted immigrants to work in the many factories that were experiencing a stage of prosperity in the mid 1900s. Yemenis number between 3,500 and 9,000 in Sheffield. * South Shields Although not the largest Yemeni community in the UK, South Shields is the most notable. A wave of Yemeni sailors came to the UK in the early 20th century, which makes it one of the newest communities. Despite this, the period between now and then has seen drastic change in the town. Muhammad Ali visited the local Yemeni Mosque and School in 1977. Today an estimated 1,000 - 3,000 people of Yemeni origin reside in the city (around 2% of the local population).

Its first tenants were rehoused from an area that had been cleared during railway construction work, and they paid a nominal rent. By the late 1960s the buildings had fallen into disrepair. Thomas Street was later renamed Fulbourne Street, and the housing was demolished in 1969.  History  Originally built by the Great Eastern Railway Blackwall Buildings were started because of an obligation created by Parliament when large scale Engineering works were constructed and a number of houses were demolished, that these dwellings be replaced and the people re-housed. In 1885 the London and Blackwall Railway applied to Parliament for permission to widen their line between Fenchurch Street and Stepney. This was granted and as a result the houses demolished had to be replaced. Blackwall Buildings were the result. The Buildings were thought to have been actually built by Mark Gentry from Castle Heddingham, He had a depot in Stratford and built many similar philanthropic flats. There is no first hand proof of this, but it is highly likely from the style of the Buildings. The London and Blackwall Railway was leased to the Great Eastern Railway and all the major construction work for this line was carried out by the Great Eastern. The first mention of the buildings is in Charles Booth's Life and Labour of the People of London. In 1889 Booth surveyed the area around Thomas Street and says of Blackwall Buildings, :\\"North up Queen Ann St. 3 st. [3 storey[, rough, children very ragged, some prostitutes. Bread and bits of raw meat in the roadway, windows broken & dirty; all english: one woman called out \\"let us be guv'nor dont pull the houses down & turn us out!

(It opens at 4, it was now 1.45PM). North end of Thomas St is a gate leading to private Rd. on the West side of which are 3 blocks of dwellings called Blackwall Blds belonging to Blackwall Railway. decent class. purple. at either end is a gateway which is shut at night. The furthest gate opens on to the stoneyard of the White Chapel Union.\\" Purple refers to his classification of the state of poverty and is \\"Mixed. Some comfortable others poor\\". This gated community was at the time good quality housing and offered a relief from the poverty around. The gates were designed so the residents could not stay out late at night and get too drunk in local pubs. It was known as \\"philanthropic housing\\" as the tenants paid a nominal rent. However not everyone liked this new housing, which was open and airy and very different from the surrounding slums. In \\"Child of the Jago\\" by Arthur Morrison (1896) mention is made of the fact the slums offered refuge from the police and a place of sanctuary when this was needed. The new housing did not offer such a refuge. In 1933 the Freehold of the Buildings were sold by the London and North Eastern Railway.The Times Newspaper, 14 and 22 February 1933 This company took over the Great Eastern in 1923. The sale realised ¬£21,300 and was managed by Reynolds and Eason of Bishopsgate. At the time the rent roll was ¬£3226 for 156 flats. The purchasers were Challoner's of Kensington.London Borough of Tower Hamlets rating roll During the period from the sale until their demolition in 1969 the buildings fell into disrepair and by 1969 were regarded as slums by the residents.  Layout of buildings  The buildings were in four blocks, each four stories high. They were mainly two room flats, although one flat on each floor of each of the blocks (making 16 flats in all) had three rooms. Up to a dozen people lived in each flat according to the United Kingdom Census 1901. The flats were staircase orientated - with four flats leading from each landing. There was a cast iron range in each flat and two communal toilets on each floor. There was also a washroom/scullery for communal use on each floor. Most flats used blankets or curtains to divide the beds within a room for privacy. Bedbugs were rife as were other forms of vermin. It is thought they lived in the lathe and plaster walls.Roy Lapidge - whose mother lived at the Buildings  Notable residents  =Mary Hughes (1860-1941)= Mary \\"May\\" Hughes was a voluntary parish worker. This work took her into slums, workhouses, doss houses and infirmaries (including ones for people with venereal disease, known as lock wards), to try to better the state of these places and share the troubles of the lower classes. She often became personally involved in cases. Hughes increasingly lived as one of the poor, keeping her diet simple (bread, margarine, little pieces of cheese and rudimentary vegetables), not buying goods such as new clothes that she saw as luxuries, not holidaying or sleeping on mattressed beds and in 1915 moving into the community settlement of Kingsley Hall, Bow. The Hall was an old chapel that was re-decorated and fitted by local volunteers in 1915. It was a 'people's house', where locals including, workmen, factory girls and children came together for worship, study, fun and friendship in order to better their lives. In 1917 Hughes was made a Justice of the Peace for Shoreditch, she specialised in rates and educational cases and was commonly known to cry at the evidence and pay fines for the poor. Hughes referred to herself as a Christian and a communist. She took part in marches of London's unemployed, even when mounted police were in attendance. She was also a pacifist for example, after the German blitz on London (1940) she was appalled by people, especially Christians, who called for retaliation. Christianity was an important factor in Hughes' life and what drove her social work. In 1918 she joined the Quakers (Society of Friends) and moved to Blackwall Buildings, Whitechapel in order to become a poor law guardian and volunteer visitor to the local poor law infirmary and children's home. Locally she was known as a benefactor of the poor and local unemployed people would knock on her door seeing if she knew of work. In 1928 Hughes moved to a converted pub on Vallance Road, Whitechapel and renamed it the Dew Drop Inn. The purpose of the Inn was to act as a social centre and refuge for the local homeless. Through the 1920s and 1930s she was passionately involved with the problems of the unemployed and she took part in a number of marches and rallies. In 1931 when Mohandas K. Gandhi was visiting Britain for the Commonwealth conference, he insisted on meeting Hughes. When they met, they clasped hands, looked at each other and burst out laughing. Hardly a word was said but \\"each had recognised the quality of the other's life\\". Mary Hughes died on 2 April 1941 in Whitechapel.http://www.archiveshub.ac.uk/news/07103001.html - Copyright ¬© 2000-2008 The Archives Hub, reproduced with permission. =Alfred Martin (1886-1915)= PC Alfred Arthur Martin was born on 12 March 1886 to James and Eliza Martin of Orpington, Kent.

Hometown Tales focuses on urban legends, folklore, historic oddities, ghost stories and local culture from towns all over.site All this is done with a light hearted twist and friendly exchange by the hosts. Gene Fitzpatrick plays the role of the skeptic while Bryan Minogue is frequently fearful of the paranormal stories. Emphasis is put on the tales, and not their veracity; therefore a pure urban legend will be treated on equal ground with a true story. The television program resulted in nine 30 minutes episodes which still air on many Public-access television channels like Patriot 8 from Patriot Cable in Somerset, NJ, Cablevision of Morris and others. Many of those segments have been re-purposed in a vidcast feed as well as on the Hometown Tales website. When Podcasting hit the scene, Hometown Tales began producing a program to support the TV show. It was one of the earlier podcasts on the scene Podcast Alley and peaked in the Top 10 of most popular podcasts on Podcast Alley.

It has been traced to the seventeenth century, but its exact origin is unknown. The title of the song references the Scotch Broom (Cytisus scoparius) flower, a vibrant yellow flower found throughout Scotland, including Cowdenknowes, a Scottish barony east of the Leader Water (River Leader), 32 miles southeast of Edinburgh in Berwickshire.The Barony of Cowdenknowes Synopsis The original and extended ballad was the story of a young shepherdess who falls in love with a stranger on horseback, who rides by her pasture every day. The song became popular across Scotland and England towards the end of the reign of James Vl & I, and the earliest publication date found is 1651.\\"Broom of the Cowdenknowes\\" http://www.kinglaoghaire.com/site/lyrics/song_67.html The melody was also published as a dance tune, during the same year, in John Playford's first edition of The English Dancing Master.Playford, John. The English Dancing Master, 81. London, 1651 http://www.pbm.com/~lindahl/playford_1651/081small.html Throughout the many versions of the popular folksong, there are many lyrical variations, but the plot remain consistent. The shepherdess and stranger fall in love and have an affair. When she becomes pregnant, she is banished from her country. She seeks out her lover, finding him to now be a wealthy lord. They marry, but she is never truly happy away from her own country, and she pines for \\"the bonnie bonnie broom\\". Traditionally, the song is sung from the perspective of the shepherdess. The broom, a tall shrub which blooms with spikes of small golden flowers, once grew abundantly on hillsides of the Scottish Borders. Recordings \\"Broom O' the Cowdenknowes\\" was recorded by Scottish folk singer Jean Redpath on her 1987 release A Fine Song for Singing. Other artists who recorded the song under either this title or its variants include Silly Wizard, Alexander James Adams, Baltimore Consort, John Allan Cameron, Cherish the Ladies, The City Waites, Liam Clancy, Meg Davis, Frankie Gavin, Dave Gunning, The Highwaymen, Jimmy MacBeath, Ed Miller, North Sea Gas, Kim Robertson, Lucie Skeaping, The Watersons, and Robin Williamson. The ballad was recorded under its alternate title \\"Bonny May\\" by British folk singer June Tabor on her first solo album, Airs and Graces, in 1976. It was also released under this title by the group 10,000 Maniacs on its 2015 album Twice Told Tales and by Offa Rex, a group featuring the American indie rock band Decemberists and British folk singer Olivia Chaney, on its 2017 debut The Queen of Hearts.

After the liberation of Paris, he accompanied Sir Charles and Lady Mendl on their return trip to Europe and was introduced to their friends on the continent. =1947‚Äì1960= Upon his return from Europe in 1947, Duquette continued his works for private clients and for the theatre and motion pictures. He presented his first exhibition at the Mitch Liesen Gallery in Los Angeles in 1949 and shortly thereafter was asked to present his works at the Pavilion de Marsan of the Louvre Museum, Paris. Duquette was the first American artist to have a one-man show at the Louvre. Returning from a year in France, where he received design commissions from the Duke and Duchess of Windsor and the Alsatian industrialist Commandant Paul Louis Weiller, Duquette held a one-man showing of his works at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. There followed other one-man exhibitions of Duquette's works, including at the M. H. de Young Museum and Palace of the Legion of Honor in San Francisco, the California Museum of Science and Industry and Municipal Art Gallery in Los Angeles, the El Paso Museum of Art, the Santa Barbara Museum of Art, the Museum of the City of New York, as well as one-man exhibitions in Dallas, Chicago, Rio de Janeiro and Phoenix, Arizona. In 1956, with his wife Elizabeth (known as Beegle), he opened a salon in the converted silent film studios of actress Norma Talmadge, where they entertained friends such as Arthur Rubenstein, Aldous Huxley and Jascha Heifitz. =1960‚Äì1970s= During the 1960s and '70s, the Duquettes continued to travel extensively, working in Austria, Ireland and France as well as New York, Dallas, San Francisco, South America and Asia. Duquette created interiors for Doris Duke, Norton Simon, and J. Paul Getty, a castle in Ireland for Elizabeth Arden and a penthouse in the Hawaiian Islands. He also designed interiors for commercial and public spaces like the Hilton Hawaiian Village, Sheraton Universal Hotel, and sculptures and tapestries for the Ritz Carlton Hotel in Chicago as well as the Los Angeles Music Center and the University of California at Los Angeles. Designs for film and theatre include Yolanda and the Thief, Lovely to Look At, Kismet, and Ziegfeld Follies for MGM, as well as Jest of Cards, Beauty and the Beast, and Danses Concertantes for the San Francisco Ballet. Operas for which Duquette designed both costumes and settings include Der Rosenkavelier, The Magic Flute, and Salome. His designs for the original Broadway production of Camelot won Duquette the Tony Award for Best Costume Design. His monumental work of environmental art Our Lady Queen of the Angels was created as a gift to the people of Los Angeles in honor of that city's lyrical name and in celebration of the bicentennial. This hugely successful multi-sensorial exhibit was seen by hundreds of thousands of visitors over a three-year period at the California State Museum of Science and Industry at Exposition Park. As part of the unique experience of \\"ethnic angels,\\" Duquette included a poetic narration by Ray Bradbury, spoken by Charlton Heston. Duquette embellished the celebratory experience with original music by Garth Hudson (reissued in 2005). The immense size of the building added to the effect, where from the 80 foot ceiling hung an 18-foot Madonna, dressed in an ornate and symbolic gown. She was surrounded by angels and alters and jeweled tapestries. All of this was enhanced by special lighting effects which changed the Madonna's facial color \\"to represent the four races.\\" Duquette researched angels and learned every major world religion (Catholic, Jewish, Moslem, Buddhist, Hindu believes in the same eight archangels.CD insert \\"Duquette writes that his 'Angels' exhibit stresses over and over again 'the brotherhood of man, which is an implied theme of this 'celebration.\\" He stated, \\"It is my hope that this celebrational environment, into which I have poured the aspirations of a lifetime, will transport the viewer to another dimension.\\"  Cultural impact  In 1979, the Duquettes formed the Anthony and Elizabeth Duquette Foundation for the Living Arts, a non-profit public foundation whose purpose is to present museum-quality exhibitions of artistic, scientific, and educational value to the public and to purchase, promote and preserve Duquette's own works. Exhibitions have been presented by the foundation at California's Mission San Fernando and through the Los Angeles Unified School District including \\"Designs for the Theatre\\", \\"The Art of the Found Object\\" and \\"The Fabric Mosaic Tapestry\\". The foundation has sponsored exhibitions and lectures on the decorative arts in Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, and Texas in conjunction with museums and other foundations and on the university level through the UCLA extension series. An exhibition was presented in San Francisco honoring Saint Francis of Assisi, the patron saint of that city. To house the exhibition, Duquette purchased an abandoned synagogue which he restored and renamed The Duquette Pavilion of Saint Francis. =1980s‚ÄìDeath= Malibu destroyed much of Duquette's work at his residence. Final projects, which he completed with the assistance of his business partner and design collaborator of 30 years, Hutton Wilkinson, included interiors for an 18th- century Parisian apartment located on the Place de Palais Bourbon in Paris and interiors for the 12th century Palazzo Brandolini on the Grand Canal in Venice. Loss by Fire =San Francisco fire= In 1989, much of Duquette's original art in the Duquette Pavilion was destroyed in a fire. Included in the destruction was a work titled Celebrational Environments, consisting of 28-foot-tall metal sculptures and 20-by-20-foot jewel-studded fabric mosaic tapestries. =Malibu fire of 1993= Following the fire in San Francisco, the Duquettes focused their efforts on construction at his 150-acre ranch in the Malibu Mountains of California. Calling it Sortilegium, which is Latin for \\"fortune-telling\\", Duquette strove to create a living work of art. After many years of work, this was also destroyed, by the Green Meadow fire of 1993.Reed, Mack and Alvarez, Fred (November 03, 1993) \\"Green Meadow Wildfire Flares Again\\" Los Angeles Times The work in progress had been extensively chronicled on television and by national and international magazines before its complete destruction. The Malibu property was bought in 2007 and architect David Randall Hertz was hired to design a home on one of the previous Duquette building pads. Following Duquette's legacy, Hertz designed a house from the wings of a Boeing 747-100, appropriately known as the 747 Wing House. Personal life =Marriage= In 1949, Duquette married artist Elizabeth \\"Beegle\\" Johnstone at a private ceremony at Pickfair, with Mary Pickford as matron of honor and Buddy Rogers as best man. The reception that followed was attended by Hollywood celebrities including Gloria Swanson, Greta Garbo, Fred Astaire, Vincente Minnelli, Louella Parsons, Hedda Hopper, Oscar Levant, Vernon Duke, and Marion Davies. The young couple collaborated on many design commissions and were active on the Hollywood social scene. After 46 years of marriage and artistic collaboration with Duquette, Elizabeth died from Parkinson's disease in Los Angeles. Up until his death at the age of 85, Duquette continued designing interiors, jewelry and works of art. For his 80th birthday, he created a new work entitled \\"The Phoenix Rising from His Flames\\", which was presented to UCLA at the Armand Hammer Museum of Art and Cultural Center in Los Angeles. =Death= On September 9, 1999, Duquette died of a heart attack at UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles. He was 85 years old. Legacy Duquette's house in Beverly Hills, \\"Dawnridge\\", continues as the headquarters for the design business, headed by Duquette's longtime collaborator Hutton Wilkinson.

Biography  Norgren replaced former HammerFall guitarist Stefan Elmgren, who decided to focus on his career as a pilot. Norgren was contacted by Joacim Cans, HammerFall's singer, who asked him if he knew a good guitarist. Being a fan of HammerFall's music and desiring to play a heavier style of music than that of The Poodles, Norgren suggested himself. HammerFall asserts that they are happy with Norgren as a guitarist and band member. Norgren previously played with bands including Great King Rat, Talisman, Humanimal, The Ring, and Zan Clan. He also served as live sound engineer for Thin Lizzy during the band's 2000 tour, similarly serving Europe and Yngwie J. Malmsteen. Recently, he joined The German Panzer as one of the group's 2nd guitarists.

Standards vary worldwide, but organic farming features practices that cycle resources, promote ecological balance, and conserve biodiversity. Organizations regulating organic products may restrict the use of certain pesticides and fertilizers in the farming methods used to produce such products. Organic foods typically are not processed using irradiation, industrial solvents, or synthetic food additives. In the 21st century, the European Union, the United States, Canada, Mexico, Japan, and many other countries require producers to obtain special certification to market their food as organic. Although the produce of kitchen gardens may actually be organic, selling food with an organic label is regulated by governmental food safety authorities, such as the National Organic Program of the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) or European Commission (EC). From an environmental perspective, fertilizing, overproduction, and the use of pesticides in conventional farming may negatively affect ecosystems, biodiversity, groundwater, and drinking water supplies. These environmental and health issues are intended to be minimized or avoided in organic farming. Demand for organic foods is primarily driven by consumer concerns for personal health and the environment. Nevertheless, from the perspective of science and consumers, there is insufficient evidence in the scientific and medical literature to support claims that organic food is either safer or healthier to eat than conventional food. While there may be some differences in the nutrient and antinutrient contents of organically and conventionally produced food, the variable nature of food production, shipping, storage, and handling makes it difficult to generalize results.Blair, Robert. (2012). Organic Production and Food Quality: A Down to Earth Analysis. Wiley-Blackwell, Oxford, UK. Pages 72, 223. Claims that \\"organic food tastes better\\" are generally not supported by tests. Organic agriculture has a higher production costs and lower yields, higher labor costs, and higher consumer prices as compared to conventional farming methods. Meaning, history and origin of the term For the vast majority of its history, agriculture can be described as having been organic; only during the 20th century was a large supply of new products, generally deemed not organic, introduced into food production. The organic farming movement arose in the 1940s in response to the industrialization of agriculture. In 1939, Lord Northbourne coined the term organic farming in his book Look to the Land (1940), out of his conception of \\"the farm as organism,\\" to describe a holistic, ecologically balanced approach to farming‚Äîin contrast to what he called chemical farming, which relied on \\"imported fertility\\" and \\"cannot be self-sufficient nor an organic whole.\\" Early soil scientists also described the differences in soil composition when animal manures were used as \\"organic\\", because they contain carbon compounds where superphosphates and haber process nitrogen do not. Their respective use affects humus content of soil.Paull, John (2011) \\"The Betteshanger Summer School: Missing link between biodynamic agriculture and organic farming\\", Journal of Organic Systems, 2011, 6(2):13-26. This is different from the scientific use of the term \\"organic\\" in chemistry, which refers to a class of molecules that contain carbon, especially those involved in the chemistry of life. This class of molecules includes everything likely to be considered edible, and include most pesticides and toxins too, therefore the term \\"organic\\" and, especially, the term \\"inorganic\\" (sometimes wrongly used as a contrast by the popular press) as they apply to organic chemistry is an equivocation fallacy when applied to farming, the production of food, and to foodstuffs themselves. Properly used in this agricultural science context, \\"organic\\" refers to the methods grown and processed, not necessarily the chemical composition of the food. Ideas that organic food could be healthier and better for the environment originated in the early days of the organic movement as a result of publications like the 1943 book The Living Soil and Farming and Gardening for Health or Disease (1945). In the industrial era, organic gardening reached a modest level of popularity in the United States in the 1950s. In the 1960s, environmentalists and the counterculture championed organic food, but it was only in the 1970s that a national marketplace for organic foods developed. Early consumers interested in organic food would look for non-chemically treated, non-use of unapproved pesticides, fresh or minimally processed food. They mostly had to buy directly from growers. Later, \\"Know your farmer, know your food\\" became the motto of a new initiative instituted by the USDA in September 2009. Personal definitions of what constituted \\"organic\\" were developed through firsthand experience: by talking to farmers, seeing farm conditions, and farming activities. Small farms grew vegetables (and raised livestock) using organic farming practices, with or without certification, and the individual consumer monitored. Small specialty health food stores and co-operatives were instrumental to bringing organic food to a wider audience. As demand for organic foods continued to increase, high volume sales through mass outlets such as supermarkets rapidly replaced the direct farmer connection. Today, many large corporate farms have an organic division. However, for supermarket consumers, food production is not easily observable, and product labeling, like \\"certified organic,\\" is relied upon. Government regulations and third- party inspectors are looked to for assurance. In the 1970s, interest in organic food grew with the rise of the environmental movement, and was also spurred by food-related health scares like the concerns about Alar that arose in the mid-1980s. =Legal definition= The National Organic Program (run by the USDA) is in charge of the legal definition of organic in the United States and does organic certification. Organic food production is a self-regulated industry with government oversight in some countries, distinct from private gardening. Currently, the European Union, the United States, Canada, Japan, and many other countries require producers to obtain special certification based on government-defined standards in order to market food as organic within their borders. In the context of these regulations, foods marketed as organic are produced in a way that complies with organic standards set by national governments and international organic industry trade organizations. In the United States, organic production is managed in accordance with the Organic Foods Production Act of 1990 (OFPA) and regulations in Title 7, Part 205 of the Code of Federal Regulations to respond to site-specific conditions by integrating cultural, biological, and mechanical practices that foster cycling of resources, promote ecological balance, and conserve biodiversity. If livestock are involved, the livestock must be reared with regular access to pasture and without the routine use of antibiotics or growth hormones. Processed organic food usually contains only organic ingredients. If non- organic ingredients are present, at least a certain percentage of the food's total plant and animal ingredients must be organic (95% in the United States, Canada, and Australia). Foods claiming to be organic must be free of artificial food additives, and are often processed with fewer artificial methods, materials and conditions, such as chemical ripening, food irradiation, and genetically modified ingredients. Pesticides are allowed as long as they are not synthetic.Staff, National Pesticide Information Center Organic Pesticide Ingredients However, under US federal organic standards, if pests and weeds are not controllable through management practices, nor via organic pesticides and herbicides, \\"a substance included on the National List of synthetic substances allowed for use in organic crop production may be applied to prevent, suppress, or control pests, weeds, or diseases.\\" Several groups have called for organic standards to prohibit nanotechnology on the basis of the precautionary principlePaull, J. & Lyons, K.

Academic OneFile. In the U.S., the food label \\"natural\\" or \\"all natural\\" does not mean that the food was produced and processed organically.'' Public perception There is widespread public belief that organic food is safer, more nutritious, and better tasting than conventional food, which has largely contributed to the development of an organic food culture. Consumers purchase organic foods for different reasons, including concerns about the effects of conventional farming practices on the environment, human health, and animal welfare. The most important reason for purchasing organic foods seems to be beliefs about the products' health-giving properties and higher nutritional value. These beliefs are promoted by the organic food industry,Joanna Schroeder for Academics Review. Organic Marketing Report and have fueled increased demand for organic food despite higher prices and difficulty in confirming these claimed benefits scientifically.Dangour AD et al (2009) Nutritional quality of organic foods: a systematic review The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition 92(1) 203‚Äì210Canavari, M., Asioli, D., Bendini, A., Cantore, N., Gallina Toschi, T., Spiller, A., Obermowe, T., Buchecker, K. and Lohmann, M. (2009). Summary report on sensory-related socio-economic and sensory science literature about organic food products Organic labels also stimulate the consumer to view the product as having more positive nutritional value. Psychological effects such as the ‚Äúhalo‚Äù effect, which are related to the choice and consumption of organic food, are also important motivating factors in the purchase of organic food. The perception that organic food is low- calorie food or health food appears to be common. In China the increasing demand for organic products of all kinds, and in particular milk, baby food and infant formula, has been \\"spurred by a series of food scares, the worst being the death of six children who had consumed baby formula laced with melamine\\" in 2009 and the 2008 Chinese milk scandal, making the Chinese market for organic milk the largest in the world as of 2014. A Pew Research Centre survey in 2012 indicated that 41% of Chinese consumers thought of food safety as a very big problem, up by three times from 12% in 2008. =Taste= There is no good evidence that organic food tastes better than its non-organic counterparts. There is evidence that some organic fruit is drier than conventionally grown fruit; a slightly drier fruit may also have a more intense flavor due to the higher concentration of flavoring substances. Some foods, such as bananas, are picked when unripe, are cooled to prevent ripening while they are shipped to market, and then are induced to ripen quickly by exposing them to propylene or ethylene, chemicals produced by plants to induce their own ripening; as flavor and texture changes during ripening, this process may affect those qualities of the treated fruit.Washington State University Extension Office. Ethylene: The Ripening Hormone Ethylene: The Ripening Hormone Fresh Air, National Public Radio. August 30, 2011 Transcript: Bananas: The Uncertain Future Of A Favorite Fruit Chemical composition Organic vegetables at a farmers' market With respect to chemical differences in the composition of organically grown food compared with conventionally grown food, studies have examined differences in nutrients, antinutrients, and pesticide residues. These studies generally suffer from confounding variables, and are difficult to generalize due to differences in the tests that were done, the methods of testing, and because the vagaries of agriculture affect the chemical composition of food; these variables include variations in weather (season to season as well as place to place); crop treatments (fertilizer, pesticide, etc.); soil composition; the cultivar used, and in the case of meat and dairy products, the parallel variables in animal production. Treatment of the foodstuffs after initial gathering (whether milk is pasteurized or raw), the length of time between harvest and analysis, as well as conditions of transport and storage, also affect the chemical composition of a given item of food. Additionally, there is evidence that organic produce is drier than conventionally grown produce; a higher content in any chemical category may be explained by higher concentration rather than in absolute amounts. =Nutrients= Many people believe that organic foods have higher content of nutrients and thus are healthier than conventionally produced foods. However, scientists have not been equally convinced that this is the case as the research conducted in the field has not shown consistent results. A 2009 systematic review found that organically produced foodstuffs are not richer in vitamins and minerals than conventionally produced foodstuffs. The results of the systematic review only showed a lower nitrogen and higher phosphorus content in organic produced compared to conventionally grown foodstuffs. Content of vitamin C, calcium, potassium, total soluble solids, copper, iron, nitrates, manganese, and sodium did not differ between the two categories. A 2012 survey of the scientific literature did not find significant differences in the vitamin content of organic and conventional plant or animal products, and found that results varied from study to study. Produce studies reported on ascorbic acid (vitamin C) (31 studies), beta- carotene (a precursor for vitamin A) (12 studies), and alpha-tocopherol (a form of vitamin E) (5 studies) content; milk studies reported on beta-carotene (4 studies) and alpha-tocopherol levels (4 studies). Few studies examined vitamin content in meats, but these found no difference in beta-carotene in beef, alpha-tocopherol in pork or beef, or vitamin A (retinol) in beef. The authors analyzed 11 other nutrients reported in studies of produce. A 2011 literature review found that organic foods had a higher micronutrient content overall than conventionally produced foods. Similarly, organic chicken contained higher levels of omega-3 fatty acids{https://edition.cnn.com/2016/02/18/health/organic-meat-milk-fatty-acids- omega-3s/index.html} than conventional chicken. The authors found no difference in the protein or fat content of organic and conventional raw milk. A 2016 systematic review and meta-analysis found that organic meat had comparable or slightly lower levels of saturated fat and monounsaturated fat as conventional meat, but higher levels of both overall and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. Another meta-analysis published the same year found no significant differences in levels of saturated and monounsaturated fat between organic and conventional milk, but significantly higher levels of overall and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in organic milk than in conventional milk. =Anti-nutrients= The amount of nitrogen content in certain vegetables, especially green leafy vegetables and tubers, has been found to be lower when grown organically as compared to conventionally. When evaluating environmental toxins such as heavy metals, the USDA has noted that organically raised chicken may have lower arsenic levels. Early literature reviews found no significant evidence that levels of arsenic, cadmium or other heavy metals differed significantly between organic and conventional food products. However, a 2014 review found lower concentrations of cadmium, particularly in organically grown grains. =Phytochemicals= A 2014 meta- analysis of 343 studies on phytochemical composition found that organically grown crops had lower cadmium and pesticide residues, and 17% higher concentrations of polyphenols than conventionally grown crops. Concentrations of phenolic acids, flavanones, stilbenes, flavones, flavonols, and anthocyanins were elevated, with flavanones being 69% higher. Studies on phytochemical composition of organic crops have numerous deficiencies, including absence of standardized measurements and poor reporting on measures of variability, duplicate or selective reporting of data, publication bias, lack of rigor in studies comparing pesticide residue levels in organic and conventional crops, the geographical origin of samples, and inconsistency of farming and post-harvest methods. =Pesticide residues= The amount of pesticides that remain in or on food is called pesticide residue. In the United States, before a pesticide can be used on a food crop, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency must determine whether that pesticide can be used without posing a risk to human health.\\"Pesticides Health and Safety Information.\\" National Pesticides Information Center. National Pesticides Information Center, 1 Apr.2014.Web.9 Nov.2015. A 2012 meta-analysis determined that detectable pesticide residues were found in 7% of organic produce samples and 38% of conventional produce samples. This result was statistically heterogeneous, potentially because of the variable level of detection used among these studies. Only three studies reported the prevalence of contamination exceeding maximum allowed limits; all were from the European Union. A 2014 meta-analysis found that conventionally grown produce was four times more likely to have pesticide residue than organically grown crops. The American Cancer Society has stated that no evidence exists that the small amount of pesticide residue found on conventional foods will increase the risk of cancer, although it recommends thoroughly washing fruits and vegetables. They have also stated that there is no research to show that organic food reduces cancer risk compared to foods grown with conventional farming methods. The Environmental Protection Agency maintains strict guidelines on the regulation of pesticides by setting a tolerance on the amount of pesticide residue allowed to be in or on any particular food.2013 November, \\"The ruling on organic foods: are they worth the extra price?\\" \\"Healthy Years\\" ISSN 1551-4617, 11/2013, Volume 10, Issue 11, p. 1 Although some residue may remain at the time of harvest, residue tend to decline as the pesticide breaks down over time. In addition, as the commodities are washed and processed prior to sale, the residues often diminish further. =Bacterial contamination= A 2012 meta-analysis determined that prevalence of E. coli contamination was not statistically significant (7% in organic produce and 6% in conventional produce). While bacterial contamination is common among both organic and conventional animal products, differences in the prevalence of bacterial contamination between organic and conventional animal products were also statistically insignificant. Organic meat production requirements =United States= Organic meat certification in the United States requires farm animals to be raised according to USDA organic regulations throughout their lives. These regulations require that livestock are fed certified organic food that contains no animal byproducts. Further, organic farm animals can receive no growth hormones or antibiotics, and they must be raised using techniques that protect native species and other natural resources. Irradiation and genetic engineering are not allowed with organic animal production. One of the major differences in organic animal husbandry protocol is the \\"pasture rule\\": minimum requirements for time on pasture do vary somewhat by species and between the certifying agencies, but the common theme is to require as much time on pasture as possible and reasonable. Health and safety There is little scientific evidence of benefit or harm to human health from a diet high in organic food, and conducting any sort of rigorous experiment on the subject is very difficult. A 2012 meta-analysis noted that \\"there have been no long-term studies of health outcomes of populations consuming predominantly organic versus conventionally produced food controlling for socioeconomic factors; such studies would be expensive to conduct.\\" A 2009 meta-analysis noted that \\"most of the included articles did not study direct human health outcomes. In ten of the included studies (83%), a primary outcome was the change in antioxidant activity. Antioxidant status and activity are useful biomarkers but do not directly equate to a health outcome. Of the remaining two articles, one recorded proxy-reported measures of atopic manifestations as its primary health outcome, whereas the other article examined the fatty acid composition of breast milk and implied possible health benefits for infants from the consumption of different amounts of conjugated linoleic acids from breast milk.\\" In addition, as discussed above, difficulties in accurately and meaningfully measuring chemical differences between organic and conventional food make it difficult to extrapolate health recommendations based solely on chemical analysis. As of 2012, the scientific consensus is that while \\"consumers may choose to buy organic fruit, vegetables and meat because they believe them to be more nutritious than other food.... the balance of current scientific evidence does not support this view.\\" The evidence of beneficial health effects of organic food consumption is scarce, which has led researchers to call for more long- term studies. In addition, studies that suggest that organic foods may be healthier than conventional foods face significant methodological challenges, such as the correlation between organic food consumption and factors known to promote a healthy lifestyle. When the American Academy of Pediatrics reviewed the literature on organic foods in 2012, they found that \\"current evidence does not support any meaningful nutritional benefits or deficits from eating organic compared with conventionally grown foods, and there are no well- powered human studies that directly demonstrate health benefits or disease protection as a result of consuming an organic diet.\\" =Consumer safety= Pesticide exposure The main difference between organic and conventional food products are the chemicals involved during production and processing. The residues of those chemicals in food products have dubious effects on human health. All food products on the market including those that contain residues of pesticides, antibiotics, growth hormones and other types of chemicals that are used during production and processing are said to be safe.\\"Organic Food No More Nutritious than Non-organic: Study. Organic Food No More Nutritious than Non-organic: Study, 4 Sept.2012.Web.9 Nov.2015 Claims of improved safety of organic food has largely focused on pesticide residues. These concerns are driven by the facts that \\"(1) acute, massive exposure to pesticides can cause significant adverse health effects; (2) food products have occasionally been contaminated with pesticides, which can result in acute toxicity; and (3) most, if not all, commercially purchased food contains trace amounts of agricultural pesticides.\\" However, as is frequently noted in the scientific literature: \\"What does not follow from this, however, is that chronic exposure to the trace amounts of pesticides found in food results in demonstrable toxicity. This possibility is practically impossible to study and quantify;\\" therefore firm conclusions about the relative safety of organic foods have been hampered by the difficulty in proper study design and relatively small number of studies directly comparing organic food to conventional food. Additionally, the Carcinogenic Potency Project, which is a part of the US EPA's Distributed Structure-Searchable Toxicity (DSSTox) Database Network,National Center for Computational Toxicology (NCCT) DSSTox Official Website has been systemically testing the carcinogenicity of chemicals, both natural and synthetic, and building a publicly available database of the resultsPublicly available Toxnet database from US NLM for the past ~30 years. Their work attempts to fill in the gaps in our scientific knowledge of the carcinogenicity of all chemicals, both natural and synthetic, as the scientists conducting the Project described in the journal, Science, in 1992: > Toxicological examination of synthetic chemicals, without similar > examination of chemicals that occur naturally, has resulted in an imbalance > in both the data on and the perception of chemical carcinogens. Three points > that we have discussed indicate that comparisons should be made with natural > as well as synthetic chemicals. > 1) The vast proportion of chemicals that humans are exposed to occur > naturally. Nevertheless, the public tends to view chemicals as only > synthetic and to think of synthetic chemicals as toxic despite the fact that > every natural chemical is also toxic at some dose. The daily average > exposure of Americans to burnt material in the diet is ~2000 mg, and > exposure to natural pesticides (the chemicals that plants produce to defend > themselves) is ~1500 mg.

It is probable that almost every fruit and vegetable in the > supermarket contains natural pesticides that are rodent carcinogens. While studies have shown via chemical analysis, as discussed above, that organically grown fruits and vegetables have significantly lower pesticide residue levels, the significance of this finding on actual health risk reduction is debatable as both conventional foods and organic foods generally have pesticide levels well below government established guidelines for what is considered safe. This view has been echoed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the UK Food Standards Agency. A study published by the National Research Council in 1993 determined that for infants and children, the major source of exposure to pesticides is through diet.National Research Council. Pesticides in the Diets of Infants and Children. National Academies Press; 1993. . Retrieved 10-Apr-2006. A study published in 2006 by Lu et al. measured the levels of organophosphorus pesticide exposure in 23 school children before and after replacing their diet with organic food. In this study it was found that levels of organophosphorus pesticide exposure dropped from negligible levels to undetectable levels when the children switched to an organic diet, the authors presented this reduction as a significant reduction in risk. The conclusions presented in Lu et al. were criticized in the literature as a case of bad scientific communication.Alex Avery (2006) Organic Diets and Children‚Äôs Health Environ Health Perspect.114(4) A210‚ÄìA211. More specifically, claims related to pesticide residue of increased risk of infertility or lower sperm counts have not been supported by the evidence in the medical literature. Likewise the American Cancer Society (ACS) has stated their official position that \\"whether organic foods carry a lower risk of cancer because they are less likely to be contaminated by compounds that might cause cancer is largely unknown.\\" Reviews have noted that the risks from microbiological sources or natural toxins are likely to be much more significant than short term or chronic risks from pesticide residues. Microbiological contamination Organic farming has a preference for using manure as fertilizer, compared to conventional farming in general. This practise seems to imply an increased risk of microbiological contamination, such as E. coli O157:H7, from organic food consumption, but reviews have found little evidence that actual incidence of outbreaks can be positively linked to organic food production. The 2011 Germany E. coli O104:H4 outbreak, however, was blamed on organic farming of bean sprouts. = Environmental safety = From an environmental perspective, fertilizing, overproduction and the use of pesticides in conventional farming has caused, and is causing, enormous damage worldwide to local ecosystems, biodiversity, groundwater and drinking water supplies, and sometimes farmer's health and fertility. Outcomes from organic farming, however, are uncertain for their scale of environmental benefits, because of its limits for transforming the food system. In some cases, reducing food waste and dietary changes might provide greater benefits. Economics Organic agriculture has higher potential costs due to lower yields and higher labor costs, leading to higher consumer prices. Demand for organic foods is primarily driven by concerns for personal health and for the environment. Global sales for organic foods climbed by more than 170 percent since 2002 reaching more than $63 billion in 2011Global organic sales reach $63 billion, U.S. is largest market, Ag Professional, June 25, 2013. while certified organic farmland remained relatively small at less than 2 percent of total farmland under production, increasing in OECD and EU countries (which account for the majority of organic production) by 35 percent for the same time period.OECD Compendium of Agri-Environmental Indicators, OECD, June 25, 2013. Organic products typically cost 10 to 40% more than similar conventionally produced products, to several times the price. Processed organic foods vary in price when compared to their conventional counterparts. While organic food accounts for about 1% of total food production worldwide, the organic food sales market is growing rapidly with between 5 and 10 percent of the food market share in the United States according to the Organic Trade Association,Organic Food Facts , Organic Trade Association, 2010. significantly outpacing sales growth volume in dollars of conventional food products. World organic food sales jumped from US $23 billion in 2002 to $63 billion in 2011.Global organic sales reach $63 billion, Ag Professional =Asia= Production and consumption of organic products is rising rapidly in Asia, and both China and India are becoming global producers of organic crops and a number of countries, particularly China and Japan, also becoming large consumers of organic food and drink. The disparity between production and demand, is leading to a two-tier organic food industry, typified by significant and growing imports of primary organic products such as dairy and beef from Australia, Europe, New Zealand and the United States. ;China :* China's organic food production was originally for exportation in the early 2000s. Due to the food safety crisis since the late 2000s, China's domestic market outweighed the exportation market. The organic food production in China involves diverse players. Besides certified organic food production mainly conducted by private organic food companies, there are also non-certified organic farming practiced by entrepreneurs and civil society organizations. These initiatives have unique marketing channels such as ecological farmers' markets and community-supported agriculture emerging in and around Chinese major cities.Scott, Steffanie; Si, Zhenzhong; Schumilas, Theresa and Chen, Aijuan. (2018). Organic Food and Farming in China: Top-down and Bottom-up Ecological Initiatives New York: Routledge :* China‚Äôs domestic organic market is the fourth largest in the world. The Chinese Organic Food Development Center estimated domestic sales of organic food products to be around US$500 million per annum as of 2013. This is predicted to increase by 30 percent to 50 percent in 2014. As of 2015, organic foods made up about 1% of the total Chinese food market. :* China is the world‚Äôs biggest infant formula market with $12.4 billion in sales annually; of this, organic infant formula and baby food accounted for approximately 5.5 per cent of sales in 2011. Australian organic infant formula and baby food producer Bellamy's Organic have reported that their sales in this market grew 70 per cent annually over the period 2008-2013, while Organic Dairy Farmers of Australia, reported that exports of long-life organic milk to China had grown by 20 to 30 per cent per year over the same period. ;Japan : In 2010, the Japanese organic market was estimated to be around $1.3 billion. =North America= As of October 2014, Trader Joe's is a market leader of organic grocery stores in the United States. ; United States :* In 2012 the total size of the organic food market in the United States was about $30 billion (out of the total market for organic and natural consumer products being about $81 billion) Carl Edstrom of IRI and Kathryn Peters of SPINS October 2013 Natural / Organic Consumer Segmentation, A Total Market Perspective :* Organic food is the fastest growing sector of the American food industry.Caroline Scott-Thomas for FoodNavigator-USA.com, April 24, 2012.

The US organic market grew 9.5% in 2011, breaking the $30bn barrier for the first time, and continued to outpace sales of non-organic food. :* In 2003 organic products were available in nearly 20,000 natural food stores and 73% of conventional grocery stores. :* Organic products accounted for 3.7% of total food and beverage sales, and 11.4% of all fruit and vegetable sales in the year 2009. :* As of 2003, two thirds of organic milk and cream and half of organic cheese and yogurt are sold through conventional supermarkets. :* , most independent organic food processors in the USA had been acquired by multinational firms. :*In order for a product to become USDA organic certified, the farmer cannot plant genetically modified seeds and livestock cannot eat genetically modified plants. Farmers must provide substantial evidence showing there was no genetic modification involved in the operation. ;Canada :* Organic food sales surpassed $1 billion in 2006, accounting for 0.9% of food sales in Canada. By 2012, Canadian organic food sales reached $3 billion. :* Organic food sales by grocery stores were 28% higher in 2006 than in 2005. :* British Columbians account for 13% of the Canadian population, but purchased 26% of the organic food sold in Canada in 2006. =Europe= ;Denmark :* In 2012, organic products accounted for 7.8% of the total retail consumption market in Denmark, the highest national market share in the world.Danish Agriculture & Food Council Organic Farming Page accessed January 3, 2015 Many public institutions have voluntarily committed themselves to buy some organic food and in Copenhagen 75 % of all food served in public institutions is organic. A governmental action plan initiated in 2012-2014 aims at 60 % organic food in all public institutions across the country before 2020.Soil Association. Organic food and farming: A driver for sustainable development in Scotland with learning from Denmark :* In 1987, the first Danish Action Plan was implemented which was meant to support and stimulate farmers to switch from conventional food production systems to organic ones . Since then Denmark has constantly worked on further developing the market by promoting organic food and keeping prices low in comparison to conventional food products by offering farmers subvention and extra support if they choose to produce organic food. Then and even today is the bench mark for organic food policy and certification of organic food in the whole world. The new European Organic food label and organic food policy was developed based on the 1987 Danish Model.Aschemann, J., U. Hamm, S. Naspetti, and R Zanoli\\"The Organic Market.\\" In Organic Farming: An international History, by W. Lockeretz, 123-151. Wallingford, Oxfordshire:CABI, 2007 ; Austria : In 2011, 7.4% of all food products sold in Austrian supermarkets (including discount stores) were organic. In 2007, 8,000 different organic products were available. ;Italy : Since 2000, the use of some organic food is compulsory in Italian schools and hospitals. A 2002 law of the Emilia Romagna region implemented in 2005, explicitly requires that the food in nursery and primary schools (from 3 months to 10 years) must be 100% organic, and the food in meals at schools, universities and hospitals must be at least 35% organic. ; Poland : In 2005 7 percent of Polish consumers buy food that was produced according to the EU-Eco-regulation. The value of the organic market is estimated at 50 million euros (2006). ; Romania : 70%‚Äì80% of the local organic production, amounting to 100 million euros in 2010, is exported.

Bio Suisse, the Swiss organic producers' association, provides guidelines for organic farmers. ; Ukraine :*In 2009 Ukraine was in 21st place in the world by area under cultivation of organic food. Much of its production of organic food is exported and not enough organic food is available on the national market to satisfy the rapidly increasing demand. The size of the internal market demand for organic products in Ukraine was estimated at over 5 billion euros in 2011, with rapid growth projected for this segment in the future. Multiple surveys show that the majority of the population of Ukraine is willing to pay more to buy organic food.–ò—Å—Å–ª–µ–¥–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–µ —Ç—Ä–µ–Ω–¥–æ–≤: –ì–æ—Ç–æ–≤—ã –ª–∏ —É–∫—Ä–∞–∏–Ω—Ü—ã –ø–æ–∫—É–ø–∞—Ç—å —ç–∫–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏ —á–∏—Å—Ç—ã–µ —Ç–æ–≤–∞—Ä—ã? // –¥–æ—Å–ª—ñ–¥–Ω–∏—Ü—å–∫–∏–π —Ü–µ–Ω—Ç—Ä –∫–æ–º–ø–∞–Ω—ñ—ó INRISE Development, –≤–µ—Ä–µ—Å–µ–Ω—å 2010 —Ä. On the other hand, many Ukrainians have traditionally maintained their own garden plots, and this may result in underestimation of how much organically produced food is actually consumed in Ukraine. :*The Law on Organic Production was passed by Ukraine's parliament in April 2011, which in addition to traditional demands for certified organic food also banned the use of GMOs or any products containing GMOs. However, the law was not signed by the President of Ukraine and in September 2011 it was repealed by the Verkhovna Rada itself. The new Organic Production Law was adopted by Rada and signed by President Poroshenko in July 2018.https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric- economy/2508099-poroshenko-signs-law-establishing-basic-principles-and- requirements-for-organic-production.html Poroshenko signs law establishing basic principles and requirements for organic production ; United Kingdom : Organic food sales increased from just over ¬£100 million in 1993/94 to ¬£1.21 billion in 2004 (an 11% increase on 2003). In 2010, the UK sales of organic products fell 5.9% to ¬£1.73 billion. 86% of households buy organic products, the most popular categories being dairies (30.5% of sales) and fresh fruits and vegetables (23.2% of sales). 4.2% of UK farmland is organically managed. =Latin America= ; Cuba : After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, agricultural inputs that had previously been purchased from Eastern bloc countries were no longer available in Cuba, and many Cuban farms converted to organic methods out of necessity. Consequently, organic agriculture is a mainstream practice in Cuba, while it remains an alternative practice in most other countries. Although some products called organic in Cuba would not satisfy certification requirements in other countries (crops may be genetically modified, for example), Cuba exports organic citrus and citrus juices to EU markets that meet EU organic standards. Cuba's forced conversion to organic methods may position the country to be a global supplier of organic products.

Biography Piermatteo was born at Amelia, in Umbria. He is first recorded as being part of the circle of Filippo Lippi, active between 1467 and 1469, working on the decoration of the Spoleto Cathedral. From 1479 until 1480 he was in Rome, where he was active in painting the Sistine Chapel; he aided in creating the decoration of stars on the ceiling. From 1480 until 1482 he was active in Orvieto, painting statues and decorating church fixtures and clocks. It was at this time that he did some work for the church of Sant'Augostino, which pieces have since been removed and scattered among a number of collections. He returned to Rome, but was recalled in 1428 by the Council of Works for the Orvieto Cathedral, and was commissioned to help decorate the San Brizio Chapel. Ultimately this work was later offered to Luca Signorelli. A fresco in Narni, depicting the Madonna and Child with Saints Lucy and Apollonia, has been dated to 1483. In 1485 Piermatteo was in Rome, working for Popes Innocent VIII and Alexander VI. Stylistically, his later works are similar to those of Antoniazzo Romano. In 1497 he was nominated to the conservatory in Fano; by 1503 he had been made superintendent of the Papal factories at Civita Castellana. Gardner Annunciation by da Amelia, displayed at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston Piermatteo is also known as the Master of the Gardner Annunciation for a series of works depicting the Annunciation which were painted for the convent of Saints Annunziata and Amelia; in 1880 these came into the possession of Isabella Stewart Gardner, from whom the name comes. The anonymous painter was identified when the contract for the work was discovered in Terni; it indicated that Piermatteo da Amelia was contracted for the paintings on September 23, 1483. A Mary Magdalen and a John the Baptist (circa 1480-1481) are displayed in the collections of the Lindenau museum in Altenberg.Lindenau Museum.

The main entrance and the interior has a simplified Greek Revival styling. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on November 28, 1980.  Design  The date of construction for the house has been billed to both c. 1827 or c. 1850. The City of East Providence Historic District Commission states that the house was built by Pearce Allin as a wedding present for his daughter, Louise. The house is located opposite of Allin's own historic home, better known as Whitcomb Farm. In 1827, Louise married Joseph Bicknell and they would eventually move to Barrington, Rhode Island. They would later pass the property to Dr. Hervey Armington, who married Louisa's sister, Adelia. Thus the province of the name is derived from the two first two owners of the home. According to architectural evidence, the house was heavily modified in the 1850s. The house's \\"Lightning Splitter\\" design harkens to the superstitious belief that the sharp angled gable would deflect bolts of lightning. The construction or alteration to the steep gable are both possibilities because Providence's surviving examples included new constructions and adaptations dating to the mid-19th century. At the time of the National Register nomination, it was believed that half a dozen examples of the style were still extant in the area in and around Providence. The house is located on the southwest corner of Pawtucket Avenue and Willett Avenue (Rhode Island Route 103). The house is a wood-framed dwelling resting on a high stone foundation. The house's most prominent and notable feature is its steep two-story gable roof, which is the unique \\"Lightning Splitter\\" design. The house has a one-story ell that comes off the basement on the south side and extends beyond the west wall. At the time of its nomination in the 1980s, the house's exterior walls were covered with asbestos shingles, but the original clapboards remained underneath. A simple pilaster-trimmed Greek Revival main doorway is located on northern end of the three-bay front. The second floor of the house has two bays and the third floor has only a single bay. The interior floor plan is divided into three rooms and a small entry hall on the first floor, two rooms on the second floor and two rooms on the third floor. The interior trim was noted to be a highly simplified Greek Revival style.  Significance  The Bicknell‚ÄìArmington Lightning Splitter House is historically important as a rare example of the unusual design that was rooted in popular folk culture. Additional information on the house, including its ties to Allin were not listed in the National Register of Historic Places nomination serve to further enhance its importance. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on November 28, 1980.

Darko is a 2009 American science fiction thriller film directed by Chris Fisher and starring Daveigh Chase, Briana Evigan, and Ed Westwick. It is the sequel to the 2001 cult film Donnie Darko. In Donnie Darko, the main character of the same name is a young man troubled by hallucinations of doomsday who ends up being killed by a mysterious falling jet engine. S. Darko is set seven years after Donnie's death. His sister Samantha Darko is beset by sleepwalking, hallucinations and apparent time travel as she tries to unravel a small town's mysteries. Plot Seven years after the death of Donnie Darko, a young man troubled by hallucinations about doomsday, his now 18-year- old sister Samantha Darko joins her best female friend Corey on a road trip from Virginia to California. When their car breaks down in a tiny Utah town, they are helped by the town \\"bad boy\\", Randy. The pair meet eccentric locals and learn that a local boy, Billy Moorcroft, has gone missing. Samantha is still struggling with her brother's death and is sleepwalking. While wandering, she meets a homeless veteran with PTSD named Justin (James Lafferty). As the pair sit atop a windmill, she tells him that the world will end soon, but he knows this already. The next morning she wakes up outside, and sees that a meteorite has crashed into the windmill. A series of mysterious encounters and events follows. A geeky guy, Jeremy (Jackson Rathbone), is interested in buying the meteorite, and chats with Samantha. Randy tells of how he misses his younger brother who has disappeared and is feared dead. During a strange episode, Samantha takes Justin to the local church and commands him to burn it. The next day, police find Justin's dog tags in the ashes. Samantha meets Jeremy, who is showing signs of radiation exposure from the meteorite. Justin is forging a bunny-skull mask to help \\"his princess.\\" Samantha tells Corey she wants to get out of town but the two argue bitterly. Samantha runs away, and she is knocked down in a car crash. Anguished about her best friend's death, Corey goes through Samantha's effects, including a book about time travel and a story Samantha wrote as a child about a princess and a boy named Justin. After a strange boy commands Corey to come with him to save Samantha, she follows him to a cave into a portal that takes her back in time. Everything moves backwards to when Samantha is walking down the road. Corey and Randy drive up to Samantha again and Corey is nicer to her. This time, Corey is struck in a car crash. Samantha is devastated by Corey's death. After another sleepwalking incident, she sees a dress in a shop window that she knows from her sleepwalking visions. Samantha wakes up from sleepwalking and finds she is outside with Justin. He tells her the book about time travel was written by his grandmother and says that he made his bunny skull mask from a drawing by Samantha's deceased brother. Wandering, Samantha finds the bodies of two dead boys, Randy's little brother and the missing local boy who appeared to Corey, Billy Moorcroft. The townspeople assume that Justin is responsible for the deaths and police take him into custody. That night, Samantha gets the dress as a gift from Jeremy and he asks her on a date. On a hilltop, they see glowing tesseracts falling from the sky. He becomes manic and violent with Samantha, pushing her so hard that she falls and lies motionless. Samantha visits Justin in jail. Randy tries to find her as fiery tesseracts fall from the sky. Justin puts on his mask, which makes him go back in time. He climbs the windmill that was destroyed at the beginning. Justin believes that his death will prevent the series of events that will lead to the end of the world. He stays on the windmill and is killed by the meteorite. It is now the morning after the meteorite landing again. Samantha and Corey visit the site and find the locals are saddened as they take away Justin's body. Samantha, never having experienced the events after the meteorite crash, decides to go back home while Corey stays in the small town with Randy.

Darko. He stated \\"To set the record straight, here's a few facts I'd like to share with you all‚ÄîI haven't read this script. I have absolutely no involvement with this production, nor will I ever be involved.\\" Chris Fisher, director of S. Darko, noted that he was an admirer of Kelly's film, and that he hoped \\"to create a similar world of blurred fantasy and reality.\\" The film was an independent production of Silver Nitrate Productions, and not by Newmarket Films (which produced the original film)‚ÄîNewmarket had gone dormant by this time. 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment, who had the distribution rights to the first Darko, won the right to release S. Darko domestically on home video. Filming for S. Darko began on May 18, 2008. The crew used the high resolution digital Red One cameras.

Wired.com. Retrieved February 4, 2015. S. Darko was filmed in Coalville, Utah and Magna, Utah. Marketing To promote the film, a viral marketing campaign was launched consisting of three YouTube videos.\\"The third chapter in the S. DARKO viral\\". FangoriaOnline.com. Retrieved February 4, 2015. The first video is footage from a surveillance camera, showing a dumpster falling from the sky and crushing a child. The second video is from a conspiracy theorist expressing his beliefs that metallic objects which‚Äîwith no apparent rational explanation‚Äîfall from the sky and lethally crush people are \\"Artifacts\\". \\"Artifacts\\", he explains, are from parallel universes that have accidentally made contact with our main universe. He believes that when the two universes meet again further down in time, both of them will be catastrophically destroyed, unless something is done to prevent this. Examples of such \\"Artifacts\\" are the jet engine that killed Donnie Darko, a manhole that decapitated a young girl, the aforementioned dumpster, and a meteor shower over Utah that resulted in the death of a local man. The meteor shower is one of the main events that happen in the movie. The third video is from a young girl responding to the creator of the previous video. She accuses him of being a fraud and a hack who doesn't understand what he's talking about, because he stole his theories from Roberta Sparrow's book, The Philosophy of Time Travel, which was featured in the original movie. She then shows him another link between several of these disastrous events: the falling dumpster left a hole in the ground with a shape apparently similar to a drawing of Frank's mask retrieved from Donnie Darko's psych file; and the same shape also appears in a hunk of twisted, wrought-iron metal pulled from the wreckage of the windmill that was destroyed by the meteor shower in Conejo Springs. Critical reception The film was largely panned by critics, often citing its muddled storyline, one-sided characters, and superficial dialogue. The A.V. Club gave the film an F, noting that the sequel took \\"a few simple, surface elements from Donnie Darko and fail[ed] spectacularly in trying to create a franchise\\". The Washington Post gave a somewhat better review, calling it average but stating that \\"The Darko faithful are better off skipping the movie entirely and devoting their attention to the making-of featurette and the commentary track\\" and that they \\"have little faith that the moviegoers who once fell in love with Kelly's unique take on teen alienation will see S. Darko as anything more than a very minor pop cultural footnote.\\" In an interview with PopMatters magazine journalist J.C. Ma√ßek III, Donnie Darko director Richard Kelly said regarding S. Darko, \\"I hate it when people ask me about that sequel because...I had nothing to do with it. And I hate it when people try and blame me or hold me responsible for it because I had no [involvement]. I don‚Äôt control the underlying rights to [the Donnie Darko franchise]. I had to relinquish them when I was 24 years old. I hate when people ask me about that because I‚Äôve never seen it and I never will, so‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt ask me about the sequel...Those people are making lots of money. They‚Äôre certainly making lots of money.\\" Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a rating of 13% based on reviews from 8 critics.

The City Hall houses the offices of the Mayor and those of the City Council of Baltimore. The building also hosts the city Comptroller, some various city departments, agencies and boards/commissions along with the historic chambers of the Baltimore City Council. Situated on a city block bounded by East Lexington Street on the north, Guilford Avenue (formerly North Street) on the west, East Fayette Street on the south and North Holliday Street with City Hall Plaza and the War Memorial Plaza to the east, the six-story structure was designed by the then 22-year-old new architect, George Aloysius Frederick (1842‚Äì1924) in the Second Empire style, a Baroque revival, with prominent Mansard roofs with richly- framed dormers, and two floors of a repeating Serlian window motif over an urbanely rusticated basement. History The building's cornerstone was laid on the southeastern corner of the new municipal structure (on the northwestern corner of Fayette and Holliday Streets) in October, 1867 (with a famous historical photograph taken of the ceremony) audience stands and crowds from overhead on East Fayette Street with the east side of Holliday Street visible behind the stands showing the famed Holliday Street Theatre, where in November 12, 1814, the new poem by Francis Scott Key, (1779‚Äì1843), \\"The Defence of Fort McHenry\\" was first performed on the stage and next door (to the north), Prof. Knapp's School [attended by famed writer/author/editor H. L. Mencken in the 1880s and the townhouses where the Loyola College and Loyola High School were founded in 1852, just to the left (south) next to the theatre was the vacant lot formerly housing the Theatre Tavern where the new song the Star-Spangled Banner was often sung to the merriment of all [later the CHS/BCC playground], and the edge of the old \\"Assembly-Rooms\\" social/concert/dance hall for the elite that later was home to the Central High School of Baltimore (later the Baltimore City College, 1843‚Äì1873), when the Theatre and School perished in a large famous fire. The massive new \\"pile\\" of a City Hall, acclaimed by many throughout the nation, was officially dedicated on October 25, 1875, $200,000 under-budget from its $2.5 million appropriation, amazingly and proudly in those \\"Robber Baron\\" Gilded Age times of the 19th Century.The \\"New\\" City Hall, in a print in 1873 The site for the \\"new\\" building was selected and some designs were submitted before the American Civil War. The cornerstone for the building, under Frederick's new design, was not laid until 1867; construction was completed eight years later. At a cost of more than $2 million (in 1870s money), the Baltimore City Hall is built largely of many courses and rows of thicknesses of brick with the exterior walls faced with white marble. The marble alone, quarried in Baltimore and Baltimore County (famous \\"Beaver Dam\\" quarry), cost $957,000. The segmented dome capping the building is the work of Baltimore engineer Wendel Bollman, known for his iron railroad bridges. At the time of its construction, the cast iron roof was considered one of the largest structures of its kind. =Renovations= By the end of World War II, City Hall was showing signs of age and deterioration. The slate roof leaked, the exterior marble was eroding in places and the heating, cooling and electrical systems needed to be replaced. Even the cast iron dome's fastenings had rusted through and many plates were cracked. In 1959, 15 pounds of iron ornament came loose and plunged 150 feet into the Board of Estimates hearing room. In 1974 the city voted to renovate the old city hall rather than build a new one. Architectural Heritage Inc., in association with Meyers, D'Aleo and Patton Inc., local architects, were retained to begin the design. The ceremonial chambers were restored and the office space was doubled. In the process the dome was disassembled and put back together. Two years and $10.5 million later the Mayor, the City Council and other city departments moved back into the building. Usable space was increased almost twofold after the renovation, by fitting in two extra floors, by replacing dead storage space in the basement with offices, and by moving corridor walls to maximize office space. In 2009, a building survey found that sections of the building's marble exterior were cracked and crumbling due to age. The city approved spending $483,000 for repairs to be made the same year. Incidents On October 11, 1883, James F. Busey, a Democratic ward operative, was shot and killed outside of City Hall. The man who shot him, William T. Harig, was also a Democrat from another ward. The two got into a political argument and after some punches were thrown, both men drew their pistols and began firing at each other in rapid succession. Busey fired wildly; Harig did not, hitting Busey four times. Harig was taken into custody and charged with murder. Nearly 93 years later, Charles A. Hopkins stormed the temporary City Hall with a hand gun and killed a city councilman. On April 13, 1976, Hopkins, angered that his restaurant was being shut down, killed Dominic Leone, a member of the Baltimore City Council. Hopkins also wounded another city councilman, a police officer and a mayoral aide during the shooting spree. Hopkins was found not guilty by reason of insanity in the shootings but has spent most of his life since then at mental health facilities. In 2007, a Baltimore judge reduced his level of confinement.

Toyota Corolla E10 wagon emblem The Corolla was launched in Japan in November 1966 at a Japanese dealership sales channel called Toyota Corolla Store. Eiji Toyoda said it took hard work to create popular demand, and disputed that Toyota rode a wave of private car ownership that was taking off in the mid-1960s. The Corolla's major competitor was the Datsun 1000, released a few months earlier, along with the Subaru 1000 earlier in May. Its companion, the Toyota Sprinter, was sold at a different dealership sales channel called Toyota Auto Store. The Corolla's development was largely influenced by the success and lessons learned from an earlier, smaller vehicle called the Toyota Publica, which used an air-cooled two-cylinder, boxer-style engine, inspired by the Citro√´n 2CV. The dealership that was named after the Corolla in Japan was previously known as the Toyota Public Store, to sell the Publica. Design The initial car, the KE1x series was small, with a 90 in (2286 mm) wheelbase. The transmission was by a four-speed floor shift manual transmission or a two-speed floor or column shift automatic transmission, with rear wheel drive. At the time, floor shift transmissions were considered only for trucks and four speeds implied that the engine did not have enough torque to drive through only three gears (more torque allows each gear to have a wider spread of engine revolutions, thus requiring fewer gears). This was a big risk for Toyota but the effectiveness of the new system gained in popularity. The suspension in front was MacPherson struts supported by a transverse leaf spring beneath the engine cross-member, with leaf springs connected to a solid axle in back. The engine was originally meant to be for the under 1000 cc tax class but was changed late in the design process to be 1077 cc in order to beat the forthcoming Datsun 1000. In Japan, this put it into a 1000cc engine road tax class but gave it some prestige over the Datsun 1000 - helped by its \\"100 cc advantage\\" advertising campaign. In May 1967 a four-door sedan (KE10F) and a three-door light van (KE16V, essentially a station wagon but classified as a light commercial vehicle in Japan) joined the lineup, as did the \\"Toyoglide\\" two-speed automatic. In March 1968 the range got a facelift, mostly safety upgrades to reflect new American legislation. Since the beginning of the Corolla, Toyota has dependably facelifted each generation after two years and replaced it with an all-new model every four years. The dashboard was now padded and used non-reflective glass, while the front bumper was mounted somewhat higher. Also new were a four-speed column-shift option and the better equipped Corolla SL two-door sedan, using a twin carburetted K-B engine and an extra . The K-B engine was not available with a column shift.

The second-generation KE2# / TE2# model, launched in May 1970, had \\"coke bottle styling\\". It had a longer wheelbase. The front suspension design was improved greatly, using a swaybar, however the rear remained relatively similar. The Corolla became the second-best selling car in the world that year. Grades for sedan were Standard, Deluxe, and Hi-Deluxe. The coup√© was offered in Deluxe, SL, SR, and Levin (\\"levin\\" is Old English for \\"lightning\\"). Minor changes were made in September 1971 with a new grille, turn signal lights, and tail lights, along with similar treatment to the Sprinter. A further facelift was done in August 1972. Japan (1970‚Äì1978) Most models stopped production in July 1974 but the KE26 wagon and van were still marketed in Japan alongside the new 30-series, until production finally ended in May 1978. Load carrying duties of the Corolla Van were lightened by the arrival of the all new Toyota TownAce in 1976, while its twin the Toyota LiteAce was sold at Toyota Auto Store locations next to the Sprinter, with both vehicles using the Corolla/Sprinter 1200 cc 3K-J, and 1600 cc 2T-J and 12T-U engines. Vehicles installed with the 1.6-litre engine were ranked as the top level trim package, as the engine displacement obligated Japanese owners to pay more annual road tax. The sporting Levin was originally only available with the twin-cam engine; in late 1973 this was joined by the somewhat cheaper and less powerful \\"Levin J\\", with the SOHC 2T-B engine. Levin production levels were around 5000 per year. In addition to a variety of other performance upgrades, the Levin has fender extensions and a quicker steering rack than other Corollas, while the Twin Cam versions lack servo brakes so as to make for a sportier feel for the driver.

It was built from August 1974 to July 1981 and marked Toyota's greatest growth in the United States in the wake of the fuel crisis. In addition to its sister model, the Sprinter, there was a redesigned-body version built by Toyota affiliate Daihatsu, called the Daihatsu Charmant. While there were certain fourth-generation models with a longer model life, this generation, when considered as a whole, was the longest-lived one, possibly due to the worldwide recession in the 1970s. A large range of cars were built using this chassis, including Corollas, Sprinters, Daihatsu, and the sporty Levin and Trueno models with the DOHC motor, with a fuel injection upgrade added to Japanese Levin models in January 1977. The 3K engine was used in certain markets and later the 4K, while most Japanese and American models had the bigger 2T engine. A \\"Toyoglide\\" 2/3-speed automatic transmission was added as well as a four-speed(K40/T40) and five-speed(K50/T50) manual transmission, driving to the rear wheels. A three-door \\"liftback\\" (E50) and sports coup√© (E51) was added in 1976. The E40 and E60 series were assigned to the Sprinter variants. In 1975, Toyota introduced the TTC-L (Toyota Total Clean-Lean Burn) on the 12T engine only, using a lean burn implementation. in 1976,Toyota introduced the TTC-C(Toyota total clean-Catalyst) on the 3K-U engine,using single bed catalytic converter and lambda close-loop oxygen sensor with a supercharger smog pump. Even though the E30 and E50 series were replaced by the E70 series in August 1979 in most markets, the original E30 series and the facelifted E50 series both continued production until July 1981.

North America Road & Track was critical of the 1975 Corolla (introduced to North America in late 1974), calling it \\"large and heavy\\" and \\"expensive\\" compared to the Honda Civic and Datsun B210. They also criticized the \\"relatively crude rear suspension\\", lack of interior space, and poor fuel economy when compared to the VW Rabbit. The base model cost in 1975, but only the $2,989 Deluxe model had features comparable to the contemporary pack. Emissions became a problem further into the 1970s especially with the 3K engine, which became popular because of its low fuel consumption. Its replacement, the 4K engine, came with Toyota TTC emissions equipment but only produced , despite a greater 1,290 cc displacement.

All the sedans and wagons, along with the Hardtop coup√©, were only offered with the 1.2-liter 3K, while the Liftback occasionally had the bigger 2T engine. The preceding 20-series Corolla continued to be available for as much as two years as a cheaper alternative, only with the two-door sedan body. A small facelift for the 1977 model year saw a redesigned dashboard and additional trim colors for the interior, and a new grille with small twin horizontal steel beams across it. For the 1979 model year, the last year of the E30 in Europe, the sedan's exterior trim was redesigned for the Deluxe model option with new tail lights (without the plastic chromed surrounds) and another new grille.  Australia  The Corolla was manufactured in Australia at AMI-Toyota's Port Melbourne production facility. It was a popular car on the Australian market and most body styles available elsewhere were utilized. All variants originally came with Toyota's 1166 cc 3K-C engine, which was replaced by the 1290 cc 4K-C engine for the update released in November 1978. Originally released in the SE trim, a luxury CS model was later released in February 1976. The CS featured carpeting, a clock, and reclining cloth seats. From July 1976, government regulated anti-pollution rules resulted in a loss of power for the further curtailed the 1166 cc 3K-C engine. The first facelifted version of the Corolla in Australia was released in November 1978. Among the changes were a new grille and dashboard, along with revised interior trim. The previous 3K-C engine was superseded by the locally built 4K-C. At the same time, an entry- level SE version of the wagon was made available, with a range-topping XX coup√© released in October 1979. Due to the expenditure of manufacturing of the car in Australia, the production continued for several years after it was replaced by the next generation model everywhere else, although the K70 Corolla Liftback was sold alongside as the Toyota T-18. A second facelift was released in July 1980, giving the car a new squared-off grille and rectangular headlamps, however it could not conceal the car's dated styling. This facelift coincided with minor interior trim changes, new seats, revised suspension settings, and a five-speed manual option. Production continued until July 1981, when the already aged fourth-generation E70 range replaced it.

The fourth-generation model was released in March 1979 in Japan, and was the last generation to have the entire lineup in rear-wheel- drive configuration. Export sales commenced in August 1979. Although most of the fourth generation was replaced by 1984, the station wagon and van versions were offered into late 1987. In 1980 Corolla daily production reached an all- time high, averaging 2,346 units. The one-millionth Corolla was a 70-series, built in February 1983. A limited \\"One Million Edition\\" was released in Japan at this time.Car Graphic: '80s Car Archives, p. 16 Development This generation (apart from the wagon) got a new rear coil spring five-link rear end with a panhard rod (two years after its main Japanese rival the Nissan Sunny had made the same change), and the wheelbase was longer at 94.5 in (2,400 mm). A new 1.8 L (1,770 cc/108 in¬≥) 3T engine was optional to some markets, while parts of the world retained the old 4K. The most notable inline-four engine advancement came in 1983, however, as Toyota began offering the 1.6 L (1,587 cc/96 in¬≥) 4A-C. The aluminum head, SOHC engine, although bulkier in size and weight than the K and T engines it was offered alongside, was a grand step up in performance. This would be the last generation of Corollas to use any pushrod or iron cylinder head engines, as Toyota made the decision to focus exclusively on aluminium head, OHC engine design from this point forward. This was the first generation to have power steering. In the US market, this was introduced in 1981 for the 1982 model year. Corolla wagon following the 1982 facelift Interior Various facelifts were made during production. In 1979‚Äì1980, a four-round headlamp setup was used in most markets. A restyle for 1981 involved two rectangular headlamps. A more extensive facelift was given for 1982, involving a new sloping nose with wraparound headlights, remodeled taillights and new bumpers, which on some models were rubber moulded. From August 1983 (subsequent to the changeover to front-wheel drive for the rest of the range) the Corolla Van received a new 1.5-litre 5K-J engine as well as a light restyling, and also a roof raised by . The Wagon/Van underwent a final light facelift in August 1985, including an upgraded 1C-II engine for the diesels.Car Graphic: '80s Car Archives, p. 18 It also received seats that could be folded nearly flat to make the car beddable, and continued in production until being replaced by the 90-series Corolla Van/Wagon in August 1987. Design Design work was started in 1974 by Fumio Agetsuma. The goals he told his team were:\\"The Toyota Corolla story\\", Toyota publication KE-CS/E-8003/D/No.85527/23200, March 1980 * Quiet cars will have a definite edge. Conservation of both resources and fuel will be very important. Economy and value will also carry considerable weight. * Our new Corolla must be as aerodynamically perfect as the parameters allow. It must be comfortable, with enough interior room to move about in. It will need all the modern features that future customers will want as well. * Corolla must change. But we should never destroy the popular base upon which Corolla sales are built. Our new car must reflect the wishes of the consumer, the ordinary people who drive Corollas. * There should be no generation gap with Corolla. It should appeal to young and old alike. Corolla must also transcend national boundaries. It must perform as well in sub-zero temperatures as it does in the tropics or in the heat of the deserts of the world. Above all, Corolla must be a car that pleases. * Corolla has an illustrious tradition. Now, let us build our new Corolla on that tradition, the kind of new Corolla we know the drivers of the world will expect. Japan Toyota Corolla Levin series TE71 (Japan) Corolla Sedan 1600 GT (TE71) In Japan, where it was introduced in March 1979, the Corolla was offered in all body styles: two-door Sedan, four-door Sedan, two-door Hardtop Coup√©, three-door Coup√©, and three-door Liftback Coup√©. The three- or five-door Van models were added to the lineup in August 1979; until then the old 30-series Van had continued to be available. This was also when the 1.8-litre 13T engine first became available in the domestic Japanese market. The Levin continued as a coup√©, with a sporting four-door sedan called the Corolla GT also available. February 1982 saw the introduction of the Toyota 1C diesel engine installed in the Corolla sedan. This car was exclusive to the Toyota Diesel Store to encourage sales at the largely commercial truck retailer for Toyota in Japan, alongside the larger, diesel-engined Toyota Vista. At the same time, the Van was no longer available with the 1.6-litre gasoline engine, but the five-door KE73G wagon was introduced as the first Corolla Wagon to be sold in Japan (rather than the \\"van\\" commercial car). The Van/Wagon continued to be offered until August 1987, skipping the first front- wheel-drive generation of Corollas. After the introduction of the front-wheel drive E80-series Corolla, the Van range received a facelift and a new set of chassis codes (KE72V, KE74V, CE71V).

She currently records for the U.S. independent label Barsuk Records, and the Berlin-based label City Slang. Gibson's most recent album Goners was released October 26, 2018. In addition to her solo work, Gibson has released a collaboration album with Ethan Rose, titled Bridge Carols, in 2009. Early life Gibson was born and raised in the coastal logging town of Coquille, Oregon. She was classically trained on cello in her youth. Gibson's father died of cancer in her childhood. She attended Linfield College in McMinnville, Oregon where she completed pre-medicine requirements and competed for the Women's basketball and Track and Field teams. Career =2004‚Äì2011= Gibson relocated to Portland, Oregon after graduating from college, and worked odd jobs prior to composing music. She began performing songs for patients at hospice homes prior to writing her first extended play, Amends, which was released independently in 2004. She released her debut album, If You Come to Greet Me in 2006 on the Portland-based indie label Hush Records. Gibson collaborated with The Decemberists's drummer Rachel Blumberg on the release, as well as on her second album, Beasts of Seasons. Gibson performed at South by Southwest in 2007 to promote If You Come to Greet Me, and was likened by critics to Jolie Holland. In 2008, she appeared on NPR's inaugural installment of Tiny Desk Concerts . The concept for the Tiny Desk Concerts was conceived following one of her concerts that NPR music journalists Stephen Thompson and Bob Boilen had attended, when they were unable to hear her performance over the noise of the crowd. Boilen then arranged for Gibson to perform at his desk at the NPR office, and it subsequently evolved into a recurring feature. She would later reappear again at the 200th concertLaura Gibson Plays Tiny Desk Concert No. 200. In 2009, she released a collaboration album with Ethan Rose, titled Bridge Carols, which featured experimental vocals and was recorded in various outdoor locations. =2012‚Äìpresent= Her third release, La Grande (2012), was named after and inspired by the city of La Grande, Oregon, and received critical acclaim; Pitchfork wrote of the album: \\"Rather than another exercise in genre-dabbling and dilettantism, La Grande succeeds as a cohesive work thanks to the persistence of Gibson's vision. As a songwriter she's preoccupied with those timeless questions of the human condition, but seldom if ever stumbles into pretension or self-satisfaction.\\" Laura Gibson performing at Whelan's in Dublin, Feb 2019 Gibson has composed music and lyrics for multiple commercials, including a version of \\"Hey There Little Red Riding Hood\\" for Volvo, as well as original music for Microsoft and the Humane Society. In 2014 Gibson composed the song \\"Live Long in Oregon\\" for the Cover Oregon Campaign, the Oregon branch of the Affordable Health Care Act. The commercial was discussed on several national news outlets. After Oregon dropped its state run coverage, the commercial was parodied on the premiere episode of Last Week Tonight with John Oliver, featuring Lisa Loeb in Gibson's role. In 2015, Gibson was principal composer and lyricist for Up the Fall, a musical production created for performers with developmental disabilities, for the Portland-based Non-Profit PHAME Academy. She has also collaborated with Oregon Ballet Theatre and Portland Playhouse. On April 1, 2016, Gibson released her fourth album, Empire Builder. Personal life In 2014, Gibson relocated from Portland, Oregon to New York City to complete a Master of Fine Arts in fiction writing at Hunter College. On March 26, 2015 Gibson's Manhattan apartment was destroyed in a gas explosion which killed two people. Gibson was home at the time of the explosion but escaped unharmed. A recovery fund, established by friends and fans, raised several thousand dollars.

It was the last generation of Corolla to be classified as a subcompact car and the first to be exclusively front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive; the performance option of rear-wheel drive was dropped. For general export, the trim levels were Base, XL, GL, SE, and SE Limited. The GT-i (known as the SX Seca and/or Hatch in Australia) was a high-performance model powered by the 4A-GE engine; it was offered with hatchback and also five-door liftback bodywork in some markets. The North American GT-S coup√© shared the same engine. The all-wheel drive Sprinter Carib wagon used a beam axle rear suspension with coil springs, while the rest used struts all around. In South Africa, the E90 was manufactured and marketed by Toyota under the Carri, Conquest, and Tazz model names. In a pair of similar joint ventures with General Motors, E90 variants with minor cosmetic changes were locally manufactured and sold as the Geo Prizm and Holden Nova in the United States and Australia respectively. The majority of the Corolla range was replaced in June 1991 for the Japanese market, but production for export markets continued into 1992, and Australian Holden production extended until mid 1994. The all- wheel drive wagon was sold from 1988 to 1994 and had different bodywork to other Corollas; it replaced the Tercel 4WD Wagon/Sprinter Carib in Toyota's lineup. It retained the Sprinter Carib name in Japan, but was marketed as the Corolla Touring in Europe and some other countries, and as the Corolla All- Trac in the United States. Japan The 1.3 liter sedan has a four-speed manual transmission (later all 1.3 liter engines had five-speeds) or a three- speed automatic transmission. The only model with the 1.5 liter 5A-FHE was SE- Limited G. The 4WD sedan is powered by the 1.6 liter 4A-F. The 1456 cc 3E engine was only fitted to the Japanese market Van (wagon) commercial version. The Sprinter sedan has a third window in the C-pillar and was unique to Toyota Vista Store Japanese dealerships. The AE92 Levin and Trueno were also fitted with a supercharged engine. It used an SC12 roots type supercharger and a top mounted intercooler that was fed cool air via a scoop on the bonnet. They generated at 4400 rpm as opposed to the naturally aspirated 4A-GE's at 4,800 rpm.

The engines were the 12 valve 2E with or the Twin Cam 16-valve 4A-F with . All engines were carbureted and without catalysts. There is also a GT variant which features disc brakes on all wheels, additional gauges (volt meter & oil pressure gauge), performance suspension and a more powerful 1.6-liter 4A-GE engine with . =Philippines= In the Philippines, the sixth generation Corolla was initially introduced in 1989 with 3 versions: XL and XE, both of which came with the 1.3 liter SOHC 2E engine, and GL, which is the top-of-the-line model with a more powerful 1.6 liter DOHC 4A-F engine. Earlier XL variants came with 4-speed manual transmissions, while later models would come with 5-speed manual transmissions, hence the XL4 (4-speed) and XL5 (5-Speed) designations. =Indonesia= In Indonesia, this generation was assembled locally from 1988 to 1992 and marketed as the \\"Corolla Twincam\\", available only as a 4-door sedan or 5-door liftback. The sedan was available in 3 trim levels: *SE: carburetted 1.3-liter SOHC 2E engine, without power window and power steering. 5-speed manual transmission only. *SE Limited: carburetted 1.6-liter DOHC 4A-F engine, equipped with power steering, power window and central lock. 5-speed manual transmission only. *GTi: fuel injected 1.6-liter DOHC 4A-GE engine, similar to SE Limited but with rear disc brakes, different speedometer and strut bar. Transmission was 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic. The liftback version was only available with the carburetted 1.6-liter DOHC 4A-F engine with equipment similar to the SE Limited sedan. Transmission was 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic. Australia In December 1988, Toyota formed a joint venture with Holden called UAAI to build and market the Toyota Corolla as the Holden Nova. This agreement paralleled two Corolla generations including both the E90 and E100 series.

It has the standard side marker lights and the tail light with the integrated rear fog lamp (except for the wagon, which has the rear fog lamp on the tailgate.) European market Corollas also have headlight washers on the XL and the XLi models. The five- door liftback used the Japanese market Sprinter Cielo body in its entirety, although in Europe it was available with the little 1.3 liter engine as well. The second generation Sprinter Carib was also sold as a Corolla in Europe, where it replaced the Tercel Wagon. This little four-wheel drive station wagon received the \\"Touring\\" suffix in most European markets. The hatchback, representing the most popular and most closely contested market segment in Europe, suffered from being somewhat of a design afterthought since sedans have always been the mainstay of the Corolla lineup in the home market. As opposed to its European competitors, where hatchbacks received a tacked-on trunk to become sedans (the Orion, the Volkswagen Jetta, or the Opel Kadett sedan/Vauxhall Belmont), Toyota started with the sedan and derived the hatchback from it. As a result, the design was a bit truncated and trunk space was minimal at . This was only a fraction more than the much smaller Citro√´n AX, and considerably less than for competitors such as the Kadett and Fiat Tipo (). The diesel version saw substantial sales in countries such as Belgium and Netherlands, where the tax structure favored diesels but where there were also no laws hindering the sales of Japanese cars. In Europe it was only sold with the comparatively spartan XL equipment level. The diesel, while quite slow and with heavy steering, was competitive with similar European cars of the period. From late 1989 the 4A-GE engine in the GTi model was changed from the T-VIS equipped 'big port' variant to the non-T-VIS 'small port' version. For UK specification cars, this increased power from to . The GTi was available as a hatchback or a liftback, although not all markets received both bodystyles. In Sweden, the 4A-GE equipped liftback was marketed as the Corolla CS (Coup√© Sport), beginning in May 1991. It had the new version of the 4A-GE engine and ventilated disc brakes all around.

These two plants made 279,000 units, making a total of 4.5 million of this generation (AE92) made. The North American models depart from the previous generation's boxy styling, for a more contemporary look and improved aerodynamics. They feature longer bumpers and small red conspicuity lights on the rear quarter panels. Cabin air exits through stylish vents behind the rear side windows. A 25th anniversary special edition was produced in 1990, made to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the Corolla line. It included 25th anniversary emblems on the front fender, embroidered on the front seat, and a three-spoke steering wheel. Minor changes for the 1991 model year include the modern Toyota emblem used corporately since 1989 on the grille, all-red taillights, door-mounted and manual lap front seat belts, and new hubcaps for the DX. The rear garnish was deleted for the base model. Toyota Corolla Sport GT-S AE92 The North American Corolla Sport coup√© with retractable headlights was basically a Sprinter Trueno with different front corner lights and longer bumpers. Trim levels are SR5 and GT-S. The GT-S is powered by 4A-GE engine and comes with full body kits. In 1990 the 4A-GE received a revised cylinder head and intake manifold. The new motor featured higher compression, the removal of the T-VIS system, and smaller ports in the intake manifold and is thus commonly referred to as the \\"smallport\\" version. Horsepower jumped from 115 hp (86 kW) to 118 hp (88 kW) and 135 hp (100 kW). The four-wheel drive All-Trac wagon in Base and SR5 trim levels were sold from 1988 to 1992 and had different bodywork to other Corollas. The Corolla All-Trac sedan was sold in very small numbers, shared the same body as the AE92 sedan, with the only visible difference being the tire size. The Geo Prizm shared a slightly different body with the Japan- market Sprinter sedan and Cielo liftback. These models were slightly more basic than their European/Japanese versions. The GSi version was equipped with the 4A-GE.

The sixth-generation five-door hatchback that was made in South Africa was marketed as the Toyota Conquest. The four-door sedan was also available, but with \\"Corolla\\" badging. Production began in October 1988, with a 1.3 liter \\"2E\\" engine or the 1.6 liter \\"4A-F\\" with . The twin cam version of this was also sold, as the GLi Twin Cam for the sedan and RSi for the Hatchback (4A-GE), with . It was also sold as a panel van called the Conquest Carri. The Conquest Carri was simply known as the Toyota Carri from 2000. Toyota Tazz (South Africa) In October 1996 an entry-level model called the Toyota Conquest Tazz appeared. This model had a very low equipment level, originally only available with a four-speed manual mated to the 1.3l 2E engine and missing things such as a rear windshield wiper or a cigarette lighter ‚Äì however, the Tazz received a twin-tip exhaust and body coloured bumpers. A five-speed became available three years later. The higher end version was called the Conquest Zip which was powered by the 1.6l 4A-FE engine. From October 2000 the car received a light facelift with a more ovoid front end treatment and the name was changed to simply Toyota Tazz. This model continued to be built until July 5, 2006. The first version of the Tazz was only offered with a 1300 cc engine, while the facelifted version offered two models: 130, and 160i. Power was and respectively, same as for the Conquest/Corolla from September 1993 on. The Conquest and Corolla were also available in the 1.8 liter 7A-FE engined model beginning in September 1993; this replaced the earlier 1.6 Twin Cam in the Conquest and was available in a number of equipment levels in the Corolla (sedan), from GL to the mildly sporting GSX.

Managerial career In 1920 he was appointed manager of Southend and, although his tenure only lasted a year, he oversaw their rise into the football league. In 1920 he moved to Queens Park Rangers where he was manager for four years before returning to Southend as assistant manager. His next role was as chief scout for Fulham and he subsequently went on to become their third manager in five years when he took up the post in 1929, taking over from the same person as he had at Southend, Joe Bradshaw. He finished his managerial career at Luton Town between 1936 and 1938. He continued to scout for other clubs, including Brentford, up until his death at the age of 90.

In Japan, this series arrived to the market in August 2000; however, exports were typically not achieved until 2001 and 2002 depending on the market. The sedan and station wagon arrived first in August 2000, followed by the five-door hatchback in January 2001, and the Europe-only three-door hatchback in 2002. Toyota supplemented the original styling with an edgier, hatchback-only styling treatment from 2002. Sedans and wagons sold in Japan adopted a new front-end design in 2004, although this version did not typically reach export markets. In other Asian markets and the Americas, the ninth generation Corolla (sedan and wagon only) had unique front and rear styling treatments with mild updates over the model's production run. The E120/E130 model offered a longer wheelbase. It is built on a shortened V50 series Vista platform. From being marketed as a premium compact sedan, to an affordable hatchback, the ninth generation Corolla was designed as a \\"global\\" automobile to suit different market needs. This was one of Toyota's most versatile and most popular models ever produced. The E120/E130 series Corolla has also spawned another separate hatchback model called the Matrix, sold in the United States, Canada and Mexico, which forms the basis of the Pontiac Vibe, which was in turn sold in Japan as the Voltz. The E120 series was replaced by the E140 or E150 series in late 2006 or early 2007 but the E120 continued to be produced in China until 2017. The E120 Corolla won the What Car? magazine's \\"Car of the Year\\" award for 2002.  Japanese/international version  = Japan = For the Japanese market, trim levels for the Corolla Sedan were X Assista Package (Base), X, G and Luxel. In 2003, 1.5-liter 4WD sedans were made available in the Japanese market. The station wagon model is called the Corolla Fielder in Japan and the five-door hatchback is called the Corolla RunX, launched in 2001. The Toyota Allex is a five-door hatchback that replaced the Sprinter sedan, a badge engineered version of the Corolla RunX. The Allex was exclusive to Toyota Netz Store locations, while the Corolla RunX was exclusive to Toyota Corolla Store locations. JDM Corolla RunX trim levels are: RunX X (1500 cc 1NZ-FE engine), RunX S (1800 cc 1ZZ-FE engine) and RunX Z as well as RunX Z Aero (1800 cc 2ZZ-GE engine). The first two of three JDM Allex trim levels were not differentiated with a visual badge, but offered similar packages to the RunX with the base model featuring the 1500 cc 1NZ-FE engine, the middle range featuring the 1800 cc 1ZZ-FE engine and the Allex RS180 featuring the 1800 cc 2ZZ-GE engine. Allex models offered a different colour range and had minor styling differences to the RunX, such examples include the plastic trim above the license plate area being chrome as opposed to body colour like on the RunX. Interior cloth patterns also differed from the RunX. All RunX and Allex models featured ABS and driver/passenger airbags as well as all auto windows and tinted rear glass as standard. The RunX X and Allex (base) models featured 14\\" steel wheels with optional alloys, optional side, front and rear skirting, automatic or manual gearbox options, and manual A/C. RunX S and Allex (mid range) models featured 15\\" steel wheels with optional 16\\" alloys, optional side, front and rear skirting, automatic or manual gearbox options, optional front fog lamps, manual or automatic climate controlled A/C. RunX Z, Z Aero and Allex RS180 models featured 15\\" steel wheels or optional 16\\" alloys, optional (but mostly purchased as standard) side, front and rear skirting and automatic climate controlled A/C as standard. These models offered an extra 4-speed tiptronic automatic or 6-speed manual transmission, opposing the rest of the lineup. The Corolla Spacio (Verso in Europe) moved on to the new platform, with later models adding a third row of fold-down seating in the back. The Corolla sedan sold in Japan also differed slightly as compared to the other markets with a slightly different headlamp and taillamp design. = Australasia (Australia and New Zealand) = 2004-2007 Toyota Corolla Ascent sedan (ZZE122; Australia) The E120 Corolla sold in Australia was available as a sedan, wagon and five-door hatchback (Seca). Trim levels offered were the Ascent, Ascent Sport, Conquest, Levin and Ultima. A small number of models were built in South Africa, with the high-performance Sportivo (hatchback only) built exclusively in South Africa. South African-built Corollas will carry a vehicle identification number starting with A; Japanese-made examples have a VIN starting with J. The Sportivo was powered by the 2ZZ-GE engine and a six-speed manual gearbox, while the other models had the 1ZZ-FE. Minor changes in 2004 included the grille and replacing the headlights with a \\"tear drop\\" type. The Sportivo was discontinued in Australia from 2006 due to the prohibitive costs involved in modifying the engine to comply with Euro IV emissions. All the other models had their engine power and torque reduced with October 2005 production from and from to comply with Euro IV. From May 2006, the Ascent and Ascent Sport models were upgraded with standard front power windows and passenger airbag, while the Conquest models had ABS as standard. The equipment upgrades were not applied to the wagon, which ceased production in August 2006. In New Zealand, the Corolla hatch was offered in three trim levels: GL, GLX & T Sport. The GL proved most popular and differed from the GLX only by a lack of woodgrain trim, rear electric windows, passenger airbag and alloy wheels. GLX models mostly featured tan coloured interior with woodgrain trim, front fog lights and alloy wheels as standard. The T Sport model offered a sportier look with spoiler, side skirts, front fog lights and 15-inch alloy wheels as standard. All models had the 1.8-liter 1ZZ-FE, offered either a four-speed automatic or five-speed manual and had manual A/C as standard. The Corolla sedan was offered only in the GL and GLX trim level, whilst the station wagon offered in the GL trim only. = Europe = Toyota Corolla (United Kingdom) For the European market, the Corolla was offered in 3-door hatchback, 5-door hatchback, sedan or saloon, and wagon or Kombi / Estate forms. The high- performance Corolla T-Sport with 1.8-liter 2ZZ-GE engine was available in certain countries.

It debuted in mid 2001 as a bigger and more luxurious variant of the Japanese Corolla, featuring unique interior and exterior panels that separates it from the basic Corolla. The Corolla Altis is targeted at consumers who prefer more comfort than the standard Corolla but do not wish to buy the more luxurious Camry. Two versions of engines are available: the 81 kW (110 bhp), 1.6 L 3ZZ- FE engine and the 100 kW (134 bhp), 1.8 L 1ZZ-FE engine, both with VVT-i technology. In 2004, the Corolla Altis received its first facelift. Changes include a new grille design, a sleeker front bumper, redesigned fog lamps, new LED tail lights, different alloy wheels and minor interior updates (auto climate control became a standard feature in lower end variants). Two years later, to keep up with its newer competitors, the Corolla Altis received its second facelift. Exterior changes include another redesigned grille, redesigned chrome rear license plate ornament, a new third LED brake light, and new audio switches on the steering wheel. A new aerokit and new wing mirrors with signal indicators (similar to the 2007 Camry) is available as an optional package in Malaysia. A low end variant of the Corolla Altis is also branded as the Toyota Limo, featuring lower spec and intended for taxi businesses in Thailand. It is not to be confused with the low end taxi version of the Toyota Vios which is also called Toyota Limo in Indonesia. In Malaysia, the Corolla Altis was introduced in mid 2001. Notably in Malaysia the models sold had tail lights that are identical to the models that are sold outside of Asia and Southeast Asia. It features three-round insets for the tail lamps instead of the standard single round inset used in other Asian markets. These were later replaced with the standard single round insets. Both the 1.6 L and 1.8 L models were sold in Malaysia. In Singapore, Toyota's exclusive authorised dealer Borneo Motors originally sold the Japanese version of the Corolla, but later replaced it with the Corolla Altis in 2004 with 1.6L and 1.8L variants in automatic transmissions only. The 1.8L model offered optitron display for the speedometer clusters, rain sensors and a zig-zag automatic gearshift layout over the 1.6L model. In terms of product lifespan (production lasted for seven years) and number of units sold, the Corolla Altis easily outlived its Corolla predecessors, making it currently the most popular Corolla generation in Southeast Asia. ASEAN engines: * 3ZZ-FE ‚Äî 1.6 L (1598 cc) I4, 16 Valve, DOHC, VVT-i, EFI with 3-way catalytic converter, Maximum Output: 110 hp / 6,000 rpm and Maximum Torque: 150 Nm / 4,400 rpm. * 1ZZ-FE ‚Äî 1.8 L (1794 cc) I4, 16 Valve, DOHC, VVT-i, EFI with 3-way catalytic converter, Maximum Output: 134 hp / 6,000 rpm and Maximum Torque: 171 Nm / 4,200 rpm. The ninth generation Corolla was sold in China as the Corolla EX through Tianjin FAW Toyota Motor Co. Ltd. alongside the newer tenth-generation Corolla. It was also known as the Ëä±ÂÜ† (Hua Guan) which is a direct translation of 'Corolla' (crown of the flower) in Mandarin Chinese. Three trim levels were available namely: Value, Excellence & Elegance. The Excellence and Elegance editions were offered with a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic gearbox while the Value edition was only available in manual transmission. The Corolla EX was powered by a 1ZR-FE dual VVT-i engine. An electric variant was produced called the Ranz EV by the automative marque called Ranz which was owned by Sichuan FAW Toyota Motor. The production of the Corolla EX commenced in February 2004 and ended on 17 February 2017 after a 13-year run. = North America = 2003‚Äì2004 Toyota Corolla CE (US) In 1998, Toyota Masao Saito's E120 design proposal was chosen and frozen for production in early 1999, with patents filed on 22 July 1999 at the Japan Patent Office under patent number 1120997. The North American model was designed to be bigger than the Japanese Corolla, and was based on the Corolla Altis distributed in Southeast Asia. It came to the United States in March 2002 for the 2003 model year, following its unveiling at the 2002 North American International Auto Show in January. Trim levels offered are CE, LE, and S, continuing from the previous generation. Production for the ninth-generation Corolla ended in December 2007, with the tenth-generation Corolla introduced in January 2008 as a 2009 model. The Corolla carried over the 1ZZ-FE of the previous generation, but updated with a plastic intake manifold. Power output was increased to 130 hp. The Corolla grew in height from the previous generation, and used larger 15-inch wheels, which resulted in increased size and weight compared to the previous generation. The S trim level featured sportier front and rear bumpers and side skirts, but maintained side skirts and fog lights like the previous model. For the 2005 model year, the exterior styling was refreshed with a new front bumper and grille, clear rear turn signal lenses, and updated wheel covers for the CE and LE trims. Interior differences include white on black Optitron gauges for the LE trim, a rear center headrest, and an updated radio head unit. Certain models were updated with Electronic Throttle Bodies and an Anti- Lock Braking System. The Manual transmission was dropped for the CE and LE trims, and was only available on the S. 2005‚Äì2008 Toyota Corolla S (US) This was the first generation of the Corolla to be available in Mexico, and was offered in 3 trim levels: the base CE, the mid-range LE and S, the latter the only trim to offer a manual transmission. The base CE or ‚ÄúClassic Edition‚Äù trim came standard with manual windows and locks, but was available with optional power windows and locks. The mid-range LE or ‚ÄúLuxury Edition‚Äù came with blue gauge faces with dark blue numbers and orange needles. It was also fitted with mock-wood interior accents. Some models came with a 2-compartment center console and leather seats. On the exterior, the LE and above models came with color-keyed mirrors and door guards, and blacked out B-pillars. 15-inch 6 spoke Alloy wheels were optional, as well as a rear spoiler. The S or ‚ÄúSport‚Äù trim adds side skirts, front and rear ground effects, a rear spoiler, and 15-inch 6 spoke aluminum alloy wheels as standard. Some models were available with blacked out headlight housings. On the interior, the color scheme is changed to black, with subtle chrome accents. The S trim also adds a gauge set with white numbers and red markings and needles for a sporty appearance. North American market engines: * 2002‚Äì2008 ‚Äî 1ZZ-FE ‚Äì 1.8 L (1794 cc) I4, 16-valve DOHC, FI, VVT-i, 130 hp (97 kW) ‚Äì CE, LE, S (TRD 1.8L Supercharger is available for this engine) * 2005 & 2006 ‚Äì 2ZZ-GE ‚Äì 1.8 L (1796 cc) I4, 16-valve DOHC, FI, VVTL-i, 170 hp (127 kW) ‚Äì XRS 2007 Toyota Corolla LE (US) Shown as a concept in November 2003, a sporty XRS model (ZZE131), introduced in 2004 between the 2005 and 2006 model years only, featured the high-revving at 7,600 rpm, at 4,400 rpm 2ZZ-GE engine and 6-speed manual from the Toyota Celica GT-S and Lotus Elise. The 2ZZ-GE motor was actually developed with collaboration from Yamaha motors (like other wide- angle head GE, GTE, and GZE Toyota engines), and uses similar technologies found in its sibling motor the 1ZZ-FE. The XRS was very similar to its Corolla S cousin in appearance, however there are significant changes to the mechanical components. The 2ZZ-GE uses a cable throttle (unlike the electronic throttle control of the 2ZZ-GE in the later years of the Celica GT-S) with a lift set-point at 6,700 rpm and an 8,200 rpm redline. The close ratio C60 6-speed manual transmission, also found in the Toyota Matrix XRS, was the only transmission available. The sport-tuned suspension lowered the Corolla XRS by . A Yamaha designed brace spans the front strut towers as well as a X-brace for the rear towers. The steering column is thicker and the power steering system is unique. The rear drum brakes from the S (and other Corolla trims) were replaced with the drum in disc brakes from the Celica GT-S and the ABS system was upgraded to a four-channel with EBD (Electronic Brakeforce Distribution). Absent are Traction Control and Stability Control Systems (VSC). The Corolla XRS was given 5 spoke 16-inch painted aluminum alloy wheels (similar to the Matrix) and shod with Michelin Pilot Primacy P195/55-R16 summer performance tires and equipped with a Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS). The wheels are the most noticeable difference in exterior appearance from the Corolla S that features 6-spoke 15-inch alloy wheels. Other exterior differences being the key colored grill surround (other trims have chrome), XRS badge at the back, rear discs, and the slightly lowered appearance. Interior of 2005-2008 Toyota Corolla S (US) The interior features a three- spoke leather wrapped steering wheel from the Celica, and leather shift knob, and leather shift boot from the Matrix XRS. Optitron gauges like those found in Lexus vehicles replaced the standard red on white gauges. The interior has dark blue plastic with silver accenting and beige pillars from the bottom of the windows to the beige headliner. The dashboard is black. The front seats were replaced with manually adjustable sports seats with more side bolster. The 4 main seats are black cloth with a blue hexagon pattern and black cloth sides. The front floor mats are from the Corolla S. Due to the rear X-brace, the rear seats do not fold 60-40 like those found in the other Corolla trims. Color choices for the Corolla XRS were: Super White II, Silver Streak Mica, Phantom Gray Pearl, Black Sand Pearl, Impulse Red Pearl, and Indigo Ink Pearl. The Corolla XRS was on sale in the United States, Canada, and Puerto Rico. Toyota estimated to sell approximately 5,000 Corolla XRS per year. Production numbers have not been released, however it has been speculated that less than 7,000 were produced (unofficially estimated at 6,619 units). Unofficially, Toyota Canada has disclosed that 818 were sold MY (model year) 2005 and only 279 MY 2006, bringing a total of 1,097 Corolla XRS being sold in the country over the 2 model years. This limited production and minimal exterior differences resulted in the Corolla XRS being a unique sleeper hiding among the extremely common Corolla S and is the final outright performance designed model from Toyota that was targeted towards \\"single male buyers\\" before the complete switch to the Toyotas' Scion youth oriented brand. The Corolla XRS introduced in 2009 as a successor used the 2.4L 2AZ-FE from the Toyota Camry and Scion tC and was available with a 5-speed manual or 5-speed automatic. While the 2009 Corolla XRS caters to a greater range of customers with the available automatic transmission, it is also significantly slower and although its design intentions are similar, it is a different car from the original 2005‚Äì2006 Corolla XRS. To commemorate 20 years of building Toyota Corolla in Canada, Toyota Canada offered the 20th Anniversary Edition Corolla CE for the 2008 model year, which includes power door locks with keyless entry, cruise control, power windows with driver's side auto down, special edition badging, aluminium alloy wheels and power sunroof. = South America = In Brazil, the Corolla sedan and the Corolla Fielder wagon are built locally. It is available with the 1.6L 3ZZ-FE engine (sedan only) and the 1.8L 1ZZ-FE. The sedan is externally identical to both US and ASEAN (Altis) models, but the Fielder has different styling from the Japanese version. Starting from the 2008 model (released May 2007), the 1.8L engine has flexible fuel technology. Unlike most other flexible fuel vehicles in Brazilian market, the Corolla Flex has the same power ratings either with ethanol or gasoline.

The AE85 and AE86 Corolla Levin and Sprinter Trueno (SR-5/GT-S in US) retained rear-wheel drive from the previous E70 generation,/ along with the three-door \\"liftback\\" (E72), three-door van (E70) and five-door wagon (E70) of the previous generation, which remained in production. The AE86 ultimately gained international prominence in the motorsport of drifting and wide popularity in Showroom Stock, Group A, and Group N, Rally and Club racing. In a joint venture with General Motors, mildly restyled versions of the front-wheel drive AE82 sedan and liftback were locally manufactured and sold in the United States as the Chevrolet Nova. Design The front-wheel-drive wheelbase was now 95.6 in (2,430 mm). It was the first Corolla to top the New Zealand top- ten lists, ending Ford's dominance of that market. A shorter hatchback range, called the Corolla FX in Japan and the Corolla Compact in Germany, arrived in October 1984 on the front-wheel-drive platform.Car Graphic: '80s Car Archives, p. 21 The three- and five-door hatchbacks resembled the Corolla sedan with a truncated rear deck and trunk. Although there was a five-door liftback model of the basic Corolla, the shorter FX hatchback was sold alongside it. The Corolla FX replaced the Toyota Starlet in North America. A DOHC 16-valve engine, designated 4A-GE, was added in 1983 on the rear-drive cars. It was a 1.6 L (1,587 cc) inline-four and produced , turning the Levin/Trueno (Japan), Corolla GT coup√© (Europe) and Corolla GT-S (North America) into a what was arguably a sports car. The three-door FWD hatchback was also available with this engine; it was known as the Corolla FX-16 in North America. This engine was also combined with the front-drive transaxle to power the mid-engined Toyota MR2. The Sprinter sports cars, in two-door coup√© and three-door liftback forms, were notable for being the line's first use of pop-up headlamps, which the equivalent Corolla Levin sports models did not have. The liftback has a . Launched in Japan in May 1983, it reached Europe (including the right-hand drive UK market) three months later, and sold well in most European markets. The car was facelifted in May 1985, receiving larger headlights akin to those installed on the coup√©s.

Japan The 1.3-litre 2A engine was replaced by the more modern 12-valve 2E engine along with a May 1985 facelift at Toyota Corolla Store locations. The range began with the 1300 Custom DX and ended with the 1600 GT Limited, introduced in June 1986.Car Graphic: '80s Car Archives, p. 19 The FX hatchback lineup was considered a semi-separate line and received a different nose and different equipment levels than its sedan and liftback counterparts. The 1.3 was not available in the FX, targeted at sportier buyers, until the 2E engine became available.

From 1985 to 1988, NUMMI in Fremont, California built a rebadged version of the Sprinter sedan sold by Chevrolet as the Chevrolet Nova. During calendar 1985, Corolla sedans and Sprinter-type 5-door hatchbacks (sold under both Nova and Corolla nameplates) were added, with the Toyota-branded US built cars gradually superseding imports from Japan and Nova hatchbacks being offered from the 1986 model year. Only the Corolla FX hatchback, launched for 1987 to replace the 3-door AE86 Corolla Sport liftback, was imported from Japan. The Nova's successor, the Geo Prizm, was another American-built rebadged Corolla sold in the US from 1989 to 2002. While all the rear-wheel drive 80-series Corollas were AE86 chassis in North America, the VINs differentiated between the three equipment levels: the DX got AE85, the SR-5 got AE86, and the GT-S received an AE88 VIN.

Victories included a class win in the 1985 Rally Portugal (its first), with Jorge Ortig√£o driving and J. Batista navigating. The car continued to be raced as late as the 1993 Acropolis Rally, with its best finish a third overall in the 1989 Rallye C√¥te d'Ivoire (with Adolphe Choteau/Jean-Pierre Claverie). The AE86 became international prominent in the motorsport of drifting. Owners may heavily modify their AE86 models to where the only connection to the original model is the bodyshape.

His main field of study was the political structures of Ancient Greece. Life Born the elder son of a German-Jewish lawyer, Ostwald was raised in Dortmund, where he attended the Municipal Gymnasium (St√§dtliches Gymnasium). He had always intended to become a classical scholar, but when this possibility was removed by the passage of the Nuremberg Laws of 1935, which closed the German universities to Jews, he decided instead to pursue his interests in teaching and scholarship by becoming a rabbi.Ralph M. Rosen and Joseph Farrell, eds., Nomodeiktes: Greek Studies in Honor of Martin Ostwald (Ann Arbor 1993) xi-xii. But during the Reichskristallnacht on November 9, 1938, Ostwald was arrested together with his father and his younger brother, Ernst. Forced to leave his parents behind in Germany, Ostwald and his brother were able to emigrate to England via the Netherlands on a Kindertransport. In England, however, Ostwald and other German refugees were, in the wake of the British defeat at Dunkirk, transferred to a concentration camp in Canada.North, Helen F. \\"Martin Ostwald (1922‚Äì2010)\\". The Classical World 103.4 (2010). pp.539‚Äì40. Following his release, Ostwald enrolled at the University of Toronto, where he was able to resume his original interest in classical studies. After graduation in 1946 he continued his studies in the (at that time still quite new) Committee on Social Thought at the University of Chicago, where he wrote an M.A. thesis on the treatment of the Orestes myth by Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides. In 1949 he became a doctoral student under fellow German immigrant Kurt von Fritz at Columbia University in New York City. In 1951 he published his first scholarly article on the Prytaneion Decree (IG 13 131).\\"The Prytaneion Decree Re-examined,\\" American Journal of Philology 72 (1951) 24‚Äì46. The following year Ostwald received his Ph.D. after completing his dissertation on the Athenian constitution.\\"The Unwritten Laws and the Ancestral Constitution of Ancient Athens\\". Diss. Columbia 1952. After receiving his Ph.D. Ostwald taught for one year at Wesleyan University. He then returned to Columbia and taught there until 1958, when he joined the Classics Department at Swarthmore College. A few years later he transferred one-third of his teaching to the graduate programs in Classical Studies and Ancient History at the University of Pennsylvania, an arrangement made possible by a special agreement between the two institutions. Ostwald continued to teach undergraduates at Swarthmore and graduate students at Penn until his retirement in 1992. In addition to these primary appointments, Ostwald taught as visiting professor at Princeton University, the University of California at Berkeley, Balliol College, Oxford, at the √âcole des Hautes √âtudes en Sciences Sociales in Paris and, for many years, at Tel Aviv University. Among Ostwald's many publications, some of the most notable include a translation of Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics;Aristotle: The Nicomachean Ethics. Translation with introduction, notes, and glossary (Indianapolis and New York, 1962). a handbook on the meters of Greek and Roman poetry, on which he collaborated with Thomas G.

It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1975. and Description and history The Blanche K. Bruce House is located in the southernmost part of Washington's Shaw neighborhood, on the north side of M Street between 9th and 10th Streets. It is one half of a duplex, a 3-1/2 story structure, with walls of brick and a brick foundation, and a slate mansard roof providing a full fourth floor. The two building units have virtually identical exteriors, with a three-bay ground floor with the entrance in the left bay, and two bays in each of the upper floors. Ground floor windows are set in rounded-arch openings, as are third-floor windows, which rise into the elongated mansard roof's steep section. The short fourth floor is capped by a dentillated edge at the transition between the roof sections. The house was built in 1865 and is fairly typical of the Second Empire architecture then popular; its designer is unknown. It was the home of Blanche Bruce, who represented Mississippi as a United States Senator from 1875 to 1881. Bruce was the first African-American to serve a full term in the Senate; during his tenure he also briefly served as the Presiding Officer of the United States Senate in 1879, the only former slave to do so. During his term, Bruce advocated for the integration of the United States Army, and for policies supporting the needs of poor (and recently freed) African Americans. Bruce remained in Washington after his term ended in 1881, serving as the districts recorder of deeds, and as a trustee of Howard University.

The missile originally started out as an anti-ship missile to be launched from submarines.APL D-40 Cannonball In 1952 the US Army Chief of Ordnance funded the project for development as an anti-tank missile. Between 1953 and 1956, around 50 D-40 missiles were test fired.Weeks, John. Men Against Tanks. New York: Mason/Charter, 1975. Design The D-40 is a ‚Äúspherically‚Äù shaped missile about in diameter and had a maximum range around . The D-40 was propelled by a solid-fueled rocket and stabilized using three pairs of ‚Äútangential rocket nozzles‚Äù and was guided originally by radio signals and later by signals sent down a wire trailing behind the missile. The first design, the ‚ÄúD-40A‚Äù, weighed 300 lbs while the later versions ‚ÄúD-40B‚Äù and D-40C‚Äù were around 150 lbs. The main rocket was angled downward at 45 degrees in order to give the missile the necessary lift and to propel the missile forward. While the six ‚Äútangential rocket nozzles‚Äù stabilized the missile by controlling the pitch, roll, and yaw. While in flight the missile is guided by means of joystick and binoculars. The development of the ‚ÄúD-40B‚Äù focused on reducing the missiles weight and increasing the range. The ‚ÄúD-40C‚Äù replaced the rocket fuel of the first two types with a new type which caused less smoke when it burned allowing for increased visual control of the missile by the guider. The D-40 carried two types of warheads, either a 50 lb HEAT warhead or a 65 lb HESH warhead. Both types of warheads were enough to destroy all tanks of the time. In 1956 it was decided that the missile was too expensive and there were worries that the bulky D-40 missile would be too difficult to operate in combat.

Her father, Gaspare, was a prominent ballet dancer and choreographer, and her mother, Antonia, a ballerina. Her brothers Stanislao and Pollione were opera singers.Appolonia 1964 on donizettisociety.com As a singer, she made her debut in Naples at the Teatro dei Fiorentini in 1814 in Giovanni Cordella's L'Avaro, followed by important engagements in Bologna in 1816, also appearing in Genoa, Florence; in 1817 as Giulia La Vestale, and in Bergamo. She married Italian bass Giuseppe de Begnis (1793‚Äì1849) when she was only 16. The marriage lasted only a few years and the two separated in 1825. Personality Giuseppina Ronzi de Begnis by Karl Briullov Her figure has been described by her contemporaries, including Donizetti, as fat and voluptuous; a critic of Teatri di Milano wrote that \\"Ronzi was nevertheless a very beautiful figure on the stage, and for those who are not enemies of the flesh, she was very beautiful.\\"Teatri di Milano, Almanacco 1836, pp. 9‚Äî14 Shortly after her arrival in Paris, in August 1819, she became incensed when she learned that she was expected to sing Donna Anna in the upcoming production of Don Giovanni at the Opera instead of Zerlina.Castellani, Giuliano, (2009),Ferdinando Paer: Biografia, Opere e Documenti degli anni pariginip. 138 Ronzi was also known for her capricious attitudes and for having confrontations and arguments with female colleagues, including the famous altercation with Anna Del Sere during the rehearsals of Maria Stuarda. The two leading ladies took the heated match between the two crowned heads a step further, and when Ronzi over-emphasized her response to Elisabetta with the famous ‚ÄúVil bastarda‚Äù insult, a raging fight ensued. Donizetti might have fuelled the animosity between the two primadonnas when in response to an overheard comment by Ronzi that he ‚Äúprotected that whore of a Del Sere‚Äù he responded that he protected neither of them. Afterwards adding that \\"those two queens were whores, and you two are equally whores\\": :The rumbustious Ronzi De Begnis felt a bit ashamed but did not respond to the Maestro‚Äôs remarks and the rehearsal continued. Some reports published by a theatrical magazine would have us believe that Del Sere was badly bruised during the fight and needed to convalesce for two weeks. Be that as it may, these confrontations, although distorted in varying degrees by the contemporary media and later on by writers and biographers, did not help the staging of the new opera in Naples.\\"Migliavacca 2000, pp. 27‚Äî32 The incident was highly publicized and generated a scandal that prompted the censors to ban the libretto forcing Donizetti to make a last-minute change to the libretto and story-line to fit his music to a story of Florentine feuds in the 1200s re-titled Buondelmonte. Her temperament notwithstanding, composers like Giovanni Pacini, Saverio Mercadante, Vincenzo Bellini and Gaetano Donizetti were fond of her. In a sonnet dedicated to \\"La Ronza\\", the highly acclaimed Roman poet Giuseppe Gioachino Belli, who had been mesmerized by her Norma, confirms her voluptuousness and its seductive effects on the public and concluded that the whole theater seemed to waver: \\"Blessed be this witch who enchants us\\".Belli 1957, p. ? Shortly after her husband's death in New York, she retired from the stage. She died in Florence, in 1853 aged 53, leaving a substantial inheritance to her only child Clotilde who in 1843 had married the tenor Gaetano Fraschini. Clotilde was most likely born during the mid 1820s hiatus. Operatic career =Early encounter with Rossini= In 1818, Rossini secured her as Ninetta in his La gazza ladra for the grand inauguration of the newly built Teatro Nuovo in Pesaro. Rossini had grand ideas for the occasion and he wanted Isabella Colbran and Andrea Nozzari for a colossal production of his Armida; however budget constraints forced him to downsize his dreams, but when an attempt to secure his friend Rosa Morandi for La gazza ladra failed, he engaged Giuseppina Ronzi de Begnis and, at a reduced fee, her husband Giuseppe de Begnis as the Mayor. This move left him with enough money to engage a first class tenor like Alberico Curioni.Osborne 2007, p. 55 =Early years in Paris and London= In January 1819, Giuseppina and her husband moved to Paris where they sang for the re-opening of the Th√©√¢tre Italien in the Parisian premiere of Ferdinando Pa√´r's dramma semi-serio I Fuoriusciti di Firenze on 20 March. The opera received a good review in Le Moniteur Universel, and the Journal de Paris praised Giuseppe for his Uberto and Giuseppina for her Isabella.Castellani, Giuliano, (2009),Ferdinando Paer: Biografia, Opere e Documenti degli anni parigini p. 127 In the meantime Rossini had been informed that the de Begnises had been secured for La gazza ladra.Castellani, Giuliano, (2009),Ferdinando Paer: Biografia, Opere e Documenti degli anni parigini p. 505 The prospects were encouraging and on 5 May the couple sang in Pietro Alessandro Guglielmi's La pastorella nobile. Positive reviews greeted the couple during the summer of the same year when they sang in Il matrimonio segreto and Rossini's Il turco in Italia. In Paris she appeared as Susanna in Le Nozze di Figaro, and Rosina in Il barbiere di Siviglia. She capitalized on her Parisian sojourn and found time to study with Pierre Garat honing buffo roles of Paisiello and Mozart. In 1822, she went to London, where she obtained brilliant successes at the King's Theatre, notably in Pietro l'Eremita (an oratorio version of Mose in Egitto) on 30 January 1822, Rossini's La donna del lago and the title role in his Matilde di Shabran. Other Rossini successes in London included Fiorilla in Il Turco in Italia and Amenaide in Tancredi. =In Italy= Ronzi returned to Italy in 1825, her marriage fell apart, and she might have had problems with her voice. For the next five years she worked hard to refine her technique and extension until she became a soprano sfogato like Grisi, Ungher, Malibran, and Pasta. On 13 April 1831 the Milanese newspaper L'Eco announced her return to Naples to restart her operatic career. She was engaged at the San Carlo in Naples, where she also won considerable acclaim in roles Donizetti wrote specifically for her. Ronzi's biggest triumph in Naples was her performances as the title character in Rossini's Semiramide; in Rome, in 1834, she earned an equally remarkable success in her first Norma at the Teatro Apollo. Her debut at Milan's La Scala took place in 1834, when she successfully sang the title role in Donizetti's Gemma di Vergy. She had repeated curtain calls and a critic wrote that her \\"demeanour was noble, natural and dignified without exaggeration and affectation, her accent was beautiful, crisp and expressive; her singing all Italian and of the best school.\\" 1834 was possibly her most memorable year because she also had a great success in Rome in her first Anna Bolena, and in Florence she charmed the public with her Romeo in Bellini's I Capuleti e i Montecchi as well as Desdemona in Rossini's Otello ‚Äì a role she had already sung in Naples. =Working with Donizetti= Donizetti created the leading roles in five very important operas specifically for her: Fausta, Sancia di Castiglia, Maria Stuarda, Gemma di Vergy, and Roberto Devereux. Her Elisabetta in Roberto Devereux received rave reviews and on the second night, 15 November 1837, a critic wrote that \\"the applauses started with Ronzi de Begnis' entrance and ended with the rond√≤ at the end of the opera.\\" L'Interprete Commerciale, 1837 Her repertory included other operas by Donizetti such as L'assedio di Calais, L'esule di Roma, Parisina, Pia de' Tolomei, and Belisario. Next to Henriette Sontag, Ronzi was considered the best Donna Anna and the best Norma after Giuditta Pasta. In fact, for almost a decade (1834‚Äì1843) she was a most successful and reliable Norma. Bellini was quite happy with her technique and in 1834 he was contemplating writing an opera for the San Carlo starring Ronzi de Begnis.Cambi 1943, pp.480‚Äî482 References Notes Cited sources *Appolonia, Giorgio, Giuseppina Ronzi de Begnis il soprano donizettiano, in Donizetti Society Newsletter No. 61 and 62, January and May 1994 *Belli, Giuseppe Gioachino, (Ed) G.

He was shot down, captured and subsequently imprisoned in a succession of prisoner of war camps in Germany before escaping and forming a network which assisted fellow escapers. Grimson remained on the run in the Third Reich, hunted by the Gestapo, but eventually disappeared probably having been captured and murdered by the SS in or after mid-April 1944 in the Danzig area. Early life Grimson was born in Putney, south-west London in October 1915, the son of plumber William John Grimson and his wife Rebecca.England & Wales, Birth Registrations, 1915 The family lived in Bendemeer Road in Putney until 1930 when they moved to Gladwyn Road. He had two older brothers William John and Frederick, a sister Lilian and a younger brother Walter. Grimson abandoned his architectural studies to join the RAF in early 1938,Dominy (1974), p.22 in order to help support his mother and siblings after their father died in 1937.CWGC details ‚Äì George GrimsonEngland & Wales, Death Registrations, 1937 Royal Air Force service Grimson trained at RAF Uxbridge and trained as aircrew to fly as a wireless operator/air gunner. After completing training he was posted to No. 37 Squadron RAF and commenced flying operational sorties in Vickers Wellington bombers at the outbreak of war.Dominy (1974), p.22-24 No. 104 Sqn. =Prisoner of War= George Grimson was the wireless operator aboard a No. 37 Squadron RAF Vickers Wellington (serial number \\"L7792\\") squadron codes \\"LF-L\\" which was shot down by anti-aircraft flak on 15 July 1940 during a raid on barges in the dockyards of the German port of Hamburg by the anti-aircraft defences over Bremen. He was one of only two survivors who baled out before the bomber exploded.Chorley (1992) Allocated prisoner of war number 134, Grimson passed through Luftwaffe interrogation centre Dulag Luft, before being sent to Stalag Luft I at Barth, Stalag VIIIb, Lamsdorf and back to Barth before finally being sent to Stalag Luft III.Dominy (1974), p.26-27 =Escaper= At Barth, Grimson escaped with a number of other prisoners while being used to bring the harvest in. Unlike his later more sophisticated escapes Grimson simply kicked his German guard in the backside and ran, but he was quickly recaptured.Dominy (1974), p.28 He started to learn to speak German and collate information which would aid his next attempt. Grimson began to work on relationships with any Germans who he felt might be able to supply something which could help him. Grimson assisted with another escape from Stalag Luft I Barth in which he dressed as a German guard to assist another prisoner, Tubby Dixon, to escape by digging a drainage trench under the wire. The attempt failed when a real guard was waiting outside the wire to recapture him. Fenton's War ‚Äì George GrimsonDominy (1974), various In September 1942 Grimson made his first solo escape attempt when he noticed that the German in charge of the stores where he helped out, looked very similar to himself. Grimson stole the German corporal‚Äôs pay book and camp pass and smuggled them into the camp for the prisoner's forgery department to quickly copy them so he could get them replaced before the soldier noticed. A copy of a German fatigue uniform was made for him with German badges, a leather belt and a pistol holder made from cardboard stained brown with boot polish. An RAF cap was adjusted to resemble the German version to complete the disguise. Dressed up he walked to the camp gate where the sentry opened the gate hardly looking at his papers and let him through reaching the outer gate the guard took a quick look at the papers and let him pass through. Grimson‚Äôs pass would not let him out of the main gate until darkness so he hid for 6 hours and escaped through the gate by the officer‚Äôs mess and into the woods where he changed into his civilian outfit and made straight for the railway station. His papers passed scrutiny and he then purchased a ticket to a point on his journey to the Swiss border. His papers were checked at the next stop and he was arrested and returned to prison camp. Fenton's War ‚Äì George Grimson Model of Stalag Luft III prison camp. In late December 1942, Grimson and Allan Morris walked out of the camp with a group of German servicemen but were recaptured 2 days later, when they showed more courtesy than was expected from a German Officer. The prisoner forgery department had produced the documents necessary for the escape and the German uniforms to go over their civilian clothing. Both Grimson and Morris had again noticed that they had near doubles serving as officers in the German guard company who they impersonated and both had lain in wait for 3 nights fully disguised in their German uniforms waiting for the right moment when the two clones attended the show. Outside the wire they changed into civilian clothes disguised as foreign workers, walking to Sagan station and catching a train to the outskirts of Leipzig before being caught. Fenton's War ‚Äì George GrimsonJohn Dominy [Ron Mogg] (20 November 1974)Sergeant Escapers Littlehampton Book Services Ltd; First Edition In the late Spring of 1943 he made another attempt which was foiled before hatching a scheme to dress up as a guard with a fake rifle and march 4 prisoners out of the camp. Later he escaped again as the prisoners were being moved to Stalag Luft VI and was seen aboard the same train as the other prisoners however he was travelling in comfort impersonating a Gestapo agent. His plan was based on the confusion he had seen in the move to Heydekrug during which he had impersonated a German \\"ferret\\" (security search soldier). Wearing German overalls and leather belt pretending to test the boundary lighting, with a large ammeter fashioned from tins and dangling leads. Whilst the prisoners were preparing to transfer he stole a ladder setting it at a point 10 feet from a guard machine gun tower, calling up to the guard in fluent German he stepped over the warning wire and used his ladder to climb up to the lights, placing a plank across the two barbed wire fence lines. He tested a few bulbs, shouting to the guard each time he had to move. Twice Grimson was questioned by patrolling guards but each time he convinced them he was looking for a broken wire. 30 minutes later he dropped some pliers just inside the outer wire and told the guards that he was going to get them and return via the gate. He slowly lowered himself down, cracked a joke with the guard and retrieved his pliers. He walked calmly down the line until slipping into the woods where he changed into his civilian outfit and made off to the railway station. Grimson changed trains and was making his way towards the Baltic to Stettin in the hope of stowing away on a ship. On his fifth day of freedom, he was arrested as he tried to board a Swedish ship. Fenton's War ‚Äì George Grimson As a prisoner in Stalag Luft VI he was involved in the Tally-Ho network, whose acquisition of German uniforms, passes and ration cards from suborned guards enabled Grimson to escape from the camp in February 1944 dressed as a German soldier.RAF Escapers ‚Äì George Grimson Arriving in Danzig (Gda≈Ñsk) he renewed contact with the Polish underground and organised a courier system using Germans on the Tally-Ho payroll.

Cotangent complexes were originally defined in special cases by a number of authors. Luc Illusie, Daniel Quillen, and M. Andr√© independently came up with a definition that works in all cases. Motivation Suppose that X and Y are algebraic varieties and that is a morphism between them. The cotangent complex of f is a more universal version of the relative K√§hler differentials Œ©X/Y. The most basic motivation for such an object is the exact sequence of K√§hler differentials associated to two morphisms. If Z is another variety, and if is another morphism, then there is an exact sequence :f^*\\\\Omega_{Y/Z} \\\\to \\\\Omega_{X/Z} \\\\to \\\\Omega_{X/Y} \\\\to 0. In some sense, therefore, relative K√§hler differentials are a right exact functor. (Literally this is not true, however, because the category of algebraic varieties is not an abelian category, and therefore right-exactness is not defined.) In fact, prior to the definition of the cotangent complex, there were several definitions of functors that might extend the sequence further to the left, such as the Lichtenbaum‚ÄìSchlessinger functors Ti and imperfection modules. Most of these were motivated by deformation theory. This sequence is exact on the left if the morphism f is smooth. If Œ© admitted a first derived functor, then exactness on the left would imply that the connecting homomorphism vanished, and this would certainly be true if the first derived functor of f, whatever it was, vanished. Therefore, a reasonable speculation is that the first derived functor of a smooth morphism vanishes. Furthermore, when any of the functors which extended the sequence of K√§hler differentials were applied to a smooth morphism, they too vanished, which suggested that the cotangent complex of a smooth morphism might be equivalent to the K√§hler differentials. Another natural exact sequence related to K√§hler differentials is the conormal exact sequence. If f is a closed immersion with ideal sheaf I, then there is an exact sequence :I/I^2 \\\\to f^*\\\\Omega_{Y/Z} \\\\to \\\\Omega_{X/Z} \\\\to 0. This is an extension of the exact sequence above: There is a new term on the left, the conormal sheaf of f, and the relative differentials Œ©X/Y have vanished because a closed immersion is formally unramified. If f is the inclusion of a smooth subvariety, then this sequence is a short exact sequence. This suggests that the cotangent complex of the inclusion of a smooth variety is equivalent to the conormal sheaf shifted by one term. Early work on cotangent complexes The cotangent complex dates back at least to SGA 6 VIII 2, where Pierre Berthelot gave a definition when f is a smoothable morphism, meaning there is a scheme V and morphisms and such that , i is a closed immersion, and h is a smooth morphism. (For example, all projective morphisms are smoothable, since V can be taken to be a projective bundle over Y.) In this case, he defines the cotangent complex of f as an object in the derived category of coherent sheaves X as follows: *L^{X/Y}_0 = i^*\\\\Omega_{V/Y}, *If J is the ideal of X in V, then L^{X/Y}_1 = J/J^2 = i^*J, *L^{X/Y}_i = 0 for all other i, *The differential L^{X/Y}_1 \\\\to L^{X/Y}_0 is the pullback along i of the inclusion of J in the structure sheaf \\\\mathcal{O}_V of V followed by the universal derivation d : \\\\mathcal{O}_V \\\\to \\\\Omega_{V/Y}. *All other differentials are zero. Berthelot proves that this definition is independent of the choice of V and that for a smoothable complete intersection morphism, this complex is perfect. Furthermore, he proves that if is another smoothable complete intersection morphism and if an additional technical condition is satisfied, then there is an exact triangle :\\\\mathbf{L}f^*L^{Y/Z}_\\\\bullet \\\\to L^{X/Z}_\\\\bullet \\\\to L^{X/Y}_\\\\bullet \\\\to \\\\mathbf{L}f^*L^{Y/Z}_\\\\bullet[1]. The definition of the cotangent complex The correct definition of the cotangent complex begins in the homotopical setting. Quillen and Andr√© worked with the simplicial commutative rings, while Illusie worked with simplicial ringed topoi. For simplicity, we will consider only the case of simplicial commutative rings. Suppose that A and B are simplicial rings and that B is an A-algebra. Choose a resolution r: P^{\\\\bullet} \\\\to B of B by simplicial free A-algebras. Applying the K√§hler differential functor to P^{\\\\bullet} produces a simplicial B-module. The total complex of this simplicial object is the cotangent complex LB/A. The morphism r induces a morphism from the cotangent complex to Œ©B/A called the augmentation map. In the homotopy category of simplicial A-algebras (or of simplicial ringed topoi), this construction amounts to taking the left derived functor of the K√§hler differential functor. Given a commutative square as follows: :File:Commutative square.svg there is a morphism of cotangent complexes L^{B/A} \\\\otimes_B D \\\\to L^{D/C} which respects the augmentation maps. This map is constructed by choosing a free simplicial C-algebra resolution of D, say s: Q^{\\\\bullet} \\\\to D. Because P^{\\\\bullet} is a free object, the composite hr can be lifted to a morphism P^{\\\\bullet} \\\\to Q^{\\\\bullet}. Applying functoriality of K√§hler differentials to this morphism gives the required morphism of cotangent complexes. In particular, given homomorphisms A \\\\to B \\\\to C, this produces the sequence :L^{B/A} \\\\otimes_B C \\\\to L^{C/A} \\\\to L^{C/B}. There is a connecting homomorphism, :L^{C/B} \\\\to \\\\left (L^{B/A} \\\\otimes_B C \\\\right )[1], which turns this sequence into an exact triangle. The cotangent complex can also be defined in any combinatorial model category M. Suppose that f: A\\\\to B is a morphism in M. The cotangent complex L^f (or L^{B/A}) is an object in the category of spectra in M_{B//B}. A pair of composable morphisms, f: A\\\\to B and g: B \\\\to C induces an exact triangle in the homotopy category, :L^{B/A}\\\\otimes_BC\\\\to L^{C/A}\\\\to L^{C/B}\\\\to \\\\left (L^{B/A}\\\\otimes_BC \\\\right )[1].

Then there are quasi-isomorphisms :\\\\begin{align} L^{B \\\\otimes_A C/C} &\\\\cong C \\\\otimes_A L^{B/A} \\\\\\\\\\\\ L^{B \\\\otimes_A C/A} &\\\\cong \\\\left (L^{B/A} \\\\otimes_A C \\\\right ) \\\\oplus \\\\left (B \\\\otimes_A L^{C/A} \\\\right ) \\\\end{align} If C is a flat A-algebra, then the condition that \\\\operatorname{Tor}^A_q(B,C) vanishes for is automatic. The first formula then proves that the construction of the cotangent complex is local on the base in the flat topology. =Vanishing properties= Let . Then: *If B is a localization of A, then . *If f is an √©tale morphism, then . *If f is a smooth morphism, then is quasi-isomorphic to Œ©B/A. In particular, it has projective dimension zero. *If f is a local complete intersection morphism, then has projective dimension at most one. *If A is Noetherian, , and I is generated by a regular sequence, then I/I^2 is a projective module and LB/A is quasi-isomorphic to I/I^2[1]. Examples = Smooth schemes = Let X \\\\in \\\\operatorname{Sch}/S be smooth. Then the cotangent complex is \\\\Omega_{X/S}. In Berthelot's framework, this is clear by taking V=X. In general, √©tale locally on S, X is a finite dimensional affine space and the morphism X\\\\to S is projection, so we may reduce to the situation where S= \\\\operatorname{Spec}(A) and X = \\\\operatorname{Spec}(A[x_1, \\\\ldots, x_n]). We can take the resolution of \\\\operatorname{Spec}(A[x_1,\\\\ldots,x_n]) to be the identity map, and then it is clear that the cotangent complex is the same as the K√§hler differentials. = Closed embeddings in smooth schemes = Let i:X \\\\to Y be a closed embedding of smooth schemes in \\\\text{Sch}/S. Using the exact triangle corresponding to the morphisms X \\\\to Y \\\\to S, we may determine the cotangent complex \\\\mathbf{L}_{X/Y}. To do this, note that by the previous example, the cotangent complexes \\\\mathbf{L}_{X/S} and \\\\mathbf{L}_{Y/S} consist of the K√§hler differentials \\\\Omega_{X/S} and \\\\Omega_{Y/S} in the zeroth degree, respectively, and are zero in all other degrees. The exact triangle implies that \\\\mathbf{L}_{X/Y} is nonzero only in the first degree, and in that degree, it is the kernel of the map i^*\\\\mathbf{L}_{X/S} \\\\to \\\\mathbf{L}_{Y/S}. This kernel is the conormal bundle, and the exact sequence is the conormal exact sequence, so in the first degree, \\\\mathbf{L}_{X/Y} is the conormal bundle C_{X/Y}. = Local complete intersection = More generally, a local complete intersection morphism X \\\\to Y with a smooth target has a cotangent complex perfect in amplitude [-1,0]. This is given by the complex > I/I^2 \\\\to \\\\Omega_{Y}_X. For example, the cotangent complex of the twisted cubic X in \\\\mathbb{P}^3 is given by the complex > \\\\mathcal{O}(-2)\\\\oplus\\\\mathcal{O}(-2)\\\\oplus\\\\mathcal{O}(-2) \\\\xrightarrow{s} > \\\\Omega_{\\\\mathbb{P}^3}_X. = Cotangent complexes in Gromov-Witten theory = In Gromov‚ÄìWitten theory mathematicians study the enumerative geometric invariants of n-pointed curves on spaces. In general, there are algebraic stacks > \\\\overline{\\\\mathcal{M}}_{g,n}(X,\\\\beta) which are the moduli spaces of maps > \\\\pi: C \\\\to X from genus g curves with n punctures to a fixed target. Since enumerative geometry studies the generic behavior of such maps, the deformation theory controlling these kinds of problems requires the deformation of the curve C, the map \\\\pi, and the target space X. Fortunately, all of this deformation theoretic information can be tracked by the cotangent complex \\\\mathbf{L}_{C/X}^\\\\bullet. Using the distinguished triangle > \\\\pi^*\\\\mathbf{L}_{X}^\\\\bullet \\\\to \\\\mathbf{L}_{C}^\\\\bullet \\\\to > \\\\mathbf{L}_{C/X}^\\\\bullet \\\\to associated to the composition of morphisms > C \\\\xrightarrow{\\\\pi} X \\\\rightarrow \\\\text{Spec}(\\\\mathbb{C}) the cotangent complex can be computed in many situations. In fact, for a complex manifold X, its cotangent complex is given by \\\\Omega_X^1, and a smooth n-punctured curve C, this is given by \\\\Omega_C^1(p_1 + \\\\cdots + p_n). From general theory of triangulated categories, the cotangent complex \\\\mathbf{L}_{C/X}^\\\\bullet is quasi-isomorphic to the cone > \\\\text{Cone}(\\\\pi^*\\\\mathbf{L}_{X}^\\\\bullet \\\\to \\\\mathbf{L}_{C}^\\\\bullet) \\\\simeq > \\\\text{Cone} (\\\\pi^*\\\\Omega_X^1 \\\\to \\\\Omega_C^1(p_1+\\\\cdots + p_n)) See also *Andr√©‚ÄìQuillen cohomology *Deformation theory *Kodaira-Spencer class *Atiyah class Notes References = Applications = * https://mathoverflow.net/questions/372128/what-is-the-cotangent-complex-good- for = Reference =   Category:Algebraic geometry Category:Category theory Category:Homotopy theory ","title":"Cotangent complex"},{"id":"17346879","text":"Rhyd is a small village in the Welsh County of Gwynedd, located on the B4410 road, halfway between Maentwrog and Llanfrothen.

The band was formed in the end of 1999 by bass player Olli-Pekka \\"Oppu\\" Laine and guitarist Ilkka \\"Ile\\" Laaksomaa. Soon they were accompanied by a young drummer Mikko \\"Junior\\" Pietinen and the following year by lead singer Jani \\"Jo√£nitor\\" Muurinen. In 2004 singer Jani Muurinen left the band after three albums. In 2005 Mannhai got Pasi Koskinen persuated to replace Muurinen as a vocalist. Koskinen is best known for being the lead singer of Amorphis during the years 1996‚Äì2004. Band's name Mannhai comes from an Indian belief. In the countrysite of the state of Uttar Pradesh in India, people in villages thought an evil disguised spirit called \\"the Mannhai\\" snatched their children when night falls. History Olli-Pekka Laine, Ilkka Laaksomaa and Mikko Pietinen recorded three instrumental songs for a starters. With this demo tape they tried and lured their old friend Jani Muurinen as their singer. Till the end of the year 2000 another three song demo tape came out and was introduced to Spinefarm Records which led into signing a recording contract. Without a single live gig Mannhai started to record their first album. Their debut album The Sons of Yesterday's Black Grouse in 2001 got people interested in the new band. Mannhai started intense touring until the August 2002. Then it was time to get back in the studio for their second record. With this second album Evil under the Sun Mannhai topped its predecessor. The record includes the classic Mannhai song \\"Spiritraiser\\" as well as the video, directed by Tuukka Temonen (former bass player of the Finnish Punk/Hard Core group Apulanta). In 2004 the third album saw the daylight. The Exploder is a lot more experimental than the other albums by Mannhai. The third album has influences significantly from progressive metal and from the seventies heavy metal, but even from blues with Maria H√§nninen singing the backing vocals on some of the tracks, and Esa Kuloniemi from Honey B and the T-bones playing slide guitar on some others. The record being something else than its predecessors it is also more complicated and scattered, including only few straightforward rock and roll songs. The progressive sound has a lot to do with keyboards, played by Kasper M√•rtenson (ex-Amoprhis). When The Exploder came out Mannhai made a practical joke: The web address www.mattivanhanen.com directed websurfers not to the web pages of then Prime Minister of Finland Matti Vanhanen but to the website of Mannhai. In November 2004 in Tavastia Club, a popular rock venue in Helsinki, Muurinen did his last gig as a member of Mannhai. Muurinen quit the band as to pursue his artistic studies. All this time Muurinen had lived and studied in Turku as the rest of the band had always kept their headquarters and rehearsals in Helsinki. In the spring of 2005 Mannhai got a new lead singer, Trond Skog, who had been the vocalist for a Norwegian stoner rock band Honcho. Mannhai hit the road for a three-week Central European tour. However, in the middle of the tour the other Mannhai-guys had no choice other than release Skog from the singing duties for good. That being for the reasons not related to the rest of the band. And there they were, in the middle of Europe, playing couple of instrumental gigs and trying to figure out what to do. Laine, in despair, called his old bandmate Pasi Koskinen from Amorphis years up. As to his surprise Koskinen accepted the vocal challenge, and he flew over to Berlin and stepped into the boots of the frontman. The tour went fine with Koskinen and after the tour he officially joined the band. With this brand new line-up Mannhai started to work on a new album. They got the creative process nicely going with plenty of new material, with Koskinen taking care most of the lyrics writing. The fourth album Hellroad Caravan came out in the beginning of 2006 and the audience liked the new stuff: The third track of the album \\"Spaceball\\" went to the top of the Single list on the Official Finnish Charts. The new album was very compact and straightforward, groovy stoner rock. Most of the digressing that filled the Exploder was cut off. The role of the keyboards stayed much behind the rumbling bass heavy guitar sound, with only a hint of psychedelia. There's a visiting star Henri Sorvali in keyboards, best known for his work in folk/pagan metal band Moonsorrow. Mannhai's song \\"Spiritraiser\\" is often featured on the Finnish television show, The Dudesons as well as being heard on their feature-length movie. In the fall 2006 the drummer Junior Pietinen left Mannhai to work full-time in his other groups Bleak and Happiness. For the forthcoming Mannhai tour in Europe Mannhai took Nalle √ñsterman as a sideman for drums. Nalle √ñsterman has worked with Oppu Laine in death metal band Chaosbreed as well. After drummer Pietinen departed the band, Mannhai has been doing only a few gigs per year, most of them abroad in festivals like Ragnarock Open Air Festival. No new music has been composed or published as a band since 2007. While Mannhai not being active Olli-Pekka Laine aimed his musical focus to a new band, Barren Earth, with an old Mannhai and Amorphis bandmate Kasper M√•rtenson being the keyboardist. The 5th of February 2009 Mannhai officially announced on their website that they are on undefined hiatus for the time being. Members Mannhai was formed by Oppu Laine and Ile Laaksomaa. Oppu Laine has played bass guitar in bands like Amorphis and Chaosbreed. Original vocalist Jani Muurinen (a.k.a. \\"Jo√£nitor\\" or \\"Janitor\\") used to be a singer in Xysma before Mannhai. Janitor's successor Pasi Koskinen, a former Amorphis member as well, has vocal duties in his other bands Shape of Despair and Ajattara. Mikko Pietinen (\\"Junior\\") moved on to play with his other bands Bleak (disbanded 2009) and Happiness. Tour drummer Nalle √ñsterman has been in bands like Chaosbreed, Gandalf and Lullacry and is a drummer of Sonic Roots. =Current line-up= * Olli-Pekka \\"Oppu\\" Laine ‚Äì bass guitar 1999- * Ilkka \\"Ile\\" Laaksomaa ‚Äì guitar 1999- * Pasi Koskinen ‚Äì vocals 2005- * Nalle √ñsterman ‚Äì tour drummer 2006‚Äì =Former members= * Mikko \\"Junior\\" Pietinen ‚Äì drums 1999‚Äì2006 * Jani \\"Jo√£nitor\\" Muurinen ‚Äì vocals 2000‚Äì2004 * Kasper M√•rtenson ‚Äì keyboards 2003‚Äì2004 Discography =Albums= * The Sons of Yesterday's Black Grouse (2001) * Evil Under the Sun (2002) * The Exploder (2004) * Hellroad Caravan (2006) =Singles= * Spiritraiser / A new day yesterday (Jethro Tull -cover) (2003) * Rock to the top / Slave to the Flame / Live Wire (M√∂tley Cr√ºe -cover) (2004) * Spaceball / Rocketeer (2005) * Under the sign of the wolf (split single with Reverend Bizarre) \\"Forever My Queen\\" (Pentagram -cover) (2006) Videography * Spiritraiser ‚Äì from the album \\"Evil Under the Sun\\" * Rock to the top ‚Äì from the album \\"The Exploder\\" * Spaceball ‚Äì from the album \\"Hellroad Caravan\\" References External links * Official website * Mannhai at MySpace Category:Finnish heavy metal musical groups Category:Stoner rock musical groups ","title":"Mannhai"},{"id":"17346912","title":"Dean Hassard"},{"id":"17346920","text":"Cala, My Dog! is a 2003 Chinese comedy film directed by Lu Xuechang. The film had its world premiere at the 2003 Berlin International Film Festival and its Chinese release a week earlier on February 2, 2003. The film follows a blue- collar worker (Ge You) in Beijing as he attempts to acquire a dog license in 18 hours for his beloved unlicensed Cala. The film was co-produced by the successful film director Feng Xiaogang. Though a comedy, Cala, My Dog! moves at a subdued pace. Despite this, during its world premiere in Berlin, sales agents from Celestial Pictures billed the film as a more zany, traditional comedy.  Plot  Lao Er (Ge You) lives a humdrum life as a laborer in Beijing with his wife Yu Lan (Ding Jiali), his son Liangliang (Li Bin) and his beloved dog, Cala. Lao Er's life is thrown into turmoil when the government in an effort to control rabies, decrees that all unlicensed dogs are to be cast out of the city. When Cala is confiscated during an evening walk, the police give Lao Er eighteen hours until 4:00 in the afternoon of the next day to obtain a license for 5000 RMB ($600), an exorbitant amount of money for a worker in Lao Er's position. Lao Er, determined to get his dog back, sends his son to coerce an uncle working in the pound to get the dog back. When that fails, he goes to his neighbor (Li Qinqin) in order to use her dog's license to trick the pound. When that too fails, Lao Er becomes desperate, all while dealing with a wife who becomes increasingly jealous over his visits to his neighbor, and a son who is arrested after getting into a fight...

The theory is due to Fabien Morel and Vladimir Voevodsky. The underlying idea is that it should be possible to develop a purely algebraic approach to homotopy theory by replacing the unit interval , which is not an algebraic variety, with the affine line , which is. The theory requires a substantial amount of technique to set up, but has spectacular applications such as Voevodsky's construction of the derived category of mixed motives and the proof of the Milnor and Bloch-Kato conjectures. Construction homotopy theory is founded on a category called the homotopy category. This is the homotopy category for a certain closed model category whose construction requires two steps. =Step 1= Most of the construction works for any site . Assume that the site is subcanonical, and let be the category of sheaves of sets on this site. This category is too restrictive, so we will need to enlarge it. Let be the simplex category, that is, the category whose objects are the sets : and whose morphisms are order-preserving functions. We let denote the category of functors . That is, is the category of simplicial objects on . Such an object is also called a simplicial sheaf on . The category of all simplicial sheaves on is a Grothendieck topos. A point of a site is a geometric morphism , where is the category of sets. We will define a closed model structure on in terms of points. Let f : \\\\mathcal{X} \\\\to \\\\mathcal{Y} be a morphism of simplicial sheaves. We say that: * is a weak equivalence if, for any point of , the morphism of simplicial sets x^*f : x^*\\\\mathcal{X} \\\\to x^*\\\\mathcal{Y} is a weak equivalence. * is a cofibration if it is a monomorphism. * is a fibration if it has the right lifting property with respect to any cofibration which is a weak equivalence. The homotopy category of this model structure is denoted \\\\mathcal{H}_s(T). =Step 2= This model structure will not give the right homotopy category because it does not pay any attention to the unit interval object. Call this object , and denote the final object of by . We assume that comes with a map and two maps such that: * If is the canonical morphism , then :: :: * The morphism is a monomorphism. Now we localize the homotopy theory with respect to . A simplicial sheaf \\\\mathcal{X} is called -local if for any simplicial sheaf \\\\mathcal{Y} the map :\\\\text{Hom}_{\\\\mathcal{H}_s(T)}(\\\\mathcal{Y} \\\\times I, \\\\mathcal{X}) \\\\to \\\\text{Hom}_{\\\\mathcal{H}_s(T)}(\\\\mathcal{Y}, \\\\mathcal{X}) induced by is a bijection. A morphism f : \\\\mathcal{X} \\\\to \\\\mathcal{Y} is an -weak equivalence if for any -local \\\\mathcal{Z}, the induced map :\\\\text{Hom}_{\\\\mathcal{H}_s(T)} (\\\\mathcal{Y}, \\\\mathcal{Z}) \\\\to \\\\text{Hom}_{\\\\mathcal{H}_s(T)} (\\\\mathcal{X}, \\\\mathcal{Z}) is a bijection. The homotopy theory of the site with interval is the localization of with respect to -weak equivalences. This category is called \\\\mathcal{H}(T, I). =Formal Definition= Finally we may define the homotopy category. :Definition. Let be a finite-dimensional Noetherian scheme, and let denote the category of smooth schemes over . Equip with the Nisnevich topology to get the site . We let the affine line play the role of the interval. The above construction determines a closed model structure on , and the corresponding homotopy category is called the homotopy category. Note that by construction, for any in , there is an isomorphism : in the homotopy category. Properties of the theory The setup, especially the Nisnevich topology, is chosen as to make algebraic K-theory representable by a spectrum, and in some aspects to make a proof of the Bloch-Kato conjecture possible. After the Morel-Voevodsky construction there have been several different approaches to homotopy theory by using other model category structures or by using other sheaves than Nisnevich sheaves (for example, Zariski sheaves or just all presheaves). Each of these constructions yields the same homotopy category. There are two kinds of spheres in the theory: those coming from the multiplicative group playing the role of the -sphere in topology, and those coming from the simplicial sphere (considered as constant simplicial sheaf). This leads to a theory of motivic spheres with two indices. To compute the homotopy groups of motivic spheres would also yield the classical stable homotopy groups of the spheres, so in this respect homotopy theory is at least as complicated as classical homotopy theory. The stable homotopy category A further construction in A1-homotopy theory is the category SH(S), which is obtained from the above unstable category by forcing the smash product with Gm to become invertible. This process can be carried out either using model-categorical constructions using so-called Gm-spectra or alternatively using infinity-categories. For S = Spec (R), the spectrum of the field of real numbers, there is a functor :SH(\\\\mathbf R) \\\\to SH to the stable homotopy category from algebraic topology. The functor is characterized by sending a smooth scheme X / R to the real manifold associated to X. This functor has the property that it sends the map :\\\\rho: S^0 \\\\to \\\\mathbf G_m, i.e., \\\\\\\\{-1, 1\\\\\\\\} \\\\to Spec \\\\mathbf R[x, x^{-1}] to an equivalence, since \\\\mathbf R^\\\\times is homotopy equivalent to a two-point set. has shown that the resulting functor :SH(\\\\mathbf R)[\\\\rho^{-1}] \\\\to SH is an equivalence.

A nuclear holocaust, nuclear apocalypse or atomic holocaust is a theoretical scenario involving widespread destruction and radioactive fallout, causing the collapse of civilization, through the use of nuclear weapons. Under such a scenario, some or all of the Earth is made uninhabitable by nuclear warfare in future world wars. Besides the immediate destruction of cities by nuclear blasts, the potential aftermath of a nuclear war could involve firestorms, a nuclear winter, widespread radiation sickness from fallout, and/or the temporary loss of much modern technology due to electromagnetic pulses. Some scientists, such as Alan Robock, have speculated that a thermonuclear war could result in the end of modern civilization on Earth, in part due to a long-lasting nuclear winter. In one model, the average temperature of Earth following a full thermonuclear war falls for several years by 7 to 8 degrees Celsius (13 to 15 degrees Fahrenheit) on average. Nonetheless, early Cold War-era studies suggested that billions of humans would survive the immediate effects of nuclear blasts and radiation following a global thermonuclear war.The Effects of a Global Thermonuclear War. Johnstonsarchive.net. Retrieved on 2013-07-21. Some scholars argue that nuclear war could indirectly contribute to human extinction via secondary effects, including environmental consequences, societal breakdown, and economic collapse. Additionally, it has been argued that even a relatively small-scale nuclear exchange between India and Pakistan involving 100 Hiroshima yield (15 kilotons) weapons, could cause a nuclear winter and kill more than a billion people. Since 1947, the Doomsday Clock of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists has visualized how close the world is to a nuclear war. The threat of a nuclear holocaust plays an important role in the popular perception of nuclear weapons. It features in the security concept of mutually assured destruction (MAD) and is a common scenario in survivalism. Nuclear holocaust is a common feature in literature and film, especially in speculative genres such as science fiction, dystopian and post-apocalyptic fiction. Etymology and usage The English word \\"holocaust\\", derived from the Greek term \\"holokaustos\\" meaning \\"completely burnt\\", refers to great destruction and loss of life, especially by fire. One early use of the word \\"holocaust\\" to describe an imagined nuclear destruction appears in Reginald Glossop's 1926 novel The Orphan of Space: \\"Moscow ... beneath them ... a crash like a crack of Doom! The echoes of this Holocaust rumbled and rolled ... a distinct smell of sulphur ... atomic destruction.\\"Reginald Glossop, The Orphan of Space (London: G. MacDonald, 1926), pp. 303‚Äì306. In the novel, an atomic weapon is planted in the office of the Soviet dictator, who, with German help and Chinese mercenaries, is preparing the takeover of Western Europe. References to nuclear destruction often speak of \\"atomic holocaust\\" or \\"nuclear holocaust.‚Äù For instance, U.S. President Bush stated in August 2007: \\"Iran's active pursuit of technology that could lead to nuclear weapons threatens to put a region already known for instability and violence under the shadow of a nuclear holocaust\\". Likelihood of nuclear war As of 2020, humanity has about 13,410 nuclear weapons, thousands of which are on hair- trigger alert. While stockpiles have been on the decline following the end of the Cold War, every nuclear country is currently undergoing modernization of its nuclear arsenal. The Bulletin advanced their symbolic Doomsday Clock in 2015, citing among other factors \\"a nuclear arms race resulting from modernization of huge arsenals\\". John F. Kennedy estimated the probability of the Cuban Missile Crisis escalating to nuclear conflict as between 33% and 50%. In a poll of experts at the Global Catastrophic Risk Conference in Oxford (17‚Äê20 July 2008), the Future of Humanity Institute estimated the probability of complete human extinction by nuclear weapons at 1% within the century, the probability of 1 billion dead at 10% and the probability of 1 million dead at 30%. These results reflect the median opinions of a group of experts, rather than a probabilistic model; the actual values may be much lower or higher. Scientists have argued that even a small-scale nuclear war between two countries could have devastating global consequences and such local conflicts are more likely than full-scale nuclear war.Regional Nuclear War Could Devastate Global Climate, Science Daily, December 11, 2006 Moral importance of human extinction risk In his book Reasons and Persons, philosopher Derek Parfit posed the following question: > Compare three outcomes: #Peace. #A nuclear war that kills 99% of the world‚Äôs > existing population. #A nuclear war that kills 100%. (2) would be worse than > (1), and (3) would be worse than (2). Which is the greater of these two > differences? He continues that \\"Most people believe that the greater difference is between (1) and (2). I believe that the difference between (2) and (3) is very much greater.\\" Thus, he argues, even if it would be bad if massive numbers of humans died, human extinction would itself be much worse because it prevents the existence of all future generations. And given the magnitude of the calamity were the human race to become extinct, Nick Bostrom argues that there is an overwhelming moral imperative to reduce even small risks of human extinction. Likelihood of complete human extinction The United States and Soviet Union/Russia nuclear stockpiles, in total number of nuclear bombs/warheads in existence throughout the Cold War and post-Cold War era. Many scholars have posited that a global thermonuclear war with Cold War-era stockpiles, or even with the current smaller stockpiles, may lead to human extinction. This position was bolstered when nuclear winter was first conceptualized and modelled in 1983. However, models from the past decade consider total extinction very unlikely, and suggest parts of the world would remain habitable. Technically the risk may not be zero, as the climatic effects of nuclear war are uncertain and could theoretically be larger than current models suggest, just as they could theoretically be smaller than current models suggest. There could also be indirect risks, such as a societal collapse following nuclear war that can make humanity much more vulnerable to other existential threats. A related area of inquiry is: if a future nuclear arms race someday leads to larger stockpiles or more dangerous nuclear weapons than existed at the height of the Cold War, at what point could war with such weapons result in human extinction? Physicist Leo Szilard warned in the 1950s that a deliberate \\"doomsday device\\" could be constructed by surrounding powerful hydrogen bombs with a massive amount of cobalt. Cobalt has a half- life of five years, and its global fallout might, some physicists have posited, be able to clear out all human life via lethal radiation intensity. The main motivation for building a cobalt bomb in this scenario is its reduced expense compared with the arsenals possessed by superpowers; such a doomsday device does not need to be launched before detonation and thus does not require expensive missile delivery systems, and the hydrogen bombs do not need to be miniaturized for delivery via missile. The system for triggering it might have to be completely automated, in order for the deterrent to be effective. A modern twist might be to also lace the bombs with aerosols designed to exacerbate nuclear winter. A major caveat is that nuclear fallout transfer between the northern and southern hemispheres is expected to be small; unless a bomb detonates in each hemisphere, the effect of a bomb detonated in one hemisphere on the other is diminished.  Effects of nuclear war  Historically, it has been difficult to estimate the total number of deaths resulting from a global nuclear exchange because scientists are continually discovering new effects of nuclear weapons, and also revising existing models. Early reports considered direct effects from nuclear blast and radiation and indirect effects from economic, social, and political disruption. In a 1979 report for the U.S. Senate, the Office of Technology Assessment estimated casualties under different scenarios. For a full-scale countervalue/counterforce nuclear exchange between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, they predicted U.S. deaths from 35 to 77 percent (70 million to 160 million dead at the time), and Soviet deaths from 20 to 40 percent of the population. Although this report was made when nuclear stockpiles were at much higher levels than they are today, it also was made before the risk of nuclear winter was first theorized in the early 1980s. Additionally, it did not consider other secondary effects, such electromagnetic pulses (EMP), and the ramifications they would have on modern technology and industry. = Nuclear winter = In the early 1980s, scientists began to consider the effects of smoke and soot arising from burning wood, plastics, and petroleum fuels in nuclear-devastated cities. It was speculated that the intense heat would carry these particulates to extremely high altitudes where they could drift for weeks and block out all but a fraction of the sun's light. A landmark 1983 study by the so-called TTAPS team (Richard P. Turco, Owen Toon, Thomas P. Ackerman, James B. Pollack and Carl Sagan) was the first to model these effects and coined the term \\"nuclear winter.\\" More recent studies make use of modern global circulation models and far greater computer power than was available for the 1980s studies. A 2007 study examined consequences of a global nuclear war involving moderate to large portions of the current global arsenal. The study found cooling by about 12‚Äì20 ¬∞C in much of the core farming regions of the US, Europe, Russia and China and as much as 35 ¬∞C in parts of Russia for the first two summer growing seasons. The changes they found were also much longer lasting than previously thought, because their new model better represented entry of soot aerosols in the upper stratosphere, where precipitation does not occur, and therefore clearance was on the order of 10 years. In addition, they found that global cooling caused a weakening of the global hydrological cycle, reducing global precipitation by about 45%. The authors did not discuss the implications for agriculture in depth, but noted that a 1986 study which assumed no food production for a year projected that \\"most of the people on the planet would run out of food and starve to death by then\\" and commented that their own results show that, \\"This period of no food production needs to be extended by many years, making the impacts of nuclear winter even worse than previously thought.\\" In contrast to the above investigations of global nuclear conflicts, studies have shown that even small-scale, regional nuclear conflicts could disrupt the global climate for a decade or more. In a regional nuclear conflict scenario where two opposing nations in the subtropics would each use 50 Hiroshima-sized nuclear weapons (about 15 kiloton each) on major populated centres, the researchers estimated as much as five million tons of soot would be released, which would produce a cooling of several degrees over large areas of North America and Eurasia, including most of the grain-growing regions. The cooling would last for years, and according to the research, could be \\"catastrophic\\". Additionally, the analysis showed a 10% drop in average global precipitation, with the largest losses in the low latitudes due to failure of the monsoons. Regional nuclear conflicts could also inflict significant damage to the ozone layer. A 2008 study found that a regional nuclear weapons exchange could create a near- global ozone hole, triggering human health problems and impacting agriculture for at least a decade.as PDF This effect on the ozone would result from heat absorption by soot in the upper stratosphere, which would modify wind currents and draw in ozone-destroying nitrogen oxides. These high temperatures and nitrogen oxides would reduce ozone to the same dangerous levels we now experience below the ozone hole above Antarctica every spring. = Nuclear famine = It is difficult to estimate the number of casualties that would result from nuclear winter, but it is likely that the primary effect would be global famine (known as Nuclear Famine), wherein mass starvation occurs due to disrupted agricultural production and distribution.Harwell, M., and C. Harwell. (1986). \\"Nuclear Famine: The Indirect Effects of Nuclear War\\", pp. 117‚Äì135 in Solomon, F. and R. Marston (Eds.). The Medical Implications of Nuclear War. Washington, D.C.: National Academy Press. . In a 2013 report, the International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War (IPPNW) concluded that more than two billion people, about a third of the world's population, would be at risk of starvation in the event of a regional nuclear exchange between India and Pakistan, or by the use of even a small proportion of nuclear arms held by America and Russia. Several independent studies show corroborated conclusions that agricultural outputs will be significantly reduced for years by climatic changes driven by nuclear wars. Reduction of food supply will be further exacerbated by rising food prices, affecting hundreds of millions of vulnerable people, especially in the poorest nations of the world. = Electromagnetic pulse = An electromagnetic pulse (EMP) is a burst of electromagnetic radiation. Nuclear explosions create a pulse of electromagnetic radiation called a nuclear EMP or NEMP. Such EMP interference is known to be generally disruptive or damaging to electronic equipment. If a single nuclear weapon \\"designed to emit EMP were detonated 250 to 300 miles up over the middle of the country it would disable the electronics in the entire United States.\\" Given that many of the comforts and necessities we enjoy in the 21st century are predicated on electronics and their functioning, an EMP would disable hospitals, water treatment facilities, food storage facilities, and all electronic forms of communication. An EMP blast threatens the foundation which supports the existence of the modern human condition. Certain EMP attacks could lead to large loss of power for months or years. Currently, failures of the power grid are dealt with using support from the outside. In the event of an EMP attack, such support would not exist and all damaged components, devices, and electronics would need to be completely replaced. In 2013, the US House of Representatives considered the \\"Secure High-voltage Infrastructure for Electricity from Lethal Damage Act\\" that would provide surge protection for some 300 large transformers around the country. The problem of protecting civilian infrastructure from electromagnetic pulse has also been intensively studied throughout the European Union, and in particular by the United Kingdom.House of Commons Defence Committee, \\"Developing Threats: Electro-Magnetic Pulses (EMP)\\". Tenth Report of Session 2010‚Äì12. While precautions have been taken, James Woolsey and the EMP Commission suggested that an EMP is the most significant threat to the U.S. The greatest threat to human survival in the aftermath of an EMP blast would be the inability to access clean drinking water. For comparison, in the aftermath of the 2010 Haitian earthquake, the water infrastructure had been devastated and led to at least 3,333 deaths from cholera in the first few months after the earthquake. Other countries would similarly see the resurgence of previously non-existent diseases as clean water becomes increasingly scarce. The risk of an EMP, either through solar or atmospheric activity or enemy attack, while not dismissed, was suggested to be overblown by the news media in a commentary in Physics Today. Instead, the weapons from rogue states were still too small and uncoordinated to cause a massive EMP, underground infrastructure is sufficiently protected, and there will be enough warning time from continuous solar observatories like SOHO to protect surface transformers should a devastating solar storm be detected. = Nuclear fallout = Nuclear fallout is the residual radioactive dust and ash propelled into the upper atmosphere following a nuclear explosion. Fallout is usually limited to the immediate area, and can only spread for hundreds of miles from the explosion site if the explosion is high enough in the atmosphere. Fallout may get entrained with the products of a pyrocumulus cloud and fall as black rain (rain darkened by soot and other particulates). This radioactive dust, usually consisting of fission products mixed with bystanding atoms that are neutron activated by exposure, is a highly dangerous kind of radioactive contamination. The main radiation hazard from fallout is due to short-lived radionuclides external to the body. While most of the particles carried by nuclear fallout decay rapidly, some radioactive particles will have half-lives of seconds to a few months. Some radioactive isotopes, like strontium 90 and cesium 137, are very long lived and will create radioactive hot spots for up to 5 years after the initial explosion. Fallout and black rain may contaminate waterways, agriculture, and soil. Contact with radioactive materials can lead to radiation poisoning through external exposure or accidental consumption. In acute doses over a short amount of time radiation will lead to prodromal syndrome, bone marrow death, central nervous system death and gastrointestinal death.Coggle, J.E., Lindop, Patricia J. \\"Medical Consequences of Radiation Following a Global Nuclear War.\\" The Aftermath (1983): 60-71. Over longer periods of exposure to radiation, cancer becomes the main health risk. Long term radiation exposure can also lead to in utero effects on human development and transgenerational genetic damage. Origins and analysis of extinction hypotheses As a result of the extensive nuclear fallout of the 1954 Castle Bravo nuclear detonation, author Nevil Shute wrote the popular novel On the Beach which was released in 1957, in this novel so much fallout is generated in a nuclear war that all human life is extinguished. However the premise that all of humanity would die following a nuclear war and only the \\"cockroaches would survive\\" is critically dealt with in the 1988 book Would the Insects Inherit the Earth and Other Subjects of Concern to Those Who Worry About Nuclear War by nuclear weapons expert Philip J. Dolan. In 1982 nuclear disarmament activist Jonathan Schell published The Fate of the Earth, which is regarded by many to be the first carefully argued presentation that concluded that extinction is a significant possibility from nuclear war. However, the assumptions made in this book have been thoroughly analyzed and determined to be \\"quite dubious\\". The impetus for Schell's work, according to physicist Brian Martin, was to argue that \\"if the thought of 500 million people dying in a nuclear war is not enough to stimulate action, then the thought of extinction will. Indeed, Schell explicitly advocates use of the fear of extinction as the basis for inspiring the \\"complete rearrangement of world politics\\". The belief in \\"overkill\\" is also commonly encountered, with an example being the following statement made by nuclear disarmament activist Philip Noel-Baker in 1971 ‚Äì \\"Both the US and the Soviet Union now possess nuclear stockpiles large enough to exterminate mankind three or four ‚Äì some say ten ‚Äì times over\\". Brian Martin suggested that the origin of this belief was from \\"crude linear extrapolations\\", and when analyzed it has no basis in reality. Similarly, it is common to see stated that the combined explosive energy released in the entirety of World War II was about 3 megatons, while a nuclear war with warhead stockpiles at Cold War highs would release 6000 WWII's of explosive energy. An estimate for the necessary amount of fallout to begin to have the potential of causing human extinction is regarded by physicist and disarmament activist Joseph Rotblat to be 10 to 100 times the megatonnage in nuclear arsenals as they stood in 1976; however, with the world megatonnage decreasing since the Cold War ended this possibility remains hypothetical. According to the 1980 United Nations report General and Complete Disarmament: Comprehensive Study on Nuclear Weapons: Report of the Secretary-General, it was estimated that there were a total of about 40,000 nuclear warheads in existence at that time, with a potential combined explosive yield of approximately 13,000 megatons. By comparison, in the Timeline of volcanism on Earth when the volcano Mount Tambora erupted in 1815 ‚Äì turning 1816 into the Year Without A Summer due to the levels of global dimming sulfate aerosols and ash expelled ‚Äì it exploded with a force of roughly 800 to 1,000 megatons, and ejected of mostly rock/tephra, which included 120 million tonnes of sulfur dioxide as an upper estimate. A larger eruption, approximately 74,000 years ago, in Mount Toba produced of tephra, forming lake Toba, and produced an estimated of sulfur dioxide. The explosive energy of the eruption may have been as high as equivalent to 20,000,000 megatons (Mt) of TNT, while the Chicxulub impact, connected with the extinction of the dinosaurs, corresponds to at least 70,000,000 Mt of energy, which is roughly 7000 times the maximum arsenal of the US and Soviet Union. Comparisons with supervolcanos are more misleading than helpful due to the different aerosols released, the likely air burst fuzing height of nuclear weapons and the globally scattered location of these potential nuclear detonations all being in contrast to the singular and subterranean nature of a supervolcanic eruption.Margulis, Lynn (1999). Symbiotic Planet: A New Look At Evolution. Houston: Basic Book. Moreover, assuming the entire world stockpile of weapons were grouped together, it would be difficult due to the nuclear fratricide effect to ensure the individual weapons would detonate all at once. Nonetheless, many people believe that a full-scale nuclear war would result, through the nuclear winter effect, in the extinction of the human species, though not all analysts agree on the assumptions inputted into these nuclear winter models.

(MAES), originally the Mexican American Engineering Society, was founded in 1974. It organizes an annual symposium and career fair.  History  MAES was founded in Los Angeles in 1974 to increase the number of Mexican Americans and other Hispanics in the technical and scientific fields. The idea to establish a professional society for Mexican American engineers originated with Robert Von Hatten, an aerospace electronics engineer with TRW Defense Space Systems in Redondo Beach, California. Mr. Von Hatten had for several years served as volunteer for programs directed at combating the alarming number of high school dropouts. He envisioned a national organization that would serve as a source for role models, address the needs of its members, and become a resource for industry and students. In mid‚Äì1974, Mr. Von Hatten contacted Manuel Castro to join him in the campaign to form the professional organization. During a subsequent series of meetings, a cohort of individuals banded together to lay out the foundation for the ‚ÄúMexican American Engineering Society.‚Äù The founders, listed below, drafted the articles of incorporation and the first bylaws of the society: * Oscar Buttner ‚Äì Rockwell International * Sam Buttner ‚Äì Southern California Edison * Manuel Castro ‚Äì Bechtel Power * Clifford Maldonado ‚Äì Northrop Corporation * Sam Mendoza ‚Äì California State University, Fullerton * Frank Serna ‚Äì Northrop Corporation * Robert Von Hatten ‚Äì TRW Defense Space Systems The society filed incorporation papers as a nonprofit, tax exempt organization with the California Secretary of State in October 1974, and it received its charter on March 28, 1975. The Internal Revenue Service granted the society a federal tax‚Äìexemption letter and employer identification number on January 4, 1979. Ten years later, to reflect its broader technical membership, the organization filed to change its name to the ‚ÄúSociety of Mexican American Engineers and Scientists, Inc.‚Äù This change was granted on July 19, 1989. MAES is one of several membership‚Äìbased organizations that represent Latinos in engineering and science. As a mature organization with over 30 years of experience addressing the concerns of Latinos, MAES is a source of expertise on barriers to and methods for improving educational access and attainment. The society recognizes the importance of encouraging more youth to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics as a means for economic advancement and workforce development. Many of its programs, with the financial help of members, companies, and government agencies are directed at increasing the number of students at all grade levels who will study, prepare, enter, and excel in the technical professions.

It was originally published as a paperback original by Ace Books in 1986 and reprinted several times over the next decade. A British edition appeared in 1991. Orb, an imprint of Tor Books, brought the novel back into print in trade paperback in 2006.ISFDB bibliography It is also notable for being set in Fenario, the human-populated portion of that world. Brokedown Palace opens in a medieval setting where a young man lies with grave wounds beside a river. He is the victim of his brother, the king, who has a very evil temper. There are four brothers in total, and this book is mainly about their relationships and battles. The pace is kept off-kilter by brief chapters interjecting folklore or sidestepping to other seemingly unrelated stories. The story incorporates Hungarian folklore and is filled with metaphors; the castle, for instance, represents a body, as well as being a metaphor for the disintegration of the family and the kingdom. Additionally, the story is inspired by the song \\"Brokedown Palace\\" by the band Grateful Dead. This is acknowledged by the author in the Orb edition, with the first names of the band members being listed on the dedication page, and the acknowledgments page including mention of the person who \\"started the whole thing by playing the song so beautifully; I fell in love with it even before I'd ever heard the boys do it\\".

Prince Andor, second son, is an indulgent man, unable to discover his place. Prince Vilmos, third son, is a giant, such as are occasionally born into the line of Fenarr. The youngest, Prince Miklos, is at the center of the story. The family makes their home in a four-hundred-year-old palace, which is crumbling away under their feet. The story concerns the destruction of their crumbling home, which serves as fulcrum around which many themes revolve. Desperation at things' ending, joy at new beginnings, and the way in which we choose to separate the two, are central themes of the novel. Devera The character of Devera is a nine- year-old girl with brown hair, who frequently inhabits Steven Brust's novels. In Brokedown Palace, she appears twice to Prince Miklos, both times to guide him in what must be done.

Until July 2009 he was a British diplomat, serving as British Consul-General in Los Angeles. He was a key negotiator with China on Hong Kong from the early 1980s through the handover in June 1997. Under the chairmanship of Christopher Patten, Peirce guided the work of the Independent Commission on Policing for Northern Ireland, whose seminal report provided a vital foundation for peace in Northern Ireland. He has also worked closely with the Police Executive Research Forum (PERF) to develop links between the UK and US on all aspects of policing policy. In his capacity as Consul-General in Los Angeles, he facilitated the first-ever visit by a serving British Prime Minister to California and strengthened UK-CA cultural and business relations through the creation of BritWeek. He has served as private secretary to three British Foreign Secretaries: Sir Geoffrey Howe, Sir John Major, and Douglas Hurd. Biodata Peirce (born 18 March 1955) was raised in Somerset, England, where he attended Taunton School., and in South Africa. He was educated at St Catherine's College, Oxford, where he obtained a MA in Modern History, and also studied Chinese at Cambridge University. His parents are Kenneth and Margaret (Edna) Peirce. Foreign Office career After joining the Foreign & Commonwealth Office (FCO) in 1977, Bob worked in a number of key positions. He served in Hong Kong (from 1979‚Äì80, then as Deputy Political Advisor from 1986‚Äì89 and finally as Political Advisor to the Governor from 1993‚Äì97), in Peking (1980‚Äì83), at the FCO in London (1983‚Äì85), and in the Cabinet Office (1985‚Äì86). He was Private Secretary to three Secretaries of State for Foreign & Commonwealth Affairs between 1988-90. He served at the UK Mission to the UN from 1990‚Äì93, where his work focused on Security Council issues, including Namibia, Cambodia, South Africa, Angola, Yugoslavia, Cyprus and many others. In 1990, he was engaged by the UK's Overseas Development Administration (the predecessor to the Department for International Development) to serve as a consultant to the President of Uganda, Yoweri Museveni, on the organisation of the Ugandan State House bureaucracy. Bob was posted to the Royal College of Defense Studies in 1998 until becoming Secretary of the Independent Commission on Policing for Northern Ireland later that year. He left the Commission in 1999 and became Counselor (Press & Public Affairs) at the British Embassy in Washington, D.C. In 2005, he was appointed Consul-General in Los Angeles, with responsibility for a geographical region with a larger population than many countries. Hong Kong Bob was twice a member of the Government of Hong Kong, in the 1980s and again in the 1990s. From 1993-97, he was the Secretary responsible for Hong Kong's external affairs under Governor Christopher Patten. For most of the period from 1979-97, he was directly involved in the negotiations that culminated in the handover of Hong Kong to the People's Republic of China on 30 June 1997, and receives a mention in Patten's book, East and West and other books about that period.  The Patten Commission  Bob was the Secretary (equivalent to chief executive) of the Independent Commission on Policing for Northern Ireland, established 3 June 1998 under Chris Patten. The Commission's report A New Beginning: Policing in Northern Ireland, released in 1999, was drafted by Bob and formed the basis of policing reforms in Northern Ireland following the 1998 peace agreement. It has been hailed by policing experts around the world as a seminal document for policing in a democratic society as well as a template for policing in divided societies. Policing policy When serving as head of political and public affairs at the British Embassy in Washington, DC, Bob worked closely with Chuck Wexler, Executive Director of the Police Executive Research Forum (PERF), to develop links between UK and US police departments, resulting in best practice exchanges on all aspects of related policy, from forensic DNA to public order policing. California Visit by Prime Minister Tony Blair In August 2006, Bob facilitated the visit by Prime Minister Tony Blair to California ‚Äî the first ever visit to the state by a serving British Prime Minister. As part of the visit, Bob instigated the creation of a ground- breaking climate change pact between California and the United Kingdom. The pact was signed by Blair and California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger after their participation in a climate change round table with business leaders in Long Beach. The unprecedented agreement between a country and a US state affirms that the UK and California will work together to evaluate and implement market-based mechanisms that spur innovation, share best practices, deepen their understanding of the economics of climate change, collaborate on technology research, and enhance linkages between their scientific communities. BritWeek Together with Nigel Lythgoe, President of 19 Entertainment and Executive Producer of American Idol, Bob introduced BritWeek to Los Angeles, an annual week of events and celebrations whose collective aim is to strengthen and broaden awareness of the creative, cultural and trade links between Britain and Los Angeles. A promotional film for BritWeek 2008, features Bob, Nigel Lythgoe, Simon Cowell of American Idol, and a number of other prominent Brits commenting on the influence the UK has had on Los Angeles and vice versa, not least in the entertainment arena. Bob continues to chair Brit Week, which is being extended to include San Francisco in 2010. Business career In September 2009, Bob joined a company headed by Los Angeles billionaire Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong, Abraxis BioScience. He advises the company on government and public affairs. Personal life Peirce is married to Sharon Harroun, a native of Virginia who has worked extensively with international humanitarian organisations promoting peace in Northern Ireland, including the Children's Friendship Project for Northern Ireland, Inc. (CFPNI). Sharon and Bob are involved with LA's BEST (Better Educated Students for Tomorrow), an after school education, enrichment, and recreation program for elementary school children in Los Angeles. Together, they have three children from different marriages.

The new prototype was named Ikarus IO (Coastal Reconnaissance) and the first test flight took place from the Danube at Novi Sad in September 1926. After all- round tests, the aircraft was given a positive assessment and the Naval Air Force ordered the first series of 12 aircraft, which were delivered during 1927, serialled 101 to 112. Based on observations arising from the operational use of the aircraft, certain modifications were applied and another 24 modified IOs were ordered, receiving serials 113 to 136.

Operational history The IO was used by the Kingdom of SHS / Yugoslavia Navy as a coastal reconnaissance seaplane and light bomber from 1927 until 1941. The aircraft were deployed and served at Divulje, Vodice and Kumbor. Initially the IO suffered a high accident rate and by 1932 only 29 of the 37 production aircraft were still in service. Because of intensive use the Liberty engines were worn out and difficult to support necessitating substitution with Lorraine-Dietrich engines. In January 1941, 4 aircraft remained in service, of which two were airworthy, which were not used in operations before being withdrawn.

His feast day is September 22, and he is also venerated along with the rest of the 103 Korean martyrs on September 20. He was the son of the martyr Augustine Jeong Yak-Jong and a nephew of noted philosopher John Jeong Yak-Yong, who were among the first converts of Korea, who wrote the first catechism for the Catholic Church in Korea (entitled \\"Jugyo Yoji\\"). When Yakjong was martyred with Hasang's older brother, Yakjong's wife and the remaining children were spared and went into a rural place; Hasang was seven years old. When he grew up, Hasang chose to become a servant of a government interpreter; this enabled him to travel to Beijing multiple times, where he entreated the bishop of Beijing to send priests to Korea, and wrote to Pope Gregory XVI via the bishop of Beijing requesting the establishment of a diocese in Korea. This happened in 1825. Some years later, Bishop Laurent- Marie-Joseph Imbert and two priests were sent. The bishop found Hasang to be talented, zealous, and virtuous; he taught him Latin and theology, and was about to ordain him when a persecution broke out. Hasang was captured and gave the judge a written statement defending Catholicism. The judge, after reading it, said, \\"You are right in what you have written; but the king forbids this religion, it is your duty to renounce it.\\" Hasang replied, \\"I have told you that I am a Christian, and will be one until my death.\\" After this Hasang went through a series of tortures in which his countenance remained tranquil.

EBA firms never take listings and, therefore, never represent the seller in a real estate transaction. Exclusive buyer agent firms have chosen this business model in order to eliminate the conflict of interest that exists when one firm attempts to represent both buyer and seller in the same transaction. An EBA or associated broker does not take or hold listings or represent the seller or landlord in any way, nor do the agents working under or for him/her. This includes advertising \\"for sale by owner\\" properties. In many states, by law, the broker, or agent must have a written agency agreement to represent the buyer exclusively. Without one, the broker or agent may be working for the seller or in a limited capacity. History In 1983, a Federal Trade Commission study revealed that more than 72 percent of home buyers in the United States mistakenly believed that the agent who was showing them homes was representing their interests. As a result, laws requiring agents to disclose whom they actually represent have been passed across the country. As consumers generally became aware that most agents worked for the seller, many began demanding their own representation. Around the same time, these ideas were being advocated by Honolulu attorney, educator and author of many books, John W, Reilly. His 1987 book \\"Agency Relationships in Real Estate\\" was the culmination of several years working with the National Association of Realtors (NAR) and NARELLO the license law arm of the association. In November 1985 California entrepreneur Ridgely Evers' America's First Home Store opened in Chandler, Arizona, as the first Exclusive Buyer Brokerage in the USA. In 1986 the name was changed to Buyer One and the company had its first public offering. The first national franchise to offer Exclusive Buyer Brokerage was The Buyer's Agent Inc., which was formed in July 1988 by Tom Hathaway, a former state highway patrolman and investigator/compliance officer for the Missouri Real Estate Commission. Method of exclusive service Real estate firms in the United States can represent both buyers and sellers in the same transaction, and when representing both, derive profit from both the seller and buyer side of the transaction. While some states have, at the insistence of Realtor trade groups, created various forms of dual agency to allow one company and in some cases an individual agent to represent both sides, other states have continued to hold such practices as illegal. In the opinion of EBAs, it is not possible to faithfully represent the best interests of opposing clients, in the same transaction, simultaneously. The service structure for EBA real estate practitioners is to show buyers all possible listings from other cooperating brokers as well as all other sources, such as for sale by owners. Then, they assist the buyer with evaluation and negotiation and advocate in the buyer's best interests without restriction. In their booklet \\"Shopping for a Home Loan\\" The United States Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD's) settlement cost booklet (page 6) recommends that home buyers consider using an Exclusive Buyer's Agent in their home search. EBA firms amount to less than 1/2 of 1 percent of all real estate firms in the US. The EBA business model of unconflicted buyer representation eliminates the possibility of the buyer being confronted with the conflicts of interest which may be associated with the Dual, Limited or Designated Agency business models.

The rules were published in 1978 by organometallic chemists Stephen G. Davies, Malcolm Green, and Michael Mingos. They describe how and where unsaturated hydrocarbon generally become more susceptibile to nucleophilic attack upon complexation. Rule 1 Nucleophilic attack is preferred on even-numbered polyenes (even hapticity). 400px Rule 2 Nucleophiles preferentially add to acyclic polyenes rather than cyclic polyenes. 350px Rule 3 Nucleophiles preferentially add to even-hapticity polyene ligands at a terminus. Nucleophiles add to odd-hapticity acyclic polyene ligands at a terminal position if the metal is highly electrophilic, otherwise they add at an internal site. Simplified: even before odd and open before closed The following is a diagram showing the reactivity trends of even/odd hapticity and open/closed œÄ-ligands. :none The metal center is electron withdrawing. This effect is enhanced if the metal is also attached to a carbonyl. Electron poor metals do not back bond well to the carbonyl. The more electron withdrawing the metal is, the more triple bond character the CO ligand has. This gives the ligand a higher force constant. The resultant force constant found for a ligated carbonyl represents the same force constant for œÄ ligands if they replaced the CO ligand in the same complex. Nucleophilic addition does not occur if kCO* (the effective force constant for the CO ligand) is below a threshold value The following figure shows a ligated metal attached to a carbonyl group. This group has a partial positive charge and therefore is susceptible to nucleophilic attack. If the ligand represented by Ln were a œÄ-ligand, it would be activated toward nucleophilic attack as well. :\\\\ce{L_\\\\mathit{n}-{}}\\\\overset{\\\\color{Red}\\\\delta+}\\\\ce{M}\\\\ce{-C#}\\\\overset{\\\\color{Red}\\\\delta+}\\\\ce{O} Incoming nucleophilic attack happens at one of the termini of the œÄ-system in the figure below: :none In this example the ring system can be thought of as analogous to 1,3-butadiene. Following the Green‚ÄìDavies‚ÄìMingos rules, since butadiene is an open œÄ-ligand of even hapticity, nucleophilic attack will occur at one of the terminal positions of the œÄ-system. This occurs because the LUMO of butadiene has larger lobes on the ends rather than the internal positions.  Examples of complexes  The following is an example of a complex containing three types of œÄ-ligands, demonstrating the preferential attack of a nucleophile at one of the œÄ-systems. center The above complex contains three types of œÄ-ligands. The cyclooctane ring contains a butadiene fragment on the left and an allyl fragment on the right. A cyclopentadiene ligand on the cobalt center gives the third type. Attack of the cyanide nucleophile occurs preferentially at a terminus of the butadiene fragment. (The drawing above shows the incorrect product) Following the rules given above, the butadiene fragment is an open ligand of even hapticity, which has greater reactivity than the allyl fragment, an open ligand of odd hapticity, or the cyclopentadiene, a closed ligand of odd hapticity. Attack occurs at the terminus which will result in the conjugated product shown.  Internal attack  Here the ligand that is already attached to the metal acts as the nucleophile and attacks the metal center internally. center  Effects of types of ligands on regiochemistry of attack  Nucleophilic attack at terminal position of allyl ligands when œÄ accepting ligand is present. center If sigma donating ligands are present they pump electrons into the ligand and attack occurs at the internal position. center  Effects of asymmetrical ligands  When asymmetrical allyl ligands are present attack occurs at the more substituted position. center In this case the attack will occur on the carbon with both R groups attached to it since that is the more substituted position.  Effects of large œÄ ligands  When large œÄ ligands are present they can undergo different kinds of nucleophilic attacks. In the following figure the nucleophilic attack can occur from either the top or bottom and reduce the double bond and add the nucleophile. center This nucleophilic attack can occur at either the top or bottom also and add the nucleophile. center  Uses in synthesis  Nucleophilic addition to œÄ ligands can be used in synthesis. One example of this is to make cyclic metal compounds. Nucleophiles add to the center of the œÄ ligand and produces a metallobutane. centercenter  References  Category:Reaction mechanisms ","title":"Green‚ÄìDavies‚ÄìMingos rules"},{"id":"17347461","text":"Hgnettada is a villageold name : fazara in Shwegu Township in Bhamo District in the Kachin State of north-eastern Burma.Maplandia world gazetteer References External links *Satellite map at Maplandia.com Category:Populated places in Kachin State Category:Shwegu Township ","title":"Hgnettada"},{"id":"17347465","text":"Jeo-dong is a legal dong, or neighbourhood of the Jung-gu district in Seoul, South Korea and governed by its administrative dong, Myeong-dong and Euljiro 3, 4, 5ga-dong.

Currently, the company has 1490 stores in all 26 Brazilian states and in the Federal District. Lojas Americanas in Recife. Lojas Americanas in Ipatinga. Lojas Americanas (Portuguese for American Stores) has its headquarters in Rio de Janeiro and has 4 distribution centers, in Nova Igua√ßu (Rio de Janeiro), Barueri (S√£o Paulo), Recife (Pernambuco) and Uberlandia (Minas Gerais). It is controlled by three Brazilian billionaires: Jorge Paulo Lemann, Marcel Herrmann Telles and Carlos Alberto Sicupira, the same trio that drives the Anheuser-Busch InBev, 3G Capital, S√£o Carlos S.A. and other groups. The network sells over 80 thousand items of four thousand different companies. In January 2007, Lojas Americanas acquired the Brazilian operations of the network of video rental Blockbuster for million and adapted to store the model Americanas Express.  History  The company was founded in 1929 by Americans John Lee, Glen Matson, James Marshall and Batson Borger. They left the United States and went to Buenos Aires with the objective of opening a Five and Dime store. The idea was to launch a store that featured low prices, modelled after stores in the United States and Europe that became popular at the beginning of the 20th century. While on their trip to South America, they met Brazilians Aquino Sales and Max Landesman, who convinced them to change their plans and head to Rio de Janeiro. After spending time in Rio de Janeiro, the Americans saw that there were many public employees and military personnel with stable but modest salaries. The majority of the stores in the city were not financially accessible to the general public. The existing stores were expensive and sold specialized merchandise. Consumers had to go to several different establishments to do their shopping. As a result, the Americans decided that Rio de Janeiro was the perfect city in which to launch their new concept store. They built a store that had low prices‚Äîto attend to the \\"forgotten\\" consumer populations‚Äîand sold the widest variety of products possible. In 1929 they inaugurated the first Lojas Americanas store in Niteroi. The store slogan was \\"Nothing over $2\\". During the first hour the store was open, no one came. Failure appeared imminent. However, one girl, after spending a few minutes looking at the window display, entered and bought a doll. And just like that, Lojas Americanas had completed its first of many sales. At the end of the first year, they had already opened four stores‚Äîthree in Rio de Janeiro and one in S√£o Paulo. By 1940, Lojas Americanas had become a corporation. In 1982, the board members of the Grupo Garantia came on board with Lojas Americanas as shareholders. By the first quarter of 1994, they solidified the formation of a joint venture company under the name Walmart Brasil S/A with Lojas Americanas as a 40% stakeholder and Walmart as a 60% stakeholder. In 1997, by the decision of the administrative council of the company, approval was given for sale of 40% of the company to Walmart, Inc. The council approved the participation of Lojas Americanas in a deal in 1998 which detailed their actionary control of 23 stores with the French supermarket company Comptoirs Modernes, connected to Grupo Carrefour). Lojas Americanas later decided to end the association and focus on their primary business of discount stores. Store in Tangar√° da Serra, Mato Grosso, inaugurated in November 2011. In 1999, the company began selling merchandise over the internet, through the site Americanas.com. By 2000, Americanas.com and a new partnership with Chase Capital, The Flatiron Fund, Next International. Global Bridge Ventures, Mercosul Internet S/A, and AIG had significantly augmented their capital. All together, these ventures translated into an additional US $40 million and the sale of 33% of the company. The early 2000s were characterized by the company's rapid expansion. The goal was to open new stores across the Southeast and South of Brazil to increase the presence of the brand and to reformulate some existing stores to improve customer service. It was also during this period that Lojas Americanas acquired a television station called Shoptime, a joint venture with Banco Ita√∫ that created the Financeira Americanas Ita√∫ (FAI), or Americanas Tai√≠. Americanas.com announced in November 2006 its merger with Submarino, creating an absolute leading company in the online sales segment in Brazil.

The school currently educates more than 700 students with nearly 70 full- and part-time faculty members. It is also home to 10 academic research centers and institutes.

The Josef Korbel School is a full member of the Association of Professional Schools of International Affairs (APSIA). History The Si√© Ch√©ou-Kang Center for International Security and Diplomacy, part of the Josef Korbel School The Department of International Relations at the University of Denver was first directed by Dr. Ben Mark Cherrington, an educator and policy maker who was associated with some of his era's preeminent political thinkers, including Gandhi, Louis Brandeis and Ramsay MacDonald. According to the University of Denver, \\"In 1938, Cherrington was handpicked by the United States Department of State to lead its new Division of Cultural Relations and tasked with carrying out 'the exchange of professors, teachers, and students...cooperation in the field of music, art, literature...international radio broadcasts...generally, the dissemination abroad of the representative intellectual and cultural work of the U.S.'\\" Cherrington later became chancellor of the University of Denver from 1943 to 1946, and he was also a contributing author to the United Nations Charter. The Graduate School of International Studies (GSIS) was established under the efforts of Josef Korbel, who became its first dean, in 1964. Decades earlier, he had been forced to flee during the Communist coup in Czechoslovakia in 1948. Korbel was granted political asylum in the United States and was hired in 1949 to teach international politics at the University of Denver. To house the school, the Ben M. Cherrington Hall was built in 1965. Nearly 25 years after Korbel's death, the University of Denver established the Josef Korbel Humanitarian Award in 2000. In 2008, the Graduate School of International Studies was renamed the Josef Korbel School of International Studies, in his honor and in recognition of his family's support. Other deans who followed Korbel include Tom Farer, a lawyer, scholar and diplomat who served in the U.S. State Department, the U.S. Defense Department and as president of the University of New Mexico. Former U.S Ambassador Christopher R. Hill took over as dean in 2010. Hill has experience as a Peace Corps volunteer in Cameroon, and has served as ambassador to Macedonia, Poland, South Korea and Iraq. He was a member of the team that negotiated the Bosnia peace settlement and has worked on negotiations with North Korea.

History Flat Baroque and Berserk was the first of Harper's recordings to enter the charts, reaching number 20 in the UK album chart in January 1970. Produced by Peter Jenner and recorded at Abbey Road Studios, Flat Baroque... was the first of eight albums recorded for EMI's Harvest label. Harper has said of the album, \\"for the first time in my recording career, proper care and attention was paid to the presentation of the song.\\" The album contains some of Harper's best-known songs. \\"I Hate the White Man\\", in particular, is noted for its uncompromising lyrics, and Allmusic described the song as Harper described the song as The album also features \\"Another Day\\", a song of regret for lost love. The lyrics are written from the point of view of a man looking back with regret upon a missed chance that might have led him to a love he has searched for. The song was covered as a duet by Kate Bush and Peter Gabriel in her 1979 television special, and later by This Mortal Coil on their 1984 album It'll End in Tears. The cover by Bush led to collaboration with Harper in 1980; he singing backing vocals on her song \\"Breathing\\" and she duetting on the track \\"You\\" on Harper's album The Unknown Soldier. The album closes with one of Harper's most rock-based tracks, \\"Hell's Angels\\", on which backing is provided by progressive rock band The Nice and features the unusual combination of acoustic guitar played through a wah-wah pedal. Two of the album's tracks \\"I Hate the White Man\\" (\\"Den hvite mann\\") and \\"Don't You Grieve\\" (\\"Kj√¶re ikke gr√•t\\") were later covered by Norwegian singer Finn Kalvik whom Harper had met and performed with in Oslo in 1970. Tracks on compilation albums One of the album tracks, \\"Song of the Ages\\" appeared on the 1970 Harvest Records sampler album, Picnic ‚Äì A Breath of Fresh Air. However, the inclusion of the previously unreleased Pink Floyd song, \\"Embryo\\", considered unfinished by the band and used without their permission, saw the album's withdrawal from sale. A similarly entitled retrospective compilation album, A Breath of Fresh Air ‚Äì A Harvest Records Anthology 1969‚Äì1974, was released in 2007. This three-disc compilation contained only three tracks in common with its precursor. Harper's \\"Song of the Ages\\" was dropped in favour of \\"Francesca\\" and \\"Don't You Grieve\\", and two other Harper tracks were also included; \\"South Africa\\" from his 1973 release Lifemask and \\"Twelve Hours Of Sunset\\" from his following 1974 album Valentine.

Its populations have declined drastically, mainly due to overfishing, and it is now considered Critically Endangered. Etymology The specific name sanitwongsei was chosen to honor M. R. Suwaphan Sanitwong () for his support of fisheries in Thailand.  Geographic range  The Pangasius sanitwongsei is native to basins in Southeast Asia, and has been found in Central Anatolia, which is not native and was implemented there illegally. The P. sanitwongsei was also recently found in South Africa, and is suspected to be brought and released there illegally.  Habitat  The Pangasius sanitwongsei is tolerant in poor quality water and prefers to live in the bottom of deep depressions in freshwater rivers. The fish live in rivers but are experiencing endangerment due to dams being built, causing the fish to be trapped and unable to migrate.  Physical characteristics  Giant pangasius in Prague Sea aquarium Giant pangasius at Disney's Animal Kingdom The giant pangasius is pigmented with dusky melanophores. It has a wide, flat, whiskerless head. Its body is compressed and elongate, with a depressed head. It has a continuous and uninterrupted single vomero-palatine teeth patch which is curved. The anal fin has 26 rays and the pectoral spine is similar in size to the dorsal spine and also shows serrations. It has a silver, curved underside and a dark brown back. Its dorsal, pectoral and pelvic fins are dark gray and the first soft ray is extended into a filament. Its dorsal, adipose, pectoral, and caudal fins are a dark grey to black coloring, with its anal fin and pelvic fins a white to grey coloring. Full-grown adults can reach SL in length and weigh up to . More commonly the fish's length is around 2 meters.  Development  This species reproduces sexually, and the eggs and sperm are usually released in a muddier area to prevent eggs from sticking to each other. The number of eggs per each spawning is around 600 (with a diameter of 2-2.5mm) and the brood shows low genetic variation. There is no parental care after spawning.  Behavior  The giant pangasius is a benthopelagic and migratory species. Juveniles and adults feed on crustaceans and fishes. These fish typically spawn just prior to the monsoon season. It is believed that the P. sanitwongsei prey on shrimp, crabs, and fish and hideout in deep areas in rivers. The P. sanitwongsei have a seasonal migration but the fish does not leave the river during its migration, it only stays within the river during the seasonal migration.  Food habits  The P. sanitwongsei is a carnivorous fish, whose prey consist of shrimp, crabs, and fish. Since the fish lives on the bottom, it is also known to feed on larger animal's carcasses.  Predation  There are no known natural predators of the P. sanitwongsei, besides humans due to overfishing which is leading to a decline in population.  Reproduction  Little is known of the reproduction of P. sanitwongsei, but the time of spawning happens in the months of April and May. It is predicted that spawining happens in the rivers that they are found and are not believed to be migrating from outside the river when getting ready to spawn.  Longevity  This fish's lifespan isn't known, but it is known that it grows fast and usually the trend is when it grows fast, it dies quickly. The possible reasoning for this could be the fact that there is over-fishing of the species.  Ecosystem roles  The P. sanitwongsei's role in the ecosystem is the top predator, or also known as the \\"umbrella\\" species for the other species that live in the habitat. Due to overharvesting, the native fish population may increase since the P. sanitwongsei population is declining.  Economic importance  This fish is important to humans due to the lack of knowledge we have about it, and this fish can show us migratory pathways and spawning habits. This fish also has an important role in fisheries since they are fast growing and can live in poor water environments, plus they bring in good prices for a filet of this fish.  Relationship to humans  Fishing of this species used to be accompanied by religious ceremonies and rites. It is often mentioned in textbooks, news media, and popular press. This fish is a popular food fish and marketed fresh. These fish sometimes appear in the aquarium fish hobby. Most specimens do not reach their full size without an extremely large aquarium or pond. There is even a \\"balloon\\" form of this fish where the fish has an unusually short and stocky body.‚ÄúShort body‚Äù ‡∏≠‡∏µ‡∏Å‡∏´‡∏ô‡∏∂‡πà‡∏á‡∏™‡∏µ‡∏™‡∏±‡∏ô‡∏Ç‡∏≠‡∏á‡∏õ‡∏•‡∏≤‡∏ô‡πâ‡∏≥‡∏à‡∏∑‡∏î‡πÑ‡∏ó‡∏¢  Conservation status  This fish is highly protected and has a high conservation value and is banned from being fished through all seasons. The fish is being threatened by overharvesting, damming rivers, and pollution. A known breeding practice, to try and help the population, is being practiced by the Thai's government, and recommendations about the conservation of this fish is to halt harvesting until the P. sanitwongsei's population can rise to a safe level.

The first generation unit in Porce III will start producing electrical energy at the end of 2010, and around the same time construction of the first civil works for Porce IV will begin. Operations will start in 2015. In Panama, through its affiliate Hidrol√≥gica del Teribe (HET), the Bonyic hydroelectric power station is being built. This power station will be able to generate up to 31.3 MW and will contribute to decrease that country's dependence on imported oil and other fossil fuels that are highly contaminating of the environment. In Colombia, EPM is also part of the corporation that is working to develop the Hidroituango project, which will have the largest capacity in the country with a total of 2400 MW. All these projects that consolidate EPM's important role in the Colombian electrical landscape also indicate the path taken in their research on alternative energy sources.

It is a community service and work-based training program.US Department of Labor, ETA, \\"About SCSEP\\" It does this through job skill training and employment assistance with an emphasis on getting a ready job with a suitable and cooperating company or organisation. In such a setting, the worker is paid the United States minimum wage, or the highest of Federal, State or local minimum wage, or the prevailing wage, for an average of 20 hours per week, and experiences on-the-job learning and newly acquired skills use. The intention is that through these community jobs, the older worker will gain a permanent job, not subsidized by federal government funds. People who are 55 or older can obtain job training and job search services from SCSEP. In each area of the country, SCSEP services are accessed through local organizations. These are usually nonprofits, but sometimes a state agency will administer the program.  Eligibility guidelines  The participant must be at least 55 years of age and from a family receiving regular cash welfare payments or with an annual family income of no more than 25% over the Federal poverty level as defined by the United States Census Bureau. There are certain exclusions in the income calculation, such as Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI).US Department of Labor, ETA, \\"Training and Employment Guidance Letter No. 12-06, December 28, 2006.

Controversy  Experience Works, Inc., was historically the largest provider of SCSEP services. In 2015, the grantee was cited for $1.6 million dollars in questioned costs by the Department of Labor. The report details the use of unrestricted and accrued annual leave to cover a $1.6 million grant overspend, which $1.4 million was used to pay participant wages and fringe benefits, the misuse of federal funds to cover activities including first-class travel, pet hotels, fruit bouquets, personal loans to the CEO, and frequent credit card use on entertainment and prohibited lobbying.

It was shown during the Sunday tea time slot on BBC One, which for several years showed fairly faithful adaptations of classic novels aimed at a family audience. In 1972 it was shown in America as part of the Masterpiece Theatre series. The serial consisted of eight 45-minute episodes. Near the start, Chingachook introduces his son Uncas, saying \\"Uncas is the last of the Mohicans\\". After Uncas is killed, the final line in the serial is Chingachook saying in a sad voice, \\"I am the last of the Mohicans\\". The serial was responsible for popularising the term \\"Mohican hairstyle\\" for what is known as a Mohawk hairstyle in the US, although it was actually worn by the Hurons not the Mohicans in the serial. This production was released on DVD, distributed by Acorn Media UK. In 1973 the BBC made a sequel Hawkeye, the Pathfinder, also with Abineri as Chingachook but with Paul Massie as Hawkeye.

Compared with some other adaptations of the novel it was made on a relatively low budget (much of it was shot in the studio, although there were scenes shot on location in Scotland) and it included some dated elements (the American Indians were all played by white actors in make up). However it was praised for the quality of the acting, particularly the performance as Magua by Philip Madoc, an experienced Welsh TV actor who often played villains, and Richard Warwick as Uncas.

He was the leader of the so-called Old Slovene political movement. Already during his lifetime, he was called father of the nation.http://www.kam.si/129_svarun/1132_janez-bleiweis---oa-e-naroda.html Bleiweis was born in a wealthy merchant family in the Carniolan city of Kranj, then part of the Austrian Empire. Since childhood, he was raised in a bilingual environment. He was fluent in both Slovene and German, as most of the members of the upper middle class in Carniola at the time. He attended the lyceum in Ljubljana before enrolling at the University of Vienna, where he studied medicine. After completing his studies, he worked as a professor of veterinary medicine and pathology in Ljubljana. Bleiweis wrote a number of text from the fields of the veterinary medicine and human health, particularly about infectious diseases. In 1843, Bleiweis founded the journal Kmetijske in rokodelske novice (Farmers' and Craftsmen's News) and edited it until his death in 1881. It dealt with economic, as well as with cultural issues in the Slovene Lands. In the spring of nations of 1848, he became involved in politics and supported the quest of United Slovenia. At the beginning of the constitutional period in the Austrian Empire, Bleiweis emerged as the leader of the Slovene national movement. Already in the late 1850s, however, his politically conservatitive leadership was challenged by the younger generation of Slovene nationalists, known as the Young Slovenes, among whom were Fran Levstik, Josip Stritar, and Josip Jurƒçiƒç. Bleiweis' group, which included Lovro Toman, Etbin Henrik Costa, Luka Svetec and Andrej Einspieler was identified as the Old Slovenes thereafter, although they themselves never accepted such a name. Bleiweis was a Habsburg legitimist and follower of the Austroslavist ideology. In politics, he followed the example of the Czech leader Franti≈°ek Palack√Ω, who demanded autonomy for the Slavic peoples within a unified Austrian Empire. In 1881, Bleiweis was granted knighthood by Franz Joseph I of Austria, the Emperor of Austria. The same year, he died in Ljubljana and was buried in the St. Christopher Cemetery in the Be≈æigrad district of Ljubljana.

The earthquake was the strongest to hit the foothills of the Himalayas in more than ninety years.World: South Asia Quake death toll nears 100 BBC News Approximately 103 people died in the earthquake. Cause The Himalaya Range has been undergoing crustal shortening along the 2,400 km long northern edge of the Indian Plate which resulted in the formation of several thrust faults including the Main Central Thrust (MCT), the Main Boundary Thrust (MBT) and the Main Frontal Thrust (MFT). The MCT consists of three sub-thrusts: MCT I, MCT II and MCT III. Many earthquakes have occurred along these thrust faults. It is thought that the Chamoli earthquake in 1999 was associated with these fault systems.Chamoli (Himalaya, India) Earthquake of 29 March 1999 National Information Center of Earthquake Engineering Description The magnitude of the earthquake was 6.8 on the Richter scale.World: South Asia Earthquake hits India BBC News Apart from the Chamoli district, the quake also affected five other districts of Uttar Pradesh viz. Rudraprayag, Tehri Garhwal, Bageshwar, Uttarkashi and Pauri Garhwal (all are in Uttarakhand now). Among these, Chamoli and Rudraprayag were the most affected districts. Aftershocks continued and most of the aftershocks occurred in the east of Chamoli. Officials from Pakistan reported that the quake was also felt in Lahore and Gujranwala. The earthquake was also felt in the Nanda Devi mountain region, in Kanpur, Shimla, Delhi, Dehradun, Sirmour , Haridwar, Saharanpur, Moradabad, Bijnor, Muzaffarnagar, Meerut, Ghaziabad and Srinagar and in the Baitadi District, Dadeldhura District, Darchula District and Kanchanpur District in Mahakali Zone in Nepal. Damage and casualties Severe ground deformations resulted from the earthquake. Formation of ground fissures were reported from many areas. Landslides and changes in the groundwater flow were also reported. Well-developed ground cracks were seen in Gopeshwar, Chamoli and Bairagna. Cracks were observed in asphalt roads at several locations. Landslips cut off parts of Mandakini valley and Mandal valley and many major roads. The death toll was 103. Several hundred people injured and approximately 50,000 houses were damaged.Estimation of source parameters of Chamoli Earthquake, India Indian Academy of Sciences Over 2,000 villages were affected by the earthquake. Electricity, water supply and communication were also severely affected by the earthquake especially in the Chamoli town, Gopeshwar and Okhimath region of Rudraprayag district. According to Mike Wooldridge, correspondent for the BBC News, Chamoli suffered most damage and almost all the houses and shops built on slopes in the lower part of the town were destroyed. The bridge deck of a pedestrian suspension bridge situated near Bairagna developed lateral buckling and the cables of the bridge were loosened. Water pipelines in Chamoli and Gopeshwar towns were damaged affecting water supply due to landslides caused by the quake. The concrete- lined canals of the irrigation network in the affected region sustained some cracks. In Delhi, many buildings sustained non-structural damage.Who's afraid of earthquakes really? The Hindu According to Dr B.L. Wadhera, who filed a public interest litigation in the Delhi High Court, cracks developed in the Shastri Bhavan in Delhi which houses several Union Ministries.'Delhi ill- equipped to handle quakes' The Hindu Damage occurred in several buildings in Dehradun also. A few old buildings of the Survey of India sustained collapse of gable masonry, and cracks developed along the junctions between the pitched roof and the masonry walls. Relief efforts Rescue operations were hampered by landslides, loss of electrical power and the loss of communication links with Chamoli. Many road workers became involved to clear landslide debris from a 16 km stretch of road leading to the worst-affected area. Local people carried out search and rescue operations. Rescue efforts were led by the Indian Army and Paramilitary personnel were also called-in to aid. The army used helicopters to ferry in supplies. Food and other necessary supplies were air-dropped to villages which lacked motorable roads and where roads were damaged due to landslides. Locals organized a committee to make sure that those most affected receive food.

Galloway played for Berwick Rangers, Mansfield Town, Halifax Town, Heart of Midlothian, Celtic and Leicester City as a midfielder. Born in Oswestry, England, Galloway represented Scotland once in an international match. Playing career Galloway was a player with an aggressive attitude to the game but with a skilful left foot. A hard-tackling and aggressive ball winner, the red-haired Galloway started his career with Berwick Rangers. After spells at Mansfield Town and Halifax Town, he moved to Heart of Midlothian (Hearts) in the autumn of 1987. Galloway's combative performances for Hearts were a key reason why the Edinburgh side were able to push Celtic all the way during the 1987/88 season. Celtic manager Billy McNeill signed Galloway in 1989. He made his competitive debut in a 3-1 win at old club Hearts on 12 August. He would be a regular feature in that first year with the club. Despite a weight problem and some inconsistent performances which saw him in and out of the team, he earned a Scotland cap in October 1991. On his game he was an excellent midfield enforcer but at other times his slackness could be costly and as managers came and went at Parkhead a lack of discipline off the field saw Galloway lambasted by boss Lou Macari over missed training sessions. From that time on he was seldom more than a bit-part player at Celtic Park and he eventually departed in 1995 for Leicester City. Serious injuries sustained in a car crash would end his football career. Coaching career On 27 April 2011 he was appointed manager at East Of Scotland League Club Coldstream FC for season 2011/12. On 15 June 2011 he was appointed manager at Northern Alliance League Club Berwick United for season 2011/12. On 22 September 2013 he was appointed manager of East of Scotland League side Eyemouth United.

The people on this list have either declared themselves as or confirmed themselves to be atheist; and/or have been identified as atheists by a reliable source; and/or whose most recently recorded attitude toward the existence of God or gods is of disbelief. While definitions of atheism vary, a typical atheist is someone who has made a conscious decision that he or she does not believe in the existence of any form of deity. It is a widespread misconception, however, that all atheists deny the existence of a god or gods. While a miniority of them certainly do, most atheists would strongly disagree with this definition: they don't entirely reject the concept \\"God\\", but would rather argue that the term God has no importance, and possibly no meaning to them. The distinction is made between lack of belief in god(s) or weak atheism and denial of the existence of god(s) or strong atheism. Weak atheism should not be confused with agnosticism. An agnostic is in this case an individual who claims to have no opinion about God. The Netherlands is a secular Western European country that has witnessed a strong decline in its religious establishment. Membership and religious attendance have dropped dramatically since the late fifties. Worst hit are the mainstream Protestant churches, whose membership declined from 23 per cent in the late fifties to six per cent in 2007. According to government estimations this percentage could drop as low as two per cent by 2020. The Catholic church will likely face another decade of decline before levelling off around 2020. The Roman Catholic population dropped from 42 per cent in 1958 to 17 in 2007 and now facing a fall to as low as 10 per cent. In spite of these figures, the Dutch Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) finds the number of self-described Christians has stopped declining since the nineties. As of 2005, a small majority of the Dutch population (52 per cent), still called itself Christian. These figures are disputed by another government research body, the Social and Cultural Planning Office (SCP), which has maintained a 40 per cent figure since the early nineties. While 48.4 percent are irreligious, the actual percentage of atheists in the Netherlands may be 14, 39, 42 or 44, making it the 14th-most atheistic country in the world.

Career Goodwin first entered the senior picture with Leicester City during their heavy pre-season schedule of 1999, earning a Premiership appearance in the injury-hit side that lost at home to West Ham United as Leicester tried to patch up its wounded for the impending League Cup semi-finals and still found itself applauded from the pitch. Goodwin didn't make another appearance for the Foxes and less than a year later found himself attempting to impress in reserve football at Northampton Town, Barnet, Peterborough United and Kidderminster Harriers, prior to his release by Leicester. On settling at Shepshed Dynamo, Goodwin also briefly assumed the Commercial Manager's role there and faced Leicester in the 2003 County Challenge Cup Final.

Biography Shortly after John M. Goggin's birth, his family moved to Miami, Florida, where Goggin's father, a dentist, had set up practice. Goggin would spend his early years here. Roaming in the Everglades, Goggin formed a thriving interest in the cultural history and ethnology of the region. Throughout high school, Goggin began collecting archaeological artifacts and exploring sites that he personally found, further establishing his love for the field of anthropological archaeology. Goggin began his undergraduate work at the University of Florida in Gainesville, but did not complete his B.A at the university. It was here that he composed his first paper, ‚ÄúA Ceramic Sequence in South Florida‚Äù, which explores the chronology of different pottery types of the Florida Natives. Soon he transferred to the University of New Mexico, where he received his B.A. in Anthropology in 1938. Goggin remained in New Mexico for the next few years, continuing field work on the Pueblo Indians while maintaining part-time graduate studies at the University of New Mexico. From 1941-42, he held the position of curator for the Coronado State Monument which supplied Goggin with further experience in his inherent appreciation for artifacts. With the United States' involvement in World War II, Goggin took on the work as an engineer at Florida airports that were under construction. Physical disabilities left Goggin inadequate for overseas military efforts, but did not prevent his aid at the home front. After the war, Yale Peabody Museum offered Goggin an assistantship in favor of his excavations of F.H. Sommer III at upper Matecumbe Key. This made graduate work at Yale in anthropology possible for Goggin. Later, he received his M.A. from Yale in 1946 and then a Ph.D. in 1948 under the instruction of lifetime colleague, Irving Rouse. Upon his receiving his Ph.D. from Yale in 1948, Goggin returned to the University of Florida as Associate Professor of Anthropology in the joint department of Sociology and Anthropology; this was the first appointment by a university to Anthropology in the entire state of Florida. Goggin's enthusiasm and love for anthropology spread to his students as enrollment in his classes continued to increase year after year. Goggin took every opportunity he could to work directly with his students, either in the field or in the archaeology laboratories that Goggin personally developed with the help of his peers. Goggin persisted in educating his students on the importance of ecology, ethnology, and history within archaeology. His teaching and love for anthropology inspired his students and enthusiasts to create an explosion in amateur archaeology in and around Florida throughout his lifetime. Goggin, with the help of peers in Florida, founded the Florida Anthropological Society, where he held the position of editor of the group's journal from 1949-51. He also served as editor of American Antiquity, from 1950-54. In 1951, Goggin was made the first foreign member of Junta Nacional de Arqueolog√≠a y Etnolog√≠a in Cuba. While acquiring all these credentials, he was an active member in the Florida Academy of Sciences, the Florida Historical Society, the Society for American Archaeology, and the Southeastern Archaeology Conference. In 1961, he was promoted to full Professor and Acting Head of the new Anthropology Department. Then in 1963, he was made Research Professor of Anthropology when his terminal cancer hindered his ability to work as instructor. He maintained a permanent address and a base of operation in Florida from 1948 to his death in 1963. Ideology Goggin's main study interest was the interaction between colonists and the natives. Therefore, most of his fieldwork was done in old colonial areas throughout Florida and the Caribbean, with the exception of the work done while in attendance at the University of New Mexico. Between 1936 and 1960 he spent a total of three and a half years doing field work in Mexico; he paid 30 visits to the Caribbean, while maintaining constant work in Florida. The main themes and ideology behind Goggin's work laid in his appreciation for the collection and examination of artifacts. Goggin attempted to set all the artifacts from a certain site into a chronology paying particular attention to typology, functions, construction, and where, in accordance to stratification, the objects lay. Beyond these specifications to research, Goggin used all the aspects of anthropology, archaeology, ethnology, history, and natural history, as a lens in which he would establish a chronology of artifacts. He expressed his distrust in sampling early on. As a collector of artifacts he found sampling very dangerous to the preservation of tangible history. While working and schooling in New Mexico, Goggin developed his own method of ‚Äúcontrolled sample collecting.‚Äù In this method he marked off 16 parts of the surface ground at Goodland Point midden. He collected and seriated the samples separately in order to establish a chronology of five distinct periods, and used the process to determine a theory of midden building for South Florida. While at Yale, Goggin continued to study the cultural history of Florida. For his dissertation, he created a chronology of Florida's history based on locations and periods with evidence of solid wood given way to ‚Äúcultural patterns.‚Äù He presented his argument and evidence from a standpoint of ethnohistory, ethnology, and archaeology. The section of the dissertation specifically dealing with the Lower St. Johns area was later edited and published as the monograph Space and Time Perspective in Northern St. Johns Archaeology, Florida. Goggin's theories on chronology of specimens and his revolutionary approach to archeology paved the way for modern archaeologists such as the late William C. Sturtevant (1926‚Äì2007). Though he died well before he became a nationally renowned anthropologist, his ideology became fundamental in modern anthropology. Goggin refused to be called an archaeologist in favor of his all-encompassing view on the subject. More specifically, he mapped out the first cultural and natural history of Florida. Goggin incorporated archaeology, anthropology, ethnography, history, and natural history to assign a chronological history to a cultural group based on trends and ‚Äúcultural patterns.‚Äù Major publications * Space and Time Perspective in Northern St. Johns Archeology, Florida.

With his wife, Gladys Laubin, he performed theatrical interpretations of Plains Indian dances. A white man, Laubin believed in Indian culture as an antidote to life in the modern world. Through his performances, he sought to preserve what he saw as Indian ways. Biography =Early life and marriage= Laubin grew up in Lima, Ohio. His parents, Karl and Carrie Laubin, were musicians, and they encouraged Reginald to pursue a career in music. Young Laubin had other ideas. He read Ernest Thompson Seton's Two Little Savages: Being the Adventures of Two Boys Who Lived as Indians Do, and What They Learned, and it influenced him to learn everything he could about Indians. At the age of eleven, Laubin watched a performance by Indian dancers. Afterward, he introduced himself to the dancers, and they taught him some steps. He decided that he too would become an Indian dancer. When Laubin was sixteen years old, his parents died of influenza. Laubin moved to Hartford, Connecticut, to live with his uncle. In 1922, he enrolled in Norwich Art School. There, he met Gladys Tortachel, who was attending the nearby Norwich Free Academy. The two began a partnership based on their mutual fascination with American Indian dance and culture. They married on October 20, 1928. =Dance career= By the time they married, the Laubins had already begun to experiment with a career as an Indian dance team. Shortly before their wedding, they quit their jobs and became professional Indian lore performers. The Great Depression made it difficult to earn a living as an artist, but Laubin found a niche by marketing the show as education. The duo appeared on stages for local civic clubs, school groups, museums, Scout troops, and churches. In a typical show, Laubin performed several carefully choreographed interpretations of Plains Indian dances while Gladys accompanied him on the tom-tom and occasionally sang. Most shows also included recorded orchestral music, an array of props and backdrops, and pyrotechnic blasts of smoke and fire. Laubin interspersed his dancing with talks on Plains Indian culture. A turning point in Laubin's career came in the summer of 1929 when the couple traveled to Colorado to visit Ralph Hubbard at his Ten-Sleep Ranch. Hubbard took the Laubins to local Indian events, taught them songs and dances, and helped them purchase props and costumes for their show. A highlight of the trip was a visit to Cheyenne Frontier Days. There, the Laubins watched an Indian parade and war dance, but the performance by Native Americans disappointed the couple. At the same event, an Indian woman criticized Laubin's dancing. Another turning point came when the Laubins visited Standing Rock Indian Reservation in 1934. There they met One Bull, a nephew of Sitting Bull and a veteran of the Battle of the Little Bighorn. Disappointed to see One Bull wearing white clothing, Laubin lent him his dance outfit for a photo. When the Sioux man saw Laubin's shield with its drawing of a buffalo bull, he said that Laubin had written his name, One Bull. Laubin claimed that One Bull took the drawing as a sign that the couple had been sent by a higher force to represent Sioux people. The next day, One Bull and his family adopted the Laubins. One Bull gave Laubin his own name, Tatanka Wanjila (One Bull), and to Gladys he gave his mother's name, Wiyaka Wastewin (Good Feather Woman). Laubin used this adoption story, which he embellished over time, as a promotional tool and retold it at every performance. After the Laubins performed at Times Hall in New York City in December 1947, they began to be regarded as serious artists. They built a cabin in Moose, Wyoming, in 1952 and hosted Indian lore enthusiasts who traveled from around the world. In 1953, the Laubins went on a five-month tour of Europe and North Africa with a company of nine Crow people. Beginning in 1955, the couple became the featured performers at Jackson Lake Lodge, and they continued to perform there for thirty-three years. They won a Capezio Dance Award in 1972. =Retirement and death= The Laubins gave their last performance at Jackson Lake Lodge in 1988. In 1996, Laubin donated his collection to the Spurlock Museum at the University of Illinois. The collection includes objects that the Laubins used in performances, some created by Native American artists and others created by the Laubins in traditional style. The Spurlock Museum, opened in 2002, named its Laubin Gallery of American Indian Cultures in the couple's honor. Laubin died on Wednesday, April 5, 2000, at a hospital in Urbana, Illinois. Reception and Legacy =Critical reception= Critics reviewed Laubin's dancing favorably. John Martin wrote for the New York Times, \\"Theoretically there is little to be said in defense of dancers who go about doing 'authentic' dances of other races. Why the same indefensibility does not attach itself to the Laubins it would be difficult to say, but it definitely does not.\\" Many Native American people appreciated Laubin's performances. For example, Laubin claimed that at the 1947 Crow Fair, Crow leader Bird Horse led him around the dance arena and chided the younger Crows, \\"Look at him. He's nothing but a white man but he looks more real, more like early days, than you young fellows do.\\" =Legacy= Laubin became an icon of the Indian lore movement. As such, he believed and promoted the assumptions that Indians were vanishing, that their way of life could be an antidote for the ills of white culture, and that whites could speak for Indians. Laubin glorified Indian culture while assuming that \\"real\\" Indians were the Indians of the past. He thought that Indians had to resist the modern world in order to remain authentic, and he believed he could teach Indians how to be \\"Indian.\\" It is in part thanks to Laubin that when people hear the word Indian, they picture a dancing Plains Indian from the 19th century. Laubin took seriously native people's cultural values, he and valued them as a core component of American identity. Paradoxically, historian Clyde Ellis has pointed out that Laubin and other Indian hobbyists made it difficult for Indians to be taken seriously as members of modern society.

The Anglican church was erected in 1768 and destroyed in 1776. The ruins are located beside the Cape Fear River in the Brunswick Town Historic District, along with Fort Anderson, Russelborough, and the nearby Orton Plantation. Construction lasted 14 years, but took only one day to be destroyed when the British Army burned Brunswick Town. Before its demise, the church was considered one of the finest religious structures in North Carolina. On February 26, 1970, the historic site was added to the National Register of Historic Places. History In 1741, the St. Philip's Parish was created in Brunswick Town with Rev. James Moir as the first vicar. It was the sister church of St. James Church, Wilmington. Construction of St. Philip's Church began in 1754, but was not completed until 1768. The first minister to lead the new church was Rev. John Barnett and Governor Arthur Dobbs designated St. Philip's as \\"His Majesty‚Äôs Chapel in North Carolina.\\" Barnett was succeeded by J. Cramp and Nicholas Christian. During the American Revolutionary War, the British Army attacked Brunswick Town and burned the church, Russelborough, and most of the homes and businesses. The church walls were the only parts of the structure not to be destroyed. Brunswick Town was deserted and the church remains were relatively untouched for almost a century. In March 1862, Confederate engineers began to survey the remains of Brunswick Town and St. Philip's Church. They built earthworks and trenches throughout the town, covering the remains of several burnt structures except for the church. The fort was constructed to protect the city of Wilmington upstream, a vital port during the Civil War. The bastion was named Fort St. Philip, but renamed Fort Anderson in July 1863. During the attack on Fort Anderson in February 1865, cannonballs shot from Union ships hit the walls of the church and are still evident today. Confederate soldiers killed in action (KIA) were initially placed inside the church. When the Confederate forces were defeated, Union soldiers desecrated several graves at St. Philip's Church and removed the building's cornerstone. In 1899, the newly formed Cape Fear Chapter of the North Carolina Society of the Colonial Dames of America visited the historic site to pay homage to American Revolutionary War casualties in Brunswick Town. In 1902, Cape Fear Chapter erected a marble plaque inside St. Philip's to commemorate Brunswick Town co-founder, Maurice Moore. Excavations at Brunswick Town began in 1958 and items such as bullets, buttons, and a cannonball were retrieved from inside the ruins. The building is now part of the Brunswick Town State historic site. Visitors may walk through the church and tour the earthworks of nearby Fort Anderson. Architecture The ruins consist of four brick walls, as well as graves located inside and outside of the church. The bricks used for construction were imported from England and the walls measure three feet (0.91 m) thick. The building is 76 feet, six inches (23.3 m) long, 53 feet, three inches (16.2 m) wide, and 24 feet, four inches (7.4 m) high. The floor and roof were destroyed in the fire, as well as the three doors and eleven windows that measured fifteen by seven feet (4.6 m x 2.1 m). The church floor was made of wood, except for the aisles which featured one-foot-square (0.3 m) brick tiles that formed the shape of a cross. The pews were wooden and the Governor's pew was raised above the others. Twelve burial sites are located inside the church and there are several graves remaining outside of the structure that were not desecrated by Union troops. Notable people buried at St. Philip's Church include Arthur Dobbs, Governor Benjamin Smith, and Supreme Court Associate Justice Alfred Moore.

He was known as the \\"father of the Carinthian Slovenes\\".http://www.druzina.si/ICD/spletnastran.nsf/all/C79F7AF194409475C12573A8003F458B?OpenDocument Einspieler was born in the village of Suetschach () near Feistritz im Rosental () in the Duchy of Carinthia. He attended the lyceum and later the theological seminary in Klagenfurt. He served as a priest throughout the Slovene-inhabited areas of southern Carinthia. During the spring of nations of 1848, he collaborated with the fellow Carinthian Slovene priest and political activist Matija Majar and became a fervent advocate of the political program of United Slovenia. In 1851, Einspieler co-founded the Hermagoras Society (Mohorjeva dru≈æba), the oldest Slovene publishing house, together with the Carinthian philologist Anton Jane≈æiƒç and the Styrian priest Anton Martin Slom≈°ek. Due to Einspieler's restless cultural and publicist activity, Klagenfurt emerged as the major cultural center of the Slovene national revival in the 1850s. Einspieler's birth house in Suetschach (Sveƒçe) near Feistritz im Rosental (Bistrica v Ro≈æu) With the beginning of the constitutional period in the Austrian Empire in 1860, Einspieler gradually abandoned the ideal of United Slovenia as unachieveble. He wrote numerous articles in the German language, calling for a collaboration between Slovene and German speakers in Carinthia and in other regions of the Slovene Lands. In 1865, he pushed through initiator the so-called Maribor Program, in which a group of Old Slovenes (a conservative fraction within the Slovene national movement) proposed the re- establishment of Inner Austria, a largely autonomous and federative political unit within the Austrian Empire into which the traditional provinces of Carinthia, Styria, Carniola, and Austrian Littoral would be merged. He launched the journal Stimmen aus Inner√∂sterreich (\\"News from Inner Austria\\"), written mainly in the German language, in order to convince the German- speaking public to accept this idea. The program was however rejected by both Slovene and ethnic German nationalists. At the beginning of the 1870s, Einspieler was marginalized from the mainstream in Slovene politics, although he continued his political activity. In 1876, he was elected in the Klagenfurt municipal council. He died in Klagenfurt in 1888.  Legacy  During all his active life, Einspieler fought for the linguistic and political rights of the Carinthian Slovenes. He became known as \\"the father of Carinthian Slovenes\\". In 1979, the Slovene Christian Cultural Association from Carinthia Einspieler Prize established the Einspieler Award, which is given to individuals who have rendered outstanding services to the cause of co-existence among different peoples or nationalities. The prize has been awarded to, among others, the governor of South Tyrol, Luis Durnwalder; scholar and professor at the Central European University, Anton Pelinka; Roman Catholic prelate, Egon Kapellari; and Austrian politician, Rudolf Kirchschl√§ger.

Their motto is \\"La coh√©sion fait la force\\" or \\"Cohesion brings strength\\". From 1972 to 2015, the designation was also used for units based in large cities in metropolitan France. In 2015, the metropolitan GIPNs were integrated into RAID, the National Police's crisis response unit and officially became known as \\"Regional RAID branches\\" ().Jean-Marc Tanguy Le RAID - 30 ans d'intervention, Editions Pierre de Taillac, Paris - 2015 History In the wake of the tragic events of the Munich massacre in which Israeli team members were kidnapped and killed by Palestinian terrorists, the various European police forces decided to form special units able to fight against forms of terrorism and for other crises such as excessive use of force, hostage situations, escorts etc. The French National Police responded by creating an \\"anti-commando\\" brigade‚Äîalso known as BRI-BAC‚Äîwithin the Paris Research and Intervention Brigade and GIPNs in the largest province cities, while the National Gendarmerie established its own unit: GIGN. The first GIPN was created on 27 October 1972 in Marseille by the commissaire divisionnaire Georges Nguyen Van Loc and could only intervene at the request of judges or prosecutors. It was composed of thirty men who had the latest weapons and sophisticated equipment and became the second hostage-rescue team of the French National Police after the Paris BRI-BAC. The National Police initially formed 11 intervention groups but reduced this number to seven by 1985. This was later expanded to nine with the creation of GIPN units in R√©union in 1992 and in New Caledonia in 1993. The Ministerial Circular of August 4, 1995 established the policies of the use of the GIPN: organization, rules of engagement, territorial competence, missions, principles of actions, implementation, means and coordination. In November 2013, the metropolitan GIPNs came under operational control of the RAID, the National Police's crisis response that had been established in 1985. Finally, in March 2015, they were permanently integrated and officially became \\"Regional RAID branches\\" ().Jean- Marc Tanguy Le RAID - 30 ans d'intervention, Editions Pierre de Taillac, Paris - 2015 pp 59-60 Organisation The GIPN were created as units of the Central Directorate of Public Security (Fr: Direction Centrale de la S√©curit√© Publique or DCSP) which is the uniformed patrol and response branch of the French National Police. The DCSP has competency in 75 departments and within the territorial services of 7 large provincial towns (Lille, Strasbourg, Lyon, Nice, Marseilles, Bordeaux, Rennes) and overseas (La R√©union, New Caledonia and Antilles- French Guiana). RAID, including its regional branches comes under the authority of the head of the national police force (). RAID is also the leading unit of the GIPN a semi-permanent force which, when activated includes the BRI of the Pr√©fecture de Police de Paris (BRI-BAC) and the overseas GIPNs. Composed of police officers recruited according to very selective criteria, equipped with the best and latest material and subjected to a rigorous and followed drive, the GIPN can furnish groups of police officers to the service of other police units. Each unit is commanded by a senior police officer, assisted by a brigadier, brigadier-chef or brigadier- major (within the French National Police, this military rank corresponds approximately to the non-commissioned ranks in the military force). He has the command of his unit during an operation, having though assistance from other participating police services. They intervene with other services of the National police force, each time the situation requires it, with the constant concern for the preservation of the physical integrity of negotiators and only to use necessary force strictly that as a last resort. GIPN deployment There are three units in the overseas departments and territories of France: * New Caledonia with 16 men * R√©union with 16 men * Guadeloupe (jurisdiction over the French East Indies) Weapons and equipment The GIPN arsenal includes a wide range of weapons such as: * Pistols: SIG Sauer SIG Pro SP2022 (specially developed for French law enforcement in the biggest single sidearm contract since WWII with 250,000 ordered for both agencies), Glock 17 and Glock 26. * Revolvers: Manurhin MR-73, Blacksmith and Smith & Wesson 686. * Submachine guns: H&K; MP5, A3 and SD6, FN P90 and UMP45 * Assault rifles: H&K; G36K and G36C, and the firm of the SSG 551 and 552 commando. * Sniper rifles: PGM Ultima Ratio, Steyr-Mannlicher SSG, Blaser LRS2, Tikka T3 Tactical. * Non- lethal weapons: Taser X26, LBD Brugger & Thomet 40√ó46, Verney-Carron Flash Ball. As for personal protection, the GIPN maintains Kevlar helmets with bulletproof visors, bulletproof vests of different categories (II; III; IV or V), guards and knuckles, armored shields. Recruitment Organised at the national level by the DCSP, the selections take place once a year and roll within a structure DFPN (ENP Saint-Malo or N√Æmes) with the assistance of a group of psychologists. The first part of the selection is common to all the FIPN units. All National policemen and senior police officers may apply, as long as they meet the administrative criteria a minimum of five years of service and be no more than 35 years old. About fifty candidates are selected and conveyed to the selected site where, during a first week, they must pass a series of events, records review, personality tests, combat ability, claustrophobia, giddiness, athletic ability, swimming etc. At the end of this first week, part of the candidates are eliminated, and the others continue with mental tests during four days. After finishing these tests, a score of candidates will be admitted into the GIPN where their training now starts.

Adverse effects may be due to food allergy, food intolerance, other physiological mechanisms (such as metabolic or toxins), or a combination of these. Elimination diets typically involve entirely removing a suspected food from the diet for a period of time from two weeks to two months, and waiting to determine whether symptoms resolve during that time period. In rare cases, a health professional may wish to use an elimination diet, also referred to as an oligoantigenic diet, to relieve a patient of symptoms they are experiencing. Common reasons for undertaking an elimination diet include suspected food allergies and suspected food intolerances. An elimination diet might remove one or more common foods, such as eggs or milk, or it might remove one or more minor or non-nutritive substances, such as artificial food colorings. An elimination diet relies on trial and error to identify specific allergies and intolerances. Typically, if symptoms resolve after the removal of a food from the diet, then the food is reintroduced to see whether the symptoms reappear. This challenge‚Äìdechallenge‚Äìrechallenge approach has been claimed to be particularly useful in cases with intermittent or vague symptoms. The exclusion diet can be a diagnostic tool or method used temporarily to determine whether a patient‚Äôs symptoms are food-related. The term elimination diet is also used to describe a \\"treatment diet\\", which eliminates certain foods for a patient. Adverse reactions to food can be due to several mechanisms. Correct identification of the type of reaction in an individual is important, as different approaches to management may be required. The area of food allergies and intolerances has been controversial and is currently a topic that is heavily researched. It has been characterised in the past by lack of universal acceptance of definitions, diagnosis and treatment. History The concept of the elimination diet was first proposed by Dr. Albert Rowe in 1926 and expounded upon in his book, Elimination Diets and the Patient's Allergies, published in 1941.Rowe, A. Elimination Diets and the Patient's Allergies. 2nd Edition. Lea & Febiger, Philadelphia, PA: 1944 In 1978 Australian researchers published details of an 'exclusion diet' to exclude specific food chemicals from the diet of patients. This provided a basis for challenge with these additives and natural chemicals. Using this approach, the role played by dietary chemical factors in the pathogenesis of chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) was first established and set the stage for future DBPCT trials of such substances in food intolerance studies. Definitions \\"Food hypersensitivity\\" is an umbrella term which includes food allergy and food intolerance. Food allergy is defined as an immunological hypersensitivity which occurs most commonly to food proteins such as egg, milk, seafood, shellfish, tree nuts, soya, wheat and peanuts. Its biological response mechanism is characterized by an increased production of IgE (immunoglobulin E) antibodies. A food intolerance on the other hand does not activate the individual's immune response system. A food intolerance differs from a food allergy or chemical sensitivity because it generally requires a normal serving size to produce symptoms similar to an IgE immunologic response. While food intolerances may be mistaken for a food allergy, they are thought to originate in the gastrointestinal system. Food intolerances are usually caused by the individual‚Äôs inability to digest or absorb foods or food components in the intestinal tract. One common example of food intolerance is lactose intolerance. *Metabolic food reactions are due to an inborn or acquired errors of metabolism of nutrients such as in diabetes mellitus, lactase deficiency, phenylketonuria and favism. Toxic food reactions are caused by the direct action of a food or additive without immune involvement. *Pharmacological reactions are generally to low molecular weight chemicals which occur either as natural compounds such as salicylates, amines, or to artificially added substances such as preservatives, coloring, emulsifiers and taste enhancers including glutamate (MSG). These chemicals are capable of causing drug-like (biochemical) side effects in susceptible individuals. *Toxins may either be present naturally in food or released by bacteria or from contamination of food products. *Psychological reactions involve manifestation of clinical symptoms caused not by the food but by emotions associated with the food. The symptoms do not occur when the food is given in an unrecognizable form. Although an individual may have an adverse reaction to a food, this is not considered a food intolerance. Elimination diets are useful to assist in the diagnosis of food allergy and pharmacological food intolerance. Metabolic, toxic and psychological reactions should be diagnosed by other means. Diagnosis Food allergy is principally diagnosed by careful history and examination. When reactions occur immediately after certain food ingestion then diagnosis is straight forward and can be documented by using carefully performed tests such as the skin prick test (SPT) and the radioallergosorbent test RAST to detect specific IgE antibodies to specific food proteins and aero-allergens. However false positive results occur when using the SPT when diagnosis of a particular food allergen is hard to determine. This can be confirmed by exclusion of the suspected food or allergen from the patient's diet. It is then followed by an appropriately timed challenge under careful medical supervision. If there is no change of symptoms after 2 to 4 weeks of avoidance of the protein then food allergy is unlikely to be the cause and other causes such as food intolerance should be investigated. This method of exclusion-challenge testing is the premise by which the Elimination Diet is built upon, as explained in the sections below. Vega machine testing, a bioelectric test, is a controversial method that attempt to measure allergies or food or environmental intolerances. Currently this test has not been shown to be an effective measure of an allergy or intolerance. Food intolerance due to pharmacological reaction is more common than food allergy and has been estimated to occur in 10% of the population. Unlike a food allergy, a food intolerance can occur in non-atopic individuals. Food intolerances are more difficult to diagnose since individual food chemicals are widespread and can occur across a range of foods. Elimination of these foods one at a time would be unhelpful in diagnosing the sensitivity. Natural chemicals such as benzoates and salicylates found in food are identical to artificial additives in food processing and can provoke the same response. Since a specific component is not readily known and the reactions are often delayed up to 48 hours after ingestion, it can be difficult to identify suspect foods. In addition, chemicals often exhibit dose-response relationships and so the food may not trigger the same response each time. There is currently no skin or blood test available to identify the offending chemical(s), and consequently, elimination diets aimed at identifying food intolerances need to be carefully designed. All patients with suspected food intolerance should consult a physician first to eliminate other possible causes. The elimination diet must be comprehensive and should contain only those foods unlikely to provoke a reaction in a patient. They also need to be able to provide complete nutrition and energy for the weeks it will be conducted. Professional nutritional advice from a dietitian or nutritionist is strongly recommended. Thorough education about the elimination diet is essential to ensure patients and the parents of children with suspected food intolerance understand the importance of complete adherence to the diet, as inadvertent consumption of an offending chemical can prevent resolution of symptoms and render challenge results useless. While on the elimination diet, records are kept of all foods eaten, medications taken, and symptoms that the patient may be experiencing. Patients are advised that withdrawal symptoms can occur in the first weeks on the elimination diet and some patients may experience symptoms that are worse initially before settling down. While on the diet some patients become sensitive to fumes and odours, which may also cause symptoms. They are advised to avoid such exposures as this can complicate the elimination and challenge procedures. Petroleum products, paints, cleaning agents, perfumes, smoke and pressure pack sprays are particular chemicals to avoid when participating in an elimination diet. Once the procedure is complete this sensitivity becomes less of a problem. Clinical improvement usually occurs over a 2 to 4 week period; if there is no change after a strict adherence to the elimination diet and precipitating factors, then food intolerance is unlikely to be the cause. A normal diet can then be resumed by gradually introducing suspected and eliminated foods or chemical group of foods one at a time. Gradually increasing the amount up to high doses over 3 to 7 days to see if exacerbated reactions are provoked before permanently reintroducing that food to the diet. A strict elimination diet is not usually recommended during pregnancy, although a reduction in suspected foods that reduce symptoms can be helpful. Challenge testing Challenge testing is not carried out until all symptoms have cleared or improved significantly for five days after a minimum period of two weeks on the elimination diet. The restrictions of the elimination diet are maintained throughout the challenge period. Open food challenges on wheat and milk can be carried out first, then followed by challenge periods with natural food chemicals, then with food additives. Challenges can take the form of purified food chemicals or with foods grouped according to food chemical. Purified food chemicals are used in double blind placebo controlled testing, and food challenges involve foods containing only one suspect food chemical eaten several times a day over 3 to 7 days. If a reaction occurs patients must wait until all symptoms subside completely and then wait a further 3 days (to overcome a refractory period) before recommencing challenges. Patients with a history of asthma, laryngeal oedema or anaphylaxis may be hospitalised as inpatients or attended in specialist clinics where resuscitation facilities are available for the testing. If any results are doubtful the testing is repeated, only when all tests are completed is a treatment diet determined for the patient. The diet restricts only those compounds to which the patient has reacted and over time liberalisation is attempted. In some patients food allergy and food intolerance can coexist, with symptoms such as asthma, eczema and rhinitis. In such cases the elimination diet for food intolerance is used for dietary investigation. Any foods identified by SPT or RAST as suspect should not be included in the elimination diet.

He pursued graduate degrees at Columbia University and Harvard University afterwards. Inaugural luncheon for President Kenneth Sills in Sargent Gymnasium, Bowdoin College, Brunswick, Maine, 1918 After working at Columbia for a brief period of time, Sills returned to teach at Bowdoin in 1906, where he soon became dean. After a failed run for the United States Senate as a democrat in 1916, Sills became president of Bowdoin in 1918. He kept determined to keep the school close to its liberal arts curriculum and closed down its Medical School of Maine in 1920. In the early 1930s, Sills was recruited by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt to commission a study on how the Bay of Fundy tides could harness electrical power and, from 1939 to 1941, he served as chairman of the board for the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching. After World War II, he served on the board of trustees of the World Peace Foundation.

Nathaniel Daggett House (also known as \\"The House that Never Moved\\") is an historic building located at 74 Roger Williams Avenue in East Providence, Rhode Island. The oldest portion of this saltbox likely dates to before 1700; it is one of the oldest structures in East Providence. The house has been‚Äîwithout moving‚Äîin three municipal, two state, and two colonial jurisdictions.Photo ca. 1890, photographer unknown  Description  The Nathaniel Daggett House is set close to the street on a large lot in a residential neighborhood that was first settled in the early seventeenth century but was largely built up in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The house was originally a two-story, gable-roofed, timber-framed, end-chimney dwelling, probably with only one room on each floor. A small entry and stair hall with front door opening to the south was squeezed in front of the chimney. A single-story lean-to with its own chimney was later added across the rear north side of the house and the roofline was altered to its present saltbox profile. About 1900, the house was acquired by the American Electrical Works at nearby Phillipsdale and was renovated to provide housing for workers. The facade was extended two bays by an addition to the west side of the house; the staircase was rebuilt and the front entrance shifted to the east wall of the entry hall, facing the street; eighteenth-century nine-over- nine sash were replaced with newer windows; and gable windows and dormers were added to permit use of the garret as living space - More recent changes include the addition of a single-car garage connected by a short ell to the south of the house and the demolition of the lean-to fireplace and chimney. In spite of these changes, the house retains a number of original features. Except for the rebuilt staircase and relocated front entrance, the original plan is intact and can be clearly read amid the accretions of later periods. Cased posts can be seen in older portions of the house and many two-panel doors remain. The original walk-in fireplace still exists, though a smaller modern fireplace has been constructed within, and slightly in front of it. For the most part the older sections of the house retain a sense of their original character; further restoration could make the structure's antiquity even more evident.  Significance  The Nathaniel Daggett House, one of the oldest extant dwellings in East Providence, is a rare surviving example of early colonial domestic architecture. It is particularly noteworthy because the method utilized to enlarge the original end-chimney house‚Äîthe addition of a rear lean-to with end fireplace in line with the original chimney‚Äîis more similar to northern Rhode Island building practice than to the mode customarily employed in Massachusetts, where houses were expanded by adding to the opposite side of the chimney, converting the structure into a center- chimney dwelling . This exhibits the close tie between Providence and western Rehoboth, a tie that developed and flourished even though the two communities were located in different colonies and, later, states. The Daggett House has long been recognized as a historical site and is known to local residents as \\"the house that never moved,\\" a designation referring to the fact that the house has stood in three towns and two states while remaining on its original site. It is thus a significant folk artifact reflecting a popular view of local history. The rather sentimental, nostalgic association of the house with the region's early history, particularly with the settlement planted by Roger Williams a short distance to the north, made the structure the focus of an early historical-preservation campaign. In the 1890s the Daggett House was threatened with demolition to permit realignment of Roger Williams Avenue to accommodate a streetcar line. The scheme caused such consternation that the Rhode Island Historical Society formed a committee of prominent area scholars and businessmen to work for preservation of the structure. The house was saved, but underwent extensive changes to adapt it for use as a workers‚Äô tenement. Today, the Daggett house's status as a historical and cultural artifact and architectural relic make it one of East Providence's more important historical resources. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on November 28, 1980.  Ownership  In December 1632, Roger Williams, then in Salem, wrote a lengthy tract that openly condemned the King's charters and questioned the right of Plymouth (or Massachusetts) to the land without first buying it from the Indians. In October 1635, he was banished from the Massachusetts Bay Colony for his teachings and recalcitrance. This at a time \\"when men were burned at the stake for the good of their souls.\\" In the spring of 1636, Roger Williams obtained a grant [purchased] from the Wampanoag sachem, Massasoit, the northeast shore of Seekonk Cove where he was joined by his family and followers. \\"To this day [1886] are to be seen on the Dagget Farm, on the north side of Seekonk Cove [now Omega Pond] openings in the ground, which tradition says are the cellar holes\\" of the Williams settlement. Photo ca 1910 However, Plymouth authorities asserted that Williams was within their land grant and warned that they might still arrest him. With his crops already planted, he decided to cross the Seekonk River to present-day Providence, as that territory lay beyond any charter. In 1687, 26-year-old Nathaniel Daggett, of Rehoboth (see the Daggett House, in present-day Pawtucket) married neighbor Rebecca Miller. At some point he bought a large parcel of land near the Seekonk and Ten Mile Rivers, and built the two-room house for his wife and 5 children who survived infancy. The home stayed in the family for about 200 years. By the late 1800s, the area around the house had been developed into a major industrial area, with extensive factories, surrounded by worker and tenement housing. The Ten Mile River was dammed to create Omega Pond for industrial uses. The pond and Ten Mile River were, for a few years, a popular local recreational attraction. In the late 1890s, a proposed straightening of Roger Williams Avenue, and addition of a streetcar line, would have required demolition of the Nathaniel Daggett house. An outcry erupted, local academics and businessmen were mobilized, and the historic house was saved. American Electrical Works, a major local employer, bought the Daggett house and much of the surrounding neighborhood for worker housing, modernizing and expanding the modest saltbox in 1900. In 1927, the company sold off its worker housing and adjoining land. Deeds included a (now un-enforcible) clause that the \\"premises shall never be used or occupied by nor conveyed to any person of the negro race\\".Land Records, City of East Providence RI, Book 105, Page 30 August 30, 1927 2013 photo For almost 90 years, the Nathaniel Daggett House has been in the hands of three owners, who have been acutely aware of their responsibilities as stewards; the only significant change has been the addition of a garage and breezeway.

Sharpe was one of the finest full backs to have played for the football club. Sharpe always played with great passion and gave 100%. He debuted at left half but was soon switched to the position that he is always remembered for at right full back. When Dougie Sharpe arrived at Queens, already at the club was Scotland cap Billy Houliston, who joined Queens in 1945. Goalkeeper Roy Henderson joined the same year as Sharpe in 1946. In 1949 Jim Patterson joined the football club. Patterson would go on to score 251 goals in 14 seasons and become Queen of the South's record goalscorer. Fellow left full back Jimmy Binning joined in 1951 and goal scoring winger Bobby Black joined in 1952. At different levels all six would be selected to represent Scotland except Henderson who was selected six times as reserve goalkeeper.

Dougie Sharpe's fine performances were recognised with a call up in February 1952 to represent Scotland versus The Army in Newcastle. Fate intervened when Sharpe was unable to play having suffered concussion against Hearts the week before. However his time would come the following autumn in Belfast when he played versus the Irish League. Sharpe was with Queen of the South for twenty years and made 431 appearances for the club.

History In the Middle Ages Zeme was described as Cemide or Zemide. Since the tenth century Zeme belonged to the Bishop of Pavia and later to the priory of the Holy Cross of Mortara; in 1311 one half of the territory was confirmed as belonging to the Count palatine of Lomello. Zeme is named in imperial diplomas (1191, 1220) that assign the Lomellina to Pavia. During the Visconti period it came under the power of Filippino, son of Facino Cane, who in 1524 sold it to condottiero Angelo della Pergola (lord also of Sartirana). In 1528 his great-nephew Francesco della Pergola sold Zeme to the San Cassiano family, but in 1532 Zeme was assigned to the Chapter (religion) and the Bishopric of Vigevano. The domain of the Bishopric ceased only with the abolition of feudalism (1771).http://www.lombardiabeniculturali.it/istituzioni/schede/8500076/ Royal jurisdiction (it) In 1818 Zeme was finally united with Marza and Sant'Alessandro, once comuni, now consisting of simple farms.Italian Wikipedia Notes Category:Cities and towns in Lombardy ","title":"Zeme, Lombardy"},{"id":"17349000","text":"Mukjeong-dong is a legal dong, or neighbourhood of the Jung-gu district in Seoul, South Korea and governed by its administrative dong, Jangchung-dong.

For most of its existence, the title was the Tri-State version of the NWA United States Tag Team Championship. This group of promoters existed until Bill Watts' Mid-South Wrestling bought out the majority of the Tri-State territory, and also Gil Culkin and George Gulkin's Mississippi territory, in August 1979. After Watts took over, McGuirk took the title to Oklahoma, the only part of the Tri-State territory not owned by Watts. The U.S. Tag Team Championship's name was then changed to the Tri- State Tag Title in 1980. The title lasted until Tri-State closed in 1982, when Mid-South Wrestling took over Oklahoma from McGuirk.

The district represents the final subdivision of a country estate amassed by industrialist Orray Taft (1793-1865). It was laid out in 1904 and most of its residential stock was built between 1905 and 1930. The average size of the lots was 5400 square feet, although there was some variance in size, and a one-acre plot was reserved for the Taft mansion (demolished c. 1952 and the land subdivided). The houses are architecturally heterogeneous, reflecting all of the major styles of the period; some properties were designed by Norman Isham. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 24, 2003, and was enlarged in 2014 to include the southern part of Stillhouse Cove Reservation, a municipal park. The district abuts the Pawtuxet Village Historic District to the south, whose northernmost properties on Ocean Avenue were also laid out on the former Taft estate.

The building was constructed on pilings over the Providence River, and is especially notable for having survived the storm surge that accompanied the 1938 Hurricane, as well as the one that occurred during Hurricane Carol in 1954. The clubhouse was added to the National Register of Historic Places on February 23, 1989. The entire building was destroyed again by fire during the early morning hours of Wednesday, January 12, 2011. The fire began shortly after 4:00 am EST by lightning during an intense snowstorm; by 5:30 am, the building was gone. No one was injured, and officers say they plan to rebuild. What was left of the building was razed, save for the pilings, which now support a wooden dock. The slips and mooring field remain operational. Rebuilding of the new building started in March 2016 and was completed and opened in the Spring of 2018http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20180519/seven-years-after-fire- cranstons-edgewood-yacht-club-resurrected, just in time for the next sailing season.

TIP is aimed at speeding the development of new research targeted to address specific national problems. Funding is provided to industry (small and medium-sized businesses), universities, and consortia for research on new technologies for solving critical national problems that present high technical risks, with commensurate high rewards if successful. The primary mechanism for this support are cost-shared research grants, cooperative agreements, or contracts awarded on the basis of merit competitions. =Features= The major features of the Technology Innovation Program are established in the authorizing legislation.

The other component of the term - jo - came from the word jogu, which is often used with the phrase \\"saki jogu\\" or someone who savors alcohol. There are scholars who note that amejo means someone who has an affinity for America and that the derogatory connotation was a result of a misunderstanding of the Okinawan language. In her book Asian Mystique, author Sheridan Prasso explained the amejo in terms of the fetishizing that goes on between non-Asian males and Asian females: Although Amejo is predominantly used for Okinawan women in relationships with white men, those who date primarily black American men are also included under the term, but are usually referred to as or \\"black(loving) girl\\" instead. Prasso explains the kokujo: For Americans stationed in Okinawa, the term amejo came to mean American groupie or a \\"night owl\\". An account described how the term amejo was embraced by some who were given the pejorative, reappropriating the label as a source of pride, resistance, and social distinction as well as a demonstration of courage to be different.

The Toronto Argonauts defeated the Edmonton Eskimos 21-11 at Toronto's Varsity Stadium. Game highlights An audience of 27 391 watched as acting Canadian Prime Minister C. D. Howe opened the game with a ceremonial football kickoff, where Edmonton Mayor William Hawrelak held the ball, and Toronto Mayor Allan Lamport was watching nearby. Hometown coach Frank Clair and his team enjoyed a decisive victory despite trailing in the first quarter. Edmonton coach Frank Filchock was dismissed soon after his team's defeat. First quarter: Normie Kwong earned a touchdown for Edmonton at the 13:05 mark, the only score of the first quarter. Second quarter: Toronto took the lead when it earned six points from a touchdown by Nobby Wirkowski at 3:06, and a conversion by Red Ettinger, who would score again that quarter with a 3-point field goal at 11:35. Billy Bass earned Toronto's second touchdown of the quarter at 13:28, converted again by Ettinger. Edmonton was left scoreless in this quarter which ended with a 15-5 Toronto lead. Third quarter: Kwong's second touchdown of the game occurred at 10:24 and converted by Bill Snyder, the only points recorded in this quarter. Toronto continued to lead 15-11. Fourth quarter: Edmonton was shut out in the final quarter as Toronto's Zeke O'Connor touched down at 9:40, followed by a conversion from Ettinger. Grey Cup's first telecast This was the first Grey Cup match to be televised as CBC Television's Toronto flagship station, CBLT, paid CAD$7,500 to the Canadian Rugby Union for the rights to broadcast the game. The broadcast was only available locally on CBLT which had only begun broadcasts less than three months earlier. Live network television connections with other CBC stations were not available until 1953, although kinescope films of the game were produced for movie theatres and other television stations. A technical failure prevented viewers from seeing 29 minutes of the game video. This interrupted the telecast during much of the third quarter, although commentator audio was still transmitted. Images were restored into the final quarter when CBC technicians repaired the link at the CBC's tower which received the feed from Varsity Stadium. The reported cause of the transmission relay failure was a vacuum tube worth $1.85. Despite this setback, this inaugural Grey Cup broadcast was reported to have had the most viewers of any Canadian television production to that date.

Scorched won the International Emmy Award for Digital Program: Fiction in 2009.http://www.iemmys.tv/awards_previous.aspx Synopsis Scorched looks at the problems of climate change and water scarcity in the near future. The year is 2012, and after over 240 days without rain, Sydney has only two weeks of water left. As a state of emergency is declared when a ring of bushfires erupt around the city, a reporter uncovers a conspiracy behind the water crisis.Airdate: Scorched Plot It's several days before Christmas in 2012, and Sydney is in the midst of a water crisis. Despite the creation of a desalination plant, which NSW Premier Angela Boardman insists creates millions of litres of fresh water a day, the city is still under Level 8 water restrictions. The western suburbs especially are seriously dry. Ambitious CPN reporter Susan Shapiro launches an investigation into the crisis. Her report catches the attention of the Premier, who grants Shapiro an interview. Although Shapiro is amicable (perhaps too much so - her cameraman Teddy accuses her of turning into Oprah), she is still suspicious. And with good reason; later conversation between Boardman and her Chief of Staff Tom Daily reveal they are sharing a secret that could end both their careers. David Langmore, the State Operations Commander for the National Fire Service, is preparing dinner when he receives a call from Shapiro. He is angry that the reporter has called him at home and insists the water shortage has been caused solely by a lack of rain. ER doctor Michael Francia is enjoying some quiet time with his pregnant wife Lizzie when Emily, his daughter from a previous relationship, shows up on his door. She has had a fight with her mother and needs a place to stay, even though, as she later confesses to her stepmother Lizzie, she isn't sure if her father likes her. Meanwhile, a lightning storm forms over a national park in the western outskirts of Sydney. A bolt of lightning strikes a tree, which bursts into flames. The dry bushland quickly ignites. The next day at work, Dr Francia is frantically trying to attend to an influx of patients suffering dehydration and heat exhaustion. A courier truck, carrying dozens of gas cylinders, speeds into the hospital car park and a bloodied man is dragged into the hospital lobby. During the commotion that follows, the truck outside is forgotten about and unbeknownst to anyone, one of the cylinders begins to leak. David Langmore is monitoring the fires in the hopes that his team can prevent them from becoming fireheads. Volunteer firefighters, including David's son Brendan and Brendan's girlfriend Deanna, are sent out to control the blaze. Deanna and two other volunteers are overwhelmed by the size and ferocity of the flames and attempt to escape by car. Langmore and the rest of the workers in the control centre watch helplessly via closed circuit cameras as the fire consumes the car and the three perish. It becomes apparent that they have a crisis on hand. The Premier announces a state of emergency and Langmore calls a Section 44, enacting that section of the Rural Fires Act 1997 (NSW); the effect of which means all emergency workers in the area are now under his control. Police and firefighters struggle to fight the flames but are deterred by a lack of water and pressure in the hoses. Lizzie Francia receives a call from her invalid mother. Although Lizzie is concerned, she refuses Emily's offer to collect her mother from her nursing home. Emily sneaks away while Lizzie is dealing with a concerned neighbour. However, she encounters a detour and ends up driving close to the fire. She runs to escape the smoke but falls down a rocky hill and loses consciousness. Shapiro reports from the frontlines. When firefighters try to tap into a residential water tank, the elderly owner becomes incensed and has a heart attack. Shapiro and Teddy take the man to the hospital, where they meet Dr Francio. They encourage him to tell his wife to evacuate. Shapiro also meets the brother of one of Boardman's political opponents and discovers that she received a large, anonymous donation a month before the election. Francio calls his wife and urges her to evacuate. Mid- conversation, the leaking gas cylinder in the courier truck explodes. Francio miraculously survives, but several people in the hospital are injured. Lizzie, meanwhile, is forced to evacuate on foot. When she runs into Shapiro, Lizzie begs the reporter to take her two small children in the news helicopter. Shapiro agrees. Langmore meets with the Premier and insists that they use the water from the desalination plant. Boardman refuses his request. Reluctantly, they resort to using saltwater (which can cause irreparable damage to nature) and the blaze is eventually extinguished. Emily is found and receives medical attention. Francio rushes to be by her side and promises that he likes her 'with all (his) heart.' Upon hearing that over 300 people have died, Daily sends Shapiro a video text message. The video reveals that the Premier made a deal with Argon Energy that gave them unlimited fresh water in return for free power to the desalination plants and one million dollars. Shapiro and Teddy are killed when a factory she is reporting from explodes, releasing toxic gases; however, when Langmore checks his email later that afternoon, he finds a video message from the reporter, with the subject line, 'Guess what? Sometimes it isn't just about the weather.' Later, Boardman calls a press conference to discuss the tragic bushfires. Langmore attends. He asks her questions about the deal with Argon, which Boardman naturally denies. Langmore angrily calls her a liar and tells her that he has a video of their meeting.

Women form the majority of the tea pluckers. India is one of the largest tea producers in the world, although over 70 percent of its tea is consumed within India itself. A number of renowned teas, such as Assam and Darjeeling, also grow exclusively in India. The Indian tea industry has grown to own many global tea brands and has evolved into one of the most technologically equipped tea industries in the world. Tea production, certification, exportation, and all other facets of the tea trade in India is controlled by the Tea Board of India. History In India, the semi medicinal use of tea brew is noted in 1662 by Mendelslo: In 1689 Ovington records that tea was taken by the banias in Surat without sugar, or mixed with a small quantity of conserved lemons, and that tea with some spices added was used against headache, gravel and gripe. The tea leaves for such use may have come from China. While experimenting to introduce tea in India, British colonists noticed that tea plants with thicker leaves also grew in Assam, and these, when planted in India, responded very well. The same plants had long been cultivated by the Singphos tribe of Assam, and chests of tea supplied by the tribal ruler Ningroola. The Assamese and Chinese varieties have been regarded in the past as different related species, but are now usually classified by botanists as the same species, Camellia sinensis. In the early 1820s, the British East India Company began large-scale production of tea in Assam, India, of a tea variety traditionally brewed by the Singpho people. In 1826, the British East India Company took over the region from the Ahom kings through the Yandaboo Treaty. In 1837, the first English tea garden was established at Chabua in Upper Assam; in 1840, the Assam Tea Company began the commercial production of tea in the region. Beginning in the 1850s, the tea industry rapidly expanded, consuming vast tracts of land for tea plantations. By the turn of the century, Assam became the leading tea- producing region in the world.Adivasis in Assam http://www.indiatogether.org/2008/may/soc-assamadi.htm The introduction of Chinese tea plants, different from Indian tea, to India is commonly credited to Robert Fortune, who spent about two and a half years, from 1848 to 1851, in China working of behalf of the Royal Horticultural Society of London. Fortune employed many different means to steal tea plants and seedlings, which were regarded as property of the Chinese empire. He also used Nathaniel Bagshaw Ward's portable Wardian cases to sustain the plants. Using these small greenhouses, Fortune introduced 20,000 tea plants and seedlings to the Darjeeling region of India, on steep slopes in the foothills of the Himalayas, with the acid soil liked by Camellia plants. He also brought a group of trained Chinese tea workers who would facilitate the production of tea leaves. With the exception of a few plants which survived in established Indian gardens, most of the Chinese tea plants Fortune introduced to India perished. The technology and knowledge that was brought over from China was instrumental in the later flourishing of the Indian tea industry using Chinese varieties, especially Darjeeling tea, which continues to use Chinese strains. From the first, Indian-grown tea proved extremely popular in Britain, both for its greater strength, and as a patriotic product of the empire. Tea had been a high-status drink when first introduced, but had steadily fallen in price and increased in popularity among the working class. The Temperance movement massively promoted tea-drinking, from the early 19thC on, as an alternative to beer ‚Äì water being of dubious quality, but the complete boiling necessary for tea rendering it safe. Many men, in particular, found China tea insipid, and the greater strength, and lower price, of Indian teas appealed greatly. By the last quarter of the nineteenth century, big brands such as Lyons, Liptons and Mazawattee dominated the market. Tea was the dominant drink for all classes during the Victorian era, working-class families often doing without other foods in order to afford it. This meant the potential market for Indian teas was vast. Indian tea (effectively including Ceylon tea from Sri Lanka) soon came to be the \\"norm\\", with China tea a minority taste. Until the 1970s and the rise of instant coffee, Indian tea had almost sole command of the hot drinks market. Its rivals were cocoa, coffee and savoury drinks such as Bovril and Oxo. In recent decades Asian tea has lost much ground in the cheaper end of European markets to tea from Africa, especially Kenyan tea . Modern tea production in India View of tea plantations in Munnar Lockhart Tea Factory in Munnar Tata Tea Museum in Munnar Cherry Resort inside Temi Tea Garden, Namchi, Sikkim India was the top producer of tea for nearly a century, but recently China has overtaken India as the top tea producer due to increased land availability. Indian tea companies have acquired a number of iconic foreign tea enterprises including British brands Tetley and Typhoo. Indian Tea Giant Goodricke Group parent Camellia Plc becomes the world's largest private tea producer in 2018 producing 103 million kgs. As of 2013 the consumption of green tea in India was growing by over 50% a year. The major tea-producing states in India are: Assam, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Tripura, Arunachal Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, Sikkim, Nagaland, Uttarakhand, Manipur, Mizoram, Meghalaya, Bihar, Orissa. Government and the Indian tea industry The Indian tea industry as a mass employer has enjoyed the attention of the Indian government. When export sales went down, the government has been sympathetic to the demand of the industry and its cultivators. It has passed resolutions supporting the industry domestically and has also lobbied extensively with organizations like the WTO internationally. The Indian administration along with the European Union and six other countries (Brazil, Chile, Japan, South Korea and Mexico) filed a complaint with the WTO against the Byrd Amendment, which was formally known as the Continued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act of 2000 legislated by the US. The essence of this act was that non-US firms which sell below cost price in the US could be fined and the money is given to the US companies who made the complaint in the first place. The act adversely affected the commodities business of the complainant states and has since been repealed after WTO ruled the act to be illegal. Furthermore, the Indian government took cognizance of the changed tea and coffee market and set up an Inter-Ministerial Committee (IMC) to look into their problems in late 2003. The IMC has recommended that the government share the financial burden of plantation industry on account of welfare measures envisaged for plantation workers mandated under the Plantation Labour Act 1951. Moreover, IMC has recommended to introduce means so that the agricultural income tax levied by the state governments can be slashed and the tea industry be made competitive. It has recommended that sick or bankrupt plantation estates should be provided with analogous level of relaxation for similarly placed enterprises/estates as are available to industries referred to BIFR. A Special Tea Term Loan (STTL) for the tea sector was announced by the Indian government in 2004. It envisaged restructuring of irregular portions of the outstanding term/working capital loans in the tea sector with repayment over five to seven years and a moratorium of one year, which was to be on a case to case basis for large growers. The STTL also provides for working capital up to Rs. 2 lakhs at a rate not exceeding 9% to small growers. In addition to these measures, the Tea Board plans to launch a new marketing initiative, which will include foray into new markets such as Iran, Pakistan, Vietnam and Egypt. It also plans to renew its efforts in traditional markets like Russia, the UK, Iraq and UAE. Noteworthy is its intent to double tea exports to Pakistan within a year. Assam Orthodox Tea is set to receive the Geographical Indications (GI) exclusivity. A GI stamp identifies a certain product as emanating from the territory of a WTO member or region or locality in that territory, where a given quality, reputation or other characteristic of the good is essentially attributable to its geographic origin. The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs set up the Special Purpose Tea Fund (SPTF) under the tea Board on December 29, 2006. The aim is to fund replantation and rejuvenation (R&R;) programme. In the same year, Tata Tea entered into an agreement to take over Jemca, which controls a 26 percent market share in the Czech Republic. The CCEA gave its approval for pegging the subsidy at 25 per cent and adoption of a funding pattern of 25 per cent promoter's contribution, 25 per cent subsidy from the government and 50 per cent loan from the SPTF. Banks have also been instructed to increase the lending period to over 13 years. Beginning in 2013, the Union Ministry of Commerce and Industry has been actively promoting the sale of tea in the country's top five export markets for that product: Egypt, Iran, Kazakhstan, Russia, and the United States. Demand for a separate time zone Tea gardens in Assam do not follow the Indian Standard Time (IST), which is the time observed throughout India and Sri Lanka. The local time in Assam's tea gardens, known as \\"Tea Garden Time\\" or Bagantime, is an hour ahead of the IST.\\"Assam tea gardens an hour 'ahead' of India - ZeeNews.com\\". Retrieved 18 July 2013. The system was introduced during British days keeping in mind the early sunrise in this part of the country. By and large, the system has subsequently been successful in increasing the productivity of tea garden workers as they save on daylight by finishing the work during daytime, and vice versa. Working time for tea labourers in the gardens is generally between 9 a.m. (IST 8 a.m.) to 5 p.m. (IST 4 p.m.) It may vary slightly from garden to garden. Noted film maker Jahnu Barua has been campaigning for a separate time zone for the north-east region. In popular culture Sagina Mahato, a 1970 Bengali film, directed by Tapan Sinha, deals with labour rights in the tea plantations in the Northeast during the British Raj. Paradesi (English: Vagabond) is a 2013 Indian Tamil drama film written and directed by Bala. The film is based on real-life incidents that took place before independence in the 1930s, especially in southern tea estates.

Betafite typically occurs as a primary mineral in granite pegmatites, rarely in carbonatites. Defined by the B-site atom Ti, Atencio et al.(2010) combined and considered the ideas portrayed in (Hatert and Burke)(2008) and a modernization of (Hogarth)(1977) system for nomenclature of pyrochlore and betafite in order to further rationalize the naming process of this grouping of minerals. Therefore, Atencio et al. (2010), states that only two of the mineral species that were formerly recognized under the previous nomenclature system of betafite in Hogarth (1977) are now recognized. They are oxyuranobetafite and oxycalciobetafite. Now the term betafite is a synonym or varietal group name under the pyrochlore super group (Christy and Atencio 2013). Betafite from Madagascar Structure The pyrochlore supergroup minerals conform to the general formula, A2‚àímB2X6‚àíwY1‚àín, where the m, w, and n variables represent the parameters that indicate incomplete occupancy of the A, Y, and X sites (Atencio et al. 2010). They crystallize isometric system with a space group of Fdm or its subgroups where Betafite has a hexoctahedral class (Hogarth 1977). Site A is generally an 8-coordinated cation with a ~1.0 √Ö radius, B site is generally a 6-coordinated cation, which contains the elements Ti, Nb, and Ta usually for betafite, (Atencio et al. 2010, site X is generally O but can subjugate to OH and F, and site Y is typically an anion but can also be a vacancy, H2O, or a very large monovalent cation, like Cs, K, and Rb. Origin and uses The oxycalciobetafite in Camara et al. (2004) occurs in the pyroclastic formation belonging to the main effusive stage of the Vico activity where it is contained within foid-bearing syenite, which also holds optical observances of K-feldspar, and minor amphibole, plagioclase, magnetite, sodalite and rare biotite. While with SEM-EDS, titanite, apatite, and baddeleyite were also observed. While the geologic occurrence of oxycalciobetafite located on the moon has been rather difficult to ascertain. Oxyuranobetafite is also located on the moon and is described in Mokhov et al. (2008). Betafite is an important ore of thorium, uranium, and niobium. Though, there is no real applicable use as of yet for the accepted betafite species, the pyrochlore super-group that contains the former betafites of Hogarth (1977) are mentioned in Lumpkin and Ewing (1996), Turner (1928) and many others, all with the recurring theme of either extracting uranium, thorium, and niobium from the pyrochlore super-group ores. The depletion of uraninite rich ore bodies has led to the search and mild application of refractory uranium minerals as a source of uranium to keep up with the increasing demands.

Life and career Born Levy Isaac Attias on 23 September 1923 in Gibraltar to Jewish parents, he and his family were evacuated to England during World War II. On returning home, he worked in different jobs, including as an extra in films shot in Gibraltar. While appearing in the British film Wonderful Things! (1958), the actor Frankie Vaughan persuaded him to travel to London and become an actor, which he did in 1962, changing his name at Vaughan's suggestion to Ricardo Montez. He appeared primarily in television programmes, including The Saint, The Avengers, Doctor at Sea and Don't Drink the Water, in which he usually played Spanish characters, before being cast in his best known role as Juan Cervantes, the Spanish bartender in a class of mature English language students, in the situation comedy series Mind Your Language from 1977 and 1979, reprising his role in a revival of the series in 1986. In his later years, Montez continued to appear on television in programmes including Sharpe's Honour and Casualty, as well as in commercials. His final acting role was in the film Mamma Mia! (2008). He lived in Richmond, London, and used to visit Gibraltar twice a year. He married Orivida Hatchwell in 1953; they had a daughter, Clara, and a granddaughter, Sara. Montez died from cancer at his daughter's home in Marbella, Spain on 26 October 2010, at the age of 87.

Segal (June 11, 1907 ‚Äì June 1, 1997) was an American lawyer known for his advocacy for the poor and his work in the civil rights movement. Early life and education Segal was born in New York City but spent his childhood in Allentown and Philadelphia. He received both his bachelor's and law degrees at the University of Pennsylvania. Career Upon his graduation from law school, Segal became a deputy attorney general in the office of William A. Schnader, the Attorney General of Pennsylvania. At 24, Segal was the youngest deputy attorney general in state history. When Schnader lost a race for governor and established his own firm in 1935, Segal quickly became a partner, eventually serving as chairman of the firm, now known as Schnader, Harrison, Segal & Lewis. In the 1950s, Segal became the first Jewish lawyer elected chancellor of the Philadelphia Bar Association, the nation's oldest bar association. In 1969, he became president of the American Bar Association. In fifty years as a corporate lawyer specializing in appellate work, Segal represented blue-chip clients including Bell Telephone, RCA, NBC, Hertz Corporation, Gimbel Brothers, and also United Parcel Service, where he served for many years as director and general counsel. Segal argued nearly 50 cases before the Supreme Court of the United States, but as a lawyer Segal took a broad view of his calling. Segal was known as the nation's foremost advocate of merit selection of judges. In the mid-1950s he persuaded then Attorney General Herbert Brownell and President Dwight D. Eisenhower to submit to the American Bar Association Committee on the Federal Judiciary the names of all prospective federal judicial nominees, including the Supreme Court, for a report and recommendation on their qualifications. That practice has continued ever since, with Presidents very rarely appointing a Federal Judge found \\"Not Qualified\\" by the ABA Committee. Segal chaired that Committee for six years and continued his key role in judicial selection long after he relinquished his chairmanship. In 1963, as the civil rights revolution was heating up, Segal called Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy and asked why the President was not marshaling lawyers to help the civil rights movement. President John F. Kennedy convened a meeting of 244 prominent lawyers suggested by Segal and established the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, with Segal as co-chairman. The Committee sent lawyers to defend civil rights workers in southern states and played a critical role in advancing civil rights, not only in the south, but in many northern cities as well. Segal's wife, Dr. Geraldine Segal, a civil rights scholar in her own right, worked closely with Segal in their civil rights activities. Segal also played a seminal role in furthering legal services for the poor, chairing the Advisory Committee on the National Legal Services Program under President Lyndon B. Johnson and enlisting lawyers throughout the nation to provide legal services to the indigent. He was devoted to the principle that the most despised defendants also deserved a defense. In 1953, he organized the defense of nine Philadelphians denounced as Communists. Segal received honorary degrees from the University of Pennsylvania, Temple University, Villanova University, Franklin and Marshall College, Dropsie College, Jewish Theological Seminary of America, Vermont Law School, Georgetown University, Suffolk University and Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion. He received many other awards and honors from institutions and organizations throughout the world, among them the World Peace Through Law Award as the \\"World's Greatest Lawyer\\"; the National Civil Rights Award by the Attorney General of the United States; first Lifetime Achievement Award of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law; the National Human Relations Award by the National Conference of Christians and Jews; and the Judge William H.

DIMACS 2003. is a digital adaptation of continuum Morse theory for scalar volume data. This is not about the Samuel Morse's Morse code of long and short clicks or tones used in manual electric telegraphy. The term was first promulgated by DB Karron based on the work of JL Cox and DB Karron. The main utility of a digital Morse theory is that it serves to provide a theoretical basis for isosurfaces (a kind of embedded manifold submanifold ) and perpendicular streamlines in a digital context. The intended main application of DMT is in the rapid semiautomatic segmentation objects such as organs and anatomic structures from stacks of medical images such as produced by three-dimensional computed tomography by CT or MRI technology. DMT Tree A DMT tree is a digital version of a Reeb graph or contour tree graph, showing the relationship and connectivity of one isovalued defined object to another. Typically, these are nested objects, one inside another, giving a parent-child relationship, or two objects standing alone with a peer relationship. The essential insight of Morse theory can be given in a little parable. The fish tank thought experiment The fish tank thought experiment: Counting islands as the water level changes The essential insight of continuous Morse theory can be intuited by a thought experiment. Consider a rectangular glass fish tank. Into this tank, we pour a small quantity of sand such that we have two smoothly sloping small hills, one taller than the other. Now, we fill this tank to the brim with water. We now start a count of the number of island objects as we very slowly drain the tank. Our initial observation is that there are no island features in our tank scene. As the water level drops, we observe the water level just coincident with the peak of the tallest sand hill. We next observe the behavior of the water at the critical peak of the hill. We see a degenerate point island contour, with zero area, zero perimeter, and infinite curvature. A vanishing small change in the water level and this point contour expand into a tiny island. We now increment our island object count by +1. We continue to drain water from the tank. We next observe the creation of the second island at the peak of the second little hill. We again increment our island object count by +1 to two objects. Our little sea has two island objects in it. As we continue to slowly lower the water level in our little tank sea. We now observe the two island contours gradually expand and grow toward each other. As the water level reaches the level of the critical saddle point between the two hills the island contours touch at precisely the saddle point. We observe that our object count decrements by ‚Äì1 to give a total island count of one. The essential feature of this rubric is that we only need to count the peaks and passes to inventory all of the islands in our sea, or objects in our scene. This approach works even as we increase the complexity of the scene. We can use the same idea of enumerating peak, pits and pass criticalities in a very complex archipelago of island features, at any size scale, or any range of size scales, including noise at any size scale. The relationship between island features can be # Peers: two islands that at a lower water level 'merge' into a common parent. # Parent: an island that splits into two child islands at a higher water level. # Progeny: An island that has a Parent island feature as related above. Digital Morse theory relates Peaks, Pits and Passes to Parents, Peers and Progeny. This gives a cute mnemonic: PPP ‚Üí ppp. As the topology does not care about geometry or dimensionality (directly), complex optimizations in infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces are amenable to this kind of analysis.

As part of the announcement, the company disclosed that it had agreed to sell the bowling center business, which brought in $187 million in revenue in the prior year, to its much larger competitor Bowlmor AMF (now known as Bowlero Corporation) for $270 million. It also disclosed that it had retained Lazard to find a buyer for its bowling equipment and products business. The company said it was making these changes to focus on its ‚Äúcore‚Äù Marine and Fitness businesses, which provided 92% of company net revenues in 2013. The sale of the bowling center division to Bowlmor AMF was completed in September 2014. Brunswick completed its exit from the bowling business in May 2015 with the sale of the bowling equipment and products division to BlueArc Capital Management, a private investment firm based in Atlanta, GA. BlueArc completed the acquisition with investments from Gladstone Investment Corporation, a publicly traded business development company in McLean, Va., and Capitala Finance Corp., a business development company in Charlotte, N.C. BlueArc continues to manufacture bowling balls bearing the Brunswick and DV8 brand names, and in November 2019, the company announced it had purchased Ebonite International and all of its bowling product brands.

The sale was completed in June 2019. Billiards Logo used by Brunswick Billiards The billiards division was established in 1845 and was Brunswick Corporation's heritage business. Brunswick Billiards designs and/or markets billiards tables, table tennis tables, air powered table hockey games, and other gaming tables, as well as billiard balls, cues, game room furniture, and related accessories, under the Brunswick and Contender brands. Consumer billiards equipment is predominantly sold in the United States and distributed primarily through dealers. John Brunswick built his first billiards table in 1845 at his woodworking shop in Cincinnati, Ohio, for a successful Chicago meatpacker. The popularity of billiards grew quickly, and by the late 1860s, the U.S. billiards market was dominated by Brunswick‚Äôs firm and two others. In 1873 Brunswick merged with one of his competitors, Julius Balke‚Äôs Cincinnati-based Great Western Billiard Manufactory, to form J.M. Brunswick & Balke Company. In 1884, the company merged with the other competitor, New York-based Phelan & Collender, to form the Brunswick-Balke-Collender Company. (The company name was changed to Brunswick Corporation in 1960.) The company grew quickly and added new product lines to its business in the 1880s. Brunswick began selling functional and decorative wooden backs for bars. Prohibition prompted a drastic change in the products offered by the company. And while the Depression was a difficult period for Brunswick, World War II brought a great deal of new business. The company's billiard products were popular in the United Service Organizations (USO) centers. More than 13,000 billiards tables were installed at military bases by 1945. In 1972 Brunswick Billiards began the design and manufacture air hockey tables. In 2008 the company introduced a line of game room furniture. Brunswick Billiards dabbled in retail at two points in its history. In 1947 the company opened \\"Cue and Cushion\\" establishments, family-friendly billiards establishments that include a lounge and soda fountain. In 2003 the company opened its first ‚ÄúHome & Billards Store‚Äù in the Chicago area, and went on to open one other store in Boston and two in Denver. All of these establishments were later closed, and the company now sells its products exclusively through dealers. Bowling =Bowling centers= Logo used by Brunswick bowling centers Before its acquisition by Bowlmor AMF (now known as Bowlero Corporation) in October 2014, the Brunswick bowling center division was the second largest operator of bowling centers in the United States, with 88 centers in the US and Canada. Brunswick centers offered bowling and, depending on size and location, in-house restaurants, taverns, outdoor patios, billiards, video and redemption games, laser tag, pro shops, and meeting and party rooms. In 1965, facing a decline in business after a period of rapid expansion, many privately owned centers found it difficult to pay the bills, and Brunswick took physical possession of 131 of these centers as payment for bowling equipment. In 1966, still suffering from the decline, Brunswick closed many European bowling centers. In 2007 the company opened its first Brunswick Zone XL centers, large, smoke-free facilities aimed at families, bowling leagues, parties, corporate meetings and group events, offering bowling, laser tag, bumper cars, video game arcades, Brunswick billiards tables, large screen TVs, and spacious meeting rooms. During 2013 Brunswick Bowling divested its seven remaining European bowling centers. By January 2020, all remaining Brunswick Zone locations were rebranded with either the either Bowlero or AMF names. =Equipment and products= Logo used for Brunswick bowling products Brunswick semi-automatic pinsetters at the International Bowling Museum and Hall of Fame Now owned by BlueArc Capital Management of Atlanta, GA and its investor partners, the former Brunswick bowling equipment and products division designs, manufactures and markets a wide variety of bowling products. The company is now called Brunswick Bowling Products. The division's products for bowling centers include capital equipment, such as Sync (a scoring and management system), Spark (an immersive interactive bowling experience), automatic pinsetters, bowling pins, \\"house\\" bowling balls, ball returns, lane surfaces, and bowling center furniture, as well as aftermarket products such as pinsetter parts, lane conditioning machines, and conditioners and cleaners for lane machines. The company's current pinsetter model is in the GS Series but many A Series models remain in active service. Similarly, many centers still use Brunswick AS-80, AS-90, Classic, Frameworx, Vector, and Vector Plus scoring systems. Brunswick lane surfaces include the Anvilane and Pro Lane brands. The division's consumer products include its bowling balls as well as, through licensing arrangements, bowling shoes, bags and accessories. Products are marketed under the Brunswick, DV8, Radical, and other brand names. On November 15, 2019, Brunswick acquired Ebonite International and all of its bowling product brands. Products are manufactured or sourced mainly from facilities located in Michigan and Wisconsin in the United States, as well as in Hungary and Mexico. Bowling products are sold through a direct sales force or distributors in the United States and through distributors in non-U.S. markets. Brunswick began production of wooden lanes, bowling balls, and bowling pins in the 1880s as taverns began to install bowling lanes. John Brunswick‚Äôs son-in-law Moses Bensinger, who was then directing Brunswick‚Äôs day-to-day operations, actively promoted bowling as a participatory sport and was instrumental in organizing the American Bowling Congress in 1895. In 1906 Bensinger opened a large manufacturing plant in Muskegon, Michigan. The plant became the cornerstone of the firm's manufacturing, producing such products as the revolutionary $20 Mineralite (hard rubber) bowling ball, and grew to over one million square feet by the 1940s. During World War II, United Service Organizations (USO) centers and military bases eagerly purchased bowling equipment, leading to more than 3,000 bowling lanes being installed at military bases by 1945. At the time, Brunswick manufactured ‚Äúspotting tables‚Äù which were manually operated to place bowling pins in their proper places on a lane before a bowling ball was thrown at them. The company had toyed with the idea of an automatic pinsetter since 1911, when inventor Ernest Hedenskoog joined the company. Many of his patents provided the basis for the automatic pinsetter later introduced. It was not until the American Machine and Foundry Company (AMF) introduced the first fully automatic pinsetter in 1952 that Brunswick scrambled to get its own machine to market. In 1954 Brunswick formed the Brunswick-Murray Pinsetter Corporation with Murray Corporation of America, a manufacturer of components for autos and aircraft. By the time Brunswick‚Äôs ‚ÄúModel A‚Äù pinsetters were in full production in 1955, Brunswick had bought out Murray. Brunswick's policy of selling pinsetters on credit, suburban expansion, and an aggressive advertising campaign all combined to make bowling centers enormously popular in the late 1950s. By the mid-1960s, however, overexpansion led to a period of decline. Brunswick had begun assembling bowling equipment in Dublin in 1959, but it closed its Italian factory in 1966 and the Dublin facility in 1972. Then, in 1973, it entered into a manufacturing joint venture with Fuji Kikai-Hiroshima. In 2005 Brunswick moved its bowling ball production to Reynosa, Mexico, and in 2006 it closed the Muskegon plant. In 1967 Brunswick introduced the automatic scorer. In 1984, Brunswick acquired the Schmid Company of Scherzenbach, Switzerland, and with it the rights to manufacture and sell its GS pinsetter. The GS is Brunswick‚Äôs current pinsetter series. The mechanical portion of the pinsetter was originally manufactured in the Brunswick plant located in Stockach, Germany. In 1999 the mechanical manufacturing was relocated to Hungary.

Belyayev, founder of the Russian Symphony Concerts, by Ilya Repin The Russian Symphony Concerts were a series of Russian classical music concerts hosted by timber magnate and musical philanthropist Mitrofan Belyayev in St. Petersburg as a forum for young Russian composers to have their orchestral works performed. While a number of works by these composers were performed, pieces written by composers of the previous generation such as Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov and Mily Balakirev were also played there. History The idea for the Russian Symphony Concerts was Rimsky-Korsakov's. He had become acquainted with Belyayev at the weekly \\"quartet Fridays\\" (\\"Les Vendredis\\") held at Belayev's home. Belayev had already taken a keen interest in the musical future of the teenage Alexander Glazunov,Rimsky-Korsakov, 274. who had been one of Rimsky-Korsakov's composition students. In 1884, Belayev rented out a hall and hired an orchestra to play Glazunov's First Symphony plus an orchestral suite Glazunov had just composed.Rimsky-Korsakov, 275. Glazunov was to conduct part of this concert.Rimsky-Korsakov, 275. Seeing he was not ready to do this, Rimsky-Korsakov volunteered to take his place.Rimsky-Korsakov, 275. This \\"rehearsal,\\" as Rimsky-Korsakov called it, went well and pleased both Belayev and the invited audience.Rimsky-Korsakov, 276. Buoyed by the success of the rehearsal, Belayev decided the following season to give a public concert of works by Glazunov and other composers.Rimsky-Korsakov, 278. Rimsky-Korsakov's piano concerto was played, along with Glazunov's symphonic poem Stenka Razin.Rimsky-Korsakov, 278. Both the rehearsal the previous year and this concert gave Rimsky-Korsakov the idea of offering several concerts per year featuring Russian compositions.Rimsky- Korsakov, 279. The number of orchestral compositions was growing, and there were always difficulties in having the Russian Musical Society and other organizations program them.Rimsky-Korsakov, 279. Rimsky-Korsakov mentioned the idea to Belayev. Belayev liked it,Rimsky-Korsakov, 279. inaugurating the Russian Symphony Concerts during the 1886-1887 season.Rimsky-Korsakov, 279, 281. Rimsky-Korsakov shared conducting duties for these concerts.Rimsky- Korsakov, 279. In 1889 Belyayev engaged Rimsky-Korsakov to conduct two such concerts at the Paris Exposition. Rimsky-Korsakov recalled that although the performances, held at the Trocad√©ro on 22 and 29 June involving the Concerts Colonne orchestra, had gone well, the audiences had been meagre due to Belyayev's reluctance to advertise the concerts.Rimsky-Korsakov. My Musical Life: pp. 301-02 Nonetheless, the programmes of works by Glinka, Glazunov, Tchaikovsky and Lyadov, as well as works by \\"the mighty handful\\" made a profound impression on Maurice Ravel and Ricardo Vi√±es, who made a point of obtaining a piano duet arrangement of Rimsky-Korsakov's Antar Symphony. So started what was to be an important influence on Ravel's own work.Nichols, Roger. Ravel: pp. 10-11 Glazunov was appointed conductor for the series in 1896. The following year, he led the disastrous premiere of Rachmaninoff's Symphony No 1. While Glazunov's conducting skills were not especially strong and he used his rehearsal time poorly, his alcoholism may have contributed to the debacle.Norris, New Grove, 709. Works premiered Some of the works currently best known as \\"Russian music\\" were first presented at the Russian Symphony Concerts. Rimsky-Korsakov finished his revision of Modest Mussorgsky's Night on Bald Mountain and conducted it at the opening concert.Rimsky-Korsakov, 281. He also wrote Scheherazade, Capriccio espagnol and the Russian Easter Festival Overture specifically for them.Maes, 171. Revisions of earlier works were also featured. One concert included the first complete performance of the final version of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's First Symphony; another featured the premiere of the revised version of Rimsky- Korsakov's Third Symphony.Brown, Final Years, 91. Sergei Rachmaninoff's tone poem The Rock was premiered at a Russian Symphony Concert in 1896 under the direction of Glazunov; this was followed a year later by the premiere of Rachmaninoff's First Symphony, also under Glazunov.Harrison, 77.

Clark & McCullough performed together until McCullough's suicide in March 1936. In 1939 Clark appeared on Broadway in The Streets of Paris, sharing the stage with a new comedy act: Abbott & Costello. Clark appeared on television during the 1950‚Äì51 television season, in the 8‚Äì9 pm Sunday night time slot of The Colgate Comedy Hour; however, Clark's four episodes were among those sponsored by Frigidaire and titled simply The Comedy Hour. The Goldwyn Follies, his last and only film without Paul McCullough, in 1938, was the first Technicolor film produced by Samuel Goldwyn. The Clark & McCullough shorts were made for an adult audience, with Clark writing much of the dialogue. Like Wheeler & Woolsey‚Äôs films, they were not released for television, being considered too vulgar. So, they did not enjoy the renaissance of popularity with a new generation, on television, like The Three Stooges, or Laurel & Hardy. Bobby Clark with Leni Stengel, in Kickin' the Crown Around (1933) Stage work He appeared on Broadway in the Ziegfeld Follies of 1936. His reputation grew as he tackled roles in plays such as Sheridan's The Rivals, as well as in musical comedies and revues. Starting in 1942, producer Mike Todd cast him in five Broadway shows, all of them successful: the musical revue Star and Garter with Gypsy Rose Lee (1942‚Äì43); the Cole Porter musical Mexican Hayride (1944‚Äì45); Moli√®re‚Äôs The Would-Be Gentleman (1946); and the revues As the Girls Go (1948) and Michael Todd's Peep Show (1950). He came out of retirement to tour with Damn Yankees, 1956‚Äì58, in the role created on Broadway by Ray Walston. As well as his better-known stage and film credits, Clark directed and appeared in such Restoration comedy as Congreve's Love For Love, and lectured on this period of theatre at the American Theater Wing.https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0163714/bio Bobby Clark died in New York City in 1960.

General Register Office, London, England.Mrs Emily Alice Goldsmith Encyclopedia Titanica RMS Titanic Between 1908 and 1911, both of Emily's parents and six of her twelve brothers and sisters had emigrated to the United States, settling in Detroit, Michigan. In the wake of their youngest son's death, Frank's parents decided to emigrate and join Emily's relations in Detroit.1910, 1920 United States Federal Census Collection Goldsmith and his parents boarded the RMS Titanic in Southampton as third- class passengers, en route to New York City. His father, a tool maker, was bringing his bag of tools with him; these were stored in the ship's hold. Accompanying them were Thomas Theobald, Frank Sr.'s friend, and Alfred Rush, the son of a family friend. Rush commemorated his 16th birthday on 14 April on board the ship, celebrating his transformation from a boy to a man as he no longer had to wear shorts, but was now to wear long pants. The nine year old Goldsmith spent his time on board the ship playing with a group of English speaking third-class boys who were about his age: Willie Coutts, Harold Goodwin, William Johnston, Albert and George Rice, and James and Walter van Billiard. They climbed the baggage cranes and wandered down to the boiler rooms to watch the stokers and firemen at work. Of these boys, only Goldsmith and Coutts survived the sinking. When the ship struck the iceberg late in the evening of 14 April 1912, Frank Sr. woke Emily and Frank Jr. and, together with Theobald and Rush, they made their way to the forward end of the boat deck, where Collapsible C was being loaded. There was a ring of crewmen standing around it, letting only women and children pass through. Goldsmith wrote of the experience: \\"Mother and I then were permitted through the gateway, and the crewman in charge reached out to grasp the arm of Alfred Rush to pull him through because he must have felt that the young lad was not much older than me, and he was not very tall for his age, but Alfred had not been stalling. He jerked his arm out of the sailor's hand and with his head held high, said, and I quote, 'No! I'm staying here with the men.' At age 16, he died a hero.\\" Theobold gave Emily his wedding ring, asking if she would give it to his wife if he did not survive.\\"More About Frank J. Goldsmith\\" at Titanic Historical Society Goldsmith later recalled: \\"My dad reached down and patted me on the shoulder and said, 'So long, Frankie, I‚Äôll see you later.' He didn‚Äôt and he may have known he wouldn‚Äôt.\\" Goldsmith Sr., Theobald, and Rush all died in the sinking; of the three, only Theobald's body was recovered. The young Goldsmith and his mother were rescued by the in Collapsible C. As the Carpathia headed to New York City, in order to get Frank's mind off the sinking, Mrs. Goldsmith entrusted him into the care of a surviving Titanic fireman, Samuel Collins. While Mrs. Goldsmith was busy sewing clothes from blankets for women and children who had left the ship in only nightclothes, Frank accompanied Collins down to visit Carpathias stokers. They offered to make him an honorary seaman by having him drink a mixture of water, vinegar, and a whole raw egg. He proudly swallowed it in one go, and from then on, considered himself as a member of the ship's crew. Goldsmith remembered fireman Collins telling him, \\"Don‚Äôt cry, Frankie, your dad will probably be in New York before you are.\\" Later life After arriving in New York, Goldsmith and his mother were housed by the Salvation Army, which provided train fare to reach their relatives in Detroit. They moved to a home near the newly opened Navin Field, home of the Detroit Tigers. Every time the crowd cheered during a home run, the sound reminded him of the screams of the dying passengers and crew in the water just after the ship sank; as a result, he never took his children to baseball games.Note: Fellow RMS Titanic survivor Jack Thayer compared the sound to locusts, in his privately published memoir The Sinking of the S.S. Titanic (1940), and RMS Titanic survivor Eva Hart observed: \\"The sound of people drowning is something I cannot describe to you and neither can anyone else. It is the most dreadful sound and then there is dreadful silence that follows it.\\" Growing up, Goldsmith still held on to the hope of his father's survival. It took him months to understand that his father was really dead, and for years afterward, he used to tell himself, \\"I think another ship must have picked him up and one day he will come walking right through that door and say, 'Hello, Frankie.'\\" Goldsmith married Victoria Agnes (n√©e Lawrence) in 1926, and they had three sons: James, Charles, and Frank II.Book report on Frank Goldsmith and later life at Encyclopedia Titanica During World War II, Goldsmith served as a civilian photographer for the U.S. Army Air Corps. After the war, he brought his family to Ashland, Ohio and later opened a photography supply store in nearby Mansfield. Goldsmith's autobiography is entitled Echoes in the Night: Memories of a Titanic Survivor, and was published in 1991 by the Titanic Historical Society. Walter Lord wrote the foreword. Goldsmith's is the only book about the sinking written by a third- class passenger. Death Goldsmith died at his home in 1982, at age 79. Several months after his death, on 15 April, the anniversary of the sinking, his ashes were scattered over the North Atlantic, above the place where the Titanic rests.

Built from 1926 to 1927, the El Cortez was the tallest building in San Diego when it opened. It sits atop a hill at the north end of Downtown San Diego, where it dominated the city skyline for many years. From its opening in 1927 through the 1950s, it was the most glamorous apartment-hotel in San Diego. The large \\"El Cortez\\" sign, which is illuminated at night, was added in 1937 and could be seen for miles. In the 1950s, the world's first outside glass elevator was built at the El Cortez. During the late 1960s and 1970s, the El Cortez fell on harder times. The El Cortez closed as a hotel in 1978 when it was purchased by evangelist Morris Cerullo to serve as an evangelism school. Cerullo sold the property in 1981, and the El Cortez was threatened with demolition until the San Diego Historic Site Board designated it as a historic site in 1990. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2002. Many of the original elements remain in place, though substantial interior modifications have been made. The building is the 31st tallest building in San Diego, based on its height of 310 ft (94 m). Early history (1927-1949) =Construction and architecture= Construction of the El Cortez began in 1926 and was completed the next year at a cost of $2.5 million. The 14-story hotel was built by Richard T. Robinson, Jr., and designed by architects Albert R. Walker and Percy Eisen in a Spanish Churrigueresque style. The building utilizes the Spanish Colonial Revival architectural style. The hotel was built on the site of Ulysses S. Grant, Jr.'s home, 175 feet (53 m) above sea level. The building is named for the Spanish conquistador Hern√°n Cort√©s. El Cortez Hotel opened on Thanksgiving Day on November 26, 1927. A crowd of 50,000 people were present at the opening--a third of the San Diego population. When the building was first opened, it had 117 rooms, 85 of these used for apartments, and 32 for hotel rooms. At the time of the opening, the Los Angeles Times reported: > \\"The building is Spanish Renaissance in design. In keeping with the > architecture, approach to the building is made through a Spanish garden of > flowers, cool green lawns and fountains. Just above the entrance is an open- > air garden retreat.\\" More than sixty years later, the Times noted that the El Cortez's \\"graceful proportions and unique layout, with angular side wings embracing the main entrance, make it especially inviting.\\" The hotel's main ballroom, the Don Room, was known as one of the most beautiful rooms in the city with an ornately carved sandalwood ceiling supported by large pillars, and an inlaid maple floor. The 200-seat Aztec Dining Room also reflected the hotel's opulence. Critics dubbed it \\"the outstanding eating rendezvous of the community ... because of its vast windows, brilliant ceiling and handsome equipment.\\" The art deco style Sky Room, added in 1940, became renowned for its glass walls and 360-degree view of the city. At a height of 310 feet (94 m), penthouse guests could see up to 30 miles (48 km) away. The top of the building includes a red neon sign with the words \\"El Cortez\\", which was first added in 1937. The sign was expanded in 1951 and restored in 1999. Each letter is 12 feet (3.6 m) high. For 36 years, the El Cortez was San Diego's tallest building, and its exterior glass elevator, Travolator, and Starlight restaurant made it a San Diego landmark. =World War II= On December 8, 1941, the day after the attack on Pearl Harbor, an anti-aircraft battery and radar station were installed on the El Cortez roof. The anti-aircraft battery remained atop El Cortez for the duration of the war. One of the soldiers who manned the battery later recalled: > \\"Since I was the search light battery commander, I would observe the action > of the search lights at night. So some times I had to go on the roof of the > El Cortez and there was no way of getting up there except through this bar > that was on top. It was a beautiful bar. [To] the people sitting at the > table, I had to 'excuse me' and there I am in my uniform stepping on their > table and getting out the window, walking up the fire escape to the top of > the El Cortez to look at the mission.\\"Interview with Herman Silversher by > Susan Painter, 24 May 1990, San Diego Historical Society, Oral History > Program Handlery years (1950-1978) =Harry Handlery= In 1951, hotelier Harry Handlery purchased the El Cortez from the El Cortez Company for $1.5 million. Handlery reportedly fell in love with the hotel and made it his permanent residence. Handlery made numerous changes both to the interior and exterior in his effort to make it \\"the finest hotel on the Pacific Coast,\\" promising that \\"the hammers will never be still as long as I own the Cortez.\\" To attract visitors, Handlery added a swimming pool in 1952, the Caribbean wing (an eight-story addition with a grand ballroom) in 1954, the Starlight Room (located on the twelfth floor and known for its views and chic experience) in 1956, an exterior glass elevator, and a motel and moving sidewalk known as the Travolator in 1959. =Glass elevator and Travolator= Handlery's most remembered changes were the addition of the world's first outside hydraulic glass elevator and the first moving sidewalk in the 1950s. The outdoor glass elevator, reportedly a bellboy's idea, was \\"the world's first in 1956.\\" Known as the \\"Starlight Express,\\" the elevator brought visitors to the hotel's dining facilities with views of the city. The design of the El Cortez's outside glass elevator was later copied by the Fairmont Hotel in San Francisco and The Ilikai in Hawaii. Some considered the glass elevator to be one of Handlery's novelties, but it served as an attraction to draw visitors back to the downtown hotel. In 1989, a controversy arose when the owner, San Diego hotelier Mark Grosvenor, proposed a renovation plan that omitted the glass elevator. Grosvenor announced plans to remove some of the non-original elements, including the glass elevator and rooftop sign and neon stars, leading to a split among preservationists. Grosvenor was concerned about structural problems with the elevator and the unavailability of spare parts. Some preservationists approved of Grosvenor's plan, opining that Handerly's additions were \\"fifties kitsch\\" that detracted from the original Spanish architecture. Others regarded the elevator as a key element in the hotel's historic significance. One member of the local historic site board noted, \\"It was the elevator that made a night at the El Cortez so thrilling. Any restoration that doesn't include the elevator is incomplete.\\" The federal government ultimately endorsed proposals to remove the 1950s alterations and restore the original appearance. Handerly also built the Travolator bridge in 1959 to connect the El Cortez with his new motel across the street. Designed by architect Clarence J. Paderewski for the Otis Elevator Company, the Travolator was essentially a flat escalator. The same design was later used at airports in London, Atlanta and Los Angeles. Some objected to the Travolator's garish orange exterior, but in its early years, San Diego's elite used the moving walkway to attend events at the El Cortez. The Travolator ceased operating in 1981 and San Diego's homeless started sleeping on the bridge. In 1986, the owners sold the motel for $4.5 million, and there was no longer a need for a connecting bridge between the two properties. Accordingly, the Travolator bridge was demolished in June 1986. =Paul Handlery= In 1965, Harry Handlery died of a heart attack. His younger son, Paul Handlery, took over management of the hotel. Some contend that the transition from father to son signaled the decline of the El Cortez as a center of the downtown social world. Harry Handlery had frequently made rounds throughout the hotel checking on every detail of service and quality. Some employees complained that Paul Handlery did not spend enough money for renovations and repairs on the hotel. =Pueblo incident= During the 1968 Pueblo incident, family members of the Pueblo crew were put up at El Cortez. Cerullo's evangelism center (1978-1981) In 1978, Paul Handlery sold the El Cortez to evangelist and faith healer Morris Cerullo for $7.5 million. Cerullo converted the hotel into a school of evangelism and a headquarters for Morris Cerullo World Evangelism, Inc. Cerullo sponsored an hour-long television special to raise money to purchase the El Cortez. Facing the prospect of layoffs if the acquisition went through, a veteran front desk clerk who watched Cerullo's television special offered these comments: \\"The second time he (Cerullo) said the Lord spoke to him and told him to buy 'that beautiful old hotel,' the lord spoke to me too. And the Lord told me to turn that guy off. So I switched the channel.\\" Upon taking over the hotel, Cerullo reportedly spent $4 million to convert the hotel into his evangelism center. The work included gutting the major meeting rooms, including the International Room, Cotillion Room, Starlight Room, Caribbean Room and kitchen. The living quarters were converted into dormitory- style accommodations, and the hotel's luxury furnishings were sold. During the time he owned the building, Cerullo became involved in several disputes with contractors, students, real estate brokers and labor unions. He was also criticized for installing individual air conditioning units that altered the hotel's exterior and ripping out the ornate interiors to accommodate cafeterias rather than fine dining. In the end, Cerullo needed only half of the hotel's 550 rooms to house students of his three-month $1,400 evangelism school. The balance of the rooms were kept open for public use. Cerullo also made an attempt at reopening the Don Room, without liquor, but it was closed after a short time. In early 1981, after a little more than two years after acquiring the El Cortez, Cerullo put the hotel back on the market for $20.8 million. The building was resold again several times to various owners in the 1980s and 1990s. Later years =Considine years and convention center proposal= El Cortez Associates, led by Denver developer Terry Considine, bought the property and proposed the site in 1983 as a location for the planned San Diego Convention Center. However, the city ultimately chose to build the convention center on the bayfront. After the convention center plan was rejected, proposals were made to restore the El Cortez using funds from city-backed bonds or with the help of historic preservation tax credits. Those proposals were not executed, and Considine put the property on the market in 1986. At the time, the hotel's furnishings had been stripped and auctioned by Cerullo, and the El Cortez's 250 guest rooms were empty. Considine subsequently sold the landmark to the Grosvenor family. In 1984 and 1985 a community theater, Tom Rusch Productions, operated out of the Don Room. Productions included Godspell and Pirates of Penzance. =Preservation efforts= After a decade of decline, the Los Angeles Times reported in 1989 as follows: > \\"Once the crown jewel of downtown San Diego, the 61-year-old El Cortez Hotel > has been mostly empty and off-limits to the public for nearly a decade.

Grosvenor remained involved as the developer and announced plans to renovate the El Cortez as the centerpiece of a $250-million project that would include four new mixed-use towers, 362 residential units and 400 hotels rooms. However, in 1990, Minami lost interest in the ambitious project and announced that it was instead considering demolishing the hotel. Preservationists stepped in and succeeded in having the El Cortez declared a San Diego historic site in 1990. In the late 1990s, the new owners embraced the building's historic designation and successfully had it listed on the National Register of Historic Places in order to qualify for renovation tax credits. =Redevelopment into condominiums= By the late 1990s, the El Cortez had become an eyesore. In 1999, developers Peter Janopaul and Anthony Block obtained a loan from San Diego's redevelopment agency to renovate the building, including restoration of some historic elements. Initially, the developers leased the restored units as luxury apartments, but in 2004, they converted the building to condominiums. They divided the building into 85 residential condominium units along with commercial and office space, and the restored Don Room. By 2007, maintenance problems, including bursting pipes and backed-up plumbing, and declining values resulted in contentious litigation between the condominium homeowners and the developers. Several units were repossessed by lenders and were listed at prices less than half their original purchase prices. The homeowners sought $13 million in damages for construction defects, underfunding of the homeowners association reserves, and the developers‚Äô plans to build another tower next door. =Intellectual property= In order to protect the name and image of the El Cortez, the El Cortez Owners Association obtained the federal trademark rights to the El Cortez name and image from the United States Patent and Trademark Office under registration number 3422531. They also obtained the same state protection from the Secretary of State of California under registration number 64167. Impact Various guests who have visited the hotel include U.S. Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower, Lyndon B. Johnson, and Gerald Ford, and singers Bing Crosby, Elvis Presley, and Roy Rogers, actress Jane Wyatt and bandleader Skitch Henderson. The hotel was featured in the 1963 film A Ticklish Affair. On July 25, 1990, the City of San Diego's Historic Site Board declared the building to be \\"historic\\", which prevented it from being demolished. As a result of the designation, the building's interior was refurbished for modern apartments. El Cortez Hotel was eventually added to the National Register of Historic Places on January 17, 2002 for its impact on architecture and engineering.

He won the bronze medal in the 1994 World Boxing Championship in Bangkok. He was the second Indian to win a medal at the Boxing World Cup after Pu Zoramthanga (boxer), from Mizoram. He is from Chennai, India. He was awarded the Arjuna Award in 1995. He competed in the men's bantamweight event at the 1992 Summer Olympics. V. Devarajan has been a fighter on and off the boxing ring. He broke new ground by becoming the first Indian to win a World Cup medal on foreign soil in 1994. Deva valiantly fought for his rights until recently with his employers, Southern Railway, after being \\"denied a due promotion.\\" That his prolonged battle with Railways didn't have a happy ending is another matter. Fighting well is the credo of sportsmen and Deva has given his all in his bouts against his opponents and employers. Boxing is a family sport for Deva. Inspired by his father Venkatesan's unflinching support, Deva scaled heights few Indian boxers had before Vijender Singh. His brothers, Harikrishnan and Baskaran, also achieved prominence in boxing. When Deva won a bronze medal in the featherweight category at the 1994 World Cup in Bangkok, what struck many was his baby-face. It was radically different from the face of a boxer. It had a rare innocence. Deva was only 20 years old that time. But he had maturity beyond his age. Upon his arrival in New Delhi from Bangkok, Deva spoke like a real champion. \\"I was eager to perform. There was no point in saying that I too took part in the World Championship, the Olympics and the World Cup without having done anything worth remembering,\\" he had said. A win over Thailand's Kamsing Somluck in front of a baying home crowd was the highlight of Deva's memorable Cup performance. At the peak of his career, the Chennai boxer, who was adjudged the best of Indian Railways in 1995, had beaten top stars from almost all the big boxing nations. One of his scalps, Mongolian Lkhagva Dugarbaaatar, went on to become a professional champion in 1999. Only an unfortunate first-round pairing with a Cuban champion spoiled his Olympic hopes in Barcelona 1992. Deva had chances to qualify for the next Olympics but his heart was after professional boxing at that time. Sports administrators keep a distance from the stars of their disciplines in this country, but the late IABF president Aspy Adajania made his liking for Deva public. Adajania always held the boxer in high esteem. He even had Deva as his personal guest in Bombay after the Chenna star's Bangkok success. Deva's heart beats for sports in general and boxing in particular. When a newspaper published an article a couple of years ago that the Tamil Nadu government had been delaying cash incentives for state sports achievers, the Olympian was the first to react. He poured his heart out against the inordinate delay. \\"A help in need is a help indeed,\\" he had said at that time. From his personal experience, Deva knew the importance of timely help. That is why he was ready to stick his neck out and seek immediate government action. When the TN government moved to right the wrong, the Olympian was overjoyed. He felt so happy as if he was one among the beneficiaries. Deva hasn't forgotten the odds he had overcome to become a world-class pugilist. Taking boxing away from Deva's system will mean sucking the life out of the man. The plight of young boxers continues to strike a chord with him. Rain or shine Deva is out there at the Nehru Stadium every evening to train youngsters who would otherwise be struggling to learn the lessons of boxing. The big-hearted Arjuna awardee doesn't charge a penny from his charges. He knows well that boxing is a working-class sport. More importantly, Deva is not out there to make money. His love for boxing is deep. He gives his all for its promotion. From talking up his trainee G. Senthilnathan to rejoicing at Vijender Singh's success at the 2008 Olympics and the 2009 World Championship, Deva's passion for the punching game shines through. The tech-savvy boxing coach was among the Arjuna award selectors in 2009. He floats like a butter fly in the ring. This is a fact, but does he sting like a bee? All those who have watched venkatesan devarajan in national and international level competitions will unanimously say 'No'. Hard punching has never been devarajan's cup of tea who wants it anyway as the computer scoring has revolutionized the amateur boxing on such a scale knock out punchers are no longer needed to win b outs these days. The unassuming lanky boy from a middle-class family has been a phenomenal success in Indian amateur boxing history from a club level pugilist he has risen to the level of qualifying for the Olympics and winning the world cup Bronze medal at Bangkok at 1994. It is not that he has been the first boxer from Tamil Nadu to bring glory to the country. The state has been in the vanguard of producing out standing men with ring craft from the British days. Even if one ignores the professional part of the state boxing which has more shady side out of it there has been a strong tradition from this piece of land Olympian munusamy venu, amalraj, Xavier and many more on the Asian level have taken this country to greater glory from the 70s. Of course most of them went through the services. However, Devarajan's route to the success has been different. He did not have to be the services pugilist to achieve laurels in a short span of five years. Even in the early days of his boxing career he had class. He held the attention of the spectators with his beautiful foot work. But his punching was eratile. He was hurling more wild ones. Of course he was physically not strong because of his pencil thin body. Later it was the railway coach devan who had to put him through weight training to strengthen his arms for punches. Before joining the railways, he gave Tamil Nadu its first gold medal in the national championship in 40 years. Since then he has been winning the gold medal at National championships almost every time. His career took an upswing from 1991 onwards. He was the lone boxer to win the gold medal in Asian qualifying round for the Barcelona Olympic. He was one of the five Indian pugilists who qualified for the games in 1992. He was so good during his training in Cuba and at the Asian level competitions that the then iabf president late aspy adajanin expected that if at all there was a medal for India in the Olympics in boxing it could be from devarajan. He aired this view to media also. Unfortunately, Devarajan ran into a Cuban in the very first round and last round points but two years later he had a commanders success in the world cup he faced tougher opponents. Coach devan attributes this success to the Cuban blas fermandezs who did wonders for devarajan in his three years coaching stint. What ever may be the Cubans qualities he has made devarajan a very sharp puncher, cutting down all his erratic swing, set the railway coach may be this is the reason for his phenomenal success. When he won the world cup bronze medal in feather weight, adajania, who was so elated, took him to Bombay as his personal guest for a couple days. Devarajan gets emotional even today, for it had been an unforgettable experience for him. Devarajan has certainly showed the Indian pugilist that world level medals are not beyond their reach. This itself is a great achievement for this Tamil Nadu boxer who has had his fathers strong backing form the beginning. Deva indeed deserves bigger honours. He was also adjudged the \\"Best of Indian Railways\\" in 1995.

In film Camille is a Bolivian national. She first meets Bond (Daniel Craig) in Haiti, where she intends to kill General Medrano (Joaquin Cosio), who murdered her entire family when she was a child. She sleeps with Quantum member Dominic Greene (Mathieu Amalric) to get to Medrano, but Greene soon grows suspicious of her and plans to kill her. Camille arranges a meeting with a geologist selling classified information that is detrimental to Greene's business. However, Greene has already hired assassin Edmund Slate (Neil Jackson) to pose as the geologist (whom Camille has not met in person) and kill Camille. Bond intercepts and kills Slate and takes his suitcase without knowing the contents. Camille spots Bond on the street with the suitcase and believes he is the geologist. Bond opens the suitcase and unwittingly reveals Slate's gun and documents that show Camille as a target. Believing Bond has come to kill her, Camille attempts to shoot him before fleeing. She returns to Greene, intent on being introduced to Medrano, formerly head of the Bolivian Army. When Greene betrays Camille, Bond rescues her, and they team up to go after Greene and Medrano. Bond leaves Camille for a short period of time after she is knocked unconscious during a boat chase in Haiti to follow Greene to Austria, tracking him to a performance of Tosca. Camille soon appears at Greene's formal fundraising party to ruin it. Greene attempts to push her from a balcony but, once again, Bond saves her life. Bond intervenes and takes her away from Greene, using MI6 Agent Strawberry Fields (Gemma Arterton) as a distraction, to prevent Greene's associate from following Bond and Camille as they leave the party; this costs Fields her life. Camille watches Bond as he kills Bolivian police officers in cold blood as revenge for murdering his ally Rene Mathis (Giancarlo Giannini). Camille and Bond trace Greene and Medrano to a desert eco-hotel. While Bond goes to fight Greene and his men, Camille faces Medrano, who attempts to rape and kill her. Camille gets the upper hand, however, and kills the dictator with a single shot to the head. As the hotel collapses around them, Bond shields Camille from the fire, and helps her escape. Bond leaves Greene in the middle of the desert and drives Camille to a train station so she can go back to her home. The two share a quick kiss, and Camille wishes Bond luck in conquering his personal demons. Behind the scenes Barbara Broccoli said that she intended for Camille to return for Skyfall or a future film. The character did not appear in Skyfall, however, or the subsequent Bond film, Spectre.

Listed at 5' 11\\", 180 lb., he batted and threw right handed. Born in The Bronx, New York, Zanni was signed by his home team New York Giants as an amateur free agent before the 1951 season. Over the following seasons, Zanni moved up the minor league baseball ranks. On June 5, 1954, Zanni pitched a no-hitter for the Sioux City Cowboys of the Western League. In 1956, Zanni was a spring training roster invitee, but was sent back to the minors before the season started. He spent the following seasons with the Louisville Colonels and the Phoenix Giants, and helped lead the Giants to the Pacific Coast League championship in 1958. This led to his Major League debut on September 28. He faced the St. Louis Cardinals, pitching four innings and allowing one run, earning the victory as the Giants won 7‚Äì2. Zanni spent the offseason in the Dominican League, then was back on the Giants' roster for the 1959 season. During the season, he pitched in 11 innings in nine games, striking out 11. After playing nine games and having an earned run average (ERA) of 6.55, he was sent back to Phoenix. Zanni spent the rest of the 1959 and 1960 seasons with the Tacoma Giants (formerly the Phoenix Giants), then spent the 1960 offseason in the Puerto Rican League, earning an ERA of 2.73 with six victories and no losses. After spending part of the 1961 season with Tacoma, where Zanni had a 2.65 ERA and an 8-4 record, he was called up to the San Francisco Giants' Major League roster on July 22, 1961. He went on to pitch eight games during the 1961 San Francisco Giants season, winning a game and posting an ERA of 3.75. After the season ended, on November 30 Zanni was traded along with player to be named later (Verle Tiefenthaler), Bob Farley, and Eddie Fisher to the Chicago White Sox for Billy Pierce and Don Larsen. The 1962 Chicago White Sox season ended up being Zanni's most productive season in his Major League career. He pitched a career-high 44 games over 86 innings, winning six games and losing five with an ERA of 3.75. This season was also the closest Zanni got to pitching a complete game. On June 22, 1962, in a game against the Kansas City Athletics, Zanni relieved Joe Horlen, who left the game due to injury before getting anyone out. In the seventh inning of the same game, he was knocked unconscious in a collision while covering first base, and went on to finish the game, pitching all nine innings in a 5-1 victory for the White Sox. He pitched in five games for the White Sox the following season. On May 5, 1963, he was traded to the Cincinnati Reds for Jim Brosnan. Zanni played 31 games with the Reds in its 1963 season, finishing 16 of them and earning five saves and finishing with an ERA of 4.19. During the 1965 season, called up after the minor league season was over, he pitched in eight games and had 13 innings pitched, allowing two earned runs. The following season, he was again called up in September, and did not allow a run during the five games he pitched. His final Major League game was October 1, 1966.

Stevenson High School in Lincolnshire, Illinois. This district's kindergarten center is known as Willow Grove Early Learning Center which, as its name suggests, serves kindergarteners and early childhood students. Ivy Hall Elementary School educates those in and within grades one and five; Prairie Elementary School and Country Meadows Elementary School do exactly the same. Kildeer Countryside Elementary School, the largest of the schools in terms of the student body, also serves all grades between one and five. Woodlawn Middle School and Twin Groves Middle School provide the next level of education, serving grades 6-8.

In March 2007, five District 96 schools were elected by the Chicago Sun-Times as five of fifty of the best suburban schools in Chicago metropolitan area: Ivy Hall Elementary School, Prairie Elementary School, Kildeer Countryside Elementary School, Twin Groves Middle School, and Woodlawn Middle School. The former three listed were chosen as some of the fifteen best public schools in the county by Chicago Magazine in October 2006. In October 2007, Twin Groves was also certified as an official Blue Ribbon school. Woodlawn Middle School, in the 2009- 2010 school year, also got a Blue Ribbon Award.Overview of District 96, retrieved 2008-5-9 Also, during the 2012-2013 school year, Kildeer Countryside Elementary School received a Blue Ribbon award., retrieved 2013-12-19 History The district was formed in the wake of World War II in 1946. Four one-room schoolhouses in the then-rural southern Lake County area that initially served as independent districts were consolidated into one. Up to 1999, students in District 96 attended one of three elementary schools, Prairie, Kildeer, or Willow Grove, before graduating and converging into Ivy Hall Middle School (5-6) and Twin Groves Junior High (7-8) for their last four years in the district. At this time, however, the school district worked to expand its capacity and therefore constructed the newer Woodlawn Middle School, as well as the Country Meadows Elementary School. A reorganization effort also designated another structure as part of the district to educate kindergarteners; this separate building is now known as Willow Grove Early Learning Center. Since 1993, four school referendums have been passed; three pertain to the money that fueled the construction and additions of the Woodlawn, Country Meadows, and Willow Grove facilities, while the other referendum involved a separate fund to improve the schools already in the district. This referendum, alongside contributions by school-localized Parent-Teacher Organizations, have made possible a purchase of new learning apparatus that can be utilized for the students' benefit. The Schools Currently Of the schools now, they consist of one Kindergarten & Early Childhood Center, Willow Grove, four 1-5 Elementary Schools and two 6-8 Middle Schools. Ivy Hall and Prairie are K-5 schools that converge into Twin Groves now 6-8, as they are located in Buffalo Grove, and Kildeer Countryside and Country Meadows are K-5 schools that converge into Woodlawn Middle School 6-8, as they are all located in Long Grove.

He was awarded the Karnataka Sahitya Academy Award (1993) and the Sahitya Akademi Award in Kannada language for the play in 1994, and later awarded the Jnanpith Award for his literature work in 1998.  About the play  Written in 1990 in the backdrop of mandir- mandal conflict, the drama draws parallel between the Socio-Religious Political and Economic condition of existing times and southern India in the 12th century A.D. during Bhakti Movement. Eight hundred years ago in the city of Kalyan a man called Basavanna assembled a congregation of poets, mystics, social revolutionaries and philosophers, unmatched for their creativity and social commitment in the history of Karnataka, even perhaps of India itself. They opposed idolatry, rejected temple worship, upheld equality of sexes, and condemned the caste system. Basavanna was leading the movement to remove gender inequality and caste system. But the event took a violent turn when they acted on their beliefs and a Brahmin girl married a cobbler's son, so called a 'low caste' boy. The movement ended in bloodshed so does the hopes of Basavanna died in despair. People too forgot the movement. Rakt Kalyan (Tale- Danda) deals with few weeks during which a vibrant, prosperous society plunged into anarchy and terror. In Hindi it is known as Rakt-Kalyan translated by Ram Gopal Bajaj, first directed by Ebrahim Alkazi for National School of Drama and remarkable production by Arvind Gaur (1995-2008, still running) for Asmita Theater Telugu translation of the play, by Bhargavi Rao won her the Sahitya Akademi Award Translation Award in 1995, given by Sahitya Akademi, India's National Academy of Letters.  Press criticism  V M Badola (The Pioneer) *Among the best things that happened to the Indian theatre in the recent times is the creation of Kannada play Taledanda, Rakt Kalyan, by Girish Karnad. Arvind Gaur, the director knew the strength of the play lay in its excellent script and an equally brilliant translation, of it, into Hindi by Ram Gopal Bajaj.Arvind Gaur's main achievement was his deep understanding of the nuances of the play and his impeccable sense of choreography, which was well effected, especially during the crowd scenes .What is more, he used the basement space very imaginatively.Rakt- Kalyan (Taledanda) owes its greatness to the fact that it does not unnecessarily attempt to politicize the issue and for good reasons. Although any attempt to bring about social reformation does inevitably throw up certain political challenges it is the existing socio- religious turmoil that creates the biggest impediment and the irony is that in such circumstances, the inherent Contradictions within a social structure come into the play. Emotion supersedes reason which consequently hurts the cause.Watching Asmita's Rakt Kalyan, became apparent that lack of resources need not come in the way of good presentation, given the dedication and commitment of the actors and the director Romesh chander(The Hindu) *Girish Karnad's Rakt Kalyan (Taledanda)is a superb play, which well illustrates how man has not learnt from history... it is remarkable for Gaur's handling of large crowd scenes...and for underlining the relevance of the play set in 12th century in south India to the present day socio-political atmosphere in the country...like asmita's earlier productions Rakt Kalyan is mounted on a bare stage without The frills of period costumes with emphasis on the socio- political relevance of the play and in this production succeeds admirably Javed Malik (Times of India) *Play is a complex and incisive investigation of an actual historical experiment in social reordering and its tragic failure on the individual as well as the collective level ...Asmita's Rakt Kalyan endeavors to foreground the play's political implications particularly in relation to caste.interesting piece of theatre‚Ä¶it is remarkable for director Arvind Gaur's skillful handling of the large cast in terms of blocking and movement. Kavita Nagpal (Hindustan Times) *Girish wrote the play in 1989 when the mandir and masjid movements were beginning to show how relevant the questions posed in the 12th century are Today. The anger of society, unwilling to abandon the safety net of the caste system, turns to frenzy when a Brahmin sharana girl is married to a chamar sharana boy. They are lynched and kalyan is rift with war cries...Arvind Gaur repeated his Tughlaq technique. Bare sets, symbolic costumes, letting words and characters hold the reins of dramatic power. Bright scenes of lucid argument. House was packed and very responsive.  Trivia  #Manu Rishi(Filmfare Best Dialogue Award), Deepak Dobriyal, Shilpa Shukla, Seema Azmi, Shalini Vatsa acted in this play with Arvind Gaur.

It is composed of songs written by Gil from the late 1960s to the 1990s.Mann, Tracy (2006). In Gil Luminoso [Liner notes format]. United States: DRG Records Incorporated. Conception and themes The idea for the album was conceived of by Ben√© Fonteles, the album's producer and the author of a book about Gil. It was released with the book, entitled GiLuminoso: a po.√©tica do ser, in 1999. Fonteles intended for the album to be heavily influenced by spirituality and mysticism and Gil calls it \\"very religious\\", though he is an agnostic. Compositions \\"Preciso aprender a s√≥ ser\\" (\\"I have to learn how to just be\\") borrows its lyrics and theme from another song titled \\"I have to learn how to be alone\\". Gil says that a specific line in the song, \\"It's just me with this pain in my chest/Collapsing in tears that I try to hide\\", is an interpretation of suffering in human life. Julie McCarthy, a critic for National Public Radio, called this \\"an existential theme\\" which is often present in his lyrics. Another song featured on the album, \\"Copo vazio\\" (\\"Empty glass\\"), was written by Gil for famous Brazilian musician Chico Buarque. Gil composed the song \\"C√©rebro eletr√¥nico\\" (\\"Electronic brain\\") during his imprisonment by the Brazilian military government in 1969. Reception The album reached number 15 on the Billboard Top World Albums chart for one week and was nominated for the 2008 Grammy Award for Best Contemporary World Music Album. Gil promoted the album with a 2007 tour of North America which included a performance at Carnegie Hall. Jon Pareles of The New York Times described Gil Luminoso as \\"a lovely album\\", writing in particular on the philosophical qualities of its lyrics. Washington Post critic Mike Joyce noted that the album's lyrics \\"are often as thoughtful as they are poetic\\" and praised its arrangements as well, calling them \\"alluring and revealing\\".

Immediately following the event, blood flow and therefore oxygen transport is reduced locally, leading to hypoxia of the cells near the location of the original insult. This can lead to hypoxic cell death (infarction) and amplify the original damage from the ischemia; however, the penumbra area may remain viable for several hours after an ischemic event due to the collateral arteries that supply the penumbral zone. As time elapses after the onset of stroke, the extent of the penumbra tends to decrease; therefore, in the emergency department a major concern is to protect the penumbra by increasing oxygen transport and delivery to cells in the danger zone, thereby limiting cell death. The existence of a penumbra implies that salvage of the cells is possible. There is a high correlation between the extent of spontaneous neurological recovery and the volume of penumbra that escapes infarction; therefore, saving the penumbra should improve the clinical outcome. Definition One widely accepted definition for penumbra describes the area as \\"ischemic tissue potentially destined for infarction but it isn't irreversibly injured and the target of any acute therapies.\\" The original definition of the penumbra referred to areas of the brain that were damaged but not yet dead, and offered promise to rescue the brain tissue with the appropriate therapies. Blood flow The penumbra region typically occurs when blood flow drops below 20 mL/100 g/min. At this point electrical communication between neurons fails to exist. Cells in this region are alive but metabolic pumps are inhibited, oxidative metabolism is reduced but neurons may begin to depolarize again. Areas of the brain generally do not become infarcted until blood flow to the region drops below 10 to 12 mL/100 g/min. At this point, glutamate release becomes unregulated, ion pumps are inhibited and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis also stops which ultimately leads to the disruption of intracellular processes and neuronal death. Identification by imaging Positron emission tomography (PET) can quantify the size of the penumbra, but is neither widely available nor rapidly accessible. Magnetic resonance imaging can estimate the size of the penumbra with a combination of two MRI sequences: *Perfusion weighted imaging (PWI) shows decreased blood perfusion in the infarcted core and the penumbra *Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) can estimate the size of the infarcted core. Both of these sequences somewhat overestimates their volumes of interest, but the size of the penumbra can roughly be estimated by subtracting abnormal volume by DWI from abnormal volume by PWI. The penumbral area can also be detected based upon an integration of three factors. These factors include: the site of vessel occlusion, the extent of oligaemia (hypoperfused area surrounding the penumbra, but not at risk of infarction ) at that moment, and the mismatch between this perfusion defect and the area of the brain already infarcted. Clinical relevance A higher volume of penumbra around a cerebral infarction means a greater volume of potentially salvageable brain matter by thrombolysis and thrombectomy. Such therapies have a greater effect on regaining functions such as movement after a cerebral infarction. In the penumbra, microglia are thought to exert neuroprotective effects via specialized contacts with neuronal somata, termed somatic junctions. Understanding and supporting these microglial actions could broaden the therapeutic window and lead to higher amount of preserved nervous tissue. History The first decade of research focused on physiologic profile of the penumbra tissue after stroke, mapping the cerebral blood flow, and quantifying oxygen and glucose consumption to define these areas. The second decade revealed the mechanism of the neuronal cell death. As the Biochemical pathways were dissected penumbral science became a rapidly evolving area of molecular biology. The third decade of penumbral research found a transitional leap as using positron emission tomography (PET) scanning can identify brain tissue with decreased blood flow and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has the ability to detect portions of the ischemic tissue that has not yet died. These images have allowed vision into the brain to see the areas of tissue that may be salvaged, the penumbra.

The game follows the main character, Laika, through a mission to Mars which forces the player to manipulate Laika's multiple-personality disorder in order to solve puzzles. All the characters in the game have dog heads, a possible reference to the Soviet space dog Laika. The game was only released in Japan. Gameplay A major theme of the game is Laika's different personalities, embodied by three different characters, Ernest, Yolanda, and Spacer. By talking to different characters, Laika absorbs their different colored auras and when a specific color has been absorbed enough, Laika can turn into that personality to solve a problem, such as needing Ernest, the strongest, to lift a heavy shutter. Unlike most RPGs, which feature turn-based battles, Planet Laika's are played out almost like Space Invaders and Pong. The player must bounce around a Mind Core and reflect back the enemies' attacks to inflict damage. There are not a lot of battles in the game and enemies only attack when Laika is in one of the special forms. Development Planet Laika was co-developed by Japanese software developers Quintet (famous for ActRaiser, Illusion of Gaia, and Terranigma) and Zeque, a relatively unknown developer in North America, but known in Japan for the PlayStation cult hit Kowloon's Gate. Zeque was responsible for the concept, design, scenario, and graphics, whereas Quintet handled the programming and sound.

Since 1997 Manski has been Board of Trustees Professor in Economics at Northwestern University. Manski has served as a member of the National Research Council's (NRC) Committee on National Statistics (1996‚Äì2000), and the Commission on Behavioral and Social Sciences and Education (1992‚Äì98). At the NRC, he has been Chair of the Committee on Data and Research for Policy on Illegal Drugs (1998‚Äì2001) and a member of the Board on Mathematical Sciences and their Applications (2004‚Äì2007) and the Committee on Law and Justice (2009‚Äì). Manski is an elected fellow of the Econometric Society, The American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. In 2009, Manski was elected to the National Academy of Sciences; he is one of 2 economists elected to the body in 2009 and one of about 60 economists elected up to that point.\\"Charles Manski Elected to National Academy of Sciences\\" April 29, 2009 In 2014 he was elected a Corresponding Fellow of the British Academy. = War on Drugs = Manski served on the NRC's Committee on Data and Research for Policy on Illegal Drugs, which studied the war on drugs. The committee report found that existing studies on efforts to address drug usage and smuggling, from US military operations to eradicate coca fields in Colombia, to domestic drug treatment centers, have all been inconclusive, if the programs have been evaluated at all: \\"The existing drug-use monitoring systems are strikingly inadequate to support the full range of policy decisions that the nation must make.... It is unconscionable for this country to continue to carry out a public policy of this magnitude and cost without any way of knowing whether and to what extent it is having the desired effect.\\", Drug Policy Education Group, Vol. 2 No.1, Spring/Summer 2001, p.5 The study was mentioned by the press but was initially ignored by policymakers, leading Manski to conclude, as one observer noted, that \\"the drug war has no interest in its own results.\\"\\"Weekly News in Review\\", DrugSense Weekly, August 31, 2001 #215 Research Manski's work in econometrics includes the development of tools for partial identification, and the development of the maximum score estimator for discrete choice models. As of 2007, Manski's research interests focus primarily on the field of formation of social policy with partial knowledge of treatment response. Economists and doctors alike share a common interest in gauging the effect of various \\"treatments\\" delivered to \\"patients.\\" Since research on treatment response rarely provides sufficient information to determine effectiveness, how should the available evidence be employed in choosing future treatments?C.

It passes two Metro Rail stations, North Hollywood and Universal City/Studio City, both served by the B Line, and the former station is also served by the G Line. History Pacific Electric station at Lankershim and Chandler, 1919 Named for one of the area's founding families, Lankershim Boulevard is one of the oldest streets in the area surrounding what is now the neighborhood of North Hollywood. It was a major thoroughfare for the town of Toluca (which was itself renamed \\"Lankershim\\" in 1896), connecting it to Los Angeles by way of the Cahuenga Pass. In the center of Toluca, it crossed the Southern Pacific Railroad, with a depot near the current location of the North Hollywood Metro Station at Chandler Boulevard. The foundations of the original Campo de Cahuenga adobe were unearthed beneath Lankershim Boulevard during construction of the Metro Red Line subway. These parts of the foundations within the park are preserved as an exhibit, and the \\"footprint\\" of the foundations under the street and sidewalk is marked by decorative pavement. Lankershim Boulevard around Magnolia Boulevard was the heart of the town of Lankershim and of North Hollywood and until the mid-1950s boasted the largest concentration of retail stores, banks, restaurants, and entertainment in the Valley. In 1953, for example, the shopping strip included three full-line department stores: J.C. Penney at 5261 Lankershim, Yeakel & Goss department store at 5272, and the upscale single-location Rathbun's department store at 5307‚Äì15. There were also branches of the large Harris & Frank clothing chain at 5236 Lankershim, J. J. Newberry five and dime at 5321, and Safeway at 5356.\\"Christmas Gift Ideas\\", supplement to the Valley Times, December 3, 1953 However, the nearby Valley Plaza shopping center, designed for accessibility by car with plenty of free parking, opened in 1951 and kept growing until 1956 when it claimed to be the third-largest shopping center in the country. It was difficult for the Lankershim retail district to compete and by 1980, most stores had closed including Rathbun's. =CicLAvia= In 2015, Lankershim Boulevard, along with Ventura Boulevard, was the site of CicLAvia, an event sponsored by the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority in which major roads are temporarily closed to motorized vehicle traffic and used for recreational human-powered transport.

He was chairman of the Department of Medicine at Tulane University for many years. He is best known for his research in electrocardiography and vectorcardiography, for contributions to understanding viral-based cardiovascular diseases, for 12 books in the field of medicine and cardiology, and for more than 850 publications in the scholarly literature. He is also credited with the invention of the phlebomanometer, an instrument for measuring pressure in small veins.G.E. Burch, T.

Additionally Burch had wide influence as editor of the American Heart Journal (1959‚Äì82) and was an early anti-smoking activist.Biographical Note, \\"Finding Aid to the George Edward Burch Papers, 1926-1977\\" (web page of the National Library of Medicine, https://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/manuscripts/ead/burch.html), accessed 9 May 2008. The American Journal of Cardiology published a historical study of George E. Burch shortly after his death.W.C. Roberts, The American Journal of Cardiology, 58, 1986, pp. 162-7. A detailed biography of George E. Burch was published in 2010.\\"The Celestial Society: A Life in Medicine\\", Vivian Burch Martin, Xlibris Corporation, 2010, . An on-line biography is maintained by the Association of University Cardiologists. He has also been memorialized at Tulane University Medical Center in their organization of former internal medicine residents, the Musser-Burch Society. A bronze bust of George E. Burch by sculptor Jean Seidenberg is prominent in the main lobby of Tulane University School of Medicine. An oil painting, Portrait of George E. Burch, by artist George Rodrigue, resides at the New Orleans Museum of Art.  Heritage and early life  Burch was born on January 10, 1910 as the oldest of 8 siblings in Edgard, Louisiana, a river community that is part of the German Coast of Louisiana, of heritage emigrating from French provincial Sainte- Marie-aux-Mines in the early 1850s. His father was a rural general practitioner who involved Burch as a child and teenager in his medical practice, instilling a sense of the excitement and compassion of medicine. These early life experiences in rural Louisiana exposed Burch to people suffering from a variety of tropical and subtropical illnesses, in addition to effects of under-nutrition and the common illnesses of the day. He developed early a compassion for the suffering of underprivileged people that remained with him for the duration of his career.  Education and training  Burch's father died when Burch was 20 years old and in his first year of medical school. His medical school tuition was paid entirely by St. John Parish planter J.B.C. Graugnard, supplemented by working during summer vacations. He benefitted from receiving instructorships in college, impassioning him as a teacher. Burch graduated from Tulane University School of Medicine in 1933, and only obtained his Bachelor of Science degree two years after completing his degree as Doctor of Medicine (MD). Following medical school graduation, Burch commenced an internship at Charity Hospital of New Orleans, having selected internal medicine for his field of study because of its breadth and depth. This period included a clinical rotation in the rural community of Breaux Bridge, Louisiana. Formal residency programs were then rare, and Burch was awarded a Clinical Fellowship as Assistant Instructor at Tulane University School of Medicine in 1934. This instructorship gave him formal teaching responsibilities and provided Burch with opportunity to work with practitioners and researchers in the emerging field of cardiology, including John Herr Musser, James A. Bamber, George Herrmann, and Richard Ashman. These experiences were formative in his career as a medical researcher.  Early career  Burch's research emphasized fundamental physiological processes and their relationships to human diseases. For example, his invention of the phlebomanometer provided a tool to measure blood flow in the venous portion of the cardiovascular system for normal persons and for persons with certain cardiovascular diseases such as congestive heart failure. These findings were seminal at the time, ultimately leading to an understanding of the value of vasodilation in the treatment of congestive heart failure.G.E. Burch, AMA Arch. Int. Med., 1956:98:750-66. Burch's research on the biokinetics of basic metabolites such as water, sodium, potassium, and other ionic species extended to diseases exacerbated in subtropical climates such as are extant in the southern United States. Two crucial periods in his career as a medical researcher were his 1939 - 1941 fellowship at the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research and his 1948 service in the United Kingdom as a scientific officer of the US Foreign Service Reserve. Burch was certified in the field of Internal Medicine in 1940 by the American Board of Internal Medicine, one of the earliest physicians to earn such certification, as specialist certification was nascent at the time. He guided the development of the certification process beginning in 1941 when he started organizing the oral examinations.\\"A History of the American Board of Internal Medicine, 1936 - 1966\\", Victor W. Logan, MD, Chapter X, Page 4. He continued service to the Subspecialty Boards and other certification processes through much of his career. As an educator, Burch continued clinical teaching at Charity Hospital of New Orleans, with training responsibilities for medical students, residents, and Cardiology Fellows. His teaching included developing the medical school staff, exposing faculty at all levels to scientific journals, scientific conferences, and seminars with eminent scientists.  Later career  Burch became a senior academic with his 1947 appointment to the Chairmanship of the Department of Medicine at Tulane University, holding this position until his retirement in 1975, taking on emeritus status. The chairmanship coincided with his appointment as Henderson Professor of Medicine, an endowed position. As chairman, he created one of the first infectious diseases sections among medical schools in the U.S., certainly the first in medical schools in the American South.V.B. Martin, \\"The Celestial Society\\", pp. 180-2, Xlibris Corporation, . With medical school dean Charles C. Bass, he likewise instituted a section on Dental Health within the medical school, an action that remains uncommon today. He maintained his responsibility as attending physician at the same ward at Charity Hospital, sponsored the Hutchinson Clinic for medical education (created by Charles C. Bass), instituted a tutorial system for medicine residents, and led one of the earliest Fellowship programs for Cardiology Fellows. During this portion of Burch's career, he continued his investigations of fundamental physiological processes underlying cardiovascular disease and delineated diagnostic procedures for certain cardiovascular diseases, including Papillary Muscle SyndromeG.E.

Burch was an early pioneer in the use of radioisotopes for diagnostic purposes and for understanding fundamental physiological processes, focusing on electrolyte metabolism in congestive heart failure.V.B. Martin, \\"The Celestial Society\\", pp. 157-63, Xlibris Corporation, . He held License Number 1 for the civilian use of radioisotopes. An area of clinical emphasis was his efforts on understanding the role of the psyche in illness. Burch subsequently became editor-in-chief of the American Heart Journal, holding this position from 1959 - 1982. He was one of the founders of the Association of Professors of Medicine and the Southern Society for Clinical Investigation. Additionally, he founded the Association of Former Chairmen of Medicine and the Association of University Cardiologists, becoming the latter's first president. Burch was chairman of the World Health Organization Expert Advisory Panel on Cardiovascular Diseases and Chairman of the Advisory Committee to the U.S. Army on Environmental Medicine and Physiology. The latter project involved successfully sending the first two monkeys into space. Burch also served as a consultant to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.G.E.

He played college baseball at the University of Michigan from 1869 to 1873 and played for the Milwaukee Grays in Major League Baseball during the 1878 season. Early years Bliss was born in Chicago, Illinois, in 1852. He moved with his parents, Edwin J. Bliss (a carpenter and later contractor) and Mary Tuttle (Osborn) Bliss, to Ann Arbor, Michigan at age five and attended the public schools in Ann Arbor, graduating from high school in 1869. University of Michigan Bliss enrolled at the University of Michigan as a civil engineering student in 1869. He played college baseball there as a catcher from 1869 to 1873.(Bliss listed as catcher for the Class of 1874, \\"First Nine\\")(Bliss listed as the catcher for the Class of 1873 \\"First Nine\\")(Bliss listed as the catcher for the University of Michigan \\"First Nine\\"; also captain of the \\"Senior Nine\\") Teammate Frederick Stearns said of Bliss: \\"He was a wonder. Besides being a great catcher, he had the unusual distinction of always playing with his trousers tucked in long boots.\\"\\"Early Days\\", by Frederick K. Stearns, The Michigan Alumnus, November 2, 1922. Baseball historian Peter Morris has cited Bliss's use of long boots as an early innovation of protective gear for catchers, i.e., an early form of shin guards.(\\"It seems likely that these boots were intended to act as shin guards.\\") Bliss graduated from the University of Michigan in June 1873 with a degree in civil engineering. Bliss worked as a civil engineer from 1873 to 1875 in Cleveland, Pittsburgh, and Detroit. In the fall of 1877, he returned to the University of Michigan as a student in the law department and received an LL.B. degree in the spring of 1879. Professional baseball In 1876, Bliss was the catcher and team captain on the West End Club in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. An account of the 1876 West Enders noted that Bliss was a fine catcher \\"with great skill and nerve and throws to the bases with notable accuracy.\\" The 1876 West Enders played seven games against teams from the National League. After the 1876 season, Bliss sued the West End Club claiming that the team had agreed to pay him $1,300 but paid him less than $300. No record has been found of the lawsuit's outcome.Pajot 2009, p. 46. During the summer of 1877, Bliss played for minor league teams in Janesville, Wisconsin, and Buffalo, New York. In June 1878, the Milwaukee Grays lost their catchers to injuries and signed Bliss. Bliss was a law student at Michigan at the time, but he left school to join the Grays. Bliss made his Major League Baseball debut on June 20, 1878, as the battery mate to pitcher Mike Golden. Bliss was responsible for seven errors, including six passed balls, in the game.Pajot 2009, p. 65. Two days later, he appeared in his second and final game for the Grays, this time as a third baseman. In two games for the Grays, Bliss had one hit and scored one run in eight at bats and compiled a .124 batting average. Bliss was the first Michigan Wolverines baseball player to play in Major League Baseball. Later years Bliss was admitted to the Michigan bar in 1879. He began practicing law in Cleveland with the Herrick & Herrick firm. In 1881, he married Louisa Sarah Fish and moved to Brooklyn, Ohio. He continued to practice law in Cleveland. He served for several years as a member of Brooklyn's village council and was elected mayor of Brooklyn Village in 1888.The Bench and Bar of Cleveland, by James Harrison Kennedy, Wilson Miles Day, 1889, p. 306. Bliss and his wife Louisa had four children, Frank Bronson Bliss (b. 1883), Carl Edwin Bliss (b. 1885), Eugene Frederick Bliss (b. 1887) and Louise Mary Bliss (b. 1889).Barbarowa Genealogy, Brooklyn Village, Ohio.

Her case was originally researched by a team at the University of California, Irvine‚ÄîElizabeth Parker, Larry Cahill and James McGaugh. Price can apparently recall every day of her life from when she was 14 years old: \\"Starting on February 5th, 1980, I remember everything.

In 2008, with Bart Davis, she wrote the book The Woman Who Can't Forget, explaining her life with the condition. The book has allowed her popularity to soar internationally, leading to a demand in public appearances. Price's brain was subject to a brain scan and the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex were reportedly normal. It was claimed by research psychologist Gary Marcus, however, that her brain resembled those of people with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). Based upon tests he performed on her as well as personal observations, Marcus has speculated that her unusual autobiographical memory is actually a byproduct of compulsively making journal and diary entries. Price has since reacted angrily to such claims and McGaugh has also expressed skepticism for such an explanation. In September 2012, Price gave her first interview in over a year for the UK's Channel 4 documentary The Boy Who Can't Forget and provided an insight into just how difficult life can be for people who have this condition.The Boy Who Can't Forget UK, channel4.com, first broadcast 25 September 2012 Research scientist Dr. Julia Simner, at the Department of Psychology, University of Edinburgh, has speculated that her abilities are intimately tied to her visualizations of time in space, a form of synesthesia.

The Glavers are a small race, reptilian in appearance with opalescent skin, their bulbous eyes are independent of each other, and swivel in a way disconcerting to most binocular races. They are primarily quadrupedal with limited bipedal capacity. The Glavers' primary organ of manipulation is their prehensile tail, using its forked end to tackle more subtle tasks. However, the tail is weak in musculature, and so a use remains for the strong forelegs function as rudimentary hands for gripping and manipulation. These are clumsy and unsuited for any task more complicated than grasping a stick or handle and are used to tackle any heavy task the Glaver requires done. Glavers are capable of eating and digesting both plant matter and small insects, but are incapable of digesting meat. As this would indicate, Glavers have no canine teeth. They also lack incisors, relying entirely on crushing food matter between their large molars. There can be considered to be two groups of Glavers at present, those who are still live on as a spacefaring culture and those who walk the path of redemption. Glavers that are still a Spacefaring Culture They have been amenable to technological and academic exchange, and have been supportive of growing Terragen involvement in the fields of linguistics and inter-order communication, negotiation and trade. They are a moderate people. Glavers are militarily neutral in the Alliance for Progress' troubles with militant Galactic conservatives. Their real talent of the Glaver race, however, lies in an aptitude for communicating with hydrogen-breathing entities, who are an enigma to most oxy-species of the Five Galaxies. For many years, Glavers earned their collective living and status as diplomats, negotiating between oxygen breathing and hydrogen breathing lifeforms which is most likely part of the cause for their decline. See History and origins for more information. Glavers on the Path of Redemption (on Jijo) This group of Glavers have devolved to a pre-sapient state, following the holy Path of Redemption outlined by the Scrolls of Jijo. The Glavers no longer take part in any of the affairs of the other races of Jijo, but are still capable of limited speech, in some Galactic tongues. The other races see the Glavers' devolution as a shining example to them all, and the orthodox belief of the Six Races of Jijo is that devolution of this kind is the eventual goal for all of them. History and origins The Glavers long name is Glavers ab- Tunnuctyur ab-Buyur indicating that they had been uplifted by the Tunnuctyur who in their turn had been uplifted by the Buyur, the last tenants of Jijo. At some point in their past, the glaver species incurred a terrible debt with the Zang, the most powerful of the hydro-species, a debt far too great to pay off with property or service. The cause for the debt is unknown; but the magnitude is well reputed. In payment, the Zang took the only things the glavers had left to offer: themselves. As result, some went the path of redemption and became exiles on the planet Jijo as part in their attempt to repay this debt. They were the third of the exile races to arrive on the planet, but due to their devolvement little of their history is known since this devolution occurred before the arrival of the humans on Jijo. As for the Glavers that are still a spacefaring culture, they are waning in power as a race and are not what they were. They have fewer colonies than they used to.

ACS is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization with an office in San Pedro, California and chapters in Los Angeles, Orange County, Puget Sound (Seattle), Monterey, San Francisco, and a Student Coalition based out of Indiana University. The mission of the American Cetacean Society is to protect whales, dolphins, porpoises, and their habitats through public education, research grants, and conservation actions. ACS's programs are almost entirely conducted by volunteers.  How it began  The history of ACS is rich in irony. While founders Bemi DeBus and Clark Cameron were exploring the notion of eradicating world hunger by \\"farming\\" whales, they discovered that the whales themselves needed saving. They looked for an appropriate conservation group to collaborate with, but found nothing. With the help of scientists, educators, and yacht owners who volunteered to take people whale watching, ACS was launched on November 3, 1967. At that time, it was the only whale conservation group on the planet and the first to take groups of children on whale watching trips. During the past 30 years, more than two million children and thousands of adults have enjoyed whale watching trips sponsored by ACS. The impact of these grassroots efforts can be measured by the increasing worldwide popularity of whale watching (a one billion dollar per year industry that now attracts nine million participants in 87 countries) and the growth of a global conservation movement that ACS helped to launch. ACS's grassroots efforts to raise awareness and inspire people through whale watching and other educational programs led to a campaign that produced one of conservation's greatest success stories - the recovery of the Pacific gray whale. This is the only species of great whales to be removed from the Endangered Species List.  What the American Cetacean Society does  At the national level, ACS maintains a web site with free educational resources, such as fact sheets for various cetacean species, many of which are linked to from Wikipedia, as well as more than 200 educational organizations, such Discovery.com, National Geographic, PBS, the Smithsonian Institution, and Scientific American. Each of the Chapters have signature programs. For example, the Los Angeles Chapter conducts one of the longest running gray whale censuses in the U.S. Both the Los Angeles and the Orange County chapters conduct naturalist training programs. Most chapters also conduct research grant programs to support research on cetacean issues. Most chapters participate in local marine science educational events, and hand out free educational resources for teachers and students. Since one of ACS's goals is to promote conservation which is based on science, all of these free educational resources are reviewed by ACS's scientific advisory board prior to distribution. Both the chapters and the national organization have scientific advisory boards. The current national scientific advisory board includes such notable scientists as John Calambokidis, a senior research biologist and co- founder of Cascadia Research; John Ford, who leads the Marine Mammal Group in the Conservation Biology Section within the science branch of the Department of Fisheries and Oceans Canada; Denise Herzing, the Research Director of the Wild Dolphin Project; Hal Whitehead, professor of biology at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada; and others. ACS also participates in conservation advocacy campaigns, such as preventing the use of harmful sonar. ACS regularly sends a representative to meetings of the International Whaling Commission to persuade its members to uphold the moratorium on commercial whaling.

In addition, he is believed to have committed at least one previous murder, in 1984, for which a different man, David Vasquez, was wrongfully convicted. He was known to police as a prolific home burglar. Spencer became the first serial killer in the United States to be convicted on the basis of DNA evidence, with David Vasquez being the first to be exonerated following conviction on the basis of exculpatory DNA evidence.  Crimes  Debbie Dudley Davis, a 35-year-old account executive, was murdered between 9:00 p.m. on September 18, 1987 and 9:30 a.m. on September 19, 1987 in her Westover Hills apartment, where Richmond Police discovered her naked body lying on the bed. She had been strangled with a ligature and ratchet-type device. The medical examiner determined that her cause of death was ligature strangulation. Dr. Susan Hellams was murdered in her West 31st St. home on the night of October 2, 1987 or the early morning of October 3, 1987. The police were called by her husband after he returned home and discovered her partially clothed body on the floor of the couple's bedroom closet. Hellams was a resident in neurosurgery at the Medical College of Virginia in Richmond. Her attacker apparently gained access to the house by cutting out a large portion of a second-story bedroom window screen. The medical examiner determined that the cause of Hellams' death was ligature strangulation, apparently caused by two belts found around her neck. On November 22, 1987, Diane Cho, a 15-year- old high school student, was found in her family's apartment located on Gavilan Court in Chesterfield County, near Richmond. She too was raped and strangled in circumstances similar to the Davis and Hellams murders. Spencer's final known victim, Susan Tucker, 44, is believed to have been raped and murdered in her condominium in Arlington, Virginia on or about November 27, 1987. However, her body was not found in her apartment until December 1, 1987. Despite the change in location, her injuries left detectives certain that her death was caused by the murderer now dubbed by the press as the \\"Southside Strangler\\". = Possible Crimes = On January 16, 1988, Rena Chapouris and Michael St. Hilaire were found dead within a few blocks of each other in circumstances that appeared similar to the previous murders. Although initially thought to be the work of the Southside Strangler, Chapouris' death was determined to be the work of a copycat as she had not been raped as previous victims, and St. Hilaire's death was ultimately determined to be a suicide.  Investigation  On January 20, 1988, Arlington County police arrested Timothy Wilson Spencer, a 25-year-old Richmond resident, for the rape and murder of Susan Tucker in her Arlington home. Police established that Spencer had traveled from Richmond to Arlington during the period of her death to spend Thanksgiving with his mother, who lived about a mile from Tucker's home. He was charged with the murders of Debbie Davis, Susan Hellams and Diane Cho. At the times of the Richmond murders, Spencer had been staying at a South Richmond parolees' halfway house within walking distance of both Davis's and Hellams' residence. Before his release, he had been serving a sentence for a 1984 burglary conviction, which explains the hiatus between crimes. Forensic testing commenced on samples found at the crime scenes as the cases were prepared for trial.  Trials, appeals and execution  Spencer first came to trial in Arlington, Virginia, on July 11, 1988, for the rape, burglary and murder of Susan Tucker. He was represented by Carl Womack and Thomas Kelley. Spencer was convicted and sentenced to death, following the presentation of DNA evidence linking him to the Tucker crime scene, the first case in Virginia in which DNA was successfully used to prove an offender's identity. Following his conviction for the Tucker murder, Spencer again went on trial, this time in Richmond, for the rape, burglary and murder of Debbie Davis. DNA evidence in the form of semen and hairs collected at the scene of Debbie Davis' murder was determined to be consistent with Spencer's DNA. Forensic evidence given at his trial indicated that the statistical likelihood that the DNA found at the crime scene came from someone other than Spencer was one in 705,000,000. Spencer was convicted of the rape, burglary and capital murder of Debbie Davis on September 22, 1988. Spencer came to trial, again in Richmond, for the rape, burglary and murder of Susan Hellams on January 17, 1989. He was convicted and again sentenced to death after DNA evidence linking him to the scene of Hellams' murder was used by the prosecuting attorneys.Spencer v. Murray, 18 F.3d 229, (4th Cir.1994) Following the successful conviction of Spencer for the Tucker, Davis and Hellams murders, his DNA was compared with samples collected at other crime scenes, including both open and apparently closed cases. As a result of these investigations, it was determined that DNA evidence linked him to the 1984 murder of Carol Hamm, a crime for which David Vasquez had been convicted in early 1985. While the standard of the DNA evidence was determined to be inconclusive, FBI investigators were sufficiently confident given the factual similarities to the more recent crimes to report the conclusion that Spencer most likely was responsible for the Hamm murder and others. Vasquez was granted an unconditional pardon for her murder on January 4, 1989, having served five years of a 35-year prison sentence, and became the first American to be exonerated on the basis of exculpatory DNA evidence. Despite the conclusions of investigators as to his guilt, Spencer was never charged or convicted for Carol Hamm's murder. DNA evidence was not conclusive in Diane Cho's case; nevertheless, Spencer was tried and convicted for her murder.CHESTERFIELD JURY CONVICTS SPENCER OF CHO MURDER Spencer's motions to appeal his convictions for the murders of Susan Tucker, Debbie Davis and Susan Hellams were denied.http://cases.justia.com/us- court-of-appeals/F3/18/237/531097/ (Tucker)http://cases.justia.com/us-court- of-appeals/F3/5/758/626409/ (Davis) The United States Court of Appeal affirmed in its judgement that the reliance on evidence based on new DNA technology in obtaining Spencer's conviction was sound. Timothy Wilson Spencer was executed on April 27, 1994 at Greensville Correctional Centre in Jarratt, Virginia. He was put to death in the electric chair.https://leelofland.com/twenty-six- years-ago-i-watched-a-serial-killer-die/  Aftermath  Paul Mones' book Stalking Justice: The Dramatic True Story of the Detective Who First Used DNA Testing to Catch a Serial Killer, published in July 1995, details the experience of Arlington Detective Joe Horgas in investigating the murders and pursuing the matter to the conviction of Spencer and the vindication of David Vasquez. The murders and Spencer's conviction also formed the basis for an episode of the forensic science documentary series Medical Detectives, which aired on October 31, 1996. The investigation of the Southside murders and eventual conviction of Timothy Spencer form the subject matter of Chapter 11 of former FBI psychological profiler John Douglas' 1996 memoir Journey into Darkness. Patricia Cornwell's bestselling novel Postmortem attracted considerable controversy and criticism in Richmond at the time of its publication in 1990 due to the close similarities between the facts of Spencer's 1987 crimes (particularly Hellams' case) and those of the serial murders which formed the basis for Cornwell's plot. Cornwell was in fact employed as a computer analyst within the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in Richmond at the time of Spencer's 1987 killings.Beahm, George W. The Unofficial Patricia Cornwell Companion St. Martin's Minotaur, New York, 2002. While it is acknowledged that the subject matter of several of Cornwell's earlier books are loosely based on real crimes in the Virginia area, she has stated that she writes about specific types of crime, not specific cases.

After graduating from high school in Peru, Nebraska, he joined the U.S. Army, serving from 1944 to 1948 and reaching the rank of First Lieutenant. He received an A.B. from the University of Nebraska in 1950 and an M.A. from the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University in 1951. Edmondson joined the United States Department of State as an intern in 1951. Later that same year he married the former Donna Elizabeth Kiechel, whom he had met at the University of Nebraska. In 1952 he was appointed as Vice Consul and deputy principal officer in Dar es Salaam, Tanganyika, where he served from 1953 to 1955. From 1955 to 1957, he was economic officer in Bern, Switzerland. In 1957-58, he pursued African area studies at Northwestern University. From 1958 to 1960 Edmondson was an intelligence research specialist at the State Department. In 1960 and 1961 he was acting chief of the West Africa Division of the Bureau of Intelligence and Research. He was political officer in Accra, Ghana from 1961 to 1964, and officer in charge of Ghana affairs at the State Department from 1964 to 1965. Edmondson was deputy chief of mission in Lusaka, Zambia, from 1965 to 1969. He attended the National War College in 1969-70 and served as educational and cultural affairs officer at the State Department in 1970 and 1971. From 1971 to 1974, he was Director of the Office of African Programs in the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs. From 1974 to 1976, Edmondson was Deputy Chief of Mission in South Africa. From 1976 to 1978 he served as Deputy Assistant Secretary for African Affairs at the State Department. In 1978, Edmondson was appointed by President Jimmy Carter as the U.S. Ambassador to the Republic of South Africa. His appointment came at a time of major political and social upheaval in that country, following the Soweto uprising and the murder of student activist Steve Biko. It also came at a time of high tension between the white minority South African government and the Carter Administration. As U.S. envoy, Edmondson was the public face of what many conservative South African whites considered to be a hostile American government, given the U.S. government's condemnation of apartheid in South Africa and its vocal support for civil and political rights and democratic reform leading to majority rule. His service in South Africa effectively voiced those policies.Library of Congress Foreign Affairs Oral History Collection, Interview with Amb.

As a regular source of news and information HVG has a significant influence on business decision makers and other stakeholder groups. With its editorial office in Budapest, HVG provides objective information about domestic and international politics, economy and society. Capitalizing on its all-round column structure HVG puts great emphasis on the presentation of public issues and their context, besides reporting of recent events in cultural life and news from science and technology. HVG has an online news portal, which is available on all platforms: mobile, tablet, android and iOS applications. With its news and analyzes, HVG reaches more than 1.5 million people every week on its various print and digital platforms. HVG weekly cover page 2018/33 Ever since its foundation HVG stands for independent journalism and free expression. In April 2018, HVG launched a supportive membership program in which readers who join the HVG community can, in return for their financial support, enjoy many benefits in addition to diverse, independent and factual information. History and profile The magazine was very important in the years spanning the transition from communism in airing new ideas and challenging boundaries. During the same period it was also a leading investigative publication. HVG Publishing Co. was founded in 1989. In 2003 Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung (WAZ) acquired 75% of the magazine. In 2014 WAZ (Funke) redeemed its majority stake, which was bought back by former HVG shareholder, management and editorial staff, and HVG was again in Hungarian hands. In response to changes in the market, digital content gained more and more importance within HVG Publishing's activities, and the product portfolio continued to expand. Apart from the weekly magazine and its specials, annexes and numerous professional or entertaining periodicals, HVG Publishing Co. has become one of the largest book publishers in Hungary, while conferences, seminars or even the largest Hungarian Job Fair continue to color the Publisher's product range. Political and power measures in the second half of the 2010s are increasingly breathing air from market- based media companies and increasingly discouraging the survival of independent journalism. In this hostile market environment HVG's goal and mission remains to provide independent and factual information to readers. The slogan of HVG also expresses this mission while reflecting on the current situation. ‚ÄôDarkness does not last forever‚Äô, along with the statement ‚ÄôLet there be light‚Äô, with which HVG encourages and sympathizes with its readers, reminiscing of the first years spent in an almost ‚Äôhalf-illegitimacy‚Äô under the socialist regime. The politics that undermine independent press and the expansion of international social media and search giants (Facebook, Google) in the advertising market puts under unprecedented pressure HVG‚Äôs business model built on copy sales and advertisements. HVG has launched a Membership Program in April 2018, whereby readers who join the HVG community can enjoy many benefits in return for their financial support in addition to diverse, independent and factual information. Some articles are also available online and in English. HVG cover pages HVG's iconic cover pages always work on one of the main themes of the week, mostly depicting ironic humor. In the 80's, headlines were mostly not photos, but graphics featuring suggestive hints.

The teams first met in 1908, and have played each other every year since 1981. Arkansas leads the series, which includes two wins by Ole Miss in postseason bowl games, the 1963 and 1970 Sugar Bowls. History The rivalry between Arkansas and Ole Miss developed partially due to geography. Besides being neighboring states in the southeastern United States, from the University of Arkansas' perspective, before the addition of Missouri, the University of Mississippi was closer in terms of distance than any other Southeastern Conference school. Arkansas has played Ole Miss more than any other SEC opponent with the exception of Texas A&M.; =Pre 1980s= The teams were first scheduled to meet each other in 1906, but due to a cancellation, the two teams began play against one another in a 1908 contest in which Arkansas won by a score of 33‚Äì0. Arkansas and Mississippi played many times sporadically in the following years. In addition to several single years of playing each other, the two teams played each other from 1940‚Äì47 and 1952‚Äì62 on an annual basis. The Razorbacks and Rebels also met twice in the Sugar Bowl played in New Orleans, in 1963 and 1970; both contests were won by Ole Miss. Especially in the early years, the teams often met in Memphis, Tennessee to play the game, besides the normal Arkansas and Mississippi game sites. =1980s to present= Since 1981, the two teams have played each other annually in football. The games have generally alternated yearly between a site in Mississippi (Jackson, or more recently Oxford) and a site in Arkansas (Little Rock, or more recently Fayetteville), except for one time in 1995 when the game was played in Memphis, Tennessee. Since Arkansas joined the Southeastern Conference in 1991 (first football season was 1992; previously a member of the SWC), the two teams have played annually as both conference and Western division rivals. =Recently (2000s‚Äì2010s)= In 2001, Arkansas and Ole Miss had an NCAA record seven-overtime game in Oxford, Mississippi. Houston Nutt association Upon the conclusion of the 2007 regular season, Arkansas Razorbacks coach Houston Nutt was forced to resign amid several controversies and allegations that had arisen. Hours later, he was announced as the head coach of the Ole Miss Rebels football team, replacing Ed Orgeron who had been fired after three consecutive losing seasons. Ole Miss and Arkansas met in Fayetteville on October 25, 2008 with identical 3‚Äì4 records. This marked Nutt's first return to the University of Arkansas campus as an opposing coach. Nutt led his Rebels to a 23‚Äì21 victory over the Razorbacks. The long-standing rivalry was more interesting while he was coaching because of his association with both universities. Nutt was fired by Ole Miss at the end of the 2011 season, ending his association with this rivalry. Game results The results of games played between Arkansas and Ole Miss: Notable games = 1908 ‚Äì First Meeting = Arkansas 33 ‚Äì Ole Miss 0 The very first meeting between the two teams was a 1908 contest in which Arkansas won 33‚Äì0. The teams were first scheduled to meet each other in 1906, but due to a cancellation, the 1908 contest was the first meeting. = 1914 ‚Äì Contentious result = Arkansas lists the 1914 contest as a forfeit by Ole Miss because Ole Miss used an ineligible player. Ole Miss denies the allegation of using an ineligible player and therefore lists the contest by the recorded on the field winning score of 13‚Äì7 in favor of Ole Miss. Therefore, the two school's official records for the overall series shows a one-game difference. = 1954 ‚Äì Powder River Pass = No. 7 Arkansas 6 ‚Äì No. 5 Ole Miss 0 Arkansas and Ole Miss met in War Memorial Stadium on October 23, 1954. The game was scoreless until the Razorbacks called a trick play: a 66-yard halfback pass from halfback Buddy Bob Benson to Preston Carpenter for the only points of the game. Arkansas head coach Bowden Wyatt named the play after the Powder River, a river in his native Wyoming. The river is a mile wide but deceptively only a foot deep. With the 6‚Äì0 win, Arkansas would go on to fall in the 1955 Cotton Bowl Classic against Bobby Dodd's Georgia Tech, and the Rebels would continue to the 1955 Sugar Bowl, losing to Navy. = 1959 = No. 4 Ole Miss 28 ‚Äì No. 10 Arkansas 0 The 1959 contest was won by Ole Miss 28‚Äì0 in Memphis, Tennessee on their way to a final record of 10‚Äì1 for the 1959 season and one of their three claimed national championships. = 1960 = No. 2 Ole Miss 10 ‚Äì No. 14 Arkansas 7 The 1960 contest between the teams was won by Ole Miss 10‚Äì7 at War Memorial Stadium in Little Rock, Arkansas, on their way to a final record of 10‚Äì0‚Äì1 for the 1960 season and the second of their three claimed national championships.

Retrieved on August 23, 2008. A tying 32-yard field goal attempt was then set up by Eli Manning. Razorback fullback Mark Pierce ran in from one yard away to take a 17‚Äì10 Arkansas lead in the fourth quarter, but Eli Manning connected with Jamie Armstead to send the game into overtime. Razorback RB Cedric Cobbs scored from 16 yards out to start the overtime scoring. Eli Manning responded with an 11-yard touchdown pass, sending the game to a second overtime, in which neither team would score. Matt Jones scrambled all 25 yards for the go-ahead touchdown, but the two point run failed. Ole Miss drove to the one-yard line, where Joe Gunn ran in. Given a chance to end the game by completing the two-point conversion, Eli Manning threw the ball, but it was incomplete, sending the game to its fourth extra frame. Rebel receiver Bill Flowers hauled in a 21-yard pass from Manning to take the lead, 36‚Äì30. After the Rebels failed the two point pass, Jones threw a 24-yard TD pass to George Wilson. The Hogs would fail the two point run, extending the game to a fifth overtime. Jones again scored for the Razorbacks, an 8-yard rush, but failed the two-point conversion. Manning hit his tight end Doug Zeigler from twelve yards out, and failed the two point pass. In the sixth overtime, Zeigler again caught a Manning aerial, and Ole Miss connected on the two-point conversion with a Charles Stackhouse rush, taking a 50‚Äì42 lead. Razorback Pierce ran in from two yards out, and Arkansas completed the tying two-point conversion on a Jones pass. The game would go to a seventh overtime. Mark Pierce again ran in for a two-yard touchdown (his third two- yard score of the game), and Decori Birmingham would receive the two point pass from Jones, making it a 58‚Äì50 Hog lead. Manning would throw his sixth touchdown pass, but the two point pass to Doug Ziegler was stopped by Jermaine Petty, giving Arkansas a 58‚Äì56 win over rival Ole Miss. The two teams combined for 60 first downs, 130 rushing attempts (80 from the Razorbacks), 68 pass attempts, and 198 total offensive plays, while limiting mistakes, including two fumbles, eight penalties, and one sack. The win moved Arkansas to 5‚Äì3 on the year and 3‚Äì0 in overtime. Arkansas would play another seven-overtime game in 2003 at Kentucky, which Arkansas won with a final score of 71‚Äì63. Arkansas finished with 531 yards of offense, 370 rushing and 161 passing, while Ole Miss netted 457 yards of offense, 312 passing and 166 rushing. = 2008 ‚Äì Houston Nutt's first return to Arkansas = Ole Miss 23 ‚Äì Arkansas 21 On October 25, 2008, Ole Miss returned to Donald W.

This was the first game between Ole Miss and Arkansas with former Razorback head coach Houston Nutt as the head coach of the Rebels. Ole Miss won the game by a score of 23 to 21. This was the Rebels' first win in the series since 2003. = 2011 ‚Äì Houston Nutt's last stand = Ole Miss on offense during the game No. 10 Arkansas 29 ‚Äì Ole Miss 24 When the two teams met on October 22, 2011, in Oxford, they seemed to be heading in different directions. Arkansas was ranked in the top ten, fresh off two top-15 victories, while the Rebels were winless in the SEC with coach Houston Nutt on the hot seat. The Rebels, however, surprised the Razorbacks by opening up a 17‚Äì0 lead in the second quarter behind quarterback Randall Mackey. A late touchdown brought Arkansas to within 10 points. The Razorbacks continued in the third quarter with a 19‚Äì0 scoring run, including two touchdown runs by quarterback Tyler Wilson and a safety; the Razorbacks were up 26‚Äì17. Arkansas added a field goal in the fourth quarter before the Rebels rallied: Ole Miss closed within 29‚Äì24 late in the game and was able to recover an onside kick. The Rebels's chance of a winning touchdown was thwarted with Eric Bennett's interception of Randall Mackey with little time remaining, sealing the win for Arkansas. Arkansas moved up to 6‚Äì1 (2‚Äì1 SEC) while Ole Miss fell to 2‚Äì5 (0‚Äì4 SEC). The win was Arkansas's second in a row in the series, and it was Houston Nutt's final game against his former team. He was fired at the end of the 2011 season. = 2015 ‚Äì Fourth and 25 = Arkansas 53 ‚Äì No. 18 Ole Miss 52 The November 7, 2015 contest in Oxford between the two teams was a hard-fought offensive battle in which Arkansas largely abandoned its previous ground-and-pound style for a more pass- intensive offensive philosophy in which quarterback Brandon Allen threw for a career-high 442 yards and six touchdowns. Arkansas and Ole Miss scored exactly the same in each of the individual four quarters of regulation time leading up to overtime. In overtime, Arkansas won the coin toss and elected to play defense first, leading to Ole Miss scoring the first overtime touchdown. After the Ole Miss touchdown, and while on defense, Arkansas kept the game from ending on a fourth-and-25 play in which quarterback Brandon Allen completed a pass to Hunter Henry, who saw that he was going to be tackled, and flung the ball backwards as a lateral towards running back Alex Collins. Collins picked it up on the bounce at the line of scrimmage and ran it for a 31-yard gain to gain a first down, fumbling it at the end of the play, but it was recovered by teammate Dominique Reed. Head coach Bret Bielema called the play \\"divine intervention.\\" The uniqueness of the play led to widespread media attention and replays. After Arkansas scored an ensuing touchdown, they chose to go for two, even though overtime rules do not require a two-point conversion attempt until the 3rd overtime. The first attempt appeared to result in a quarterback sack and a victory for the Rebels, but Ole Miss' Marquis Haynes was called for an obvious face-mask penalty, which gave the Razorbacks another chance. On the next play, Arkansas quarterback Brandon Allen ran it into the end zone. The win moved Arkansas one game closer to eventual bowl eligibility. For Ole Miss, the loss meant they no longer controlled their own destiny in the SEC West for the 2015 season as they had previously coming into the game. The loss cost Ole Miss the SEC West championship and a trip to Atlanta, Georgia for the SEC Championship game. The play is also referred to as the \\"Swine Intervention\\", the \\"Henry Heave\\", or the \\"Oh Henry\\". = 2016 ‚àí Battle Between Ranked Teams = No. 22 Arkansas 34 ‚Äì No. 12 Ole Miss 30 The 2016 meeting between the two teams was the first between the two when both were ranked since 1970. Ole Miss was looking for a measure of revenge after the previous seasons overtime loss to Arkansas, effectively knocked the Rebels out of contention for the SEC Championship Game. But Arkansas' quarterback Austin Allen, younger brother of former Hog QB Brandon Allen, engineered a solid offense for the Razorbacks all game long. Allen was helped by sophomore running back Rawleigh Williams III's 180 yards rushing, and a strong performance from Arkansas' defense, which held Ole Miss to a season low 30 points, and kept QB Chad Kelly from amassing his 2015 offensive totals. The game was tied 20-20 at halftime, but Arkansas scored the only points of the third quarter, and held a 27-20 lead in the fourth. Kelly lead Ole Miss to ten unanswered points, and the Rebels took the lead with nine minutes to play. After the teams traded punts, Allen guided the Hogs down the field, and receiver Jared Cornelius scored on a six-yard end around play, to give Arkansas back the lead, 34-30, with only two minutes and twenty seconds to play. After Arkansas defensive lineman Jeremiah Ledbetter sacked Kelly on third down, and the Rebels were penalized five yards for a false start, it was fourth down and sixteen, with the game on the line. Kelly took the snap, rolled left, and tucked the ball to try and run for the first down. It appeared that Kelley had the first, but he was hit hard by Arkansas safety Santos Ramirez, and the ball popped out of Kelly's grasp and rolled out of bounds behind the line to gain. That turned over the ball to the Razorbacks, and Austin Allen took a knee on three plays to run out the clock. It was Arkansas' third consecutive victory over Ole Miss.

Listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the Balboa was refurbished (beginning in 2005) and reopened as a performing arts venue in 2008. History The Balboa was built by businessman Robert E. Hicks and architect William H. Wheeler in 1924. A grand vaudeville/movie palace combining Moorish and Spanish Revival styles, the single-balcony theatre originally had a seating capacity of 1,513; waterfalls on either side of the proscenium arch provided air cooling. As part of the Fox West Coast circuit, the Balboa featured live vaudeville and movies, accompanied by orchestra and organ. An article from the American Theatre Organ Society states that Edward Swan was the organist at the Balboa Theatre in 1925-26 and he claims that the original 426 pipe Robert Morton organ was the finest he had ever played. It had an echo organ over the balcony. He ‚Äúplayed the features while the small orchestra did the vaudeville segments. Sometimes Ed also played the organ or piano with the orchestra and his playing time lengthened to 10 or 12 hours a day.‚Äù In 1930 the theatre was upgraded for sound pictures and a new neon marquee was added. In 1934, it was remodeled, reopening as Teatro Balboa, featuring Spanish-language films. The theatre's office space was converted to housing for the U.S. Navy during World War II. After the war, Balboa languished as a movie house and in 1959 was purchased by the Russo family. Because of its rich history and splendid architecture the Balboa was designated as a local historic site in 1972. Although the 1973 Horton Plaza Redevelopment Plan called for complete restoration of the building as a theatre, the City of San Diego instead condemned it; the Centre City Development Corporation (CCDC) made plans to gut the theatre for commercial space, intending to strip the interior and build four floors of retail space. Restoration In 1985, a small group of advocates led by Steve Karo formed the Save Our Balboa Organization to lobby against destruction of the theatre and to support its restoration. The Save Our Balboa group garnered public support and eventually prevailed in a long and hard-fought effort to stop destruction of the theatre. The Save Our Balboa Organization developed into the Balboa Theatre Foundation which continued lobbying for restoration and in 1996, succeeded in listing the Balboa Theatre on the National Register of Historic Places. After twenty years, CCDC did a turnaround and decided to fund a complete restoration which began in 2005. They not only funded, at a cost of $26.5 million, but superbly managed the project, working with restoration architects Westlake Reed Leskosky. The theatre re-opened in 2008 and is now an excellent venue for live theatre and concerts. In 2009, after extensive renovation, the Balboa Theatre Foundation rededicated a 1929 Wonder Morton organ, one of only four such organs in the world. The Foundation purchased, restored and relocated the 4-manual, 23-rank organ from Pennsylvania to the Balboa Theatre after a five-year-long restoration. The original Robert Morton organ was moved to the Fox Theatre in 1929, which is now Copley Symphony Hall. Current use The Balboa Theatre now hosts the Mainly Mozart Festival, special events, and touring companies of Broadway productions. The city of San Diego holds the annual \\"State of the City\\" address at the theatre.

Not unlike most other larger villages in the country, locals typically distinguish an \\"upper\\" (–≥–æ—Ä–Ω–∞) and \\"lower\\" (–¥–æ–ª–Ω–∞) quarter (–º–∞–∞–ª–∞). Historically, the latter developed from the expansion of the former. The neighborhood Bukovski Livadi (–ë—É–∫–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏ –õ–∏–≤–∞–¥–∏, \\"Bukovo Meadows\\") comprises ten residential streets and is located at the entrance to the village; often considered a part of Bukovo, it is actually a suburb of the City of Bitola. The village collectively celebrates the Feast of the Transfiguration as its local holiday ‚Äî referred to as \\"the Day\\" (–î–µ–Ω–æ—Ç) ‚Äî after the village's eponymous monastery. The celebration of Lazarus Saturday is also upheld devotedly, a tradition which has very nearly died out in the rest of the country. The village is famous for its crushed red pepper or chilli flakes which it is credited with inventing. The local variety of chili pepper is known as \\"–±—É–∫–æ–≤–µ—Ü\\" (bukovec). The name of the village‚Äîor a derivative of it‚Äîis now used as a name for crushed red pepper in general in a number of Southeast European languages: \\"–±—É–∫–æ–≤–∫–∞\\" (bukovka, Macedonian), \\"bukovka\\" (Serbian, Croatian and Slovene) and \\"ŒºœÄŒøœçŒ∫ŒøŒ≤Œø\\" (b√∫kovo, Greek). History Local legend has it that the first families to settle in Bukovo had come from a much older village called Neoljani (–ù–µ–æ–ª—ò–∞–Ω–∏) which was completed destroyed in a firestorm. The discovery of the ruins of a church‚Äîattested in statistical documents‚Äîat the base of nearby mountains are usually cited as proof of this. Similarly, it is widely claimed that the upper maala (\\"quarter\\") of the village was settled by people from the now long abandoned village of Magarevo (–ú–∞–≥–∞—Ä–µ–≤–æ) and the lower maala by people from the abandoned village of Seli≈°te (–°–µ–ª–∏—à—Ç–µ). In both cases, the ruins of houses can be found in adjacent areas. Others, however, believe that the original settlers were the fleeing residents of the ancient city of Heraclea following its devastating earthquake. During its most prosperous period, the village had approximately 5,000 residents and over 600 students enrolled in its grammar school. As a municipality in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, Bukovo was twice visited by King Alexander I as the \\"most orderly\\" village in all of Yugoslavia. Throughout the 20th century, many residents left for Australia, the United States, Canada and areas of Western Europe in search of work. There are approximately 2,000 natives of Bukovo in the ethnic Macedonian diaspora, more than 800 of whom live in Rochester, New York, affectionately referred to as \\"Bukovo City\\" by Macedonians who live there. A large number of people from Bukovo have also settled in Richmond, Australia. The Bukovo Monastery (officially the \\"Monastery of the Feast of the Transfiguration\\") was once an important cultural center where monks would translate and copy sacred texts into the local vernacular. Time had deteriorated the monastery building leading residents to renovate it during the 2000s (decade). Demographics 19th-century geographers write that Bukovo was once a completely Orthodox Christian village with a school run by the Patriarchate of Constantinople. According to Geographers Dimitri Mishev and D. M. Brancoff, the town had a total population of 2.400 people in 1905, all Patriarchist Bulgarians.Dimitri Mishev and D. M. Brancoff, La Mac√©doine et sa Population Chr√©tienne, p. 166 According to the 2002 census, the village had a total population of 3,494 people: 3,456 ethnic Macedonians, 11 Albanians, 14 Turks, 1 Aromanian, 6 Serbs and 6 declared as \\"other\\".

It is a narrow brick building, three stories in height and two bays wide. The left bay has a projecting hexagonal bay, which rises the full height to a polygonal roof capped by a finial. The entrance, in the right bay, is approached by stone steps with a low stone railing, and is topped by a carved stone lintel. The building is not otherwise of architectural interest. Its construction date is unknown; it is stylistically typical of row houses built in Washington during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The house was from 1902 until 1917 home to Samuel Gompers. Gompers, a native of England, came to the United States as a young man and worked as a cigar maker.

The residential area is constructed around the village centre consisting of shops, services and amenities for residential living, with walking trails radiating outward from the central core. This suburb has some detached homes and condominiums sold, and in 2008, there are still several areas still under construction. According to MLS data, the average sale price of a home as of 2013 was $368,790. The land on which Hampton Village sits was annexed over a period of many years. The western half (west of Junor Avenue) was annexed in July 1979, while the eastern half wasn't annexed until May 2000. Some remnant lots along the southern portion of the community rest on lands annexed by the city between 1911 and 1977.

Barrie John Watts and Valmae Faye Beck, a married couple, were convicted in 1988 of the much-publicised crime. Watts was sentenced to life imprisonment without parole; however, his wife would have been eligible for parole after 14.5 years, but died while she was still incarcerated.Valmae Beck, Sian Kingi's killer, is 'close to death', Courier Mail, 7 May 2008 Disappearance At around 4:30 pm on Friday, 27 November 1987, Sian Kingi, a 12-year-old schoolgirl, was last seen riding her yellow 10-speed bicycle home after school near Pinnaroo Park in Noosa Heads. Just beforehand, Kingi had been shopping with her mother, and took her regular route home afterwards through the park. When her mother arrived home and Kingi was not there as expected, it was assumed that she had met friends from her school or her volleyball team and was delayed. Later, when Kingi still did not return, her mother began calling the homes of her friends without success. By 8 pm, Kingi's parents began retracing her steps, and, after retrieving her abandoned bicycle from the park, visited the local police to report the disappearance. Investigation Despite the late notice, police were able to assist in having a missing person's report for Kingi inserted into the following day's newspaper. Police also began collecting information about people who had been in the park at the time of the disappearance. Police had little to go on until the discovery of Kingi's body on 3 December 1987, 15 km away near Castaway's Creek in the Tinbeerwah Mountain State Forest. Attention then turned to a dusty unidentified white 1973 Holden Kingswood station wagon, with interstate registration, that had been seen in the general area. In the weeks that followed, as police gathered evidence, numerous other incidents were linked to the vehicle (although exact details of the vehicle often varied), including the suspicious behaviour of the driver and three other assault incidents. The owner of the vehicle, confirmed as Victorian registration LLE-429, was finally identified as Valmae Beck. Beck and her husband, Barrie Watts, who had married a year earlier, had been living in Perth, but had moved to Victoria before renting a property in Lowood, Queensland. Both had extensive criminal records and were out on bail. When police visited the Lowood property on 11 December, evidence indicated that Watts and Beck had last been there on 4 December (when news of the discovery of the body broke). Cut hair and dye kits indicated that both had changed their appearance. Fortunately, the owner of the property had received a money order for rent from the couple on 10 December from The Entrance, New South Wales. Plain clothes police were then able to locate and arrest the couple there on 12 December, and they were extradited to Queensland on 14 December. The couple were charged on 15 December with the abduction, rape, and murder of Kingi. During questioning, Watts refused to speak, but Beck was more talkative. Between Beck's comments and secret recordings from their adjacent holding cells, investigators were able to recreate the crime. Beck explained how Watts, unsatisfied with her because she was ten years his senior, had fantasised about raping a young virgin. After a number of previous attempts on other victims in Ipswich, they noticed Kingi, and Beck stopped her on the premise that she was looking for her lost poodle.Letters of a child killer, Courier Mail, 7 July 2007 After dismounting to help, Watts then grabbed Kingi from behind and forced her into the back of their car where she was bound and then driven by Beck to Tinbeerwah. Kingi was then raped by Watts before being stabbed, strangled, and abandoned.  Trial  At a committal hearing in April 1988, Beck pleaded guilty to the abduction and rape, and not guilty to the murder, while Watts pleaded not guilty to all charges. The couple were tried separately at the Noosa Magistrates Court primarily on Beck's testimony. Beck's trial commenced in October 1988 and Watts's in February 1990. Beck was found guilty on 20 October 1988, and given three years, five years, and life imprisonment for the three charges. Watts, who remained unresponsive during trial, was found guilty on 28 February 1990, and given three years, fifteen years, and life imprisonment for the three charges.  Subsequent developments  = Watts = During trial, it was revealed that Barrie Watts was an orphan with a long criminal record who had met Beck in 1983 and married her in 1986 in Perth. In 1995, he was tried for the murder of Helen Mary Feeney, who was last seen alive on 29 October 1987, one month before the murder of Kingi. The case failed due to lack of evidence. In 2007, in an unsuccessful effort to promote his parole chances, Watts finally confessed to his involvement in the murder of Kingi.'I killed Sian Kingi', Courier Mail, 10 June 2007 =Beck= Valmae Beck had three older brothers, and as a 12-year-old, began working in a clothing factory. By 15, due to parental neglect, she became a ward of the state and spent much of the period from 1961 to 1972 in and out of jail. While in prison in Perth, she met and was influenced by serial killer Catherine Birnie. Prior to her relationship with Watts, Beck had six children from two previous marriages. In prison, Beck was targeted by fellow inmates and was assaulted frequently. At one point, she was struck in the head with a tin can in a sock, causing serious injury. Beck eventually had to be transferred to the Townsville Correctional Centre. She was also said to have converted to Christianity during this time. Beck divorced Watts in 1990. saying she regretted everything she had ever done with him. In 1993, she began a romance with Robert John Fardon, a convicted rapist. Beck unsuccessfully applied for parole three times, and in 2007, it was reported that she had legally changed her name to Fay Cramb. In May 2008, she was placed in an induced coma in Townsville Hospital following heart surgery.Let Noosa child killer die, says MP, Sunshine Coast Daily, 8 May 2008 Police hoped to obtain a deathbed confession regarding three other unsolved Brisbane-area murders of young women, but Beck died on 27 May 2008 without regaining consciousness.

Baltimore City Hall Baltimore City Hall The commission for the Baltimore City Hall, 100 Holiday Street, was awarded after a design competition to Frederick, a complete unknown and not quite twenty, in the fateful year 1860. The Civil War intervened, and construction finally got under way in 1867. Frederick's design looked to the new additions to the Palais du Louvre, completed under Hector Lefuel in 1857, and well publicized to professionals and architects alike through engravings, lithographs and description; its high Mansard roofs, bold corner pavilions, richly framed dormers are reflected in Frederick's City Hall,Mary Ellen Hayward, Frank R.

Twin interior courts provided every room with natural light. Well launched by the City Hall, which influenced the design of every ambitious commercial building in Baltimore for more than a decade, Frederick went on to design the premises of the major German-American newspaper The German Correspondent, completed in 1869 on a prominent corner lot on Baltimore Avenue; it had three main floors and an attic behind French mansards, with a marble-clad facing with Venetian-Gothic windows. The German Orphan Asylum (1873) was another German-American commission. Maryland State House State House, Annapolis In 1876, Frederick was hired by the Maryland General Assembly to supervise renovations to the then aging Maryland State House. $32,000 was originally appropriated for the project, but the final cost was more than $100,000. most of the cost overrun was due to the necessity of excavations for a new cellar to house two new furnaces and a hot water apparatus to properly heat the building. In 1878 the General Assembly called for an investigation of the cost overrun. After taking testimony from artisans and laborers who had worked on the project, the General Assembly decided to pay the subcontractors, but not Frederick. Frederick would later refuse requests by the state of Maryland to turn over his detailed measurements and architectural drawings. In 1868 Frederick was a founder of the Baltimore chapter of the American Institute of Architects. References *Chalkley, Tom. \\"Built to Last.\\" Charmed Life.

Arnhart is the author of five books and more than forty peer-reviewed articles.http://www.niu.edu/polisci/faculty/profiles.shtml#arnhart Background and Career He has a Ph.D. in Political Science from the University of Chicago in 1977, an M.A. in Political Science from the University of Chicago in 1974, and a B.A. in Politics from the University of Dallas in 1971.] In the Department of Political Science at Northern Illinois University, Arnhart teaches in the fields of political theory and biopolitics. Arnhart is best known as a scholar in the history of political philosophy and as a proponent of \\"Darwinian natural right,\\" \\"Darwinian conservatism,\\" and \\"Aristotelian liberalism.\\" He argues that the tradition of ethical naturalism from Aristotle to Thomas Aquinas to Alasdair MacIntyre can be supported by a Darwinian account of ethics as rooted in human biological nature, which combines liberty and order, freedom and virtue. In defending Darwinian naturalism, Arnhart has debated the proponents of \\"intelligent design theory\\" by suggesting that they employ a purely negative rhetoric of criticizing Darwinian evolutionary theory, while offering no positive theory of exactly where, when, and how the \\"intelligent designer\\" intervenes in nature to create \\"irreducibly complex\\" mechanisms. Arnhart has debated the leading advocates of intelligent design‚ÄîMichael Behe, William Dembski, John West, Jonathan Wells, and Richard Weikart‚Äîall of whom are fellows of the Discovery Institute. John West has written a book attacking Arnhart ‚Äî Darwin's Conservatives: A Misguided Quest.http://www.orthodoxytoday.org/articles/ArnhartDarwinDesign.php In defending Darwinian conservatism, Arnhart tries to persuade conservatives that Darwinian science supports the conservative belief that social order arises not from rational planning but from the spontaneous order of instincts and habits.https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/05/us/politics/05darwin.html He suggests that Darwinian biology sustains conservative social thought by showing how the human capacity for spontaneous order arises from social instincts and a moral sense shaped by natural selection in human evolutionary history. He has also developed a Darwinian argument for classical liberalism.http://www.cato-unbound.org/archives/july-2010-darwin-and-politics/ Recently, Arnhart finished writing the fourth edition of his book Political Questions: Political Philosophy from Plato to Pinker. He is working on a new book ‚Äî Darwinian Liberalism: The Evolutionary Science of Political Philosophy. This book will apply his Darwinian thinking to the history of political philosophy, while arguing for classical liberalism as supported by evolutionary science.

Publication history  The \\"Pilots Demobilized\\" story arc was published during the early fifties as three separate comic books. The first two, The Red Sea Traffickers (Les Traficants de la Mer Rouge) and Desert Pirates (Les Pirates du D√©sert), were published in 1951 and the closing novel, The Oil Gangsters (Les Gangsters du P√©trole), in 1952.Buck Danny They were combined into the \\"Pilots Demobilized\\" album when the series was republished during the nineties.  Plot  = The Red Sea Traffickers = Unemployed after the end of World War II, Buck Danny, Jerry Tumbler and Sonny Tuckson accept a job as commercial airline pilots for the Arabian Airways in the Middle-East. Due to company policy, they are forced to reach Port Said on their own. On the way from Cairo to Port Said, they save a young woman from a kidnapping. Out of gratitude, she gives them a lift, and they learn that she is a royal princess; her father is the Sheikh of the Oula√Ø, an independent tribe in the Arabian Peninsula. She indicates that if they ever need help in the region, they can always contact her. Once in Port Said, the trio takes an Arabian Airways flight to the company's main base in Arabia; on the way, the plane malfunctions, forcing Danny, Tumbler and Tuckson to take over and crash- land it on the base. Disgusted by the company's incompetence, they immediately tender their resignations, but Samuel Bronstein, the airline's CEO, informs them that they will continue to work for him until the price of the lost plane has been paid. To make matters worse, the three pilots soon discover that the company is using its planes to smuggle arms to several local Arab tribes. Due to the shortage of pilots, Bronstein decides to keep them employed anyway, but places them in the custody of a muscular Arab guard, Achmet, and divides their schedules to prevent any concerted escape. The situation seems hopeless, but a caravan comes into the base bringing an outsider, an Englishwoman who may not be all she seems... = The Desert Pirates = While Sonny is flying another mission, Danny and Tumbler are freed by the Englishwoman, who turns out to be an MI5 agent investigating the Arabian Airways. The three of them seek asylum at the palace of Emir Hussein, who controls the region, but he is revealed to be in cahoots with Bronstein; the illegal arms were meant to help him retake oil-rich territories from his rival, Sheikh Chekri El-Maahdi (whom Buck and Tumb recognize as the father of the princess they saved in Port Said). Despite this, they manage to stage another escape and return to the company headquarters disguised as their captors; there, they get into contact with Sonny as he returns from his mission. After knocking out his copilot, Sonny sets a rendez-vous with them on a base runway, where he picks them up and takes off again in a hail of bullets. Unfortunately, the aircraft is hit and crash-lands a few miles out, with the base personnel in hot pursuit. In the desert, the four escapees nearly die of thirst while evading their pursuers. However, they are spotted by a British reconnaissance aircraft, which quickly directs help to their position. The Arabian Airways thugs pursuing them are arrested, but when the British arrive at the company headquarters, they find it abandoned and dynamited; the planes and arms have left for another location, and Emir Hussein is also nowhere to be found. = The Oil Gangsters = A month after the events of the previous novel, Bronstein and Hussein are still at large, and to make matters worse, are now trying to kill the three heroes in retaliation for their escape. Buck suggests to the British authorities that they leave the base and seek protection from Sheikh El- Maahdi, who still has not been warned of the plot against him. Pemberton readily agrees, since he cannot help them anyway, the Oula√Ø being outside of the Crown's jurisdiction. Once in the Oula√Ø capital, the pilots meet with Princess Myriam, who obtains an audience with her father; they offer their assistance to the Sheikh, who gratefully accepts and charges them with restoring an abandoned Allied airfield and its fighters, which would grant the Oula√Ø a decisive advantage over Hussein's forces. In a matter of days, they become the pilots of what they dub the \\"Ghost Squadron;\\" however, unknown to the Sheikh, one of his courtiers, Sid Mohammed il-Feral, is betraying him for Bronstein. After locating Hussein's army, Buck, Tumb and Sonny begin strafing runs that severely disrupt his advance. However, the situation worsens when Feral convinces El-Maahdi to let him lead his men out of the capital and into combat; his actual purpose is to leave the city undefended, allowing Bronstein's cargo planes to land on a friendly airstrip and unload their troops. Danny, who suspected Feral's duplicity, takes steps to defend the capital; when Bronstein's planes arrive, the \\"Ghost Squadron\\" is awaiting them, shooting several of them down and sending the rest running. Meanwhile, Feral and Hussein's armies meet up in the desert, but the two leaders find themselves in conflict when they discover that Bronstein had promised El- Maahdi's throne to each of them separately. In the battle that follows, both are killed; Hussein's army is routed, while Feral's, left leaderless, simply returns to the city. The end of the threat sparks celebrations in the Oula√Ø capital, and el-Maahdi personally thanks the three Americans, who decide to return to New York for some well-deserved R&R.;  Behind the scenes  The plot of \\"Pilots Demobilized\\" was inspired by the discovery and development of Persian Gulf oil in the aftermath of World War II, and the cutthroat competition that resulted between British and American companies on the one hand, and their surrogates among the local clans and dynasties on the other, sometimes leading to real bloodshed. Charlier and Hubinon were especially inspired by the conflict in Abu Dhabi between the ruling Sheikh Shakbut, who favored British interests, and his brother Zayed, who was supported by the Saudi-American Aramco.\\"Les Pirates du D√©sert\\", editor's notes on the first page To date, the \\"Pilots Demobilized\\" trilogy remains the only one in which Buck, Tumb and Sonny are civilians and not employed by the U.S. military. This provoked a negative reaction from many fans, who had enjoyed the six preceding novels and found the characters much more dull in the world of international trafficking and economic espionage than they had been as war heroes.\\"Les Gangsters du P√©trole\\", editor's notes on the first page The authors took this lesson to heart; in the next novel, the trio were re-hired by the U.S. Air Force (and, three novels later, the Navy), and never left their uniform again.  Characters  * Buck Danny: the lead character, formerly a Major in the Flying Tigers. Before Pearl Harbor, he was employed as an engineer, but he has not kept current with the technological advances made during the war and his skills are no longer marketable. * Jerry \\"Tumb\\" Tumbler: formerly one of the best men in Danny's squadron, he is also unable to find work after the war. * Sonny Tuckson: another one of the aces in Danny's old squadron. Sonny enlisted at a very young age, and did not have any job skills after the war. Before signing on with the Arabian Airways, he is seen working for an Italian restaurant in New York, where he regales the guests with tales of his exploits and often breaks the dishware while reenacting them. * Samuel Bronstein: the villain. A ruthless businessman and arms dealer, he represents a powerful oil company, which created the Arabian Airways as a cover for their activities in the area. Bronstein leads the failed attempt to take over the Oula√Ø capital, where he is shot down by Buck Danny. * Major Pemberton: the local British commander, who does what he can to help the American pilots. He is a competent soldier, but his ability to act is limited by jurisdictional rules as well as the sheer size of the Arabian desert. * Muriel Hawthorne (aka Agent XB16): a female agent working for MI5 and investigating the illegal arms trafficking in the Arabian peninsula. Resourceful, fluent in Arabic and a crack shot with a handgun. * Myriam el-Maahdi: the princess of the Oula√Ø, who helps and is helped by Danny, Tumbler and Tuckson throughout the story. She was educated in the United States and is equally comfortable in Western and Arab worlds; she goes from wearing a business suit when the three pilots meet her in Port Said, to a niqab and abaya in the royal palace, to ordinary workman's clothes when she helps set up the Ghost Squadron. * Sheikh Chekri el-Maahdi: the ruler of the independent Oula√Ø tribe, in the Arabian peninsula. A fair minded man, he is open to Western ways and friendly towards the three Americans, but refuses to allow the use of his oil lands, whether by the British Empire or more unsavory types like Bronstein, for fear of exposing his people to exploitation. * Emir Hussein: a powerful ruler in the region. He once controlled the Oula√Ø territory, but was ousted by el-Maahdi, and swore to reconquer his land. To this end, he passes an alliance with Bronstein, promising him full access to the region's oil in exchange for the throne. * Sid Mohammed il-Feral: a powerful, power-hungry and xenophobic member of el- Maahdi's court. For years he has tried to court Myriam as a means to the throne, since the Sheikh has no male children. When Bronstein offers him a faster and more guaranteed alternative, he doesn't hesitate to take the offer. * Jake: the chief pilot of the company. An alcoholic with a short temper and very little in the way of brains or scruples, he is representative of the people employed by the Arabian Airways. * Achmet: a massive Arab guard whom Bronstein orders to make sure the American pilots stay put. Unable to take him on physically, Sonny is forced to find several creative ways to incapacitate or distract him.

He and his younger brother, Arthur Melmoth Walters, were known as \\"morning\\" and \\"afternoon\\" in allusion to their initials. The brothers were generally regarded as the finest fullbacks in England for a number of years; according to Philip Gibbons in his \\"History of the Game from 1863 to 1900\\" this was due mainly to their own defensive system based on the combination game used by the Royal Engineers during the early 1870s. Education Percy was born in Ewell, Surrey, the son of William Melmoth Walters, a solicitor, and attended Windlesham House School, then Charterhouse School, although he did not play for the latter's football team. He went up to Oriel College, Oxford, where he won a blue in 1885, when his brother was in the Cambridge team. Football career =Corinthian= In his final year at Oxford, Walters followed his younger brother and joined the Corinthian club which had been established three years earlier with a view to giving amateur players the opportunity to play together on a regular basis to improve the quality and strength of the England team. Percy joined the Easter tour in which five games were played in six days, playing in all five games, including the opening fixture against Preston North End on 6 April 1885, when he played at right-back with his brother Arthur alongside him on the left. This match was the first of many over the next six years in which the two brothers played alongside each other as the two full backs. Amongst the more significant matches were a 6‚Äì0 defeat of the FA Cup holders, Blackburn Rovers, in December 1885 and a 7‚Äì0 victory over Notts County in March 1886, when fellow Old Carthusian William Cobbold scored four goals. The brothers' final match together for Corinthian was on 8 November 1890 in an eight-goal victory over Sheffield in which younger brother H.M. Walters (who was only playing his second match) scored a hat-trick, with another goal from Percy. The other four goals came from V.G. Manns, who was playing his only match for Corinthian. Shortly after this match, the younger brother died from a football injury inflicted during a match and, in deference to their parents' wishes, both brothers retired from football to concentrate on their legal careers. The withdrawal of the Walters brothers from the Corinthian team had a significant effect on the team's performances as they were \\"extremely hard to replace, and Corinthian were destined to win only six of their next nineteen games\\". Despite the promise made to their parents, the brothers made a return to the Corinthians for a multi-sport tournament against the Barbarians rugby club in April 1892, although Percy did not play in the soccer match which Corinthian won 6‚Äì0, with Tinsley Lindley scoring a hat-trick. The clubs also played a rugby match, which Corinthian won 16‚Äì13, although the match was not a very serious encounter and was described by The Times newspaper as \\"a very amusing game\\".Quoted in The rugby match was followed by an athletics meeting in which C. B. Fry was prominent, winning both the long jump and high jump. Finally, the two clubs met a few weeks later in a cricket match in which Percy played alongside several other prominent Corinthians, including Fry, Lindley and Charles Wreford-Brown. During his time with the Corinthians, Walters made 54 appearances, scoring once. =Old Carthusians= After graduating in 1885, Walters joined the old-boys' team for his former school, the Old Carthusians. His major success came late in his time with the club, reaching the FA Amateur Cup final in 1895. =England= Percy and Arthur made their England debuts together on 28 February 1885 in a 4‚Äì0 victory over Ireland, with Percy at left back and Arthur on the right.England 4 ‚Äì Ireland 0; 28 February 1885 (Match summary) He first captained the England team, in only his third appearance, against Ireland on 13 March 1886, in the absence of the regular captain, Norman Coles Bailey. England \\"totally dominated the Irish\\" to record a 6‚Äì1 victory, with four goals from Benjamin Spilsbury.Ireland 1 ‚Äì England 6; 13 March 1886 (Match summary) In the next match against Scotland on 27 March 1886, nine of the eleven players selected were members of the Corinthian club, although all had their primary affiliation with other clubs. The match ended in a 1‚Äì1 draw, with England's being scored by fellow Corinthian Tinsley Lindley.Scotland 1 ‚Äì England 1; 27 March 1886 (Match summary) On 17 March 1888, Percy played at left-back (alongside Bob Howarth of Preston North End) when England achieved their first victory over Scotland since 1879. In \\"a brilliant display of attacking football\\" England were 5‚Äì0 winners, including two goals from Fred Dewhurst, thus securing their first victory on Scottish soil.Scotland 0 ‚Äì England 5; 17 March 1888 (Match summary) Percy made a total of thirteen appearances for England, five as captain, with his final match being against Scotland in the 1890 British Home Championship. The match ended 1‚Äì1,Scotland 1 ‚Äì England 1; 5 April 1890 (Match summary) and as a result England and Scotland shared the championship. Of the thirteen matches played for England, eight were won, three drawn (all against Scotland) and two were lost (also against Scotland). =Other= During his football career, Walters also played for East Sheen and Epsom in 1884 and 1885, was a founder member of Ewell F.C. together with his brother and John Henry Bridges in 1890 and also represented Surrey. He was a member of the F.A. committee in 1886, and a vice- president from 1891 to 1892. Life away from football Whilst at Oxford University, Walters made one appearance for the University cricket team in a match against the M.C.C. in May 1885, when he was the wicket-keeper. In his one innings, he scored nine runs in a drawn match.Oxford University v Marylebone Cricket Club; May 1885 (Match scorecard) Walters qualified as a barrister and was called to the bar in 1888. On top of his profession, he also served in the army as a volunteer and had been commissioned a lieutenant in the 3rd Surrey Rifle Volunteer Corps in June 1886 .

The SAMM is derived from the German Merinofleischschaf animals imported into South Africa from Europe in 1932, to improve the quality of wool and meat from sheep in South Africa. The Deutsche Fleisch Merino is a common meat sheep in Germany, Austria, and Poland. In South Africa, the German name was translated into Afrikaans as Duitse Vleis Merino and then into English as \\"German Mutton Merino\\". The South African breed was recognised as separate in 1971 when the name was changed to South African Mutton Merino. The SAMM has been developed as a versatile, hardy, polled dual-purpose breed. Ewes have a good maternal instinct and high milk production. Mature ewes will grow up to about and rams to over . Ewes will produce to of medium/strong wool. The wool is classified separately from the higher quality wool of Merinos, to avoid the risk of contamination of the latter with hair and kemp fibre from the SAMM wool.The Land Stock Types, Rural Press, North Richmond, NSW The SAMM is bred specifically to produce a slaughter lamb at an early age ( at 100 days of age). In judging SAMMs the emphasis is on conformation (in relation to producing meat), 60%, and not on the animal's wool (40%). SAMM rams have almost entirely replaced British breeds as terminal sires in the harsh regions of South Africa, where they (and their hybrids) are more adaptable than the former breeds. They were first imported into Australia in 1996. Also in 1996, Peggy Newman imported SAMM embryos from South Africa creating the first SAMM flock in Canada. In 1999, Dwight and Gwendolyn Kitzan from Nisland, South Dakota ‚Äì USA, imported one of Newman‚Äô embryo SAMM ram and have been developing the SAMM breed in the United States using top Australian SAMM producers bloodlines.

The novel was translated into English in 2005.  Plot introduction  The subject of Outcast is a Jewish convert to Islam, Ahmad (Haroun) Soussan, based on the historical figure, Ahmad (Nissim) Soussa. After converting in the 1930s the real-life Soussa became a tool for propaganda under the Ba'athist regime. Ballas presents Soussan in a sympathetic light, giving voice to his complex relations with his Jewish family and friends, and his struggle as he moves from genuine conviction in Islam to the realization that he will never be fully at home in the Muslim sphere, just as he was not comfortable in the Jewish sphere. Ballas' treatment of Soussan suggests that the reader should attempt to comprehend the quandaries faced by those few Jews who sought to remain in Iraq in the years after 1948.  Explanation of title  In Hebrew the novel is titled \\"V Hu Aher\\" ('And He is An Other,' or 'And He is a Different One') an apt expression of Soussan's ambiguous status between Jewish and Muslim identity, as a Jewish convert to Islam whose Jewishness is exploited for propaganda purposes by his cohorts within the Ba'athist political sphere. The word \\"Aher\\" refers to the ancient Jewish figure of Elisha ben Abuya, an apostate rabbi.  Reception  The reception of Outcast in Israel was hardly positive to begin with, although it has been widely recognized elsewhere as a veritable compendium of information about Iraq from the 1930s to the 1980s. For this reason, some say that Outcast should be regarded as more of an Iraqi, than Israeli, novel, notwithstanding the fact that it was originally written in Hebrew and that Arab-Jewish authors have historically suffered a paltry audience in the Arabic-speaking world.

Located on Jabal Amman, the Mango House is an example of a new style of Jordanian architecture and differs greatly from the houses built in the area during the 1920s and 30s, as well as from its 1940s contemporaries. The house is built with smooth rose stone and has numerous wrap-around balconies. A similarity to other 1940s houses is the clear separation of rooms, instead of using a more traditional tripartite plan. The Mango House is built in two separate halves, so as to accommodate the two brothers living there when it was built. History The Mango House was built in the late 1940s by the brothers Kamal and Ali Mango, sons of Hamdi Mango, who were part of one of Amman's primary business dynasties during the era. Built on Omar bin al- Khattab Street (later dubbed Mango Street), the house was close in location to several other houses, south of Habboo and Akrawi House, and across the street from al-Mufti House.

Wilson. In 1854, Wilson formed George F. Wilson & Co., a chemical merchandising firm in Providence, Rhode Island. That same year, Wilson approached Eben Horsford with the goal of expanding to develop and manufacture chemical products. Their first plant, in Pleasant Valley, Rhode Island, manufactured calcium sulfite. Horsford's first patent used calcium sulfite to neutralize chlorine in bleached fabrics. In 1856 the plant was moved from Pleasant Valley to Seekonk, Massachusetts. The same year, Horsford received a patent for production of \\"pulverulent phosphoric acid\\" (calcium acid phosphate), an ingrediant for baking powder. In 1859, the company was incorporated in Massachusetts as the Rumford Chemical Works. Its name honored Sir Benjamin Thompson, Count Rumford, who had established the chair held by Horsford at Harvard. After the boundary line between Massachusetts and Rhode Island was recalculated in 1861, the East Seekonk area became East Providence, Rhode Island. The Rumford Chemical Works was chartered again in Rhode Island in 1862. The company eventually built an extensive complex of buildings centered on the junction of Newman and Greenwood Avenues with North Broadway. Its main section originally extended eastward from this junction to a pond which has since been filled in and built over with apartments. The company's most successful product was Rumford baking powder. Hulman & Company acquired the Rumford Chemical Works in 1950 and still makes Rumford baking powder, now at its facility in Terre Haute, Indiana.

The Quaker (Society of Friends) meetinghouse was built in 1703‚Äì04, consisting of a modest, nearly rectangular wood frame structure. An expansion to the building was added c. 1745, joining a larger two-story structure to the old one. Moses Brown and Samuel Slater, credited with founding Slater Mill, often described as the start of the American Industrial Revolution, were members either of Providence Friends Meeting, Saylesville Friends Meeting or Smithfield Friends Meeting House, Parsonage and Cemetery‚Äîsources are unclear. Providence Meeting is most likely because of its proximity to Moses Brown's farm, but Slater Mill is also reasonably close to the Saylesville Meetinghouse. Stephen Hopkins, a signer of the Declaration of Independence, was married to Anna Smith in this meetinghouse in 1755. Elizabeth Buffum Chace, member from 1836‚Äì1841, prominent Quaker abolitionist and possible Underground Railroad station master, lived in nearby Central Falls. Architecture The meetinghouse was built of medieval construction techniques, as Rhode Island was somewhat behind European civilization at the time. The newer two-story eastern section's hand-cut eight inch beams may have been re-purposed from a barn. The newer section was designed so that any parishioner speaking on the floor of the meetinghouse could be heard by people in the second floor balcony sections. The western section features irregularly sized hand cut floor boards. Saylesville Friends Meeting was founded by religious refugees who came to live at the very edge of the British empire. The meetinghouse's architecture is uniformly plain, with nothing ornate, in keeping with a Quaker dislike of religious ostentation. Quaker unprogrammed worship has no pastor and anyone may be moved to speak. For this reason the meeting room's benches are placed in roughly a square arrangement. However, it was expected that certain elders of the meeting were likely to speak more often, and so two benches were built on the north wall, known as the facing bench and the back bench. All three balconies have a reasonable view of the facing bench and the back bench. In later years the three balconies were enclosed and turned into First Day (Sunday) school rooms. Friends in the 18th century believed in separate but ostensibly equal business meetings for men and for women, followed by a combined business meeting for finalizing the meeting minutes. The meetinghouse was designed with panels that swung up onto specially designed iron hooks, in order to combine the two business meetings as needed. On the east edge of the property is an ancient stone platform designed so that a person could walk up a ramp while leading a horse, then mount the horse easily. The meetinghouse was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. It is one of the oldest surviving Quaker meeting houses in New England. The meetinghouse continues to be used each First Day at 10:30 a.m. as a Friends Meetinghouse, in the unprogrammed tradition of Friends' worship. The Saylesville worship group is part of Providence Monthly Meeting of Friends. The 1755 wedding certificate of Stephen Hopkins, signer of the Declaration of Independence In 2017 the meetinghouse was used by an outside group for a 19th-century-themed marriage re-commitment ceremony. The meetinghouse has been used for several annual Rhode Island Sacred Harp sings. For the past several decades, the meetinghouse has held an annual candlelight meeting for worship on December 24 at 4:30 p.m. Saylesville Friends (Quaker) Meetinghouse in Lincoln, Rhode Island See also *List of the oldest buildings in Rhode Island *National Register of Historic Places listings in Providence County, Rhode Island *Saylesville Historic District, encompassing part of the mill village it stands outside of *Great Road Historic District, district of colonial and 19th-century homes to the north References External links *Friends Meeting info Category:Quaker meeting houses in Rhode Island Category:Churches on the National Register of Historic Places in Rhode Island Category:Churches completed in 1704 Category:Buildings and structures in Lincoln, Rhode Island Category:Churches in Providence County, Rhode Island Category:18th-century Quaker meeting houses Category:National Register of Historic Places in Providence County, Rhode Island Category:1704 establishments in Rhode Island ","title":"Saylesville Meetinghouse"},{"id":"17351204","text":"The Sheldon House is a historic house located in Cranston, Rhode Island.

It is a predominantly residential area, densely populated, which was developed most heavily in the late 19th century. It is bounded roughly by Broad Street to the east, the Pawtucket city line to the south, Dexter Street to the west, and Rand Street and Jenks Park to the north. It has 377 contributing buildings, most of which were built before 1920. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1991. Although the district is predominantly residential, it has a modest number of non-residential civic, religious, and industrial buildings. The only industrial facility is the Hemphill Mill on Dexter Street, a four-story brick structure built in 1909. There are three church buildings, two of which still see ecclesiastical use: St. George's Episcopal is a stone church built in 1922, and there is a wood-frame Queen Anne-style church building at 161-165 Cross Street which was built in 1893 and has served several Protestant congregations. Two school buildings survive: the Central Street School, an Italianate wood-frame structure built in 1881 which is separately listed on the National Register, and the present Central Falls City Hall, an imposing brick building built as a high school in 1889 with Queen Anne styling, when the area was still part of Lincoln. The Adams Library building is a Classical Revival structure built in 1910. The housing in the district consists mainly of vernacular wood frame structures with one to three units. Architectural embellishments are typically modest, following the style of the time, resulting in a significant number of modest worker cottages with some Italianate styling, which predominated during the early period of the area's development. Large single-family houses are comparatively rare in the district; the most notable one is the Samuel B. Conant House, a Colonial Revival house built in 1895 for a Pawtucket printshop owner.

This is intended to show the battery is 'original Nokia' and not a cheaper imitation. A hologram label on a paper box for security Security holograms are labels with a hologram printed onto it for sale security reasons. Holograms on security labels are very difficult to forge because they are replicated from a master hologram which requires expensive, specialized and technologically advanced equipment. They are used widely in several banknotes around the world, in particular those that are of high denominations. They are also used in passports, credit and bank cards as well as quality products. Herman Lopata, the President of the New York-based Automatic Toll Systems, Inc., received a patent in 1987 for the credit card security hologram as part of his early work on high speed highway toll collection‚Äîthe predecessor of the modern EZ Pass type equipment. Holograms are classified into different types with reference to the degree of level of optical security incorporated in them during the process of master origination. The different classifications are described below: 2D / 3D \\"hologram\\" images These are by far the most common type of hologram ‚Äì and in fact they are not holograms in any true sense of the words. The term \\"hologram\\" has taken on a secondary meaning due to the widespread use of a multilayer image on credit cards and driver licenses. This type of \\"hologram\\" consists of two or more images stacked in such a way that each is alternately visible depending upon the angle of perspective of the viewer. The technology here is similar to the technology used for the past 50 years to make red safety night reflectors for bicycles, trucks, and cars. These holograms (and therefore the artwork of these holograms) may be of two layers (i.e. with a background and a foreground) or three layers (with a background, a middle ground and a foreground). In the case of the two-layer holograms, the matter of the middle ground is usually superimposed over the matter of the background of the hologram. These holograms display a unique multilevel, multi-colour effect. These images have one or two levels of flat graphics ‚Äúfloating‚Äù above or at the surface of the hologram. The matter in the background appears to be under or behind the hologram, giving the illusion of depth. Dot matrix These holograms have a maximum resolution of 10 micrometres per optical element and are produced on specialized machines making forgery difficult and expensive. To design optical elements, several algorithms are used to shape scattered radiation patterns.  Flip flop  Flip-flop hologram master origination is a technique used to produce holograms that display flip-flop effect. They are produced used 2D/3D master shooting system. This two channel effect of 2D/3D holograms displays two different images from different angles. These holograms are often fabricated using supreme quality material. The final master obtained from this flip-flop mastering technique are used to manufacture holograms which gives flip-flop effects. Having an excellent blend of 2D/3D and flipping images offers holographic images an excellent depth and a dazzling appeal. Electron-beam lithography  These types of hologram are created using highly sophisticated and very expensive electron-beam lithography systems. This kind of technology allows the creation of surface holograms with a resolution of up to 0.1 micrometres (254,000 dpi). This technique requires development of various algorithms for designing optical elements that shapes scattered radiation patterns. This type of hologram offers features like the viewing of four lasers at a single point, 2D/3D raster text, switch effects, 3D effects, concealed images, laser readable text and true colour images. The various kinds of features possible in security holograms are mentioned below: =Concealed images= These usually take the form of very thin lines and contours. Concealed images can be seen at large angle light diffraction, and at one particular angle only. =Guilloch√© patterns (high resolution line patterns)= These are sets of thin lines of a complicated geometry (guilloch√© patterns) drawn with high resolution. The technology allows continuous visual changes of colour along each separated lines. =Kinetic images= They can be seen when the conditions of hologram observations are being changed. Turning or inclining the hologram allows the movements of certain features of the image to be studied. =Microtexts or nanotexts= Dot matrix holograms are capable of embedding microtext at various sizes. There are three types of microtexts in holograms: high contrast microtexts of size 50 ‚Äì 150 micrometres; diffractive grating filled microtexts of size 50 ‚Äì 150 micrometres low contrast microtexts. Microtexts of sizes smaller than 50 micrometres are referred to as nanotext. Nanotext with sizes of less than 50 micrometres can be observed with a microscope only. =Covert laser readable images= Dot matrix holograms also support covert laser readable (CLR) imagery, where a simple laser device may be used to verify the hologram's authenticity. Computing CLR images is a complicated mathematical task that involves solving ill-posed problems. There are two types of CLR: Dynamic CLR and Multigrade CLR. Dynamic CLR is a set of CLR fragments that produce animated images on the screen as the control device moves along the hologram surface. Multigrade CLR images produce certain images on the screen of the controlling device, which differ in the first and minus first orders of laser light diffraction. As a variant, a hidden image which is both negative and positive, in plus one and minus one order respectively, may be created. More recently, novel computer-generated holograms have been proposed working with structured light carrying phase singularities . Such optical elements further improve the security level, since the encoded information only appears when the input illumination is endowed with the correct intensity and phase distribution. =Computer-synthesized 2D/3D and 3D images= This technology allows 2D / 3D images to be combined with other security features (microtexts, concealed images, CLR etc.) This combination effect cannot be achieved using any other traditional technologies of origination. 2D/3D hologram masters are developed in 2D/3D master shooting lab that incorporates highly sensitive machines and advanced equipment such as microprocessor-controlled automatic positioning equipment, optical table, He-Cd laser, laser power controller, silver coatings and other related technologies. The final master obtained from 2D/3D mastering is used to manufacture 2D/3D hologram stickers. These stickers consist of a multitude of two-dimensional layers with images placed one behind the other thereby offering excellent depth. These stickers are colorful images with 3D depth between different layers. =True colour images= True colour images are very effective decorative pictures. When synthesized by a computer, they may include microtexts, hidden images, and other security features, yielding attractive, high-security holograms. True Color hologram masters can be produced using 2D/3D master shooting system. The final master obtained from this mastering technique comprises true photographic images like images of people, animals, flags, etc. This type of holograms can‚Äôt be duplicated if in case they can‚Äôt obtain the original photo. True color holograms are one of the best ways to prevent counterfeiters from duplicating.

The mineral is named from the Greek, chalco \\"copper\\" and fyllon, \\"leaf\\", in allusion to its composition and platy structure. It is a classic Cornish mineral that can be confused with tabular spangolite. Formula Two different formulae are quoted in the literature for chalcophyllite, (molar mass 3098 g) and (molar mass 2956 g). The difference reflects the fact that the water content varies at room temperature based on relative humidity. Unit cell Chalcophyllite crystallizes in the trigonal crystal class, 3 2/m with space group R 3m or with space group R . Some authors choose a unit cell with three formula units per cell (Z=3), and some a smaller unit cell with only 1.5 formula units per cell (Z=1.5). For the larger unit cell a = 10.77 √Ö, c = 57.5 √Ö, Z=3.Corbett (1973) American Mineralogist 58: 792‚Äì793 For the smaller unit cell c is only half as long, a = 10.756 √Ö, c = 28.678 √Ö, Z = 1.5. Crystal habit Crystals are platy, six-sided and flattened perpendicular to the c crystal axis, and may be striated triangularly on these flattened faces. It may form rosettes, or be drusy, foliated or massive. Physical properties Chalcophyllite from Lemhi County, Idaho Cleavage is perfect perpendicular to the c crystal axis, and twinning occurs with {1010} as the twin plane. Fracture is irregular. The mineral is soft, with hardness only 2, the same as gypsum. Specific gravity is generally given in the range 2.67 to 2.69, but Webmineral has 2.4 to 2.66. Chalcophyllite is soluble in acids and in ammonia. It is not fluorescent, nor radioactive. The water content varies at room temperature based on relative humidity. Chalcophyllite alters to chrysocolla, which is a copper-aluminium silicate with the formula . Optical properties Many copper minerals are blue or green in color; chalcophyllite is blue-green to emerald-green, with a pale green streak and vitreous to subadamantine luster, pearly on {0001}. Crystals are transparent to translucent. It is uniaxial (-) with refractive indices nœâ = 1.618 to 1.632 and nŒµ = 1.552 to 1.575. Indices of refraction vary markedly depending on the relative humidity since the water content varies at ambient temperature. It is pleochroic with O blue-green and E almost colorless. Environment Chalcophyllite is an uncommon secondary mineral occurring in the oxidized zones of some arsenic-bearing hydrothermal copper deposits. Associated minerals include azurite, malachite, brochantite, chrysocolla, spangolite, connellite, cuprite, cyanotrichite, strashimirite, parnauite, lavendulan, cornubite, langite, clinoclase, pharmacosiderite and mansfieldite. The type material is conserved at the Mining Academy, Freiberg, Germany. Notable occurrences include the Majuba Hill Mine, Antelope District, Nevada, US and Cornwall, including Wheal Gorland, UK.

Crewe Hall dining room  Gradual emergence  For many years Gothic architecture had been moving toward the low lines of the Tudor style, somewhat impelled by the widespread effects of the Italian trecento. Yet the physical and mental insularity of England made absolute change a very slow process, and it was not entirely achieved during the reign of Elizabeth I. Thus, instead of the exquisite lightness of the pointed and ogee arches, an arch from the time of Henry VIII barely lifts itself above the level of a straight lintel, under square spandrels. The effects of the Italian Renaissance spread slowly to England, although the Artists of the Tudor court included many immigrants from more advanced milieus. Pietro Torrigiano, Holbein and others were in touch with the latest movements on the Continent. Long after that Shakespeare finds occasion to speak of King Hal himself having had a taste for novelty and splendor that leaned kindly to foreign fashions, and the pageantry of the era of James I, that \\"wisest fool in Europe,\\" not having wrought immediate effect with the quips and conceits through which eventually the Elizabethan degenerated into the Jacobean. And if the movement was tardy even then, it was still slower in the previous Tudor era that three-quarters of a century just preceding the precise Elizabethan era. In spite of a few articles of Renaissance furniture procured abroad for the royal family or some of the high nobility, a barbarous mixture of the old and new yet prevailed in England at the period when France enjoyed the accomplished Henry II style, and when Italy reveled in the perfect fantasies of the Italian cinquecento. The term Elizabethan has been used distinctively in relation to the Renaissance, rather than exactly in relation to the English styles; for it really began some years before Elizabeth was born and extended over some years after she died, only then receiving its full development. It is not quite possible to fix the exact limits of the different variations of any main style, one shade overlapping and blending with another. Thus there are chairs with the exceedingly high and narrow backs and small square seats which are called Elizabethan, but which were in use with much the same ornament for an indefinite previous period, and there are palaces and country seats built in Elizabeth's last days, but decorated with the additional characteristics more particularly belonging to the Jacobean. In the Louvre and old armory the upper portion is pierced in all the Gothic foliations of the Flamboyant, while the lower portion is decorated with panels carved in all the richest caprices of the cinquecento.  Classic influence  Attempts at classicism are everywhere in the Elizabethan. Once in a while in a mantelpiece the attempt is almost a success, and the result an exceedingly stately and beautiful object with channeled columns, architrave, and frieze. But poorly executed work has a few pillars and pilasters with misunderstood details, a strap often clasped and buckled about them, some clumsy scrolls and rosettes, with masks and busts of the ancients, scattered ill-drawn human figures, and here and there huge terms, heads rising from flat vases, or pedestals narrowing at the base. The Great Bed in Saracen's Head. Grecian columns of singular disproportion form the main structure of bedsteads, tables, and cabinets. These columns are noted for their clumsy thickness, and in one of the first misapprehensions of the classic that mark the style, they rise from huge spherical clusters of foliage, usually the acanthus. At about half their length, these columns are frequently broken by another huge spherical cluster; on this sometimes half the foliage growing downward, half growing upward, and divided in the middle by a careful strap and buckle; occasionally the upper half of this globe is absent. The lower part of the columns is often covered with arabesques, and the upper half merely fluted, or else covered with a fine imbricate carving. In some of the tables, instead of columns, a sort of caryatid ‚Äî female half-figure, neither exactly sphinx nor monster, dressed out in straps and ending in rude scrolls ‚Äî formed the support at each of the four corners. The tables thus upheld were mighty constructions, sometimes they can be pulled apart in an extension, but oftener bound by firm crossbars and almost immovable through their weight. In the cabinets the lower part was usually a closed cupboard, paneled and ornamented, with terms between the different divisions, the figure issuing from the vase being now a head only, and now two-thirds of the whole; the top projected, and was upheld by the big columns; and all the surfaces were enriched with sculptures after the approved fashion. Of the bedsteads with heavy canopies and cornices, the Great Bed of Ware follows the styles, although it is a caricature in size. Sir Toby Belch speaks of this piece of furniture when he advises Sir Andrew Aguecheek: \\"And as many lies as will lie in thy sheet of paper, although the sheet were big enough for the Bed of Ware in England, set 'em down; go about it.\\" Still, it is to be remembered that its twelve foot square size was not at all unusual, and was matched by other beds on the Continent. Although its curious translation of classic shapes is significant, the strap and buckle predominate over everything else.  Strap and buckle  Strapwork, together with shieldwork, was very prominent in the Henry II style. It was a method of ornament particularly applicable to jewelry and work in gold. Cellini used it entirely. \\"I therefore made four small figures of boys,\\" says he, \\"with four little grotesques, which completed the ring; and I added to it a few fruits and ligatures in enamel, so that the jewel and the ring appeared admirably suited to each other.\\" Both in the French and the Italian work the method was mingled with better classic detail, and with finer natural imitation, but hardly in the Saracenic itself was the tracery so prominent as in the Elizabethan. If the type was meager, its play of line was infinite: curve led to curve, intricacy to intricacy, and over all ornamented surfaces, the scrolls that supported other forms ‚Äî panels or scutcheons or masks ‚Äî the figures, the faceted jewel forms, opened into successions and sequences of interlacing and escaping straps and ribbons, and transformed into the representation of all the gay buckling and harnessing of chivalry. These ribbons and straps and buckles were always flat in surface, however curved in shape and situation, and they rose from their background at right angles as actual straps would if laid on flatly, not using contrasts of light and shade, but seeking only the effect of line chasing line. When the use of the cartouche became more general, one form of light and shade came to the assistance of this sort of ornament, for the supports of the shield were frequently pierced with countless openings, crescent-shaped, lozenged, circular, rectangular, apparently in a mere haphazard openwork, but revealed in an overall view as repeating the straps and ribbons again with the contours of their perforation. While this pierced shieldwork, with its innumerable flat and curved planes, came afterward to assume more importance in the Jacobean, there was nothing of the Elizabethan that was not ornamented with the strapwork in some form or other. Chair made from Drake's ship The vast screens between the sides of rooms or walls themselves were filled with flourishes of this carven tracery, as seen in Crewe Hall. Even of the ceilings conformed to the carved style. There are few grander effects in interior decoration than the intersecting curves and angles of a lofty old Elizabethan ceiling. Of course, in the use of the strap and shield, heraldry and its escutcheons and crests entered largely into the ornament of the Elizabethan. The ensigns armorial, set in all shapes and surrounded by all the curious mantling to be devised, appeared everywhere in conjunction with the family motto and with the intertwined initials of husband and wife, over gateways, over doorways, on dead-wall, over the fireplace; and stairways were decorated with carved monsters sitting on the baluster-tops and holding before them the family arms, frequently looking as if they had just escaped from one of the quarterings. Even such a room sometimes had stylistic mixtures such as wainscots which were set in the little square panels or in the parchment panels of the preceding reigns, or in the round-arched panels peculiar to the Elizabethan itself ‚Äî miniature and open representations of which are to be seen on the back of the chair made from the wood of Sir Francis Drake's ship.  Absorbing of Gothic  Nevertheless, in the Elizabethan the Gothic is never quite forgotten. Its vertical lines are always breaking through the horizontal of the invading classic; its reverend monsters look with special unkindness on the fantasticism of the new monsters that Cellini described as the promiscuous breed of animals and flowers; its ornaments insist upon their right before the Grecian; in architecture its gables still rise, although with a skyline gnawed out by the scrolls as worms gnaw out the sides of a leaf; and in furniture its cove surmounts the tops of those cabinets whose fronts are the facades of temples. The steadfast English mind clung to the old order of things, and relinquished with reluctance the last relics of a style that had been for centuries a part of its life. If it must have the egg and dart, it would keep the Tudor flower too. Thus all the Renaissance that came into England, after the bloody Wars of the Roses made it possible to think of art and luxury, paid toll to the Gothic on the way, and the result was a singular miscellany, for its Gothic had now forgotten, and its Renaissance had never known why it had existed. It is rather the talent with which the medley of material was handled, the broad masses, yet curious elaboration, and the scale of magnificence, that give the style its charm rather than anything in its original and bastard composition.  Influence of the Low Countries  Flemish table. The Renaissance of the Elizabethan came into England by way of the Low Countries. The importation of furniture into England from Flanders and Holland was so significant that a hundred years earlier a law was enacted forbidding the practice ‚Äî nevertheless carved woodwork was one of the important articles of commerce with the Low Countries, and the country homes of England of this period were filled with articles of Dutch and Flemish workmanship. Historical influences include: * Residence in England of numbers of exiles fleeing from Spanish oppression and events such as Sack of Antwerp. * The occupation of the Netherlands by English forces during the Dutch Revolt. * English sympathy with the struggles may have affected the fashion. Whether from any of these causes or from purely commercial ones, what became part of the Elizabethan furniture style was the top-heavy and overloaded Dutch cabinet and the table with big columnar legs capable of upholding mighty serving dishes, and both covered with Flemish ornament. Many forgeries in the style were made in Holland long afterward due to their high value. It is this importation and custom that accounts for something of the character of the Elizabethan articles; for the Flemings, although fond of magnificence, and accustomed to all the splendor of the Burgundian court, never became absolute masters of the fully developed Italian style. Nor was the Fleming so thoroughly the master of his materials that his execution quite answered his ideas. Both German and Spanish workmanship came much nearer to the complete spirit of the Renaissance, the latter leaving little to be desired. The Flemish is, however, generally held to be the most dramatic carving of the North. Although the French handled the human figure lightly and fancifully their drawing was apt to be incorrect, such as in giving too much weight and size to the head. Yet after some years the Flemish work became less dignified and desirable. It was lumbered with turned work sawed in half and glued on, with panels overlaying and intersecting each other at odd angles, and with cumbrous pendants under the corners, all of which work was injurious, and much of which was ugly. In the later period of the Elizabethan, the Italians themselves may have supplied artists and workmen for the furniture, but they must have worked hampered by the tastes and prejudices existing around them. A certain rudeness of carving prevails throughout the earlier part of the style, and is considered to give breadth of effect. The old carvers hid none of the means by which they gained their ends, and left even the tool marks in full sight.  Scallop shell  In that portion of the Elizabethan which is often considered as the Jacobean, although it was but the completer development of the former, the globular excrescences of the columns elongated themselves into equally vast and far uglier acorn-shaped supports. A good deal of inlaid work was then used, and the carving did its best to reach and render the ideas of the cinquecento. It is, indeed, styled the cinquecento period of English art, every surface being rough with arabesques of griffins, vases, rosettas, dolphins, scrolls, foliages, Cupids, and mermaids with double tails curling round them on either side. Meantime the cartouche and its straps ‚Äî ligatures they were called in Italy, cuirs in France and Flanders, were still often used. Scallop shells received a particular share of favor, having been recently brought home from foreign seas, and was immediately seized by the designers in need of other shapes. The Flemings made seats that enclosed the sitter in the valves of this scallop, carved just rudely enough to excuse their eccentricity. Settees were made at this time whose backs consisted of several just such immense scallops as those of these Holland House Gilt Chamber chairs; and the same idea of decoration peeps out in fan-like frills at every spare corner of the Neo- Jacobean revival of the style. These shell forms of furniture might befit an oceanside home, but they must have been singularly out of place on dry land and among the huge and heavy articles that surrounded them in the Jacobean mansions. Jacobean court-cupboard There was something, on the whole, in the early Elizabethan replete with dignity, a massy magnificence that agreed with that of the era and the monarch, that went well, too, with the mighty farthingales and ruffs of the ladies, the trunk-hose and puffed and banded doublets of the gallants, while the people who used it ‚Äî Shakespeare, Walter Raleigh, Ben Jonson, Francis Bacon ‚Äî still have a peculiar interest. Well as it suited doughy old Queen Bess herself, the forms which it took under her successor, with their assumption of foreign conceits and their display of profuse gilding, accorded no less characteristically with the arrogant, pedantic, and petty James. All of this furniture, however, is exceedingly attractive, and there are few who would not rejoice over any article of it which is not too unwieldy for modern quarters. A typical sideboard and dresser offer a medley of design, with not too well drawn fawns and satyrs, fruits and flowers, Cupids, birds, scrolls, shields and straps, cornucopias, mermaids, monsters and foliages. They belong to the beginning of the later period. It was no light matter to clear the floor for the dance of the Capulets when the servant cried \\"Away with the joint-stools, remove the court-cupboard, look to the plate!\\".  Porcelain and mirrors  By the close of the Jacobean era, the style held its own with slight variation and innovation, for some reigns. The execution of the carving was coarse and careless during the time of the first Stuarts, but afterward rose to be classed with the finest known; inlaid work, also, was more freely used and attained much excellence. There was increasing prevalent luxury in every thing. Fine pottery, for instance, became more frequent; for although glass had been made in London under Elizabeth's patronage, \\"porselyn\\" was rare, and even earthenware was not then very general, gold and silver plate making the vessels of the rich, and pewter mugs and platters and wooden trenchers being still those of the poor, while mention is made of \\"five dishes of earth painted, such as are brought from Venice,\\" which were presented to the queen as something unusual; and it was thought a gift not unworthy of royalty when Lord Burleigh offered her a \\"porringer of white porselyn garnished with gold.\\" The first use of the famous Dutch tiles is thought to belong to the reign of Charles I. Elizabethan mirror. Mirrors, which were very rare in Elizabeth's time, became more common in that of the Charleses, the Duke of Buckingham, during the reign of the second Charles, bringing a colony of Venetian glassmakers to Lambeth. One Elizabethan mirror is some three and a half by four and a half feet in size ‚Äî five feet was the largest made till the latter part of the eighteenth century ‚Äî the frame is carved in oak and partially gilt, and the glass is set flatly. In one mirror of the time of Charles II the glass is beveled, and in the glasses of the Merry Monarch's predecessor the frames were so made as to throw the glass forward and give it projection. Quicksilvered glass itself, unset, became a novelty, so that sometimes whole rooms, and even the ceilings, were lined with it. The mirrors made by the duke's colony were of superior excellence; they had an inch-wide bevel all along their outer extremity, whether they were rectangular or curved. \\"This,\\" says Mr. Pollen, \\"gives preciousness and prismatic light to the whole glass. It is of great difficulty in execution, the plate being held by the workman over his head, and the edge cut by grinding. The feats of skill in this kind, in the form of interrupted curves and short lines and angles, are rarely accomplished by modern workmen, and the angle of the bevel itself is generally too acute, whereby the prismatic light produced by this portion of the mirror is in violent and too showy contrast to the remainder.\\" Wall hangings had been long in use ‚Äî the leather, the damask, velvent, and arras or tapestry. The Flemish tapestries, from the time of their first manufacture, were in great favor. Elizabeth had a set wrought signalizing the dispersion and destruction of the Spanish Armada. So fine had they become that they were often preferred to other decoration, and in the Stuart time were stretched across the noble old carved panelwork itself. \\"Here I saw the new fabric of French tapestry,\\" wrote Evelyn, in the last years of Charles II, concerning the Gobelins tapestry, established under the royal patronage in France: \\"for design, tenderness of work, and incomparable imitation of the best paintings, beyond any thing I had ever beheld. Some pieces had Versailles, St. Germains, and other palaces of the French king, with huntings, figures, and landscapes, exotic fowls, and all to the life rarely done.\\" Yet works in tapestry had been, long before this, under royal protection in England also, the Raphael cartoons having been purchased by Charles I for the use of the Mortlake Tapestry Works, which, however, did not outlast that sovereign more than half a century; and the employment of draperies had become so profuse that they now largely took the place of the heavy paneled wooden tops which had so long encumbered the bedsteads.

It uses new materials such as zirconium dioxide which is a superior insulator reducing current leakages. Using zirconium dioxide instead of silicon dioxide, this transistor can reduce the current leakage, and thus reduces power consumption while still working at higher speed and using lower voltages. One element of this structure is a \\"depleted substrate transistor,\\" which is a type of CMOS device where the transistor is built in an ultra-thin layer of silicon on top of an embedded layer of insulation. This ultra-thin silicon layer is fully depleted to maximize drive current when the transistor is turned on, allowing the transistor to switch on and off faster. In contrast, when the transistor is turned off, unwanted current leakage is minimized by the thin insulating layer. This allows the depleted substrate transistor to have 100 times less leakage than traditional silicon-on-insulator schemes. Another innovation of Intel's depleted substrate transistor is the use of low resistance contacts on top of the silicon layer. The transistor can therefore be very small, very fast and consume less power. Another important element is the development of a new material that replaces silicon dioxide on the wafer. All transistors have a \\"gate-dielectric,\\" a material that separates a transistor's \\"gate\\" from its active region (the gate controls the on-off state of the transistor).

Route description View near the south end of SR 445 in Sparks looking northbound SR 445 begins at the intersection of Nugget Avenue and Pyramid Way in Sparks. From there, it passes under Interstate 80 directly to the north and skirts the eastern edge of Victorian Square in downtown Sparks as it continues heading almost due north. After about , the road curves slightly to the northeast to serve as the primary link to the rapidly expanding northern valleys of Sparks, including Spanish Springs. Once outside of urban Sparks, SR 445 transitions to Pyramid Lake Road, more commonly referred to as Pyramid Highway. The rural highway is four lanes for a seven-mile stretch passing through Spanish Springs. The road narrows to two lanes entering the more sparsely populated Palamino Valley north to Pyramid Lake. As the road turns more sharply northeast, it enters the Pyramid Lake Indian Reservation. Shortly thereafter, the road curves northwest as it intersects State Route 446, following the western shore of Pyramid Lake. The highway passes through Sutcliffe and then comes to an end at Warrior Point Park Road, north of the town. History The first two miles (3 km) of State Route 445 in Sparks was originally designated State Route 32, with the remainder of the route comprising most of former State Route 33.

Natural geographical features consist of landforms and ecosystems. For example, terrain types (physical factors of the environment) are natural geographical features. Conversely, human settlements or other engineered forms are considered types of artificial geographical features. Natural geographical features =Ecosystems = There are two different terms to describe habitats: ecosystem and biome. An ecosystem is a community of organisms. In contrast, biomes occupy large areas of the globe and often encompass many different kinds of geographical features, including mountain ranges. Biotic diversity within an ecosystem is the variability among living organisms from all sources, including inter alia, terrestrial, marine and other aquatic ecosystems. Living organisms are continually engaged in a set of relationships with every other element constituting the environment in which they exist, and ecosystem describes any situation where there is relationship between organisms and their environment. Biomes represent large areas of ecologically similar communities of plants, animals, and soil organisms. Biomes are defined based on factors such as plant structures (such as trees, shrubs, and grasses), leaf types (such as broadleaf and needleleaf), plant spacing (forest, woodland, savanna), and climate. Unlike ecozones, biomes are not defined by genetic, taxonomic, or historical similarities. Biomes are often identified with particular patterns of ecological succession and climax vegetation.  Landforms  A landform comprises a geomorphological unit and is largely defined by its surface form and location in the landscape, as part of the terrain, and as such is typically an element of topography. Landforms are categorized by features such as elevation, slope, orientation, stratification, rock exposure, and soil type. They include berms, mounds, hills, cliffs, valleys, rivers, and numerous other elements. Oceans and continents are the highest-order landforms. A body of water is any significant accumulation of water, usually covering the Earth. The term \\"body of water\\" most often refers to oceans, seas, and lakes, but it may also include smaller pools of water such as ponds, creeks or wetlands. Rivers, streams, canals, and other geographical features where water moves from one place to another are not always considered bodies of water, but they are included as geographical formations featuring water.  Artificial geographical features  = Settlement = A settlement is a permanent or temporary community in which people live. Settlements range in components from a small number of dwellings grouped together to the largest of cities with surrounding urbanized areas. Other landscape features such as roads, enclosures, field systems, boundary banks and ditches, ponds, parks and woods, mills, manor houses, moats, and churches may be considered part of a settlement. = Engineered constructs = Engineered geographic features include highways, bridges, airports, railroads, buildings, dams, and reservoirs, and are part of the anthroposphere because they are man-made geographic features.  Cartographic features  Cartographic features are types of abstract geographical features, which appear on maps but not on the planet itself, even though they are located on the planet. For example, latitudes, longitudes, the Equator, and the Prime Meridian are shown on maps of the Earth, but it do not physically exist. It is a theoretical line used for reference, navigation, and measurement. In geographic information standardization In the ISO/TC 211 standards on geographic information, there are the following definitions: * a feature is defined as an \\"abstraction of real world phenomena\\"; * a geographic feature is a \\"representation of real world phenomenon associated with a location relative to the Earth\\"; * a simple feature is a \\"feature restricted to 2D geometry with linear interpolation between vertices, having both spatial and non spatial attributes\\"; * a complex feature is a \\"feature composed of other features\\".

Though the only authority with a detailed account of the battle was Nicolaus of Damascus, other well-known historians such as Herodotus, Ctesias, and Strabo also mention the battle in their own accounts.Herodotus (The Histories) I, 127-128Ctesias (Persica)Fragments of Nicolaus of DamascusStrabo (History) XV, 3.8 The outcome of the battle was such a great blow to the Medes that Astyages decided to personally invade Persia. The hasty invasion eventually led to his downfall. In turn, the former enemies of the Medes tried to move against them, only to be stopped by Cyrus. Thus a period of reconciliation began, which facilitated a close relationship between the Persians and Medes, and enabled Ecbatana, capital of Media, to pass to the Persians as one of Persia's capitals in the newly formed empire. Background The battle occurred after the Persian Revolt, which is known to have taken place in the summer of 553 BC.The Nabonidus Cylinder from Sippar Based on scant sources the battle (which was in Hyrba) is believed to have taken place at least half a year after the revolt had already begun,The Nabonidus Chronicle of the Babylonian Chronicles 1 probably in the beginning of winter in 552 BC.The Nabonidus Chronicle of the Babylonian Chronicles 2 Astyages, the king of Medes, who is thought to have also been Cyrus's grandfather, had earlier turned down the request of Cyrus to leave his court and visit his parents again, as he had done several times earlier.Fischer, W.B., Ilya Gershevitch, and Ehsan Yarshster, The Cambridge History of Iran, Cambridge University Press (1993) p. 144. In 1 volume Though his request to Astyages was not unusual, Cyrus had made the mistake of asking him right after the revolt that had happened, but through the pleading of the Persian servant, Oebares, Astyages let him visit his parents again.Fischer, W.B., Ilya Gershevitch, and Ehsan Yarshster, The Cambridge History of Iran, Cambridge University Press (1993) p. 145-146. In 1 volume In Herodotus' version, in one of the first times Cyrus had gone to his parents, the Median general Harpagus had secretly sent a letter stuffed in a hare to Cyrus to plot a revolt, and Cyrus passed the letter on to his father.Duncker, Max, The History of Antiquity, tr. Evelyn Abbott, p. 349. London, Richard Bentley * Son (1881) p. 349-351 This matches the account of Nicolaus in which he says that Cambyses I had already assembled many troops well before the battle had started, and that he later despatched a small number to Cyrus's aid.Duncker, Max, The History of Antiquity, tr. Evelyn Abbott, p. 350. London, Richard Bentley * Son (1881) p. 349-351 Cyrus sent a message to his father saying \\"... send at once 1000 cavalry and 5000 foot-soldiers to the city of Hyrba which lay on the way, and to arm the rest of the Persians as quickly as possible in such a way that it should seem to be done by command of the king. His true aims he did not communicate to him.\\" This also confirms the notion that the battle took place months, not days, after the revolt.Chisholm, Hugh, The Encyclop√¶dia Britannica: A Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, Literature and General Information, Cambridge, England; New York: At the University Press, (1910) p.206 Astyages' decision to let Cyrus return to his parents is considered by some to have changed history by eventually enabling the Persis province to become the most powerful state in the ancient world.Laymon, Charles M., The Interpreter's One Volume Commentary on the Bible: Introduction and Commentary, Abingdon Press, (1971) p.440.

D., Herodotus, A D Godley. I, 126. London, W. Heinemann; New York, G.P. Putnam's Sons, (1921-24) p. 144.

London, Richard Bentley * Son (1881) p. 349-350.5 In Herodotus' Histories, he hints the first battle between the Persians and Medes, which Harpagus goes over to Cyrus, and most of the Medes either joined Cyrus or were killed, with a small force escaping back to Media.Herodotus, The History of Herodotus, tr.

Details from Herodotus' and Nicolas' accounts also suggest the actual battle took place half a year after the revolt, which if one counts forward from the summer of 553 BC, one would reach the beginning of 552 BC. This would have also given Cambyses ample time to gather the army and allies for battle.
