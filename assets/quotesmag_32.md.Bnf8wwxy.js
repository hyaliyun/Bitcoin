The estate has existed since the 14th century and since 1947 has been the last remaining fully operational castle farm in the country, and one of the few remaining in Europe. The castle has been private property of the van Nispen family since 1785, and is owned and operated by Jonkheer Huub van Nispen van Sevenaer. Agriculture The castle grows all its own food for its cattle and is run solely on macrobiotic principles. Huub van Nispen in public interviews announced the importance of a country's self-sufficiency to grow its own food, especially during times of crisis. Van Nispen was strict against the use of pesticides. This estate has been solely organic since World War II and probably for centuries before that. Rare native plants grow on the estate. The farm is fond of companion planting and other principles now known as \\"permaculture\\" or \\"macrobiotic farming.\\" Early on as research by Dr. Grashuis made the link between certain diseases in cows and livestock and the use of artificial fertilizer. Van Nispen decided to bring the ground as well as the plants on it in a healthy balance. His thesis was that everything in nature has a place and when you can restore a balance in your local ecosystem you will have a healthy crop without the use of any chemicals, and consequently preventing diseases from anyone consuming those chemicals. Studying insects such as lady bugs and where they fly to and from was one of the aspects of maintaining a healthy ecosystem. Bugs are beneficial, but not in large amounts. Knowing the proper function of each weed and bug is crucial in maintaining a healthy garden. Local farmers have often stopped by since they want to know why a herd of 50 Pi√´montese never gets visits of a vet or get inoculated on a farm that does not even use artificial fertilizer. World War II During World War II the castle was damaged and a fire destroyed most of the top floor and tower. Thanks to a grant, some parts of the castle can now be partially restored. For the longest time the existence of the castle and farm has been threatened by city development, who did not see the value of this heritage. However, thanks to recent changes, the castle has again started with renovation. Post World War II The City Zevenaar has been attempting to prevent the health food farming since 1948 when they made a first attempt to disown the lands and property and sell it to cigarette company and other developers. The decades long lawsuit was led by his father, who was the mayor of Laren and then taken over the himself. Despite media efforts to preserve the landscape and cultural heritage, the Dutch government disowned a large portion of the lands. A Dutch paper - het Algemeen Dagblad - stated: \\"Company of healing produce forced to make way for factory making cancer inducing products.\\" The family had lost a lot during the war and the countless lawsuits with the government, leaving no funds available to properly restore the castle from the damages during WWII. After years of fighting with local and national authorities for the existence of the farm and cultural heritage, finally a small group of people started to see the value of this Cultural Heritage and have donated funds to make a start restore the castle. Cultural heritage Mozart probably visited the castle as the family archives contained manuscripts from Mozart. A concert titled \\"Muziek uit het Archief\\" (Music from the Archives) was performed on 30 September 2005. However, during World War II the castle was occupied by the German army. Many manuscripts and books from Huize Sevenaer and Huize Pannerden, a neighboring estate, were used as fill to repair roads. The archives have been in poor condition since soldiers used stacks of papers from the archives as insulation to sleep in between during the cold winters. Consequently it has been taken years to update and restore the family archives. Rose Gardens Most people who visited the castle in the 1950s and 1960s remember the beautiful rose gardens, with a rare and wonderfully scented rose called \\"Ophelia\\". Visitors The castle is open to the public for scheduled tours and they also have educational tours for children. Frequently, volunteers are selected to learn about their farming methods.

Nathan was the youngest son of Daniel Boone. Nathan Boone was born at Boone Station, near Athens, Fayette County, Kentucky in 1780 and moved to Spanish Missouri with the family in 1799. In 1807, he and his brother Daniel first worked the Salt licks in what became known as the Booneslick Country.

Boone took part in the War of 1812 as captain of a company of United States Rangers which scouted in the country between the Mississippi and Illinois. He also took part in an expedition led by Henry Dodge to relieve settlers who had been raided by Miami Indians. He and Dodge saved 150 Miamis from massacre by members of their own militia. The Miamis had agreed to surrender as prisoners of war, and certain members of the militia became angered when they found contraband belonging to a settler who had been killed in the original raid, but Dodge and Boone literally stood in the line of fire and forced the nearly mutinous troops to back down. He attained the rank of major in the militia in this war. After he was mustered out Boone retired to his farm in St. Charles County, Missouri. He built the first stone house north of the Missouri and his father died there. In 1820 he was a delegate to the Missouri constitutional convention He participated in the Black Hawk War in 1832. After the conclusion of those hostilities, he entered the regular army as captain in the United States Regiment of Dragoons, direct predecessor of the 1st Cavalry Regiment (United States Army), the regiment's first commander being Colonel Dodge. He participated in the First Dragoon Expedition, notable for making the first contact between the United States federal government and the southern plains Indians. His army service further included participation in the Second Dragoon Expedition, surveying the boundaries between the Creek and Cherokee Indian nations, and leading his own expedition into the southwestern plains in 1843. In 1847, he was made major in the army, and lieutenant-colonel in 1853. In 1853, Nathan Boone resigned and retired to his home in Missouri, Greene County, Missouri, where he died in 1856. In the fall of 1851, Nathan Boone and his wife Olive were interviewed by Wisconsin Historical Society archivist Lyman C. Draper concerning his famous father. Along with the interviews, Boone presented Draper with a collection of family papers. Draper wrote a manuscript about Daniel Boone which was finally published as an edited and annotated version in 1998.

The first three demos has also the titles borrowed from Lovecraft's stories: The Dunwich Horror (1985), Horror at Red Hook (1988) and Morbid dance tale of Yog- Sothoth (1989).

The elements of Dunwich inspiration becomes medieval and gothic literary elements, but also research on fairy tales and legends from around the world.For example, in their 2nd album, Il chiarore sorge due volte, the track La rivalsa di Aki Gahuk is inspired from a Dusun people legend, in which an old man transform itself in a crocodile The first production is divided into three demo tapes, Il tavolo di smeraldo (1992), Sul monte √® il tuono and Sopra il lago il vento, both of 1993.

Following in the 1995 the second album Il chiarore sorge due volte (Flare rises twice) for the Pick-Up Records. In this album came out the band attentions to the sounds of the new wave gothic. In 1998, with the German label Rising Sun Records, is published Eternal eclipse of frost, which accentuates the metal sound. This album allows Dunwich to project ind the international scene.

Alternatively, J√ºrgen von Beckerath sees 'Apepi as a member of the late 16th Dynasty and a vassal of the Hyksos rulers of the 15th Dynasty.J√ºrgen von Beckerath: Handbuch der √§gyptischen K√∂nigsnamen, M√ºnchner √§gyptologische Studien, Heft 49, Mainz : P. von Zabern, 1999, Attestation 'Apepi's only secure attestation is the Turin canon, a king list redacted in the Ramesside period. 'Apepi is listed on a fragment of the document corresponding to column 10, row 15 (column 9 row 16 as per Alan H. Gardiner's reconstruction of the Turin canon). The chronological position of 'Apepi cannot be ascertained beyond doubt due to the fragile and fragmentary state of the canon. Furthermore, the document preserves only the beginning of 'Apepi's prenomen as \\"'Ap[...]\\". which, Ryholt argues, may be restored to \\"'Apepi\\". King's son Apophis Ryholt's reconstruction of the name of 'Apepi is significant because five scarab seals inscribed with \\"King's son Apophis\\" are known.Cecil Mallaby Firth: The archaeological survey of Nubia: report for 1908-1909, 27, 59, pl. 42 [44]Frederick George Hilton Price: A catalogue of the Egyptian antiquities in the possession of F.G. Hilton Price, London 1897, available online see No 171 p. 25 On two of these seals the inscription is furthermore enclosed in a cartouche and followed by di-ÀÅn·∏´ meaning \\"given life\\". These two attributes are normally reserved to kings or designated heirs to the throne and 'Apepi could be the Apophis referred to on the seals. Tentatively confirming this attribution, Ryholt notes that both scarabs can be dated on stylistic grounds to the 14th Dynasty, between the reigns of Sheshi and Yaqub-Har.

The coaster shares its name with the El Loco roller coaster model which is built by S&S; ‚Äì Sansei Technologies. History El Loco opened on February 18, 2014, as a replacement for the Rim Runner log flume which had been removed in 2013‚Äîthough El Loco still uses some of the structures of Rim Runner, including the station. Many sources reported that the El Loco at Adventuredome would have a \\"beyond vertical\\" first drop, which is typical for El Loco model coasters (some sources reported that the drop would be as steep as 120 degrees). Despite these reports, however, the coaster ultimately only had a 90-degree drop. The coaster is the second El Loco model to be built indoors (after Crazy Bird), as well as being the second El Loco model to be built in the United States (after Steel Hawg). Circus Circus would not project the specific increase in attendance it expected as a result of installing the coaster, but predicted that it would do well. Layout Although it is not beyond vertical, many sources note the 90 degree drop on El Loco. The coaster also has a total of two inversions‚Äîboth dive loops. It is also noteworthy for it sometimes banking toward the outside of turns. Guests ride the coaster in individual four-rider cars containing two rows of two. The cars have speaker systems which play music that was customized for the ride, and is a mix of \\"energetic hip hop, rock and Latin beats\\".  Reception  The coaster was rated as one of the ten most anticipated rides for 2014 by USA Today. Incidents On March 26, 2019, a woman was reported to have fallen from the coaster. The extent of her injuries and where she fell are still unknown. The coaster reopened in August 2019.

In 1921 she was among the first group of women to run as candidates in a Canadian federal election. She was a committed socialist. Family Harriet Irene Dunlop was the daughter of Archibald Dunlop. She belonged to the Presbyterian faith. She married Hector Henry Weir Prenter on 8 September 1892 in York, Ontario. Her husband was born in Ireland on 2 February 1860, and had emigrated to Canada around 1890. Pacifist During World War I (1914‚Äì18) Harriet Dunlop Prenter took an idealist position against church ministers who supported military training in schools. She wrote, \\"After all, militarism is not a system: it is a spirit, and if we allow this thing now, we are denying the very principle for which our men are dying in Europe.\\" The Women's International League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF) developed from the Women's Peace Party (WPP) that Jane Addams and other feminist pacifists had organized in January 1915. Prenter became secretary of the Canadian section of the WILPF. In the fall of 1916 Prenter informed the WILPF headquarters that Rose Henderson in Montreal had \\"fifty women ready to join a group\\". Many feminists were opposed to pacifism. Woman's Century responded in late summer 1917 to a report that Prenter and Laura Hughes, described as \\"prominent suffragists\\", had drawn a link between suffrage and pacifism in Ontario. According to the editor, Jessie Campbell MacIver, \\"National Union and Ontario Equal Franchise Association have again and again expressed themselves as repudiating utterly any question of premature peace. Any pacifist literature which has been received from the Hague and elsewhere has been consigned by these societies to the waste-paper basket.\\" Feminist Prenter was an outspoken supporter of women's suffrage. She was president of the Political Equality League in Toronto. In late 1918 Prenter and Lucy MacGregor of the Women's Social Democratic League formed a Women's Labor League (WLL) in Toronto. The WLL was a working-class organization. Prenter mocked the \\"silken dames ... so occupied with 'committees' and 'uplifting' that they allow the social revolution to walk right past them.\\" Prenter wrote regularly for Canadian Forward, which reported on labour and socialist topics and published feminist and pacifist material for about 30,000 readers. Her articles also appeared in the White Ribbon Bulletin and Woman's Century. She may have encouraged Gertrude Richardson to contribute to Canadian Forward from June 1917 onward. In 1920 Prenter started a women's page in the Industrial Banner. She made it clear that she would not \\"endlessly discuss cooking, children, church and clothes.\\" The column would be concerned with topics such as the money value of the work a woman does in the home, and whether she should be paid a wage. Socialist At first a member of the Liberal Party of Canada, Prenter became a socialist and joined the Independent Labour Party. She ran as a candidate in the 1921 Federal election, one of the first women to run as candidates in a Canadian federal election. She ran in Toronto West in December 1921, winning 1,741 votes. She was not elected. In the 1920s Prenter continued to be active in left-wing politics in the United States as well as Canada. In 1922 Prenter joined the Workers' Party of Canada (WPC), and ensured that the WLL helped the WPC with communist campaigns. In 1922 she and Janet Inman addressed two hundred women of the WPC at a public meeting in Hamilton, Ontario. In 1924, for the first time in Canada, the WLL celebrated International Women's Day. Prenter also became involved with the Canadian Labor Party (CLP). She and other Workers' Party members such as Jack MacDonald tried to overcome the caution of the CLP members and instill a more revolutionary spirit. This communist influence was disturbing to some of the trade union delegates. At the 1927 annual convention of the CLP there was a crisis in which the party split. The non-communist Ontario Labor Party headed by Arthur Mould left the CLP.

During the Second World War he served as a successful destroyer captain, landed the 3rd Canadian Division on D-Day, and planned and executed the amphibious landings on Walcheren during a critically important phase in the Battle of the Scheldt in late 1944. Early life and family Tony Pugsley was born on 7 December 1901, the son of a solicitor, John Follett Pugsley, and Lucy Melton Chorley Loveband. Both his parents came from Devonshire families; his grandfather, who had qualified but never practised as a doctor, lived at Wiveliscombe, and his mother‚Äôs family were gentry originally from Yarnscombe in north-west Devon. Pugsley was descended both from Josiah Follett, the non-conformist preacher of the 18th Century, and William Pugsley who as a midshipman survived the sinking of the Royal George when she capsized at Spithead in 1782.The Royal George by Brigadier R.F Johnson Pugsley was educated for two terms at Blundell's School in Tiverton, the fifth successive generation of Pugsleys to go there, before joining the Navy as a cadet, aged 13, and going to the Royal Naval College Osborne and thence to the Royal Naval College Dartmouth. He joined HMS Warspite as a midshipman in time to witness the surrender of the German High-Seas Fleet to the British Grand Fleet in November 1918. In 1931 Pugsley married Barbara Byam Shaw, the daughter of the pre-Raphaelite artist John Byam Liston Shaw (Byam Shaw) and Caroline Evelyn Eunice Pyke-Nott. Early career His early experiences as second-in-command of the gunboat on the river Yangtze from 1925 to 1927 are recorded in Pugsley‚Äôs memoirs, Destroyer Man. At a particularly dangerous and lawless time in Chinese history, the upper Yangtze was ruled by warlords. An uneasy peace was kept by a British naval presence, and when one of the warlords held a number of British merchant seamen hostage, Pugsley received his first opportunity to distinguish himself in aiding in their rescue. On another occasion he prevented a Chinese mob from overrunning a British cantonment by leading a guard of four sailors with unloaded rifles, he himself armed only with a service cane, towards the mob which parted and melted awayDestroyer Man by Rear-Admiral AF Pugsley in collaboration with Captain Donald Macintyre. Weidenfeld & Nicolson, London 1957Gunboats on the Great River: A History of the Royal Navy on the Yangtze, by Gregory Haines, TBS The Book Service Ltd (May 1976) HMS Javelin At the outbreak of the Second World War, Pugsley, by now a commander, was captain of the destroyer , and was mentioned in despatches for his ship‚Äôs defence against enemy aircraft in the Norwegian Campaign.SUPPLEMENT TO THE LONDON GAZETTE, 19 JULY, 1940 Javelin was also at the Evacuation of Dunkirk, where she evacuated some 1,400 troops before being withdrawn to form part of a special anti-invasion force.Daily Telegraph, Monday 23 July 1990, Obituary of Rear-Adml Tony Pugsley After Dunkirk, Javelin was ordered to join Captain Lord Louis Mountbatten‚Äôs Fifth Destroyer Flotilla at Immingham. The flotilla was a force of J- and K-class destroyers, commanded by Mountbatten from, variously, his ship , and (when Kelly was under repair as she often was) the County Hotel at Immingham. As Javelin was the sole possessor in the flotilla of a radar set, Mountbatten often selected Javelin to be his temporary flotilla leader. On the night of 24 November 1940, the flotilla was at sea sweeping off the South Devon and Cornish coast. Mountbatten was Captain D (as the officer commanding the flotilla), and was embarked on board Javelin. As the Daily Telegraph put it, \\"whatever Mountbatten‚Äôs attributes in other fields, at sea he was regarded by Pugsley and others as an accident-prone Jonah\\". This view was backed by much circumstantial evidence. The Kelly, Mountbatten‚Äôs famous ship, had an astonishing number of misfortunes under his command, not all of them through enemy action. Pugsley in his memoirs remarks that Mountbatten was otherwise an administrator of brilliant efficiency, and above all a man of great and sincere charm. In a disastrous night-encounter with three German destroyers, Mountbatten over-ruled Pugsley‚Äôs advice which was typically forthright. When the destroyers were sighted, Pugsley said to Mountbatten \\"Straight on at ‚Äòem, I presume, sir?\\". Mountbatten replied \\"No, no. We must turn [to port] to a parallel course at once or they will get away from us\\".Mountbatten ‚Äì Richard Hough 1981 Random House . Mountbatten wanted to ensure that the German destroyers, which had several knots extra at their disposal, did not escape. He accordingly wished to turn the British flotilla to a course that would not allow them to get away. Pugsley was keen to get into action and bring his forward guns to bear as quickly as possible, in order to smother the enemy. With ranges almost point-blank, the first few salvoes could have been decisive. The turn to port ordered by Mountbatten was disastrous, offering the Germans a ready target. Javelin was hit by two German torpedoes as she came onto a course parallel to that of the Germans‚Äô. Of the original 353 feet of Javelin, only 155 feet remained.Hold the Narrow Sea (Naval Warfare in the English Channel 1939 ‚Äì 1945) by Peter C Smith, Moorland Publishing, Pages 132 and 133 Three officers (Surgeon-Lieutenant Sloan RNVR, Sub-Lieutenant Mitchell, and Midshipman Fitzgerald) and forty-three sailors (including Pugsley‚Äôs steward, Leading Steward Little whose loss Pugsley felt deeply) were killed. The German flotilla made good its escape. Javelin meanwhile was towed by tug over the course of the next 36 hours to Plymouth. Pugsley was again mentioned in dispatches.SUPPLEMENT TO THE LONDON GAZETTE 18 FEBRUARY 1941 HMS Fearless and HMS Paladin Javelin being under heavy reconstruction, Pugsley shortly afterwards took command of , at Troon, within a flotilla commanded by Captain Guy Grantham, and proceeded to Gibraltar on convoy duty. At Gibraltar, Fearless was ordered to join Force H, under Vice-Admiral Sir James Somerville, responsible for the Western half of the Mediterranean. Over the next few months HMS Fearless was in the Mediterranean, involved in convoy duties to re-supply Malta and the bombardment of Genoa, trying to avoid the Italian air-force‚Äôs (and on occasion the Luftwaffe‚Äôs) attentions. In June 1941 Fearless shared the credit for the sinking of U138.SERVICE HISTORIES of ROYAL NAVY WARSHIPS in WORLD WAR 2 Fearless was sunk by aircraft attack on 23 July 1941 during Operation Substance. Pugsley, again mentioned in dispatches, returned home, and, in October 1941, was appointed to command , a brand-new destroyer being built by John Brown & Company at their shipyard on the River Clyde. Paladin sailed on 7 December 1941, and Pugsley took her on her first deployment, escort duty to Ceylon. In April 1942, while in the Indian Ocean, Paladin rescued the captain, officers and ship's company of HMS Dorsetshire, and was involved in Operation Ironclad, the capture of Diego Suarez, Madagascar, from Vichy French forces (earning Paladin her first battle honours). Paladin then returned to the Mediterranean, via India and Mauritius, and joined Rear-Admiral Philip Vian‚Äôs force of some eight cruisers and twenty- six destroyers (plus the old battleship , now a radio-controlled target-ship), in order to force passage through the infamous \\"bomb alley\\", the term given to the westward route from Alexandria to Malta. The attempt (known as Operation Vigorous) failed, in the face of determined and sustained attack by the Luftwaffe and Italian air-force, and Vian‚Äôs force retired to Alexandria with a number of ships sunk or put out of action. The relief of Malta by the British was as a result thwarted until after El Alamein. Pugsley was awarded the DSO for his exploits while in command of Paladin.SUPPLEMENT TO THE LONDON GAZETTE 2 JUNE 1943 HMS Jervis and 14th Destroyer Flotilla On New Year‚Äôs Eve 1942, Pugsley was promoted to captain, and to command of the 14th Destroyer Flotilla in . He subsequently was appointed to command all the fleet destroyers in the Eastern Mediterranean. Throughout the early part of 1943, his flotilla harried Axis shipping and engaged Italian naval surface ships. Following the highly successful destruction of an Axis convoy off Sicily, he was awarded a Bar to his DSO and the Greek War Cross.SECOND SUPPLEMENT TO THE LONDON GAZETTE Friday 20 August 1943https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Bar_to_DSO.JPGTHIRD SUPPLEMENT TO THE LONDON GAZETTE 29 MARCH 1946 D-Day and Captain Patrols Channel In mid-July 1943, after four years almost continuously at sea, Pugsley was recalled to join the Combined Operations planning for D-Day at Cowes under Commodore John Hughes-Hallett. Pugsley was appointed to command one of the assault groups. Each landing force (there were originally three, two British and one American, although this was later increased to three British and two American) had a commodore or rear-admiral as naval commander and was subdivided into three assault groups each with a captain in command. Pugsley was given the frigate as his headquarters ship for assault group J1, responsible for the landing operations of the 3rd Canadian Division at Juno Beach.Operation Neptune 1944 Lawford was sunk by enemy aircraft in the early stages of the landings.Hold the Narrow Sea (Naval Warfare in the English Channel 1939 ‚Äì 1945) by Peter C Smith, Moorland Publishing, Page 228 The landings completed, Pugsley was awarded a second Bar to his DSO.SUPPLEMENT TO THE LONDON GAZETTE 14 NOVEMBER 1944 and was appointed deputy to Admiral Vian in the British landing areas in the Channel as Captain (Patrols).Operation Neptune: The Normandy Landings 1944 by Kenneth Edwards () After Vian's departure, Pugsley was promoted to the command of all British naval patrols in the Channel, responsible for preventing the enemy disrupting the Allied build- up. Walcheren and Operation Infatuate In mid-September 1944, Pugsley was given a new appointment, involving finding a solution to dislodge the Germans from the island of Walcheren. The role quickly became one of planning and commanding an amphibious operation to clear the island. =Background to Infatuate= Walcheren was the key to opening up the Scheldt estuary which would open up the strategic port of Antwerp, critical to supply the Allied armies pursuing the Germans to the Rhine. The whole impetus of the Allied advance across North-Western Europe, and into Germany, was dependent on rapid and ample supply, particularly fuel and ammunition. If Antwerp were not soon made available, the advance would be in imminent and fatal danger of being halted in its tracks. Antwerp had been captured on 4 September but, despite strenuous efforts by Admiral Sir Bertram Ramsay (Allied Naval Commander Expeditionary Force) to concentrate Field Marshall Montgomery's mind on the opening of Antwerp as a top priority, Montgomery had failed to realize its strategic importance until after the Germans had, on 17 September, succeeded in heavily mining the West Scheldt. Following the failure of Operation Market Garden, the full strategic significance of Antwerp dawned upon the Allies, with the realization that a huge mine clearance operation was needed in the Scheldt estuary in order to open it up.A Bridge Too Far (Hodder) by Cornelius Ryan () This could only be undertaken when the enemy had been driven from both banks of the Scheldt estuary. The northern bank, consisting of the large island of Walcheren and its causeway to the mainland, remained heavily fortified and strongly garrisoned by the Germans, with batteries sweeping the Scheldt and preventing the essential mine clearance from proceeding.The Times Saturday 21 July 1990, Obituary of Rear-Adml 'Tony' Pugsley =Planning Infatuate= Pugsley represented Admiral Ramsay at the HQ of General Harry Crerar, whose First Canadian Army had been entrusted with clearing the Scheldt. Pugsley soon became convinced that two combined amphibious assaults of Walcheren with simultaneous crossings of the causeway was now the only feasible way of ensuring the capture of the island. He pressed this view on Brigadier Church Mann, Crerar‚Äôs Chief of Staff. Mann was sympathetic and confirmed that General Guy Simonds, the corps commander responsible for the area, held the same view. Pugsley contacted Admiral Ramsay, who also immediately supported the idea, and authorised the planning and operational resources that Pugsley needed. While the crucial South bank of the Scheldt, around Breskens and South Beveland, was being cleared of Germans by the First Canadian Army in sustained and fierce fighting (this would allow Walcheren to be assaulted without fear of hostile action from the rear), Pugsley and his staff planned the amphibious elements of the operation. The assault was to be a three-pronged attack, two amphibious and one land-based. The major obstacle to a landing from the sea was the massive German defences, in the form of fourteen colossal batteries commanding the whole of the sea-approaches to the Scheldt and Antwerp; to attempt any form of landing at its foot would be tantamount to suicide.Battle of the Scheldt by W.Denis Whitaker, Shelagh Whitaker () The solution was found by General Simonds who persuaded the RAF to use their proven \\"dam-busting\\" techniques to breach the dyke. The Dutch Government had given agonised consent to this happening, and early in October 1944 four breaches of the dyke had been achieved by the RAF. A great part of the island was flooded by the incoming tides. The amphibious landings now became feasible, and the troops for the assault, the 4th Commando Brigade based at Bruges under Brigadier Leicester, became actively involved in the planning of the operation. Pugsley, now with his HQ at Bruges, had already been appointed naval commander of \\"Assault-Group Force T\\" by Admiral Ramsay, with Commander Jonas as his deputy, and Commanders Masterman, Dathan, and Redvers M Prior M.P. on his staff as, respectively, Staff Officer (Operations), Staff Officer (Plans), and principal Beachmaster, while Captain Colin Maud was appointed Pugsley's deputy for the simultaneous Flushing assault (Maud subsequently took on the principal Beachmaster role for the Flushing operation). The final plan, known as Operation Infatuate, involved two amphibious assaults to be launched simultaneously, one to be launched from Breskens to Flushing by 4 Commando (the one Army unit in the 4th Commando Brigade), and the other assault to be directed by the main force of 4th Commando Brigade at the beach at Westkapelle, the westernmost point of Walcheren. Westkapelle was still heavily defended and the defences had not been greatly affected by the flooding of the island. Fourteen batteries with guns ranging from 75mm up to 200mm were sited, pointing seawards, within the defences. In the days immediately before the operation, the RAF and the battleship (in the last shoot of her distinguished service since Jutland),Engage the Enemy More Closely, by Correlli Barnett, Penguin Classic Military History, 1991, page 850 as well as the monitors and bombarded the defences.Hold the Narrow Sea (Naval Warfare in the English Channel 1939 ‚Äì 1945) by Peter C Smith, Moorland Publishing, Page 246 The RAF alone dropped 4,871 tons of bombs, and a number of the batteries were put out of action. =Infatuate= The final assembly point was at Ostend, and the operation D-day was fixed as 1 November 1944. Pugsley moved his HQ to where he was joined by Brigadier Leicester. Eleven heavy batteries at Westkapelle were known to be still operational. Further heavy bomber raids were planned for an hour before H-hour, which had been set at 9.45 a.m., although these failed to materialise. The fighter-bomber air support to be supplied by the RAF was also cancelled because of fog in Kent, although as the force went in, rocket-firing Typhoons were called in by the RAF liaison officer aboard Kingsmill, and these succeeded in hitting a number of the German batteries. Pugsley had made the decision to proceed with the landings despite the very heavy fire to which the force was being subjected, and he ordered in the operation‚Äôs naval Support Squadron, in order to draw the fire of the defending batteries from the landing craft making the primary assault. Part of the naval Support Squadron of 27 small craft, under Commander Kenneth Sellar and Lieutenant-Commander Leefe, accordingly closed to engage the German shore-based batteries. This they did with conspicuous gallantry, and with very heavy casualties. Soon after 10 a.m., the landings had been effected. 41, and 48 Commandos were safely ashore and were clearing enemy positions. They were joined by 47 Commando and the beach-head was established albeit supplies could not be landed until some 48 hours later. By 12.30pm, nine of the Support Squadron's craft had been sunk, eleven put out of action, and a high percentage of their crews killed or wounded. Ultimately the Support Squadron was to be rendered hors de combat and was recalled by Pugsley, so many of the craft had been damaged or destroyed. Meanwhile, the beachhead, to which essential supplies of ammunition and food had to be transported, came under very heavy fire from German shore batteries which were no longer under attack from the Support Squadron. =Aftermath= Following the battle, Pugsley in his subsequent reports was unstinting in his praise of the heroic sacrifices made by the Support Squadron.Walcheren (Battleground Europe) by Andrew Rawson (Leo Cooper) () He maintained that the landings were successful largely because of those sacrifices. In a further tribute to the bravery of the Support Squadron, Major General Sir Robert Laycock, Chief of Combined Operations, wrote to Pugsley with the following words: > I understand that the success of the landings and the comparatively light > casualties sustained by No. 4 Special Service Brigade at Walcheren was due > largely to the heroic efforts of the Naval Support Craft who, at great cost > to themselves, effectively silenced the coastal defences. I should like to > express the appreciation of all ranks, Special Service Group, and > particularly that of General Sturges and Brigadier Leicester and all ranks > of No. 4 Special Service Brigade for the self-sacrifice shown by all naval > personnel during the landings, which had such splendid results. The Special > Service Group sincerely hopes that they may have the privilege of co- > operating again with Force T in any future amphibious operations they may be > required to carry out. By 8 November 1944, Walcheren with all its batteries had been captured and neutralized and the seaborne way to Antwerp secured, although it took more than ten squadrons of minesweepers until 26 November to clear the 80 miles of estuary and river. The importance of this victory and the supremely gallant sacrifice of the allied mariners, soldiers, and commandos involved, was made plain by the order of the German 15th Army Commander, General Gustav-Adolf von Zangen, issued on 31 October 1944, the day before the attack. > \\"The defence of the approaches to Antwerp represents a task which is > decisive for the further conduct of the war. After overrunning the Scheldt > fortifications the English would finally be in a position to land great > masses of material in a large and completely protected harbour. With this > material they might deliver a death blow at the North German Plateau and be > at Berlin before the onset of winter. For this reason we must hold the > Scheldt Fortifications to the end. The German people is watching us. In this > hour the fortifications along the Scheldt occupy a role which is decisive > for the future of the our people\\". Pugsley, was made, albeit still a junior captain, a Companion of the Order of the Bath for his and Force T's involvement in the Walcheren operations.Sixth supplement to the London Gazette 19 December 1944 Assault-Group Force T (continued) Force T continued in existence until the end of the War, undertaking smaller operations and providing the seaward defence for the Allied armies operating in the Netherlands and Germany. More notable actions in which Force T was involved included the important transfer of the First Canadian Army across the Rhine into Germany in 1945, and launching numerous minor naval and amphibious commando raids against enemy units and strongpoints along the Dutch and East German coastlines. Force T was disbanded in May 1945.Supplement to the London Gazette of Tuesday 6 January 1948 Post-war In July 1945 Pugsley was appointed to command the 19th Destroyer Flotilla in HMS Trafalgar, but the War against Japan ended before the Flotilla reached the theatre of operations. Pugsley continued in command of the 19th Destroyer Flotilla for the year following the surrender of Japan. Following an appointment on the directing staff of the Senior Officers' War Course at Greenwich, he was appointed to command of HMS Sea Eagle and became the Director of the Joint Anti-Submarine School, and then commanded the light aircraft carrier . He was promoted Rear-Admiral in 1951 and was Flag-Officer Malayan Area during the Malayan Emergency, responsible for naval support to the military operations and acting as naval adviser to General Sir Gerald Templer. Pugsley retired in 1954. Assessment The Daily Telegraph obituary of 23 July 1990 described Pugsley as having \\"an insatiable appetite for battle and impressive stamina; after a night on the bridge he would return to harbour, have a few gins and some lunch, and then summon his staff to discuss flotilla affairs. Pugsley played as hard as he fought ‚Äì as one of his officers put it, \\"you had to have your drinking boots on to go ashore with the Captain\\" ‚Äì and was forever smoking or sucking a small pipe\\".Daily Telegraph obituary of 23 July 1990 References Category:1901 births Category:1990 deaths Category:Royal Navy admirals Category:Royal Navy officers of World War II Category:Companions of the Distinguished Service Order Category:Companions of the Order of the Bath Category:People educated at Blundell's School Category:People educated at the Royal Naval College, Osborne ","title":"Tony Pugsley"},{"id":"43656273","text":"The Wheelhouse Maritime Museum (WMM) was a maritime museum in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. It opened officially on Monday, February 1, 1965 by the Underwater Society of Ottawa. The Wheelhouse Maritime Museum was open to the public on Sunday afternoons from 1 to 5 p.m., and on Tuesdays and Thursdays evenings between 7 and 9 p.m. From February 1, 1965 until it closed in 1976, the Museum was housed in the top-storey of 218 Cumberland Street in Ottawa. History In February 1963, the Underwater Society of Ottawa began searching for shipwrecks in the National Capital Area for the National Capital Commission as a Canadian Centennial project. At the time, Underwater Society of Ottawa and National Capital Commission considered devoting a section of the Bytown Museum to Ottawa River navigation. Andre Lamirande served as dive co-ordinator of a team of 18 divers. The Wheelhouse Maritime Museum at 222 Cumberland Street, Ottawa was the Ottawa Underwater Society's contribution to Canadian Centennial. The collection of the Underwater Society of Ottawa, which had been in operation since February 1964, formed the maritime museum. The museum, which was financed by society dues, was open without charge to the public from February 1, 1965 ‚Äì 1976. Andre Lamirande served as the Wheelhouse Maritime Museum's Director; he and Jean Trudel served as the curators of the Wheelhouse Maritime Museum. Andre Lamirande was the President-founder of the Underwater Society of Ottawa along with James Miller, Richard Desjardins and five others. The Wheelhouse Maritime Museum objectives were: * to collect, conserve and display artefacts related to marine history in Eastern Ontario and Western Quebec waters, shipping and shipbuilding, * to construct an exhibition area for special exhibitions, * to encourage public participation in events and activities, * to develop a marine resource centre of archival material, books, publications, ephemera and items, * to permit research activity related to marine history by the public, students, researchers and historians, and * to develop educational programmes. A Board of Advisors was formed comprising professional historians and archaeologists. Underwater Society of Ottawa The Underwater Society of Ottawa discovered and catalogued 197 shipwrecks in Eastern Ontario and Western Quebec waters from 1964‚Äì1976. Although the Society concentrated on paddle-wheeler and schooners that went down between 1809 and 1921, other ships were found. A man-o-war, for example, which was burned by the British during the War of 1812 was discovered in Shanks Harbor in the United States. Artifacts from the wreck of the \\"Atlantic\\", a 19th-century liner which sunk off the Marshead, Nova Scotia coast in April 1873 included a tile from the ship's staircase and a heavy \\"dead eye\\", used to secure rigging for the ship's mast. The Underwater Society kept several volumes containing statistics, reports, diagrams, photographs and other pertinent information on the shipwrecks. The wrecks were discovered in the St. Lawrence River from Lake St. Francis to Kingston, Ontario, the Rideau Canal and the Ottawa River from Montreal, Quebec to Lake Timiskaming as well as two dozen inland tributaries and lakes. The artifacts included \\"old bottles with labels such as Old Power Scotch Whisky and Ushers Green Stripe, bottles, dinner plates with boats' names on them, a 39-inch telescope, a host of small clay pipes, a shoe with the area around the big toe inexplicably cut out, one-penny gold coins issued by Mayors Store in Ottawa and a bottle labelled, 'For teeth and breath'.\\" Artifacts salvaged from the S.S. Rothesay in the St Lawrence River included opaque china, spitoon, ceramic jug and an iron fry pan. All findings were carefully cleaned and preserved. \\"Nothing is ever cut or torn from a wreck until we first make an accurate sketch of the vessel,\\" explained Mr. Lamirande, \\"once it has been identified, it is carefully cleaned with chemicals or a wire brush. When rust and corrosion are removed it is coated with a plastic-like substance which can later be dissolved to permit further examination.\\" At the end of each diving season a list of findings was sent to the proper authorities. Once the Wheelhouse Maritime Museum was fully recognized 1965‚Äì1976, it was allowed to retain all findings. Collection At the Wheelhouse Maritime Museum, artifacts were wired to pegboards with brief sketches of their history taped beneath. On display were chains, valves, gauges wedges, axe heads, hinges, propellers, steering wheels, and more. Artifacts on display retrieved from wrecks in the Ottawa River, included china, bottles, and a pressure toilet made in 1859. Artifacts on display retrieved from wrecks in the St Lawrence River included a pulley from the schooner \\"Marion\\", which capsized in 1869. One of the larger items on display at the museum was the oak hull of the \\"Lady Colborne,\\" constructed on Lake Deschenes in 1832, which burned and sank 1845 in Britannia Bay. The Wheelhouse Museum displayed pieces of ribbing from the French brig l'Outaouais, which was sunk off Carleton Island by the British in the 1760s. Affiliations The Museum was affiliated with: Canadian Museums Association, the Bytown Museum, and the Canadian Museum of Science and Technology and the Santa Monica Society. An underwater diving park was opened in Ottawa on August 1982 by Transport Minister Jean-Luke Pepin. Although opened only to divers and historical researchers, the Santa Monica Society hoped to open it to the public in the future. In 1982, Frank Martin, an official with the Santa Maria Society, moved the Bruce, a 19th-century steamer, to a permanent underwater grave near the Ottawa Rowing Club below Sussex Drive. Among the seven vessels planned for the park were the William King, Ivy, Otter, Resolute, Maggie Bell, Mansfield and the Bruce. Legacy The funding and accommodation did not meet the Ottawa Underwater Society's exhibit needs, and new accommodation was sought to store the extensive collection and display the exhibits. \\"Our greatest handicap is lack of outside financial assistance,\\" said Mr. Lamirande. \\"Most of our members are in the average salary level and it's getting more and more difficult to finance operations.\\" The Wheelhouse Maritime Museum closed to the public in 1976 due to lack of funding and the 14-ton collection was transferred to the Canadian Museum of Science and Technology 1976‚Äì1990. The Wheelhouse Maritime Museum continued to be involved in building scale models of the ships and published 'A Foregone Fleet:A Pictorial History of Steam-Driven Paddleboats on the Ottawa River' in 1982. On June 12, 1983, the Wheelhouse Maritime Museum provided a Retrospective on commercial navigation in the Ottawa Valley at the Billings Estate Museum. By 1990, a decision was made to move the collection from the Museum of Science and Technology in Ottawa to the Marine Museum of the Great Lakes in Kingston. The Ottawa Chapter of Save Ontario Shipwrecks documented and photographed several hundred artifacts, which were described as deteriorating in the Canadian Museum of Science and Technology warehouses in Ottawa and then had them properly wrapped and stored prior to their shipment to the Marine Museum of the Great Lakes 1990‚Äìpresent.

It holds annual congresses (called conferences until 2013) and a bi-annual doctoral summer school. It is registered as a Scottish charity. Its constitution states its objectives as \\"to advance the education of the public concerning all aspects of the history of business and management in Europe and in the environment in which they operate and to promote research into all such aspects\\". Its aim is the organisation of conferences and seminars, the publication of a newsletter and other materials, the encouragement of research in all aspects of business history, and specifically the promotion of collaborative projects based in several European countries such as The Performance of European Business in the 20th Century project per instance. The association was established to enhance inter-European contacts and promote extra-European links among business historians, to encourage the exchange of business history graduate students and to promote teaching and interest in all such aspects.  History of the association  The discussions to establish a European Business History Association followed in the wake of the successful foundation of the Association of Business Historians in Britain . Informal talks between Hans Pohl (University of Bonn), Geoffrey Jones (then at the University of Reading), and Tony Slaven (University of Glasgow) resulted in an invited meeting of representatives from a number of European countries in October 1993. This meeting was hosted and chaired by Tony Slaven at the Centre for Business History in Glasgow. The participants were not representative in any objective sense, but were those known to the organisers. They were Rolv Petter Amdam (BI Norwegian Business School, Norway), Michael Bibikov (Russia), Per Boje (Denmark), Hans Pohl (Germany), Keetie Sluyterman (University of Utrecht, Netherlands), Mary Rose, Geoff Jones and Tony Slaven (UK). That meeting reviewed models for an EBHA, objectives, and necessary steps to shape and establish a new association. Subsequent meetings chaired by Tony Slaven followed rapidly in Bonn in February 1994 and in Rotterdam in June 1994. By this time the initial group had been joined by Fran√ßois Crouzet (France), Ulf Olsson (Sweden), and Even Lange (Norway). The meeting in Rotterdam at Erasmus University in June 1994 established the first draft of objectives, the conditions of membership, the structure to be adopted for office bearers and members of council, and election procedures. The Erasmus meeting also decided that it was necessary to take the proposals to a wider forum to gain support for the creation of a European Business History Association; it was also decided to establish a steering committee to plan a first conference. The Business History Conference held at Erasmus University in October 1994 was taken as the opportunity to present the proposals to a large representative group of business historians drawn from many European countries. Tony Slaven acted as spokesman for the steering group and presented proposals to a general meeting at the Erasmus conference. The conference gave its support to the proposals and to the existing planning group to act as a steering committee to bring the European Business History Association into being. The first newsletter was planned for October 1995 and an inaugural conference was planned for August/September 1996. The working group was established as an interim council of the proposed EBHA for a period of two years from October 1995. Further planning meetings of the interim council took place in the University of Reading in March 1995 and Matthias Kipping was adopted as the first editor of the EBHA Newsletter. At that meeting in Reading it was agreed to hold the inaugural conference in August 1996 to be hosted by Ulf Olsson in the University of Gothenburg. A subsequent meeting in London in July 1996 was held to discuss potential collaboration with Manfred Pohl representing the new established Centre for European Business History based in Frankfurt. At that time, however, it was agreed to develop the interests of the new groups independently.  Membership  ''' Membership is open to any individual interested in business history. EBHA has over 200 members drawn from 29 different European and non-European countries.  The Alliance of Centres for Business History in Europe  At the EBHA congress in Uppsala (2013), Centres for Business History and Business History Groups at European Universities and Business Schools have created a network in order to (1.) improve communication and exchange between the large research groups in Business History; (2.) improve co-operation and institutional support in research and teaching; (3) improve PhD education in Business History. The Alliance is a network under the umbrella of the EBHA and it is open to all European research environments in Business History with at least four Tenured positions within the respective University/Business School. These centres/groups are facing common challenges within their University/Business School, and they provide environments allowing for collaboration beyond conventional academic networking. The Alliance meets annually in connection to the EBHA Congress. * Copenhagen, Denmark: Centre for Business History, Copenhagen Business School The Centre for Business History was established in 1999 with the objective to strengthen the historical dimension in CBS research and teaching. Today, it consists of eight professors and five PhD and postdoc researchers that share a keen interest in the way history contributes to a better understanding of society and business. * Glasgow, UK: Centre for Business History in Scotland The Centre for Business History in Scotland (CBHS), inaugurated in 1987, is Scotland‚Äôs only research unit in the discipline and counts as full members 13 business historians engaged in teaching and research. The prime objective of the CBH is to encourage, facilitate and conduct research in all aspects of business history, with particular emphasis on corporate governance, innovation and organisational change. * Milan, Italy: Bocconi Business History group The Bocconi Business History group is based at Bocconi University, Milan (www.unibocconi.it), in the Department of Policy Analysis and Public Management. The group consists of tenured and non-tenured scholars doing research in various fields of business history. The group is active in the organisation of conferences and seminars both at national and international level. Broadly speaking, the research interests of its members include topics as entrepreneurship, history of fashion and creative industries, international business, family business and State-owned enterprises. * Oslo, Norway: Centre for Business History Centre for Business History (CBH) at BI Norwegian Business School in Oslo was established in 1989 and, with a staff of 14 historians and 1 research coordinator, constitutes the largest group of economic and business historians in Norway. The Centre is a part of the Department of Innovation and Economic Organization at BI. CBH aims to improve the understanding of business institutions, interactions between companies and society as well as the dynamics of economic development. The research includes economic, political, social and cultural perspectives. The main part of the research is commissioned work, organised in a way which shall secure the academic freedom of the researcher, through standardised contracts and also with book committees commenting on the manuscripts. * Reading, UK: Centre for International Business History (CIBH), Henley Business School at the University of Reading Established in 1997 and part of Henley Business School at the University of Reading, the Centre for International Business History (CIBH) is the largest business history centre in the United Kingdom. CIBH strives to promote the study of the evolution of business and management in an international and comparative context. The Centre's nine members mainly focus on various aspects of international business history, particularly on topics related to retailing, consumer goods industries, entrepreneurship, intellectual property, industrial finance, small firms, creative industries, and industrial clusters/districts. CIBH staff play active roles in various national and international business and economic history associations and are active participants at the main international conferences in these areas. * Rotterdam, The Netherlands: Business History @ Erasmus [University of Rotterdam] Business History @ Erasmus brings together researchers with an interest in the history of business. The platform is an initiative by the School of History, Culture & Communication and the Rotterdam School of Management, both at Erasmus University Rotterdam, in the Netherlands. * Uppsala, Sweden: Uppsala Centre for Business History (UCBH) Uppsala Centre for Business History (UCBH) is organizationally and economically associated with the Department of Economic History at Uppsala University. A large part of the research focuses on questions about the establishment and development of organisations and markets, primarily within the banking and financial sector of the economy. The dynamic interaction between organisations and institutions, both formal and informal, is considered an important factor in the analysis of development. * Utrecht, The Netherlands: Business History at Utrecht University Business History at Utrecht University focuses on the historical development of companies and entrepreneurs in their institutional context. As part of Economic and Social History (ESH) business history links to the central debate on the question why some countries are poor and others are rich. What is the role of business in economic growth and prosperity? Business History at UU is therefore closely related to the Centre for Global Economic History, the platform of the UU for pioneering research into the long term evolution of the world economy and its components. Business history is also an important part of the Commissioned Research group, which conducts research for third parties. This research often focuses on individual companies or sectors in their relationship to society. From these two perspectives business historians in Utrecht find their strength in the interaction between the scientific debate and individual case studies. * York, UK: Centre for the evolution of Global Business and Institutions (CEGBI) The Centre for Evolution of Global Business and Institutions (CEGBI) was inaugurated in 2009 with the aim of contributing with research to the understanding of how businesses and institutions around the world evolve, and also of helping to inform current management and policy issues. CEGBI‚Äôs main areas of research are international business history; global marketing; and governance, entrepreneurship and social enterprise. Distinctive features of CEGBI‚Äôs research include its interdisciplinarity and methodologies. It engages with topics of interest to business and management, economics, history, sociology, and law. Conferences The inaugural conference in Gothenburg in August 1996 attracted over 230 participants by which time the initial paid up membership of the new EBHA was 214 members. First nominations and elections for council added Franco Amatori (Bocconi University) , Albert Carreras (Pompeu Fabra University), Wilfried Feldenkirchen, Ritta Hjerppe (Helsinki School of Economics), and Matthias Kipping to the first formally elected council. Tony Slaven was adopted as first President of EBHA with Geoff Jones as the first Secretary/Treasurer. It was decided in 1998 to hold an annual conference beginning with that held at Terni. Since then the association has met annually.

Early career Van Waardenburg was born in Buitenzorg in the Dutch East Indies to Dirk Adriaan and Stephanie (Gallas) van Waardenburg. After studying ‚ÄúIndology‚Äù at the Rijksuniversiteit in Leiden, he served as a government official in Celebes, from 1921 to 1931. While serving in this capacity, he met and married Lucy Mathilde Rickson in Watempone, Indonesia on November 7, 1927. He continued his civil service as Secretary to Jambi, from 1931 to 1933 at the same time he continued his studies. He became a government official to Bandjermasin, from 1933-1934, and was part of the head office Administration of the Outer Islands, until 1941. Between then and the outbreak of World War II, he held managerial positions in the Dutch East Indies, including Assistant Resident in Jakarta. World War II Van Waardenburg's wife, Lucy Mathilde, and 3 children (Maud, Tjoet and Hettie) were with him when fighting in the Pacific theater escalated and the Japanese invaded and occupied Indonesia. Van Waardenburg was taken prisoner of war and interned in various Japanese prison camps, from 1941 to 1945 (unbeknownst to him, his future son-in-law, Siward Ypma Sr. was also interred in a different Japanese prison camp in Indonesia, after having been captured while serving in the Royal Dutch Navy). During the time of his internment, van Waardenburg's wife and children remained in the house, until it was confiscated by the Japanese military to use as an officer‚Äôs barracks, and they were evicted. Van Waardenburg survived the prison camps and was reunited with his wife and children, who themselves survived the war. He returned to civil service duty, initially becoming the head of Political Research in the Department of the Interior at Buitenzorg, from 1945 to 1946. Following this, he became an advisor for Local Finance, in the same department, for the remainder of 1946.http://www.parlement.com The family returned to The Hague (Den Haag), Netherlands where van Waardenburg was involved with various civil and political affairs from 1947 to 1948. He returned to the Dutch Indies when he became Head of the Department of Administrative Affairs, again in the Department of the Interior at Buitenzorg, to 1949. He then became an appointed delegate of the High Representative of the Crown for South Sumatra Palembang, from 1949 to 1950. Creation of the position of Governor During that time, as part of the Colonial Administration Regulations of 1949, the Dutch Government in The Hague determined that a number of delegates of the High Representative of the Crown should be placed in service to administer and govern Dutch New Guinea. A Governor (Gouvernour) would be appointed by the Queen of the Netherlands. The Governor would be assisted by other High Representatives, as a council, in fulfilling his mandate and collectively hold legislative power. It was considered ‚Äúimminent‚Äù that van Waardenburg should be appointed as the Governor to establish and fulfill the mandate, and move the population into the 20th Century, with the intent to avoid unnecessary cultural dislocation and political unrest.\\"The West New Guinea debacle. Dutch Decolonization and Indonesia 1945‚Äì1962\\" by C.L.M. Penders (Leiden 2002) Van Waardenburg was appointed by Royal Decree (Proclamatie) dated January 6, 1950 as Governor of Dutch New Guinea (with a retroactive date of December 27, 1949).Proclamatie ‚Äì dated February 8, 1950 (Hollandia) His position as ‚ÄúGouverneur‚Äù was established in Hollandia (in the NE corner, adjacent to Australian New Guinea) and is directly responsible to The Hague. The primarily Dutch Administration was set up immediately after the Republic of the United States of Indonesia was created at the end of 1949. He replaced temporary ‚Äúacting‚Äù Governor, Jan Pieter Karel van Eechoud. With this new appointment, van Waardenburg left South Sumatra for New Guinea in late January 1950. Van Waardenburg began his appointment in very primitive conditions, which were actually the remnants of the first headquarters of General MacArthur. It was described by his wife, Lucy, as being ‚Äú cardboard, corrugated iron and mosquito netting.‚Äù‚ÄúSingapore Sunday Tribune‚Äù 10/08/1950 Despite this, he was able to build an administration which included (in part) First Lieutenant, Vreedenburgh; Government Secretary, Baarspul; Director of Health, Dr. van Hoeve; Director of Technical Affairs, Mr. Arends; Head of Aviation, Mr. Schredgardus. Many of these had been top level members of the ‚ÄúDepartment of Overseas Territories‚Äù in The Hague, bringing with them experience or background in Netherlands- Indies alliance. Although Dutch New Guinea was still rebuilding from the devastation from World War II and a volatile growing nationalism by Papuans, he was only given a first budget of 35 million guilders.Interview in the ‚ÄúSingapore Standard‚Äù 10/04/1950 It was Governor van Waardenburg‚Äôs ambition that Malayans would colonize potentially wealthy Dutch New Guinea within 5 years. ‚ÄúWe will be able to throw open the doors of New Guinea when we have dealt with three of our major problems ‚Äì malaria, housing and food‚Äù. He expected that ‚Äúwithin 5 years (Dutch Niuew Guinea) will be able to allow colonists to come in because only then shall we be able to welcome them‚Äù. As such he was very welcoming of Malayans and Malayan Eurasians. Initially, the body was to be composed of 21 members: 10 Papuans to be elected, 9 Dutch with 7 elected and 2 appointed by the Governor, and 2 members from the non-Papuan communities were added (one elected and one appointed).‚Äù However, it was determined the atmosphere was still too soon and haggard for elections, so advisory councils were set up, to deal with specific concerns of the citizens and become ‚Äútraining grounds‚Äù. In 1951, van Waardenburg created 3 councils, along with a ‚ÄúNational Education Council‚Äù which included members of Christian missions. Tenure Van Waardenburg‚Äôs plans were ambitious. The commission recommended that an overall plan should be adopted having as its first priority to rapidly bring the whole territory under direct Dutch colonial control. Secondly, it should accelerate the spread of education, health, proper housing and agricultural extension services. Third, it should speedily open up more opportunities for Papuans to be appointed to the public service, including the judiciary. The commission also believed that the introduction of western village councils and courts would be more useful tools to create national unity than genealogical-based institutions. Under Governor van Waardenburg began a concerted effort to advance the country and the people of Dutch Nieuw-Guinea. Accordingly, the number of pupils in village and urban 3-year elementary schools (teaching the 3 R‚Äôs and social skills) increased from 25,791 in 1950 to 32,686 (by 1960). The number of Papuan pupils in advanced primary schools increased from 804 to 2,734 (by 1960). The number of Papuans in teacher training courses grew from 95 to 404 (by 1960). The number of Papuans in technical schools grew from 70 to 212 (by 1960). The number of Papuans in secondary schools grew from 20 to 430 (by 1960). By 1960 there were 29 Papuans studying in the Netherlands. To advance self-reliance and national identity for the citizens of Dutch Nieuw-Guinea, almost half of the 24 districts would eventually be run by Papuan patrol officers. In addition, the number of Papuans in the Civil Service grew to 1,290 (by 1956). During Governor van Waardenburg‚Äôs tenure, the well known ‚ÄúPKII‚Äù member, Marcus Indey was released in March 1950, having been imprisoned since 1946. Though somewhat stifled, anti-Dutch rebellion and agitation which had escalated after 1945, continued. As such, military reinforcements were sent from Biak to prevent possible anti-government actions. The country of New-Guinea was still recovering from the war. Conditions could be primitive at times. Van Waardenburg would often serve in the capacity of judge to resolve local or regional issues and trials. However, his civil service background and time spent in the region ‚Äì and nearby ‚Äì provided van Waardenburg with the skills to handle a multitude of official and governmental affairs. He became a Knight of the Order of the Dutch Lion on January 29, 1953. Van Waardenburg‚Äôs four year appointment and tenure ended in 1953. The successor and second appointed Governor of Dutch New Guinea was Jan van Baal, an anthropologist who had spent considerable time in West New Guinea. His term was from 1953 to 1957. Retirement Upon completion of his appointment, Van Waardenburg retired from politics and government duties in 1953, and he along with his wife Lucy Mathilde, and their children, Maud, Tjoet and Hettie, returned to The Hague, Netherlands. The family resided at Juliana van Stolberglaan in Den Haag (The Hague), occupying the third and fourth floor flats of a Dutch townhouse. He remained mentally active and a loyal citizen of the Netherlands. From there he would see his daughters married: Maud to Siward Ypma Sr. in 1956; Tjoet to Raymond Pierre; and Hettie to Harry Roos, and he would learn of the births of 7 grandchildren. He remained in retirement with Lucy Mathilde for his remaining years. Also in the Netherlands was his daughter, Hettie, her husband and three children. Stephan and Lucy Mathilde would make trips to the United States to spend time with his daughters Tjoet, her husband and two children in Mississippi and their daughter, Maud, her husband and their two children in Pennsylvania. They would be visited in The Netherlands by his daughters, sons- in-law and grandchildren. In 1974, during what would be his last trip to the United States, van Waardenburg began to experience pains which would later be determined to be cancer. They returned to The Hague, Netherlands where he died on April 4, 1975.

There is widespread scientific interest in better regulation of climate change, ozone depletion and air pollution, as in general the human relationship with the biosphere is deemed of major historiographical and political significance.2010, Review of Joachim Radkau, Nature and Power: A Global History of the Environment, , by David Christian, 2010 Already by 1994 the legal debates about respective regulation regimes on climate change, ozone depletion and air pollution were being dubbed \\"monumental\\" and a combined synopsis provided.Alexander Gillespie. Climate Change, Ozone Depletion And Air Pollution: Legal Commentaries Within The Context Of Science And Policy 1994 There are some parallels between atmospheric chemistry and anthropogenic emissions in the discussions which have taken place and the regulatory attempts which have been made. Most important is that the gases causing both problems have long lifetimes after emission to the atmosphere, thus causing problems which are difficult to reverse. However, the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer and the Montreal Protocol that amended it are seen as success stories, while the Kyoto Protocol on anthropogenic climate change has largely failed. Currently efforts are being undertaken to assess the reasons and to use synergies, for example with regard to data reporting and policy design and further exchanging of information.Sebastian Oberth√ºr, International Environmental Agreements July 2001, Volume 1, Issue 3, pp 357-377, Linkages between the Montreal and Kyoto Protocols ‚Äì Enhancing Synergies between Protecting the Ozone Layer and the Global Climate While the general public tends to see global warming as a subset of ozone depletion, in fact ozone and chemicals such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and other halocarbons, which are held responsible for ozone depletion, are important greenhouse gasses. Furthermore, natural levels of ozone in both the stratosphere and troposphere have a warming effect.  Policy approach  Sir Robert (Bob) Watson played an important role in both cases There are both links and major differences between ozone depletion and global warming and the way the two challenges have been handled. While in the case of atmospheric ozone depletion, in a situation of high uncertainty and against strong resistance, climate change regulation attempts at the international level such as the Kyoto Protocol have failed to reduce global emissions. The Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer and the Montreal Protocol were both originally signed by only some member states of the United Nations (43 nations in the case of the Montreal Protocol in 1986) while Kyoto attempted to create a worldwide agreement from scratch. Expert consensus concerning CFCs in the form of the Scientific Assessment of Ozone Depletion was reached long after the first regulatory steps were taken, and , all countries in the United Nations plus the Cook Islands, the Holy See, Niue and the supranational European Union had ratified the original Montreal Protocol. These countries have also ratified the London, Copenhagen, and Montreal amendments to the Protocol. , the Beijing amendments had not been ratified by two state parties. After the Vienna Convention, the halocarbon industry shifted its position and started supporting a protocol to limit CFC production. US manufacturer DuPont acted more quickly than their European counterparts. The EU shifted its position as well after Germany, which has a substantial chemical industry, gave up its defence of the CFC industry and started supporting more regulation. Government and industry in France and the UK had tried to defend their CFC-producing industries even after the Montreal Protocol had been signed.Reiner Grundmann, Transnational Environmental Policy, London: Routledge, The Vienna Convention was installed before a scientific consensus on the ozone hole was established.Reiner Grundmann \\"Technische Probleml√∂sung, Verhandeln und umfassende Probleml√∂sung\\", (Technical trouble shooting, negotiating and generic problem solving capability) in Gesellschaftliche Komplexit√§t und kollektive Handlungsf√§higkeit (Complexity of society and collective ability to act), ed. Schimank, U. (2000). Frankfurt/Main: Campus, pp. 154-82 book summary at the Max Planck Gesellschaft On the contrary, until the 1980s the EU, NASA, NAS, UNEP, WMO and the British government had issued scientific reports with divergent conclusions. Sir Robert (Bob) Watson, Director of the Science Division at NASA, played a crucial role in the process of reaching a unified assessment.  Policy and consensus  Bob Watson successfully united the international science community in 1985 to act on the problem with the ozone hole, before a consensus existed. Aant Elzinga wrote in 1996 about the consensus, that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has tried in the prior two reports a global consensus approach to climate action.Aant Elzinga, \\"Shaping Worldwide Consensus: the Orchestration of Global Change\\", in Elzinga & Landstr√∂m eds. (1996) Internationalism and Science: 223-255. . Stephen Schneider and Paul N. Edwards, noted in 1997, that after the IPCC Second Assessment Report, the lobby group Global Climate Coalition and a few self-proclaimed ‚Äúcontrarian‚Äù scientists tried to discredit the conclusions of the report. They pointed out that the goal of the IPCC is to fairly represent the complete range of credible scientific opinion and if possible a consensus view. In 2007, Reiner Grundmann compared climate actions in Europe and the United States, he interpreted the inaction besides existing consensus, and noted, Political agenda that drove US climate change policy. The high visibility of skeptical scientists in the media resonates with this, and wrote that Germany started ambitious goals, reduced emissions, because ‚Äòbalanced reporting‚Äô led to a bias in climate change coverage in advantage of skeptical arguments in the U.S., but not so much in Germany. Additionally, Grundmann pointed out that after warnings from scientists in 1986 the German Parliament commissioned the Enquetekommission ‚ÄòVorsorge zum Schutz der Erdatmosph√§re‚Äô (Precaution for the Protection of the Earth‚Äôs Atmosphere), to assess the situation, consisting of scientists, politicians and representatives of interest groups. Three years later the report made an impact with the assessment of the state of the art in climate research, an assessment of the threat of climate change itself as well as suggestions for clear emissions reduction targets, even though he argues there was no consensus, and attributed the success of the report to strong precautionary action, and that no scientific outsiders or climate change deniers were involved. A linear model of policy-making, based on a position that \\"the more knowledge we have, the better the political response will be\\", was not applied in the ozone case. Current Sociology November 2010 vol. 58 no. 6 897-910, see Lever Tracy's paper in the same journal On the contrary, the CFC regulation process focused more on managing ignorance and uncertainties as a basis of political decision making, as the relationships between science, public (lack of) understanding and policy were better taken into account. In the meantime, such a player in the IPCC process as Michael Oppenheimer conceded some limitations of the IPCC consensus approach and asked for concurring, smaller assessments of special problems instead of repetitions of the large-scale approach every six years.Michael Oppenheimer et al., \\"The limits of consensus\\", in Science Magazine's State of the Planet 2008-2009: with a Special Section on Energy and Sustainability, Donald Kennedy, Island Press, 01.12.2008, separate as It has become more important to provide a broader exploration of uncertainties. Others also see mixed blessings in the drive for consensus within the IPCC process and have asked for dissenting or minority positions to be includedMike Hulme, \\"Lessons from the IPCC: do scientific assessments need to be consensual to be authoritative?\\" in (eds.) Doubleday, R. and Willesden, J. March 2013, page 142 ff or for statements about uncertainties to be improved.Do scientific assessments need to be consensual to be authoritative? Curry, JA and PJ Webster, 2012: \\"Climate change: no consensus on consensus\\". CAB Reviews, in press, 2012  Public opinion  The two atmospheric problems have achieved significantly different levels of understanding by the public, including both the basic science and policy issues. People have limited scientific knowledge about global warming and tend to confuse it with or see it as a subset of the ozone hole.Compare Sheldon Ungar, 2000 and various web sites such as Gavin Schmidts realclimate complaint in depletion and global warming 2005 or the UCS FAQ on the topic Not only on the policy level, ozone regulation fared much better than climate change in public opinion. Americans voluntarily switched away from aerosol sprays before legislation was enforced, while climate change has failed in achieving a broader scientific comprehension and in raising comparable concern. The metaphors used in the CFC discussion (ozone shield, ozone hole) resonated better with non-scientists and their concerns. The ozone case was communicated to lay persons \\"with easy-to-understand bridging metaphors derived from the popular culture\\" and related to \\"immediate risks with everyday relevance\\", while the public opinion on climate change sees no imminent danger. The ozone hole was much more seen as a \\"hot issue\\" and imminent risk compared to global climate change, as lay people feared a depletion of the ozone layer (ozone shield) risked increasing severe consequences such skin cancer, cataracts, damage to plants, and reduction of plankton populations in the ocean's photic zone. This was not the case with global warming.  Personal risk assessment and knowledge  Layers of the atmosphere (not to scale). The Earth's ozone layer is mainly found in the lower portion of the stratosphere from approximately 20 to 30 kilometres (12 to 19 mi) above Earth. Sheldon Ungar, a Canadian sociologist, assumes that while the quantity of specialized knowledge is exploding, in contrast scientific ignorance among lay people is the norm and even increasing. Public opinion failed to tie climate change to concrete events which could be used as a threshold or beacon to signify immediate danger. Scientific predictions of a temperature rise of to over several decades do not resonate with people, for example in North America, who experience similar swings during a single day. As scientists define global warming as a problem of the future, a liability in the \\"attention economy\\", pessimistic outlooks in general and the attribution of extreme weather to climate change have often been discredited or ridiculed in the public arena (compare the Gore effect).Sheldon Ungar Climatic Change February 1999, Volume 41, Issue 2, pp 133-150 Is Strange Weather in the Air? A Study of U.S. National Network News Coverage of Extreme Weather Events Even when James Hansen tried to use the 1988‚Äì89 North American drought as a call to action, scientists kept stating, in line with the IPCC findings, that even extreme weather is not climate. While the greenhouse effect, per se, is essential for life on earth, the case was quite different with the ozone hole and other metaphors about ozone depletion. The scientific assessment of the ozone problem also had large uncertainties; both the ozone content of the upper atmosphere and its depletion are complicated to measure and the link between ozone depletion and rates of enhanced skin cancer is rather weak. But the metaphors used in the discussion (ozone shield, ozone hole) resonated better with lay people and their concerns. The CFC regulation attempts at the end of the 1980s profited from those easy to grasp metaphors and the personal risk assumptions taken from them. The fate of celebrities like President Ronald Reagan, who had skin cancer removal from his nose in 1985 and 1987, was also of high importance.Ungar (2000) compares the similar important role of Rock Hudson and Magic Johnson for the public perception of AIDS. In case of the public opinion on climate change, no imminent danger is perceived.  Cost-benefit assessments and industry policy  Cass Sunstein and others have compared the differing approach of the United States to the Montreal Protocol, which it accepted, and the Kyoto Protocol, which it rejected. Sunstein assumes that the cost-benefit assessments of climate change action for the US were instrumental in the US' withdrawal from participation in Kyoto.Of Montreal and Kyoto: A Tale of Two Protocols by Cass R. Sunstein 38 ELR 10566 8/2008 Daniel Magraw, also a lawyer, considers governmental motivations besides relative costs and benefits as being of higher importance. Peter Orszag and Terry Dinan took an insurance perspective and assume that an assessment which predicted dire consequences of climate change would be more of a motivation for the US to change its stance on global warming and adopting regulation measurements. The US chemical company DuPont had already lost some of their zeal in defending their products after a strategic manufacturing patent for Freon was set to expire in 1979. A citizen boycott of spray cans gained importance in parallel. Not by chance, the United States banned the use of CFCs in aerosol cans in 1978. Government and industry in France and the UK tried to defend their CFC-producing industries even after the Montreal Protocol had been signed. The European Community rejected proposals to ban CFCs in aerosol sprays for a long time. The EU shifted its position after Germany, which also has a large chemical industry, gave up its defence of the CFC industry and started supporting moves towards regulation. After regulation was more and more enforced, DuPont acted faster than their European counterparts as they may have feared court action related to increased skin cancer, especially as the EPA had published a study in 1986 claiming that an additional 40 million cases and 800,000 cancer deaths were to be expected in the US in the next 88 years. The identification and marketing of a 100% ozone-safe hydrocarbon refrigerant called \\"Greenfreeze\\" by the NGO Greenpeace in the early 1990s had a rapid significant impact in major markets of Europe and Asia.Stafford, et al, 2002, \\"Forces Driving Environmental Innovation....\\", http://www.greenpeace.org/greece/Global/greece/report/2011/greenfreeze/6_Greenfreeze_story_2004_en.pdfGreenpeace, \\"GREENFREEZE: A REVOLUTION INDOMESTIC REFRIGERATION,\\" The climate change protocols were less successful. In the case of Kyoto, then secretary of the environment Angela Merkel, prevented a possible failure by suggesting to use 1990 as starting date for emission reduction. In so far the demise of the Eastern European heavy industry allowed for a high commitment, but actual emissions kept on growing on a global scale.Andrew Purvis, \\"Leaders & Visionaries: Angela Merkel\\", Time, Oct. 17, 2007  Science background  Radiative forcing from various greenhouse gases and other sources. right There are various links between the two fields of human-atmospheric interaction. Policy experts have advocated for a closer linking of ozone protection and climate protection efforts. Drew Shindell has used climate models to assess both climate change and ozone depletion. In his view, while research up to now has been more about the impact of CFC emissions on stratospheric ozone, the future will be more about the interaction between climate change and ozone feedback. Ozone is a greenhouse gas itself. Many ozone-depleting substances are also greenhouse gases, some agents of radiative forcing are thousands of times more powerful than carbon dioxide over the short and medium term. The increases in concentrations of these chemicals have produced 0.34 ¬± 0.03 W/m2 of radiative forcing, corresponding to about 14% of the total radiative forcing from increases in the concentrations of well-mixed greenhouse gases. Already the natural ozone variability in the stratosphere seems to be closely correlated with the 11-year solar cycle of irradiance changes and has, via a dynamic coupling between the stratosphere and troposphere, a significant impact on climate.Solar Cycle Variability, Ozone, and Climate, Drew Shindell et al., Solar Cycle Variability, Ozone, and Climate (Science, vol. 284. no. 5412, pp. 305 - 308, 9 April 1999) As with carbon dioxide and methane, there are some natural sources of tropospheric chlorine, such as sea spray. Chlorine from ocean spray is soluble and thus is washed by rainfall before it reaches the stratosphere. It is stratospheric chlorine that affects ozone depletion. Only methyl chloride, which is one of the halocarbons, has a mainly natural source, and it is responsible for about 20% of the chlorine in the stratosphere; the remaining 80% comes from man-made sources. Chlorofluorocarbons, in contrast, are insoluble and long-lived, allowing them to reach the stratosphere. In the lower atmosphere, there is much more chlorine from CFCs and related haloalkanes than there is in hydrogen chloride from salt spray, and in the stratosphere halocarbons are dominant.ozone- depletion FAQ, Part II, section 4.3 The same radiative forcing that produces global warming is expected to cool the stratosphere. This cooling, in turn, is expected to produce a relative increase in ozone () depletion in the polar area and in the frequency of ozone holes.Ozone depletion. UNEP/DEWA/Earthwatch Conversely, ozone depletion represents a radiative forcing of the climate system of about ‚àí0.15 ¬± 0.10 watts per square metre (W/m2).

Seiter, written by Jane Murfin, and starring Bert Wheeler, Dorothy Lee, Roscoe Ates, and Robert McWade. It was released on July 18, 1931, by RKO Pictures. Plot Engaged couple Albert Bennett (Bert Wheeler) and Alice Cook (Dorothy Lee) plan on leaving the city where they both live, in order to build their dream house in the country. They visit the site of their future home, both before, and while it is only the foundation, and later during its continued construction. The happiness over the new foundation soon dissolves as Albert and Alice start to argue about the floor plan, particularly the intended use of one unused upstairs room, whether it should be used as a den for him - \\"where I can flick cigar ashes all over, and there's no kick coming\\" or a fully equipped sewing room for Alice. This problem is made worse when dozens of Alice‚Äôs family members come to help, each offering different opinions for Alice's proposed use of the room in the new house. Albert‚Äôs bachelor uncle/employer George (Robert McWade) comes to inspect the house, during which time he mentions with great enthusiasm the recent return of a young woman named Minnie, the daughter of a friend of his, who had sent her off to Europe, \\"finishing her\\" as in finishing her cultural education, and apparently doing everything extremely well. Uncle George, when he mentions her to Albert, described her desirable virtues to him, and asks if Albert would be able to break off his engagement to Alice honorably, in favor of pursuing a relationship with Minnie. This of course, is immediately, but tactfully refused, with an attempt at describing Alice's virtues in a similarly positive light. Then Uncle George, in debating his own living circumstances with Albert, and Albert's best friend, Frank Andrews (Hallam Cooley) also offered to pay for it, in exchange for living with the newlywed couple on its completion. Alice‚Äôs family vehemently opposes, during which time Uncle George again brings up Minnie as someone Albert really should come to see, but another rebuff causes the offended George to fire Albert. Due to his apparent connection with another woman, at least as she hears her mentioned, Alice calls off their engagement, handing her engagement ring back to Albert, and suggesting tearfully that it might fit Minnie. Time passes, and the unemployed and single Albert completes the house himself, along with the assistance of local townsfolk who hear of his predicament, and decides to sell it. Alice returns to see the now completed house and she and Albert reconcile. A now happily married George (to Minnie no less, who unknown to Alice, came to see the house as it was listed for sale in the paper, in the same horse-drawn jitney in which Alice traveled there) returns and rehires Albert, and buys the house, only to give it to the new couple as a wedding gift.

A British column was attacked during night by a large force of Matabele warriors. The British were able to repulse them with heavy loss of life to the Matabele force. The battle is noted for being the first battle in which the Maxim gun played an important role. Context The leaders of British Southern Africa Cecil Rhodes and Leander Starr Jameson had responded to a raid by the Matabele with force. A British column commanded by Major Patrick William Forbes was sent into Matabeleland. It advanced towards Bulawayo, the territory's capital. The force was made up of around seven-hundred men of the paramilitary British South Africa Police, along with an unknown number of native auxiliaries. In addition to rifles, the column was equipped with five Maxim guns, three other rapid-fire guns, two cannon, and 200 rifles.Robert I. Rotberg & Miles F. Shore, The Founder:Cecil Rhodes and the Pursuit of Power, Oxford University Press, New York, 1988, p.442. Battle The Matabele (Ndebele) king Lobengula planned a surprise attack at night. The British set up camp at the Shangani river, forming into a circular defensive laager on the model pioneered by the Boers. Lobengula's generals Manonda and Mjaan launched the attack with 5‚Äì6,000 warriors. However, the British sentries soon alerted the soldiers. According to trooper Jack Carruthers the attack came at 2:15 a.m., \\"a peaceful night, clear sky but on the dark side. The bugles gave the alarm, the camp was all excitement in a moment, all noise with the opening of ammunition boxes and shouting of officers, the men were getting into their places... the scouts had hardly time to save themselves. The outer sentries also had narrow escapes getting back into laager.\\"Note books of Jack Carruthers - Victoria Scout Lobengula's troops were a disciplined force by pre-colonial African standards, and were equipped with both assegais and Martini Henry rifles, but the British pioneers' Maxim guns, which had never before been used in battle, far exceeded expectations, according to an eyewitness \\"mow[ing] them down literally like grass\\". By the time the Matabele withdrew, they had suffered around 1,500 fatalities; the BSAP, on the other hand, had lost only four men.Ferguson, Niall (April 2004). Empire: the rise and demise of the British world order and the lessons for global power. New York: Basic Books. p.188. The devastating effectiveness of the Maxims was such that they cut down wave after wave of advancing Matabele. Hubert Hervey, one of the British troopers, commented that the Matabele were not able to make good use of their own weapons: \\"the Matabele firing was very inaccurate and poor, and did hardly any damage.\\" The defeated Matabele left the battlefield, while their leader Manonda committed suicide by hanging himself.Tony Jaques (ed), Dictionary of Battles and Sieges: P-Z, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2007, p.931. According to Carruthers, he was not alone, \\"The Matebele retreated at daylight; several had hung themselves to trees with their girdles rather than return beaten. One in desperation, it seemed, had fallen on his own assegai.\\" Aftermath The battle proved the effectiveness of the Maxim machine gun, which was to become central to later colonial battles. Cecil Rhodes, writing to Sir Gordon Sprigg, said that \\"the shooting must have been excellent. . . . It proves the [Police] men were not only brave, but cool, and did not lose their heads, though surrounded with the hordes.\\" A week later, on 1 November, 2,000 Matabele riflemen and 4,000 warriors attacked Forbes at Bembezi, about north-east of Bulawayo, but again they were no match for the crushing firepower of the major's Maxims: about 2,500 more Matabele were killed.Knight, Ian (July 1989) Queen Victoria's Enemies: Southern Africa.

Welz (born Welzant, March 17, 1940) is an American musician best known for his tenure as pianist with Bill Haley & His Comets.  Early life and education  Welz was born in Baltimore to Melba Welzant, a teacher and concert pianist, and Joseph Welzant, a Baltimore city police officer.  Career  Welz started his music career with his group the Jay Rockers in the 1950s. Welz was amongst the first group of rock and roll pianists to start using the boogie-woogie style with his left hand. He attributes this to the lack of a bassist in his band, forcing him to play basslines using his left hand. In interviews he has stated that it also came in handy when he joined the Comets because the notes coming from the upright bass were often inaudible due to the limits of amplification at that time. He attracted the attention of Bill Haley when The Jay Rockers opened for the Comets. While serving as a recording engineer for the Armed Forces Network in Berlin, Welz recorded and co-produced a live session for Bill Haley & His Comets for AFN Frankfurt. This was the first occasion that Welz played on a Bill Haley & His Comets record, providing backing vocals on \\"Shake, Rattle and Roll\\" and playing on \\"Honky Tonk\\". This session was released years later on Hydra Records. Upon exiting the military in 1963, Welz joined the Comets as pianist following the departure of Johnny Grande. It was also during this time that Welz signed a record deal with Canadian-American Records and released the single \\"Hey Little Moonbeam\\" which he co-wrote with Steve Lawrence. He would continue to play with The Comets until 1966. In 1969, Welz recorded an album entitled \\"Listen To The Voices\\" with Link Wray which was released on Music City Records. Welz also recorded an album called \\"Revival Fires\\" with Roy Buchanan in the late 1960s. After Haley's death in 1981 Welz organized a Comets reunion which performed on The Tomorrow Show with Tom Snyder on NBC. This was followed by a tour of America and a single penned by Welz, Al Rappa and Franny Beecher entitled \\"Bring Back the Music\\" in 1982. Welz spent a majority of the 1980s in the studio with the Great Train Robbery, recording heavier rock and roll, including \\"In My Car\\", \\"Rockin' In America\\", and a heavy metal version of \\"Rock Around The Clock\\" which Welz co-wrote with the original writer James E. Myers. He is the owner and CEO of Canadian-American Records and Caprice International Records. In the 1990s Welz began writing and recording country music in Nashville with the Nashville Now Band and placed several singles on the Cashbox chart including a country version of \\"Rock Around the Clock\\", \\"One Way Ticket\\", \\"Rockabilly\\", \\"Back to a Better Time\\" and the \\"Nashville Now Boogie\\". In 1992, Welz signed with Caprice International/BMG. Since the early 2000s Welz has annually toured in France with the Captain Joe Combo. Welz continues to write and produce new albums up to the present day.  Personal life  Welz currently resides in Lititz, Pennsylvania, where he has converted his home into a museum known as The Rock Around The Clock Hall of Fame.

Known as \\"Jack\\", he completed high school in Oshawa, Ontario, where he then became a pharmacist apprentice, before attending the Ontario College of Pharmacy in Toronto, and graduating in 1885. He did postgraduate study in pharmacy in New York City, worked as a pharmacy dispenser, and later managed one of the largest pharmacies in Brooklyn. Because of the long-held belief in the health benefits of natural mineral waters, by the late 1880s a carbonated beverage industry had developed. With the addition of flavourings, they were increasingly consumed for pleasure, and often this was at drugstores. Canada Dry After embarking on a tour of European carbonated water producers, McLaughlin returned to Toronto in 1890, where he founded a soda water bottling plant. In 1904, he launched Canada Dry \\"pale dry\\" Ginger Ale and in 1907, received a patent for \\"Canada Dry Ginger Ale.\\" Personal life McLaughlin married Maude Christie on October 23, 1890, in New York City.

This fire burned predominately within the Los Padres National Forest, Monterey Ranger District, inside the Ventana Wilderness. Other affected properties include portions of Fort Hunter Liggett military base and private property. The suppression cost exceeded $40.7 million, not including resource damages and rehabilitation costs. On June 10, 2008, a residential structure on the Chase Ranch burned down. The ranch had restricted access; therefore, the damage was not documented by the Forest Service. A Forest Service Fire Prevention Technician risked her life to evacuate the reluctant cabin owner, just before the fire burned over the cabin. Area Burn Map On June 11, 2008, during a burnout operation, aggressive fire behavior produced a fire plume which burned over Forest Service firefighters along the Del Venturi Road. An entrapment occurred when a rotating vertical plume developed and the crew became overcome by the fire. Three firefighters sustained major burns and were evacuated from the fire. Cause The fire's origin, coming from too long a branch used as fuelwood, then left unattended during the night, which burnt through and fell outside the fire ring. The fire was ignited when an unattended campfire escaped into the vegetation during the night. Two subjects admitted to lighting the campfire that escaped from their control, and using the campfire without removing all flammable material from around the campfire. One camper awoke during the night to find Escondido Campground on fire. After their brief attempt to put out the fire, they hiked out 2.7 miles to their vehicle. Then drove out through the Fort Hunter Liggett main gate, at 3:58 a.m., without stopping to report the fire. The fire burned undetected for an additional 8 ¬Ω hrs. until a hiker walking along a ridge, saw the smoke from 10 miles away and reported it at 12:36 p.m. The escaped campfire occurred when the campfire ring had not been cleared of flammable ground litter and the campers went to sleep with the fire still burning. A burning log, which extended outside of the campfire ring, burned through and fell into oak leaf litter surrounding round the fire ring. The forest litter ignited and continued to spread during the night. The fire burned for a period of at least 5‚Äì6 hours before it escaped the campground. If the fire had been reported after it initially ignited, it would have been suppressed and contained the same day. The two subjects responsible for causing the Indian Fire pleaded guilty in Federal court.

He chronicled the history and events in Sarajevo, Bosnia, Herzegovina and in the Ottoman Empire during his lifetime and is considered an important figure in the history of Sarajevo for preserving information that would have otherwise been forgotten. Early life and background Ba≈°eskija was born into a poor Muslim Bosniak family in a Sarajevo quarter named after Mimar Sinan. Both his paternal grandfather Kadir and maternal grandfather Mehmed were Imams. Ba≈°eskija lost his father Ahmed when he was a child. His mother Fatima remarried and died in 1772 of a stroke after a long illness. His uncle Topal Osman-aga died in Belgrade in 1760. As a child Ba≈°eskija attended mektab and later medresa. It wasn't until 1763 that he began scribing Bosnian history. During the 1760s he also owned a small shop underneath a clock tower in Sarajevo. In his shop, in addition to clerical jobs, he taught students and other people in the Arabic calligraphy and Sharia law. In 1779, he wrote that he and few friends met once a week in a house, where, in addition to gathering and conversing for half an hour, were dedicated to reading books. Ba≈°eskija left Sarajevo on 1 July 1781 and moved with his family to the village Zgo≈°ƒáa near Kakanj, only to return to Sarajevo less than a year later in February 1782. Bosnia and Herzegovina, along with most of Europe, experienced a resurgence of the Black Death plague in the 18th century. Ba≈°eskija chronicled the lives of 4,000 of the dead, mostly adult Bosniaks. Works Mula Mustafa Ba≈°eskija added a collection of poems in the Bosnian language in one of his yearbooks, arguing that the Bosnian language is much richer than Arabic, because there are 45 words for the verb \\"to go\\" in Bosnian. Probably his best- known work is Ljetopis o Sarajevu (\\"Chronicle of Sarajevo\\"), in which he detailed not only his life and the lives of his family members, but the urban life in Sarajevo in its various aspects and events in Sarajevo and the Bosnian province as a whole from 1746 to 1804.

As a result, Howard county became the central managing agency for the project, which included Baltimore City, Annapolis, Harford, Carroll, Anne Arundel, Baltimore, Frederick, Montgomery, Howard and Prince George‚Äôs counties. $115 million was funded as a stimulus grant, with jurisdictions required to fund $43 in matching funds. Implementation The project scope was defined to 713 schools using 1,300 miles of underground fiber optic cable installations. In 2011 a new facility was opened for operations in Elkridge, Maryland managed by IPX International of Rockville. AboveNet, T.W. Telecom, and Freedom Wireless signed contracts to link commercial properties to the network. The ICBN was developed using Maryland- based Ciena‚Äôs converged packet optical portfolio and packet networking solutions. KCI Technologies, Inc provided the design and outside plant implementation. In September 2013, Levy transitioned to Columbia-based Far Corner subsidiary Torrential Systems. County Executive Ken Ulman replaced him with his former republican opponent Christopher Merdon. The Maryland Broadband Cooperative non-profit corporation was formed to manage networks outside of the jurisdictions. In 2013, Frederick County withdrew from the program. On 10 October 2013, Howard County executive Ken Ulman announced the completion of the $160 million fiber optic network to connect 1000 schools. In August 2014 Ken Ulman announced that the ICBN was the lowest bidder to provide service to the Howard County Public School System, with a cost reduction of $560,000 a year over a five-year contract. The network increased capacity from 100mps to 1gbs for 33 out of 41 elementary schools, 8 facilities, and one out of 20 middle schools.

Plants in this genus are woolly shrubs with warty, hairy leaves and with five petals joined to form a tube- shaped flower with four stamens. These species are similar to those in the genus Chloanthes in that the base of the leaves extends down the stem. They differ from Chloanthes, in that the leaves only extend a short distance down the stem. Description Plants in the genus Hemiphora are evergreen shrubs which have their stems, leaves and parts of their flowers densely covered with woolly hairs. The leaves are simple and are arranged in opposite pairs or in whorls of three, covered with woolly hairs and small blisters. The leaves appear narrow because their edges are turned under, so that the lower surface of the leaf is not visible. The flowers are arranged singly in leaf axils and are surrounded by leaf-like bracts and two bracteoles. Flowers have five sepals which are joined at their base to form a very short tube with five lobes. The five petals are joined to form a curved tube with five lobes, the lower lobe roughly triangular in shape, the two side lobes and the upper two all similar in size and shape. There are four stamens sometimes with the lower pair shorter than the upper ones or sterile. Taxonomy and naming In 1876, Ferdinand von Mueller described Chloanthes elderi and placed it in the section Chloanthes sect. Hemiphora. In 1882, Mueller raised Hemiphora to genus so that Hemiphora elderi became the type species of the new genus. In 2011, Barry Conn, Murray Henwood and Nicola Streiber transferred four species, previously in the genus Pityrodia into Hemiphora.

Demonization is the oldest propaganda technique aimed to inspire hatred toward the enemy necessary to hurt them more easily, to preserve and mobilize allies and demoralize the enemy.  Basic criteria  Because of the frequent misuse of the term demonization, it is deprived of its potential to be analyzed. That is why Jules Boykoff defined four criteria of enemy demonization: # Both media and state employ frames to portray inherent nature of so-called enemy mostly in moral terms. # The character of the opponent is depicted in a Manichean way, as good against evil. # The state is the origin of such demonological portraying. # There is no significant counterclaim from the state.  History  The demonization of the enemy has been routinely conducted throughout the history. Thucydides recorded examples of enemy demonization in Ancient Greece. Phillip Knightley believed that demonization of the enemy (first enemy leaders and later enemy individuals) became a predictable pattern followed by Western media, the final stage being atrocities. During the Second World War, propaganda documentaries that contained enemy demonization and flag-waving patriotism were prepared by the US State Department and other state institutions of the United States and distributed, after being approved.  Personification and demonization  Demonization of the enemy can be much easier to conduct if the enemy is personalized in one man, such as Kaiser Wilhelm II was demonized by the Russian popular media in World War I.  Consequences  The strategy of demonization of the enemy unavoidably leads to a vicious cycle of atrocities, which was elaborated by many authors including Carl von Clausewitz. Demonization of the enemy makes diplomatic solution impossible and inevitably leads into the war or worsening of relations. Depicting the enemy as particularly evil inspire feelings that make killings more easy. The portrayal of one's enemy as demonic has often led to the treatment of the whole population or political apparatus associated with the enemy group or leader as equally demonic. This also often results in a tendency to reduce an enemy's more complex motives to simple promotion of pure evil. The Chinese revolutionary theorist Mao Zedong held that the demonization of oneself by the enemy was a good thing. He said, \\"It is still better if the enemy attacks us wildly and paints us as utterly black and without a single virtue; it demonstrates that we have not only drawn a clear line of demarcation between the enemy and ourselves but achieved a great deal in our work.\\" (To Be Attacked by the Enemy Is Not a Bad Thing but a Good Thing (May 26, 1939))  See also  * Ole Holsti: Inherent bad faith model * Psychological warfare * Psychological operations (United States)  References   Further reading  Category:Propaganda techniques Category:Propaganda ","title":"Demonizing the enemy"},{"id":"43656833","text":"Gassan Shrine (ÊúàÂ±±Á•ûÁ§æ, Gassan jinja) is a Shinto shrine on Mount Gassan in Yamagata Prefecture, Japan.

The town is located at the old Douglas road, running from Afor-Umuaka westward in Njaba Local Government Area to Ukworji in Eziama-Obiator of Mbaitoli local government area, then to Oguta. Ibele community is bounded in the north by Ugbele-Akah community, in the east by Amaiyi-Akah community, in the west by Amazoano and Obeakpu communities, all in Njaba Local Government Area, and it is bounded in the south by Afara and Eziama-Obiator communities in Mbaitoli Local Government Area. Origin The Ibele community originated from the amalgamation of people of like-minds who migrated from distant and diverse places to co-settle in the present location called Ibele. History proves that Ibele is a conscious effort of three settlers who migrated into the area by close to four hundred years ago and co- existed as one people. The people or settlers that constitute Ibele community are set as Ndiokwu, Okwudor, Oru and Ndiuhu and this has been the order of seniority from memorable period till date. History prove that Ndiokwu and Nduihu communities originated from same father called Nze Duruodu who migrated down to the present land from Umuhu-Okabia from Orsu Local Government Area of Imo State. Okwudor community is equally inhabited by settlers that migrated to the land from Okwudor town in Njaba Local Government Area while Oru land is occupied by people or settlers from Orodo in Mbaitoli local government area of same Imo State. The facts of the real seniority status amongst the constituting communities has posed dangerous threat to the co-existence and well-being of Ibele community in recent days. Legends have it that the first settlers in Ibele town is the Okwudor people, Oru being the second to settle while Duruodu people being Ndiokwu and Ndiuhu were the last settlers in the land. Those claims did not in any way conform with the seniority status that has existence since memorial past. Although, this claim is widespread in the town, but there has never been proper explanation on the dislocation of seniority order that misplaced Okwudor to occupy the second position while Ndiokwu which by provision of the legend expected to be at rear of the order reversed to occupy the foremost position. The question to the regard of how the seniority status changed had never been properly explained. When and how, the order changed are totally unexplained by present people of the community. Although the legend has never been disputed by elders in the town, neither has the modern man unveil the reason of the dislocation. The account of messianic existence and operation in Ibele community may unravel the true reason of the disputed seniority status and how all things took a confusing state. Origin of the name The name \\"Ibele\\" and its meaning has been misunderstood by various account makers of the community or those surrounding it that references it in their works. Ibele is a name of a vast parcel of land that lies along old Douglas road that run from Afor-Umuaka westward to Ukwuorji in Eziama Obiato in Mbaitoli Local Government Area. The name Ibele was given to the portion of land by early hunters who migrate from Oru axes of present-day Oru East Local Government Area of Imo State. When the hunters from Oru crossed over the Njaba River, they disvirgined the forest that run across the present Umuele, Ibele and Ugbele lands. Those forests were filled of antelopes as a major animal. And as hunters and fishermen, they began to identify the forests with antelopes. At the mouth or shore of Njaba River, they encounter young or siblings of antelopes and they name the river mouth and its close forest as \\"Umu-ele\\" which means \\"siblings of antelopes\\". When the Oru hunters advanced into the forest, they found a herd of antelopes and they named the area as \\"Ibe-ele\\" which means \\"home of antelopes\\".(Igbo Grammatic Dictionary) At the left flank of the forest, they named it \\"Ugbe-ele\\" which means \\"route of antelopes\\". Those names became identical names for those various parts of the forests as they carry out their hunting businesses. The name Ibele did not take off or grow along the communal activities of the early settlers since all settlers bear along names of their traditional homes. Early sojourners When the Oru people disvirgined the forests, they pin their huts at the present land known as Oru in Ibele community. They identified there by the traditional name of their community (Oru). The legend had it that they settled at that spot because of the presence of a natural pond that stretched forth the land that is occupied by the people of Umuezala Ugbele that run down along the present boundary areas between settlement of Ibele and Amiyi towards Afara community in Mbaitoli local government area. The Orus were interested by the presence of the pond and as people that have keen interest for fishing, made enquiries from Chukwu Abiama of Aro-Chukwu on what to be done to transform the pond into a full grown river. They were told by the priest of Chukwu Abiama that for the river to be fully established, they will make sacrifices of two male and one female virgins in order to institute a deity of the river. The request became ambiguous to the Orus who abandoned the project and concentrated on the hunting as well as fishing along Njaba River. This pond- like river was the source of the name, Amaiyi as the people of that community migrated down to the location. That pond latter dried up and the Orus did not permanently settle at that land but were occasionally coming there to dry their meats of animals they kill during hunting. The land was later occupied by another people from Orodo in Mbaitoli who retained the name Oru as it has already been popularly identified. The story of Oru people‚Äôs occupation on Ibele land is easily confirmed because many things happened in the recent period to confirm such. The story held that as the real settlers of that constituted Ibele community emerged, they were frequently encountering hunters from Oru as they usually do their business there. The early settlers of Ibele were not comfortable with the attitude of Orus and for sake of permanent control and integrity; they confronted the Oru people who they saw as a threat to the new settlement. The confrontation boiled down to dialogue in which the Orus swore that they were not interested to invade the community or having intention to commit anything injurious to the new settlers. They maintained that their main interest is to hunt in the land. Both communities arrived to a peaceful resolution to the conflict that was sealed with an oath that both communities must embrace each other as relatives and must live as brothers till age abiding. This covenant was followed and maintained by both communities. Legend bear that due to such covenant, the Ibele community saw Orus as their brothers and refused giving their daughters unto them for marriage. They neither marry the daughters of Oru communities equally. Even at this era, it is quite difficult to see an Oru daughter married at Ibele community. Few years ago, a man known as Mattias Iheme from Eloka village of Ibele community wanted to break that covenant by going to marry a lady from Oru community. The community is precisely Awo-Omamma. When he intimated the elders of his intention to marry from Oru community, they reminded him of the covenant and dire consequence of breaking the covenant laid by ancestors. The young man ignored all warnings and advanced into the marriage activities. Behold after the marriage, he fell sick and died shortly. The brotherly relationship between Ibele and Oru people continued until lately. For example, few years after the Nigerian civil war, the Oru medicine men were frequently seen parading in Ibele community healing people with their herbs. Some of the Oru natural healers settled at Ibele while some comes and returns to their homes after days business. At those days, many of them became popularly known in Ibele like the one called \\"Onye Awo\\", etc. The word \\"Ibele\\" is culled from Oru dialect. For more explanations, the word is a combination of two words as thus- \\"ibe\\" and \\"ele\\". Etymology The term \\"ibe\\", generally, means \\"kinsmen\\" in Ibo language. But the Orus and the communities adjoining them uses the term- \\"ibe\\" or \\"mbe\\" to depict or mean \\"home\\", \\"plaza\\" or \\"station\\". Majority of communities in old Anambra state uses the word \\"ibe\\" as to mean \\"home\\" as the Oru people do. This must be connected to their proximity because the Orus are close to the communities that fall into Anambra State. Both words \\"ibe\\" that means \\"kinsmen\\" in Ibo language and \\"ibe\\" that means \\"house\\" to Oru people are pronounced differently. For example, the ending alphabet \\"E\\" in the word \\"ibe\\" with the meaning \\"kinsmen\\" in Iboland is pronounced in a more humbler and cooler tone and that prompted the Ibo grammatic scholars to add \\"H\\" as a prefix to identify it especially when it represent a name of a person. While the same term- \\"ibe\\" as used by Oru people to mean \\"home\\" has its ending character \\"E\\" pronounced in a more faster tone. Both terms represents similar interest in Ibo grammatic setting. For example: \\"ibe\\" means kinsmen, it equally means home and can be under changed with the term \\"Ikwu\\". The next term that made up the Ibele is \\"ele\\" which is simply a name of antelope in Ibo language. So the combination of \\"ibe\\" and \\"ele\\" when contracted gives birth to \\"Ibele\\". The name \\"Ibele\\" wholly means \\"the home of antelope\\" and is not a name of a particular human being as alleged. The proof of the name as for parcel of land is not far fetched. The community consists of three original settlers. Both settlers came from different and distant communities and to almalgamate as one at the vast parcel of land otherwise known as Ibele. So the word Ibele will be rightly explained as a name of a portion of land or a territory. Modern development Ibele commenced as an ancient kingdom ruled by Nze Durudo priest-dynasty. By the 19th century, the community joined with its neighboring communities as Umele, Amakor and Obeakpu to form Amazoana community. In 1910, the community hosted the first European colonial master- named Douglas who was the Divisional Officer of Owerri province who joined the Amazona with Aka communities to bear Umuaka with a warrant staff handed to a man from Ibele who became the first traditional ruler of the entire Umuaka community. The Divisional officer, made the trip into Ibele land as he came to inspect the destroyed Igwekala shrine in Umunoha by British forces in 1906 and 1908. During provincial demarcation process, Umuaka was placed under Orlu provincial territory. In 1985, Amazona became separated from Umuaka and assumed the status of an autonomous community with exclusion of Ibele that remained under the Umuaka community. In 2002, Ibele community gained its autonomy from Umuaka. As an autonomous community, Ibele was accredited by Imo State government with 21 villages.

Alluvial forest in Strasbourg (Rohrschollen) Ried of S√©lestat. The Alsatian ried consists of meadows liable to flooding, and of gallery forests, the vegetation of which is lush. The ried was formed by the then meandering Rhine, before it was canalised. The Petit Ried lies north of Strasbourg, whereas the Grand Ried lies south of Strasbourg. The town of Rhinau possesses 1000 ha of the last example of a temperate gallery forest in Western Europe, which is located on the right bank of the Rhine.  Toponymy  The word \\"ried\\" derives from Alemannic \\"Rieth\\" which means reed, and is related to the English word. etymology of reed website Online Etymology Dictionary  Geography  Today's Rhine is a pale reflection of what it used to be. Formerly, it used to be many km broad, spreading its sediments on a large zone, with Europe's largest water table discharging into the Rhine, or recharging from it, depending on the seasons. In return, the Rhine has become navigable, and provides Alsace with abundant hydroelectricity. As a matter of fact, France claims for itself the hydroelectricity produced here, according to the treaty of Versailles. Only the most recent dams, namely Gambsheim (F) - Freistett (D) and Iffezheim (D) - Beinheim (F), both of them located downstream of Strasbourg in the Petit Ried, produce electricity shared evenly by both states. The Iffezheim dam has just been equipped with a fifth turbine.  Ornithology  The Rhine Rift, and the Ried, is located on a major corridor as regards bird migration (the other major French corridor is located over the English Channel and the Atlantic Ocean).le Trait√© RUSTICA des Oiseaux du Jardin, page 61  Geology  In the Quaternary period, while the Rhine rift was subsiding, sediment made up of sand and gravel coming partly from the Vosges but above all from the Alps built up. The sediment thickness reaches 75 m in Strasbourg, 250 m in Neuf-Brisach, and 150 m in Mulhouse.Jean-Claude Gall, Alsace, des fossiles et des hommes Sand coming from the Vosges shows a higher tourmaline content, whereas sand coming from the Alps, which makes up the major part of the sand encountered in the Ried, is characterised by a combination of heavy minerals (green hornblend, epidote and garnet ).Jean-Paul von Eller, Vosges Alsace guides g√©ologiques r√©gionaux . Formerly, the Rhine was flowing into the Rhone, until the barrier constituted by the Kaiserstuhl disappeared. Thanks to their porosity, these weak rocks house Europe's largest water table. The estimated water quantity amounts to 300 billions cubic metres (of which 50 billions only in Alsace).Les bords du Rhin, D√©couverte nature, √âditions Ouest-France Numerous sand and gravel pits can be encountered in the Ried, thus making Alsace one of the most productive regions in France, in terms of building materials.

Early life Born in Dayton, Ohio, Hegel attended Centerville High School and was in the garage band The Chandells that changed its name to Bittervetch with the release of the 7\\" single \\"Bigger Fool\\", in 1966.http://gearfab.swiftsite.com/Catalog_List/Catalog_List/catalog_217.html Hegel enrolled at the University of Cincinnati College Conservatory of Music and continued to write and perform in various clubs around campus. Music career In 1973, RCA signed Hegel to a recording contract and released the singles \\"New York City Girl\\"https://www.discogs.com/Rob-Hegel-New-York-City- Girl-The-Clock-In-The-Tower/master/920980 and \\"Hello Jekyll, Goodbye Mister Hyde\\". Hegel signed a publishing deal with Don Kirshner and Hegel, along with his lyricist Amanda George, wrote songs for various television projects such as NBC's The Kids from C.A.P.E.R., the CBS sitcom A Year at the Top (co- produced with Norman Lear), theme songs for the pilot episodes of Say Uncle and Stick Around (starring Andy Kaufman), and the theme for Don Kirshner's Rock Concert. In 1980, RCA released the Hegel LP. The first single from the album, \\"Tommy, Judy & Me\\", received radio airplay on the East Coast, including New York City. The opening lyric, \\"Tommy said that he's had some girls in the strangest positions in the back of his car\\", was deemed too controversial for many stations to add it to their playlists. The popularity of the song on the stations that did play it caught the attention of Dick Clark, and Hegel was invited to appear on American Bandstand. Upon arriving in Hollywood, Hegel was informed that the network censors would not clear \\"Tommy, Judy & Me\\" and the producer asked for two other songs to be performed instead. Choreographer Patricia Birch, who had just been given the director's chair for the film Grease 2, noticed \\"Tommy, Judy & Me\\" and asked Hegel to submit some songs. After receiving the script, Hegel wrote \\"Do It for Our Country\\" for the bomb shelter scene and played it over the phone to Birch. In 1982, Hegel was introduced to guitarist and songwriter Dick Wagner and they decided to write some songs for Hegel to record and Wagner to produce. The first song written and recorded was \\"Just as I Am\\". Record promoter Chuck Dembrak took the recording to Chip Taylor at Polydor/Mercury Records and Hegel was signed to a recording contract. In 1983, on the day Chip Taylor and the entire promotion department were fired, \\"Just as I Am\\" was released. Hegel later received a call from a former associate at RCA, Dave Carpin, who was now at Arista, and suggested \\"Just as I Am\\" would be the perfect follow-up to Air Supply's hit song \\"Making Love Out of Nothing at All\\" and was to give it to Clive Davis for evaluation. In 1985, Arista released Air Supply's version of the song and it became a top twenty U.S. hit. Also in 1985, Chuck Dembrak approached Hegel with an idea to do a dance instrumental version of the Iron Butterfly song, \\"In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida\\" for Kama Sutra Records. Dembrak brought in guitarist Les Fradkin and with Hegel producing and playing the synthesizer parts with Fradkin, their version was recorded. Needing a B-side, Hegel enlisted his friend Dick Wagner, and together they recorded an instrumental version of Hegel's \\"Frustrated\\", released in 1985. Hegel released Hegel 2 ‚Äì Displays (a 20-song CD compilation) on Red Lips Records in 2009. The CD features original first recordings of his songs \\"Tommy, Judy & Me\\", \\"We‚Äôre Lovers After All\\", and \\"You Wonder\\". A download-only collection titled Road Signs was released in 2012 and features some of Hegel's current work. In 2014, Hegel was asked to contribute songs to the Pete Quaife Foundation CD, Legends ‚Äì Shoulder to Shoulder. Hegel contributed \\"You & I\\" from his Road Signs CD and recorded a mostly a cappella version of the Kinks hit song, \\"Tired of Waiting for You\\". The CD set was released in 2014. In addition to songwriting and recording, Hegel has been recognized for his vocal harmonies and background vocal arranging skills. For Don Kirshner, Hegel arranged and sang background vocals (with Jay Siegel of The Tokens) for The Kids from C.A.P.E.R. project, and two albums by Sarah Dash; her eponymous debut album that featured \\"Sinner Man\\" and the follow-up Oo-La-La. During this time, Hegel was also hired to write, arrange, and perform the theme songs for two television pilots: Say Uncle (starring Richard B. Shull) and Stick Around (starring Andy Kaufman). Producer Steve Katz called Hegel into the studio to sing multi-overdub background vocals for the \\"Sad Song\\" track on Lou Reed Live, and for Harper Hug at Thunder Underground Recording Studio. Hegel arranged and performed all background vocals on Jamie Palumbo's Realistic CD and sang the background vocals on John Stanley King Band's \\"Dem Boulettes\\". Novel In his first novel, Tuxedo Bob,Amazon.com Tuxedo Bob co-authored with his wife Susan, Hegel combines his songwriting abilities with his quick wit and love for the English language to weave a tale of whimsy and wonder about a uniquely talented, impeccably dressed, and compulsively honest man. In addition to Tuxedo Bob and Hegel's extensive music catalogue, he has written a musical thriller, The Mirror of Mister Moore, an action/detective screenplay, All That Glitter, and a stage play, And Then‚Ä¶ What?.

The Orange Guard (Bulgarian: –û—Ä–∞–Ω–∂–µ–≤–∞ –≥–≤–∞—Ä–¥–∏—è) was a Bulgarian paramilitary organization, belonging to the Bulgarian Agrarian National Union (BANU). It existed during the time that the agrarian leader Aleksandar Stamboliyski served as Prime Minister (1919-1923), both serving as his bodyguards and enacting the government's radical land reform policies. The militia was unofficially named the Orange Guard by the opposition, in reference to BANU's official color. The radical left-wing politician and one-time leader of the Radomir Rebellion of 1918, Rayko Daskalov (who held several ministerial posts in the BANU government), personally commanded the Orange Guard, having suggested its creation. The militia was involved in a number of violent confrontations with the political opposition, such as quelling the large transport strike of 1919-1920 (organized by Communists, Anarchists and Socialists) and attacking the founding convention of the right-wing Constitutional Bloc in 1922. It also clashed with the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization. After Benito Mussolini held his March on Rome in October 1922, the National Alliance (a military-academic opposition group) considered launching a \\"March on Sofia\\", but abandoned the idea out of fear for Orange Guard retaliation. When the Agrarian government was ousted in a coup d'√©tat led by the military and a coalition of right-wing parties, in cooperation with the IMRO and agents from Fascist Italy, most of the Orange Guard was concentrated in the capital of Sofia. The attack came as a surprise to the peasant militiamen, who were quickly disarmed. The organization was later dissolved by the new government of Aleksandar Tsankov. Rayko Daskalov, the Orange Guard commander, was assassinated on August 23 in Prague (where he had formed a BANU government in exile) on orders of the IMRO leader Todor Aleksandrov.

She noted: ‚Äú...each of these periods, of course, has been tied together with a primary interest of communicating the human spirit‚Äôs adventure through time. Obviously, though he titles these paintings with space age titles‚ÄîNebula Near Saturn and that kind of thing‚Äîthese are not science fiction paintings; these are paintings about the adventure of the human spirit.‚ÄùEmmerich Oross, Producer & Director; Dianne Perry Vanderlip speaking in Vance Kirkland‚Äôs Visual Language, an hour television documentary for PBS stations (Denver, CO: KRMA-TV, Denver [now Rocky Mountain PBS], 1994), DVD. Dianne Perry Vanderlip served as Curator of Modern and Contemporary Art at the Denver Art Museum from 1978 to 2007. =Periods= Kirkland created about 1,200 paintings during his lifetime, spanning 5 painting periods and more than 30 series.Hugh A. Grant \\"Part II: Individual Periods of Paintings.\\" In Vance Kirkland Retrospective ed. Yevgenia Petrova. (Saint Petersburg, Russia: State Russian Museum, 2000). 178‚Äì212. In the catalog for his 1978 retrospective exhibition at the Denver Art Museum, Denver, Colorado, Kirkland said, ‚ÄúIt has been absolutely necessary for me to change directions in order to avoid repetition. Whenever a cycle of ideas seemed satisfactory, I knew I had done that and needed to move on and develop a greater challenge. Then the paintings remained fresh and were, I hoped, improved, and I avoided boredom.‚ÄùLewis Story and Dianne Perry Vanderlip, ‚ÄúAn Interview with Vance Kirkland,‚Äù in Vance Kirkland FIFTY YEARS (Denver, CO: The Denver Art Museum, 1978), 13. One of the most important observations about Kirkland‚Äôs career, made by museum scholars as documented below, is that he created something significant in each of his five painting periods. When his works were given exhibitions at 11 European museums and 2 exhibition halls, from 1997 to 2000, each of those 13 shows included all 5 of Kirkland's periods, ranging from the 1930s to the late 1970s.Catalogs were produced in nine languages and always English, with illustrations of the paintings (varying from 1930‚Äì1978 to 1929‚Äì1981). {style=\\"margin:0 auto;\\" Red Rocks in April, c.1935, watercolor on paper, by Vance Kirkland.

Designed Realism (1926‚Äì1944): Vance Kirkland‚Äôs first painting period, Designed Realism, consists of mostly watercolor and some oil paint. Lewis Sharp, Denver Art Museum Director, and former Curator, Metropolitan Museum, New York, stated, ‚Äú‚Ä¶he handled this [watercolor] medium as well as any American artist ever has. You simply can go back and whether you want to begin with John Singer Sargent, Winslow Homer, Thomas Eakins, or move to the 20th century with John Marin or Charles Burchfield, Vance Kirkland was a master.‚ÄùVance Kirkland Painting (Kaunas, Lithuania: M.

Surrealism (1939‚Äì1954): For his second painting period, Kirkland used mostly watercolor (also some gouache, casein, egg tempera and oil paint). He invented surrealist worlds of deadwood morphing into whimsical creatures, which dwarf pre-historic humans, scampering among the vegetation. Charles Stuckey, Curator of 20th Century Painting and Sculpture, The Art Institute of Chicago, commented, ‚Äú...they show a virtuosity in his control of shape and transparency with the watercolor medium, that enables him to do in watercolor what artists like [Ren√©] Magritte and [Salvador] Dal√≠ would be doing in oil at the same time...‚ÄùVance Kirkland Painting (Kaunas, Lithuania: M. K. ƒåiurlionis National Museum of Art, 1997) 37. Dr. Charles Stuckey was Curator of 20th Century Painting and Sculpture at The Art Institute of Chicago at the time of the quote. Elizabeth Broun, Director of the Smithsonian American Art Museum, further discussed this period: ‚ÄúI find in his surrealist works a charming willingness to contemplate nature as a positive force and evolution as a series of potentials. I think it comes out later in the nebula and dot paintings which give a sense of explosions in space. It‚Äôs a release of energy as a magnificent act of creation.‚ÄùDr. Elizabeth Broun, ‚ÄúThe Paintings of Vance Kirkland,‚Äù in Paintings of Vance Kirkland (Riga, Latvia: Foreign Art Museum, 1998), 91. Dr. Elizabeth Broun is the Director of the Smithsonian American Art Museum and was at the time of the quote ‚ÄúSome of his landscapes have proto- creatures, little animal forms and shapes, biomorphic, evolutionary beings. These sometimes include more or less recognizable little humanoid figures. You sense that he is putting man in his place in nature, showing him as just one of the potential evolutionary paths nature might have taken. It‚Äôs Kirkland‚Äôs way of reducing man back to the scale he may have felt was appropriate.‚Äù Dr. Elizabeth Broun, ‚ÄúThe Paintings of Vance Kirkland,‚Äù in Paintings of Vance Kirkland (Riga, Latvia: Foreign Art Museum, 1998), 92.

Hard Edge Abstraction/Abstractions from Nature (1947‚Äì1957): For his third painting period, Kirkland mostly did hard-edge painting in an abstract way. About half of these paintings are watercolor, half oil. This period includes the Timberline Abstraction series [example from 1953 shown above]. Charles Stuckey analyzed part of this period: ‚ÄúThere is a sense of labyrinth about his line, for example, that is obvious in these timberline abstract paintings‚Äîwhich are ostensibly developed from his meditations on leaves that he would see on the forest floor....some of the early attempts by him to achieve texture look like that wood grain that would obsess him and appear in everything, that one would associate with a table top, then with a sort of still life arranged on it, but a still life that went away and only left these incredible tracings.‚ÄùVance Kirkland Painting (Kaunas, Lithuania: M.

Abstract Expressionism (1950‚Äì1964): For his fourth painting period, Kirkland invented an abstract expressionist technique of mixing oil paint and water together, creating painting surfaces different than any other artist. Richard Brettell, Director, Dallas Museum of Art, discussed these paintings, ‚ÄúThey were painted in the ‚Äò50s and early ‚Äò60s and are a part of the principal contribution of Vance Kirkland to the history of Abstract Expressionism in America....he was making use of the surface of the painting as a kind of battleground between oil and water, these two media liquids that resist each other, and creating these incredible sort of symphonies of color and battles of media that are in many ways interestingly comparable to what was going on in New York and much more powerful visually.‚ÄùEmmerich Oross, Producer & Director; Dr. Richard R.

Brettell was Director of the Dallas Museum of Art at the time of the quote. In 1980, Dr. Brettell was appointed Searle Curator of European Painting at the Art Institute of Chicago. In 1988, he became the McDermott Director of the Dallas Museum of Art (DMA). As of 2014, he is Margaret M. McDermott Distinguished Chair of Art and Aesthetic Studies at the University of Texas at Dallas. There are four main series: Nebulae Abstractions; Roman Related Abstractions; Asian Related Abstractions; Pure Abstractions.Hugh A. Grant, ‚ÄúIV.

Elizabeth Broun commented, ‚ÄúFor my own feelings, the ideas about space, about time, about nebula, about becoming, about creation were fabulously expressed in the ‚Äò50s and early ‚Äò60s...I suspect that the nebula will emerge as an important aspect of his career.‚ÄùVance Kirkland Painting (Kaunas, Lithuania: M.

Charles Stuckey discussed Kirkland‚Äôs Roman and Asian Abstractions from this fourth period, ‚ÄúKirkland traveled widely around the world in the late ‚Äò50s and early ‚Äò60s and brought to the grimy and colorless, dirty, abstract expressionist school a whole variety of color experiences that went way beyond the streets of Manhattan: from the deep red colors of Pompeii and Herculaneum‚Äîthe wall paintings that he saw there‚Äîto the lacquer surfaces of art that he saw in the Far East.‚ÄùVance Kirkland Painting (Kaunas, Lithuania: M.

Experience of Mysteries in Space, 1973, oil paint and water on linen, by Vance Kirkland. } 5\\\\. The Dot Paintings (1963‚Äì1981): For the paintings of his fifth and last period, Kirkland used wooden dowels to place dots of oil paint in various sizes and colors over an interactive background of forms of oil paint and water mixtures (or sometimes, instead, a color gradation background, also done in oil). He invented this technique which appears very different than Pointillism or the Ben-Day Dots of artist Roy Lichtenstein.Pointillist dots are made with dabs of a brush; Lichtenstein made dots using metal screens and stencils. P√©ter Fitz, director of the Kiscelli M√∫zeum, Budapest, stated, ‚ÄúA highly unique period ensued, the long series of ‚ÄòDot Paintings‚Äô. ... This technique might remind one of Pointillism, but only in theory, not in practice...this method is far from that of the Pointillists. The big, organic forms are built up from tiny dots, using powerful, sometimes brutal colors ... The dots of paint are plastic; they protrude from the surface of the painting, almost transforming it to a relief.‚Äù P√©ter Fitz, Vance Kirkland (Budapest, Hungary: Kiscelli M√∫zeum, 1997), 11. There are four main series and some important sub-series: Energy of Vibrations in Space [with sub-series Valhalla, Geometric, Einstein, Open Suns]; Energy of Mysteries in Space; Energy of Explosions in Space; Energy of Forces in Space; and occasionally Pure Abstractions.Hugh A. Grant, ‚ÄúV. (5th Period) THE DOT PAINTINGS (1963-81)‚ÄîEnergy in Space Abstractions,‚Äù in Vance Kirkland Retrospective, ed. Yevgenia Petrova (St. Petersburg, Russia: The State Russian Museum, 2000), 199-211. Charles Stuckey discussed these Dot Paintings, ‚ÄúKirkland‚Äôs last paintings are remarkable. ... he achieved a kind of intensity that otherwise one associates in the history of art with, not only the Orphism and Futurism of the early 20th century, but the madness of Van Gogh. ... Kirkland obviously, from the beginning of his career in the late 1920s, very much wanted to paint like nobody else ever had‚Äîand he actually managed to do it.‚ÄùVance Kirkland Painting (Kaunas, Lithuania: M. K. ƒåiurlionis National Museum of Art, 1997) 41. Dr. Charles Stuckey was Curator of 20th Century Painting and Sculpture at The Art Institute of Chicago at the time of the quote. Richard Brettell pointed out how appropriate the subject and often the titles about ‚Äúenergy‚Äù are to the paintings: ‚Äú... the most vital paintings of his career and the paintings that really, in many senses, sum up his career were painted at the very end of his life when he was really ill, and you would never know that from looking at them. In back of me is a painting which he made in 1977, only four years before his death. It‚Äôs a painting which is immense in its scale, which has a kind of chromatic intensity almost unmatched in 20th century art, which is full of energy‚Äîof a chromatic energy and of energy of design ...‚ÄùEmmerich Oross, Producer & Director; Dr. Richard R.

In a 1978 interview with the Denver Art Museum he stated, ‚ÄúI have always interpreted sound as color. Mahler, Schoenberg, Bartok, Berg, Shostakovich, Prokofiev and Ives all explored new tonalities that aided me in transposing sounds into colors.‚Äù Lewis Story and Dianne Perry Vanderlip, ‚ÄúAn Interview with Vance Kirkland,‚Äù in Vance Kirkland FIFTY YEARS (Denver, CO: The Denver Art Museum, 1978), 33. Although he could derive colors from the music of most composers, he wanted a certain amount of musical dissonance which would give him the desired vibrating color combinations for his paintings, hence his interest primarily in modern composers. Kirkland would listen to musical compositions at home, writing notes on scraps of paper when he heard passages that produced ideas for color schemes in his paintings. He would then go to his studio and employ those combinations of colors, which augmented his own imagination, in his paintings. Kirkland did not simultaneously paint while playing music because he would have been hearing other colors. Later, after he had created about 20% of the painting and had established the dominant colors, he could listen to music which he enjoyed so much. Other famous people with synesthesia include artist David Hockney, composer and band leader Duke Ellington, author Vladimir Nabokov, physicist Richard Feynman and composer Franz Liszt. Exhibitions and collections Kirkland is documented as having 316 exhibitions from 1927 to 2000, in 76 American cities, 31 states, 17 foreign cities and 12 foreign countries. Of those exhibitions, 159 were at museums and 49 were at universities.‚ÄúVance Kirkland Exhibition History,‚Äù in Vance Kirkland Retrospective, ed.

Two additional exhibitions listed 28-page pamphlet, Vance Kirkland (Denver: Kirkland Museum, 2000) which has a complete list of the European exhibitions 1997‚Äì2000. When a show is listed over several years, it is counted as one. Dianne Perry Vanderlip discussed Kirkland‚Äôs exhibition history: ‚ÄúBy 1946, he started his 12-year relationship with the prestigious Knoedler & Company gallery in New York where he received several solo shows and participated in many important group shows. He shared exhibitions with the master surrealist, Max Ernst, whom he deeply admired. ... Kirkland was included in the great exhibitions of Abstract and Surrealist American Art at The Art Institute of Chicago in 1947 and the Reality and Fantasy show at the Walker Art Center (Minneapolis) in 1954. Also during and after World War II, his work was exhibited at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Denver Art Museum, the Worcester Art Museum (Massachusetts), the Moore Institute in Philadelphia...and many other important venues.‚ÄùDianne Perry Vanderlip, ‚ÄúVance Kirkland: A Painter‚Äôs Journey,‚Äù in Vance Kirkland, ed. Peter Weiermair (Zurich & New York: Edition Stemmle, 1998), 17. Dianne Perry Vanderlip served as Curator of Modern and Contemporary Art at the Denver Art Museum from 1978 to 2007.

Educator Kirkland was the Founding Director and Professor of Art of the current University of Denver School of Art from 1929 to 1932, and again from 1946 until his retirement in 1969. From 1932 to 1946, Kirkland ran the Kirkland School of Art at 1311 Pearl Street.Lewis Story and Dianne Perry Vanderlip, Vance Kirkland FIFTY YEARS (Denver, CO: The Denver Art Museum, 1978), 41. His classes were ‚Äúaccredited by the University of Colorado in 1933‚Äù‚Äîthereby ‚Äúinitiating the art program at the University of Colorado Extension Center in Denver [now UCD] and had exchange classes with that institution.‚ÄùHugh A.

Thus Kirkland founded three art schools by the age of 28. Kirkland Museum In 1996, 15 years after Kirkland's death, the Vance Kirkland Foundation was established to preserve the works of Kirkland and other Colorado artists. In 2003, Kirkland Museum of Fine & Decorative Art opened in Denver to further that mission and to display Colorado and regional fine art along with an international decorative art collection spanning from the Arts & Crafts movement, Aesthetic, Art Nouveau, Glasgow Style, Wiener Werkst√§tte, De Stijl, Bauhaus, Art Deco, Modern, to Pop Art and Postmodern. Kirkland Museum opened March 10, 2018 in a new 38,500-square-foot building, designed by Jim Olson of Seattle-based Olson Kundig and funded by Merle Chambers Fund. The new location is at 1201 Bannock Street in Denver's Golden Triangle Creative District. Vance Kirkland‚Äôs studio and art school building is the heart of the Kirkland Museum experience. On Sunday, November 6, 2016, in partnership with Mammoth Moving & Rigging Inc. and Shaw Construction, the three-room Vance Kirkland studio building was moved through the neighborhood via eight sets of remote-controlled articulating wheels to its new home eight blocks west at 12th & Bannock, where it is part of the new Kirkland Museum.

In the spring of 2013, job ads by a Hong Kong-based company emerged on various Russian military related websites. The ads promised 5,000 USD per month for guard duties protecting Syrian energy facilities during the Syrian Civil War. The ads attracted the attention of former members of OMON, SOBR, VDV and Spetsnaz; many of them had previous military experience in the Tajikistani Civil War as well as the Second Chechen War. Deployment In 2013, after initially arriving in Beirut, Lebanon, the PMCs were first transferred to Damascus, Syria and then to a Syrian army base in Latakia. By October, the Slavonic Corps had a strength of 267 contractors divided into two companies that were present in Latakia. The contractors were provided with outdated equipment which raised concerns among the participants. They soon realized that the FSB and the Syrian government had no involvement with the operation. Those wishing to return to Russia were left with no choice but to earn their ticket back through direct participation in the Syrian Civil War. The new goal of the Slavonic Corps was described as guarding the oil fields of Deir ez-Zor. Instead of the promised T-72s, the contractors were provided with metal plate-covered buses. On their way to Deir ez-Zor, the column encountered a Syrian air force helicopter which collided with a transmission line and crashed into the caravan, injuring one of the contractors. On 18 October, the column received orders to reinforce Syrian army forces in the city of Al-Sukhnah. Three hours into its journey, the column came under attack. With the aid of a Syrian army self-propelled gun and air support from a single fighter jet, the contractors assumed a defensive position. Jaysh al-Islam fighters numbering from two to six thousand men (according to the Russians) attempted a pincer movement. Vastly outnumbered, the contractors retreated to their vehicles as a desert storm covered the battlefield. In the aftermath of the battle, six Slavonic Corps members were wounded. Having failed to achieve the objectives, the group returned to Russia. Upon arriving at Vnukovo International Airport, the participants were detained by the FSB on suspicion of acting as mercenaries, which is punishable under Article 359 of the Russian criminal law. Despite the fact that the company was registered in Hong Kong, the owners, Gusev and Sidorov, were also charged and convicted in October 2014.

Twice an All-America pick at offensive guard, he was drafted after his senior year by the NFL's Chicago Bears, but Phillips opted to forgo professional football. Phillips chose a business career instead, and is vice president at Bank of Oklahoma. Athletic career Anthony Phillips played for Jenks High School and was selected an All-State defensive tackle. Recruited to the University of Oklahoma to play as a linebacker, Phillips redshirted his first year. As an offensive tackle, the 6'3\\" 274 lb. freshman Phillips played on the 1985 Oklahoma Sooners national championship squad, joining his older brother Jon, who played defensive tackle. Phillips was an All-Big Eight conference pick as an offensive tackle during his national championship freshman year, and selected academic All-Big Eight. In 1986, Phillips was switched to offensive guard his sophomore year and was chosen all-conference and All-America at the new position, as well as academic All-Big Eight; the 1986 Sooners ended the season ranked #2. In his 1987 junior campaign, Phillips returned a starter at offensive guard and was again selected football and academic all-conference; the 1987 Sooners went undefeated during the regular season, but lost the national championship to Miami in the 1988 Orange Bowl. The 1988 Sooners team finished ranked #14, but Phillips was again selected All-Big Eight and consensus All-America, and for the fourth consecutive year, academic all- conference. In addition, in his senior year his commitment to athletics and academics was honored by the College Sports Information Directors of America, selecting him Academic All-America, and the NCAA, naming him one of the Today's Top Six student athletes. During his four seasons, Phillips had been named academic and athletic All-Big Eight each year of his playing career, one of only three OU football players to achieve that accomplishment. But knee injuries before his senior year made playing in the NFL less likely. Phillips was drafted 333rd in the 1989 NFL Draft by the Chicago Bears and attended their spring mini-camp, but he decided against attending their training camp. Later life Phillips had already been working at a brokerage firm in Edmond, Oklahoma and joined them full-time after passing a Series 3 securities test. Phillips later joined Bank of Oklahoma and is currently a vice president of business development. He lives in Tulsa with his wife and three children.

He served on the Court of Appeal for Ontario from 2002 until his retirement in 2013. Before serving on the bench, Armstrong was a partner at Torys and was lead counsel in the Dubin Inquiry on steroid use in Canadian sports. After leaving the bench, Armstrong joined Arbitration Place, a Canadian group specializing in alternative dispute resolution.  Early life and career  Armstrong was born on March 7, 1938. He was a student at Carleton University, the University of Toronto, and the London School of Economics. He earned his LLB from the University of Toronto Faculty of Law in 1965 and was called to the bar two years later in 1967. Armstrong began practicing law with Kimber, Dubin in Toronto. Armstrong joined Torys in Toronto in 1972, where he would stay until his 2002 appointment to the Ontario Court of Appeal. Armstrong became a partner at Torys in 1973, and was appointed a Queen's Counsel in 1978. Armstrong was commission counsel in the 1981 Grange Commission on Railway Safety, which was formed to study the 1979 Mississauga train derailment. According to the Los Angeles Times, Armstrong's \\"tenacious grilling\\" of witnesses in the Grange Commission bolstered his reputation. Armstrong served as lead counsel for the 1989 Dubin Inquiry, a federal inquiry launched after Ben Johnson's doping scandal at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul. Armstrong worked with his mentor Justice Charles Dubin, the chair of the inquiry, to guide the testimony of witnesses such as Ben Johnson, Angella Taylor-Issajenko, Charlie Francis about the extent of their anabolic steroid use and how they avoided discovery. The inquiry recommended random, unannounced drug-testing of athletes to deter the use of anabolic steroids. Armstrong has appeared in important cases including the 1995 case of Hill v. Church of Scientology of Toronto in the Supreme Court of Canada. Armstrong was a bencher of the Law Society of Upper Canada from 1995 to 2002 and the 56th Treasurer of the Law Society of Upper Canada from 1999 to 2001. He is also a former member of the Board of Regents of the American College of Trial Lawyers, and the former president of the Canadian Institute for Advanced Legal Studies.  Ontario Court of Appeal  Armstrong was appointed to the Ontario Court of Appeal on January 25, 2002. He was one of the last judges on the Court of Appeal to not have previously held a judicial position, which was previously a widespread practice for federal appointments. In October 2002, Armstrong was awarded a Doctor of Law (LLD) honorary degree by the Law Society of Upper Canada for his contributions to Canadian law. In December 2008, Armstrong wrote the majority decision upholding a lower court's decision that unions cannot force courts to enforce fines it imposes on its members who cross picket lines. Armstrong, with Justice Paul Rouleau concurring, found that the union's constitution created a power imbalance with its members, making it unconscionable for the court to enforce the fines. Armstrong's colleague, Justice Russell G. Juriansz, dissented saying that the imbalance of power had not been abused and the workers were always free to leave the union. The union in the case applied for leave to appeal the case to the Supreme Court of Canada, but the application was dismissed with costs. In February 2009, Armstrong wrote a decision holding that a defendant had correctly been found guilty of criminal harassment even though there was no previous contact and there was only a single incident, unlike the repetitive nature of traditional stalking cases. Armstrong wrote that this was because the defendant's actions ‚Äì jumping out of a bush at the complainant and chasing her down a street ‚Äì were \\"highly threatening and persistent\\" and had caused the complainant to reasonably fear for her safety. The defendant's application for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court was dismissed. In February 2013, Armstrong, supported by the other two Court of Appeal judges hearing the case, dismissed the appeal in R v Fearon. Armstrong wrote that Fearon's right to privacy was not violated because a cellphone without password protection can be searched by police during an arrest without a warrant. Armstrong's decision was appealed to the Supreme Court, which dismissed the appeal in a 4‚Äì3 decision in 2014. Armstrong became a supernumerary judge for the court in September 2012, and was replaced as a full-time judge by Peter Lauwers from the Ontario Superior Court of Justice. Armstrong retired in March 2013 upon reaching the mandatory retirement age of 75.  Post-judicial career  A year after retiring from the Court of Appeal in 2013, Armstrong joined Arbitration Place, a Canadian arbitration firm, as a resident arbitrator and mediator. Armstrong was also a Distinguished Visiting Jurist for the 2013 ‚Äì 2014 school year at the University of Toronto Faculty of Law.

These airtight suits are used by the U.S. Army Chemical Materials Agency to provide the highest level of protection against chemical agent exposure for workers accessing areas of chemical weapon disposal plants where chemical weapons are disassembled and the agent destroyed. Workers at Pine Bluff Chemical Agent Disposal Facility and other disposal sites have successfully completed tens of thousands of entries into these areas wearing DPE suits. With supporting equipment, the suit weighs about 50 pounds. Donning the suit takes between 30 and 45 minutes, with the assistance of a team of dressers. The suit's primary air supply comes through a hose connection to purified air; a self-contained breathing apparatus provides 8 to 10 minutes of escape air in case the primary supply is disrupted. A heart monitor around the wearer's chest checks for signs of distress. The suit's gloves have three layers, with thick butyl rubber gloves as the top layer, and the feet of the one-piece suit slip into butyl rubber boots that are then sealed to the suit.

The South Somerset district covers an area of ranging from the borders with Devon and Dorset to the edge of the Somerset Levels. It has a population of approximately 162,000. The administrative centre of the district is Yeovil. A scheduled monument is a nationally important archaeological site or monument which is given legal protection by being placed on a list (or \\"schedule\\") by the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport; Historic England takes the leading role in identifying such sites. The legislation governing this is the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979. The term \\"monument\\" can apply to the whole range of archaeological sites, and they are not always visible above ground. Such sites have to have been deliberately constructed by human activity. They range from prehistoric standing stones and burial sites, through Roman remains and medieval structures such as castles and monasteries, to later structures such as industrial sites and buildings constructed for the World Wars or the Cold War. There are 69 scheduled monuments in South Somerset. Some of the oldest are Neolithic, Bronze Age or Iron Age including hillforts, such as Kenwalch's Castle and Bowl barrows. The Romano-British period is represented with several sites including the Low Ham Roman Villa which included an extensive mosaic floor, now on display in the Museum of Somerset. Religious sites are represented by Muchelney Abbey, which was probably founded in the 8th century, and Montacute Priory, a Cluniac priory of the Benedictine order, from the 11th. Bruton Abbey was founded by the Benedictines before becoming a house of Augustinian canons. Stoke sub Hamdon Priory was formed in 1304 as a chantry college rather than a priory. More recent sites include several motte-and-bailey castles such as Cary Castle, and church crosses which date from the Middle Ages. Several packhorse bridges, such as Bow Bridge, Plox also appear in the list. The most recent monuments include the Round House, a village lock-up in Castle Cary dating from 1779, and several duck decoys The monuments are listed below using the titles given in the English Heritage data sheets.

Renaissance Period Andry 16th century Spanish texts talk about the Aztecs use of reduction of fractures, as well intramedullary fixation using fir branches. Peter Lowe was the first surgeon to use the term amputation in his 1597 book A discourse of the Whole Art of Chirurgerie. Nicolas Andry has been credited with the term 'orthopaedics', taken from the title of his 1741 book Orthop√©die on childhood deformity correction. The frontispiece of the book bore an engraving of a sapling being splinted with a stake, a symbol now referred to as the Tree of Andry and adopted by many orthopaedic associations internationally. In 1768, Percivall Pott published his book Some Few Remarks upon Fractures and Dislocations following his compound femoral fracture on the use of splinting to avoid amputation. Pott's student, John Hunter, expanded on the knowledge of bone healing. Around the same time, Jean-Andr√© Venel published his work Orthopaedia, or the Art of Preventing and Correcting Deformities in Children, one of the first surgeons to discuss the practical application for treating congenital deformities. Modern Period Even after the Medical Act 1858 , bonesetters continued to practice unlicensed within England, with one of the last being Evan Thomas. His son, Hugh Owen Thomas, is considered by many to be the father of modern orthopaedics in the UK, with many published works such as Diseases of the hip, knee and ankle joints (1876), Principles of the treatment of diseased joints (1883), The principles of the treatment of fractures and dislocations (1886), Fractures, dislocations, diseases and deformities of the bones of the trunk and upper extremities (1887) and Fractures, dislocations, deformities and diseases of the lower extremities (1890)'. The use of his traction splint during the First World War lead to a dramatic reduction in the mortality following femoral fractures. Thomas' nephew, Robert Jones continued his work, and was the first person to publish on the use of radiography in orthopaedics. The developing field of orthopaedics was originally focused on deformities in children, and subsequently adults. The involvement of orthopaedics in trauma care developed in the course of World War I, the interwar period, and World War II. It was not until after World War II that orthopaedics became the dominant field treating fractures in much of the world. Later in the 20th century, John Charnley pioneered hip replacement, as well as published on the conservative treatment of fractures.

Overview Born in a noble family, C√≥sida specialized in mural paintings and altarpieces (of which he came to decorate over twenty five, although most are now lost). He was active in the province of Zaragoza, and performed meticulous work, especially in the treatment of the feminine figure, and had great capacity for work dedicating nearly sixty years of his life to painting. Style He is credited with having introduced the style of Raphael in Spain, perhaps as a result of having trained in Valencia with Vicente Masip, as he never traveled to Italy. He also demonstrated the influences of Albrecht D√ºrer; especially in his drawing. A great innovator and pioneer of Renaissance painting in Aragon, together with the Italian Tom√°s Peliguet, his style highlights the intricacy of detail, the elegance of gestures and faces, the stylization of the canon and elaborate spatial compositions. Works He was artistic adviser to Hernando de Arag√≥n, Archbishop of Zaragoza (who in turn was his main sponsor), which allowed him to work in the local Cathedral and maintain a workshop in the city. His earliest surviving work consists of some paintings and the Altarpiece of San Juan Bautista de Tarazona Cathedral, dating around the 1530s. His style evolved in the middle of the sixteenth century into a mannerism where he absorbed the lessons of masters like Raphael or inspiring Leonardo da Vinci, as shown in table Birth of St. John the Baptist altarpiece of the Charterhouse of Aula Dei, painted around 1580, one of his best works. One work executed by C√≥sida The Glorification of the Virgin is part of the National Inventory of Continental European Paintings collection.

In the first half of the 1st millennium BC the climate of Italy was more humid and cool than now and the presently arid south saw more precipitation. The northern regions were situated in the temperate climate zone, while the rest of Italy was in the subtropics, having a warm and mild climate. During the annual melt of the mountain snow even small rivers would overflow, swamping the terrain (Tuscany and the Pontine Marshes were deemed impassable in antiquity). The existence of Roman civilization (including the Eastern Roman Empire) spanned three climatological periods: Early Subatlantic (900 BC‚Äì175 AD), Mid-Subatlantic (175‚Äì750) and Late Subatlantic (since 750). The written, archaeological and natural-scientific proxy evidence independently but consistently shows that during the period of the Roman Empire's maximum expansion and final crisis, the climate underwent changes. The Empire's greatest extent under Trajan coincided with the Roman climatic optimum. The climate change occurred at different rates, from apparent near stasis during the early Empire to rapid fluctuations during the late Empire. Still, there is some controversy in the notion of a generally moister period in the eastern Mediterranean in AD‚Äì600 AD due to conflicting publications. Stable climate Leopards on the Magerius Mosaic from modern Tunisia. Numerous Roman mosaics from North African sites depict fauna now found only in tropical Africa, although it's unclear whether any climate change contributed to that. Throughout the entire Roman Kingdom and the Republic there was the so-called Subatlantic period, in which the Greek and Etruscan city-states also developed. It was characterized by cool summers and mild, rainy winters. At the same time there were a number of severe winters, including the complete freezing of the Tiber in 398 BC, 396 BC, 271 BC and 177 BC. In subsequent centuries the reports of occasional harsh winters became associated with flooding rather than ice on the Tiber. Evidence for a cooler Mediterranean climate in 600 BC‚Äì100 BC comes from remains of ancient harbors at Naples and in the Adriatic which are located about one meter below current water level. Edward Gibbon, citing ancient sources, thought that the Rhine and the Danube were frequently frozen, facilitating the invasion of barbarian armies into the Empire \\"over a vast and solid bridge of ice\\". Suggesting colder climate, Gibbon also contended that during Caesar's time reindeer were commonly found in the forests of modern Poland and Germany, whereas in his time reindeer were not observed south of the Baltic. During the reign of Augustus the climate became warmer and the aridity in North Africa persisted. The biotopes of Heterogaster urticae, which in Roman times occurred farther north than in the 1950s, suggest that in the early Empire mean July temperatures were at least 1 ¬∞C above those of the mid-20th-century. Pliny the Younger wrote that wine and olives were cultivated in more northerly parts of Italy than in the previous centuries, as did Saserna in the last century BC (both father and son). =Winds= A comparison of modern wind roses with the situation in the 1st century AD shows some differences: in that time northern inflows in winter were quite rare. The typical northwest winds which regularly blew in July are presently non-existent. The sea breeze began a month earlier, in April. Vitruvius mentioned moisture-carrying winds blowing from the south or west which could damage books. There is also evidence indicating that in the Roman period Mediterranean climate was influenced by low frequency fluctuations in sea level pressure over the North Atlantic, called the Centennial North Atlantic Oscillation (CNAO). =Precipitation= During the Second Punic War, the Mediterranean coast saw such powerful storms that the Roman fleet was destroyed twice (in 249 BC and 225 BC). This was followed by drought in Italy in 226 BC, which lasted six months. In December of 170 BC there was a blood rain in Rome. Written sources from about 75 BC to AD also emphasize moisture, mainly in the form of the Tiber floods in Rome. Large Tiber floods occurred in 5 (lasted seven days), 15, 36, 51, 69, 79 and 97 AD. Starting from the Roman annexation of Egypt in 30 BC and until 155 AD favorable floods occurred more frequently in the Nile. The winter of 69/70 AD was the driest known to Tacitus when he wrote his Histories around 100 AD; exactly at the same time the dry season persisted in the Americas. Dry conditions returned during the reign of Hadrian. In Timgad ‚Äì on Hadrian's visit to that city in 133 rain fell for the first time in five years. Some parts of the empire, however, saw better precipitation. A weather diary, compiled by Ptolemy in Alexandria in around 120, mentioned rain in every month except August and thunder throughout the summer. It helps to explain the agricultural prosperity of Roman Africa (the granary of Rome), and the prosperity of southern Spain in the Roman era. According to Rhoads Murphey, the total yearly grain supply from North Africa to Rome, \\"estimated as enough to feed about 350,000 people, is by no means impossible to produce for export under present conditions\\". Columella's weather calendar suggests that summer precipitation in southern Italy, particularly in Rome and Campania, occurred more often than now. Unusually high precipitation levels were in Roman Spain during the so-called Iberian‚ÄìRoman Humid Period. Roman Spain experienced three major phases: the most humid interval in 550‚Äì190 BC, an arid interval in 190 BC‚Äì150 AD and another humid period in 150‚Äì350. In 134 BC the army of Scipio Aemilianus in Spain had to march at night due to extreme heat, when some of its horses and mules died of thirst (even though earlier, in 181 BC, heavy spring rains prevented the Celtiberians from relieving the Roman siege of Contrebia). Through the 2nd century AD warm temperatures dominated particularly in the Austrian Alps, punctuated by further cool spells from to 180. After about 200 the temperatures fluctuated, trending toward cool. Environmental issues and climate change According to Sheldon Judson, in the 2nd century BC the rate of soil erosion in Latium increased ten times, which is associated with the increased number of settlements in south Etruria. Additionally, from the foundation of Rome until possibly 165 AD, the Romans deforested huge areas for arable land. In 61 AD Seneca the Younger described the high level of air pollution in Rome, which was associated with the extensive wood burning for fuel. From to there was a period of cooling, which affected the northwestern provinces of the Empire. Dendrochronology indicates that severe drought which began in 338 and persisted until 377 forced the nomadic pastoral federation of Huns to seek pastures and predation farther to the west and south. Their attacks north of the Black Sea drove the Goths to flee into the Roman Empire and ultimately to attack it (particularly in the Battle of Adrianople). Increased climate variability from to 600 coincided with the decline of the Western Roman Empire. For the Eastern Roman Empire there is an evidence for a regional prolonged drought in modern central Turkey in ‚Äì540 AD.

The existence of the awards was also confirmed by Yaroslav Roshchupkin, an employee of the Central Military press service. The medal was awarded to military and civilian personnel of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation for services and distinction displayed during the Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation, the March 16, 2014 Crimean status referendum, and the entry of Crimea into the Russian Federation as the result of the referendum. The medal can also be awarded to other citizens of the Russian Federation and to foreign citizens for assistance in solving the tasks assigned to the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation relating to these security measures taken in the Crimea. Reverse of the medal As it can be seen at the photo of the reverse side of the medal Russian Defense Ministry has clearly indicated the term of the campaign: February 20 ‚Äî March 18, 2014. Official date of the beginning of the \\"Return of Crimea\\" operation appears February 20 when Viktor Yanukovych was yet an acting head of Ukrainian state. In fact, only the next day President Yanukovych left Kiev, and it was already 22 February 2014 when the Parliament of Ukraine adopted the Resolution \\"On the dissociation of the President of Ukraine from fulfillment of constitutional powers and appointment of early presidential elections in Ukraine\\", used by Russia as a pretext for accusations of the alleged \\"unconstitutional coup in Ukraine\\". The fact that (according to the medal) Crimea started its \\"homing\\" to Russia two days before Yanukovych's removal from power and his resignation from the post of the President of Ukraine can be considered as an indirect proof that Russia launched its operation against Ukraine of seizing Crimean peninsula on February 20, 2014.

Downtown Summerlin is a commercial and residential neighborhood located in Summerlin South, a suburban area on the western outskirts of Las Vegas, Nevada. The Downtown Summerlin neighborhood includes: * The Downtown Summerlin shopping center * The Red Rock Casino, Resort & Spa * The City National Arena (the team headquarters for the Vegas Golden Knights NHL franchise and the UNLV Rebels hockey program) * The Las Vegas Ballpark (the home of the Las Vegas Aviators minor league baseball team) * One Summerlin (a nine-story office tower) and Two Summerlin (a six-story office tower) * Constellation and Tanager (apartment complexes) The area is bounded by Sahara Avenue to the south, CC 215 to the west, Charleston Boulevard to the north, and Town Center Drive to the east.  History  Downtown Summerlin is located in the community of Summerlin South, Nevada, in a village known as Summerlin Centre, which is bordered by Charleston Boulevard to the north, Sahara Avenue to the south, Hualapai Way to the east and Desert Foothills Drive to the west. Downtown Summerlin's north and south boundaries are the same, but it is bordered by the 215 Beltway to the west and Town Center Drive to the east. Aside from being located on 400 acres in the middle of Summerlin Centre, Downtown Summerlin was also once planned under the name \\"Summerlin Centre\\". The Howard Hughes Corporation began planning Summerlin, Nevada in the late 1980s, along with plans to build a town center, which would ultimately become the village of Summerlin Centre. Tom Warden, vice president of community relations for Howard Hughes Corporation, said the village of Summerlin Centre would be \\"the center of Summerlin geographically, as well as many other ways. It will be the center of entertainment, business, retail, culture and education.\\" The town center would include a shopping mall, office space, and a casino resort, as well as movie theaters and restaurants. The planned Summerlin Town Center project would include the proposed mall as well as office space. The project would be developed by The Rouse Company and its subsidiary, The Howard Hughes Corporation. Development of the Summerlin Centre village was underway in 1999. The village was expected to take five years to complete, with the mall scheduled to open in 2004. By December 2003, the upcoming Red Rock Resort by Station Casinos was intended as the centerpiece of a planned downtown Summerlin area, known then as Summerlin Centre or Summerlin Town Centre. Summerlin Town Centre would include the proposed mall ‚Äì rescheduled to open in 2006 or 2007 ‚Äì as well as office and residential components. A groundbreaking ceremony was held for the Red Rock Resort on April 15, 2004. Later that year, General Growth Properties (GGP) purchased The Rouse Company and its Howard Hughes subsidiary, gaining control of property that was intended for other portions of the Summerlin Centre project. In October 2005, ground was broken on the property for a new headquarters for Business Bank of Nevada. Summerlin Centre was to feature at least of office space upon completion. The Red Rock Resort opened in April 2006, as part of the Summerlin Centre project. In May 2006, GGP announced details regarding the 400-acre mixed-use project, which would feature of retail space, including four anchor stores. Other planned features of Summerlin Centre included restaurants; office space; a 250-room, 11-story hotel; and at least 5,500 residences, ranging from houses to condominiums. GGP planned to begin construction of Summerlin Centre in spring 2007, with a grand opening scheduled for fall 2008. Construction on the mall stopped in 2008, as GGP was experiencing financial difficulties. Construction of an office building, part of the mixed-use project, was also halted. The Howard Hughes Corporation took over the mixed-use project in 2010. One Summerlin office building (center) and surrounding mall buildings during construction (October 2013) By December 2012, the Howard Hughes Corporation had plans for 200 acres of vacant land located along the east side of the 400-acre parcel. The eventual plans would include residential, office, and entertainment space. There was also the possibility of a baseball stadium being built on the land. The Howard Hughes Corporation resumed construction of the mixed-use project in July 2013. By that time, there were also plans to include a 9,000-seat baseball stadium for the Las Vegas 51s team. It would be developed by the Howard Hughes Corporation and Play Ball Owners Group, both owners of the team. It would be built on 20 acres, at a cost of $60 million. In November 2013, it was stated that the 400-acre Summerlin Centre project would eventually become known as Downtown Summerlin. The mall component, once known as The Shops at Summerlin, was touted as the beginning of the Downtown Summerlin project, although several buildings had already existed within the 400-acre project, including the Red Rock resort, a fitness center, and the bank building. The final cost of Downtown Summerlin, including the Red Rock Resort and future development, was expected to total at least $1 billion. Howard Hughes Corporation added traffic lights and sidewalks in one area to provide nearby residents with easy pedestrian access to Downtown Summerlin and the Red Rock Resort. Both businesses were expected to benefit from one another. The resort also underwent a $35 million renovation that was timed to coincide with the opening of the Downtown Summerlin shopping center. = Shopping center = The Downtown Summerlin shopping center opened on October 9, 2014, with 85 of its 125 stores ready for business. Additional stores were scheduled to open in the coming months. The shopping center also includes various restaurants and a Regal Cinemas movie theater. The shopping center is located on , and had 2,000 employees at the time of its opening. The retail component was considered the first phase of Downtown Summerlin, while the second phase would consist of a residential component. = Office space = One Summerlin, a LEED-certified, nine-story office building, opened at Downtown Summerlin in April 2015. It includes of Class A office space. According to Howard Hughes CEO David Weinreb, One Summerlin is what makes Downtown Summerlin a \\"downtown,\\" saying, \\"There was never a question that we needed to build the office building to really ground it as a downtown.\\" The tower is located within the shopping center. The ground floor contains retail space, while the remaining floors are dedicated to office tenants. The tower's first office tenant, BusinesSuites, signed up to occupy approximately of space in May 2014. Other office tenants have included Fox Rothschild and Ballard Spahr. Some tenants in the building received discounted memberships to the TPC at Summerlin golf course, making it the only office tower in the Las Vegas Valley to do so. By December 2016, Howard Hughes Corporation was planning to add a second office tower. Two Summerlin, a six-story Class A office building with , was opened in August 2018. The building cost $49 million, and is located on Downtown Summerlin's east parcel, across from the Red Rock Resort. The Howard Hughes Corporation relocated its headquarters to Two Summerlin in July 2019. Other major tenants have included Greenberg Traurig, CliftonLarsonAllen, and WeWork. = Residential = Downtown Summerlin's second phase, being planned as of 2014, would involve housing development on the land along the eastern side of the parcel. The second phase would have 4,000 housing units, including townhouses, apartments, and residential buildings up to 20 stories in height. Over the next decade, the housing development was expected to have capacity for up to 10,000 residents. There were no plans to include single-family homes. In April 2014, the Howard Hughes Corporation announced plans for the first residential project in Downtown Summerlin: a three-story, 124-unit, gated apartment complex. It would be a joint venture of the Hughes Corporation and Calida Group, built on 4.5 acres, located northeast of the shopping center. Construction of the apartment complex, named Constellation, began in late 2014. The name is a reference to the Lockheed Constellation, which was financed by Howard Hughes during the 1940s and 1950s. Completion was originally scheduled for late 2015, but was delayed until the following year. Construction was scheduled to conclude in October 2016, although some residents began moving in two months prior. In September 2017, Howard Hughes Corporation was planning a second Downtown Summerlin apartment complex, to be built on nine acres at the northeast corner of Sahara Avenue and Pavilion Center Drive. Construction of the new $59 million apartment complex was underway in February 2018, and the name was unveiled to be \\"Tanager\\" the following year. Like the Constellation, Tanager is also named after an airplane, the Curtiss Tanager. Future residential projects in Downtown Summerlin will continue the theme of aviation names to reflect Hughes' aviation career. The first residents began moving into Tanager in August 2019. The complex has 267 units. It is the first apartment complex in Summerlin to be designed entirely by Howard Hughes Corporation. = Other development = The City National Arena opened at Downtown Summerlin in 2017, followed by the Las Vegas Ballpark in 2019; both are located on Downtown Summerlin's eastern 200-acre parcel, and are north of the Tanager apartment complex. As of 2019, there were 160 remaining acres awaiting development in Downtown Summerlin. Future development over the next 10 years would include more businesses and more than 4,000 residential units, to be built near the ballpark and City National Arena. In addition to more residential projects, other plans would include additional office and retail space. In December 2018, plans were approved for a 14-story, 170-foot-tall hotel to be built on 4.3 acres directly south of the ballpark. The hotel would include 267 rooms, a restaurant, a spa, and a rooftop bar, as well as a two-level parking garage.  Gallery  File:DowntownSummerlin3.pngTree-lined street in Downtown Summerlin.

Biography  His father was a merchant. He was originally admitted to the √âcole nationale des beaux-arts de Lyon in 1860, then moved to Paris in 1864 to serve an apprenticeship in the studios of Alexandre Cabanel. In the Franco-Prussian War, he helped defend the barricades during the Siege of Paris.*Peintre Officiel de la Marine website: Two short biographies. This experience inspired his first series of paintings devoted to military life. A holiday in North Africa inspired a similar series of works devoted to the Colonial Troops. Beginning in 1880, he devoted himself almost exclusively to painting the ships and sailors of the French Navy, which earned him official recognition. He was appointed a \\"Peintre de la Marine\\" in 1890 and awarded the L√©gion d'honneur in 1897.Base L√©onore: Dossier for the L√©gion d'honneur of L√©on Couturier.

As head of the General Press and Typography Directorate from 1951 to 1973, Ardeleanu was one of the chief enforcers of censorship in Communist Romania. His obtuseness, intolerance and dogmatism became legendary. Between 1956 and 1958, he formed part of a team that investigated and monitored the ousted, Imre Nagy-led Hungarian government being held under arrest at Snagov.

It was one of the most significant discoveries made by an Irish doctor. Biography MacMunn was born on 11 April 1852 in Easkey, County Sligo, Ireland, the son of James MacMunn MD. He was educated at Trinity College Dublin, graduating BA with honours in 1871, MB in 1872, MD in 1875. He moved to Wolverhampton in 1873 to work within his cousin's practice, subsequently taking over the practice on his cousins death. He had a loft of his stable converted to a laboratory work he could carry out work on his spectroscopy when not otherwise engaged with the practice. He was the author of numerous papers on medicine, physiology and biology. His seminal paper was published in 1880 entitled \\"The Spectroscope in Medicine\\". Serious criticism of his work led to it being discredited at the time, over 40 years later work by David Keilin using similar equipment vindicated MacMunnn's work. He was appointed Honorary Pathologist and Physician to the General Hospital Wolverhampton in 1889. Following his difficulties in the vindication of his work MacMunn subsequently had a distinguished career as a Medical Officer in the military. His military career took him to South Africa, he was appointed Staff-Officer to the Royal Hospital Commissions during the Boer War. He was mentioned in dispatches and awarded the Queens South Africa medal with three clasps. He retired in 1909, and ill health led to his death on 18 February 1911. References * Mac Munn, C.

The women and children were released three days later, but the abductors kept five men. Forty-eight hours later, the Gulf Cartel contacted the family members who had been released to negotiate a ransom. After several days of negotiation and several ransom payments totaling US$100,000, the C√°zares were called to deliver their final payment on 27 July. They sent the money to the kidnappers and waited at a specified location for a white van the kidnappers promised would deliver their remaining family members. However, the van never arrived and the phone the kidnappers used to contact the C√°zares went out of service. The family then decided to contact the authorities for a criminal investigation. The mass kidnapping of the C√°zares family stands out from other abduction cases in Mexico because all eighteen victims were related. Among them were three U.S. citizens. The family has sent letters to officials at all levels of the Mexican government and has reached out to international heads of state for assistance with the case. The kidnapping remains unsolved; the whereabouts of the five remaining abductees, and the motive behind their kidnapping, are officially unknown. Mexican government sources, however, agree that the kidnapping was masterminded by the top echelons of the Gulf Cartel. Kidnapping At around 5:00 a.m. on 9 July 2011, at least eight gunmen aligned with the Gulf Cartel entered the first C√°zares' family home in the San Francisco neighborhood of Matamoros, Tamaulipas, Mexico, to carry out a kidnapping. This house was owned by Rodolfo C√°zares Garza. The kidnappers were wearing military-style uniforms and ski masks. However, the victims noticed they were sporting white-colored sneakers, speaking vulgarities, and looking for valuable possessions in the house, which suggested they were not law enforcement or military personnel. They stormed the home's bedrooms to round up the victims before blindfolding them (except for two children). Once the kidnappers ordered the patriarch to open the family's safe, they forced the family into their vehicles before taking off. By 7:00 am, the Gulf Cartel kidnappers reached the second C√°zares' home in the R√≠o neighborhood and forced the family to open their front door. \\"We have your brother\\", one of the kidnappers said as the others guarded the entrance booth to the neighborhood with assault rifles. Four more relatives were kidnapped at the second home, owned by Rodolfo's brother H√©ctor C√°zares Garza. However, one family member managed to escape through the back door of the house before running to a third C√°zares' home a few blocks away. A few minutes later, the kidnappers made their way into the third house, owned by Alberto C√°zares Garza, one of the brothers. By 8:00 am, 18 members of the C√°zares family had been kidnapped. This mass abduction stood out from other kidnapping cases in Mexico because all the victims were related. Location of Matamoros, Tamaulipas (red spot) within Mexico Six of the C√°zares men, Rodolfo C√°zares Garza, Manuel Alberto C√°zares Garza, H√©ctor C√°zares Garza, Rodolfo Ignacio C√°zares Sol√≠s, Rub√©n Luna Mendoza, and Rodolfo Garza Sol√≠s, were kept together. The women and children, along with one of the grandfathers, were kept in a separate vehicle throughout most of the first day. After leaving the house, the captors drove them around the city for several hours and switched them into different vehicles on busy streets in broad daylight. The kidnappers stole several of the vehicles from the families' homes. According to one family member, the kidnappers even stopped for gas and did not pay for the service. In their portable radio conversations while driving, the family heard them speaking about avoiding Los Zetas, the rival crime syndicate of the Gulf Cartel. That evening, the women were taken to a hostage safe house where at least twenty other men were drinking and smoking cannabis. The windows in this undisclosed location were covered. A shootout broke out near the premises. The abductees were blindfolded, seated next to a corpse, and transported to a different location in another SUV. The C√°zares had the impression the kidnappers were looking for a place to hide them. The family believes the kidnappers moved them around Matamoros for hours because they did not expect to find the number of people they had in the houses where they carried out the abductions. Despite the turmoil, the kidnappers tried to keep the victims calm. They told the family they had inadvertently mistaken their identities and that they were going to be released. \\"We're from the Gulf Cartel\\", one of them told them. \\"We're the good guys\\". The women said that although they were scared of a few of their captors, for the most part, the kidnappers treated them well. The C√°zares recall younger members of the kidnapping ring were the kindest, gave the adults bread and milk, and the children juice to drink. Some of them allowed the victims to remove their blindfolds while the gang's boss was gone. The women and children were kept in a safe house with gunmen for another three days. On 11 July, the kidnappers released the women and children around midnight at a Walmart parking lot. Five C√°zares men, however, remained in captivity. Rodolfo Garza Sol√≠s, 82, was released by his captors sixteen days after the kidnapping. Ransoming On 13 July, the kidnappers contacted Sergio C√°zares Garza, one of the family members who lived in Texas and told him that his kidnapped relatives would be released if the family paid a ransom. Initially, the family said they could pay only a few thousand dollars, but the captors allowed them at least two days to collect more money. In total, the C√°zares made four different payments to the kidnappers in Matamoros totalling US$100,000. The first payment was delivered to a grocery store parking lot; the second was left behind a fast-food eatery. The kidnappers communicated with the C√°zares family hiding in Texas by telephone. A trusted family employee in Matamoros made the cash deliveries. Each time a delivery was made, the Gulf Cartel sent a different envoy to pick up the money. During the ransoming process, the C√°zares were allowed to talk with the hostages on three occasions. In their first phone conversation, the victims talked about their concern for their wives and children. Their second conversation, however, was a lot shorter and emotional for the C√°zares. By 27 July, the kidnappers said they needed a final cash delivery to release their captives. The C√°zares sent the money to Matamoros from Texas and eagerly awaited at a prearranged location for a white van that was supposed to deliver their relatives. The van never came and the phone line the family used to contact the kidnappers was out of service. Weeks after that, the family decided to contact law enforcement. Initial proceedings Once the C√°zares decided to ask for help from law enforcement, the local police stated that they were going to investigate the case. However, about a month later, they wrote to the C√°zares saying the case was outside their jurisdiction. The family tried to contact the police by e-mail and telephone, and even attempted to contact the mayor of Matamoros, Alfonso S√°nchez Garza, but their messages were not answered. On 13 September 2011, the C√°zares issued a formal complaint at the Public Ministry of Matamoros (Spanish: Ministerio P√∫blico de Matamoros) and the case was opened by state authorities in Ciudad Victoria, Tamaulipas. A family member who was a U.S. citizen also contacted the FBI and asked them for help with the case. It was brought to the attention of Texas Governor Rick Perry, who promised to support the investigation. A few weeks after that, one of the alleged kidnappers was arrested in Texas following a traffic violation. That same month, a Tamaulipas' anti-kidnapping squad began to work on the case and collected testimony from the C√°zares who had been kidnapped and released. Location of Tamaulipas (red) within Mexico In October 2011, Mexican Navy soldiers visited the three houses where the C√°zares were abducted to investigate the crime scenes. In November 2011, Mexican security forces arrested two suspects on federal charges for drug and weapons offenses. According to the agency's investigator, Manuel Adolfo Benavides Parra, the C√°zares identified the two men as part of the Gulf Cartel kidnapping ring. However, since the two suspects were arrested under federal charges, his agency was prevented from interrogating them. At the same time, a Tamaulipas law enforcement official stated that the case was under state jurisdiction and refused to comment on the two detainees arrested for federal offenses. U.S. authorities also did not provide details on the other alleged suspect arrested in Texas. In November 2011, a friend of the C√°zares managed to put them in contact with Deputy Interior Secretary Felipe Zamora Castro, a high-ranking official within the Mexican government, who said he was willing to help with the kidnapping investigation. A couple of days after being in contact with the family, however, Zamora died in a helicopter accident along with Secretary of the Interior Francisco Blake Mora. In December 2011, the C√°zares case was received by Gualberto Ram√≠rez, coordinator of the Anti-Kidnapping Unit of the now-defunct Subprocuradur√≠a de Investigaci√≥n Especializada en Delincuencia Organizada (SIEDO), Mexico's organized crime investigatory agency. By 2012, the C√°zares claimed the Tamaulipas' agency had not questioned potential suspects or eyewitnesses to the kidnapping, nor had they visited the locations relevant to the case. The C√°zares have insisted that authorities should start by investigating the house where they were taken following their kidnapping, given that it is located just a block away from a busy street in Matamoros. In March 2012, an electricity bill was found on the door of the premises. The bill showed that there was significant electricity use during the month the family was kidnapped, and the last time someone paid the bill was in January 2011. A neighbor who lived near the house where the C√°zares were held hostage said he did not know who the owners of the property were but acknowledged seeing suspicious activity during the evenings. On 7 March, about 10 months after the kidnappings, G√©rald Martin, the general consul of France in Mexico, told the C√°zares family that a squadron of Mexico's Federal Police had been dispatched to Matamoros to work on the case directly. The family claims, however, they are not sure if the investigation was carried out. They said they did not receive any documents concerning the investigation. By October 2012, a criminal court in Jalisco, under Judge Francisco Mart√≠n Hern√°ndez Zaragoza, was assigned to investigate the case. The family claims they do not know the details of his investigation. Letters to heads of state =Mexico= Mexico's President Felipe Calder√≥n in a press conference Exactly six months after the kidnapping, on 9 January 2012, the C√°zares sent a letter to Mexico's former President Felipe Calder√≥n titled \\"Request Special Military and Police Assistance Regarding a Kidnapping in Matamoros\\" (Spanish: Solicitud de ayuda militar y policial especial respecto a un secuestro en Matamoros). Copies of the document were also sent to other high-ranking government officials including: Marisela Morales, the attorney general of Mexico; Eugenio Javier Hern√°ndez Flores, the former governor of Tamaulipas; Egidio Torre Cant√∫, governor of Tamaulipas; Rick Perry, governor of Texas; Alejandro Poir√© Romero, former secretary of Interior; Patricia Espinosa Cantellano, former secretary of Foreign Affairs; Rodolfo Quilant√°n Arenas, Mexican consul in Brownsville, Texas; , Mexico's ambassador to France; Francisco Gonz√°lez D√≠az, Mexico's ambassador to Germany; G√©rald Martin, the general consul of France in Mexico; Guillermo Galv√°n Galv√°n, the secretary of National Defense; General Erwin Rodolfo Sol√≥rzano Barrag√°n of the Mexican Army; Jaime Domingo L√≥pez Buitr√≥n, director of the Center for Research and National Security; Rafael Lomel√≠ Mart√≠nez, former secretary of Public Security in Tamaulipas; Bol√≠var Hern√°ndez Garza, former Tamaulipas attorney general; , director of Mexico's National Human Rights Commission; Luis Gonz√°lez Plascencia, head of Mexico City's Human Rights Commission; Antonio Aranibar Quiroga, Mexico's ambassador to the Organization of American States; and Edgardo Buscaglia, a professor at the Instituto Tecnol√≥gico Aut√≥nomo de M√©xico and organized crime expert. Three days later, the Mexican government replied to the request and stated that the case was given to the , a government agency specializing in aiding victims of violence. The C√°zares claimed, however, that that government agency never contacted them. Attorney General Morales responded the next day by appointing Jos√© Cuitl√°huac Salinas Mart√≠nez, the deputy attorney general of the SIEDO, to work directly on the case. Mexico's President Enrique Pe√±a Nieto in a press conference Ludivine Barbier, a French-native and wife of Rodolfo C√°zares, gathered 72,041 signatures through Change.org in late 2012, and asked Mexican President Enrique Pe√±a Nieto to help bring her husband back. The petition was also directed to politicians Miguel √Ångel Osorio Chong, Luis Videgaray Caso, and Erwin Manuel Lino Z√°rate. In the petition, Barbier complained that Mexican authorities had been silent about the case, and the police have ignored them for over a year. She stated that Pe√±a Nieto had to improve his image abroad and argued that if her petition managed to gather signatures from all over the world, he would have no other option but to work on the case. Barbier also joined in solidarity with Fr√©d√©rique Santal, the sister of Olivier Tschumi, a Swiss native who was kidnapped in Cuernavaca, Morelos in 2010 and remains disappeared. In December 2012, both met in Paris with Mexican peace activist Javier Sicilia, who handed over a petition Mexico's ambassador to France. The petition intended to ask Pe√±a Nieto to enact a law protecting victims of violence in Mexico. Barbier also gave the petition letter for Pe√±a Nieto to Juan Andr√©s Ord√≥√±ez G√≥mez, who managed the administrative duties of the Embassy of Mexico in France and substitutes for Carlos de Icaza Gonz√°lez. =International support= France's President Nicolas Sarkozy in a press conference Given the delays and the perceived unwillingness of Mexican law enforcement to investigate the case, the C√°zares have sought help abroad. Barbier also reached out to Europe and wrote letters to the governments of France and Germany (the former because Rodolfo C√°zares was a French citizen and the latter because he was a symphony conductor with legal residence there). In France, she issued a formal complaint and sent a letter to France's former President Nicolas Sarkozy. In addition, Barbier reached out to the media to talk about the kidnapping and called for the freedom of her husband and family. \\"He is the eighth Frenchman kidnapped in the world, but officially there are no more than seven,\\" said Barbier in a 12 October interview with Le Parisien. France's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Development responded by saying they were working on the case with Mexico and that Rodolfo C√°zares could count on all the consular support he needed due to his French citizenship. She also managed to convince France's President Fran√ßois Hollande to talk about the case with Pe√±a Nieto during his visit to the √âlys√©e Palace on 17 October. She also expressed her interest in involving First Lady Val√©rie Trierweiler. On 5 December, Barbier contacted G√©rald Martin and sent a letter to Los Pinos presidential residence asking for an interview with Pe√±a Nieto. On 11 December, the French government stated that Rodolfo C√°zares was not considered a political hostage and thereby was not included in the list of Frenchmen kidnapped abroad. This came after Barbier demanded that French authorities classify her husband as a political hostage. Barbier believes French authorities were not interested in the case. They were concerned primarily with solving the case surrounding Florence Cassez, a French native who was arrested in Mexico and given a 60-year sentence for reportedly participating in a kidnapping. France's President Francois Hollande in a press conference Barbier also contacted German authorities to work on the case together with them and Mexican authorities. The arts community where Barbier's husband Rodolfo C√°zares worked in Bremerhaven attempted to create a fundraiser for the family to help pay his ransom to the kidnappers. Ingeborg Fischer- Thein, chairman of the International Association of Wagner Societies, where Rodolfo was a member, sent a letter to Germany's and the International Music Council saying the community was looking for ways to help in the case. Fundraisers were carried out at music events and at the apartment complex where Rodolfo and Barbier lived in Bremerhaven. The city's mayor , along with local leader , showed their interest in the case and contacted the Embassy of Mexico in Berlin on 6 December 2011. The C√°zares also contacted the German Foreign Affairs Minister and with Bernd Neumann, who was the representative of the Federal Government for Culture; with the Embassy of Mexico in Berlin and with more municipal authorities in Bremerhaven. The Media and Public Relations Department of the Embassy of Germany in Mexico City stated that they were saddened by the kidnapping, but the case was out of their jurisdiction because Rodolfo was not a German citizen. The family also tried to reach out to the United States and involve it in the case too. Though the five men that are disappeared hold only Mexican citizenship, three of the abductees hold U.S. citizenship and others are legal residents of the U.S. The family wants to the U.S. to investigate the case because they believe the Gulf Cartel fears the involvement of U.S. authorities. The family also sent letters to U.S. President Barack Obama and to Pope Benedict XVI, and asked the latter to speak about the case with President Calder√≥n during his visit to Mexico in March 2012. Barbier also sent letters to Catholic cardinals in the archdioceses of New York, Berlin, Paris, and Munich and Freising, asking them to pray for her family members that were missing. They received the same petition letters the family sent to President Calder√≥n in their respective languages. Possible motives and investigation Office of the General Prosecutor (PGR), which heads the case The motive for the kidnapping is officially unknown, but several lines of inquiry suggest a number of reasons behind the mass abduction. One version is the family was kidnapped because one of the C√°zares' grandfathers had a mistress whose sons were involved with Los Zetas, a rival criminal group of the Gulf Cartel. According to Barbier, her husband's grandfather had an illegitimate son known as Rodolfo C√°zares (alias \\"Rudy\\" and/or \\"El Rudy\\"). She believes Rudy was involved with Los Zetas. Barbier stated that during the abduction the kidnappers asked them several times for \\"El Rudy\\". However, she said her family did not have any contact or relationship with Rudy's family branch. Barbier stated that the kidnappers soon recognized their mistake and released her and some of her family members. In Barbier's opinion, the Gulf Cartel easily confused the C√°zares men with the real target because some of them are also named \\"Rodolfo\\". Mexican investigators believe the Gulf Cartel kidnapped the C√°zares family to get hold of Rudy. He was a former member of the Gulf Cartel but had left the group to join Los Zetas. In April 2012, however, he was arrested with four other people in Olmito, Texas, for aggravated robbery and organized crime charges. The police said he was a local recruiter and drug operator for Los Zetas. Another line of investigation alleges the C√°zares family was kidnapped because the Gulf Cartel was looking for Francisco Ricardo C√°zares (alias \\"El Paco\\"), a drug operator from San Benito, Texas, and the alleged son of one of the victims. Police reports from Tamaulipas describe \\"El Paco\\", and a man known as Rodolfo C√°zares and his sister Angie C√°zares, as the main suspects in a series of grenade attacks carried out in Matamoros in 2010. Law enforcement officers identified \\"El Paco\\" as a member of Los Zetas. Federal sources allege that Rafael C√°rdenas Vela (alias \\"El Junior\\"), a former high-ranking leader of the Gulf Cartel and regional boss of Matamoros, ordered the abduction of the C√°zares family as a reprisal for the attacks. The grenade attacks were carried out in the Municipal City Hall, the Municipal Police Station, the Ministerial Police Station, in the Mexican Army barracks, and in a store in the downtown area. At least nine civilians were injured in the attacks. Subprocuradur√≠a Especializada en Investigaci√≥n de Delincuencia Organizada (SEIDO) federal agency According to federal investigator Rosario G. Sandoval Medina, former high-ranking Gulf Cartel boss Jorge Eduardo Costilla S√°nchez confirmed that C√°rdenas Vela had ordered the mass kidnapping. C√°rdenas Vela became the regional boss of the Gulf Cartel in Matamoros in March 2011, four months before the kidnappings. He was eventually arrested in Texas in October 2011. The SEIDO federal agency, under the directorship of Jos√© Cuitl√°huac Salinas Mart√≠nez, promised to obtain an agreement with U.S. law enforcement to question him about the case. The family, however, expressed their disappointment with both Mexican and U.S. authorities for failing to cooperate. In February 2013, one of the C√°zares family members confirmed to the press that legal procedure to interrogate C√°rdenas Vela had not born fruit. One of the family nephews stated he once saw the vehicles the kidnappers were driving (which were stolen from the C√°zares) in Matamoros. He reportedly called police to let them know, but they were unable to locate the vehicle or the kidnappers. On 28 May 2014, the Mexican Attorney General's Office (PGR) issued an official diary offering a monetary reward of MXN$1,500,000 (approximately US$101,931) to anyone who provides information leading to the five abductees: Rodolfo C√°zares Garza, Manuel Alberto C√°zares Garza, H√©ctor C√°zares Garza, Rodolfo Ignacio C√°zares Sol√≠s, and Rub√©n Luna Mendoza. Another monetary reward of the same amount was offered to anyone who can provide information that leads to the identity, location, and/or arrest of the people who planned and/or executed the kidnapping. The payment methods vary and are under the discretion of the PGR. The PGR vowed that the information provided, as well as the person(s) providing it, would be strictly reserved and anonymous. The reward information was published in several daily newspapers across northeastern Mexico that week.

Computing For a processor or computer designed to simulate a neural network SUPS is measured as the product of simulated neurons N and average connectivity c(synapses) per neuron per second: SUPS = c \\\\times N Depending on the type of simulation it is usually equal to the total number of synapses simulated. In an \\"asynchronous\\" dynamic simulation if a neuron spikes at \\\\upsilon Hz, the average rate of synaptic updates provoked by the activity of that neuron is \\\\upsilon cN. In a synchronous simulation with step \\\\Delta t the number of synaptic updates per second would be \\\\frac{cN}{\\\\Delta t}. As \\\\Delta t has to be chosen much smaller than the average interval between two successive afferent spikes, which implies \\\\Delta t < \\\\frac{1}{\\\\upsilon N}, giving an average of synaptic updates equal to \\\\upsilon c N^2. Therefore, spike-driven synaptic dynamics leads to a linear scaling of computational complexity O(N) per neuron, compared with the O(N2) in the \\"synchronous\\" case.

Each sub-processor can emulate one or more neurons and multiple chips can be grouped together. At 25 MHz it is capable of 1.28 GMAC.Real-Time Computing: Implications for General Microprocessors Chip Weems, Steve Dropsho After the presentation of the RN-100 (12 MHz) single neuron chip at Seattle 1991 Ricoh developed the multi-neuron chip RN-200. It had 16 neurons and 16 synapses per neuron. The chip has on- chip learning ability using a proprietary backdrop algorithm. It came in a 257-pin PGA encapsulation and drew 3.0 W at a maximum. It was capable of 3 GCPS (1 GCPS at 32 MHz). In 1991-97, Siemens developed the MA-16 chip, SYNAPSE-1 and SYNAPSE-3 Neurocomputer. The MA-16 was a fast matrix-matrix multiplier that can be combined to form systolic arrays. It could process 4 patterns of 16 elements each (16-bit), with 16 neuron values (16-bit) at a rate of 800 MMAC or 400 MCPS at 50 MHz.

The Times (London, England), 30 June 1951 Sentenced to 15 years imprisonment, he was released in March 1956 during the period of de-Stalinization.  Biography  Gr≈ësz was born on December 9, 1887, in the Austro-Hungarian village of Halbturn. After studying in the local Catholic high school, which was run by a group of Benedictine monks, he studied theology at the P√°zm√°neum seminary. Gr≈ësz was ordained as a priest in the Diocese of Gy≈ër in 1911. From 1928 to 1936, he served as the coadjutor of the diocese. In 1936 he was appointed the apostolic administrator of the Diocese of Szombathely, of which he became bishop three years later.  Political activity  During much of his career, Gr≈ësz sought to protect the Church by refusing to criticise the government of the time. Towards the end of World War II, under the national socialist government of the Arrow Cross Party, he gave a speech in which he announced that he in no way opposed the actions of the fascist r√©gime. He later met with Istv√°n Antal, the Minister of Propaganda, and discussed how the two could cooperate in order to combat the Communist threat. In August 1950, in his position as archbishop, he signed an agreement with the Hungarian state in order to settle the fate of 2,000 imprisoned nuns and monks. In this agreement, he committed the Church to supporting the construction of a socialist state and accepted the right of the government to interfere in Church affairs, in return for a promise to allow unrestricted worship and a commitment to reopen eight Catholic schools. As much of the Church continued to protest the violent oppression of religious activities, Gr≈ësz was arrested in May 1951 and sentenced to 15 years imprisonment on charges of conspiring with the United States and the Vatican to overthrow the government. He was pardoned in 1956 alongside opposition politicians such as Zolt√°n Tildy, after supposedly promising to act as a \\"faithful son of the republic\\". Once released from prison, Gr≈ësz assumed the leadership of the Hungarian Bishops' Conference and, while serving in this position, was elected to the national council of the governing Popular People's Front.

Orchardson depicts the morning of 23 July 1815, as Napoleon watches Napoleon abdicated' on 22 June 1815 in favour of his son Napoleon II. On 24 June the Provisional Government proclaimed the fact to the French nation and the world. After his defeat at the Battle of Waterloo, instead of remaining in the field with his shattered army Napoleon returned to Paris in the hope of retaining political support for his position as Emperor of the French. With his political base secured he hoped to then be able to continue the war. It was not to be; instead the members of the two chambers created a Provisional Government and demanded that Napoleon abdicate. Napoleon toyed with the idea of a coup d'√©tat similar to Eighteenth of Brumaire but decided against it. On 25 June Napoleon left Paris for the final time and after staying at the Palace of Malmaison, left for the coast hoping to reach the United States of America. In the meantime, the Provisional Government deposed his son and tried to negotiate a conditional surrender with the Coalition powers. They failed to obtain any significant concessions from the Coalition who insisted on a military surrender and the restoration of Louis XVIII. Napoleon, realising he could not hope to evade the Royal Navy, surrendered to Captain Maitland upon placing himself under his protection on board HMS Bellerophon. The British Government refused to allow Napoleon to set foot in England and arranged for his exile to the remote South Atlantic island of Saint Helena where he died in 1821. Return to Paris With the defeat at Waterloo, the enthrallment of the French people that had gripped them since Napoleon's return from exile rapidly dissipated, and they were forced to face the reality of several Coalition armies advancing into France up to the gates of Paris. His commanders in the field pressed him to remain and continue to command in the field, but Napoleon calculated that if he did so then the home front might capitulate to the Coalition and undermine any successes he had in the field. Napoleon had said after his defeat in Russia that his presence in Paris confounded the sceptics. For the sword by which the Empire had been raised and held in subjection, by which Europe itself had been mesmerised and all but conquered, had fallen powerless from his grasp. In him were no longer centred the might and the will of imperial France. These had been delegated through the constitution, to the organs of the nation, the elected representatives of the people. He no longer possessed, in his own person, the administrative and the executive; but was under the control of that power which, as before observed, when he left Paris to join the army, he dreaded more than the enemy he was going to confront ‚Äî the power of French public opinion legitimately expressed. If he had so keenly felt its force before his downfall on the battlefield; how great, nay, how hopeless, must have appeared to him the task of endeavouring to soothe its excitement, and to obtain its sanction to renewed sacrifices, when suddenly appearing in Paris on the afternoon of 21 June ‚Äî but one short week from the time of his assuming the command of his Army ‚Äî himself to announce the disastrous result of his enterprise. The imperialists in the capital, who had indulged in the most extravagant hopes engendered by the news of the victory at Ligny, had scarcely manifested their exultation when sinister rumours began to spread of some sudden reverses which had befallen the cause of Napoleon; and presently all doubts and suspense were removed by the unexpected appearance of the Emperor Napoleon himself, which gave rise to the most gloomy anticipations. Napoleon arrived in Paris only two hours after the news of the defeat at Waterloo had arrived. His arrival temporarily caused those who were conspiring against him to cease their machinations. Napoleon's calculated return to Paris may have been a political mistake, because it was seen by some as a desertion of his men and even an act of cowardice. If he had remained in the field the nation might have rallied and perhaps fortune might have favoured him. Had the Chambers received the news of his defeat at Waterloo and moved to depose him, then their decrees might not have been followed by a nation still in arms. Mary, an English woman living in France who arrived in Paris shortly after the defeat, made the point that the French were now becoming used to regime changes (they had had two instances in 15 months) and that these seemed to affect most of the populace no more than a change of government in contemporary early 19th century Britain ‚Äî not only had most of the civil servants kept their jobs, even some ministers had survived the regime changes ‚Äî so many were disinclined to risk their lives or property for any regime. This was very different from the perceptions of the general populace that had accompanied the first revolution and, after the terror, Napoleon's subsequent usurpation. Cabinet deliberations Napoleon immediately summoned a Cabinet Council. He frankly explained to his ministers the critical state of affairs; but, at the same time, with his usual confidence in his own resources, declared his conviction, that if the nation were called upon to rise en masse, the annihilation of the enemy would follow; but that if, instead of ordering new levies and adopting extraordinary measures, the Chambers were to allow themselves to be drawn into debates, and to waste their time in disputation, all would be lost. \\"Now that the enemy is in France\\", he added, \\"it is necessary that I should be invested with extraordinary power, that of a temporary dictatorship. As a measure of safety for the country, I might assume this power; but it would be better and more national that it should be conferred upon me by the Chambers\\". The ministers were too well acquainted with the general views and disposition of the Chamber of Representatives to pronounce a direct approval of this step; but Napoleon, perceiving their hesitation, called upon them to express their opinion upon the measures of public safety required by existing circumstances. Lazare, Count of Carnot, the Minister of the Interior, conceived it to lie essential that the country should be declared in danger; that the F√©d√©r√©s and National Guards should be called to arms; that Paris should be placed in a stage of siege, and measures adopted for its defence; that at the lost extremity the armed force should retire behind the Loire, and take up an entrenched position; that the Army of La Vendee, where the Civil War had nearly terminated, as also the Corps of Observation in the south, should be recalled: and the enemy checked until sufficient force could be united and organised for the assumption of a vigorous offensive, by which he should be driven out of France. Decr√®s, the Minister of the Navy, and Regnaud de Saint Jean d'Angely, the Secretary of State, supported this opinion; but Fouch√©, the Minister of Police, and the remaining ministers, remarked that the safety of the state did not depend upon any particular measure which might thus be proposed, but upon the Chambers of the Estates (Parliament); and upon their uniting with the head of the government: and that by manifesting towards them confidence and good faith, they would be induced to declare it to be their duty to unite with Napoleon in the adoption of energetic measures for securing the honour and independence of the nation. =Fouch√©'s policy= This advice on the part of Fouch√© was an artful piece of dissimulation. No man in France possessed so intimate a knowledge of the secret workings of the public mind; he knew precisely the dispositions and views of the different factions, as also the character and temperament of their leaders. He knew also that the great parties in the Chambers, with the exception of the imperialists, who were in the minority but whom he secretly flattered with the prospect of a Napoleon II, were fully prepared to depose the Emperor, in favour of full constitutional freedom and liberal institutions. This knowledge, obtained with an adroitness and a precision quite peculiar to this celebrated Minister of Police, he made completely subservient to his own personal views. These had been, from the commencement of Napoleon's second reign, to coquet with the factions in such a manner as to induce each to consider him an indispensable instrument in the realisation of its hopes, and to exert this extraordinary influence either to support or to undermine the power of Napoleon, according as the fortunes of the latter might be in the ascendant or on the decline. The resolute attitude assumed by the allies soon satisfied him that, although the Emperor might once more dazzle the world with some brilliant feat of arms, he must eventually succumb to the fixed determination of the other sovereign powers to crush his usurped authority; and to the overwhelming masses with which Europe was preparing to subjugate the country. He had been, and was still, in secret communication with the ministers and advisers of Louis XVIII; and was consequently in full possession of the general plans and intentions of the coalition powers. When, therefore, Napoleon's enterprise had so signally failed, and the re-occupation of Paris appeared to be its necessary consequence: Fouch√© foresaw clearly, that were the proposed dictatorship to be assumed by means of a sudden and forced dissolution of the Chambers, implying that the recent reverses had been produced by treachery on the part of the Representatives; and were new levies to be raised en masse, in support of the force that yet remained available; the result would inevitably be anarchy and confusion in the capital, disorder and excesses throughout the whole country, renewed disasters to the nation, together with an awful and useless sacrifice of life. To prevent such a catastrophe (as Fouch√© thought it would be), it was necessary to lull Napoleon's suspicions of the intentions of the Chambers; with which, at the same time, Fouch√© was fully acquainted. Hence it was, that to gain sufficient time for the development of these intentions, Fouch√© gave to the Council the advice before mentioned. Fouch√© strongly expressed his disapproval of the projected Dissolution of the Chambers, and assumption of the Dictatorship; declaring that any measures of that kind would only turn to distrust, and, not improbably, a general revolt. But, at the same time, his agents were making known throughout Paris the fullest extent of the disasters that had befallen Napoleon, and which had caused his sudden and unexpected return; and the Representatives were assembling in all haste, and in great numbers, to take a bold and decided step in the great national crisis. In thus dissembling from his Master the real disposition of the great political Parties, and the true state of the public mind, Fouch√©, no doubt, betrayed the trust reposed in him; but, setting aside the question whether he was really influenced by patriotic motives, or merely acting upon a system of deep duplicity and time serving expediency, there can also be no doubt that, by pursuing the line of conduct which he did on this important occasion, he became the means of preserving his country from the infliction of a still further accumulation of evils. The Cabinet Council continued in discussion; some supporting, and others disapproving, the propositions of Napoleon: who, at length, yielding to the arguments of Fouch√© and Carnot, declared he would submit himself to the loyalty of the Chambers, and confer with them as to the measures which the critical position of the country might render necessary. Resolutions of the Chamber of Representatives In the meantime, the Representatives had met, early on 21 June 1815, and commenced their deliberations on the existing state of affairs. Marquis de Lafayette, the acknowledged Leader of the Liberal Party, having received intelligence of the subject of discussion in the Council, and aware that not a moment was to be lost in averting the blow with which their liberties were menaced, ascended the tribune, and addressed the Chamber, amidst the most profound silence, and breathless suspense: No one ventured to oppose these bold resolutions‚ÄîThe Imperialist Party was taken by surprise. The leading members were now elsewhere with Napoleon Bonaparte, and the others had not the courage to face the impending storm‚Äîand, after a brief discussion, in which their instant adoption was urged in the strongest manner, they were carried by acclamation, with the exception of the Fourth, which was suspended on account of the invidious distinction which it appeared to convey between the troops of the Line and the National Guards. They were then transmitted to the Chamber of Peers; where, after a short discussion, they were adopted without amendment. Further Cabinet discussions The Message from the Chambers, conveying these resolutions, reached the Council in the midst of its deliberations. Naopleon was staggered by an act which he looked upon as an usurpation of the Sovereign Authority. To him, who had so long exercised an almost unlimited control in the State, who had led mighty Armies to victory, and who had subjected powerful nations to his despotic sway, this sudden and energetic voice of the people, conveyed through the medium of their Representatives, aroused him to a full sense of the wonderful change which had been effected in the public mind, and in his own individual position, through the intervention of a Constitution. He was alike indignant at what he conceived to be a daring presumption, and mortified at his own miscalculation in having convoked the Chambers. J'avais bien, pens√©, he remarked, que jaurais du cong√©dier ces gens- I√† avant mon d√©part. Napoleon's message to the Representatives After some reflection, Napoleon determined, if possible, to temporize with the Chambers. He sent Regnaud de Saint Jean d'Angely to the Chamber of Representatives, in his capacity of Member, to soothe the irritation that prevailed, to relate that the army had been upon the point of gaining a great victory, when disaffected individuals created a panic; that the troops had since rallied; and that the Emperor had hastened to Paris to concert, with the Ministers and the Chambers, such measures for the public safety as circumstances seemed to require. Carnot was directed to make a similar communication to the Chamber of Peers. Regnaud vainly endeavoured to fulfill his mission. However, the Representatives had lost all patience, and insisted upon the Ministers presenting themselves at the bar of the House. The latter at length obeyed the summons; Napoleon having consented, though with great reluctance, to their compliance with the mandate. He required them, however, to be accompanied by his brother Lucien Bonaparte, as an Extraordinary Commissioner, appointed to reply to the Interrogatories of the Chamber. At 18:00 in the evening of 21 June, Lucien Bonaparte and the Ministers made their appearance in the Chamber of Representatives. Lucien announced that he had been sent there by Napoleon as a Commissioner Extraordinary, to concert with the Assembly measures of safety. He then placed in the hands of the President the Message of which he was the bearer from his brother. It contained a succinct recital of the disasters experienced at Mont St Jean: and recommended the Representatives to unite with the Head of the State in preserving the country from the fate of Poland, and from the re-imposition of the yoke which it had thrown off. It stated, also, that it was desirable that the two Chambers should appoint a Commission of five Members, to concert with the Ministers the measures to be adopted for the public safety, and the means of treating for peace with the Coalition Powers. This Message was far from being favourably received. A stormy discussion ensued, in the course of which it was soon made manifest that the Representatives required a more explicit declaration of Napoleon's opinions and designs: one, in fact, more in accordance with the views which the majority of them evidently entertained, and was apparently determined to enforce. One of their number significantly remarked, as he addressed himself to the Ministers, Several of the members spoke in a similar strain, and the debate was kept up with great animation, until at length it was agreed, that in conformity with the terms of the Imperial Message, a Commission of five Members should be appointed. =Commission of ten members= On 21 June the Commission of five Members consisting of the President and Vice Presidents of the Chamber of Representatives, to collect, in concert with the Cabinet and with a Committee from the Chamber of Peers, the fullest information upon the state of France, and to propose suitable measures of safety, was created. The Committee consisted of Messrs Lanjuinais (President of the Chamber of Peers), La Fayette, Dupont de l'Eure, Flaugergues, and Grenier. At 20:30 Lucien Bonaparte, now presented himself, in the same capacity of Commissioner Extraordinary, to the Chamber of Peers. After hearing the message, the latter also appointed a Committee, which consisted of Generals Drouot, Dejean, Andreossy and Messrs Boissy d'Anglas and Thibaudeau. At 23:00 that evening La Fayette addressed the 10 members of the joint commission and put forward two motions, the first calling for the abdication of Napoleon and the second for a special commission to negotiate terms with the allied coalition. Both motions were carried and they agreed to allow Napoleon one hour in which to respond to their ultimatum. Napoleon, being fully informed of the proceedings of the Chamber of Representatives, and of the general tenor of the debates, hesitated a long time whether to dissolve the Assembly or to abdicate the Imperial Crown. Some of his Ministers, on perceiving the direction of his views, assured him that the Chamber had acquired too firm a hold of the public opinion to submit to any violent coup d'√©tat and expressed their opinion, that by withholding the act of abdication, he might eventually deprive himself of the power of vacating the throne in favour of his son. Nevertheless, he appeared determined to defer this step to the very last moment; trusting in the meantime some favourable event might occur, tending to modify the present disposition of the Chamber. Morning of 22 of June The Representatives met again at 09:30 the following morning (22 June). The utmost impatience was manifested for the report of the Committee. Two hours having elapsed, the Members became greatly excited. Some of them proposed that the exigencies of the state were such, that it was their duty to adopt immediate and decisive measures, without waiting for the report. At length, in the midst of the agitation and tumult which prevailed, General Grenier, the reporter of the Committee, suddenly made his appearance. He stated that, after a deliberation of five hours, the Committee had resolved: This statement excited general murmurs of disapprobation. But General Grenier, aware of the expectations of the Chamber, continued: This produced an extraordinary sensation in the Chamber. It was looked upon as an artful design upon the part of Napoleon to create delay by proposing to the Chambers a proceeding which he was well aware would prove unsuccessful; and to seize the first favourable opportunity of destroying their independence, and re-establishing his despotism ‚Äî to re- enact, in short, the Eighteenth of Brumaire. The tumult had reached a fearful height. Many members exclaimed vehemently against the report. At length, one of them, the Representative for Is√®re, , ascended the tribune, and spoke in the following energetic and decided manner: Duchesne was interrupted by the President, who announced that the message from the Emperor to which the reporter had referred would be received before 3:00 that afternoon. The interruption, however, at this most important point of the debate, renewed the tumult in the Chamber. Some exclaimed, \\"It is a concerted plan to make us lose time\\". Others cried out, \\"Some plot is concerting\\"; and the majority vociferated, \\"Proceed, proceed; there is no middle course\\". Duchesne continued: No sooner was this word pronounced than the entire Assembly rose; and amidst the clamour that ensued were heard a hundred voices exclaiming, \\"Seconded! seconded!\\". When, at length, the President succeeded in restoring some degree of order, he said: The proposition of Duchesne was instantly supported by General Solignac: an officer who, during the last five years, had been made to suffer the severest mortifications, arising from the hatred entertained towards him by Napoleon, in consequence of his refusal to be the servile instrument of his ambition; and, therefore, the curiosity of the Chamber was naturally excited to hear what course he was about to adopt. General Solignac said: This proposition was most favourably received, and the President was on the point of putting it to the vote, when Solagnac again appeared in the tribune: This speech was met with cries of \\"Yes! Yes! To the vote!\\" (the general exclamation). Marshal Davout, Prince of Eckm√ºhl then came to the Chamber and read an extract from a dispatch from Marshal Soult, Duke of Dalmatia, and concluded that the situation was grave but no hopeless adding A member asked if this was true in the light of reports that Coalition forces had penetrated as far as Laon? Davout denied the fact and repeated that in his expert view that the military situation not hopeless. Shortly after the conclusion of his address, at 11:00 the Chamber adjourned. =Abdication, afternoon 22 June= In the meantime, Napoleon had been made acquainted with the disposition of the Chamber of Representatives, by Regnaud de Saint Jean d'Angely, who hastened to warn him that if he did not immediately abdicate, his deposition would, in all probability, be declared. Napoleon was enraged at the idea of this contemplated violence, and stated Regnaud, however, urged him in the strongest manner to yield to imperious circumstances, and to renew the noble and generous sacrifice he made in 1814. He assured him that if he did not take this step, he would be accused by the Chamber, and even by the whole Nation, of having, out of personal considerations alone, prevented the possibility of obtaining peace. Solignac and other Representatives were then announced. They boldly declared to him that he had no other course open to him but that of submission to the desire entertained by the Representatives of the Nation. Solignac described to him the scene in the Chamber of Representatives, and the difficulty he had experienced in inducing the latter to suspend, even for one hour, their decision; which, if not anticipated by a voluntary Abdication, would entail upon him the disgrace of forfeiture. Even his brothers, Lucie and Joseph, now gave their opinion that the moment for resistance had passed. When the paroxysm of rage, to which these representations gave rise, had subsided, Napoleon announced his determination to abdicate in favour of his son; and, desiring his brother Lucien to take a pen, he dictated to him a declaration of abdication in favour of his son under the title Napoleon II, Emperor of the French. The sitting of the house of Chambers had resumed at midday and at 13:00 Joseph Fouch√©, Caulaincourt, Davout, and Carnot carried the deceleration to the house and the President read it out. It was heard in respectful silence by all, and with considerable relief by those opposition members who had feared a last minute coup d'√©tat. The resignation was the last great act of Napoleon's political life. Defeated and humbled by foreign enemies in the field, subdued and controlled by the Representatives of the Nation; he was forced to descend from a throne whence he had at one time swayed the destinies of sovereigns rendered dependent on his mighty will. Almost all the previous changes and gradations in his extraordinary career had been preluded or accompanied by some magnificent scene of dramatic effect, or a violent Coup d'√©tat but, in this instance, the transition was attended by no circumstance more remarkable than the quietude with which it was effect. The cessation of the political existence of such a man would have been most naturally looked for as an event coincident only with the termination of a life which, if not closed upon the pinnacle of glory, would be sought for amidst the shock of battle, or in the vortex of a state convulsion. That he meditated a second Eighteenth of Brumaire, there can be no doubt; but the decided tone of the debates in the National Assembly, the solicitations of his friends, and the hope of securing the throne to his family, induced him to abandon all idea of such a project. It is, besides, more than probable that, aware as he was of the bad feeling that existed, to a great extent, both in the Chambers and in the country, towards King Louis XVIII; as also of the conflicting principles of the different factions, he calculated upon the chances of an Involution productive of anarchy and confusion, which he yet might be called upon to reduce to order and submission. When it is considered that the great mass of the Army of the Line was devoted to Napoleon; that the rallied Army of the North was falling back upon Paris, where it would concentrate its strength and be reinforced from Regimental Depots; and, further, that the armies on the Eastern Frontier were still holding their respective positions, and that even in La Vend√©e the Imperial troops had succeeded in quelling the insurrection, ‚Äî when, in addition to all this, it is considered how great, how extraordinary, was the influence induced by the prestige of Napoleon with the majority of the nation, dazzled as the latter had been by countless victories that outweighed, in its estimation, those fatal disasters which it ascribed solely to the united power of the great European Coalition established against France, ‚Äî the contemporary British historian William Siborne considered it is impossible not to be struck by the firm, bold, and determined attitude assumed by the French Parliament, on this critical occasion, that it displayed one of the brightest examples the world had yet beheld of the force of constitutional legislation; and under all the attendant circumstances, it was a remarkable triumph of free institutions over monarchical despotism. Selection of the commissioners of government Once the formalities of the Napoleon's abdication had been observed, the house debated what should be done next. Some supported a regency government under Napoleon II, others a republic, and while most were against the restoration of Louis XVIII they realised that they were going to have to reach an accommodation with the Coalition powers, but did to want to spark a Coup d'√©tat from the Army which still sympathetic to Napoleon. The Chamber rejected a proposition to declare themselves a national or constituent assembly on the grounds that such a measure would be an usurpation of authority and destroy the constitution under which they were acting. So the Chamber decided to elect a commission of government to authorise a new government under the constitution and decided not to communicate with the Coalition armies but to allow the new executive arm of the government to do so. There were five hundred and eleven members present at the first round of voting for the commissioners of government: cites . *Lazare, Count Carnot received 304 votes *Joseph Fouch√©, Duke of Otranto received 293 votes *General Paul Grenier received 204 votes *General Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette received 142 votes *Marshal Jacques MacDonald received 137 votes *Pierre Flaugergues received 46 votes *Charles Lambrechts received 42 votes Consequently, Carnot and Fouch√© were proclaimed two of the three members of the commission. During the second round of voting, a motion was made to make the sitting permanent. Grenier was chosen third member of the commission with 350 votes; and then the sitting was adjourned until 11:00 the next morning. The house of peers met about 13:30 and Carnot read out the abdication proclamation. This was listen to quietly, but when the count then reported on the state of the army a heated debate took place with Marshal Nay stating that: The peers were informed what the Chamber of Representatives had decided. Prince Lucien and other Bonepartists who pointed out that Napoleon had abdicated in favour of his son and if his son was not recognised then the abdication could be considered void. The chamber decided not to support the Bonepartists and agreed to send two of their members to sit as commissioners of government. In the first round of voting Armand Caulaincourt, Duke of Vicenza was elected with 51 votes, and in the second round Nicolas Quinette, Baron Quinnette gained 48 votes and was named the fifth member of the commission. The peers finally adjourned at 2:30am on 23 June. Formation of a Provisional Government, 23 June On the morning of 23 June the commissioners appointed Joseph Fouch√©, Duke of Otranto as its president. Marshal Andr√© Mass√©na, Prince of Essling was named commander in chief of the Parisian National Guard, Count Andreossy commander of the first military division, and Count Drouot of the Imperial Guard. Baron Bignon was chosen minister, provisionally, for foreign affairs, General Carnot of the interior, and Count Pelet de la Loz√®re of the police. That evening plenipotentiaries were set out to treat in the name of the nation, and to negotiate with the European powers for that peace which they have promised them, on a condition which has now been fulfilled (that Napoleon Bonaparte was no longer recognised by the French Government to be Emperor of the French ‚Äî however as Representative Bigonnet had pointed out in a heated debate in the Chamber, the coalition were in arms to secure the Treaty of Paris of 1814 under which Napoleon and his family were excluded from the throne.) The commissioners sent to treat with the allies were Messrs. Lafayette, Sebastiani, D‚ÄôArgenson, Count Lafor√™t, and Count Pontecoulant, attended by Benjamin Constant as secretary; they left Paris in the evening of 24 June. Paris Proclamation of the Provisional Government, 24 June On 24 June, the Provisional Government in Paris, which had been appointed on the previous day after a stormy discussion in both Chambers on the subject of the recognition of Napoleon II, and which consisted five men, two of whom were appointed by the Chamber of Peers and three by the Chamber of Representatives: Joseph Fouch√©, Duke of Otranto, the Minister of the Police; Armand Caulaincourt, Duke of Vicenza, the Minister of Foreign Affairs; Lazare Carnot, Minister of the Interior; General Paul Grenier; and Nicolas Quinette; issued the a proclamation that Napoleon was abdicating for the \\"peace [of France] and that of the World\\" in favour of his son Napoleon II. Napoleon leaves Paris for the Palace of Malmaison, 25 June The Ch√¢teau de Malmaison. On 25 June, Napoleon withdrew from the capital to the country Palace of Malmaison ( east of the centre of Paris). From there he issued an address to the army in which he encouraged the soldiers to fight on. Napoleon II deposed, 26 June On 26 June the government transmitted to the chambers a bulletin tending to confirm the favourable accounts from the army, and to assure them, that their affairs were a more favourable aspect than at first could have been hoped; that they would neither exaggerate nor dissimulate the dangers, and in all emergencies would stand true to their country. On the same day the government issued a public proclamation that explained how the law was to operate \\"In the name of the French people\\" instead of in the name of Napoleon II, and thus, after a reign of three days, Napoleon II has been replaced by the French people. Napoleon leaves Malmaison for America, 29 June To facilitate his departure from the country the Provisional Government request that a passport and assurances of safety might be accorded to Napoleon and his family, to enable them to pass to the United States of America, Bl√ºcher ignored the request and Wellington referred the Commissioners to his note of 26 June on the proposed Suspension of Hostilities; and stated that, with regard to the passport for Napoleon, he had no authority from his Government, or from the Allies, to give any answer to such demand. The commissioners appointed by the government to communicate its wishes to Napoleon, no longer hesitated in arranging his departure. The minister of the marine, and Count Boulay, repaired to his residence, and explained to him that the Wellington and Bl√ºcher had refused to give him any safeguard or passport, and that he had now only to take his immediate departure. Napoleon narrowly escaped falling into the hands of the Prussians, whilst at Malmaison. Bl√ºcher, hearing that he was living there in retirement, had despatched Major von Colomb, on 28 June, with the 8th Hussars and two battalions of infantry to secure the bridge at Chatou, lower down the Seine, leading directly to the house. Fortunately, for Napoleon, Marshal Davout, when he ascertained that the Prussians were nearing the capital, had ordered General Becker to destroy the bridge. Hence Major von Colomb was very disappointed to find there was no passage at this point, which in fact was not more than distant from the palace, in which Napoleon was yet remaining at the time of the arrival of the Prussians. Napoleon at length yielded to what he considered to be his destiny, and the preparations for travelling having been completed, he entered his carriage about 17:00 of 29 June, accompanied by Generals Bertrand, Gourgaud, and other devoted friends, and took the road to Rochefort, whither two French frigates had been ordered for the embarkation of himself and his entourage for America. Capture by the British, 10 July Sir Charles Lock Eastlake, 1815. Eastlake was rowed out to the Bellerophon to make sketches, from which he later painted this portrait. As agreed in the Convention of St. Cloud, on 3 July, the French Army, commanded by Marshal Davoust, quit Paris and proceeded on its march to the Loire. On 7 July, the two Coalition armies entered Paris. The Chamber of Peers, having received from the Provisional Government a notification of the course of events, terminated its sittings; the Chamber of Representatives protested, but in vain. Their President (Lanjuinais) resigned his Chair; and on the following day, the doors were closed, and the approaches guarded by foreign troops. On 8 July, the French King, Louis XVIII, made his public entry into his capital, amidst the acclamations of the people, and again occupied the throne. It was also on 8 July that Napoleon Bonaparte embarked, at Rochefort, on board the French frigate Saale, and proceeded, accompanied by M√©duse, in which was his small entourage, to an anchorage in the Basque Roads off the Isle of Aix, with the intention of setting sail to America. On 10 July, the wind became favourable, but a British fleet made its appearance; and Napoleon, seeing the difficulty of eluding the vigilance of its cruisers, resolved, after having previously communicated with Captain Maitland, upon placing himself under his protection on board HMS Bellerophon, which vessel he accordingly reached on 15 July. On the following day, Captain Maitland sailed for England; and arrived at Torbay, with his illustrious charge, on 24 July. Despite his protestations Napoleon was not permitted to land in England (the British Government having decided upon sending him to the island of Saint Helena), and he was moved to HMS Northumberland a third-rate ship of the line, under Rear Admiral Sir George Cockburn, in which ship he sailed to his incarceration on the remote South Atlantic island. Napoleon remained a captive on Saint Helena until his death in 1821.

Exhibition  The Exhibition of eleven Leningrad artists (called later as the exhibition of \\"Eleven\\") was opened October 24, 1972. It showed the creation of the \\"left wing\\" of the Leningrad Union of Soviet Artists in concentration. That is why it was of such interest of spectators, critics and artists of Leningrad. Opinions and reviews were very polarized, from the admiration of the critic to a full rejection. Apologetes of the exhibition and creation of these artists contrasted with painting of socialistic realism and academy tradition. On the contrary critics were pointed to the entrainment of the studies and the formal tasks in the process of creation. They declared that couldn\`t find the picture of traditional Russian art.–í–∞—Ç–µ–Ω–∏–Ω–∞ –ù.–ê. –í–∞–ª–µ—Ä–∏–π –í–∞—Ç–µ–Ω–∏–Ω. –°–ø–±., 2006. –°.153–ö–æ–ª–µ—Å–æ–≤–∞ –û. –í–æ–∫—Ä—É–≥ –≤—ã—Å—Ç–∞–≤–∫–∏ // –õ–µ–Ω–∏–Ω–≥—Ä–∞–¥—Å–∫–∞—è –ø—Ä–∞–≤–¥–∞, 7 –¥–µ–∫–∞–±—Ä—è 1972.  Group of \\"Eleven\\"  The name \\"Eleven\\" was fixed after this exhibition. Even though this group existed only for two exhibitions, it went down in history. The second exhibition was in 1976 at the same place and just 9 artists of the original 11 took part in it. In the future they demonstrated their art works in solo or in the big common exhibitions with two or three participants in Moscow and Leningrad. In 1990 the members of \\"Eleven\\" engaged in the common exhibition of 26 Leningrad and Moscow artists in Central Exhibition Hall \\"Manezh\\" in Saint-Petersburg. In 1998 the exhibition of art works of group \\"Eleven\\" was in the Nekrasov's Memorial Museum in Saint- Petersburg. There were represented art-pieces from the private collections. In 2012 the exhibition of 200 art works of the group \\"Eleven\\" and their surroundings from the private collections was opened in K-Gallery (Saint- Petersburg). It was devoted to the 40th anniversary of the Exhibition of \\"Eleven\\" in Okhta in 1972.

Broadcast were formed in Birmingham in 1995 by vocalist Trish Keenan, bassist James Cargill, keyboardist Roj Stevens and guitarist Tim Felton. The band released their debut single, \\"Accidentals\\", on the independent record label Wurlitzer Jukebox in 1996; their two subsequent releases, The Book Lovers EP (1996) and \\"Living Room\\" (1997), were released on Duophonic Records. Soon after, the band signed to the Warp label and released Work and Non Work, a compilation of the band's previously released material. In 2000, Broadcast released their debut studio album, The Noise Made by People, and two EPs titled Extended Play and Extended Play Two. The Noise Made by People did not have a commercial impact, peaking only at No. 79 on the UK Albums Chart, but its accompanying EPs were a minor success, placing at No. 1 and No. 2, respectively, on the UK Budget Albums Chart. Haha Sound, the band's second album, was released in 2003 to \\"universal acclaim\\", according to Metacritic. The album experienced moderate commercial success in the United States, where it peaked at No. 8 on Billboards Electronic Albums chart and No. 50 on the Independent Albums chart. Haha Sound was preceded by two EPs, Microtronics Volume 01: Stereo Recorded Music for Links and Bridges and Pendulum (2003). Tender Buttons, the final studio album to feature Keenan, was released in 2005, alongside Microtronics Volume 02. Following the release of the B-side and rarities compilation The Future Crayon (2006), Broadcast began collaborating with Julian House and his project the Focus Group. In 2009, Broadcast and House released a collaborative mini album, Broadcast and the Focus Group Investigate Witch Cults of the Radio Age, which was listed as No. 1 on The Wires Top 50 Releases of 2009 and referred to by Vices Noisey as \\"perhaps Broadcast's finest achievement\\". A split 7-inch single with the Focus Group, featuring Broadcast's song \\"Inside Out\\", followed the album's release. Keenan died in January 2011, following complications with pneumonia, which she suffered from after earlier contracting H1N1. Berberian Sound Studio, a soundtrack album to Peter Strickland's 2012 film of the same name, was released in January 2013 to moderate success in the UK and US, peaking at No. 24 on the UK Independent Albums Chart. Partially recorded prior to Keenan's death, it was the final Broadcast release to feature her vocals.

For two years he was instructor in mathematics at Friends High School in Baltimore. Hathaway studied with James Joseph Sylvester at Johns Hopkins University. From Sylvester's lectures he learned some number theory and published notes on congruences. He was an instructor at Cornell University from 1885 to 1890 and an assistant professor in 1891. In October 1884 William Thomson, Baron Kelvin led a master class on \\"Molecular Dynamics and the Wave Theory of Light\\" at Johns Hopkins. Kelvin did not provide a text for his course and Hathaway made notes in short-hand. He wrote up the notes and duplicated them with a Papyrograph, a recent stencil-based device. As the demand outstripped the supply, Hathaway corresponded with Kelvin back in Glasgow to prepare for proper publication.

He fought against the partisans of the Northern pretender led by Ashikaga Takauji brothers in a see-saw campaign which saw the capital change hands several times. However, during the Battle of Kuromaru in 1338 he was killed in combat. In 1660, a farmer tilling the land near the site of the battle uncovered a kabuto helmet and presented it to Matsudaira Mitsumichi, daimy≈ç of Fukui Domain. The construction of the helmet indicated that it had belonged to a high-ranking warrior, and the domain's chief military strategist, Inoue Banzaemon declared that it must have belonged to Nitta Yoshisada. . A mound, the \\"Nitta-zuka\\", was built on the site where the farmer found the helmet as a memorial. In 1870, the imperial governor of Fukui, Matsudaira Mochiaki, built a Shinto shrine on top of the Nitta-zuka.

It is now held by the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston, Massachusetts, acquired from Prince Chigi in 1899. The painting measures and one of a series of Madonna paintings by Botticelli from 1465 and 1470. It shows influences from Filippo Lippi's Virgin and Child and Angels of c.1465 held by the Uffizi. The Virgin Mary is shown in a three quarter view, with the Baby Jesus held on her lap. A smiling angel, wearing a crown of myrtle, offers them a bowl containing twelve ears of wheat and grapes. The child raises a hand in benediction, and Mary holds one of the ears of corn. The scene may be set in a walled garden or hortus conclusus, symbolic of Mary's virginity, with a landscape of hills and a river visible through an opening in the arcade around the wall. The wheat and grapes are symbolic of the bread and wine of the Eucharist, which themselves symbolise the body and blood of the incarnate Jesus, and the number of ears possibly refer to the number of the apostles at the Last Supper. Prince Chigi first offered the painting to Isabella Stewart Gardner in 1899 for $30,000. She demurred initially, but by the time she decided to buy the price was $70,000. The sale was controversial in Italy, where there was press comment that the sale was illegal, and Prince Chigi was fined.

An ethnic Russian, Nicolau was born in Cacica, Suceava County. He also called himself at various times Serghei Nicanov, or Sergiu Nicolau, or Victor Nicolau-Cacica. Like his boss Emil BodnƒÉra»ô, he was recruited by the NKVD. This occurred in the late 1930s after he was expelled from the Chemistry faculty of Ia»ôi University, for attending meetings of the banned Romanian Communist Party (PCR). His studies abroad, in Brussels and Marseille, were paid for, and in the latter city, he was part of the local French Communist Party leadership. At some point, he deserted from the Romanian Army and left for the Soviet Union. At the beginning of World War II, Nicolau was assigned to return to Romania in order to set up a spy network, but he was captured at sent to prison, where he spent part of his sentence alongside another NKVD agent, Gheorghe Pintilie.

Nicolau protested this practice to Gheorghiu-Dej, who refused to intervene, since he was seeking at the time the support of the Soviets in his campaign against the Ana Pauker faction of the PCR. As a result, Nicolau was removed as head of the SSI on January 6, 1953 and replaced by . On April 1 of that year, Nicolau transferred to the information services of the Ministry of Defense.

Its use has been dated to the second half of the twentieth century and it may be found in coded and non-coded forms such as when the subject never married but was not homosexual. A similar phrase is \\"confirmed bachelor\\". Usage The phrase was a staple euphemism of obituary writers used to imply that the subject was homosexual.\\"Death is the new black\\" The Observer, 28 April 2002. Retrieved 3 May 2016. The ambiguity of the phrase has been commented on, however, by a number of sources. In 1999, James Fergusson, writing in Secrets of the Press about the coded language of obituaries that he compared with the clues in a cryptic crossword, commented \\" 'He never married' closed an obituary with numbing finality\\" and asked \\"Did it, or did it not, mean that he was a hyperactive homosexual?\\"\\"Death in the Press\\" by James Fergusson in Stephen Glover (Ed.) (1999) Secrets of the Press. London: Allen Lane. pp. 148‚Äì160 (p. 156) In 2006, Nigel Rees dated its use to the second half of the twentieth century and noted that it can also be used without any implication of homosexuality, and that it also served the purpose of avoiding the use of the word gay for subjects who were open about their homosexuality but disliked the word \\"gay\\".Rees, Nigel. (2006) A man about a dog: Euphemisms & other examples of verbal squeamishness. London: Collins. p. 274. In 2007, Bridget Fowler also noted that the phrase could be used without a double meaning in her book The Obituary as Collective Memory. Rose Wild of The Times has observed, however, that even where used in an apparently non-coded form in historic obituaries, the phrase could still be revealing of the subject, giving the example of a school master's obituary in 1923 that stated \\"he never married\\" but continued that he \\"usually spent his holidays in a little inn frequented by seafaring men at Falmouth\\". In 2016, Christian Barker of The Rake, observed \\"Until quite recently, obituary writers had a habit of concluding with the euphemism 'He never married' to subtly indicate that the subject was gay\\", but continued by connecting the phrase to misogamy rather than homosexuality and asserting that there were plenty of examples of \\" 'confirmed bachelors' simply shrugging off the shackles of matrimony and choosing to remain single throughout their lives‚Äîexperiencing no less success because of it\\".\\"He Never Married\\" The Case for Staying Single, Christian Barker, The Rake, July 2016. Retrieved 15 September 2018. In 2017, Rose Wild wrote in The Times that the use of \\"He never married\\" began to die out in the late 1980s, \\"but not before it had become absurd\\". She noted its \\"otiose\\" use in the paper's obituaries for Robert Mapplethorpe (died 1989) and Danny La Rue (died 2009).\\"Don't read too much into the lives of bachelors\\", Rose Wild, The Times, 16 September 2017, p. 34. \\"Confirmed bachelor\\" A similar euphemism was \\"confirmed bachelor\\", which was used in the second half of the twentieth century by the satirical magazine Private Eye. Rose Wild reported in The Times in May 2016, however, that she could only find around a dozen examples of the phrase in the paper's obituaries, some of which were of a non-coded form, causing her to wonder whether the phrase existed much outside the imagination of the writers of Private Eye.\\"Lives remembered with a loaded phrase or two\\", Rose Wild, The Times, 21 May 2016, p. 27.

The highway is intended to make use of the former right-of-way of Interstate 40 (I-40), which was relocated to the south along a former rail alignment due to increased traffic and visible wear on parts of the freeway. The $85 million project began construction in 2011 and is being built by the Oklahoma Department of Transportation (ODOT) with funds from the US Department of Transportation. History =Controversy= The Oklahoma City Boulevard plan became controversial when the full extent of ODOT's original intended design became public during an Oklahoma City Streetcar meeting. At that meeting, ODOT Division Director Paul Green explained ODOT's intent for a thoroughfare design rather than a traditional urban street type boulevard. No previsions were presented by Green or ODOT representatives to accommodate the planned streetcar system approved by voters. Oklahoma City Streetcar Subcommittee member Jeff Bezdek was incensed by the plans and the lack of awareness by ODOT as to streetcar project. Bezdek was approached by Bob Kemper, a local transportation advocate and former ODOT employee about forming a citizens group to force further public review of the project. Bezdek conceived the name Friends for a Better Boulevard and suggested that Kemper organize a group under that title on Facebook to harness online civic support to demand a proper environmental review. Friends for a Better Boulevard (FBB) launched its campaign as a Facebook Group and via the popular Oklahoma City blog, OKC TALK. The group grew quickly to over six hundred active members and demanded that local leaders apply further review to the boulevard project. After much debate, the Federal Highway Administration stepped into the process and required ODOT to put the project under an Environmental Assessment to determine if a full-fledged Environmental Impact Study should be required. The state transportation agency developed three initial alternatives for consideration and evaluation. The slate was further expanded to four. =Current status= The old I-40 now Oklahoma City Boulevard at the western section approaching Virginia Avenue traveling westbound in Oklahoma City The Federal Highway Administration is awaiting submissions from ODOT for further review.

She was used as a convoy escort in the Battle of the Atlantic and the Battle of the St. Lawrence. Following the war, the vessel was transferred to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and renamed Macleod. After five years service with them, the ship was reacquired the Royal Canadian Navy and recommissioned. She remained in service until 1958. Design and construction =Design= The Bangor class was initially to be a scaled down minesweeper design of the in Royal Navy service.Brown, p. 124Chesneau (1980), p. 61 However, due to the difficulty procuring diesel engines led to the small number of the diesel version being completed. The ships displaced standard and fully loaded. They were long with a beam of and a draught of .Macpherson and Barrie (2002), p. 185 However, the size of the ship led to criticisms of their being too cramped for magnetic or acoustic minesweeping gear. This may have been due to all the additions made during the war with the installation of ASDIC, radar and depth charges. The Bangor class came in two versions. Brockville was of the diesel-powered version, being equipped with a 9-cylinder diesel engine driving two shafts that produced . This gave the ship a maximum speed of . The vessels carried of oil. The vessels had a complement of 6 officers and 77 ratings. The Canadian diesel-powered Bangors were armed with a single quick-firing (QF) 12-pounder 12 cwt gun mounted forward. Initially the design called for a gun, however these were replaced with 12-pounder guns. The ships were also fitted with a QF 2-pounder Mark VIII gun aft and were eventually fitted with single-mounted QF 20 mm Oerlikon guns on the bridge wings.Macpherson (1997), p. 58 For those ships assigned to convoy duty, they were armed with two depth charge launchers and two chutes to launch the 40 depth charges they carried. =Order and construction= Initially, Canada intended to produce more s, however, upon learning of the Bangor design from the Royal Navy, chose to build them instead. This decision was based on the Bangors oil-burning engines and their larger size and speed.Macpherson and Barrie (2002), p. 167 However the lack of diesel manufacturing led to smaller numbers being built and delays in the acquisition of diesel engines led to delays between launching and completion. Brockville was ordered as part of the 1940‚Äì41 Bangor-class program. The ship was laid down on 9 December 1940 by Marine Industries Limited at Sorel and launched 20 June 1941. She was commissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy on 19 September 1942 at Sorel. She was named for the town of Brockville, Ontario. Service history =War service= On 20 October 1942, Brockville arrived at Halifax, Nova Scotia. While en route to Halifax, the ship grounded near Rimouski, Quebec and required two weeks repairs upon arrival. After working up, she was assigned to the Western Local Escort Force (WLEF), escorting convoys, before transferring to Halifax Force.Macpherson (1997), p. 60 In March 1943, Brockville returned to WLEF. In June 1943, the force was divided up into escort groups with Brockville joining group W-3. In August/September, the ship underwent a refit at Dalhousie, New Brunswick. She remained with the group until May 1944, when the minesweeper was transferred to Sydney Force. The vessel underwent a second refit at Lunenburg, Nova Scotia in 1944. She would remain a part of this group until June 1945 when the ship was assigned to various tasks based out of Halifax. =Postwar service= On 28 August 1945, Brockville was transferred to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) Marine Service. Upon transfer, the ship was renamed Macleod for former commissioner of the RCMP James Macleod. Macleod served on the east coast until 1 July 1950 when she was returned to the Royal Canadian Navy where she was returned to her old name.Haycock (2012), p. 178 Brockville was recommissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy on 5 April 1951. She underwent modernization at Lauzon, Quebec. During her modernization, the 12-pounder gun was removed and replaced with a Bofors 40 mm gun and a Hedgehog anti-submarine mortar was installed. In 1952, the ship was assigned to Sydney, Nova Scotia as tender to and was used for seasonal training exercises on the Great Lakes in 1954. In October 1954, Brockville transferred to Esquimalt, British Columbia with and . On 4 January 1955, Brockville, Digby and formed the Second Canadian Reserve Squadron for training purposes at Esquimalt. On 12 December 1956, she was paid off into the reserve at Esquimalt. On 29 August 1958, the ship was recommissioned for passage to Halifax where it was planned to convert her to a mobile deperming vessel. However this conversion was cancelled and she was paid off for the final time on 31 October 1958. She was sold for scrap and broken up in 1961.

It is located on the east side of Utterslev Mose and consists of three terraces, each with 7 houses, surrounding a small green space with a lake. History Atelierhusene were built in the early 1940s under influence of the housing shortage and scarcity of building materials that characterized Copenhagen during the German occupation of Denmark in World War II. The ide for the development was conceived by the sculptors Povl S√∏ndergaard and Johan Galster and the architect Viggo M√∏ller Jensen, who knew each other from the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts. A similar project had previously been completed successfully by others with the construction of Kunstnerhjemmet in Gothersgade. The project was developed in collaboration with Foreningen Socialt Boligbyggeri (The Association for Social Housing) and with support from the Ministry of Interior Affairs. The selected site had previously been used for market gardens. Several banks supported the project with loans on favourable conditions and artists donated works for a lottery as part of the financing. The houses were completed in 1943. The entire development was listed in 1990. Architecture The development is located on Gr√∏nnemose All√© and consists of 21 houses, each with a 35-m2 studio, distributed on three terraces with dwellings of different sizes. The development is located on three sides of a green space with a small lake known as Vigos S√∏ (Vigo's Lake) after the project's architect. The row with the smallest houses lines the street. The single-room houses with an area of just 71 m2 have a small yard on their front side and a balcony overlooking the lake at the back. The two other terraces, located on either side of the lake, perpendicular to the road, consist of houses with three and four rooms, respectively (105 and 116 m2). They have a Z-shaped layout with a front yard in association with the studio (originally for carving) on their east side and a terrace facing the garden on their west side. Residents The houses are available to members of Kunstnersamfundet. There is an open-house event each year in September where residents open up their homes and exhibit their works.

It depicts a character (based on the historical Timoleon) who is unappreciated and exiled until war brings him to fight for his people. After securing victory, he refuses to return home. Melville at the time similarly saw himself as an unappreciated would-be savior of literature.

Rock formations in the watershed include the Catskill Formation and the Huntley Mountain Formation. Soils in the watershed include the Deep-Wellsboro-Oquaga, Wellsboro, and Norwich soil associations. Course A waterfall on Blackberry Run Blackberry Run begins on a plateau in Davidson Township. It flows south for a short distance before turning southeast into a deep valley. After some distance, it turns south-southeast, following the valley. It eventually leaves the valley and reaches its confluence with East Branch Fishing Creek near the border between Sullivan County and Columbia County. Blackberry Run joins East Branch Fishing Creek upstream of its mouth. It is the last named tributary to join East Branch Fishing Creek before it reaches its mouth. =Tributaries= Blackberry Run has no named tributaries. However, it does have at least one small unnamed tributary. Hydrology The average discharge of Blackberry Run is 2113 gallons per minute. The pH of the stream averages 4.70. During high flow conditions, it has a pH of 4.72 or 4.74. Blackberry Run experiences chronic acidification. However, it does not degrade the water quality of East Branch Fishing Creek as significantly as the creek's tributaries further upstream do. The water quality of Blackberry Run is considered to be \\"severe\\" during high-flow conditions, a rating worse than \\"very poor\\", which the stream is rated as in normal flow conditions. Blackberry Run requires an additional of alkalinity per day to be restored to satisfaction of the East Branch Fishing Creek Restoration Plan. One proposed method of increasing the alkalinity of the stream is the construction of vertical flow wetlands at its headwaters. Other proposed methods include road liming and high flow buffer channels. Blackberry Run is designated by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection for use by aquatic life. However, the stream is considered to be impaired due to atmospheric deposition. Geography and geology The elevation near the mouth of Blackberry Run is above sea level. The source of the stream is approximately above sea level. The lower half of Blackberry Run flows over rock of the Catskill Formation. Further upstream, the stream flows over the Huntley Mountain Formation. The stream's upper reaches are on the Burgoon Sandstone. The lower portion of Blackberry Run flows through soil of the Deep-Wellsboro-Oquaga soil association and the upper reaches of the stream are on soil of the Wellsboro soil association. Soil associations such as the Norwich association occur near the stream as well. Its mouth is on a minor soil association. All of the soil near the stream is strongly acidic. Rock outcroppings are present in the vicinity of Blackberry Run. These outcroppings are made of shale and sandstone. Watershed The watershed of Blackberry Run has an area of . There are of streams in the watershed. Most of Blackberry Run is surrounded by Pennsylvania State Game Lands. There is a forested trail near the stream. History Blackberry Run was used as a water supply for industrial and domestic uses, in particular, for the residents of Jamison City, in the early 1900s. Part of the stream was closed to fishing in 1920. A large tannery operated on the stream in the past. The restoration of Blackberry Run is the third phase of the East Branch Fishing Creek Restoration Plan. This restoration plan could potentially restore up to of Blackberry Run. The cost of restoring the stream is estimated to be $200,000. Blackberry Run was listed as impaired by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection in 2002. As of December 2011, a total maximum daily load is scheduled for 2015. Biology Great-spurred violet plants have been observed near Blackberry Run.

The Robinson's Disengaging Gear has been standard equipment on British Royal Navy ships since 1880. The term seaboat is used here to describe a work boat that is used in everyday ship operations for transferring people, inspecting other vessels, etc. A seaboat is different from a lifeboat, which is only used in an emergency to save lives. Historically, a sea boat was also used as a lifeboat, but today (2014) lifeboats are usually specialized boats, not used for everyday work.  Need for an effective disengaging gear  Especially in navy ships, the seaboat is often launched while the ship is moving slowly. The ship may be moving for operational reasons, or because of the need to maintain steerage way (forward motion of water past the rudder to enable steering). Releasing the seaboat is a risky procedure, and in the 1880s, accidents raised the demand for a better system. Accidents are still happening in modern times from US Navy ships, for example.  Launch process  Traditionally, a seaboat is suspended from the ship by two falls (ropes), one at the bow (front) of the seaboat, and the other at the stern (back) of the seaboat. The two suspending falls may be multi-part pulley systems, or motor-driven wire ropes. The objective is that when the boat is lowered down and positioned close to the water, both ends of the boat be released simultaneously. Failure to release both ends simultaneously will likely result in the boat being tipped into the sea. Without a specialized mechanism, the release of each end of the boat was a manual action requiring the coordination of two groups of sailors. Even a momentary mistiming could be tragic, especially if the ship was under way (moving).  Problem solution  Several solutions that would mechanically simultaneously release both falls were proposed. The British Royal Navy adopted and standardized on the Robinson's Disengaging Gear in 1881, and this system was still in use in the late 20th century. The Robinson's Disengaging Gear consists of three mechanisms. There are two disengaging hooks, one at each end of the seaboat, holding the boat to the falls. The two disengaging hooks are connected by a relatively tight and thin wire rope to the disengaging release clip located approximately at the center of the seaboat. The thin connecting wire rope is called the \\"Fore and After\\". The disengaging hooks are normally held safe from unintentionally dropping the seaboat by a pin in each disengaging hook. In the Royal Navy, as ship's crew starts to lower the boat, the order \\"Out Pins\\" is given. The boat's crew pushes down on the fore and after wire, to relieve pressure on the pins, and the pins are removed. The boat's skipper is usually positioned in the stern of the seaboat as it is lowered, in order to be ready to steer the seaboat away from the ship's side. When the seaboat is close to the water as judged by the seaboat's skipper, the skipper gives the command to \\"Slip\\", and a crew member releases a lever on the disengaging clip, which slackens the fore and after. The slack in the fore and after allows the disengaging hooks to release the falls simultaneously, and the seaboat drops safely and level the final few inches into the water.  Description  A good description of the Robinsons Disengaging Gear, and the launch procedure is given in the British Manual of Seamanship.  Inventor  The Disengaging Gear was invented by Mark Heaton Robinson (1844-1923) who was a prolific inventor, and who is perhaps best known for his developments in the area of single-acting high-speed steam engines.  Obsolescence  Robinson's Disengaging Gear was used in the Royal Navy through the 1970s in the Type 12 frigates, the Leander class frigates, and the County class guided missile destroyers. The standard seaboat was a 26-foot \\"3 in 1\\" whaler with an inboard diesel engine, and a crew of 6. After that time the Royal Navy wanted to reduce the overall crew size on ships, and so switched to smaller seaboats, launched from a single wire crane. The new single wire system was released with the new Henriksen Hook. The Henriksen Hook releases the boat automatically when the boat touches the water, and the boat weight on the suspension line is relieved. The Hendrikson Hook is now standard on Royal Navy ships (2015).

The unit pursued a strategy of taking equity stakes in asset backed businesses, and built up a ¬£10 billion portfolio under her management, including joint ventures with Ann Gloag and Brian Souter of Stagecoach Group. Bradley left in 2005. Bank of Scotland received a government bail out to prevent collapse in 2008. Between 2005 and 2006 Bradley was Chief Executive at the Kenmore property group, one of Bank of Scotland's largest clients, which went into administration in 2009. Pauline Bradley subsequently joined Derek Quinlan's Quinlan Private as Head of Transactions, and oversaw the ¬£792 million acquisition of the Jury's Inn hotel chain, and the ¬£1.1 billion acquisition of the Marriott Hotels group in 2007. Derek Quinlan resigned from Quinlan Private in 2009 with personal debts estimated at 600 million euros. Marriott Hotels went into administration in 2011, Royal Bank of Scotland taking control of the chain when its holding company defaulted on a ¬£700 million bank loan. Involvement in closure and redevelopment of Manston Airport In November 2013 Bradley became co-director with Ann Gloag of Manston Skyport Ltd, which acquired Manston Airport in Kent, from New Zealand company Infratil for a token payment of ¬£1. Despite assurances of ongoing investment in aviation activity given to staff and local politicians, the airport was closed shortly after in May 2014, with 144 redundancies. The aviation related assets were auctioned off. In September 2014 Bradley became the sole founding director of Lothian Shelf 718 Ltd (later renamed Stone Hill Park Ltd) , a company set up to acquire and redevelop the 800 acre site for housing. UK Companies House records show Lothian Shelf 718/Stone Hill Park as being funded by a wholly owned subsidiary of Highland Global Transport (parent company of Stagecoach Group) ,Kent Facilities Ltd . Bradley's involvement in the Manston closure came under close scrutiny in February 2015 when she was called to give evidence before the Parliamentary Transport Select Committee. The chair of the committee, Louise Ellman MP, suggested to Bradley that, in light of her ongoing directorship of Lothian Shelf 718, and the company's funding by Ann Gloag, Manston Skyport's claim to have sold the Manston site on to \\"regeneration specialists' could be \\"deliberately misleading\\".

Background The Browns planned to build a new house on the family orchard, on the banks of the Heathcote River. This river had a history of flooding, and the local council sought advice from the Christchurch Drainage Board about the suitability of the proposed building site, and they advised that elevating the building site by 9 inches would be adequate flood protection, and the council duly issued a building consent, subject to this condition. The House was built and completed in 1974. However, the site was flooded in 1975, 1976 and 1977 and as a result of these repeated floodings, the Browns raised the elevation of the house by 6 feet, at the cost of $30,000. After the council and the drainage board refused to reimburse them the $30,000, the Browns sued them in tort, winning damages in the High Court of $32,900.

Background Craig owned a house in Murrays Bay. On the section in front of his house, his neighbour started building a new house, within 3.8 metres of his boundary. During construction, he realized that when completed, the house would obstruct his views, and he complained to the council without success. He later discovered, that according to the District Plan, any building constructed within 6 metres of a property boundary, must be publicly notified, which if this had happened Craig could have filed an objection. And the house was originally planned to be built 6 metres from Craigs property, however this would have involved building over a council sewer line. To avoid difficulties of building over a sewer line, the site plan was moved to within 3.8 metres. Whilst this was still outside the District Plan, the council had powers to give exemptions to complying with the District Plan, and gave an exemption in this case. However, it later transpired that due to a misinterpretation of the rules, the council did not have the legal authority to grant an exemption in this instance. Craig sued the council for $40,000 in damages for negligence. Held The Court of Appeal upheld the High Courts award of damages of $2,250.

He is known for his hawkish views on the defense and strategic posture he believes China should adopt.  Background and career  Liu was born in 1952 in Fenghua, Ningbo, Zhejiang Province. Liu Yazhou has been described as a \\"princeling\\": his father-in-law was a top military officer, and Li Xiannian, who once served as President of the People's Republic of China, was his father-in-law. This privileged political pedigree gives him a greater platform for his views and opinions. His writings \\"have dazzled as well as upset his readers; supporters praise his boldness and insight, and detractors condemn his alleged militarism and demagoguery.\\" Liu has written novels and essays to both acclaim and controversy; he is unusual in China, as a prominent military figure, for his outspoken views and apparent violation of a number of taboos on political discourse. At the same time, his prolific writing may have contributed in part to his rise through the ranks. He leans on the sayings of former Chinese leaders to make indirect criticisms of Chinese Communist Party policies. Unlike many PLA officials, Liu has traveled much overseas, including serving as a visiting professor at Stanford University. In 2010 Liu was promoted by deputy political commissar of the PLA Air Force, to political commissar of NDU, the premier academic and defense research institute in China. Prior to that Liu was the director of the political division of the Beijing Military Region, the political commissar of the Chengdu Military Region's Air Force, and the deputy political commissar of the PLA Air Force.  Comments on democracy and reform  Liu Yazhou made headlines in the West in 2010 when he made a series of public remarks about democracy in China. \\"Democracy is the most urgent; without it there is no sustainable rise. Ideals of democracy are not restricted by national borders, or by historical ones,\\" he said in August 2010, in an article in the Hong Kong magazine Phoenix Weekly. Remarks like this led to Liu gaining a reputation as an \\"outspoken\\" and \\"reformist\\" general. \\"'If a system fails to let its citizens breathe freely and release their creativity to the maximum extent, and fails to place those who best represent the system and its people into leadership positions, it is certain to perish,\\" he wrote. In an alleged internal speech in August 2013, Liu argues that reforms in China are now in \\"deep water\\" and that the country can no longer \\"cross the river by feeling for stones,\\" as Party patriarch Deng Xiaoping put it in the early period of growth of the 1990s. Liu suggests that further reforms require political change, and ultimately even competitive elections.  Hawkish stance  While Liu has made remarks that appear surprising in terms of supporting democracy and greater political openness, he has also been involved in strongly patriotic propaganda, most notably the documentary film Silent Contest, which proposes that there is a monumental ideological battle currently taking place between the United States and China. Liu's hawkishness can also differ from the more explicitly militarized claims of propaganda figures like Dai Xu and Zhang Zhaozhong. In an essay titled ‚ÄúThe Grand National Strategy\\" written in the wake of the September 11 terrorist attack, Liu argued against taking advantage of the fallout of the attack to attempt to conquer Taiwan. He advocated \\"diplomacy over fighting,\\" and suggested the exploitation of Taiwan's political system over strongarm tactics. For this, analyst Alfred Chan calls him a \\"nationalist and a realist.\\"  Selected works  * Win in Air Supremacy („ÄäËµ¢Âú®Âà∂Á©∫ÊùÉ„Äã), 2014. * Considerations on the War Dead in the First Sino-Japanese War („ÄäÁî≤ÂçàÊÆáÊÄù„Äã), 2014.

The time of its foundation is unclear, but the castle was most likely completed in 1324‚Äì25. It was demolished in 1367 by order of King Albert, as the local residents complained of heavy taxation for the upkeep of the castle. The castle was located on the Linnaluoto Island in the river Kokem√§enjoki.Salminen, Tapio: \\"Kumo castle, Aborch and Vreghdenborch ‚Äì sources and past scholarship, a revision\\" English summary, p. 70‚Äì74.

Its function was similar to that of the castles of Turku, H√§me and Vyborg, which are still preserved today. The only known reference to Kokem√§ki Castle is King Albert's warrant for the demolition and relocation of the castle, dated 12 July 1367. It was probably built of limestone and equipped with a round tower. In 1364‚Äì65 Kokem√§ki Castle was besieged by the army of King Albert as the castle was under the rule of Magnus IV of Sweden. Archaeological excavations were made in 1885. Various items were found which were dated to the late Bronze Age, as well as to the 13th and 14th century. After the demolition of Kokem√§ki Castle a new castle, Aborch, was established. Location of this castle is uncertain, since it was disbanded in the 1410s. It was probably built upstream at the same location as the later Kokem√§enkartano manor.

A Yalalag cross is a particular style of Christian cross made in Yalalag, Oaxaca, Mexico. It is a pendant cross with medals on the arms. The cross is made of heavy, dark coin silver. There are many variations on the basic design; all have crosses or medals hanging from the terminals. Some have pendants larger than the cross itself; often the center will feature a winged heart. They vary in length from 2 to 6 inches. Local women wear the crosses on strings of beads and pendants with birds or pomegranates. History The particular crosses have been made in Yalalag since at least the sixteenth century. They have an undetermined origin; similar crosses are worn in Spain, and the design is thought to have been brought to the area by Dominican missionaries who converted the local native population to Christianity. Over time the cross lost its Spanish character and became a Mexican object made by the local natives. Its design predates the conquest of the area by the Spanish. The women of Yalalag are known to have worn triple crosses when they encountered Hernando Cortes' soldiers and priests during their ventures in the area.

He earned the degree of Diploma in Electrical Engineering (Dipl√¥me d'Ing√©nieur en G√©nie Electrique) from √âcole Sp√©ciale des Travaux Publics, and Bachelor of Science (Licenci√© de Sciences) from Facult√© des sciences. He served in the French Army for a year during 1931-1932 following conscription. He was director of research at the Centre National de Recherche Scientifique (CNRS; the French National Centre for Scientific Research) in Paris, and subsequently Director of CNRS Laboratory in Orl√©ans. Perhaps, Mering is best remembered for his inspiration and influence on the British chemist Rosalind Franklin, whom he trained in X-ray crystallography. Franklins' X-ray crystallographic image, popularised as Photo 51, became the single piece of clue for the discovery of the double-stranded helical structure of DNA by James Watson and Francis Crick in 1953.  Biography  Mering was born in Vilkavi≈°kis, Russia, to a Jewish family. After formal education in Russia, he went to France in 1921 to study engineering. In 1925 he obtained the degree of Dipl√¥me d'Ing√©nieur en G√©nie Electrique from √âcole Sp√©ciale des Travaux Publics in Paris. He joined the Facult√© des sciences in Paris as research engineer in 1925, and at the same time enrolled in the institute for the course of Licenci√© de Sciences. He graduated in 1928. He continued to work as research engineer till 1931. In the late 1920s he trained for X-ray crystallography under Marcel Mathieu (who was trained in 1925-1926 under the Nobel laureate crystallographer William Henry Bragg at the Royal Institution in London). In 1930 he became a naturalised French citizen. Around 1931-1932 he was drafted to military service in the French Army. After conscription he joined Laboratoire Central des Services Chimique de l'Etat (now Institut National de Recherche Chimique Appliqu√©e), first in Montpellier, then Grenoble (now under Joseph Fourier University), and finally in Paris. At Grenoble he carried out his research as a refugee during World War II, and he set up the first X-ray laboratory there. He returned to Paris after the war in 1945. In 1959 he became director of research at the Centre National de Recherche Scientifique (CNRS). In 1969 director of CNRS Laboratory for Research on Imperfect Crystalline Solids in Orl√©ans, where he worked until his death. Mering died on 29 March 1973 after several months of severe illness.  Contributions  Mering published over 100 technical papers on X-ray and electron diffraction of clays and related layer silicates, and of carbon, graphite, and the phenomena involved in graphitisation. He also performed numerous experimental works on fine-grained materials, including crystal growth in gels, the crystalline organization in cellulose, the 'decoration' of kaolinite crystals with colloidal gold particles, clays as catalysts, montmorillonites, hectorite, and clay-organic complexes.  Personal life  Mering was known a strictly principled individual when it comes to academic ethics. He never claimed for co-authorship in publications of theses of his own students. (It was a tradition in France at the time.) Moreover, he never published with more than three co-authors, (one of them would be an external collaborator if there are three) although his laboratory was always in full capacity in terms of researchers. His work ethic was noted for its demanding efforts, but during breaks he maintained absolute liberty. Researchers were encourages to make friends with each other, share their meals, make coffee, go for outings, and discuss about their scientific work, politics, and social issues. In his private life, Mering had his own frivolity. Although he was separated from his wife, he never divorced her, while he charmed a mistress and other girls. He was described as \\"a deliberate charmer with whom all the young women were in love\\".  Honours and recognitions  Mering was the founder member and President (1956-1958) of Groupe Fran√ßais des Argiles and was president. He was president of the Groupe Fran√ßais d'Etude des Carbones, and of the Association Fran√ßaise de Cristallographie. At the time of his death, he was Vice-Pr√©sident of the Soci√©t√© Fran√ßaise de Min√©ralogie et Cristallographie. He was also elected member of the Clay Minerals Society of USA. A technical book titled X-Ray Diffraction by Disordered Lamellar Structures was published in 1990 by his former students and collaborators in a tribute to his works.

Historical Dictionary of the Peoples of the Southeast Asian Massif (Historical Dictionaries of Peoples and Cultures). Scarecrow Press, April 19, 2006. , 9780810865037. p. 209. The book includes Savina's theories and views of the Hmong. Savina argued that the Hmong had non-Asian origins because their legends had similarities to European stories.Cha, Dia (Learning through folklore series). Teaching with Folk Stories of the Hmong: An Activity Book. Libraries Unlimited, 2000. , 9781563086687. p. 1. Jean Michaud, author of Historical Dictionary of the Peoples of the Southeast Asian Massif, described the book as \\"highly original yet controversial work of applied ethnography and largely conjectural history\\". Mark Pfeifer of the Hmong Cultural and Resource Center wrote that the book is \\"Not supported by any available empirical evidence, not given credence by contemporary scholars\\".Pfeifer, p. 3/20. A statement Michaud, in a biography of Savina included to his 'Incidental' Ethnographers. French Catholic Missions on the Tonkin-Yunnan Frontier, 1880-1930, contributes to refine by showing the staggering extent of Savina's field experience and proficiency in several vernacular languages, including Hmong/Miao. Analyzing critically Histoire des Miao (pp. 186‚Äì203), Michaud shows that it is not so much Savina's ethnography that is lacking, but his critical sense as visible in unwarranted historical assumptions rendered partial by his Catholic faith.
