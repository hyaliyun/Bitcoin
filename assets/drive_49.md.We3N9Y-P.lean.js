It stars Emilio Estevez, Kiefer Sutherland, Lou Diamond Phillips, and Christian Slater, and features William Petersen as Pat Garrett. It was written and produced by John Fusco and directed by Geoff Murphy. It follows the life of Billy the Kid (played by Emilio Estevez), in the years following the Lincoln County War in which Billy was part of \\"The Regulators\\" ‚Äì a group of around six highly skilled gunmen avenging the death of John Tunstall ‚Äì and the years leading up to Billy's documented death. The film, however, is told by Brushy Bill Roberts, a man who in 1950 appeared claiming to be the real Billy the Kid. While the film takes some creative license, it does show some of the main events leading up to Billy's documented death, including his talks with Governor Lew Wallace, his capture by friend-turned-foe Pat Garrett, his trial, and his subsequent escape in which he killed two deputies. Plot In 1950, attorney Charles Phalen is contacted by an elderly man named \\"Brushy Bill\\" Roberts. Brushy Bill tells Phalen that he is dying and wants to receive a pardon that he was promised 70 years before by the governor of New Mexico, claiming that he is really William H. Bonney aka \\"Billy The Kid\\", whom \\"everyone\\" knows to have been shot and killed by Pat Garrett in 1881. Phalen then asks if Bill has any proof that he is the famous outlaw. Brushy Bill's story begins with the remaining Regulators having gone their separate ways. Billy has become part of a new gang with \\"Arkansas\\" Dave Rudabaugh (Slater) and Pat Garrett (Petersen). The New Mexico governor has issued warrants for the arrests of those involved in the Lincoln County Wars, including Billy, Doc Scurlock (Sutherland), and Jose Chavez y Chavez (Phillips), who are dragged into town and imprisoned to await hanging. Meanwhile, Billy meets with the new governor Lew Wallace who agrees to pardon Billy if he testifies against the Dolan-Murphy faction. Billy soon finds out that he was tricked into being arrested with no chance of testifying against his old enemies. After escaping, Billy along with the help of Rudabaugh and Garrett, pose as a lynch mob to spring Doc and Chavez from jail. When the gang successfully escape Lincoln, Billy mentions the Mexican Blackbird (a broken trail only a few others and he know that leads to Mexico). Garrett decides not to go with the gang, and instead, opens a boarding house. Rudabaugh, clearly in competition with Billy, wants to lead the gang. As they make a run for the border along with farmer Hendry William French (Alan Ruck) and 14-year-old Tom O'Folliard (Balthazar Getty), cattle baron John Simpson Chisum (James Coburn) and Governor Wallace approach Garrett to offer him the job as Lincoln County sheriff and $1000 to use whatever resources he needs to hunt Bonney down and kill him. Garrett agrees, and forming a posse, begins his pursuit of the gang. Chisum was approached by Billy earlier in the film, and Chisum refused to help. So, Billy steals some of his cattle to get money they can use to get to Mexico. Billy and the gang soon come to the town of White Oaks, where they meet with former companion, Jane Greathouse (Jenny Wright), who runs a local bordello. Later that night, the town lynch mob comes for the gang and is intent on a hanging. Deputy Carlisle tries to negotiate a deal, \\"the Indian\\" (Chavez) for a safe ride out. Billy refuses the offer and pushes the deputy out the door, who is then accidentally killed by the lynch mob. Garrett soon tracks Billy to the bordello, but is too late. In response to rebuffs by Jane, Garrett uses his newfound power as Lincoln County sheriff to declare her bordello a \\"house of sin\\", and burns it down. Jane decides to strip naked to humiliate the townsfolk and leave town. Meanwhile, Billy and his gang are continuously tracked by Garrett's posse, narrowly evading capture, but Tom (being mistaken for Billy) is soon shot dead by Garrett. As they hide out, Billy admits that the Mexican Blackbird does not exist; it was just a pawn to get the gang back together and to keep riding. Doc is angered and tries to leave for home, but he is shot by one of Garrett's men and sacrifices himself to enable his friends to escape an ambush. Billy the Kid is soon brought back into Lincoln by Garrett and is sentenced to death by hanging. He is then visited by Jane Greathouse, who arranges to leave a pistol in an outhouse. Billy uses the pistol to kill two guards and escapes to Old Fort Sumner. By the time he arrives, Dave has abandoned the group to make his way to Mexico, and Chavez is dying from a bullet wound he sustained during the ambush that killed Doc. During the night, Garrett finds Billy unarmed. Billy asks Garrett to let him run to Mexico and tell the authorities that he killed him. Garrett declines because he believes Billy would not be able to resist coming back to the United States (which would lead to Garrett's death for lying). Billy turns around, forcing Garrett to have to shoot him in the back, which he does not. In the morning, a fake burial is staged for Billy, and Garrett's horse is seen being taken by an unknown figure (implied to be Billy). Brushy Bill admits he never stole a horse from someone he did not like, and further admits he did not just like Garrett, he loved him. Phalen, convinced that Brushy Bill is Billy the Kid, agrees to help him. The epilogue reveals that Arkansas Dave was beheaded once he reached Mexico to discourage more outlaws from crossing the border; Garrett's book detailing his pursuit of Billy was a dismal failure and he is eventually shot and killed in 1908; Brushy Bill met with the governor of New Mexico, but despite corroboration from several surviving friends of the Kid, he was discredited and died less than a month later; whether or not Brushy Bill was Billy the Kid remains a mystery. The final shot shows Billy pointing his gun at an off-screen target, saying to the target \\"I'll make you famous\\". CastProduction Screenwriter-producer John Fusco culled much of Billy's dialogue from actual newspaper interviews and reports between 1879-1881. Fusco also appears as the \\"Branded Man\\" in the prison pit escape scene alongside Jon Bon Jovi. The cattle brand on Fusco's face reads J.C. for cattle rancher John Chisum. The film's original screenplay accurately portrays Scurlock as heading to Texas with his bride. It has been reported that Kiefer Sutherland, faced with scheduling conflicts, refused to return to the Young Guns franchise unless his character died in the movie's \\"Stinking Springs Shoot Out\\". Writer John Fusco fought against this demand, but ultimately rewrote the scene to accommodate Sutherland's schedule. John Chisum, played by James Coburn, in the film convinces Pat Garrett to accept a job as the new Lincoln County Sheriff. Coburn himself played Garrett in Sam Peckinpah's Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid (1973). Soundtrack=Blaze of Glory= Emilio Estevez originally approached Jon Bon Jovi to ask him for permission to include the song \\"Wanted Dead Or Alive\\" on the soundtrack.July 16, 1990 Jon Bon Jovi's Solo Debut with his band members Leads Him to the Brink of An Abyss People.com Bon Jovi didn't feel the song's lyrics were appropriate; however, he was inspired by the project and resolved to write a new song for the film that would be more in keeping with the period and setting. He quickly wrote the song \\"Blaze of Glory\\", and performed it on acoustic guitar in the Utah desert for Estevez and John Fusco. \\"Blaze of Glory\\" went on to reach No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100. Jon Bon Jovi would go on to name his debut solo album Blaze of Glory (released as Young Guns II: Blaze Of Glory in the UK),Blaze of Glory soundtrack details Soundtrackcollector.com which included the eponymous single as well as other songs from and inspired by the film. The album peaked at No. 3 on the Billboard 200 and No. 2 on the UK Albums Chart. Jon Bon Jovi also made a cameo appearance in the film, as one of the prisoners in the pit with Doc and Chavez (he can be seen 28 minutes and 8 seconds into the movie). =Score album= The film's original score was composed and conducted by Alan Silvestri,Alan Silvestri discography Alan-silvestri.com who provided string arrangements for the song \\"Santa Fe\\" and has one brief track on Blaze Of Glory.

L(G) is constructed in the following way: for each edge in G, make a vertex in L(G); for every two edges in G that have a vertex in common, make an edge between their corresponding vertices in L(G). The name line graph comes from a paper by although both and used the construction before this. Other terms used for the line graph include the covering graph, the derivative, the edge-to-vertex dual, the conjugate, the representative graph, and the œë-obrazom, as well as the edge graph, the interchange graph, the adjoint graph, and the derived graph., p. 71. proved that with one exceptional case the structure of a connected graph G can be recovered completely from its line graph. Many other properties of line graphs follow by translating the properties of the underlying graph from vertices into edges, and by Whitney's theorem the same translation can also be done in the other direction. Line graphs are claw-free, and the line graphs of bipartite graphs are perfect. Line graphs are characterized by nine forbidden subgraphs and can be recognized in linear time. Various extensions of the concept of a line graph have been studied, including line graphs of line graphs, line graphs of multigraphs, line graphs of hypergraphs, and line graphs of weighted graphs. Formal definition Given a graph G, its line graph L(G) is a graph such that * each vertex of L(G) represents an edge of G; and * two vertices of L(G) are adjacent if and only if their corresponding edges share a common endpoint (\\"are incident\\") in G. That is, it is the intersection graph of the edges of G, representing each edge by the set of its two endpoints.  Example  The following figures show a graph (left, with blue vertices) and its line graph (right, with green vertices). Each vertex of the line graph is shown labeled with the pair of endpoints of the corresponding edge in the original graph. For instance, the green vertex on the right labeled 1,3 corresponds to the edge on the left between the blue vertices 1 and 3. Green vertex 1,3 is adjacent to three other green vertices: 1,4 and 1,2 (corresponding to edges sharing the endpoint 1 in the blue graph) and 4,3 (corresponding to an edge sharing the endpoint 3 in the blue graph). File:Line graph construction 1.svg|Graph G File:Line graph construction 2.svg|Vertices in L(G) constructed from edges in G File:Line graph construction 3.svg|Added edges in L(G) File:Line graph construction 4.svg|The line graph L(G)  Properties =Translated properties of the underlying graph= Properties of a graph G that depend only on adjacency between edges may be translated into equivalent properties in L(G) that depend on adjacency between vertices. For instance, a matching in G is a set of edges no two of which are adjacent, and corresponds to a set of vertices in L(G) no two of which are adjacent, that is, an independent set. Thus, * The line graph of a connected graph is connected. If G is connected, it contains a path connecting any two of its edges, which translates into a path in L(G) containing any two of the vertices of L(G). However, a graph G that has some isolated vertices, and is therefore disconnected, may nevertheless have a connected line graph.The need to consider isolated vertices when considering the connectivity of line graphs is pointed out by , p. 32. * A line graph has an articulation point if and only if the underlying graph has a bridge for which neither endpoint has degree one. * For a graph G with n vertices and m edges, the number of vertices of the line graph L(G) is m, and the number of edges of L(G) is half the sum of the squares of the degrees of the vertices in G, minus m., Theorem 8.1, p. 72. * An independent set in L(G) corresponds to a matching in G. In particular, a maximum independent set in L(G) corresponds to maximum matching in G. Since maximum matchings may be found in polynomial time, so may the maximum independent sets of line graphs, despite the hardness of the maximum independent set problem for more general families of graphs. Similarly, a rainbow-independent set in L(G) corresponds to a rainbow matching in G. * The edge chromatic number of a graph G is equal to the vertex chromatic number of its line graph L(G).. Also in free online edition, Chapter 5 (\\"Colouring\\"), p. 118. * The line graph of an edge-transitive graph is vertex-transitive. This property can be used to generate families of graphs that (like the Petersen graph) are vertex-transitive but are not Cayley graphs: if G is an edge- transitive graph that has at least five vertices, is not bipartite, and has odd vertex degrees, then L(G) is a vertex-transitive non-Cayley graph.. Lauri and Scapellato credit this result to Mark Watkins. * If a graph G has an Euler cycle, that is, if G is connected and has an even number of edges at each vertex, then the line graph of G is Hamiltonian. However, not all Hamiltonian cycles in line graphs come from Euler cycles in this way; for instance, the line graph of a Hamiltonian graph G is itself Hamiltonian, regardless of whether G is also Eulerian., Theorem 8.8, p. 80. * If two simple graphs are isomorphic then their line graphs are also isomorphic. The Whitney graph isomorphism theorem provides a converse to this for all but one pair of graphs. * In the context of complex network theory, the line graph of a random network preserves many of the properties of the network such as the small- world property (the existence of short paths between all pairs of vertices) and the shape of its degree distribution. observe that any method for finding vertex clusters in a complex network can be applied to the line graph and used to cluster its edges instead. =Whitney isomorphism theorem= The diamond graph, an exception to the strong Whitney theorem If the line graphs of two connected graphs are isomorphic, then the underlying graphs are isomorphic, except in the case of the triangle graph K3 and the claw K1,3, which have isomorphic line graphs but are not themselves isomorphic.; ; , Theorem 8.3, p. 72\\\\. Harary gives a simplified proof of this theorem by . As well as K3 and K1,3, there are some other exceptional small graphs with the property that their line graph has a higher degree of symmetry than the graph itself. For instance, the diamond graph K1,1,2 (two triangles sharing an edge) has four graph automorphisms but its line graph K1,2,2 has eight. In the illustration of the diamond graph shown, rotating the graph by 90 degrees is not a symmetry of the graph, but is a symmetry of its line graph. However, all such exceptional cases have at most four vertices. A strengthened version of the Whitney isomorphism theorem states that, for connected graphs with more than four vertices, there is a one-to-one correspondence between isomorphisms of the graphs and isomorphisms of their line graphs.; . Analogues of the Whitney isomorphism theorem have been proven for the line graphs of multigraphs, but are more complicated in this case. =Strongly regular and perfect line graphs= A line perfect graph. The edges in each biconnected component are colored black if the component is bipartite, blue if the component is a tetrahedron, and red if the component is a book of triangles. The line graph of the complete graph Kn is also known as the triangular graph, the Johnson graph J(n, 2), or the complement of the Kneser graph KGn,2. Triangular graphs are characterized by their spectra, except for n = 8.. See in particular Proposition 8, p. 262. They may also be characterized (again with the exception of K8) as the strongly regular graphs with parameters srg(n(n ‚àí 1)/2, 2(n ‚àí 2), n ‚àí 2, 4)., Theorem 8.6, p. 79\\\\. Harary credits this result to independent papers by L. C. Chang (1959) and A. J. Hoffman (1960). The three strongly regular graphs with the same parameters and spectrum as L(K8) are the Chang graphs, which may be obtained by graph switching from L(K8). The line graph of a bipartite graph is perfect (see K≈ënig's theorem), but need not be bipartite as the example of the claw graph shows. The line graphs of bipartite graphs form one of the key building blocks of perfect graphs, used in the proof of the strong perfect graph theorem.. See also . A special case of these graphs are the rook's graphs, line graphs of complete bipartite graphs. Like the line graphs of complete graphs, they can be characterized with one exception by their numbers of vertices, numbers of edges, and number of shared neighbors for adjacent and non-adjacent points. The one exceptional case is L(K4,4), which shares its parameters with the Shrikhande graph. When both sides of the bipartition have the same number of vertices, these graphs are again strongly regular., Theorem 8.7, p. 79\\\\. Harary credits this characterization of line graphs of complete bipartite graphs to Moon and Hoffman. The case of equal numbers of vertices on both sides had previously been proven by Shrikhande. More generally, a graph G is said to be a line perfect graph if L(G) is a perfect graph. The line perfect graphs are exactly the graphs that do not contain a simple cycle of odd length greater than three.; . Equivalently, a graph is line perfect if and only if each of its biconnected components is either bipartite or of the form K4 (the tetrahedron) or K1,1,n (a book of one or more triangles all sharing a common edge). Every line perfect graph is itself perfect. =Other related graph families= All line graphs are claw-free graphs, graphs without an induced subgraph in the form of a three-leaf tree. As with claw-free graphs more generally, every connected line graph L(G) with an even number of edges has a perfect matching;. . equivalently, this means that if the underlying graph G has an even number of edges, its edges can be partitioned into two-edge paths. The line graphs of trees are exactly the claw-free block graphs., Theorem 8.5, p. 78\\\\. Harary credits the result to Gary Chartrand. These graphs have been used to solve a problem in extremal graph theory, of constructing a graph with a given number of edges and vertices whose largest tree induced as a subgraph is as small as possible.. All eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix A of a line graph are at least ‚àí2. The reason for this is that A can be written as A = J^\\\\mathsf{T}J - 2I, where J is the signless incidence matrix of the pre-line graph and I is the identity. In particular, A + 2I is the Gramian matrix of a system of vectors: all graphs with this property have been called generalized line graphs.  Characterization and recognition =Clique partition= Partition of a line graph into cliques For an arbitrary graph G, and an arbitrary vertex v in G, the set of edges incident to v corresponds to a clique in the line graph L(G). The cliques formed in this way partition the edges of L(G). Each vertex of L(G) belongs to exactly two of them (the two cliques corresponding to the two endpoints of the corresponding edge in G). The existence of such a partition into cliques can be used to characterize the line graphs: A graph L is the line graph of some other graph or multigraph if and only if it is possible to find a collection of cliques in L (allowing some of the cliques to be single vertices) that partition the edges of L, such that each vertex of L belongs to exactly two of the cliques., Theorem 8.4, p. 74, gives three equivalent characterizations of line graphs: the partition of the edges into cliques, the property of being claw-free and odd diamond-free, and the nine forbidden graphs of Beineke. It is the line graph of a graph (rather than a multigraph) if this set of cliques satisfies the additional condition that no two vertices of L are both in the same two cliques. Given such a family of cliques, the underlying graph G for which L is the line graph can be recovered by making one vertex in G for each clique, and an edge in G for each vertex in L with its endpoints being the two cliques containing the vertex in L. By the strong version of Whitney's isomorphism theorem, if the underlying graph G has more than four vertices, there can be only one partition of this type. For example, this characterization can be used to show that the following graph is not a line graph: :100px In this example, the edges going upward, to the left, and to the right from the central degree-four vertex do not have any cliques in common. Therefore, any partition of the graph's edges into cliques would have to have at least one clique for each of these three edges, and these three cliques would all intersect in that central vertex, violating the requirement that each vertex appear in exactly two cliques. Thus, the graph shown is not a line graph. =Forbidden subgraphs= The nine minimal non-line graphs, from Beineke's forbidden-subgraph characterization of line graphs. A graph is a line graph if and only if it does not contain one of these nine graphs as an induced subgraph. Another characterization of line graphs was proven in (and reported earlier without proof by ). He showed that there are nine minimal graphs that are not line graphs, such that any graph that is not a line graph has one of these nine graphs as an induced subgraph. That is, a graph is a line graph if and only if no subset of its vertices induces one of these nine graphs. In the example above, the four topmost vertices induce a claw (that is, a complete bipartite graph K1,3), shown on the top left of the illustration of forbidden subgraphs. Therefore, by Beineke's characterization, this example cannot be a line graph. For graphs with minimum degree at least 5, only the six subgraphs in the left and right columns of the figure are needed in the characterization. =Algorithms= and described linear time algorithms for recognizing line graphs and reconstructing their original graphs. generalized these methods to directed graphs. described an efficient data structure for maintaining a dynamic graph, subject to vertex insertions and deletions, and maintaining a representation of the input as a line graph (when it exists) in time proportional to the number of changed edges at each step. The algorithms of and are based on characterizations of line graphs involving odd triangles (triangles in the line graph with the property that there exists another vertex adjacent to an odd number of triangle vertices). However, the algorithm of uses only Whitney's isomorphism theorem. It is complicated by the need to recognize deletions that cause the remaining graph to become a line graph, but when specialized to the static recognition problem only insertions need to be performed, and the algorithm performs the following steps: *Construct the input graph L by adding vertices one at a time, at each step choosing a vertex to add that is adjacent to at least one previously-added vertex. While adding vertices to L, maintain a graph G for which L = L(G); if the algorithm ever fails to find an appropriate graph G, then the input is not a line graph and the algorithm terminates. *When adding a vertex v to a graph L(G) for which G has four or fewer vertices, it might be the case that the line graph representation is not unique. But in this case, the augmented graph is small enough that a representation of it as a line graph can be found by a brute force search in constant time. *When adding a vertex v to a larger graph L that equals the line graph of another graph G, let S be the subgraph of G formed by the edges that correspond to the neighbors of v in L. Check that S has a vertex cover consisting of one vertex or two non-adjacent vertices. If there are two vertices in the cover, augment G by adding an edge (corresponding to v) that connects these two vertices. If there is only one vertex in the cover, then add a new vertex to G, adjacent to this vertex. Each step either takes constant time, or involves finding a vertex cover of constant size within a graph S whose size is proportional to the number of neighbors of v. Thus, the total time for the whole algorithm is proportional to the sum of the numbers of neighbors of all vertices, which (by the handshaking lemma) is proportional to the number of input edges. Iterating the line graph operator consider the sequence of graphs :G, L(G), L(L(G)), L(L(L(G))), \\\\dots.\\\\ They show that, when G is a finite connected graph, only four behaviors are possible for this sequence: *If G is a cycle graph then L(G) and each subsequent graph in this sequence are isomorphic to G itself. These are the only connected graphs for which L(G) is isomorphic to G.This result is also Theorem 8.2 of . *If G is a claw K1,3, then L(G) and all subsequent graphs in the sequence are triangles. *If G is a path graph then each subsequent graph in the sequence is a shorter path until eventually the sequence terminates with an empty graph. *In all remaining cases, the sizes of the graphs in this sequence eventually increase without bound. If G is not connected, this classification applies separately to each component of G. For connected graphs that are not paths, all sufficiently high numbers of iteration of the line graph operation produce graphs that are Hamiltonian., Theorem 8.11, p. 81\\\\. Harary credits this result to Gary Chartrand.  Generalizations = Medial graphs and convex polyhedra = When a planar graph G has maximum vertex degree three, its line graph is planar, and every planar embedding of G can be extended to an embedding of L(G). However, there exist planar graphs with higher degree whose line graphs are nonplanar. These include, for example, the 5-star K1,5, the gem graph formed by adding two non- crossing diagonals within a regular pentagon, and all convex polyhedra with a vertex of degree four or more.; . An alternative construction, the medial graph, coincides with the line graph for planar graphs with maximum degree three, but is always planar. It has the same vertices as the line graph, but potentially fewer edges: two vertices of the medial graph are adjacent if and only if the corresponding two edges are consecutive on some face of the planar embedding. The medial graph of the dual graph of a plane graph is the same as the medial graph of the original plane graph.. For regular polyhedra or simple polyhedra, the medial graph operation can be represented geometrically by the operation of cutting off each vertex of the polyhedron by a plane through the midpoints of all its incident edges.. This operation is known variously as the second truncation,. degenerate truncation,. or rectification. =Total graphs= The total graph T(G) of a graph G has as its vertices the elements (vertices or edges) of G, and has an edge between two elements whenever they are either incident or adjacent. The total graph may also be obtained by subdividing each edge of G and then taking the square of the subdivided graph., p. 82. =Multigraphs= The concept of the line graph of G may naturally be extended to the case where G is a multigraph. In this case, the characterizations of these graphs can be simplified: the characterization in terms of clique partitions no longer needs to prevent two vertices from belonging to the same to cliques, and the characterization by forbidden graphs has seven forbidden graphs instead of nine. However, for multigraphs, there are larger numbers of pairs of non-isomorphic graphs that have the same line graphs. For instance a complete bipartite graph K1,n has the same line graph as the dipole graph and Shannon multigraph with the same number of edges. Nevertheless, analogues to Whitney's isomorphism theorem can still be derived in this case. =Line digraphs= Construction of the de Bruijn graphs as iterated line digraphs It is also possible to generalize line graphs to directed graphs. If G is a directed graph, its directed line graph or line digraph has one vertex for each edge of G. Two vertices representing directed edges from u to v and from w to x in G are connected by an edge from uv to wx in the line digraph when v = w. That is, each edge in the line digraph of G represents a length-two directed path in G. The de Bruijn graphs may be formed by repeating this process of forming directed line graphs, starting from a complete directed graph. =Weighted line graphs= In a line graph L(G), each vertex of degree k in the original graph G creates k(k ‚àí 1)/2 edges in the line graph. For many types of analysis this means high-degree nodes in G are over-represented in the line graph L(G). For instance, consider a random walk on the vertices of the original graph G. This will pass along some edge e with some frequency f. On the other hand, this edge e is mapped to a unique vertex, say v, in the line graph L(G). If we now perform the same type of random walk on the vertices of the line graph, the frequency with which v is visited can be completely different from f. If our edge e in G was connected to nodes of degree O(k), it will be traversed O(k2) more frequently in the line graph L(G). Put another way, the Whitney graph isomorphism theorem guarantees that the line graph almost always encodes the topology of the original graph G faithfully but it does not guarantee that dynamics on these two graphs have a simple relationship. One solution is to construct a weighted line graph, that is, a line graph with weighted edges. There are several natural ways to do this. For instance if edges d and e in the graph G are incident at a vertex v with degree k, then in the line graph L(G) the edge connecting the two vertices d and e can be given weight 1/(k ‚àí 1). In this way every edge in G (provided neither end is connected to a vertex of degree 1) will have strength 2 in the line graph L(G) corresponding to the two ends that the edge has in G. It is straightforward to extend this definition of a weighted line graph to cases where the original graph G was directed or even weighted. The principle in all cases is to ensure the line graph L(G) reflects the dynamics as well as the topology of the original graph G. =Line graphs of hypergraphs= The edges of a hypergraph may form an arbitrary family of sets, so the line graph of a hypergraph is the same as the intersection graph of the sets from the family. = Disjointness graph = The disjointness graph of G, denoted D(G), is constructed in the following way: for each edge in G, make a vertex in D(G); for every two edges in G that do not have a vertex in common, make an edge between their corresponding vertices in D(G). In other words, D(G) is the complement graph of L(G). A clique in D(G) corresponds to an independent set in L(G), and vice versa.

In 1974 Irish was removed as a requirement for entry to the civil service. =Textbooks= Significant changes in the Leaving Certificate maths curriculum were reflected in two new textbooks produced by the Irish Christian Brothers. However, material for the new honours (higher-level) syllabus was offered only in a government-subsidised book in Irish, while the pass (lower-level) material was published in English.

Section 4 effectively adds the Crown Stewards and Bailiffs of the Chiltern Hundreds and of the Manor of Northstead to Part III to Schedule 1, thus naming them as offices whose holders are disqualified. These offices are sinecures, used in modern times to effect resignation from the House of Commons. Prior to 1926, this disqualification was due to them being \\"offices of profit under the Crown\\", but that disqualification was abolished in 1926 and by s. 1(4) of this Act. The election to the Commons of a disqualified person is invalid, and the seat of an MP who becomes disqualified is vacated immediately (triggering a by- election). The Privy Council has jurisdiction to determine whether a purported MP is disqualified; the issue may be tried in the High Court, Court of Session or High Court of Northern Ireland as appropriate for the constituency.  Amendments  This Act was amended by subsequent legislation: * The Disqualifications Act 2000, a consequence of the Good Friday Agreement, added the words \\"other than Ireland\\", prior to which Irish legislators were disqualified just as any other foreign legislators are. This was to bring them in line with treatment of Commonwealth legislators; however, no one has taken advantage of this privilege. * Previously, all ministers of the Church of Scotland, priests, and deacons were disqualified. The House of Commons (Removal of Clergy Disqualification) Act 2001 restricted this disqualification to only Lords Spiritual, i.e. the most senior Anglican bishops who already sit in the House of Lords ex officio. * Various enactments have amended the lists of disqualified bodies and offices, particularly as they have come in or out of existence or fallen out of government control. For example, employees of British Gas were disqualified until the company was privatised.

Distraction is caused by: the lack of ability to pay attention; lack of interest in the object of attention; or the great intensity, novelty or attractiveness of something other than the object of attention. Distractions come from both external sources, and internal sources. External distractions include factors such as visual triggers, social interactions, music, text messages, and phone calls. There are also internal distractions such as hunger, fatigue, illness, worrying, and daydreaming. Both external and internal distractions contribute to the interference of focus.  In the car  Distracted driving is a dangerous threat to road safety across the world. While drunk driving rates have been on the decline since 1983, distracted driving has been increasing in recent years. Many feel this incline is due to the widespread prevalence of cell phones. While distracted driving can be attributed to anything that diverts attention away from the road, it is often the cell phone that receives the blame for distracted driving incidents. Most of the recent Studies have shown that cell phone usage while driving has striking similarities to the effects of drinking while driving; Cell phones tend to take the driver's attention away from the road and onto itself. With drunk driving, drivers often experience the \\"looking but not seeing\\" phenomena. While their eyes do indeed view objects on the road, their brains do not comprehend the meaning behind the image. All levels of distraction while driving are dangerous, and potential drivers are cautioned to keep awareness of their surroundings.  In the classroom  Many psychological studies show that switching between tasks, use of technology, and overstimulation has increased levels of distraction in the school setting. At school, distraction is often viewed as a source of poor performance and misbehavior. Distraction makes focusing on singular, assigned tasks more difficult. Digital components of learning are an emerging component to classroom distraction. Parents, teachers, students, and scholars all have opinions about how technology either benefits or harms a students‚Äô focus in an academic setting. Research studies show that neuron circuits indicate a decrease in ability to be attentive to goal relative stimulus with the addition of distracting stimuli interference. School-aged students, with developing brains, are more apt to conflicting stimuli while trying to focus. Large classroom sizes, technology use in and outside the classroom, and less natural stimuli have been seen as contributing factors to deflating test scores and classroom participation. In the workplace Some office workers use so many computer programs at once that they have to use two screens. Multitasking could also be considered as distraction in situations requiring full attention on a single object (e.g., sports, academic tests, performance). The issue of distraction in the workplace is studied in interruption science. According to Gloria Mark, a leader in interruption science, the average knowledge worker switches tasks every three minutes, and, once distracted, a worker takes nearly a half-hour to resume the original task. In fiction In works of fiction, distraction is often used as a source of comedy, whether the amusement comes from the gullibility of those distracted or the strangeness of whatever is utilized to create the distraction. Examples of comedic distraction, also called comic relief, can oftentimes be found in Shakespearean plays. In Hamlet, Shakespeare includes a scene in which two gravediggers joke around about Ophelia's death. While her death is by no means meant to be funny, a small break from the sadness helped to appease the groundlings in Shakespeare's time, as well as allow the rest of the audience to take a break from the constant \\"doom and gloom\\" of his tragedies. In religion Rabbi Allen Lew in his book, This is Real and You are Completely Unprepared, writes, \\"The thoughts that carry our attention away [during prayer or meditation] are never insignificant thoughts and they never arise at random. We lose our focus precisely because these thoughts need our attention and we refuse to give it to them. This is why they keep sneaking up on our attention and stealing it away. This is how it is that we come to know ourselves as we settle deeply into the act of prayer [or meditation]\\". According to philosopher Damon Young, distraction is chiefly an inability to identify, attend to or attain what is valuable, even when we are hard-working or content. In warfare * Fake targets: ** In open field with mass military strategy, sometimes a contingent of troops distracts the enemy army to expose their flank, or to draw them away from a key point or fortification. ** Flares can divert enemy soldiers' gaze. Distraction was a key battle strategy in tales from the Trojan War. According to the legend, the Greeks seemed to have retreated by pretending to sail away. In their stead, they left a large wooden horse, which the Trojans then chose to bring back within their walls in order to celebrate their supposed victory. The Greeks used the Trojans' pride as a distraction, as they actually hid men within the Trojan Horse in order to let the rest of the army in during the cover of night. The Greeks then entered and destroyed the city of Troy, effectively ending the 10-year standoff that was the Trojan War. In medicine Clove oil (Syzygium aromaticum) essential oil in glass vial Distraction is useful in the management of pain and anxiety. Dentists, for example may intentionally hum an annoying tune or engage in small talk just to create a diversion from the dental surgery process. Topical ointments containing capsaicin, provide a superficial burning sensation that can momentarily distract a patient's attention away from the more serious pain of arthritis or muscle strain. A similar effect is made by oil of cloves, which produces a burning sensation on the gums, and distracts from toothache. Distraction is often used as a coping mechanism for short-term emotion regulation. When presented with an unpleasant reality, humans often choose to occupy their attention with some other reality in order to remain in a positive mental state. This is referred to as ‚Äòprocrastination‚Äô when the unpleasant reality is in the form of work. The natural human inclination to distract oneself was put to the test when the Department of Psychology at Humboldt-Universit√§t zu Berlin (Humboldt University of Berlin) held an experiment to study distraction. The goal of the experiment was to examine whether the effects of distraction on where subjects held their attention during repeated picture processing is changed by regular emotional functions. Furthermore, they hypothesized that while distraction assists in short-term emotional regulation, it is actually harmful in the long term. In order to do so, the experimenters had subjects view 15 unpleasant pictures (Set A) and ‚Äúattend‚Äù to them (meaning the subjects were asked to pay full attention to the pictures). Next, the subjects were shown 15 unpleasant pictures (Set B) and were asked to distract themselves from the pictures (meaning they were to think about anything other than the picture on the screen; their example was to think about ‚Äúthe way to the supermarket‚Äù). Finally, the subjects were shown 15 neutral pictures (Set C) and were asked to attend to them. After 10 minutes of rest, the subjects entered the ‚Äúre-exposure phase‚Äù, which repeated the experiment- this time requiring the subjects to pay attention to all of the sets, including Set B. This experiment was performed on 3 separate blocks of participants. To examine the state of the subjects‚Äô brain, the subject was to wear ‚ÄúAg/AgCl-electrodes from 61 head sites using an EasyCap electrode system with an equidistant electrode montage. Additional external electrodes were placed below the left (IO1) and right eye (IO2), below T1 (ground), on the nasion, and on the neck.‚Äù The subjects were also asked to rate the unpleasantness of the picture on the screen on a scale of 1-9. To test whether distraction in the first phase resulted in increased responsiveness during the re-exposure phase, experimenters ‚Äúcompared mean unpleasantness ratings between unpleasant pictures that were previously presented in the attend (previous attention) versus distract (previous distraction) condition using a paired t-test‚Äù. The end results of the experiment were as such: * When presented with repeated neutral and unpleasant images, subjects had reduced unpleasant stimuli as reflected in their decreased LPP (late positive potential) amplitudes, but only when the participants were asked to attend to those pictures. * When the subjects avoided confrontation with the unpleasant pictures through distraction, decrease in responsiveness was prevented as reflected in their constant LPP amplitudes. Essentially, when exposed to an unpleasant image, the subject feels initial discomfort. However, after being exposed to it once with their full attention, the subject feels much less discomfort the second time they are exposed. When the subject distracts themselves from the initial unpleasant image, the subject feels more discomfort the second time when they are required to attend to the image. The experimenters‚Äô conclusion is thus: ‚Äúthe obtained results suggest that distraction inhibits elaborate processing of the stimulus' meaning and adapting to it.‚Äù In crime Con artists and shoplifters sometimes create a distraction to facilitate their crimes. Armed robbers may create a distraction after their robbery, such as pulling a fire alarm, to create confusion and aid in their getaway. In a more serious case of crime, Norwegian Anders Behring Breivik exploded a car bomb in Oslo city. It was a reportedly distraction that directed police resources to Oslo city, allowing him to carry out his shooting spree unopposed on Ut√∏ya island. In stage magic Magicians use distraction techniques to draw the audience's attention away from whichever hand is engaged in sleight of hand. Magicians can accomplish this by encouraging the audience to look elsewhere or by having an assistant do or say something to draw the audience's attention away. Sleight of hand is often used in close-up magic, performed with the audience close to the magician, usually within three or four meters, possibly in physical contact. It often makes use of everyday items as props, such as cards and coins. The guiding principle of sleight-of- hand, articulated by legendary close-up magician Dai Vernon, is \\"be natural\\". A well-performed sleight looks like an ordinary, natural and completely innocent gesture, change in hand-position or body posture. It is commonly believed that sleight of hand works because ‚Äúthe hand is quicker than the eye‚Äù but this is usually not the case. In addition to manual dexterity, sleight of hand depends on the use of psychology, timing, misdirection, and natural choreography in accomplishing a magical effect. Misdirection is perhaps the most important component of the art of sleight of hand. The magician choreographs his actions so that all spectators are likely to look where he or she wants them to. More importantly, they do not look where the performer does not wish them to look. Two types of misdirection are timing and movement. Timing is simple: by allowing a small amount of time to pass after an action, events are skewed in the viewer's mind. Movement is a little more complicated. A phrase often used is \\"A larger action covers a smaller action\\". Care must be taken however to not make the larger action so big that it becomes suspicious. By media Propagandizing techniques of distraction are used in media manipulation. The idea is to encourage the public to focus on a topic or idea that the compliance professional feels is supportive of their cause. By focusing attention, a particular ideology can be made to seem the only reasonable choice. Oftentimes, media competition is the driving force for media bias, manipulation, and distraction. If a media company can find an audience with a united ideology, it then develops a loyal consumer base, as its consumers will be happy with the way media is presented. A so-called \\"conservative\\" media outlet would not hire a \\"liberal\\" reporter, as they would run the risk of alienating its viewership. Distraction is also important in studies of media multitasking, or the simultaneous use of multiple media at once. This behavior has emerged as increasingly common since the 1990s, especially among younger media users.. Wallis describes a survey by Donald F. Roberts and others for the Kaiser Family Foundation that found that multitasking children were able to view media for an average of 8.5 hours inside the 6.5 hours spent interacting with electronic media. Studies show that while humans are predisposed to the desire to multitask, most people struggle to have legitimate productivity while multitasking. Instead of giving a task full attention, the split attention that multitasking necessitates can cause one task to be a distraction to another. On the other hand, some studies show that multitasking has the potential for a high-risk high-reward situation, leading to the idea that success can arise from multitasking if one is good at the activity.

It is combined with an estrogen to make combination birth control pills. As an emergency birth control, sold under the brand name Plan B among others, it is useful within 120 hours of unprotected sex. The more time that has passed since sex, the less effective the medication becomes, and it does not work after pregnancy (implantation) has occurred. It decreases the chances of pregnancy by 57 to 93%. In an intrauterine device (IUD), such as Mirena among others, it is effective for the long-term prevention of pregnancy. A levonorgestrel-releasing implant is also available in some countries. Common side effects include nausea, breast tenderness, headaches, and increased, decreased, or irregular menstrual bleeding. When used as an emergency contraceptive, if pregnancy occurs, there is no evidence that its use harms the baby. It is safe to use during breastfeeding. Birth control that contains levonorgestrel will not change the risk of sexually transmitted infections. It is a progestin and has effects similar to those of the hormone progesterone. It works primarily by preventing ovulation and closing off the cervix to prevent the passage of sperm. Levonorgestrel was patented in 1960 and introduced for medical use together with ethinylestradiol in 1970. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system. It is available as a generic medication. In the United States, levonorgestrel-containing emergency contraceptives are available over the counter (OTC) for all ages. In 2016, it was the 223rd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than two million prescriptions. Medical uses=Birth control= At low doses, levonorgestrel is used in monophasic and triphasic formulations of combined oral contraceptive pills, with available monophasic doses ranging from 100 to 250 ¬µg, and triphasic doses of 50 ¬µg/75 ¬µg/125 ¬µg. It is combined with the estrogen ethinylestradiol in these formulations. At very low daily dose of 30 ¬µg, levonorgestrel is used in some progestogen-only pill formulations. Levonorgestrel is the active ingredient in a number of intrauterine devices including Mirena and Skyla. It is also the active ingredient in the birth control implants Norplant and Jadelle. One of the more common forms of contraception that contains only levonorgestral is an IUD. One IUD, the Mirena is a small hollow cylinder containing levonorgestral and polydimethylsiloxane and covered with a release rate controlling membrane. =Emergency birth control= Levonorgestrel is used in emergency contraceptive pills (ECPs), both in a combined Yuzpe regimen which includes estrogen, and as a levonorgestrel-only method. The levonorgestrel-only method uses levonorgestrel 1.5 mg (as a single dose or as two 0.75 mg doses 12 hours apart) taken within 3 days of unprotected sex, with one study indicating that beginning as late as 120 hours (5 days) after intercourse could be effective. The primary mechanism of action of levonorgestrel as a progestogen-only emergency contraceptive pill is, according to International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO), to prevent fertilization by inhibition of ovulation and thickening of cervical mucus. p. 121: > Mechanism of action > Copper-releasing IUCs > When used as a regular or emergency method of contraception, copper- > releasing IUCs act primarily to prevent fertilization.

In November 2013, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved a change to the label saying it cannot prevent implantation of a fertilized egg. Other studies still find the evidence to be unclear. While it is unlikely that emergency contraception affects implantation it is impossible to completely exclude the possibility of post-fertilization effect. In November 2013, the EMA also approved a change to the label for HRA Pharma's NorLevo saying: \\"In clinical trials, contraceptive efficacy was reduced in women weighing 75 kg [165 pounds] or more, and levonorgestrel was not effective in women who weighed more than 80 kg [176 pounds].\\" In November 2013 and January 2014, the FDA and the EMA said they were reviewing whether increased weight and body mass index (BMI) reduce the efficacy of emergency contraceptives. An analysis of four WHO randomised clinical trials, published in January 2017, showed pregnancy rates of 1.25% (68/5428) in women with BMI under 25, 0.61% (7/1140) in women with BMI between 25 and 30, and 2.03% (6/295) in women with BMI over 30. These values yield an eight-fold reduction in efficacy for women with BMI over 30 compared to women with BMI under 25. However, emergency contraceptives remain effective regardless of BMI. =Hormone therapy= Levonorgestrel is used in combination with an estrogen in menopausal hormone therapy. It is used under the brand name Klimonorm as a combined oral tablet with estradiol valerate and under the brand name Climara Pro as a combined transdermal patch with estradiol. =Available forms= As a type of emergency contraception, levonorgestrel is used after unprotected intercourse to reduce the risk of pregnancy. However, it can serve different hormonal purposes in its different methods of delivery. It is available for use in a variety of forms: By mouth Levonorgestrel can be taken by mouth as a form of emergency birth control. The typical dosage is either 1.5 mg taken once or 0.75 mg taken 12‚Äì24 hours apart. The effectiveness in both methods is similar. The most widely used form of oral emergency contraception is the progestin-only pill, which contains a 1.5 mg dosage of levonorgestrel. Levonorgestrel-only emergency contraceptive pills are reported to have an 89% effectiveness rate if taken within the recommended 72 hours after sex. The efficacy of the drug decreases by 50% for each 12 hour delay in taking the dose after the emergency contraceptive regimen has been started. Skin patch Estradiol with levonorgestrel in the form of a skin patch is used under the brand name Climara Pro for hormone replacement therapy in postmenstrual women, treating symptoms such as hot flashes or osteoporosis. The simultaneous delivery of a progestogen such as levonorgestrel is necessary for the protection of the endometrium. Intrauterine device The levonorgestrel intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) is a type of long-term birth control that releases the progestin into the uterine cavity. Levonorgestrel is released at a constant, gradual rate of 0.02 mg per day by the polydimethylsiloxane membrane of the device, which renders it effective for up to 5 years. Because it is inserted directly into the uterus, levonorgestrel is present in the endometrium in much higher concentrations that would result from a LNG-containing oral pill; the LNG-IUS delivers 391 ng of levonorgestrel to the inner uterine region while a comparable oral contraceptive delivers only 1.35 ng. This high level of levonorgestrel impedes the function of the endometrium, making it hostile for sperm transport, fertilization, and implantation of an ovum. Implant Subcutaneous implants of levonorgestrel have been marketed as birth control implants under the brand names Norplant and Jadelle and are available for use in some countries. Contraindications Known or suspected pregnancy is a contraindication of levonorgestrel as an emergency contraceptive. Side effects After an intake of 1.5 mg levonorgestrel in clinical trials, very common side effects (reported by 10% or more) included: hives, dizziness, hair-loss,headache, nausea, abdominal pain, uterine pain, delayed menstruation, heavy menstruation, uterine bleeding, and fatigue; common side effects (reported by 1% to 10%) included diarrhea, vomiting, and painful menstruation; these side effects usually disappeared within 48 hours. However, the long term side effects common with oral contraceptives such as arterial disease are lower with levonorgestrel than in combination pills. Levonorgestrel as a contraceptive intrauterine device is associated with a higher risk of breast cancer than with non-use. Overdose Overdose of levonorgestrel as an emergency contraceptive has not been described.https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2009/021998lbl.pdf Nausea and vomiting might be expected.  Interactions  If taken together with drugs that induce the CYP3A4 cytochrome P450 liver enzyme, levonorgestrel may be metabolized faster and may have lower effectiveness. These include, but are not limited to barbiturates, bosentan, carbamazepine, felbamate, griseofulvin, oxcarbazepine, phenytoin, rifampin, St. John's wort and topiramate. Pharmacology Levonorgestrel (LNG) is a progestin and has effects similar to those of the hormone progesterone. It works primarily by preventing ovulation and closing off the cervix to prevent the passage of sperm. =Pharmacodynamics= Levonorgestrel is a progestogen; that is, an agonist of the progesterone receptor (PR), the main biological target of the progestogen sex hormone progesterone. It is also a weak agonist of the androgen receptor (AR), the main biological target of the androgen sex hormone testosterone. Levonorgestrel has no other important hormonal activity, including no estrogenic, glucocorticoid, or antimineralocorticoid activity. The lack of significant mineralocorticoid or antimineralocorticoid activity with levonorgestrel is in spite of a relatively high affinity for the mineralocorticoid receptor of as much as 75% of that of aldosterone. Due to its progestogenic activity, levonorgestrel has antigonadotropic effects, and is able to suppress fertility and gonadal sex hormone production in both women and men. Androgenic activity Levonorgestrel is a weakly androgenic progestin and in women may cause androgenic side effects such as decreased sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels, decreased cholesterol levels, weight gain, and acne. In combination with a potent estrogen like ethinylestradiol however, all contraceptives containing androgenic progestins are negligibly androgenic in clinical practice and can in fact be used to treat androgen- dependent conditions like acne and hirsutism in women. This is because ethinylestradiol causes a marked increase in SHBG levels and thereby decreases levels of free and hence bioactive testosterone, acting as a functional antiandrogen. Nonetheless, contraceptives containing progestins that are less androgenic increase SHBG levels to a greater relative extent and may be more effective for such indications. Levonorgestrel is currently the most androgenic progestin that remains used in contraceptives, and contraceptives containing levonorgestrel may be less effective for androgen-dependent conditions relative to those containing other progestins that are less androgenic. Other activity Levonorgestrel stimulates the proliferation of MCF-7 breast cancer cells in vitro, an action that is independent of the classical PRs and is instead mediated via the progesterone receptor membrane component-1 (PGRMC1). Certain other progestins act similarly in this assay, whereas progesterone acts neutrally. It is unclear if these findings may explain the different risks of breast cancer observed with progesterone and progestins in clinical studies. Antigonadotropic effects In men, levonorgestrel causes marked suppression of circulating testosterone levels secondary to its antigonadotropic effects. Because of this, and due to its androgenic activity being only weak and hence insufficient for purposes of androgen replacement in males, levonorgestrel has potent functional antiandrogenic effects in men, and is able to produce associated adverse effects like decreased libido and erectile dysfunction among others. In relation to this, levonorgestrel has been combined with an androgen like testosterone or dihydrotestosterone when it has been studied as a hormonal contraceptive in men. =Pharmacokinetics= The bioavailability of levonorgestrel is approximately 95% (range 85 to 100%). The plasma protein binding of levonorgestrel is about 98%. It is bound 50% to albumin and 48% to SHBG. Levonorgestrel is metabolized in the liver, via reduction, hydroxylation, and conjugation (specifically glucuronidation and sulfation). Oxidation occurs primarily at the C2Œ± and C16Œ≤ positions, while reduction occurs in the A ring. 5Œ±-Dihydrolevonorgestrel is produced as an active metabolite of levonorgestrel by 5Œ±-reductase. The elimination half-life of levonorgestrel is 24 to 32 hours, although values as short as 8 hours and as great as 45 hours have been reported. About 20 to 67% of a single oral dose of levonorgestrel is eliminated in urine and 21 to 34% in feces. Chemistry Levonorgestrel, also known as 17Œ±-ethynyl-18-methyl-19-nortestosterone or as 17Œ±-ethynyl-18-methylestr-4-en-17Œ≤-ol-3-one, is a synthetic estrane steroid and a derivative of testosterone. It is the C13Œ≤ or levorotatory stereoisomer and enantiopure form of norgestrel, the C13Œ± or dextrorotatory isomer being inactive. Levonorgestrel is more specifically a derivative of norethisterone (17Œ±-ethynyl-19-nortestosterone) and is the parent compound of the gonane (18-methylestrane) subgroup of the 19-nortestosterone family of progestins. Levonorgestrel acetate and levonorgestrel butanoate are C17Œ≤ esters of levonorgestrel. It has a molecular weight of 312.45 g/mol and a partition coefficient (logP) of 3.8. History Norgestrel (rac-13-ethyl-17Œ±-ethynyl-19-nortestosterone), the racemic mixture containing levonorgestrel and dextronorgestrel, was discovered by Hughes and colleagues at Wyeth in 1963 via structural modification of norethisterone (17Œ±-ethynyl-19-nortestosterone). It was the first progestogen to be manufactured via total chemical synthesis. Norgestrel was introduced for medical use as a combined birth control pill with ethinylestradiol under the brand name Eugynon in Germany in 1966 and under the brand name Ovral in the United States 1968, and as a progestogen-only pill under the brand name Ovrette in the United States in 1973. Following its discovery, norgestrel had been licensed by Wyeth to Schering AG, which separated the racemic mixture into its two optical isomers and identified levonorgestrel (13Œ≤-ethyl-17Œ±-ethynyl-19-nortestosterone) as the active component of the mixture. Levonorgestrel was first studied in humans by 1970, and was introduced for medical use in Germany as a combined birth control pill with ethinylestradiol under the brand name Neogynon in August 1970. A more widely used formulation, containing lower doses of ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel, was introduced under the brand name Microgynon by 1973. In addition to combined formulations, levonorgestrel was introduced as a progestogen-only pill under the brand names Microlut by 1972 and Microval by 1974.Scharff, H. J. (1972). Clinical experience with Microlut. Medical News Schering No. 1 1972. p. 2-9. https://www.popline.org/node/488633 Many other formulations and brand names of levonorgestrel-containing birth control pills have also been marketed. Levonorgestrel, taken alone in a single high dose, was first evaluated as a form of emergency contraception in 1973. It was the second progestin to be evaluated for such purposes, following a study of quingestanol acetate in 1970. In 1974, the Yuzpe regimen, which consisted of high doses of a combined birth control pill containing ethinylestradiol and norgestrel, was described as a method of emergency contraception by A. Albert Yuzpe and colleagues, and saw widespread interest. Levonorgestrel-only emergency contraception was introduced under the brand name Postinor by 1978.Farkas, M. (1978). Post-coital contraception with Postinor, a preparation containing 0.75 mg d-norgestrel. Magyar N√∂orvosok Lapja, 41, 474. https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=8190066278284376785 Ho and Kwan published the first study comparing levonorgestrel only and the Yuzpe regimen as methods of emergency contraception in 1993 and found that they had similar effectiveness but that levonorgestrel alone was better-tolerated. In relation to this, the Yuzpe regimen has largely been replaced as a method of emergency contraception by levonorgrestrel-only preparations. Levonorgestrel-only emergency contraception was approved in the United States under the brand name Plan B in 1999, and has also been marketed widely elsewhere throughout the world under other brand names such as Levonelle and NorLevo in addition to Postinor. In 2013, the Food and Drug Administration approved Plan B One-Step for sale over-the-counter in the United States without a prescription or age restriction. Levonorgestrel has also been introduced for use as a progestogen- only intrauterine device under the brand names Mirena and Skyla among others, as a progestogen-only birth control implant under the brand names Norplant and Jadelle, as a combined oral tablet with estradiol valerate for menopausal hormone therapy under the brand name Klimonorm, and as a combined transdermal patch with estradiol for menopausal hormone therapy under the brand name Climara Pro. Ester prodrugs of levonorgestrel such as levonorgestrel acetate and levonorgestrel butanoate have been developed and studied as other forms of birth control such as long-acting progestogen-only injectable contraceptives and contraceptive vaginal rings, but have not been marketed for medical use.

Works councils exist with different names in a variety of related forms in a number of European countries, including Britain (joint consultative committee or employees‚Äô council); Germany and Austria (Betriebsrat); Luxembourg (comit√© mixte, d√©l√©gation du personnel); the Netherlands (Dienstcommissie, Ondernemingsraad) and Flanders in Belgium (ondernemingsraad); Italy (comitato aziendale); France (comit√© social et √©conomique); Wallonia in Belgium (conseil d'entreprise), Spain (comit√© de empresa) and Denmark (Samarbejdsudvalg or SU). One of the most commonly examined (and arguably most successful) implementations of this institution is found in Germany. The model is basically as follows: general labour agreements are made at the national level by national unions (e.g. IG Metall) and national employer associations (e.g. Gesamtmetall), and local plants and firms then meet with works councils to adjust these national agreements to local circumstances. Works council members are elected by the company workforce for a four-year term. They don't have to be union members; works councils can also be formed in companies where neither the employer nor the employees are organized. Works council representatives may also be appointed to the board of directors. As with co-determination, there are three main views about why works councils primarily exist: to reduce workplace conflict by improving and systematising communication channels; to increase bargaining power of workers at the expense of owners by means of legislation; and to correct market failures by means of public policy.  Europe  On 22 September 1994, the Council of the European Union passed a Directive (94/45/EC) on the establishment of a European Works Council (EWC) or similar procedure for the purposes of informing and consulting employees in companies which operate at European Union level. The EWC Directive applies to companies with at least 1,000 employees within the EU and at least 150 employees in each of at least two Member States. European Works Councils were created partly as a response to increased transnational restructuring brought about by the Single European Act. They give representatives of workers from all European countries in big multinational companies a direct line of communication to top management. They also make sure that workers in different countries are all told the same thing at the same time about transnational policies and plans. Lastly, they give workers‚Äô representatives in unions and national works councils the opportunity to consult with each other and to develop a common European response to employers‚Äô transnational plans, which management must then consider before those plans are implemented. The EWC Directive was revised by the Council and the European Parliament in May 2009. The changes contained in the new (\\"Recast\\") Directive must be transposed into national law by 5 June 2011, and have important implications for all companies in scope of the legislation, both those with an existing European Works Council and those yet to have set one up. =France= A comit√© d‚Äôentreprise (C.E. or works council) was mandatory in any company with 50 employees or more. It is being replaced by the \\"Comit√© Social et Economique\\" (CSE or Business and Social Council) which must have been rolled out in all companies where applicable for 1 January 2020 the latest. Members of the CE are elected by all the employees, and have 20 hours of delegation per month. The main role of the CE or the CSE is being the interface between the employees and the members of the board which is constituted of the Chairman and the HR Director, mostly for collective issues, such as work organisation, training policy, benefits. Its consultation is compulsory in case of certain economic events, such as any company strategic moves, The number of members depends of the number of people in the company. All members of the CE or CSE have a monthly meeting with the board, in which very specific points are dealt with. = Germany = Works councils () in Germany have a long history, with their origins in the early 1920s in the post World War I Weimar Republic, established by the Betriebsverfassungsgesetz or Works Constitution Act. Initially, unions were very skeptical of works councils, seeing them as a way for management to negotiate with employees without employing collective bargaining, but eventually they developed clearly defined responsibilities with works councils not allowed to organize strikes or enforce a wage increase. In recent years with a decline in union membership, works councils have come to be seen as a way for unions to recruit members, specifically by having works councils campaign for people to join them. Having a works council is formally mandatory, but there is no enforcement as long as the employees do not explicitly ask for an election of one; and their presence differs by economic sector. In 2019, depending on sector, between 16% and 86% of employees worked at an employer with a works council. While membership in a trade union is not explicitly required, according to Hans B√∂ckler Stiftung analysis of year 2014 Works Council elections, depending on sector; between 60 to 80% of Works Councillors elected were members of one unions in the German Trade Union Confederation. In Germany, they serve two functions. The first is called co-determination, through which works councils elect members of the board of directors of German companies. The second is called participation, and means that works councils must be consulted about specific issues and have the right to make proposals to management. One of the most impressive achievements of the councils is producing incredibly harmonious relations between management and workers, leading to a situation with strong unions and an incredibly low strike rate. This also allows for a lot of coordination between the firm and the workers, resulting in, for example, the ability of many German firms to dramatically scale back the hours of each worker without large scale layoffs during the 2008 financial crisis, and then slowly scaling back up as the recovery took effect. This was all assisted by the Kurzarbeit (short time work), a fund that helps workers who have had their hours reduced. Works councils in Germany have been correlated with a number of positive effects. They promote higher wages, even more than collective bargaining (although situations with both will promote wages the highest), they make firms more productive (although the degree to which they increase productivity can be hard to measure). and they don‚Äôt inhibit investment or innovation. Works councils have also been shown to help women, East German, and foreign workers. However, they are correlated lower profitability, likely since they tend to bring higher wages, and there may not be as much benefit in smaller companies as there is in larger ones. Obstruction of the Works Council is a punishable offence.

Mount Aniakchak () is a 3,700-year-old volcanic caldera approximately in diameter, located in the Aleutian Range of Alaska, United States. Although a stratovolcano by composition, the pre-existing mountain collapsed in a major eruption forming the caldera. The area around the volcano is the Aniakchak National Monument and Preserve, maintained by the National Park Service. In November 1967, Aniakchak Caldera was designated as a National Natural Landmark by the National Park Service. Geological history Mount Aniakchak was previously a glacially eroded stratovolcano of andestic composition, with a pre-caldera volume of . Andesitic material in the volcano included basalt and dacite. The mountain collapsed, forming the present day caldera, during a major eruption of VEI=6, which left evidence in ice cores dated to 1645 BC. which was later moved to 1641 BC in the Greenland Ice Core Chronology 2005 (GICC05) time scale. Recently, McAneney and Baillie have suggested that the GICC05 ice core dates in the 17th century BC may be around 14 years too old, meaning that Aniakchak actually erupted in 1628 or 1627 BC. Since then, more than 20 eruptions have occurred from vents on the caldera floor. Vent Mountain has been the source of numerous eruptions of ash, bombs, and lava flows since the caldera formed. From 1500 BC to AD 1000 four lava domes were extruded on the caldera floor. Textural evidence shows that these lava-dome eruptions occurred beneath Ancient Surprise Lake which was as deep as 100m. Ancient Surprise Lake drained catastrophically before about AD 1000. (Surprise Lake (Aniakchak's crater lake) is now about 2.75 km2 (680 acres) in area and up to 19.5 m (64.0 ft) deep.) Before or immediately after this draining, explosive eruptions of andesitic magma produced a cluster of three tuff cones in the southeast part of the caldera. Around AD 1500, during one of the most violent events in recent history at Aniakchak, an estimated 0.75 to 1.0 km3 of material destroyed a preexisting edifice at Half Cone and flooded most of the caldera floor with pyroclastic flows, surges, and fallout many meters thick. During the final phase of this eruption, a lava flow filled the basin formed during the collapse of Half Cone. Several more recent prehistoric eruptions occurred in the summit crater and along the south flank of Vent Mountain producing a field of blocky dacite lava flows against the south wall of the caldera. Minor eruptions immediately west and east of Vent Mountain produced a small scoria cone (Blocky Cone) and two maar craters (now water- filled) along the base of the southeast caldera wall. European-descended geologists discovered the volcano in 1922. The volcano's only eruption in modern recorded history occurred in 1931. The Jesuit \\"Glacier Priest\\", Father Bernard Hubbard, made record of it: \\"A small but impressive explosion pit was added to the pockmarked caldera floor that year. Many thousands of tons of ash lay strewn within the caldera and scattered up to 40 miles away over the small villages\\".\\"Aniakchak National Monument & Preserve\\", pulled from chranger.com, 3 June 2011.  Human history  The caldera-forming eruptions of ~3,700 years ago had a significant effect on the regional landscape, and on the entire range of plant and animal life over a broad area. Indeed, the eruption has been implicated in widespread impacts on human populations across the whole of western Alaska. In the immediate vicinity of the volcano, the effects were so severe that people did not return to the region for another 2,000 years. Some scholars speculate that this eruption (and the subsequent devastation) may have segregated people to the north and south of the volcano for long enough to drive the divergence between Aleutian and Eskimoan languages.

The European earwig survives in a variety of environments and is a common household insect in North America. The name earwig comes from the appearance of the hindwings, which are unique and distinctive among insects, and resemble a human ear when unfolded; the species name of the common earwig, auricularia, is a specific reference to this feature. They are considered a household pest because of their tendency to invade crevices in homes and consume pantry foodstuffs, and may act either as a pest or as a beneficial species depending on the circumstances (see below). Forficula auricularia is reddish brown in color, with a flattened and elongate body, and slender, beaded antennae. An obvious feature of earwigs is the pair of 'pincers' or forceps at the tip of the flexible abdomen. Both sexes have these pincers; in males they are large and very curved, whereas in females they are straight. Nymphs are similar to adults in appearance, but their wings are either absent or small Morphology Forficula auricularia has an elongated flattened brownish colored body, with a shield-shaped pronotum, two pairs of wings and a pair of forcep-like cerci. They are about 12‚Äì15 mm long. The second tarsal segment is lobed, extending distally below the third tarsal segment. The antenna consists of 11‚Äì14 segments, and the mouth parts are of the chewing type. Adult males are polymorphic in body weight and head width, as well as cercus length and width. The male forceps are very robust and broadened basally with crenulate teeth. The female forceps are about 3 mm long, and are less robust and straighter. The cerci are used during mating, feeding, and self-defense. Females also have tegmina of about 2 mm in length. Third instar or older nymphs that have lost one branch of cerci are capable of regenerating it in form of a straight structure. Males with asymmetrical forceps are called gynandromorphs or hermaphrodites because they resemble females. Distribution Native to Europe, western Asia and probably North Africa, Forficula auricularia was introduced to North America in the early twentieth century and is currently spread throughout much of the continent. In North America, European earwigs comprise two sibling species, which are reproductively isolated.Wirth T., et al. (1998). Molecular and reproductive characterization of sibling species in the European earwig (Forficula auricularia). Evolution 52(1) 260‚Äì65. Populations in cold continental climates mostly have one clutch per year, forming species A, whereas those in warmer climates have two clutches per year, forming species B. European earwigs are most commonly found in temperate climates, since they were originally discovered in the Palearctic region, and are most active when the daily temperature has minimal fluctuation.Capinera, J. 2001. Handbook of Vegetable Pests. Academic Press, San Diego, CA. Behavior European earwigs spend the day time in cool, dark, inaccessible places such as flowers, fruits, and wood crevices. Active primarily at night, they seek out food ranging from plant matter to small insects. Though they are omnivorous, they are considered as scavengers rather than predators. Often they consume plant matter, though they have also been known to feed on aphids, spiders, insect eggs, and dead plants and insects, among other things. Their favorite plants include the common crucifer Sisymbrium officinale, the white clover Trifolium repens, and the dahlia Dahlia variabilis. They also like to feed on molasses, as well as on nonvascular plants, lichens and algae. They prefer meat or sugar to natural plant material even though plants are a major natural food source. European earwigs prefer aphids to plant material such as leaves and fruit slices of apple, cherry and pear. Adults eat more insects than do nymphs. Although F. auricularia have well-developed wings, they are fairly weak and are rarely, if ever, used. Instead, as their main form of transportation, earwigs are carried from one place to another on clothing or commercial products like lumber, ornamental shrubs and even newspaper bundles. Reproduction A male finds prospective mates by olfaction. He then slips his cerci under the tip of the female's abdomen so that his and her ventral abdominal surfaces are in contact with each other, while both face in opposite directions. If not disturbed, pairs can stay in this mating position for many hours. Matings occurred frequently among clustered individuals particularly in locations that allow both partners to cling to a surface. Under laboratory conditions, the mating season peaked during August and September, and a single mating event enabled females to lay fertilized eggs. European earwig nymphs look very similar to their adult counterparts except that they are a lighter color. The young go through four nymphal stages and do not leave the nest until after the first moult. European earwigs overwinter about 5 mm below the surface of the ground. The female earwig lays a clutch of about 50 eggs in an underground nest in the autumn. She enters a dormant state and stays in the nest with the eggs. The female cares for her young by shifting the eggs about and cleaning them to avoid fungal growth. In the spring, she spreads them out into a single layer and the young emerge from the eggs. She guards them until they reach maturity after about one month. It is possible for the female to lay a second brood in one season and by the end of August all of the young reach maturity. Habitat Female European earwigs survive well in cool, moist habitats and have an optimum mean growth temperature of . Their daily abundance in a given year has been linked to factors such as temperature, wind velocity and the prevalence of easterly winds. The development of European earwigs also depends on temperature. Thus, the occurrence of European earwigs can be predicted based on weather parameters. Hibernating adults can tolerate cool temperatures, but their survival is reduced in poorly drained soils such as clay. To avoid excessive moisture, they seek the southern side of well-drained slopes. Sometimes they also occupy the hollow stems of flowers where the soil is poorly drained. Their eggs are capable of resisting damage from cold and heat. Agricultural impact Forficula auricularia has been known to cause significant damage to crops, flowers, and fruit orchards when at high population levels. Some of the commercially valuable vegetables it feeds upon include cabbage, cauliflower, chard, celery, lettuce, potato, beet, and cucumber among others. Earwigs readily consume corn (maize) silk and can damage the crop. Among fruits, they have been found to damage apple and pear orchards. They damage young plum and peach trees in early spring, when other food is scarce, by devouring blossoms and leaves at night. It is not uncommon to find them wedged among petals of fresh cut carnations, roses, dahlia and zinnia. In addition to all of the agricultural problems caused, humans are not very fond of F. auricularia because of its foul odor and annoying propensity to aggregate together in or near human dwellings. Control of F. auricularia has been attempted using some of its natural enemies, including the parasitoid fly Bigonicheta spinipenni, the fungi Erynia forficulae and Metarhizium anisopliae, as well as many species of birds. The tachinid flies Triarthria setipennis (Fallen) and Ocytata pallipes have been introduced in North America to control F. auricularia in the 1920s.Bugguide.net. Species Forficula auricularia - European Earwig Insecticides have also been successfully implemented, although commercial products are rarely targeted specifically towards earwigs. Multipurpose insecticides for control of earwigs, grasshoppers, sowbugs and other insects are more common. Diazinon, an organophosphate insecticide, has been known to continue killing F. auricularia up to 17 days after initial spraying. Humans have, however, found beneficial uses of F. auricularia in the pest management of other insects. The European earwig is a natural predator of a number of other agricultural pests, including the pear psyllid and several aphid species, and in this regard has been used to control outbreaks of such organisms. Damage to crops by F. auricularia is limited as long as there are high population levels of their insect prey.Vickery, V. and D. Kevan. 1986. The Insects and Arachnids of Canada, Part 14.

In 1965 he conceived of packet switching, which is today the dominant basis for data communications in computer networks worldwide. Davies proposed a commercial national network in the United Kingdom and designed and built the local-area NPL network to demonstrate the technology. Many of the wide-area packet-switched networks built in the 1970s were similar \\"in nearly all respects\\" to his original 1965 design. This was independent of the work of Paul Baran in the United States who had a similar idea in the early 1960s. The ARPANET project credited Davies for his influence, which was key to the development of the Internet.\\"Pioneer: Donald Davies\\", Internet Hall of Fame \\"America‚Äôs Advanced Research Project Agency (ARPA), and the ARPANET received his network design enthusiastically and the NPL local network became the first two computer networks in the world using the technique.\\" \\"The advances by Donald Davies, by Paul Baran, and by Vint Cerf, Bob Khan and colleagues had already happened in the 1970s, but were only just becoming pervasive.\\" Early life Davies was born in Treorchy in the Rhondda Valley, Wales. His father, a clerk at a coalmine, died a few months later, and his mother took Donald and his twin sister back to her home town of Portsmouth, where he went to school.The History of Computing Project ‚Äì Donald Davies Biography He attended the Southern Grammar School for Boys. He received a BSc degree in physics (1943) at Imperial College London, and then joined the war effort working as an assistant to Klaus Fuchs on the nuclear weapons Tube Alloys project at Birmingham University. He then returned to Imperial taking a first class degree in mathematics (1947); he was also awarded the Lubbock memorial Prize as the outstanding mathematician of his year. In 1955, he married Diane Burton; they had a daughter and two sons. Career history=National Physical Laboratory= From 1947, he worked at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) where Alan Turing was designing the Automatic Computing Engine (ACE) computer. It is said that Davies spotted mistakes in Turing's seminal 1936 paper On Computable Numbers, much to Turing's annoyance. These were perhaps some of the first \\"programming\\" bugs in existence, even if they were for a theoretical computer, the universal Turing machine. The ACE project was overambitious and floundered, leading to Turing's departure. Davies took over the project and concentrated on delivering the less ambitious Pilot ACE computer, which first worked in May 1950. A commercial spin-off, DEUCE was manufactured by English Electric Computers and became one of the best-selling machines of the 1950s. Davies also worked on applications of traffic simulation and machine translation. In the early 1960s, he worked on government technology initiatives designed to stimulate the British computer industry. =Packet switching= In 1965, Davies developed the idea of packet switching, dividing computer messages into packets that are routed independently across a network, possibly via differing routes, and are reassembled at the destination. Unbeknown to him, Paul Baran of the RAND Corporation in the United States was also working on a similar concept; when Baran became aware of Davies's work he acknowledged that they both had equally discovered the concept. Davies used the word \\"packets\\" after consulting with a linguist because it was capable of being translated into languages other than English without compromise. Davies' key insight came in the realisation that computer network traffic was inherently \\"bursty\\" with periods of silence, compared with relatively constant telephone traffic. He designed and proposed a commercial national data network based on packet switching in his 1966 Proposal for the Development of a National Communications Service for On-line Data Processing. In 1966 he returned to the NPL at Teddington just outside London, where he headed and transformed its computing activity. He became interested in data communications following a visit to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he saw that a significant problem with the new time-sharing computer systems was the cost of keeping a phone connection open for each user. Davies was the first to describe the concept of an \\"Interface computer\\", in 1966, today known as a router. He and his team were one of the first to use the term 'protocol' in a data-commutation context in 1967. The NPL team also carried out simulation work on packet networks, including datagram networks. His work on packet switching, presented by his colleague Roger Scantlebury, initially caught the attention of the developers of ARPANET, a US defence network, at the Symposium on Operating Systems Principles in October 1967. In Scantlebury's report following the conference, he noted \\"It would appear that the ideas in the NPL paper at the moment are more advanced than any proposed in the USA\\". Larry Roberts of the Advanced Research Projects Agency in the United States applied Davies' concepts of packet switching in the late 1960s for the ARPANET, which went on to become a predecessor to the Internet. These early years of computer resource sharing were documented in the 1972 film Computer Networks: The Heralds of Resource Sharing. Davies first presented his own ideas on packet switching at a conference in Edinburgh on 5 August 1968.Luke Collins, \\"Network pioneer remembered\\", Engineering & Technology, IET, 6 September 2008 At NPL Davies helped build a packet-switched network (Mark I NPL network). It was replaced with the Mark II in 1973, and remained in operation until 1986, influencing other research in the UK and Europe, including Louis Pouzin's CYCLADES project in France.Packet Switching Baran was happy to acknowledge that Davies had come up with the same idea as him independently. In an e-mail to Davies he wrote Leonard Kleinrock, a contemporary working on analysing message flow using queueing theory, developed a theoretical basis for the operation of message switching networks in his PhD thesis during 1961-2, published as a book in 1964. However, Kleinrock's later claim to have developed the theoretical basis of packet switching networks is disputed, \\"...there is nothing in the entire 1964 book that suggests, analyzes, or alludes to the idea of packetization.\\" including Robert Taylor, Baran and Davies. Davies and Baran are recognized by historians and the U.S. National Inventors Hall of Fame for independently inventing the concept of digital packet switching used in modern computer networking including the Internet.; Davies, along with his deputy Derek Barber, and Roger Scantlebury, participated in the International Networking Working Group from 1972, initially chaired by Vint Cerf. He was acknowledged by Bob Kahn and Cerf in their 1974 paper on internetworking, \\"A Protocol for Packet Network Intercommunication\\". Davies and Barber published reference books on \\"communication networks for computers\\" in 1973 and \\"computer networks and their protocols\\" in 1979. They spoke at the Data Communications Symposium in 1975 about the \\"battle for access standards\\" between datagrams and virtual circuits, with Barber saying the \\"lack of standard access interfaces for emerging public packet-switched communication networks is creating 'some kind of monster' for users\\". For a long period of time, the network engineering community was polarized over the implementation of competing protocol suites, commonly known as the Protocol Wars. It was unclear which type of protocol would result in the best and most robust computer networks. Research at NPL under Davies confirmed establishing a common host protocol would be more reliable and efficient than translating between different host protocols using a gateway. =Later work= Davies relinquished his management responsibilities in 1979 to return to research. He became particularly interested in computer network security. He retired from NPL in 1984, becoming a leading consultant on data security to the banking industry. Together with David O. Clayden, they designed the Message Authenticator Algorithm (MAA), an early Message Authentication Code that was adopted as international standard ISO 8731-2 in 1987. In 1987, he became a visiting professor at Royal Holloway and Bedford New College. Awards and honours After receiving the John Player Award from the British Computer Society (BCS) in 1974, he was awarded a medal by the John von Neumann Computer Society in Hungary in 1985. Davies was appointed a Distinguished Fellow of the BCS in 1975 and was made a CBE in 1983, and later a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1987. In 2000, Davies shared the inaugural IEEE Internet Award. In 2007, Davies was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame, and in 2012 he was inducted into the Internet Hall of Fame by the Internet Society. NPL sponsors a gallery, opened in 2009, about the development of packet switching and \\"Technology of the Internet\\" at The National Museum of Computing. A blue plaque commemorating Davies was unveiled in Treorchy in July 2013.  Family  Davies was survived by his wife Diane, a daughter and two sons.

Before 1830, when Edwin Beard Budding of Thrupp, near Stroud, invented the lawnmower, lawns were often kept cropped by grazing sheep on them. The world's oldest surviving bowling green is the Southampton Old Bowling Green, which was first used in 1299. When the French adopted \\"boulingrin\\" in the 17th century, it was understood to mean a sunk geometrically shaped piece of perfect grass, framed in gravel walks, which often formed the centre of a regularly planted wood called a bosquet, somewhat like a highly formalized glade; it might have a central pool or fountain. The diarist Samuel Pepys relates a conversation he had with the architect Hugh May: Dimensions and other specifications Bowling green specifications for the lawn bowls variation of the sport are stipulated in World Bowls' Laws of the Sport of Bowls. For the variant known as crown green bowls, no such stipulation is documented by the national governing body and bowls clubs are free to form the dimensions and other specifications as they feel fit. Generally a \\"crown green\\" has just that: a crown or raised centre section with the outer edges of the green dropping off towards the surrounding ditch. Other greens are generally as level as possible. Several games of bowls can be played on a bowling green at the same time. The number of games depends on the dimensions of the green. Each game is played on its own portion of the green. These divided portions of the green are called rinks. The length of a green in the direction of play will be between 31 metres and 40 metres. The green should have a suitable level playing surface made of grass or of an approved synthetic material. The green is surrounded by a ditch between 200 millimetres and 380 millimetres wide, and between 50 millimetres and 200 millimetres deep. The ditch has a bank against its outer edge. The top of the bank should be at least 230 millimetres about the surface level of the green. Generally, greens are built in a square shape as close to 40 metres as possible. This allows for games to be played in either direction. The advantages of playing in different directions are that: the wear on the green is more even, and; the players do not need to face towards the sun when playing. In cities, where outdoor space is limited, greens are rarely 40 metres in length (they are generally still square, however). It is not unusual to find greens that are rectangular in shape. On rectangular greens games are played in one direction only. The length of a rectangular green is still between 31 metres and 40 metres. The width can vary from as little as 8 metres (enough for one rink) to as much as 60 metres or more. The width of a rink for outdoor play will be between 4.3 metres and 5.8 metres (for indoor play the minimum width of a rink is 4.6 metres). The centre line of the rink can be marked along the surface of the green starting at 2 metres from each end ditch. The side boundaries of each rink are shown by boundary pegs. The side boundary of the outside rink (also called a ditch rink) should be at least 600 millimetres from the side ditch (460 millimetres for indoor greens).

In 2013, the parish merged into the new parish Camarate, Unhos e Apela√ß√£o. With a population of 23,000 inhabitants in 2001, the parish of Camarate extends into an area of 5.52 km¬≤. History The pillory marking the municipal history of Camarate, in the Largo da Igreja The probable origin of the local place name came from the historical cultivation of vineyards with a caste of grape called Camarate. A Matriz Church was founded by the Bishop of Lisbon, Agapito Colona, in the 14th century, and later amplified and expanded. During the Portuguese Interregnum, the estate of Camarate, then property of the Jew David Negro, administrator of the Royal Customhouses of King Ferdinand I of Le√≥n and Castile, was confiscated and delivered into the hands of Nuno √Ålvares Pereira, who lived there with his mother until joining the Carmelite Order. While there, the knight founded and consecrated a chapel to Nossa Senhora do Socorro, which he later offered, along with the estate, to the Carmelites, who founded a convent on the site. Much later, under Nuno √Ålvares Pereira stewardship, Camarate would be integrated (along with other neighbouring lands) into the patrimony of the House of Braganza. The parish of Camarate separated from the administration of Sacav√©m across a foral issued by King Manuel I of Portugal, dated 1 May 1511. After the 17th century, the region became a place of leisure sought after by the Lisboeta nobility. The region was famous for its agricultural, characterized by estates that supported the fiscal production of the parish until the 20th century. It was part of Lisbon (until 1852), then Santa Maria dos Olivais (between 1852 and 1886). Later, it was re-annexed to Lisbon between 1886 and 1895, before being integrated into the municipality of Loures. On 4 June 1996, the community was elevated to the status of vila () by decree of the Assembly of the Republic. After the 20th century, and owing to industrial development in the neighbouring parishes, the parish experienced a growth in population, accompanied by a comparable growth in illegal construction. Camarate became infamous for the aircraft accident that befell Portuguese Social Democratic Prime Minister Francisco S√° Carneiro, his wife, and the Christian Democratic Defense Minister Adelino Amaro da Costa, on the evening of 4 December 1980. A few hours before the presidential elections, the aircraft was en route to Porto, when it crashed in the parish. Geography Situated in north of Lisbon, Camarate is a civil parish located in the eastern part of the municipality of Loure. It is fronted in the northwest by the Lourense parishes of Frielas and Unhos, southeast by Prior Velho and east by Sacav√©m; in the extreme southeast it borders Santa Maria dos Olivais, in the south Charneca (both parishes of Lisbon); and, finally southwest, with the Olival Basto in the municipality of Odivelas. Part of this configuration means that a portion of the International Airport of Lisbon lies within the borders of the parish. The civil parish includes several bairros (neighborhoods), including the bairro of Angola, Boavista, Bogalheira, CAR, Esperan√ßa, Fetais de Baixo, Fetais de Cima, Fonta√≠nhas, Grilo, Loureiras, Mira-Loures, Santiago, Santo Ant√≥nio, S√£o Benedito, S√£o Francisco, dS√£o Jo√£o, S√£o Jos√©, S√£o Louren√ßo, Sousas, Torre, Fonte da Pipa, Mucharros, Quinta de Marvila, Quinta do Para√≠so, Quinta de Santa Rosa, Quinta do Gale√£o, in addition to the centre of the vila (). Economy It was well known for its local wine, produced in the fertile farms that characterized the parish until the mid-twentieth century. Since then, industrialization has transformed it into an urbanized town.

Over time the building deteriorated to the point that, in 1511, a new church was reconstructed on the same site, at the same time that Camarate became an independent ecclesiastical parish. A similar reconstruction/remodelling occurred at the beginning of the 17th century.

He is known for his books about Napoleon's invasion of Russia and on the Crimean War, and many other works. Yevgeny Tarle was one of the founders of the Moscow State Institute of International Relations, Russia's diplomatic university.  Life  Born as Grigory Tarle in Kiev, Russian Empire (modern-day Ukraine) into a prosperous Jewish family, he adopted the name of Yevgeny in 1893 following his baptism to Orthodox Christianity in Saint Sophia's Cathedral in order to marry Olga Grigorievna Mikhailova who belonged to Russian nobility. His father Viktor Grigorievich Tarle came from merchantry social estate and ran a shop in Kiev; he also translated books from Russian to German, including Fyodor Dostoyevsky's works. Yevgeny's mother Rozalia Arnoldovna Tarle was a housewife who dedicated herself to raising children. He had four siblings.Boris Kaganovich (1995).

Talleyran. ‚Äî Moscow: High School, p. 3 In 1892 Tarle completed gymnasium in Kherson and entered the Imperial Novorossiya University on Fyodor Uspensky's recommendation. In a year he moved to the University of Kiev to study history and philosophy. He was \\"the most distinguished student of Ivan Vasilevich Luchitski (1845‚Äì1918) of the University of Kiev\\". After finishing his undergraduate education in 1896, he continued there as a graduate student in history. As a student Tarle joined Marxist clubs and took an active part in the social democracy movement. He frequently visited Kievan factory workers as a lecturer and agitator. On 1 May 1900 he was arrested during a secret meeting in the middle of Anatoly Lunacharsky's speech. Tarle was sent to Kherson under police supervision and was forbidden to teach at Imperial universities and gymnasiums. On August he and his wife were allowed to move to Warsaw where they spent about a year. During that time he published many articles on history in various magazines. In 1901 he was also allowed a two-day visit to St. Petersburg in order to defend his master's thesis on Thomas More. With the support of colleagues he was finally given permission to work as a privatdozent at the University of St. Petersburg in 1903, a position he held up until 1917. On February 1905 Tarle was arrested again for taking part in student protests and excluded from the university. However, after the October Manifesto decriminalized Marxists, he managed to return and continued his teaching career.Evgeny Chapkevich (1977). Yevgeny Victorovich Tarle. ‚Äî Moscow: Nauka, p. 31 To achieve his doctoral degree, he completed a two-volume dissertation about France. His interest in France increased in time: he completed another work on the economic history of France in 1916. From 1913 to 1918 he also served as a professor at the University of Tartu. =Foreign travel= From 1903 to 1914 Tarle traveled to France on a yearly basis. He had done research in the libraries and archives of Western Europe for all his early works, spending a lot of time at the Archives Nationales (France) in particular. He also contacted many prominent historians and even read a paper at the World Congress of Historical Studies held in London in 1913. The number of his works prior to the Revolution amounted to 211. His most important publications before the revolution were: *Kontinentalnaia blokada v. I: Issledovaniia po istorii promyshelennosti i vneshnei torgovli Frantsii v epokhu Napoleona [The Continental Blockade V. I: Studies in the History of French Industry and Trade under Napoleon] in 1913 *Ekonomicheskaia zhizn korolestva Italii v tsarstvovaniie Napoleona [The Economic Situation of Italy during the Napoleonic Era], which was first published in 1916 and in the following years also in French (1928) and in Italian (1950). *Pechat‚Äôvo Frantsii pri Napoleone [The French Press under Napoleon] published in 1913 *Rabochii klass vo Frantsii v epokhu revoliutsii [The French Working Class during the Revolution] (1909‚Äì1911) =Soviet era and exile= Russian historical scholarship was deeply affected by the October Revolution. Despite this, Tarle remained at the University of St. Petersburg. From 1918 on he also headed the Petrograd department of the Central Archive of RSFSR. He soon became a professor at Moscow University and moved to Moscow. In 1921 he became a corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, becoming a full member in 1927.Tarle Yevgenii Viktorovich at the Russian Academy of Sciences website He was also active in the Russian Association of Scientific Institutes for Research in the Social Sciences (RANION). From 1922 to 1924 he published an Annually journal of general history along with Fyodor Uspensky. Tarle had achieved distinction as a specialist in modern history through his book Europe in the Age of Imperialism. During 1928‚Äì1931 Tarle was frequently criticized by his colleagues in articles published in Istorik-Marksist and in Borba Klassov. Between 1929 and 1931 a group of prominent historians were arrested by the State Political Directorate following the so-called Academic Case (also known as The Case of Platonov). They were accused of hatching a plot to overthrow the Soviet government. In 1930 Tarle was arrested as well, accused of \\"being an \\"interventionist\\" and a \\"traitor\\" destined to be the foreign minister in a restored capitalist government\\". On 8 August 1931 he was exiled to Almaty where he spent the next four years. =Post-exile= After Tarle returned from exile in early 1934, he got back to his academic work in Leningrad and wrote two significant works on the Napoleonic period: a biography of Napoleon (Napoleon) published in 1936 and Napoleon‚Äôs Invasion of Russia, 1812 published in 1938. They were of great importance for estimating the change in Tarle's interpretation of history. Tarle's scholarly work during this period is the subject of much controversy. A. Roland, while praising Tarle for being a renowned authority on the Napoleonic era and having clearly understood the epoch of the Napoleonic wars, accuses him of having refracted the impact of the French revolution through the person of Napoleon. Tarle's description of the Napoleonic Empire in Napoleon (1936) had mostly been perceived as a study in the classic Marxist tradition. He had repeated the basic ideas of Mikhail Pokrovsky on the 1812 campaign and managed to interpret Napoleon from the viewpoint of the class-struggle. Like Pokrovsky, Tarle treated the Russian people's patriotism and the talents of the Russian commanders as of lesser significance. However, according to Erickson, \\"Tarle‚Äôs interpretation differed from the more rigid economic interpretation of the Pokrovski school\\". Unlike Pokrovski, Tarle brought individuals in the foreground. Napoleon was recognized as an influential historical figure. The Battle of Borodino was not termed a victory in his work and the resistance to Napoleon was claimed as being \\"never a popular, national war\\". He stated that \\"there was no mass participation by the peasantry in the guerilla bands and in their activities, and their part in the campaign was strictly limited\\". According to Tarle, ‚Äú... it is clear that if the Spanish guerilla warfare might justifiably be called a national war, it would be impossible to apply this term to any Russian movement in the war of 1812\\". Tarle supported his interpretation by \\"denying that the peasants fought against the French and describing the burning of Smolensk and Moscow as systematic acts of the Russian army in retreat\\". Naturally, Tarle also gave references to Lenin's words on Napoleon in his book. Tarle's biography of Napoleon, according to Black, was accepted as \\"the final word in the analysis of the 1812 campaign\\" when it was first published in 1936. However, his interpretation met severe criticism. The same year brought a radical change in Soviet historiography: A critical approach toward the 1812 campaign was no longer permitted. At this point, Tarle was subjected to strong criticism among the society of historians all around the world. √âmigr√© historians in the United States and historians in Europe wrote about Tarle soon after he completed a second book on the same theme in the history of the 1812 war. He prepared his new work in a comparatively shorter time and published it in 1938 under the title Napoleon‚Äôs Invasion of Russia, 1812. This book was translated into English and published in Great Britain in 1942. In his new book, Tarle mixed Marxist ideology and Russian nationalism. This time, the war of 1812 was not presented as unexceptional like other wars of Napoleon. The war with Russia was \\"more frankly imperialistic than any other of Napoleon‚Äôs wars; it was more directly dictated by the interests of the French upper-middle class\\". The \\"principal theme of Tarle‚Äôs new work was his glorification of the heroism exhibited by the Russian people and the wise conduct of the campaign by the Russian commanders in general and by Kutuzov in particular\\". In his work of 1938, strong emphasis was placed on Russian patriotism. =Post-World War II= Tarle spent the Great Patriotic War in evacuation in Kazan. From 1941 to 1943 he worked as a professor at the historico-philological department of the Vladimir Ulyanov-Lenin Kazan State University. From 1942 on he was also a member of the Extraordinary State Commission that investigated Nazi war crimes. In the post-war period, Tarle's 1938 book was subjected to severe and intemperate criticism as Soviet historical writing was affected by the \\"theory of the counteroffensive\\". According to Erickson, the two important trends conflicting with the views of Tarle were \\"the campaign against the ‚Äòcosmopolitanism‚Äô ... and Stalin‚Äôs glorification of himself as a military genius\\". In 1951 Bolshevik published an article written by the director of the War Museum in Borodino Sergey Kozhukhov. Tarle was accused of having made use of foreign sources to the detriment of those of Russian origin, of having emphasized the passive character of Kutuzov's maneuvers and of having claimed that Kutuzov was continuing the tactics of the Barclay de Tolly. In addition, Tarle was attacked for having failed to evaluate the Battle of Borodino as a clear-cut Russian victory, for having stated that Moscow was burned by the Russians themselves and for having assigned too much significance to the expanses of Russia, cold and hunger as factors in the defeat of the French army. According to Kozhukhov, Napoleon's Invasion of Russia, 1812 showed the influence of bourgeois historiography. Tarle had not been sufficiently critical of \\"aristocratic-bourgeois\\" historians and had distorted the history of the \\"Fatherland War\\". Tarle replied to Kozhukhov's criticism stating that he had already begun work on a new book on the Napoleonic period which would contain different interpretations than his earlier works. Tarle wrote \\"In light of the recent victory over the Nazis, it was no longer possible to view Russian history, especially military history, in the same way. Valuable new materials and \\"chiefly Stalin‚Äôs enormously significant and illuminating judgment, published in 1947\\", had obliged Soviet historians to correct their errors and revise their interpretations of the war of 1812\\". Among Tarle's works, another point which drew attention in the society of historians was his interpretation of Crimean War. Tarle began working on the history of the Crimean War in the late 1930s. He was given access to otherwise inaccessible Russian archives for his work. The first volume, published in 1941, was awarded the Stalin Prize. The second volume appeared in 1943. His general approach to the history of the Crimean War is a \\"mixture of criticism of the imperialistic character of the war and glorification of the Russian people\\". Tarle became one of the most influential figures in the historical front. His complete work was entitled \\"The City of Russian Glory: Sevastopol in 1854‚Äì1855\\", and was published in 1954 by the publishing house of the USSR Defense Ministry. The book was based on the two-volume study about the Crimean war, written by Tarle earlier. He compares the siege of 1854‚Äì1855 to the defense of Sevastopol in 1941‚Äì1942 while attacking Washington, Hitlerism, and West Germany. The Crimean War was presented by Tarle to the public as a war launched by the western states. According to Tarle, in 1854‚Äì1855 the defenders of Sevastopol not only fought for the city, but also defended \\"the annexations, made by the Russian state and the Russian people in the times of Peter I and during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries\\". =Death= Yevgeny Viktorovich Tarle died on 6 January 1955 in Moscow. He died before he was able to fulfill his intention of writing a new book on the war of 1812, though he came further into line with the theory of the \\"counteroffensive\\" in an article published in 1952. He was buried at the Novodevichy Cemetery.Tarle's tomb His wife Olga Tarle (1874‚Äì1955) died same year, just a month later and was buried near him. They lived together for over 60 years. Their only son Victor died shortly after his birth and was buried in Kiev. Memory According to Hetnal, no other Soviet historian received so much attention as Tarle did both at home and abroad. Foreign historians have been fascinated by Tarle. The professor of Polish origin, Wiktor Weintraub wrote an article devoted to him. Italian historian Franco Venturi also wrote an interesting article about Tarle. They were followed by Edgar H√∂sch and others; Tarle's writings had also been evaluated by Anatole Mazour. Another comprehensive work on Tarle was completed by Stanis≈Çaw Wi≈õniewski, a Polish historian from Lublin. He stressed that Tarle's writings were of unequal value. The wide range of Tarle's interests, even within the Napoleonic field, the speed with which he worked, as well as the political situation in which he worked after 1936 and other reasons account for his shortcomings.

The fort was originally built in 1862 along Rainbow Banks in Martin County, southeast of Hamilton, as a suitable location for defense of the Roanoke Valley. Twelve pieces of artillery were stationed at the fort to prevent Union access to the Wilmington-Weldon Railroad Bridge. On December 12, 1864, members of the 2nd Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Heavy Artillery, 27th Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry, 9th New Jersey Volunteer Infantry, 16th Connecticut Volunteer Infantry, 176th Regiment Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry, Battery A of the 3rd New York Heavy Artillery Regiment, and the 12th Regiment New York Volunteer Cavalry under the command of Colonel Jones Frankle advanced towards Fort Branch. The night was bitterly cold and quite dark, which enabled the Union contingent to move easily. Colonel John Hinton, commanding officer of the fort, was caught unawares and was captured easily by Captain Samuel P. Russell of Battery A of the 3rd New York. Despite this initial success, the decision to chase down Confederate soldiers of the Weldon Junior Reserves gave Hinton's men time to regroup, and the fort was abandoned as Frankle and his men retreated back to Williamston, North Carolina.

His second son, Victor Adolphe Malte-Brun, was also a geographer. Today he is perhaps best remembered for coining the name for the geographic region Oceania (French Oc√©anie) around 1812. Biography Born in Thisted to an administrator of Danish crown lands, Malte-Brun was originally destined for a career as a pastor, but chose instead to attend classes at the University of Copenhagen, and became a supporter of the French Revolution and an activist in favor of freedom of the press. Following the harsh censorship laws instituted by the Danish ruler crown prince Frederick in September 1799, he was indicted because of his many pamphlets which contained outright criticism of the government, which the new censorship laws forbade. A particular cause for offence was a pamphlet he published in 1795 entitled \\"Catechism of the Aristocrats.\\" The case of Peter Andreas Heiberg, who for similar crimes had been sentenced to exile at Christmas of 1799, did not make Malte-Brun optimistic about his prospects. He had already left the country prior to the court sentence (which was first carried late 1800) and had settled first in Sweden, later in the Free City of Hamburg. At some point during his exile, he started using his Danish first name, Malthe, as part of his surname, Bruun. An 1837 edition of a Malte-Brun Map of China. This is one of the earliest maps to use the term Manchuria (Mandchourie), which Conrad Malte-Brun and Mentelle promoted as early as 1804.¬´Les provinces tributaires du nord ou la Mantchourie, la Mongolie, la Kalmouquie, le Sifan, la Petit Bucharie, et autres pays vulgairement compris sous la fausse d√©nomination de TARTARIE¬ª, in: Malte-Brun arrived in France in November 1799, and began work on a geography treatise meant as a gift to his adoptive country. A poem on the death of Andreas Peter Bernstorff which he published during his exile procured for him permission to return to Denmark. But another pamphlet against the aristocracy subjected him to a new prosecution, and he left his country, and finally took up his residence in Paris. In December 1800, the Danish courts pronounced sentence of perpetual banishment against him, which was rescinded about the time of his death. Malte-Brun's geography treatise was written with the help of Edme Mentelle, a professor at the √âcole Normale; together, they produced G√©ographie math√©matique, physique et politique de toutes les parties du monde (6 vols., published between 1803 and 1812). He was a regular contributor to Journal des D√©bats. He at first opposed the consular government, but subsequently became a zealous imperialist, and after the fall of Napoleon an equally zealous monarchist, publishing in 1824 Trait√© de la l√©gitimit√© consid√©r√©e comme base du droit public de l'Europe chr√©tienne. Aside from his political writings, he devoted himself especially to geographical studies. He was the founder of Les Annales des Voyages (in 1807) and Les Annales des Voyages, de la G√©ographie et de l'Histoire (in 1819), which encouraged observations and reports as a basis for research. He became well known after contributing Tableau de la Pologne, a treatise on the geography of Poland (in 1807, as the First Empire troops established French tutelage in the region). In 1822-1824, he served as the first general secretary of the newly founded Soci√©t√© de G√©ographie.

He died in Paris in 1826, as he was drafting the final version of his major work, the Pr√©cis de G√©ographie Universelle ou Description de toutes les parties du monde.

History On January 2004 it incorporated the two independent municipalities of Zimmerwald and Englisberg. *Englisberg, population: 201 *Zimmerwald, population: 870 Englisberg is first mentioned in 1166 as Endlisperc. Zimmerwald was first mentioned in 1296 as Zymmerwalt. Until 1902 it was officially known as Obermuhlern und Zimmerwald. =Englisberg= Granary in Englisberg Englisberg first appears in a historic record with the Kyburg Ministerialis (unfree knights in the service of a feudal overlord) family of Englisberg. By the 15th century Bernese patrician families owned the village and surrounding Herrschaft. The right to hold court in the Herrschaft was sold to the villagers in 1570 and then split into 70 shares. This situation remained until the 18th century, when Bernese patricians bought the majority of the shares back. It was originally part of the parish of Belp, but in 1699 became an independent parish. The village economy always relied on agriculture. However, by 1900 fewer workers were needed on the farms and the population began to decline. A poorhouse opened in 1890 and eventually became the K√ºhlewil nursing home, which is now a major employer in the village. =Zimmerwald= Hotel und Pension de Beau S√©jour, Zimmerwald, dated 1865 The oldest trace of a settlement in the area are several neolithic artifacts found at √Ñppenacker. Roman era artifacts and a lime kiln have been discovered scattered around the municipal area. The village and surrounding lands were owned by several Bernese families as well as Interlaken Abbey, K√∂niz and M√ºnchenbuchsee Commanderys and the Obere Spital in Bern. In 1528 Bern adopted the new faith of the Protestant Reformation, secularized the monasteries and acquired their estates, including Zimmerwald. The village was combined to form the court of Obermuhlern and Zimmerwald in the Seftigen District. Until 1697 it was part of the large parish of Belp, then it formed an independent parish with the parish church in Zimmerwald. In 1641 the wealthy Bernese Werdt family built a hunting lodge in the village. In 1860 the Pension Beau S√©jour was built in the park near the lodge. The Pension became famous, when in 1915, the Zimmerwald Conference was held there. The Zimmerwald Conference was the first of three international socialist conferences convened by anti-militarist socialist parties from countries that were originally neutral during World War I. The Zimmerwald movement grew out of the conferences. The delegates included Lenin and Leon Trotsky. Eventually the Pension was demolished and no trace remains of the building. In 1956 the University of Bern opened the Zimmerwald Observatory in the municipality. In 1988 a satellite monitoring station was added. Today, the village economy still relies mostly on farming and raising livestock. Geography Hamlet of Br√∂nni, Obermuhlern, village of Zimmerwald Wald has an area of .

Retrieved 30 April 2016. Performances=Blindfolds= In one of his best known performances he would cover his eyes with soft dough balls, blindfold himself, swath his entire head in strips of cloth, and yet still be able to see. Bux was the star of a 1950 TV series titled Kuda Bux, Hindu Mystic, and his apparent ability to see while blindfolded with dough balls strongly influenced British author Roald Dahl in his short story \\"The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar\\", about a man who was taught to develop the same powers. Observers noted that without a blindfold Bux required reading glasses to read fine print. While blindfolded he would read the dates on coins which were held in a spectator's hand, read the fine print of a magazine, thread a needle while covered in a wine barrel, duplicate words he had never seen written, shoot a can on children's heads with a pellet gun, and many other tricks. =Firewalking= According to Robert Ripley, Bux performed a trick in NBC Radio City Studios in Manhattan on 2 August 1938. According to this account, a hole was dug in the Radio City parking lot and wooden logs and bags of charcoal were set on fire in it. Bux allegedly walked back and forth through the pit‚Äîtwice. Ripley said, \\"Kuda Bux's feet were not even warm.\\" There is newsreel footage of this event in the TV biography The Incredible Life and Times of Robert Ripley: Believe It or Not! (TBS 1993). In 1935 Bux demonstrated firewalking in front of an audience of scientists from the University of London Council for Psychical Research and news reporters.Melton, J. Gordon. (2013). The Encyclopedia of Religious Phenomena. Visible Ink. p. 111. He walked across a pit of burning hot coals unscathed. Bux's feet were checked before and after the firewalking demonstration to verify that no protective chemicals, topical creams or herbs were used. It was a very windy day and the surface temperature of the fire was read at The body of the fire was measured at , which is hot enough to melt steel. After Bux walked through the coals, a cameraman who had messed up some photographs of the event asked for a retake. Bux obliged by repeating the firewalk. Again, his feet were checked before and after the firewalking demonstration. Bux's firewalking ability amazed western audiences in the 1930s. Harry Price suggested that the feat was performed by specific placement of the feet. However, the mentalist Joseph Dunninger gave a more logical explanation. He pointed out that charcoal cooled down rapidly and by walking quickly on it, one could avoid being burned.Samuel, Lawrence R. (2011). Supernatural America: A Cultural History. ABC-CLIO. p. 49. Personal life Khudah Bukhsh was born in Akhnur, Kashmir in 1905, to an ethnic Kashmiri family. His father worked as a railway ticket inspector. Bukhsh later became a Pakistani citizen. In the mid-1930s, he arrived in the United States where he pursued his practice of magic. When he was thirteen, he set out to learn magic from Professor Moor, a famous magician at the time. He eventually met Banerjee in Hardwar, a yogi who taught him fire walking and seeing without his eyes. In his later life, he lost his eyesight to glaucoma. He was also known as DareDevil or The Man Who Can See Without His Eyes. He died in 1981 in his sleep, aged 75.

Grant and Flag Officer Andrew Hull Foote captured three Confederate forts and opened two rivers, the Tennessee River and the Cumberland River, to control by the Union Navy. The commanders received national recognition for their victories in February 1862, as they were the first major Union successes of the war. The capture of Fort Donelson and its garrison by the Union led to the capture of Tennessee's capital and industrial center, Nashville, which remained in Union hands from February 25, 1862 until the end of the war, and gave the Union effective control over much of Tennessee. This struck a major blow to the Confederacy early in the war. The main portion of the park, in Dover, Tennessee, commemorates the Battle of Fort Donelson (). Fort Heiman, in nearby Calloway County, Kentucky, was a Confederate battery in the Battle of Fort Henry.  History  The most vulnerable area in the Confederate defensive line in the Western Theater was the state of Kentucky. The Tennessee and Cumberland rivers were potential avenues for a Union invasion of the South through Kentucky and into Tennessee and beyond. Since Kentucky had declared neutrality, the Confederacy could not build defensive works within the state without risking alienating the local population. The local population in western Kentucky was pro-Confederate. Kentucky's westernmost (First) congressional district elected a secessionist and Lincoln proclaimed it to be in rebellion. Part of the lower river battery at Fort Donelson, overlooking the Cumberland River Adna Anderson and William F. Foster, two engineers detached from the Confederate 1st Tennessee Infantry, set to work on May 10, 1861, to find suitable ground just inside the Tennessee border to cover the two strategic rivers. They surveyed possible sites along the Cumberland River, noting the high ridges and deep hollows near the Kentucky border.The river landing community of Lineport, Tennessee, was considered before the area near Dover was finally selected. In mid-May, on the west bank of the river not far below Dover, Anderson laid out the water battery of Fort Donelson, twelve miles (19 km) from the Kentucky line. The new fort was named in honor of the Confederate General Daniel S. DonelsonThe general was a nephew of Andrew and Rachel Donelson Jackson. who, along with Colonel Bushrod Johnson of the Corps of Engineers, approved of the site. Construction was begun by a large force of men brought from the nearby Cumberland Iron Works.Cumberland Iron Works was one of the many iron ore furnaces in Stewart County, Tennessee. It was located at present-day Carlisle, south of Dover, Tennessee. Administrative history of the park Map of Fort Donelson The site was established as Fort Donelson National Military Park on March 26, 1928. The national military park and national cemetery were transferred from the War Department to the National Park Service on August 10, 1933. The park was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966. It was redesignated a national battlefield on August 16, 1985. Public Law 108-367 (October 25, 2004) increased the authorized boundary of the national battlefield from 551.69 acres (2.23 km2) to 2,000 acres (8.09 km2). On October 30, 2006, Calloway County transferred the Fort Heiman site, which was purchased through the Office of Kentucky Nature Preserves' Kentucky Heritage Land Conservation Fund, to the Park Service. Fort Heiman had been listed on the National Register of Historic Places on December 12, 1976. Park today The park preserves much of the original battle site, including the river batteries and the eroded remains of the fort, but the area in which the Confederate States Army attacked on February 15, 1862, is largely in private hands and occupied by residential development. The Cumberland River was dammed in the 1960s; this area is currently referred to as Lake Barkley. It covers an area roughly similar to the original river while at flood stage, as it was during the battle. The Civil War Trust (a division of the American Battlefield Trust) and its partners have acquired and preserved of the battlefield, most of which has been conveyed to the NPS and incorporated into the battlefield park.

History On January 1, 1970, the station first signed on as WGCO.Broadcasting Yearbook 1971 page B-50 It was owned by the Buford Broadcasting Company, along with AM 1460 WDYX (now WXEM). The station aired a mix of country music and Christian radio programming. In 1985, Buford Broadcasting was acquired by the Joseph Family.Broadcasting Yearbook 1986 page B-69 WCGO-FM's call sign was changed to WLKQ-FM, using the moniker \\"Lake 102 FM.\\" It began playing an oldies format, and with members of the Joseph Family serving in various roles, \\"Skipper Bob\\" was president and general sales manager, his wife Jackie as office manager, son Mark as general manager, and daughter Kathleen, known by her air name as \\"Kay Mackie.\\" During the 1990s, on-air personalities included Ron Lucas (Ron Lapann), a former tug boat captain, Rick Dennis, Mike Lindsey, Steve Nichols, Ron Ricks and Sue Ryder, who later became a traffic reporter for 750 WSB using the air name Robin Reese.

Lake 102 covered the high school game of the week announced by Mark Blumen. Sideline reports were by Jeff Taves. The radio station sales department was led by Al Garner, once the manager of soul music icon James Brown. The radio station operated profitably for many years. Eventually the Joseph Family was offered a large price to sell the station, to be targeted to the expanding Spanish-speaking population within the coverage area of the station's former 6,000-watt signal. In 2003, Davis Broadcasting paid $5.25 million to acquire WLKQ-FM.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 2005 page D-149 The Oldies format ended in April 2004, as the station began broadcasting Regional Mexican music.

The Old Sacramento Historic District is a U.S. National Historic Landmark District. The Historic District is sometimes abbreviated as Old Sacramento, or Old Sac, and since the 1960s has been restored and developed as a significant tourist attraction. History The city of Sacramento grew up in the mid-nineteenth century as a development from Sutter's Fort. However, the Fort was some distance from the Sacramento River, which was the main means of transport to the coast of California, and the area that would become the modern city developed along the waterfront. Before Sacramento's extensive levee system was in place, the area flooded quite regularly. Because of this, the city's streets were raised a level. Most of the sidewalks and storefronts have been filled in; however, many tunnels still remain throughout Old Sacramento and the downtown area. By the 1960s, the area had fallen into disrepair and disrepute. A large effort was made to secure the area's future as an outdoor living history center similar to Colonial Williamsburg in Virginia. Several historically significant buildings were moved or reconstructed. Those that were beyond repair were demolished. Official Site of Old Sacramento Retrieved 2011-08-07 Today, the Old Sacramento Historic District covers the area between the river frontage and Interstate 5, between I Street and the Capitol Mall. The State Historic Park comprises about a third of the total acreage of the district including half of the waterfront, a large grassy area and railroad features. Virtually all the buildings in this area date from the 19th century, the most notable dating back to the period immediately after the disastrous fire of 1852, and show a reasonable approximation of their original appearance, though they have required varying degrees of reconstruction to restore to them to that state. However, few if any still serve their original purpose, most of them now housing restaurants, gift shops, or other businesses catering to tourists. California State Parks page on Old Sacramento. Retrieved 2011-08-07 Old Sacramento State Historic Park attracts over 5 million visitors annually. Regular events include the Sacramento Music Architecture Birch Building on 2nd Street. The Union Hotel, Birch Building, and Orleans Hotel (recently reconstructed). While the architecture from this period is commonly attributed to Victorian gold miners, characteristics of West End, such as multi-storied buildings, large arched doorways, full-height balcony windows and the use of decorative wrought-iron balconies, were most ubiquitous in parts of Spain and the Spanish colonies. This influence may be attributed to the fact that the period of Spanish, then Mexican, rule in California enjoyed immigration from all over the Atlantic, including Spain and the Canary Islands, and the Spanish colonies. The architecture of Old Town Sacramento (formerly known as West End) exhibits observable characteristics similar to that of San Juan (Puerto Rico), Havana (Cuba), Tampico (Mexico), Seville (Spain), Santa Cruz de Teneriffe (Canary Islands), Madrid (Spain).Andrew Bryant \\"Social Architecture: The Spanish Colonial Townhouse.\\" While the architectural style of Old Sacramento, with its wrought iron balconies and evenly spaced full-height windows may remind one of Paris, Sacramento's oldest buildings predate the Haussmann Projects that renovated large areas of Paris in that style.de Moncan, Patrice, Le Paris d'Haussmann, pg. 144-45. Historic buildings Notable buildings include: *B. F. Hastings Building, the National Historic Landmarked western terminal of the Pony Express and the first location of the California Supreme Court; also housed the office of the Alta California Telegraph Company; features a branch of the Wells Fargo History Museum *Big Four House, a National Historic Landmarked building constructed through the joint efforts of California's railroad pioneers: Collis Huntington, Mark Hopkins, Leland Stanford and Charles Crocker, known as The Big Four. *Lady Adams Building - oldest non-residential building in Old Sacramento and is California Historical Landmark No. 603. *Sacramento Engine Company No. 3, the oldest remaining firehouse in Sacramento *Old Sacramento Schoolhouse Museum *Eagle Theatre - only survived from 1849 to 1850 but has been reconstructed * Booth Buildings hens * Booth's residence on Front Street, the first U.S. governor's mansion in California. * Morse Building The first two are also individually designated National Historic Landmarks. Memorials Theodore Judah plaque in Old Sacramento The district contains many memorials to the founders of the city and of the California and transcontinental railroad and other transport systems, including the Theodore Judah monument and the Pony Express Statue. Current attractions Old Sacramento is the site of the California State Railroad Museum, the California State Military Museum, the Sacramento History Museum, the Wells Fargo History Museum and the Old Sacramento Interpretive Center. Other attractions available for visitors include rides in horse-drawn carriages, historic trains from the former Central Pacific Railroad passenger station, and cruises on historic riverboats. A historic sternwheel riverboat, the Delta King, is moored in the river and serves as a hotel, restaurant and theater. Riverfront Park located north of J street allows access to the waters edge. The Sacramento Valley Rail Station is just a short walk away. Interpretive programs The Old Sacramento Historical Foundation manages several programs to highlight the history of the city, including historical reenactments by costumed docents, as well as tours of Old Sacramento's underground level. During October, there is also a special Halloween themed ghost tour. Every Labor Day weekend, Old Sacramento holds its annual Gold Rush Days. During this time, the paved streets are covered with several tons of dirt and automobile traffic is barred from the area. Old Sac's regular corps of costumed docents is supplemented by extra volunteers and professional reenactors to recreate life in Sacramento as it was in the mid to late 1800s.
