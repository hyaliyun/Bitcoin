The aim of the GTCP is to identify, monitor and protect the nesting beaches of loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) found at two locations on the Gnaraloo coastline. These two rookeries contribute to the South-East Indian Ocean subpopulation of loggerhead turtles, with other major nesting sites for this sub-population at Dirk Hartog island (within Shark Bay) and Exmouth. This is within the southern boundaries of the Ningaloo Coast marine area, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. History The Western Australian coast is the site of a significant number of rookeries of loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta), green sea turtles (Chelonia mydas), and hawksbill sea turtles (Eretmochelys imbricata), all of which are classified vulnerable to critically endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. The nesting sites are particularly numerous for loggerhead sea turtles, whose rookeries range from Shark Bay to Gnaraloo Bay in the south, and Ningaloo Reef to the Cape Range National Park in the north. In 2005, after purchasing the land at Gnaraloo, the Gnaraloo Station Trust became aware of the threatened population of sea turtles nesting along the coast and recognized the need for their protection and conservation. An on- ground monitoring and scientific research program was established with the help of the Department of Environment and Conservation (DEC) (now DPaW), following a similar protocol to the neighbouring Ningaloo Turtle Program in Exmouth. Full season surveys of sea turtle tracks and nests within the Gnaraloo Bay Rookery (1 November - 28 February) have taken place since 2008. Yearly, a successful and in depth community engagement program has been undertaken, visiting schools along the Western Australian coast from Carnarvon to Busselton. In late 2015, the Gnaraloo Wilderness Foundation was created in order to facilitate the environmental conservation efforts of Gnaraloo; it received its not-for-profit incorporated association status in Western Australia on 12 January 2016. Gnaraloo Feral Animal Control Program The Gnaraloo Turtle Conservation Program operates in conjunction with the Gnaraloo Feral Animal Control Program, which was implemented in 2009 with the aim of reducing the impact of feral animals, namely the introduced European red fox (Vulpes vulpes), as well as feral cats and wild dogs. Since the 2010/2011 season, feral predation has been successfully maintained at 0%, providing complete protection of sea turtle eggs and hatchlings from these feral predators. Ghost crab predation The endemic golden ghost crabs (Ocypode convexa) and, to a lesser extent, horned ghost crabs (Ocypode ceratopthalmus) are also significant as some of the main predators of sea turtle eggs and hatchlings in Western Australia. Some methods for protecting the nests against ghost crabs have been proposed for trial in Gnaraloo, including wire or plastic screens placed over the nests.

One of only a handful of Australian songwriters ever to make No 1 on the American Billboard Chart, the song reached the top position in May 1978 sung as a duet by Johnny Mathis and Deniece Williams. It was top ten in both Canada and the UK and certified Gold by the R.I.A.A and the BPI. It was also covered by English band Silver Sun in 1998 and reached number 20 in the UK singles chart. Early life John grew up in the Melbourne suburb of Kew, and in his early teens formed \\"The Kinetics\\" with school friends Steve Groves, Ian Manzie and Ken Leroy. The band had some success on the local charts and worked the many dances and clubs that sprang up in Melbourne in the mid-1960s, splitting in 1967. During the next few years John worked with many bands including a re-formed ‚ÄòKinetics‚Äô with Ian Manzie, John Wickman and Mal Nichols, ‚ÄòThe Trap‚Äô with Yvonne Barrett on vocals, an unnamed band with musicians Gil Mathews, Gary Mobely and Alan Turnbull and ‚ÄòThe Vibrants‚Äô with Penny Parsons, Geoff Skewes, Mick Hamilton and Trevor Courtney. It was also around this time that he began working as a studio musician. 1970s In 1971 John travelled to London to join friends Steve Groves and Steve Kipner in the band Tin Tin which achieved Top 20 chart success in the US with \\"Toast and Marmalade for Tea\\" produced by Maurice Gibb. Managed by Robert Stigwood, Tin Tin joined the Bee Gees on an extended tour of the United States where their set consisted mostly of songs from their well received new album \\"Astral Taxi\\". After Tin Tin split, John spent much of the seventies working in London as a studio musician, while working and writing with Steve‚Äôs father Nat Kipner producing tracks for various artists. It was around this time they wrote Too Much, Too Little, Too Late. Returning to Australia in the late 70s, John and fellow aussies Gary Keady and John Phelps started the band \\"World\\" along with London studio musicians Adrian Wyatt and Eric Cairns. Much of the bands repertoire was devoted to music written by John and Gary Keady for what was the genesis of a rock opera titled \\"Star Lord\\". 1980s to present John moved into writing music for advertising in the 1980s. Working firstly out of Alberts Studios, where he worked with producers Bruce Brown and Russell Dunlop. Later with Michael Wilson at EMI Studios where he produced and wrote multi award winning tracks for clients like American Express, Apple Inc., Dilmah Tea, De Beers, Domino‚Äôs Pizza, 2Day FM, 2JJJ, 2SM, 2WS, Streets, Bulmers, McDonald's, Nestle, John Walker, Smith's Crisps, and many more! As well as having written songs for Australian, European and South American headliners and American icons such as Barry White, in the 90s John started his own Music Production Company in Australia concentrating mainly on music for advertising, but also co-writing songs for the score of Tristan Malls film Billy's Holiday, and Gary Keady‚Äôs cult film Sons of Steel with songs also featured in The World Music Festival in Japan. His songs have been covered and performed by a wide range of artists around the world including Johnny Mathis, Deniece Williams, Patti Austin, Tom Jones, Barry White, Filipino sensations Mark Bautista and Sarah Geronimo, Silversun and Acker Bilk, to name a few. John continues to work from the comfort of his studios in the Northern Rivers District of New South Wales, and has recently completed new compositions with senior Nashville writers as well as a new album with local country band \\"Gunnado\\".

The door is located on the leftmost side of the narthex of St. Peter's Basilica, in the Vatican City, and leads to the interior of the basilica. It is called the Door of the Dead because it was traditionally used as an exit for funeral processions. Elements The door is composed of ten panels which depict the Christian meaning of death. The panels are arranged in five rows and two columns. The top half of the door depicts the deaths of Jesus and Mary, spread across two panels. The two central panels show a vine branch and wheat, which are shown as being turned into wine and bread in symbolic tribute to the Eucharist. The bottom panels depict the deaths of Abel, Saint Joseph, Saint Peter, Pope John XXIII, Saint Stephen, Pope Gregory VII, and two allusions to the personification of Death. Beneath these depictions are a row of six animals: a blackbird, a dormouse, a hedgehog, an owl, a tortoise and a raven. The inside of the door shows the artist's dedication to Pope John XXIII, a portrayal of John XXIII receiving the bishops on the first day of the Second Vatican Council. Manz√π signed the work with the imprint of his right hand on the inside. Controversy The door is considered to be Manz√π's most controversial work. The corporeal depictions of death were considered disturbing by some Vatican officials, who preferred depictions of a more spiritual nature. Officials were also wary of Manz√π's professed communist ideology and allusions to executions of fascists in the panels of the door. Despite these controversies, the door has remained in operation at the basilica.

The Renaissance principle of \\"ad fontes\\" as applied to Galen sought to establish better texts of his writings, free from later accretions from Arabic-derived texts and texts of medieval Latin. This search for better texts was influential in the early 16th century. Historians use the term medical humanism to define this textual activity, pursued for its own sake. Portrait of a Renaissance physician Leonhart Fuchs Learned medicine centred on the practica, a genre of Latin texts based on description of diseases and their treatment (nosology). Its interests were less in the abstract reasoning of medieval medicine and in the tradition of Avicenna, on which it was built, and instead it was based more on the diagnosis and treatment of particular diseases. Practica, covering diagnosis and therapies, was contrasted with theorica, which dealt with physiology and abstract thought on health and illness. The tradition from Galen valued practica less than theoretical concepts, but from the 15th century the status of practica in learned medicine rose. \\"Learned medicine\\" in this sense was also an academic discipline. It was taught in European universities, and its faculty had the same status as those of theology and law. Learned medicine is typically contrasted with the folk medicine of the period, but it has been argued that the distinction is not rigorous. Its Galenic teachings were challenged successively by Paracelsianism and Helmontianism. Learned medicine and syphilis Around the year 1500 an issue for learned medicine was the nature of morbus gallicus, now identified as venereal syphilis. Alessandro Benedetti, in particular, advocated the line that it was a novel disease, not described in the traditional authorities. Niccolo Leoniceno conceded that in terms of symptoms it could not be identified as known to the ancients; but denied that novel diseases could exist.

He is known for his late Baroque religious and mythological scenes and landscapes. He had an international career in Italy, Southern Germany and Austria where he worked for aristocratic patrons and churches; He returned to his native Flanders later in his life. Life Franciscus de Neve (II) was born in Antwerp where he was baptised on 23 February 1632. He was the son of Franciscus de Neve (I), who was also a painter. Because early biographers such as Arnold Houbraken and Jean-Baptiste Descamps did not realise that there were two artists named Franciscus de Neve, they confused and merged the lives of father and son and placed the father incorrectly in Rome after 1660. The confusion between the two artists still continues to this day. Only recently have art historians attempted to disentangle the biographies and oeuvres of father and son de Neve.Stillfried, Silvia (2008) Frans de Neve, ein fl√§mischer Maler im 17. Jahrhundert auf Wanderschaft in S√ºd- und Mitteleuropa Franciscus de Neve (I) at the RKD The crucifixion There is no information about his training. He was in Rome from 1660 to 1670 where he became a member of the Bentvueghels, an association of mainly Dutch and Flemish artists working in Rome. It was customary for the Bentvueghels to adopt an appealing nickname, the so-called 'bent name'. De Neve received the bentname Bloosaerken (also written as Blaserken). In Rome, he first lived with Pieter van Mander, then with Hieronymus Galle in 1661-1662 and later with Lodewijk Snaijers in 1665-1666.Franciscus de Neve (II) at the RKD According to Houbraken he received praise while in Rome for his ability to paint according to nature.Franciscus de Neve Biography in: Arnold Houbraken, De groote schouburgh der Nederlantsche konstschilders en schilderessen, 1718 In 1661, he made paintings for the Palazzo Doria-Pamphili. This was a prestigious commission as he worked alongside prominent painters such as Pietro da Cortona. The Flemish painters Cornelis de Wael and Abraham Brueghel who were working in Rome at the time were also active as art dealers dealt in pictures of de Neve. They were instrumental in supporting the artist's career in Italy. He was probably in Naples in the years 1667 and 1668. He left Italy for Germany where he worked in Augsburg and Munich. He then travelled to Austria where between the years 1669 and 1689 he painted altarpieces commissioned by the Archbishop of Salzburg and the Benedictine abbeys of Kremsm√ºnster, Garsten and Admont. In Bavaria he painted altarpieces for the Archbishop of Passau during the years 1669 and 1689. He further spent time in what is now the Czech Republic from 1679 to 1681. Here he worked on a commission by Prince Karl Eusebius of Liechtenstein for an altarpiece in Moravia. He also acted as a restorer and trader for the Prince. He returned to Antwerp in the late 1680s and became master in the local Guild of Saint Luke in 1690-1691. He died after 1704. He was the teacher of Johannes Drue. Work St Sebastian and St Floriane Franciscus II is now mainly known for his altarpieces and mythological scenes although he also painted portraits. He also had a reputation as a landscape painter and his mythological scenes often include extensive landscapes in a style reminiscent of Claude Lorrain. An example is Narcissus and Echo (Christ Church, University of Oxford). The painter was already at the time of his stay in Rome known for his Roman landscapes and in particular for his detailed rendering of trees and foliage. Most of his landscapes are known only as engravings, few in their original oil version. A large number of small, unsigned landscapes has been handed down almost exclusively in engravings, which were made by Giovanni Giacomo de Rossi alla Pace in the 1660s in Rome. They found wide circulation and were already present in early collections. His altarpieces are in a style, which mixes Flemish, Venetian and Roman classical models derived from Rubens, Raphael, Titian, Tintoretto, Poussin and Pietro da Cortona. Notable is the Flemish surface realism, a colouring in differentiated brown and red tones, which evolved to more red colours toward the 1680s and changed to a mellow tone with more pink colours towards the end of his residence in Central Europe. The colour schemes of his oil paintings as well as his portrait art, which has mainly been preserved in copper engravings, were highly regarded by his contemporaries. On various grounds and in particular its provenance, the art historian Brigitte Fassbinder has argued that the painting Massacre of the Innocents attributed to Rubens and dated 1611-12 is in fact by de Neve.Brigitte Fassbinder, 'Rubens oder nicht Rubens, das ist hier die Frage', √ñsterreichische Zeitschrift f√ºr Kunst und Denkmalpflege, 2003, 57, 2 References Landscape with a shepherdess playing a tambourine External links * Category:1632 births Category:Flemish Baroque painters Category:Flemish engravers Category:People from Antwerp Category:Members of the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke Category:Members of the Bentvueghels Category:Year of death missing ","title":"Franciscus de Neve (II)"},{"id":"41106151","text":"Yuri Stepanov or Yuriy Stepanov may refer to: *Yuri Stepanov (actor) (1967‚Äì2010), Russian actor *Yuri Stepanov (athlete) (1932‚Äì1963), Russian high jumper ","title":"Yuri Stepanov"},{"id":"41106156","text":"School for Spies is the second studio album by Kit Hain.

In 1957 he set a world record at a Leningrad-Helsinki athletic meet. A close-up photograph taken during the event showed that Stepanov used shoes with thick porous soles that acted as a trampoline. While not forbidden by the rules, the use of such shoes was criticized by the foreign media, but was countered by the Soviets that the thick sole was added merely to reduce the risk of injury. After this event, the thickness of the sole was limited to 12 mm by the IAAF.

Biography Brownless was the only son of Anthony Brownless, of Paynetts House, and Bockingfold Manor, near Goudhurst, Kent. After studying for the medical profession at St. Bartholomew's Hospital in London, and at the University of Li√®ge, he was admitted M.R.C.S. of London in 1841, and M.D. of St Andrews in 1846. Brownless practised for some years as a physician in London. Brownless probably suffered from tuberculosis; it's almost certain the state of his health made him decide to come to Australia. He left Liverpool as medical officer aboard the Chaseley and arrived in Melbourne, Victoria in December 1852. Dr. Brownless arrived in Victoria in December 1852, and was soon afterwards elected Physician to the Melbourne Benevolent Asylum, and in 1854 Physician to the Melbourne Hospital‚Äîa post which he held for twelve years, being appointed a Life Governor and Consulting Physician on his retirement. In June 1855 the Melbourne University gave him the diploma of M.D., this being the first occasion on which the degree was conferred by that University, in which Dr. Brownless founded the medical school, and of which he was annually elected Vice-Chancellor for twenty-nine years, from 1858 to 1887; when he was elected Chancellor, in succession to Dr. James Moorhouse. Dr. Brownless held the honorary degree of LL.D. of the Universities of St. Andrews and Melbourne, and in 1884 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of England. Dr. Brownless was made, a Knight of St. Gregory the Great by the Pope in 1870, and a Knight Commander of the Order of Pius IX, conferring nobility, by Leo. XIII. in 1883. Dr. Brownless, who was created C.M.G. in May 1888, has been twice married: first, in 1842, to Ellen, daughter of the late William Hawker, M.D., of Charing, Kent, and Li√®ge, Belgium, formerly surgeon in the Grenadier Guards, who died in 1846; and secondly, in 1852, to Anne Jane, eldest daughter of the late Captain William Hamilton, of Eden, County Donegal, Ireland, an officer in the Rifle Brigade, who served with distinction in the Peninsular War. Brownless died in Melbourne on 3 December 1897 at the university and was buried in the Melbourne General Cemetery.

His wish was to be \\"Batkid\\", a sidekick of the eponymous comic book superhero Batman, the subject of books, radio, television, and films. Once the request went out, thousands of volunteers, city officials, businesses and supporters rallied to turn San Francisco, California into \\"Gotham City\\" ‚Äì the fictional home city of Batman ‚Äì on November 15, 2013 for one of the largest and most elaborate Make-A-Wish projects ever staged. Batkid took part in staged events including several crime scenarios, and received the key to the city from San Francisco mayor Ed Lee. Elected officials, and representatives from law enforcement also took part, and the San Francisco Chronicle, the city's main newspaper, produced a \\"Gotham City Chronicle\\" in honor of the efforts with the headline \\"Batkid Saves City: Hooded hero nabs Riddler, rescues damsel in distress.\\" Background Miles Scott is a cancer survivor from Tulelake, in northern California near the border of Oregon. He was diagnosed with lymphoblastic leukemia ‚Äì a form of leukemia, or cancer of the white blood cells characterized by excess lymphoblasts ‚Äì at 18 months old. In chemotherapy treatment for several years he is now in remission, and the celebration is in honor of his completing treatments, the last one in June 2013. His mother shared that the decision was made to wait until the treatments were complete so that Miles would be strong enough for the day, and also it gave him something to look forward to while undergoing treatments. \\"This wish has meant closure for our family and an end to over three years of putting toxic drugs in our son's body,\\" she said on the Make-A-Wish site. During his treatments Miles was \\"fascinated with superheroes. They were crimefighters and saviors. And they always won in the end.\\" When the San Francisco Make-A-Wish asked Miles what he wanted more than anything else, he replied, \\"I wish to be Batman.\\" Batkid Day The Damsel in distress and Batman actors next to one of two black Lamborghinis which served as the Batmobile Organized by the Make- A-Wish Foundation, the San Francisco Greater Bay Area chapter, the event was aided throughout by a social media plan created by a marketing agency. The chapter sent out an email a month prior to the event asking for supporters, initially hoping for just several hundred people to be a part of the closing ceremony. The request soon spread; by the night before the event over 12,000 volunteers pledged to be a part of making Batkid day happen. Estimates are 10,000‚Äì12,000 people took part at various venues to cheer on Batkid. Many dressed as superheroes in support. Miles was told he was just going to visit San Francisco to pick up a costume so he could dress like Batman; instead, he found himself to be the sidekick helper to an actor dressed as the superhero. His younger brother was dressed as Batman's sidekick Robin. He was watching a local TV news broadcast in the family's hotel room, when the broadcast was interrupted by a flash announcement from San Francisco police chief Greg Suhr appealing for help from Batkid. He left Union Square in a 'Batmobile' with police escort, and soon was on the scene of a damsel in distress, who was tied up on the train tracks of the San Francisco historic cable cars in the Russian Hill neighborhood. They also disabled a plastic replica of a bomb. Crowds roared every step of the adventure with many of the onlookers holding signs supporting the mini-superhero, and chanting \\"Bat kid, bat kid\\". Police Chief Suhr pre-recorded a number of messages to Batkid, serving as the emcee for the events. Batman had a special video watch which would play each message from the police chief as needed. Batman and Batkid were transported, along with Miles' family, in two black Lamborghinis adorned with Batman logos, and escorted by police. His next exploit was to aid in stopping The Riddler from robbing a bank vault in the financial district. Following the capture of The Riddler, the crime-fighting duo refueled for lunch at Burger Bar in San Francisco's Union Square, as thousands filled the area to show support. The Penguin and a henchman actors from SF Batkid Wish His final adventure was presented to him by a flash mob dance performance of Journey's \\"Don't Stop Believin',\\" which directed him to chase after another villain, The Penguin, who drove out of the Union Square car garage with the San Francisco Giants' mascot Lou Seal tied up in a convertible Bentley. The Penguin (Mike Jutan) \\"kidnapping\\" Lou Seal for S.F.'s Batkid Wish experience The Penguin's car took off along the streets of San Francisco, followed in pursuit by Batman and Batkid in their Bat-Lamborghinis, en route to AT&T; Park. In AT&T; Park, The Penguin taunted visitors, attempting to get them to chant \\"Penguin! Penguin! Penguin!\\" in support of him, rather than the chant the crowd preferred, \\"Batkid! Batkid! Batkid!\\" Batkid and Batman arrived, climbing stairs at AT&T; Park, and ultimately chasing The Penguin through the park. After a chase through the cable car, The Penguin exploded a flash pot after saying, \\"I hope you like traps!\\" Batman and Batkid then climbed through a series of obstacle courses, in hot pursuit of The Penguin. They slid down the park slides, finding The Penguin's \\"lair\\", and then chasing him down to the mini-Baseball diamond in the stands. Batkid freed Lou Seal and Batman chased The Penguin, ultimately capturing him and handing him over to officers from the S.F. Police Department. At the end of the day Batkid was taken to SF City Hall where the largest of the crowds gathered in the thousands for a rally. He was given the key to the city by San Francisco mayor Ed Lee. He also received a video Tweet from President Barack Obama at the White House as part of the effort. The U.S. Justice department's U.S. Attorney Melinda Haag \\"unveiled\\" indictments for both the Riddler and the Penguin with conspiracy charges.

Akadama remains popular amongst all generations and is still found in stores across Japan today. Just like port wine, Akadama is a fortified wine.AKADAMA sweet wine poster Origin Shinjiro Torii, the founder of Suntory first sold imported Spanish wines in 1899. Due to its unpopularity with the public, he decided to produce wines that suited Japanese tastes. In 1907, he produced Suntory's first beverage, naming it \\"Akadama port wine.\\" The red circle on the wine bottle label represents the sun, as Shinjiro Torii believed that \\"sun gives life to all beings\\". Renaming In 1973, Suntory renamed its Akadama port wine to Akadama sweet wine due to regulations. Port wine was originally a term used to name Portugal produced wine. In 1970s, Portugal banned the usage of the term port wine outside of its country. Despite the renaming, it is mostly referred as Akadama. Publicity Akadama port wine was famously known for its advertisements. At the time, Akadama port wine was considered as a luxury good. It was sold at a price of 40 sen, 4 times of what a bushel of rice would have cost. Through various advertisements, Suntory received high publicity and reputation from the public. With the support from Imperial University's medical doctor, Akadama port wine was promoted as a safe and nourishing beverage. The beverage was advertised in newspapers, on hairpins worn by geishas and through the nude poster of Emiko Matsushima'. The Famous Nude Poster The nude poster was directed by Toshirou Kataoka, known as a genius in the advertising world. The poster had a huge impact on the public, as it was the first ever nude poster in Japan. It was highly unimaginable for a woman to show bare shoulders in public. The photoshoot for the poster took place in Osaka in May 1922. In the beginning, opera actress Emiko Matsushima wore a Japanese kimono. She was then shot in her inner wear and eventually, she became topless. The final poster was printed in sepia tone, creating an elegant image. Despite the huge impact on the public and winning first place at a world poster contest held in Germany, Matsushima received criticism from her family and relatives who regarded the poster as shameful. Others In the following years, Suntory produced other beverages within the series. In 1954, Suntory produced Akadama sweet white wine and in 1966, the company produced Akadama honey wine. In 1977, Akadama punch was produced and in 2007, Akadama Punch Sparking was sold as a limited edition as a celebration of the 100th anniversary.

Before the 2011 local government reform it was part of the municipality of Vermio, of which it was a municipal district. The 2011 census recorded 768 inhabitants in the village.  History = From classical antiquity to the Roman Empire  Ancient Greek Macedonian tomb near Pyrgoi (Katranitsa)In a location near the village it can be concluded from archeological findings (coins, tombs, inscriptions) that there was an ancient settlement during the Hellenistic and Roman period, which was in control of a route that led from Eordaea to southern Macedonia. Historian Margaritis Dimitsas in his work \\"Ancient Geography of Macedonia\\" places in the region of Pyrgoi the ancient city of Eordaea. He noted \\"...the capital city of Eordaea was located to the south east of lake Ostrovo. Katranitsa's (Pyrgoi) location seems to be similar to that of the ancient city, which had been maintained until the 10th century, when it was destroyed by Bulgarian invaders. The remnants of the city became Katranitsa.\\".  Ottoman Empire  Petar Ichko, Greek diplomat from Pyrgoi who worked in Serbia.Anastasios Christomanos, member of the Christomanos family. He was an important Greek chemist. In 1571, after the naval battle of Nafpaktos (October 7, 1571), there were Greek uprisings against the Ottomans in Katranitsa, and all over Macedonia. During the Ottoman occupation the village flourished so much that it became known as \\"k√º√ß√ºk Istanbul\\" (small Istanbul) and the Patriarchate upgraded it to a regional bishopric. Many personalities that were recognized in humanities, sciences and trade were from Katranitsa. Known merchant of Vienna and close partner to Greek revolutionary Rigas Feraios, Christos Manos, founder of the Greek family Christomanos, was born in the village in 1737. Also from Pyrgoi, was the Greek klepht and revolutionary, Goutas, who was active in the 1740s in the regions of Western and Central Macedonia. He was arrested in 1747 in the city of Veria.

Brancoff, La Mac√©doine et sa Population Chr√©tienne, p. 178  Greek War of Independence  During the Greek War of Independence, the inhabitants of Pyrgoi revolted and, in March 1822, 150 fighters under chieftain, Dimitris Karimitsos of Vlasti, exterminated large Ottoman forces in the area. Chieftain Dimitrios Sigaras from Pyrgoi took part in the revolt of Naoussa with his four brothers and 45 fighters from Pyrgoi. Also, from Pyrgoi was the Liaba family, members of which (such as the Emmanuel, Stergios, Constantine and George brothers) fought and died in the Naoussa massacre in 1822.http://medusa.libver.gr/jspui/bitstream/123456789/3675/101/bitstream_15388.pdf  Macedonian Struggle  Filippos Kapetanopoulos In the period of the Macedonian struggle, the town of Katranitsa (Pyrgoi) was used by Greek guerrillas as a base of excursion. The Greek Macedonian pharmacist Filippos Kapetanopoulos, who worked in Monastir and was a close associate of Pavlos Mela, was from Pyrgoi. He was killed fighting with the guerrilla body of Pavlos Melas, on September 19, 1904, just outside of Polipotamos, Florina. Other Greeks from Pyrgoi who took part in the Macedonia struggle were Harisios Vantkoukis, Anastasios Vasdekis (1847-1931), Konstantinos Vasdekis, Markos Georgiou, Ioannis Kapetanopoulos, Petros Nicolaides, Antonios Pagiantsas, Stavros Hadjimitsos. They were involved in the armed phase of the Macedonian Struggle, most were part of Hellenic Macedonian Committee of Defense against the Bulgarians.

Second World War (the Pyrgoi massacre)  Women from the village with ashes of their family members who died in the massacre On April 24, 1944 there was a massacre of civilians by German Nazis and their local accomplices. It was the second largest German-related massacre of Greece after that of Kalavryta. The events were later the subject of dozens of documentaries and generated wide interest. Among the atrocities that were committed, 368 men women and children were killed and burned alive. Colonel Karl Sch√ºmers of 7th SS Panzer Grenadier Regiment was responsible for the massacres at Pyrgoi, Kleisoura Kastoria, and Distomo Boeotia which in total included over 1,000 men, women and children. The town was completely destroyed and survivors were forced to walk to Ptolemaida. An annual memorial ceremony is held for the victims, where the president of Democracy of Greece visits the village.

It was invented by Zheng Jinde (Chinese: , Zh√®ng J√¨nd√©) during the Qing Dynasty (1661‚Äì1722 AD). The game symbolizes the Three Kingdoms period war (221‚Äì264 AD) between the rival states Wei, Shu, and Wu, each vying for control of China after the fall of the Han Dynasty. Game overview The Three Friends are represented by colors blue, red, and green, respectively. Each player controls all the standard xiangqi pieces, with each general represented by the character of its respective kingdom. In addition, each player controls two fairy pieces: \\"flag\\" () and \\"fire\\" (). A fire moves like a forward-moving ferz: one step diagonally forward, with no retreating, while a flag moves exactly two steps straight forward, until it crosses out of its own territory, after which it moves as a chariot. Checkmate and other conventions are the same as in xiangqi, except that after a checkmate occurs, the mated general is removed from the game, and the player who delivered the checkmate appropriates the mated player's remaining pieces for his own use. The last surviving kingdom (general) is the winner. The board includes spaces which restrict travel for certain pieces; these spaces are labeled \\"ocean\\" (), \\"mountain\\" () and \\"city\\" (). Chariot and horse pieces are not allowed to pass through the ocean space. Cannons are not allowed to pass through mountain and city spaces. Play conventions It may be necessary or desirable to add further play conventions for completeness: * Red moves first. Then move turns alternate counterclockwise around the board. * After a checkmate, removal of the mated general and army appropriation are done in a separate move turn. The piece delivering mate replaces the enemy general on its square.

With Australian composer Percy Grainger, Irwin studied composition before joining the Manhattan School of Music in New York City. The musical theatre composer Vernon Duke introduced Irwin to composer and songwriter George Gershwin in the 1920s. Irwin would subsequently join Gershwin and pianist Oscar Levant in piano improvisations at Gershwin's apartment. Irwin began a six-year professional relationship with songwriter and composer Irving Berlin, after being introduced to him by Gershwin. As Berlin could not read or write music Irwin would write down music as Berlin composed, often writing music down for Berlin in the middle of the night. Irwin was professionally engaged as the musical director of touring productions of the musicals Oklahoma!, South Pacific and The King and I in the 1940s. In the 1960s Irwin became the choral director for Manhattan's Radio City Music Hall and later the halls staff composer and musical director. Irwin retired in 1979, and his wife Helen, died in 1984. They had a son, Dean, who was a television producer for ABC News. Irwin had lived in Staten Island for many years before his death in 1998.

Some of the annexation were done later as of 10 May 1995. Some of the counties were annexed to certain metropolitan cities(Í¥ëÏó≠Ïãú) as of 1 March 2015. The purpose of this annexation plan was to resolve certain problems related to municipal government; for instance, discord between administrative districts and life spheres. The relevant municipalities had the same history in that they once belonged to the same county or municipality before the central town of the country was separated as a city. However, cities separated from old counties of Gwangju(in Gyeonggi Province), Suwon(Hwaseong), Siheung and Bucheon, in the suburbs of Seoul, were not considered for such annexation. For Daejeon, Busan and Gwangju(in Honam area), the remnant counties(Daedeok to Daejeon, Dongnae to Busan, and Gwangsan to Gwangju) were already annexed to the relevant metropolitan cities. Annexation of Ganghwa County to Incheon was not related to Incheon's historical background, but rather a political scheme to expand Incheon in size. In fact, many of the relevant municipalities before the annexation were formed after the Great municipal annexation in 1914 as the Japanese colonial government and later the South Korean government had implemented a policy to separate urban areas into cities from existing counties.  List of cities and counties joined into \\"urban-rural integrated\\" cities in 1995  Note: The names of former cities and counties before the 1995 annexation are complied with the old standard Romanisation, or McCune‚ÄìReischauer Romanisation. The names of the current \\"integrated\\" cities are complied with the current Revised Standard Romanisation (effective as of 2000). The names of some former counties that were not existent at the time of the annexation in 1995 are also complied with the current Romanisation. Cities that are not specified as \\"metropolitan city\\" are all \\"municipal\\" cities.  Gyeonggi area  * Kanghwa County (now Ganghwa County, Incheon) + Ongjin County (now Ongjin County, Incheon) ‚Üí annexed to Incheon Metropolitan City.

In 2009, the central government proposed the consolidation of Guri and Namyangju, but it faced strong opposition by residents in Guri, some of whom urged the annexation to Seoul. Yangju City and Dongducheon City have not yet merged until now, but there is a \\"grass-root\\" consolidation movement for \\"consolidated\\" Yangju City in Yangju, Uijeongbu and Dongducheon areas today. = Not considered for annexation = Cities separated from old counties of Kwangju(in Gyeonggi Province), Suwon(Hwas≈èng), Siheung and Bucheon, in the suburbs of Seoul, were not considered for annexation. Some districts of Seoul that were annexed from such counties were not also considered for inter-municipal consolidation; rather, Yeongdeungpo and Gangnam areas were considered for independent municipal or metropolitan cities separated from Seoul at that time. * From old Gwangju County: several districts in southeastern Seoul(Gangnam, Songp'a and Gangdong), Seongnam City, Hanam City and Gwangju County (today's Gwangju city in Gyeonggi Province) * From old Suwon (later Hwaseong) County: Suwon City, Osan City and Hwaseong County (today's Hwaseong City) * From old Bucheon County: several districts in Incheon (Nam-gu, including today's Yeonsu-gu), Namdong-gu, Seo-gu, Buk-gu (today's Bupyeong and Gyeyang)) and Bucheon City * From old Siheung County: several districts in southwestern/southern Seoul (Yeongdeungp'o, Guro- includes today's Geumcheon), Gwanak, Dongjak and Seocho), Anyang City, Gwangmyeong City, Ansan City, Gwacheon City, Gunp'o City, Uiwang City and Siheung City. A merger of Seoul Metropolitan City and Goyang City was not considered since former townships of old Goyang County that were later annexed to Seoul from 1936 to 1949 were mostly former outer districts of old Seoul (i.e. Hanseong Prefecture) before 1914 and the government at the time of 1995 did not consider the prefectural expansion of Seoul but rather once seriously considered a division of Seoul into several municipal or metropolitan cities.

It is based on the sufferings of the people of Afghanistan during the present war in Afghanistan. It was first published in 2013 by Farrar, Straus and Giroux, New York. Qais, the author of A Fort of Nine Towers, reveals that his work is actually inspired by the works of Khaled Hosseini. It is a non-fiction work, and tells us the author's story in war-bound Afghanistan and how he survives it. The author recounts his childhood memories. The book has received positive reviews from critics. As the author's young life coincided with the war era in Afghanistan, there have been vivid descriptions of the conditions prevalent in that time.  Storyline  Qais Akbar Omar, the author, starts off with describing the old days before the Taliban and the Mujaheedin moved in Afghanistan. He says he had always loved his grandfather, who was an educated scholar and loved to read \\"Afghanistan: In the Path of History\\" by Mir Ghulam. One night, the entire town of Kabul suffered power outage. The author and his family could hear cries of \\"Allah-u-Akbar\\" from far away reverberate in the ears as if he had already heard it before. They have no idea of what it was actually going to turn out to be. In a confused state of manner, Abdul, Qais's father, jumped out of the home and joined the people. It was soon clear: they were all revolting against the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan. Little did they know what they were up to; they in fact asked for the Mujaheedin to arrive and drive out the Russians. The author describes, \\"I had expected to see heroes in uniforms and shiny boots. But they were dressed like villagers in black turbans, the traditional baggy pants called shalwar and the long, tunic-like shirts called kamiz. The very next day, they could hear the rockets firing, roaring above their homes. The roads were stained with the people's blood. Windows and glasses had broken because of the tremendous amount of noise by firing. The Mujaheedin were not the so called \\"holy warriors\\" as the people had thought them to be. They were criminals, and instead of helping the people, they looted them. After a few days, fighting between the various factions took place. There were snipers equipped with guns in the Kob-e- Aliabad mountains that shot anyone who ventured out alone.A Fort of Nine Towers, Pg. 38 Finding it too difficult to stay in their old house, they decide to move to their father's good friend, Haji Noor Sher's home. It was the Qala-e-Noborja across the Sniper mountains, a relatively calmer and peaceful place to live in. They decide to leave Qais's cousin, Wakeel and grandfather behind in the other part of the city. The courtyard was quite luxurious.  Characters  * Grandfather: His name was not disclosed by the author. He is said to be the best companion of Qais and much of the author's early life was spent sitting with him. He was a solitary man of nature; he loved to keep quite and listen. He was an avid reader and read books of all types. His favorite book was Afghanistan: In the Path of History by Mir Ghulam. * Abdul: Qais's father. He ran grandfather's carpet business along with his partner Haji Noor Sher. He plays an important role in Qais's life‚Äîhe was the one to take all of them (mother, Qais and sister) during the war in his old jeep and move about from one place to another, just to save their lives. * Wakeel: Qais's cousin brother and best friend of youth; Wakeel was an ace kite flier. He was known by the local boys as the \\"cruel cutter\\". Wakeel is known in the book for his intelligence, witty thoughts and a good sense of humor. Wakeel eventually dies in the aftermath of war events; which is revealed during the later stages of the book. * Qais: The main protagonist of the book, Qais, is the one who narrates the story. He owned a carpet business in Kabul during the late stages of war. He later sold the looms to women workers who were interested weaving and making some money to earn their livelihood. * Mother: Qais's mother is emotionally weak at heart, and is sympathetic towards Qais. She has her extended family in Mazar-e-Sharif and in the Kunduz province of Afghanistan. She takes care of all her children and had contributed significantly in making Qais think about his future. * Kuchi nomads: Qais's entire family went with the Kuchi nomads of Afghanistan. It was a bitter-sweet experience, as the author says, because they were habituated to be living amidst the luxuries of the city. * Teacher: Qais's carpet teacher was a person born dumb. She was strikingly beautiful and the author had fallen in love with her. Even though she could not speak like others did, she spoke using sign language and gestures that Qais somehow managed to understand. She lived in the house adjacent to home of mother's aunt. Critical reception Qais's debut novel A Fort of Nine Towers have received mostly positive reviews. Critics all over the world have praised the author's sense \\"to weave the story\\". Stephenie Foster from The Huffington Post described it as: > Whether you've read other books about Afghanistan, or not, A Fort of Nine > Towers is worth your time. It documents a riveting and chaotic time, and > gives you a sense of what it was like to be there. Rachel Newcomb, for The Washington Post posted, > The daily struggles of Omar's family to survive endless war, hunger and > poverty demonstrate the remarkable ability of human beings to love and > support one another despite the dire conditions in which they live.

It was composed in 1944 to celebrate the centenary of St Mark's Church, Swindon, and was first performed there in 1945.  History  The Te Deum is one of the standard canticles of Anglican Morning Prayer. Benjamin Britten set it in 1934 (his Te Deum in C). He wrote the Festival Te Deum, scored for treble solo, four-part choir (SATB) and organ, on 8‚Äì9 November 1944. It takes about five minutes to perform. The work was commissioned for the centenary of St Mark's Church, Swindon, an Anglo-Catholic church with a strong choral tradition. It was first performed there during a service on 24 April 1945 by the choir of St Mark's with choristers from three other Swindon churches (St John's, St Saviour's, and St Luke's). The soloist was Peter Titcombe, the organist was G.W. Curnow, and the conductor was J.J. Gale.  Music  Britten wrote the vocal parts for the abilities of a parish church choir, but a demanding organ part. The work begins with the choir singing in unison, imitating the \\"freedom of Gregorian chant\\". The chant sounds as if it is in free time, but is \\"carefully notated in a variety of time signatures\\". The organ provides a contrast with chords in regular time, embellished with \\"pseudo-Baroque ornaments\\". On the text \\"The glorious company of the Apostles praise Thee\\", the voices begin imitation but return to unison. In the middle section the text \\"Thou art the King of Glory, O Christ\\" is exclaimed in fanfare-like motifs in the voices, matched by \\"short dramatic outbursts\\" on the organ. The work ends with a reprise of the organ chords and a treble soloist, joined by the choir, bringing it to a \\"gentle conclusion\\".

It signaled the end of the via Flaminia, which connected the cities of Romagna to Rome, and spans the modern Corso d'Augusto (the ancient decumanus maximus), which led to the beginning of another road, the via Emilia, which ran northwest to Piacenza. Its style is simple but solemn. The central arch, which is of exceptional size, is flanked by two engaged columns with fluted shafts and Corinthian capitals. The four clipei (shields) placed next to the capitals each depict Roman divinities: Jupiter and Apollo on the Roman side, Neptune and Roma facing the city of Rimini. The gate's principal function, aside from functioning as a city gate, was to support the lavish bronze statue of Augustus, depicted driving a quadriga. The main peculiarity of this arch is that the archway is especially large for a gate of the time. The explanation must be the fact that the peaceful policy of Augustus the so-called Pax Romana, made a civic gate that could be closed seem unnecessary, since there was no danger of attack. The battlements on the upper part date to the medieval period (10th century), at which time the city came to be held by the Ghibellines. It remained one of the city gates until the Fascist period, when the city wall was demolished and the arch was left as an isolated monument. Along with the Bridge of Augustus and Tiberius, it is today one of the symbols of Rimini, so important that it appears on the city's coat of arms.Rimini's coat of arms The inscription above the archway reads: See also * Arch of Augustus (disambiguation) for other such arches * List of Roman triumphal arches ReferencesExternal links * The Arch of Augustus on the website of the district Category:Ancient Roman triumphal arches in Italy Category:Rimini Category:Augustus ","title":"Arch of Augustus (Rimini)"},{"id":"41107250","text":"Pat Ryan (4 September 1886 ‚Äì 14 August 1937) was a former Australian rules footballer who played with Carlton in the Victorian Football League (VFL).

This entry discusses the core elements of credit agreements as defined in the National Credit Act, and the consequences of concluding a credit agreement in South Africa.  Definitions of types of credit transactions  It is essential that the meanings of important terms used in the practice of consumer law are clearly understood. Most of the definitions below are obtained from the National Credit Act 34 of 2005 (‚Äúthe Act‚Äù).  Agreement  An ‚Äúagreement‚Äù simply means a contract.  Credit  ‚ÄúCredit‚Äù means a deferral or delay of payment of a sum of money to another person, or a promise to pay money. The critical role of credit in the economy is explained in the August 2004 policy framework of the Department of Trade and Industry: > Credit enables people to have use of a product or service, at a cost > represented by an interest rate, prior to their having paid for that product > or service or, where an item cannot be afforded from a single month‚Äôs > salary, to spread payments over a number of months. This document goes on to describe credit as a ‚Äúdouble-edged sword,‚Äù because of the ‚Äúconsiderable imbalance of power between consumers and credit providers,‚Äù due to poor consumer education levels and knowledge of consumer rights, and inability to enforce such rights through negotiation or legal action: > Credit cannot therefore be seen as a universal basic service to which access > should be extended in the same way as access to water, health care and > electricity. There is a greater need to balance access to credit with > protection for consumers, especially the vulnerable.  Credit provider  A credit provider is the party who supplies goods or services (in terms of an instalment sale agreement, for example), or who pays money (in terms, for example, of a secured or unsecured money loan, overdraft facility, pawn transaction or mortgage loan). The credit provider is often also referred to as ‚Äúthe creditor,‚Äù in particular when steps are taken to recover amounts due from the consumer.  Consumer  A consumer is the party to whom goods or services are sold, or to whom money is loaned in any of the examples referred to above. When steps are taken to recover amounts due, the consumer is often referred to as ‚Äúthe debtor.‚Äù  Credit agreement  An agreement is a credit agreement if it provides for a deferral or delay of payment, and if there is a fee or interest charged for the deferred payment. The Act does not require that a credit agreement be in writing and signed by both parties, although this is implied throughout the Act. A credit agreement may be a credit facility, a credit transaction or a credit guarantee (or a combination of these). These three terms are defined in section 8 of the Act. = Credit facility = A credit facility is an agreement in terms of which a credit provider supplies goods or services, or pays an amount to the consumer. The consumer's obligation to pay the price or repay the money is deferred, in exchange for which the consumer pays interest and fees. Examples of a credit facility are credit advanced * on an overdrawn cheque account in terms of an overdraft facility; or * on a credit card account. = Credit transaction = A ‚Äúcredit transaction‚Äù may refer any one of a number of different types of transactions. Most important for present purposes are the follow  Installment agreements  In terms of instalment agreements, movable goods (like furniture, clothing or a car) are sold, the price is paid in instalments, and the item is delivered to the consumer. The consumer becomes owner only once all instalments have been paid.  Unsecured money loans  Unsecured money loans are usually smaller money loans (micro- loans) re-payable in installments, where the lender is given no security for re-payment of the debt. Micro lending as a category of the NCR usually speaks to credit providers that can borrow a maximum amount of R8 000 for a period of up to 6 months.  Pawn transactions  In terms of pawn transactions, money is lent and the borrower provides an item of property as security, the resale value of which is greater than the loan. The creditor is entitled to sell the property if the money is not repaid by an agreed date, and to keep the proceeds of the sale.  Mortgage agreements  Mortgage agreements are money loans secured by the registration of a mortgage bond over land, the proceeds of which are usually used to buy land or housing.  Secured loans  In terms of secured loans, money is paid, and the credit provider receives a pledge of any movable property or something else of value as security for repayment of the loan.  Leases of movable goods  Leases of movable goods‚Äîthat is, not land or housing‚Äîwould include, for example, a telefax machine or a motor car, with rent being paid in instalments, together with fees and interest. (If interest and fees are not charged, it will not be a credit transaction in terms of the Act). The total instalments will usually amount to the value of the item let. Once all instalments are paid, ownership passes to the consumer. This is contrary to the common law of lease. If, however, the agreement provides that ownership will always remain with the lessor, it will still be a credit transaction in terms of the Act. = Credit guarantees = In terms of a credit guarantee, a third party agrees to pay to a creditor the amount due by a consumer, on demand (as, for example, in the case of suretyship, in terms of which personal security is provided for the debt of another person resulting from an overdrawn cheque account). = Incidental credit agreements = Incidental credit agreements occur when goods or services are provided to a consumer over a period of time and a fee or interest is charged only if payment is not made by an agreed date. Examples include * accounts for municipal services, such as water or electricity; and * sales of clothing where no interest is charged provided that the account is paid by a certain date. Incidental credit agreements do not fall under the definition of credit agreements in the Act. Section 5 sets out the limited provisions of the Act applicable to them. A number of other agreements are not regarded as credit agreements by the Act, including * transactions between a stokvel (a voluntary association involving a rotating financial scheme with entertainment, social or economic functions) and its members; * an insurance policy; and * a lease of immovable property.  National Credit Act  The National Credit Act is a complicated and lengthy piece of legislation that tries to regulate closely every sector of the consumer credit market. The last provisions of the Act became effective on June 1, 2007. The Act repealed the Usury ActAct 73 of 1968. and the Credit Agreements Act,Act 75 of 1980. and bears very little resemblance to these Acts. It represents a clean break from the past. All consumer credit law is contained within the Act, which applies to all credit agreements and all credit providers. The Act has the ambitious and extremely difficult objective of promoting a competitive, efficient and effective credit industry and market which is at the same time fair, transparent, responsible and accessible. The overriding theme of the Act is consumer protection. Section 3 of the Act sets out a number of methods that the Act adopts to achieve this.  Important consumer credit institutions  National Credit Regulator = Much of the responsibility for implementing the purposes of the Act lies with the National Credit Regulator (NCR), which oversees the entire consumer credit industry, including all the functions and responsibilities of the former Micro-finance Regulatory Council (in the micro-lending context). The NCR is an independent organisation governed by a Board, with a Chief Executive Officer who may appoint inspectors and investigators. The NCR has an enormous number of responsibilities. These are set out in great detail in sections 13 to 18 of the Act. It remains to be seen whether or not it will have the necessary capacity to perform all these functions. Its responsibilities include * the promotion and development of a credit market accessible to all; * monitoring and reporting annually certain market trends to the Minister; * conducting research and proposing policies to the Minister regarding the consumer credit industry; * regulating the industry by registering credit providers, credit bureaux and debt counsellors, and suspending or cancelling registration; * enforcing the Act in numerous ways listed in section 15; * promoting public awareness of consumer credit matters in various ways listed in section 16 (consumer education); * engaging with provincial regulatory authorities; * advising the Minister; and * recommending and reporting to the Minister on various aspects of consumer credit practice, policy and legislation. = National Consumer Tribunal = The National Consumer Tribunal is an independent body, separate from the NCR. It has jurisdiction throughout South Africa, and comprises a chairperson and at least ten other members appointed by the President. A tribunal of record, it conducts its proceedings in public in an informal, inquisitorial manner. It applies principles of natural justice, and has the function of ruling on any matter brought before it in terms of the Act. The Act provides rules of practice, procedure, evidence and a list of possible orders in relation to the Tribunal. The powers of the Tribunal are mentioned throughout the Act, the most important of which are * to hear cases of alleged contraventions of the Act, mostly by credit providers; * to impose fines; * to make orders reflecting resolutions agreed in other fora; and * to function as an appeal body. (Decisions of the NCR, for example, may be taken on appeal to the Tribunal.) = Registers = The NCR is required to establish and maintain two important registers: # a register of certain persons; and # a national register of credit agreements.  Register of certain persons  Credit providers, credit bureaux and debt counsellors are required to register with the NCR. Before a credit provider enters into a credit agreement (threshold is R zero) it has to register with the NCR. The NCR has the power to suspend or cancel registration in certain circumstances. Any person may access this register on the NCR website or may obtain a copy of an extract from the register on payment of a fee. Any person may also obtain a copy of a registration certificate on payment of a fee. Credit providers and credit bureaux were required to register with the NCR by July 28, 2006. Debt counsellors may register at any time.  National register of credit agreements  The NCR may be required by the Minister to establish a single national register of outstanding credit agreements, but it has not done so yet. Once established, credit providers will have to submit the following information in relation to every credit agreement: * names and addresses of the credit provider and the consumer; * the registration number of the credit provider; * the identity number of the consumer; * the principal debt under a credit agreement; * the credit limit under a credit facility; and * the amount and schedule of the monthly installments payable. Certain information regarding credit agreements entered into prior to the coming into effect of the Act must also be provided. This register will be accessible to any person on application in the prescribed form. It will also provide a way of monitoring South Africa's consumer debt levels, which the NCR is required to do. = Credit bureau = A credit bureau is an entity that is engaged for payment in the business of receiving reports or investigating credit applications and agreements, payment history or patterns, and other consumer credit information. Credit bureau are also in the business of compiling and maintaining data and issuing reports concerning consumers based on this data. As indicated above, credit bureaux were required to register with the NCR by July 28, 2006. Credit bureaux assist credit providers with information that could prevent over-indebtedness of consumers and the granting of reckless credit. = Debt counselors = Debt counselors are not defined in the Act. The NCR's ‚ÄúDebt Counsellor Training Program Learners‚Äô Guide‚Äù describes the debt counselor as ‚Äúa registrant who is required to do certain tasks stipulated in the Act‚Äîincluding facilitating, investigating, and recommending solutions for over-indebtedness.‚Äù Debt counselors have a number of functions which appear throughout the Act. The main role of debt counselors is to evaluate consumers‚Äô indebtedness (upon referral of the consumer by a court, or upon application by the consumer directly to the debt counselor). The debt counselor may then recommend to the court * that the consumer is over- indebted; * that one or more credit agreements are reckless (and should be set aside or suspended); and * that the consumer's debts be re-structured. This procedure is explained in more detail below. Debt counselors must apply to the NCR to be registered as such. The Act contains a lengthy list of reasons for disqualification as a debt counsellor. In addition, the Regulations provide that debt counsellors must * have a Grade-12 or equivalent qualification; * complete an NCR-approved debt counselling course; * have a minimum of 2 years‚Äô working experience in certain fields; and * show an ability to manage their own finances, and to provide counselling or transfer skills. = Consumer courts = Consumer courts are tribunals established by provincial legislation. The Act allows these courts to be used in various circumstances. There is only one instance where these courts operate at the same level as the National Consumer Tribunal, which is when the NCR refers a complaint to it. Most provinces have introduced their own legislation, but only Gauteng presently has a properly-functioning consumer court. = Ombuds = The Act uses the gender-neutral term ‚Äúombud‚Äù (often known as ombudsman). The Act provides that certain disputes between a financial institution (like a bank) and a consumer, arising from a credit agreement, may be referred to the relevant ombud. The ombud will then act as mediator between the institution and the consumer with a complaint.  South African SME Finance  SASFA an association of SME financing companies was recently launched given the rapid growth of the SME Funding Marketplace in South Africa. The primary aim of the association is to lobby for the establishment of a self regulating industry body and industry standards to ensure SME customers are fairly treated and the reputation and sustainability of the unregulated SME Finance Sector is maintained. SASFA board of trustees has representatives from SME Financing companies, namely Bridgement, Lulalend, Merchant Capital, Transaction Capital Business Solutions and Retail Company.  Conclusion of credit agreements = Pre-agreement disclosure  Before concluding a credit agreement, the credit provider must give to the consumer, free of charge, a statement and quotation in the form prescribed by the Regulations (Form 20 to the Regulations, in the case of small credit agreements). No agreement is entered into at this stage; the consumer does not have to sign anything or pay any fee. This is a new development in the law, designed to protect consumers. This document must contain the financial details of the proposed agreement (like the amount of credit provided, the number and amount of installments payable, interest and other fees, deposit required and credit insurance). Consumers must accept or reject the quotation within five days, giving them a chance to shop around for better or cheaper credit. Once the consumer has accepted the quotation, the credit agreement itself can then be concluded.  Form and contents of credit agreements  The form of the document that records the credit agreement is prescribed by regulation, and varies for different-size credit agreements. The details required for a small credit agreement (a principal debt of less than R15 000) are set out in Form 20.2 to the Regulations. This is not really a form, but rather a framework for the minimum contents of the agreement. These details include * the parties‚Äô personal particulars; * the financial details of the agreement (similar to those required for the pre-agreement disclosure above); and * certain of the consumer's statutory rights and duties (discussed below). The credit provider must give to the consumer, free of charge, a copy of the signed credit agreement (in paper form or printable electronic form). Credit agreements may be altered only in very specific circumstances, most importantly in relation to the reduction or increase in credit limits.  Rights and duties of consumers and credit providers  Many consumer rights are contained in the Act, but very few rights for credit providers. (By contrast, credit providers have many duties.) The Act is biased towards consumers, because it seeks to redress imbalances inherent in our common law. This is not unusual for legislation of this kind.  Right to apply for credit and non-discrimination  Every adult person has the right to apply for credit, but no-one has the right to be granted credit. A credit grantor may choose to refuse credit for reasonable business reasons, but may not unfairly discriminate against a consumer relative to other consumers on the grounds of race, religion, pregnancy, marital status, ethnic or social origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, disability, culture, language, etc. A consumer may ask for reasons for the refusal of credit, which must be given by the credit provider in writing.  Right to understandable language  The consumer has the right to be given a quotation and credit agreement in an official language that he reads or understands, to the extent that this is reasonable. Any documents where no form is prescribed must be in plain language (language which an ordinary consumer with average literacy skills and minimal credit experience will understand).  Rights regarding information held by credit bureau Credit bureaux have an important role. For example, they provide credit providers with information on the creditworthiness of consumers. This information could, of course, be damaging to consumers. Credit bureaux are therefore obliged to check with other sources that the information given to them by credit providers is correct. Consumers have the right to have information relating to rescinded judgments expunged (removed) from the records of credit bureaux. Likewise, a consumer who has satisfied all his obligations in terms of a debt rearrangement has the right to have the fact that a debt rearrangement previously existed removed from these records. A credit provider must advise a debtor before reporting unfavourable information to a credit bureau. Any person may challenge the accuracy of any information reported to or held by a credit bureau. The credit bureau or NCR is then obliged to investigate at no charge and rectify any incorrect information. The regulations prescribe maximum periods of time that different categories of consumer credit information may be retained by credit bureaux. For example, civil judgments may be retained for the earliest of * five years; * until date of rescission by a court; or * abandonment by credit provider. Anyone has the right to a free credit bureau report once per year. After that it will cost R20 per enquiry. Two important credit bureaux, with contact numbers, are: ‚Ä¢ ITC ‚Äî 086 148 2482 (Website: www.mycredit.co.za). ‚Ä¢ Experian ‚Äî 086 110 5665 (Website: www.creditexpert.co.za)  Protection against marketing practices  The Act contains a number of rules in this regard: * The advertising and marketing of credit must contain prescribed information on the cost of credit (interest and all other charges). * Negative-option marketing (in terms of which an agreement will automatically come into existence unless the consumer declines an offer) is not permitted. * Advertisements must not be misleading, fraudulent or deceptive. * Credit providers may not harass anyone, or try to coerce or persuade anyone to apply for credit. * Credit sales at a person's home are strictly prohibited, unless ** the sale of credit occurs during a pre-arranged visit for that purpose by the consumer; or ** the provision of credit is incidental to the sale of goods or services. * A credit provider may require that a consumer have credit life insurance during the existence of a credit agreement, but has a duty to ensure that suitable options for insurance cover are offered to the consumer.  Right to confidentiality and privacy  Credit bureau are required to protect the confidentiality of consumer credit information that they hold or report on. Credit providers must also present to consumers the options of being excluded from telemarketing campaigns, marketing or customer lists sold or distributed and mass distribution of e-mail or SMS messages.  Right of cooling-off  In certain circumstances, consumers may terminate agreements (in writing and properly delivered) within five business days of signing them. This cooling- off right applies only to leases and instalment agreements that are concluded at a location other than the registered business premises of the credit provider. Typically, this right will apply to credit sales on instalments (as in the cases of cars, books, household appliances) concluded at the consumer's home or place of work. The consumer must return the goods bought, and the credit provider must refund amounts paid by the consumer within seven days of termination, less the following: * reasonable costs of return and repair of damages after sale; * rent for use of the goods, unless they are still in their original packaging; and * compensation for depreciation in value of the goods (by agreement or court order only).  Early settlement and repayments  Consumers are entitled to settle their debts in advance at any time, with or without advance notice, after requesting a statement from the credit provider of the amount required to settle the account. No settlement charge is payable for small agreements; interest and other fees are payable only until date of settlement. This means that a consumer may request from the credit provider the balance due, pay the entire amount, and not be penalised for doing so. This, however, does not apply to large agreements such as mortgage bonds. If a consumer wishes to settle a bond he must first give notice of cancellation for a period of three months to the credit provider. When a mortgage bond is cancelled, the consumer will be liable for bond cancellation costs. Consumers may prepay any amount due under a credit agreement (e.g. instalments due) and credit providers are obliged to accept such amounts, even if they are not due. Such payments are used for unpaid interest and fees first, and then to reduce the principal debt.  Surrender of goods  A consumer may, at any time, return to a credit provider goods that are subject to a credit agreement, whether or not the consumer is in default. The credit provider must then sell the goods and use the proceeds to settle the account. In terms of the former Credit Agreements Act, this procedure applied only when the consumer was in default. This new provision gives the consumer an extraordinary right, enabling him to rid himself of the agreement when he chooses to. The following procedure must be followed if the consumer elects to enforce this right: # The consumer must notify the credit provider in writing of the termination of the agreement, and return the goods to the credit provider. # If the credit provider is already in possession of the goods, the consumer may require the credit provider to sell the goods. # The credit provider must notify the consumer within ten days of the estimated value of the goods. # Once the consumer receives this notice of estimated value, he may withdraw his notice of termination within ten days, and resume possession of the goods, unless he is in default under the agreement. # If the consumer does not respond to the credit provider's notice of estimated value within ten days, the credit provider must sell the goods as soon as possible for the best price possible. # After the goods have been sold, the credit provider must credit or debit the consumer's account with the proceeds of the sale, less the reasonable costs of the sale. # The credit provider must give to the consumer a notice indicating the settlement amount before the sale, the amount realised by the sale, and the net proceeds of the sale (after deduction of default charges and the costs of the sale). # If the result of the sale is a credit balance on the account, this amount must be repaid to the consumer. If there is a debit balance, the credit provider may demand and, if necessary, sue the consumer for the outstanding balance. # If the consumer is not satisfied that the goods were sold as soon as possible or for the best price possible, he may attempt to resolve the dispute with the credit provider, or through alternative-dispute methods, or through referral to the National Consumer Tribunal. The Tribunal may award the consumer an additional amount if this is deemed necessary.  Statements of account  The Act contains detailed provisions regarding statements of account. The Regulations prescribe the form and content of statements in the case of small agreements. Credit providers must deliver to consumers periodic statements of account, usually once a month (but once every two months for instalment sale agreements). Credit providers are also obliged to provide consumers with statements of account on request, at no charge. The consumer may choose how the statement must be delivered: * orally (in person, or by telephone); or * in writing (in person, by SMS, by mail, by fax or by email‚Äîprovided that the credit provider has these facilities). Credit providers need not give written statements on demand more than once every three months.  Right to apply for debt review and re- structuring of debt  These provisions are explained in detail below.  Duty to report location of goods  In the case of certain credit agreements (typically installment agreements), the consumer becomes the owner only once the full purchase price has been paid, and the credit provider has a right to repossession on breach of the agreement. Until then, the credit provider has an interest in the whereabouts of the goods. The consumer has a duty to inform the credit provider of any of the following changes: * changes of business or residential address; * changes of the premises where the goods are kept; and * changes of the name and address of any other person who has possession of the goods. The consumer must also give to the credit provider or sheriff, on request, the address where the goods are kept, and the name and address of the landlord of the premises.  Rights of credit providers  The credit provider's most important rights are * the right to enforce the agreement; * the right to receive payment of the credit extended, together with agreed interest and fees; and, * upon breach of contract, the right to cancel the agreement and recover any goods sold. A credit provider may suspend a credit facility (like a credit card or cheque account) at any time if the consumer is in default, or otherwise close the facility on ten business days‚Äô notice. A credit provider who has incurred costs in the attachment of goods while enforcing a debt may ask a court to order the consumer to pay the costs of attachment. The court will make such an order only if the consumer provided false information about his address or the location of the goods.  Duties of credit providers  Every consumer right entails a duty on the part of credit providers. The duties on credit providers are onerous; they provide many administrative burdens. Some of the credit provider's more important duties are * to register as a credit provider once it has 100 credit agreements or a book debt of R500,000; * to make a credit assessment of the consumer; * to give to the consumer a pre-agreement statement and quotation; * to give to the consumer a copy of the agreement; * to give to the consumer periodic statements of account, and further statements on request; * to protect the confidentiality of information about consumers; * to report to the NCR, or to a credit bureau, the details of every credit agreement concluded, as well as the termination of the agreement when the debt has been paid in full; * to propose to the consumer to seek advice when the consumer is in default; * to maintain records of credit applications, agreements and accounts as prescribed in the Regulations; * to sell goods subject to a credit agreement as soon as possible, for the best price possible, should the consumer request it, and to provide the consumer with a financial statement.  Over-indebtedness and reckless credit  Over-indebtedness is frequently a disastrous consequence of the high cost of credit. Levenstein summarises this state of affairs: > Unfortunately, in South Africa, too many people with too little money have > been given too much credit. This ultimately leads to over-indebtedness which > results in a never-ending circle of frustration for the consumer who can > never repay his debts.Without Prejudice (2006) 6 at page 50. The Department of Trade and Industry's 2004 policy framework describes credit as ‚Äúa double-edged sword:‚Äù > Whilst credit allows access to products or services that cannot be acquired > out of a single month‚Äôs income, it can also be a dangerous instrument that > can lead to high levels of debt and indebtedness. > It is quite easy for credit to lead to financial hardship and destroy a > household‚Äôs wealth. Taking on extra loans in order to pay back existing > loans can lead people into a debt spiral out of which it may be difficult to > escape. Over-indebtedness has a negative impact on families and has in some > extreme cases even led to family suicides. Over-indebtedness further has an > impact upon the workplace, can lead to de-motivation, absenteeism and even a > propensity to commit theft. A Human Sciences Research Council survey on household indebtedness in South Africa showed that, in 2000, over sixty per cent of the regular disposable income of households earning less than R5,000 per year was used to service debt: that is, to pay interest on debt. Levels of indebtedness increased by more than 200 per cent between 1995 and 2000 in the poorest households, with incomes of less than R25,000 per year. This trend seems to have continued since. It has been argued that consumers are often to blame for allowing themselves to become over-indebted by unwisely borrowing too much money, or by buying too much on credit. This is usually the result of economic desperation and lack of understanding of the difficulties of repaying or servicing their debt. Credit providers are, however, often to blame for recklessly giving too much credit to consumers who cannot afford to service their debt. One of the most important objectives of the Act is to combat over-indebtedness and reckless credit granting. Sections 78 to 88 of the Act contain detailed, far- reaching and extremely important provisions in this regard.  Over- indebtedness  A consumer is over-indebted if the available information indicates that the consumer is unable to pay the amounts due under a credit agreement in time. When deciding whether or not a consumer is over-indebted, a court must consider the consumer's * financial means (primarily income); * financial prospects (income-earning potential); * other debt; and * history of debt repayment. In any court proceedings, a court may declare a consumer to be over-indebted. Alternatively, a debt counselor may have a role in one of two ways: # A court may refer a consumer to a debt counselor for a recommendation as to whether or not the consumer is over-indebted. # A consumer may apply in person to a debt counselor to be declared over-indebted (although this is not permitted if the credit provider has already taken steps to recover the debt). The consumer must apply by completing and submitting Form 16 to the Regulations. The consumer must provide details of the debt and pay a fee of R50 to the debt counselor. A debt review must then take place. The debt counselor must notify all credit providers and credit bureau listed in the application; they must co-operate fully with the debt counselor. The debt counselor must then evaluate the consumer's indebtedness. The evaluation can have one of three possible results: # The consumer is over-indebted. The debt counselor may recommend to the magistrate's court that one or more credit agreements be declared reckless, and/or that one or more of the consumer's debts be re-arranged (for example, by extending the period of a contract and requiring smaller payments, and/or by postponing the dates of payments). # The consumer is not over-indebted, but is having difficulty paying his debts on time. The counselor may recommend that the consumer and credit providers try voluntarily to agree on a plan of debt re-arrangement, which may be filed as a consent order in court. If no agreement can be reached, the debt counselor may make a recommendation to the court, which may make an appropriate order. # The consumer is not over-indebted, and the application is rejected. The consumer may then apply himself to the magistrate's court for a debt review by completing and submitting Form 18 to the Regulations. A credit agreement may be declared to be reckless only if the consumer is found to be over- indebted. If the debt counselor finds that the consumer is not over-indebted, but is of the view that one or more credit agreements are reckless, these agreements may not be declared to be reckless. Credit providers may therefore still enforce credit agreements that are in fact reckless, but they may not be formally declared to be reckless. While this process is under way, a consumer may not use his credit facility (for example, his credit card); nor may he enter into another credit agreement. A credit provider who enters into a credit agreement with a consumer while the consumer is under debt review runs the risk of the credit agreement's being declared reckless credit. Also, if a consumer is in default under a credit agreement, and the credit provider has already commenced debt-enforcement proceedings, that agreement may not be subject to the debt review. This could encourage credit providers to start proceedings to recover debt earlier than they otherwise might have done. The debt-review procedure might well be used by shrewd consumers to delay or avoid payment under a credit agreement. This is so because there are many provisions in the Act which limit the rights of credit providers to enforce debts under review. However, if the consumer is in default under a credit agreement subject to review, the credit provider may give notice to the consumer, the debt counsellor and the NCR to terminate the review. This notice may be given at least sixty days after the date of application for debt review: that is, if the debt-review process is dragging on too long. The credit provider may then take steps to enforce the agreement. The court then has the discretion to order that the debt review resume if appropriate. An application for debt review by a consumer has serious implications for the consumer as to his creditworthiness and the conclusion of future agreements.  Reckless credit  A credit provider must not enter into a reckless credit agreement with a consumer. Before entering into a credit agreement, a credit provider must first take reasonable steps to assess the consumer's * general understanding of the risks and costs of the proposed credit; * debt repayment history; and * existing financial means, prospects and obligations. A credit agreement is reckless * if, at the time it was concluded, the credit provider failed to conduct the necessary assessment (described above), irrespective of what the outcome of the assessment might have been; or * if the credit provider entered into the agreement despite the fact that information available to the credit provider after the assessment showed that ** the consumer did not generally understand the consumer's risk and the costs or obligations under the proposed credit agreement; or ** the conclusion of the agreement would cause the consumer to become over-indebted. This provision helps to prevent credit providers from taking shortcuts by simply accepting seemingly creditworthy debtors at face value. A credit provider may use its own assessment mechanisms, provided these are fair and objective. The consumer, in turn, must fully and truthfully provide the requested information. Failure by the consumer to do so could provide the credit provider with a complete defence to an allegation of reckless credit granting. In any proceedings that concern credit agreements, a court may declare that a credit agreement is reckless, in which case the court may make an order * setting aside all or part of the consumer's rights and obligations under that agreement (so that, for example, the consumer may not have to repay a loan or pay the instalments on a credit sale at all); or * suspending the force and effect of the agreement for a specific period. If a court declares that a specific credit agreement is reckless, it must also decide whether or not the consumer is over-indebted at the time of the court proceedings. All the debt of the consumer must be considered. If the court finds the consumer to be over-indebted, it may make an order * suspending the force and effect of that agreement for a specific period; and * restructuring the consumer's obligations under any other credit agreements.See above. While an agreement is suspended (not set aside), * the consumer is not required to pay anything in terms of the credit agreement; * no interest or fee may be debited to the consumer; and * the credit provider's rights in terms of the agreement are unenforceable. After the period of suspension ends, all the parties‚Äô rights and obligations are revived and become enforceable again. However, interest or fees that would normally have accrued during the period of suspension may not be charged to the consumer. This is a drastic remedy indeed. The reckless-credit provisions do not apply to a number of credit agreements, including * a school loan; * a student loan; and * an emergency loan. A student loan, for example, could be granted to an unemployed consumer, who might not have a credit record (so that the credit provider does not know his payment history). The consumer might not be creditworthy, and there is no security. The nature of these agreements excludes them from being reckless lending. The negative results for credit providers of either * contracting with over-indebted consumers; or * concluding reckless credit agreements are serious. Many of the provisions are designed to penalise credit providers. Credit providers will be very careful to reduce the risk of bad debt. These provisions are therefore likely to reduce over-indebtedness and reckless credit granting, at least in the formal sector. A negative result for consumers, however, could be that credit grantors will be much more reluctant to grant credit in the future, and that, therefore, fewer people will be able to access credit. Further, this could lead to an increase in the number of unregistered and illegal credit providers.  The cost of credit  It is critical that one understand the full implications of the new cost-of-credit provisions in the National Credit Act and Regulations.  Interest rates until 1 June 2007  Until June 1, 2007, the Usury Act (which has now been repealed by the National Credit Act) prescribed limits on the interest rates that credit providers could charge. Until this date, the maximum interest rate was twenty per cent per year on all credit agreements up to R10,000 and seventeen per cent per year on credit agreements over R10,000. However, registered micro-lenders were made exempt from the Usury Act from 1992, meaning that they were entitled to charge whatever interest rates they liked. This resulted in exorbitant interest rates, with micro-lenders charging typically thirty per cent per month (or 360 per cent per year)‚Äîeighteen times more than the limit of twenty per cent per year for other credit. Because of the enormous profits that micro-lenders could make, the industry spiralled out of control, growing rapidly year-on- year. In the three years between September 2003 and August 2006, for example, industry disbursements more than doubled. The industry grew by an average of over thirty per cent per year. For the twelve months ending August 2006, the total Rand-value of loans disbursed in the registered micro-finance sector was over R30,000,000,000.  The socio-economic impact of excessive interest rates  Excessive interest rates have caused terrible socio-economic hardships and suffering for low-income individuals and communities. A high percentage of personal income is used to service micro-lending debt, leaving very little of borrowers‚Äô personal income to pay for other household expenses. Borrowers on thirty-day loans in particular are very soon caught in debt traps from which they are unable to escape. Tens of billions are lost to lower- income communities in the form of interest on micro-loans every year, contributing to the perpetuation of poverty. Levels of indebtedness are high and appear to be increasing. The problem of over-indebtedness is made worse by high levels of consumption finance and consumer ignorance and illiteracy. (32 per cent of the adult population of South Africa were functionally illiterate in 2001.) By allowing the micro-lending industry to function without legislated and enforced interest-rate limits since 1992, the Government effectively made possible the exploitation of the ignorance of lower-income communities, which arguably amounted to legislated economic abuse.  The cost of credit in terms of the National Credit Act  The National Credit Act prescribes limits on interest rates for all forms of credit, including micro- loans. However, the Act introduces other fees (the initiation fee and the service fee) which cause the total cost of credit to remain extremely high. No longer is it sufficient to consider only interest rates. Interest rates, initiation fees and service fees must all be carefully calculated in order to work out the total cost of credit for borrowers. The new cost-of-credit provisions came into force on June 1, 2007. = Interest = Different interest rates apply to different categories of credit agreements:  Short-term credit transactions  ‚ÄúShort-term credit transactions‚Äù are agreements up to R8,000 repayable within six months; usually these are micro- loans. The maximum interest rate permitted is five per cent per month, or sixty per cent per year.  Unsecured credit transactions  ‚ÄúUnsecured credit transactions‚Äù are agreements for which there is no security for the debt at all (like loans or sales on credit). There is no limit on the amount or repayment period. Unsecured agreements for more than R8,000 and/or repayable over more than six months fall into this category. The maximum interest rate is linked to the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) Repurchase Rate ((Repurchase Rate x 2.2) + 20% per year), and is currently 39,8 per cent per year (based on the current repo rate of nine per cent). This maximum rate is nearly double the maximum permissible rate in terms of the Usury Act that applied until May 31, 2007 (20 per cent per year). Sales of furniture, for example, could now cost twice as much to service.  Credit facilities  Secured bank loans, credit card or cheque accounts fall under the category ‚Äúcredit facility.‚Äù The maximum interest rate is also linked to the SARB Bank Repurchase Rate, and is currently 29.8 per cent per year.  Developmental credit agreements  ‚ÄúDevelopmental credit agreements‚Äù are credit agreements entered into to develop a small business, an educational loan, or a loan for purposes of building low-cost housing. The maximum interest rate is 38.8% per year.  Mortgage bond agreements  For mortgage bond agreements, the maximum interest rate is 24.9 per cent per year. = The initiation fee = The initiation fee is intended to cover the costs of initiating a credit agreement, although it is not clear exactly what costs the fee is intended to cover. It is a once-off payment made by the consumer on conclusion of the credit agreement or payable in instalments (as a separate loan attracting interest). The maximum initiation fee in terms of the Regulations is R150 per credit agreement, plus ten per cent of the amount of the agreement in excess of R1,000, but never to exceed R1,000. Also, the initiation fee may never exceed fifteen per cent of the principal debt. Examples of the calculation of maximum initiation fees for different-size credit agreements. It will be extremely difficult for consumers to find the necessary cash to pay the initiation fee up front at a time when they are taking out a loan precisely because they are in need of cash. Most lenders will thus be unable to afford to pay the initiation fee on taking out a loan, particularly in the case of the very poor borrowing for consumption purposes. These people will thus be forced to allow the initiation fee to be capitalised and re-paid, probably in the same number of instalments as the initial loan, and subject to the same interest rate as the initial loan. The result will be that the effective monthly cost of credit will increase. = The service fee = The service fee is defined as a fee that may be charged periodically (usually monthly) by a credit provider in connection with the routine administrative cost of maintaining a credit agreement. The maximum service fee in terms of the Regulations is R50 per month, or R600 per year. The same ‚Äúflat-rate‚Äù maximum service fee of R50 is applicable to all categories and sizes of credit agreements. It appears that the service fee was standardised in order to simplify the application of the Act, justifiable on the basis that every loan, no matter what its size, needs to be administered. The effect of the flat-rate service fee of R50 per month on different size loans in terms of South African law, shown as a percentage of the loan amount. The smaller the loan, the more expensive will be the service fee relative to the loan. When this cost is shown as a percentage, it is clear that the service fee adds significantly to the cost of the loan, increasing rapidly with smaller and smaller loan amounts. The ‚Äúflat-rate‚Äù service fee of R50 per month is exorbitant in the case of small loans of less than R1,000 and is still too high in the case of loans up to R5,000. This result is so unfair that borrowers of very small loans (who are almost invariably from the poorest communities) will be discriminated against. The Act itself provides that the service fee must vary relative to the principal debt: that is, that it should be higher for bigger loans, and lower for smaller loans. This is not so. The Regulations should be amended to set the service fee at a percentage of the loan amount, subject to both a minimum and a maximum rand amount (as is the case for the initiation fee). Alternatively, the service fee should be scrapped on smaller credit agreements, and the maximum interest rate increased if necessary. If the service fee is not amended or scrapped, then it should be challenged in court. = Maximum limits and probable market costs = The prescribed interest rates and fees are maximum amounts only. The Department of Trade and Industry hopes that the credit industry will not ‚Äújump to the maximum rates‚Äù, and has said that it has the power to adjust these rates quickly if necessary. The micro-lending industry in particular was born and grew on the strength of exorbitant interest rates, and many micro-lenders will struggle to stay in business with the new limits in place. It is therefore very likely that most lenders will charge the maximum rates of interest and fees to keep their profits as high as possible. Bigger lenders such as banks, on the other hand, are able to afford to be competitive, and are likely to charge lower rates. = The danger of masking the total cost of credit = The drastic reduction in interest rates has the effect of masking or obscuring the true total cost of credit when the initiation and service fees are added. It is possible that these fees could to a large extent remain hidden, with the emphasis being placed on interest rates (which are more familiar to consumers) when products are marketed. The fees help to keep interest rates lower, which makes credit look cheaper, when in fact credit may not be cheaper. The skewing of credit costs away from interest and towards fees (which are not familiar to consumers) will increase the chances of consumers‚Äô being misled as to the actual cost of credit. Many will be lured into borrowing money which will cost much more than they had initially expected. It is essential that paralegals understand the danger of this masking of the true cost of credit, in order to be able to warn their clients of this danger. = The combined impact of interest, the initiation fee and the service fee = The total cost of credit (for either short-term or unsecured loans) applied to a number of loan amounts and loan periods. The total cost of credit (for either short-term or unsecured loans) is applied here to a number of loan amounts and loan periods. The total monthly cost of credit is indicated in rands; this rand amount is indicated as a monthly percentage of the initial loan. This monthly percentage gives the most accurate possible indication of the total cost of credit in each case. The annual cost may be obtained by multiplying these figures by twelve. It is assumed for the purposes of these calculations that the maximum rates of interest and fees are charged, for the reasons explained above. It is also assumed that the total initiation fee is charged to the borrower and capitalised: that is to say, is paid off over the same period as the loan, at the same interest rate (five per cent per month if it is a short-term loan, or 3.3 per cent per month if it is an unsecured loan). If the initiation fee were regarded as a separate loan, it would attract its own initiation and service fees, which would make the initiation fee even more expensive. For the sake of simplicity, interest is not charged on unpaid interest and other fees (although this is permitted by the Act), which would make the total cost of credit even more expensive. The new credit limits have a negative impact on smaller loans. The smaller the loan, the more expensive it is. A one-month loan of R500 will cost about the same as the typical thirty per cent per month charged prior to the Act. Smaller loans will be even more expensive than that. A R200 loan will cost 46 per cent per month (552 per cent per year), which is more than nine times the maximum interest of five per cent per month. The positive impact of capped interest rates, furthermore, is negated by the high maximum initiation and service fees. The impact of the initiation and service fees on smaller loans amounts to a skewing of the cost of credit away from interest and towards these fees, so that interest decreases relative to these fees. This skewing has the dangerous effect of masking the true cost of credit from the consumer, and of misleading the consumer. A more equitable result could be achieved by removing or reducing the initiation and service fees, reducing the maximum permissible interest rate, and reducing the maximum size amount of short-term credit transactions. This will require amendments to the Regulations.  The socio-economic consequences of the new cost of credit  The new structure for costing of credit will work best for the biggest credit advances, in excess of R8,000. The cost of credit on agreements of less than R1,000 is comparable with the typical thirty per cent per month charged with no interest limits on small loans, The vast majority of borrowers of micro- loans are from low-income groups. The poorest households carry the greatest debt-servicing burden. Low-income individuals and communities who borrow small amounts are therefore likely to continue to suffer the same devastating socio- economic hardships referred to above, contributing to the perpetuation of poverty. Borrowers of one-month loans are most vulnerable, since these loans are much more expensive than other short-term loans. Low-income borrowers are usually unable to afford to pay back these loans at the end of the month; repeated loans have often to be taken out to fund in full the re-payment of previous loans. Borrowers are caught in debt spirals and subsequent debt traps, with the disastrous consequence that borrowers in effect remain permanently indebted. The new cost of credit, applied to two examples. In each case, the cost of credit is calculated as follows: interest at 5% per month + initiation fee at 15% of loan amount (+ 5% interest per month) + service fee (always R50). In Example A, by Month 2 the loan repayment (R840) has already exceeded the old-age pension of R820. In Example B, the loan repayment in Month 3 almost exceeds the total wage. These examples confirm that debt spirals and debt traps will continue to occur on a wide scale when the new cost of credit is applied, and could prove to be one of its greatest dangers.  Conclusion  The National Credit Act has made great strides towards consumer protection, and the new limits on interest rates will provide welcome relief for many borrowers. The combined effect of interest, the initiation fee and the service fee will, however, cause the cost of credit on small loans to remain exorbitant. This will have a devastating negative impact on poorer individuals and communities.  Legal remedies provided by the Act  The Act provides only a relatively short list of offences that attract criminal penalties. By contrast, the Usury Act provided that any person who contravenes any provision of the Act commits an offence. Thus, for example, it was a criminal offence to charge interest higher than the Usury Act maximum, which is no longer the case. However, the Act does provide a number of civil legal remedies for consumers, some of which are drastic departures from previous law. The most important of these remedies are outlined below.  Unlawful credit agreements  Section 89 lists a number of credit agreements that are unlawful, including * an agreement with a consumer who is a minor unassisted by a guardian; * an agreement with a person who has been declared mentally unfit; * an agreement with a person under an administration order without the administrator's consent; * an agreement resulting from negative-option marketing (explained above); * an agreement with an unregistered credit provider who was supposed to be registered (unless application for registration is made within thirty days after the credit agreement was concluded);See above for how to establish whether or not a credit provider is registered. and * an agreement with a credit provider who was subject to a notice by the NCR to stop extending credit. If a credit agreement is found to be unlawful, a court must order * that the credit agreement is void; * that the credit provider refund to the consumer any monies paid by the consumer, with interest; and * that the credit provider's rights to recover monies paid or goods delivered to the consumer be cancelled or forfeited to the State (if the court is of the view that the consumer would otherwise be unjustifiably enriched). The credit provider will not get back the money lent or property sold, and the court does not have a discretion to order this. This is a drastic remedy and a departure from the common law. It was not previously available in the case of unregistered micro-lenders, and is a significant new remedy readily available to consumers. Thus, for example, a court will be able to declare a loan from an unregistered micro-lender to be void (if the Act requires the micro-lender to be registered), and order the micro-lender to refund all instalments paid, with interest. Furthermore, the court must order that the loan amount paid to the consumer be retained by the borrower or forfeited to the State. The amount loaned is therefore lost to the unregistered micro-lender altogether.  Unlawful provisions of credit agreements  Section 90 lists numerous provisions of credit agreements (as opposed to the entire agreementss 89.) that are unlawful and not permitted. They are too many to list here. The list is broadly-worded and far-reaching; many of the provisions will probably be open to a wide range of interpretations, which is likely to lead to uncertainty. For example, a provision is unlawful if its general purpose or effect is to defeat the purposes or policies of the Act, or to ‚Äúdeceive‚Äù the consumer. Further, a provision is unlawful * if it avoids a credit provider's obligation or duty in terms of the Act; * if it sets aside or overrides the effect of any provision of the Act; * if it authorises the credit provider to do anything that is unlawful in terms of the Act, or to fail to do anything that is required in terms of the Act; * if it waives or deprives a consumer of a right afforded by the Act; * if it waives any common-law rights applicable to the credit agreement; * if it expresses the consumer's consent to a pre-determined value of costs of enforcement of the agreement; * if it expresses the consumer's consent to the jurisdiction of the High Court, or any court that would normally not have jurisdiction for reasons of its geographical location; * if it provides for the consumer's depositing an identity document, credit or debit or access card, or providing a PIN; * if it authorises a person acting on behalf of the credit provider to enter premises to repossess goods; or * if it contains an undertaking to sign in advance any documentation relating to the enforcement of the agreement (like a consent to judgment or emoluments- attachment order). An unlawful provision is void. Whenever a court has a matter before it which concerns a credit agreement that contains an unlawful provision, the court may * sever (remove) the unlawful provision from the credit agreement; * alter the provision to render it lawful; or * even declare the whole credit agreement unlawful and make orders similar to those provided for unlawful credit agreements, set out above (another major departure from the common law). The consumer alleging the unlawful provision is entitled to apply to court for orders in these terms. Thus, for example, if a credit agreement for the sale of furniture provides for interest or fees in excess of the maximum amounts permissible, a court must declare the offending provisions to be void and enforce the remainder of the agreement. However, it seems that the court may be able to declare the entire agreement void, order the furniture shop to refund all amounts paid, and order that the furniture sold be retained by the borrower or forfeited to the State.  In duplum rule  The Act has codified the in duplum rule for the first time in South Africa's legislative history, and extended the rule further to include all credit costs. This rule states that, while a consumer is in default, all credit costs will stop being added to the debt when their total equals the unpaid balance of the principal debt. It is likely that increased use will be made of the rule since it has been legislated. It must be remembered, however, that it will apply only when the consumer is in default.  Reckless credit and over- indebtedness  Other legal remedies for consumers already discussed above include * a court order declaring a loan agreement to be reckless, which could result in the setting aside of all or part of the borrower's rights and obligations under the agreement, or the suspension of the force and effect of the agreement for a determined period; and * a finding that a consumer was over-indebted at the time of the conclusion of the agreement, in which event the court may order the suspension of the force and effect of the agreement and the restructuring of the consumer's obligations under any other credit agreements.  Dispute settlement and debt enforcement = Dispute settlement  If the Act has been contravened, a person has one of two options: # to lodge a complaint with the NCR; or # to make use of one of the other dispute-resolution mechanisms established by the Act. = Lodging a complaint with the NCR = The Act contains detailed provisions regarding the role of the NCR.ss 136-141. Complaints to the NCR must be lodged by completing and submitting to the NCR Form 29 to the Regulations. The NCR may resolve complaints lodged with it; the resolution may become a consent order by a court or the Tribunal. The NCR may also refer the dispute to a debt counsellor, an ombud with jurisdiction or a consumer court. After investigating the matter, the NCR may refer the matter to a provincial consumer court or the Tribunal for an order allowed by the Act. = Other dispute-resolution methods = Alternatively, disputes may be referred for resolution directly to the relevant ombud if the credit provider is a financial institution (like a bank), to a consumer court or to an alternative dispute resolution agent.ss 134-135. With the consent of the parties, the resolution may be recorded in writing and made an order of court or the Tribunal. In his book The National Credit Act Explained, Otto concludes, > All in all, the muscle of the National Credit Regulator, the far-reaching > powers of the National Consumer Tribunal and the courts, the almost > paternalistic protective inclination of the legislature, and the extensive > network of dispute-solving account for consumer legislation that is going to > have a huge impact on the enormous credit industry in South Africa.12.  Debt enforcement  The Act limits the credit provider's common-law rights to enforce debt: that is, to claim what is due in terms of the credit agreement. This is in line with international consumer legislation, but the Act's provisions have been criticised as being unusually cumbersome and detrimental to credit providers.Visagie 2006 De Rebus at page 35. = Default notice to the consumer = If a consumer is in default, the credit provider must notify the consumer of his default in writing. This is effectively a letter of demand. The notice must do more, however: The credit provider must propose to the consumer that the consumer refer the credit agreement to, among others, a debt counsellor to resolve the dispute or agree on a plan to get payments up to date. As regards the method of delivery of the written default notice, the consumer may choose to be informed in one or more of these ways: * in person at the credit provider's business premises; * at any other place chosen by the consumer, at the consumer's expense; or * by ordinary mail fax or email or printable web-page. Must the default notice actually reach the consumer to be effective? The Constitutional Court held in Sebola v Standard Bank2012 (5) SA 142 (CC). that the Act, although it gives no clear meaning to ‚Äúdeliver,‚Äù requires that the credit provider, in seeking to enforce a credit agreement, must aver and prove that the notice was delivered to the consumer. Where the credit provider posts the notice, proof of registered despatch to the address of the consumer, together with proof that the notice reached the appropriate post office for delivery to the consumer, will constitute sufficient proof of delivery (in the absence of contrary indication). = Debt procedures in court = A credit provider may go to court to enforce a credit agreement only if * the consumer has been in default for at least 20 business days; * at least ten business days have elapsed since the credit provider delivered the default notice; * the consumer has not responded to the notice or responded by rejecting the proposals in the notice; * the consumer has not surrendered to the credit provider the goods subject to the credit agreement him/herself (in the case of an instalment agreement, secured loan or lease agreement).See below. The twenty days and ten days referred to above may run concurrently: that is, the ten-day period may occur during the 20-day period. Where a case has been referred to the National Consumer Tribunal, debt counsellor, ombud, alternative-dispute-resolution agent or consumer court, or the credit agreement is subject to a debt review, the court will adjourn the case. A much larger number of requests for default judgment on credit agreements now have to be referred to a magistrate,s 2(5) of the Magistrates‚Äô Courts Act. rather than being dealt with by the clerk of the court. This will greatly increase the workload of the magistrates, and could cause debt enforcement procedures to take much longer, resulting in frustration for credit providers. = Attachment and sale of goods = If a credit provider properly cancels a credit agreement, the court may order the attachment of the goods, allowing for the sale of the goods to settle the account. This procedure follows the usual common law. If the proceeds of the sale are not sufficient to settle the account, the credit provider may approach the court for an order to recover the outstanding balance. This applies in the case of the instalment agreement, secured loan or lease. Strangely absent from this list is the mortgage agreement. This implies that the mortgagee (a bank, usually) will be able to rely only on the proceeds of the sale of the property to settle the account‚Äîeven if this is insufficient, and even if the mortgagor (the debtor) is very wealthy and has other assets that could be attached. = Interim attachment orders = Common practice is that a credit provider asks the court for an ‚Äúinterim attachment order,‚Äù pending cancellation of the agreement, in order to protect goods at risk (like a motor car) from deterioration or damage. This order will allow the sheriff to attach the goods for safekeeping until such time as the court action is finalised, which can take a long time. It is not clear from the Act whether or not credit providers will still be able to obtain interim attachment orders. The past practice of obtaining such orders may well continue. = Re-instatement of credit agreement by consumer = At any time before cancellation, a consumer may reinstate a credit agreement that is in default by paying all amounts overdue, plus default charges and the costs of enforcing the debt to date. The consumer may then repossess property attached, but not if the goods have already been sold. = Surrender of goods = The consumer may choose at any time to surrender the goods that are subject to the credit agreement, whether or not the consumer is in default. This provision is discussed in detail above. = Unlawful collection practices = A credit provider may not use an identity document, credit or debit card, access card or PIN to enforce a credit agreement or collect on the agreement. A contravention of this provision is a criminal offence.

His preoccupation with drawing began very early, since there are drawings on the fly-leaves of books from that period. His natural history interest began. Watercolor is the basic medium for his work, with occasional gouache for highlighting or detail. His preferred working surface is a fashion type board, CS2 not surface being the favorite. Reference sources are most important, and Denys uses a body-live, pinned or pickled, to work from, as pinned and set specimens can be misleading due to shrinkage, discoloration or loss of parts. He does use photographs although these vary enormously in terms of color bias. He uses textbook or specialist handbooks to confirm details of mouth parts, wing venation and other identification features.' Denys Ovenden began his studies at Hornsey College of Art in 1938, with a five-year break from 1942 to December 1946 in the Royal Engineers, most of which was spent in North Africa and Italy. In 1950 he began working as a freelance illustrator, for London Zoo, The Radio Times, Crawfords Advertising Agency and Collins. A lot of time was also spent working with fellow ex-students at the Waverly Studio. In 1961 Denys Ovenden went to work on the part-work, Understanding Science, where he met Michael Chinery, a close and valued friend to this present time.

The first storm in the series Hilde, named Otto by Free University of Berlin, and Eino in Finland was an extratropical cyclone affecting parts of northern Europe, causing disruption to electricity supplies and transportation across mid Norway, northern Sweden and central Finland during 15‚Äì18 November 2013. The storm brought a new record average wind speed to Sweden (at altitude), however wind speeds at lower altitudes were less than seen during Cyclone Dagmar of 2011. Most damage was caused by falling trees along the storm's path likely exacerbated by unfrozen ground. The total cost of damage is likely to be low, as the storm passed over relatively unpopulated regions of the Nordic nations. Meteorological history The storm formed over the Atlantic Ocean to the south of Greenland and west of Newfoundland on 15 November. The storm followed a similar, though more northerly path than Dagmar in 2011. The storm was estimated to be less intense than Dagmar, and the more northerly track would take it over lightly populated regions. Preparation and warnings Before the storm the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute issued class 1- and class 2-warnings across Norrland. Class 2-warning remained active on 17 November in parts of V√§sterbotten and Norrbotten. The Finnish Meteorological Institute issued a level 2 warning, that significant wind damage could occur in central Finland, and released advice for the public on how to prepare for strong winds and any potential power outages. The Norwegian energy company Statoil evacuated 97 people from the drilling platform Njord A as a safety precaution. Hurtigruten ferry sailings along the Norwegian coast were cancelled in preparation for the storm. Railway transport was halted overnight (16 November) in northern Sweden. Total Precipitable water over Europe, 15/11/2013 Preceding weather Fronts from low pressure area Nikolaus passed over Norway in the 24 hours before Hilde. These fronts brought close to extreme rainfall in Bergen on 15 November, and heavy rain across Western Norway which left many roads impassable as they were closed by landslides and rockfalls overnight 15‚Äì16 November. Norway's second-largest city Bergen, saw 60 mm of rain fall in 6 hours, Friday afternoon and evening. The calls generated overwhelmed the capacity of the city's emergency lines and Bergen municipality staff set up an alternate number to cope with incoming calls reporting flooding of homes and roads. The rainfall also closed the city's Fl√∏ibanen funicular railway for only the second time in 105 years. On the Norwegian national road 15, a bus from Volda to Oslo was caught in a landslide between Hjelle and Oppstryn around midnight. None of the 35 passengers aboard were hurt but the bus was left stuck within the slide. High winds across Finnmark in the far north of Norway were reported on 16 November, which led to the evacuation of Hammerfest Airport's tower, and grounding of all air traffic. Wind gusts of were reported on the mountains and at the airport. Impact Hilde developing to the west of Norway on the afternoon of 16 November 2013.

In Sweden the high altitude weather station at Stekenjokk, in Lappland recorded an average windspeed (10 minutes) of , which surpassed the record of recorded in association with Gudrun in 2005 and another storm in 2‚Äì3 March 2011 also recorded at Stekenjokk. The station also recorded the highest gust (2 seconds) ever recorded in November during the storm at with the previous monthly record of recorded at Tarfala 7 November 2003, The highest ever gust recorded during any month in Sweden is recorded 20 December 1992. Hilde on the evening of 16 November 2013. Norwegian Meteorological Institute Inland at lower altitudes the strongest gusts were recorded at Vilhelmina, V√§sterbotten County and Fr√∂s√∂n, J√§mtland, which were lower than those seen during the Dagmar storm in 2011. In Norway electricity was cut to 35,000 homes at the height of the storm, mostly in Tr√∏ndelag and Helgeland. The storm at its height left 36,000 without electricity in J√§mtland, V√§sternorrland and V√§sterbotten in Sweden, which had been reduced to 28,000 by mid morning 17 November, with electricity suppliers warning some customers may not be reconnected until Monday 18 November. In Finland, an estimated 230,000 households were without electricity. Northern Sweden also saw problems with the mobile and land line phone network, with 15,000 customers without land line connections on 17 November, in the towns of Vilhelmina and Dorotea inhabitants had difficulty in reaching the emergency services telephone number. The Norwegian communications company Telenor reported that in Nord-Tr√∏ndelag 2,800 broadband and 4,600 fixed line customers were without service and in Nordland 300 broadband customers and 460 fixed line customers were also without service on 18 November. The company also reported difficulties with the mobile phone network in these counties, with over 150 2G base stations down and 60 3G base stations out of service. In Finland the regions of H√§me, Tampere, Ostrobothnia, Satakunta and Savo, were particularly affected, with the storm felling many trees and breaking power lines. In western regions of Finland rail lines were disrupted. In Russia power outages were reported in the town of Lakhdenpokhya, Republic of Karelia due to the strong winds. Electricity supplies were also cut to 108 villages throughout the Leningrad region, while Saint Petersburg saw electricity lines, billboards, roofing and traffic signals toppled. The Saint Petersburg Dam was closed in the early morning 17 November with a storm warning in place in the city. In the Gulf of Finland the closure of the St Petersburg dam left the ferry was unable to enter port, waiting out the storm with 2800 passengers on board. Strong winds forced its St. Peter Line sister ferry the MS Princess Anastasia to return to Tallinn harbour. Subsequent storms Several further low pressure systems impacted the Nordic countries immediately after the passage of Hilde. Cyclone Oskari Oskari (Vincenc) ‚Äì November 29-December 4, 2013. 976 hPa. Named by the Finnish Meteorological Institute. Oskari was stronger than Hilde in Finland, with a maximum gust of at M√§rket skerry lighthouse, to the west of the √Öland Islands. Cyclone Xaver Named Bodil by Danish Meteorological Institute and Sven by SMHI, the storm brought Force 12 winds and heavy snowfall. The storm brought a storm surge to the Irish and North Seas with coastal flooding resulting from what the Environment Agency in the United Kingdom described as the worst storm surge in 60 years. Record water levels were also reported in the √òresund between Sweden and Denmark. Blizzards and severe weather in Sweden and Poland led to several fatalities. The North Sea storm surge on 4‚Äì5 December 2013 saw water damage 1,400 buildings and of land, and caused no direct deaths. This was attributed to the warnings that were issued several days in advance and the improved coastal defences that had been built since the North Sea flood of 1953. Cyclone Ivar (Seija) Ivar named by the Norwegian Meteorological Institute, and Seija by the Finnish Meteorological Institute. unnamed by the FUB. December 10-17, 2013. 977 hPa. With a route and intensity similar to Hilde, Ivar once again brought hurricane-force winds to central Norway. In Norway 50,000 customers were without power. In Sweden the storm left 55,000 across Norrland without power. Near record level winds were reported from Finland, where 200,000 were left without power. Estonia saw winds up to 115 km/h and 45,000 homes without electricity. Described as more powerful than both Hilde and Oskari, but slightly weaker than Cyclone Dagmar of 2011 in Finland. Video of shoppers in Alesund Norway struggling against the wind from the storm was shown widely on internet after becoming a hit on YouTube. Hilde and Ivar brought the worst forest damage to Scandinavia since the New Year's Day Storm of 1992. Cyclones Zaki and Adam Zaki ‚Äì December 12-16, 2013 and Adam December 14-19, 2013. 952 hPa.

She is also the only female model to have won a cycle which included male models, the other two cycles which followed were both won by men. Early life Miller was born in Olympia, Washington. In 2001, Miller's family relocated to Bend, Oregon where she was raised with her two sisters. Prior to her appearance on America's Next Top Model, Miller studied at Mountain View High School in Bend. She was previously signed to Code Model Management in New York. Career=America's Next Top Model In 2013, Miller appeared in Cycle 20 of the CW Network reality television show America's Next Top Model, in which she competed against fifteen other aspiring models. In the competition, Miller was one of the front-runners, having never placed below fifth after the first panel, where she was placed tenth. She was one of the strongest of her cycle, having won a total of five challenges and received six first call-outs. Also, Miller's photograph from the paint photoshoot was deemed by Tyra Banks as one of the best produced in the history of the show. In Week 8, Miller failed to book any shows during LA Style Fashion Week. At the final runway show in Bali, Miller faced difficulty when she accidentally stumbled with her stilettos on her gown. Despite this, the judges were still impressed by her walk. At the final deliberation, the judges noted Miller's command on the runway, her fluidity, as well as her high-fashion and girl-next-door appeal. She would eventually beat fellow competitor Marvin Cortes in the season finale, becoming the twentieth winner of America's Next Top Model. Miller's win also means that she is the sixth winner of America's Next Top Model to have never made an appearance in the bottom two, along with Jaslene Gonzalez, McKey Sullivan, Nicole Fox, Krista White, Sophie Sumner and later winner India Gants. Miller also became the second America's Next Top Model winner to have also never even appeared in the bottom three. This was preceded by cycle 13 winner Nicole Fox. She is also the second winner of the show to have received a total of six first call-outs after Ann Ward, the winner of cycle 15 After winning America's Next Top Model, Miller received a modeling contract with NEXT Model Management in Los Angeles, an eight-page spread in the December/January 2014 issue of Nylon magazine and a $100,000-ad campaign with Guess.

Huffington Post, 15 January 2012. As a result, the ice-strengthened oil tanker Renda was chartered to carry a cargo of diesel fuel, heating oil and gasoline to the city. This was the first time a fuel supply mission was attempted in the middle of the winter. In January 2012, a Jones Act waiver was arranged with the support of Alaska's congressional delegation so that Renda could load fuel at Dutch Harbor and transport it to Nome, a task normally reserved for US- flagged vessels. At the time, Nome was separated from open water by a pack ice field. The task of escorting Renda safely to the icebound city was given to USCGC Healy, the only American icebreaker in service at the time. The ten-day voyage through the ice was closely followed by the press.Tanker With Crucial Fuel Delivery Is Sighted Off Nome. New York Times, 13 January 2012.

While welcomed by the residents, the fuel supply mission raised questions about the capability of the Coast Guard icebreaker fleet. At the time, Healy was the only active polar icebreaker in the United States while in the meantime Russia had 26 polar icebreakers in service, including a number of heavy nuclear- powered ones.Coast Guard mission to Nome exposes U.S. limits in ice-breaking capability.

He is a former Labour councillor in Rochdale and Bradford, and was non-executive chairman of the Co-operative Bank. After the bank lost ¬£700m in the first half of 2013, and a ¬£1.5 billion hole in the bank's finances was discovered by the new chief executive Euan Sutherland in May 2013, Flowers resigned in May 2013. In November 2013, the activities of Flowers, who had occupied a variety of powerful political and business posts and had been appointed by Labour leader Ed Miliband to a senior post in 2010, were widely reported in the media. Flowers was filmed by an acquaintance in his car apparently agreeing to buy cocaine and methamphetamine, and appearing to count large sums of money while discussing his use of a range of other non-medicinal drugs. He was subsequently taken to court and convicted of possession of drugs.Former Co-op bank boss Paul Flowers pleads guilty to drug charges. Helen Pidd. Publisher: The Guardian newspaper. Published: 7 May 2014. Retrieved: 8 May 2014. Soon after the film of the apparent purchase of illicit drugs was released to the media, it was revealed that, while deputy head of social services at Rochdale Council, Flowers had known about the activities of paedophiles at a residential boys' school, but had not informed parents or taken measures to close the school, was responsible for rejecting allegations of child sex abuse against the late Rochdale MP Cyril Smith, and that, in 2011, while working at Bradford Council, \\"inappropriate but not illegal adult content was found on a council computer handed in by Councillor Flowers for servicing. This was put to him and he resigned immediately.\\" Several newspapers reported allegations that he communicated with rent boys using his work email account while he was in charge of the Co-operative Bank, and was convicted of carrying out a sex act in a public toilet more than 30 years ago. Early life Flowers was brought up in Eastleigh, going to Barton Peveril School. From 1972 he studied for a Bachelor of Arts degree in theology, graduating from the University of Bristol in 1975. He then obtained a post- graduate diploma at the University of Geneva. Early in his career he worked for four years in banking, gaining part 1 and half of his part 2 Institute of Bankers qualification. Methodist minister Flowers was a Methodist minister for over 40 years. In 1976 he was appointed to serve the church in Bradford, West Yorkshire. From 1978 to 1981 he was a minister at Hedge End‚Äôs Methodist church in Eastleigh. After periods in Coventry, Rochdale and Bridlington, he returned to Bradford. Flowers was a minister at Clayton and Wibsey churches in the Bradford South Circuit near his home in Bradford. Flowers was a trustee for Methodist Church Purposes, the body which manages the church's invested funds and property. Flowers contributed regularly to the Methodist Recorder, including a spell as the paper's art critic, writing the Gallery Notes column. He also reported from the Methodist Conference. In 2000 he attempted to set up a trade union for clergy to protect members against false allegations of abuse. For a number of years he was a leading candidate in the race for the position of President of the Methodist Conference but withdrew after three unsuccessful attempts. On 21 November 2013 he was suspended indefinitely by the church. In early summer 2014 he left Bradford to live in Greater Manchester. He ceased to be in 'Full Connexion' (that is, on the list of authorised ministers) with the Methodist Church of Great Britain in January 2017, following the conclusion of a disciplinary process which found him guilty of 'seriously impairing the mission, witness or integrity of the church'. Co-operative Group Flowers' career progressed through the democratic structures of United Co-operatives, becoming a member of its board following election via United's Yorkshire Regional Committee. In 2008, following United's merger with The Co-operative Group in 2007, he joined the board of the Co-op Group, and was later made its deputy chairman. He resigned from the Group board and all subsidiary positions in June 2013, after his enforced resignation from Co-op Bank that month. Co-operative Bank In 2009, following its merger with Britannia Building Society, Flowers was appointed non-executive chairman of the Co-operative Bank. On 26 March 2010 he was appointed non-executive chairman of Co-operative Financial Services; the holding company for both the Co-operative Bank and the Co-operative Insurance Society. During this period, he was made a fellow of the Chartered Institute of Bankers in Scotland; in light of the later scandal, the fellowship was withdrawn on 21 November 2013. After the bank lost ¬£700m in the first half of 2013, and then the discovery of a ¬£1.5bn hole in the bank's finances by new chief executive Euan Sutherland in May 2013, Flowers resigned from the bank in June 2013, taking responsibility for the difficulties the bank experienced after acquiring Britannia. He was replaced by Richard Pym, head of UK Asset Resolution. Flowers testified to the Treasury Select Committee in November 2013 that the Britannia merger and other deals were undertaken under pressure from senior government ministers. In March 2018 Flowers was banned from the financial services industry by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) for having used his work email for sexually explicit messages and to discuss illegal drugs, and his work mobile phone to call premium rate chat lines. The FCA said he had \\"demonstrated a lack of fitness and propriety required to work in financial services\\" and consumers would lose faith in the industry if he was allowed to continue in it. Labour Party In the 1970s Flowers was vice- chairman of Eastleigh Labour Party, and contested Bishop's Waltham in Hampshire county council elections in 1981.https://www.dailyecho.co.uk/news/10818258.sex-shame-past-of-co-op-bank- supremo/ Flowers unsuccessfully stood for selection in 1985 as the Labour candidate to contest the Coventry South East parliamentary seat, supported by branches of his union as a former bank worker, the General, Municipal, Boilermakers and Allied Trade Union. He described himself as \\"towards the centre\\" politically in this campaign. In the Rochdale council election of 1988 he gained a seat in the Smallbridge and Wardleworth ward, holding it until 1992. Flowers was vice-chairman of Rochdale Council's social services committee at the time of a Satanic abuse scandal, and was responsible for rejecting allegations of child sex abuse against the late MP Cyril Smith. He then moved to Bradford, serving for 10 years on the city council. He resigned his seat in Great Horton in September 2011, because of his \\"increased responsibilities as Co-op Bank's chairman.\\" In light of the 2013 drugs scandal, Bradford City Council revealed that, in 2011, \\"Inappropriate but not illegal adult content was found on a council computer handed in by Councillor Flowers for servicing. This was put to him and he resigned immediately.\\" In 2010 he was appointed by new Labour Party leader Ed Miliband to the party's finance and industry advisory board. On 6 March 2013 as part of his membership of the group, Labour leader Ed Miliband met Flowers to discuss UK banking reform. Flowers had told MPs on the Banking Committee that he had helped to arrange a donation to then-shadow chancellor Ed Balls's office although Balls insisted that Flowers had nothing to do with the donation. The scandal surrounding the revelations led the Conservative Party chairman, Grant Shapps to ask the Labour leadership to disclose details of any private meetings with Flowers and to return a ¬£50,000 donation to Ed Balls's office that Flowers had backed. Other works Flowers has been involved with a large number of charities, including being a trustee of both the Terrence Higgins Trust and, between 1992 and 2004, the Lifeline project, which worked in the field of alcohol and drug abuse. Following the scandal of November 2013, the Lifeline project stated that at the time of his resignation he was under investigation following alleged submission of false expenses claims, with the matter having then been referred to the Charity Commission. In the 1980s he was vice- chairman of the West Midlands Citizens Advice Bureau. Flowers has been a member of the Advertising Standards Authority, and was vice chair of the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureau. Flowers was also a chair of Manchester Camerata, the city's chamber orchestra. He is a fellow of both the Royal Society of Arts and the Royal Geographical Society. Drugs scandal A few days after his appearance before the Treasury Select Committee, Flowers was filmed by acquaintance Stuart Davies in his car apparently agreeing to buy cocaine and methamphetamine. The clip appears to show him counting out ¬£300 in ¬£20 notes, before sending a friend to make the deal. Whilst waiting, Flowers discusses his use of ketamine, cannabis and GHB. Davies handed over the footage to the Mail on Sunday, which published its article on 17 November 2013.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24978293 On 21 November it emerged that Flowers had been convicted of drink-driving in Manchester in 1990. Flowers was immediately suspended by the Methodist Church for three weeks (later extended to indefinite suspension) pending further investigation, and suspended as a member of the Labour Party. Flowers in a statement said: Co-operative Group chairman Len Wardle, who had been part of the committee which had selected Flowers and was scheduled to retire in May 2014, resigned in light of the revelations. He was replaced by Ursula Lidbetter, Co-op Group's deputy chair and chief executive of the Lincolnshire Co-operative Society. David Cameron announced in the House of Commons that he would be setting up inquiries to determine how Flowers had come to be appointed chairman of the Co-op Bank. On 21 November 2013 Flowers was arrested by police in the Merseyside area in connection with a drugs supply investigation. He has been dubbed the \\"crystal methodist\\". In April 2014 he was charged with possession of drugs, and convicted of possessing cocaine, methamphetamine and ketamine on 7 May 2014, receiving a ¬£400 fine.

In 1857 he was chosen as a candidate to contest the two-seat constituency of Finsbury as a Whig and supporter of the policy of Lord Palmerston. The election was held on 29 March, and Cox was elected, coming second of the four candidates, with a majority of 156 votes over the third-placed candidate. When a further general election was called in 1859, Cox found himself opposed by two other Liberal candidates. He lost his seat, with The Standard noting satirically that: > \\"...the honourable gentleman neither spared his lungs nor his powers of > sitting out the most long-winded debate... He had almost arrived at the > distinction of being called a bore... Happily for his peace, his health, and > his pocket, his too Liberal career has been stopped by an oblivious > constituency\\".

The by-election was held on 16 December, and Cox defeated his only opponent, J R Mills by 42 votes. Cox held the seat until the next general election in July 1865. He was one of four Liberal candidates who, along with a lone Conservative, contested the seat. He failed to be re-elected, finishing in third place with 5,008 votes, more than 2,800 behind the second-placed candidate. Between c.1861 and c.1868 Cox commissioned a house to be built in the village of Netteswell, Essex. The house was called 'Spurriers'. Cox lived in the house until his death in December 1889 aged 72.

It was originally built at the end of the 1st century BC to record the renewed alliance between Emperor Augustus and Marcus Julius Cottius, a Celto-Ligurian ruler who had been made king and Roman prefect of the Cottian Alps. The arch, together with other remains from the period, such as the Roman amphitheatre, underscore the importance that the city of Susa had during the Roman period.  Description  From above, the arch forms a rectangle 11.93 metres long and 7.3 metres wide. Constructed with white marble from Foresto, it rests on two large bases. There is only one archway. The arch has a unique arcade, in which the archivolt is supported by pilasters. The entablature rests on four Corinthian columns placed at the extremities of each corner, such that a quarter of each drum is embedded in the monument. The lowest architrave is composed of three bands of which the lowest band is thicker than the middle band, and this in turn is thicker than the top band. Above the architrave, a frieze composed of a bass relief stretches around all four sides. Above that is the cornice which has twenty-two corbels on each face and twelve on each side of the arch. The corbels' panels are decorated with roses. On tob of that rests the attic, which displays an inscription on both faces. The dedicatory inscription The following dedication is recorded on the attic: The frieze The frieze represents the sacrifice of the suovetaurilia, a sacrifice in which the victims were a pig (sus), a sheep (ovis) and a bull (taurus) with the animals intended for sacrifice of exceptional size, clearly much larger than the men leading them to sacrifice. The scene has a great number of symbolic meanings, however it indicates above all that the sacrifice is the focus. The man performing the sacrifice is perhaps to be identified with Cottius. On the western side some representatives of the Cottian communities mentioned in the inscription are depicted. On the southern side a second sacrifice, officiated by Cottius, is depicted. On the eastern side the scene has been completely destroyed by the ravages of time.

According to Transparency International's annual Corruption Perceptions Index, as of 2018, Romania is the 61st least corrupt country out of 180 countries (at par with Cuba and Malaysia), down from the 57th place in 2017, and the fourth most corrupt in the European Union (after Hungary, Greece and Bulgaria). In the 2014 EU Anti- Corruption Report, 57% of the Romanians were most likely to say they are personally affected by corruption (at par with Cyprus).EU Anti-Corruption Report Corruption can be found both in the public sector and in private businesses, and poses concerns for foreign investors. Although there have been improvements since the late 1990s, corruption remains a problem in Romania as it is especially found on all levels of public office, in the police force as well as in the judiciary system. Generally, despite efforts using laws and regulations to prevent corruption, enforcement has been weak. Since 2014 however, the investigation and prosecution of medium- and high-level political, judicial and administrative officials by the National Anticorruption Directorate has increased The National Anticorruption Directorate was established in 2002 by the Romanian government to investigate and prosecute corruption related offenses causing damage to the Romanian state. In terms of scandals, corruption was cited among many issues that provoked the 2012‚Äì15 social unrest, the 2015 protests following the Colectiv nightclub fire, and the 2017 protests. In 2019, the European Commission threatened to take \\"punitive measures\\" against Romania for its corruption problems.EU slams Romania for not tackling corruption, Deutsche Welle, Retrieved on February 2020. \\"'The evolution of the situation in the first months of 2019 was a source of great concern,'\\" the report continues, saying that if Bucharest does not make 'a strong commitment to judicial independence and the fight against corruption,' punitive measures may have to be taken.\\" Archived on the Wayback Machine  Background  After the fall of the communist regime in 1989, Romania has struggled with corruption and establishing a well-functioning judicial system. In 2005, when the treaty was signed with the European Union, former president Traian BƒÉsescu mentioned that \\"Romania [was] not yet be prepared to meet the European Union's standards.\\" Since entering the EU, Romania has somewhat improved transparency and accountability in the public sector, but the European Commission still considers the government's reform to be slow and weak. The poor implementation of laws on the transparency of information and decision-making processes between government officials coupled with the bribes and conflicts of interests in public procurement practices makes the judicial system ineffective in fighting against corruption. This has had consequences in effectively using the European Union's funds towards developing the country. Although it plays a considerable role in the country's stagnant path towards progress, corruption is only one of the issues among others. Other factors include the administrative capacity of public purchasers, the lack of stability and fragmentation of the legal framework, the quality of competition in public procurement and few others listed in the Report from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council. In 2012, the European Commission expressed concerns about the rule of law, pointing to the power struggle between Prime Minister Victor Ponta and President Traian BƒÉsescu, which gave rise to what is called the 2012 political crisis. The Commission also criticized Romania for failing to root out corruption in its state institutions. One year later, the Chamber of Deputies passed without parliamentary debate several controversial amendments to the Penal Code, including that the country's president, senators, members of the lower chamber, as well as lawyers are no longer to be considered \\"public officials\\". These actors can as a result take part in illicit interests without being held accountable for abuse of office, bribery, conflicts of interest and other corruption crimes. The amendments were sharply criticized by Romanian opposition parties and European leaders, while the Constitutional Court of Romania cataloged this move as unconstitutional. The report from the US Department of State published in May 2015 demonstrates that the government of Romania still takes part in corrupt activities such as bypassing standard legislative procedures and imposing fines on infrastructure in certain sectors like the energy industry. The lack of political will demonstrated by the 2012 political crisis as well as the under-funding of the National Anticorruption Directorate poses a major challenge in investigating and enforcing sanctions to bureaucratic corruption. Although the National Anticorruption Directorate has taken action in investigating corrupt cases, enforcing sanctions remains weak and staff and inspection procedures are under-resourced. As it is mentioned in the report, \\"conflict of interest, respect for standards of ethical conduct, and integrity in public office in general remain a concern for all three branches of government\\" and the National Anticorruption Directorate will further its initiatives in tackling the problem.  Anti- corruption measures  Anti-corruption poster in Bucharest In 2014, the National Anticorruption Directorate indicted 1,138 authorities. Among them were politicians, judges and prosecutors, and businessmen. In 2015, the number of filed cases against high-level politicians and businessmen that committed corrupt acts has increased by an additional 1,250 people and has had a substantial social impact. Out of those people are Prime Minister Victor Ponta, 5 ministers and 21 parliamentarians. There have been 970 final convictions throughout the year and the amount of damages recovered has increased to ‚Ç¨194.37 million. In 2016, 1,270 more people were brought to trial, including 3 ministers, 17 parliamentarians, 47 mayors, 16 magistrates and 21 CEOs. The amount of damages recovered has increased to ‚Ç¨226 million. 2017 marked the year where an additional 997 individuals were accused and found guilty by the National Anticorruption Directorate, including the former President of the Chamber of Deputies, 6 parliamentarians, 3 ministers, 49 mayors, 6 magistrates and 11 CEOs. The amount of damages recovered has decreased to ‚Ç¨159.5 million. In January 2017, the newly appointed government modified the Penal Code and Penal Procedure Code overnight as a way to fix the issue of overcrowding in prisons. Opponents released accusations that the government has actually modified the Codes as a way to decriminalize political corruption, to release former politicians from prison without punishment and to stop any accusations and investigations made to current authorities. 24 hours later, the biggest protest since the fall of communism was witnessed, with 300,000 civilians manifesting their opposition to the government's actions in front of Victoria Palace. In February 2017, the protests held reached an unprecedented turnout of 500,000 people. The anti-corruption measures taken by civilians resulted in the withdrawal of the bills and the resignation of the former minister of justice. Since then, multiple protests composed of hundreds of thousands of Romanians have continued as a way to tackle corruption within the government. According to the Seventh Framework Programme of the European Commission, the promotion of integrity, accountability, and transparency by civil society organizations have made significant contributions to the decline of corruption.‚Äù Transparency International 2019 Transparency International reported that Romania is currently ranked 70th out of 180 countries for corruption and has a score of 44 out of 100 (0 being completely corrupt and 100 being clean).

At closure, it featured two island platforms with four tracks, and has dedicated turning tracks and through tracks. It was located on St Kilda Road between Domain Road and Park Street, adjacent to Kings Domain, and was one of the busiest interchanges on the system, being used by eight tram routes. The most recent structure was opened in April 2013, replacing an earlier structure built in 1986. The stop is temporarily closed, from the evening of 5 April 2018, to facilitate the construction of Anzac railway station and a new train- tram interchange, as part of the Melbourne Metro Rail Project. A temporary tram stop has since opened on 18 April 2018, to the north of Park Street. The new Domain Interchange is scheduled to open on completion of the station. History Northbound view before the redevelopment in February 2013 The junction now known as Domain Interchange was opened during the cable era in 1889. It was the connection between the Brighton Road ‚Äì Queensberry Street line and the newly opened Toorak line which left St Kilda Road to travel along Domain Road; both lines traversed Swanston Street and St Kilda Road. From 1925 to 1927 these two cable lines were converted to electric traction. In preparation for the electrification of St Kilda Road, a new depot and tracks were constructed, this brought a new line to Domain Junction, along Park Street and Hanna Street, which opened in 1925. It served as a means of diverting trams around the works on St Kilda Road without necessitating the construction of temporary track, and connected with the existing Sturt Street line. It would also serve as the first, and primary connection between Hanna Street depot and St Kilda Road; the other being Sturt Street, which followed early in 1926. The Toorak cable tram line was converted to electric traction following the completion of St Kilda Road's conversion. Prior to the April 2013 redevelopment of Domain Interchange, it had last been redeveloped in the 1986, with shelters and a third track added to allow route 55 trams to terminate without inhibiting through services.Here and There Trolley Wire February 1987 page 24 (large file) During the 2006 Commonwealth Games temporary changes were made to the tram network. Among these changes, routes 3 and 5 were through-routed to West Coburg through Domain Interchange, becoming routes 53 and 55 respectively for the duration of the games. Redevelopment Domain Interchange during redevelopment April 2013 The desire to redevelop Domain Interchange was raised by Yarra Trams CEO Dennis Cliche in a 2007 interview, with Cliche stating the redevelopment, along with other stops on St Kilda Road, was a priority; reiterating earlier comments in which he described it as \\"in need of an upgrade and a facelift.\\" Yarra Trams announced plans for the redevelopment of Domain Interchange in early 2013, with work commencing over the Easter 2013 long weekend. The new interchange had two island platforms that provide accessible entry to low-floor trams, four tracks, and created new bicycle lanes in the part of St Kilda Road surrounding the interchange. The redevelopment costed $10.2 million and was delivered by Coleman Rail, with design by GHD Group. The track arrangement gave dedicated tracks to route 55 trams from Park Street to terminate, and southbound 8 trams to turn left in Toorak Road, without impacting other routes, who continue through the middle tracks. Preparatory works began in February, with major construction spanning from the Easter break of 2013. The commencement of major works necessitated the full closure of St Kilda Road, with trams terminating either side of the interchange, and passengers walking around the works site to continue their journey. Major works commenced on 29 March with a full closure of the intersection, St Kilda Road opening two lanes on 3 April, and partial road closures continuing for the duration of the works. The completed interchange opened on the morning of 12 April 2013, with Minister for Public Transport Terry Mulder lauding the projects improvements to the tram and bike system, and Yarra Trams stating the project to be the largest redevelopment they had undertaken.

Transparency International's 2017 Corruption Perception Index ranks the country 16th place out of 180 countries.  Extent  Public trust in the civil service and judiciary is low, and the perception of corruption is extremely high in Belgium. Over 65% of people in Belgium think corruption is a problem. Over 70% think the government is at least to a large extent, or even entirely, run by a few big entities acting in their own best interests. There are areas that could be improved. For instance, whistleblower protection needs further improvement. It has been recommended that the process of anti-corruption policy implementation should also actively engage private sectors.  Dictator sanctuary accusations  Belgium offered a post-presidency retirement sanctuary for Rafael Correa, former president of Ecuador, who was investigated for massive corruption as soon as he left office. In January 2019, Ecuadorean president Lenin Moreno said that nearly half of $4.9 billion in oil infrastructure investment made during the administration of previous president Correa was stolen via corruption. Over 317 officials who served in Correa‚Äôs administration were suspected of corruption. Correa was president of Ecuador between 2007 and 2017.

Design and development Luigi Teichfuss took part in the First International Gliding Competition, held on Monte Sisemol near Asiago in October 1924, with a glider of his own design, the poorly documented Condor. At the competition he saw several German gliders, including the 1922 Geheimrat, the 1923 Konsul and the Moritz and these influenced the 1926 Tenax, his next design. The Tenax was a high wing braced monoplane with a two spar wing. Initially it had two bracing struts on each side but later just one, joining the lower fuselage to the wing at about one quarter span. The central third of the wing was rectangular in plan apart from a shallow cut-out in the trailing edge; the outboard panels were straight tapered to straight wing tips. At 12.25 its aspect ratio was between that of the Geheimrat (9.9) and the Konsul (15.8). The wing was largely fabric covered. Its fuselage was rectangular in cross section, plywood covered and tapered strongly to the tail. The high aspect ratio tailplane and elevators were mounted at the extreme tail at mid-fuselage and were almost rectangular in plan, as was the narrow, tall rudder, mounted slightly further forward. The pilot had an open cockpit immediately forward of the leading edge. There was a small skid on the forward fuselage underside for landings assisted by a generous wire rear skid. The Tenax made its first flights in 1926, piloted by Umberto Nannini. On some occasions at least, the Tenax was winch launched. Its performance was sufficiently encouraging for an attempt on the Italian distance record, which then stood at , held from December 1926 by Ettore Cattaneo in the Abate GP.1, but Nannini had to make a rather rough landing on an old, stony river bed after .

The strategic region had been used by rebel forces as a rear base for its operations around the capital Damascus. For its part, government forces had been using the nearby highway to link Damascus with the central Homs province and had multiple weapons depots in the area. The battle was primarily led on the rebel side by the Al-Nusra Front. 2013 Army offensive=Capture of Qara Between 15 and 17 November, 1,200‚Äì1,700 families, 90 percent of Qara, evacuated from the town over the border into the Lebanese town of Arsal, after the Syrian Army issued a warning that they were going to attack rebel forces in the area. In preparation for the offensive, thousands of Hezbollah fighters positioned themselves opposite the Qalamoun region on the Lebanese side of the border. For its part, rebels had been digging in for months, preparing a network of caves and bunkers in the mountains. On 15 November, the military launched its offensive against Qara and the next day multiple air strikes hit the rebel- held town. Fighting was also raging near the towns of An-Nabk and Rima. The clashes led to the closure of the Damascus-Homs highway. Rebel forces in the area mobilised to counter the Army offensive. On 17 November, government forces moved into the hills around Qara and were attempting to storm the town itself as more air strikes were conducted. Artillery was also used to hit the town. By the afternoon, government forces were not able to advance in the city despite repeated attempts and the constant bombardment. On 18 November, government troops continued the offensive, capturing key positions in Qara, according to the pro-government al-Watan daily newspaper. The Air Force carried out several raids on al-Qalamoun and Yabrud mountains, as pro- government press sources claimed that the Army controlled large parts of Qara. A man who fled Qara into Lebanon described the attack on the town and stated \\"Qara is finished\\". Middle East security officials stated there were few signs yet of a massive Syrian armour build-up needed for an all-out assault on Qalamoun. They speculated that the government may conclude that dwindling rebel supplies from Lebanon would mean an all-out assault is not worth the cost. On 19 November, government forces took full control of Qara. Rebels retreated from the town towards An-Nabk and Deir Attiyeh. Rebel attack on Deir Attiyeh On 20 November, a series of suicide attacks occurred against government forces in An-Nabk and Deir Attiyeh. A suicide car bomber targeted a military checkpoint while another blew up near a security headquarters, both on the outskirts of An-Nabk. In another incident, two Saudis tried to blow up the hospital in Deir Attiyeh but were stopped by government soldiers. In the attack on the checkpoint seven soldiers were killed and five wounded, while several soldiers died in the attack on the hospital. After the Saudi bombers exploded, five rebel fighters entered the hospital in an attempt to destroy medical equipment and kidnap a wounded Army officer and the Ikhbariya al- Suriya television crew. However, they were beaten back by the Army and the officer and crew were saved. Meanwhile, eight rebels were killed in fighting in the countryside around Deir Attiyeh. On 22 November, rebel forces, led by militants from ISIL and Al-Nusra Front, mostly seized the largely Christian town of Deir Attiyeh. Only the Bassel hospital and a small hill remained under Army control.

However, according to SOHR, the highway was still not fully secured due to continuing rebel attacks. On 10 December, the Army took full control of An- Nabk, with fighting continuing in its outskirts as a pocket of rebel resistance in a small area east of the town remained. State TV aired a live report from An-Nabk's main square in the center of the town. According to a pro-government newspaper, 100 rebels were killed or captured during the battle for the town.

Interlude  Early on 21 December, Hezbollah forces ambushed a group of Al-Nusra Front rebels on the Lebanese side of the border in Wadi al-Jamala, on the outskirts of Nahle, a mountainous area opposite the Qalamoun region.

On 12 February, the Syrian Air Force launched 20 airstrikes on Yabrud, while the Syrian Army captured the town of al-Jarajir, north-west of Yabrud near the Lebanese border. The next day, according to the pro-government al-Watan newspaper, the Army captured the town of Sahel, the al-Arid road, Qamieh and al-Kornish areas surrounding Yabrud. Around 20 February, rebels ambushed a Hezbollah convoy near the Lebanese border while they were traveling towards the frontline. 27 Hezbollah fighters were killed. By the end of February, according to a Hezbollah commander, government forces had captured 70 percent of the Qalamoun mountains. On 26 February, a rebel commander was killed outside Yabrud, while rebels claimed that they continued to withstand the offensive. They also claimed that the government offensive failed in the Rima Farms region to force a breakthrough. On 27 February, the pro-government Al- Watan newspaper reported that the Army captured two strategic hills near Yabrud that were being used by the rebels as supply routes. On 28 February, rebel sources claimed that their forces captured \\"Flag\\" hill and that Hezbollah retreated from the Sahel front. On 3 March, according to the Iranian Al-Alam news network, government forces recaptured Sahel and the previous day, the Army reportedly captured the strategic Al-Kuwaiti hill. Meanwhile, according to the SOHR, fighting was still continuing in the Sahel area, but government forces were advancing. A journalist for Hezbollah's television channel Al-Manar made a TV report from the village.Syrian army 'captures village near Yabrud' Government forces were reportedly reinforced by an Iraqi militia for the assault. 17 rebels, 15 government soldiers and militiamen and four Hezbollah fighters were killed during the day's fighting and 30 rebels were captured. One of the killed rebels was Hussein Mohammad Ammoun, who orchestrated a car bomb plot involving a female terrorism suspect in Lebanon the previous month. On 4 March, fighting was reportedly still continuing in the Sahel area, while reporters were taken on a tour of the village. A military commander also stated that the Army captured several hills and strategic positions on Yabrud's outskirts. To the north of Yabrud, in the Rima area, helicopters bombarded rebel positions using barrel bombs. On 5 March, government forces in Sahel were preparing to advance towards Flitah and Ras al-Ma'ara. The next day, they pressed their offensive against Yabrud and captured the \\"Kuwait\\" and \\"Qatar\\" hills near the city. The Army also captured areas in the Rima Farms region.Syrian army advances amid new wave of explosions 17 rebels and 15 soldiers were reportedly killed in the fighting.

By this point, according to an opposition TV station, 200 government fighters had been killed in the month-long offensive to capture the Yabrud area. According to a Hezbollah website, 40 Hezbollah fighters had been killed by 7 March. On 11 March, after almost a month of fighting, government forces captured the Rima Farms region, positioning themselves directly facing Yabrud. Battle of Yabroud On 14 March, Hezbollah fighters approached Yabroud from the west as a diversion while Army troops attacked from the east, with fire support provided to both forces. This left the rebels under heavy bombardment and caught in a pincer. The Army soon reached the eastern outskirts of the city. During this time, Hezbollah commandos conducted a raid in which they killed 13 rebel leaders, including the Kuwaiti Al-Nusra Qalamoun deputy commander, Abu Azzam al-Kuwaiti. This left rebel forces in disarray. In the meantime, the Army captured Aqaba hill, east of the town. This forced the rebels to retreat towards their rear bases. Government forces started entering Yabroud from the east and advanced along the town's main street, while rebels were retreating towards Rankous.Syrian forces enter rebel bastion of Yabrud Fighting was also taking place on the northern edge, between Yabrud and Sahel. On 15 March, fighting was reportedly still raging at the eastern entrance of the city, with rebels sending reinforcements after they managed to regroup, while Hezbollah fighters were also fighting inside the town itself. Government troops managed to advance \\"hundreds of meters (yards) inside Yabroud\\", according to a military source. 15 air-strikes were conducted against the town during the day.Syria conflict has 3rd anniversary amid offensive One of the strongest rebel groups was sent to defend Mar Maroun hill, east of the town. However, rebels were soon surprised when the Army captured Mar Maroun without any notable resistance. Thus the Army captured all hills around the town. The lack of resistance raised suspicions that the rebel group in charge of defending the hill made a deal with government forces. After this, the Army controlled Yabrud's eastern approaches and northeastern boundary. Later in the day, government forces had advanced two kilometers inside the town towards a roundabout, according to state TV. The SOHR denied government troops had managed to enter the city and said they were still two kilometers away from it. In the evening, rebel commanders held a meeting during which they decided to abandon Yabrud, with only the Al-Nusra Front deciding to still stay and fight. On 16 March, Syrian troops, backed by Hezbollah fighters, captured most, if not all, of Yabroud, after entering the eastern part of the town the previous night.Syria army recaptures rebel bastion Yabrud Government forces had secured the town's main square, the Al-Akhzar Grand Mosque and the town's Catholic church. Most of the opposition forces withdrew at dawn. 1,000 rebels retreated to the mountainous border area near the Lebanese town of Arsal. Others fled to the nearby towns of Rankous, Flitah and Hosh Arab. A small hardcore group of fighters remained in the town to fight to the death. The fighters were trying to drag Army troops into urban warfare, where they believed they had an advantage. However, by this point, rebel supplies for the town were cut off and weapons that were promised to opposition forces never arrived. As the Army was moving into Yabroud, the Air Force fired four rockets near the barren hills of Arsal, possibly targeting smugglers supplying rebels in the area. In all, the Air Force conducted 20 air strikes during the day between Yabrud and Arsal and on the outskirts of Arsal, after hundreds of rebels poured into the area. By noon, the Al-Nusra fighters had also retreated from the town. Military sources stated 500‚Äì1,000 rebels had been killed since the start of the operation to capture Yabrud. The rebel's loss of the town was seen as a symbolic and practical blow for the opposition. Due to the loss of Yabroud, the rebels had no way of supplying their forces in rural Damascus, where government forces were surrounding a series of opposition-held areas, denying them food, power and clean water. According to a security source, the Army's next targets were going to be Rankous and Flitah. Later during the day, the Syrian Defense Minister, General Fahd Jassem al-Freij, inspected government troops in Yabroud. By the evening, opposition forces completely withdrew from the area and headed towards the surrounding western villages, particularly the plains of the nearby city of Rankus. During the whole time that the battle was ongoing, the town was being hit by heavy shelling. The ferocity of the artillery strikes could be seen per one incident in which a group of 14 rebels was hit, leaving 12 of them dead and only two survivors. Third phase ‚Äì Operations continue On 17 March, the Lebanese army sent commandos to the border area with Syria, as Syrian rebels continued to flee into Lebanon after the fall of Yabrud.Lebanon sends army to Syria border as rebels flee The Lebanese military detained 15 rebels trying to cross into Lebanon in the northern Akkar region of Wadi Khaled. According to a Syrian Army source, 1,400 rebels from the FSA, Ahrar al-Sham and other groups had fled Yabrud in the previous two days, while 1,000 militants from the Al-Nusra Front remained to fight in the town, but they also eventually retreated. During the final fighting for Yabrud, 19 Hezbollah fighters were killed. Government forces shelled Flitah, as they prepared to assault the last rebel-held areas in the Qalamoun mountains, which includes Ras al-Maarra and Flitah, northwest of Yabrud, and Rankus to the south. This would mark the start of the Army's third phase to capture the whole mountain range. During the evening, a pro- government source reported that government troops had broken through the frontline at Ras al-Maarra. On 18 March, many unconfirmed claims surfaced from cities in the Qalamoun mountains, claiming a will to negotiate with government forces to spare the numerous cities south of Yabrud, including Maalula, of an Army offensive. Army troops were advancing towards Ras al-Ain, southwest of Yabrud, and captured several hills overlooking the village. Later, it was reported the military and Hezbollah entered Ras al-Ain and were progressing. Meanwhile, northwest of Yabrud, the Army entered Ras al-Maarra and captured large parts of it. On 19 March, the rebel's central front in the mountains appeared to be collapsing as the Army captured Ras al-Ain, after two days of fighting.Syrian Troops Capture Village Near Lebanon Border The military seized a factory in the village for manufacturing bombs, including car-bombs which bore Lebanese licence plaits. Meanwhile, fierce fighting raged between Army and rebel forces at a checkpoint near Rankus, while government troops were also fighting rebel and jihadist forces around the villages of Bkhaa and Jobeh in the Qalamoun region. Later, fighting also erupted in Rankus itself. Rebel commander Abu Omar Al-Farouq claimed, via the pro-opposition Syria Newsdesk, that \\"dozens of battalions\\" were stationed in the hills surrounding Yabrud and were \\"awaiting orders to move towards the city\\", but he admitted that the previous withdrawal from the town resulted in a state of confusion among the rebels and \\"divided and dispersed their forces\\". On 20 March, a pro- government source claimed that Rankus would fall to the Army in a matter of hours. The next day, the same source, claimed that the military captured Rankus, but this was not independently confirmed. On 23 March, a special Hezbollah unit infiltrated 11 kilometers deep inside rebel-held territory in the Qalamoun region and planted bombs inside the garden of a house frequented by three rebel car-bomb experts. When the experts arrived, along with four of their bodyguards, the bombs were detonated killing all seven of them. During the evening of 26 March, the Army and Hezbollah advanced on Flitah and attacked it in an attempt to capture the town. By the next day, the attack had been halted as the military shelled Flitah. Among those killed in the fighting was the commander of the rebel Military Council of Qalamoun and his deputy. On 28 March, rebels in Flitah appeared to be on the verge of collapse and the next day, the Army captured Flitah and Ras Al-Maar, leaving only Rankus to be captured by government forces before completely cutting rebel supplies from Lebanon into Qalamoun. On 31 March, it was reported by the SOHR that an Army Colonel was killed in the fighting and two days later, according to the SOHR, \\"a dozen\\" government fighters were killed and wounded in a rebel ambush, while two rebels were reportedly killed in the clashes. On 7 April, fighting raged around al-Sarkha, near Rankus, with government forces reportedly advancing. Later, the Fars News Agency reported the military managed to capture al-Sarkha and thus had broken through the rebel's first line of defense of Rankus. The SOHR also confirmed the Army had advanced towards Rankus. On 8 April, the military captured the Saidnaya Observatory, near Rankus, after fighting that killed 15 rebel fighters. Later, fighting erupted in the outskirts of Rankus which left a rebel commander dead. The state news agency claimed government forces captured a hilltop overlooking Rankus as well as a few neighborhoods of the town. A military sources stated rebels were willing to surrender Rankus after their string of losses in the Qalamoun area. Meanwhile, the frontline at al-Sarkha was still reported to be just north of the village. During this time, rebels were retreating towards Zabadani, further south, and reportedly preparing for a last stand against the advancing government troops. On 9 April, the Army entered the area of Rankus with heavy fighting subsequently erupting and a military source eventually reporting the military had captured the town. The SOHR also later confirmed government forces had captured Rankus, stating that as they entered the town there were no rebel forces a Rankus after a truce was reached a couple of days earlier between some of the town's residents and the government, which is why the residents demanded the rebels to leave the town. 140 rebels were reportedly killed during the battle for the town including an Iraqi al-Nusra commander, Abu Talha al-Baghdadi. Clashes continued on the edges of Rankus. On 13 April, state television claimed the Army captured a string of hills overlooking Rankus. On 14 April, the Army captured Al-Sarkha and recaptured Maaloula. Three Lebanese journalists from the pro-Hezbollah Al-Manar TV were killed during the fighting in Maaloula. Four soldiers also died as they tried to rescue the Al-Manar TV team.3 journalists for Hezbollah TV killed in Syria The Army had also secured the villages of Jibbeh and Jbaadin. On 15 April, the military captured Assal al- Ward after rebels surrendered or retreated. The Army than continued on and captured Hawsh Arab that night. During the day, government troops were still fighting pockets of rebel resistance at a mosque in Maaloula which they cleared by the following day. On 16 April, the pro-government channel Al Mayadeen reported that the Army captured the town of Talfita. On 20 April, President Bashar al-Assad visited Maaloula for the Easter holiday. Two days later, the military captured the town of al-Ma‚Äômoura. On 26 April, rebels in Zabadani surrendered and the Army captured the town, thus taking the last rebel stronghold in the Qalamoun region and on the Lebanese border. Aftermath In late June 2014, following hit-and-run attacks by remnant rebel forces in the mountains, the Syrian Army and Hezbollah launched an offensive to clear the area of all remaining rebels. The situation escalated in early August when rebels came into direct conflict with the Lebanese military as well on the Lebanese side of the border in the town of Arsal. On 19 August, a senior figure in the Islamic State, who had organised car and suicide bombings across Syria, Lebanon and Iraq, was killed. Some reports said that he was killed when a bomb, attached to his car, was detonated which was by Hezbollah Fighters. There were also several other reports that said that he was killed by the Syrian Army in the Qalamoun region.

Within Poland, surveys of Polish citizens reveal that it is perceived to be a major problem. Historical In the early 1920s, during the first years of the Second Polish Republic, Polish institutions were plagued by endemic corruption, and several of the governments of the day were accused of widespread corruption, very likely with a sound cause. Between 1923 and 1926, J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski came to conclude that the system which he dubbed \\"Sejmocracy\\" fostered general corruption, ultimately leading him to launch the May Coup and seize power. His byword Sanation referred to the cleansing he promised to introduce, in contrast to his predecessors' shady practices. However, once in power, his allies uncovered very few cases of corruption in past governments; persistent references to mass corruption amounted to a type of \\"primitive propaganda\\", in the words of historian Andrzej Garlicki. Later, it was Pi≈Çsudskiites who became embroiled in a well-publicized scandal revolving around election budgets, the Czechowicz Affair. By the 1930s, the country had developed an economic model involving state capitalism, with key industries in government hands. While this fostered growth in vital areas, it also gave rise to inefficiency and corruption. Private businesses found it hard to compete directly with state-owned concerns, in particular for public contracts. In the communist People's Republic of Poland, corruption was widespread, particularly by Polish United Workers Party officials (see nomenklatura). Corruption under the communist regime was so pervasive that some scholars have referred to the system as \\"legalized corruption\\". Recent era Transparency International's 2017 Corruption Perception Index ranks the country 36th place out of 180 countries. It is the eighth successive year in which Poland's score and ranking have improved in the Index. Global Integrity 2010 report gave Poland the score of 80 out of 100 assessing the legal framework as 86 (strong) and actual implementation as 71 (moderate). The report scored Poland particularly well (score of 90) in categories for \\"Non-Governmental Organizations, Public Information and Media\\" and \\"Elections\\", and particularly low in the category for \\"Public Administration and Professionalism\\" (score of 59). Supreme Audit Office (NIK) offices. A 2011 report by the Institute of Public Affairs also criticized the standards of public life in Poland, and the prevalence of nepotism and cronyism. A 2012 report jointly prepared by from the Institute of Public Affairs and Transparency International notes that the corruption in Poland is lower than in the past when in the mid-1990s it was \\"a phenomenon of a systemic nature\\". As described in that report, the World Bank Worldwide Governance Indicators (accessible here ) for \\"rule of law\\" and \\"control of corruption\\" show steady improvement for Poland. Poland has joined the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention in 2000, implementing relevant legislation in 2001. Poland has also made significant progress in combating corruption like the establishment of the Central Anti-Corruption Bureau and the first anti- corruption strategy which was adopted in 2002. The 2012 report from the ISP and TI report, reviewing individual Polish anti-corruption institution, praised the Supreme Audit Office (NIK), followed by the Polish Ombudsman (RPO). It criticized the civil society, the private sector, and the executive and public administration of insufficient efforts in fighting corruption. Poland's watchdog organisations are considered weak in combating corruption, and corruption allegations often appear in government contracting and permit issuance. The 2012 report from the ISP and TI praised the overall direction of the anti-corruption efforts in Poland, noting that they are \\"bringing noticeable results\\", but noted that those efforts, particularly from the public authorities, are \\"rather chaotic, sometimes contradictory or even controversial\\". It concluded that \\"corruption in Poland still entails considerable risks\\" and \\"the level of anti-corruption protection is unsatisfactory\\". A 2013 OECD report analyzing the implementation of the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention concluded that \\"the current Polish framework for fighting foreign bribery is still inadequate\\". A 2013 survey in Poland found that 83% of surveyed Polish citizens think that corruption is a major problem for their country, particularly prevalent among politicians (62 percent) and in the health-care sector (53 percent). A growing number of citizens (57%) is concerned that there is no political will to fight corruption.

The kinds of loss which arise if such risks eventuate may be either patrimonial or non- patrimonial. A general definition of insurance is supplied in the case of Lake v Reinsurance Corporation Ltd,1967 (3) SA 124 (W). which describes it as a contract between an insurer and an insured, in terms of which the insurer undertakes to render to the insured a sum of money, or its equivalent, on the occurrence of a specified uncertain event in which the insured has some interest, in return for the payment of a premium. According to LAWSA, > Insurance is the result of man‚Äôs efforts to create financial security in the > face of dangers to his life, person and estate. A typical desire of a man is > to form and develop his estate [....] The object of forming and developing > an estate may, however, be thwarted by dangers to which his present and > future position is exposed: if these materialise they may bring about > undesirable consequences which may affect his estate immediately or in the > future. Even while a danger is still remote it creates an element of > uncertainty, whether in relation to its actual occurrence, the exact time of > its occurrence, or the extent of its undesirable consequences. This element > of uncertainty creates insecurity. Accordingly, it may be said that man‚Äôs > need for security arises from the tension between his desire to form and > develop his estate, on the one hand, and the dangers threatening to thwart > that desire, on the other. The most effective and obvious way of achieving > security is to take direct precautionary measures against imminent or > potential harm [....] One of the most satisfactory general methods of > creating financial security against risks therefore seems to be that of > spreading the risk among a number of persons all exposed to the same risk > and all prepared to make a relatively negligible contribution towards > neutralising the detrimental effects of this risk which may materialise for > any one or more of their number. This is known as insurance. The law of insurance in South Africa consists of * rules peculiar to insurance (like the rules on insurable interest, subrogation and double insurance); * rules applicable to all contracts (like the rules on offer and acceptance, and contracts in favour of third parties); and * general contractual rules that have undergone changes in the insurance context (like the rules on insurance warranties). Broadly speaking, the law of insurance in South Africa is concerned with * the conclusion and consequences of insurance contracts; * general aspects of law of damages; * the rules on insurance intermediaries; * insurance tax law; and * insurance company or supervision law.  History  Early Roman-Dutch law dealt mainly with marine insurance. In 1879, the Cape Colony passed the General Law Amendment Act, introducing English law to govern ‚Äúevery suit, action and cause having reference to fire, life and marine insurance‚Äù in the Cape. In the Transvaal and Natal, English law was not incorporated by legislation; Roman-Dutch law remained applicable in principle, and was never officially displaced, but the influence of English law was felt also in these regions. In 1977, the Pre-Union Statute Law Revision Act repealed the Cape General Law Amendment Act. This repeal was interpreted by the Appellate Division, in the leading case on the sources of South African insurance law, Mutual & Federal v Oudtshoorn Municipality, to mean that the Roman-Dutch law of insurance was restored. South African insurance law is governed mainly by Roman-Dutch law as its common law. Nevertheless, the courts have consistently regarded English law as having strong persuasive authority whenever Roman-Dutch authority is lacking or insufficient. In respect of contracts concluded after the Pre-Union Statute Law Revision Act took effect, English law no longer has any binding authority in any part of South Africa, but it has been argued that, \\"judging from trade usages prevailing in the South African insurance industry, it may be assumed that the principles of English insurance law are still being adhered to.\\"Reinecke General Principles para 39.  Legislative Framework  The following legislation is of especial importance to South African insurance law: * the Long-term Insurance Act;Act 52 of 1998. * the Short-term Insurance Act;Act 53 of 1998. * the Insurance Laws Amendment Act;Act 27 of 2008. * the Financial Services Board Act;Act 97 of 1990. and * the Financial Advisory and Intermediary Services Act.Act 37 of 2002.  Classification of insurance  Classification is often merely a matter of convenience, but there may be compelling reasons for it; it may even reflect a difference in underlying legal principles. Various criteria may be applied in classifying contracts of insurance. The most important are * the nature of the interest insured; * the nature of the event insured against; * the way in which the amount recoverable under the contract is determined; and * the way in which any profits of the insurer are dealt with. It is possible, and often desirable, for one and the same insurance contract to combine different classes of insurance.  Indemnity versus capital insurance  The most fundamental distinction between various insurance contracts is that between indemnity insurance and what is usually called non-indemnity insurance, but which is here referred to as \\"capital insurance.\\" = Indemnity insurance = In the case of indemnity insurance, the contract between the parties provides that the insurer must indemnify the insured for patrimonial loss suffered as the proximate result of the occurrence of the event insured against. It is uncertain whether the event insured against (like fire or theft, for example) will actually occur, but it obviously must before loss can be quantified. In the context of indemnity insurance, examples of insurable interests include * real rights; * personal rights; * legal liability; and * the factual expectation of damage. The purpose of the contract of indemnity insurance is to restore the insured to his position quo ante. Nothing more than patrimonial indemnity may be recovered, as is illustrated by the rules on over-insurance and double insurance. The insured is not entitled to make a profit out of his loss. It is accordingly said that the principle of indemnity governs indemnity insurance. = Capital insurance = In the case of capital or non-indemnity insurance, the insurer undertakes to pay to the insured a specified amount, or periodical amounts, upon the happening of the event insured against: for example, R5,000 if the insured dies or loses a limb. This is generally non-patrimonial loss. On the face of it, the contract does not purport to indemnify the insured against patrimonial loss. According to traditional perceptions, the interests amenable to capital insurance are limited in number. The best examples of insurable interests are the unlimited interest a person has * in his own life; * in his health of mind; and * in his health of body and limbs. A person may also have a moral or emotional interest in the life, health and body of his spouse. Capital insurance, then, depends on an event that invariably relates to the person of the insured or a third party. The types of events which are open to capital insurance are likewise limited in number. Typical events are * death, including the death of an unborn child; * the continuation of life; * birth; and * accidents causing bodily injury. Insurance against other events must therefore take the form of indemnity insurance. A contract operating on the person of the insured or third party is not necessarily a contract of capital insurance, however, because it could have been the intention of the parties to conclude a pure contract of indemnity insurance. In the case of capital insurance, there is certainty that event insured against will occur (whereas in the case of indemnity insurance there is no such certainty), but the timing is uncertain. The amount is determined at time of the issuing of the policy, and is not related to loss suffered. = Differences and similarities = The difference between indemnity and capital insurance must be taken to lie in the nature of the interest that is the object of the insurance: * In indemnity insurance, the interest must of necessity be of a patrimonial nature; otherwise no financial loss or damage can be caused through its impairment. * By contrast, the interest that serves as the object of a capital-insurance contract must be regarded as non-patrimonial in substance. The law determines which interests may be insured in terms of an indemnity-insurance contract. The same holds good for capital insurance. Important consequences are attached to the distinction between indemnity and capital insurance. Capital insurers, for example, are not entitled to claim a proportionate contribution by other insurers, or to demand subrogation of the insured's rights in respect of the loss. By the same token, the doctrine of imputation of benefits does not apply to capital insurance.  Short- and long-term insurance  A distinction between short-term and long-term insurance is embodied in the definitions under the Insurance Acts. Long-term insurance business means the business of providing policy benefits under defined long-term policies. In terms of section 1 of the Long-term Insurance Act, ‚Äúlong-term policy‚Äù means an assistance policy, a disability policy, a fund policy, a health policy, a life policy or a sinking fund policy, or a contract comprising a combination of any of those policies. It also includes a contract whereby any such contract is varied. (See also the definition of ‚ÄúHealth Policy‚Äù to distinguish from short- term insurance.) Short-term insurance business refers to the business of providing policy benefits under defined short-term policies. Under the terms of section 1 of the Short-term Insurance Act,Act 53 of 1998. ‚Äúshort-term policy‚Äù means an engineering policy, a guarantee policy, a liability policy, a miscellaneous policy, a motor policy, an accident and health policy, a property policy or a transportation policy, or a contract comprising a combination of any of those policies. The definition also includes a contract whereby any such contract is renewed or varied. The division of insurance business into short- and long-term insurance business is for administrative purposes. Most short-term insurance is indemnity insurance, but short-term insurance is not restricted to indemnity insurance, since an \\"accident and health policy\\" belongs to the class of capital insurance. Long-term insurance, by the same token, is not confined to capital insurance, because \\"fund insurance\\" appears to be a case of indemnity insurance. \\"In the final analysis,\\" writes Reinecke, \\"the real difference between long-term and short- term insurance is not clear.\\"General Principles 6.  Formation of the insurance contract  The basis of contractual liability, where the parties to a contract do not misunderstand each other, is consensus ad idem animo contrahendi. In those exceptional cases in which the parties misunderstand each other and only apparent consent exists, liability appears to rest on the reasonable reliance by the contracting party on the existence of consensus. This is known in contract law as the reliance theory. Such consent may be termed ‚Äúconstructive consent.‚Äù Of course, there is always room also for the application of the doctrine of estoppel, if a litigant can satisfy its more stringent requirements, and if he wishes to avail himself of this remedy in order to hold a party bound to the appearance of consensus he has created. For a contract as such to exist, however, actual or constructive consent must be achieved. This is brought about by offer and acceptance. These general principles of the law of contract in South Africa also hold good for contracts of insurance, and must be applied to such contracts. It is sometimes maintained that a contract of insurance comes into existence as soon as the parties have agreed upon every material term of the contract they wish to make, such as * the person or property to be insured; * the event insured against; * the period of insurance; and * the amount of the premium. This suggests that the parties need not agree on terms other than material terms. For their contract to qualify as one of insurance, the parties must agree on the essentials of insurance. If they do not reach specific agreement, there can be no contract of insurance (although another type of contract may come into existence). For the contract to be valid, however, the parties must in fact agree on every term each of them regards as being a non-severable part of the proposed contract. This requirement is subject only to the ordinary rules creating contractual liability despite the absence of consensus. As a rule, the parties to a contract of insurance do not apply their minds to each specific term; they contract on the basis of the insurer's usual terms for the particular type of risk to be insured against. The contract of insurance comes into being only when consensus is reached. Until then, the anticipated contract does not provide cover, although the eventual contract may operate retrospectively. Pending the conclusion of their negotiations, the parties often conclude interim insurance to cover the proposer during the period prior to the final decision on the main contract. Interim-insurance cover is provided by means of a contract, and therefore also rests on consensus. Many facets of insurance business, including the conclusion of contracts, are transacted through insurance agents representing the respective parties. If, during the conclusion of the contract, a party is represented by an agent with authority to enter into the contract on behalf of his principal, the intention and acts of the agent must be taken into consideration in deciding whether a contract has come into existence.  Essential elements of an insurance contract  In British Oak Insurance v Atmore,1939 TPD 9. the locus classicus, the essentialia of a contract of insurance were enumerated as follows: * the person or property insured; * the risk insured against; * the amount payable by the insurer on the occurrence of the event insured against; * the premium; and * the period of the insurance cover. No specific formalities are required, but the regulations to the Short Term Insurance Act contain certain requirements for the purposes of issuing a policy. The policy document normally contains the contract.  Concepts in insurance law = Proposal  In general, insurers do not make binding offers to insure; rather, they invite the public (by invoking the aid of intermediaries or otherwise) to apply for insurance. The actual offer to contract is accordingly made by the proposed insured, almost invariably on a printed form issued by the insurer and completed or signed by the proposer. As formulated by insurers, this proposal form does not usually leave much room for bargaining between the parties. What bargaining there is usually is confined to matters which cannot be settled in advance, such as the amount of the insurance, the period of insurance and special circumstances relating to the risk. Occasionally the proposed insured may request a deletion or addition: for example, by way of endorsements, to be effected in respect of the insurer's standard form of contract. The premium is not normally recorded in the proposal form. Most other terms of the proposed contract are also not expressly stated, the intention being to contract on the usual terms of the insurer. In determining the usual terms of the insurer, evidence of other policies issued by the insurer is admissible. Once a reference to the usual terms is included in the contract, the insured actually agrees to them; he cannot afterwards be heard to say that he did not have the opportunity to ascertain the exact content of the terms. The proposal form invariably contains a series of questions put by the insurer which must be answered to obtain information necessary for calculating the risk. Apart from being a formal offer, the proposal form is therefore also a written record of representations made by the proposer. Generally, the proposer is required * to warrant the truth of his answers; and * to accept them as the basis of the proposed contract. There is a duty of disclosure, in other words. The proposal is normally incorporated into the formal insurance contract by reference. Although the above procedure represents the general position, consent may be achieved in any way the parties choose. For example, * an offer to take out insurance may be made by tendering a premium; or * an insured may offer to renew an existing contract by paying a premium without completing a fresh proposal form. If a proposal form submitted to the insurer has not been authorised by the prospective insured, it may not serve as an offer by him. A policy issued by the insurer in response to such an unauthorised offer may, however, itself constitute an offer to be accepted by the proposed insured. It is also possible that the proposal by the prospective insured is not acceptable to the insurer as it stands, but that the insurer is willing to contract on other terms. In such a case, a counteroffer may be made by the insurer. It may also happen that the insurer makes the offer from the outset, as in the case of coupon insurance or interim insurance.  Acceptance  Acceptance of an offer is an express or tacit statement of intention in which the offeree signifies his unconditional assent to the offer. In principle, the offeror must be notified of the offeree's decision to accept the offer. The insurer, as offeree, usually accepts the offer by sending to the proposer a policy accompanied by a covering letter which explains that the proposal has been accepted. Dispatching the policy is in itself sufficient to communicate acceptance. A demand for the premium by the insurer, and, in exceptional circumstances, receipt of the premium, may also operate as an acceptance. A firm acceptance of a proposal may even be contained in an interim cover note, although such a note is generally an acceptance of a proposal for temporary cover only.  Policy  Contracts of insurance need not be in writing to be valid, but the standard practice is to reduce them to writing. A document expressing the terms of a contract of insurance is called a \\"policy.\\"  Premium  A ‚Äúpremium‚Äù is primarily a sum of money. According to one Roman- Dutch authority, a premium may also consist in something other than money. If this were indeed the position, \\"it is rather strange that there was no discussion of the contingency that the premium may be defective.\\"Reinecke General Principles para 124. It has also been suggested, for modern law, that the definition of \\"premium\\" should be widened so as to encompass something other than money: \\"Although there is no objection in principle to the enforceability of such contracts, it is doubtful whether there is any need to bring a contract involving a non-monetary 'premium' under the umbrella of insurance.\\"Reinecke General Principles para 124. No judicial preference has as yet been expressed. The term ‚Äúpremium‚Äù is defined in insurance legislation, but the definition there does not shed any light on the nature of a premium.  Interim insurance  It sometimes takes a considerable time to finalise the preliminaries for the conclusion of a contract of insurance. In order to protect the proposed insured during the interval before the issue of a final policy, the parties frequently resort to temporary or interim insurance to cover the proposer immediately but for a limited period of time. This is common practice in the case of short-term insurance contracts, but it may be invoked in all other forms of insurance. Although limited in duration, interim insurance is nothing less than a fully-fledged contract of insurance. This being so, the proposed insured must observe the usual duty of good faith towards his insurer. Similarly, the contract must comply with all the requirements for the validity of insurance contracts in general. The contract of interim insurance is separate from and independent of the final contract of insurance following on the conclusion of an interim contract, although it may share some or most of the terms of the final contract. If a claim arises during the currency of the interim contract, it must be considered in terms of the interim contract itself, not in terms of the final contract. This may be of importance where only the final contract, not the interim contract, is voidable because of a misrepresentation or other unlawful conduct, and also where the terms of the two contracts differ. Granting insurance cover by way of interim insurance does not oblige the insurer to provide permanent cover. By the same token, the person enjoying interim cover is not compelled to accept permanent cover from the insurer merely because he has accepted interim cover. = Cover notes = The interim insurance contract is usually embodied in a document which is commonly known as a ‚Äúcover note,‚Äù but other expressions--‚Äúprotection note,‚Äù ‚Äúinterim policy,‚Äù ‚Äútemporary policy‚Äù and, inappropriately, ‚Äúinterim receipt‚Äù‚Äîoccur as well. Temporary insurance is sometimes granted in terms of a reminder to renew an existing insurance contract, and can be encountered in various other types of documents. Whether a document recording the terms of an interim contract of insurance may be regarded as the exclusive memorial of such a contract depends on the intention of the parties. A cover note may not normally be regarded as a ‚Äúpolicy‚Äù in the ordinary sense of the word. Nonetheless, the definitions of the various ‚Äúpolicies‚Äù in the Long-term Insurance Act, and in the Short-term Insurance Act, are wide enough to include cover notes and all other like documents recording insurance cover.  Insurable interest  The insured must prove that an insurable interest existed in order to prove loss. The test is whether the insured will incur financial loss, or will fail to derive an anticipated financial benefit, if the event insured against occurs. In principle, the object of insurance must be in existence at the time of the occurrence of the peril insured against. If the insured has no interest at the time of the occurrence of the event insured against, he cannot suffer any loss or damage. Since the function of insurable interest is to determine whether the insured has suffered a loss, the insured's interest, by virtue of the terms of the contract, must exist at the time of the materialisation of the peril insured against. If the insured does not possess an interest at that crucial time, there is no object secured by the insurance. Consequently, the insured can bring no claim under the contract for loss suffered. If the insured does not have an insurable interest in the object, the contract will be void and unenforceable, and regarded essentially as a gamble or wager. The purpose of the requirement of insurable interest is to distinguish insurance from wagering. The basic principle of insurance is to protect against loss; it is not concerned with the creation of opportunities for speculative gain. In the formative days of insurance law, things were quite different; insurance was in fact often indistinguishable from gambling. Excesses led in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries to the outright banning of life insurance, for example, in France, the Dutch Republic and Sweden. The more reasonable course, requiring an insurable interest as a prerequisite for the purchase of insurance, was pioneered in England, making insurance more than a mere game of chance, improving the repute of the insurance industry (formerly frowned upon as an aleatory contract), and gaining wider acceptance for it. As we have seen, South Africa formally imported the doctrine of insurable interest from England, but in 1977 the legislature repealed the colonial ordinances which had achieved this. The Appellate Division, in Mutual and Federal v Oudtshoorn Municipality, took their repeal to mean that the Roman-Dutch law of insurance is now the common law for insurance. \\"There is no South African statute which lays down the need for a so-called insurable interest,\\" and Roman-Dutch law had no discrete doctrine of insurable interest. It could be said to be implied, however, by the fact that Roman-Dutch law defined a contract of insurance as one which transfers a risk threatening the patrimony of the insured. Roman law also banned wagers. Whether or not an indirect economic interest is enough to constitute an insurable interest, as opposed to a mere wager, will depend on the facts of each case. In Littlejohn v Norwich Union Fire Insurance Society, a husband had taken out fire insurance in his own name over the contents of a shop owned by his wife. (They were married out of community of property.) The court found that he had an insurable interest, because he would obviously be in a worse position, in patrimonial terms, after his wife's property was burnt. In Phillips v General Accident Insurance, the court held that a husband had an insurable interest in his wife's jewellery, even though he was under no obligation to replace it. In Refrigerated Trucking v Zive NO, the owner of a vehicle was found to have an insurable interest in sustaining insurance for liability incurred by persons who drove his vehicles with his consent. In Lorcom Thirteen v Zurich Insurance, the bases for Lorcom's insurable interest in the ‚ÄúBuccaneer‚Äù fishing vessel were as follows: * Lorcom was the sole shareholder of the owner of the vessel. * In terms of a purchase agreement, Lorcom would become the owner on ‚Äúeffective date:‚Äù that is, upon full payment. * Lorcom had the right of use of the vessel. * Lorcom held the fishing permit. Below are some further examples of insurable interest: # An owner of property has an insurable interest to the full value of that property. # A person who has a right to performance has an insurable interest in that claim (to insure against the risk of non-performance). # A person who does not own property, but who possesses it in good faith (believing that he is the owner of that property), has an insurable interest to the full value of that property. # A person has an insurable interest in restricting increases in liabilities. For example, directors of a company may take out indemnity insurance in respect of the negligent decisions they may make. # A person has an unlimited interest in his own life and bodily integrity. # An insurer may take out insurance on the life of a spouse for an unlimited amount. # Parents and children are allowed to take out insurance on each other's lives, subject to some limitations: no more than R10,000 if the child is under six years old, and no more than R30,000 for children under fourteen. # Shareholders, directors and partners are allowed to take out ‚Äúkey- man‚Äù insurance on the lives of their co-shareholders or partners, as the case may be.  Duration of insurance contracts  Insurance contracts may endure for a definite or indefinite period. Usually the duration is stipulated in the insurance contract or policy document. The contract may terminate or be cancelled, as the case may be, * by giving the requisite notice for cancellation; * upon payment (as in the case of an endowment policy or life insurance); * in the event of total destruction of property, for which the insurer has paid; * if the insured exercises an election to renew a contract, thus giving rise to a new contract; and * if premiums are not paid timeously, in which case the policy will lapse.  Duty to disclose material facts  The doctrine of disclosure is based on the general doctrine of good faith. Usually there is a ‚Äúdeclaration‚Äù at the end of the proposal form that the answers to the questions in the proposal form are the basis of the policy. The proposer is usually required to warrant the truth of the answers. The proposal is incorporated by reference into the formal policy. The insurer has a right to avoid liability on the contract if the proposer misrepresents a material fact, or if he fails to disclose a material fact. In other words, a breach of the duty of good faith renders the contract voidable at the instance of the insurer, after he has been notified of the non-disclosure. Both positive and negative misrepresentation are recognised as grounds for avoiding the insurance contract.  Positive misrepresentation  To be unlawful or wrongful, the statement which constitutes a positive misrepresentation must be wholly false, or at least inaccurate. Whether a statement is false or inaccurate will, in the final analysis, have to be judged according to the convictions of the community. This is the general criterion for establishing wrongfulness. If the statement is wholly false and thus completely untrue, the issue is relatively simple. If, for example, a proposer for motor-vehicle insurance states in answer to a question in a proposal form that he has not been involved in an accident during the past three years, whereas in fact he has, the statement is obviously wholly false. The same may be said of a statement in a proposal for fire insurance that the premises to be insured are occupied by a particular person, whereas they are not; or that no proposal for similar insurance has been declined in the past, whereas in fact it has. The position is not always so straightforward. A statement may, for instance, be inaccurate because it is incomplete and so mislead the other party to the contract by the suppression of a part of the true facts. Thus, in answer to the question of whether or not a proposal or insurance has ever been declined or cancelled, a proposer may state that no proposal has ever been declined, thereby telling the truth, but omitting to say that a contract has been cancelled. This is a substantially inaccurate statement, in spite of the fact that it is literally and completely true as far as the declining of a proposal is concerned. If, in answer to the question of whether or not proposals have been made to other insurers, a proposer answers, ‚ÄúYes, to the XYZ Company,‚Äù while he has also submitted proposals to a number of other insurance companies, the answer may be said to be partially true but substantially inaccurate. Likewise, a simple and unqualified request for particulars of previous losses, claims or insurance contracts means in principle that all such particulars are to be furnished. A proposer is expected to answer questions not only accurately, but as completely as is reasonable according to the convictions of the community.  Negative misrepresentation  A negative misrepresentation, or a misrepresentation per omissionem, is a wrongful failure by one of the parties to a contract of insurance to disclose, during the course of the negotiations preceding the contract, certain facts within his knowledge. As a result, the other party is induced to enter into the contract, or to agree to specific terms thereof, whereas he would not have done so had those facts been disclosed. The failure may be accompanied by fault; it may even be completely innocent. It is the nature of the act or conduct involved which distinguishes this type of misrepresentation from positive misrepresentation. Although it may also by typified as a statement of fact, the act creating the wrong impression is not a positive one; it is negative, in that it fails to remove an existing wrong impression by not disclosing facts which would remove that impression. The failure or omission may take the form of active concealment‚Äîthat is, it may be intention‚Äîor inadvertent non-disclosure, which means that it may be negligent or even innocent.  Difference  The distinction between a positive misstatement and a negative non-disclosure is not always clearcut. In many instances, the same conduct may qualify as both. A failure to state all the material facts in answer to a question may amount to both a negative and a positive misrepresentation, inasmuch as the incomplete answer may create the impression that all the facts have been furnished.  Utmost good faith  In modern case law and literature, insurance contracts have been classified as contracts ‚Äúof the utmost good faith‚Äù (contracts uberrimae fidei). In general, contracts of this type have been said to impose a duty on the contracting parties to display the utmost good faith towards one another * during the course of their negotiations preceding the contract; and also (albeit exceptionally, and in circumstances less clearly defined) * during the existence of the contract itself. The duty of utmost good faith (or its companion, an exceptionally high degree of good faith) appears in the case law and literature in connection with contracts which are typified by a relationship of close trust between the contracting parties. The notion of utmost good faith, and the view that the insurance contract, or for that matter any other contract, may be a contract of the utmost good faith, was rejected in Mutual and Federal v Oudtshoorn Municipality.1985 (1) SA 419 (A). Acknowledging that the origin of the phrase ‚Äúuberrima fides‚Äù was doubtful, but noting that it apparently made its appearance in English law in 1850, the court was ‚Äúunable to find any Roman- Dutch authority in support of the proposition that a contract of marine insurance is a contract uberrima fidei‚Äù. The court rejected the expression as ‚Äúalien, vague [and] useless [... and] without any particular meaning in law,‚Äù explaining * that ‚Äúthere is no magic in the expression;‚Äù * that ‚Äúthere are no degrees of good faith;‚Äù * that ‚Äúit is entirely inconceivable that there could be a little, more or most (utmost) good faith;‚Äù and * that ‚Äúthere is no room for uberrima fides as a third category of faith in our law.‚Äù Despite these remarks, and despite the fact that the House of Lords has subsequently, with reference to them, noted that ‚Äúthe concept of uberrima fides does not appear to have derived from civil law and [that] it has been regarded as unnecessary in civilian systems,‚Äù Reinecke observes that \\"old habits die slowly,\\" and that insurance contracts are still occasionally referred to as \\"contracts of the utmost good faith.\\" This usage, he urges, \\"must be deprecated,\\" at least insofar as it suggests that the distinction between utmost good faith and good faith involves a difference of principle rather than merely one of degree.  Good faith  Contracts of insurance, like all other types of contract, are therefore contracts of good faith. The feature of good faith is not an essential or distinguishing feature of the insurance contract. Despite rejecting the notion of utmost good faith, the court in M&F; v Oudtshoorn did not set out the content of the requirement of good faith as it pertains to insurance contracts. Accordingly, past authority which dealt with the content of the notion of utmost good faith must still be consulted for guidance, while bearing in mind that, in principle, any duty concerned is not a duty of exceptional good faith, but simply one of good faith. The facts of M&F; v Oudtshoorn were these: A light aircraft collided with pole carrying electric power lines just outside the boundary of the Oudtshoorn aerodrome. The owner of the aircraft successfully sued the Municipality for the value of the aircraft. The Municipality tried to recover the amount from its insurers (Mutual and Federal), but the insurers successfully resisted the claim: When the policy had been negotiated, the Municipality had failed to disclose the close proximity of the aerodrome to pole and power lines, which constituted a hazard to aircraft using the aerodrome at night. The court held that there is a duty on the insured and the insurer to disclose to each other, prior to the conclusion of the contract of insurance, every fact relative and material to the risk or to the assessment of the premium. The duty of disclosure relates to material facts, of which parties had actual or constructive knowledge prior to the conclusion of the contract of insurance. Breach of the duty of disclosure amounts to mala fides or fraud, and the aggrieved party may avoid contract.  Materiality test  A representation relating to material facts cannot be wrongful. The test for materiality is, in principle, an objective test. In M&F; v Oudtshoorn, the Appellate Division formulated it thusly: whether or not, having regard to the circumstances, the undisclosed information is reasonably relevant to the risk, or to the assessment of the premium. In other words, are the facts of such a nature that knowledge of them would, objectively seen, probably influence a represent in deciding whether or not to conclude the contract, and on what terms to do so? The question, then, is a question of the effect of the non-disclosure: Would disclosure influence * the decision of an insurer to accept a risk; * the terms of risk acceptance; and * the amount of the premium? If the answer is in the affirmative, the undisclosed information or facts are material. The court applies a version of the reasonable-person test: that is, whether a reasonable person would have regarded the particular facts as relevant to the decision of an insurer concerning the assessment and underwriting of the risk. Some decisions use the standard of the reasonable insurer, others the reasonable proposer. Reinecke argues that the two are not incompatible: \\"A single combined test for materiality would be whether, according to the opinion of a reasonable person in the position of the particular proposer for instance, the facts in point are likely to influence the decision of a reasonable insurer when it comes to assessing the risk.\\" According to M&F; v Oudtshoorn, the \\"reasonable man test\\" is applied to determine whether or not, from the point of view of the reasonable man, or of the average prudent person, the undisclosed facts or information is reasonably relative to the risk or the assessment of the premium. The test, then, refers to those facts which are objectively and reasonably related to an insurer's decision when all the circumstances of the case are taken into account. In terms of section 59(1)(b) of the Long-Term Insurance Act, and section 53(1)(b) of the Short-Term Insurance Act, > The representation or non-disclosure shall be regarded as material if a > reasonable, prudent person would consider that the particular information > constituting the representation or which was not disclosed, as the case may > be, should have been correctly disclosed to the insurer so that the insurer > could form its own view as to the effect of such information on the > assessment of the relevant risk. It is, according to the Appellate Division in President Versekeringsmaatskappy v Trust Bank,1989 (1) SA 208 (A). a matter of perspective. The question is not whether a reasonable person would regard the information as affecting the risk, but whether a reasonable person would have considered that the information should be disclosed so that the insurer could take it into account and come to its own decision concerning the risk.  Content of the duty  The contract is voidable at the instance of the insurer if the insurer can prove * that the non-disclosed fact was material; * that it was within the knowledge of the insured; and * that it was not communicated to the insurer. The duty to disclose includes * answering all questions on the proposal form correctly; and * disclosing all material facts.  Knowledge  It has been said that the duty in question \\"is a duty to disclose, and you cannot disclose what you do not know,\\" and that the \\"obligation to disclose, therefore, necessarily depends on the knowledge you possess.\\" This implies that the duty imposed is merely to disclose facts already within that party's knowledge; apparently, on this dictum, it does not include an obligation to collect information so as to become able to disclose it. South African law, however, long appeared to favour the view that only material facts within one's actual or personal knowledge were included in the duty of disclosure. In M&F; v Oudtshoorn, however, the court stated in passing that constructive knowledge‚Äîthat is to say, knowledge which is imputed or presumed‚Äîis also included in the duty of disclosure. Knowledge is constructive, and is imputed to an insured, * if he ought to have had that knowledge‚Äîthat is, if he ought to have known of it‚Äîin the ordinary course of business; * if he would have ascertained or acquired that knowledge if he had made such inquiries as a reasonable business person would make; and * if his employee acquired actual knowledge of facts in the course of his employment, and was under a duty to communicate this knowledge to the insured. Reinecke considers that \\"this broad view of the duty of disclosure may arguably extend it unjustifiably and impose an unreasonable burden on the insured.\\" In Anderson Shipping v Guardian National Insurance,1987 (3) SA 506 (A). a vehicle owned by Anderson Shipping was involved in an accident with another vehicle, whose owners claimed damages from Anderson Shipping. The driver of Anderson Shipping's vehicle had previously been found guilty of driving under the influence of alcohol. Guardian National Insurance denied liability on the basis that Anderson Shipping had failed to disclose that its procedure for employing drivers did not require applicants to produce their drivers‚Äô licenses for inspection. The question to be answered was whether Anderson Shipping had constructive knowledge of the undisclosed fact. It was argued * that Anderson Shipping could have ascertained the fact if it had made such enquiries as reasonable business prudence required it to make; and * that the knowledge of Anderson Shipping's operations manager, who had hired Anderson Shipping's drivers, had to be imputed to Anderson Shipping. The court rejected both arguments and held * that ordinary business prudence merely required Anderson Shipping to ascertain whether its system of hiring drivers was working satisfactorily, and that it was not incumbent on Anderson Shipping to carry out a detailed investigation as to the manner in which the system operated; and * that, although Anderson Shipping's operations manager knew that his system of employing drivers did not require the production of a driver's license in every case, he was merely an agent to employ drivers, and was therefore under no duty to communicate this knowledge to Anderson Shipping. Although, then, the Appellate Division in Anderson Shipping v General National Insurance refrained from deciding the point, it assumed that an insured (at least, a corporate insured like Anderson Shipping) should be deemed to know every circumstance which, in the ordinary course of business, ought to be known by it.  Material facts  Information that could affect the insurer's decision‚Äîwhether or not to enter into the contract of insurance, or to charge a higher premium‚Äîmay include the following: * that the subject matter is exposed to a higher degree of danger than normal; * that the liability of the insurer is greater than normal; * that the insured may cause harm to occur through his own conduct; * that the value of the insurer's rights of subrogation would be reduced; and * that the insured is in financial difficulty and may have trouble paying the insurance premiums. The insurance record of the proposer may also be salient.  Non-material facts  Non- material facts include * any circumstance that reduces the risk; * any circumstance that is known, or presumed to be known, by the insurer; * any circumstance that is not necessary to disclose as a result of an express or implied warranty; and * any circumstances regarding which the insurer has waived its right to disclosure. In Qilingele v South African Mutual Life,1993 (1) SA 69 (A). an applicant for life insurance did not want to undergo a medical examination. To avoid it, he applied for three separate life-insurance policies with three insurance companies for small amounts which, when added together, would otherwise have required him to undergo a medical examination. Asked in a proposal form whether any other insurance company was considering offering him life cover, he falsely answered, ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù The applicant also signed a warranty that he had not made any other application to any other insurer. The court considered whether the falsehood of the misrepresentation was such that it probably would have affected the assessment of the risk undertaken by the particular insurer. This was done by comparing an assessment of the risk on the basis of facts distorted by the misrepresentation with what the assessment would have been on the facts had they been truly stated. The court found that the disparity would be significant if the insurer, had it known the truth, * probably would have outright declined to undertake the particular risk; or * probably would have undertaken the risk on different terms. In Fine v General Accident Fire & Life Assurance,1915 AD 213. one question on the proposal form was this: ‚ÄúHas the insurance now proposed been declined in any other office?‚Äù The proposer answered, ‚ÄúNo‚Äù‚Äîeven though a fire policy over the same property had been issued, and subsequently cancelled, by another insurance company. The statement that the proposed insurance was literally correct, but the insurance company repudiated the claim based on a breach of the duty to disclose material facts. The court held that the cancellation of a previous policy is indeed a material fact that the insured should disclose, since it might well influence the insurer in deciding whether or not it will take the insurance risk, and at what premium. In Commercial Union v Lotter,1999 (2) SA 147 (SCA). the buyer of a luxury motor vehicle did not disclose to the insurer that the vehicle had been stolen from another country. When the vehicle was stolen again, the insurance company repudiated the claim. The court upheld the company's repudiation on the basis that material facts had not been disclosed. The insurance company argued that its right of subrogation was diminished by the fact that the vehicle in question was a stolen vehicle when the insurance policy was taken out: The insured had no title to the vehicle, so the insurance company could not sue a negligent third party, in terms of its right of subrogation, for the full costs of repairing any damage to the vehicle. In Santam v Van Schalkwyk,2002 (4) SA (1) 93 (O). a father in Kroonstad lent his son in Florida the deposit for a motor vehicle. The father took out an insurance policy, the car was subsequently stolen, and the insurer repudiated due to father's failure to disclose * that the vehicle had been bought by the son; * that the vehicle was used exclusively by the son; and * that the vehicle was kept in Florida, not in Kroonstad. The court held that a proposer has a legal duty to disclose to his insurer all facts within his knowledge which a reasonable person would consider material to the assessment of the risk or the premium. On the facts, and in the opinion of a reasonable person, the undisclosed information would have impacted the risk assessment. Expert evidence was led to show that the risk of theft was much greater in Florida than in Kroonstad. In Mutual & Federal v Da Costa,2008 (3) SA 439 (SCA). an insured vehicle was described as a ‚Äú1991 model Mercedes Benz 230E,‚Äù when in fact it was a built-up vehicle consisting of a combination of a 1998 model Mercedes Benz 200 and a 1990 model Mercedes Benz 230. Da Costa claimed indemnification under his insurance policy, but Mutual & Federal argued that it was liable under the policy only for a car that matched the description contained in the policy; the mismatch, according to the insurance company, amounted to a material misrepresentation or non-disclosure. The SCA found that, without any evidence on materiality, a court could assume that a misstatement of the year of manufacture of a motor vehicle is per se a material misstatement. The SCA did allow for an exception, however: A misstated fact will be taken as a material fact, without any evidence having been led on the point, if the ‚Äúfacts speak for themselves.‚Äù The court held that the present dispute was not such a case, and therefore found for Da Costa. In AA Mutual Life v Singh,1991 (3) SA 514 (A). the policy in question was a ten-year endowment policy, coupled with life cover. AA advertised the policy as including ‚Äúfree life cover [...] available free of medical evidence [...] no medical questions whatsoever.‚Äù AA instructed its brokers to market the policy on this basis, and to sell it to applicants who were actively engaged in their usual occupations and fit enough to lead normal lives. AA's broker told Singh, the insured in casu, that she did not have to disclose anything about her health, and that the proposal form which she signed did not require her to provide medical details. AA subsequently sought to avoid liability on the ground that the insured had failed to disclose that she was suffering from cervical cancer. The court held that AA had waived any right which it had to have the insured's state of health disclosed.  Warranties  Insurance warranties are strict contractual undertakings by the insured * that, in the case of affirmative warranties, certain representations are accurate; or Chicken feet * that, in the case of promissory warranties, certain duties will be performed. No particular formal or technical wording is required to establish a warranty. There are, however, a few general requirements. In order to establish that a term in an insurance contract is an insurance warranty, it must be proved * that the term was intended to form part of the contract (in other words, that it was not a ‚Äúmere representation‚Äù); and * that the term is in the nature of a strict undertaking, with the debtor agreeing to be bound, come what may. Both these requirements for an insurance warranty may be reconciled with the requirements laid down by the law of contract for other, non-insurance warranties. According to English insurance law, a term will qualify as an insurance warranty only if it is a \\"vital term,\\" entailing a right to cancel. English law in this respect is at variance with the South African law of contract, according to which non-vital terms may also qualify as warranties. Nevertheless, it is the English view that has been received in the South African case law on insurance. A term may be \\"vital,\\" first and foremost, because of the importance of its subject matter. If the subject matter of a term in an insurance contract is material to the assessment of the risk, it will be regarded as a vital term, and may, therefore, qualify as a warranty. Breach of a vital term will amount to a serious form of positive malperformance, justifying cancellation of the contract.  Affirmative Warranties  In the case of affirmative warranties, the insured warrants the truth of a representation relating to the present or the past. Affirmative warranties may be sub-divided into * warranties of fact; * warranties of knowledge; and * warranties of opinion. Warranties of fact have the effect of warranting that a state of affairs either does or does not exist, irrespective of insured's knowledge thereof. A warranty of knowledge is a guarantee that, to the insured's knowledge, a state of affairs does or does not exist. Forgetfulness would not necessary excuse the insured; he must apply his mind. Warranties of opinion should be distinguished from warranties of fact and knowledge. In the case of warranties of opinion, the insured provides estimates or other information typical of an opinion. Where a proposer for insurance in respect of a stack of hay stated that the stack was estimated to yield a certain quantity of wheat and chaff, and warranted his answers, the court held that he did not warrant that the stack would in fact yield the quantities stated, and that the insured did not commit a breach of warranty if his estimate was fair and reasonable. The insured, in other words, did not warrant the existence of certain facts, or his knowledge concerning such facts; he gave a warranty only in respect of his opinion. It is not always easy to determine whether a warranty relates to a state of affairs (and thus to a fact), or to the insured's opinion about certain matters. Ultimately, it depends on how the question is construed. A tendency identified on the part of English courts has been to treat questions apparently eliciting the insured's opinion as demanding statements of fact; the same appears true of local decisions.  Promissory warranties  Promissory warranties are also known (more correctly, since all warranties are promissory, involving as they do a promise or obligation to perform) as ‚Äúcontinuing warranties.‚Äù They are undertakings by the insured pertaining to his future conduct during the period of the insurance policy. In Cole v Bloom,1961 (3) SA 422 (A). the insurer avoided liability in respect of a policy containing a promissory warranty that all doors, windows and roofs of a salesman's vehicle (used to convey samples) would be closed and locked when the vehicle was left unattended.the courts apply the strict approach when it comes to promissory warranties as they are not governed by the statute of Insurance Act.  Breach of warranties  Breach of a warranty amounts to breach of contract. The burden of proof lies with the insurer. Breach of warranty is irreversible; it cannot be undone by subsequent conduct. It is important to distinguish between relative and absolute warranties. This amounts to an issue of interpretation.  Relative warranties  Relative warranties are general in their content; they are not specific statements of what is required of the insured. The ‚Äúreasonable person‚Äù is used as a yardstick to measure the insured's conduct in relation to an alleged breach of warranty. An example of a general warranty is the \\"iron- safe clause,\\" which is frequently included in fire-insurance policies. In terms of an iron-safe clause, the insured warrants that he will keep a complete set of books, showing a true and accurate record of all business transactions and stock-in-hand, and that the books will be locked in a fire- proof safe or removed to another building at night and at all times when the premises are not open for business. In Kliptown Clothing v Marine & Trade Insurance1961 (1) SA 103 (A). the plaintiff, a retail general dealer, obtained a burglary policy from the defendant. Subsequently, the plaintiff suffered burglaries. In an action claiming a declaration that the defendant was obliged to make good the loss, Marine & Trade Insurance pleaded breach by the plaintiff of a warranty > that the insured keeps, and during the whole of the currency of the policy > shall keep, a complete set of books, accounts and stock sheets or stock > books, showing a true and accurate record of all business transactions and > stock in hand, and that such books, accounts and stock sheets or stock books > shall be locked in a fire-proof safe or removed to another building at night > and at all times when the premises are not actually open for business. Marine & Trade Insurance alleged * that there was no (or alternatively no complete or accurate) record of the articles or goods sold by the plaintiff, or of the cost thereof; * that the plaintiff had failed to keep stock sheets or stock books showing a true and accurate record of stock in hand; and * that the plaintiff had failed to keep a true or accurate record of all business transactions. The Appellate Division held that the warranty meant * that the insured had guaranteed that his practice was, and would continue to be, to keep a complete set of books, annual accounts and annual stock sheets or stock books; * that he was not obliged, because of the insurance, to bring into existence such books, etc., at any earlier date or in any different form, whether in respect of contemporaneity or in respect of the details recorded, than was required by proper accountancy practice; and * that he was not obliged to keep, in a safe or at all, any records other than those expressly mentioned in the warranty. As the defendant had failed to prove either a general breach of the warranty arising out of what the plaintiff had failed to keep in a safe, or a particular breach based on the recording in the books of the purchase of certain articles, the court found for the plaintiff.  Absolute warranties  Absolute warranties provide a specific or express indication of what is required of the insured, who must comply exactly; if he does not, breach of the warranty will occur. ‚ÄúSubstantial performance‚Äù is not enough; there must be exact performance. In Jordan v New Zealand Insurance, for example, the plaintiff had stated, in the proposal form for the insurance of a motor car, his age at his next birthday as twenty-two, when in fact it would be twenty-three. The court held that there was no room for the contention that the incorrectness of the answer was not material; nor was there any room for the application of the doctrine of \\"substantial performance\\" in considering the truthfulness or otherwise of the answers.  Insured‚Äôs defences against breach of warranty  The insured may have the following defences against a claim that he has breached a warranty: * The insurer may have waived compliance with the warranty. * The insurer may be estopped from relying on breach of warranty. * There may have been a change in circumstances that has the effect that the warranty is no longer relevant or applicable. * The warranty may not be lawful.  Remedies for breach of warranty  In principle, the same remedies exist for breach of warranty as exist for breach of any contract. One must, however, distinguish the effects of breach of warranty from those of breach of contract through misrepresentation: * Cancellation of the contract on the basis of a breach of warranty does not render the entire contract a nullity. Depending on divisibility, cancellation merely extinguishes a vested claim of the insured, or even the insurer's basic obligation to indemnify the insured. Accordingly, the insurer may still rely on terms unaffected by the cancellation: an arbitration clause, for example. * In the case of a reliance on misrepresentation, on the other hand, the insurer avoids entire contract, and accordingly cannot rely on any of its terms.  Problems  The strict common-law approach, which requires exact performance of an undertaking that has not necessarily been established as a ‚Äúmaterial‚Äù aspect of the contract (and risk assessment), and entitles the insurer to cancel a contract on the basis of a breach of warranty despite the fact that the representation complained of concerns an immaterial inaccuracy, or a matter with no bearing at all on the risk insured against, has led to absurd results in some cases. Jordan v New Zealand, discussed above, is one such example: Jordan stated that his age at his next birthday would be twenty-two, whereas in fact it would be twenty-three. Since this statement was warranted, the insurer was entitled to repudiate liability, in spite of what most would regard as the immateriality of the inaccuracy, and where, in fact, it \\"was actually to the advantage of the insurer.\\"Reinecke General Principles para 367.  Statutory Curtailment  As a result of such absurd results, and the potential for more, statutory reform introduced certain curtailments regarding remedies for breach of warranties. Section 63 of the Insurance ActAct 27 of 1943. (the governing legislation at the time) was amended in 1969. The effect of the amendment was that the insurer was not permitted to set aside a contract on the grounds of breach of an affirmative warranty unless the insurer could prove that the correctness of the statement (or representation or warranty) was material to the assessment of the risk at the time the policy was issued or renewed. The purpose of the amendment was to protect the insured against repudiations by insurers based on inconsequential inaccuracies or trivial misstatements in insurance proposal forms, even if they were warranted to be true. In 1989, the Insurance Act of 1943 was repealed. Its section 63(3) was re-enacted, without any amendment as to substance, in section 59(1)(a) of the Long-term Insurance Act and section 53(1)(a) of the Short-term Insurance Act, which provided * that the policy shall not be invalidated; * that the obligation of the long- term insurer shall not be excluded or limited; and * that the obligations of the policyholder shall not be increased, on account of any representation or failure to disclose information made to the insurer which is not true, whether or not the representation or disclosure has been warranted to be true and correct, unless that representation or non-disclosure is such as to be likely to have materially affected the assessment of the risk under the policy concerned at the time of its issue or at the time of any renewal or variation thereof. = Intention of the legislature = The Act tries to prevent insurers from exploiting warranties made by the insured in order to avoid paying out on claims. The Act is intended to ensure that an insurer will have no remedy on account of an immaterial incorrect representation, whether that representation was warranted or not. = Effect of the statutory reform = The insurer is now still liable to pay out on a claim if the breach of warranty relates only to inconsequential inaccuracies. The insurer is not liable, however, if the breach of warranty relates to facts that are material to the risk. The test for misrepresentation will apply: * For misrepresentation by omission, the assessment of the risk is based on the objective standard of the \\"reasonable person.\\" * For misrepresentation by commission, or positive misrepresentation, the assessment of the risk is based on the subjective standard of the particular insurer. = Scope of the amendments = Instead of ‚Äúwarranties,‚Äù the Acts use the expressions ‚Äúrepresentations,‚Äù ‚Äúnon-disclosure‚Äù and ‚Äúfailure to disclose.‚Äù The meaning of these words is important: * A ‚Äúrepresentation‚Äù is a statement, made to the insurer, before the contract is entered into. It is not a term of the contract; it does not become part of the contract. * ‚ÄúNon-disclosure‚Äù or ‚Äúfailure to disclose‚Äù is also a pre-contractual omission to provide information. If, then, the warranty is not based on a ‚Äúrepresentation,‚Äù or ‚Äúfailure to disclose‚Äù or ‚Äúnon-disclosure,‚Äù the insurer will still be able to avoid liability under the contract. As a general rule, the words ‚Äúrepresentation,‚Äù ‚Äúfailure to disclose‚Äù and ‚Äúnon-disclosure‚Äù refer to existing facts as well as to future events. The controversy of granting damages for misrepresentation of a future event has generally been removed by statutory reform. The question of materiality is of assistance here.See Reinecke para 369 for clarification.  Subrogation  Subrogation is the right of the insurer, having indemnified the insured in terms of the policy, to receive the benefit of all the rights of the insured against third parties. The insurer may take charge of litigation against third parties liable for loss to the insured. The proceedings are in the name of the insured, with the insurer as dominus litis. Subrogation, then, is essentially a right of recourse without transfer of rights. The objectives of subrogation are as follows: * to prevent the insured from receiving double satisfaction (that is, from recovering both from the insurance company and from a third party in respect of the same loss); and * to enable the insurance company to recoup what was paid out to the insured. By affording the insurer a right of redress, the cost of insurance to the public is kept down, since the insurer may recoup its loss from a source other than premium income. This, indeed, is the main purpose of subrogation. *to make sure the 3rd negligent party does not go scott-free.  Requirements  The following are the requirements of subrogation: * A valid insurance contract must be in existence. * The insurer must have indemnified the insured. * The loss of the insured must have been fully compensated by the insurer. * The right must be capable of being subrogated.  Rights of the insurer  The insurer has a right of recourse against a third party for loss where the insurer has paid the insured the cover for such loss. The insurer may institute a claim against the third party on behalf of the insured as dominus litis. The insurer also has a right to information and assistance from the insured, together with a right to preservation of the claim, which usually takes the form of a clause in insurance contracts which requires the insured to take the necessary steps to protect the insurer's right to subrogation (even if the requirements for subrogation have not yet been met in full). In Commercial Union v Lotter,1999 (2) SA 147 (SCA). the court held that the fact that the insured vehicle was a stolen vehicle compromised the appellant's right of subrogation. Having satisfied the claim of the insured, the insurer was entitled to be placed in the insured's position in respect of all rights and remedies against other parties which were vested in the insured in relation to the subject-matter of the insurance. In a case such as the present, however, where the insured vehicle was a stolen one, an action instituted by Commercial Union (against a negligent third party who had damaged the vehicle) could be successfully resisted on the basis that Lotter (and thus Commercial Union under its right of subrogation) had no title in the vehicle.  Difference between subrogation and cession  Subrogation allows the insured to retain his personal right. This is not the case with cession, which involves a transfer of the right in terms of an actual agreement. The effect of this difference or distinction is that, if the insured waives his right to claim against a third-party wrongdoer, the insurer would not be able to claim against the wrongdoer, as the latter is absolved of duty to pay. With cession, in contrast, the insurer acquires all of the rights of the insured to proceed against the third party, and has to sue in its own name.  Reinstatement  If a reinstatement clause exists, and if loss occurs, the insurer has the option either * of indemnifying the insured in money; or * of replacing or repairing the damaged property. This is what is known as \\"reinstatement.\\" This election lies entirely with the insurer; the insured has no say in the matter. If the insurer elects reinstatement, it has the further option either * of replacement of the object with a similar object; or * of restoration of the object to its condition before accident or risk occurred. If the insurer elects to restore an object, it would appear also to have the right to choose who will undertake the restoration or repairs. When the insurer decides to reinstate, it must notify the insured, after which the election is binding; the insurer may not thereafter change its mind. Notice is to be given within the time allowed by the contract, or within a reasonable time: * If notice is not given in terms of the contract, or within a reasonable time, the insurer must indemnify the insured with money. * If notice is given, but the insurer is in mora (i.e. has delayed), the insurer is in breach of its duty to reinstate, and therefore in breach of contract (as debtor). The usual contractual remedies apply. The insured has a duty to cooperate with the insurer in order to effect the reinstatement. Failure to cooperate would amount to breach of contract (as creditor). Reinstatement may therefore be described as \\"direct compensation\\", because the purpose of reinstatement is to put the insured in the same or similar position as before the loss occurred.  Reinsurance  One insurance company may purchase insurance from another insurance company for the purposes of risk management. Reinsurance has the effect of transferring the risk‚Äîthat is to say, the \\"insured risk\\"‚Äîfrom the insurer to the reinsurer. This allows the insurer to increase its policy limits, taking on a higher risk, since the risk is partly carried by the reinsurer. The two main categories of reinsurance arrangements are # facultative reinsurance; and # treaty reinsurance. Within these two categories, furthermore, there are two main kinds of coverage: # proportional reinsurance; and # non-proportional reinsurance. Both facultative and treaty reinsurance can be written on a proportional or non-proportional basis. Both these bases occur in a variety of often highly involved permutations.  Facultative reinsurance  Facultative reinsurance is the reinsurance of a particular risk under a single policy (for a single or specific risk). It is facultative in the sense that the reinsurer has the choice to accept or reject the particular risk in question. This type of reinsurance arrangement is \\"cumbersome,\\" writes Reinecke,General Principles para 526. because a separate negotiation is required for each separate risk which an insurer wishes to pass on to a reinsurer.  Treaty reinsurance  Treaty reinsurance is an arrangement between the insurer and the reinsurer in terms of which the latter agrees to take over all or part of the former's risk of a particular class or description for a specified period of time.  Proportional reinsurance  Proportional reinsurance, which may arise in both facultative and treaty reinsurance, refers to a pro rata sharing of risks and losses, and premiums and income, between the primary insurer and the reinsurer.  Non- proportional reinsurance  In the case of non-proportional reinsurance (or \\"excess\\" reinsurance), the reinsurer bears that part of insurer's loss which exceeds an agreed threshold, while the insurer retains the risk or loss below the threshold, or else reinsures this with a different reinsurer.  Terms and benefit details  In respect of the terms and benefit details contained in the reinsurance agreement, the same principles apply as for ordinary insurance contracts.  Retrocession  Reinsurance companies may also themselves purchase reinsurance. This is known as \\"retrocession.\\" The \\"retrocessionair\\" grants reinsurance to the \\"retrocedent.\\"  Under-insurance  Under-insurance occurs where the sum insured is less than the amount of the loss that the insured would suffer if the risk should materialise. For example, a house is insured for R100,000, but its market value is R150,000. A person in such circumstances may only recover loss * that is actually suffered; and * up to the sum that is insured.  Over-insurance  Over- insurance occurs when the sum insured is greater than the loss that the insured would suffer if the risk materialises. For example, a house is insured for R200,000, but its market value is R150,000. Even here, the insured may not recover more than the loss he actually suffers.  Double Insurance  It is possible to insure the same interest against the same risk with two or more insurers. Double insurance does not amount to over-insurance, unless the total of all the insurances is more than the total value of the interest. If loss occurs, the insured may choose to recover his entire loss from one insurer, or a proportionate share from each insurer, as long as the total amount claimed is not greater than the loss actually suffered.  Contribution  Most policies have a ‚Äúcontribution clause,‚Äù which means that, if an insurer pays more than its proportionate share to the insured, the insurer has a right to reclaim a contribution from the other insurers. This is because the insurer has the right to pay only its proportionate share of the loss. Insurance contracts often contain clauses to the effect that the insured must disclose other existing or subsequent policies. In the absence of such a clause, the insured is under no obligation to disclose policies that he may have with other insurance companies. = Requirements = The following are the requirements for the insurer's right to contribution: * The insurer claiming contribution must have discharged its liability to the insured. * The insurer claiming contribution must have paid more than its proportionate share of the loss. This applies both to total and to partial loss. * Payment by the insurer claiming contribution must have been in respect of an interest which was the object of double-insurance at the time of the loss. = Determining proportionate loss = Where the insurance contracts in a situation of double insurance are virtually identical in all material respects (including the amount insured), loss is to be apportioned equally between the insurers. Where the contracts differ only as to the amounts insured, all the amounts must be added up and compared with the amount of the loss. Each insurer is then liable for such a proportion of the loss as the amount underwritten by it bears to the aggregate amount insured by all the contracts. Where the contracts differ substantially, there may be complications. One contract may, for example, insure the common object amongst other objects, without apportioning to it a specific amount. Average clauses may also be present.Average clauses seek to avoid the disadvantage to insurers of the insured's claiming up to the limit of the sum insured, irrespective of whether his loss is total or partial, by encouraging prospective insured persons to insure up to the full value of their interest in the object of the risk. The law is silent on the rules governing the apportionment of loss. In practice, negotiation between the parties is necessary.  Prescription of Claims  In general, civil claims prescribe after three years from when the debt arose. Most policies contain time-bar clauses, requiring the insured to claim within a fixed period of time after the loss insured against has occurred. If an insurer repudiates liability for a claim, the insured has a specific time period within which to issue summons against the insurer, failing which the insurer will be released from liability: that is to say, the claim against the insurer will prescribe. The purpose of time-bar clauses is to provide legal certainty for the insurer. An insurer has an interest in knowing, within a reasonable time after repudiating a claim, whether it will face litigation or not. In Barkhuizen v Napier, a short-term insurance policy contained a time-bar clause to the effect that the insurer would not be liable under a claim unless summons was served within ninety days of repudiation of the claim. Summons was served two years after the claim was rejected by the insurer. The Constitutional Court upheld the time-bar clause, but opened the door for these clauses to be scrutinised in future on the basis that they could unfairly discriminate against the insured's right of access to the courts.s 34 of the Constitution. ‚ÄúFairness, justice and reasonableness‚Äù is the yardstick by which to determine whether or not a contractual term (including a time-bar clause) should be upheld if such term infringes a constitutional right. In Bredenkamp v Standard Bank,2010 (4) SA 468 (SCA). for example, the Supreme Court of Appeal was confronted with a clause in a contract between banker and client entitling the banker unilaterally to cancel the contract for no cause at all, and without hearing the client. The banker subsequently cancelled the contract on the ground that the client posed a risk to the bank's reputation. The court found, relying on Barkhuizen, that the question of the fairness of exercising contractual rights does not arise when it involves no public-policy considerations or constitutional values. The cancellation was therefore not unfair, and the clause was enforceable. Furthermore, the court in Barkhuizen held that consideration must be given to those special circumstances when a time-bar clause cannot be complied with by the insured.

Early life Severns was born January 21, 1952, in Decatur, Illinois. After graduating high school, she attended Southern Illinois University's Carbondale campus. While in college, at the age of 20, she served as an alternate delegate to the 1972 Democratic National Convention, the then youngest person elected to serve in that role. In 1974, she graduated with a bachelor's degree in political science and international relations. In 1977, Severns served for two years as a special assistant to the administrator of the Agency for International Development. In this capacity she traveled to Nepal, India and Thailand where she audited the United States' mission in those countries and represented the agency during the negotiations of the Camp David Accords. While in Washington, Severns was also resident associate at the Smithsonian Institution. After leaving the State Department Severns took a job with the Decatur-based Archer Daniels Midland. In 1980 she ran for Congress against Edward Rell Madigan, but lost in a year that heavily favored the Republican Party. In her second attempt for public office, she won a seat on the Decatur City Council with the largest number of votes in the city's history at that time. In 1983, Severens became the Democratic Party of Illinois's Central Committeewoman from Illinois's 20th congressional district serving alongside Central Committeeman Vince Demuzio. In 1996, she was succeeded by Ellen Sinclair of Salem, Illinois. Illinois Senate In 1986, she ran for the Illinois Senate against ten-year incumbent James H. Rupp and won in one of the few upset races for the Illinois General Assembly that year. Though Rupp was the earlier favorite, a combination of a media savvy candidate, a well-planned campaign strategy, keeping the focus on chosen issues and targeting of rural areas that Rupp had neglected were credited with the success of her campaign. In the Senate, she held the position of minority caucus whip. She also served as minority spokesperson of the Revenue Committee and on the Executive Committee and Legislative Audit Commission. She rose to become the senior Democrat on the Appropriations Committee and was the first woman to ever be appointed chief budget negotiator. She was viewed as an advocate for working families, breast cancer awareness and who helped in the preservation of the Dana-Thomas House in Springfield. In 1989, Senator Severns was selected from a nationwide group of legislators to participate as a fellow at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government. Her work there earned her a position to study public policy with the National Conference of State Legislatures. In late 1993, Severns announced that she was going to run for the Democratic nomination for Illinois Comptroller, but later switched to running for Lieutenant Governor of Illinois. After the primary election, she was paired with Dawn Clark Netsch, which is the first and only time in Illinois history that two women were the top of the ticket. During the campaign, Severns was diagnosed with breast cancer. Ultimately, Clark Netsch and Severns lost to Jim Edgar and Bob Kustra. Death and legacy After the election, her health continued to deteriorate with the cancer spreading to her lungs and her skull. Despite this, she chose to run for Secretary of State in 1998. However, she was removed from the ballot after one of her opponents, Orland Park Chief of Police Tim McCarthy, challenged her petitions for not having the sufficient number of signatures. This narrowed the race to McCarthy and eventually nominee and current Secretary of State Jesse White. Roughly a week after her removal from the ballot, Severns died of cancer. Former Macon County Board Chairman Kevin Kehoe was appointed her successor, but lost election to a full term later that year to State Representative Duane Noland of Blue Mound. Severns is the namesake of the Illinois Secretary of State's Summer Family Literacy program and the Penny Severns Breast and Cervical Cancer Research Fund. The portion of Interstate 72 between Springfield and Decatur is named in her honor. Her alma mater, Southern Illinois University, established four scholarships in her honor funded through a combination of state and private funding. Three of the scholarships went to students to cover one year of costs while a fourth scholarship was awarded to a Macon County resident. At the time of her death, Severns was in a relationship with journalist Terry Mutchler; however, due to the stigma against same-sex relationships at the time, they kept the relationship secret.Carol Marin, \\"Fear kept Penny Severns‚Äô lesbian relationship with editor hidden\\", Chicago Sun-Times, 29 Aug 2014Dave McKinney, \\"Memoir reveals love between state Sen.

Acanthoxyla inermis is included in the genus Acanthoxyla, and family Phasmatidae. No subspecies are listed. This species is native to New Zealand but has been unintentionally moved to Great Britain where it has grown a stable population and is the longest insect observed, and the most common of the stick insects that have established themselves on the island.Chapman, D. saga.co.uk  Anatomy  A. inermis has a long thin body and three pairs of thin jointed limbs resembling the foliage. The species has been observed as having many superficial differences in appearance among individuals: The body colour and texture is varied and is many shades green, brown or yellow. Adult members of this species can grow to 10 cm long.http://www.nzgeographic.co.nz/archives/issue-83/stick-insects The bodies of this genus are sometimes covered in spines while other specimens have perfectly smooth bodies and others still have a series of tubercles.  Defence Mechanisms  Acanthoxyla inermis, like other stick insects is very well camouflaged for the environment it lives in. The long thin body is very hard to make out from real sticks which provides these insects with a way to hide in plain sight. As well as looking like a small branch in a tree, stick insects also behave like a part of the tree, performing swaying motions to give the appearance of moving in the breeze as the rest of the plant may.  Life Cycle  As members of the family Phasmidea, A. inermis grows by incomplete metamorphosis; it grows by a series of moults. Generally a stick insect will moult between five and ten times between hatching from the egg and mature adulthood. The life of a stick insect consists of four stages: Adults lay their ova (eggs) either by dropping them to the ground or depositing them within a suitable substrate. The ova are often hardy so they can withstand falling from height and the cold winter conditions they are often exposed to. The length of the egg stage can vary from as little as two weeks to over 18 months. After hatching from their eggs, nymphs quickly move to find a suitable vegetation that they can scale in order to find food in the form of leaves and the safety of the environment they are so well camouflaged for. Nymphs go through a series of moults before maturing to an adults which allows them to grow in the absence of their hard exoskeleton and also regenerate limbs that may have lost through a process called autotomy Nymphs will generally eat their shed skin after a moult. Sub-adult stage refers to the final moult before being a true adult of its species. This is a short part of the life cycle and the last before the insect reaches the stage of reproduction The adult stage of a stick insect generally lasts six months to a year, during this period the animal's life is devoted to feeding and reproduction. A. inermis spends most of its life on trees, eating leaves in relative safety. Acanthoxyla inermis seems to reproduce entirely asexually so while she feeds the female drops her eggs without having to move or compete with other members of her species for mates.  Reproduction  From what has been observed, A. inermis reproduces entirely asexually through a process called parthenogenesis. Given that they haven't been seen to reproduce sexually at all they can be called obligately parthenogenic. Some other species of stick insect are facultatively parthenogenic meaning they can reproduce both sexually and asexually. The female of the species which appears to be the only members that are produced is able to spit her egg cells and recombine them to produce clones of herself. Because of the ability to carry on populations like this the male of the species is functionally redundant which has given A. inermis the ability to set up breeding populations from just one female individual. Such a situation occurred when timber was being transport to the United Kingdom in the 1920s and since its arrival A. inermis has become the most common stick insect in Great Britain which has no native species of phasmatodea but several that have invaded in similar ways to the Unarmed Stick Insect. This form of reproduction does make A. inermis (and others) vulnerable to environmental change as they have removed the mixing of their population's genetic code, reducing their genetic diversity, as well as removing the chance for DNA repair. However, the lineage is the result of interspecific hybridisation so individuals have high allelic diversity. The genus Acanthoxyla is the result of hybridisation and the many parthenogenetic lineages within this genus are morphologically different and many are triploid. The process of parthenogenesis means that identification of species cannot rely on the biological species concept. In 2016, a single male specimen of A. inermis was observed in the United Kingdom. Some lineages of Acanthoxyla are triploid but Acanthoxyla inermis is diploid and therefore males can be produced if one X-chromosome is lost during egg production.  Behaviour  Stick insects are known for their behavioural adaptations for blending in with their environments. As well as their convincing appearance, stick insects are known to sway their bodies both when they walk and while stationary which has long been thought to make their camouflage more convincing; swaying like a twig in the wind. It has been suggested more recently that it may also help the animal's vision, helping it distinguish between those branches and leaves that move with it and objects unattached from the substrate it is on.  In Maori culture  There is scattered mention of stick insects in Maori legends. Like all insects they are said to be children of Tane and are to be respected. They have been said to signify several different things: If a stick insect (or mantis) landed on a woman it was said to be a sign she was pregnant. It was said that if a stick insect is present the location was unsuitable for a garden. Other stories stated that if a stick insect landed on someone it was a sign they had entered a sacred place.

In June 1852 a general election was called and a group of 500 electors in the Clerkenwell area presented a petition to Challis requesting that he stand for election to parliament for the constituency of Finsbury. He consented to become a candidate, declaring that if elected he would \\"exercise his own judgement, and, opposing all class legislation, he should make truth the basis of his conduct, and the happiness of the people his object.\\" There were three candidates for the two-seat constituency, and Challis was elected along with his fellow Liberal, Thomas Slingsby Duncombe. He served a single term, standing down at the next general election in 1857. On Michaelmas Day 1852 Challis was elected by the Corporation of London as Lord Mayor of London. He took office on 9 November, although the traditional Lord Mayor's Show was not held as the City was preparing to hold the state funeral of the Duke of Wellington. He died at his country home in Enfield, Middlesex, and was buried at Enfield Chase Cemetery.

It serves as a circuitous routing through northern and eastern Jasper County. Route description Old House SC 462 is a rural two-lane highway that makes a half-circle in Jasper County, broken into five named sections of road. The first section named Gillison Branch Road begins at the intersection of U.S. Route 321 (US 321) in Robertville, goes northeast to US 601 in Pineland, then east connecting with US 278 in Gillisonville. The second section named Morgandollar Road connects Gillisonville with Coosawhatchie. The third section, named Nuna Rock Road is a former overlap with US 17 within Coosawhatchie. The fourth section named Coosaw Scenic Drive connects Coosawhatchie with SC 336 in Old House. The fifth section named Lowcountry Drive continues on from SC 336 to its eastern terminus at SC 170 in Beaufort County. The highway connects to several historic places, including Robertville Baptist Church, Gillisonville Baptist Church and the Old House Plantation. However, it is not scenic as it is predominantly forest or swampland. History The highway was established in 1941 or 1942 as a new primary routing from SC 170 to SC 46 in Bluffton, existing entirely in Beaufort County. In 1956, SC 462 ceded some of its routing to SC 46 (Bluffton Road). In 1958, SC 462 was extended north to Coosawhatchie and then west to SC 128 in Gillisonville replacing SC 170. Between 1962-1964, SC 462 was extended west again over existing secondary roads to its current western terminus at Robertville; this brought the highway's maximum length to . Between 1965-1967, SC 462 east was truncated to US 278 in Old House, its old alignment south to near Bluffton becoming part of US 278.

It is the largest McDonald‚Äôs franchisee in the world in terms of system-wide sales and number of restaurants. As of December 31, 2010, it represented 6.7% of McDonald's franchised restaurants globally. It has more than 94,000 employees, being one of the region's leading employers of young, first-time job holders. It serves more than 4.3 million customers daily and is the largest quick service restaurant (QSR) chain in Latin America and the Caribbean. The company operates its McDonald‚Äôs-branded restaurants as company- operated restaurants and franchised restaurants. Company revenues depend on sales made by company-operated restaurants and rental income from franchised restaurants. The rental income depends on the greater of a flat fee or a percentage of sales. Business areas Arcos Dorados' territory includes Argentina, Aruba, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cura√ßao, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Mexico, Panama, Peru, Puerto Rico, St. Croix, St. Thomas, Trinidad & Tobago, Uruguay and Venezuela. The company dedicated itself as the organizer of the 2014 FIFA World Cup to provide customer service training to more than 15,000 World Cup volunteers. History McDonald‚Äôs has a long history in Latin America and the Caribbean, dating to the opening of its first restaurant in Puerto Rico in 1967. Since then, McDonald‚Äôs expanded its presence across the region, opening its first stores in Costa Rica in 1970, in Brazil in 1979, in Mexico and Venezuela in 1985 and in Argentina in 1986. Arcos Dorados was formed on August 3, 2007, as a result of the acquisition of McDonald‚Äôs Corporation's Latin American business by the region‚Äôs operations managers. Prior to the acquisition, Woods Staton, Arcos Dorados‚Äô Chairman, CEO and controlling shareholder, was the joint venture partner of McDonald‚Äôs in Argentina for more than 20 years and also served as President of McDonald‚Äôs South Latin America division from 2004 until the acquisition. Arcos Dorados announced its initial public offering and became a publicly traded company on April 14, 2011 after listing its shares on the New York Stock Exchange. Operations With nearly $3.8 billion in sales in 2012, Arcos Dorados represents 5.6 percent of McDonald‚Äôs global sales. In Latin America and the Caribbean, it is the largest fast food chain and is more than three times the size of its closest competitor. Compared to the US, Latin America has fewer McDonald‚Äôs per person. There's one McDonald's for every 22,200 citizens in the United States. In Mexico, Costa Rica, and Panama there's one restaurant for every 254,000 citizens; in Brazil there's one for every 310,700 citizens; and in the rest of South America, there's one for every 317,400 citizens. Company-operated and franchised restaurants Arcos Dorados operates its McDonald‚Äôs-branded restaurants under two structures: Company-operated restaurants and franchised restaurants. Arcos Dorados owns, manages and operates approximately 75 percent of its restaurants. Restaurants operated and managed by franchisees account roughly for the remaining 25% of affiliated locations. They receive technical and operational support from Arcos Dorados, including training programs, operations manuals, access to its supply and distribution network and marketing assistance. McCaf√© locations and Dessert Centers Launched in 1999, the McCaf√© concept is meant to attract new customers, particularly during breakfast and after lunch, in separate areas within restaurants where customers can buy lattes, cappuccinos, mochas, hot and iced premium coffees and hot chocolate. As of 2012, there were 334 McCaf√© locations in Latin America. \\"Dessert Centers,\\" operate separately from existing restaurants, offering traditional McDonald‚Äôs desserts like the McFlurry and soft-serve ice cream. As of 2012, there were 1,952 Dessert Centers in Latin America. The first Dessert Center opened in Costa Rica in 1986. Reimaging Arcos Dorados has been updating its McDonald's restaurants throughout the region. Between 2010 and 2012, more than 260 restaurants were fully renovated with larger gathering areas, warmer colors, contemporary furniture, artwork, large windows allowing more natural light and often have outdoor space with tables and umbrellas for outdoor dining. Menu Arcos Dorados‚Äô menus feature the same core items as McDonald‚Äôs throughout the world, including hamburgers, fries, salads and chicken sandwiches, but also includes foods unique to the region. A few examples include a flan-like dessert in Peru, dulce de leche sundaes in Argentina and the McMollette (English muffin with refried beans, cheese and salsa). A typical menu includes three tiers of options: affordable entry-level options, such as the Big Pleasures, Small Prices or \\"Combo del D√≠a\\" (\\"Daily Extra Value Meal\\") offerings; core menu options, such as the Big Mac, Happy Meal and Quarter Pounder; and premium options, such as Big Tasty or Angus premium hamburgers and chicken sandwiches. Nutrition and well- being Faced with increasing scrutiny of the McDonald‚Äôs brand worldwide, Arcos Dorados began implementing changes to its menu in 2007, including introducing side salads as a substitute for French fries, adding fruit in Happy Meals, and entr√©e salads. In 2011, Arcos Dorados launched a new Happy Meal, with reduced sodium, calorie and fat totals. Now all Happy Meal combinations in Latin America contain less than 600 calories ‚Äì less than one- third of the daily calorie intake recommended for children by the World Health Organization. They also include a serving of fresh fruit. Also in 2011, sodium in buns, McNuggets, cheese and ketchup were reduced by an average of 10 percent. Arcos Dorados was the first restaurant chain in Latin America to publish all its calorie content in its restaurant boards in 2013. Nutritional information for McDonald‚Äôs food can be found in all restaurants at posters near the counter, and on paper mats that line the meal trays. Full nutritional information on every food item is available on its websites. In 2011 Arcos Dorados launched a website, \\"Eat and Learn\\" in Brazil. The website includes nutritional guidelines, recipes and advice from doctors and nutritionists. Arcos Dorados also sponsors several educational, sports and well-being programs throughout Latin America and the Caribbean. One event is the McDonald‚Äôs 5K Women Run, (Las Mujeres Corremos) a regional event involving more than 60,000 women in 22 cities and 19 countries in Latin America. Advertising and promotion Through McDonald‚Äôs, Arcos Dorados sponsors several global sporting events such as the Olympic Games and the FIFA World Cup 2014 in Brazil. The company uses similar advertising and in-store campaigns as McDonald‚Äôs. For example, the McDonald‚Äôs Monopoly campaign, which has been a global campaign for many years, is run in several countries in Latin America, including Chile, Argentina and Brazil. McDonald‚Äôs has been targeted by advocacy groups to end advertising and marketing to children. In 2008, Arcos Dorados implemented McDonald‚Äôs Children's Marketing Global Guidelines which stipulate that the company communicate balanced food choices that fit within a child's nutritional needs; use its licensed characters and properties to encourage physical activity and promote balanced food choices for children; instill positive messages about well-being, body, mind and spirit; provide national information to help parents and families make informed choices, and engage third parties to help guide its efforts. Employees Arcos Dorados is one of the largest employers in Latin America with 94,000 employees. For most of its employees, Arcos Dorados is their first employer, with formal pay, benefits and training. Arcos Dorados has a structured training program that helps with personal and professional development. McDonald‚Äôs University trains restaurant managers, mid-managers and owners/operators on best practices in restaurant and people management, sales, marketing and accounting. Additional management training curriculums are available for employees who want to advance within the company. More than 52,000 people from across Latin America have participated in McDonald‚Äôs University courses and educational activities. A 2011 survey of 40,000 firms in Latin America and the Caribbean indicated that half of the companies across the region are struggling to find qualified employees. In April 2012, Arcos Dorados became one of the first companies to join the New Employment Opportunities (NEO) Program. Developed by the Inter-American Development Bank and the International Youth Foundation, the program helps to increase the employability of the region‚Äôs youth. Its goal is to increase job entry among poor and low income young people. Corporate participation in the program involves an initial investment from sponsors of $37 million in cash and in- kind resources. Arcos Dorados is consistently ranked as one of the best places to work in Latin America. The Great Place to Work Institute ranked the company fourth among the top 25 best multinational employers in Latin America in 2012 and sixth in 2013, and it led the \\"S√∫per Empresas\\" (Super Companies) ranking by the Expansi√≥n/CNN magazine. The company has strong relationships with unions in many countries and includes unionized labor among its workers. In Brazil, some unions have challenged the company on part-time or flexible working hours. Charity One of Arcos Dorados‚Äô major charitable causes is the Ronald McDonald House Charities. As of 2012, there were 35 Ronald McDonald House Charities programs in 10 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. This includes 16 Ronald McDonald Houses; 18 Ronald McDonald Family Rooms, and one Ronald McDonald Care Mobile, which was built to deliver pediatric care services to remote locations. McHappy Day, McDonald‚Äôs global fundraiser for RMHC, raises money for various children‚Äôs causes, including the Ronald McDonald House Charities foundation, through proceeds from the sales of Big Macs. In 2012, McHappy Day in Latin America raised nearly $15 million for RMHC. Environmental and social responsibility=Sustainable food sourcing There are many myths and misperceptions about the quality of McDonald‚Äôs products, including ingredients and additives in its beef products. A recent television and online campaign by Arcos Dorados called \\"Beyond our Kitchen\\" or \\"Mas Alla De La Cocina\\" highlights the origin of the ingredients used in McDonald's restaurants and addresses questions about the quality of McDonald‚Äôs food by showing the farms where the beef, chicken, potatoes and vegetables come from and how the food is handled and processed before making its way to a McDonald's restaurant. Globally, McDonald‚Äôs has worked with animal welfare expert, Dr. Temple Grandin, since the mid-1990s to help ensure animals in the supply chain are properly cared for. McDonald's is currently in discussion with its pork suppliers to explore ways to phase out gestation stalls for pigs and is working with producers and suppliers to develop traceability systems to prove that the meat it buys is not from farms that use gestation stalls. McDonald‚Äôs became a member of the Global Roundtable for Sustainable Beef (GRSB) in 2012. The group is working to advance the sustainable production of beef through the commitment of stakeholders in the beef value chain. One hundred percent of Arcos Dorados‚Äô beef and oil suppliers have committed to ending procurement of any goods produced as a consequence of any forest clearance from the Amazon. Supply chain All of Arcos Dorados food and paper suppliers comply with McDonald‚Äôs Supplier Workplace Accountability policy, which stipulates that workers are compensated and treated fairly, work in safe conditions and produce high quality foods and packaging. Arcos Dorados also surveys and audits its suppliers in Latin America and the Caribbean to ensure their operations meet McDonald‚Äôs quality, health and safety standards. based on globally recognized, established industry standards including the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), the British Retail Consortium (BRC) and the Hazard Analysis Critical Control Plan (HACCP). Reducing consumption McDonald's restaurants use a significant amount of energy, specifically in cold storage to protect food safety. During the past several years, Arcos Dorados implemented a restaurant maintenance strategy to reduce water consumption, energy utilization where possible and waste reduction at its restaurants. As one example, the company developed a collection and storage system for the water generated through condensation from the air conditioning equipment. They used the collected water to clean external areas and to water plants, reducing daily water consumption at one restaurant in Brazil from 8,000 liters to 6,800 liters.

Portland, OR: Port of Portland.SEADOG. (2013). \\"Southeast Airports Disaster Operations Group: Airports Helping Airports\\". . The first example in the world was the Southeast Airports Disaster Operations Group (SEADOG), which was founded in 2004-2005 under the leadership of Savannah-Hilton Head International Airport and Orlando International Airport. The initial emphasis of SEADOG was assistance to airports recovering from hurricanes. SEADOG's first mobilization was to Pensacola International Airport after Hurricane Ivan in 2004. SEADOG's most notable mobilizations were to Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport and Gulfport-Biloxi International Airport after Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and to Jack Brooks Regional Airport to assist with urban search and rescue operations after Hurricane Ike hit Galveston and Houston in 2008. More than 20 airports from all over the U.S. contributed assistance through SEADOG after Hurricane Katrina. SEADOG has a dedicated website. In 2007, the Western Airports Disaster Operations Group (WESTDOG) was formed under the leadership of Portland International Airport. WESTDOG's mission was nearly identical to that of SEADOG although WESTDOG's primary focus is earthquakes, but there are minor administrative differences between the two disaster operations groups (DOGs). Unlike SEADOG, joining WESTDOG requires a formal resolution by the airport authority, port authority, city, or county that owns the airport. WESTDOG has a written operations manual and a dedicated website (WESTDOG 2011-2013). The fundamental principles of airport-to-airport mutual aid are that no one can help an airport as well as someone from another airport, no mandatory requirement to send assistance, no self-deployment, matching of specific needs for skilled airport personnel and equipment to volunteered personnel and equipment, and self-sufficiency of the deployed assistance teams. Since the DOGs are mutual aid programs, there are no financial arrangement built into the program. If an airport deploys through SEADOG or WESTDOG in a disaster that is the subject of a Presidential disaster declaration, then reimbursement and liability coverage under the Stafford Act and using the procedures of the Emergency Management Assistance Compact (EMAC) apply.Moseng, R. (2013). \\"Airport to Airport Mutual Aid Programs--Disaster Operations Group Concept\\". Agenda item 8 at Thirteenth Meeting of Directors of Civil Aviation of the Central Caribbean (C/CAR/DCA/13), Havana, Cuba, 28‚Äì31 May 2013. Both SEADOG and WESTDOG depend on coordinating airports that volunteer for that role. SEADOG has four airports that coordinate geographic regions and three specialized coordinators for aircraft rescue and fire fighting (ARFF), law enforcement and security, and rapid engineering assessment. The airports serving in these roles have indefinite terms. WESTDOG has a primary coordinating airport and a secondary coordinating airport that serve one-year terms, with the secondary airport moving up into the primary role after one year. Both DOGs have created permanent communications systems for the dissemination of alerts and the management of volunteered resources and matching of volunteers to need. SEADOG and WESTDOG communicate closely and collaborate. They had their first joint SEADOG-WESTDOG Annual Conference at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport on 16‚Äì18 October 2013.WESTDOG. (2011-2013). \\"WESTDOG\\". There are no DOGs in any other region of the United States (IEM et al. 2012). However, airports outside the southeastern and western states have provided aid through SEADOG. Membership in SEADOG or WESTDOG is open to any airport regardless of location in the United States. There is a third airport-to-airport mutual aid program, the Colorado Aviation Recovery Support Team (CARST). Established by the Colorado Airport Operators Association (CAOA), CARST provides specialized, highly experienced airport and aviation professions to help an airport or community deal with issues involved in recovering from a crash.Colorado Airport Operators Association. (2009). \\"Colorado Airports Recovery Resource Program\\". Presentation to CAOA 2009 Spring Conference. Colorado Springs, CO: CAOA. CARST grew out of experiences with the Avjet crash at Aspen-Pitken County Airport (ASE/KASE) in 2001. In 2012 the Airport Cooperative Research Program (ACRP) of the Transportation Research Board (TRB) of the National Academies published a guidebook for how to establish, manage, and sustain an airport-to-airport mutual aid program. It is ACRP Report 73. There are no airport-to-airport mutual aid programs outside the United States, but the feasibility of an airport-to-airport mutual aid program for Latin America and the Caribbean has begun to be considered by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) of the United Nations (UN), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and several other organizations. Many observers have believed that mutual aid could not operate across national borders because of barriers created by legal, language, and cultural differences and delays created by work rules, customs and duties, and immigration. It has been proposed that inclusion of airlines, national agencies, and international agencies and industry associations such as the International Air Transport Association (IATA), Airports Council International (ACI), and American Association of Airport Executives (AAAE) can overcome such barriers by sharing their day-to-day expertise operating internationally. Formalization of the proposal is expected in 2014. If the DOG for Latin America and the Caribbean is implemented in full or as a pilot project in a subregion such as the Caribbean Basin or Central America, it will probably be the first cross-border airport-to-airport mutual aid program in the world outside the United States.

It was built in 1962 to be used by Burroughs Corporation for its project to build an automated facility to take input, like satellite and radar information, and instantaneously assess its degree of combat importance. The program was designed in conjunction with Air Force 425L System Project engineers and was an important component in North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD)'s command and control system. It was an Ent Air Force Base building until 1975 when the base was inactivated. It then became an off-base installation to the Peterson Air Force Base. Over the next several decades there were varying uses for the building by the federal government. After 2007, the building was vacated and in 2009 it was sold. Ent Air Force Base Burroughs Corporation was awarded a contract to develop a North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) command and control system for its Combat Operations Center. The construction project, to be completed in 1964, included construction at the underground (Cheyenne Mountain Air Force Station) facility and two other phases of the project. The system, designed in conjunction with Air Force 425L Systems Project engineers at Burrough's high speed computer complex in Massachusetts, was to be \\"an automated facility for centralizing the evaluation of critical aerospace surveillance points, providing computations in one-millionth of a second.\\" Its sources of information included radar and satellites. The or two-story Burroughs Building was constructed in 1962 on 1.7 acres for the Burroughs Corporation, as designed by C. Dewey King. The building included offices and laboratories for NORAD's electronics and communications systems. It was owned by Davis-Becker Construction company, who then leased it to Burroughs. In 1970, a Museum of Heritage collection was built for the Fourteenth Aerospace Force in Ent Air Force Base's Burroughs Building. The collection consisted of items from personnel who served with the Flying Tigers or its forerunner the American Volunteer Group in China. The displays‚Äîincluding Chinese coins, patches, flying jackets, and flags‚Äîwere to be completed September 1970. The Army Air Defense Command, part of North American Air Defense Command and Continental Air Command, was inactivated at Ent AFB on January 4, 1975. The Fourteenth Aerospace Force at Ent Air Force Base was inactivated and its personnel and units were reassigned to Air Defense Command on October 1, 1976. Ent Air Force Base was declared excess. In December 1976, personnel were moved to Peterson Air Force Base and the Chidlaw Building, near downtown Colorado Springs. Peterson Air Force Base In 1975, the Ent Air Force Base and the NORAD headquarters moved to the Peterson Air Force Base Ent Building. Until February 28, 1975, Peterson Field was an off-base installation of Ent Air Force Base; the commander of Ent oversaw Peterson Field. On March 1, 1975, Peterson Air Force Base became a primary installation and assumed Aerospace Defense Command functions that had been performed by Ent Air Force Base, which became Ent Annex, an off-base installation of Peterson Air Force Base. In 1975, the data processing building was completed. The Federal Building was an off-base facility of Peterson Air Force Base. In 1993, Kaman Sciences Corporation was awarded a contract to maintain communications mission firmware and software at the Federal Building, Peterson Air Force Base, and Cheyenne Mountain Air Force Base. The Federal Building was included in Peterson Air Force Base's Economic Impact Analysis in 2009. General Services Administration  By 1998, the building was owned by the United States General Services Administration and leased to the Air Force Space Command. Bayshore Industries was awarded a contract by the U.S. General Services Administration to maintain and operate the Federal Building in 2006. The building was fully occupied until October 2006 by the Space Command. The United States Armed Forces occupied approximately 15% of the building until June 2007. United States Northern Command hosted a Coalition Warrior Interoperability Demonstration, an annual event, on June 18, 2007 at the Federal Building. It was a media event to present emerging technologies of command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance solutions (C4ISR) for military and homeland security applications. It was also a venue for Department of Defense, local and federal law enforcement, emergency personnel, and partner systems. The purpose of the event included evaluation of interoperability within the coalition and international community, such as North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) members, Canada, and the United Kingdom. A simulated hostage demonstration was held at the building. The Federal Protective Services and General Services Administration occupied a small portion of the building until their leases expired at the end of September 2007. A bill was introduced in 2007 by Sentator Allard and under consideration to transfer the building to the United States Paralympics, Incorporated, a subsidiary of the United States Olympic Committee. The GSA sold the building, which had been vacant since 2007, in 2009 for $890,000 through its online auction.

In May 1994, he became the first Tamil Muslim to receive the National Award for \\"Outstanding Arabic Scholar\\". He was mentioned as one of The 500 Most Influential Muslims in the 2013/14, 2014/15, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020 lists. Background Shuaib was born in Kilakarai, South India. He comes from a family of Islamic scholars who have taught the Islamic sciences for centuries. His father, Thaika Ahmad Abdul Qadir (d. 1976) was a scholar and spiritual guide. His grandfather, Shahul Hamid (d. 1921) was a scholar and missionary. His granduncle was the ascetic and poet Abdul Qadir (d. 1913), and his great-grandfather was the renewer Sayyid Muhammad (d. 1316), widely known as \\"Imam al-‚ÄòArus\\" or \\"Mappillai Lebbai Alim\\". Amongst Shuaib's predecessors is the founder of the Arusiyyah Seminary, Sadaqatullah al-Qahiri. He is a descendant of the Caliph Abu Bakr, tracing his lineage through Sadaq Maraikkayar, (a companion of Nagore Shahul Hamid), who was a descendant of Muhammad Khilji. Education Shuaib's father took care of his upbringing at the Arusiyyah Seminary, and he was both his teacher and spiritual master. His father gave him several ijazah, or certificates of authority to teach Islamic law. After completing the traditional curriculum, he sat with the scholars of Al-Baqiyat As-Salihat Seminary and Jamalia Arabic College in South India, and Darul Uloom Deoband and Jamia Millia Islamia in North India. He read Arabic and Persian at the University of Ceylon (Peradeniya). His research of the Arwi (Southern India and Sri Lanka) region earned him a M. A. and then a PhD from the Columbia Pacific University. Initiation Shuaib received training from his father in Sufism, until he attained qualification as a murshid and the rank of a spiritual master in the Sufi tradition. He inherited the mantle of the Arusiyya branch of the Qadiriyya tariqa. He further received authorisation from Abdul Karim al- Kasnazani. Career Shuaib started teaching Arabic language and Qur'an studies at the Arusiyyah Seminary whilst still at high school. He entered the teaching profession full-time after graduation. Shuaib is a part of the traditional family business of trading in precious gems and stones. Research Shuaib's primary research focus was history of Islam and Muslims in the Arwi region (modern day South India and Sri Lanka). His findings were the bedrock for his master's thesis and research doctorate which culminated in the publishing of the 880-page work, \\"Arabic, Arwi and Persian in Sarandib and Tamil Nadu ‚Äì A study of the Contributions of Sri Lanka and Tamil Nadu to Arabic, Arwi, Persian and Urdu Languages, Literature and Education\\". The book was released by the presidents of 3 SAARC countries in their respective official residences viz. India, Sri Lanka and Maldives. The book recorded the history and contributions of Arwi (Tamil-speaking) Muslims to Islamic literature, education, propagation and spirituality through Arabic, Arwi, Persian and Urdu. It shed light on their cultural, political and social activities and achievements in their respective countries and abroad. It also featured a critical commentary of the Mawlid composition of Imam al-‚ÄòArus Sayyid Muhammad b. Ahmad Lebbai entitled, \\"Minhat al-Sarandƒ´b fƒ´ Madh al- Habƒ´b\\". Publications Shuaib has authored 4 major works and 7 minor treatises. He has published 11 bilingual articles addressing polemical issues that engulfed the Tamil Muslim community in the 80's and 90's. His arrangement of the Arusi-Qadiri liturgy \\"Ratib Jalaliyya\\" has more than 500,000 copies in circulation while his prayer book \\"Al Munjiyath\\" has had 6 prints of 37,000 copies since 2006.

Biography Abraham Cressy Morrison was born in Wrentham, Massachusetts on December 6, 1864 to Abram B. Morrison. His sister was the writer, Cora Linn Daniels. He traveled extensively with his parents (California, Isthmus of Panama) before they were ‚Äúmet with reverses‚Äù and he had to ‚Äúgive up all educational advantages and devote himself to the serious problem of life‚Äù at age 13. ‚ÄúHe drifted from retail dry goods to machinery and tools, from wholesale dry goods to work in a hotel, from a lawyer‚Äôs office to syrups and molasses, from coals and wood to hard rubber and from there to a proprietary [business] called Maltine.‚ÄùHoward Conrad, ed., \\"History of Milwaukee County: From its First Settlement to the Year 1895,\\" Vol. 2, 356The 'proprietary business' was a name once extended to what is now the over-the- counter drug and nutritional supplement business. In the broadest sense, a 'proprietary business' is one that possesses private ownership of products with exclusive rights to use protected by copyright, patent or trade-mark. ‚ÄúThe proprietary business with the Maltine Manufacturing Company was not satisfactory in some respects, but during the short time he remained in their employ he was called upon to interview, on the subject of their wares, some seven thousand physicians and five thousand druggists.‚Äù This provided him with a foundation into the technique of advertising and landed him a job with the Pabst Brewing Co., where he eventually became in charge of advertising/publicity, at the age of 23. He worked for Pabst Brewery from 1895-97. It appears that Morrison was hired by Pabst principally to market Pabst's 'Malt Tonic' which was sold as the 'Best Tonic.' Morrison was an avid ‚Äòwheelman‚Äô (bicyclist). He was an official in the League of American Wheelmen, serving as president of the Milwaukee Wheelmen, and eventually being named vice president in the national organization. He participated in long distance races and finished ‚Äúwithin the money‚Äù in several 100-mile contests. He worked in Milwaukee and had a cottage in the Village of Whitefish Bay. The Milwaukee to Whitefish Bay ‚Äòrun‚Äô was described by bicycling enthusiasts of the day as perhaps the most popular short run in Wisconsin. An early magazine for bicycle enthusiasts stated, ‚ÄúThe road is always in prime condition and during the summer months good entertainment may be found at the Bay. The famous road begins in the extreme northeastern part of the city and follows a winding course of 5 miles along the lake shore.‚Äù Morrison led local and national campaigns to improve roads and was appointed by the governor of Wisconsin to the ‚ÄòCommittee on Good Roads.‚Äô While in Milwaukee, Morrison had many other interests. He wrote a history of Milwaukee for a publication by the local real estate companies, and a chapter on the brewing industry that was itself included in the History of Milwaukee County. He also wrote some literary works ‚Äì including The Story of Damon and Pythias, and The Man Who Resembled Christ. The first publication was adopted as the ‚Äúauthentic version of the Knights of Pythias and ran through several editions ‚Äì nearly 200,000 copies.‚Äù\\"American Bookmaker: A Journal of Technical Art and Information,\\" August 1890.

They had a family summer residence on Deer Isle, located just southwest of Bar Harbor, Maine, where Morrison spent time entertaining and fishing. He belonged to The Chemists' Club of New York. He died on January 9, 1951 at his home, 464 Clinton Avenue in Brooklyn, New York City.  A. Cressy Morrison Prize (Morrison Astronomy Prize)  While serving as president of the New York Academy of Sciences, Morrison offered the \\"Morrison Astronomy Prize\\" from 1926 until at least 1945. One of the recipients was Hans Bethe for his theory of the carbon cycle in stars (1939). It is reported that Bethe, who on becoming aware of the prize, asked Physical Review to delay publication of his paper so he could compete for the Morrison Astronomy Prize. Bethe famously told the tale that he used the $500 prize to \\"liberate my mother's furniture\\" from Germany. In 1967, Bethe received the Nobel Prize for the carbon cycle. Other notable recipients were John Archibald Wheeler (1945) , Max J. Herzberger (1945), Donald H. Menzel (1926), H. von Zeipel (1930), R. E. Marshak (1940).

By receiving bribes, bribe takers abuse their position of power, which is consistent with how the National Anti- Corruption Unit of the Swedish Prosecution Authority specifies the term. Although bribes and improper rewards are central in the definition of corruption in Sweden, corruption in the sense of \\"abuse of power\\" can also manifest itself in other crimes such as misuse of office, embezzlement, fraud and breach of trust against a principal. Legal definition The provisions on bribery and taking a bribe are found in Chapter 10 of the Swedish Penal Code. Bribe giving is the criminal act of giving, promising or offering or receiving, accepting a promise of or demanding an improper reward, for the performance of duties. Anything of direct or indirect value to the recipient can be considered an improper reward. The provisions on taking a bribe and giving a bribe are applicable both within the public and the private sector. They are also applicable on acts of bribery committed abroad or if the persons involved are foreign, provided that the acts of bribery are subject to the jurisdiction of Swedish courts. Level of corruption The level of corruption in Sweden is very low, according to a 2011 pan-European study by Transparency International. Transparency International's 2017 Corruption Perception Index ranks the country 6th place out of 180 countries. The legal and institutional framework in Sweden are considered effective in fighting against corruption, and the government agencies are characterized by a high degree of transparency, integrity and accountability. However, the OECD Working Group on Bribery has since 2012 repeatedly urged Sweden to reform its laws to ensure the investigation and prosecution of companies that bribe foreign public officials to obtain advantages in international business. This refers to the requirements of the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions. There are municipal cases showing signs of irregular public procurement procedures between public and private actors. According to a case study of the Swedish Competition Authority consisting of judgments where corruption has occurred in connection with public procurement the most common corruption situation is such that an official in a municipal administration or municipal company with close contact with suppliers receives a bribe during an ongoing contractual relation-ship. Of the proportion of convicted corruption convictions, 70 percent concern building and construction. However, the report sees high number of unrecorded procedures as likely. The low levels of corruption are attributed to an efficient public administration, high quality comprehensive services to citizens and enterprises, and a long tradition of openness and transparency of Swedish society and institutions, along with a strong respect for the rule of law, according to an Anti-corruption European Commission report. According to the same report, The Special Eurobarometer on Corruption places Sweden among the countries with the least corruption in the EU. 40% of Swedish respondents believe that corruption is widespread in their country (EU average: 76%) and 12% feel personally affected by corruption in their daily life (EU average: 26%). The number of cases reported, prosecuted and the number of convictions have been stable over time, according to a 2013 study by Br√•. The study found that corruption in Sweden can mostly be described as being simple in nature, in that most cases involve smaller amounts, conference travel, dining and such. Cases=TeliaSonera in Azerbaijan The former Swedish agency Televerket, now a private company TeliaSonera is suspected of involvement in a corruption scandal in Azerbaijan, the Swedish newspaper Svenska Dagbladet reports. Corruption by proxy is the term used in these instances. The Swedish Prison and Probation Service The head of facilities management at The Swedish Prison and Probation Service was sentenced to 3.5 years in prison in what in 2016 was the largest corruption case involving a civil servant in Sweden.

The 31st named storm of the 2013 Pacific typhoon season, Podul developed as a tropical depression on November 11 between Palau and the Philippine island of Mindanao. The system moved west-northwestward and struck Davao Oriental in Mindanao on November 12, bringing heavy rainfall that killed two people and disrupted relief efforts following Haiyan. After crossing the Philippines, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Podul on November 14\\\\. Shortly thereafter, the storm struck southeastern Vietnam, and its circulation dissipated on November 15\\\\. In Vietnam, Podul produced heavy rainfall that resulted in severe flooding. The storm damaged or destroyed 427,258 houses, and overall damage was estimated at 1.5 trillion‚Ç´ (2013 Vietnamese ƒë·ªìng, $72 million 2013 USD). Podul killed 42 people in the country and caused 74 injuries. Meteorological history On November 9, an area of disorganized convection, or thunderstorms, persisted about 1175 km (730 mi) southeast of Palau. The system consisted of a broad circulation, affected to its detriment by moderate wind shear. Moving west-northwestward, the convection persisted and organized into the circulation, indicative of an increased potential for tropical cyclogenesis. Late on November 10, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA), meaning the agency anticipated a tropical depression would develop within 24 hours. Shortly thereafter, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) initiated advisories on Tropical Depression Zoraida after the system entered its area of responsibility of the agency. At 1200 UTC on November 11, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) estimated that a tropical depression formed about halfway between Palau and the Philippine island of Mindanao, although operationally the agency had classified the system two days prior. After passing south of Palau, the system's circulation became more broad and its convection became less organized, despite decreased wind shear. Early on November 12, the depression made landfall on Mindanao in Davao Oriental province. Shortly thereafter, PAGASA discontinued advisories on Zoraida, declaring that the depression degenerated into a low pressure area. By contrast, the JMA continued monitoring the depression as it moved through the Philippines and into the Sulu Sea. On November 13, the center crossed over Palawan island into the South China Sea. At 1200 UTC the next day, the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Podul about 275 km (170 mi) east of the Vietnam coast. Around the same time, the JTWC began issuing warnings on the system as a tropical depression 32W, noting that convection had rapidly increased over the circulation. The agency also mentioned the continued presence of wind shear, although warm water temperatures and moderate outflow were expected to allow intensification. Although the JMA estimated peak 10-minute winds of 65 km/h (40 mph), the JTWC only estimated tropical depression-force 1-minute winds of 45 km/h (30 mph). Late on November 14, Podul made landfall in southeastern Vietnam near Phan Rang‚ÄìTh√°p Ch√†m and quickly weakened into a tropical depression. The JTWC assessed the circulation was dissipating near the coast, and the JMA declared Podul dissipated at 1200 UTC on November 15. Operationally, the agency tracked the system into the Gulf of Thailand, and the Thai Meteorological Department tracked Podul to near the Malay Peninsula on November 16, before ceasing advisories on the storm. The remnants later redeveloped into Cyclonic Storm Helen in the Bay of Bengal, which later struck southeastern India on November 22 before dissipating. Preparations and impact The Philippine Public Storm Warning Signal of Tropical Depression Zoraida (Podul), with its path and direction The Guam National Weather Service warned of the potential of heavy rainfall and high surf for Palau and nearby Yap island. While passing south of Palau, the system produced light winds of about 28 km/h (17 mph). Late on November 10, as the system moved into the Philippine area of responsibility, PAGASA issued the Public Storm Warning Signal Number 1 for seven areas in Mindanao, indicating the potential for winds between . Over the next day these warnings were extended to cover three provinces in Luzon, eight provinces in Visayas and twenty-one provinces in Mindanao. On Cebu Island, officials ordered schools to close during the storm's passage. After the extreme damage due to Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines, the depression that became Podul affected the same areas just days later, which affected rescue work. The depression caused additional difficulties in travel and communications. In addition to causing a landslide in Monkayo, flooding from the depression covered roads and forced about 1,000 families to evacuate. In Davao del Norte, the depression resulted in river flooding that killed two people. In Vietnam, Podul produced heavy rainfall, peaking at in two districts in Qu·∫£ng Ng√£i Province. The rains caused flooding that forced over 78,000 people to flee their homes, including 1,400 the resort town H·ªôi An where floodwaters reached deep. High volumes of flooding caused water to be released from reservoirs, which some local officials credited for the widespread flooding. About of canals and dykes were washed away during the storm. The high rainfall increased water levels along rivers, with the Ba River in Gia Lai Province reaching higher than the record set in 1981. Flooding also damaged over of crops, mostly to rice. Podul damaged or flooded about of roadways and bridges, resulting in traffic jams, and halted three train lines. The storm damaged or destroyed 427,258 houses, and overall damage was estimated at 1.5 trillion‚Ç´ (2013 Vietnamese ƒë·ªìng, $72 million 2013 USD). Throughout Vietnam, Podul killed 42 people and injured 74 others. By November 20, the floods began receding from most locations. Newspapers described the flooding as the worst in Vietnam since 1999. After the storm, the Vietnamese provincial governments assisted in rebuilding houses and roads.

Extent  The government of Cyprus has in theory made some progress in fighting against corruption, and one of them is the amendment to its Criminal Code in 2012 which provides the Criminal Law Convention on Corruption. The strong and independent judicial system is able to ensure the protection of property rights; therefore, foreign investors do not consider corruption a pressing issue for doing business in Cyprus. However, a whistleblower protection law is needed in the country in order to ensure an effective anti-corruption measure. It is also important to note that money-laundering remains a serious problem in the country. In addition, corruption scandals involving politicians from major political parties are not uncommon and when these get uncovered, little to no effort in taken to pursue them.

The Constitution of Sri Lanka defines courts as independent institutions within the traditional framework of checks and balances. They apply Sri Lankan Law which is an amalgam of English common law, Roman-Dutch civil law and Customary Law; and are established under the Judicature Act No 02 of 1978 of the Parliament of Sri Lanka. The judiciary consist of the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeal, the High Court, district court (Sri Lanka)s, magistrate's court (Sri Lanka)s, and primary courts. Although provisions are there for trials for serious offences to be held before a jury, at present all cases are heard before professional judges. Introduction The Supreme Court Complex The current system of courts are defined by the Judicature Act No 02 of 1978. However, the modern form of European form of justice originated during the Dutch colonial occupation of the coastal areas of Sri Lanka in the nineteenth century. Local forms of civil and criminal law as well as system of courts, existed for centuries prior to the European colonization. Courts=Supreme Court The Supreme Court of Sri Lanka is the highest judicial instance and final court of appeal. It is composed of the Chief Justice and not less than six and not more than ten Puisne Justices. Judges are appointed by the President with the nomination of the Parliamentary Council and serve for a lifetime period (65). The Supreme Court is the final appellate Court and has jurisdiction in constitutional. Court of Appeal The Court of Appeal hears all appeals from the High Court and courts of first instance. The court is composed of the President of the Court and not less than six and not more than eleven other Judges. High Court The High Court is the only court in the island which exercises the jurisdiction of the court of first instance and the appellate jurisdiction with both civil and criminal jurisdiction. District courts District Courts are lower courts, headed by a District Judge who is vested with original civil jurisdiction. First instance courtsMagistrate's courts= Magistrate's courts are lower court headed by a Magistrate who is vested with original criminal jurisdiction.Judicial Hierarchy Originally known as police magistrate's courts, current magistrate's courts are established under the Judicature Act, No. 2 of 1978 to each judicial division in Sri Lanka. The minister in charge of the subject of Justice in consultation with the Chief Justice and the President of the Court of Appeal would define the territorial limits of each judicial division. At present there are 72 judicial districts in Sri Lanka.[2] It has jurisdiction of; * criminal cases filed under the penal code and other laws within its jurisdiction. * First mortem examinations. * Post mortem examinations. * Issue of warrants of judicial orders to arrest and produce suspected persons. * Issue of search warrants. * Ordering persons to enter into bonds of good conduct and preventive jurisdiction on public nuisance. Every Magistrate's Court is vested with original criminal jurisdiction (other than in respect of offences upon indictment in the High Court), and is ordinarily empowered to impose sentences up to a fine of Rs. 1,500 and/or 2 years rigorous/simple imprisonment unless power is vested in the Magistrate's Court to impose higher penalties by special provision. Appeals from convictions, sentences or orders of Magistrate's Courts within a Province lie to the High Court of the Province. In judicial divisions which does not have Primary Courts, Magistrate's Courts exercise the jurisdiction of the Primary Courts. ;Appointment and removal of Magistrates All magistrates are appointed by the Judicial Service Commission, which has power of dismissal and disciplinary control of the Magistrates. Additional Magistrates would be appointed to a Magistrate's Court. Magistrates would be seconded to Municipal Magistrate Courts. The Chief Magistrates Court in Colombo is the senior of the Magistrates Courts in the judicial division of Colombo. ;Unofficial magistrates In remote areas where there are only one Magistrate and/or Additional Magistrate, unofficial magistrates (known as Acting Magistrates) would be appointed to site on behalf of the magistrate in his/her absence and postpone hearings to a later date. =Primary courts= The primary courts in are lower courts and are the courts of first instance. The Primary Courts in Sri Lanka is a lower court and are the courts of first instance. There are seven Primary Courts, located in Anamaduwa, Angunukolapelessa, Kandy, Mallakam, Pilessa, Wellawaya and Wennappuwa. In the other divisions, the Magistrate's Courts exercise the jurisdiction of the Primary Courts. The Primary Courts have criminal and civil Jurisdiction =Labor courts= Labour Tribunals are tribunals formed under the Industrial Disputes Act No.62 of 1957, to handle labour disputes and termination of employment.Labour Tribunal - Its creation and creator Other courts and tribunals=Military courts Military courts in Sri Lanka are court martials (the General Court Martial, Field General Court Martial and District Court Martial) convened under the Army Act, the Navy Act or the Air Force Act.Supreme Court holds Court Martial is a ‚Äòcourt‚Äô in terms of Constitution Coroners' courts The Ministry of Justice appoints Inquirers into Sudden Deaths under the Code of Criminal Procedure to carryout an inquest into the death of a sudden, unexpected and suspicious nature. Some large cities such as Colombo and Kandy have a City Coroners' Court attached to the main city hospital, with a Coroner and Additional Coroner. Judges=Appointment The Chief Justice and Justices of the Supreme Court and Court of Appeal are appointed by the President of Sri Lanka with the nomination of the Parliamentary Council. Judges of the High Court are appointed by the President on the advice of the Judicial Service Commission. However the President is not bound to accept the nomination of the Parliamentary Council or follow the advice of the Judicial Service Commission and may decide to appoint any other individual. Traditionally judges are Attorneys at law, while retired judges of the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal does not practice law after retirement. Judicial appointments in the past have been thought to be politically motivated.Judicial Appointment In Turmoil Appointments to the lower courts such as District Courts and First Instance Courts are made by the Judicial Service Commission from the Judicial Service. The Minister of Justice appoints Unofficial magistrates from attorneys with fifteen years or more practice in a magistrate court to serve as the acting magistrate in the absence of the local magistrate. The Minister may appoint lay persons as Justice of the Peace, traditionally empowered to mediate disputes and keep the peace. Today the powers of the position is limited to administer oaths, affirmations and attesting documents. Tenure Judges can serve until the retirement age for the judges fixed at 65 years, as per the Constitution. Dress Supreme Court judges wear scarlet gowns when attending court. On special ceremonial occasions (such as ceremonial sittings of the Supreme Court) they would wear scarlet gown, barrister's bands and mantle and a long wig.

December 9, 933Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 278.Academia Sinica Chinese-Western Calendar Converter.), formally the Prince of Qin (), was a son of Li Siyuan, the second emperor of the Chinese Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms Period state Later Tang. During Li Siyuan's reign, he, as Li Siyuan's oldest surviving biological son, was commonly expected to be Li Siyuan's heir. When his father became deathly ill, however, he, worried that his father's officials might try to divert succession away from him, tried to seize power by force, but was then defeated and killed.  Background  It is not known when Li Congrong was born ‚Äî although it would have been in or before 914, when his younger brother, Li Conghou, born of the same mother, was born.History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 45. It is further unclear what status their mother Lady Xia had vis-a-vis his father Li Siyuan ‚Äî while Lady Cao was traditionally regarded to be his wife on account of her later serving as empress, Lady Xia was not clearly stated as a prior wife, a co-wife, or a concubine, although it was known that she died prior to Li Siyuan's becoming emperor (during the early Tongguang era (923-926) of his predecessor and adoptive brother Li Cunxu) without having been created a title while alive, while Lady Cao was apparently created the Lady of Chu by Li Cunxu.History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 49.New History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 15. What is known is that Li Congrong was Li Siyuan's second son,History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 51. and Li Conghou his third. In their young age, both Li Congrong and Li Conghou had good relationships with Li Siyuan's close associate An Chonghui, who was effectively an older brotherly figure to them. As Li Congrong's older brother Li Congjing (ÊùéÂæûÁíü, n√© Li Congshen ()) was killed by Li Cunxu's general Li Shaorong near the end of Li Cunxu's reign (after Li Siyuan was effectively forced into rebelling against Li Cunxu, and Li Shaorong thus found Li Congjing to be unreliable as an imperial guard), Li Congrong was effectively Li Siyuan's oldest son after that point.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 274.  During Li Siyuan's early reign  In 926, Li Cunxu was killed in a mutiny at the Later Tang capital Luoyang. Li Siyuan subsequently arrived at Luoyang and claimed rightful succession as emperor. Late in the year, he commissioned Li Congrong the military governor (Jiedushi) of Tianxiong Circuit (Â§©ÈõÑ, headquartered in modern Handan, Hebei) and gave Li Congrong the honorary chancellor designation of Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (). His brother Li Conghou was subsequently also given that honorary chancellor designation and made the mayor of Henan Municipality (Ê≤≥Âçó, i.e., the Luoyang region) as well as the command of the imperial guards, and Li Congrong was displeased, apparently believing that effectively leads to Li Conghou's preempting him. (However, Li Siyuan's commission of Li Congrong was part of the military maneuver to take effective control of Tianxiong, as Tianxiong's capital Yedu () had actually continued to be under the control of the same rebels that had forced him into rebelling against Li Cunxu, and, as part of the maneuver, Li Siyuan commissioned the general Fan Yanguang to serve as the military commander of the army at Yedu. Fan was able to attack Yedu and take control, allowing Li Congrong to take command of Tianxiong.)Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 275. Later in 927, there was a time when Li Siyuan told An Chonghui, who was then his chief of staff, that he had commissioned some famed civilian scholars to serve on Li Congrong's staff to try to positively influence him, but that some of Li Congrong's associates had falsely declared that the emperor had decreed that scholars should not approach Li Congrong lest that they render him weak. Li Siyuan wanted to put those associates to death, but An advocated merely stern rebuke. It was not stated in history what came of this incident.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 276. In summer 928, Li Siyuan made a series of transfers of key military governors. As part of that series of transfers, Li Congrong was transferred to Hedong Circuit (Ê≤≥Êù±, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi) to serve as its military governor and the defender of its capital Taiyuan. It was said that Li Congrong was arrogant in his youth and not paying proper attention to governance. Li Siyuan felt compelled to send, among his own associates, a man whom he believed Li Congrong respected (the man's identity is lost to history) to serve on Li Congrong's staff to try to positively influence him. The man informed Li Congrong that Li Conghou had a much better reputation and that he should better himself so that his reputation can at least match Li Conghou's. Li Congrong was displeased by the advice, and informed this to his officer Yang Siquan (). Yang subsequently threatened the man, claiming that man was helping Li Conghou to overtake Li Congrong in succession. The man, in fear, informed the threat to Li Congrong's deputy Feng Yun, whom Li Siyuan had apparently installed to be in actual command. Feng informed Li Siyuan, and Li Siyuan called Yang to his presence in order to disassociate him from Li Congrong, but, on Li Congrong's account, did not punish Yang. When Feng was subsequently recalled to the imperial government to serve as the director of palace affairs, he warned the key officials in charge of government that Li Congrong had a harsh character and was acting frivolously, and needed good counsel. Shortly after, Li Congrong was recalled from Hedong to serve as the mayor of Henan and the commander of the imperial guards, and Li Conghou was made the military governor of Hedong, effectively swapping positions with Li Congrong.  During Li Siyuan's late reign  In 930, Li Siyuan created Li Congrong the Prince of Qin. (Several days later, he created Li Conghou the Prince of Song.) By this point, Lady Cao had been created empress,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 277. and it was after Li Congrong's and Li Conghou's creations as princes that their mother Lady Xia was posthumously honored an empress as well. Li Congrong liked writing poetry, and he gathered a number of poets, headed by Gao Nian (), to serve on his staff. He often spent time with them in writing and reciting poetry, such that, when he gathered his staff member for feasts, he would order them to write poetry. The ones who wrote poems that he did not like would be ejected from his staff. When Li Siyuan heard this, he tried to correct Li Congrong's ways by encouraging him to spend more time studying rather than on poetry. It is not known how Li Congrong reacted to his father's advice. By this point, An Chonghui had been executed by Li Siyuan on suspicion of treason, and Li Congrong was effectively the most powerful individual at court, with Li Siyuan's favorite concubine Consort Wang and the eunuch Meng Hanqiong influential inside the palace. While Fan Yanguang and Zhao Yanshou (whose wife was a sister of Li Congrong's) were serving as chiefs of staff, succeeding An, Li Congrong did not respect them as he did An, such that he often insulted them. He was also suspicious and jealous of Li Conghou's reputation. Another brother-in-law, Shi Jingtang, did not want to be involved in the court scene in this atmosphere, particularly because his wife Princess Yongning was born of Empress Cao and had long had poor relations with Li Congrong, and therefore, in late 932, volunteered to be the military governor of Hedong. Li Siyuan agreed. In spring 933, Li Siyuan gave Li Congrong the title of acting Shangshu Ling () and the chancellor title Shizhong (). (The Shangshu Ling title was an extreme honor, as it was a title that had been once borne by Tang Dynasty's second emperor Emperor Taizong of Tang and thereafter, through the rest of the Tang Dynasty, considered to be one that the emperor's officials should not dare to bear.)See, e.g., Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 269 (Wang Rong's deferring that title to Li Cunxu). In summer 933, someone suggested to Li Siyuan that the imperial princes be appointed teachers. The chancellors, however, feared Li Congrong, and did not dare to commission a teacher for him without his agreement, and therefore suggested to him that he recommend one himself. As his secretary Wang Jumin () recommended the deputy minister Liu Zan () to him, he recommend Liu, a recommendation that Li Siyuan subsequently carried out, despite Liu's own attempt to decline (as he saw it as a demotion). Traditionally, the prince should honor his teacher, but Li Congrong treated Liu as a subordinate, leading to Liu's feeling humiliated. Their relationship subsequently broke down to such a point that Li Congrong refused to meet with Liu, and even did not have meals served to Liu. Later in the year, the retired official He Ze (), who wanted to return to governmental service, believed that flattering Li Congrong would be one way to accomplish that, and therefore offered a petition to Li Siyuan, requesting that Li Congrong be made Crown Prince. This proposal offended the emperor, who believed that designating a crown prince would render he himself obsolete, but felt compelled to have the chancellors discuss it. Li Congrong himself was also displeased, as he incorrectly believed that this was an attempt by Fan and Zhao to strip him of his military command. Fan and Zhao, seeing that neither the emperor nor the prince was happy about the proposal, instead proposed to have Li Congrong given the title of Generalissimo of All Armed Forces (Â§©‰∏ãÂÖµÈ¶¨Â§ßÂÖÉÂ∏•, Tianxia Bingma Da Yuanshuai). Li Siyuan agreed. After his commission as generalissimo, Li Congrong gathered elite troops to serve as his guards, and was always escorted by them wherever he went. He had his staff members author for him a declaration against Later Tang's southeastern neighbor Wu, stating his intent to conquer it. He also continued to have conflict with Fan and Zhao, stating to others that he would slaughter their families if he became emperor. In fear, both of them requested to be relieved as chiefs of staff and given military governorships. Li Siyuan initially refused, in anger, believing that they were abandoning him, but eventually agreed; they were replaced by Zhu Hongzhao and Feng Yun. By winter 933, Li Siyuan had become deathly ill, and when Li Congrong entered to see him, he was no longer able to respond. Once Li Congrong left the palace, he believed that his father had died and was concerned that, due to his conflicts with the officials, the officials would try to divert succession from him. He sent messengers to Zhu and Feng, informing them of his intent to lead his troops into the palace. They both responded that doing so would be treason, to which he reacted angrily by launching troops. When he reached the palace, however, the palace guards fought back, and his own troops eventually collapsed. The imperial guard general Zhu Hongshi () subsequently attacked Li Congrong's mansion, and the officer An Congyi () killed him and his wife, presenting his head to Li Siyuan. His sons were also executed. His staff members ‚Äî despite their generally not involved in his uprising ‚Äî were largely exiled. Subsequently, Li Siyuan summoned Li Conghou, intending to pass the throne to him, but died before Li Conghou arrived. Li Conghou subsequently took the throne.

Taylor, examining the causes of World War II. It was first published in 1961 by Hamish Hamilton. Origins Taylor had previously written The Struggle for Mastery in Europe 1848‚Äì1918. As he later wrote in his autobiography: > I wanted to be writing something and decided that I could carry on my > diplomatic history from the point where the Struggle for Mastery left off. I > had, I thought, done most of the research work needed by reviewing the > various books of memoirs and the volumes of German and British diplomatic > documents as they came out. At that time no original sources were available: > no cabinet minutes or papers, no Chiefs of Staff records, only more or less > formal documents from the Foreign Office with very occasional minutes. This > extraordinary paucity, as it seems now, makes my book a period piece of > limited value.A. J. P. Taylor, A Personal History (London: Hamish Hamilton, > 1983), p. 233. Since 1947, he had read fifteen volumes of British diplomatic documents, eight volumes of German diplomatic documents and one volume of Italian diplomatic documents, all of them covering the 1930s.Burk, p. 281. However, according to Kathleen Burk's biography of Taylor, he did not read Adolf Hitler's Mein Kampf until after writing the book.Burk, pp. 287-289. Taylor supported the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, one of whose arguments was that an unintended war brought about by accident could cause a nuclear war and the end of human civilisation. In Taylor's view, if the Second World War could start by accident, so could a Third. He also was opposed to the idea that it was necessary for the Western powers to take a tough stand against the Soviet Union as failure to take a similar stand against Nazi Germany had led to war.Sisman, p. 288. Content Since the war, the general view of the causes of the Second World War (the \\"Nuremberg Thesis\\") was that Hitler had wanted war, planned in detail for war and had launched the war. He was supported by other Nazis but not by the German people, who were innocent bystanders or victims of the Nazi regime.Burk, p. 283.Sisman, p. 289. Taylor broke with this consensus and the five main themes of his book are: first, that foreign policy is determined by reasons of state and the necessity of reacting to foreign threats, rather than driven by internal politics such as economic or ideological factors; second, that Hitler possessed strategic goals but no thought-out grand scheme as to how and when these goals would be achieved; third, that Hitler's goals were the same as those of other German politicians such as Gustav Stresemann; fourth, that Hitler was an opportunist, taking advantage of events provided by the French and British governments, rather than working according to a timetable; and, fifth, that in destroying the Treaty of Versailles and invading Poland, Hitler had the support of the German people.Burk, p. 283. Reception The book was published in April 1961, with German and American editions appearing the following year.Burk, p. 283. Translations also appeared in French, Italian, Finnish, Dutch, Portuguese, Spanish, Norwegian, Danish, Swedish and Sinhalese.Sisman, p. 300. It was a bestseller around the world and provoked a storm of controversy. Sebastian Haffner wrote in his review in The Observer: \\"This is an almost faultless masterpiece, perfectly proportioned, perfectly controlled. Bitterness has mellowed into quiet sadness and even pity...fairness rules supreme and of all passions only the passion for clarity remains...In spite of all this, it will probably become his most controversial book...Taylor is in the very first rank. He is among English historians to-day what Evelyn Waugh is among English novelists, a rescuer of forgotten truths, a knight of paradox, a prince of story-telling, and a great, perhaps the greatest, master of his craft\\".Burk, p. 284. In the review from the New Statesman, David Marquand praised Taylor as \\"the only English historian now writing who can bend the bow of Gibbon and Macaulay\\".Burk, p. 284. Among his critics were Isaac Deutscher and A.L. Rowse. Martin Gilbert came across a copy of the book in a second hand bookshop some years after it was published. The copy was full of pencilled marginal notes attacking the book's thesis. When Gilbert looked at the flyleaf, it was inscribed \\"A. L. Rowse\\". He presented the copy to Taylor, who was much amused.Sisman, p. 297. Hugh Trevor-Roper reviewed the book in the July 1961 issue of Encounter. Trevor-Roper argued against Taylor's thesis, claiming that Hitler in Mein Kampf in 1924 and elsewhere had outlined his programme. He also accused Taylor of perverting the evidence: > I have said enough to show why I think Mr. Taylor's book utterly erroneous. > In spite of his statements about 'historical discipline,' he selects, > suppresses, and arranges evidence on no principle other than the needs of > his thesis; and that thesis, that Hitler was a traditional statesman, of > limited aims, merely responding to a given situation, rests on no evidence > at all, ignores essential evidence, and is, in my opinion, demonstrably > false. This casuistical defence of Hitler's foreign policy will not only do > harm by supporting neo-Nazi mythology: it will also do harm, perhaps > irreparable harm, to Mr. Taylor's reputation as a serious historian.Burk, p. > 285. On 9 July, Taylor and Trevor-Roper appeared in a televised debate, chaired by Robert Kee, in which the two historians quarrelled.Burk, pp. 285-286. In the September 1961 issue of Encounter, Taylor responded to Trevor-Roper's review. Taylor's article was set out in two columns, one showing the quotations from Taylor's book that Trevor-Roper had included in his review, the other column providing the entire sentence from the book from which Trevor-Roper had acquired his quotations. Taylor intended to demonstrate that Trevor-Roper had selected, suppressed and arranged his evidence in exactly the way he had accused Taylor of doing. The last quotation of Trevor-Roper was his claim that the book would harm Taylor's reputation. Taylor responded: \\"The Regius Professor's methods of quotation might also do harm to his reputation as a serious historian, if he had one\\".Burk, p. 287. The review by the Marxist historian Timothy Mason appeared in the December 1964 issue of Past & Present. Mason pointed to Nazi Germany's \\"demonic urge\\" and criticised Taylor for dismissing German economic patterns, such as the importance of rearmament and the objective of achieving autarky. In Mason's view, all these things required Hitler to launch a war: \\"A war for the plunder of manpower and materials lay square in the dreadful logic of German economic development under National Socialist rule\\". Taylor had ignored the interdependence of internal and external factors in the aims of German foreign policy.Burk, p. 289. Taylor responded in the April 1965 issue of Past and Present: \\"The evidence for economic or political crises within Germany between 1937 and 1939 is very slight, if non-existent. Hitler cut German armaments plans by 30 per cent after Munich. He cut them again drastically after the fall of France and was reducing them even after the invasion of Russia. Indeed large-scale rearmament began only in the summer of 1943\\".Burk, pp. 289-290. Taylor also argued that Mason was wrong in attributing National Socialism to Hitler alone, ignoring the responsibility of the German people, and that National Socialism was the cause of European instability, with Taylor viewing the instability as already present before 1933. Taylor replied to Mason's accusation that Taylor ignored deeper forces at work in the background: \\"I fear I may not have emphasised the profound forces. Of course there was a general climate of feeling in the Europe of the nineteen-thirties which made war likely...Of course historians must explore the profound forces. But I am sometimes tempted to think that they talk so much about these profound forces in order to avoid doing the detailed work. I prefer detail to generalisations: a grave fault no doubt, but at least it helps to redress the balance\\".Burk, p. 290. The press of West Germany had unanimously criticised Taylor's thesis.Burk, p. 291. The historian Elizabeth Wiskemann wrote a letter to The Times Literary Supplement, quoting the many favourable reviews of Taylor's book in neo-Nazi publications.Burk, p. 291. The German historian Golo Mann savaged the book in his review, claiming that Taylor attempted to prove Hitler's innocence and that Taylor was not concerned with historical truth but only in demonstrating the sophistication of his own mind. The German conservative historian Gerhard Ritter was also critical. When Taylor flew to Munich for a televised debate with a Swiss historian, the taxi driver who drove him from the airport asked him whether he knew an Englishman called A.J.P. Taylor. Taylor replied that he was A.J.P. Taylor. The driver stopped mid-traffic, told Taylor he had been part of Hitler's SS bodyguard and put out his hand to congratulate Taylor on proving that Hitler had not caused the war.Sisman, p. 296. The book was published in the United States by Athenaeum Press. At the publisher's suggestion, Taylor wrote a preface to the American edition explaining America's role in the 1930s. The reaction to Taylor's thesis was even more extreme than in Britain.Sisman, pp. 294, 297-298. The review in Time magazine thundered against Taylor: > Taylor finds excuses for Hitler and reasons to blame nearly everybody > else...In Taylor's view it was always somebody else who put poor, passive > Hitler in a mood to fight...With scholarly detachment, Taylor states the > case for appeasing Hitler and for resisting him, but his sympathies > obviously lie with the appeasers...Taylor insists that Hitler was no > fanatic. 'Hitler was a rational, though no doubt a wicked statesmen,' writes > Taylor primly...his nationalism, far from being the common variety, was the > most virulent racism the world has ever known...'A Study of history is of no > practical use in the present or future,' Taylor, who likes to be whimsical, > once said. As far as Taylor himself is concerned, his book proves his > point.Burk, p. 294. Gordon A. Craig in the New York Herald Tribune condemned the book, calling it a \\"perverse and potentially dangerous book. Mr. Taylor has always shown a tendency to strain the truth in order to achieve striking formulations. But he has never before been so intent upon demonstrating his originality as he is here, or so willing to indulge in exaggeration, oversimplification, quibbling, and sheer willfulness in order to achieve his effects\\". Craig ended by saying Taylor \\"also gives aid and comfort to those who would like to rehabilitate the Fuehrer's reputation\\".Burk, p. 294. Two exceptions were American revisionist historians Harry Elmer Barneshttps://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/2136#NIR_1360-005_head_069 and Murray Rothbard,https://mises.org/library/review-origins-second-world-war who both praised Taylor's thesis in the hopes that it would allow future scholars to correct the historical record of the outbreak of hostilities, in a similar manner that occurred after the First World War. In 1963, a second edition appeared with new preface by Taylor entitled 'Second Thoughts'. NotesReferences *Kathleen Burk, Troublemaker: The Life and History of A.J.P.

Although she started out as a fashion editor at Harper's Bazaar, she became a photographer in the 1970s. She is widely credited with adding a darker, more brooding element to fashion photography, beginning in the early 1970s ‚Äì she, Guy Bourdin and Helmut Newton changed it from traditional, well-lit images into something much more \\"edgy\\" looking. However, unlike the \\"urban erotic underworld\\" portrayed by her contemporaries, Turbeville's aesthetic tended towards \\"dreamy and mysterious,\\" a delicate female gaze. She was the only woman and only American among this trio. In 2009, Women's Wear Daily wrote that Turbeville transformed \\"fashion photography into avant-garde art.\\" Her photographs appeared in numerous publications and fashion advertisements, including ads for Bloomingdale's, Bruno Magli, Nike, Ralph Lauren and Macy's. Born in 1932 in Stoneham, Massachusetts, Turbeville died from lung cancer at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan on October 24, 2013, at the age of 81.  Biography = Childhood  According to Turbeville, her work was deeply inspired by her childhood: \\"I am like a child, I must manage it every hour of every day.\\" She was born into a wealthy family in New England that desired to be both distinguished and isolated, but paradoxically suffered from this isolation. Her paternal grandfather had dreamed of being a painter in Paris. Upon his return to the United States, he bought a large house, isolated in the periphery of Boston, which Deborah's mother and aunts inherited. Deborah's father, who was from Texas, also lived in the house. This familial community, which cultivated its members' intellectual superiority through frequent trips to Boston's opera and cinemas, also suffered from this exile in the suburbs: \\"My mother deeply despised mediocrity, and that's what this kind of small city represented for her.\\" Deborah had an older brother called Tom, who lived in New York on Riverside Drive at the same time Deborah was living there. She was \\"timid and shy,\\" according to her mother, Turbeville wrote in the introduction to her book Les Amoureuses du temps pass√©: \\"I grew up in the little world of my parents, my aunts, my grandmother, where they all protected me and I did what I wanted and I never conformed to what the other children were doing, and I never resembled them.\\" Her mother would tell her: \\"Don't ever try to be like others, strive to be yourself, be original.\\" She grew up in a world of adults: \\"In all that my parents did, I accompanied them.\\" One event may illustrate the aspiration of the Turbeville family to distinction: in elementary school one asked a young Deborah Turbeville and her classmates to make a drawing in chalk about Christmas or America. Turbeville recounts that her teacher did not like the content of her drawings (\\"apparently they were very weird\\") and she was dismissed from school for a few weeks. When she remembers this event, Turbeville has said, \\"Sometimes, I still see myself today as that child who made those drawings, and who continues to make things quietly.\\" She was a student at Brimmer and May School in the Bay of Boston, and has always cited as her first sources of inspiration the narrow cobble streets, Louisburg Square, snow and tinted windows. \\"Deborah liked the climate, the fog, the snow storms, the wind, and the raging oceans.\\" In addition to her family home on the outskirts of Boston, Turbeville also spent her summers in their vacation home in Ogunquit in Maine, a place she described as \\"very sorry, very sinister, very beautiful.\\" It seems that these abandoned and windswept places have inspired much of her work, since one often finds empty beaches and forgotten resorts in her photographs.  Style = Technique  Turbeville's photographs are recognizable by their grain, by their colors of pastel, sepia, or black and white, and by the image blurring. She sometimes reworks her shots by scraping or taping them with the help of her assistant and collaborator, Sharon Schuster. According to Pete Silverton, these photographs are \\"consciously damaged goods.\\" Furthermore, according to Turbeville, \\"I destroy the image after having created it (...) Erasing a bit in such a manner that it is never completely there...\\" Or: \\"The idea of disintegration is really at the heart of my work.\\" This work of alteration is one of the elements that make Turbeville an artist, as she provokes a reflection on the medium, and the medium is in itself significant. Her images, \\"scraped, twisted, erased, damaged artificially to give the impression of old clich√©s, contradict the technical perfection that even an amateur photographer can get these days. Turbeville exposes the lie that with technique and determination an artist who seeks to create imaginative content resonates ambiguities.\\" \\"Yes, the images' apparent stillness hides an undercurrent of violence (...) This violence is reinforced by the artist in her work: she violates her own images.\\"  Subjects = Femininity  Refusal of conventions = During the 1970s, fashion photography moved more towards sexual provocation and tended to become, according to Nancy Hall-Duncan, \\"a subdivision of the culture of pornography.\\" Turbeville took its misty atmospheres and combined them with models that communicated neither between one another nor with the viewer. Nancy Hall-Duncan notes that these women seemed \\"locked in their solitude,\\" an impression reinforced \\"by lazy, soft poses.\\" And, she added: \\"In the broadest sense, Turbeville's photographs reflected the psychologiccts, but people with whom Turbeville recognized her failure to communicate perfectly. She was even scared of them, as she could not have the smallest preconceived idea of them. \\"I am often scared, of people. This is found in the photos I take: almost the feeling of humiliation or embarrassment. The young women lower their eyes, or look elsewhere, they cannot look the lens in the face. And I, I cannot force them to look directly in the lens, or make a face like everything is great and it's truly cool!\\" Indeed, in the collective book Women on Women, about women photographing other women, she wrote that in her photos, \\"there is the gnawing feeling that something is wrong. My work is not complete if it does not contain some vestige of this frustration in the final prints.\\" Thus, in her work in fashion photography, she tried to avoid a \\"stereotypical ideal\\" and glamour: \\"It wasn't the perfectly beautiful girl who made me want to take photos, but the girl with an intrigue in her face, with a profoundness below the surface.\\" Accordingly, the models themselves take precedence over the \\"innocuous, -hued separates of the seventies and eighties,\\" despite their averted gazes. In popular culture In February 2014, Erika Cavallini‚Äôs fall collection was photographed at an event using rising photographers from \\"#recruited\\" on Instagram and from Vogue Italia. The event was \\"a tribute to Deborah Turbeville, who died\\" October 2013 \\"at the age of 81.\\" References Category:1932 births Category:2013 deaths Category:Fashion photographers Category:People from Manhattan Category:Fashion editors Category:American photographers Category:American women photographers Category:Women magazine editors ","title":"Deborah Turbeville"},{"id":"41108978","text":"David Simon Blondheim (25 August 1884 in Baltimore ‚Äì 19 March 1934 in Baltimore)Guide to the David Simon Blondheim papers, 1924‚Äì1981, Special Collections Research Center, The George Washington University was a professor of Romance philology at the Johns Hopkins University and a scholar of medieval Jewish texts in Romance languages.

He served as the first elected tribal chairman from 1962 to 1985, and before that was head of the General Council from 1957 and a chief. His activism led to political organization of the Miccosukee and their gaining federal recognition in 1962 as an independent Native American tribe. They wrote a constitution to govern their people. In 1959 Buffalo Tiger led a delegation to Cuba and secured formal diplomatic recognition from the government of Fidel Castro of the Miccosukee.Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida: History, Official Website In 1962 the US Government recognized the tribe. Under his leadership, the tribe in 1971 was the first to take over responsibility to operate its social and educational programs, as was later encouraged by the Indian Self- Determination Act of 1975. Buffalo Tiger and the tribe have used their sovereignty to preserve their culture and traditions in their homeland. With historian Harry A. Kersey, he wrote an autobiography, Buffalo Tiger: A Life in the Everglades (2008). From the late 1980s he ran an airboat tour company in the Florida Everglades.Buffalo Tiger's Everglades Airboat Tours Website Early life and education William Buffalo Tiger was born Heenehatche in 1920 to Tiger Tiger and his wife in a traditional Miccosukee village in the Florida Everglades. They lived in a \\"chickee,\\" a house built raised from ground level. As a member of the Miccosukee his first language was Mikasuki, one of the Muskogee languages. He grew up immersed in the traditional customs of the people. In the early 20th century, the Miccosukee were considered part of the Seminole, and the people maintained their relative isolation from the majority community by living within the Everglades. When the Tamiami Trail was built through the Everglades in the 1920s and 1930s, it cut through Seminole and Miccosukee land. The road brought tourism to the region, which provided some jobs and a market for Miccosukee crafts, but also encroached on their culture. Many of the Seminole lived closer to European-American settlements and adapted more to the majority culture. In the 1940s, the Seminole began to move into designated Indian reservations, but the Miccosukee stayed outside.Mahon, John K.; Brent R. Weisman (1996). \\"Florida's Seminole and Miccosukee Peoples\\". In Gannon, Michael (Ed.). The New History of Florida, pp. 183‚Äì206. University Press of Florida. Chief of Miccosukee In the 1950s, the Seminole were faced with new challenges; in 1953 the federal government proposed to terminate them as a tribe, which meant a reduction in certain benefits and, more tragically, neglect from the United States to honor their sovereignty. The majority of Seminole in Florida organized to gather their political power, and in 1957 were federally recognized as the Seminole Tribe of Florida. The process of gaining such recognition had pointed up cultural differences between the groups.Mahon, pp. 202‚Äì204 Another dividing issue was making claims in the 1950s for land taken by the federal government in the 19th century; the Seminole of Oklahoma and Florida wanted to gain compensation for lands lost, but the Miccosukee and Traditionals did not want to give up their claim to have the land returned.Mahon (1996), \\"Florida Seminoles and Miccosukee\\", pp. 203‚Äì204 At this time, the Seminole and Miccosukee formally separated. Led by Buffalo Tiger, the Miccosukee gained state recognition separately in 1957, and federal recognition in 1962. The Traditionals or Independents did not affiliate with either tribe.Mahon (1996), \\"Florida Seminoles and Miccosukee\\", pp. 202‚Äì204. The Miccosukee preserved their more traditional ways and kept some distance from the majority culture. As a young man working as a housepainter, Buffalo Tiger had learned English. He began to represent his tribe in dealings with the European Americans. The modern world encroached on the Miccosukee and the Everglades, areas of which were developed, and he became an energetic and outspoken leader of the community. Buffalo Tiger was chief of the Miccosukee in 1957; he was elected as the first tribal chairman after its adoption of a constitution, and served as chairman for decades. To create publicity about the tribe's effort to gain federal recognition, in 1959 Buffalo Tiger requested recognition of the Miccosukee from several nations; only Cuba responded. He, Homer Osceola of the tribal council, and Morton Silver traveled to Cuba in 1959 and met with premier Fidel Castro of the new revolutionary government. He worked with state and federal officials to implement reforms and to protect the community‚Äôs cultural and natural resources. Under Chief Buffalo Tiger's leadership, in May 1971 the Miccosukee signed a contract with the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs to take over operation of the \\"comprehensive social and educational programs formerly run by agency bureaucrats. He had worked closely with the tribe's attorney, S. Bobo Dean, who represented it in negotiations in Washington, DC. The Miccosukee were the first tribe to take such control, taking advantage of President Richard M. Nixon's 1970 initiative of Indian self-determination prior to passage of legislation in 1975 to support this. Their several parcels of lands are known collectively as the Miccosukee Indian Reservation. Under a separate lease arrangement with the state water conservation district achieved in 1983, they have access and fishing and hunting rights in 200,000 acres of wetlands.Ewen, Alexander and Jeffrey Wollock. \\"Tiger, William Buffalo\\", Encyclopedia of the American Indian in the Twentieth Century, New York: Facts On File, Inc., 2014. ItemID=WE43&iPin;=ENAIT516&SingleRecord;=True American Indian History Online. (accessed August 14, 2014) Chief Buffalo Tiger served on the Florida Governor's Council on Indian Affairs, established in 1974 as an advisory body to the state's chief executive. He and the chief of the Seminole served as co-chairs of the group, two-thirds of whose members were appointed by the two federally recognized tribes in the state.Tiger and Kersey (2008), Buffalo Tiger, Harry A. Kersey, Jr. Appendix, p. 159 Buffalo Tiger helped bring modernity to his people, including control of their programs, economic development, and improvements to medicine and education. At the same time, Buffalo Tiger supported efforts to preserve the culture; the Miccosukee Indian Village Museum was founded in 1983. He was opposed by some traditionalists because of failure to gain more land under tribal control and finally voted out of office in 1985. Later years Since the late 1980s, Buffalo Tiger developed a business to take tourists on airboats through the Everglades. He used these occasions to educate people about the total ecology of the area and build support for its preservation, such as a planned airport. He opposed the construction of I-75 through the Everglades, a major freeway which was completed in 1993. He had developed a tourist business, Buffalo Tiger's Airboat Tour, for the Everglades. Family members took over operation of the business in the 21st century. Personal life Buffalo Tiger was married three times, each time to a non-Miccosukee woman. He lived in Miami. Among his five children are two sons from his first marriage, both of whom are active as Miccosukee.Tiger/Kersey (2008), Buffalo Tiger, p. 139 One has worked as an engineer with General Motors in Detroit, and Steven Tiger has led a rock group, Tiger Tiger, which has released several CDs.

Elena and Amara are already in town, they only need Caroline (Candice Accola) to bring Katherine back to town as well. Katherine, who got bad news from Maxfield (Rick Cosnett) that she is just aging and there is no way to stop it, agrees to come back with Caroline. Katherine makes a deal with Qetsiyah that after the anchor spell Qetsiyah will help her to find a cure to stop the aging, otherwise she will not give her her blood that is required for the spell. During the spell, Silas intervenes and tries to stop it. The power goes out and in the chaos, Stefan ‚Äì who just wants revenge against Silas after what he has done to him ‚Äì kidnaps Amara while Silas and Qetsiyah start fighting. Silas impales her with a fireplace poker when Stefan calls him to say that he has Amara and if he does not find them in ten minutes, he will take her away and keep her alive forever. Silas leaves to find Stefan and Amara. Silas finds Amara tied on a tree and while he tries to untie her, she begs him to kill her. Stefan appears and they start fighting, with Stefan finally stabbing him. Silas dies and Amara stabs herself. In the meantime, Elena finds Qetsiyah and makes her finish the spell so that Bonnie becomes the anchor. She manages to finish the spell just in time before Amara dies. Bonnie becomes the new anchor and Silas is trapped on the Other Side. Now that everything is done, Katherine finds Qetsiyah to ask for her cure only to find that Qetsiyah changed her mind and all she wants now is to die and meet her true love on the Other Side. She kills herself without finding a cure for Katherine. Katherine is once again alone since now that Bonnie is back, Caroline asks her to move out of their dorm. Nadia (Olga Fonda) appears to ask her to go back with her to Prague, but Katherine turns her down. Caroline is shocked by the fact that Nadia is Katherine's daughter. Qetsiyah needs to pass to the Other Side, but before she does, she informs Bonnie that from now on, whenever a supernatural creature dies, they will pass through her since she is the anchor and she will feel every death. Before she passes through her, she warns her that it hurts. Qetsiyah passes through Bonnie and Bonnie screams in pain. The episode ends with Stefan burying Silas. Stefan thought that by killing Silas it would make the pain go away but the memories are still there haunting him and he collapses in pain.

Reviews Carrie Raisler from The A.V. Club gave a B+ rate to the episode saying that it was \\"a fairly entertaining\\" one. \\"The highlight [of the episode] is the inevitable scene where all three doppelgangers finally meet face-to-face for the first time, to help Qetsiyah gather enough power to perform the anchor switching spell. Despite some very overly busy direction, the sight of three Nina Dobrevs in one scene together is delightful enough to overcome this distraction.\\" Stephanie Hall of KSiteTV gave a good review to the episode saying that the show continued \\"the pattern of solid episodes this season. [...] Though not the most intense episode, it was a generally enthralling and contained more enjoying quips than usual.\\" Hall gave a positive feedback to Sonnenshine, the writer of the episode: \\"Lightening up all of the drama and deaths of this episode were great and humorous lines of dialogue. Writer Rebecca Sonnenshine included a perfect amount of sass, most notably with Tessa, to break the intensity.\\" Matt Richenthal of TV Fanatic graded the episode with a 3.1/5. All three main actors of the show, Dobrev, Wesley and Somerhalder, received positive comments from the reviewers. Dobrev about how well she managed to portray three different characters, Wesley for his portrayal of Silas and Stefan and Somerhalder about the scene where his character, Damon, tries to keep Amara alive.

It is one of the only two surviving gates along with the Porta Marzia to the south. Castex, pp. 1‚Äì2 It was constructed in the second half of the 3rd century BC and was restored by Augustus in 40 BC after his victory in the Perusine War. Representing the best surviving and most monumental of the Etruscan city gates it opens on to the cardo maximus of the city, corresponding to the modern Ulisse Rocchi Road. The arch is part of a massive set of walls which are tall and long made of travertine and set without mortar. It covers approximately a quarter of a square mile over three hills. The arch consists of an attractive facade with a single archway and two trapezoidal towers. The archway forms a semicircular barrell vault passageway over 30 feet high. Two rows of voussoirs form the shape of the arch and are held in place by a keystone at the top. Above the arch (in two concentric rows) there is an ornate Doric-inspired frieze of metopes with round shields and triglyphs in six vertical bands. Above this is another smaller voussoir arch between two pilasters making the height of the Etruscan Arch more than 60 feet. On the internal face it is possible to read the inscription Augusta Perusia, which was the name of the city after the reconstruction of 40 BC; on the external face the inscription Colonia Vibia is inscribed, testimony to the ius coloniae received from Emperor Trebonianus Gallus (251‚Äì253). The loggia on the left tower is an addition from the 16th century, while the fountain at the bottom of the same tower was completed in 1621.

The school building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1993. History In 1886, the Washington Territory Legislature established the State School for Defective Youth in Vancouver, Washington. The act established a \\"school for the deaf, mute, blind, and feeble minded\\". Louis Sohns and Charles Brown raised money from local civic leaders, purchased property, and built buildings for the school. They were also added as trustees for the school. In 1891, School Director James Watson recommended that the \\"feeble minded\\" be separated from the blind and deaf students. They were relocated to another facility nearby. In 1906, the \\"feeble minded\\" were relocated to a state school at Medical Lake in Eastern Washington (now called Lakeland Village). The Vancouver school's name was changed to the State School for the Deaf and Blind, with the blind students moved to the former facility for the \\"feeble minded\\". In 1913, the two schools were officially separated by name, the State School for the Blind, and the State School for the Deaf. Notable alumni Jazz singer and pianist Diane Schuur, blind since birth from retinopathy of prematurity, attended the Washington State School for the Blind from ages four to seven, in the late 1950s to early 1960s. She lived in Vancouver at the school but was able to commute home by train to suburban Seattle on her own. In her twenties, her talent was recognized by jazz musicians Dizzie Gillespie and Stan Getz. She has made over 20 albums including the Grammy-winning Diane Schuur & the Count Basie Orchestra. She has performed at Carnegie Hall, The White House and the Kennedy Center. Schuur was awarded the Helen Keller Achievement Award in 2000 by the American Foundation for the Blind. Later history In 2008, the school hosted a \\"tactile museum of natural history\\" experience and fundraiser called Sensory Safari. The event benefitted the Washington School for the Blind Foundation, which supports student activities and funds technology and equipment for the school.

Demographics According to the 2011 Croatian census, there are 2,218,554 women in Croatia out of a total population of 4,284,889. The sex ratio of the population is 1.06 males per 1 female at birth and up to 14 years of age, and 0.99 males per 1 female between the ages of 15 and 64. But at ages over 64 the ratio is 0.64 males per 1 female. The ratio for the total population is 0.93 males per 1 female. Life expectancy for women in Croatia is 80.1 years (2012). In 2009, there were 44,577 live births in Croatia, comprising 22,877 male and 21,700 female children. Virtually all of those were performed in medical facilities; only 34 births occurred elsewhere. Out of the total number, 38,809 children were born in wedlock or within 300 days after the end of the marriage, and the average age of mothers at the birth of their first child was 27 years and 5 months. General fertility rate, i.e. number of births per 1,000 women aged 15‚Äì49 is 42.9, with the age specific rate peaking at 101.0 per million for women aged 25‚Äì29.

In 2013, the principal cause of death for women in Croatia were diseased of circulatory system at 54.3%, followed by tumors at 23.6%. Other significant causes of death are injuries, poisonings and other external causes (4.3%), respiratory system diseases (3.5%), digestive system diseases (3.3%), and endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases (2.8%). Notable Croatian women The History of Croatia records several notable Croatian women. Jelena Nelipƒçiƒá was the Queen of Bosnia. Beatrica Frankopan was noblewoman, and by marriage an heiress of Hunyad Castle. Ana Katarina Zrinska, also from Frankopan family, was a noblewoman, remembered as a patron of the arts, writer and patriot. Her daughter, Jelena Zrinski, is considered a national heroine. Another notable woman in Croatian political history was Savka Dabƒçeviƒá-Kuƒçar, who became one of the most influential Croatian female politicians during the communist period, and became the 5th Prime Minister of Croatia, and the 1st female Prime Minister of Croatia. In art, Ivana Brliƒá- Ma≈æuraniƒá is remembered as the best Croatian writer for children.

It was the family home of the British prime minister Harold Macmillan, Earl of Stockton, who died there in 1986. During Macmillan's time, Charles De Gaulle, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Nikita Khrushchev, Jawaharlal Nehru and John F. Kennedy stayed as guests at Birch Grove. The house is now owned by the Scottish entrepreneur James Hay. Birch Grove is a Grade II listed building. History Maurice Macmillan and his wife Helen (known as Nellie) bought the estate, a large house and just over 100 acres of land, in May 1906 for ¬£13,000. The house was almost completely rebuilt in 1926 at Nellie's insistence. At the same time, Nellie persuaded Maurice to disinherit Harold's two elder brothers and leave the house and estate to Harold, with a life interest for her. Nellie's devotion to, and support for, Harold was an important factor in his subsequent career - Nellie once admonished Harold's children when they were running through Birch Grove; \\"Don't kick that door. This house is going to belong to the Prime Minister of England one of these days\\". Macmillan's diary entry for 7 August 1951 records his return to the house after an absence of over a decade. \\"The furniture is unpacked and the vast confusion of twelve years (we left it to [a] Nursery School in 1939 and to a preparatory school in 1945) is being sorted out. On the whole the damage is less than I expected...\\". On his appointment as Secretary of State for Defence in late 1954, Churchill offered Macmillan the use of Dorneywood. Macmillan declined, and subsequently made little use of Chevening in his time as Foreign Secretary, or Chequers as prime minister. He preferred his own home and \\"Lady Dorothy doesn't like weeding other people's gardens\\". Memorial plaque to Harold and Dorothy Macmillan in the Church of St Giles, Horstead Keynes Macmillan's diary entry for 25 November 1961 records De Gaulle's visit. \\"The house is looking lovely. [De Gaulle's] blood plasma is in a special refrigerator in the coach house. Police (without and without dogs) are in the garden and in the woods (one alsatian happily bit the Daily Mail man in the behind). Altogether a most enjoyable show\\". It was the venue for Macmillan's historic meeting with U.S. President John F. Kennedy in June 1963. Other prominent political visitors to the house during Macmillan's premiership included Dwight D. Eisenhower, Nikita Khrushchev and Jawaharlal Nehru. Macmillan's diary entry for 30 March 1966 records the eve of the election: \\"Both Heath and Wilson made good final broadcasts - at least, so people say. I have not looked at any T.V. Happily we have not got the instrument at B.G (except in the Servants' Hall).\\" Family relations at Birch Grove remained somewhat strained after Macmillan's retirement from the premiership in 1963. Macmillan's relationship with his only son Maurice was cool, and Dorothy's with Maurice's wife Katie was no warmer. Dorothy would demand that visitors to the house lock and bolt all of the doors and windows, \\"otherwise Katie will come for the furniture!\\" On 22 May 1966, Dorothy died at the house, after suffering a fatal heart attack in the hall. Twenty years later, on 29 December 1986, Macmillan died at Birch Grove at the age of 92. Both he and Dorothy are buried in the Macmillan family plot in their local church, St Giles, Horstead Keynes, where a plaque erected by their surviving children records their regular worship. In 1989, Birch Grove was sold by Macmillan's grandson, Alexander Macmillan, 2nd Earl of Stockton, who had also inherited the Earldom on his grandfather's death. In 2011 the house was bought for ¬£25 million by the entrepreneur Jim Hay, having previously been owned by the Chinese businessman Larry Yung. Architecture and description Birch Grove stands on the edge of the Ashdown Forest near Chelwood Gate in East Sussex, although the house itself is in West Sussex. It is a Grade II listed building though the Historic England listing record makes clear that this is for its historical associations rather than any intrinsic architectural merit. Pevsner is no more admiring of the house, describing it as \\" an unhappy union between Queen Anne and a mansard [roof] that weighs the house down\\". Macmillan's official biographer, Alistair Horne notes that Nellie's rebuilding of Birch Grove was \\"one of only two or three such major works of residential construction undertaken during the depression\\". The house is built to a square plan, with four ranges each of nine bays around a central courtyard. Pevsner suggests that some of the interior fittings may have come from Devonshire House in London, which had been sold by Dorothy's father in 1920 and demolished shortly thereafter. Simon Ball, in his study of Macmillan and three of his contemporaries, The Guardsmen, describes Birch Grove as \\"substantial if inelegant\\".

Location  The Thuringian Holzland lies within a triangle formed by the towns of Hermsdorf, Eisenberg and Stadtroda and between the rivers Saale, White Elster and Orlasenke. Originally it comprised the following 8 villages: Bad Klosterlausnitz, Hermsdorf, Oberndorf, Reichenbach, Schleifreisen, Sankt Gangloff, Tautenhain and Wei√üenborn.  Description and history  The reason for the extensive forests of this landscape is its rather infertile soils, which have been formed from the sandstones of the Bunter formation that make up the area. As a result, the Holzland is of limited use for agriculture. The rich timber industry of the area meant that once typical occupations, such as ladder maker (Leitermacher), blacksmith (Peckschmied), tubmaker (Muldenhauer), etc., were very common here. Which is why the area is also often referred to not infrequently as Leiterland (\\"ladder land\\"). In the late 19th century, the china industry (the industry was based in Hermsdorf - household porcelain was especially centred on Reichenbach. After 1989 there were a large number of spin-offs from the Hermsdorf ceramic works (KWH) (from 1990 Tridelta AG) and several start-ups of companies in the pottery, micro-electronics, micromachinery, powder metallurgy and service industries, etc. For many years the Thuringian Holzland has also been used as the recreational area of the East Thuringian region and beyond. In warm weather, tourists walk in small and large groups by the Zeitzgrund or the Eisenberg Mill Valley. The mills were mostly converted into restaurants and footpaths have largely been improved. The railway line between Weimar, Jena and Gera (via Stadtroda, Hermsdorf and Klosterlausnitz ) is called the Holzland Railway.

Starting at US 321 in Tillman, it goes east into downtown Ridgeland, then continuing east to SC 462 in Old House where it ends. Its routing east of Interstate 95 (I-95) takes a series of turns, making the highway's routing a bit disjointing. Travelers wishing to bypass Ridgeland can continue straight on Smiths Crossing (S-27-29), saving a and a few minutes, though large trucks are restricted from using that route. The highway connects to several historic places, including Jasper County Courthouse, Church of the Holy Trinity, Honey Hill-Boyd's Neck Battlefield, White Hall Plantation House Ruins and the Old House Plantation. History The highway was established in 1938 as a new primary routing from SC 33 (today's US 321) in Tillman, to US 17/SC 36 (today's US 17/US 278) in Ridgeland. In 1997, it replaced US 278 from Ridgeland to SC 462 in Old House. Junction listRidgeland connector route South Carolina Highway 336 Connector (SC 336 Conn.) is a connector route that is in the western part of Ridgeland and in the northwestern part of Jasper County. It is known as Russell Street and is an unsigned highway. The connector begins at an intersection with the SC 336 mainline (West Main Street). It travels to the north-northeast through a residential area of the city. At 3rd Avenue, it begins a brief concurrency with U.S. Route 278 Connector (US 278 Conn.). One block later, they intersect US 278 (known as Grays Highway west of here and Third Avenue east of here). Here, both US 278 Conn. and SC 336 Conn. end, and the roadway continues as Town Square.

At the age of eighty-four, she wrote an account covering the first part of her life. Family Rose Lok, born in London on 26 December 1526, was one of the nineteen children of Sir William Lok (1480‚Äì1550), gentleman usher to Henry VIII and mercer (cloth merchant), sheriff and alderman of London. Rose and five of her brothers and six of her sisters survived to adulthood, all children of her father's first two marriages. According to Sutton, Rose Lok's mother was Alice Spenser, the first of Sir William Lok's four wives, who was an early convert to Protestantism. However according to McDermott, Alice Spenser died in 1522, and Rose Lok's mother was Sir William Lok's second wife, Katherine Cooke (d.1537), daughter of Sir Thomas Cooke of Wiltshire. One of her brothers was the merchant and backer of the Frobisher expeditions, Michael Lok. Another was Henry Lok, father of the poet Henry Lok. Among her sisters were Elizabeth Lok (1535‚Äìc.1581), who married firstly a London mercer, Richard Hill, and secondly Nicholas Bullingham, Bishop of Lincoln; and Jane Lok. Her father, Sir William Lok, was the great-great-great-grandfather of the philosopher John Locke (1632‚Äì1704). Career In 1536 Rose Lok's family lived in Cheapside in London 'at the sign of the Padlock'.Sutton states that the establishment was known as The Lock. Her father was Sheriff in 1548, and was knighted in that year by the young Edward VI. Sir William Lok and his wife were Protestants, and supported Henry VIII's divorce from Catherine of Aragon. Sir William Lok was the King's mercer, and the King once dined at Lok's London home. According to Sutton, all Sir William Lok's sons were mercers, and it is likely that all his daughters, including Rose, were silkwomen. In 1610, when she was eighty-four years of age, Rose Lok wrote an account of the first part of her life. In it she told of her parents' activities in furtherance of their Protestant beliefs, including her father's pulling down in 1534 of a copy of the Papal bull excommunicating Henry VIII which had been posted in Dunkirk, of his bringing French translations of the Gospels and Epistles from the continent for Henry VIII's second wife, Anne Boleyn, and of her mother's having read aloud evangelical tracts to Rose and her sisters in secret when they were children. Rose's mother later died in childbirth. In 1543 Rose married Anthony Hickman, a mercer and merchant adventurer who was in partnership with Rose's eldest brother, Thomas Lok. Hickman and Thomas Lok owned several ships, including the Mary RoseNot the naval vessel Mary Rose which was built in 1510 and sank in the Solent on 19 July 1545. which was named after their respective wives. Accounts of some of their voyages were included by Richard Hakluyt in his Principal Navigations. Rose and her husband were on terms of friendship with prominent Protestant clergymen, including Bishop John Hooper, the martyrologist John Foxe, and the Scottish Protestant leader, John Knox, who mentioned Rose and her husband in several of his letters written between 1556 and 1561 to Anne Locke, Rose's sister-in-law. When the Catholic Mary I came to the throne in 1553, Anthony Hickman and Thomas Lok were committed to the Fleet prison for having aided imprisoned Protestants and for having maintained religious heresy. They were later released to house arrest under the supervision of William Paulet, 1st Marquess of Winchester, and eventually freed. Rose's husband then crossed to Antwerp, while Rose went to friends in Oxfordshire, where she gave birth and had her child baptized as a Catholic after having discussed the matter earlier with Bishops Cranmer, Latimer, and Ridley. After having given birth Rose joined her husband in Antwerp, and while there gave birth to another child whom she had secretly baptized by a Protestant minister. After the death of Queen Mary in November 1558 Rose returned to England, but since her account ends at this point little is known of the remainder of her life apart from the fact that she died on 21 November 1613, aged eighty-six. An epitaph survives from 1637. According to Lowe, although her life was one of devoted Protestantism, 'she was also very caught up with business and material concerns, and with the impact of religious changes on her standard of living'.

Pikes Peak Fuel Company, Pike View Mine, Colorado Springs, 1946 Pikeview (Pike View, Pike's View) is a neighborhood of Colorado Springs, annexed to the city as the \\"Pike View Addition\\" on August 1, 1962. \\"38.9152705 -104.8221988\\" In 1896 there was a Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad station in Pikeview, and miners had begun digging a shaft for the Pikeview Coal Mine. Pikeview also had a quarry beginning 1905 for the mining of limestone for concrete. Coal mining ended in 1957, but the Pikeview Quarry continues to operate. Quarry operations, though, have created a gash or scar in the landscape and efforts have been made since the late 1980s to reclaim the hillside landscape. The Greg Francis Bighorn Sheep Habitat in what had been Queens Canyon Quarry was founded in 2003 in recognition of the individuals and organizations that have worked to create a nature hillside habitat. Railroad station The town of Pikeview, which began as a Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad station (lists numerous maps with Colorado Springs annexations/additions) by 1896. It was named for the scenic view of Pikes Peak away. The Denver and Rio Grande Railroad station was situated at a confluence on Monument Creek, north of the Roswell junction and south from the 1875 Husted station. Colorado Springs water system Two Pike View Reservoirs, which were part of the extension of Colorado Springs Irrigation System to Monument Creek, were constructed in 1894. Town A school house was built in Pikeview north of the station by 1903. The Pikes View Coal Mine was the same distance from the station. The post office was south of the station. By 1906, the station included a depot, a pond, and a road intersection of the north-south Monument Valley Highway (now Interstate 25) with a road west to Rampart Range. Pikeview Coal Mine A shaft was sunk in late 1896 and the main coal was discovered at what would be the Pikeview Mine, also called the Carlton Mine, on January 1, 1897. The Pikeview Mine is a slope mine, which uses the room-and-pillar method to extract coal. In the early 1900s, there was a mass exodus of people from Southern Europe. Many immigrants to the United States headed for the mining towns of Colorado‚Äîlike Pikeview, Papeton, and Franceville‚Äîdirectly after having entered the country. Many of the mine workers were Greek, and when the men went on strike in 1913 a man named Louis Tikas who worked for the United Mine Workers went to the mine to work undercover and take affidavits of workers regarding working conditions. The workers may have been prompted to return to work and await a coordinated union walkout because most of the Pikeview miners returned to work after a few days at the same pay rate. In a letter dated August 28, 1913, Tikas summarized that there were 350 Greek men working in the Southern Fields, which included Pikeview, Las Animas County and Huerfano County mines. There had been 13 men killed on the job and many more that had been injured since January 1, 1913. Affidavits taken by a Greek- speaking individual was important, otherwise information about the immigrants was often overlooked by government and company reports. They also paid very high prices for goods from the company stores, had seen the scales that weighed coal significantly under-report the mined coal per coal car, did not receive good medical treatment, and were dissuaded from seeing attorneys while in the hospital. Tikas reported of the Greek mine workers of Southern Colorado, Labor conflicts like this immediately precipitated the Colorado Coalfield War, a strike that began in September 1913 and ran for more than year, with a significant escalation of violence in late April 1914 following the Ludlow Massacre, during which Tikas and other Greek strikers were killed by Colorado National Guardsmen and local militia. The Pikes Peak Consolidated Fuel Company, a subsidiary of Golden Cycle Mining and Reduction Company, was located in Pikeview in 1920. Harvey McGarry of Colorado Springs was the president and Robert O'Neil of Pikeview was the superintendent. In 1922, Pikeview's economy was nearly entirely based upon mining. The mine was owned by Golden Cycle Mining when it closed operations July 1, 1957. At that time, there were 30 miners who lived in company housing on the site who were affected. Management personnel were transferred to other Golden Cycle operations. Pikeview Quarry=Quarry scar Pikeview Quarry has operated since 1905 and Queens Canyon Quarry has been mined for limestone since 1958. The extraction of the stone by Castle Concrete created a noticeable gash or scar in the Queens Canyon Quarry, north of Garden of the Gods, which closed in 1990. Reclamation There is some mining that occurs at Pikeview Quarry, but that effort is being moved to another side of the hill. As the shift occurs, the terrain will cut back the quarry into the mountain, a plan devised by Greg Francis who worked for Castle Concrete for 30 years and spent 15 of those years working on reclamation of the quarried landscape. He started with Pikeview Quarry, about one mile north of Queen's Quarry. After failed reclamation attempts, he devised the plan to cut back the hill so that it can be \\"resculpted\\" into a terrain that will better support planted trees and landscaping. \\"Time and moisture will blend the quarry into the surrounding hillsides,\\" states Colorado Mountain Reclamation Foundation (formed 1992) project manager, Wanda Reaves. By fall of 2003, 2,000 trees had been planted. An additional 800 trees were to be planted on the Pikeview Quarry in 2004. Castle Concrete intended to mine Pikeview Quarry until 2013, so the reclamation efforts were intended to continue throughout that timeframe. Greg Francis Bighorn Sheep Habitat On August 1, 2003, the hillside was renamed Greg Francis Bighorn Sheep Habitat in honor of Francis, who died October 2002. A statue of a bighorn sheep stands on Greg Francis Bighorn Sheep Habitat in recognition of the herd of 65 bighorns (in 2003) and Greg Francis, hundreds of volunteers, and efforts by Castle Concrete to reintroduce Rocky Mountain juniper trees, native grasses, and small pi√±on to the hills.

It has a number of small tributaries from the northwest side, but none from the southeast. The largest is Boston Creek, about long, which joins Eureka Creek at its bend.

This practice is considered by most militaries around the world to be inhumane, as the attacked personnel would eventually become POWs if parachuted over enemy territory. Attacking parachutists from aircraft in distress is a war crime under the Protocol I addition to the 1949 Geneva Conventions. Firing on airborne forces who are descending by parachute is not prohibited. International law After World War I, a series of meetings were held at The Hague in 1922‚Äì1923. Based on the testimony of First World War pilots, a commission of jurists attempted to codify this practice with the Hague Rules of Air Warfare. Article 20 prescribed that: > When an aircraft has been disabled, the occupants when endeavoring to escape > by means of parachute must not be attacked in the course of their descent. The Hague Rules of Air Warfare never came into force. There was no legal prohibition of targeting parachuting enemy airmen before or during World War II. In 1949, as a result of widespread practices and abuses committed during World War II, the newly modified and updated versions of the Geneva Conventions came into force providing greater protections to protected persons, but there was still no explicit prohibition on the shooting of parachuting enemy combatants outside of their airborne duties. However, despite this, military manuals around the world issued prohibitions on attacking enemy aircrews parachuting from aircraft in distress. Paragraph 30 of the United States Army's Field Manual published by the Department of the Army, on July 18, 1956 (last modified on July 15, 1976), under the title \\"The Law of Land Warfare\\", states: > 30\\\\. Persons Descending by Parachute The law of war does not prohibit firing > upon paratroops or other persons who are or appear to be bound upon hostile > missions while such persons are descending by parachute. Persons other than > those mentioned in the preceding sentence who are descending by parachute > from disabled aircraft may not be fired upon.FM 27-10 The Law of Land > Warfare In 1977, this practice was finally codified in Protocol I in addition to the 1949 Geneva Conventions: > Article 42 ‚Äì Occupants of aircraft :1. No person parachuting from an > aircraft in distress shall be made the object of attack during his descent. > :2. Upon reaching the ground in territory controlled by an adverse Party, a > person who has parachuted from an aircraft in distress shall be given an > opportunity to surrender before being made the object of attack, unless it > is apparent that he is engaging in a hostile act. :3. Airborne troops are > not protected by this Article. First World War Targeting parachutists became an issue during the First World War when fighter pilots targeted manned enemy observation balloons. After shooting down a balloon, most pilots refrained from firing at the balloon observers as they escaped by parachute, because they felt it was inhumane and unchivalrous. The extension of this courtesy to enemy pilots began towards the end of the First World War when parachutes were provided for pilots of fixed-wing aircraft, but it was again widely perceived that once aircrew were forced to bail out of a damaged aircraft, presuming they did not offer any further resistance, they were considered to have been honorably defeated in battle and should not be \\"finished off\\". By July 1918, German and Austro-Hungarian Air Force parachute escapes had become routine. The Heinecke chutes that German and Austro-Hungarian pilots received were not perfect and sometimes failed to operate safely. Some were destroyed by fire before they could open, and occasionally pilots faced the peril of being shot at by Allied fighters. British flying ace James Ira T. Jones had no compunction in doing this. \\"My habit of attacking Huns dangling from parachutes led to many arguments in the mess,\\" he said. \\"Some officers of the Eton and Sandhurst type, thought it 'unsportsmanlike'. Never having been to a public school, I was unhampered by such considerations of 'form'. I just pointed out that there was a bloody war on, and that I intended to avenge my pals.\\" Second World War=War in Europe Luftwaffe fighter ace Adolf Galland strongly rejected the idea of shooting enemy airmen in their parachutes, even if over their own territory, as he felt it was equal to murder. At the beginning of World War II, there was a strong sense of chivalry between the British RAF and German Luftwaffe pilots. They regarded themselves as \\"knights of the air\\" and shooting parachuting enemy aircrew was contrary to their code of honour. The question of shooting an enemy pilot parachuting over his own territory aroused bitter debate on both sides. On August 31, 1940, during the Battle of Britain, RAF Air Chief Marshal Hugh Dowding dined with Prime Minister Winston Churchill at Chequers. After dinner, they discussed the morality of shooting parachuting Luftwaffe pilots. Dowding suggested that German pilots were perfectly entitled to shoot RAF pilots parachuting over Britain as they were still potential combatants (i.e., piloting new aircraft to conduct another military mission) while RAF pilots should refrain from firing at German pilots as they were out of combat and would eventually become prisoners of war once they landed on British soil. Churchill was appalled by this suggestion, arguing that shooting a parachuting pilot \\"was like drowning a sailor\\".The London Gazette, number 158-160 On the German side, Luftwaffe commander-in-chief Hermann G√∂ring asked Luftwaffe fighter ace Adolf Galland about what he thought about shooting enemy pilots while in their parachutes, even over their own territory. Galland replied that, \\"I should regard it as murder, Herr Reichsmarschall. I should do everything in my power to disobey such an order\\". G√∂ring‚Äîwho had been a fighter ace himself during World War I‚Äîsaid, \\"That is just the reply I had expected from you, Galland\\".Galland 2005, pp. 67‚Äì68. Despite such sentiments, there were a number of incidents where the shooting of parachuting enemy aviators occurred. On September 1, 1939, in the Modlin area, during the German invasion of Poland, pilots of the Polish Pursuit Brigade encountered a group of 40 German bombers escorted by 20 Bf 109 and Bf 110 fighters. During combat, Lt. Aleksander Gabszewicz was forced to bail out of his aircraft. While in his parachute, Gabszewicz was shot at by a Bf 110. Second Lt. Tadeusz Sawicz, flying nearby, attacked the German plane and another Polish pilot, Wladyslaw Kiedrzynski, spiraled around the defenseless Gabszewicz until he reached the ground. On September 2, Sec. Lt. Jan Dzwonek, along with eight other Polish pilots, attacked a couple of German fighters approaching their direction. In the battle, Dzwonek's plane was shot down and he was forced to bail out. Hanging in his parachute, he was attacked twice by a Bf 110. Apparently, the Luftwaffe pilot was so busy attacking the defenseless Dzwonek that Corporal Jan Malinowski, flying an obsolete P.7 fighter, downed the German plane. Dzwonek later recounted the story: During the Battle of Britain, Polish and Czech pilots serving in the RAF sometimes shot at Luftwaffe pilots parachuting over Britain. Many Germans charged that this was regular practice by the Poles and the Czechs, but there was little hard evidence of it. The leading historian of the Polish Air Force, Adam Zamoyski, conceded that \\"it is true that some pilots still finished off parachuting Germans by flying directly over them; the slipstream would cause the parachute to cannon and the man would fall into the ground like a stone.\\" In mid-1942, the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) arrived in Britain and carried out air raids over German- occupied Europe. There are verified accounts of German fighter pilots stopping their attacks to allow bomber crews to parachute from mortally stricken bombers. Nevertheless, the air war was bloody business and the objective of both sides was to wipe out the other. Some USAAF fighter pilots claimed they received unwritten orders from their officers to shoot enemy airmen parachuting over their own territory as they would rejoin their own units upon landing and fly in the air again to kill more Americans. Virgil Meroney of the 487th Fighter Squadron never shot a German pilot in his parachute, although on the other hand, he understood the mean realities of warfare and had no problem about killing an enemy aviator, regardless of whether or not he was helpless. On March 8, 1944, Meroney and his Blue Flight were at the rear of 352d Fighter Group as it reached the end of its escort leg. The group turned to leave as they crossed the Dutch border into Germany near Meppen. \\"Three Me 109s came out of the sun with a lot of speed and made a 90-degree attack on the rear bombers, breaking away in rolls,\\" Meroney recalled. \\"I called them in and went after the lead two as they stayed together, the third having broken in a different direction.\\" Meroney drove his P-47 along with his squadron to attack the Germans who were trying to shoot down the USAAF B-17 heavy bombers and fired at the German planes. When the German pilot realized that his Bf 109 was badly in flames, he jumped out of his plane and pulled out his parachute. Amazingly, Meroney and his squadron didn't fire at the German pilot who was parachuting safely back to earth. This might have been because he and his flight were low on fuel and there was no knowing if there were other enemy aircraft in the area. Indeed, that more pilots and aircrew were not shot in their parachutes was probably due at least in part to the nature of aerial combat. The fights were a confusing whirl and a pilot who concentrated too long and hard on killing a man in a parachute could easily fall prey himself and end up, ironically, in the position of being shot up while in his parachute. Not molesting enemy pilots in their parachutes was a practical matter as well as a chivalrous one. On December 20, 1943, a B-17 bomber piloted by 2nd Lt. Charles 'Charlie' Brown, after a successful bombing run on the German city of Bremen, was attacked by dozens of German fighters. Brown's bomber was seriously damaged, most of his crewmen were wounded, and his tail gunner was killed. Luftwaffe pilot and ace Franz Stigler then approached the crippled bomber. He was able to see the injured and incapacitated crew. To the American pilot's surprise, Stigler did not open fire on the crippled bomber. Remembering the words of one of his commanding officers from the Jagdgeschwader 27, Gustav R√∂del, during his time fighting in North Africa, \\"You are fighter pilots first, last, always. If I ever hear of any of you shooting at someone in a parachute, I'll shoot you myself.\\" Stigler later commented, \\"To me, it was just like they were in a parachute. I saw them and I couldn't shoot them down.\\" Twice, Stigler tried to get Brown to land his plane at a German airfield and surrender, or divert to nearby neutral Sweden, where he and his crew would receive medical treatment but be interned and sit out the remainder of the war. Brown refused and flew on. Stigler then flew near Brown's plane, escorting it until they reached the North Sea and departed with a salute. Still, both German and American pilots did shoot enemy airmen in their parachutes, albeit infrequently. Richard \\"Bud\\" Peterson, a P-51 pilot with the 357th Fighter Group, based in Leiston, agreed that \\"normally, nobody, including the Germans, would be shooting anybody in a parachute. It just wasn't done. I mean, there's no challenge with shooting a guy in a parachute, for God's sake.\\" However, on one mission he saw a Bf 109 systematically firing at American B-17 bomber crews as they descended in their parachutes. After Peterson forced the offending German pilot to bail out, he killed him as he was descending. He recalled that some of his unit were nervous that this would invite a retaliatory response from the Luftwaffe. \\"But they had to be there to know what I was seeing,\\" Peterson said. \\"Those guys were helpless, the bomber crews going down\\". Several German sources (examples below) claim that American pilots frequently practised shooting at parachutes, especially closer to the end of the war when Germany had more planes than pilots: Thaen Kwock Lee was a B-17 waist gunner with the 483rd Bomb Group, a 15th Air Force unit, when his aircraft was shot down by German Me 262s on March 22, 1945. He recalled that he and his crew bailed out in their parachutes and while descending back to earth, they were attacked by German Me 262s: While some American aviators shot enemy airmen in parachutes, the vast majority of USAAF fighter pilots detested the practice as they could not reconcile themselves to the notion of killing helpless enemy airmen. They insisted that they were trying to destroy aircraft rather than pilots. If an enemy airman perished with his aircraft, it was simply the brutal nature of war. But shooting him while he was in his parachute was quite another matter that few of them could stomach, even if he stood a good chance of flying in the air again. USAAF pilot Stanley Miles shared his experience on May 13, 1944, when the 352nd encountered a massive formation of enemy fighters. After getting involved in a dogfight with one of the German planes for a while, Miles shot down the plane, which caused the German pilot to bail out in his parachute. \\"I had my gun camera running,\\" he recalled, \\"so I got some good shots of the tracers hitting the plane and the pilot jumping out. My wing-man was still with me, so I eased around, came back and got some nice film footage of the German pilot in his chute.\\" Miles considered shooting the enemy pilot as he drifted helplessly back to earth. It was a topic that he and his squadron units had considered in earnest. \\"One school of thought was that if you didn't shoot the guy, he'd land and be right back up fighting you the next day. I couldn't do it, however, and just took the film footage of him.\\" Most American pilots used gun cameras to ensure they had adequate proof of their victories. Robert O' Nan of the 487th Fighter Squadron did this on April 10, 1944, after forcing a Focke-Wulf Fw 190 pilot to abandon his aircraft: \\"I followed the plane down where it crashed, exploded, and burned up, in the middle of a plowed field. I took pictures of this. I also got pictures of the pilot dangling in his chute.\\" None of them were considering shooting German pilots hanging in their parachutes. U.S. General Dwight D. Eisenhower, Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in Europe, felt compelled to specifically forbid the practice. In the directive issued to U.S. Major General Carl Spaatz, commander of the United States Strategic Air Forces in Europe, and British Air Chief Marshal Arthur Tedder (or Sir Arthur Harris according to D-Day Bombers: The Veterans' Story: RAF Bomber Command and the US Eighth Air Force Support to the Normandy Invasion 1944 by Stephen Darlow) on June 2, 1944, in a preparation for Operation Overlord, he wrote: There were episodes of shooting parachuting aircrew in the Mediterranean theater: on October 2, 1942, Captain Livio Ceccotti of the Regia Aeronautica was engaged by five Allied fighters, reportedly Spitfires, and after a dogfight in which two Spitfires were reportedly downed by him he was hit and forced to bail out from his Macchi C.202 fighter; as he was descending, he was reportedly shot at and killed by the surviving three fighters. War in the Asia and the Pacific While World War II began in Asia with the start of the full-scale war between China and the Empire of Japan, the Japanese gained a bad reputation among the Allies in the war in Asia and the Pacific for shooting enemy airmen dangling in their parachutes. This was because the Japanese viewed surrender as dishonorable and to them, bailed-out enemy pilots were considered to have surrendered. The first confirmed case was over the Chinese city of Nanking on September 19, 1937, during the Second Sino-Japanese War, when Chinese pilot Lt. Liu Lanqing (ÂäâËò≠Ê∏Ö) of the 17th Pursuit Squadron, 3rd Pursuit Group flying P-26 Model 281 fighters, bailed out in his parachute after being shot down by IJNAS aircraft. Hanging in his parachute, he was killed after being shot by Japanese pilots;https://air.mnd.gov.tw/TW/History/History_Detail.aspx Lt. Liu's squadron leader Capt. John Huang Xinrui tried shooting off the Japanese pilots taking turns shooting at Lt. Liu, but was shot down and had to bail out himself, and waited until the last possible moment to rip his parachute cord.https://blog.xuite.net/tom1958/joy/304821596 Pilots from both the IJNAS and IJAAS did this routinely throughout the war. As a result, Chinese and Russian volunteer pilots delayed opening their parachutes to avoid being shot at. Even after a safe parachute descent, the Japanese still went after them. In July 1938, one Russian volunteer, Valentin Dudonov, bailed out in his parachute and landed on a sand bank in Lake Poyang after a collision with an IJNAS A5M aircraft. Another A5M aircraft came and strafed him on the sand bank. Dudonov had to jump and hide under water in the lake to avoid being attacked. Japan's top ace fighter pilot Tetsuz≈ç Iwamoto was summoned twice to Douglas MacArthur's Allied GHQ office in Tokyo for questioning about attacks on pilots who have bailed out of their aircraft in China and the Pacific War, but was cleared of war crime charges. On December 23, 1941, 12 P-40 pilots of the American Volunteer Group (AVG) Flying Tigers intercepted 54 Japanese bombers escorted by 20 pursuit planes, who were bombing the city of Rangoon in Burma. During the battle, the AVG downed only five Japanese bombers with the loss of two P-40 pilots. P-40 pilot Paul J. Greene's plane was badly damaged which forced him to bail out in his parachute. He was shot at by Japanese fighters while descending to earth but managed to survive. \\"You want to see my 'chute,\\" he told Daily Express war correspondent O.D. Gallagher. \\"It's got more holes in it than the nose of a watering-can.\\" On January 23, 1942, the AVG attacked Japanese bombers and fighters who resumed carrying out bombing raids on Rangoon. The AVG shot down 21, suffering only a single loss of a pilot named Bert Christman. During the dogfight, Christman's plane was damaged and he was forced to bail out. While parachuting over the rice paddies south of Rangoon, he was killed after being attacked by three IJAAS Nakajima aircraft. Bert Christman was buried the next day at the church of Edward The Martyr in Rangoon. Christman's remains were returned to his birthplace of Fort Collins, Colorado, after the war, where he was buried on February 4, 1950. In June 1942, as part of the Japanese Midway operation, the Japanese attacked the Aleutian islands, off the south coast of Alaska. Tadayoshi Koga, a 19-year-old flight petty officer first class, was launched from the Japanese aircraft carrier Ry≈´j≈ç as part of the June 4 raid. Koga was part of a three-plane section. His wingmen were Chief Petty Officer Makoto Endo and Petty Officer Tsuguo Shikada. Koga and his comrades attacked Dutch Harbor, shooting down an American PBY-5A Catalina flying boat piloted by Bud Mitchell and strafing its survivors in the water. Three successive attacks killed the PBY's crew. Koga was then killed when his damaged aircraft crash-landed on the island of Akutan. During the Malayan Campaign in 1942, Japanese pilots often shot British, Commonwealth, and Dutch airmen hanging in their parachutes. Australian pilot Herb Plenty witnessed a Dutch Brewster aircraft being shot down by Japanese fighters and the pilot bailed out in his parachute on January 17, 1942, near Bilton Island, some miles of Singapore. He also said that while most Japanese fighters were heading back to their own bases, two of them, however, came back and shot the parachuting Dutch pilot: On March 31, 1943, a squadron of USAAF B-24 bombers sent to destroy a bridge at Pyinmana, Burma, were attacked by Japanese Zero fighters. One B-24 aircraft was shot down and its occupants, including 2nd Lt Owen J. Baggett, bailed out. While the downed B-24 crew members were descending, they were machine gunned by Japanese fighters. Two of the crewmen were killed and Baggett was wounded in the arm. He then played dead in his harness, hoping the Japanese would leave him alone. One Japanese plane, however, circled and approached very close to Baggett to make sure he was dead. Baggett raised his M1911 pistol and fired four shots into the cockpit, hitting the pilot; the Zero stalled and crashed. Baggett became legendary as the only person to have downed a Japanese aircraft with a M1911 pistol. The aircraft engaged were Ki 43 Hayabusa, a smaller aircraft that was often mistaken as the zero due to its similar shape. On September 15, 1943, seven B-24s of the 308's 373rd Squadron based at Yangkai Airfield were dispatched to attack a Vichy French cement plant in Haiphong, a major port on the Gulf of Tonkin, that had just been turned over to the Japanese though not without resistance from Governor-General of French Indochina, Jean Decoux. Two B-24s, however, broke down while attempting to take off from Yangkai Airfield so the five remaining planes continued the mission. When the five B-24s reached Haiphong, they were attacked by Japanese fighters. One plane went down, forcing the other planes to abandon the mission as they were continuously attacked. Two more planes went down and forced the aircrews to bail out. The Japanese pilots then went after one of the B-24 plane's parachutists and fired at them while they were descending to the ground, killing three and wounding three others. The other two B-24 planes escaped severe damage and returned to Yangkai Airfield (one plane, however, crashed at the airfield, killing the entire crew). On May 5, 1945, an American B-29 bomber was flying with a dozen other aircraft after bombing Tachiaral Air Base in southwestern Japan, beginning the return flight to Guam. Kinzou Kasuya, a 19-year-old Japanese pilot flying one of the Japanese fighters in pursuit of the Americans, rammed his aircraft into the fuselage of the B-29, destroying both planes. No one knows for certain how many Americans were in the B-29 as its crew had been hastily assembled on Guam. Villagers in Japan who witnessed the collision in the air saw about a dozen parachutes blossom. One of the Americans died when the cords of his parachute were severed by another Japanese plane. A second was alive when he reached the ground. He shot all but his last bullet at the villagers coming toward him, then used the last on himself. The other nine B-29 airmen who were captured by the Japanese after landing were subjected to vivisection at the Kyushu Imperial University. Professor Ishiyama Fukujir≈ç and other doctors conducted four such sessions throughout May and early-June. The Western Military Command assisted in arranging these operations. Many of the Japanese personnel responsible for the deaths of Allied airmen were prosecuted in the Yokohama War Crimes Trials following World War II. Several of those found guilty were executed and the remainder were imprisoned.Takai and Sakaida (2001), p. 116 Syrian Civil War In September 2015, Russia conducted military operations within Syria in furtherance of securing areas, bombing areas held by terrorist groups, including the Syrian Turkmen Brigades, which operate close to the Syria‚ÄìTurkey border. On November 24, 2015, a Russian Su-24 attack jet was shot down by a Turkish F-16C, and the two pilots ejected within Syrian territory controlled by Turkmen rebels. A commander of the Syrian Turkmen Brigades told Reuters that his forces opened fire on a pilot parachuting from the downed aircraft while attempting to land in non-rebel territory, and the group uploaded an image of rebel soldiers holding flaps of a NPP Zvezda K-36 ejection seat. Russian RIA later reported after retrieval that one of the pilots was killed by gunfire.

Career  His work appeared in the pages and covers of Cosmopolitan, Life and Time Magazine among others. Maxwell married Alice Coplan and they had two daughters, Nancy & Connie. He is survived by his daughters and three grandchildren, David Coplan Schneider, Scott Coplan Schneider and Catie Coplan Cannon. Maxwell trained his grandson, David Coplan Schneider in photography from the age of five. David currently resides in Tarrytown, NY . He runs the award-winning photography and cinematography studio Dideo Films Photography with Danielle Spirer Schneider. Maxwell Frederic Coplan spent much time traveling with and capturing the Big Top Circus, Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus, often shooting with a Rolleiflex camera. Here's an excerpt from his book on the Circus, Pink Lemonade \\"When Maxwell Coplan clicks his camera under \\"the big top\\" he gets as great a thrill as the kid who carries water for the elephants. In fact, the circus was responsible for his photographic career. Following his graduation from the Pennsylvania Museum's School of Industrial Art in Philadelphia, where he had been a scholarship student, he was commissioned to do a painting on a circus subject - just one day before the circus was to leave town. Working against time, he borrowed a friend's camera and took several pictures of the circus under the friend's direction. He thumbtacked the best one alongside his easel and referred to it for detail. When his client came to see the work, he looked first at the painting, then at the photograph then at Coplan, and said, \\"We'll take the photograph instead of the painting - and we'll pay you the same price!\\" Max had spent three weeks on the painting and 1/50th of a second taking the photograph, so he thought he was missing something. He went out and bought a camera identical to his friend's, and before long he was in New York working as a staff photographer on a national magazine. After almost a year in what he considered a rut, spring and the circus came along, and he ran away from his job and joined the circus. Many of the photographs in this book were taken then. Since then, the camera has taken him around most of the world, on assignments for every national magazine. The work has required him to fly thousands of miles in the past five years, be he still gets a bigger thrill from the man on the flying trapeze - who only flies a few feet!\\" Coplan, Maxwell Frederic, Pink Lemonade Maxwell Frederic Coplan also published cover designs for The Literary Digest, from the late 1930s to 1960's. An article entitled \\"Maxwell Coplan  The Human Touch\\" was published in the January‚ÄìFebruary 1958 edition of Print, a popular quarterly periodical of the time. The following is an excerpt from the article: \\"For those tired of the slick or superficial photographs so prevalent in today's advertising, Maxwell Coplan's honest, direct editorial photographs come as a welcome relief...The secret of Coplan's wide success is his bond of sympathy with the subject that comes through. In discussing the many people he has met as subjects for his camera, he never fails to be enthusiastic about them and his work. Maxwell Coplan started to take pictures on an old Graphlex, bought in a pawn show on time payments, while still an art student. He now uses a reflex camera almost exclusively. Although he does studio work, he prefers shooting on location because he likes the challenge of the problems that evolve. This preference has sent him all over the world on assignments by leading magazines and national advertisers. In 1945 he published a book on circus pictures, an early love, that has become something of a classic in his field. Coplan recently had a retrospective exhibition of his work in the Westcott & Thomson Galleries, in Philadelphia, where his work was exceptionally well received.\\" \\"I rank Coplan with the very best photographers now taking pictures in America. His sense of open spaces in relation to foreground is one of his outstanding characteristics. I would call him an outdoor photographer with a keen sense of the dramatic and a most unusual and original feeling for design. His warm and transparent shadows and the strength of his black lift his pictures out of the ordinary realms of photography.\\" - Manuel Komroff References Category:1912 births Category:1985 deaths Category:20th-century American photographers ","title":"Maxwell Frederic Coplan"},{"id":"41109464","text":"The modern-day character and the historical status of women in Denmark has been influenced by their own involvement in women's movements and political participation in the history of Denmark. Their mark can be seen in the fields of politics, women's suffrage, and literature, among others. History The legal, civilian, and cultural status of women in prehistoric society during the Stone Age, Bronze Age and Iron Age in Scandinavia are somewhat obscure, but from Viking Age sources we know that women were relatively free, compared to men, contemporary societies and the later Middle Ages.Ingelman-Sundberg, Catharina, Forntida kvinnor: j√§gare, vikingahustru, pr√§stinna [Ancient women: hunters, viking wife, priestess], Prisma, Stockholm, 2004 With the gradual introduction of Catholicism in Scandinavia in the early Middle Ages, women's rights were increasingly regulated and restricted. During the Middle Ages, the legal rights of women in Denmark were regulated by the county laws, the landskabslovene from the 13th-century, and therefore varied somewhat between different counties: however, a married woman was generally under the guardianship of her spouse.Inger D√ºbeck: Kvinders retlige stilling. I Den Store Danske. Hentet 7. october 2015 Sons and daughters both had right to inheritance, though sisters inherited half of the portion of a brother. The cities were regulated by the city laws. With the exception of widows, who inherited the right to the trade of her late spouse, women was not allowed membership in the guilds, which monopolized most professions in the cities: however, in practice, it was very common for women, whether married or not, to be granted dispensation to manage a minor business for the sake of her own support, and become a k√∏bekone (business woman), a custom which continued until women were given the same rights as men within commerce in 1857. The Civil Code of 1683, or Christian 5.s Danske Lov (also enacted in the Danish province of Norway as the Civil Code of 1687 or Christian Vs Norske LovL√∏nn√•, Elisabeth. (2015, 31. mars). Kvinners Rettigheter I Norge Fra 1814 Til 1913. I Store norske leksikon. ), defined all unmarried females regardless of age as minors under the guardianship of their closest male relative, and a married woman under the guardianship of her spouse, while only widows were of legal majority.Stig Iuul: Kodifikation eller kompilation?: Christian v's Danske lov paa baggrund af √¶ldre ret.B. Lunos bogtr., 1954 This code was in effect until the 19th-century: in 1857, unmarried women were given legal majority, while married women were given the same right in 1899. Girls were included as pupils in the first attempt of a public elementary school system in 1739, though this attempt was not fully realized until 1814. From the 1780s, schools for secondary education for females were established in the capital of Copenhagen, though female teachers were only allowed to teach girls or very small boys. One of the first schools for females of any note was the D√∏treskolen af 1791, and in the 1840s, schools for girls spread outside the capital and a net of secondary education girl schools was established in Denmark. In 1875, women were given access to university education. In the reformed law of access in 1921, women were formally given access to all professions and positions in society with the exception of some military and clerical positions and the position of judge (given in 1936). Women's movement There had been two major periods of women's movement in Denmark. The first one was from 1870 to 1920. The second was from 1970 to 1985. The first women's movement was led by the Dansk Kvindesamfund (\\"Danish Women's Society\\"). Line Luplau was one of the most notable woman in this era. Tagea Brandt was also part of this movement, and in her honor was established Tagea Brandt Rejselegat or Travel Scholarship for women. The Dansk Kvindesamfund's efforts as a leading group of women for women led to the existence of the revised Danish constitution of 1915, giving women the right to vote and the provision of equal opportunity laws during the 1920s, which influenced the present-day legislative measures to grant women access to education, work, marital rights and other obligations. Following the International Congress of Women held in The Hague in 1915, Danske Kvinders Fredsk√¶de or the Danish Women's Peace Chain was established in Denmark. It called for women to provide more active support for peace once the First World War was over. The second wave of women's movement was organized with the R√∏dstr√∏mpebev√¶gelsen (the Red Stocking movement). The effort led to \\"institutionalized feminism\\" (managed directly by the Danish government) and to the \\"mainstreaming of equal opportunities\\" between Danish men and women. Women's suffrage Women in Denmark gained the right to vote on 5 June 1915. The Danish Women's Society (DK) debated, and informally supported, women's suffrage from 1884, but it did not support it publicly until in 1887, when it supported the suggestion of the parliamentarian Fredrik Bajer to grant women municipal suffrage.Dansk Kvindebiografisk Leksikon In 1886, in response to the perceived overcautious attitude of DK in the question of women suffrage, Matilde Bajer founded the Kvindelig Fremskridtsforening (or KF, 1886-1904) to deal exclusively with the right to suffrage, both in municipal and national elections, and it 1887, the Danish women publicly demanded the right for women's suffrage for the first time through the KF. However, as the KF was very much involved with worker's rights and pacifist activity, the question of women's suffrage was in fact not given full attention, which led to the establishment of the strictly women's suffrage movement Kvindevalgretsforeningen (1889-1897). In 1890, the KF and the Kvindevalgretsforeningen united with five women's trade worker's unions to found the De samlede Kvindeforeninger, and through this form, an active women's suffrage campaign was arranged through agitation and demonstration. However, after having been met by compact resistance, the Danish suffrage movement almost discontinued with the dissolution of the De samlede Kvindeforeninger in 1893. In 1898, an umbrella organization, the Danske Kvindeforeningers Valgretsforbund or DKV was founded and became a part of the International Woman Suffrage Alliance (IWSA). In 1907, the Landsforbundet for Kvinders Valgret (LKV) was founded by Elna Munch, Johanne Rambusch and Marie Hjelmer in reply to what they considered to be the much too careful attitude of the Danish Women's Society. The LKV originated from a local suffrage association in Copenhagen, and like its rival LKV, it successfully organized other such local associations nationally. Women won the right to vote in municipal elections on April 20, 1908\\\\. However it was not until June 5, 1915 that they were allowed to vote in Rigsdag elections.Report from Denmark in European Database Women in Decision-making. Parliamentary appointments and elections Helle Thorning-Schmidt, Prime Minister of Denmark between 2011 ‚Äì 2015 In 1918, a total of twelve Danish women were elected to the Danish parliament. Four of those women were elected to the Lower House (known as the Folketinget), while eight Danish women were elected to the Upper House (known as the Landstinget). In 1924, Nina Bang became the first female minister of Denmark, making Denmark the second country in the world to have a female minister. Jytte Anderson served as Minister of Employment from 1993 to 1998. Anderson was later appointed in 1998 as Senior Minister for Construction and Housing. In 1999, Andersen was appointed as the first Danish Minister on Gender Equality in 1999. A second female minister in Denmark was elected twenty years later (counting from 1924). Subsequently, the percentage of female members in governments of Denmark, has generally increased, and in 2000 it was at its highest with 45%. The first female mayor in Denmark was Eva Madsen who became mayor of Stege in 1950, and the first female Head of State (Statsminister) was Helle Thorning-Schmidt who became Prime Minister in 2011. Family life Percentage of births to unmarried women, in selected countries, including Denmark, 1980 and 2007. By 1980, Denmark already had a high percentage (compared to most other countries) of births outside of marriage The Danish culture is largely irreligious, in particular when it comes to religious dogmas, and this is also reflected in the everyday social life, including family culture. As in many other Western countries, the connection between child birth and marriage has thus been significantly weakened since the later half of the 20th century. As of 2016, 54% of births were to unmarried women.http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/table.do?tab=table&plugin;=1&language;=en&pcode;=tps00018 During the 1960s and 70s, Denmark was one of the first European countries to change its social norms towards accepting unmarried cohabitation and childbearing, at a time when this was still seen as unacceptable in many other parts of the continent. Reproductive rights and sexuality Woman with child in Copenhagen The maternal mortality rate in Denmark is 12 deaths/100,000 live births (as of 2010). Although this is low by international standards, it is higher than in many other Western countries, and it has increased in recent years. Abortion laws were liberalized in 1973, allowing the procedure to be done on-demand during the first 12 weeks, and in specific circumstances at later stages of the pregnancy. Denmark's HIV/AIDS rate is 0.2% of adults (aged 15‚Äì49) ‚Äì estimates of 2009. The total fertility rate (TFR) in Denmark is 1.73 children born/woman (2014 estimates), which, although below the replacement rate, is one of the highest in Europe. Denmark provides for sex education in schools. The age of consent in Denmark is 15. Denmark has a reputation of being \\"open\\" with regards to sexuality, perhaps due to historical factors, such as being the first country to abolish censorship and legalize pornography in 1967. However, today the Danish pornography industry is minimal compared to many other countries, with large scale production of pornography having moved to other countries. Violence against women The issues of violence against women and domestic violence are controversial; according to a 2014 study published by the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, Denmark had the highest prevalence rate of physical and sexual violence against women in Europe. Denmark has also received harsh criticism for inadequate laws in regard to sexual violence in a 2008 report produced by Amnesty International, which described Danish laws as \\"inconsistent with international human rights standards\\".http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrc/docs/ngos/AI_Denmark_November2010.pdf This led to Denmark reforming its sexual offenses legislation in 2013. Denmark has also ratified the Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence. A 2010 Eurobarometer poll on violence against women found that victim blaming attitudes used to be common in Denmark: 71% of Danes agreed with the assertion that the \\"provocative behaviour of women\\" was a cause of violence against women, well above the 52% European average.http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_344_en.pdf However, according to the 2016 report, only 13% of respondents agree that sexual intercourse without consent can be justified in certain situations.https://ec.europa.eu/commfrontoffice/publicopinionmobile/index.cfm/Survey/getSurveyDetail/surveyKy/2115 A 2019 poll found that the vast majority of Danes are aware of the seriousness of domestic abuse, with more than 86% of respondents rating multiple forms of violence against women as \\"very serious\\". Notable Danish women=Suffrage and politics Line luplau seen in the foreground on her daughter Marie Luplau's large group portrait painting From the Early Days of the Fight for Women's Suffrage (1897). Among notable female Danes was Matilde Bajer, who ‚Äì together with her husband Fredrik Bajer ‚Äì founded the Danish Women's Society in 1871, one of the oldest women's rights organizations in the world. Another notable Danish woman was Lise N√∏rgaard (b. 1917), a Danish author and journalist during the 1930s and the 1940s. She authored the autobiographical books such as the Kun en pige (\\"Just a Girl\\", 1992) and De sendte en dame (\\"They Sent a Lady\\", 1993). Another notable Danish woman was Line Luplau, who achieved national fame in 1887 when she supported the cause to grant women to vote during local elections. Literature In literature, one of the most notable female literary writers in Denmark was Karen Blixen (1885‚Äì1962). She was also known by the pseudonyms Isak Dinesen and Tania Blixen. Blixen was the author of the Seven Gothic Tales (1934), a collection of short stories, which she wrote at the age of 49.

Its favorable position at the western end of the channel along with the efforts of the economic administrators have allowed the port to survive and develop itself within the different fields surrounding the sea. Amongst the 13 main Breton ports, Roscoff is one of the largest commercial harbours on the list. File:PSCoucherBatzd.jpgport of Bloscon-Roscoff File:Roscoff vue Chapelle St- Barbe.jpgport of Bloscon-Roscoff  History  Roscoff has played an important role in the history of Brittany and France with a rich and diverse past. Whether it be in the defence of the region, the transport of local produce or fishing, the port seems to have always been involved. Indeed, at the time when France and England were sworn enemies, Roscoff was host to bloody battles. It seems as though the area was at the time a strategic stretch of land to pass through, being a stone's throw from England and the heart of local trading. The area along with the rest of Brittany coasts witnessed bloody naval battles such as in 1404, when a fleet of 30 ships fought against the English in the bay of Laber under the command of Jean du Penhoat. The outcome of these fierce battles varied, with both sides having succumbed to great losses. However, later on, the outlook towards the neighbouring countries changed dramatically. Eased tensions allowed business to take place more permissively. In fact, by 1828, Henri Ollivier, alias the ‚Äúfirst Johnny‚Äù, made the crossing of the channel to sell onions for the first time. Today, their number is nowhere near as high as it once was. Nevertheless, the amount of ‚Äújohnnies‚Äù has been recovering slightly in recent years thanks to a renewed interest. Some of the other products being conveyed were cauliflowers, potatoes and artichokes for cabotage, eggs, salted butter and some crustaceans. By the end of the 19th century, there was a high demand for a pier to be constructed, the first mention of this dating back to 1882. Indeed, a major issue with the port at the time was the considerable range between high and low water. This would lead to a complete drying of the port. Finally, construction began in August 2012. For a number of reasons, the building of the jetty was only completely achieved by 1934-35 and sadly, too late. Roscoff missed out on the intense shipping traffic era and saw instead a period where exportation was at a low point. On the other hand, fishing also represented a large chunk of the economy of the region. A diverse kind of fish and crustaceans were caught in local seas and either sold in the area or exported. Later on, another technique was thought of by Monsieur Chevalier. Once permission was granted in 1863, the captain established a pool with a maximum capacity of 80000 crustaceans in a small bay alongside the chapel of Saint Barbe. File:Roscoff 81 Le port en 1873 J.Duclos.jpgPort in 1873  Passenger terminal  The construction of a deep water port went on from 1970 until 1972, on the initiative of business and political leaders from the region of Morlaix, the management being dealt with by the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Morlaix. As a result, A ferry dock long by 240 meters specifically reserved for ferries and equipped with a dual lane ramp 70 meters in length appeared on the scene. Yet, another issue stood in the way of their project: no company was willing to take the risk of making the port of Bloscon one of their proposed destinations, on the grounds that there was no market in the west. For this reason, Alexis Gourvennec, founder of the SICA (Society of Agricultural Collective Interest) of Saint-Pol-de-L√©on, along with the vegetable producers whom were part of this at the time, came up with the creation of the BAI society (Brittany, England, Ireland, better known under its commercial name: Brittany Ferries). Naturally, at first, its original purpose was oriented towards the export of vegetables. Today, just one maritime firms come to dock in Roscoff: \\\\- Brittany Ferries, with 2 destinations: Plymouth and Cork \\\\- Irish Ferries, sailed to-and-fro between Rosslare and Roscoff from 1995 until 2018. They now use Cherbourg as their French destination instead. As of 2011, the total of cross channel-traffic shared out between Roscoff and Saint-Malo was 960586 passengers. File:The Roscoff ferry passing Heybrook Bay - geograph.org.uk - 742272.jpgferry outward bound  Fishing  In 2001, a new field was furthermore improved with the arrival of 2 quays providing a linear docking of 190 meters, as well as a modern auction. These constructions now offer the best conditions to the professionals within the field for a better profitability.

Nevertheless, a couple of quays were put in place, respectively of 120m and 90m in length. The largest one being able to support freighters of up to 5000 tonnes. Facilities within the harbour provide adequate storage for the discharged cargo. Hence, Roscoff can meet the needs of companies in the hinterland.  Marina  The project of a marina came about in the early 2000s. Finally the plan was approved and its undertaking commenced in 2009‚Äì2010, for an expected duration of 4 years. Despite the fact that it was incomplete, the dock was opened to the public on June 15, 2012. An angled pier ensures its protection from the swell. 625 berths are available along the pontoons, 50 of these for visitors.  Events  The port of Bloscon hosted the start of the Tourduf race in 2012.

William F. Dixon Pioneer William F. Dixon, the first to settle in Cheyenne Canon, claimed the land in 1862 for what would be the Dixon Ranch and orchard. He built irrigation ditches for his farm and orchard and raised cattle. A portion of his property that had been apple orchards became the El Pomar estate. The Potter estate In 1909 or 1910, Grace Goodyear Depew built a Spanish style single-story house named El Pomar, Spanish for \\"the apple orchard\\". In April 1910, Grace married Captain Howard Ashton Potter. Mr. Potter lived in another house on the estate when the couple's relationship became strained and he died in 1913. Grace Potter died in 1914. Author Julian Street called it the \\"house of houses\\" in Colorado Springs, not knowing one in the country that \\"fits its setting better than this one, or which is more perfect thing from every point of view.\\" The Penrose estate Spencer and Julie Penrose purchased El Pomar, the Potter's wine cellar collection, and house furnishings in 1916 for $75,000 () near The Broadmoor, a resort that they had built following a European vacation. They added second and third floors to the house. The estate buildings included the main house, gate lodge, carriage house, gardener's cottage, chauffeur's cottage, and a teahouse. Furnishings purchased for built for the Penroses that remain in El Pomar include Vermont Corona and Belgian black marble, a rare Aeolian organ with ceiling decorations over vents that allowed organ music to drift throughout the house, secret doors that held a wine cellar in the library during Prohibition, and some furnishings. James Bell, who had been president of the National Association of Gardeners, was superintendent of El Pomar until his death in 1920. Sisters of Charity retreat In 1944, following her husband's death in 1939, Julie Penrose moved out of El Pomar and into a penthouse suite at The Broadmoor. She donated the estate to The Sisters of Charity of Cincinnati, who used it as a spiritual retreat center for almost 50 years. Named the Julie Penrose Center, it was the first Catholic retreat center for women west of the Mississippi. It was administered by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Denver. El Pomar Foundation In 1992, El Pomar became the headquarters for the El Pomar Foundation, founded by Spencer and Julie Penrose in 1937. The foundation initiated a restoration of the estate in 1992 to be used as a conference center, while preserving the integrity of the original architecture. The estate is now the Penrose House Nonprofit Conference and Education Center for non-profit organizations. It has been visited by Margaret Thatcher, Mikhail Gorbachev, and George H. W. Bush, former heads of state.

Fossil remains have been found in the United Kingdom and Romania. Evolution Recent revalidation of the species Mammuthus rumanus influences several interrelated aspects of mammoth evolution. European material referred to M. rumanus might provide a useful background for the identification of finds from Africa and the Middle East. It seems plausible that M. rumanus originated in Africa c. 3.5 Ma and migrated to Eurasia via the Levant. While remaining poorly known, M. rumanus apparently played a significant role in the dispersal of mammoths to Eurasia, and any additional information on that species might elucidate problems of the earlier stages of mammoth evolution in Africa and their subsequent dispersal.

Other Baker tributaries in the vicinity include Eureka, Thanksgiving, and Gold Run. Geography Pioneer Creek heads against the Baker-Minook divide, flows around the head of the Eureka, and then, at a distance of , flows parallel to the main course of that creek. After traversing , it joins Eureka Creek and they are said to lose themselves on Baker Flats. Pioneer Creek never carries less than three or four sluice-heads of water, and its gradient along its lower course is about per mile. The valley's northwest side has a gentle slope running back for about a mile, and the southeast side is of almost precipitous steepness. On the gentle slope of the northwest side there are perceptibly flatter places or benches, but only one of these is persistent. This bench is traceable along Pioneer Creek for over . Its northeast end is but little above the present level of the creek while its southwest end is about above the creek. Over this bench and covering much of the slope below is a deposit of auriferous gravel left by the creek as it moved to the southeast. The different diggings upon it are known as \\"bars\\". Five small tributaries, Doric, Boothby, Seattle Junior, Skookum, and Joe Bush, flow across this bench at right angles to the course of Pioneer Creek. Near the upper end of the bench at Joe Bush Creek, prospecting holes showed a well-defined old stream channel. Geology The bed rock is schistose grit with interbedded slates and thin beds of quartzite. The grits sometimes become very carbonaceous, particularly on Doric Creek. There is some quartz in small veins and stringers, and on Doric Creek at places there is considerable pyrite distributed through the rocks. The pyrite is often oxidized, so that only small holes lined with iron rust indicate its former presence. On Doric Creek inclusions of a carbonaceous substance the size of a walnut occur with small quartz seams. History Like many other Alaskan' creeks Pioneer Creek was staked in the early 20th century, and then each man waited for his neighbor to do the hard work necessary to locate the pay streak, if there \\\\was one. Meanwhile, the claims lapsed and were then restaked by other parties, and pay was discovered on What Cheer Bar in 1902. After this discovery pay was found on Doric Creek and at several other points along the bench. The production of Pioneer Creek Valley to the end of the summer of 1904 was about $35,800.

He is an expert on kosher species of birds.\\"A Quacky Visitor at the OU\\", Jewish Action (Winter 2013) He is the director of the Biblical Ornithological Society. Kosher bird species The Bible gives a list of non-kosher birds in and . (See kosher animals for full article). However, today it is not clear which species the Bible had in mind. People who keep kosher rely on several rules listed in the Talmud and on tradition to know which birds may be consumed. Jewish law also dictates that birds that interbreed can be considered members of the same species. This is one of the reasons why turkeys, which were unknown in the Middle East in ancient time, are considered kosher by many Jewish groups. Over the past decade, Chaim Loike has interviewed Jewish elders from far-flung communities, such as Afghanistan, to document their traditions regarding kosher bird species. He has also extensively bred and raised many exotic birds in order to determine their kosher status. Loike worked extensively on different species of quails in order to determine if they are kosher, and his research was used by Rabbi Yisroel Belsky as the basis for his ruling on the matter.The Daf Hakashrus: A Monthly Newsletter for the OU Rabbinic Field Representative, Vol. 13, No. 7 (April 2005) p.19 He has also written on the subject of partridges, ruling that several different species should follow the precedent set by the chukar partridge and be considered kosher.\\"Crested-Wood Partridge Not Accepted as a Kosher Partridge\\", Behind the Union Symbol (Winter 2009) p.18 In another instance, he raised runner ducks. Rabbi Loike lectures extensively for the Orthodox Union on the subject, often bringing live birds for the presentations.Durbach, Elaine, \\"Kosher Food Seminar is for the Birds - and Bugs\\" in New Jersey Jewish News May 18, 2011. He is also a lecturer at Touro College. Philby's Partridge In 2013, Loike launched an online campaign to fund an investigation into the kosher status of Philby's partridge. He aimed to raise a captive population of this endangered species, indigenous to Northern Yemen. By proving the birds to be kosher, Loike hoped to create a market for them and thus stave off their extinction.

After winning her only race as a two-year-old she developed into one of the best fillies in Europe in 1980, winning the Cheshire Oaks, Ribblesdale Stakes, Irish Oaks, Yorkshire Oaks and Park Hill Stakes. In the following year she failed to win but ran creditably when finishing second to Ardross in the Ascot Gold Cup. As a five-year-old she was campaigned in the United States with little success before being retired to stud. She is the grand-dam of the Kentucky Derby winner Thunder Gulch. Background Shoot A Line was a \\"lengthy, lightly-made\\" bay filly with a white star and white socks on her hind legs bred by her owner Arthur Budgett. She was not a particularly attractive filly, being described by Timeform as resembling \\"a bag of bones\\", during the summer of her three-year-old season. Her dam, Death Ray, was a half-sister to the July Cup winner Daylight Robbery and produced several other winners including More Light, a colt who won the Gordon Stakes and the Jockey Club Stakes. Shoot A Line's sire High Line was a specialist stayer who won three runnings of the Jockey Club Cup before becoming a very successful breeding stallion whose other progeny included Master Willie. The filly was sent into training with Dick Hern at West Ilsley. She was part of a very strong generation of fillies at West Ilsley, which also included Bireme and the partially sighted The Dancer (May Hill Stakes). Racing career=1979: two-year-old season Shoot A Line made her racecourse debut in the Radley Stakes at Newbury Racecourse in October. She showed \\"immense promise\\" in winning the race by five lengths from her stable companion Dancing Shadow. 1980: three-year-old season Shoot A Line began her second season in the Group Three Cheshire Oaks in May. She looked less than fully fit and appeared to be unsuited by the tight track, but won by five lengths from the Irish filly Little Bonny. On 7 June Shoot A Line contested the 202nd running of the Oaks Stakes at Epsom Downs Racecourse, in which she was ridden by Tony Murray, as the stable jockey, Willie Carson, had elected to ride Bireme. The filly misbehaved before the start and ran very poorly in the race, finishing unplaced behind Bireme, Vielle and The Dancer. Less than two weeks later, the filly started 5/2 joint-favourite for the Group Two Ribbledale Stakes at Royal Ascot. Ridden by Willie Carson, she led for most of the race and drew away from her opponents in the straight to win by five length from North Forland. Bireme was injured in June, and Shoot A Line took her stable companion's place in the Irish Oaks at the Curragh Racecourse in July. Carson sent the filly into the lead from the start and she turned back the challenges of the Irish fillies Little Bonny and Racquette in the straight to win by two and a half lengths. On 19 August she was sent to York Racecourse for the Group One Yorkshire Oaks in which she was matched against Vielle, who, since finishing second in the Oaks, had won the Lancashire Oaks and the Nassau Stakes. Ridden by Lester Piggott, she started at 13/8, while the much more impressive-looking Vielle was made the odds-on favourite. Shoot A Line led from the start as usual before increasing the pace in the straight. Vielle emerged with a strong challenge two furlongs from the finish, but Shoot A Line held off the challenge of the favourite to win by one and a half lengths. On her final appearance of the year, the filly returned to Yorkshire for the Park Hill Stakes over fourteen and a half furlongs at Doncaster Racecourse on 11 September. Ridden by Carson, she started at odds of 1/2 and was never in any danger of defeat, leading from the start and winning very easily by eight lengths from Broomstick Corner. 1981: four-year-old season In 1981 in Europe, there were few opportunities for older female horses to compete against their own sex in major races, with the Princess Royal Stakes being the only British Group race for fillies open to female horses over the age of three. Shoot A Line was therefore required to race against male opposition when she returned as a four-year-old in 1981. She made a very disappointing seasonal debut in the John Porter Stakes at Newbury Racecourse in April, injuring herself in the starting stalls and being pulled-up in a race won by Pelerin. At Royal Ascot in June, Shoot A Line was one of three horses to oppose the outstanding stayer Ardross in the Ascot Gold Cup over two and a half miles. She was the only one of Ardross's opponents to be given any chance against him, starting the 7/2 second favourite. Ridden by Carson, she made a determined challenge in the straight but was never able to get on terms with the favourite and finished second, beaten a length. The filly was then sent to Germany for the Grosser Preis von Berlin, but ran very poorly, finishing seventh of the eight runners behind French-trained Lydian. At Ayr Racecourse on 16 September, she ran in the Listed Doonside Cup over eleven furlongs. She led for most of the race but was outpaced in the closing stages and was beaten a length by the colt Castle Keep. 1982: five-year-old season In 1982, Shoot A Line was bought by Peter Brant and sent to race in the United States where she was trained by LeRoy Jolley. On her American debut she won an allowance race at Gulfstream Park in April, but she finished no better than fourth in her remaining five races. Assessment In 1980, Shoot A Line was given a rating of 127 by the independent Timeform organisation, equal with Bireme and Mrs Penny and four pounds below the top-rated three-year-old filly Detroit. In the official International Classification she was rated equal with Mrs Penny as the best British-trained three-year-old filly, two pounds below the French-trained Detroit. She was rated 117 by Timeform in 1981. Stud record Shoot A line was retired to stud to become a broodmare for her owner's stud. She produced at least nine foals, all of them fillies, between 1984 and 2000. Few of them made any impact as racehorses, but her 1987 foal Line of Thunder became a very successful broodmare, producing several winners including the Kentucky Derby winner Thunder Gulch. Shoot A Line's foals: *Head of Victory (bay filly, foaled in 1984, sired by Mr. Prospector) ‚Äì placed twice from 7 starts in Britain 1986‚Äì87 *Pamusi (bay filly, 1985, by Mr. Prospector), failed to win in two races *Shooting Line (bay filly, 1986, by Roberto), won one race *Line of Thunder (bay filly, 1987, by Storm Bird), won three races, dam of Thunder Gulch. *Somnifere (chestnut filly, 1990, by Nijinsky), failed to win in four races *The Skeat (bay filly, 1991, by Nureyev), failed to win in three race *Chantereine (chestnut filly, 1994, by Trempolino), failed to win in four races *An Mosey (bay filly, 1999, by Royal Academy), unraced *Eadaoin (filly, 2000, by King of Kings), unraced Pedigree *Shoot A Line was inbred 4 x 4 to Nearco, meaning that this stallion appears twice in the fourth generation of her pedigree.

Vacancy The by-election was caused by the resignation of the sitting Conservative MP, Gerard Wallop. He resigned suddenly on 14 February 1934. He had been MP here since holding the seat in 1929. Election History Basingstoke had been won by the Conservatives at every election since 1885 apart from 1923 when the Liberals won. The result at the last General election was as follows; Candidates *The local Conservatives selected 34-year-old Henry Drummond-Wolff as candidate to defend the seat.

On 27 February they selected 25-year-old John Foot as candidate. He was a son of the Liberal MP Isaac Foot and a younger brother of the Liberal MP Dingle Foot. He was educated at Forres School, Swanage and then Bembridge School on the Isle of Wight. He went on to read jurisprudence at Balliol College, Oxford, where he was President of the Oxford Union in 1931, following in the steps of his elder brother Dingle (1928). After graduation he joined the family law firm. He was standing for parliament for the first time. *The local Labour party selected year-old James William Barker as candidate. Campaign Polling Day was set for 19 April 1934, some two months after the vacancy first became known. Nominations closed on 9 April 1934. Foreign Affairs dominated the campaign, particularly the Conservative dominated National Government's isolationist approach. The Conservative campaign leaned heavily on the support of their National Government partners. On 5 April, leading Liberal National MP, Ernest Brown, the Minister for Mines, spoke in support of Drummond Wolff.Aberdeen Journal, 6 Apr 1934 Liberal National Leader Sir John Simon, the Foreign Secretary sent a public letter of support to the Conservative candidate which called on Liberals to vote Conservative.Dundee Courier, 16 Apr 1934 On the Eve of poll, the Liberal Party Leader, Sir Herbert Samuel visited the constituency and spoke at a public meeting in support of Foot.Western Morning News, 19 Apr 1934 Result Despite a large swing against the National Government, the Conservative managed to hold onto the seat. Aftermath A Peace Ballot was launched in 1934 to ascertain public support for the League of Nations and collective security. As a result just before the 1935 general election, the National Government agreed to the Liberal policy of working through the League of Nations.

Career  Aagre is one of the leading saxophonists of Norway, playing tenor and soprano saxophone with an individual sound that builds on inspirations by such saxophonists as Dave Liebman and Wayne Shorter. She has studied saxophone and composition in Oslo, Birmingham, London, New York and Buenos Aires. Aagre was awarded the Norwegian Government scholarship for the year 2005/2006. Aagre released her first album Katalyze in 2004 with Fr√∏y Aagre Offbeat, including Andreas Ulvo, Freddy Augdal and Roger Williamsen, and attracted notice throughout Europe, and soon found herself invited to perform at major festivals in Europe, North America and India. There after followed Countryside (2006) and Cycle of Silence (2010) both receiving great reviews. When attending the Banff Jazz Workshop in Canada, in 2005, Aagre started a collaboration with the Brisbane band Misinterprotato (now known as Trichotomy). This led to touring with the trio, including an appearance at Wangaratta Jazz Festival in 2009. Here is the liner notes for the latest album Fr√∏y Aagre Electric: The name Fr√∏y Aagre Electric refers to the new setup with Fender Rhodes Electric Piano, effects and bass synth as opposed to the previous setup of merely acoustic instruments. This album is divided into two parts; following is a description of part 1, the main section of the album (track 1‚Äì6). Part 2 is the three duo pieces at the end (track 7‚Äì9). Whilst the previous album, \\"Cycle of Silence\\" explored the use of silence in music, this album goes in the opposite direction, exploring energy, vitality, rhythmic drive and musical playfulness. The focus during the compositional process, the rehearsal period, recording session and the mixing process was to create musical momentum; by making the music constantly move and flow between different sections and contrasting moods, creating tension and relief by using various instrumentations, electronic sounds and dynamics. The focus during the recording session itself was to capture the electric live energy in the studio. Whereas previous albums have been acoustic, melodic jazz with occasional hints of classical and world music, my change of musical preferences and the entry of electronic sounds have added influence from pop and electronica to the music. This album is groundbreaking and a game changer for me. Entering the world of electronic sounds has broadened my musical horizon and opened doors to new genres to mix and play with as part of my musical pallet, yet not being totally devoted to any. I strive to maintain a balance between spontaneity and structure, bridging the gap between the composed and the improvised by making it part of the same overall form. As always I care a lot about the melodies, but this time in combination with a stronger focus on rhythmic drive. Choosing the right musicians for your music is important to make your music blossom and Andreas and Jonas have contributed tremendously to the musical expression of this album. I would also like to mention the wonderful guests who has lifted the music further and broadened the range of sounds. The album itself is a journey, like snapshots of my life; \\"Berlin\\", composed in this thrilling city, one of my favourites in Europe and \\"City Lights\\" inspired by the urban pulse and uplifting energy of big capital cities. ‚ÄúCastle in the Air‚Äù, is written to Andreas Ulvo, my musical soul mate over the last 10 years, and was a tune that created spontaneous energetic moments in the recording studio. ‚ÄúBirds, Bees and Forest Trees‚Äù is inspired by a particularly beautiful walk in the woods, \\"Entanglement\\" is about the close relationships in life and the playful \\"African Wig\\", with African music influences recalls moments from my African tour. The album ends in quiet contemplation with three duo pieces, of which Youth and Loss 77 is heavily influenced in the aftermath of the national tragedy of 22 July 2011. This is the inspiration behind the compositions, but I hope you make the music your own and connect it to your life and experiences.

The Museum exhibits include regional LGBTQ history along with items of national and international scope as well. The Tucson Gay Museum collaborates under pre-existing agreements with numerous archives and museums worldwide collecting LGBTQ History, LGBTQ Memories and LGBTQ Collections. History The Tucson Gay Lesbian Bisexual Transgender Queer LGBT LGBTQ Museum began on June 6, 1967 as an archiving project when a few local neighborhood school age boys came together to collect historical items, take photographs, make sound recordings in and around their community of LGBTQ events and subjects along with other history. As time when along the group began collecting LGBTQ historical related exhibit items from around Arizona, including Phoenix and others areas of the United States. The Tucson Gay LGBT LGBTQ Queer Museum still remains an all-volunteer effort. Its founding members used their own film loaded cameras and many developed their own film while collecting, photographing, filming, and archiving memorabilia to create historical exhibits for an almost continual 50 year time period. Over the years since those legendary historical days of the 1960s in the United States, the project gained broader focuses at times including the production of LGBTQ related historical movie documentaries, an LGBTQ related TV Show, sponsoring LGBTQ events, providing educational exhibits at events, working with local LGBTQ organizations, fielding LGBTQ historical documentary crews, and working with national and international LGBTQ historical groups on LGBTQ historical preservation.

Hollow Log is one of the best known features of Balch County Park. Balch Park is a county park in the southern Sierra Nevada mountains of California that features a grove of Giant Sequoia trees. It also has archaeological sites relating to the early Native Americans of the area, and to the late 19th- and early 20th-century logging industry that cut down many of the big trees in the area. Description Balch Park is known for its grove of Giant Sequoia trees that rivals the better known groves of nearby Sequoia National Park and Kings Canyon National Park. Two of the more impressive trees in the park are the Lady Alice Alice tree, and the Allen Russell Tree, which is the 33rd largest Sequoia in the world and the largest tree in Balch Park. There is also the Hollow Log, which is a fallen Giant Sequoia that was formerly used as a dwelling and a warehouse. Just outside the park is the Genesis Tree, the 7th largest tree in the world, and the Adam Tree, which is the 20th largest tree. The area once supported several lumber mills, and even though many of the larger trees in the surrounding forest were logged, the trees at Balch Park were spared due to the efforts of conservation minded individuals, some of whom hoped to save the trees for future generations, and some of whom looked to profit from the trees as tourist attractions. A small museum near the entrance to the park has exhibits dedicated to the logging history of the area, and a nature trail that begins at the museum winds through several of the larger trees. Three large ponds within the park are popular fishing destinations, and are among some of the better known attractions in the area. One of these ponds, the Hedrick pond near the north edge of the park, was previously associated with an old lumber mill, and two others nearer the museum were dammed by the park authority in 1958 and made to resemble mill ponds. The Park also has some unique archaeological sites including the \\"Indian Bathtubs\\", which are large basins in the granite bedrock near the ponds. These features have a controversial origin. Because they generally are closely associated with Indian bedrock mortar holes that are known to be man- made, some argue a man-made origin for the bathtubs also, whereas others insist that the bathtubs are natural features resulting from complex erosion processes. Some have even suggested that the bathtubs were created by alien visitors from outer space. History John J. Doyle in the mid-1880s acquired a parcel in the area that corresponds today to Balch Park. Doyle established a resort that he called \\"Summer Home\\", with the intent of selling up to 125 lots to be developed with cabins. However, the lot sales never took place, and Doyle sold out in 1906 to the Mt. Whitney Power Company, which had plans to log the site for lumber to build a flume to carry water to a proposed power plant project. Once again no development or logging took place, and the Mt. Whitney company sold the project, and with it the land and trees, in 1923 to the San Joaquin Light and Power Company. The president of San Joaquin Light and Power, Allan C. Balch, eventually decided against logging the trees and donated the property in 1930 to Tulare County for a park to be named after him and his wife. After the Mountain Home State Demonstration Forest was set up in 1946, there was an attempt to transfer the park to State control. However, this was prevented by the terms of the original donation, and Balch Park today remains under control of Tulare County.

White served four consecutive terms as the Prosecuting Attorney for Hampshire County (1912‚Äì1928), and served one term in the West Virginia Senate (1930‚Äì1934) representing the state's Fifteenth Senatorial District in the 40th and 41st Sessions of the West Virginia Legislature. During the 1933 legislative year, White served as the floor leader for the Democratic Party members of the West Virginia Senate. White was born in Romney, West Virginia in 1876 to Hampshire County Clerk of Court Christian Streit White (1839‚Äì1917) and his second wife Catharine Steele White (1837‚Äì1869) and was the grandson of Hampshire County Clerk of Court John Baker White (1794‚Äì1862). White was educated at Potomac Academy and began his career in public service at the age of 16 as Deputy Clerk of Court in his father's law office. He studied jurisprudence at the West Virginia University College of Law graduating in 1899. He began practicing law in Romney and was elected Prosecuting Attorney of Hampshire County in 1912. White was elected to the position four times, and served terms from 1912 to 1928. In addition, he served as the Commissioner of School Lands and as one of the Chancery Commissioners for Hampshire County. White was elected to represent the Fifteenth Senatorial District in the West Virginia Senate in 1930 and served in the senate until 1934. In 1933, White was chairman of the senate's Judiciary Committee and he was also appointed to two special committees: one on economy and efficiency to study state and municipal government spending, and another to investigate the road commission's awarding of a contract for gasoline, oil, and grease to the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey over the Elk Refining Company. Following a prolonged illness, White died in Romney in 1935 at the age of 59. Early life and education Robert White was born on May 28, 1876 in Romney, West Virginia. He was the second child of Hampshire County Clerk of Court Christian Streit White (1839‚Äì1917) and his second wife Catharine Steele White (1837‚Äì1869), and the third eldest of his father's five children. White was a grandson of Hampshire County Clerk of Court John Baker White (1794‚Äì1862) and a great-grandson of the prominent Virginia judge Robert White (1759‚Äì1831). His uncle Robert White (1833-1915) served as Attorney General of West Virginia and his brother John Baker White (1868‚Äì1944) was a military officer and later served as a Charleston city councilman and president of the West Virginia Board of Control. White received his early education in the public schools of Romney, and attended Romney's Potomac Academy. At the age of 16, he began his career in public service serving as the Deputy Clerk of Court in the office of his father, Christian Streit White, who was then serving as Clerk of Court for Hampshire County. In 1894, White graduated from Potomac Academy at the age of 18. Two years later, he began studying jurisprudence at the West Virginia University College of Law in Morgantown. He graduated from the West Virginia University College of Law in 1899, earning a Bachelor of Laws degree. White cast his first vote for Democratic Party presidential nominee William Jennings Bryan in the United States presidential election of 1900.  Law career  From 1903 until 1912, White was associated with his father Christian Streit White (pictured) in a law practice in Romney, West Virginia. Following his graduation in 1899 from West Virginia University, White returned to Romney and established a law practice. In 1903, he became associated with his father Christian Streit White in a law practice, following the conclusion of his father's term as Hampshire County Clerk of Court. White continued to practice law with his father until 1912, when he was elected to his first term as prosecuting attorney for Hampshire County.  Political career  Before the age of 21, White represented Hampshire County as a delegate to a West Virginia Democratic Party state convention. In 1912, he was first elected to serve as the prosecuting attorney for Hampshire County and was re-elected to the position four times, serving four, four-year terms from 1912 to 1928. While serving in this position, White was a strong proponent of the Good Roads Movement and under his leadership, the first concrete bridge was constructed in Hampshire County by the County Court. Between 1917 and 1922, in addition to serving as the county's prosecuting attorney, White served as the commissioner of school lands and as one of the chancery commissioners for Hampshire County, along with Joshua Soule Zimmerman and James Sloan Kuykendall.  West Virginia Senate  In 1930, White was elected to serve in the West Virginia Senate representing the state's Fifteenth Senatorial District. He served in the 40th and 41st Sessions of the West Virginia Legislature and completed his term in 1934. During the 1932 legislative year, the West Virginia Senate was led by the Republican Party majority. The following legislative year in 1933, White served as the floor leader for the West Virginia Senate's Democratic Party members. The West Virginia Senate's majority had shifted to the Democrats in 1933, and in January 1933, White was selected by A. G. Mathews, President of the West Virginia Senate, as chairman of the senate's Judiciary Committee. In this position, White introduced twelve bills in 1933 to correct errors and omissions in existing statutes. Also in the 1933 legislative year, White served as a member on the Finance; Roads and Navigation; Counties, Municipal Corporations; Rules; Medicine and Sanitation; Education; Privileges and Elections; and Redistricting committees. In the same year White was also appointed as a member on two special senate committees. On January 19, 1933, White sponsored a resolution for the creation of a special committee on economy and efficiency to study state and municipal government spending. The committee was charged with making investigations, developing recommendations, and drafting bills to empower its recommendations. It was further permitted to summon witnesses, examine records, and to investigate all state and local government organizations to recommend further mechanisms to affect efficiency and economy. White was appointed to the committee, which consisted of the speaker of the House of Delegates, the president of the West Virginia Senate, and two members from each house. In February 1933, White was one of four senate Democrats appointed to serve on a special committee to investigate the road commission's awarding of a contract for gasoline, oil, and grease to the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey over the Elk Refining Company of Charleston. The committee's creation and investigation was in response to the Elk Refining Company's protest of the commission's decision, and the company's advertisement in which it claimed that its contract bid was $10,387.50 lower than that of Standard Oil. The committee not only investigated the commission's decision, but also examined the Elk Refining Company's advertisement. White questioned the advertisement's merit and commented that the committee was \\"entitled to know what the motive behind this advertisement was.\\" \\"If there isn't anything to investigate we shouldn't be here investigating,\\" he concluded. On February 28, 1933, White was a member of a subcommittee which drafted a bill calling for a special state referendum on the repeal of the Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Under the plan, which was submitted by White, West Virginia would register its official stand on the proposed Twenty-first Amendment to end Prohibition in the United States at the federal level. The referendum was to choose a slate of 20 \\"wet\\" and 20 \\"dry\\" candidates for delegates to a state convention, which would present its final vote on the national repeal of Prohibition.  Personal life =Marriage and issue White married Mabel Glasscock Fitch, the only child and daughter of E. H. Fitch and his wife Laura Glasscock Fitch, on January 7, 1903 in Washington, D.C.. Fitch was a native of Vanceburg, Kentucky and she attended Marshall College while her family resided in Huntington. She completed her education in Washington, D.C. White and his wife Mabel had five children: * John Baker White (born February 11, 1904) * Mabel Glasgow White Cornwell (born February 18, 1906), married James Leighton Cornwell on August 25, 1926 in Hampshire County * Elizabeth Steele White (born April 23, 1908) * Roberta Huston White McFarland (born June 18, 1912), married Dr. William Franklin McFarland on June 13, 1936 in New Cumberland * Robert White, Jr. White's wife Mabel was an active member of the Presbyterian Church. While a passenger on a Baltimore and Ohio Railroad South Branch line train, Mabel took ill and died at the Wappocomo home of Garrett Williams Parsons on July 5, 1915. She was interred at Indian Mound Cemetery in Romney.  Later life and death  White never remarried following his wife's death in 1915. In addition to White's church activities, he served as a master of the Masonic Lodge, and was affiliated with the Odd Fellows. Beginning in 1934, White endured 18 months of illness, and on August 14, 1935, his physician Dr. R. W. Dailey reported to the Cumberland Evening Times that he was in critical condition and was unlikely to recover. White succumbed to his illness and died at his residence in Romney on August 15, 1935 at the age of 59 as a result of arteriosclerosis.

It premiered on Showtime on December 15, 2013.  Plot  Having just killed Akbari, Brody (Damian Lewis) steals Akbari's pistol and calmly walks out of the building. He is picked up by the driver who took him there. Brody forces the driver out of the car at gunpoint. He goes to meet Carrie and they drive to a safe house about a hundred miles away. Majid Javadi (Shaun Toub) confirms that Akbari is dead but suggests that Saul (Mandy Patinkin) abandon Carrie and Brody because their capture would increase Javadi's chances of getting Akbari's job. Javadi promises that he would get Carrie out afterwards. Saul refuses and proceeds to organize an extraction involving the military and several helicopters. Dar Adal betrays him and informs Senator Lockhart, who quickly gets the president's agreement to take command of the CIA, even though his time in the job is not for another 11 hours. Lockhart calls off the extraction and gives the safe house's location to Javadi, whose troops go there, albeit with orders to leave Carrie. At the safe house, Carrie tells Brody about her pregnancy and Brody starts to feel confident about his road ahead. Brody and Carrie leave the house when they hear their rescue helicopter, not knowing it is false sound being generated by a loudspeaker. Brody is immediately seized by Iranian military forces and Carrie screams as she is left behind. Brody is given a speedy trial and sentenced to be hanged publicly. Carrie attends, pushing her way through the crowd to reach the chain link fence surrounding the execution zone, having mourned that entire day. She looks on, devastated, then climbs the fence and calls his name loudly so Brody knows she is there as he passes away peacefully. Four months pass. Iran offers the IAEA full access to its nuclear sites in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. Carrie has chosen not to have an abortion because she \\"wanted a part\\" of Brody, who is the father. She tells Quinn that she is afraid of motherhood; however, he encourages her to keep the baby. Lockhart has a meeting with Carrie where he promotes her to station chief in Istanbul. Not only is Istanbul the most prestigious station, Carrie has become the youngest station chief in CIA history. Carrie asks whether, at the upcoming CIA memorial, Brody might be given a star alongside the fallen agents, but Lockhart refuses because Brody was not a CIA employee and the director does not believe that an erstwhile would-be terrorist merits such an honor. Meeting later her sister and father, Carrie tells them she plans to give the baby up but her father offers to adopt the child. Saul was fired after Lockhart took office and went to work in the private sector, paid much more money. He gets an invitation to attend the upcoming CIA memorial. He speaks with Dar Adal and Carrie after seeing them again, and conveys he still prefers the CIA over private industry. Later that night, hours after the memorial, Carrie walks through the CIA's halls, approaches the memorial wall, and furtively draws a star in memory of Brody with a marker pen.  Production  Former series writer Meredith Stiehm rejoined the writing staff to co-write the season finale with showrunner Alex Gansa. The episode was directed by co-executive producer Lesli Linka Glatter. Brody's execution scene was filmed on the final day of shooting for season three. It was shot overnight on location in Rabat, Morocco and had 400 extras playing the Iranian mob. A complete version of the season's finale was leaked on December 13, 2013, almost 48 hours prior to its scheduled air date and became available on numerous internet file sharing platforms.  Reception = Ratings  The episode received a series-high 2.4 million viewers on its original broadcast and cumulative rating of 2.9 million over the two airings that night.  Critical response  The episode received very positive reviews. Scott Collura of IGN gave the season finale a score of 9.4 out of 10, and praised the performances of Claire Danes and Damian Lewis and the writers' decision to kill off the character of Nicholas Brody. Collura wrote, \\"The Star is perhaps one of the saddest hours of TV we've seen in some time, and it's also a reminder that for all the Carrie fatigue that's been going around this season, Claire Danes remains an amazing performer.\\" Although he felt the wrap-up was \\"clunky\\", he continued, \\"but that doesn't really matter. Because when Carrie quietly scrawls that star for Brody on the wall, a star that no one will recognize except her and maybe a few other people, we couldn't ask for a better memorial to the character.\\" Emily VanDerWerff and Sonia Saraiya reviewed the episode for The A.V. Club. VanDerWerff graded the episode an \\"A-\\" and commented that \\"The Star\\" was the strongest episode of the third season. She wrote, \\"Above all, it did the main thing a season finale should do: It made me interested to see what season four looks like.

Ecology and Evolutionary Biology. Web. There are around 40 different species of sea stars that have been affected by this disease. The disease seems to be associated with raised water temperatures in some places, but not others. It starts with the emergence of lesions, followed by body fragmentation and death. In 2014 it was suggested that the disease is associated with a single-stranded DNA virus now known as the sea star-associated densovirus (SSaDV); however, sea star wasting disease is still not fully understood. Symptoms Typically the first symptom of sea star wasting disease is refusal to accept food followed by listlessness for weeks and then white lesions that appear on the surface of the starfish and spread rapidly, followed by decay of tissue surrounding the lesions. Next the animal becomes limp as the water vascular system fails and it is no longer able to maintain its internal hydrostatic balance. The sea star loses its grip on the substrate. The body structure begins to break down, signs of stretching appear between the arms which may twist and fall off, and the animal dies. The arms may continue to crawl around for a while after being shed. Progression of these events can be rapid, leading to death within a few days. A deflated appearance can precede other morphological signs of the disease. All of these symptoms are also associated with ordinary attributes of unhealthy stars and can arise when an individual is stranded too high in the intertidal zone (for example) and simply desiccates. \\"True\\" wasting disease will be present in individuals that are found in suitable habitat, often in the midst of other individuals that might also be affected. The final result is a disintegrated, white, mushy blob, which no longer seems to be a sea star.https://jackiehildering.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/c2a9-2013-jackie- hildering-210130.jpg 1972 plague The 1972 plague was the first notable case of Sea Star Wasting Disease.Meyer, Anna. \\"Will the Sea Stars Ever Be Able to Recover? - Islands' Sounder.\\" Islands' Sounder. N.p., 20 July 2015. Web. 08 Oct. 2015. Scientists noticed a rapidly declining population of common starfish (Asterias rubens) occurring off the east coast of the United States. The symptoms were that the starfish became limp and lost limbs until finally melting into a white mucus like paste. 1978 plague In 1978 large numbers of the predatory starfish Heliaster kubiniji succumbed to a wasting disease in the Gulf of California. At the time it was suspected that high water temperatures were a causal factor. This starfish became locally extinct in some parts of the gulf and some populations had still not recovered by the year 2000. Because this starfish is a top-level predator, its disappearance had profound effects on the ecosystem. In the Channel Islands off the coast of California, ten species of sea star were recorded as being affected as well as three species of sea urchins, two brittle stars and a sea cucumber, all of which experienced large population declines. 2013 - current plagues In July 2013, populations of sea stars declined rapidly on the east coast of the United States between New Jersey and Maine. There had been a great increase in sea star numbers three years earlier, though in 2013 they were dying off. No cause for the mysterious deaths was apparent. On the Pacific coast, a meltdown of sea stars was first found in ochre stars and sunflower stars in Howe Sound, British Columbia. In late August, the disease had also been found stretching from Alaska to the border of Mexico.\\"Sea Star Wasting Syndrome Now Documented on NE Vancouver Island.\\" http://themarinedetective.com/2013/12/21/sea-star- wasting-syndrome-now-documented-on-ne-vancouver-island/ At the beginning of September 2013, a mass die-off of sea stars was reported off the coast of British Columbia. The sea bed was littered with disintegrating sunflower stars (Pycnopodia helianthoides), their detached arms and discs. Another species also suffering mortalities was the morning sun star (Solaster dawsoni), but no cause for the deaths was apparent. If they were caused by infection or toxins, the two species might have affected each other because the diet of each includes sea stars. In spring/summer 2013, reports of sea stars experiencing wasting symptoms came from Vancouver, B.C. and from southern and central California. Observations of symptoms spread throughout California, Washington and southern Canada throughout 2013, but sea star wasting disease did not begin affecting sea stars in the intertidal zone in Oregon until spring 2014. The relatively high resolution of understanding of the pattern of disease spread came from marine scientists working along the coast, but also from citizen scientists visiting the coast and uploading their observations, of where they saw sea stars both with and without disease symptoms, to an online sea star wasting observation log database. Because scientists had been studying sea star populations before the outbreak of sea star wasting disease, there is a good understanding of how the disease affected population sizes and dynamics. A study of the ochre sea star (Pisaster ochraceus) populations from San Diego, California, to southern British Columbia, along with at two locations near Sitka, Alaska, found that population declines were proportionately greater for sea stars in the southern part of the coast than the north; however, population numbers are usually higher at more northern locations, so the number of sea stars that died from wasting disease was often higher at more northern sites. In October 2013, in a marine laboratory seawater tank in California holding various species of sea stars, other species started displaying similar symptoms. The ochre star (Pisaster ochraceus) was the first affected. Most of these developed symptoms, lost arms and died over the course of a week or so. Later the rainbow star (Orthasterias koehleri) developed the disease and died, but the bat star (Patiria miniata) and leather star (Dermasterias imbricata), which were living in the same tank and had been scavenging on the corpses, showed no ill effects. At Natural Bridges State Marine Reserve in California, the ochre star is normally a very common resident on the mussel beds, but by November 2013 it was reported to have completely disappeared. There have been signs of some recovery of ochre sea star populations (Pisaster ochraceus), with higher numbers of juvenile sea stars in the intertidal than had been previously common, especially for northern sites along the Pacific coast. However, the biomass and the function of ochre sea stars in their communities, such as being important predators of mussels, has remained lower than pre-disease levels. Locations Currently, most cases are located on the west coast of North America, affecting sea stars from Baja California to the gulf of Alaska.\\"Pacific Rocky Intertidal Monitoring: Trends and Synthesis.\\" Pacific Rocky Intertidal Monitoring. N.p., n.d. Web. 08 Oct. 2015. Map of Sea Star Wasting Syndrome Locations Causes As of November 2013, no identifiable cause for the disease had been found. Pathogenic bacteria did not seem to be present, and though the plague might be caused by a viral or fungal pathogen, no causal agent had been found. Each episode of plague might have a different cause. Other possible causes of the condition that have been suggested include high sea temperatures, oxygen depletion and low salinity due to freshwater runoff. Research suggests that high water temperatures can be indeed linked to the disease, increasing its incidence and virulence. The disease also seems more prevalent in sheltered waters than in open seas with much wave movement. One result of global warming is higher sea temperatures. There is a wave of unusually warm water along the west coast of the United States, which is where all of the sea stars are dying off. These may impact both on starfish and on echinoderm populations in general, and a ciliate protozoan parasite (Orchitophrya stellarum) of starfish, which eats sperm and effectively emasculates male starfish, thrives at higher temperatures. However, temperature was not related to the initial outbreak of sea star wasting disease at many places along the coast. Unlike with many other wildlife diseases, there was no link between the density of sea stars at a location before disease outbreak and the severity of population decline. Thus, this outbreak has defied prediction using what is typically understood about disease spread. Research in 2014 showed that the cause of the disease is transmissible from one starfish to another and that the disease- causing agent is a microorganism in the virus-size range. The most likely candidate causal agent was found to be the sea star-associated densovirus (SSaDV), which was found to be in greater abundance in diseased starfish than in healthy ones.Netburn, Deborah (November 26, 2014) \\"Scientists find likely culprit behind mysterious sea star deaths\\" Los Angeles Times However, evidence for this virus as the cause of sea star wasting disease is inconclusive.  Treatment  In 2014, Point Defiance Zoo and Aquarium lost more than half of its 369 sea stars, and by September 2015 they numbered fewer than 100. The aquarium treated its affected sea stars with antibiotics in 2014, which proved effective.Glenn, Stacia. \\"Point Defiance loses half its sea stars to a wasting disease.\\" http://www.thenewstribune.com/news/local/article34291203.html Although a mechanism is still unknown, evidence suggests that a single mutation in the elongation factor 1-alpha locus in Pisaster ochraceus may be associated with reduced mortality.Wares, J.

It is commonly known as the gulf sun star, the common sun star or estrella de mar de golfo and it occurs in the intertidal zone of the Pacific coast of California, Mexico and Nicaragua. Description Juvenile gulf sun stars that have recently undergone metamorphosis have five arms, but more arms grow as the animals get bigger and adults have nineteen to twenty five arms. Large individuals are a mauve colour with black and green blotching and banding while juveniles are a darker colour. It typically has a diameter of about . Distribution The gulf sun star is native to the eastern Pacific Ocean and its range extends from Cape Mendocino in California to Nicaragua. Biology The gulf sea star is a predator and feeds on anything edible it can find including barnacles, bivalve molluscs, gastropod molluscs, sea anemones, chitons, sea cucumbers and crabs. Sea stars in this genus have planktonic feeding larvae that develop for many weeks before recruitment . In 1978, starfish wasting disease devastated the population of this sea star in the Gulf of California. Previous to that it was very common on rocks and under boulders in the lower and middle intertidal zone, with a density of up to one individual per square metre. The population decline was associated with higher than normal water temperatures and the changes brought about by an El Ni√±o event. The sea star almost became extinct in the gulf and had still not recovered in many parts by the year 2000. Because this sea star is a top-level predator, its virtual disappearance was expected to have profound effects on the ecosystem. However, the predatory rock snail Morula ferruginosa increased in abundance and kept the barnacles on which the sea star had previously fed under control, and the ecosystem in balance.

Born in Falkland, Fife, he was the son of a Church of Scotland Minister. He entered the University of St Andrews but left without graduating, moving to London in about 1792. He became a reporter for the Morning Chronicle rising to be the editor. In 1803 he left journalism and became a law student at the Inner Temple in 1803, and was called to the bar in 1808. Following his marriage to Euphemia Inglis, daughter of an East India Company director in 1813, he pursued a legal career in India. In 1817 he became Advocate-General of Bengal. He returned to England in 1823 due to illness. He resumed his legal practice from his home in Russell Square, London, and became a serjeant-at-law in 1824 and a king's serjeant in 1832.

Curriculum  The school provides a seven-year apprenticeship curriculum in wizardry. Faculty and students represent a wide variety of faiths, including Pagan, Christian, Jewish, Buddhist, Hindu, and Muslim. The curriculum begins with simple lessons, and increases in complexity as students progress. More than 450 classes are offered in 16 color-coded departments. These are: Wizardry (indigo), Nature Studies (silver), Magickal Practice (gold), Psychic Arts (aqua), Healing (blue), Wortcunning/Herbalism (green), Divination (yellow), Performance Magics (orange), Alchemy & Magickal Sciences (red), Lifeways (pink), Beast Mastery (brown), Cosmology (violet), Mathemagicks (clear), Ceremonial Magic (white), Lore (grey), and Dark Arts (black). Although some classes address mythology and comparative religion, the school's grimoire (textbook of magic), Companion for the Apprentice Wizard, and the school's philosophy focus on magic rather than spirituality. The program was partially inspired by the fictitious \\"Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry\\" from the Harry Potter novels by J. K. RowlingBonewits, Isaac (2005) The Pagan Man: Priests, Warriors, Hunters, and Drummers (Citadel) , , p. 84 and, like Hogwarts, the Grey School hosts four youth houses: Salamanders, Undines, Sylphs, and Gnomes, that are associated with the Elements Fire, Water, Air, and Earth. Likewise, there are four equivalent Lodges for adults: Flames, Waters, Winds, and Stones. Houses and Lodges are moderated by faculty Heads and student Prefects. Despite this resonance with a fictional school, the Grey School of Wizardry is \\"an entirely serious project\\"; it is an institution for educational enrichment with offerings for children, as well as ongoing educational opportunities for adults. The Grey School provides an interactive social environment, with clubs, merits, challenges, awards, a quarterly student-run school magazine (‚ÄúGrey Matters‚Äù), several week-long summer camps (‚ÄúConclaves‚Äù) around the US and overseas, and a virtual school which offers home schooling and a G.E.D. program.Cusack, Carole M. (2010) Invented Religions: Imagination, Fiction and Faith (Farnham, Surrey: Ashgate), 75. The virtual school was founded primarily to provide an education stream for modern Pagans and their children that is Pagan-focused.Possamai, Adam (2012) Handbook of Hyper-Real Religions, (Boston: Brill). According to Isaac Bonewits, \\"The Grimoire collects in one book a library of wisdom about ceremonial native and Earth-centered magic, Paleo- and Neopagan religions, the obligations of the wise to protect the defenseless, great wizards and witches of the past and present, and more.\\" Bonewits also asserts that the school presents an opportunity for males who are unsatisfied by the teachings of the modern Wicca movement.

The design plans are sold by the 3.7 Class Owners Association and they are built by a mix of professionals and home built by amateurs. The 3.7 Class is recognised by Yachting New Zealand as a national class and yachts are sailed in New Zealand, Australia and Great Britain. Full sets of plans have been sold worldwide to a number of individuals with greatest numbers in Germany, Japan, USA, South Korea, Poland, France, Belgium. Design Farr 3.7 Nationals 2007 Farr 3.7 Nationals 2010 Farr 3.7 Takapuna The 3.7 Class is sailed in two versions; the 3.7 Class and 3.7 Class Turbo version. The standard 3.7 Class is used for class racing. A turbo version provides option to additionally fit a prod and gennaker. The 3.7 Class use a fully battened mainsail of approximately 8.8m^2 on a carbon mast. The sail plan is closely controlled by the class rules and the hull form is very closely controlled by the rules and measured on a jig. The mast, rigging, centreboard and rudder are only loosely controlled. Most hulls are made from plywood, but a number of sandwich composite hulls exist. To date no composite hull has ever won the New Zealand National Championship and plywood boats over 30 years old are routinely winning against brand new boats. The 3.7 Class is usually raced with crews of 50 kg up to 90 kg. The most competitive sailors seem to be in the 60 kg to 80 kg region. Sailors range in age from 16 up to 67 years (and counting) with male and female categories as well as veteran, grand veteran and great grand veteran ages categories. The yachts carry corrector weights to bring them to 50 kg and they are a skiff design that aquaplanes both upwind and downwind except in very light conditions. The sailor trapezes from the side of the yacht while steering and trimming with each hand. The yachts are relatively small and can pitch pole end over end at high speed and are difficult to control in over 20 knots of wind. Youngsters training to sail larger skiffs often use the class as a training ground for several seasons while they are growing heavier, but most sailors are lighter weight individuals. Performance The class has a register of boats in New Zealand, Australia and Great Britain. New Zealand has national champions recognised by Yachting New Zealand (formerly NZYF) dating back to 1974. These yachts will plane upwind and downwind in a breeze of 12 knots or more. In 8 knots they will plane easily on reaches but are sailed in a displacement mode upwind and downwind. In strong winds of 25 knots or more they are difficult to sail and extremely exciting, with numerous capsizes suiting summer venues with warm water. The yachts sail best upwind if they are allowed to point a little lower than the theoretical maximum and this gives much better boat speed so that the VMG (Velocity made good) is maximized.

It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Swindon, the archdeaconry of Malmesbury, and the diocese of Bristol. Its benefice is united with those of St Aldhelm, Swindon, St Luke, Swindon, and St Saviour, Swindon, to form the benefice of Swindon New Town. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. History St Mark's was built to serve workers of the Great Western Railway, whose Swindon Works were nearby. George Henry Gibbs, the head of the firm of Anthony Gibbs and Sons, died in 1842, and bequeathed ¬£500 towards building a church and a school in the town. In February 1843, the railway company appealed for contributions from the public, and a total of ¬£6,000 (equivalent to ¬£ in ) was raised to build the church. The church was designed by George Gilbert Scott and William Moffatt, and built between 1843 and 1845. It was dedicated to St Mark on 25 April 1845, St Mark's Day. In 1897 Temple Moore added a north vestry. The parish is within the Anglo-Catholic tradition of the Church of England, and therefore rejects the ordination of women as priests and bishop. It has passed Resolutions A and B of the Priests (Ordination of Women) Measure 1993 (meaning women cannot preside at Mass at the church), and it receives Alternative Episcopal Oversight from the Bishop of Ebbsfleet (currently Jonathan Goodall SSC). Architecture=Exterior The church is constructed in limestone with roofs of tiles and lead. Its plan consists of a five-bay nave with a clerestory, a north aisle and a south aisle with a three- bay chapel, a south porch, a three-bay chancel with a south chapel and a north vestry, and a north steeple opposite the porch. It is in Decorated Gothic style. The tower is in four stages, and has a north door, angle buttresses, and two-light louvred bell openings. It is surmounted by a crocketted spire with lucarnes rising to . At the west end of the nave is a doorway and a window with five lights containing curvilinear tracery. Along the sides of the aisles are two-light windows with tracery in varying styles. The east window in the chancel has three lights. Interior Inside the church, the arcades are carried on quatrefoil piers. The nave has a hammerbeam roof, and the roof of the chancel is barrel vaulted. The stained glass includes windows by Kempe. The pipe organ was built in 1922 by Jardine of Manchester. It was rebuilt in 1961 by Percy Daniel of Clevedon. In 1973 the organ was destroyed by fire and Persy Daniel replaced it with a three-manual organ moved from a redundant church in the north of England. There is a ring of eight bells. Six of these were cast in 1904 by Llewellins and James, and the other two in 1927 by Mears and Stainbank of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry. Musical tradition St Mark's has a long tradition of performing choral music in the style of an English cathedral. The choir sings at the weekly Parish Mass and at other services, has a repertoire of over 30 masses, and has recorded two CDs. In 1944 Benjamin Britten composed his Festival Te Deum for the centenary of the church, where it was first performed on 24 April 1945. While Mr. Britten attended the rehearsal, earlier in the day, he declined to attend the performance due to the poor quality of the performers.

In addition to the template-based approach, the GeNMR webserver also offers an ab initio protein folding mode that starts folding from an extended structure. The GeNMR web server produces an ensemble of PDB coordinates within a period ranging from 20 minutes to 4 hours, depending on protein size, server load, quality and type of experimental information, and selected protocol options. GeNMR webserver is composed of two parts, a front-end web-interface (written in Perl and HTML) and a back-end consisting of eight different alignment, structure generation and structure optimization programs along with three local databases. Input GeNMR accepts and processes backbone and side chain 1H, 13C or 15N chemical shift data of almost any combination (HA only, HN only, HA+HN only, HA+HN+sidechain H, CA only, CA+CB only, CA+CO only, HA+CA+CB, HN+CA+CB, HN+15N only, HN,+15N+CA, HN+15N+CA+CB, etc.). This allows GeNMR to handle small peptides (where only H shifts are typically measured) to large proteins (where only N or C shifts might be available). The input files must include chemical shift data in NMR-STAR 2.1 format and distance restraints in XPLOR/CNS format (see more info here). The minimum sequence length is 30 residues. Output The output for a typical GeNMR structure calculation consists of a user- defined set of lowest energy PDB coordinates in a simple, downloadable text format. In addition, details about the overall energy score (prior to and following energy minimization) and chemical shift correlations (between the observed and calculated shifts) is provided at the top of the output page. If score failed to decrease below a certain threshold, a warning is printed at the top of the page. Sub-programs A flow chart describing the processing logic used in GeNMR is shown on the right. GeNMR makes use of a number of well-known programs and databases. These include Proteus2 to perform structural modeling, PREDITOR to calculate torsion angles from chemical shifts, PPT-DB for comparative modeling and alignment and CS23D to calculate protein structures from chemical shifts only. GeNMR also uses several well- known external programs, including Rosetta for ab initio folding without NOEs and XPLOR-NIH for NOE-based simulated annealing and refinement. A more complete list of GeNMR sub-programs is listed on the CS23D page. Homology modelling GeNMR uses homology modeling and sequence/structure threading to rapidly generate a first-pass model of the query protein. The use of homology modeling/threading in GeNMR allows a considerable speed-up in its structure calculations since homology models can often be generated and refined in a minute or two. Genetic algorithm GeNMR also makes use of genetic algorithms to allow configurational sampling and structural refinement using non-differentiable scores, such as ShiftX chemical shift scores. GeNMR's genetic algorithm creates a population of initial structures and then uses combinations of mutations, cross-overs, segment swaps and writhe movements to comprehensively sample conformation space. The 25 lowest energy structures are then selected, duplicated and carried to the next round of conformational sampling. Scoring functions The potential functions used in GeNMR are derived from those used in CS23D and Proteus2. The knowledge-based potentials include information on predicted/known secondary structure, radius of gyration, hydrogen bond energies, number of hydrogen bonds, allowed backbone and side chain torsion angles, atom contact radii (bump checks), disulfide bonding information and a modified threading energy based on the Bryant and Lawrence potential. The chemical shift component of the GeNMR potential uses weighted correlation coefficients calculated between the observed and SHIFTX calculated shifts of the structure being refined. Calculation scenarios There are six different kinds of calculation scenarios that GeNMR can currently accommodate. These scenarios include: # chemical shift only‚Äîquery has homologue in database; # chemical shift only‚Äîquery has no homologue in database; # NOE only‚Äîquery has homologue in database; # NOE only‚Äîquery has no homologue in database; # NOE and chemical shift‚Äîquery has homologue in database; # NOE and chemical shift‚Äîquery has no homologue in database.

At about the same time, a supposedly cured psychopathic patient, Ed Baikman (Sean Patrick Flanery), is released. When Lila's husband and his girlfriend are murdered, Ed seems the obvious suspect, especially since the m.o. is identifiably his.

It was directed by Wendey Stanzler and written by Ross Maxwell, and it aired on Fox in the United States on December 5, 2013. The episode is the show's fourth Christmas special, but due to season five being set in the same calendar year as season four, it is a non-canonical episode which purports to be the original season four Christmas special, suppressed by Fox. Commentators reacted negatively to this episode, with many noting its inappropriate content; however, some critics commented positively on Naya Rivera's role as Santana Lopez. Upon airing, the episode was watched by 3.29 million viewers and received an 18-49 rating of 1.1, up from the previous episode, but down from last year's Christmas special. Plot This very special Christmas edition starts when Jane Lynch addresses the audience to explain that the original 2012 Christmas episode of Glee was banned for being too offensive, but fan complaints have convinced Fox to air a severely edited version. In 2012, glee club director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) selects Sam Evans (Chord Overstreet) and Tina Cohen-Chang (Jenna Ushkowitz) to create New Directions' entry for McKinley High's annual tree decorating contest, and Tina becomes obsessed with winning the grand prize, an angel sculpture. Later, football coach Shannon Beiste (Dot-Marie Jones) announces that the school's nativity scene has been defaced, and Principal Figgins (Iqbal Theba) has asked the Christmas Club, which all of New Directions is a part of, to participate of a living nativity. Tina, Marley Rose (Melissa Benoist) and Wade \\"Unique\\" Adams (Alex Newell) compete for the role of Virgin Mary, and invite Kitty Wilde (Becca Tobin) to audition with them, but she refuses. In New York, Rachel Berry (Lea Michele) and Kurt Hummel (Chris Colfer) are visited by Santana Lopez (Naya Rivera), still recovering from her break-up with Brittany Pierce. Rachel gets a job as a Holiday elf at a shopping mall, and convinces Kurt and Santana to join her. However, the mall Santa (M.C. Gainey) turns up drunk and refuses to interact with the impatient crowd. After failing to stall them with a performance of \\"Here Comes Santa Claus\\", Rachel and Kurt convince Santana to dress up as Mrs. Claus and talk with the kids, but her excessive comments only upset the local parents and children. In Lima, Sam and Tina run into Becky Jackson (Lauren Potter), who tries to use mistletoe to force them to kiss her. Cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester hears Tina criticizing how much she lets Becky get away with, and agrees that she's right. After reprimanding Becky for her actions, Sue announces that she'll be judging the tree decorating contest and is planning on ranking the glee club last. Nevertheless, New Directions decorates their trees while singing \\"Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree\\", and Sue is forced to admit that they did a good job. The glee club then gathers in the auditorium, where Marley, Tina and Unique perform \\"Mary's Boy Child\\" for the role of Virgin Mary, and Marley notices Kitty's strange reaction to their performance. Meanwhile, back in New York, Rachel, Kurt and Santana are approached by the drunk Santa's replacement, Cody Tolentino (Bryce Johnson), an attractive man who catches Kurt's attention. Cody convinces the trio to welcome him into the loft so they can bond ahead of their period together, and Cody conducts Rachel, Kurt and Santana in a more familiar drunken and helium-enhanced rendition of \\"Christmas Don't Be Late\\". When Rachel and Santana wake up the following day, they find Kurt bound and gagged and learn that Cody is a con artist who has robbed them. Back in Lima, Will and Beiste announce the cast list for the living nativity, with Marley as Virgin Mary. Kitty scoffs at the decision, and when Marley questions her, Kitty admits she feels she's not worthy of playing Virgin Mary. Marley shares with the rest of the glee club that she feels Kitty deserves the role, and they come up with an scheme to convince her to do it. The next day, Will and Beiste invite Kitty to watch the rehearsals of their living nativity performance, in which Unique replaces Marley as Virgin Mary and performs a highly offensive rendition of \\"Love Child\\". Kitty is appalled and volunteers for the role, only to find out the performance was meant to push her into accepting it. After Sue announces that the glee club has won the decorating contest, Sam and Tina notice that Becky is depressed about losing, especially after Sue criticizes her entry, and decide to give her the angel sculpture in order to cheer her up, in addition to offering her a role in the nativity scene portraying the baby Jesus. In New York, Rachel apologizes for what happened with Cody and announces she got the trio another gig as \\"living mannequins\\" in a clothing store. In Lima, New Directions and Becky gather to perform the living nativity before a group of children. Both sides sing \\"Away in a Manger\\", and the episode ends. Production The episode was in production by November 2013, and included a long Saturday of filming on November 16, 2013. Recurring characters in this episode include McKinley football coach Shannon Beiste (Dot-Marie Jones) and cheerleader Becky Jackson (Lauren Potter). An extended play Christmas recording with six songs from the episode was released digitally on December 3, 2013, two days before the episode airs, and CDs will be sold at Walmart stores only starting December 10, 2013. Titled Glee: The Music, The Christmas Album Volume 4, the songs included are \\"Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree\\", performed by the glee club; Diana Ross & the Supremes' \\"Love Child\\", and \\"Mary's Little Boy Child\\", both performed by Alex Newell, Jenna Ushkowitz and Melissa Benoist; \\"The Chipmunk Song (Christmas Don't Be Late)\\" performed by Lea Michele, Chris Colfer, Naya Rivera plus a new character named Cody; \\"Here Comes Santa Claus (Right Down Santa Claus Lane)\\" sung by Michele, Colfer and Rivera; and \\"Away in a Manger\\" performed by New Directions featuring Tobin, Michele, Colfer and Rivera. Reception=Ratings The episode was watched by 3.29 million American viewers, and received an 18-49 rating/share of 1.1/3.

Jean Bentley of Zap2it gave the episode a mixed review, saying that the episode was used mainly as a way of attaining extra Christmas music sales. She did however comment positively on Santana's role, saying \\"it was worth sitting through the weirdness just to get Santana as an incredibly inappropriate Mrs. Claus. This is why we love her, and why we can't quit \\"Glee\\" no matter how infuriating the other parts are.\\" Esther Gim of BuddyTV also gave the episode a mixed review, but was more negative in her analysis, saying \\"Despite it being fitting for the holiday season, the story that this episode had been locked away for the past year is weak. Why couldn't they just film an episode for this Christmas? Oh yeah, because it's still the last school year. I know, I know -- it's all supposed to be tongue and cheek , and I should take it for what it is. It wasn't completely horrible. More like painful and entertaining at the same time.\\" Marc Snetiker of Entertainment Weekly gave the episode a negative review, saying \\"If you‚Äôve defended the lovably crackers series through the years, I particularly encourage you not to bring up ‚ÄúChristmas Don‚Äôt Be Late,‚Äù in which Rachel, Kurt, and Santana inhale helium and channel Alvin and the Chipmunks in a truly horrifying display.\\" Daniel Sperling of Digital Spy also commented negatively on the episode, noting the episode's tendency to present offensive material, saying \\"Yes, it's deliberately over the top and annoying (we genuinely wanted to harm someone when Rachel, Kurt and Santana sucked helium to do The Chipmunks), there are explicit references to race and religion, plot holes are exposed and it blows raspberries in the face of those who call it insensitive by being wildly insensitive, but Glee's started to do that on an almost weekly basis now.\\" ReferencesExternal links * \\"Previously Unaired Christmas\\" at Fox.com * * Category:2013 American television episodes Category:Christmas television episodes Category:Glee (season 5) episodes ","title":"Previously Unaired Christmas"},{"id":"41110956","text":"The Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 2015, also known as CHOGM 2015 was the 24th meeting of the heads of government of the Commonwealth of Nations. It was held in Malta from 27 to 29 November. Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena handed the position of Commonwealth Chair-in-Office to Maltese prime minister Joseph Muscat at the meeting. Background The summit, which was originally designated to be hosted by Mauritius, was given to Malta when the Mauritian Prime Minister Navin Ramgoolam refused to attend the CHOGM 2013 over the human rights situation prevailing in the host country, Sri Lanka, and thus withdrew as the host of the 2015 summit as protocol had required him to attend the summit in order to personally invite other member states. Venues The summit was held at various venues in Valletta and Gƒßajn Tuffieƒßa's Golden Bay with retreats at Fort St. Angelo in Birgu. The opening ceremony and reception were held at the Mediterranean Conference Centre in Valletta with executive and special sessions held at the Radisson Golden Sands at Golden Beach. Most press conferences were being held at the InterContinental Hotel in St. Julian's. The official theme of the event was \\"The Commonwealth - Adding Global Value\\". A series of civil society conferences in the form of a People's Forum, Women's Forum, Youth Forum and Business Forum were held in the days leading up to the main summit and explored avenues such as building democracy and rule of law, championing small states, creating economic opportunities, empowering youth, inclusive development, human rights, and public service reform among Commonwealth nations. Due to poor weather, the official welcoming ceremony for the royal party occurred at San Anton Palace rather than an open air event at St. George‚Äôs Square as originally planned. Commonwealth Secretary General election The meeting elected a new Commonwealth Secretary-General to succeed Kamalesh Sharma who is retiring April 2016 at the end of his second term, the maximum that can be served. Candidates for the position included Antiguan ambassador to the United States and former high commissioner to the United Kingdom Sir Ronald Sanders; former Attorney General for England and Wales Baroness Patricia Scotland, nominated by her native country of Dominica; and former deputy secretary-general for political affairs Mmasekgoa Masire-Mwamba, nominated by Botswana. Furthermore, Alexander Downer, a former Australian foreign minister and Liberal Party leader who currently serves as Australia's High Commissioner to the United Kingdom had been suggested by British and Australian officials as a possible compromise candidate. Trinidad and Tobago's former planning minister Bhoendradatt Tewarie and Tanzanian foreign minister Bernard Membe were both nominees earlier in the process but withdrew as candidates before the summit began. The election took take place on 27 November. Baroness Patricia Scotland was elected the 6th Commonwealth Secretary-General after two rounds of voting and will take office on 1 April 2016. According to Antigua's foreign minister, Charles ‚ÄúMax‚Äù Fernandez, while the CARICOM countries largely backed Sir Ronald Sanders over Baroness Scotland, African countries favoured Masire-Mwamabe: \\"After the first round, Sir Ron received the fewest votes. For the second round, Antigua & Barbuda put its support behind Baroness Scotland because we felt we‚Äôd be supporting the candidate from another Caribbean country.\\" Fernandez also asserted that Scotland had the support of \\"European\\" and Pacific states. Australia also supported Baroness Scotland after its compromise candidate, Alexander Downer, failed to obtain support. Sanders had been seen as the leading candidate prior to the summit, particularly as the Caribbean Commonwealth countries argued it was their turn to have a secretary-general come from their region, however the failure of the entire CARICOM to support Sanders and a Daily Telegraph article published two days prior to the summit accusing him of corruption may have damaged his campaign. For the first time in Commonwealth history, the Commonwealth Foundation organised a debate between the candidates as part of the Commonwealth People's Forum. This was held on 25 November - two days before the election - in the Maltese House of Representatives. It was chaired by the Speaker of the House, Angelo Farrugia, who took questions from members of civil society present in the chamber. The three declared candidates at the time of debate - Masire-Mwamba, Sir Ronald and Baroness Scotland - were all present. Two representatives of the Maltese parliament also attended and spoke briefly at the end of the debate. Agenda Floor plaque commemorating the walkway of the Commonwealth in front of Auberge de Provence The Commonwealth meeting was held immediately prior to the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris. The Commonwealth conference accordingly held a special session on climate change and global sustainability in an attempt to build political support around the issue prior to the Paris summit; In consideration of small island nations that are being threatened by rising sea levels that accompany climate change, a proposal was discussed to allow these countries to write off their debts in exchange for taking measures to protect the environment. The summit, being held in the aftermath of the November 2015 Paris attacks and growing conflict with ISIL, also addressed terrorism and security issues and the European migrant crisis, as well as economic and trade issues. corruption, The continued criminalization of homosexuality in 40 of the Commonwealth's 53 members was not on the official agenda but was an issue brought up by civil society groups and was also raised by both Prime Minister Joseph Muscat (chairing the occasion) and British Prime Minister David Cameron during their remarks to the Commonwealth leaders. In addition, newly elected Commonwealth Secretary-General Patricia Scotland, Baroness Scotland of Asthal committed herself to using the first two years of her tenure to promote decriminalization of homosexuality in Commonwealth countries that continue to forbid same-sex relationships. Cameron also pledged to increase cooperation among members to deal with \\"poisonous ideologies\\" and violent extremism.http://www.presstv.com/Detail/2015/11/27/439357/UK-unveils- counterterrorism-measure-for-Commonwealth The leaders also chose a new venue for the next summit, originally scheduled for 2017, as Vanuatu, which was originally selected as host, has rescinded its offer to host due to the long- term effects of devastation to the island nation's infrastructure caused by Cyclone Pam in March 2015. The British government will be hosting the next CHOGM in London in the spring of 2018, delayed from late 2017 due to other international commitments. Accordingly, the 26th CHOGM that was planned for Malaysia in 2019 was pushed back to 2020. Attendees Elizabeth II, as Head of the Commonwealth, along with the Duke of Edinburgh, the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall all attended the summit.http://www.news.lk/news/world/item/6536-queen-to-travel-to-malta-for- commonwealth-summit The summit coincided with a state visit to Malta by Elizabeth II as Queen of the United Kingdom, her first visit to the country since 2007. Secretary-General of the United Nations Ban Ki-Moon and French President Fran√ßois Hollande addressed a special session on climate change. Ban and Nicolas Sarkozy, Hollande's predecessor, had previously attended CHOGM 2009 in Trinidad and Tobago prior to the Copenhagen Summit for the same reason. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was absent from the meeting - his government has opposed arguments that the country should curtail its use of coal fired electrical generation and other greenhouse gases. India was instead represented by External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj. Leaders in attendance included Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena, British Prime Minister David Cameron, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. At least 15 leaders did not attend the summit and sent cabinet ministers or other officials as representatives including the Tongan Prime Minister Akilisi Pohiva, who absented himself due to health reasons and domestic priorities, Solomon Islands Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare, who sent his deputy prime minister instead, and Vanuatu Prime Minister Sato Kilman, who could not attend due to a government crisis that resulted in a snap election. Tanzania was represented by its High Commissioner, whilst Kenya was represented by its High Commissioner at the Opening Ceremony as Uhuru Kenyatta did not arrive until the second day of the summit. Outcomes=Climate change The leaders agreed on and issued the Commonwealth Leaders‚Äô Statement on Climate Action which called climate change an \\"existential threat\\" to many states and called for the upcoming 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP21) to produce \\"an ambitious, equitable, inclusive, rules-based and durable outcome ... that includes a legally binding agreement\\" to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and control climate change. The statement asserted that \\"many of our most vulnerable states and communities are already facing the adverse impacts of climate change ... (and) for some it represents an existential threat.\\" The leaders also called for developed nations to spend $100 billion a year by 2020 to help developing countries deal with the effects of climate change. To that end, Canada pledged $2.65 billion over five years to help developing countries tackle climate change. The UK committed ¬£21 million for disaster management and ¬£5.5 million for the ocean-based economy whilst Australia has committed $1 million for a new Commonwealth initiative, the Climate Finance Access Hub, and India pledged $2.5 million in assistance. A $1 billion Commonwealth Green Finance Facility, proposed by the Prince of Wales, was also created to support environmental projects among poor Commonwealth nations. Peace and security The final Communiqu√© issued by leaders at the end of the CHOGM also addressed the issues of peace and security, affirming that \\"radicalisation, violent extremism and terrorism in all its forms and ramifications are serious threats to the whole world\\" and called upon Commonwealth members to fully implement United Nations Security Council Resolution 2178 (2014) on terrorism and extremism and called for the implementation of \\"national strategies to counter radicalisation, violent extremism and terrorism\\" including education and the addressing of grievances and alienation by susceptible individuals, particularly young people. The Commonwealth leaders also agreed to a British proposal to create a new unit of experts to counter extremism. The body will be run by the Commonwealth Secretariat, which will combat radicalisation and terrorist recruitment across the Commonwealth. Australia has committed $2.5 million to the unit in addition to a ¬£5 million by Britain. The Communiqu√© also encouraged all countries to accede to and fully implement the Arms Trade Treaty of 2014 in order to curtail the illicit trade in conventional weapons including small arms. Human rights, good governance, and migration The statement also reaffirmed commitments to human rights and good governance, and respect for rule of law and democratic principles and \\"agreed to enhance national and international efforts to address the causes of irregular migration including prevention and abatement of conflict and violent extremism and terrorism; eradicating poverty and promoting sustainable economic development; strengthening the rule of law; nurturing inclusive and pluralist political systems; combatting organised crime, human trafficking and people smuggling, and modern day slavery; and reinforcing respect for human rights\\" and called for international co-operation and the adherence of international law in regards to migration, calling on \\"all stakeholders to work towards a lasting solution to this global issue\\". Sustainable development On the issue of sustainable development leaders adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and called for its implementation in the hopes that it would \\"lead to the eradication of poverty in all its dimensions and ensure no one is left behind\\" and also agreed to \\"provide continued assistance to member states in attaining long-term debt sustainability by means of technical advice on institutional strengthening, debt financing, debt strategy formulation and debt restructuring.\\" Other issues The Communiqu√© also touched on the concerns of small states, pledging to advocate internationally on their behalf, trade, in particular pledging to augment access to trade and investment finance for small, vulnerable, or developing states, youth, and the importance of developing youth leadership, gender equality and women's empowerment, calling in particular for continued efforts to \\"prevent and eliminate child, early and forced marriage and female genital mutilation\\", public health, underlining the importance of immunization programs to tackle diseases such as malaria and committing states to the eradication of polio as a global priority, and calling \\"on the Commonwealth at large to support the strengthening of policies for universal health coverage in order to build strong and resilient health systems that will, in turn, enable better responses to public health threats and emergencies\\". The meeting also called for easier movement of Commonwealth citizens between member states. Country issues Leaders also welcomed progress on continuing national and regional issues such as improve bilateral relations between Belize and Guatemala and their border disagreement, reaffirmed its call for the implementation of existing United Nations resolutions on the Cyprus dispute, expressed solidarity with Guyana in its ongoing border dispute with Venezuela.

It was written and produced by William Orbit, Ana D√≠az, and Dan Traynor, with additional songwriting provided by Spears and Anthony Preston. \\"Alien\\" is a mid-tempo dance-pop song, which lyrically discusses Spears' feelings of loneliness. \\"Alien\\" received acclaim from music critics, who appreciated its production and recognized it as being among the more personal offerings from the record. The track peaked at number 8 on the US Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles and debuted at 147 on the French Singles Chart despite not being a single from Britney Jean. The track has been performed during Spears' residency show Britney: Piece of Me. Background After serving as a judge on the second season of the American version of The X Factor, Spears began work on her eighth studio album in December 2012. In May 2013, record producer William Orbit was announced to be working on the project. Upon the announcement of her record in September, titled Britney Jean, Spears described her collaboration with Orbit, titled \\"Alien\\", as \\"really cool\\" and \\"really great\\". Early reports speculated that the song would feature American recording artist Lady Gaga, as suggested by a tweet posted to Twitter by executive producer will.i.am, although such a collaboration never came to fruition. On November 18, preceding the release date of Britney Jean on December 3, a demo version of the track was leaked online; Orbit commented that it was the \\"right song [with the] wrong chorus notes\\", which had been corrected on the final production. On December 22, Spears announced through her E! documentary special I Am Britney Jean that \\"Alien\\" would likely be released as a single from Britney Jean in 2014. In July 2014, audio leaked of Spears singing the song without pitch correction. James Lachno of The Daily Telegraph noted that Spears struggles to project her voice and reach the song's high notes. Critics described Spears' vocal performance in the leaked track as \\"flat at best and, at worst, like a strangled cat\\", \\"noticeably off- key\\", \\"unpolished [and] unflattering\\", \\"diabolical\\", \\"a style that might kindly be described as tentative\\", and \\"toxic to the ears\\". CNN defended the track, saying that its quality is irrelevant as Spears is not known for her vocal ability. Orbit claimed that the audio was a vocal warm up, not expected to be a take, and not intended to be heard by the public, adding, \\"Whomever put this on the internet must have done so in a spirit of unkindness, but it can in no way detract from the fact that Britney is and always will be beyond stellar! She is magnificent! And that‚Äôs that.\\" Composition \\"Alien\\" is a midtempo dance-pop song; it was written by Spears, William Orbit, Dan Traynor, Ana Diaz, and also Anthony Preston.Produced by handled by Orbit and HyGrade. Genevieve Koski from The A.V. Club felt that its musical style \\"[picked] up where Femme Fatales folk-laced closer \\"Criminal\\" left off [by opening] Britney Jean with an intriguing folktronica departure\\". Greg Kot from the Chicago Tribune described the production as a \\"light, airy slice of melancholic dance- pop, reminiscent of Madonna's Orbit-produced Ray of Light album.\\" Nick Catucci from Entertainment Weekly stated that \\"Alien\\" is a \\"gently pulsing track in which an actual extraterrestrial finally realizes she's 'not alone,' and repeats the phrase until it is pitchshifted up like a departing space ship.\\" Two minutes and fourteen seconds into the song, a vocal glitch is present as Spears sings the lyrics \\"and the light in your eyes\\", over which Orbit revealed that \\"there is actually a long story behind all of this which [he] would love to tell\\", and noted that \\"what has been called the 'demo' is not in fact the actual original demo.\\" Orbit joked about the matter, saying that the true cause of the glitch is that they \\"were kidnapped by Aliens and actually spent a year on their ship making friends, doing shows, creating Alien music [...] Then we travelled back to 2:14 in the track, with just that glitch to show for it.\\" On January 25, 2014, Orbit hinted on Twitter that the glitch might be a fail of production held by the album's executive producer, will.i.am: \\"Remember 'Glitchgate'? I assure you all that there will.be.no[sic] more glitches\\". Critical reception \\"Alien\\" received general acclaim from music critics, who appreciated its production and recognized it as being among the more personal offerings from the record. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic noted that Orbit was the only producer associated with the project that appropriately handled \\"[Spears'] sad, existential loneliness [by] placing it firmly in the center\\" of the track. Genevieve Koski from The A.V. Club complimented Spears for recording a midtempo track, which she felt showcased her vocal abilities better than the \\"robo-coo\\" that Spears is commonly associated with. Writing for Chicago Tribune, Greg Kot opined that \\"Alien\\" was the only song from Britney Jean that felt \\"vulnerable [and] personal\\". Nick Catucci of Entertainment Weekly shared a similar sentiment, expressing enjoyment of the \\"weird and wonderful intimacy\\" of the track, while Michael Gragg of The Guardian appreciated the experimental nature of its production. Kevin Harley from The Independent made favorable comparisons to Ray of Light by Madonna, and felt that \\"Alien\\" was one of Spears' stronger \\"multi-producer alliances\\" from the record. Writing for Slant Magazine, Sal Cinquemani saw \\"Alien\\" as an opportunity in which Spears successfully \\"[pushed her] sound forward\\", though Barry Walters from Spin felt that her vocal performance failed to match the more solemn production of the song. In light of the leaked audio, Lucas Villa of AXS listed \\"Alien\\" as the fifth best song of 2014, calling it a \\"gorgeous folktronica tune\\" that \\"hit home for the oft-guarded singer.\\" He added that \\"[h]opefully all the fuss led people to the original version, one of Spears' best recent works.\\" Live performances Spears performed \\"Alien\\" during her ongoing residency show Britney: Piece of Me, held by Planet Hollywood Las Vegas in Las Vegas. During a notable performance of the track on February 19, 2014, Spears was revealed to have been lip synching when the backing track continued playing and Spears missed her cue while interacting with the audience. When the April arm of Britney: Piece of Me began, \\"Alien\\" was cut in favor of \\"Do Somethin'\\". Following her break-up with her boyfriend David Lucado in August 2014, Spears removed \\"Perfume\\" from the set list for few shows in favor of \\"Alien\\". Britney performed \\"Alien\\" 10 times throughout February and August of 2014. Credits and personnel Credits adapted from the liner notes of Britney Jean.

It was written by Spears, Sia, Katy Perry, Andrew Swanson and Diplo, being produced by the latter, while the vocal production was done by Anthony Preston, who produced most of the album. The song has received critical acclaim from music critics. Background After serving as a judge on the second season of the American version of The X Factor, Spears began work on her eighth studio album in December 2012. In April 2013, Diplo, who already had worked with Spears previously in a remix of her 2008 single \\"Circus\\", was revealed to be working with Spears for her eighth album by Jean Baptiste via Twitter. Later in July, Spears revealed that she had a session with Sia, with whom she also co-wrote her single \\"Perfume\\". The song was originally written for Katy Perry's (who co-wrote the song) fourth album Prism. In November 2013, the song leaked on the Internet. It was originally believed to be a demo of the final track but later confirmed to be the final version once the album was released. Composition \\"Passenger\\" is an EDM-inspired pop rock, electro and pop power ballad written by Spears, Diplo, Furler, Swanson and Perry. The song lasts for three minutes and forty seconds, with background vocals by Furler. In a review, Jason Lipshutz from Billboard said that the song \\"finds the singer ruminating on romantic trust while delivering an empowering vocal performance over Diplo's guitar-driven production.\\" Critical reception Following the release of the album, \\"Passenger\\" received critical acclaim from music critics, who praised Spears voice and the composition of the song. Jason Lipshutz of Billboard praised the pop rock sound of the song, also saying that \\"Spears does her part by delivering resonant melismas and lyrics about giving your inhibitions over to another(...)\\". Rob Sheffield from Rolling Stones called it a \\"Brit's answer to Beyonc√©'s \\"Halo\\", as she emotes about finding someone to take the wheel and drive her home.\\" Michael Gragg, writing for The Guardian, said that \\"the Diplo-produced Passenger sounds refreshingly experimental\\", while Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine compared it favorably to Alien, saying that \\"it's one of the few moments on Britney Jean that even make an attempt to push Britney's sound forward.\\" Some critics compared the track to Spears's single at the time, \\"Perfume\\", with Kevin Harley of The Independent saying: \\"\\"Passenger\\" revisits that self-image [of Perfume], words yielding no surprises here: any fool knows that \\"You never know what you've got\\" completes the lyric of \\"Til it's Gone\\".\\", while Genevieve Koski from A.V. Club noted that both songs were \\"well-developed conceit and its genuine-seeming vulnerability, something Spears is much better at than most of her collaborators usually to give her credit for\\", later completing that Passenger \\"could easily be mistaken for a cover of a lost Katy Perry single.\\" Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic highlighted the track by calling it \\"the purest pop moment on the record that finds a counterpart in the album's best ballad, \\"Perfume\\" and saying that Spears was \\"on focus\\" on the track. Rudy Klap from Sputnikmusic gave a mixed review, praising Diplo production and Spears voice, while criticizing the lyrics for being too submissive: \\"Spears should be the dominating one here, the force of her personality and that voracious hunger that powers her best songs pushing and pulling\\". Barry Walters from Spin too gave a mixed review by comparing it to the works of Perry, more specifically on 2013's Prism, finishing by saying that the track \\"features Perry's straightforward vocal style (...) while delivering the album's only meaty melody, but its lyrics about living without a map aren't believable coming from Brit's lips. Unlike Madonna or Janet Jackson (or Katy Perry), Spears never seems in control.\\" Credits and personnel Credits adapted from the liner notes of Britney Jean.

Neurogenesis is the mechanism for neuron proliferation and differentiation. It entails many different complex processes which are all time and order dependent. Processes such as neuron proliferation, fate specification, differentiation, maturation, and functional integration of newborn cells into existing neuronal networks are all interconnected. In the past decade many epigenetic regulatory mechanisms have been shown to play a large role in the timing and determination of neural stem cell lineages. Relevant mechanisms and definitions Epigenetic mechanisms Three important methods of epigenetic regulation include histone modification, DNA methylation and demethylation, and microRNA (miRNA) expression. Histones keep the DNA of the eukaryotic cell tightly packaged through charge interactions between the positive charge on the histone tail and the negative charge of the DNA, as well as between histone tails of nearby nucleosomes. While there are many different types of histone modifications, in neural epigenetics there are two primary mechanisms which have been explored: histone methylation and histone acetylation. In the former, methyl groups are either added or removed to the histone altering its structure and exposing chromatin and leading to gene activation or deactivation. In the latter, histone acetylation causes the histone to hold the DNA more loosely, allowing for more gene activation. DNA methylation, in which methyl groups are added to cytosine or adenosine residdues on the DNA, is a more lasting method of gene inactivation than histone modification, though is still reversible in some cases. MicroRNAs are a small form of non- coding RNA (ncRNA) which often act as \\"fine-tuning\\" mechanisms for gene expression by repressing or inducing messenger RNA (mRNA) in neural cells but can also act directly with transcription factors to guide neurogenesis. Epigenetic regulation in the brain=Embryonic neurogenesisHistone modifications= Neural stem cells generate the cortex in a precise \\"inside out\\" manner with carefully controlled timing mechanisms. Early born neurons form deep layers in the cortex while newer born form the upper layers. This timing program is seen in vitro as well as in vivo. Histone methylation has been shown to be one of the epigenetic regulatory mechanisms which alters the proportionate production of deep layer and upper layer neurons. Specifically, deletion of Ezh2 encoding histone methyltransferase led to a twofold reduction of BRN2-expressing and SATB2 expressing upper layer neurons without affecting the number of neurons in layer V and VI. Similarly, histone acetylation through histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor valproic acid, an epilepsy therapeutic, in mouse embryonic stem cell (ESC) derived neural progenitors not only induces neuronal differentiation, but also selectively enriched the upper layer neuronal population. As such, it has been proposed that HDAC inhibition promotes the progression of neuronal differentiation, leading to a fate-switch from deep-layer producing progenitors into upper-layer progenitors. However, the reasons behind this selective differentiation and timing control as a result of HDAC inhibition are not yet fully understood. =DNA methylation= DNA methylation's critical nature to corticogenesis has been shown through knockout experiments in mice. When DNMT3b and DNMT1 were ablated separately in mouse embryos they died due to impairment of neural tube development. DNMT3a silencing did not cause embryonic lethality, but did result in a severe detriment in postnatal neurogenesis. This is largely due to the timing in which these epigenetic mechanisms are active. DNMT3b is expressed in early neural progenitor cells and decrease as neural development proceeds and DNMT3a is barely detectable up until embryonic day 10 (E.10). However, at E.10, DNMT3a expression increases significantly from E13.5 and well into adulthood. In the postnatal forebrain, DNMT3a is expressed in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and the hippocampal dentate gyrus, the primary locations for adult neurogenesis. The loss of DNMT3a in post natal neural progenitor cells leads to the down-regulation of neuronic genes such as Dlx2, Neurog2, and Sp8; but upregulation of genes involved in astroglial and oligodendroglial differentiation, indicating a role in the cell-fate switch from neurogenesis to gliogenesis. DNA demethylation, as well as methylation, of certain genes allows for neurogenesis to proceed in a time dependent manner. One such gene is Hes5, hypermethylated in E7.5 Embryos but completely demethylated by E9.5, which is one of the target genes in the Notch Signaling pathway. GCM1 and GCM2 demethylate the Hes5 promoter, allowing it to respond to NOTCH signaling and initiating the generation of neural stem cells. Another example is the Gfap gene which is required for astrocyte differentiation. The ability to differentiate into glial cells is repressed in neural stem cells with a neuronal cell fate. This repression is due largely to an irresponsiveness of neural stem cells towards astrocyte- inducing stimulations. The neural stem cells are non-responsive due to hypermethylated DNA in the promoter regions of astrocyte genes such as Gfap. The STAT3 binding site in the promoter region of Gfap is hypermethylated at E11.5 and barely so at E14.5, at which point it is able to receive astrocyte inducing stimulations and begin cytokine-inducible astrocyte differentiation. =miRNAs= Mechanism of miRNAs Studies done by De Pietri Tonelli and Kawase-Koga have shown conditional knockout of Dicer, an enzyme largely used for miRNA synthesis, in mouse neocortex resulted in reduced cortical size, increased neuronal apoptosis, and deficient cortisol layering. Neuroepithelial cells and neuroprogenitor cells were not affected until E.14, at which point they also underwent apoptosis. This doesn't show which miRNAs were responsible for the varying factors affected, but it does show that there is a stage- specific requirement for miRNA expression in cortical development. miR-124, the most abundant microRNA in the central nervous system, controls the lineage progression of subventricular zone neural progenitor cells into neuroblasts by suppressing protein production by targeting Sox9. Another major microRNA player is miR-9/9*. In embryonic neurogenesis miR-9 has been shown to regulate neuronal differentiation and self-renewal. Ectopic expression of miR-9 in the developing mouse cortex led to premature neuronal differentiation and disrupted the migration of new neurons through targeting Foxg1. Contrary to the idea that microRNAs are only fine-tuning mechanisms, recent studies have shown that miR-9 and miR-124 can act together to guide fibroblasts into neural cells. Transcription factors and regulatory genes, such as Neurod1, Ascr1, and Myt1l, which were previously thought to be responsible for this phenomenon did not transform human fibroblasts in the absence of miR-9 and miR-124, but in the presence of the microRNAs and the absence of the transcription factors human fibroblast transformation proceeded, albeit in a less efficient manner. Adult neurogenesisDNA methylation= Neurogenesis continues after development well through adulthood. Growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible, beta (GADD45b) is required for the demethylation of promoters of critical genes responsible for new-born neuron development such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF2). As such, upregulation of GADD45b leads to increased demethylation, increased BDNF and FGF2, and ultimately more neural progenitor cells. =Histone modification= Histone deacetylation also plays a large role in the proliferation and self-renewal of post-natal neural stem cells. Neural- expressed HDACs interact with Tlx, an essential neural stem cell regulator, to suppress TLX target genes. This includes the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor P21 and the tumor suppressor gene Pten to promote neural stem cell proliferation. Inhibition of HDACS by the antiepileptic drug valproic acid induces neuronal differentiation as in embryonic neurogenesis, but also inhibits glial cell differentiation of adult neural stem cells. This is likely mediated through upregulation of neuronal specific genes such as the neurogeneic basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors NEUROD, NEUROGENENIN1, and Math1. Conditional loss of HDAC1 and HDAC2 in neural progenitor cells prevented them from differentiating into neurons and their loss in oligodendrytic progenitor cells disrupted oligodendrocyte formations, suggesting that histone deacetlyation plays important but varying roles in different stages of neuronal development. =miRNAs= miR-9 targets the nuclear receptor TLX in adult neurogenesis to promote neural differentiation and inhibit neural stem cell proliferation. It also influences neuronal subtype specification and regulates axonal growth, branching, and targeting in the central nervous system through interactions with HES1, a neural stem cell homeostasis molecule. miR-124 promotes cell cycle exit and neuronal differentiation in adult neurogenesis. Mouse studies have shown that ectopic expression of miR-124 showed premature neural progenitor cell differentiation and exhaustion in the subventricular zone. In memory Histone acetylation has a dynamic role in controlling memory formation and synaptic plasticity. HDAC inhibitors exhibited positive effects on mice with cognitive defects such as Alzheimer's disease and improved the cognition of wild type mice. HDAC2 has been shown to play a negative role in memory and learning. Sirt1, a histone acetylase, reduces memory formation ability by promoting the expression of miR-134, which targets the critical activity-dependent transcription factor (CREB) essential for learning and memory. The Growth Arrest and DNA Damage inducible 45 (Gadd45) gene family plays a large role in the hippocampus. Gadd45 facilitates hippocampal long-term potentiation and enhances persisting memory for motor performance, aversive conditioning, and spatial navigation. Additionally, DNA methylation has been shown to be important for activity- dependent modulation of adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus, which is mediated by GADD45b. GADD45b seems to act as a sensor in mature neurons for environmental changes which it expresses through these methylation changes. This was determined by examining the effects of applying an electric stimulus to the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) in normal and GADD45b knockout mice. In normal mice application of electrical stimulation to the DG increased neurogenesis by increasing BDNF. However, in GADD45b deficient mice the electrical stimulus had less of an effect. Further examination revealed that around 1.4% of CpG islands in DG neurons are actively methylated and demethylated upon electric shock. This shows that the post-mitotic methylation states of neurons are not static and given that electric shock equipment such as that used in the study has been shown to have therapeutic effects to human patients with depression and other psychiatric disorders, the possibility remains that epigenetic mechanisms may play an important role in the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders. DNMT1 and DNMT3a are both required in conjunction for learning, memory, and synaptic plasticity. Epigenetic misregulation and neurological disorders Alterations on epigenomic machinery cause DNA methylation and histone acetylation processes to go rogue, leading to alterations on the transcriptional level of genes involved in the pathogenesis of neural degenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, and bipolar disease. =Alzheimer's disease= MicroRNA expression is critical for neurogenesis. In patients with Alzheimer's disease miR-9 and miR-128 is upregulated, while miR-15a is downregulated. Alzheimer's patients also show decreases in brain- derived neurotrophic factor, which has been shown to be repressed through DNA methylation. Although what has been argued as the most evidence for epigenetic influence in Alzheimer's is the gene which controls the protein responsible for amyloid plaque formation, App. This gene has very high GC content in its promoter region, meaning that it is highly susceptible to DNA methylation. This promoter site has been shown to naturally reduce methylation with aging, exemplifying the parallels between aging and Alzheimer's already well known. Heavy metals also seem to interfere with epigenetic mechanisms. Specifically in the case of APP, lead exposure earlier in life has been shown to cause a marked over-expression of the APP protein, leading to more amyloid plaque later in life in the aging brain. DNA methylation's age relation has been further investigated in the promoter regions of several Alzheimer's related genes in the brains of postmortem late-onset Alzheimer's disease patients. The older patients seem to have more abnormal epigenetic machinery than the younger patients, despite the fact that both had died from Alzheimer's. Though this in of itself is not conclusive evidence of anything, it has led to an age-related epigenetic drift theory where abnormalities in epigenetic machinery and exposure to certain environmental factors which occur earlier in life lead to aberrant DNA methylation patterns far later, contributing to sporadic Alzheimer's Disease predisposition. Histone modifications may also have an impact in Alzheimer's disease, but the differences between HDAC effects in rodent brains compared to human brains have researchers puzzled. As the focus for neurodegenerative diseases begins to shift towards epigenetic pharmacology, it can be expected that the interactions of histone modifications with respect to neurogenesis will become more clear.

Glasgow Girls Exhibition, 1990  Jude Burkhauser is best known for bringing together the widely acclaimed Glasgow Girls exhibition held at Glasgow Kelvingrove Museum in 1990 and for editing the accompanying exhibition catalogue, Glasgow Girls: Women in Art and Design 1880-1920. The retrospective exhibition brought together the talents of women artists and designers who gathered around Glasgow School of Art between 1880 and 1920. The ‚ÄúGlasgow Girls‚Äù included women such as Jessie Newbery, Ann Macbeth, Bessie MacNicol and the sisters Frances Macdonald and Margaret Macdonald. Glasgow Girls: Frances Macdonald, unknown, Ruby Pickering, Margaret Macdonald, Agnes Raeburn, Katharine Cameron and in front Janet Aitken. In a review, critic Lynne Walker commended Burkhauser for the exhibition's achievement in demonstrating that \\"much of the powerful visual culture of Glasgow c.1900 was produced by and for women\\". The exhibition was held in the same year that Glasgow was awarded City of Culture and was one of the programme's major successes. Feminist Polemic Burkhauser arrived at Glasgow School of Art in 1987 on a Rotary International Scholarship to do postgraduate research on the subject of Scottish women artists and remained in the city until 1991. Alongside her profiling of female artists, Burkhauser‚Äôs highly publicised falling out with Glasgow Museums, and in particular with the Kelvingrove Museum chief Julian Spalding, over plans to exhibit the 'Glasgow Girls' internationally added to her fierce reputation and tenacious character. The dispute ended in litigation with Burkhauser eventually creating her own company to produce the exhibition. Margaret Macdonald - The Opera of the Seas The hard-fought battle was a challenge to the perceived masculinity of Glasgow's leading art institutions. In the catalogue, Burkhauser commented that ‚ÄúYoung women in the arts have been starved for stories of other women, tales of these maverick sisters whom they might learn from [...] We followed in one another‚Äôs footsteps, knocking on doors, asking the same questions, rediscovering fire, the wheel, electricity, because there was no record of our past.‚Äù In this respect, the 'Glasgow Girls' exhibition is deemed a triumph in the course of art history for its promotion of Scottish female artists. Burkhauser's dedication to its success was evident in the use of her own property as the insurance to bring Margaret Macdonald's painting The Opera of the Seas (1915) to Glasgow from Germany. A section of this painting appears on the cover of the published exhibition catalogue. Artistic career Burkhauser trained at Moore College of Art from 1965 to 1970. She taught elementary school art in the Hamilton Township N.J. school district from 1970-71. She worked as a children's librarian and as a director at the Ewing Headquarters Library, Mercer County N.J. 1973-1979, having received a Master of Library Science degree from Rutgers University in 1976. She served as a director and artist-in-residence for the North Cape May county art league in New Jersey, 1983-1984. During this period she also founded the Cape May Writers' Co-op and published a book of her own poetry, Giving Sorrow Words, in 1984. As an artist she worked across several media including painting, tapestry and environmental art.Hancox, John. The Guardian (1959-2003) [London (UK)] 16 Oct 1998: 22 She was an established member of the female artists‚Äô group Guerrilla Girls and a strong feminist voice. She had a love for railway architecture and during her years in Cape May, lived in a converted train station which she had restored as a local history library. This formed part of a thesis project for a degree in Library Science studied at Rutgers University. Birkhauser was later commissioned to create an installation in the roof trusses of the Hielanman‚Äôs Umbrella for the Glasgow Garden Festival in 1988 and the railway history mosaic, now permanently exhibited at Glasgow Central Station. Jude Burkhauser, Railway history mosaic in Glasgow Central Station While living in Scotland, Burkhauser enjoyed visiting the eco-village community at Findhorn in Moray which was a retreat from the troubles she encountered in Glasgow.

Early years Born Tabitha Lebec (Elise) in San Diego, CA, Lebec was interested in music at a young age. At the age of four, she began playing the piano and developed an interest in the classical genre. She was interested in pop and rock music in high school. Becoming a young traveler she visited New Zealand for two years and then it was off to Australia where in Sydney she met painter Charles Billich. That meeting ignited a fire that produced her debut album Tabitha Plays Billich. The CD displayed the artwork of Mr. Billich, thus allowing two art forms to adapt to mutual significance. Next, it was off to England where, for five years, formed and played with her band the Post Pop Federation. Joined on stage and in the studio with Mike Lindup of the band Level 42 and Roland Chadwick, the band birthed their debut album PPF on the Warner Brothers label. On her arrival back to the states, Lebec was embraced within a work-study process. The projects were a blend of writing and recording various sounds. Out of those years, a new CD release was to take shape in 2004, ‚ÄúBack to Innocence‚Äù, again under her birth name of Tabitha Lebec. At that time she returned to her roots on the piano and changed her name to Elise Lebec. In 2006 her new identity and new sound took form in her release of Possible Dreams‚Äù ‚ÄúImpressions of a Solo Piano‚Äù Lebec's journey started with her first husband was Nigel Portman-Lewis who died from lung cancer in 2001. Lebec traveled to New Zealand where the two of them bought 65 acres of oceanfront property and a very old \\"Pianola\\" that no longer had working parts. This piano she played for two years while living in a concrete building on the South Island Of New Zealand in a town called \\"Seddon\\". While other teenagers were out partying and exploring things Lebec was playing piano on an isolated beach with a farmer up the road and a British lover who was old enough to be my father. It was during this time that her husband came up with the word \\"Clage\\" because they needed a way to describe her music as it was a perfect mix of classical and new age. It was these two years in New Zealand that really set the ground for her piano compositions and confidence to pursue music as a career. Lebec's parents are Bryant Crouch and Linda Elliot Jones. Lebec was raised by her father and mother and was greatly influenced by her grandmother Beverly Ann Crouch who was a native of Boston Massachusetts, who passed in 1993. Her extended family consists of a younger sister named Rachelle Winder and a half-sister named Havilah Crouch and a half-brother named Justyn Jones. Over many years as an artist, composer, writer, and pianist, Lebec's dream was to compose full-time. Lebec is currently working on a film called Sum Total of Our Memory directed by Barbara Klutinis. Some of her all-time favorite pieces are listed below. Sydney Symphony From the album \\"Tabitha Plays Billich\\" 1997 This composition was inspired by the artwork of Charles Billich. Lebec was living in Sydney at the time and performing piano at the Ritz Carlton and at Charles's waterside gallery. She created the composition instrument by instrument on one of the first keyboards that talked digitally to a software product called Logic. Logic at the time was brand new thing and so was the idea of recording a composition by performing it into a keyboard, which would then record the notes for you. She would compose by sitting down and designing the string section, then go back and perform the horns and then trumpet or whatever sounds she envisioned. No Ordinary Day 2003 This song was written while living in London but wasn‚Äôt properly recorded until meeting Peter Bernstein (Elmer Bernstein‚Äôs son) and L.A. producer Richard Young. Peter and Richard took this song and reproduced it from the ground up with guitar harmonics on it from the band ToTo. The song was written in response to Lebec‚Äôs personal life experience living in London and working in the music industry there.

In 1882, two 0-6-0 tank locomotives entered service on the private Kowie Railway which was being constructed between Port Alfred and Grahamstown. Both locomotives were rebuilt to a wheel arrangement in 1884.Espitalier, T.J.; Day, W.A.J. (1943). The Locomotive in South Africa - A Brief History of Railway Development. Chapter II - The Cape Government Railways (Continued). South African Railways and Harbours Magazine, November 1943. pp. 811-812, 818. The Kowie Railway The private Kowie Railway line from Port Alfred to Grahamstown was built and operated by three successive private enterprises. Early in 1881, the Government of the Cape of Good Hope passed a Bill to authorise the London-based Grahamstown and Port Alfred Railway Company to construct a railway from Port Alfred northwestwards to Grahamstown. The company was established with a capital of ¬£200,000 and, since the railway was to link Grahamstown with the harbour at Port Alfred, the Government undertook to subsidise it to the extent of ¬£500,000.The South African Railways - Historical Survey. Editor George Hart, Publisher Bill Hart, Sponsored by Dorbyl Ltd., Published c. 1978, pp. 12-13. The Port Alfred- Grahamstown-Alicedale line The greatest challenge to overcome during the building of the railway was the construction of the Blaauw¬≠krantz Bridge across the Kowie River, which delayed progress. In 1882, the railway was partially opened to traffic as far as Blaauw¬≠krantz. The line was only completed to Grahamstown and opened to traffic on 3 December 1884. The track had approximately 6% of 1 in 40 (2¬Ω%) and 30% of 1 in 50 (2%) gradients. Manufacturer On 22 May 1882, two 0-6-0 tank locomotives for the Grahamstown and Port Alfred Railway Company, built by Hunslet Engine Company with works numbers 277 and 278, were landed at Port Alfred off the SS Rothesay. The locomotives were acquired for goods working and were named Port Alfred and Kowie respectively. Modification In 1884, both locomotives were rebuilt to 4-4-0 tank locomotives. The necessary parts and equipment for the conversion were supplied by Hunslet and the rebuilding took place at Port Alfred. It involved the removal of the leading coupled wheels, extending the frame in front of the smokebox and the installation of a four-wheeled leading bogie. Liquidations Partly as a result of the delays which occurred during the Kowie Harbour development at Port Alfred due to the continuous silting up of the Kowie River, the Grahamstown and Port Alfred Railway Company soon suffered financial difficulties and was forced into liquidation in 1887. A group of Grahamstown residents formed a syndicate in 1888 and took over the operation of the line to Port Alfred until 1895, when they sold out to the Kowie Railway Company. South African Railways Following a major disaster when a passenger train derailed on the Blaauwkrantz Bridge in 1911, the resultant claims against the Kowie Railway Company led to its bankruptcy. On 1 April 1913, the line and the locomotives were taken over by the Union Government and became part of the South African Railways. The two locomotives remained in service on this line until they were scrapped.

He studied tropical geography at St.John's College with Alfred Steers from 1956, graduating with a first class degree in 1959. His introduction to coral reefs came on the Cambridge Expedition to British Honduras (Belize), 1959‚Äì60. He returned there for further research into corals and the plants of the cays, working for Louisiana State University before and after a major hurricane, tracking its effects on atolls and reefs. He gained a Cambridge PhD for this work in 1964 and was appointed lecturer in Geography at Cambridge, rising through the ranks. He was a fellow of Churchill College, Cambridge from 1966 to 1987.http://www.sil.si.edu/digitalcollections/atollresearchbulletin/issues/00494.12.pdf Stoddart, D.R. 2001. Be of good cheer, my weary readers, for I have espied land. Atoll Research Bulletin 494(12) In the mid-1980s he was a Regents Fellow at the Smithsonian. He was appointed Chair of Department and Professor of Geography at the University of California, Berkeley in 1988, holding the headship until 1994 when he was forced aside by the Dean. The Department had internal conflicts, and Stoddart had managed these effectively for the first few years, hiring several new staff. Ill health was cited when he retired from Berkeley in 2000. Stoddart studied the geomorphology and ecology of tropical islands and reefs, beginning in Belize, then the Maldives, Seychelles, Solomon Islands, and various locations in the Pacific including the Great Barrier Reef, Aitutaki in the Cook Islands, and in the mid-1970s to the disputed Phoenix Islands. His particular focus was documenting the plant assemblages present on atolls, making links to evolutionary biology. He also studied the evolution of atolls since the Pleistocene.Spencer, T. 2011. David Stoddart. In Hopley, D. (ed.). 'Encyclopedia of Modern Coral Reefs: Structure, Form and Process'. Springer. p1044. In the mid-1960s, accompanying a military expedition, he discovered great biodiversity and documented the huge tortoise populations on the Seychelles island of Aldabra, and the scientific work on its habitat was instrumental in stopping the construction of a British military airfield. The island became a World Heritage Site in 1982. In 1967, a similar expedition went to Diego Garcia, one of the Chagos Islands, prior to its appropriation for a controversial American base.http://www.sil.si.edu/digitalcollections/atollresearchbulletin/issues/00494.12.pdf Stoddart, D.R. 2001. Be of good cheer, my weary readers, for I have espied land. Attoll Research Bulletin 494(12) The decline in interest and status of the discipline of climatic geomorphology was in part indebted to a 1969 publication of Stoddart. Stoddart criticized climatic geomorphology for applying supposedly \\"trivial\\" methodologies in establishing landform differences between morphoclimatic zones, being linked to Davisian geomorphology and by allegedly neglecting the fact that physical laws governing processes are the same across the globe. He also held an interest in the history of geographic thought, publishing a major book On Geography and Its History in 1986 and several articles about the discipline, and on the contribution of Darwin's work to understanding the Earth. A parallel program on the morphology and hydrodynamics of salt marshes was largely conducted in the UK. He also studied mangroves and sedimentation. He published work in the Smithsonian Institution's Atoll Research Bulletin. He was also one of the founders of the journal Progress in Geography, and the first co-ordinating editor of the journal Coral Reefs. He was a co-founder and first president of the International Society for Reef Studies and helped to establish the quadrennial International Coral Reef Symposium. He was also involved in the establishment of the International Year of the Reef in 1997, and of the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network.

Jones (April 10, 1855 - January 4, 1933), was an American capitalist and philanthropist, who amassed a fortune engaging in many fields of business and industry including leather and shoe manufacturing, cattle breeding, dairy farming, and real estate development. Born to Isaac Rodney Jones and Harriet (Sears) Jones, Charles married Bessie Roberts of Boston in December 1882, and fathered four children. Leather & Shoe Manufacturing Charles H. Jones began work in the shoe industry in his mid-teens. In 1881 at the age of 26, he and Henry B. Endicott established the shoe manufacturing company Charles H. Jones & Co. in Whitman, Massachusetts. By 1885, the partners‚Äô business had merged with the Bay State Shoe & Leather Co. to form the Commonwealth Shoe and Leather Co, and had begun manufacturing what became the hugely popular Bostonian shoe. Known for high quality and comfort, The Bostonian is still sold today. By 1902 the manufacturing company had begun to sell directly to shoe retailers in addition to wholesalers, garnering even greater profits. thumb At the start of 1906, sales through the Commonwealth Shoe and Leather Company office located at 72 Lincoln Street in Boston's shoe district were international in scope, and the company was operating steam- powered factories in the three New England cities of Whitman, Massachusetts (the largest and original site), Gardiner, Maine, and Skowhegan, Maine, with a combined employment of 3,000 workers, and an output of 7,000 pairs of shoes per day. Public life Commonwealth Shoe & Leather Company, Main Factory 1911 Charles H. Jones's prominence in the shoe manufacturing business led to him being considered by some to be the most knowledgeable person in the world on the subject. His business interests led him to become active in public policy, fighting unceasingly in Washington to keep the import of leather hides free from tariffs. He assisted in the framing of four tariff acts: * The Dingley Act of 1897 * Payne‚ÄìAldrich Tariff Act of 1909 * Underwood-Simmons Act of 1913 * Fordney‚ÄìMcCumber Tariff Act of 1922 In 1909 Dartmouth College recognized him with an honorary master's degree. Although he had frequently been mentioned as a possible candidate for Governor, Jones refused the Democratic nomination for Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts and never sought public office. He did accept the position of Director of the First National Bank of Boston, Batchelder & Lincoln Co., Transportation Committee Chairman for the Boston Chamber of Commerce, held executive offices for the New England Shoe & Leather Association, the National Bank of Redemption and the Boylston Machinery Company. Club memberships included the Guernsey Club of Boston, Boston City, Exchange, Boot & Shoe, Eastern and Beverly Yacht Clubs. Jones attended the First Baptist Church of Weston, was a Trustee of the Gordon College of Theology and Missions and served as a Director of the Evangelistic Association of Missions. Recreation included sailing on his 30' sailboat The Ashumet, farming and hunting. Interests ranged from art, education and literature, to travel and improving methods in manufacturing. Dairy Farming in Weston In 1901 Jones began his business venture in cattle breeding and dairy farming by accumulating a set of poor, largely abandoned neighboring farms in Weston, Massachusetts. Spanning , the resulting Filmore Farm grounds were then designed by renowned landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted to incorporate a greenhouse, vegetable garden and multi-use open spaces. Jones built his first dairy barn, a monumental five story structure, in 1903. By 1913 Jones had erected a second large barn, known as the ‚Äútesting barn,\\" fitted with new stainless steel pipes, and pasteurizing and bottling equipment, where daily milk output was weighed and recorded. This was also where he stabled his purebred, world-champion Guernsey bulls that could bring as much as $2,000 during the occasional cattle auction held on the property. More than a dozen buildings still remain from the Charles Jones Estate on 458 Glen Road, including the main house and carriage house, staff cottages and one of the last remaining ice houses in Weston. Real Estate Development C.H. Jones on the Ashumet, Buzzards Bay early 1900s Located in West Falmouth, Massachusetts, Chapoquoit Island was previously known as \\"Hog Island\\"; the name Chapoquoit is thought to have been modeled after that of a band from a local Native American tribe, the Chappaquiddick Wampanoag. Franklin King and Nathaniel Coleman purchased the island in 1872 from Joshua and Daniel Bowerman, but a depression in 1873 prevented any further development. In June 1889 Coleman sold his one-third share to Charles H. Jones for $800. A series of complex legal maneuvers ensued with the Town of Falmouth regarding the building of a causeway to connect the island with the mainland. By appealing strictly to a select economic level, thirty eight parcels were sold at a price high enough to satisfy the required tax base. Borrowing ideas from Jones's Weston home, many were landscaped by Frederick Law Olmsted. In many cases the homes have remained in the same families for generations.

It was built between the later 2nd century and the early 3rd century. The three vaulted arch composed the western gate of the city, at the beginning of the Decumanus Maximus and the end of the road coming from Lambaesis. History The inscription on the attic records the foundation of the colony on the part of Trajan in the year 100. The decorative fabric of the monument, with the sides of the lateral arches detached from the wall, was taken with a curvilinear pediment that forms two protruding and strongly contrasted lateral aediculae. This and the lavish decoration of the architectural elements, all suggest a later dating.Pierre Gros, L'architettura romana dagli inizi del III sec. a.C. alla fine dell'alto impero, Milano 2001 (Italian translation of L'architecture romaine. 1 Les monuments publics, Paris 1996), pp.86-88. The arch together with the whole archaeological site of Timgad, has been listed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO since 1982.Scheda su Timgad on UNESCO's website. Description The arch reaches a height of 12 metres, with a central arch of 6 metres in height which permitted the passage of vehicles that have left deep ruts in the ground under the archway. The lateral arches, each 3.75 metres high, were reserved for pedestrians. Above the lateral arches on both sides are deep rectangular niches, which are flanked by aediculae with smooth-stemmed Corinthian columns of coloured marble on shelves. The niches were designed to hold statues, which are now lost. The whole assemblage of each lateral arch and niche was framed by two red Corinthian columns, detached from the walls and supported by pedestals. The entablature that runs across the wall above the lateral arches protrudes above the columns, and a curvilinear pediment rests on it in turn. The attic must have been surmounted with a group of monumental statues. Other sculpture was added to the arch in later times. This includes a statue of the gods Mars and one of Concordia erected under Emperor Septimius Severus by Lucius Licinius Optatianus, on the occasion of his election as flamen-for-life of the colonia.The erection of the statues is recorded in an inscription: .

History Gray Rock (also called Grey Rock) is situated next to Font Hill Manor, a plantation house built in the 1700s by Admiral Hammond. Caleb Dorsey of Belmont had three sons. Thomas Beale Dorsey, became the Attorney General of Maryland, and later built the farm at age 55 in order to be closer to his other two brothers. The farm was assembled in 1813 from many tracts of land including, Pinkstone's Delight, Fifth Edition, Ben's luck, Rebbecca's Lot, Gaither's Adventure-Ferry Bridge. In 1816 Freeborns Progress- Smith's Fortune and Addition to Freeborns Progress were added. In 1817, Ben's Delight, John's Luck, The Triangle, and Kelly's Neglect were assembled. The home is a four-bay by one-bay wooden structure standing two and a half stories tall based on a clapboard-covered log home that predates the 1813 purchases. An additional -story stone house is on the property that served as slave quarters for two families. The property also included several large wooden barns and a carriage house. The farm was situated along the Baltimore- Frederick turnpike road. It is now surrounded by a residential cul-de-sac at 3518 Angus Valley Trail. Thomas Beale Dorsey of Thomas died at Gray Rock on 6 September 1828 at the age of 60. The property passed to his daughter Sarah and her husband Dr. Arthur Pue in 1837 after the death of her mother Achsah Dorsey. (Pue was the family doctor to Peter Gorman and their son, Senator Arthur Pue Gorman). On 7 May 1848 the farm was inherited by their son Thomas Beale Dorsey Pue. In 1859, his father sold the 404 acre farm to James Mackubin for $32,000. In 1879, John H Herbert claimed a crop of 523 and 1000 bushels of Fultz wheat from two of Gray Rock's fields. In 1867, 43 acres were split off to Mackubbin where the MacAlpine Manor was built. The property was sold and leased back to MacKubbin until his death in 1904 when it was sold to the Sloatfield family finalized in 1911. On 14 May 1943, former Howard County Commissioner Charles E. Miller purchased the farm. Miller attempted multiple time to subdivide the farm for residential development. His company Miller Land Company submitted plans in 1978. In a 1981 historical survey, two headstones of the Pue family were documented, and several were found to be knocked over and covered with concrete pavement. The property was subdivided into a 331 and 22 acre Miller Land Company plots, a 50-acre section dedicated to the Lutheran Hospital of Maryland, and several small plots occupied by the library. In 1992, citizens were concerned the current county executive Charles I. Ecker was fast tracking the process. 1996, Gray Rock Drive went from access road to the farm to a through street.

He was the President of Peoples Gas Light and Coke Company in Chicago, Illinois by 1893. In 1894 he was a founder of the Union Calcium Carbide Company which he reformulated as Union Carbide in 1904. He was CEO and President, and the Board Chair of Union Carbide until 1933. Knapp's philanthropy was broad, but where he focused it was in medical care. He funded the growth and provided key leadership to Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital starting in 1914. In 1931 he funded the Knapp Hospital in Crescent City, California. Background Knapp grew up in Hatfield, son of Jared Owen Knapp and Sara Elizabeth Beach Knapp. He attended Hatfield High School and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, graduating in 1876 with a degree in Civil Engineering. He worked as an engineer for the War Department for one year, then joined the New Britain Gas Company in Connecticut. Moving to New York, he worked as a gas main inspector and then worked at laying out new mains for the Fullerton Municipal Gas Works. In 1883, he moved the Chicago where he joined Peoples Gas Light and Coke Company.Montecito and Santa Barbara: The Days of the Great Estates, Volume II, David F. Myrick, Pasadena, 1991, p. 309 Calcium Carbide Knapp worked at Peoples for twenty-one years, becoming President in 1893. While there, he became close friends with the son of the prior company president, Albert Merritt Billings. Albert's son was Cornelius Kingsley Garrison Billings who later became President of Peoples, and co- founder with Knapp of Union Carbide.George Owen Knapp: A Splendid Secret, Benjamin R. Taylor and Linda L. Bresnan, New York, 2004 Knapp learned of calcium carbide (discovered in 1888) in 1894. The colorless compound was used in the production of acetylene and calcium cyanamide. Acetylene was critical to the large and quickly growing steel industry for its use in welding. That year, with Billings, he formed the Union Calcium Carbide Company. Over the next ten years, Knapp focused on getting the business off the ground. By 1904, Knapp had his first processing plant at Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan and he reincorporated Union Calcium Carbide Company as Union Carbide. Over the next decade, Knapp opened two processing plants at Niagara Falls, New York and another at Sault Ste. Marie. First Family and Residence Knapp married Isabel Murray in 1880. The couple had two children, Sarah Estelle Knapp and William Jared Knapp. Isabel died in childbirth in 1886 taking their third child with her. In 1890, Knapp remarried to Louise Savage. The couple never had children. Most of the year, the Knapps lived where George Owen Knapp worked, in New York. They had a residence at 955 Park Avenue and a country home on Polly Park Road in Rye, New York. In 1894, the Knapps purchased the Hundred Island House and another hotel at Lake George (New York). He continued to buy adjacent land over the next two decades until he owned over 12 square miles of lake front. He started building his own home on the property in 1901, a large stone and shingle mansion with a cable car to run people down to the lake and back.Montecito and Santa Barbara: The Days of the Great Estates, Volume II, David F. Myrick, Pasadena, 1991, p. 310 In 1922, he donated the Old Stone House Library to the community. Note: This includes and Accompanying photographs It is believed that in 1904, Knapp, who was perhaps fifty or sixty pounds overweight, was diagnosed with diabetes and instructed by his physician, Franklin Nuzum, to take a health retreat to California. Knapp in Santa Barbara The Knapps, traveling with the Billingses, came by train west to Santa Barbara, and stayed at the Potter Hotel in 1904. They returned the next year and purchased 11 parcels of land in Montecito, California near the beach where they stated they had plans to build. They did not return for six years. When they returned in 1911, the Knapps made Santa Barbara a more permanent residence. Staying at the Potter for six weeks, they purchased the 70-acre Arcady estate in Montecito from Ralph Radcliffe Whitehead and sold the 11 beach parcels. The Knapp's launched an expansion of the already large home, with E. Russell Ray as architect. The remodel was completed a year later and the Knapp's moved in in August 1912. The gardens at Arcady were designed by Carleton Winslow and Francis T. Underhill. The Knapps extended their holdings to 148 acres at Arcady, and began purchasing other local properties. They acquired beachfront property at Sandyland Cove, California where the Knapps, the Billingses, and the Frederick Forrest Peabodys all owned adjacent homes and property. Knapp also purchased six separate mountain estates above Santa Barbara. The most famous of these was Knapp's Castle. Knapp purchased the land in 1916 and built roads in to make it accessible. He built a large stone and wood retreat with five bedrooms and five fireplaces. The site also had a guest house, servant's quarters, and a superintendent's house. Other mountain retreats Knapp owned in the area were the Laurel Springs Ranch (purchased in 1925) which he refurbished and made available as a nurse's retreat (and which was the future home of Jane Fonda and Tom Hayden), the El Capitan Ranch at Refugio Pass, Indian Camp (aka Wagon Wheels), Lower Indian Camp (aka Punch Bowl), and Agua Caliente Springs. The Four Horsemen Knapp, Billings, Peabody, and Clarence Black all lived in the same Eucalyptus Hill area of Montectio and as all owned horses, were soon called the Four Horsemen of Eucalyptus Hill. The moniker in part was given because the four acted together in philanthropic efforts, especially for Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital. Founded by 50 women in 1888, the hospital was transitioning from convalescent treatment to modern insurance-based medical care in the early 1910s. A new hospital building was needed, and the all-women board sought outside assistance for the first time. They first met with Clarence Black, President of Cadillac, in 1914 and asked him to form a board and take over. Black made the hospital's plight known to his friends and all four, over the next year or two, joined the board and began funding the hospital's growth in significant ways.Board minutes, Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital, 1914-1916 Knapp at Cottage Knapp first became involved in 1914 by funding the purchase of a new X-ray department including the Kelly Koett X-ray machines. He joined the hospital board in 1916, and donated funds to retire the hospital's debt in 1917. In 1917, Knapp also funded the first Dispensary in Santa Barbara, serving the populace who could not afford hospitals or physicians.Cottage Hospital: the first hundred years, the centennial history of Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital, Walker Tompkins, Santa Barbara, 1988 Over the next decade, Knapp provided funding for a new maternity building, the Potter Metabolic Clinic wing, a Children's wing, a 50-bed patient care wing, and the 1923 Louise Savage Knapp School of Nursing. He brought in architect E. Russell Ray who was superseded by Winsor Soule. Later he brought in Carleton Winslow. Knapp became President of the Board in 1919, and brought his personal physician from Chicago, Dr. Franklin Nuzum, to serve as Chief of Staff. When Milo Potter died in 1919 as the Potter Metabolic Clinic was being opened, it was Nuzum who recommended Dr. William David Sansum. Sansum came to Santa Barbara to run the Potter Clinic, and as the sole practitioner in the United States using insulin for the treatment of diabetes, made crucial contributions to the substance's development.Continuing Quest: Dr. William David Sansum's Crusade Against Diabetes, Walker Tompkins, Santa Barbara, 1977 In 1920, as Board President, Knapp wrote the hospital's credo in the Annual Report, \\"First, every item of hospital equipment and management must be considered from the standpoint of the good of the patient. No other consideration must come before this. No personal motives or convenience of the officers of the hospital, of the nurses, or of the physicians in charge have any place till the good of the patient has been taken care of. Second, the poorest charity patient in the hospital must have as good attention and care, and have every function of the hospital at his disposal, as the patient with unlimited wealth.\\" During Knapp's era of leadership, Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital became a premiere research, learning, and practicing hospital. It attracted patients from across the country for its successful treatment of diabetes, and the spa-quality rooms and service. Final Years Louise Savage Knapp died in 1924, and Knapp never remarried. Following her death, he soon retired from active responsibilities at Union Carbide, and traveled even more extensively than before. He purchased land in Northern California at Rock Creek, on the southern fork of the Smith River (California). The boat trip to the hunting lodge he built there took two-hours, so Knapp had a 180-hp airplane motor mounted to his river boat, Arcady. The trip then took 30 minutes. After a flood decimated the lodge at Rock Creek, Knapp purchased one at a safer location. As hospitals were scarce in the region, he donated the funds to build Seaside Hospital (aka the Knapp Hospital) in Crescent City, California. That hospital opened in 1931. He spent the last years of his life as a patient at Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital and died there on July 21, 1945.

Onset of bursts are indicated by solid arrows; offset, by open arrows. In both A and B, the interval between each vertical dotted line is one second. Burst suppression is an electroencephalography (EEG) pattern that is characterized by periods of high-voltage electrical activity alternating with periods of no activity in the brain. The pattern is found in patients with inactivated brain states, such as from general anesthesia, coma, or hypothermia. This pattern can be physiological, as during early development, or pathological, as in diseases such as Ohtahara syndrome.  History  The burst suppression pattern was first observed by Derbyshire et al. while studying effects of anesthetics on feline cerebral cortices in 1936, where the researchers noticed mixed slow and fast electrical activity with decreasing amplitude as anesthesia deepened. In 1948, Swank and Watson coined the term \\"burst- suppression pattern\\" to describe the alternation of spikes and flatlines in electrical activity in deep anesthesia. It wasn't until after the early 1960s that the burst suppression pattern began being used in medical settings; it had been primarily observed in animal studies and psychosurgeries.  Associations  In 1952, Henry and Scoville recorded the electrical activity of patients during lobotomy and found the burst suppression pattern present in the recorded electrical activity. In 1963, Fischer-Williams and Cooper found the pattern present in patients suffering from cerebral anoxia, hypoxia, and various types of intracortical lesions. Treiman et al. observed the pattern in deep coma, various infantile encephalopathies, and the final stages of deteriorated status epilepticus. Both Schwartz et al. in 1989 and Akrawi et al. in 1996 observed the pattern when the brain was subject to hypothermia and high levels of many sedative and anesthetic agents.  Characteristics  The pseudo-rhythmic pattern of burst suppression is dictated by extracellular calcium depletion and the ability of neurons to restore the concentration. Bursts are accompanied by depletion of extracellular cortical calcium ions to levels that inhibit synaptic transmission, which leads to suppression periods. During suppression, neuronal pumps restore the calcium ion concentrations to normal levels, thus causing the cortex to be subject to the process again. As the brain becomes more inactive, burst periods become shorter and suppression periods become longer. The shortening of bursts and lengthening of suppression is caused by the central nervous system's inability to properly regulate calcium levels due to increased blood-brain permeability. At the cellular level, hyperpolarization of the membrane potential of cortical neurons reliably precedes any overt electroencephalographic activity of burst suppression. This hyperpolarization, which has been attributed to an increase in neuronal membrane potassium conductance, has been hypothesized to play a major role in the induction of burst suppression, supported by the induction of burst suppression through the application of a direct acting GABAA agonist, muscimol. In contrast, inhibition is diminished when burst suppression is induced through the use of isoflurane. Another theory is that alterations in brain metabolism regulate activity dependent slow modulation of ATP-gated potassium channel conductance which induces burst suppression. However, modulating inhibitory activity alone may not be sufficient for burst suppression, and modulation in excitatory synaptic efficiency, stemming from the depletion and subsequent recovery of interstitial calcium levels, could contribute to the induction of burst suppression. Burst episodes are associated with excitatory activity in cortical neurons. Suppression is caused by the absence of synaptic activity of cortical neurons; however, some thalamocortical neurons exhibit oscillations in the delta frequency range during these periods. The burst suppression pattern varies with the brain anesthetic concentration when pharmacologically inducing coma. Level of suppression is adjustable by decreasing or increasing anesthetic infusion rate, thus adjusting the level of inactivation. While burst suppression has typically been viewed as a homogeneous brain state, recent studies have shown that bursts and suppressions can occur in specific regions while other regions are unaffected. The fact that the burst suppression pattern persists after a patient undergoes cortical deafferentation indicates that burst suppression represents an intrinsic dynamic mode of cortex. Even when a burst appears to be homogeneous across the brain, the timing of the bursts in different regions may differ. Burst suppression patterns can be classified through comparisons of burst duration and inter-burst intervals, maximum peak to peak voltage, and the ratio of power in high versus low frequencies. (Akrawi et al., 1996) Burst suppression with identical bursts suggests a deterministic process of burst generation, whereas other burst suppression patterns depend on stochastic processes. Burst suppression with identical bursts is a distinct pathological EEG pattern that is typical in diffuse cerebral ischemia and is associated with poor outcomes in comatose patients after cardiac arrest.  Electrophysiology  Bursts are identifiable on EEG readings by their high amplitude (75-250ŒºV), typically short period of 1‚Äì10 seconds, and have frequency ranges of 0‚Äì4 Hz (Œ¥) and 4‚Äì7 Hz (Œ∏). Suppression episodes are identifiable by their low amplitude (< 5ŒºV) and typically long period (> 10s). EEG recordings of burst-suppression pattern differ between adults and neonates because of diverse pattern fluctuations found in the EEG of neonates. These fluctuations, along with sudden changes in synchronous neuron firing, are caused by development of the newborn's brain. Burst suppression patterns also occur spontaneously during neonatal development, rather than as a characteristic of inactivated brains as in adults.  Quantification  In order to quantify the burst suppression pattern, the EEG signal must be subject to segmentation. The first segmentation used a fixed voltage- threshold, and various methods for segmentation or burst detection have developed in time domain, frequency (Fourier) domain, and both. These processes separates burst and suppression episodes based on EEG features such as entropies, non-linear-energy-operator, voltage variance, etc. When the features represent distinguishable patterns of burst and suppression, a fixed threshold using ROC-curve or machine learning methods are used for segmentation. Quantifying the burst suppression pattern allows for calculation of the burst suppression ratio (BSR) by assigning binary values of 0 to bursts and 1 to suppression episodes. Thus, a burst suppression ratio of 1 is associated with a state of the brain that shows no electrical activity, while a ratio of 0 indicates that the brain is active. The burst suppression ratio measures the amount of time within an interval spent in the suppressed state. This ratio increases as the brain becomes increasingly inactive until the brain's EEG signal flatlines, represented by a burst suppression ratio equal to 1. Because of the direct relationship between burst suppression ratio and brain inactivity, the ratio is an indicator of suppression intensity. Using the same binary assignments to the burst suppression pattern, another measure of the depth of burst suppression, the burst suppression probability (BSP), can be determined. Mathematically, the instantaneous probability of being suppressed, is : p_i = \\\\frac{e^{x_i}}{1+e^{x_i}}, BSR = (Total time of suppression/epoch length) √ó 100%. where xi is the brain's suppression state at time iŒî, with Œî representing intervals for analysis, and ranges across all real numbers.  Clinical benefits  Because the burst suppression pattern is characteristic of inactivated brains, the pattern can be used as a marker for the level of coma a patient is in, with persistence of the pattern commonly associated with poor prognosis. When inducing coma to protect the brain post trauma, the pattern assists in maintaining the necessary level of coma so that no further damage occurs to the brain. The pattern is also used to test the ability of anesthetic arousal agents to induce emergence from comas. The burst suppression pattern can also be used to track ascent into and descent out of hypothermia through observing changes in the pattern. Monitoring the burst suppression ratio aids medical personnel in adjusting suppression intensity for therapeutic purposes; however, medical personnel currently rely on visually monitoring the EEG and arbitrarily assessing the depth of burst suppression. Not only is the evaluation of the EEG signal for burst suppression done manually, but also the infusion rate of anesthetic to adjust suppression intensity. The introduction of machines makes maintaining proper levels of inactivity more precise through the use of algorithms. This is done through the use of measures such as burst suppression probability for real- time tracking of burst suppression or brain-machine interfaces to automate maintaining proper levels of inactivity.

The flamboyant Hungarian Colonel was court-martialed in 1863 for fraud and conduct prejudicial to military discipline. Antebellum life Frederick George D'Utassy was born in Zala Nagy Kalirsa, Hungary on November 26, 1827. He had a shrouded past as there is no official data and his alleged early life is only on his own testimony. On his own account he served as a Lieutenant in the Austrian Army, but defected to the Hungarian revolutionaries in the Hungarian Revolution of 1848, in whose service he attained the rank of Major and was captured and sentenced to death, on which destiny he escaped to the Ottoman Empire. He traveled to Greece and Italy, and in 1855 to England and Nova Scotia. He allegedly worked as a cavalry instructor, a secretary and a dancing teacher. He was appointed a professor of foreign languages at Dalhousie College in Halifax in 1855, as he spoke (at least) English, Hungarian, German, Spanish, French, and Italian. In October 1860 he moved to New York City. D'Utassy was married to his wife Bertha, with whom he had a son named Leo L. D'Utassy (born in 1854). Accompanying them to New York were his mother, his sister and his two brothers Anton and Carl. There D'Utassy started to introduce himself into the city's higher society. American Civil War service D'Utassy helped to raise and organise the 39th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment, a unit that was mustered in New York City for a service period of three years on May 22, 1861. Initially divided into 11 companies of men from Germany, Hungary, Switzerland, Italy, France, Spain and Portugal, it would ultimately host 11 different nationalities. His brothers Carl (on the muster rolls as Carl von Utassy) and Anton also joined the regiment as Lieutenants (Anton Anthony D'Utassy rose to Captain during the war). On May 27, 1861, they deployed to Washington and in July the 39th participated in the movement of the army towards Manassas. Attached into the 1st Brigade (Col. Louis Blenker) of the 5th Division (Col. Dixon S. Miles) it was only slightly engaged at the First Battle of Bull Run. Stationed in Alexandria, the ill feelings of the multi-ethnic regiment turned into violence and sparked several mutinies - all of those were quelled in D'Utassy's presence. In August, when Blenker was elevated to command of the German Division, D'Utassy took temporary command of the brigade. D'Utassy tried to Americanize his regiment, going so far as refusing to accept orders written in German, trying to use English as the only language used in the regiment and ordering his officer to pass language examinations. D'Utassy was a strong and hot-tempered disciplinarian and initiated severe punishment and several courts-martial for drunkenness or misconduct. He was utterly despised by a great portion of the regiment's officer corps, so much that many officers resigned. At the same time rumors were spread that D'Utassy was an impostor who forged his military records, and in reality an Austrian Jew by the name of Frederick Strasser; but he never officially denounced them. His hatred of all German, a common sentiment in the Hungarian revolutionaries, infuriated both his German superiors and his regiment as about half of the regiment was German. In November the quarrelsome Colonel reverted to command his regiment, and brigade command was given to Julius Stahel, who was junior to D'Utassy and has been promoted to Colonel just few weeks before. At the same time D'Utassy was accused of fraudulently drawing additional rations, but he proved the correctness of his action and the charge was neutralized. In April the feud between D'Utassy and Blenker, that was used under heavy use of the media, culminated in D'Utassy being arrested. D'Utassy demanded a court-martial, but this was denied. At the same time the division was assigned from Sumner's II Corps to Maj. Gen. John C. Fr√©mont's Mountain Department and joined his forces on May 11, taking part in the engagement near Strasburg. In the Battle of Cross Keys the brigade, still under now Brig. Gen. Stahel, and the 39th New York were stationed on the far left. It made an attack against the Confederate lines of Gen. Isaac R. Trimble, but was repulsed with heavy losses. Its further retreat marked the defeat of the Union Army on this day. On June 26 the 39th New York was assigned to Brig. Gen. Julius White's Railroad Brigade in the VIII Corps of the Washington defences. The brigade consisted of the 39th, 111th and 115th New York Infantry regiments, as well as the 15th Indiana Battery. During July and August it encamped at Middletown, Virginia; and D'Utassy, now free from the ethnical struggles with his commanders, managed to get the appreciation and admiration of his fellow American officers. The brigade took part in the retreat to Harper's Ferry in September 1862. General White officially accepted to serve under command of Colonel Dixon S. Miles, and took position as commander of the line at Bolivar Heights. This put D'Utassy in command of the brigade. D'Utassy took part in the surrender on September 15, though he reportedly strongly advised against it. After he was paroled he and the brigade proceeded to Camp Douglas, Chicago. He, like Gen. White and the other brigade commanders, was arrested by order of the Adjutant- General and had to testify on the court-martial about the conduct at Harper's Ferry under presidency of Gen. David Hunter. D'Utassy, like Gen. White and the brigade, was acquitted of any fault; and instead received praise. They officially exchanged in November and returned to Washington, when Colonel D'Utassy was assigned to command the 1st Brigade of the provisional division of Maj. Gen. Silas Casey at Union Mills, Maryland. The brigade, later named 3rd Brigade, was made up of depleted units from Harper's Ferry and consisted again of the 39th and the 115th as well as of the 126th New York Infantry and 125th New York Infantry regiments. While the 115th left the brigade it was later rejoined by the 111th New York. For a short time the 26th Michigan Infantry was attached to the brigade, as was the 151st Pennsylvania Infantry till February 1863. In December he and his brigade took part in opposing Stuart's Christmas Raid, but did not engage the Confederate raiders. In January, 1863, the brigade command was given to convalescent Brigadier Alexander Hays and D'Utassy again reverted to command his 39th New York, though Hays utilized him as his deputy. The Court-Martial In March 1863 Colonel D'Utassy was arrested by order of the War Department. A court-martial convened on April 2 under presidency of Maj. Gen. Ethan A. Hitchcock, and D'Utassy was accused of 3 charges with 25 individual specifications - on which he pleaded not guilty. The whole matter was part of a campaign to exterminate corruption, fraud and mismanagement from the army, a campaign that hit first on many units and officers from the former German Division. Taking nearly 2 months, a great number of witnesses testified on the accusations and the conduct of the Colonel. Many officers, like Generals Fremont, White and Hays and colleagues like Brig. Gen. George J. Stannard of Vermont (who also was at Harper's Ferry) and Col. George L. Willard of the 125th New York, testified most positively on his conduct and efficiency; and several officers and enlisted men from his regiment concurred with this view. Nonetheless the prosecution witnesses like the regiment's Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Repetti (who was accused by D'Utassy and others in response) and several officers and men testified against him and confirmed the charges and accusations. On May 27 the verdict was sentenced and directly approved by President Abraham Lincoln. While he was found not guilty on the charge of \\"Advising and persuading a soldier to desert\\" he was found guilty of \\"Unlawfully selling and disposing of Government horses for his own benefit\\" in two out of three specifications. More importantly, he was found guilty of \\"Conduct prejudicial to good order and military discipline\\" by unlawfully opening post, selling the position of Major in his regiment to a fellow officer, forging muster rolls, and forging accounts to fraudulently receive several thousand dollars. D'Utassy was sentenced: Postbellum life With this verdict he was discharged from the United States Volunteers on May 29, 1863. While newspapers like the New York Times (that was related to the regiment from its first hour) were generally portraying him in a good light, others, like the New York Tribune, did not and used his case as prejudiced verdict against immigrants. The place where he was to be confined was the famous Sing Sing Prison in Ossining, New York. Arriving at the prison with a great media presence it is alleged that, when asking for a better treatment, he told a guard, \\"I speak twelve languages!\\" to which the guard dryly replied, \\"Here in Sing-Sing we only speak one and we want very little of that.\\" After his release, Frederick D'Utassy was the owner of a portrait studio, and later worked as an insurance agent and importer with some success. He reportedly was a 33rd degree Freemason. Living in New York City for many years, he later moved to Baltimore, Maryland. On May 5, 1892, he was found unconscious in his gas filled hotel room in Wilmington, Delaware. D'Utassy was brought to a nearby hospital where he died later in the day in the presence of his siblings. He was buried at Loudon Park Cemeteryhttps://www.findagrave.com/memorial/9912540 in Baltimore, and was outlived by his widow and son. He also was the namesake of his brother Anton's son, George D'Utassy.

Sanmaur was incorporated into the city of La Tuque in 2003.  History  This village was established in 1914 by the company responsible for the construction of the La Loutre Dam.The first infrastructure was built on La Loutre rapids, in 1916-1917. The Shawinigan Water and Power Company decided to raise the level of the reservoir in 1948. It was also decided to divert the headwaters of two rivers flowing naturally to the James Bay and make them discharge into the St. Lawrence River through the Saint-Maurice River. These two rivers are M√©giscane river and Suzie river. A series of dams and canals were necessary to enable to derive the waters of these rivers. Sanmaur was supported in 1940 by the Brown Corporation, a logging company operating in Mauricie. Sanmaur is located on the banks of the Saint-Maurice River in front of Wemotaci and near the mouth of the Manouane River.  Geography  Sanmaur is located in the forest on the west bank of the Saint-Maurice River in front of Wemotaci and south of the mouth of Manouane River. A bridge spans the Saint-Maurice River, connecting Sanmaur and Wemotaci, built downstream of an island measuring 2.4 km long and 0.65 km maximum width. This bridge is located 5.5 km upstream of the dam falls Allard. Sanmaur is located along Forest Road 25, which goes to the west along the south shore of Manouane River (La Tuque). At one kilometer west of Sanmaur, the road linking Parent and Wemotaci crosses a bridge over the Manouane River and joins Route 25. Sanmaur and Wemotaci are located 65 km (measured by water) downstream of the Gouin Reservoir dam.

As of 2016, there are around 4,000 political appointment positions which an incoming administration needs to review, and fill or confirm, of which about 1,200 require Senate confirmation. These positions are published in the United States Government Policy and Supporting Positions (the Plum Book), a new edition of which is released after each United States presidential election.  Types  There are four basic categories of political appointments: * Presidential appointments with Senate confirmation (PAS): These positions require a congressional hearing and a confirmation vote of the full Senate under the Appointments Clause of the United States Constitution.NLRB v. SW General, Inc., no. 15-1251 (March 21, 2017) (U.S. Supreme Court) As at 2016, PAS positions included 1,212 senior positions, including the Cabinet secretaries and their subordinates at the Deputy Secretary, Under Secretary, and Assistant Secretary levels; the heads of most independent agencies; and ambassadors. It also includes United States Attorneys and United States Marshals. The Presidential Appointment Efficiency and Streamlining Act of 2011 reclassified about 170 PAS positions to PA, to no longer needing Senate confirmation.Obama signs bill giving him more power over appointments * Presidential appointments without Senate confirmation (PA): These appointments do not require a Senate hearing or vote. As at 2016, there were 353 PA positions, most of which were in the Executive Office of the President. * Non-career Senior Executive Service (NA): The Senior Executive Service (SES) forms the level just below the presidential appointees. While the SES largely consists of career officials, up to 10%, or (as of 2016) 680 positions, can be political appointees. * Schedule C appointments (SC): Schedule C appointees serve in confidential or policy roles immediately subordinate to other appointees. As of 2016, there are 1,403 Schedule C appointees. Unlike the presidential appointments, the non-career SES and Schedule C appointments tend to be made within each agency and then approved by the Office of Presidential Personnel.  Ethics restrictions  Political appointees, referring broadly to anyone appointed by the President, the Vice President, or agency head, are subject to more ethics restrictions than regular executive-branch employees. There are two categories of appointees, and each category is subject to additional and slightly different ethics restrictions. * The spoils system/patronage system is a practice where a political party, after winning an election, gives government jobs to its supporters, friends and relatives as a reward for working toward victory, and as an incentive to keep working for the party as opposed to a merit system, where offices are awarded on the basis of some measure of merit independent of political activity. * The merit system is the process of promoting and hiring government employees based on their ability to perform a job, rather than on their political connections. It is the opposite of the spoils system. A common conception of the federal government's merit system principles is that they are designed to ensure fair and open recruitment and competition and employment practices free of political influence or other non-merit factors. Although that is certainly true, a closer reading of those principles suggests a much broader policy objective that relates directly to managing the ongoing performance of the federal workforce. Political appointees are required to take an ethics pledge not to accept gifts from lobbyists. This is because of Executive Order 13490 Under Section 102 of Executive Order 12674, political appointees who are appointed by the president are not allowed to receive any income from outside employment or activities. Exceptions to the gift rule include: * Title 3 U.S.C. ¬ß105 or 3 U.S.C. ¬ß107(a) positions whose basic pay is below GS-9 on the U.S. civil service pay scale * Positions within a White House operating unit that is designated as not normally subject to change as a result of a presidential transition * Positions within the uniformed services * U.S. Foreign Service positions that do not require Senate confirmation Political appointees sometimes attempt to transfer to a career position in the competitive service, excepted service, or Senior Executive Service. This practice, known as \\"burrowing in\\", is desired by employees due to increased pay and job security, as career positions do not end when a presidential administration changes. As these appointed positions are selected noncompetitively, while career employees are supposed to be selected on the basis of merit and without political influence, these conversions are subject to extra scrutiny. Since 2010, such conversions require advance approval from OPM, and the Government Accountability Office (GAO) periodically audits the conversions. In 2008, members of Congress criticized the Department of Homeland Security and Department of Justice for improperly allowing political employees to convert to career positions. History In the politics of the United States, the system of political appointments comes from a history of the spoils system (also known as a patronage system) which is a practice where a political party, after winning an election, gives government jobs to its supporters, friends and relatives as a reward for working toward victory. The term was derived from the phrase \\"to the victor belong the spoils\\" by New York Senator William L. Marcy, referring to the victory of the Jackson Democrats in the election of 1828, with the term \\"spoils\\" meaning goods or benefits taken from the loser in a competition, election or military victory. Though it is commonly assumed that the patronage system in the United States first came into general use during Andrew Jackson's presidency, it actually has an older history. President Thomas Jefferson, a Democratic-Republican, favored a policy of keeping rival Federalists out of government. The patronage system thrived in the U.S. federal government until 1883. In 1820 Congress limited federal administrators to four-year terms, which led to constant turnover; by the 1860s and the Civil War, patronage had led to widespread inefficiency and political corruption. Although it used to be confined to cabinet positions, department heads, and foreign ambassadorships, by the 1860s patronage had spread to low-level government positions. This meant that when the incumbent political party lost a presidential election, the federal government underwent wholesale turnover. On July 2, 1881, Charles J. Guiteau, a disaffected and mentally unstable political office seeker, assassinated President James Garfield. This highlighted how much the patronage problem had gotten out of control, and shifted public opinion, convincing the United States that the President of the United States had more important things to do than to engage in patronage. Congress was eventually spurred to pass the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which created a Civil Service Commission and advocated a merit system for selecting government employees. In addition, passage of the Hatch Act of 1939 forbade the intimidation or bribery of voters and restricted political campaign activities by federal employees. It prohibited using any public funds designated for relief or public works for electoral purposes. It forbade officials paid with federal funds from using promises of jobs, promotion, financial assistance, contracts, or any other benefit to coerce campaign contributions or political support, which restricted most partisan political activities of federal employees. By 1980, 90% of federal positions had become part of the civil service system, which lead to state and local governments to employed large patronage systems. Big- city political machines in places such as New York City, Boston, and Chicago thrived in the late nineteenth century. Being as a patronage system not only rewarded political supporters for past support, it also encouraged future support, because persons who have a patronage job would try to retain it by campaigning for the party at the next election. Large-scale patronage systems declined steadily during the twentieth century. During the Progressive Era (1900‚Äì1920), \\"good government\\" reformers overthrew political machines and installed civil service systems. Chicago, under Mayor Richard J. Daley, remained the last bastion of patronage, existing in its purest form until the late 1970s. In today's more observant standards, politicians wanted to pull away from the negative intonation of the name casting of Patronage, and Spoil system which led them to rename the process ‚ÄúPolitical Appointments‚Äù. Issues The United States has more political appointees in government than any other industrialized democracy in the world. Even though the United States has one of the largest populations of political appointees in the system, the efficiency of political appointees is constantly shifting. Political appointees are engraved in everyday decisions even making the final call on major events. As of 2013, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services was lacking a Senate-confirmed administrator since 2006 when Marilyn Tavenner was acting administrator. At least 60 positions for appointment remain vacant and 45 positions have remained vacant for more than a year. Judicial vacancies have also become a problem as well with numerous open seats for circuit and district judges left to be filled. At the conclusion of President Obama's first term, thirteen percent of presidential-appointee positions had not been filled. Political appointees also come under heat for their own actions including Ben Bernanke's involvement with private banks and also Michael Brown's involvement in Hurricane Katrina. One study published in the Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory by Nick Gallo and David Lewis evaluated more than 350 managers with a program assessment rating tool (\\"PART\\") to determine efficacy and found that programs run by political appointees tended to be less effective. Furthermore, those with previous government experience or appointees who had not worked for a political campaign tended be more effective than appointees with experience in the business or non-profit sectors. Gallo and Lewis stated that they thought careerist and appointees should work in a balanced atmosphere to be more productive and share skills. Professional rapport between careerists and appointees is considered in a study of presidential environmental appointees by Matthew Auer. Auer found that oft-mentioned problems in the appointment system, such as short time-in-office and lack of government experience were less pronounced among top federal environmental appointees, across both Republican and Democratic administrations.

It is lined with tall white Victorian classical architecture residential buildings. It is half of one large block south of the closing section of the Great Western Main Line that leads into London Paddington station. History=Etymology Successive heads of the Porchester manor, Hampshire-seated Thistlewaites were foremost of three to four co-trustees of the Bishop of London's majority landholding of Paddington. This was throughout conversion from agricultural dominance to controlled urban housing: before 1750 until building began on this particular plot in 1850. Their manor was agreed as acceptable for three roads that survive and Portchester Square at the time. Development Eight building firms were used, resulting in slightly different exteriors of the large houses (now internally all converted into flats). Classical features are: *porticoed steps to the front doors *sash windows *first floor juliet balconies with wrought iron railings *multiple cornices *roofline balustrades. The front of houses on the northern side back onto the square without an intervening road. In the manner of at least three others it fronts a road, which due to a differently street-named line of buildings opposite can be deemed to have two names. The houses on the south side, keeping their fa√ßades and much of their internal structure, have been incorporated into an award-winning wider private development of flats and commercial premises since the mid-1970s, The Colonnades. This development was one of the first major projects of architects whose status later grew, Sir Terry Farrell and Sir Nicholas Grimshaw.Terry Farrell & Company (Master Architect Series I), 2001, Farrell, T. Images Publishing Group Pty Ltd at Chapter 26: The Colonnades The central gardens of the square which are open to the public. It has large, well-rooted, tall London Plane trees (Platanus x hispanica), flowering cherry trees, extensive lawns, colourful flower beds and a children's playground. Begun in 1850 and completed between 1855 and 1858, the square was one of the last areas of Bayswater and Westbourne built. The dominant architect was George Wyatt, but the final word on both the general layout and the architectural detail was with George Gutch who in 1822 as surveyor of Bishop of London's then intrinsically Paddington lands reviewed and ratified all developments. At the outset of building the area was considered in the parish and soon the Metropolitan Borough of Paddington. In 1965 the authority became the City of Westminster which took the borough as its northern part, dissolving it. The architectural facades of the classical terrace, facing onto Porchester Square Garden, were carefully refurbished in 2020 by Westminster City Council. Recognition with protection In the mainstream, initial category for protection and recognition are the original two sides which survive. These are the north (‚Ññs9 to 31) and east (‚Ññs1 to 8).

He is the founder of the controversial New Independent Fundamental Baptist movement, and has received international notoriety and condemnation for praying for the death of public figures including former U.S. president Barack Obama and Caitlyn Jenner, and advocating the death penalty for homosexuals. Anderson has also received media attention for publishing a documentary titled Marching to Zion, which the Anti-Defamation League described as being antisemitic. He has been banned from many countries, including Jamaica, Canada, the Schengen Area which is made up of 22 of the 27 European Union countries, the Republic of Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand. Early life Anderson was born in 1981 in Sacramento, California, and attended Woodcreek High School, a public school in Roseville. He has been involved in Independent Baptist ministry since age 18 when he traveled to Europe to proselytize. Faithful Word Baptist Church Anderson established Faithful Word Baptist Church as a fundamentalist Independent Baptist church in Tempe, Arizona, on Christmas Day in December 2005 and remains its pastor. The church describes itself as \\"an old-fashioned, independent, fundamental, King James Bible‚Äìonly, soul-winning Baptist church.\\" Members of the church meet in an office space that is located inside a strip mall. YouTube videos Anderson has created numerous videos on YouTube to promote his beliefs. J.D. Hall of Pulpit & Pen has suggested that his online presence may be a major contributing factor to the pastor's notoriety, while noting that \\"Anderson's 'success' is not due merely to the phenomenon of social media influence.\\" In March 2015, Anderson produced a documentary titled Marching to Zion, in which he argued that the anticipated Jewish messiah is the Antichrist, the Star of David is, in fact, the Star of Remphan, and the Talmud is blasphemous. In May 2015, he posted a YouTube video, titled The Holocaust Hoax Exposed, promoting Holocaust denial. Legal issues and controversies Anderson has been banned from numerous countries and has been arrested. Although he has advocated criminalization of homosexuality and abortion, the Southern Poverty Law Center describes him as a proponent of anti-government views. Anderson operates a website titled True Sons of Liberty where he recommends elimination of the Internal Revenue Service, the Federal Reserve Bank, the Social Security Administration, and child protective services. He has appeared on InfoWars on numerous occasions, and the InfoWars store used to offer for sale video productions by Anderson. In a 2016 video, Anderson explained that he used to be a supporter of Alex Jones but now denounces him. Border Patrol checkpoint incident Anderson made national news following a confrontation with United States Border Patrol agents at an interior checkpoint on Interstate 8, about 70 miles (110 km) east of Yuma, Arizona. He refused to move his car or roll down his windows, triggering a 90-minute standoff and the calling of Arizona Department of Public Safety officers to the scene. The confrontation ended when authorities broke Anderson's car windows, tased him, forced him out of the vehicle, and beat him while he was lying prone on the ground.J.J. Hensley, Tempe pastor says border agents stopped, beat him, Arizona Republic (April 17, 2009). At his arraignment on April 2009, Anderson pleaded not guilty to two misdemeanor counts of resisting a lawful order. He was acquitted of the two charges by a jury in August 2010. In 2015, Anderson created a documentary style video about the 2009 incident titled Failure to Obey and published it on YouTube. Why I Hate Barack Obama sermon The church received national attention in the United States in August 2009, when Anderson was reported to have delivered a sermon--entitled Why I Hate Barack Obama--in which he said he prayed for the death of the president.Felten, David; Procter-Murphy, Jeff (2012). Living the Questions: The Wisdom of Progressive Christianity. HarperCollins , Blewett, James (2010). Can I Get Baptized in Fruit Punch? Tate Publishing, Wright, John (2011). The Obama Haters: Behind the Right-Wing Campaign of Lies, Innuendo & Racism. Potomac Books, John Avlon. (2010). Wingnuts: How the Lunatic Fringe is Hijacking America. Beast Books, Anderson did not solicit the killing of President Obama but he did suggest that the country would \\"benefit\\" from his death. Anderson told local television station KNXV-TV that he would like it if Obama were to die of natural causes because he does not \\"want him to be a martyr\\" and \\"we don't need another holiday.\\" He told columnist Michelangelo Signorile that he \\"would not judge or condemn\\" anyone who killed the president. Anderson's invective against Obama stems in part from his opposition to Obama's support for abortion rights. Anderson was then the recipient of death threats while a group, People Against Clergy Who Preach Hate, organized a \\"love rally\\" which was attended by approximately one hundred people outside the church. The day after Anderson delivered his Why I Hate Barack Obama sermon, a church member, Chris Broughton, carried an AR-15 semiautomatic rifle and a pistol to the Phoenix Convention Center, where President Obama was speaking. Broughton explained that he was not motivated by the sermon although he agreed with it. The New Mexico Independent reported that Broughton's appearance at the rally was part of a publicity stunt that was organized by conservative radio talk show host Ernest Hancock, who also came to the rally armed, and engaged in a staged interview with Broughton which was later broadcast on YouTube. Anderson told ABC News affiliate KNXV-TV in Phoenix that the Secret Service contacted him after this event. Travel bans Anderson has been banned from many countries, including every English- speaking developed country other than the United States, his home country; and most English-speaking African countries. In September 2016, after he had announced his intention to travel to South Africa, Malusi Gigaba, the Minister for Home Affairs banned Anderson and his followers, citing the Constitution of South Africa and stating \\"I have identified Steven Anderson as an undesirable person to travel to South Africa\\". Anderson was also banned from entering the United Kingdom, leading him to change his travel route to Botswana by flying via Ethiopia. On September 20, 2016, he was banned and deported from Botswana. In a YouTube video, Anderson mentioned a planned missionary trip to Malawi to set up a church there. But Malawian authorities subsequently made it known that he would not be welcome in the country and that he would also be banned from entering it in the future. Anderson was denied entry to Canada on November 10, 2017. On January 29, 2018, Anderson was banned from entering Jamaica. Anderson was scheduled to preach in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, on March 23, 2019. The Dutch government began looking into banning him from entering the Netherlands on April 24, leading to the factual ban from the Netherlands, and the rest of the European Union's Schengen area on May 1. According to the Dutch state secretary, there is \\"no space for discrimination or the encouragement of hate, intolerance or violence in a democratic rechtsstaat like ours\\". As of early May 2019, Anderson is banned from both the European Union's Schengen Area and most recently the Republic of Ireland, which banned him on May 12. On July 23, 2019, Anderson was denied entry to Australia. On August 7, 2019, Anderson was denied entry to New Zealand.http://www.faithfulwordbaptist.org/nz_letter.pdf Personal life Anderson met his wife Zsuzsanna in Munich, Bavaria, by presenting her with a gospel tract. Prior to meeting Anderson, she had been raised Catholic and had become an agnostic as a young adult. After converting Zsuzsanna to fundamentalist baptist Christianity, the couple married in 2000 and, as of September 2019, have eleven children whom they homeschool.

Reid writes that the conflicting viewpoints centred on the issue of historical memory, that is, \\"how the past should be publicly remembered.\\" In 2018, the statue and pedestal were removed on order of the Halifax Regional Council, citing safety concerns and concerns about the statue being vandalized. A committee has been struck by the Council to determine its future disposition. Cornwallis During Cornwallis' term as Governor of Nova Scotia, he oversaw the founding of Halifax and Dartmouth, established the first law courts (court of General Sessions, County Court, and Supreme Court), erected forts at Grand Pre, Chignecto and Halifax, organized a militia of 840 men and established a public school for orphans.

The \\"Foreign Protestants\\" and the Settlement of Nova Scotia: The History of a piece of arrested British Colonial Policy in the Eighteenth Century. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1961 The arrival of Cornwallis in 1749 was during a period of armed resistance by the indigenous MiÍûåkmaq, who objected to the founding of Halifax and the British colonization of MiÍûåkmaÍûåki, their traditional lands. The Mi'kmaq militia executed raids upon British settlements and Cornwallis responded with orders to bring back the scalps of Mi'kmaq persons. The order was not effective and Father Le Loutre's War as it is known now, would continue past the term of Cornwallis, who resigned in 1752 and returned to England. The Mi'kmaq were defeated along with the French and Acadians in the French and Indian War and made peace with the British under the Halifax Treaties. The Mi'kmaq still contest the possession of MiÍûåkmaÍûåki and land claims actions are underway in New Brunswick and elsewhere. Construction Nova Scotia Premier Edgar Nelson Rhodes set up the Cornwallis Memorial Committee in the late 1920s to erect a statue to recognize Edward Cornwallis as the \\"Founder of Halifax\\" and to promote tourism. The statue was made by J. Massey Rhind and unveiled on June 22, 1931, on the 182nd anniversary of Cornwallis' arrival to Halifax as Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia. It was positioned in the center of a paved area within the new Cornwallis Park, across the street from the train station and the new Nova Scotian Hotel. The statue was paid for primarily by Canadian National Railway, which also paid for the statue of the fictional character Evangeline to promote tourism. The statue is a tall bronze on a tall stone pedestal. The statue was modelled on Roman examples of statues of emperors, in a form of triumphalism. The design was deliberate. Archibald MacMechan who served on the Cornwallis Memorial Committee compared the founding of Halifax to that of ancient Rome, praising Cornwallis' \\"sterling manhood\\" and considering him an example to \\"men of English blood the world over [who] are accustomed to give voice to a just pride in the achievements of their race, as a colonizing power...\\" During one of the speeches at the unveiling of the statue, Cornwallis was described as \\"a virile, strong, stand fast face with a touch of sternness in it which is usually to be found in the faces of all men who achieve ‚Äì all leaders of men and all pioneers.\\" The Mi'kmaq militia had executed armed resistance throughout Father Le Loutre's War, preventing the British from establishing a stronghold over Mi'kma'ki. The speeches at the unveiling of the Cornwallis statue played down the Mi'kmaq armed resistance, simply giving passing reference to the Mi'kmaq being obstacles to settlement. Statue controversy Since the 1980s, the most notable advocate for the removal of the Cornwallis statue from a public space has been Daniel N. Paul, author of the book We Were Not the Savages. Paul has suggested renaming the park Donald Marshall Jr. Memorial Park and replacing the statue with one of Donald Marshall Jr., wrongly convicted of murder in his youth and a fighter for the rights of the Mi‚Äôkmaq people. Historian John G. Reid asserts that the statue reflects the imperialist, colonial times of its creators in the early part of the twentieth century. Reid writes that the creation of the statue \\"was governed not by history but by a potent mixture of imperialism, a racially-charged triumphalism based on the savagery-civilization binary, state promotion, and an economic agenda.\\" He writes further, \\"The ideology that had underpinned the raising of the statue had offered a strong and positive answer to any such concerns [of imperialist conquest]- the establishment of Halifax was a triumph of civilization over savagery, and Cornwallis was the city's courageous founder.\\" Reid identifies that Paul's work, along with historians from the 1980s onward, helped to highlight the violence that the British used in the colonizing process. Reid suggests that Paul's work has been part of larger efforts to target Cornwallis in a symbolic manner, \\"representing the broader reality that colonization was not a benign process in which the significance of indigenous people was just that they were an inconvenient obstacle, but rather was an invasion and ‚Äì like all invasions ‚Äì was bitterly resisted.\\" There is also concern about the message the statue sends about Cornwallis. Dr Reid says, ‚ÄúWhen you have somebody on a pedestal in public place of that kind, then what you are doing essentially is validating that person.‚Äù Reid felt that the continued presence of the Cornwallis statue normalized the colonial process. Removal and eventual disposition In April 2017, the city council voted to appoint an expert panel which would include Mi‚Äôkmaq representatives to recommend a way forward to deal with commemorations of Cornwallis in the city. During the Halifax Regional Council meeting, on July 18, 2017, an account from the group called Removing Cornwallis was read by Mayor Mike Savage, with respect to the group's Declaration for a Call to Action. The covered statue on July 15, 2017 On July 1, 2017, a mourning ceremony was held at the Cornwallis statue site in Halifax. It was a ceremony to remember the missing indigenous women. It was disrupted by five members of the Canadian Armed Forces, calling themselves members of the right-wing Proud Boys. The five were suspended from the Forces and the Forces' leadership apologized. The incident was used to amplify Dan Paul's allegations against Cornwallis and to support the argument that, despite the wording of the Halifax Treaties, the Mi'kmaw never surrendered to the British and that Nova Scotia is unceded Mi'kmaq lands. On July 15, a group of protesters arrived at the site with the intention of removing the statue. City of Halifax workers arrived and covered up the statue with a black tarpaulin. The shroud covered the statue for the duration of when the protesters were at the scene. The City crew removed their covering. However, an orange tarpaulin was attached to the statue to obscure it, later that evening. On January 31, 2018, the statue was removed after City Council voted 12‚Äì4 in favour of moving the statue into storage. Both the statue and the stone pedestal on which it stood were placed in storage. On January 28, 2019, a Nova Scotia school teacher was awarded the Governor General's History Awards for her students' proposal to retain the statue in Cornwallis Park. Her proposal was to include the Cornwallis statue among three other statues of Acadian Noel Doiron, Black Nova Scotian Viola Desmond and Mi'kmaw hereditary grand Chief John Denny Jr.. The four statutes would be positioned as if in a conversation with each other, discussing their accomplishments and struggles.https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova- scotia/temma-frecker-cornwallis-statue-project-booker- school-1.4994436https://www.canadashistory.ca/explore/awards/2018-finalists- for-the-governor-general-s-history-award-for-excellence-in-teaching  See also  * List of public art in Halifax, Nova Scotia * Military history of Nova Scotia  References =NotesBibliography    External links  * Lachlin MacKinnon.Commemorative Controversies: Edward Cornwallis, Collective Contention, and Historical Memory.
