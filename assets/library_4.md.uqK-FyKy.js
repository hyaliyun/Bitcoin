These springs may be good places to look for evidence of past life because hot springs can preserve evidence of life forms for a long time. Location is Oxia Palus quadrangle. The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter's HiRISE instrument has taken many images that strongly suggest that Mars has had a rich history of water-related processes. Many features of Mars appear to be created by large amounts of water. That Mars once possessed large amounts of water was confirmed by isotope studies in a study published in March 2015, by a team of scientists showing that the ice caps were highly enriched with deuterium, heavy hydrogen, by seven times as much as the Earth. This means that Mars has lost a volume of water 6.5 times what is stored in today's polar caps. The water for a time would have formed an ocean in the low-lying Mare Boreum. The amount of water could have covered the planet about 140 meters, but was probably in an ocean that in places would be almost 1 mile deep. A major discovery by HiRISE was finding evidence of hot springs. These may have contained life and may now contain well-preserved fossils of life. Recurring slope lineae Seasonal flows on warm Martian slopes (also called recurring slope lineae, recurrent slope lineae and RSL) Dundas, C. et al. 2016. HOW WET IS RECENT MARS? INSIGHTS FROM GULLIES AND RSL. 47th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (2016) 2327.pdf. are thought to be salty water flows occurring during the warmest months on Mars. Indeed, there is much photographic and spectroscopic evidence that water does today flow on parts of Mars. Some researchers have proposed that the flow is aided by the water boiling in thin Martian atmosphere. Boiling water would cause soil particles to bounce and help them to flow down slopes. In a study published in Icarus in 2016, A team, headed by David Stillman, identified 239 locations for recurring slope lineae within Valles Marineris. About half of lineae locations on Mars are in Valles Marineris. It was found that the lengthening of the lineae depends on how the slope is orientated. Lengthening was observed in all seasons inside Valles Marineris. This long active season suggests that there must be an appreciable source of water that supplies the lineae. Calculations show that the lineae are active between minus 27 degrees C and minus 9 degrees C to display the activity observed. Water would do this if it was in a brine having of tens of wt% salt. Although these features were initially thought to be evidence of current water flow, some studies show that little or no water may be involved. An analysis of data from the Mars Odyssey Neutron Spectrometer revealed that the RSL sites do not contain any more water than found at anywhere else at similar latitudes. The authors concluded that RSL are not supplied by large, near-surface briny aquifers. It is still possible with this data that water vapor from deeply buried ice, from the atmosphere, or from small deeply buried aquifers.Wilson, J. et al. 2018. Equatorial locations of water on Mars: Improved resolution maps based on Mars Odyssey Neutron Spectrometer data. Icarus: 299, 148-160. A study published in Nature Geoscience, suggest that very little water is involved in creating recurrent slope lineae because these streaks only occur on steep slopes‚Äîslopes that would allow dry sand and dust to move down. If water were involved, at least some of the lineae would move onto lower slopes. Small amounts of water may start the process however.Dundas, C., et al. 2017. Granular Flows at Recurring Slope Lineae on Mars Indicate a Limited Role for Liquid Water. Nature Geoscience. Nov. 20. . A study spanning 4 Martian years concluded that a dry origin was the most likely cause of the streaks. In the study region, Tivat Crater, rockfall markings faded at the same time as recurrent slope lineae (RSL), suggesting a fading mechanism that acts across the whole crater.

VI Mars Conference, Abstract #3037. Its maximum depth is 2,400 meters and its volume is 562,000km. It was larger than the largest landlocked sea on Earth, the Caspian Sea and contained more water than all the other martian lakes together. The Eridania sea held more than 9 times as much water as all of America's Great Lakes.http://www.sci- news.com/space/mars-eridania-basin-vast-sea-05301.html The upper surface of the lake was assumed to be at the elevation of valley networks that surround the lake; they all end at the same elevation, suggesting that they emptied into a lake.Baker, D., J. Head. 2014. 44th LPSC, abstract #1252 PIA22059 fig1eridaniadepths.jpgMap showing estimated water depth in different parts of Eridania Sea This map is about 530 miles across. PIA22059 fig1eridaniadepthslabeled.jpgFeatures around Eridania Sea labeled Research with CRISM found thick deposits, greater than 400 meters thick, that contained the minerals saponite, talc-saponite, Fe-rich mica (for example, glauconite- nontronite), Fe- and Mg-serpentine, Mg-Fe-Ca-carbonate and probable Fe- sulphide. The Fe-sulphide probably formed in deep water from water heated by volcanoes. Such a process, classified as hydrothermal may have been a place where life began. Saponite, talc, talc-saponite, nontronite, glauconite, and serpentine are all common on the seafloors on Earth.Cuadros, J. et al. 2013. Crystal-chemistry of interstratified Mg/Fe-clay minerals from seafloor hydrothermal sites. Chem. Geol. 360‚Äì361, 142‚Äì158. The earliest evidence of life on Earth appear in seafloor deposits that are similar to those found in the Eridania basin. So, samples of material from the Eridania may give us insight into the environment of the early Earth. Chloride deposits were found where a shoreline existed. They were deposited as water evaporated from the sea. These chloride deposits are thought to be thin (less than 30 meters), because some craters do not display the chemical in their ejecta. A crater's ejecta contains material from under the surface, therefore if the chloride deposits were very deep they would have appeared in the ejecta. PIA22058 hireseridanaregion.jpgDeep-basin deposits from the floor of Eridania Sea. The mesas on the floor are there because they were protected against intense erosion by deep water/ice cover. CRISM measurements show minerals may be from seafloor hydrothermal deposits. Life may have originated in this sea. PIA22060 hireseridania.jpgDiagram showing how volcanic activity may have caused deposition of minerals on floor of Eridania Sea. Chlorides were deposited along the shoreline by evaporation. Branched channels Research, in the January 2010 issue of Icarus, described strong evidence for sustained precipitation in the area around Valles Marineris. The types of minerals there are associated with water. Also, the high density of small branching channels indicates a great deal of precipitation because they are similar to stream channels on the Earth. Image:Ius Channels.jpgChannels near the rim of Ius Chasma, as seen by HiRISE. The pattern and high density of these channels support precipitation as the source of the water. Location is Coprates quadrangle. Image:Candor Channels.jpgChannels in Candor plateau, as seen by HiRISE. Location is Coprates quadrangle. Click on image to see many small, branched channels which are strong evidence for sustained precipitation. Inverted relief Some places on Mars show inverted relief. In these locations, a stream bed appears as a raised feature, instead of a depression. The inverted former stream channels may be caused by the deposition of large rocks or due to cementation of loose materials. In either case erosion would erode the surrounding land and consequently leave the old channel as a raised ridge because the ridge will be more resistant to erosion. Images below, taken with HiRISE show sinuous ridges that are old channels that have become inverted. In an article published in January 2010, a large group of scientists endorsed the idea of searching for life in Miyamoto Crater because of inverted stream channels and minerals that indicated the past presence of water. Image:Antoniadi Crater Stream Channels.JPGInverted Stream Channels in Antoniadi Crater. Location is Syrtis Major quadrangle.

Image:ESP_024997ridges.jpgPossible inverted stream channels, as seen by HiRISE under HiWish program. The ridges were probably once stream valleys that have become full of sediment and cemented. So, they became hardened against erosion which removed surrounding material. Illumination is from the left (west). ESP 036362 2195inverted.jpgInverted stream channels on crater slope, as seen by HiRISE under HiWish program Location is Diacria quadrangle. Chloride deposits Using data from Mars Global Surveyor, Mars Odyssey and the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, scientists have found widespread deposits of chloride minerals. Some of these chloride deposits have been identified to be a mixture of anhydrous chloride salt and regional basaltic regolith. These are located in the southern highlands of Mars. Usually chlorides are the last minerals to come out of solution. A picture below shows some deposits within the Phaethontis quadrangle. Evidence suggests that the deposits were formed from the evaporation of mineral- enriched waters. Lakes may have been scattered over large areas of the Martian surface. Carbonates, sulfates, and silica should precipitate out ahead of them. Sulfates and silica have been discovered by the Mars Rovers. Places with chloride minerals may have once held various life forms. Furthermore, such areas should preserve traces of ancient life. Evidence of water from chloride deposits in Phaethontis quadrangle. Picture from HiRISE. Layers Rocks on Mars have been found to frequently occur as layers, called strata, in many different places. Columbus Crater is one of many craters that contain layers.Grotzinger, J. and R. Milliken (eds.) 2012. Sedimentary Geology of Mars. SEPM Rock can form layers in a variety of ways. Volcanoes, wind, or water can produce layers. Many places on Mars show rocks arranged in layers. Scientists are happy about finding layers on Mars since layers may have formed under large bodies of water. Layers may be formed by groundwater rising up depositing minerals and cementing sediments. The hardned layers are consequently more protected from erosion. This process may occur instead of layers forming under lakes. Sometimes the layers display different colors. Light-toned rocks on Mars have been associated with hydrated minerals like sulfates. The Mars Rover Opportunity examined such layers close-up with several instruments. Some layers are probably made up of fine particles because they seem to break up into fine dust. In contrast, other layers break up into large boulders so they are probably much harder. Basalt, a volcanic rock, is thought to form layers composed of boulders. Basalt has been identified all over Mars. Instruments on orbiting spacecraft have detected clay (also called phyllosilicates) in some layers. Scientists are excited about finding hydrated minerals such as sulfates and clays on Mars because they are usually formed in the presence of water. Places that contain clays and/or other hydrated minerals would be good places to look for evidence of life. More research using data collected by the SHARAD (SHAllow RAdar Detector) on the MRO has found layers of ice-water interspersed with dirt at the northern pole under the Planum Boreum. The layering is believed to have come from the global warming and cooling cycle on Mars; during cooling periods, water migrated to the poles and formed the ice-water layers, while on subsequent warming, the unthawed ice water was covered by layers of dust and dirt from windstorms on the surface, helping to preserve the ice water. Below are a few of the many examples of layers that have been studied with HiRISE. Image:ESP 025609layers.jpgLayers under cap rock of a pedestal crater, as seen by HiRISE under HiWish program.

Mantle Much of the surface of Mars is covered by a thick smooth mantle that is thought to be a mixture of ice and dust. This ice-rich mantle, a few yards thick, smoothes the land. But in places it displays a bumpy texture, resembling the surface of a basketball. Because there are few craters on this mantle, the mantle is relatively young. It‚Äôs generally accepted that mantle is ice-rich dust that fell from the sky as snow and ice-coated dust grains during a different climate One evidence of its ice-rich nature is the presence of gullies which form when some of the ice melts.Schon, S. and J. Head. 2011.

Ring mold craters Ring Mold Craters are kind of crater on the planet Mars, that look like the ring molds used in baking. They are thought to be caused by an impact into ice. The ice is covered by a layer of debris. They are found in parts of Mars that have buried ice. Laboratory experiments confirm that impacts into ice result in a \\"ring mold shape.\\" Impacts into ice warm the ice and cause it to flow into the ring mold shape. , File:Ringmolddiagramlabeled.jpgRing-mold craters form when an impact goes through to an ice layer. The rebound forms the ring-mold shape, and then dust and debris settle on the top to insulate the ice.

Gullies  Changes in Mars's orbit and tilt cause significant changes in the distribution of water ice from polar regions down to latitudes equivalent to Texas. During certain climate periods water vapor leaves polar ice and enters the atmosphere. The water returns to the ground at lower latitudes as deposits of frost or snow mixed generously with dust. The atmosphere of Mars contains a great deal of fine dust particles.Head, J. et al. 2008. Formation of gullies on Mars: Link to recent climate history and insolation microenvironments implicate surface water flow origin. PNAS: 105. 13258-13263. Water vapor condenses on the particles, then they fall down to the ground due to the additional weight of the water coating. When ice at the top of the mantling layer goes back into the atmosphere, it leaves behind dust, which insulates the remaining ice.MLA NASA/Jet Propulsion Laboratory (2003, December 18). Mars May Be Emerging From An Ice Age. ScienceDaily. Retrieved February 19, 2009, from https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2003/12/031218075443.htmAds by GoogleAdvertise HiRISE has carried out many observations of gullies that are assumed to have been caused by recent flows of liquid water. Many gullies are imaged over and over to see if any changes occur. Some repeat observations of gullies have displayed changes that some scientists argue were caused by liquid water over the period of just a few years. Others say the flows were merely dry flows. These were first discovered by the Mars Global Surveyor. Alternate theories for the creation of surface gullies and channels include wind erosion, liquid carbon dioxide, and liquid methane. Observations with HiRISE show widespread activity in southern hemisphere gullies, especially in those that appear fresh. Significant channel incision and large-scale mass movements have been seen.Dundas, C., S. Diniega, A. McEwen. 2015. Long-term monitoring of martian gully formation and evolution with MRO/HiRISE.

IN-DEPTH REGIONAL ASSESSMENT OF THERMOPHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF ACTIVE GULLIES ON MARS. 46th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference. 2009.pdf The timing of gully activity is seasonal and happens during the period when seasonal frost is present and defrosting. Observations over the past few years support a model in which currently active gully formation is driven mainly by seasonal CO2 frost. Simulations described in a 2015 conference, show that high pressure CO2 gas trapping in the subsurface can cause debris flows. The conditions that can lead to this are found in latitudes where gullies occur.C. Pilorget, C., F. Forget. 2015. \\"CO2 Driven Formation of Gullies on Mars.\\" 46th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference. 2471.pdf This research was described in a later article entitled, \\"Formation of gullies on Mars by debris flows triggered by CO2 sublimation.\\" In the model, CO2 ice accumulates in the cold winter. It piles up on a frozen permafrost layer that consists of ice-cemented dirt. When the higher intensity sunlight of spring begins, light penetrates the translucent dry ice layer, consequently warming the ground. The CO2 ice absorbs heat and sublimates‚Äîthat is changes directly from a solid to a gas. This gas builds up pressure because it is trapped between the ice and the frozen ground. Eventually, pressure builds up enough to explode through the ice taking with it soil particles. The dirt particles mix with the pressurized gas and act as a fluid that can flow down the slope and carve gullies.CNRS. \\"Gullies on Mars sculpted by dry ice rather than liquid water.\\" ScienceDaily.

Glaciers Glaciers, loosely defined as patches of currently or recently flowing ice, are thought to be present across large but restricted areas of the modern Martian surface, and are inferred to have been more widely distributed at times in the past.\\"The Surface of Mars\\" Series: Cambridge Planetary Science (No. 6) Michael H. Carr, United States Geological Survey, Menlo Park Lobate convex features on the surface known as viscous flow features and lobate debris aprons, which show the characteristics of non-Newtonian flow, are now almost unanimously regarded as true glaciers.Milliken, R. E., J. F. Mustard, and D. L. Goldsby. \\"Viscous flow features on the surface of Mars: Observations from high- resolution Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) images.\\" Journal of Geophysical Research 108.E6 (2003): 5057.D.M.H.

Marchant Flow patterns of lobate debris aprons and lineated valley fill north of Ismeniae Fossae, Mars: Evidence for extensive mid-latitude glaciation in the Late Amazonian Icarus, 207 (2010), pp. 186‚Äì209 However, a variety of other features on the surface have also been interpreted as directly linked to flowing ice, such as fretted terrain,Lucchitta, Baerbel K. \\"Ice and debris in the fretted terrain, Mars.\\" Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth 89.S02 (1984): B409-B418. lineated valley fill, concentric crater fill, and arcuate ridges. A variety of surface textures seen in imagery of the midlatitudes and polar regions are also thought to be linked to sublimation of glacial ice. Radar from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter gave a strong reflection from the top and base of LDAs, meaning that pure water ice made up the bulk of the formation (between the two reflections).http://www.planetary.brown.edu/pdfs/3138.pdf Because the surfaces of lobate debris flows, concentric crater fill, and lineated valley flows look similar, its assumed that all may contain water ice under a relatively thin layer of insulating debris. File:25246brainseroding.jpgClosed-cell brain terrain, as seen by HiRISE under the HiWish program. This type of surface is common on lobate debris aprons, concentric crater fill, and lineated valley fill. The possibility of water ice in LDAs and other glacial features demonstrates that water is found at even lower latitudes. Future colonists on Mars will be able to tap into these ice deposits, instead of having to travel to much higher latitudes. Another major advantage of these glacial landscapes over other sources of Martian water is that they can easily detected and mapped from orbit. Lobate debris aprons are shown below from the Phlegra Montes, which are at latitude of 38.2 degrees north, so the discovery of water ice in LDAs greatly expands the range of easily available on Mars. It is far easier to land a spaceship near the equator of Mars, so the closer water is available to the equator the better it will be for future colonists. ;Lobate debris aprons Of interest from the days of the Viking Orbiters are piles of material surrounding cliffs; they are now called lobate debris aprons (LDAs). These features have a convex topography and a gentle slope from cliffs or escarpments; this suggests flow away from the steep source cliff. In addition, lobate debris aprons can show surface lineations just as rock glaciers on the Earth.

The scientists found eight eroding slopes showing exposed water ice sheets as thick as 100 meters. Much evidence of buried ice under the ground on vast regions of Mars has already been found by past studies, but this study found that the ice was only covered by a layer of about 1 or 2 meters thick of soil.Steep Slopes on Mars Reveal Structure of Buried Ice.

These triangular depressions bare some resemblance to scalloped terrain. Scalloped topography is common in the mid-latitudes of Mars, between 45¬∞ and 60¬∞ north and south. However scalloped terrain, displays a gentle equator-facing slope and is rounded. Scarps discussed here have a steep pole-facing side. For several reasons, the ice- rich clifts (scarps) are suspected to be ground ice instead of thin, temporary frost. Their blue color stays even after seasonal frost, indicated by blue color, has disappeared from the surroundings and from higher, colder locations. Also, Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS) measurements show a temperature in the late-afternoon that is above the frost point. This means that any frost would have melted in the heat of the day. \\"There is shallow ground ice under roughly a third of the Martian surface,\\" said the study's lead author, Colin Dundas of the U.S. Geological Survey's Astrogeology Science Center in Flagstaff, Arizona. \\" This image confirms what was previously detected with the spectrometer on 2001 Mars Odyssey, the ground-penetrating radars on MRO and on Mars Express, and by the Phoenix lander in situ excavation. The Phoenix lander actually exposed an ice layer with its landing rockets.Mellon, M., et al. 2009. The periglacial landscape at the Phoenix landing site. Journal of Geophys. Res. 114. E00E07 Besides being of immense value to future explorers, these ice layers could help us better understand the climate history of Mars. They provide a record of the past. Since Mars experiences great variations in its tilt, it also goes through dramatic climate variations. These changes may be able to be tracked with study of these layers. Mars does not possess a large moon to keep its tilt stable. Today, ice is concentrated at the poles, with a greater tilt, more ice will exist at mid-latitudes. Scalloped topography Scalloped topography is common in the mid-latitudes of Mars, between 45¬∞ and 60¬∞ north and south. It is particularly prominent in the region of Utopia Planitia in the northern hemisphere and in the region of Peneus and Amphitrites Patera in the southern hemisphere. Such topography consists of shallow, rimless depressions with scalloped edges, commonly referred to as \\"scalloped depressions\\" or simply \\"scallops\\". Scalloped depressions can be isolated or clustered and sometimes seem to coalesce. A typical scalloped depression displays a gentle equator- facing slope and a steeper pole-facing scarp. This topographic asymmetry is probably due to differences in insolation. Scalloped depressions are thought to form from the removal of subsurface material, possibly interstitial ice, by sublimation. This process may still be happening at present.http://hiroc.lpl.arizona.edu/images/PSP?diafotizo.php?ID=PSP_002296_1215 ESP 037461 2255scallopstop.jpgScalloped ground, as seen by HiRISE under HiWish program.

Ice in craters Research, reported in the journal Science in September 2009, demonstrated that some new craters on Mars show exposed, pure, water ice. After a time, the ice disappears, evaporating into the atmosphere. The ice is only a few feet deep. The ice was confirmed with the Compact Imaging Spectrometer (CRISM) on board the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO). The ice was found in five locations. Three of the locations are in the Cebrenia quadrangle. These locations are 55.57¬∞ N, 150.62¬∞ E; 43.28¬∞ N, 176.9¬∞ E; and 45¬∞ N, 164.5¬∞ E. Two others are in the Diacria quadrangle: 46.7¬∞ N, 176.8¬∞ E and 46.33¬∞ N, 176.9¬∞ E.http://nasa.gov/mission/MRO/news/mro20090924.html This discovery proves that future colonists on Mars will be able to obtain water from a wide variety of locations. The ice can be dug up, melted, then taken apart to provide fresh oxygen and hydrogen for rocket fuel. Hydrogen is the powerful fuel used by the space shuttle main engines.

These group of rings or cones are suspected to be caused by lava flowing over water ice or ground containing water ice. The ice quickly changes to steam which blows out a ring or cone. Here the kink in the chain may have been caused by the lava changing direction. Some of the forms do not have the shape of rings or cones because maybe the lava moved too quickly; thereby not allowing a complete cone shape to form.  Columnar jointing  Columnar jointing in basalt, Marte Vallis In 2009, HiRISE discovered columnar jointing in rocks on Mars. Such jointing is accepted as having involved water. To make the parallel cracks of columnar jointing, more cooling is necessary, and water is the most logical choice. Scientists calculate that the water was present intermittently for a few months to a few years.  Light-toned layered deposits  HiRISE has sent back many images of large surface areas that are termed \\"light-toned layered deposits.\\" These 30‚Äì80 meter thick deposits are thought to have been formed from the action of water. They contain evidence of stream channel systems. Furthermore, chemical data from the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer orbiting the planet have shown water related mineral forms: opal (hydrated silica) and iron sulfates. These can be formed from the action of low temperature acid solutions reacting with basaltic rocks. These features of light-toned layered deposits strongly suggest that there was long lasting precipitation and surface runoff during the Hesperian epoch of Martian history.

It includes not simply artists from Olot (in Catalonia, Spain), but all artists whose artworks were inspired by the countryside of Olot. By extension, artists connected with Olot and its comarca, Garrotxa.  History  In Catalonia, the proliferation of painting coincided with the Restoration, a period marked by economic prosperity that favored the bourgeoisie which was the motor of the cultural renaissance of Catalan nationalism. This bourgeoisie had considerable influence in the arts; it sought art that was realistic, but simultaneously pleasing, elegant, and optimistic, and preferred painting over other artistic disciplines. During this period, several schools of art began and were consolidated, among them the Olot school. The Olot school of landscape painting is similar to the Barbizon school. It was formed by Joaquim and Marian Vayreda with the assistance of Ram√≥n Mart√≠ Alsina. From this tradition emerged a new artistic concept: creating multiple versions of the Olot countryside, where the treatment of light and chromatic variations were important elements. The Olot school used the countryside of Garrotxa as a source of inspiration for their work, but with stylistic freedom. Vayreda's paintings attracted the attention of artists including Laure√† Barrau, Enric Galwey, Joan Brull, Llu√≠s Masriera, Modest Urgell, Ramon Casas, and Santiago Rusi√±ol, who went to Olot and also painted depictions of the countryside. Red Sky, by Josep Berga i Boix The Olot school was supported by the founding of the Olot Art School (Escola d'Art d'Olot) in 1783 by bishop Tom√°s de Lorenzana, and also by the creation of workshops dedicated to the reproduction of religious images. The first workshop that was dedicated to this work, \\"El Arte Cristiano\\", was founded in 1880. The industry of religious image making expanded considerably starting around 1900 in Olot, and became an important part of the city's economy. Today, the old Arte Cristiano factory has been converted into the Museum of the Saints (Museo de los Santos). The Olot school was institutionalized by painter Josep Berga i Boix, who served as director of the Olot Artistic and Cultural Center (Centre Art√≠stic-Cultural d'Olot) (founded by Vayreda) in 1869 and later as director of the Public School of Drawing (Escola P√∫blica de Dibuix) from 1877-1914. Annual exhibitions were organized first by the Artistic and Cultural Center and then by other entities. Numerous other artists later continued the traditions of the Olot school, often training at the Public School of Drawing (called the Escola de Belles Arts i Oficis starting in 1939) under the direction of Iv√≥ Pascual, Mart√≠ Casadevall, Bartomeu Mas y Collellmir, and Joan Vil√† i Moncau. Other artists belonging to the movement include Josep Berga i Boada, Josep Clar√†, Melcior Domenge, and Josep Pin√≥s.  The Olot school today  The Drawing Festival (Fira del Dibuix) is celebrated annually in Olot on the Day of Sant Lluc. This festival brings together many artists that sell their works directly to the public. The festival was conceived particularly for the sale of works on paper, such as sketches, but recently it has been possible to find artworks in many media. Since the 2003-2004 academic year, the Olot Art School (Escola d'Art d'Olot) has been called the Superior School of Art and Design (Escola d'Art i Superior de Disseny), adding a degree in interior design; a graphic design degree was added in 2007-2008. Today, there are more than 400 students enrolled, particularly from the neighboring comarcas. Today, the term \\"Olot school\\"--or particularly the term \\"Olot school of landscape painting\\" (\\"escuela paisaj√≠stica de Olot\\" or \\"escola paisatg√≠stica d'Olot\\")--is not well-accepted, because not all artists connected with Olot paint landscapes, and not all the artists connected with the school work or live in the city of Olot.

The village - now surrounded by the city - is still intact, with its leafy trees, cobbled walkways and open views from Salita Bachernia over the Gulf of Genoa, the harbor and the Old City.  History  The convent of Saint Anne was founded in 1584 under the impulse of father Nicol√≤ Doria, who returned from Spain to the Republic of Genoa to establish a monastery twenty years after the reformation of the Carmelite Order operated by Saint Theresa of Avila and Saint John of the Cross. At the time of the foundation, the area was identified by the phytonym Bachernia, a reference to the berries of Rosa Canina (Italian: bacca), which is still used today to name the steep pathway (Italian: salita; Ligurian: cr√™uza) connecting the church to the New Walls. In the 18th century, alongside rural buildings, the first suburban villas were built, including the first nucleus of Villa Madre Cabrini, which is located near the entrance of the church. The area developed into a village with a growing number of inhabitants . The urbanization at the end of the 19th century saw the laying of the so-called Mountain Ringway (Italian: Circonvallazione a Monte) and the high-class Art Nouveau buildings of Corso Magenta and the Sant'Anna funicular being built immediately south of the church, but without affecting the integrity of the ancient hamlet. To this day, Sant'Anna remains an oasis of calm within the city, with its sycamore trees, cobbled paving and beautiful vistas over the old city and the harbor, only few minutes away from the central Corvetto square.  Description  The church features a single nave, several lateral chapels, and a 16th-century portal with a marble relief of the Holy Family. Among the artwork contained in the church, it is worth noting: the large marble statue on the main altar with Saint‚ÄôAnne and Child Mary, made by Francesco Maria Schiaffino; the paintings made by Domenico Fiasella of The Martyrdom of Saint‚ÄôAndreas and The Martyrdom of Saint‚ÄôUrsula; the painting by Agostino Ciampelli of Saint Joseph and the Angel; the painting by Castellino Castello of Jesus and Saint Teresa; and the 16th-century Marriage of the Virgin Mary, attributed to a Spanish-school painter. The frescoes were made in 1882.  The Pharmacy  Immediately after the foundation, the friars established a pharmacy, first mentioned in 1650. The documents recount that father Martinus of Saint‚ÄôAnthony (1638-1721) ‚Äúwent out every day to find the ingredients necessary for the ailments [‚Ä¶] and many came to him, although not everyone was cured by the same type of remedy [‚Ä¶] and, therefore, it was necessary to make different potions, medicines and remedies‚Äù. The records of the pharmacy report the names of the ailments and the clients. The most used preparations were the manna, tablets against teniasis, white sugar, Chinese potions, English salts, cinnamon, poppy flowers and a ‚Äúspirit made of incense, myrrh, aloe and wine‚Äù. Amongst the clients, at the beginning of the 19th century there was the physician Angelo Bruzick, the chirurg Rocco Artisi of Voltri, the consul of Denmark Giuseppe Alessi Morellet, the pharmacy of the Genoese public hospital of Pammatone. Later the pharmacy had contact with the famous and controversial Parisian doctor Louis Le Roy, author of ‚ÄúLa medicina curativa‚Äù published in Naples in 1825 in four volumeshttps://www.erboristeriadeifrati.it/storia/. The pharmacy is still active and known as the \\"Antica Farmacia Sant'Anna\\". It can also be reached using a private elevator from the pedestrian tunnel of the elevator Magenta- Crocco.

It was inspired by an early computer program ELIZA, which attempted to mimic human conversation by use of a script. Visitors to the chatterbot encountered a simple graphic interface: an animated character living in a small, very clean apartment. This was Fred. Visitors could ‚Äútalk‚Äù to Fred by typing questions. Fred would then ‚Äúanswer‚Äù via a program that recognized keywords in the questions and drew responses from a large inventory of pre-scripted replies. To enhance the sense that visitors were talking to a real person, Fred‚Äôs replies were idiosyncratic, informed by a semi-realistic backstory created for the character. Fred claimed to have been recently fired by a media company and was struggling to adjust to his new circumstances. Suffering from depression and insomnia, was often pacing, smoking or drinking and would occasionally pass out drunk. He gave ‚Äúanswers‚Äù that were frequently off-topic due to his variable mood and could be angry, jealous, rude, sad or euphoric during a conversation. He also had a number of sexual issues that he would routinely allude to but refuse to discuss in detail. Fred‚Äôs ‚Äúpersonality‚Äù made him both entertaining and, at times, a believable conversationalist. The chatbot became one of the most popular features of Word and received a large volume of personal email. The staff of Word responded to much of these emails in the ‚Äúvoice‚Äù of Fred, furthering the illusion that Fred was a real person. In 1999, a second installment of Fred's life appeared on Word. It employed the same scripting technology as the first version, but Fred‚Äôs story was updated and his range of ‚Äúanswers‚Äù was expanded. In this \\"episode\\" (for lack of a better term), Fred was no longer in his apartment. Instead, he was working in an office, performing data entry and other clerical tasks. Claiming that the job was ‚Äútemporary,‚Äù he spent much of his time away from his desk‚Äîin the bathroom or office kitchen, pacing and drinking soda, assuring anyone who chatted with him that he would have a new and better job soon. Though he claimed to be happy, his script suggested otherwise, and continued to simulate ‚Äúmood swings.‚Äù When Word Magazine was shut down in 2000, Fred The Webmate, along with the rest of the site, was preserved in the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. Fred The Webmate was conceived, designed and programmed by Word‚Äôs creative director Yoshi Sodeoka with assistance from designer Jason Mohr. Its graphic interface was inspired by the aesthetics of the Commodore 64 computer. The chatterbot's script was written by Sodeoka in collaboration with Marisa Bowe, Naomi Clark, Daron Murphy, and Sabin Streeter. Fred‚Äôs backstory was drawn from the real-life experiences of his creators and their friends and acquaintances during the late 1990s Dot-com bubble.

The Southwest Hockey League (SWHL) was established in 1975 to train players for professional leagues. Ralph Engelstad, a former University of North Dakota Fighting Sioux hockey goaltender, Las Vegas casino owner, construction magnate, and entrepreneur, conceived and financed the SWHL in the early 1970s, along with his younger brother, Richard. Six cities awarded teams were: Albuquerque, New Mexico; Amarillo, Texas; Billings, Montana; Butte, Montana; El Paso, Texas; and Reno, Nevada. The purpose of SWHL was to provide a professional development circuit for young American and Canadian players interested in attending college and playing hockey. It was modeled after a similar system employed by the Canadian National Hockey Team. Teams were responsible for each player‚Äôs room and board, tuition for a local college or university, and a monthly 60 dollar stipend.

The players stayed at a summer camp resort facility in Blaine, Washington and were transported by bus back and forth from the arena in White Rock. 108 players were selected by the six teams. In the end, the SWHL was not financially viable, and was disbanded in January 1977 with 30 games left in the season.

The church, in a dominant position over Piazza Sturla, was built between 1434 and 1435 and is now the home of the parish church of the Deanery of Albaro in the Archdiocese of Genoa. The church was built at the behest of two priests, Pietro Micichero and Domenico Verrucca, who had founded a congregation of secular canons. From 1441 it was officiated by the Canonici di San Giorgio in Alga, popularly called \\"Celestini\\", who remained there until 1668 when the congregation was dissolved by Pope Clement IX. It then passed on to the Order of Saint Augustine, who had to leave in 1797 due to Napoleonic laws which suppressed religious orders.Wikisource:Catholic Encyclopedia (1913)/Suppression of Monasteries in Continental Europe It was then entrusted to secular clergy, becoming a branch of San Martino d'Albaro. It underwent several renovations and expansions, and became a parish in its own right in 1894. In the 1940s the church underwent a major restoration, which involved almost a total renovation of the building. This reconstruction virtually erased the various reconstructions of the Baroque era to bring the building, at least in its essential structure, back to its original fifteenth-century form, although the restoration was undertaken in an interpretive and not scientifically rigorous fashion.S.S. Annunziata di Sturla - La storia The church has three naves, each complete with its own semi-circular apse. The side naves are separated from the central by four columns on each side connected by semicircular arches. The facade was built freely reinterpreting the original style, with two monofora windows (narrow windows with an arched top and single opening), a central rose window and the original slate architrave above the entrance. It contains notable works of art from the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, including a Madonna and Child and Saint Sebastian and Saint Roch (San Rocco). They're of the Venetian school of the sixteenth century. There is also a Madonna and Child and Saint Anthony by Gregorio De Ferrari (1690) and a sixteenth-century fresco, again depicting Saint Sebastian and Saint Roch.

History Before the 1938-39 season there were Northern and Southern leagues in the province. They merged in 1938 to form the one provincial league. The championship team went on in the Allan Cup as Saskatchewan's representative. In 1941 the Regina Rangers won the SSHL's only Allan Cup title. The league carried on through most of World War II but disbanded in 1944-45 because of a shortage of players and the difficulty of travelling. From 1945-46 through 1949-50 senior teams in Regina and Saskatoon joined up with Calgary and Edmonton to form the Western Canada Senior Hockey League (WCSHL). The SSHL lay dormant until 1950 when the WCSHL moved up to the major level and competed for the Alexander Cup. The SSHL was revived for 1950-51, again sending its champions to the Allan Cup playoffs, but only lasted until 1954-55. The Western Hockey League (WHL) operated in the province and the SSHL could not compete. It started up again in 1958-59 after the WHL left the province and operated until 1964-65. In 1965 the teams again merged with teams from Alberta to form a revived Western Canada Senior Hockey League. This new league lasted for two seasons when the teams again split on provincial lines. The SSHL started up again in 1967-68 and lasted until 1971 when another merger formed the Prairie Senior Hockey League.

She creates works primarily in marble and bronze but also in granite and other materials. Examples of her work are in the collections of Clare College, Cambridge, the Courtauld Gallery and the Smithsonian. Amongst her large-scale public works are Family in granite installed in Henry Reuss Federal Plaza in Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Tempesta in marble at The Lancasters, London; and Fortuna in bronze at Canary Wharf, London. A fellow and past vice president of the Royal British Society of Sculptors, Blumenfeld was awarded an Honorary OBE in 2011. She lives in the United Kingdom and works there and in Pietrasanta, in Tuscany in central Italy. Life and career Blumenfeld was born in New York City in 1942 and grew up in Jamaica Estates in the Borough of Queens. Her father was a builder. Her mother, a daughter of Russian √©migr√©s, was a poet and painter. She received her BA and MA from the University of Michigan and then went on to study for her PhD in political philosophy at Columbia University. After completing her doctoral dissertation, John Locke: A Science of Ethics, in 1964, she studied art in Paris at the Acad√©mie de la Grande Chaumi√®re under the sculptor Ossip Zadkine.. She held her first solo exhibition, a group of polished bronzes, in 1966 at the Palais P√°lffy in Vienna. Blumenfeld had met her husband Yorick in a New York bookshop while she was researching her PhD. They married when she was 20 and had two sons. Their elder son Remy, born in 1965, is a television producer. Their younger son Jared became an environmentalist and served as the EPA Administrator for California and the West under the Obama administration. The Blumenfelds moved permanently to Europe in the late 1960s, eventually settling in the Cambridgeshire village of Grantchester in 1970 where Helaine also has her UK studio. A turning point in Blumenfeld's career came with her 1974 visit to Pietrasanta in Italy which eventually led her to add marble as one of her primary mediums. She had originally gone there to do bronze casting, but Alicia Penalba, another sculptor working in Pietrasanta, encouraged her to try sculpting in marble and introduced her to master carver Sem Ghelardini. Blumenfeld joined Ghelardini's Studio Sem and began learning stone-carving. At the time, she was the only woman working in the studio's marble yard. In the ensuing years she travelled back and forth from her Grantchester home to Pietrasanta to continue her work with Ghelardini. It was also in Pietrasanta during the 1970s that she met Henry Moore for the first time. He had come to the town to supervise two large-scale sculptures that Ghelardini was carving for him. In 1985 she had a joint exhibition with Moore entitled A British Dialogue: From Perry Green to Cambridge at New York's Alex Rosenberg Gallery. Twelve of her large-scale sculptures in marble and travertine were shown. By 2013 Blumenfeld's oeuvre had encompassed over 65 commissioned works for public spaces and private collections. The later years of her career have seen several major retrospective exhibitions of her work including those at the Royal British Society of Sculptors (2008), Pietrasanta in the Piazza del Duomo and Chiesa di Sant'Agostino (2011), Salisbury Cathedral (2013), and Bowman Sculpture in London (2015). The London exhibition, entitled Helaine Blumenfeld ‚Äì Henry Moore A Dialogue 1985‚Äì2015, marked the 30th anniversary of her first exhibit with Henry Moore. Hard Beauty, a documentary film on her life and work, was broadcast on Sky Arts in April 2018.  Honours  Blumenfeld was elected a fellow of the Royal British Society of Sculptors in 2000 and from 2004 to 2009 served as the society's vice-president. In 2007 she became the first female recipient of the Premio Pietrasanta nel Mondo. She received an honorary OBE in 2011.

Due to the great trust which the English Crown had in him, he served as Attorney General for Ireland throughout the reign of Charles II (1660-1685). It was during his term of office that the Attorney General emerged as pre-eminent legal adviser to the Crown. While Domville was undoubtedly a loyal subject of the English Crown, in his treatise, \\"A Disquisition Touching that Great Question Whether an Act of Parliament made in England shall bind the People and Kingdom of Ireland\\", he argued for the right of the Irish Parliament to act independently and free from interference by the English Parliament. Although the work was not published in his lifetime, his son-in-law William Molyneux drew on it for his own highly controversial treatise \\"The Case of Ireland's being bound by Acts of Parliament in England, Stated\\", and it is thought to have had considerable influence on later writers including Jonathan Swift.  Background  He was born in Dublin to an ancient Cheshire family. His father Gilbert (1565‚Äì1624) had moved to Ireland where he became Clerk of the Crown, and sat in the Irish House of Commons as member for Kildare County in the Irish Parliament of 1613‚Äì1615. William's mother was Margaret Jones, daughter of Thomas Jones, Archbishop of Dublin, and his wife Margaret Purdon. He was educated at St Albans School, Hertfordshire. He entered Lincoln's Inn, and became a Bencher of the Inn in 1657. He was called to the Bar in 1640, and built up a highly successful practice at the English Bar.Seaward, Paul, ed. Speakers and the Speakership- Presiding Officers and the Management of Business from the Middle Ages to the Twenty-first Century Parliamentary Yearbook Trust 2010 p. 67 Career During the English Civil War, Domville's loyalty to the Crown was never seriously questioned. His decision to practice law in England under the regime of Oliver Cromwell was not unusual, and was not held against him later, as many other Royalists also made their peace with the new regime when the King's cause seemed to be lost. At the Restoration of Charles II he returned to Ireland, and was knighted and made Attorney General. He received a substantial grant of lands at Templeogue, on the outskirts of Dublin city, which remained in the family for centuries. The value of the lands was greatly enhanced by the fact that the River Dodder flows through them, thus giving the Domvilles partial control of the supply of Dublin's drinking water, of which the Dodder was long the principal source. Strictly speaking they had no right to control the supply of water; this power was vested in Dublin Corporation. The River Dodder, which runs through what were then the Domville family's lands. He was elected to Parliament as member for Dublin City, and was the Crown's choice as Speaker. He faced opposition from the able and ambitious Prime Serjeant, Sir Audley Mervyn, who, apparently by spreading the story that Domville was sympathetic to Roman Catholics, gained the support of the majority of MPs (in fact Domville was a strong Protestant). The King, who was anxious to avoid a confrontation with Parliament so early in his reign, stated that the choice should be that of the members, and Mervyn was duly elected Speaker.Hart, A.C. History of the King's Serjeants-at-law in Ireland Four Courts Press Dublin 2000 =Domville's struggle for precedence with Audley Mervyn= The next few years saw a struggle between Domville and Mervyn for the role of principal legal adviser to the Crown. Domville emerged as the winner: both the King and the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde trusted him, whereas Mervyn had a reputation for corruption and his loyalty to the Crown was suspect. From about 1663 onwards Ormonde simply ignored Mervyn, and took legal advice only from Domville.Hart History of the King's Serjeants-at-law This marked the effective end of the Prime Serjeant's role as chief legal adviser to the Crown and the start of the supremacy of the Attorney General. Domville was heavily involved in advising on the drafting of the Act of Settlement 1662, although he argued that his proper task was to \\"criticise\\" the Bill, rather than to draft itKelly, James Poyning's Law and the Making of Law in Ireland 1660‚Äì1800 Dublin Four Courts Press 2008 (the present practice is that the Attorney General of Ireland both \\"criticises\\" i.e. advises on any legal difficulties with a Bill, and also oversees the drafting, which is done by his officials).Casey, James The Irish Law Officers Round Hall Press Dublin 1996 =Last years= After the death of Charles II, Domville was retained in office briefly by James II before being replaced by Richard Nagle. He was a staunch Protestant, and it has been argued that he was seen as an obstacle to the aggressively pro-Catholic policy of the new regime; on the other hand he may have been quite happy to retire, in view of his advanced age.The Protestant Magazine London 1841 Vol. 3 p.224 He died in July 1689 and was buried in St. Patrick's Cathedral. Political views He was the author of an unpublished treatise entitled: A Disquisition Touching That Great Question Whether an Act of Parliament Made in England shall bind the People and Kingdom of Ireland without their Allowance and Acceptance of such Act. Despite his loyalty to the Crown, the views he expressed there on the separate authority of the Irish Parliament might well have been called subversive by some, at a time when the Civil War was still a fairly recent memory, and new political ideas tended to be regarded with great suspicion. While the existence of Domville's treatise does not seem to have been widely known in his own lifetime, his son-in-law William Molyneux drew on it for his own highly controversial work The Case of Ireland's being bound by Acts of Parliament in England, Stated (1698). Both men argued that while the King of England was also King of Ireland, the Parliament of Ireland was wholly independent of the English Parliament. These views, although they were considered radical, perhaps even seditious, at the time, (Molyneux's work was burned pulicly) became widely accepted in the eighteenth century, and are said to have influenced Jonathan Swift.Patrick Kelly: Sir William Domville, A Disquisition Touching that Great Question.... Analecta Hibernica, no. 40 (2007): 19‚Äì69.  Family  Domville married Bridget Lake, daughter of Sir Thomas Lake, Secretary of State to James I, and his wife Mary Ryder. They had four sons and three daughters. Their sons included Sir William Domville junior, member of Parliament for Antrim and Sir Thomas Domvile, the first of the Domvile baronets.Pine, L.G.

He had his first showing in 1865. The following year, he started to exhibit regularly at the Sala Par√©s and began to attract customers from the bourgeoisie. He had to live in France briefly, following the Revolution of 1868. There, he became acquainted with the Barbizon school of landscape painting and met Josep Berga i Boix, who would later be his partner in several enterprises. Upon his return, he and his brother Marian would begin to establish what became known as the Olot school. In 1872, he was appointed Deputy-Mayor of Olot, but resigned after only three months due to the outbreak of the Third Carlist War. He went into self-exile in France and remained there until 1877. Three years later, he joined with Josep Berga i Boix and others to create a special workshop for religious images called \\"Els Sants d'Olot\\". He also regained his position with the city; serving from 1881 to 1883. From 1891 until his death he was a Provincial Deputy to the assembly in Manresa and participated in writing the Catalan Regional Constitution. He also contributed political opinion pieces to local periodicals. He died in Olot, aged 51. Work Vayreda's early work consists primarily of religious scenes and costumbrismo. Only later did he dedicate himself to landscape painting. His work is considered a precursor to the avant-garde in Spain. His Olot Landscapes (Paisajes de Olot) resemble a Catalan version of Camille Corot, particularly after his encounter with the Barbizon school. His works are dominated by browns, ochers, greens, and earth tones. His works include Procesi√≥n de colegialas, La siega, La primavera, Los primeros pantalones (1871), El bautizo y el verano (1877), and Flores de abril (1881). Apart from oil paintings, Vayreda also made ink drawings, watercolors, and etchings. Some of his works are painted jointly with his brother, Marian.

History The former cathedral with the new cathedral under construction to the left =Sacred Heart Parish= Sacred Heart Parish can trace its history back to 1952 when Bishop William Adrian of Nashville; the Rev. Joseph P. Follman, V.F., Dean of East Tennessee; and the Rev. Christopher P. Murray, Pastor of the Church of the Immaculate Conception in Knoxville determined that Knoxville needed a third Catholic parish. Land was purchased in Bearden the following year for $25,000. The Rev. Edward Dolan replaced Father Murray as Immaculate Conception‚Äôs pastor in 1955. He started to negotiate with Baumann and Baumann Architects and Emory and Richards General Contractors to build a church, school, rectory, and convent for $1 million.

The organisation's jurisdiction covers the whole island of Ireland and it is affiliated to the International Association of Athletic Federations. Its remit is to promote athletics from recreational running, schools competitions and to support elite athletes in international competitions. Structure The association has provincial councils in each of Ireland's four provinces, and county boards in the majority of Ireland's 32 traditional counties. History The AAI in its present form was established in 2000, but the history of sports governing bodies in Ireland is complicated because of the partition of the country in 1923. In 1884 the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) was formed and the Irish Amateur Athletic Association (IAAA) was formed in 1885. The Cross County Association of Ireland (CCAI) was established in 1886 and later became a subsidiary of the IAAA. In 1923 the National Athletic and Cycling Association (NACA) was established merging the IAAA, the CCAI, and the Athletics Council of the GAA, with the GAA thenceforth concentrating on Gaelic games. The NACA was then admitted to membership of the IAAF. In July 1924 the Northern Ireland Amateur Athletic, Cycling and Cross Country Association (NIAAA) was formed over a dispute concerning an Easter Monday athletics meeting in Belfast, breaking away from the NACA. The Amateur Athletic Association (AAA) accepted this breakaway group under its jurisdiction. The IAAF adopted an amendment to its constitution in 1930 which defined member organisations as being contiguous with political entities. The NACA rejected this ruling and was suspended from the IAAF. In 1937 some clubs seceded from the NACA to set up the Irish Amateur Athletic Union (IAAU) and this body became a member of the IAAF the following year while the NACA's suspension was made permanent. NACA later changed their name to the National Athletic and Cultural Association of Ireland (NACAI). The IAAU became the Amateur Athletic Union of Eire (AAUE) which represented Ireland at subsequent Olympic games. In 1967 Bord L√∫thchleas na h√âireann (BLE) was formed. In 1987, and with improved north-south relations, BLE and NACAI signed an agreement allowing athletes affiliated to both bodies to represent Ireland. BLE and NACAI dissolved completely in 2000 to form the Athletics Association of Ireland (Athletics Ireland). Kit suppliers Ireland's kits are currently supplied by Spanish sports brand Joma Sport.

The gold background is typical of icons such as this, which was manufactured in the 12th century after a manuscript written by the 6th century monk John Climacus who based it on the biblical description of Jacob's ladder. It depicts the ascent to Heaven by monks, some of whom fall and are dragged away by black demons. Eternal life traditionally refers to continued life after death, as outlined in Christian eschatology. The Apostles' Creed testifies: \\"I believe... the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting.\\" In this view, eternal life commences after the second coming of Jesus and the resurrection of the dead, although in the New Testament's Johannine literature there are references to eternal life commencing in the earthly life of the believer, possibly indicating an inaugurated eschatology. According to mainstream Christian theology, after death but before the Second Coming, the saved live with God in an intermediate state, but after the Second Coming, experience the physical resurrection of the dead and the physical recreation of a New Earth. The Catechism of the Catholic Church states, \\"By death the soul is separated from the body, but in the resurrection God will give incorruptible life to our body, transformed by reunion with our soul. Just as Christ is risen and lives for ever, so all of us will rise at the last day.\\" N.T. Wright argues that \\"God's plan is not to abandon this world... Rather, he intends to remake it. And when he does, he will raise all people to new bodily life to live in it. That is the promise of the Christian gospel\\" . In the Synoptic Gospels and the Pauline Letters, eternal life is generally regarded as a future experience, but the Gospel of John differs from them in its emphasis on eternal life as a \\"present possession\\".Images of Salvation in the New Testament, by Brenda B. Colijn 2010 pages 87-90 Raymond E. Brown points out that in the synoptic gospels eternal life is something received at the final judgment, or a future age (Mark 10:30, Matthew 18:8-9) but the Gospel of John positions eternal life as a present possibility, as in John 5:24.The Westminster Theological Wordbook of the Bible by Donald E. Gowan 2003 pages 115-116 Thus, unlike the synoptics, in the Gospel of John eternal life is not only futuristic, but also pertains to the present. In John, those who accept Christ can possess life \\"here and now\\" as well as in eternity, for they have \\"passed from death to life\\", as in John 5:24: \\"He who hears my word, and believes him that sent me, has eternal life, and comes not into judgment, but has passed out of death into life.\\" In John, the purpose for the incarnation, death, resurrection and glorification of The Word was to provide eternal life to humanity. In the New Testament Scholars such as John H. Leith assert that eternal life is never described in detail in the New Testament, although assurances are provided that the faithful will receive it.Basic Christian doctrine by John H. Leith 1993 page 296Eerdmans Dictionary of the Bible 2000 page 430 Other scholars such as D. A. Carson suggest that eternal life is explicitly defined in John 17:3, where Jesus says in his High Priestly Prayer, \\"Now this is eternal life: that they may know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.\\" Carson says of this verse that \\"Eternal life turns on nothing more and nothing less than knowledge of the true God\\" and that it is \\"not so much everlasting life as personal knowledge of the Everlasting One.\\"D. A. Carson, The Gospel According to John (Apollos, 1991), p. 556. The Eerdmans Dictionary of the Bible on the other hand, contends that \\"the nature of eternal life is only sketched in its essential elements in the New Testament\\". John W. Ritenbaugh says that eternal life is knowing God, and that Jesus implies an intimate relationship with God that matures over time. Ostromir Gospel of John, 1056 While the Synoptic Gospels are seen as focusing on the proclamation of the Kingdom of God, some scholars see eternal life as the central theme of Jesus' preaching in the Gospel of John,A theology of the New Testament by George Eldon Ladd 1993 pages 290‚Äì293 where receiving eternal life is seen to be synonymous with entering the Kingdom.A theology of the New Testament by George Eldon Ladd 1993 page 70 In Christian teachings, eternal life is not an inherent part of human existence, and is a unique gift from God, based on the model of the Resurrection of Jesus, viewed as a unique event through which death was conquered \\"once for all\\", permitting Christians to experience eternal life. This eternal life is provided to believers, generally assumed to be at the resurrection of the dead.Mercer dictionary of the Bible by Watson E. Mills, Roger Aubrey Bullard 2001 page 513 In New Testament theology, in addition to \\"life\\" (zoe, i.e. Œ∂œâ·Ω¥ in Greek), there is also a promised spiritual life sometimes described by the adjective eternal (aionios i.e. Œ±·º∞œéŒΩŒπŒøœÇ in Greek) but other times simply referred to as \\"life\\". In both John and Paul the possibility of attaining eternal life and avoiding the wrath of God is dependent on believing in Jesus, the Son of God. For John abiding in Christ involves love for one another, as in John 15:9-17, and John 5:24. The existence of divine love in believers, then facilitates the influence of the gospel on the world, and lead to widespread salvation. 1 John 3:14 then manifests \\"the already but not yet\\" acquisition of eternal life by referring to the acquisition of eternal life as a once for all (ephapax) event, and the role of love in attaining it: \\"We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love each other. Anyone who does not love remains in death\\", somewhat reminiscent of the words of Jesus in John 5:24.1-3 John by Robert W. Yarbrough 2008 page 200 =Pauline letters= In the Pauline epistles, the oldest texts in the New Testament, eternal life becomes possible in the person of Christ, where by the grace of God and through faith in Christ humans can receive the gift of eternal life.The Bible Knowledge Word Study by Darrell Bock 2006 page 162 For Paul (as in Galatians 6:8) future eternal life arrives as a result of the indwelling of the Holy Spirit during the present life.The Theology of Paul the Apostle by James D. G. Dunn 2006 page 479 by John W. Yates 2008 page 121 Paul views sin as an obstacle to attaining eternal life, as in Romans 6:23. For Paul eternal life is a future possession and \\"the eschatological goal towards which believers strive.\\" Paul emphasizes that eternal life is not merely something to be earned, but a gift from God, as in Romans 6:23: \\"wages of sin is death; but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.\\" Romans 6:23 thus also counter-positions sin and eternal life: while sin results in death, those who are \\"in Christ\\" will reap eternal life.Paul's Letter to the Romans: A Commentary by Arland J. Hultgren 2011 page 264 Paul also discusses the relationship of eternal life to the Holy Spirit, stating that to be with the Spirit and to think with the Spirit leads to eternal life, e.g. Galatians 6:8: :\\"he who sows to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap eternal life.\\" For Paul future eternal life arrives as a result of the indwelling of the Holy Spirit during the present life, and the inter- related statements about the present life, the Spirit and future life form a key element of the teachings on the topic in Galatians. 1 Timothy 1:16 characterizes Christians by reference to eternal life and calls the followers of Jesus: \\"an ensample of them that should thereafter believe on him unto eternal life.\\" and 6:12 advises them to \\"fight the good fight of the faith, lay hold on the life eternal\\". =Synoptic Gospels= The Synoptic Gospels include fifteen occurrences of the word life, eight of these including the adjective eternal.The Westminster theological wordbook of the Bible by Donald E. Gowan 2003 pages 296‚Äì298 There are parallels in how the synoptics refer to \\"being saved\\" and John refers to eternal life, as in the table below:Three views on the origins of the Synoptic Gospels by Robert L. Thomas 2002 pages 33‚Äì34 { style=border-collapse:collapse border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5 - style=\\"text-align:center; background:#efefef;\\" !Matthew 16:25 !Mark 8:35 !Luke 9:24 !John 12:25 - align=center ... whosoever shall lose his life for my sake shall find it. ... whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel's shall save it. ... whosoever shall lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it. ... he that hates his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal. } In the Gospel of Luke, the Parable of the Good Samaritan begins with a question about eternal life in 10:25 when a lawyer asks Jesus what he needs to do to \\"inherit eternal life\\". The Gospel of Matthew includes references to eternal life, in 19:16, 19:29 and 25:46. The reference in Matthew 19:16 is within the parable of Jesus and the rich young man which also appears in Mark 10:17‚Äì31 and Luke 18:18‚Äì30.Matthew by David L. Turner 2008 page 469 This parable relates the term \\"eternal life\\" to entry into the Kingdom of God.Matthew by David L. Turner 2008 page 473 The parable starts by a question to Jesus from the young man: \\"what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?\\" and Jesus advises him to keep the commandments, and then refers to entry into the \\"Kingdom of God\\" in the same context. =Johannine literature= The Johannine concept of eternal life differs from the synoptic view.International Standard Bible Encyclopedia: E-J by Geoffrey W. Bromiley 1982 page 161 Johannine writings specifically present the view of eternal life as not simply futuristic, but also pertaining to the present, so those who hear the words of Jesus and trust in Yaweh can possess life \\"here and now\\" as well as in eternity, for they have \\"passed from death to life\\", as in John 5:24. Overall, the New Testament balances the present and future with respect to eternal life: the believer has passed from death to eternal life, but this remains to be totally realized in the future.Eerdmans Dictionary of the Bible summarizes this as follows: \\"The NT searches for a balance on eternal life between present and future - the believer has passed in Christ from death to eternal life, but this remains to be fully realized in God's future, specially in the Resurrection and new creation at the eschaton\\". First Epistle of John in Codex Alexandrinus, 5th century There are about 37 uses of the word life in the Gospel of John, of which about half refer to eternal life.Mercer dictionary of the Bible by Watson E. Mills, Roger Aubrey Bullard 2001 Entry for \\"eternal life\\", pages 264‚Äì2651, 2, and 3 John by John Painter, Daniel J. Harrington 2002 pages 195‚Äì196Note: Different authors provide slightly different counts for the use of the term life in John, e.g. 37 in The Westminster theological wordbook of the Bible vs 36 in Painter and Harrington's book There are six appearances in 1 John. The concept so permeates Johannine writings that in many cases one may just read life as eternal life. Reformed evangelical theologian D. A. Carson sees as giving the \\"strongest affirmation of inaugurated eschatology in the Fourth Gospel\\": it is not necessary for the believer to \\"wait until the last day to experience something of resurrection life.\\"D. A. Carson, The Gospel According to John (Apollos, 1991), p. 256. George Eldon Ladd points out that, like the Kingdom of God, eternal life is \\"not only an eschatological gift belonging to the Age to Come; it is also a gift to be received in the old aeon\\". In this context, the gift of eternal life in the old aeon in which sin and death are still present is contrasted with eternal life in the new aeon of life and righteousness, the World to Come to which the faithful will belong.A theology of the New Testament by George Eldon Ladd 1993 page 528The international standard Bible encyclopedia by Geoffrey W. Bromiley 1995 page 525 However, although as in John 3:16 God has provided the gift of eternal life to believers, the possibility of perishing (Œ±œÄœåŒªŒ∑œÑŒ±Œπ) remains if one rejects Jesus. According to John 3:36, \\"He that believeth on the Son hath eternal life; but he that obeyeth not the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him.\\" Towards the end of the Gospel of John (20:31), the purpose of writing the Fourth Gospel is stated as: \\"so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name\\". This is often correlated to 1 John 5:13: \\"These things I have written to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, so that you may know that you have eternal life.\\"1, 2, and 3 John by John Painter, Daniel J. Harrington 2002 pages 69‚Äì72 John's Gospel positions eternal life around the person of Jesus, the Christ.Reading John with St. Thomas Aquinas edited by Michael Dauphinais 2005 page 159 In the Johannine view Christ can reveal life to humans because he is life himself. 1 John 1:2: \\"proclaim to you the eternal life, which was with the Father and was manifested to us\\" is compared to John 1:1: \\"and the Word was with God\\", referring to the pre-existence of Christ. The term is used in the Gospel of John in the context of the Water of Life and John 4:14 states: \\"the water that I shall give him shall become in him a well of water springing up unto eternal life.\\"Jesus & the Rise of Early Christianity by Paul Barnett 2002 page 312 In John 6:51 Jesus states that: \\"he who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.\\" This has been transposed, not only into a relationship with Jesus in common with Christian Theology but also into the Eucharist as an element of obtaining eternal life.New Testament Theology by Leon Morris 1990 pages 267‚Äì269 The Catechism of the Catholic Church (item 1212) teaches that Christians are born through the sacrament of Baptism and receive the \\"food of eternal life\\" in the Eucharist.Catechism item 1212 In John 10:27‚Äì28 Jesus states that: \\"My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me: and I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish.\\" This refers to the personal, heart to heart relationship the Christian is expected to have with Jesus.You have words of eternal life by Hans Urs von Balthasar 1991 page 116 Another use is in John 17:3: \\"And this is life eternal, that they should know thee the only true God, and him whom thou didst send, Jesus Christ\\", this usage relating to the \\"theme of life\\" in the Book of Revelation.Revelation: The Triumph of Christ by John R. W. Stott, Sandy Larsen, Dale Larsen 2008 page 53 Roman Catholicism Catholic Christians teach that there is a supernatural realm called Purgatory where souls who have died in a state of grace but have yet to expiate venial sins or temporal punishments due to past sins are cleansed before they are admitted into Heaven. Seventh-day Adventists Seventh-day Adventists believe that only God has immortality, and when a person dies, death is a state of unconscious sleep until the resurrection. They base this belief on biblical texts such as Ecclesiastes 9:5 which states \\"the dead know nothing\\", and 1 Thessalonians 4:13‚Äì18 which contains a description of the dead being raised from the grave at the second coming. :\\"And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.\\" (cf. ) The text of Genesis 2:7 clearly states that God breathed into the formed man the \\"breath of life\\" and man became a living soul. He did not receive a living soul; he became one. The New King James Bible states that \\"man became a living being\\". According to the Scriptures, only man received life in this way from God. Because of this man is the only living creature to have a soul. :\\"And out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field ... wherein is the breath of life.\\" (cf. , ) :\\"Both man and beast ... have all one breath, so that a man hath no preeminence above the beast.\\"(cf. ) Of the many references to soul and spirit in the Bible, never once is either the soul or the spirit declared to be immortal, imperishable or eternal. Indeed, only God has immortality (1 Timothy 1:17; 6:16). Adventists teach that the resurrection of the righteous will take place at the second coming of Jesus, at which time they will be restored to life and taken to reside in Heaven. Jehovah's Witnesses Jehovah's Witnesses believe the word soul (nephesh or psykhe) as used in the Bible is a person, an animal, or the life a person or animal enjoys. Hence, the soul is not part of man, but is the whole man‚Äîman as a living being. Hence, when a person or animal dies, the soul dies, and death is a state of non-existence, based on Psalms 146:4, Ezekiel 18:4, and other passages. Hell (Hades) is not a place of fiery torment, but rather the common grave of humankind, a place of unconsciousness.Hell-Eternal Torture or Common Grave? The Watchtower, April 15, 1993, p. 6. One group, referenced as \\"the little flock\\" of 144,000 people, will receive immortality and go to heaven to rule as Kings and Priests with Christ during the thousand years. As for the rest of humankind, after the final judgment, it is expected that the righteous will receive eternal life and live forever on an Earth turned into a paradise. Those granted immortality in heaven are absolutely immortal and cannot die by any cause.The Watchtower, 1 December 1963, 732, \\"The Gift of Immortality\\" Even God himself wouldn't be able to kill them.\\"The Watchtower\\", 1 April 1956, 219, \\"Question From Readers\\" They teach that Jesus was the first to be rewarded with heavenly immortality, but that Revelation 7:4 and Revelation 14:1, 3 refer to a literal number (144,000) of additional people who will become \\"self-sustaining\\", that is, not needing anything outside themselves (food, sunlight, etc.) to maintain their own life.Insight on the Scriptures Vol. 1 p. 1196: \\"Incorruption\\" They make a distinction between immortality and eternal life in that humans who have passed the final judgement and were rewarded \\"eternal life\\" can still technically lose that life and die if they were ever hypothetically sin at some future point in time, though they do not succumb to disease or old age, due to their living forever still being subject to obedience. They also still continue to be dependent on food, water, air, and such to maintain life.The Watchtower, April 1st, pgs. 30-31, Questions From Readers, \\"What is the difference between immortality and everlasting life?\\" Though immortality is, in a sense, everlasting life, immortality apparently implies more than that its possessor will live forever. It seems to indicate a particular quality of life, and it is linked with incorruption. The Bible says about spirit-anointed Christians who receive the heavenly reward: ‚ÄúThis which is corruptible [in its human body] must put on incorruption, and this which is mortal must put on immortality. But when this which is corruptible puts on incorruption and this which is mortal puts on immortality, then the saying will take place that is written: ‚ÄòDeath is swallowed up forever.‚Äô‚Äù‚Äî1 Corinthians 15:53, 54. Still, the Bible does not provide much detail about the quality of life termed immortality. We do know that mortal humans‚Äîeven perfect humans having the prospect of endless life on earth‚Äîmust eat and drink to maintain life, or they die and their bodies experience corruption. (Genesis 2:9, 15, 16) No doubt immortality involves a quality of life that does not need to be sustained like that. Thus it could be said that all who become immortal are not subject to death or that ‚Äòdeath is master over them no more.‚Äô That would harmonize, too, with their receiving incorruptibility, indicating that their spirit body or organism is inherently beyond decay, ruin or corruption. (Compare 2 Corinthians 5:1; Revelation 20:6.) In these ways a difference might be seen between immortality and everlasting human life. Nevertheless, those who pass that final test are \\"guaranteed\\" to remain faithful throughout all eternity due to the test being perfect and designed to eliminate those who would ever misuse their free will.The Watchtower 1974 6/1 pp. 346-348; The Watchtower 1967 9/1 pp. 525; The Watchtower 1967 8/15 pp. 508-509; The Watchtower 1954 4/15 pp. 255 par. 23 Latter Day Saints Mormon plan of salvation. In Latter-day Saint (Mormonism) theology, the spirit and the body constitute the human soul. Whereas the human body is subject to death on earth, they believe that the spirit never ceases to exist and that one day the spirits and bodies of all mankind will be reunited again. This doctrine stems from their belief that the resurrection of Jesus Christ grants the universal gift of immortality to every human being. Joseph Smith, Jr., the founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, provided a description of the afterlife based upon a vision he received, which is recorded in the Doctrine and Covenants. According to the 76th section of the LDS scripture, the afterlife consists of three degrees or kingdoms of glory, called the Celestial Kingdom, the Terrestrial Kingdom, and the Telestial Kingdom. Other Biblical scriptures speak of varying degrees of glory, such as : \\"There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another. There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for one star differeth from another star in glory.\\" The few who do not inherit any degree of glory (though they are resurrected) reside in a state called outer darkness, which, though not a degree of glory, is often discussed in this context. Only those known as the \\"Sons of Perdition\\" are condemned to this state. Other Christian beliefs The doctrine of conditional immortality states the human soul is naturally mortal, and that immortality is granted by God as a gift. The doctrine is a \\"significant minority evangelical view\\" that has \\"grown within evangelicalism in recent years\\".The Nature of Hell. Conclusions and Recommendations by Evangelical Alliance Some sects who hold to the doctrine of baptismal regeneration also believe in a third realm called Limbo, which is the final destination of souls who have not been baptised, but who have been innocent of mortal sin. Souls in Limbo include unbaptised infants and those who lived virtuously but were never exposed to Christianity in their lifetimes. Christian Scientists believe that sin brought death, and that death will be overcome with the overcoming of sin.

Fleg‚Äôs oeuvre was crucial in constructing a modern French Jewish identity, rendering him an instrumental figure in the Jewish awakening during the interwar years. After World War I, Jewish writers began articulating a new, cultural definition of what it meant to be a Jew within the context of French Third Republic universalism. Through his writings ‚Äî based on Jewish and Christian texts -- Fleg formed the foundation of a modern French Jewish spirituality and self-understanding, which allowed secular French Jews to preserve their Jewish identity. In doing so, Fleg was calling for an exploration of the living texts of traditional Judaism as the basis for a modern Jewish identity, establishing a new literary direction devoted to re-interpreting biblical texts and legends, and liturgies. Life Edmond Fleg was born in Geneva on 26 November 1874 to a Swiss-based Alsatian Jewish family. At the time of his birth, Fleg‚Äôs parents were residing in Geneva, but their familial roots were in France. Given their connection to France, Fleg's family expressed a strong loyalty to the emancipatory values of the French Revolution when Jews were granted full citizenship. As French- identified Jews, Fleg's parents found the principles of Judaism as they understood them to be identical with the liberal ideals of the French revolution: tolerance, equality, and freedom. Throughout his childhood, Fleg received both a religious and secular education. As a young boy, Fleg quickly began to question god, spirituality, and religion. While reflecting on his Bar Mitzvah, Fleg recalled, ‚ÄúI had no understanding of Hebrew, I didn‚Äôt understand one word.‚Äù According to Fleg the entire spectacle felt artificial to him. Years later he would say, ‚Äúlying in bed, my soul was searching, asking the Eternal to show me when Judaism had become so distasteful.‚Äù He developed a disdain for his parent's apparent inconsistencies and found the rabbi and cantor to be boring and uninspiring. He began his formal education, first, in Paris at the Lyc√©e Louis Le Grand and then at √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure. Both institutions were known for its emphasis on Neo-Kantianism which appealed to middle-class Frenchman such as Fleg. In 1899 he qualified as a teacher of the German language. He became the best friend of the editor Lucien Moreau (1875‚Äì1932), later one of the leaders of the Action Fran√ßaise. They agreed that Jewish and French nationalisms \\"traveled in parallel lines\\", and rejected assimilation. During World War One, Fleg joined the French Foreign Legion in order to fight for his adopted country. He won the Croix de Guerre and he was honored later, in 1937, by being made an officer of the Legion of Honor. From 1904 to 1920 Fleg was a successful playwright. His work was influenced by the disturbances caused by the Dreyfus affair, by his participation in the Third Zionist Congress in Basel and by the reports of pogroms. The antisemitism unleashed by the Dreyfus affair, which put France in turmoil, shattered Fleg's world view. Fleg would later write: ‚ÄúInitially the Dreyfus Affair passed unnoticed for me...but later it pushed me into reality and the ‚ÄòJewish problem.‚Äô It became very difficult to forget completely that you were a Jew.‚Äù As the affair progressed, Fleg had no doubt that Dreyfus was innocent. This woke Fleg up to the political and social realities around him. Fleg came to believe that the injustice was a sign that he shared the same destiny of Dreyfus by the mere fact that they were both Jews, whether he liked it or not. Fleg, and other Franco-Jewish intellectuals developed a deep sense of betrayal, and many began openly identifying as Dreyfusards. This is also when Fleg heard for the first time about Zionism. Ecoute, Isra√´l appeared between 1913 and 1948, and the Anthologie juive from 1923 to 1953. In 1928 F. die Schrift published his Pourquoi je suis juif. In 1949 he was co-founder of the Amiti√©s jud√©o-chr√©tiennes. His 1960 work Vers le Monde qui vient gave his message of hope with which he wanted to build a bridge to Christianity. Both of Fleg's sons were killed fighting for France in the Second World War. Edmond Fleg died in Paris on 15 October 1963. Works Edmond Fleg's writing can be divided into three main categories: religious poetry, biographical works, and autobiographical and other essays on Jewish themes. Considered to be one of France‚Äôs leading writers, he authored countless essays, 17 plays and operas, 10 books of poetry and four novels. He also he compiled anthologies, and translated and adapted work by other writers and poets. = Books = * Anthologie juive (1921; The Jewish Anthology, 1925) * L'Enfant proph√®te (1926; The Boy Prophet, 1928) * Pourquoi je suis Juif (1928; Why I am a Jew, 1929), * The life of Solomon (1930) * J√©sus, racont√© par le Juif Errant (1933; Jesus, Told by the Wandering Jew, 1934) * Ecoute Isra√´l (1921) * Ma Palestine (1932; The Land of Promise, 1933) * Nous de l'Esperance (1949) * La Terre que Dieu habite (1953; The Land in which God Dwells, 1955) = Plays = * La Maison du Bon Dieu (1920) * Le Juif du Pape (1925; The Pope's Jew) * Le Message (1904) * La B√™te (1910) * Le Trouble-f√™te (1913). = Biographies = * Mo√Øse racont√© par les Sages (1928; The Life of Moses, 1928) * Salomon (1930; The Life of Solomon, 1929) = Translations = * Shalom Aleichem and the Passover Haggadah (1925) * Selections from Maimonides' Guide and from the Zohar. = Poetry = * La Mur des Pleurs / Wall of Weeping (1919) *Hear O Israel *The Lord is our God, *The Lord is One, *And thou shalt love the Lord. ;Translations He translated a part of the Bible in French; Genesis in 1946 and Exodus in 1963. = Opera Librettist = * Ernest Bloch's Macbeth * George Enescu's ≈ídipe. :He was originally commissioned to write the libretto in 1912, and completed a long version within that year.

The film is presumed to be lost.Progressive Silent Film List: The Savage at silentera.com Story Marie Louise returns home from finishing school, and catches the eye of Julio Sandoval, an emotional half-breed. She is engaged to Captain McKeever of the mounted police, but Sandoval wants her for himself. Finding her alone in the woods, the half-breed carries her to his cabin, but he is taken ill. Marie nurses him back to health, and when a rescue party arrives for her, she protects him. Back in town, Marie discovers McKeever has been taken prisoner by the outlaw Joe Bedotte. Julio goes to the rescue, losing his life in the process.

Bainbridge as Michael Montague *Arthur Tavares as Joe Bedotte *George Franklin as Baptiste *Duke R. Lee as Pierre (credited as Duke Lee) Production Shortly after Colleen Moore's arrival in Hollywood, the Triangle Film Corporation went through a reorganization with the departure of D. W. Griffith for Europe. Colleen's contract was with Griffith's studio, not Triangle, and so she found herself on contract with no projects. She found a part in Universal Bluebird's film The Savage and was given several weeks off from her contract to film her part. In the film, Colleen plays the part of Lizette, a half-breed like Julio. This would be one of several \\"exotic\\" roles Colleen would play during her career, including her part as a Persian in The Devil's Claim. After this film, Colleen went on to work at the Selig Polyscope Company. Reception Like many American films of the time, The Savage was subject to cuts by city and state film censorship boards. For example, the Chicago Board of Censors required cuts of the holdup and stealing of a letter, two scenes of the holdup of the officer at point of knife, binding the officer to the cabin wall, two closeups of men leering at the young woman after the intertitle \\"Give me a leetle kiss\\", and three closeups of the half-breed's face as he looks at the unconscious young woman in the cabin. The Board later made additional cuts in Reel 3 of all closeups of the half-breed leering at young woman at brookside, all but the first scene of the half-breed chasing her, the entire incident of half-breed laying unconscious woman on couch-bed including all closeups of man's passionate contortions and girl's scared face, intertitle \\"The white man's instinct struggles for supremacy\\", all other views of couple, and the intertitle \\"They'll kill you for this\\".

The British Royal Navy bought her in 1807 and she served until she foundered in 1810. Royal Navy service In early 1808 Lieutenant Thomas Huskisson commissioned Fleur de la Mer. He had come out to the Jamaica station on , and once there Vice-Admiral Sir B. S. Rowley appointed him to Fleur de la Mer and put him to cruising off San Domingo. There he rescued a gentleman who had fallen afoul of Henri Christophe. Huskisson also visited Cartagena, where he was able to intercede and win the release of seven persons who had accompanied General Miranda‚Äôs British-supported and unsuccessful attempted invasion of the Captaincy General of Venezuela in 1806.Marshall (1828), Supplement, Part 2, p.340. In 1808 Fleur de la Mer was renamed HMS Pike after the loss of the previous year. However, in September 1808 recaptured Pike. The earlier Pike apparently regained or kept her name, and the then current Pike reverted to Fleur de la Mer. Huskisson was promoted to Commander on 19 January 1809, but did not find out about his promotion until May, at which time he transferred to command . His successor in command of Fleur de la Mer was Lieutenant James Daly. On 6 July 1809 Fleur de la Mer and Pike were among the vessels that carried out the blockade of the city of Santo Domingo that accompanied the siege, and they were both present at its surrender.Marshall (1825), Vol. 2, Part 2, pp.970-1. In 1810, Lieutenant John Alexander replaced Daly. Loss In December 1810 Fleur de la Mer was escorting the merchant brig Cassius to Jamaica when they encountered heavy weather on 28 December that flooded the schooner. Her crew was barely able to pump her out and Alexander decided to head for shelter near Maracaibo. In the evening it was discovered that she had a leak and that the main beam was broken, causing the deck to sag. By midnight it was clear that Fleur de la Mer could not survive. During the night Cassius, one of the vessels that Fleur de la Mer was convoying, took off the entire crew; the next morning Fleur de la Mer sank shortly before 11am.

All of the business routes are former sections of US Highway 31 (US 31). They connect the freeway mainline of US 31 to the various downtowns of cities bypassed by US 31\\\\. Two of the current business routes, for Hart and Ludington, are business spurs, connecting to US 31 on only one end, while the remainder for Muskegon, Whitehall‚ÄìMontague and Pentwater, are business loops. The two former routes, for Niles and Holland were a business spur and loop, respectively. Niles Business US Highway 31 (Bus. US 31) was a business spur running to the Niles downtown area along a former routing of US 31 from US 31 exit 7 (Walton Road) northeasterly then southeasterly into downtown, ending at Bus. US 12 at the corner of Front and Main streets. At the time it was decommissioned, Bus. US 31 was only designated along the north‚Äìsouth segment between Walton Road and Main Street. It was commissioned in 1987 as a loop connecting to US 31 on both ends, running along US 12 to US 33 (11th Street) north into downtown and along Bus. US 12\\\\. Bus. US 31 followed Front Street northward back to the mainline US 31 at Walton Road northwest of downtown. The business loop was extended along Walton Road in 1992 when the next segment of the US 31 freeway opened in Berrien County. The highway was truncated to a spur route in 1998 when M-51 was extended southward. The northernmost remaining portion along Walton Road was turned over to the Berrien County Road Commission on October 23, 2007, and the remaining portion was replaced by an extended M-139 in April 2010. Major intersections South Haven Business US Highway 31 (Bus. US 31) was a business loop running through downtown South Haven along a former routing of US 31\\\\. The loop started at an intersection with US 31 in South Haven Township south of town and ran along LaGrange Road, Phillips Street and Broadway Street into downtown. On the north side, Bus. US 31 crossed the Black River and then followed North Shore Drive back to US 31. The business loop was created during World War II when the state moved US 31 to bypass downtown South Haven; the former routing was designated as the business loop. In 1963, South Haven was bypassed again by I-196/US 31, and the former bypass of downtown became BL I-196. Major intersections Holland Business US Highway 31 (Bus. US 31) was a business loop running through Holland. It started at an interchange on the southern edge of the city where Business Loop Interstate 196 (BL I-196), US 31 and A-2 all converged near West Michigan Regional Airport. BL I-196 turned northward off the US 31 freeway and ran concurrently with Bus. US 31 along Washington Avenue through a residential area on the southern side of Holland in Allegan County. At the intersection with 32nd Street, BL I-196/Bus. US 31 crossed into Ottawa County and turned northeasterly on Michigan Avenue. Michigan Avenue ends at an intersection with State Street and 19th Street, and the business loop turned due north on River Street into downtown. The business loop split along the one-way pairing of 7th and 9th streets in downtown. The northbound direction ran eastward on 9th Street while the southbound direction was routed two blocks north on 7th street. On the eastern side of downtown at Lincoln Street, southbound traffic was routed on 8th Street., and one block further east, both directions followed 8th Street. At Chicago Drive, BL I-196/Bus. US 31 turned northeasterly to follow that street out downtown. Bus. US 31 ended at an interchange with US 31 in Holland Township while BL I-196 continued northeasterly on Chicago Drive. The initial bypass of Holland, rerouting US 31 out of downtown opened in 1954. The former routing through downtown was redesignated as Bus. US 31 at this time. The first segment of I-196/US 31 freeway in the Holland area opened in 1963, adding an interchange to the southern terminus of Bus. US 31. In 1974, the I-196 bypass around Holland was completed, and Chicago Drive east of US 31 becomes a business route for I-196. By 1976, this business route was extended along Bus. US 31 through downtown as well. In 2004, all of Bus US 31 was decommissioned and BL I-196 was rerouted to follow US 31 around downtown. Major intersections Muskegon alternate route US Highway 31A (US 31A) was an alternate route through Muskegon. The designation was first commissioned in 1932 for a highway that bypassed downtown Muskegon to the east. In 1940, the alternate route and the mainline highway were flipped through the area, rerouting US 31A to run through downtown. At the same time, US 16 was rerouted to run into Muskegon, partially following US 31A. This last version of US 31A ran northwesterly along Airline Highway and Peck Street into downtown, where US 16 turned westward along M-46. US 31A continued northeasterly along Muskegon Avenue back to US 31 at Marquette Avenue. A year later, the alternate route was redesignated as business loop instead, removing the US 31A designation from the state highway system. Major intersections Muskegon business loop Business US Highway 31 (Bus. US 31) is a business loop running through the Muskegon area. It starts in Norton Shores and an interchange with US 31 as the westward continuation of Interstate 96 (I-96) and continues as a freeway for about a mile (1.5 km) before downgrading to an expressway with Michigan left turns near the Muskegon County Airport. The business loop runs along the southern edge of Muskegon Heights and then turns northward near the Roosevelt Park city line. This north‚Äìsouth segment forms the boundary between commercial properties to the west and residential neighborhoods to the east as far north as the intersection with Broadway Avenue. North of Sherman Avenue, the business loop crosses into the city of Muskegon and runs through commercial properties on Seaway Drive. As it approaches Muskegon Lake, Bus. US 31 turns northeasterly along Shoreline Drive, running around the northern edge of downtown. On the northeastern corner of downtown, the business loop turns sharply northeasterly along Moses J. Jones Parkway. Along this parkway segment, Bus. US 31 meets the southern terminus of M-120 and turns easterly along a freeway segment in Muskegon Township to terminate at US 31. The first bypass of Muskegon opened to traffic in 1932 to the east of downtown; it was designated US 31A. This first alternate route and the mainline were flipped in 1940, routing US 31A through downtown (partially along a section of US 16) and US 31 along the bypass. In 1941, US 31A was redesignated Bus. US 31. The business route was extended on each end in 1950 or 1951 when the mainline was shifted further out of the city to the east. At the end of the 1950s, the US 31 bypass east of Muskegon was converted to a freeway, and the southern section of the business loop was rerouted to follow Seaway Drive. When US 16 was decommissioned in the state in 1962, the section of US 16/Bus. US 16 is redesignated BS I-196, and the following year, it becomes BS I-96; Bus. US 31 remains in place through both changes. The northern end of the business loop near downtown was rerouted onto the one-way pairing of Muskegon and Webster avenues in 1965. In 1984, the BS I-96 designated into Muskegon was decommissioned. The northern section of Bus. US 31 near downtown was rerouted again, this time to follow Shoreline Drive, in 2007. In 2016, all of the business loop was designated as a part of the West Michigan Pike Pure Michigan Byway. Major intersections Whitehall‚ÄìMontague Business US Highway 31 (Bus. US 31) is a business loop running through Whitehall and Montague. It starts at an interchange with US 31 in Whitehall Township east of the city of Whitehall and runs westward on Colby Street past a cluster of businesses. Farther west, Bus. US 31 runs through residential areas before entering downtown Whitehall and turning northward on Thompson Street to cross the White River near its mouth on White Lake. On the northern side of the river, the business loop follows Dowling Street in Montague and then turns north-northeasterly on Water Street through downtown. Bus. US 31 exits downtown and passes through a residential area before leaving Montague. North of town, the business loop runs past various businesses and next to farm fields to an intersection with B-15 (Fruitvale Road) in Montague Township. The business loop turns eastward and runs concurrently with the county highway for a short distance to an interchange with US 31 that marks the northern terminus of the business loop. A freeway bypass of Whitehall and Montague opened in 1964, and the former routing o US 31 through the downtowns of the two cities was redesignated Bus. US 31\\\\. At the northern end, the routing split to follow two connections with the new freeway, running east on Fruitvale Road and running north on Whitehall Road. B-15 was designated in 1970, overlapping the business loop at the northern end. The bifurcated northern connection to the freeway was removed in 1975 when the next segment of US 31 opened heading north into Oceana County. In 2016, all of the business loop was designated as a part of the West Michigan Pike Pure Michigan Byway. Major intersections Hart Business US Highway 31 (Bus. US 31) is a business spur running into the Hart downtown area. It starts at exit 149 on US 31 in Hart Township and runs eastward along Polk Road into the southern part of the city. The business spur passes some commercial properties along Polk Road before turning northward on State Street next to the Oceana County Fairgrounds. Bus. US 31 passes more businesses before entering a residential area. The business spur terminates at the intersection with Johnson Street in Hart. A segment of US 31 freeway opened from the Polk Road interchange northward to Monroe Road southeast of Pentwater in 1978. At that time, US 31 was rerouted out of Hart. The former routing along Polk Road and State Street was designated as Bus. US 31 in 1987. Major intersections Pentwater Business US Highway 31 (Bus. US 31) is a business loop running through the Pentwater downtown area. It starts at an interchange on US 31 in Weare Township southeast of Pentwater. It runs westward and northwesterly along Monroe Road and across the Pentwater River through a rural wooded area. The business loop intersects B-15 at that county highway's northern terminus in Pentwater Township on the shores of Pentwater Lake. The business loop follows the northern shore of the lake and then turns west on 6th Street through a residential area into the village of Pentwater. In downtown, Bus. US 31 turns northward along Hancock Street. The business loop exits downtown and passes through another residential area on the north side of the village before exiting town northeast of Charles Mears State Park. Bus. US 31 meanders through rural woodlands north of Pentwater as it approaches the Oceana‚ÄìMason county line near Bass Lake. The business loop turns eastward, briefly following the county line before turning southeasterly to an interchange with US 31 on the Pentwater‚ÄìWeare township line. US 31 was rerouted to run further east of Pentwater in 1955, and the former route through the village was redesignated as Bus. US 31 at that time. In 1978, a section of US 31 freeway opened between Hart and Pentwater. Bus. US 31 was slightly truncated on its southern end to terminate at the new freeway interchange, and part of Monroe Road was redesignated as the mainline of US 31 between the end of the freeway and the former routing of US 31. The next freeway segment opened in 1980, and Bus. US 31 was slightly lengthened to connect to the new freeway interchange with Oceana Road.], resulting in the current configuration. In 2016, all of the business loop was dedicated as a part of the West Michigan Pike Pure Michigan Byway. Major intersections Ludington Business US Highway 31 (Bus. US 31) is a business spur running into the Ludington downtown area. The highway starts at exit 166 on the US 31 and follows Pere Marquette Highway northwesterly and northward toward Ludington. The business spur crosses the Pere Marquette River near Pere Marquette Lake. North of the river, Bus. US 31 passes through an industrial area on the edge of Ludington in Pere Marquette Township. The business spur terminates at an intersection with US 10 east of downtown. Ludington was bypassed in 1989 with the extension of the US 31 freeway in Mason County. The former route of US 31 along Pere Marquette Highway north of the freeway was retained as an unsigned highway. In 2005, it was designated as Bus. US 31. In 2016, the business route was dedicated as a part of the West Michigan Pike Pure Michigan Byway. Major intersections See also * References External links * *Former Bus.

She received her B.A. in Psychology from Clark University, where she was awarded a New England Psychological Association undergraduate Honorary Fellow.  Research  Killen, along with Adam Rutland, developed the Social Reasoning Developmental (SRD) model which identifies three factors, morality, group identity, and psychological knowledge, that bear on how individuals make social decisions, evaluate intergroup contexts, and display social biases when judging acts to be right or wrong. Morality includes fairness, equality, and rights; group identity includes group dynamics, in-group preferences and outgroup distrust, group advantaged and disadvantaged status, and group functioning; psychological knowledge includes attributions of intentions and mental state knowledge. Killen has received funding from the NSF and the NICHD for a randomized control trial (RCT) of a program developed by her team designed to reduce prejudice and bias and promote positive intergroup friendships in childhood. The program is called Developing Inclusive Youth (DIY) and has a teaching component called Teaching Inclusive Youth (TIY). The long term goal is to implement the program in school districts interested in addressing prejudice and bias in childhood. https://theconversation.com/even- very-young-children-can-become-prejudiced-but-schools-can-do-something-about- it-116936 https://www.aft.org/ae/fall2019/killen In 2011-2012, Killen and her research team were commissioned by Anderson Cooper at CNN AC360 to conduct a study on children's racial biases which aired in April, 2012, and won an Emmy Award for Outstanding News and Analysis, October 1, 2013. https://www.cnn.com/2012/04/02/us/ac360-race-study/index.html Killen serves on the brain trust initiative in the education unit for the National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, D.C., and is a Fellow of the American Psychological Association (APA), Association for Psychological Science (APS), and the Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues (SPSSI).

She was an assistant professor at the University of Victoria Department of Women's Studies and held the chair at the University of Manitoba. She was a significant feminist economic scholar and an advocate of social justice. Pujol wrote essays, histories, and on socio- economic issues affecting women, as well as a bibliography in several volumes on women's contributions to economics. She was known for teaching and writing, in particular a critical studies of economics, and a book, Feminism and Anti- Feminism in Early Economic Thought.Pujol, M. (1992). Feminism and Anti- Feminism in Early Economic Thought. (UK (French): Edward Elgar and US (English): Edward Elgar, 1992). Her academic writing and teaching have been widely influential. In the 1980s and 1990s, Pujol was associated with lesbian- feminism, a movement from which she never distanced herself.Verardi, Donna (1992). Personal notes and conversations with Dr. Mich√®le A. Pujol (Beguine Foundation, Canada). She was a committed and productive scholar who challenged accepted views about the past and the methodologies of economics. Biography =Early life= Pujol was born in Africa, the daughter of a French colonial administrator in Niger and a home economist. She attended college in Paris, studying mathematics, and then going on to study economics at the baccalaureate level on scholarship. She arrived in Paris from French Polynesia just as the Paris riots were occurring and formed her earliest thinking in the collective action of students, workers and the sexual and intellectual liberation happening in France at that time. She was graduated from HECJF in 1973. Drawn to the radicalism of the west coast, she travelled to the United States to complete her master's degree, this time writing in English, at Washington State University. Her doctorate in economics was conferred on her by Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, Canada. Pujol became a professor of Women's Studies, first at the University of Manitoba in 1981 and then associate professor at the University of Victoria from 1990 until her death. Pujol was a popular teacher. =Academic life= Pujol's scholarship was imbued with a commitment to documenting the role of women in the economy and in economics. Her doctoral dissertation at Simon Fraser University formed the basis of her book, Feminism and Anti-Feminism in Early Economic Thought, which extended the scope of the history of economics in two directions. She investigated women's economic role in what she termed the \\"malestream\\" of British classical political economy and early neoclassical economics from Adam Smith to Edgeworth and Pigou, a topic which historians of economics tend to restrict to a discussion of John Stuart Mill (the only central figure in classical or early neoclassical economics to emerge honourably from such scrutiny).Dimand, Robert (1998). Writing on \\"The feminist economic thought of Harriet Taylor (1807-58)\\" in 1995, Pujol established the \\"materialist analysis that distinguishes Taylor from Mill's idealist and male-centred position.\\" As Pujol stated, \\"there cannot be any doubt that Taylor stands on her own as an original and insightful feminist thinker and as an economist and political theorist.\\" Pujol also extended the canon of past economic thought, reviving (and rescuing from what E. P. Thompson called \\"the crushing condescension of posterity,\\") feminist analytical contributions on economic inequality by Harriet Hardy Taylor (later Harriet Taylor Mill), Barbara Leigh Smith Bodichon, Millicent Garrett Fawcett, Eleanor Rathbone, and William Smart. In addition to pioneering the feminist history of economics, Pujol was active in contemporary feminist economics, with particular attention to broadening research methodology. She was engaged in a study of the implementation of pay equity policies in Canada. An associate editor of Feminist Economics,Feminist Economics, Bibliography. from its foundation, Pujol, together with Nancy Folbre, edited an \\"Explorations,\\" section in the Fall 1996 issue on feminist issues in national accounting and on research priorities on nonmarket production.Folbre, N., Pujol, M. (eds) (1996). \\"A Special Issue in Honor of Margaret Reid\\", Feminist Economics, Vol. 2, Number 3 (Fall). Pujol was a founding member of the International Association for Feminist Economics as well as an associate editor of the journal, Feminist Economics, to which she frequently contributed. She completed a book about pay equity in Canada for the University of Manitoba. Pujol also completed research on an important bibliography of 19th Century writings by women economists, published in English posthumously.Madden, K., Seitz, J, Pujol, M. (2004). A Bibliography of Economic Thought to 1940 (New York: Routledge). Atlantis: A Women's Studies Journal, published a special issue, \\"Sexual Economics,\\" in 1999, on feminist economic perspectives, to celebrate the life and work of Pujol. The issue was edited by her colleague, Marjorie Griffin Cohen, at the Department of Women's Studies, Simon Fraser University, British Columbia, Canada. =Personal life= While teaching at Manitoba (1981‚Äì88), she was active in the Winnipeg Gay and Lesbian Society, the Manitoba Action Committee on the Status of Women, and the Winnipeg Native Family Economic Development group. She was coordinator of Women's Studies at the University of Manitoba from 1984 to 1988. During her years in Winnipeg, Pujol was instrumental in organizing the first three Gay Pride Day marches and two Canadian Women's Music festivals. At the University of Victoria, she assisted women student activists with their work at the campus Women's Centre. Pujol was the first instructor to develop a (controversial) lesbian studies course. Her students and friends organized the first annual Lesbian Walk in response to homophobia experienced by Pujol and the Women's Studies Department at the University of Victoria. Published works =Books= =Book chapters=  =Journals and journal articles=  =Lectures= Pujol participated in the History of Economics Society annual meeting at the University of British Columbia in June 1996 with a presentation on her project for extending the canon, a multi- volume anthology of women's contributions to political economy before 1900 which she was editing for publication by Routledge and Thoemmes Press. This major work, of four or more volumes, promises to transform our knowledge of the history of women in economics. A contributor to Out of the Margin: Feminist Perspectives on Economic Theory,Pujol, M. (1995). \\"Feminist Perspectives on Economic Theory\\" (Edith Kuiper and Jolande Saps, eds, New York: Routledge). Pujol presented this work at the 1996 International Association for Feminist Economics (IAFFE) conference in Washington, DC. In 1995, Pujol presented \\"Is This Really Economics? Using Qualitative Research Methods in Feminist Economic Research,\\" to the International Association for Feminist Economics (IAFFE) conference in Tours, France. Death Pujol was diagnosed with cancer in the spring of 1997, and had surgery in early April, during which liver metastasis was discovered. Pujol died on 2 August 1997, at home with her partner, Brook, five months after her diagnosis. Sources * Robert (1998).

Rugs have been woven by the indigenous people of Morocco since the Paleolithic Era. Traditionally, Moroccan rugs have been woven by tribal peoples for their utility rather than for decorative purposes. Twentieth-century Moroccan rugs are widely collected in the West, and are almost always woven by tribes people who do not seek nor possess formal artistic training. History In the historic area encompassing the modern nation of Morocco, the tradition of rug-making is just about as old as it is anywhere in the world. The early adoption of rug-making by native Moroccans is certainly due in large part to the distinctive climate of the region: Moroccan rugs may be very thick with a heavy pile, making them useful for the snow-capped Atlas Mountains; or they may be flat woven and light as to suit the hot climate of the Sahara desert.Moroccan Carpets by Brooke Pickering The nomadic Moroccans and Berber tribes used these pile, knotted and flat- woven carpets as bed coverings and sleeping mats, as well as for self- adornment and burial shrouds. Some of these rugs were also used for as saddle blankets. The designs that most frequently appear in Moroccan rugs are traditional and ancient, passed down from weaver to weaver. Elsewhere in Morocco, most major cities have a unique style or design characteristic that distinguishes their carpets. Perhaps the most important carpet-producing city in Morocco is Fes. The city reached its golden age during the Marinid Dynasty of the thirteenth century. At that point, the city was home to over one hundred dye workers and thousands of artisan embroidery studios located in the city's medina. The coastal capital, Rabat, is famous for carpets woven with floral and diamond-shaped elements, Turkish motifs and a fairly bare field. Moroccan rugs experienced a growth in popularity in the West with mid-century modern designers, such as Le Corbusier, who paired the thick piled Berber rugs with their sleekly designed furniture. Many of these Berber carpets are woven by the Beni Ourain peoples from the Rif Mountains near Taza. Colours vary from neutral shades to popping hues, with designs ranging from ordered geometric shapes to a more free-form, expressive pattern. Part of the appeal to the modernists was the primitivism in the carpets. Unlike the traditional antique Oriental rugs found in Western interior decoration, there is little elegance about these rugs, yet they fit wonderfully with modernist d√©cor. Vintage and antique Moroccan rugs are fairly popular today for their decorative flexibility and reasonable prices compared to other styles of antique rugs. The composition of the Moroccan rug is often dedicated to birth or fertility in general. In many rugs, the sequence of motifs indicates the course of an event. It may then appear as a mirror of feminity and of the phases in the life of a woman. In some cases with a little imagination, one can clearly recognize childhood and virginity, bridal state, union, pregnancy, birth pains, birth and the newborn child.

It lies on the estuary of the River Ribble. The pier, designed by A. Dowson, was completed in 1885 and was one of the earliest public buildings in St Anne's, a 19th-century planned town. The pier was originally intended to be a sedate promenading venue for the resort's visitors, but attractions were later added. Changes made to the estuary channels to improve access to Preston Dock left the pier on dry land and ended its steamer services to Blackpool and Liverpool. A Tudor-style entrance was built in 1899. Early 20th-century additions included a Moorish-style pavilion in 1904 and the Floral Hall in 1910. The Moorish Pavilion was destroyed by fire in 1974, shortly after the town's centenary; the Floral Hall burned down in 1982. Originally long, the pier was reduced to by the demolition of the seaward end. English Heritage has designated the pier a Grade II listed building. Background St Anne's-on-the-Sea is a planned seaside resort on the Fylde coast, at the mouth of the River Ribble, in Lancashire. It was developed in the 19th century, largely by the St Anne's Land & Building Company. The company was formed in 1874 and leased land for the new town from the estate of the local Clifton family. Towards the end of the 19th century, pleasure piers became a common feature of English seaside resorts, and by the 1870s there were already two piers in nearby Blackpool (now called North and Central Piers), one in Southport and one away in Lytham. The wording of the land company's original lease indicates that a pier was probably planned for St Anne's from its beginning. A subsidiary, the St Anne's-on-the-Sea Pier and Improvements Company was formed in 1877. The company directors believed that a pier at St Anne's would offer visitors better conditions for fishing and boating than those at neighbouring resorts. Construction There was some delay in building the new pier because of an economic downturn. Engineers inspected the site in 1879, and construction began in 1880. The architect was A. Dowson. The pier is constructed of cast iron columns and lattice girders with wooden decking and intricate decorative iron-work on the deck. The columns were sunk to a depth of . The original structure was long and wide. It included a band kiosk built of glass and iron. Construction cost ¬£18,000 and took more than five years. The pier was opened by Frederick Stanley on 15 June 1885, in a ceremony attended by local dignitaries, school children, the Preston Militia band, and the Order of Mechanics. The opening featured the launch of a lifeboat named the Laura Janet, whose crew was lost the following year in the Southport and St Anne's lifeboats disaster. In 1891 a wooden landing jetty at the end of the pier was extended, in an L shape, by engineering and architecture firm Garlick and Sykes. The new iron extension was three storeys high and measured long by wide. After its addition, the pier was in length. The jetty was used for steamer services from Blackpool and Liverpool. The passing of the Ribble Navigation and Preston Dock Act of 1883 led to dredging of the river channels to improve access to Preston Dock. These changes to the estuary meant that the pier was eventually left on dry land, ruining the resort's steamer trade. A new entrance building was constructed in 1899 to a design by J. D. Harker. This was built in the Mock Tudor style of red brick with imitation timber framing. In 1901 work began to enlarge the pier and add a Moorish-style pavilion. It had a seating capacity of 920 and measured by . The width of the pier was increased to . These additions were also undertaken by Garlick and Sykes and opened on 2 April 1904. In 1910, further additions included the Floral Hall, adjacent to the Moorish Pavilion at the seaward end. The hall‚Äîa winter garden and concert hall‚Äîhad a seating capacity of 850; it was built of steel and plate glass to a design by Arnold England. Attractions In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the developers of St Anne's were keen to attract a more refined market than Blackpool's working-class excursionists. The pier was originally intended to provide little more than a sedate promenading facility for the resort's visitors; initially the only other attractions were a band kiosk and a sweet shop. The pier's Floral Hall hosted concerts and music hall acts. Its first resident orchestra was Miss Kate Erl and Her Ladies Orchestra. Subsequent conductors of the pier's orchestra were Clarice Dunnington, William Rees, Lionel Johns and Norman George. Artists who have performed on the pier include Gracie Fields, Leslie Henson, Russ Conway and George Formby. In 1954, an amusement arcade was added to the pier; this now occupies three quarters of the length of the structure. Alterations later that decade included the addition of a restaurant and replacement of the decking. By the 1970s the pier's amusements included crazy golf, a miniature zoo and live theatre performances. Damage and recent history The remains of the pier's landing jetty In 1962 the holdings of the St Anne's Land & Building Company (including the pier) were bought by the Amalgamated Investment Company, based in London. Some alterations to the pier were made by the new owners, including the addition of an aviary and a reptile house. The Floral Hall was refurbished and turned into a Tyrolean-style beer garden. A centenary concert for the town by violinist Yehudi Menuhin was held on 7 June 1974 and attended by Anne, Princess Royal. On the night of 20 July, the Moorish Pavilion (known from 1970 as the Sultan's Palace) was destroyed in a fire. On 6 December 1976, following the liquidation of the Amalgamated Investment Company, the pier was bought by the Webb family for ¬£30,000. They initially planned to repair the fire damage. The Floral Hall, which had been adjacent to the Moorish Pavilion, was destroyed by fire on 23 July 1982; the pavilions were deemed irreparable and the seaward end of the pier was demolished. Following protests against the demolition by campaigners, the local council decided that the final should be retained to protect the character of the pier, so the remains of the ruined landing jetty still exist. The pier, most of which is enclosed, now ends with an uncovered stretch of deck that opens out into two hexagonal platforms with small pavilions and shelters. The length of the remaining intact structure is . The pier's 21st-century attractions include the amusement arcade, caf√©s and shops; the seaward end is usually closed to visitors. English Heritage designated St Anne's Pier a Grade II listed building on 21 September 1973. It is listed as part of a group of promenade structures that includes a bandstand, a lifeboat monument, a pavilion and two shelters. Lynn F. Pearson (1991) writes that the pier's Moorish Pavilion and Floral Hall were \\"two of the best [pier pavilions] in design terms\\". According to Chris Mawson and Richard Riding (2008), the pier is \\"well regarded\\" for its wrought iron work.

It is widely regarded as the only genuinely \\"hand-rolled\\" bagel on the wholesale market. While the 20th century saw a universal move by bagel companies towards the machine-automated forming of bagels, Davidovich continued to employ artisans to handcraft and kettle- boil bagels in the Viennese tradition. This practice was popularized in New York bakeries as New York City emerged as the bagel-making capital of the world. This adherence to the labor-intensive craft of making bagels, while even the most popularly identified brands of bagels have automated the process, has become their mark of distinction in the industry. Additionally they continue to use the kettle boiling process as well as turning the bagels by hand on wooden planks in old-fashioned stoves designed in the 1950s, another traditional practice which has been widely eliminated due to cost of labor. The business was started in 1998 when the founders were trying to locate a genuinely hand-rolled bagel and discovered that one did not exist in New York wholesale market. They outlined and executed a business plan founded on the concept that the most discriminating bagel consumer would understand and would be able to identify the distinction between a traditional bagel and the automated variety. In 2011 Davidovich Bakery joined the All Natural Products Inc. family, which includes such artisan bakers as The Bakery of New York and NY Artisan Bakers. Davidovich Bagels are certified Kosher and Pareve by OK, one of the nation's largest certifying organizations. The company's main bakery is currently in Woodside, New York. The company's yellow box trucks bearing their corporate slogan \\"All other bagels wish they were a Davidovich Bagel too!\\" can often be seen in the early morning hours making deliveries throughout New York City. The onset of 2012 found the artisan techniques employed by the Davidovich Bakery being featured in stories in The Wall Street Journal and on ABC News. On Saturday, January 5, 2013, The History Channel premiered a documentary entitled 101 Fast Foods That Changed The World. This program ranked the Bagel as the #12 most significant portable, or \\"Fast\\" food and recognized Davidovich Bagels as being the modern link to this traditional, iconic product. CEO Gene Davidovich was prominently featured in this program for his expertise in Bagel history and Artisan techniques. October 10, 2013, marked the grand opening of the company's first corporate- owned retail Davidovich NYC Bagel store in the historic Essex Street Market. On December 9, 2013 the Davidovich Bagels' artisan process was featured on the popular Travel Channel program, Bizarre Foods with Andrew Zimmern. On November 3, 2015 it was announced that Davidovich would be opening a new retail location in the Chelsea Market in early 2016. In September 2016 it was announced that Davidovich would be partnering with The Carol M. Baldwin Breast Cancer Research Fund for the sale of a signature Pink Bagel for National Breast Cancer Awareness Month. A portion of the proceeds would be donated for the benefit of Stony Brook University Hospital. In March 2018 Davidovich Bakery announced their nomination of actor, Stephen Baldwin, as a spokesperson in the campaign for Breast Cancer Awareness. In August 2018 Davidovich launched a serial, short form talk show, called Bagel Talk. This interview program, set in the backdrop of the Essex Street Market, features notable guests from the world of Artisan baking, New York City history and politics, and social issues associated with New York City's food and culture.

The 2011 release was limited to 1,510 pairs, while the 2016 release was limited to 89 pairs.How to Get the 2016 Nike Mag on Nike News, October 04, 2016 Nike has stated Mag is not meant for heavy activity and should not be worn for recreational purposes. They were produced mostly for display. History Back to the Future, in a trilogy of films, was a box office success. In 1989, Nike Inc. designer Tinker Hatfield was asked to create a shoe for the second installment of the series, which was partly set in the then-futuristic year of 2015. The shoe had features such as light-up panels and self-fastening laces. Redesign Over 15 years later, an online petition that asked for the return of the shoes caught the attention of Tinker Hatfield. He and footwear innovator Tiffany Beers (designer of the Nike Kyrie sneaker line) worked on the redesign for approximately six years and had to restart about three times. After thousands of hours of work, the shoes were a replica of the 1989 Nike MAG worn by Marty McFly. The shoes feature an electroluminescent out-sole, space age materials, and a rechargeable internal battery good for 3,000 hours. They are the first rechargeable pair of footwear by Nike. Power laces, a prominent feature of the shoe in the film, are not present. 2011 release Nike Mag shoes in 2011 A limited quantity of 1,500 pairs were auctioned on eBay on September 8, 2011 and all proceeds were being dedicated to The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's disease research. Online sales of the shoe ranged between US$2,300 and US$9,959. 10 additional pairs, packaged in presentation boxes, were sold exclusively by Nike at live auctions around the world, for a total of 1,510 pairs. A total of US$4.7 million was raised from the online auctions. Sergey Brin, co-founder of Google, and his wife Anne Wojcicki agreed to match all donations of the Michael J. Fox Foundation, up to US$5 million up to the end of 2011. This brought the total proceeds from the online auctions to US$9.4 million. 2016 release While Tinker Hatfield was working with Nike, according to his research, basketball athletes were hurting their feet by lacing their shoes too tight in their games on and off court. He wondered if there was a way to eliminate that, make a shoe that would lace automatically to adjust to your foot specifically. That is when he started working on a self-lacing technology that was later on named, E.A.R.L. (Electro Adaptive Reactive Lacing). When the technology was developed, they were originally going to release it first on a basketball shoe. However, Tinker Hatfield ended up putting it in the Nike Mag to fulfill the public's wish.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaSvGVhtszo&t;=135s Then on October 21, 2015, which is the same date Marty McFly visited the future in Back to the Future Part II, Nike unveiled a self-lacing version of the Nike Mag which was scheduled to go on sale March 20, 2016.

A rather large puffball, it may reach dimensions of up to broad by tall. Widespread in northern temperate zones, it is found frequently on pastures and sandy heaths. Taxonomy This puffball has been variously placed in the genera Bovista, Lycoperdon, Calvatia, and Utraria. In 1989, German mycologist Hanns Kreisel described the genus Handkea to include species of Calvatia that had distinct microscopic features: Handkea species have a unique type of capillitium (coarse thick- walled hyphae in the gleba), with curvy slits instead of the usual pores. Although accepted by some authors, the genus concept has been rejected by others. Phylogenetic analyses published in 2008 shows that Handkea may be grouped in a clade along with species from several other genera, including Lycoperdon, Vascellum, Morganella, Bovistella, and Calvatia. Published in the same year, another DNA analysis of the structure of ITS2 rDNA transcript confirmed that H. utriformis is closely related to Lycoperdon echinatum. Description Sterile pestle-shaped base of the puffball. Like all puffballs, Handkea excipuliformis has a gasteroid basidiocarp, meaning the spores are produced internally, and are only released as the mature fruiting body ages and dries, or is broken. Young puffballs are typically across, white, or pale grey-brown; in maturity it may attain dimensions of broad by tall. The underside of the puffball is attached to the ground by a root-like assemblage of hyphae called a rhizomorph. This fungus comprises two parts. The upper, globe-like section, which is white at first and turns ochre as it ages, is initially covered in soft, pointed warts; these fall off to leave a smooth, matt surface. Inside this rounded head the spores develop. The brown spores are released into the air; this process is often hastened by rain, or by being trodden on by cattle. Eventually, all that remains is the sterile pestle- shaped base. The stipe expands once the head has ruptured and released the spores and then remain intact throughout the winter and into the following summer. It is parallel or slightly tapering in at the base; spongy; surface soon becoming wrinkled; initially white with pointed warts, but later turning ochre and becoming smooth and leathery.First Nature Retrieved : 2011-09-05 Spores Initially the spore mass (gleba) is white, later becoming olive and then purple-brown at maturity. Spores are 3.5 to 5.5 micrometres, warted and ball shaped. Distribution and habitat Common and widespread from late summer until autumn. The pestle puffball Grows singly or in small groups in humus soil in both coniferous and broadleaf woodland and on short grassland. Frequent beneath hedges, on wasteland and in all kinds of woods; particularly common on the edges of woodland clearings. Edibility Upper surface of a Pestle Puffball This fairly large puffball is edible only when the spore bearing flesh is young, and white. The taste and odour are not distinctive. Edible only when young and white throughout. It tastes very similar to the giant puffball, but the flesh is not quite as firm and the outer skin should be removed.H. excipuliformis Retrieved : 2011-09-08 Similar species Handkea perlatum is much smaller, has a shorter stipe, and retains a mesh-like pattern when the warts are rubbed off the cap.

The operation was carried out in June 1944, by a small force of 60 men drawn from the 2nd Independent Parachute Brigade. Their objective was to land behind German positions in the Abruzzo region near Trasacco and interdict supply lines and the movement of troops as they withdrew from Sora to Avezzano. The operation had mixed fortunes, the Germans responded in force, using a brigade of troops to hunt down the parachutists and a division was held in reserve instead of moving to the front. However the British parachutists were almost immediately after landing attacked and had to evade the German searchers. Little over a week later, when the mission ended less than half the force returned safely to British lines. Background The 1st Airborne Division landed in Italy in September 1943, during Operation Slapstick. By the end of the year the majority of the division had been withdrawn to England, for operations in Northern Europe. Leaving the 2nd Parachute Brigade behind as an independent formation.Saunders, p.263 Without a dedicated air force transport aircraft formation, opportunities for parachute operations were limited and the brigade was used in a ground role as normal infantry, taking part in fighting in the Moro River Campaign and the Battle of Monte Cassino.Cole, pp.57‚Äì58 In May 1944, the brigade was withdrawn to a rest area near Salerno, and three officers and 57 men, were selected to carry out Operation Hasty.Saunders, p.268 The mission was planned by the commander of the British Eighth Army Lieutenant-General Oliver Leese. The objective was to disrupt the Germans from carrying out the destruction of bridges, and other infrastructure as they withdrew from Sora to Avezzano in the Abruzzo region of Italy to the Pisa‚ÄìRimini section of the Gothic line.Cole, p.58 During the planning stage it had been originally intended to use a complete battalion for the mission, but Brigadier Pritchard in command of the brigade decided to use a smaller unit and at the same time attempt to convince the Germans a larger force was being deployed by dropping dummy parachutists.Harclerode, p.407 The smaller detachment commanded by Captain Fitzroy-Smith was drawn from the 6th (Royal Welch) Parachute Battalion, supported by medics from the 127th (Parachute) Field Ambulance and signallers from the Brigade Signals Company. Mission The 60 man detachment took off from Gaudo Airfield at 19:00 1 June 1944, in three Douglas Dakota aircraft accompanied by another eight aircraft carrying the dummy parachutists, belonging to the American 8th Airlift Squadron. The aircraft reached the drop zone near Trasacco by 20:30, and the landing was successful with only one injury, a man with a broken rib. At 21:00 the force had assembled at their rendezvous and radio contact was established with the 2nd New Zealand Infantry Division who were in overall command of the mission and arrangements made for the planned resupply parachute drops to go ahead. Fitzroy-Smith established a patrol base and the detachment was divided into three patrols each commanded by an officer. Parachute Regiment soldier in 1943 German reaction to the landing was swift and their reconnaissance patrols were in the area within 20 minutes and the British base located and attacked within 24 hours. Avoiding a pitched battle the three patrols split up and for the next seven days disrupted German convoys and demolition parties. In response to the British presence a German brigade was detailed to locate the force and a division, held back in reserve instead of moving to reinforce the front line.Ferguson, p.14 During their search for the parachutists amongst other casualties, the Germans captured the detachments signallers and radio contact with the New Zealand division was lost when the detachments sole remaining radio was damaged.Harclerode, pp.407‚Äì408 By 7 June it was decided to withdraw the detachment, but with no radio working there was no way to pass on the decision. The 2nd Parachute Brigade commander, Brigadier Pritchard then came up with the idea of dropping leaflets around the area with the message \\"Proceed Awdry forthwith\\". The message meant little to the Germans, but the British knew that Captain Awdry was the 6th Parachute Battalion's liaison officer assigned to the 2nd New Zealand Division. The detachment then split up into smaller groups and attempted to make their own way back to the Allied lines.Harclerode, p.408 Aftermath Of the 60 man detachment involved in Operation Hasty, only two officers and 25 men successfully returned to Allied lines. Little physical or material damage was caused to the Germans, but a small measure of success was the diversion of a brigade to hunt down 60 men and the loss of a division, retained behind the front line during the mission. The Germans succeeded in withdrawing to the Gothic line, and held the Allies there until mid September when following the Battle of Rimini, the city was captured.Jackson, p.296 Although Hasty was one of only two British airborne operations on mainland Italy during the war, the 2nd Parachute Brigade went on to carry out two bigger airborne operations, involving the whole brigade later the same year. In August they participated in Operation Dragoon the invasion of the South of France, and in October, Operation Manna in Greece.Cole, p.67 Citations References  Category:Military operations of World War II involving Germany O Category:Airborne operations of World War II Category:Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom) Category:1944 in Italy Category:Conflicts in 1944 Category:June 1944 events ","title":"Operation Hasty"},{"id":"33027178","text":"HMAS Lusair is a former Royal Australian Navy (RAN) base located at Torokina, on Bougainville Island, Papua New Guinea.

That was a great thing, but we‚Äôre off that.‚Äù History The show was initially announced in early 2011, after Los Angeles hip hop collective Odd Future began to receive mainstream recognition. It was said to be like a combination of Jackass and Chappelle's Show. The show was originally going to be named Blackass, a portmanteau of the TV series Jackass and the fact that most of the cast is black. Blackass was originally used by Snoop Dogg for his MTV sketch show 'Doggy Fizzle Televizzle' in 2002 so the title was changed to Loiter Squad. It was not until September 8, 2011 that the show was finally confirmed as a 15-minute live action show composed of various sketches, man on the street segments, pranks and music made by Odd Future. Loiter Squad premiered on Sunday, March 25, 2012 on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim programming block. Episode 4 featured an appearance from Jackass alumnus Johnny Knoxville while fellow Jackass cast members Bam Margera, Chris Pontius and Dave England have also made guest appearances. Other appearances have included rappers Xzibit, Lil Wayne and Juicy J, actor Seth Rogen, and Indie rock musician Mac Demarco. In 2012, it was announced that Earl Sweatshirt and Blake Anderson would join the cast at the show's second season. Loiter Squad was renewed for a third season and premiered on May 15, 2014. It was produced by Gorilla Flicks, the new production company of Jeff Tremaine, and by Camp Flog Gnaw, the production company of Tyler, the Creator.

Author of novels The True History of Paradise and The Pirate's Daughter, short stories, articles, and a screenplay about a female Jamaican athlete, Photo Finish, purchased by Oprah Winfrey (Harpo-Disney). Cezair-Thompson is a professor of literature and creative writing at Wellesley College. Portrait of Margaret Cezair-Thompson painted by Dudley J. Thompson  Early life and education  Margaret Cezair- Thompson was born in Kingston, Jamaica, where she attended Saint Andrew's High School for Girls. As the daughter of Dudley J. Thompson, noted Jamaican QC who served as Jamaican Justice Minister and then as a diplomat, Cezair-Thompson recognizes her father's influence in her work: \\"My father's life has spanned almost a century of Caribbean and African history and being a lover both of history and storytelling and having a father who had so many first-hand stories of great events and people influenced me enormously.\\"\\"Lauded Caribbean author to give reading - Cezair-Thompson chosen for Visiting Scholar post at Bermuda College\\", Bermuda Sun, 13 April 2007. He met her mother in Manchester, England, where Cezair-Thompson's maternal grandfather, Dr. Hubert Cezair, was a West Indian doctor. Cezair-Thompson left Jamaica to study English literature at Barnard College (where she was mentored by Marjorie Housepian Dobkinhttps://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/fl- xpm-2008-08-10-0808070263-story.html#) and Columbia University. She then went on to complete her PhD at Graduate Center of the City University of New York where she wrote her dissertation on V. S. Naipaul with the help of legendary critic Alfred Kazin. Although she has lived outside Jamaica for many years, Cezair-Thompson retains strong ties to her native country. Like many characters in her novels, she was a child when Jamaica became an independent nation in 1962, and she has witnessed the country's changes. She currently lives in Massachusetts where she continues to work and write.  Literary style  Her work has been compared to that of William Faulkner, George Lamming and Jamaica Kincaid.Randall Kenan, \\"Margaret Cezair-Thompson\\", Bomb 69, Fall 1999. Bombsite, The Artist's Voice since 1981. Among the themes in her work is the individual quest for place and identity within the tumult of history. She is not only interested in Jamaica's history but how Jamaica's history connects to history at large: \\"Growing up as a child in Jamaica, it never seemed as though my history was in any way connected to the great moments in European history except when it came to talking about slavery, but now I'm seeing all the ways in which [formerly marginalized] areas were very much players in world events and bigger history.\\"Sibree, Bron. \\"Jamaican Seduction\\", Courier Mail (Brisbane), 12 April 2008. She feels part of a growing tradition of post-colonial writers \\"very much claiming back their part in a bigger history.\\" Many critics also praise Cezair-Thompson's ability to evoke the \\"genuine essence of Jamaica\\" in her descriptions of the Jamaican landscape, flora and culture.The Pirate's Daughter: Summary, BookBrowse. The writers (and books) of special interest to Cezair-Thompson include Edith Wharton, Virginia Woolf, Thomas Hardy, Paule Marshall, Ben Okri, Jean Rhys, William Shakespeare, James Joyce (Dubliners), William Makepeace Thackeray (Vanity Fair), Joseph Conrad (Heart of Darkness), William Butler Yeats, Derek Walcott, and Wallace Stevens.  Publications and awards  The True History of Paradise, Cezair-Thompson's first novel, follows Jean Landing on a drive across the mountains as she attempts to flee Jamaica for the United States. During the ride, she recalls memories of her own fractured past as she notes the increasingly violent confrontations between political factions of her island nation:\\"The True History of Paradise - Shortlisted for the Dublin International I.M.P.A.C. Award 2000\\" . Author's website. :\\"Ghosts stand on the foothills of this journey. She smells their woody ancestral breath in the land's familiar crests and undulations. She has heard them all her life, these obstinate spirits, desperate to speak, to revise the broken grammar of their exits. They speak to her, Jean Landing, born in that audient hour before daylight broke on the nation, born into the knowledge of nation and prenation, the old noises of barracks, slave quarters, and steerage mingling in her ears with the newest sounds of self-rule. On verandas, in kitchens, in the old talk, in her waking reveries and anxious dreams, she has heard their stories.\\" The True History of Paradise was shortlisted for the International Dublin Literary Award in 2000. Cezair-Thompson's second novel, The Pirate's Daughter, focuses more on pre-independent Jamaica, including the years that the famous swashbuckler, Errol Flynn, lived there. The novel, which imagines an affair between the star and a beautiful local, Ida, is a coming-of-age story not only of the female protagonist but of the island itself, and it subtly explores the legacies of colonialism. As one reviewer wrote, \\"Jamaica feels like another character in the book.\\" Cezair-Thompson once described her choice of subject for The Pirate's Daughter, saying, \\"My mother told me how women in Jamaica fainted when they saw Flynn because he was so handsome. That story amused and fascinated me as a child without my realizing why. Now I think it's something to do with the impact of two very different worlds colliding: glamorous, mesmerizing Hollywood and small Jamaica which was still a colony at the time and more susceptible to outside influence.\\"\\"My Life as a Pirate's Daughter or Adventures with Errol Flynn,\\" Margaret Cezair-Thompson, Headline/Hachette UK, 2008. Focusing on the transitional period of Jamaica in the 1940s and 1950s, immediately preceding independence, in which physical and psychological manifestations of a British colony still prevailed, The Pirate's Daughter won the Essence Literary Award for Fiction in 2008, People Critic's #1 Choice in 2007, and the ABA Book Sense #1 Pick for October 2007.

His research interests are the regulation of body fluids and the pathophysiology of blood pressure and its effects on the kidneys. He also focuses on the renin angiotensin system, a hormone system that helps regulate long-term blood pressure and blood volume in the body and which is controlled primarily by the kidneys. His clinical research has included polycycstic kidney disease, renal stones and hypercalcemia. Martinez-Maldonado has occupied numerous important jobs, including Vice President for Research at Oregon Health and Sciences University (1998-2000), President and Dean of the Ponce School of Medicine (2000‚Äì2006). He was the executive vice president for research at the University of Louisville from 2000‚Äì2009.Mart√≠nez-Maldonado named executive VP for research Early years Mart√≠nez Maldonado, born in the southern town of Yauco, Puerto Rico, was an only child. He received his primary education in Holy Rosary School in Yauco, St Joseph School in San Germ√°n and Holy Spirit School in Hato Rey. His secondary education took place in the Matienzo Cintron School in Santurce and the JJ Osuna School in Hato Rey. He attended the University High School and was the president of the graduating class in 1954. After graduating from high school, he entered the University of Puerto Rico, where he studied chemistry and literature. In his sophomore year, Mart√≠nez Maldonado decided that he would like to study medicine instead of literature. He graduated magna cum laude and was accepted at Temple University School of Medicine (TUSM), in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania where he earned his medical degree. After residency in internal medicine at the San Juan VA Hospital and University Hospital, he completed his postdoctoral study on renal and electrolyte metabolism at the Southwestern Medical School of the University of Texas. Mart√≠nez Maldonado became interested in the field of renal physiology and, later on, in nephrology, and was accepted by the Dallas Southwestern Nephrology Division, where he became an investigator and carried out many of his initial experiments.Martinez Founders Medal Presentation He became an independent investigator at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston where he rose from an assistant to a full professor of medicine with tenure (1968‚Äì1973). Nephrology is a branch of internal medicine and pediatrics dealing with the study of the function and diseases of the kidney.American Society of NephrologyFacts and StatisticsFAQ Scientific investigations Mart√≠nez Maldonado perfected a technique that could measure the osmolality of samples (nanoliters) of proximal tubar fluids. He and his colleagues at Baylor designed a clinical treatment for hypercalcemia that was in use until the beginning of this century when specific medicantions were developed for the condition. In 1973, Mart√≠nez Maldonado ended his professorship at Baylor University to become Associate Chief of Staff for Research at the San Juan Veterans Administration Medical Center, and professor and Chair of the Department of Physiology, and Professor of Medicine at the University of Puerto Rico School of Medicine. During his time at Baylor College of Medicine he published 39 original investigations in various journals such as the Journal of Clinical Investigation, the New England Journal of Medicine and the American Journal of Physiology.. This scholarly activity continued in his Renal Metabolic Laboratory at the San Juan VA and the department of Physiology. He rescued the department of physiology by recruiting new faculty staff and sending students to train in important physiology departments in the United States and recruiting them back to the island. He is credited for the development of an outstanding training program for internal medicine at the San Juan VA and responsible for the identification of talent among his students. Many of those occupy important positions in academic medicine and clinical practice in Puerto Rico and the United States.

The farmstead provided a setting, and its occupants characters, for several of the works of author Willa Cather, who grew up in Webster County. Sad√≠lek and Cather The family of Bohemian immigrants Franti≈°ek and Antonie Sad√≠lek arrived in Webster County in 1880; their daughter, Antonie (Annie), was twelve years old at that time. Three years later, the Cather family moved from Virginia to Nebraska, bringing their nine- year-old daughter Willa. The Cathers initially settled with relatives on the Divide, a narrow region of flat-lying plains between the watersheds of the Big Blue River to the north and the Republican River to the south. A year later, they moved into the city of Red Cloud to the south. According to Willa Cather, she often saw Annie Sad√≠lek during her youth. The wagon road from the Catherton precinct to Red Cloud passed near the Sad√≠lek farm; and Annie later moved to Red Cloud, where she worked as a hired girl. The young Cather was intrigued by the immigrants who had settled in south-central Nebraska, and by the Czechs in particular. In a 1923 essay, she wrote > Many of our Czech immigrants were people of a very superior type. The > political emigration resulting from the revolutionary disturbances of 1848 > was distinctly different from the emigration resulting from economic causes, > and brought to the United States brilliant young men from both Germany and > Bohemia. In 1890, Cather graduated from Red Cloud High School and moved to Lincoln to enroll in the University of Nebraska. In 1892, Annie Sad√≠lek went west with a railroad employee. Shortly after, she returned to the family farm and bore her first child, a daughter named Lucille. In 1896, she married John Pavelka; the family subsequently grew to ten children, including Lucille, who took the name Pavelka. Pavelka farmstead Pavelka farmstead, viewed from the south along county road 1100 In 1906, the Pavelkas bought a farm on the Divide, in the northern part of a small region settled by Bohemians. Soon thereafter, possibly in 1911, they bought a one-story two-room house, probably built in the late 19th century, which they moved from a nearby farm to their own. By 1915, they had constructed a -story addition on the south side, expanding the house to seven rooms. The house lies along the east side of a courtyard centered on the well, delimited by farm buildings and trees. A large barn with its associated fencing forms the west side. Smaller sheds and granaries lie along the north and south sides; there are shelterbelts on the south and the north, with the remains of an orchard in the north shelterbelt. The principal entrance of the house opens into the courtyard rather than toward the road, in keeping with traditional Czech village construction. A brick-vaulted cellar, with its entrance southwest of the house, was constructed at some time after the house's expansion. Cuzak and Rosicky Cather had remained in touch with her friends in Webster County, although she had moved from Nebraska to Pittsburgh and then to New York. In the fall of 1916, she paid an extended visit to Annie Pavelka. By the end of that year, she had the idea for My √Åntonia; the book was completed by about the middle of 1918. The characters of √Åntonia Shimerda Cuzak and Anton Cuzak were based on Annie and John Pavelka; the Pavelka place is described in the final chapter, \\"Cuzak's Boys\\", with a scene set in the cellar (in the novel, called the \\"fruit cave\\"). The Pavelkas are also the models for Anton and Mary Rosicky in Cather's 1932 story \\"Neighbour Rosicky\\"; and the Pavelka farmstead is the setting of the story. Later history John Pavelka died in 1926; Anna Pavelka, in 1955. At some time after both of them had died, probably in the 1950s, the house was remodelled: the porch was enclosed and given two external doors, and a south- facing gable window was raised. Several of the sheds have undergone significant deterioration. In 1979, the property was listed in the National Register of Historic Places. It is part of the Willa Cather State Historic Site, a collection of 26 individual sites and four historic districts in Webster County that are connected with Cather and her work.

The UK Albums Chart is a music chart that calculates the best-selling artist albums of the week in the United Kingdom. For the purposes of inclusion in the chart an album is defined by the Official Charts Company (OCC) as being a type of music release that features more than four tracks and lasts longer than 25 minutes. At the beginning of the 1980s, sales of singles and albums in the United Kingdom were compiled on behalf of the British music industry by the British Market Research Bureau (BMRB). This continued until the end of 1982, when the contract to compile the UK charts was won by Gallup, who took over on 4 January 1983, the first working day of 1983. Gallup continued to compile the UK charts throughout the 1980s until January 1994. At the end of 1989 Gallup compiled the list of the best-selling singles of the 1980s, which was broadcast on BBC Radio 1, and published in the music magazine Record Mirror and later in the book Guinness Hits of the 80s. No detailed equivalent list for the best-selling albums of the decade was produced. However, two weeks before the end of the decade, chart compiler Alan Jones published an \\"exclusive recap\\" of the top ten in his regular \\"Chartfile\\" column in Record Mirror. The biggest-selling album of the 1980s in the UK was Brothers in Arms by Dire Straits, which had sold more than 3.2 million copies by the end of 1989. Michael Jackson had the second and third best-selling albums of the 1980s, with Bad just overtaking Thriller by the end of the decade. In fourth place was Greatest Hits by Queen, which had sold over 1.9 million copies by 1989 and would go on to become the UK's biggest-selling album of all time.

He was a popular concert performer in Israel in the 1950s and later became a successful recording artist in the United States. Taube was among the over 1,200 Holocaust survivors saved by Oskar Schindler.  Biography  Moshe Taube was born in Krak√≥w, Poland, in 1927. He began singing and studying music by age 8 in a choir led by his mentor, the prominent cantor Yossele Mandelbaum. In 1939, he and his family were taken by the Nazis in the Krak√≥w ghetto during the Holocaust. In 1942, he and his father were assigned to the Krak√≥w-P≈Çasz√≥w concentration camp, while his mother and sister were sent to their deaths. Dozens of his extended family members were murdered. He and his father were saved in 1945 by the actions of Oskar Schindler, whose story is memorialized in the 1993 film Schindler's List. After being rescued, Taube first lived with a relative in Romania, then a short time later he and his father immigrated to British-ruled Palestine, which became Israel in 1948. Taube immigrated to the U.S. in 1957 and continued his music education at the Juilliard School in New York City. He taught young cantors at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America. In 1965, he became cantor at Congregation Beth Shalom in Pittsburgh, where he served for more than 40 years. From 1971 to 1988, he was an adjunct professor of music at Duquesne University.

Benfica. In relation to his three-year club presidency, he was convicted of embezzlement, document forgery, breach of trust, and money laundering. Presidency of Benfica A drawing of Vale e Azevedo alongside a description of his presidency of Benfica on display at Museu Benfica On 31 October 1997, Vale e Azevedo was elected the 31st president of Portuguese sports club S.L. Benfica, succeeding Manuel Dam√°sio. Vale e Azevedo won the club elections with 51.5% of 19,824 votes, defeating Lu√≠s Tadeu and Ab√≠lio Rodrigues. Soon after, he signed Graeme Souness as coach of the football team. A year and a half later, Souness left the club and stated: \\"Vale e Azevedo lies when he looks in the eyes. Be careful, this man is dangerous\\". On 6 November, Vale e Azevedo declared three contracts between Benfica and Olivedesportos (Controlinveste) void and announced that he would take the case to court. The contracts, which were related to static advertising and broadcasting rights of Benfica football matches, had been signed on 28 March 1996 by his predecessor, Dam√°sio. Eight days later, Vale e Azevedo signed an agreement protocol with SIC for the broadcasting of the club's matches at the Est√°dio da Luz for the 1997‚Äì98 season. On 8 February 1999, Benfica signed a new contract with SIC for the broadcasting rights of all home matches in the Portuguese league from the 1999‚Äì2000 to the 2003‚Äì04 seasons. On 2 November 2000, the contracts with Olivedesportos were declared void in court. During Vale e Azevedo's three-year presidency, which ended on 27 October 2000, Benfica accumulated huge debts and occasionally was not able to pay taxes or player salaries. Moreover, the football team did not win any silverware. Some of his highlights were the creation of Benfica SAD, the idealizasion of Benfica Futebol Campus, the signing of coach Jos√© Mourinho, the cycling team's Volta a Portugal victory in 1999, the informatisation of the club, and the start of the war against Olivedesportos. Vale e Azevedo was succeeded by Manuel Vilarinho following his defeat in the second-most contested elections in the club's history (at the time, the most contested one). In Benfica's General Assembly of 13 May 2005, Vale e Azevedo was expelled as member of the club. Imprisonment and release On 16 February 2001, Vale e Azevedo was arrested at home in Almo√ßageme, Sintra. Months later, on 7 August, he was sent to jail. Prosecutors were concerned that he would leave the country or tamper with evidence. They investigated allegations that he had kept at least $1 million (¬£680,000) from the football transfer of Sergei Ovchinnikov to Alverca FC and that he had laundered cash through offshore banks in the British Virgin Islands. They investigated 14 counts of embezzlement. At the time, it was reported that Vale e Azevedo's yacht, \\"Lucky Me\\", was paid with part of that money. On 17 April 2002, Vale e Azevedo was sentenced to four and a half years in prison in the case and was detained in Lisbon. On 8 July 2004, he was released on ‚Ç¨250,000 bail in the case. On 30 March 2007, he was sentenced to five years in prison in the case. On 11 July, he was sentenced to seven and a half years in prison in the case. On 5 May 2008, the National Republican Guard went to his house to detain him for his connection to the latter case, but he was in London, England. Two months later, on 8 July, he turned himself in at the police station in Belgravia, west London, following a European Arrest Warrant. Vale e Azevedo was extradited to Portugal on 13 November 2012 and was sentenced to ten years in prison on 2 July 2013, for six crimes, and ordered to pay Benfica around ‚Ç¨7 million for the money he kept from the transfers of footballers Scott Minto (¬£500,000), Gary Charles (¬£1,200,000), Tahar El Khalej ($850,000) and Amaral. On 7 June 2016, Vale e Azevedo was released from prison on parole after serving 3 years and 7 months of his 11.5-year sentence. He fled to London in September 2018 on a private jet to escape the 10-year prison sentence ruled in 2013. On 22 January 2019, the Lisbon Appeal Court declared that Vale e Azevedo's alleged crimes of embezzlement of ‚Ç¨1.2 million related to Benfica's television rights, between 1998 and 1999, had expired, 18 years after the alleged crimes. Benfica announced they would appeal the decision to the Supreme Court of Justice.

Later the same year a second hotel was built by Ole √òiene, only 100 metres apart. Turtagr√∏ was a central meeting place for the pioneers of mountaineering in Jotunheimen from the late 1800s, and among the early visitors were William Cecil Slingsby, Howard Priestman and Carl Hall.

Beginning during the late 1990s economic boom, an influx of thousands of African traders and business people, predominantly from West Africa, arrived in Guangzhou and created an African community in the middle of the southern Chinese metropolis. In 2012, it was estimated that there were more than 100,000 Africans living in Guangzhou.The African migrants giving up on the Chinese dream , CNN, 2016-06-26 Since 2014, the city's African population has significantly declined due to strict immigration enforcement by Chinese authorities and economic pressures in home countries including depreciation of the Nigerian naira and Angolan kwanza. Population Dengfeng Subdistrict, Yuexiu District, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China Africans in Guangzhou, 2014. Most of the hundreds of thousands of Africans who arrive in Guangzhou are short term visitors making a purchasing run, making population figures liquid and difficult to estimate. According to official figures, 430,000 arrivals and exits by nationals from African countries were recorded at the city's checkpoints in the first nine months of 2014. Guangzhou officials released official population figures for residents in 2014 due to popular fears of an Ebola outbreak in the city by way of the African community. According to the city, there were 16,000 Africans including North Africans residing in Guangzhou. Of these residents, 4,000 were long-term residents, which is defined by city officials as living for longer than 6 months in the city. Since 2014 the African population has significantly declined, dropping to 10,344 residents by February 2017. A 2014 article in the magazine This Is Africa noted the decrease in population with increased immigration enforcement and foreign exchange difficulties blamed. A September 2016 CNN article on the community claimed that upwards to thousands of African residents had left the city in the previous 18 months. Among African nationalities in Guangzhou, the two countries with by far the most people are the West African nations of Nigeria and Mali. Nigerian people, mostly of the Igbo ethnicity, are most represented among those residing while Malians according to city records are most numerous among long-term residents. Migrants from the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ghana, and Senegal are the remaining African communities in Guangzhou with at least a few hundred registered members at country-based civic organizations in 2014. Neighborhoods There are two main areas where Africans live and do business in Guangzhou: Xiaobei and Guangyuanxi, both areas in the centrally located Yuexiu District. The area of Xiaobei is near Xiaobei station and home to several streets catering to African and Middle Eastern residents. Since the area was home to an existing Muslim population from Ningxia and Xinjiang, many African immigrants, around half of whom are Muslims, congregated around one area of town primarily because of the convenience in finding halal food. Owing to the neighborhood's history there are slightly more Muslim Africans than Christian Africans in Xiaobei. The nerve center of the area is Baohan Straight Street where there are African orientated shops and restaurants. The street was repaved in 2015 and many of the hawkers have departed or set up shops. About from Xiaobei and north of the Guangzhou railway station is Guangyuanxi, a more business orientated area with a major presence of Nigerian Igbo people. The area is filled with large trademarts selling shoes, clothing, and other goods. The trademarts are housed in large buildings called Tong Tong Trade Mart, Tian'en Clothing Market, Tangqi Building, Canaan Market, and Ying Fu Building. Since stricter immigration enforcement in the summer of 2013, this area has become much more dormant than before. History =1990s and 2000s= Since China's economic boom in the 1990s, thousands of Africans migrated to China; most of these migrants were from West Africa. Many Africans left Indonesia and Thailand and went to Guangzhou after the 1997 Asian financial crisis, and the economic opportunity attracted more. In Guangzhou, Africans are generally engaged in commerce, visiting or residing in the city because of its wholesale trading markets supplied by nearby factories. During the 2000s, the city's African population rapidly increased with a 2008 news report stating the number of African residents had increased by 30% to 40% annually. =Riots in 2009 and 2012= Conflict between the African community and police in Guangzhou resulted in riots in 2009 and 2012. In July 2009, two Nigerian men jumped several floors from a building in an attempt to flee Chinese immigration authorities. Both men were hurt from the fall. But on hearing rumors of their deaths, hundreds of Africans, mostly Nigerian, surrounded a local police station. The demonstration escalated into a riot that shut down eight lanes of traffic on a major thoroughfare for several hours. In June 2012, an African held in police custody after a taxi fare dispute died after according to police \\"suddenly losing consciousness\\". Over a hundred Africans gathered at the police station in question demanding the know the cause of death. Guangzhou police responded with a statement that they would \\"investigate and settle this case strictly by law\\" and also that \\"All should abide by the law of China, no one should harm public interests or damage public order.\\" =Stricter immigration enforcement= A large scale immigration enforcement sweep was conducted by local police in July‚ÄìAugust 2013. Media reports have reported a decline in the local African population since 2014 with stricter immigration cited as one of the reasons. The system of immigration that had been in place since 2013 in Yuexiu District appeared to undergo change in summer 2018 with media reports that several low cost hotels and apartments in the area had prohibited African guests or singled out passport holders from Uganda and Nigeria, and shops and restaurants catering to Africans had been closed. The Uganda daily Daily Monitor spoke to Ugandans in Guangzhou who reported being advised to stay in more costly 4 or 5 star hotels, and other sources for the newspaper claimed the crackdown targeting Ugandans had followed an increasing number of criminal suspects in China charged with drug trafficking holding Ugandan passports, with the suspects allegedly being Nigerian citizens that obtained Ugandan passports through bribing \\"rogue\\" Ugandan immigration officials. A newspaper source described as a \\"senior government official\\" in Uganda blamed the Ministry of Internal Affairs for illegally selling Ugandan passports. A spokesperson for the Directorate of Citizenship and Immigration Control, under the Ministry of Internal Affairs, responded that the Uganda passports were stolen or sold by Ugandan individuals. =COVID-19 pandemic= During the COVID-19 pandemic in mainland China, reports became widespread of Africans of Guangzhou being evicted from flats and hotels by landlords, and having difficulty in finding food and shelter as a result. Some became homeless and had to sleep on the street. On 11 April, the United States Consulate General in Guangzhou warned African-Americans to avoid travel to the Guangzhou city, with a report by some African-Americans that \\"some businesses and hotels refuse to do business with them\\". The Consulate further raised a travel warning to announce the discrimination condition against African-Americans in Guangzhou on 13 April. In that warning, it said that Chinese officials might require Africans to participate in the COVID-19 test and undergo a 14-day supervised quarantine at their own expense. Ambassadors in China from many African countries wrote to Foreign Minister of the People's Republic of China, Wang Yi, for asking China to resolve the discrimination problem against Africans in Guangzhou. The chair of African Union Commission, Moussa Faki Mahamat, also summoned Chinese Ambassador to the AU, Liu Yuxi, to express his extreme concern. On 12 April, Zhao Lijian, the spokesperson of Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, said that: He also said in the regular press conference on 13 April that China will address the \\"African friends‚Äô concerns\\" by adopting a series of measures to avoid racist and discrimination problems, and condemned \\"the US had better focus on domestic efforts to contain the spread of the virus. Attempts to use the pandemic to drive a wedge between China and Africa are bound to fail\\". Immigration issues Some Africans have applied for permanent residency or work permits, but they are the minority. Many are traders on tourist visas engaged in import-export between China and Africa. According to Reuters in 2009, there were as many as 100,000 Africans and Arabs in Guangzhou, mostly illegal visa overstayers. Some Africans say that overstaying in China is inevitable because it is impossible to finish off the business they had come for within a 30-day time frame and they cannot afford a plane ticket home. Sociologists Gordon Mathews, Linessa Dan Lin, Yang Yang noted in a study of the local African community that Nigerians, particularly Igbos, are much more likely than other African groups to stay illegally due to \\"masculine pride\\". Based on field interviews, Igbos report being under greater pressure from family and peers to become a success to justify a trip to China. Since 2004 at the latest, illegal immigration has increasingly come into the focus of the police authorities in Guangzhou and later throughout the country. In 2003, campaigns against illegal immigration were conducted in Guangdong and other Chinese provinces, and around 2008, the police repeatedly conducted so- called \\"hurricane\\" campaigns against illegal immigration in Guangdong. In Guangzhou, a regulation has been in force since 2004 under which citizens are requested to report cases suspected of illegal immigration to the police, which can be rewarded with . By 2014 there have been multiple marriages between African and Chinese people, with majority all marriages being between African men and Chinese women. Chinese marriage visas do not legally allow the spouse to work. Many marriages have stability issues due to the difficulties in keeping visas. Majority of the Chinese who live and marry Africans in Guangzhou for example come from the rural poorer provinces Sichuan, Hunan, Hubei. Rural Chinese who marries Africans and foreigners are allowed to have numerous or multiple children compared with the average Chinese citizens.https://africachinareporting.co.za/2014/06/bride-and-prejudice-afro- chinese-marriages-in- guangzhou/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/oct/06/china-crackdown- african-immigration Foreign exchange difficulties In addition to immigration enforcement, another difficulty to navigate for African traders has been the depreciation of several African currencies after the fall in oil prices since 2014. Nigerian traders who are a large part of the African contingent reported being stymied by the difficulty of obtaining foreign currency in Nigeria needed to purchase goods. The Nigerian government had initially reacted to the sharp depreciation in the Nigerian naira by limiting access to foreign exchange and refusing to devalue the official exchange rate. In order to obtain naira, Nigerian traders had to resort to the black market to buy dollars at a 75% premium, making it difficult to turn a profit. The foreign exchange problem proved so discouraging that one long time Nigerian clothing trader in Guangzhou interviewed by the Financial Times reported being unable to fill a single container so far into the year in the middle of 2016. Difficulties were reported by traders with foreign exchange in other African countries including Angola, another top oil producer. Crime Data from Guangdong anti-drug officials indicate that most drug dealers in the province are from Africa or the Middle East. Anti-drug officials quoted by US diplomats in a 2007 diplomatic cable described linguistic difficulties faced by the police in countering African drug dealers, noting some dealers used languages like Igbo, a Nigerian language that police had no capability for understanding. A Nigerian consulate official in Guangzhou estimated in 2017 that on average 1% of Nigerians arriving in Guangzhou would be arrested for a drug-related offense. The Guangzhou Public Security Bureau carried out a major drug bust with 1,300 police officers raiding the Lihua Hotel (Dragon Hotel) in the city's Yuexiu District. The August 2013 raid coincided with an immigration enforcement crackdown in the summer 2013 and led to the arrest of 168 suspects, most of whom were described by police as citizens of Nigeria and Mali. The then Nigerian Ambassador in Beijing, Sola Onadipe, stated that more than 50 of the suspects arrested were holders of Nigerian passports. He noted large amounts of money were found on the suspects and lamented in an interview with the Vanguard, \\"As an embassy, how do you tackle such a thing?\\" The Ambassador in the same interview, a year before planned retirement, was harsh on his countrymen for engaging in what he described as rampant drug trafficking and ill-mannered public behavior (\\"smoking marijuana openly in another man's country\\") and vented \\"it makes you not to enjoy your job\\". Ambassador Onadipe gave the local police credit for fairly adjudicating criminal cases involving Nigerians and pointed out that other African communities in Guangzhou including the neighboring countries of Ivory Coast and Ghana and countries across Francophone Africa didn't get the same level of police attention as Nigerians.

Very inclined to music, he learnt to play the organ in the majestic setting of the cathedral of Miranda do Douro, where the family was then residing. With the death of his father due to cancer when Duarte Lima was only 11 years old, he was pressured to combine studies with work, since his mother, Maria de Jesus, was then left alone with their large offspring.

Even before graduation he married Alexina Lima de Deus and starts to invest in the stock exchange, from where he would reportedly earn a considerable amount of money. An increasingly well known personality in Portuguese politics, Duarte Lima was subjected to heavy media exposure in 1994 when the weekly newspaper O Independente, then directed by Paulo Portas, devoted a lot of headlines to Duarte Lima casting doubt on his alleged sudden enrichment. Calls for an investigation to the Attorney General's Office, did not find criminal evidence, but did not explain the source of such huge income in Duarte Lima's bank accounts.As tr√™s vidas do advogado , Correio da Manh√£ (in Portuguese) Political career Duarte Lima was awarded a degree in law by the Universidade Cat√≥lica Portuguesa (UCP) in 1986, and embraced a career as a lawyer and politician.

Health issues After the O Independente controversial claims had started to fade away, he was diagnosed in 1998 with acute myeloid leukemia, the worst form of the disease with a survival rate below 40%. With multiple admissions to hospital, he survived the disease and received a bone marrow transplant from one of his brothers. During the treatments, he installed an organ in the hospital room that he occupied at the Portuguese Institute of Oncology (IPO) in Lisbon, using headphones to avoid disturbing other patients. Even today, it is the largest object ever sterilized for a patient in the IPO.

Alleged murderer of Rosalina Ribeiro Rosalina Ribeiro was the secretary and lover of Portuguese industrialist Tom√°s Feteira for about 30 years. Tom√°s Feteira died in 2000. In December 2009, Rosalina was murdered in Brazil, near Saquarema, Rio de Janeiro. According to the Portuguese newspaper i, a complaint against Duarte Lima was filed by Feteira's heirs, related to the fate of the money from the legacy of the Portuguese millionaire. Money was in Switzerland and had been transferred to Duarte Lima's bill by Rosalina Ribeiro. The daughter of Tom√°s Feteira, Ol√≠mpia Feteira, the Portuguese businessman who died ten years before and whose fortune had been partly diverted by the former secretary and companion murdered at the end of 2009, in Brazil, said that the lawyer Domingos Duarte Lima had received in 2001, in five transfers, more than 5.2 million Euros. Rosalina Ribeiro lost an action in a Brazilian court, where she claimed part of the fortune on the grounds that she lived maritally with the businessman. However, the court dismissed her claims. The daughter of the businessman wanted since then to know why the father's accounts were handled by his former secretary and questioned the fate of the money that should exceed 30 million euros. In December 7, 2009, Duarte Lima, who represented Rosalina Ribeiro, moved to Rio de Janeiro to have a working meeting with her. In principle they would handle issues related to the assets of the former secretary. They dined together, and 15 minutes after they separated in a deserted spot where Rosalina requested to be taken. The woman, who was 74 years old, was eventually shot. She died with two bullets in the chest and one in the head. The gun used was a .38 caliber revolver.

The luxury Dalen Hotel, once a popular locale for European royalty, is one of the largest wooden buildings in Norway and one of the best preserved hotels of its size from the 1800s. The hotel is located in eastern Dalen on the shores of Bandak lake. The hotel owners operate a ferry service along the Telemark Canal, which during the warmer seasons has daily trips between Skien and Dalen on the historic passenger ships MS Henrik Ibsen and MS Victoria. The hotel can also be accessed by road on Fylkesvei 38 and 45, which extends down from E134 to the north. History Dalen Hotel in Telemark Dalen Hotel van still in use The idea for a hotel in Dalen came with the expansion of the Telemark Canal in 1892. Through a series of staircase locks, the canal from Skien to Norsj√∏ was extended to reach Bandak, with the small town of Dalen as its new endpoint. The canal was referred to as the \\"eighth wonder\\" upon its completion, and the waterway saw heavy traffic from ferries bringing passengers from the east in Oslo and Grenland travelling towards destinations in central and western Norway. The initiative to build a luxury hotel in Dalen was taken by Skien businessman Hans Larsen along with his two associates, merchants Lars R√∏d and Anton Hansen from Skien and Porsgrunn respectively. The men commissioned local Porsgrunn architect Haldor Larsen B√∏rve to design the hotel. B√∏rve, originally from Ullensvang, was a highly trained architect, having studied at universities in Trondheim and later Hannover in Germany. After its opening in 1894, the hotel drew royal guests from all over Europe, playing host to the likes of King Oscar II of Sweden, Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany, King Leopold II of Belgium, King Haakon VII of Norway and his family, and several members of the British aristocracy. During the German occupation of Norway in World War II, Dalen Hotel was used as a resort for German officers. Most of the building's interior was stripped out and sold for parts, and the building fell into disrepair due to lack of proper maintenance. After the war, the building was bought by singer and evangelist Aage Samuelsen with the intent of restoring the hotel to its former glory. Though Samuelsen failed to raise the necessary funds to renovate the building, he gave the hotel significant press exposure, and towards the end of the 1980s restoration efforts began in earnest. The hotel was reopened once the remodelling finished in 1992. In 2000, the hotel was honored with the Europa Nostra award for outstanding conservation. Architecture Dalen Hotel restaurant alt=A lavish, antiquated building interior The hotel, designed by architect Haldor Larsen B√∏rve, was built in the style of a Swiss chalet with elements of National Romanticism and Dragestil. B√∏rve was a German-trained architect well versed in Germanic and Scandinavian tradition, and the result is a distinctive blend of architectural styles in the building's complex carpentry work, dotted with elaborate eaves, cornices, turrets, and spires, and traditional Norse motifs such as dragon heads protruding from its gables. The expansive building, covering almost , is often described as having stories, since the building has two floors except for a taller area in the center and two lofts on either end. The building has a completely symmetrical floor plan, including the two ornate towers in the center and the two wings that extend out from the main lobby. The center of the building is dominated by a grand hall which spans all three floors. The hotel's facade, lounges, dining room, and main lobby are almost identical to how they looked upon the building's completion in 1894, including the original stained glass in the lobby's skylight, which was imported from Berlin. The building's 42 hotel rooms are also very similar to their 1894 counterparts, but the bathrooms were renovated in 2007 to meet modern sanitation standards. The hotel is surrounded by nearly of manicured gardens that extend eastwards toward Bandak lake.

On November 29, 2011, Indiana Jones was added to the game in a chapter dedicated to the character called \\"Calendar of the Sun\\". At this time, the title was changed to Indiana Jones Adventure World. Hal Barwood, the co-writer and co-designer of Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis and writer and designer of Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine worked on Indiana Jones Adventure World in the area of narrative design. Game writer Jonathon Myers has provided narrative support in the wake of Hal Barwood's contribution. Indiana Jones Adventure World was one in a slew of titles shut down by Zynga at the end of 2012 as part of a cost-cutting measure. Plot The game is set in 1930s Middle America. The main character is either a male or a female who has just joined the Adventure Society, and sets up a base camp in an effort to explore ancient ruins.

The investment would be supported by loans from National Irish Bank and Ernst & Young would act as tax consultants on behalf of investors. To put in a maximum of IR¬£25,000 (E31,750) an investor was only required to pay IR¬£7,600 and the remainder would come from bank loans, which would then be repaid when the movie was produced. An individual could then write off 80% of the IR¬£25,000 against tax, leaving IR¬£9,600 repayable by the Irish tax authorities. After the initial investment of IR¬£7,600 this guaranteed a profit of IR¬£2,000. The Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands granted the section 481 certificate for The Ghostly Rental subject to strict guidelines. These included the stipulations that Irish crew would fill 19 senior positions among the 82 staff involved and that the company must produce audited accounts confirming \\"the direct expenditure on the employment of Irish personnel and on the purchase of Irish goods and services to be some IR¬£ 1,121,068\\".Merlin's horror movie: [Final 1 Edition] Dalby, Douglas.

Its type specimen is a natural cast and partial natural mold of a hatchling. From 1994 onwards Ray Stanford uncovered an ichnofauna in Maryland near the border with Washington D.C.. Along with dinosaur footprints the impressions of a neonate nodosaurid were found. The type species Propanoplosaurus marylandicus was named and described by Stanford, David Weishampel and Valerie DeLeon in 2011. The generic name combines the Latin prefix pro~ with the name of the genus Panoplosaurus because the new species lived earlier than ‚Äî but resembled much ‚Äî this already described nodosaurid. The specific name refers to Maryland. The holotype, USNM 540686, was found in the Patuxent Formation, dating from the late Aptian. It consists of the impressions of the back of the head together with a natural cast of the ribcage, some vertebrae, the right forelimb, the right femur and a right foot. The animal is shown lying on its back. The authors rejected the possibility the specimen represented a pseudofossil or an embryo. The specimen is the first nodosaurid skeleton from the eastern seaboard from which previously only nodosaurid teeth named as Priconodon were known, and the first neonate dinosaur from that region. The specimen has a preserved length of thirteen centimetres. The total length of the individual was estimated as between twenty-four and twenty-eight centimetres. Only the skull shows osteoderms and the authors suggest this was a common developmental stage of all nodosaurids, together with a long middle section of the snout which is characterised by a unique cross-pattern of the bone plates, probably formed by the triangular osteoderms of the maxillae. Propanoplosaurus was by the describers assigned to the Nodosauridae.

Accident On December 30, 1986, the Broncos' bus, a mid-1960s Western Flyer D600 Canuck, left the Centennial Civic Centre in the 3:00 PM hour, bound for Regina. The team was on its way to play the Regina Pats. Shortly after entering eastbound Saskatchewan Highway 1 (the Trans-Canada Highway), the bus, travelling at a speed of , hit a patch of black ice in the eastbound lanes of Highway 1 as the road curved to the right over the Canadian Pacific main line. It then slid off the overpass and hit an embankment on a nearby access road, causing the bus to go airborne, and then flipped on its side sliding about 100 metres before coming to rest in a ditch. Many players were able to extricate themselves from the wreck before first responders arrived, giving first aid and attempting to identify where individuals had landed and what their injuries were. Four players who were sitting at the very rear of the coach, Trent Kresse, Scott Kruger, Chris Mantyka, and Brent Ruff (younger brother of then-Buffalo Sabres captain Lindy Ruff), were killed; Mantyka and Ruff were crushed by the rear of the bus and Kresse and Kruger were catapulted from it. Eyewitness of the accident Leesa Culp was the first person to arrive at Kreese and Kruger's sides after the accident to see if any aid could be given.  Aftermath  Following the incident, the four players' jersey numbers were retired by the team. The Broncos still wear a commemorative patch in remembrance of the four players to this day. The rest of the team, led by future NHL star Joe Sakic, who recorded 60 goals, played out the season despite the loss. Future NHLer Sheldon Kennedy was also a member of the team. Shortly after the accident there was confusion between Trent Kresse and recently traded Trent Kaese, who shared the same jersey number, leading many to offer condolences to Trent Kaese's family. Years later, following the 2018 Humboldt Broncos crash, Kennedy recalled the silence after the accident claiming: \\"Everything was in slow motion. It was eerily deaf. There was just no sound at all. I remember us standing in the snow, in stocking feet, in shock...\\" Kennedy has become involved in raising awareness across Canada for children and young adults experiencing trauma and/or abuse, after recognizing the trauma from the accident. Multiple survivors and their families allege that then coach Graham James would not let mental health and other based individuals help the players after the crash, due to James\` fear of his history of sexual abuse being exposed. Bob Wilkie claimed: \\"We weren't allowed to talk about it....My mom wondered for years why we were never given any of the resources we need to cope properly. Those who wanted to help were told 'no' by Graham. Now we know why.\\" However, while professional help was out of the question, player Dan Lambert stated that the entire team banded together and created a support network to deal with the questions, doubts, guilt, and other thoughts. Memorials After the accident the team and town created a large memorial at the rink, and teams from across the Western Hockey League came to pay their respects along with family, friends and residents of Swift Current.Four Broncos memorial A memorial for the four killed in the accident was mounted on the back wall of the Swift Current Broncos arena, on the 20th anniversary, with photos of the deceased and hockey sweaters bearing the players numbers, encased in glass. During the game that would become known as the Punch-up in Piestany, a moment of silence was held for the players who were killed at the start of the second, and ultimately final, period. On the 30th anniversary of the crash, December 30, 2016, a memorial was unveiled near the site of the accident. The memorial is a two-metre granite structure in the shape of a four-leaf clover, with each player featured in one segment of the clover. The memorial is accessible travelling eastbound on Hwy 1, about four kilometres east of Swift Current, and when viewing the memorial, the raised overpass over the CP Rail Line can be clearly seen. In a move to memorialize the fallen players, the WHL awards the Four Broncos Memorial Trophy to the league's Player of the Year. In popular culture In 2013, Tri-Light Entertainment secured the rights to produce a feature film adaptation of the book Sudden Death: The Incredible Saga of the 1986 Swift Current Broncos. The book is written in collaboration of three individuals who are connected to the incident; defenseman Bob Wilkie, WHL Historian Gregg Drinnan, and witness to the crash Leesa Culp.  Reaction to other crashes  = Bathurst, N.B. Phantoms Basketball = After the crash, a survivor of the Swift Current crash, Joe Sakic, weighed in on how the crashes were similar and how the town would possibly overcome the accident. = Humboldt Broncos crash = Shortly after the 2018 crash involving the Humboldt Broncos, surviving members of the team flew to Saskatoon to meet with injured players and their families. Sheldon Kennedy offered his thoughts on the grieving process that all those involved should talk about the tragedy and the feelings that it invokes, as the collective trauma is far-reaching and residual.

Doc. 112-53 - THE \`\`AMERICAN JOBS ACT OF 2011 LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL and (H.R. 12) is the informal name for a pair of bills recommended by U.S. President Barack Obama in a nationally televised address to a joint session of Congress on September 8, 2011. He characterized the proposal as a collection of non-controversial measures designed to get Americans back to work, and he repeatedly urged Congress to pass it \\"right away\\"; he also said that the bills would not add to the national deficit and would be fully paid for. Background Since the start of the great recession, unemployment and underemployment levels in the U.S. have remained stubbornly high. Through the resulting \\"jobless recovery,\\" consumer confidence has remained shaky, raising the specter of a double dip recession. In August 2011, the U.S. Congress agreed on raising the debt ceiling and a reduction in deficits within the next decade. The acrimonious debate leading to the passage of this bill made clear that some in the United States Congress considered national default to be a viable political option. Following passage, Standard & Poor's downgraded the United States top credit rating from AAA to AA+ citing various factors including the long term political struggle to raise the debt ceiling and a lack of credible plans to reduce federal spending and increase tax revenue. Economic data released in July and August 2011 came in worse than expected, and worldwide stock markets tumbled quickly raising the fear of a new recession. After Labor Day, President Obama, in a major speech before a joint session of Congress, detailed a major new jobs package and urged the Congress to pass it without delay. President's address to Congress Obama's speech aired in the United States on 11 television networks during primetime, including ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, Fox Business Network, MSNBC, and CNBC. Nielsen Media Research estimate that 31.4 million viewers watched the speech, 10 million less than the 2011 State of the Union Address, but six million more than his March speech on Libya. The President's address was rescheduled to September 8 after his original request to deliver the speech on September 7 was rebuffed by Speaker of the House John Boehner, who cited a clash with a Republican Presidential debate already scheduled for the same time and stated that more time was required to secure the House for the President's visit. The President made his speech at 7:00pm Eastern, instead of the usual 9:00pm start for presidential addresses to joint sessions of Congress, so he would be finished before the first game of the National Football League season between the New Orleans Saints and the Green Bay Packers at 8:30pm.Alison Gendar and Thomas M.

Some of its elements include: # Cutting and suspending $245 billion worth of payroll taxes for qualifying employers and 160 million medium to low income employees. # Spending $62 billion for a Pathways Back to Work Program for expanding opportunities for low-income youth and adults. ## $49 billion - Extending unemployment benefits for up to 6 million long-term beneficiaries. ## $8 billion - Jobs tax credit for the long term unemployed. ## $5 billion - Pathways back to work fund. # Spending $50 billion on both new & pre-existing infrastructure projects. # Spending $35 billion in additional funding to protect the jobs of teachers, police officers, and firefighters # Spending $30 billion to modernize at least 35,000 public schools and community colleges. # Spending $15 billion on a program that would hire construction workers to help rehabilitate and refurbishing hundreds of thousands of foreclosed homes and businesses. # Creating the National Infrastructure Bank (capitalized with $10 billion), originally introduced in 2007, to help fund infrastructure via private and public capital. # Creating a nationwide, interoperable wireless network for public safety, while expanding accessibility to high-speed wireless services. # Prohibiting discrimination in hiring against persons who are unemployed because of their status as unemployed persons.. # Loosening regulations on small businesses that wish to raise capital, including through crowdfunding, while retaining investor protections. In total the legislation includes $253 billion in tax credits (56.6%) and $194 billion in spending and extension of unemployment benefits (43.4%). Legislative history American Jobs Act, S. 1549 In the Senate, the bill was stalled by Majority leader Harry Reid on September 27, 2011 who said On October 4, 2011, Minority Leader Mitch McConnell attempted to offer the Act as an amendment to the China trade bill, saying that while he disagreed with the bill's approach to job creation, it deserved to be voted on. On October 5, Reid announced a plan to pay for the American Jobs Act with a 5% surtax on incomes of more than $1 million a year. In the House of Representatives, as a matter of procedure; on September 12, 2011 The Speaker pro tempore laid before the House a message from the President transmitting the legislative proposal, referred to committee and ordered it to be printed (H. Doc. 112-53). Officially H.R. 12, was introduced on September 21, 2011, by Rep. John Larson, D-Conn. On October 11, the bill was voted on in the Senate where it failed to garner the necessary sixty votes to proceed. In response Obama vowed to break the bill into several smaller derivative bills. The first of these bills, was the Teachers and First Responders Back to Work Act of 2011, , which would have provided $30 billion in state aid to hire teachers and $5 billion for first responders. The bill was introduced by Senator Robert Menendez on October 17, 2011 and failed in a 50‚Äì50 vote for cloture on October 20, 2011. In the failed motion to proceed to consider the legislation, 50 Democrats voted in favor of opening debate on the legislation and 47 Republican Senators, joined by 3 Democratic Senators (Joseph Lieberman, Ben Nelson, and Mark Pryor) voted no. The $35 billion bill providing funding to state governments for public school teachers, police and firefighters would've been paid for with a 0.5% tax on incomes in excess of $1 million annually, beginning January 1, 2013. The second of these bills, was the Rebuild America Jobs Act, , a bill to put workers back on the job while rebuilding and modernizing America, would've spent $50 billion on transportation infrastructure projects and $10 billion to fund an \\"infrastructure bank.\\" The bill was introduced by Senator Amy Klobuchar on October 31, 2011 and failed in a 51‚Äì49 vote for cloture on November 3, 2011. In the failed motion to proceed to consider the legislation, 51 Democrats voted in favor of opening debate on the legislation and 47 Republicans Senators, joined by 1 Democratic Senator Ben Nelson and 1 Independent Senator Joseph Lieberman, voted no. The $60 billion bill investing in roads, bridges and infrastructure, would have been paid with a 0.7% tax on Americans earning more than $1 million per year. A third component was scheduled to receive a cloture vote in the US Senate on November 7, 2011. , a bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to repeal the imposition of 3 percent withholding on certain payments made to vendors by government entities, was an element of the larger American Jobs Act and passed the US House of Representatives on a bipartisan 405‚Äì16 vote. Senate Democrats planned to attach an amendment to to include an additional element of the American Jobs Act, which would give businesses incentives to hire unemployed and disabled veterans. The \\"Vow to Hire Heroes Act of 2011\\" would be funded by \\"existing funding mechanisms\\" from the Department of Veteran Affairs, including adjusting the fee structure for Veterans Affairs Department home loans, as opposed to the tax on Americans making more than $1 million a year, which was part of the prior Senate jobs bills. A prior nill version of the 3% withholding repeal by Senate Republicans had failed in the Senate on a 57-43 cloture vote, as Senate Democrats opposed the Senate Republicans plan to fund the lost tax revenue via $30 billion in spending cuts. In the failed cloture vote 47 Senate Republicans were joined by 10 Senate Democrats in voting to open debate on the Withholding Tax Relief Act of 2011, . Another element of the Act was passed on March 27, 2012 as part of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act. At issue was a White House proposal to \\"work with the SEC to conduct a comprehensive review of securities regulations from the perspective of these small companies to reduce the regulatory burdens on small business capital formation in ways that are consistent with investor protection, including expanding 'crowdfunding' opportunities and increasing mini- offerings.\\" The proposal had originated on January 31, 2011 as part of the President's Startup America initiative, and the JOBS Act included the requested provisions. The President signed the bill on April 5, 2012. =Related bills= On September 14, Republican Louie Gohmert introduced his own \\"American Jobs Act of 2011\\" into the House as . The bill would repeal the corporate income tax. Another related bill passed is the Surface and Air Transportation Programs Extension Act of 2011. President Barack Obama signed the Surface and Air Transportation Program Extension Act of 2011 on September 16, 2011 (Public Law No. 112-30). The law extends taxes which fund federal highway expenditures through March and the Federal Aviation Administration through January. Jobs for many construction workers were retained and created because of the extension of this act.http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h112-2887 Making the case Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack speaking on behalf of the American Jobs Act in Albuquerque, New Mexico, December 8, 2011 Obama toured the country making appearances at various speaking events to promote his legislative recommendation. He appeared before constituents of Eric Cantor's congressional district to press the Congress to pass his bill immediately. On September 12, he gave a speech in the White House Rose Garden in front of a group of teachers, police officers, construction workers and small-business owners in which he stated that In Speaker Boehner's home state of Ohio, Obama gave a speech described as \\"fiery\\" in a Columbus high school that led to the audience chanting: \\"Pass this bill!\\" In a campaign-style rally at North Carolina State University, Obama told college students At a black-tie dinner for the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute, Obama pitched his jobs plan to Latinos. In an October press conference, Obama responded to the suggestion from a reporter that his jobs tour was part of a political campaign, saying Reception =Republicans and conservatives= Republicans and conservative radio hosts were quick to label the American Jobs Act as \\"son of stimulus\\" after the controversial American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Martin Feldstein, a Harvard economist and Obama appointee to the Economic Recovery Advisory Board, put the price tag on the American Jobs Act at about $200,000 per job, which Republicans argue as the true cost of the legislation. Conservative commentator Brian Darling criticized the act, comparing it with the stimulus, and stated that since the act is based on the same ideas, it is unlikely to have a more positive outcome. Some Republican Members of Congress opposed the act for partisan reasons, with one telling the press anonymously, Republican Majority Leader Eric Cantor indicated that it would be a tough bill to pass quickly: House Speaker Boehner said the president's bill should be analyzed immediately by the Congressional Budget Office for scoring before the Administration and Congress pursue negotiations. Cantor confirmed to a reporter on October 3 that the bill as a complete package was effectively \\"dead\\" and that only parts of the American Jobs Act would be passed. With Obama stating a willingness to consider a piecemeal approach on the legislation, Cantor said, =Democrats= Many Democrats have balked at the bill, siding with the Republicans, especially those facing difficult re- elections in congressional districts where they are hesitant to support unpopular legislation. A majority of the Democrats support individual components of the bill, but are unwilling to commit to the bill in its entirety, despite the White House's disapproval of the weak showing of support. While some Democrats are opposed to the bill because it includes too many tax breaks, others oppose the extent of spending. This opposition from fellow Democrats has given Obama more responsibility to sell the plan first to the American public, as he has done on a very prominent, nationwide speaking tour. Both moderate and liberal Democrats have expressed concerns about the bill. Joe Manchin, a more conservative Democrat, has openly voiced his opposition to the Administration by arguing against the inclusion of too much spending, given by his remarks on September 29, On the other side, liberal Democrat Peter DeFazio argued against the inclusion of nearly $250 billion of tax breaks, saying References Category:Presidency of Barack Obama Category:Proposed legislation of the 112th United States Congress ","title":"American Jobs Act"},{"id":"33028214","text":"The Four Seasons are a set of four stone allegorical putti, each representing a traditional, temperate season. These are a part of the outdoor sculpture collection of the historic Oldfields estate, located on the campus of the Indianapolis Museum of Art (IMA), in Indianapolis, Indiana. Description The four sculptures are similar in size, color, and sculptural style. Each is carved from a single block of white stone. Each figure stands on a small, square base and is structurally supported by a carved tree stump. On the underside of each base is carved the word ‚ÄúITALY‚Äù. In their current placement the sculptures are elevated to eye level on matching tall, narrow, rectangular stone bases constructed in three pieces and held together via mortise and tenon. The sculptures differ in that each is shown with a traditional iconographic indicator of the depicted season. Spring, to which the IMA assigned accession number LH2001.238, is distinguished by the presence of flower blossoms. The putto stands with his left leg forward, supporting on his left hip a woven basket filled with blossoms. His right hand holds a cluster of large buds. The figure is clad in a cloth wrapped around his waist and rolled at the upper edge for support, and on his head he wears an anadem (wreath) of blossoms. Summer, accession number LH2001.236, is identified with wheat. This putto stands in a rather dynamic contrapposto, weight on his straightened left leg, swinging his laden arms out to his left side. With both hands he is holding a sheaf of harvested wheat. His head is turned slightly to his right. The figure is clad in a synthesis or draped cloth clasped over the left shoulder and belted around the waist, and he wears a thin cloth headband around his curls that is knotted in back. Autumn, accession number LH2001.239, shows the fruits of the season and a goblet. The putto stands in a slight contrapposto, weight on his proper right leg, and his head turned to his left. His arms reach out in front of his belly. In his proper right hand he holds a goblet, and his left hand holds a cluster of grapes. He is clad in a robe tied over the right shoulder and twisted along the upper edge across the chest. It is belted around the waist. He wears a wreath of grapevine in his curls. Behind him, to the proper right of the tree stump, is a basket of fruit. Winter, accession number LH2001.237, bears no produce. In this sculpture a putto stands with his weight on his straightened left leg and his right leg bent and crossed in front of the left, the ball of the right foot resting on a rock. His upper body leans right and his arms are crossed, right over left. The right hand grasps the left upper arm, and the left hand clutches the two ends of a cloth wrapped around the boy from waist to knee. The figure looks to his left. Unlike the other sculptures in this set, LH2001.237‚Äôs curly locks are unadorned. Context The Four Seasons are an ancient decorative motif. Usually each season is represented as an allegorical figure bearing traditional iconographic symbols. The Romans typically represented the seasons as voluptuous goddesses known as the Horae. This imagery carried over into neoclassical art and later became especially popular as garden sculpture. Putti (re-popularized in the Renaissance) became common allegorical figures and often took over the role of the Horae, as here. This change in preference may have occurred because putti are more innocuous than the sexualized goddesses of antiquity. =Iconography= Spring is shown with profuse flowers because it is the season when most flowering plants blossom. Summer holds a sheaf of wheat and wears a cloth headband to illustrate the labor and product of the wheat harvest, which is done in the summer. Wheat can either be planted in the winter (\\"winter wheat\\") or the spring (\\"spring wheat\\"), to be harvested at the beginning or very end of summer, respectively. Autumn is the season in which most fruits become ripe. Since grapes are harvested in the fall, wine is also made in the fall. This is alluded to by the goblet. Winter is shown without produce and striving to warm himself because the temperate winter is cold and rather barren. Historical information The grounds of Oldfields were landscaped by Percival Gallagher of the Olmsted Brothers in the 1920s. The property and all sculptures on it were donated to the IMA by the family of former Oldfields owner Josiah K. Lilly Jr., in 1967. In 2001 the outdoor sculptures were assessed, and eighteen selected pieces were accessioned into the IMA‚Äôs Lilly House collection. The Seasons were among these and were assigned the accession numbers listed above in the description. =Provenance= The ‚ÄúItaly‚Äù carving on the underside of each sculpture suggests that these were produced in Italy for export. Nothing is known of the maker of this set. =Acquisition= It is not known with certainty when this sculpture set was first brought to the Oldfields estate, but it is documented in historic photographs from the Landon era. =Location history= The Four Seasons Garden was designed in 1939 by Haldeman & Leland to complement the Recreation Building, which was added to the property in 1940 by the Lilly family. The Seasons putti are believed to date to the Landon era and were incorporated into the new garden design. In 2006 all four sculptures and their pedestals were removed from view for conservation work, and then replaced. For the 2010 Four Seasons Garden renovations the sculptures were removed to Newfield (the house J.K. Lilly Jr., built as a home by for his son) for storage.Brooks, Bradley. Oldfields. Indianapolis: Indianapolis Museum of Art, 2004. They were reinstalled upon completion of the renovation in April, 2011, but are not in the original positions. LH2001.238 and LH2001.239 have been exchanged accidentally. Condition The sculptures are monitored, cleaned, and treated regularly by the IMA art conservation staff. All sculptures are considered structurally sound and stable as of 2011.Indianapolis Museum of Art. 2011 Conservation Condition and Treatment Reports for LH2001.236, LH2001.237, LH2001.238, and LH2001.239.

An associate of the Philadelphia crime family, Palermo also ran Philadelphia's biggest numbers racket. Palermo's partner was Mafioso Frankie Carbo, a soldier in New York's Lucchese family who had been a gunman with Murder, Inc. Palermo's fighters In addition to Billy Fox, the professional fighters that Palermo owned outright or under the table included World Welterweight champion Virgil Akins, number three-ranked heavyweight contender Clarence Henry, World Welterweight Champion Johnny Saxton, heavyweight contender Coley Wallace, and Lightweight Champion Ike Williams. Palermo would cheat members of his stable out of their share of the purses of their fights. =Billy Fox= Known as \\"Blackjack\\", Fox started off his career in a fashion reminiscent of the rise of heavyweight champ Primo Carnera (owned by mobster Owney Madden) and of future welterweight champ Johnny Saxton (whose contract was owned by Palermo) by winning 36 consecutive fights, all by knockout, before he was knocked out by Gus Lesnevich for the world light heavyweight title. He would rack up seven more wins, including a win in a notorious bout allegedly thrown by Jake LaMotta.Jeff Merron, ESPN.com. Page 2 - \\"Reel Life: 'Raging Bull'\\" Accessed 7 January 2008. The LaMotta fight was fixed by Palermo, who owned Fox under the table. Many boxing aficionados did not consider Fox a fighter talented enough to have obtained his lofty ranking without the help of Palermo. After the LaMotta debacle, which was immortalized in Martin Scorsese's movie Raging Bull, Fox lost to Red Willis Applegate and Gus Lesnevich, to whom he lost in the first round by a knockout in 1:58 seconds. =Ike Williams= Ike Williams, the world's lightweight boxing champion from 1945 to 1951, was managed by Palermo for part of his career. According to Williams, he was blackballed by the boxing managers guild when he sought to manage himself. Palermo informed him he could resolve his problems with the guild, and Williams agreed to let Palermo manage him. In 1960, Williams testified before the Kefauver Commission investigating Mob control of boxing. Williams told the commission that he was broke and working for $46 per week despite having won $1 million in purses. He claimed Palermo refused to pay him his share of the purses from two fights worth approximately $40,000, on which he had to pay taxes. He said he had never tried to collect the monies owed him by Palermo. According to Sports Illustrated: > He is a circumspect fellow and clearly to this day has no wish to anger > Blinky. Thus, though he told how Blinky brought him offer after offer to > throw fights for bribes as big as $100,000, he insisted that Blinky advised > him to turn the offers down. It was a fatherly picture but it did seem out > of character. Williams did claim to have taken a dive against Chuck Davey, a much hyped contender for the welterweight crown. =Clarence Henry= On June 4, 1954, Los Angeles-based heavyweight boxer Clarence Henry, who was managed by Palermo, was arrested in New York City for attempting to bribe Oakland, California middleweight Bobby Jones to throw his June 11 Madison Square Garden match with Joey Giardello. Henry allegedly offered $15,000 (equivalent to approximately $ in today's funds) to Jones to throw the fight. Once the third- ranked heavyweight contender, Henry was released after posting $2,000 bail and subsequently retired from the ring. Giardello beat Jones in a close decision. A future middleweight champion, Giardello was blocked from a shot at the title by Palermo and the underworld figures who controlled the sport in the 1950s and early '60s. Giardello finally won the title in 1963, after Palermo and Carbo had been jailed. =Johnny Saxton= Johnny Saxton was a promising amateur fighter who won 31 of his 33 amateur bouts. He was twice a National AAU champion and won a Golden Gloves title. When he turned professional in 1949, he was managed by Bill ‚ÄúPop‚Äù Miller, but Miller sold his contract to Palermo for $10,000. In his first 40 pro fight, he racked up a record of 39 wins and one draw. Palermo had once manipulated Billy Fox to a similar record early in his career to make him a contender. Some of Saxton's opponents in the ring in his journeyman days put in such pitiful performances, they angered not only the crowd but ring officials. Saxton became an unpopular fighter. Saxton lost his first pro bout to Gil Turner in 1953, dropped a decision to Del Flanagan and drew against Johnny Lombardo. After beating Joey Giardello and Johnny Bratton, he met world welterweight champion Kid Gavil√°n (often spelled Kid Gavilan) in 1954 in a title bout and defeated him in a fifteen-round decision. That fight was widely thought to be fixed. Bookies reportedly had refused to take wagers on the fight. Gavilan‚Äîno stranger to fixed fights‚Äîcried and said that he had been given ‚Äúthe business.‚Äù Twenty of 22 ringside reporters believed Gavilan won the fight. In a 2002 interview with The Observer, was one of the ringside observers. > \\"...Frankie Carbo, the mob's unofficial commissioner for boxing, controlled > a lot of the welters and middles.... Not every fight was fixed, of course, > but from time to time Carbo and his lieutenants, like Blinky Palermo in > Philadelphia, would put the fix in. When the Kid Gavilan-Johnny Saxton fight > was won by Saxton on a decision in Philadelphia in 1954, I was covering it > for Sports Illustrated and wrote a piece at that time saying boxing was a > dirty business and must be cleaned up now. It was an open secret. All the > press knew that one - and other fights - were fixed. Gavilan was a mob- > controlled fighter, too, and when he fought Billy Graham it was clear Graham > had been robbed of the title. The decision would be bought. If it was close, > the judges would shade it the way they had been told.\\" Saxton lost his title the following year via technical knockout to Tony DeMarco, then won it back in 1956 with an upset win over Carmen Basilio, another fight that was thought to be fixed. Basilio said of losing his title to the referees' decision, ‚ÄúIt was like being robbed in a dark alley.‚Äù He lost the title again in a rematch with Basilio later in the year. His wins against Gavilan and Basilio were both controversial and unpopular with many in the boxing world. He retired in 1958. Unlike other boxers exploited by Palermo, Saxton expressed loyalty to him. A statement issued in 1955 declared: > \\"Since my first professional fight in 1949 Frank Palermo has been my > manager, friend, and adviser. He has been honest and trustworthy in every > dealing we have had during my career. I now hold the welterweight > championship of the world. I am going along with Palermo.\\" After having his property seized by the IRS, Saxton wound up penniless. While being treated at a state mental hospital after being arrested for robbery in his retirement, he said, \\"I was supposed to have got big money from fighting on TV, but I never saw it. No one ever gave me more than a couple of hundred dollars at a time.\\" Sonny Liston By 1959, Blinky and his partner, Mafioso Frankie Carbo, owned a majority interest in the contract of heavyweight boxer Sonny Liston, who went on to win the World Heavyweight Championship in 1962. From the start of his pro career in 1953, Liston had been \\"owned\\" by St. Louis mobster John Vitale, who continued to own a stake in the boxer. At the time Palermo and Carbo acquired their interest in Liston, the notorious Carbo was imprisoned on Rikers Island, having been convicted of the undercover management of prize-fighters and unlicensed matchmaking. According to both FBI and newspaper reports, Vitale and other mobsters \\"reportedly controlled Liston's contract\\",Associated Press. \\"Probers Search for Underworld Ties with Boxers, undated newspaper clipping. FBI file\\" Retrieved July 18, 2011. with Vitale owning approximately twelve percent.Picou, Tommy. \\"The Sonny Liston Story: He Always Had Cop Trouble.\\" Chicago Daily Defender, September 11, 1962, pp. 22 Liston fought 12 fights under the control of Carbo and Palermo. Senate investigation In 1960, Palermo and Carbo, who had just been released from jail after serving time for managing boxers without a license, were subpoenaed to appear before Senator Estes Kefauver's investigation committee into Mob control of boxing. Palermo pleaded the Fifth Amendment to avoid testifying, as did Carbo, who took the Fifth 25 times. Kefauver recommended that Palermo and Carbo be cited for Contempt of Congress. Imprisonment The following year, Palermo and Carbo and Palermo, along with Los Angeles mobsters Joe Di Sica and Louis Dragna, were charged with conspiracy and extortion against National Boxing Association Welterweight Champion Don Jordan. After a three-month trial, in which U.S. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy served as prosecutor, Carbo and Palermo were sentenced to 25 yearsA Report on Chicago crime.

Florida Oceanographic Coastal Center Florida Oceanographic Coastal Center is a 57-acre (23 ha) marine life nature center located on Hutchinson Island in Stuart, Florida, situated between the Indian River and the Atlantic Ocean. Florida Oceanographic Coastal Center offers educational programs and conducts research and restoration programs that lead to healthy coastal ecosystems.  Research  The Florida Oceanographic Society conducts research, monitoring and habitat restoration in South Florida, particularly in the southern portion of the Indian River Lagoon. The Indian River Lagoon is home to more than 4,300 species of plants and animals, including 36 rare and endangered species. Research programs include the Florida Oceanographic Oyster Restoration program (FLOOR). Found mainly in estuaries, oyster reefs are compromised by human settlement, including development and boating activity. In South Florida, oyster reefs face an additional threat. Discharges from Lake Okeechobee have diluted the salinity levels in estuaries, threatening the survival of oyster reefs. FLOOR began in 2005 with local citizens volunteering through Florida Oceanographic Society to grow oysters off their private docks. The group grew to over 100 volunteers actively cultivating oysters, and in November 2009, Dr. Vincent Encomio, Research Scientist at Florida Oceanographic, and a team of volunteers began the Oyster Shell Recycling Program.Scientist honored for oyster bed work, TCPalm October 21, 2010 Shells are acquired from local restaurants, quarantined for a minimum of three months, during which time they are composted and free of any potential living contaminant, and packaged in mesh bags for reef building. Currently, the retail establishments Conchy Joe's, New England Seafood, Shucker's, Finz, and Shrimpers actively collect oyster shells, which are picked up weekly by Florida Oceanographic volunteers. Once the shells are prepared for reef building, large groups of volunteers bring the shells by boat to areas deemed suitable for reef building projects. The Indian River Lagoon east of the Roosevelt Bridge is home to several man-made reefs established by Florida Oceanographic. Discharges from the lake are considered prior to reef placement.  Education  Florida Oceanographic Society educates thousands of students from a four-county area (Palm Beach, Martin, St. Lucie, and Okeechobee counties) with on-site programs, outreach curriculum, and on-line activities. The Coastal Center provides a natural learning environment for public and private groups. Centered around marine life and coastal ecosystems, the Coastal Center builds on the skills that promote interpretation, understanding, and conservation of our resources. With easy access to both the Indian River Lagoon and the St. Lucie River, students quickly become aware of local issues and the need to become advocates for environmental stewardship.

He had a significant artistic association with the composer Sir Lennox Berkeley. Biography Horsley was born in Whanganui, New Zealand in 1920. From 1936 he studied at the Royal College of Music in London. There he studied with Herbert Fryer, Angus Morrison, Tobias Matthay and Irene Scharrer. His solo debut was in Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 3. In 1946 he premiered Humphrey Searle's Piano Concerto No. 1, Op. 5. =Work with Lennox Berkeley= In 1948 Horsley gave the first performance of Lennox Berkeley's Piano Concerto, and he gave the first performances of some of Berkeley's piano works. He also commissioned a Trio for Horn, Violin and Piano from Berkeley, and premiered it in March 1953 at the Victoria and Albert Museum, with Dennis Brain and Manoug Parikian. Berkeley's Piano Sonata, Op. 20, was written for and premiered by Clifford Curzon, but Colin Horsley gave many subsequent performances, and recorded the work in 1959, in close collaboration with the composer. Berkeley dedicated the Concert Study in E‚Äëflat to Horsley, who also commissioned a Scherzo as an encore piece to be played after the Six Preludes. He performed the complete cycle of Beethoven violin sonatas with Max Rostal. He worked with Dennis Brain in playing and recording horn trios by Berkeley and Brahms. He premiered Nikolai Medtner's Piano Quintet when the composer was unable to perform it personally, due to illness. After Medtner's death, his widow Anna asked Horsley to play the composer's Third Piano Concerto at a memorial concert on 5 April 1952 in the Royal Festival Hall, conducted by Anatole Fistoulari. After a touring career, Horsley taught at the Royal Manchester College of Music 1964-80, and at the RCM in London 1955-90. Horsley was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 1963 Queen's Birthday Honours. In retirement he lived on the Isle of Man, close to where his grandfather was born. He was the Patron of the Isle of Man Symphony Orchestra. He died on 28 July 2012, aged 92. Recordings His currently available recordings include the Berkeley Horn Trio and Mozart works with the Dennis Brain Wind Ensemble; the Mozart Piano Concerto No. 14; the Piano Concerto in E-flat major by John Ireland; and with the violinist Max Rostal there are works by Debussy, Delius, Elgar, Schubert, Schumann, Stravinsky and Walton.

The genus Lardoglyphus was erected by Anthonie Cornelis Oudemans in 1927. The species is known to be a pest to institutional and private dermestid beetle colonies. Lardoglyphus zacheri has been less studied than its congener L. konoi, which is occasionally called the \\"fish mite\\" and has been known to threaten supplies of cured fish. As a food supply threat the latter species is therefore more of a concern. However, much can be inferred about L. zacheri by studying L. konoi, the latter of which is known to thrive in humid environments. Thus Lardoglyphus species can be expected to become pests in many tropical and subtropical situations, especially where ambient conditions are humid. Some researchers have asserted that devastating L. zacheri infestations can occur in any climate when their target is a dermestid beetle colony. The high humidity levels produced in the often enclosed colonies are the likely cause of such infestations, even when said colonies are located in relatively dry climates. Scientists believe that cured fish infestations of L. zacheri are initiated by dermestid (carrion) beetles that carry hypopi to the fish source in the first place. For this reason, researchers interested in studying L. zacheri concomitantly study the Dermestes maculatus carrion beetle.

It is a wholly owned subsidiary of Siemens Gamesa. Previously the company designed, assembled, and installed 5-Megawatt wind turbines for offshore wind farms. It also designed and manufactured rotor blades through its subsidiary Adwen Blades GmbH, headquartered in Stade, Germany.  History  Adwen was established as Multibrid GmbH by Pfleiderer Wind Energy GmbH in 2000, after acquiring Multibrid turbine technology from aerodyn Energiesysteme. In 2003, Multibrid was bought by Prokon Nord Energiesysteme GmbH. In 2007, Multibrid opened a wind turbine assembly plant in Bremerhaven. At the same year, Prokon Nord established a blade manufacturer PN Rotor GmbH. The French nuclear corporation Areva invested in Multibrid in 2007, buying 51% of the company's shares for ‚Ç¨150 million. In 2009, Areva acquired PN Rotor, which became Areva Blades. Areva bought the remaining 49% of shares of Multibrid in 2010. Correspondingly, the company was renamed Areva Wind GmbH. The first prototype was installed in 2004. Three additional onshore turbines were installed in 2008 in order to develop expertise with tripods, large hub heights, erection, lifting equipment, logistics and serial manufacturing. In 2009, Multibrid installed six wind turbines at the Alpha Ventus Offshore Wind Farm. In 2009, Areva Wind was selected as a turbine supplier for the Global Tech 1 offshore wind farm, in 2010 for the Borkum West II offshore wind farm and in 2012 for the Wikinger offshore wind farm. In 2014, Areva and Gamesa Corporaci√≥n Tecnol√≥gica started negotiations to create a joint venture for the offshore wind energy. The equally owned joint venture named Adwen was formed in 2015 and it was created on the basis of Areva Wind, including Areva's M5000-135 turbine and 8 MW turbine platform under development. Gamesa contributed its G132-5.0 MW Offshore turbine technology. In 2017, Areva sold its stake in Adwen to Gamesa, after the merger of Gamesa and Siemens Wind Power was announced. In 2017, Siemens Gamesa announced a restructuring plan for Adwen, to be completed by September 2020. Manufacturing of wind turbines by Adwen was discontinued and Adwen focused on servicing installed turbines. Plants in Bremen and Emden would be closed and the number of employees in Germany would be reduced from 480 to 211.  Operations  Adwen had plants in Bremerhaven, Bremen and Emden in Germany, and it planned to build manufacturing or assembling plants in other markets, particularly in Le Havre in France. However, due to restructuring the only plant which would remain is the plant in Bremerhaven, which would support the offshore services. Adwen provided two different 5 MW offshore turbines: AD 5-135 (formerly Areva M5000-135) for the Wikinger Project and AD 5-116 for the North Sea Projects GlobalTech One, Borkum West II and Alpha Ventus. In addition, it has developed 8 MW AD 8-180 turbine prototype, which has the world largest wind turbine gearbox, developed jointly with the wind energy engineering company Winergy. Due to the restructuring, the Adwen's AD 8-180 project was discontinued and Siemens Gamesa replaced it with its SWT 8MW turbine model. Adwen has provided wind turbines for Alpha Ventus (6 x 5 MW), Trianel (former Borkum West II, 40 x 5 MW), Global Tech I (80 x 5 MW), and Wikinger (80 x 5 MW) offshore wind farms, all located in the German waters.

The event was described as \\"Australia's most dramatic hostage chase\\" with \\"scenes likened to a Hollywood action film.\\" Perpetrator Turkish born 35-year-old Hakki Bahadir Atahan was unemployed at the time of his armed robbery spree and had carried out around 16 or 17 bank robberies between March 1983 and January 1984. Atahan lived an expensive lifestyle renting a luxurious penthouse apartment in Manly, owned several expensive cars and robbed up to three banks a day, amassing over A$150,000 in a year. Events On the morning of 31 January 1984, Atahan had successfully robbed two or three banks before entering the Commonwealth Bank in George Street, Sydney. Due to the earlier robberies, police were on high alert and quickly responded to the Commonwealth Bank robbery with dozens of heavily armed tactical police from both the Tactical Response Group (TRG) and the Special Weapons & Operations Section (SWOS), forming a perimeter. During negotiations, Atahan fired at least two shots from a pistol and released all the bank's customers. Some time later, Atatan released four female bank staff whilst keeping five male staff as hostages. Some two-and-a-half hours later, Atahan ended negotiations and emerged from the bank encircled by the five hostages, each of whom were forced to place a hand atop of the robber's head. This tactic caused confusion and prevented police marksmen from obtaining a clear view and thus depriving them of the opportunity to shoot him. Atahan forced the five hostages into a nearby Datsun sedan which had its keys left in it. He then forced a hostage to drive off through police roadblocks, which began a pursuit that lasted several hours and involved 39 police cars, a police helicopter, and four Water Police launches. After two hours of driving around, Atahan released a hostage and collected his 23-year-old girlfriend Sharon Oliver. Upon reaching the Spit Bridge, police raised the bridge, preventing Atahan from travelling any further. Detectives from the Special Weapons & Operations Section (SWOS) approached the vehicle, ordering Atahan to surrender. Atahan fired his .32 ACP pistol at point-blank range at Detective Senior Constable Steve Canelis, striking him just above his nose. Detective Senior Constable Donald Packer fired one shot at Atahan through a side window while Detective Sergent John Nagle shot a round through the back window. Atahan was hit in the head and chest and died. Detective Senior Constable Canelis survived his gunshot wound and returned to work four months later and retired a number of years after with the bullet still lodged in his shoulder.

Behn dedicated the play, originally performed at the Duke's Company in London, to the well-known actress and mistress of King Charles II, Nell Gwyn. Historical Context Set in Rome, The Feign‚Äôd Curtizans was written and performed after the advent of the Popish Plot. The play is sympathetic to Catholicism during a time when declaring one's Protestant beliefs was ‚Äúpolitically expedient‚Äù. Behn uses the English characters of Sir Signall Buffoon and Mr. Tickletext to satirize their nationalism and fear of Italian ‚ÄúPopery,‚Äù while portraying several Italian characters of quality as honorable and virtuous.

Marcella has been promised to Octavio for marriage, but has fallen in love with Sir Henry Fillamour. Cornelia is bound for the convent. They have run away to Rome together, posing as courtesans named Euphemia and Silvianetta, so that they may be free to control their own futures. When Fillamour and Galliard arrive in Rome, they notice the beautiful Marcella and Cornelia disguised as the courtesans Euphemia and Silvianetta. Galliard is taken by Silvianetta's beauty, and Fillamour is struck by Euphemia's resemblance to Marcella. He becomes conflicted, desiring to stay constant in his love for Marcella, but unable to resist Euphemia. Meanwhile, Laura Lucretia, the sister of Octavio (Marcella's betrothed), has fallen in love with Galliard. Knowing that he favors the courtesan named Silvianetta, Laura Lucretia disguises herself as Cornelia's alter ego so as to secure Galliard's affections. Having learned of Marcella's adoration for Fillamour, Octavio pledges revenge against him. To keep Fillamour safe, Marcella disguises herself as a pageboy and attempts to divert him from going to meet Euphemia at a place where Octavio and his men are lying in wait. In a comedic scene, Fillamour, Galliard, Signall, and Tickletext all stumble about in the dark trying to reach Silvianetta and Euphemia, but instead find themselves in a battle with Octavio and his supporters. During the same night, Laura Lucretia, dressed as Silvianetta, receives an oath of marriage from a man she believes to be Galliard, but is actually Julio. Once in the daylight, all parties confront each other and identities are revealed. Fillamour professes his love for Marcella, who agrees to marry him after Octavio renounces his claim. Galliard and Cornelia also become engaged. Julio, who had made an oath of marriage to ‚ÄúSilvianetta,‚Äù discovers he has actually sworn himself to his already bride-to-be, Laura Lucretia.

The rock and sand portion of the company was purchased by Dillingham Construction in the early 1970s. It was acquired by Syar Industries in 1986, and as of 2018 remains in operation as Syar's Napa Quarry. In 2013 Syar announced that it was applying for permits to double the output of the quarry from 1 million to 2 million tons of aggregate.

The Investigation Committee issued an interim report in December 2011, and issued its final report in July 2012. Investigation  =The Committee= The Investigation Committee on the Accident at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Stations (ICANPS) was tasked with: \\"conducting an investigation to determine the causes of the accident that occurred at Fukushima Daiichi and Daini Nuclear Power Stations of Tokyo Electric Power Company, and those of the damages generated by the accident, and thereby making policy proposals designed to prevent the expansion of the damages and the recurrence of similar accidents in the future\\".

Its report was the fourth investigation into the crisis after the earlier release of a parliamentary study, a private report by journalists and academics as well as an investigation by TEPCO. =Interim investigation report= For the interim report issued on December 26, 2011, the committee interviewed 456 people over a total of 900 hours of hearings by Dec. 16, 2011. The interim report was \\"a scathing assessment of the response to the Fukushima disaster\\", in which the investigative panel \\"blamed the central government and the Tokyo Electric Power Co., saying both seemed incapable of making decisions to stem radiation leaks as the situation at the coastal plant worsened in the days and weeks after the disaster\\". It attaches blame to Japan's central government as well as Tokyo Electric Power Co., \\"depicting a scene of harried officials incapable of making decisions to stem radiation leaks as the situation at the coastal plant worsened in the days and weeks following the disaster\\". The 507-page interim report, said Japan's response to the crisis at Fukushima Daiichi was flawed by \\"poor communication and delays in releasing data on dangerous radiation leaks at the facility\\", and poor planning also worsened the disaster response, noting that authorities had \\"grossly underestimated tsunami risks\\" that followed the magnitude 9.0 earthquake. The 15m (40-foot) high tsunami that struck the plant was twice as tall as the highest wave predicted by officials, and the erroneous assumption that the plant's cooling system continued to work after the tsunami struck worsened the disaster. \\"Plant workers had no clear instructions on how to respond to such a disaster, causing miscommunication, especially when the disaster destroyed backup generators. Ultimately, the series of failures led to the worst nuclear catastrophe since Chernobyl\\". The report concluded ‚ÄúIt's inexcusable that a nuclear accident couldn't be managed because a major event such as the tsunami exceeded expectations.‚Äù\\"Fukushima Probe Puts Regulator, Cellphones on List of Failures\\" , Bloomberg Businessweek, December 27, 2011. Retrieved 2011-12-26. An account said \\"[t]he report, which is highly critical of Tepco as well as the authorities contrasts with the conclusions of a separate exercise by Tepco, which laid blame for the crisis squarely on the natural disaster.\\"Nakamoto, Michiyo, \\"Report scathing of response to Fukushima nuclear crisis\\", Financial Times, December 26, 2011. Retrieved 2011-12-26. NISA, Japan's nuclear regulatory agency, received \\"some of [the] strongest criticism\\" in the report. =Final investigation report= The panel said the government and TEPCO failed to prevent the disaster not because a large tsunami was unanticipated, but because they were reluctant to invest time, effort and money in protecting against a natural disaster considered unlikely. \\"The utility and regulatory bodies were overly confident that events beyond the scope of their assumptions would not occur . . . and were not aware that measures to avoid the worst situation were actually full of holes,\\" the government panel said in its final report. TEPCO had even weighed in on a report about earthquake risk and asked the government to play down the likelihood of a tsunami in the region, the report said. The panel's report faulted an inadequate legal system for nuclear crisis management, a crisis- command disarray caused by the government and Tepco, and possible excess meddling on the part of the prime minister's office in the early stage of the crisis. The panel concluded that a culture of complacency about nuclear safety and poor crisis management led to the nuclear disaster. The report stated that measures taken by TEPCO and the Japanese nuclear regulator to prepare the Fukushima nuclear plant for earthquakes and tsunamies were \\"insufficient\\" and their response to the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster was \\"inadequate.\\" \\"Preparedness for a large-scale complex disaster was insufficient; and they were unprepared for the release of a large amount of radioactive materials into the environment caused by a containment failure,\\" noted the report with respect to TEPCO and the Japanese Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency. It noted for example that Fukushima staff was poorly trained to deal with the crisis after the plant's reactors went into meltdown. TEPCO did not adequately train employees \\"to think independently and to act, and lacked flexible and proactive thinking required for crisis response\\", the report said. Tepco was criticized by the panel for failing to give most workers dosimeters that would have kept track of their exposure to harmful radiation as they fought to contain meltdowns in the early days of the crisis. While Tepco had access to hundreds of dosimeters sent from other nuclear power plants across Japan, managers of the company failed to put them to use ‚Äî a sign that the company paid little heed to worker safety, the report said. Because of poor communication among Fukushima officials, the police and Japanese Self-Defense Forces personnel, the evacuation of Futaba hospital and its nearby health care facility for the elderly, located just 5 km from the damaged plant, was delayed. Residents living around the Fukushima plant may also have been able to keep exposure to minimum if the government had effectively used a computer system to predict the spread of radioactive materials, even though data on the damaged reactors were not available. Besides a failure of disaster management and risk analysis, TEPCO lacks ‚Äúsufficient enthusiasm to fully investigate the Fukushima disaster and learn lessons to prevent recurrence even more than one year after the accident,‚Äù the report said. The investigators of the panel said TEPCO has to address problems within its own culture that contributed to its failings in the crisis, including employees ‚Äúnot fully trained to think for themselves.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe still don‚Äôt perceive much enthusiasm in the accident investigation from‚Äù the company, the report said. ‚ÄúTEPCO must take our findings sincerely and resolve the problems to achieve a higher level of safety culture across the company.‚Äù The ICANPS report also said interference by then Japan prime minister Naoto Kan at the time of the disaster created confusion in the response to the crisis. \\"It must be said that more harm was done (than good) as his involvement ... could have confused the scene, potentially missing opportunities to make important judgments and creating opportunities for misjudgments,\\" the report said. Kan's office was criticized by the ICANPS panel for controlling information, delaying crucial announcements to the public and overly softening expressions about the severity of the accident, causing confusion, threats to health and public distrust in the government. Japanese officials ignored the risks of an atomic accident because they believed in the 'myth of nuclear safety'., i.e. the notion that severe accidents don't happen at nuclear power plants in Japan. \\"The fundamental problem lies in the fact that utilities, including Tokyo Electric Power (TEPCO), and the government failed to see the danger as reality,\\" the report said. It also said that they were under the 'notion that severe accidents do not happen at nuclear plants in our country'. \\"Because the government and the power utilities, including Tepco, were biased by the safety myth, thinking they would never ever face such a serious accident, they were unable to realize that such a crisis could occur in reality. This appears to be the fundamental problem,\\" the panel said in its final report. Tepco thus failed to prepare adequate tsunami defenses or crisis management procedures to deal with a station blackout, the panel's report said. \\"The Fukushima crisis occurred because people didn't take the impact of natural disasters so seriously,\\" University of Tokyo engineering professor Yotaro Hatamura, who chaired the commission, told a news conference. \\"Even though there were new findings (about the risk of a tsunami), Tepco couldn't see it because people are blind to what they don't want to see.\\" Nuclear regulators did not pay sufficient attention to improvements in nuclear safety standards as recommended by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the Japanese Nuclear Industrial and Safety Agency had been promoting nuclear energy without being open about the inherent risks. According to the report, the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency strongly opposed a plan in 2006 to enhance preparedness against a nuclear disaster, fearing such a move would raise concerns about the safety of nuclear power among residents living near atomic plants. The failure of the central and local governments to consider the possibility of a nuclear accident caused by multiple factors such as earthquakes and tsunami also caused a delay in responding to the accident. According to the report there was an insufficient crisis management structure for ensuring the safety of local communities. The Japanese government failed to give a detailed announcement about what was happening and how it might affect people living nearby, while the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency was reluctant to inform the media that reactor 1's fuel rods possibly melted, although it knew that was quite likely. The panel suggested that post- Fukushima safety steps taken at nuclear power plants across the country have not been enough to cope with a complex catastrophe. \\"We understand that immediate safety measures are being further detailed and will materialise in the future. But we strongly urge the people concerned to make continued efforts to take really effective steps,\\" said the panel, chaired by University of Tokyo engineering professor Yotaro Hatamura. \\"Both the government and companies should establish a new philosophy of disaster prevention that requires safety and disaster measures against any massive accident and disaster... regardless of event probability,\\" the report said. The report criticized TEPCO's argument that the nuclear accident was due to a tsunami of an unimaginable, unpredictable scale. It stated, \\"The reason the accident was beyond assumptions was because no attempt was made to make assumptions due to a safety myth that had no basis in fact.\\" The ICANPS panel said that there was no proof that the earthquake was a key factor in the disaster, but added that a certain degree of impact could not be ruled out. Many scientists and activists have disputed the Japanese government and TEPCO's findings that the plant's cooling systems were knocked out by giant waves that slammed into the plant, suggesting it was the initial earthquake that damaged the reactors. TEPCO's own investigation put the blame for the accident solely on the tsunami. The panel, however, called on TEPCO to review data that had been presented to it, saying that it believed that it contained errors. It also said TEPCO covered up unfavourable data in a computer analysis attempting to measure the extent of damage inside the reactors. Commission chairman Yotaro Hatamura said that due to time restrictions, his panel was unable to address the concerns of residents, and the international community, who questioned whether the damaged reactors and the pool of used nuclear fuel at Fukushima's No.4 reactor could withstand another earthquake. \\"I now understand what people are worried the most about is the vulnerability of the No.4 spent fuel pool. I wish we had started an investigation on it much earlier,\\" Hatamura said. Based on the lessons learned from the accident, the panel proposed the government and utilities take safety steps regardless of the probability of tsunami and other events that could have a potentially strong impact, and review disaster reduction measures when important new findings are revealed. The final report included seven recommendations for preventing a recurrence of the Fukushima nuclear accident, such as safety measures and ways to prevent the spreading of damage. The panel didn't recommend charges against any of those involved in the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, but the panel called on the government to take immediate action on certain issues, such as ensuring off-site nuclear accident management centres are protected against the kind of massive radiation leaks that rendered the one at Fukushima unusable. It recommended that all nuclear operators in Japan conduct a comprehensive risk analysis of their facilities and urged the Japanese government and TEPCO to conduct further investigations to fully disclose the cause of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, because there are many unresolved issues, such as the process by which radioactive materials leaked out of the Fukushima No. 1 plant. ‚ÄúThe government shouldn‚Äôt close its accident investigation into Fukushima with the end of probes by our committee and the parliamentary commission,‚Äù Hatamura‚Äôs panel reported. ‚ÄúWhen radiation levels fall, detailed on-site examination inside reactor buildings, including examination of quake effects, must be carried out.‚Äù =Fukushima Nuclear Accident Independent Investigation Commission= On July 5, 2012, the National Diet of Japan Fukushima Nuclear Accident Independent Investigation Commission released an executive summary report of The Fukushima Nuclear Accident.

Overview Gothic wooden sculptures at the southern portal.alt= The Romanesque window found in its south facade is the best evidence that the church must have been built as early as the 13th century as is also the semicircular ground-plan of St. Mary's chapel (later altered). In the second half of the 14th century, the church was radically reconstructed. It was then turned into a late Gothic church of the three-nave type. Massive round columns support heavy ribbed vaults cut in stone and an air of peace and sublimity characterizes the church interior in its simplicity. The most valuable part of St. Mark's Church is its south portal, considered to be the work of sculptors of the Parler family from Prague (end of the 14th century). The Gothic composition of the portal consists of fifteen effigies placed in eleven shallow niches. On top are the statues of Joseph and Mary with the infant Jesus, and below them one can see St. Mark and the Lion; the Twelve Apostles are placed on both sides of the portal (four wooden statues replaced the original ones which had been destroyed). In its artistic composition and the number of statues, this portal is the richest and the most valuable Gothic portal in southern Central Europe. Outside, on the northwest wall of the church lies the oldest coat of arms of Zagreb with the year 1499 engraved in it (the original is kept in the Zagreb City Museum). On the roof, tiles are laid so that they represent the coat of arms of Zagreb (white castle on red background) and Triune Kingdom of Croatia, Slavonia and Dalmatia.

In computational geometry, an alpha shape, or Œ±-shape, is a family of piecewise linear simple curves in the Euclidean plane associated with the shape of a finite set of points. They were first defined by . The alpha-shape associated with a set of points is a generalization of the concept of the convex hull, i.e. every convex hull is an alpha-shape but not every alpha shape is a convex hull.  Characterization  For each real number Œ±, define the concept of a generalized disk of radius 1/Œ± as follows: * If Œ± = 0, it is a closed half- plane; * If Œ± > 0, it is a closed disk of radius 1/Œ±; * If Œ± < 0, it is the closure of the complement of a disk of radius ‚àí1/Œ±. Then an edge of the alpha- shape is drawn between two members of the finite point set whenever there exists a generalized disk of radius 1/Œ± containing none of the point set and which has the property that the two points lie on its boundary. If Œ± = 0, then the alpha-shape associated with the finite point set is its ordinary convex hull.  Alpha complex  Alpha shapes are closely related to alpha complexes, subcomplexes of the Delaunay triangulation of the point set. Each edge or triangle of the Delaunay triangulation may be associated with a characteristic radius, the radius of the smallest empty circle containing the edge or triangle. For each real number Œ±, the Œ±-complex of the given set of points is the simplicial complex formed by the set of edges and triangles whose radii are at most 1/Œ±. The union of the edges and triangles in the Œ±-complex forms a shape closely resembling the Œ±-shape; however it differs in that it has polygonal edges rather than edges formed from arcs of circles. More specifically, showed that the two shapes are homotopy equivalent. (In this later work, Edelsbrunner used the name \\"Œ±-shape\\" to refer to the union of the cells in the Œ±-complex, and instead called the related curvilinear shape an Œ±-body.)  Examples  This technique can be employed to reconstruct a Fermi surface from the electronic Bloch spectral function evaluated at the Fermi level, as obtained from the Green function in a generalised ab-initio study of the problem. The Fermi surface is then defined as the set of reciprocal space points within the first Brillouin zone, where the signal is highest. The definition has the advantage of covering also cases of various forms of disorder. KKR Bloch spectral function reconstruction See also *Beta skeleton  References  * N. Akkiraju, H.

Design work commenced in January 1940 and the first prototype was ready by April 1941.Starkings, 2007, pp.26‚Äì31 Despite the similarity of the K10W to other contemporary Japanese aircraft such as the Tachikawa Ki-55 and Mitsubishi Ki-51, it suffered from stall and stability problems that resulted in 16 pre-production testing aircraft being built.Starkings, 2007, pp.26‚Äì31 Work at Kyuhsu on the Q1W maritime patrol bomber and K11W carrier crew trainer were given a higher priority. Kyushu would build only nine production aircraft before production was transferred in 1943 to Nippon Hikoki (a small company that did a lot of subcontract work), who in turn built 150 examples before production ended in August 1944.Starkings, 2007, pp.26‚Äì31 The Japanese had purchased two NA-16's and western sources have long believed that the K10W1 was a development of these, however a close study of the Oak, as it was code named by the Allies, shows that they shared nothing beyond a similar configuration. Whereas the NA-16's featured a steel tube structure covered with metal or fabric panels, the K10W1 was of flush riveted stressed skin construction throughout (excepting the fabric covered control surfaces) with a slightly smaller wingspan, narrower chord wings, a longer fuselage and a higher aspect ratio tailplane. The entire cockpit was further forward and the wings were swept forward rather than aft as on the NA-16.Fletcher, 2011, pp.82-83 In addition, controls were run internally, and footrests retracted rather than being fixed.Starkings, 2007, pp.26‚Äì31 A version of the K10W built from wood was planned as the K10W2 but was never built.Starkings, 2007, pp.26‚Äì31 Operational service The K10W1 was not popular with crews possibly due to ongoing handling problems and only served with a small number of units which included the Oi, Go, Takarazuka and 81st Kokutais (Naval Air Groups) as trainers. Japanese records do not show that any were used for Kamikaze attacks, although a small number were definitely used as target tugs for gunnery training and as unit hacks attached to operational bases where they probably assisted in getting new pilots up to speed.

The Wheeler‚ÄìSchebler Carburetor Company Building was the company's original building at the Barth Avenue site. Note: This includes It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2004.  History  In 1904, Harry C. Stutz, who was involved in the design and manufacture of internal combustion engines, introduced George Schebler to Frank W. Wheeler. In the resulting partnership, Wheeler provided the money, while Schebler provided the engineering skills. Stutz worked temporarily as Sales Manager. By 1907, they had achieved enough success to move to Indianapolis into a state-of-the-art factory, reportedly one of the most advanced in the United States at the time. It produced carburetors for over 15 makes of autos from 1911 up to 1951. Frank Wheeler and three other local men opened the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in 1909. Prior to the inauguration of the Indianapolis 500 in 1911, the Wheeler- Schebler company sponsored the Wheeler-Schebler Trophy Race at the track. George Schebler sold his interests in the company in 1912, but it continued to operate under the Wheeler-Schebler name until 1928, when it evolved into the Marvel-Schebler Carburetor Company, one of five companies that played a role in the development of what became Borg-Warner Corporation. The Marvel-Schebler company did some of the early work on fuel injection systems in the late 1950s and early 60s, eventually merging with the Tillotson Carburetor Company in 1971. In 1985, the name was revised to \\"Control Systems\\" by the parent company, Borg-Warner. When Borg-Warner went through a leveraged buyout in 1987, Borg Warner Automotive Inc. was spun off as an independent company that is still in operation, developing fuel efficient engine and drive train technology. To this day, the trophy awarded annually to the winner of the Indianapolis 500 is known as the Borg-Warner Trophy. The original Wheeler- Schebler building still survives. It used to house the \\"Wheeler Arts Community\\" and the \\"Community Arts and Education Center\\" in the Fountain Square district of Indianapolis at 1035 East Sanders Street until it was closed in 2018. The building is now being converted into market-rate housing units.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. History In 1900, the Indianapolis, Columbus & Southern Interurban Company began service on an interurban rail line extending from downtown Indianapolis to several nearby towns. Note: This includes and Accompanying photographs The line ran along Madison Avenue. In the late 1910s and early 1920s, increasing use of the automobile and public transportation led people to relocate farther from urban centers. The Homecroft site, located from downtown alongside the Madison Avenue interurban, was a desirable location for relocation. In 1923, the Frank E. Gates Real Estate Company bought the land and named the area \\"Homecroft\\". The firm consisted of Frank Gates and his son Oliver, and they had already developed several subdivisions in Indiana, Ohio, and Michigan. Description The Homecroft Historic District is typical of 1920s suburbs built for middle- class families. It consists of 63 structures spread over . Some of the homes are patterned after model houses built by the Gates Company, while others are based on designs chosen by the original lot buyers. The houses are single- family homes; most are of modest size, one or one-and-a-half stories covered with brick or stone veneer. Architectural styles include Bungalow, American Craftsman, Colonial Revival, and Tudor Revival. Sidewalks were run through the area in the 1930s by the Works Progress Administration, and the Gates Company planted maples along the streets, which are now mature. The district has remained cohesive despite the later encroachment of commercial strips along Madison Avenue, and has maintained the feel of a small satellite town.

This is related to the Worker Protection Standard. Specifically, this requires unrestricted employee access to the Material Safety Data Sheet or equivalent, and appropriate training needed to understand health and safety risks. History Workplace safety in the USA began with Dr. Alice Hamilton in Chicago, who began working for the state of Illinois in 1910 to deal with workplace safety. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration was established in 1970 to standardize safety for all workers in the United States, and hazard communication for toxic substance exposure was included during the 1980s. The Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labeling of Chemicals (GHS) is currently being pursued to standardize workplace hazard protection internationally. OSHA's Hazard Communication Standard (HAZCOM) was first adopted in 1983 in the United States with limited scope (48 FR 53280; November 25, 1983). In 1987, scope was expanded to cover all industries where employees are potentially exposed to hazardous chemicals (52 FR 31852; August 24, 1987). This is managed by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. This is managed by states that have an approved plan. The standard is identified in 29 C.F.R. 1910.1200. The summary is as follows. Employers shall maintain copies of any material safety data sheets ... and shall ensure that the material safety data sheets are readily accessible during each work shift to employees when they are in their work area(s); and Employers shall ensure that employees are provided with information and training ... to detect the presence or release of a hazardous chemical in the work area ... the physical and health hazards of the chemicals in the work area ... The United States Department of Defense does not manage hazards in accordance with public law. * DoD and the right to know Purpose Employees access to hazard information is one of the prerequisites required for access to competent medical diagnosis and treatment. Environmental illness share characteristics with common diseases. Cyanide exposure symptoms include weakness, headache, nausea, confusion, dizziness, seizures, cardiac arrest, and unconsciousness. Influenza and heart disease include the same symptoms. Failure to obtain proper disclosure is likely to lead to improper or ineffective medical diagnosis and treatment. The Hazard Communication Standard requires the Material Safety Data Sheet to be made readily available for workplace exposure in the United States, because this information is required by physicians so they can do their job. Physicians also require epidemiological data maintained by local government agencies responsible for maintaining pesticide application data for use outside buildings (environmental exposure). This is part of the Right to know.

Spills, mishaps, illnesses, and injuries are not normally handled in accordance with local, state and federal law. Failure to administer discipline for illegal activity occurring within a military command is considered to be dereliction of duty, which is administered under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. Individuals with information about environmental crimes and individuals with environmental injuries involving the military should become familiar with the topic of Whistleblower protection in United States. Government employees, government contractors, and military officers often lack the training, education, licensing, and experience required to understand the legal requirements involving environmental safety. The sophistication required to understand legal requirements is not normally required for promotion and contractor selection within the military. Because of this, specific rules are documented in orders and directives that need to be written in plain language intended to be understood by people that have a 4th grade reading ability. Law are enforced is performed by the commanding officer in military organizations. The commanding officer typically has the ability to read and understand written requirements. A Flag Officer is subject to Court-martial action if laws or government policies are violated under their command when the activity is outside the scope of mission orders and rules of engagement. Each commanding officer is responsible for writing and maintaining policies simple enough to be understood by everyone in their command. Each commanding officer is responsible for ensuring that command policy documents are made available to every person in their command (civilian, military, and contractor). The commanding officer is responsible for disciplinary action and public disclosures when policies are violated within their command. Military agencies operate independently of law enforcement, judicial authority, and common law. Similar exemptions exist for some state agencies. Potential crimes are investigated by military police. The following is an example of the kinds of policy documents used to conduct criminal investigations. * Naval Inspector General; Investigations Manual Because military law enforcement is performed with no independent civilian oversight, there is an inherent conflict of interest. Information and disclosures are obtained through Freedom of Information Act request and not through disclosures ordinarily associated with the EPA and OSHA that have the competency required for training, certification, disclosure, and enforcement. This prevents physicians from obtaining the kind of information needed to diagnose and treat environmental illness, so the root cause for environmental illness typically remains permanently unknown. The following organization may help when the root cause for an illness remains unknown longer than 30 days. * Office of the Secretary of Defense and Joint Staff; Freedom of Information Act Requester Service Center Criminal violations, injuries, and potential enforcement actions begin by exchanging information in the following venues when civilian government employees and flag officers are unable to deal with the situation in an ethical manner. * Local labor union officials * Freedom of information in the United States * Office of the Inspector General, U.S. Department of Defense (Hotline) * United States Secretary of Defense * President of the United States * United States Secretary of State * United States House of Representatives * United States Senate US federal laws, state laws, local laws, foreign laws, and treaty agreements may not apply.

Early life and education  Born Stephanie Dawn Young in Huntington, West Virginia, she was raised in Hamlin, West Virginia. Thacker earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in marketing, magna cum laude, from Marshall University in 1987 and her Juris Doctor, with honors, from West Virginia University in 1990.  Professional career  After graduating from law school, Thacker spent two years working in the Pittsburgh office of the law firm Kirkpatrick & Lockhart (now K&L; Gates). She then worked briefly for the West Virginia Office of the Attorney General before joining the law firm King, Betts & Allen. In 1994, Thacker took a job in the United States Attorney's office for the Southern District of West Virginia, serving as an Assistant United States Attorney in the Criminal Division and handling a wide range of criminal prosecutions. In 1999, Thacker moved to Washington, D.C. to work as a trial attorney in the United States Department of Justice's Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section. She worked there for seven years, serving as Deputy Chief of Litigation for two years and then as Principal Deputy Chief of Litigation for five years. She also was part of the team that prosecuted the first case the United States ever brought involving the Violence Against Women Act. In 2006, Thacker joined the Charleston, West Virginia, law firm Guthrie & Thomas as a partner.  Federal judicial service  In July 2011, the West Virginia Record reported that President Obama would select Thacker to the judicial vacancy on the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit that had been created by the death of Judge M. Blane Michael. Michael had died in March 2011. On September 8, 2011, Obama formally nominated Thacker to be a judge on the Fourth Circuit. The Judiciary Committee reported her nomination to the floor of the Senate on November 3, 2011. The United States Senate confirmed her nomination by a vote of 91‚Äì3 on April 16, 2012. She received her commission on April 17, 2012. In October 2017, Thacker wrote for the panel majority when it found that the Bladensburg Peace Cross memorial from World War I now violated the Constitution's Establishment Clause and ordering either its arms removed or the entire monument razed.. Her judgement was ultimately reversed by the U.S. Supreme Court in American Legion v. American Humanist Association (2019). In April 2018, Thacker wrote for the majority when it found that a Maryland law prohibiting price gouging in prescription drug prices violated the constitution's Dormant Commerce Clause..

It occurred on Thursday, September 8, 2011, beginning at about 3:38 pm PDT. It was the largest power failure in California history. Background The Southwest Area Corridor, as of 2007 At the time of the 2011 blackout, San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E;, a subsidiary of Sempra Energy) was connected to Arizona by the Southwest Power Link, which is a single 500 kV power line (the next year, SDG&E; completed a second line, the 500 kV Sunrise Power Link which was under construction during the event but still, it only parallels the Southwest Power Link and connects back to it at Imperial Valley; the remaining section into Arizona is still a single line). There is no other interconnection at the 500 kV level between SDG&E; and other adjacent utilities. Rather, SDG&E; is interconnected to Southern California Edison (SCE) by Path 44, a set of five separate 230 kv transmission lines which are all supplied through the switch yard of San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station (SONGS). Imperial Irrigation District (IID) has a 92 kV sub-transmission system connected to both. Events Due to a mistake by a technician, a 500 kV line between Arizona Public Service's Hassayampa substation near the Palos Verdes Nuclear Generating Station in Tonopah, Arizona and the North Gila substation in Yuma, Arizona was accidentally shut down. This transmission line is part of the Southwest Power Link. With the line shut down, the 500kv Southwest Power Link went from San Diego to Yuma, AZ but was not supplied by anything else. APS estimated a quick reconnection. However, the line opening had caused a large phase difference in the grid and the line could not be connected until the next day. Most of the power to the San Diego area was then rerouted through Southern California Edison's system through San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station's (SONGS) switchyard. At this point SDG&E;'s system was taking more power from Southern California Edison than it could supply through SONGS' switchyard, and this would get worse as events progressed. Imperial Irrigation District's sub-transmission system also ended up transferring a portion of the power between Southern California Edison's Palo Verde-Devers 500kv line and San Diego Gas & Electric's 500kv Southwest Power Link. In less than a minute, two transformers at IID's Coachella Valley Substation overloaded and disconnected. This caused severe low voltage on Imperial Irrigation District's system. Several minutes later, another transformer tripped off, causing the bulk of IID's system to be disconnected from Southern California Edison to the north. This caused drastic voltage problems which resulted in a loss of about half of IID's load as well as some generation. Similar transformer overloads caused the Yuma area to be disconnected from WALC's system. The only supply to Yuma was now a backfeed from San Diego and Imperial Valley through the remainder of the 500 kV Southwest Power Link. One more transmission line tripped off, which was the last connection east of SONGS, between WALC's system to the north and SDG&E;'s system, CFE's system, and the Yuma area to the south. What remained of the IID system had only one connection, the S-line to the remnants of the 500 kV Southwest Power Link at Imperial Valley Substation. This line overloaded as well. Instead of just cutting that line, their scheme commanded two generators in Mexico to go off-line. This was to solve a problem that no longer existed, and actually made the problem worse. Then the line did trip off, and most of IID's remaining load was lost. All the power to San Diego, Baja California, Mexico, and Yuma, Arizona was now being drawn from Southern California Edison through SONGS' switchyard. This draw was very high (around 170%), and a \\"safety net\\" system, the SONGs Separation Scheme, operated and disconnected 230kv lines going into San Diego. SDG&E;'s system, CFE's Baja California system, and APS's Yuma service area were now completely separated from the Western Interconnection. This island had insufficient generation and rapidly spun down. Load shedding throughout this system operated rapidly, but some generation was still lost. In seconds, San Diego, Mexico, and Yuma, Arizona broke into three islands‚Äîall of which then collapsed. Both units at SONGS also shut down, although this had no effect. Effect Five utilities were affected: SDG&E;, serving San Diego County and parts of southern Orange County and Riverside County; Imperial Irrigation District, serving the Imperial Valley; the portion of Comisi√≥n Federal de Electricidad (CFE), Mexico's electric utility, serving Baja California; Arizona Public Service (APS); and the Western Area Power Administration's Lower Colorado system (WALC). The blackout left nearly seven million people without power, including 1.4 million customers in San Diego County and 1.1 million customers in Mexico. The outage was the result of 23 distinct events that occurred on 5 separate power grids in a span of 11 minutes. Federal, regional and local officials investigated what happened and why the outage cascaded the way it did. APS's North Gila Substation reported power loss at 3:27 pm PDT. Within seconds a portion of a Mexico power plant shut down, but there was no indication that Arizona impacted Mexico. Units 2 and 3 at SONGS automatically tripped offline due to a \\"grid disturbance\\" which initiated the plant's Emergency Feed Actuation System (EFAS). The hardest hit region of the blackout, the San Diego-Tijuana metropolitan area, was essentially brought to a standstill. Surface streets became gridlocked due to the loss of traffic signals, and the San Diego skyline went dark. The San Diego Trolley system was shut down as there was no power to operate trains and related functions. Citizens in Tijuana and in inland areas like the Coachella Valley stayed outdoors late into the night to escape the heat. Freeways in the Southern California megalopolis experienced extreme clogging, especially on the I-15 and I-5 corridors between southeastern Greater Los Angeles and the San Diego area's North County. One hospital was left without power for two hours when its backup generator failed. Blythe in the Palo Verde Valley was reportedly not affected by the outage. Aftermath Eleven hours after the outage began, power was restored to 694,000 of the affected customers, and by 4:30 am on September 9 power was restored to all customers, although the system was described as \\"still fragile\\". As a precaution, all public schools in San Diego County and the Capistrano Unified School District in southern Orange County were closed on September 9. Most major universities and community colleges, as well as all federal courts in San Diego, closed for the day as well. The outage caused significant losses to restaurants and grocery stores, which were forced to discard quantities of spoiled food; perishable food losses at grocery stores, eating establishments and households were estimated at $12 million to $18 million. The outage also caused some sewage pumping stations to fail, resulting in contaminated beaches and potentially unsafe water supplies in several areas. As a precaution, in some neighborhoods, residents were told to boil their water or use bottled water for several days after the outage. Due to the failure at the sewage pumping stations, diesel generators were installed at five pumping stations. Question of association with terrorism The outage occurred days before the tenth anniversary of the September 11 attacks, and hours before the United States Department of Homeland Security warned of a potential terrorist attack leading up to the anniversary, so that a first reaction to the blackout was to wonder if it might be the result of an attack. However, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and SDG&E; ruled out terrorism early in their investigation, and no subsequent evidence was found to suggest that the outage was anything other than accidental. Analysis On April 27, 2012, the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the North American Electric Reliability Corporation issued a joint report analyzing the technical details of the blackout and gave 27 findings and recommendations to prevent a recurrence. The report found problems in operations planning and situational awareness. Some of the findings are: The event showed that the system was not in an \\"N-1\\" state. Utilities are required to operate the system so that the failure of one component will not cause instability, separation, or cascading failures. Next-day plans largely did not match the system at the time. For example, some utilities had plans based on a \\"heavy summer\\" scenario. This is the worst case in terms of load, but it does not consider that several generating stations may be out of service for maintenance. Components with a voltage of 92 kV, which is a large part of IID's system, were not included in simulations. The simulations included components with a voltage of 100 kV or higher. Typically lower-voltage components (e.g. 69 kV) can be ignored. Protection schemes were not considered in their effect on the bulk power system. These are supposed to be reviewed; in fact, some of them were not really considered in terms of their effects. The \\"S line\\" scheme was intended to protect one of IID's transformers, but in fact that transformer was not overloaded. The fact that it disconnected generation was not helpful, and without this the blackout would not have occurred. Also, the results of the SONGS separation scheme were not really considered. It was thought to be for an extreme case that was unlikely to really occur. The report offers some comments on large phase-angle differences in the power grid and what can be done to detect and deal with such problems. According to their power flow simulations, it would have been difficult to reconnect the transmission line even with a significant shift in generation. In the event there was not sufficient time to fix things this way. There is also included some comparison with the 2003 Northeast blackout. Many of the same factors contributed to both events.

In 2006, his longtime friend Rey Rivera died mysteriously after working for Stansberry Research as a financial writer.https://www.wbaltv.com/article/suicide-or-murder-evidence- reviewed/7054411 Career In 1999, Stansberry founded Stansberry Research, a private publishing company based in Baltimore, Maryland. =SEC case= In 2002, Stansberry sent out an email offering to sell for $1,000 the name of a company purportedly about to obtain a contract to dismantle nuclear weapons for Russia. The Securities and Exchange Commission sued him in 2003 on this basis and for his newsletters containing \\"nothing more than baseless speculation and outright lies\\", accusing him of a \\"scheme to defraud public investors by disseminating false information in several Internet newsletters.\\" The case went to trial in 2005, and a federal court, upheld on appeal, found that Stansberry had sent out a newsletter to subscribers predicting one company's stock, USEC Inc., was going to increase by over 100%. Stansberry maintains that his information came from a company executive; the court ruled that he fabricated the source. In 2007 a U.S. District Court judge ordered Stansberry and his investment firm, then called \\"Pirate Investor\\", to pay $1.5 million in restitution and civil penalties for defrauding \\"public investors by disseminating false information in several Internet newsletters.\\" The court rejected Stansberry‚Äôs First Amendment defense, saying \\"Stansberry's conduct undoubtedly involved deliberate fraud, making statements that he knew to be false.\\" At the time of the trial, many media outlets spoke out due to their views that the case was relevant to First Amendment rights. A group of newspaper publishers urged the Supreme Court to reverse the decision by the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals that Stansberry was liable, and signed an Amici Curiae in defense of Stansberry. They claimed that a guilty verdict was \\"a significant threat to the free dissemination of news about the financial markets and specific investment opportunities\\" and could lead to a situation that \\"would be contrary to the spirit of our system of a free and independent press.\\" When the Supreme Court refused to hear the case, a New York Times editorial column noted that \\"the implications of the S.E.C.'s action are potentially profound: newspapers or Web sites promising their paying readers stock information that later turns out to be untrue suddenly leave themselves open to fraud charges. Any financial commentator who passes on bad information in good faith could be sued.\\" = Continued career = Stansberry is the editor of the internet financial newsletters Porter Stansberry's Investment Advisory and Porter Stansberry‚Äôs Put Strategy Report. He also contributes regularly to Daily Wealth and The Growth Stock Wire, other Stansberry Research publications. He became the first American editor of the Fleet Street Letter, Britain‚Äôs longest-running financial newsletter. Stansberry is a frequent contributor to WorldNet Daily, an American web site that publishes news and associated content from the perspective of U.S. conservatives and the political right. In June 2017, Stansberry Research Publications began publishing a financial/political online opinion magazine, American Consequences, which ostensibly is intended to be, \\"a new, online magazine about what's really happening in American finance‚Ä¶ and what's about to happen next.\\" The Editor in Chief is libertarian journalist, humorist and commentator, P. J. O'Rourke. Stansberry is listed as a contributing editor. The free publication includes many ads for Stansberry publications and seminars. Rivera case On May 24, 2006, Stansberry's childhood friend and coworker Rey Rivera was found dead inside the Belvedere Hotel. He had left the house abruptly prior to disappearing after allegedly receiving a phone call from Agora's switchboard, the holding company for the Oxford Club, a company Rivera was doing freelance work for at the time. Stansberry claimed that this was impossible because \\"Every person in our company who had worked with Rey was on the Eastern Shore at the time that call was made, having a corporate retreat\\". Claims and predictions Porter Stansberry claimed to have made a number of successful financial market predictions. In June 2008, Porter claims that he predicted that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would go bankrupt in the next 12 months, as well as going on to say that he positioned his clients to profit by shorting stocks, and that he does not know of any other firm that \\"more accurately forecasted\\" or warned that the financial crisis was coming. By September 2008, both mortgage companies were placed into government conservatorship. Peter Schiff reviewed all of the newsletters that Stansberry released from 2006‚Äì2008 and challenged his \\"predictions\\" live on his radio show on the 26 May 2011. On October 22, 2012, Stansberry released a \\"tip\\" to his subscribers to invest heavily in gold. The full heading was \\"Why You Must Buy Gold, or Even Better, Silver, Now\\". Investigative journalist Brian Deer watched his tip and tracked performance. Even as the price fell over a month after his tip, an online interview was published wherein he responded to the question: \\"When do you suppose the gold price will start climbing again?\\" with \\"I don't have any timetable. I can just tell you that I haven't sold any of my gold and I won't until there is a gold-backed, well-financed national currency that offers me a reasonable yield for the risk I take to finance the government.\\" Since Porter's Gold recommendation on October 22, 2012, when gold was trading at $1,710 gold has risen to over $1,965 today.

Early life and education  Costa was born in Baltimore, Maryland, but grew up in Richardson, Texas, where he attended Richardson High School. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1994 from Dartmouth College. While at Dartmouth, Costa interned for the Democratic National Committee. After college, Costa taught elementary school in Sunflower, Mississippi as part of the Teach for America program from 1994 until 1996. He then earned a Juris Doctor from the University of Texas School of Law in 1999, where he was the Editor-in-Chief of the Texas Law Review. From 1999 until 2000, Costa served as a law clerk to Judge A. Raymond Randolph on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. He then served as a law clerk to Chief Justice William Rehnquist on the U.S. Supreme Court from 2001 until 2002.  Professional career  From 2002 until 2005, Costa worked as an associate at the law firm Weil, Gotshal & Manges in Houston. From 2005‚Äì2012, Costa served as an Assistant United States Attorney in the Southern District of Texas. = Allen Stanford prosecution = Likely Costa's highest-profile prosecution in his six years as a federal prosecutor has been the case against alleged Ponzi schemer Allen Stanford, who was indicted in 2009. In January 2011, Stanford's legal team requested a delay of the start of his scheduled January 24, 2011 trial, noting that they had only taken over his defense in October 2010. Costa told the judge presiding over the trial that while he did not object to some delay in the trial, \\"the requested continuance of two years is excessive.\\" In February 2011, Stanford sued Costa and his fellow prosecutor Paul Pelletier, along with several employees of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, complaining of \\"abusive law enforcement\\" and seeking $7.2 billion in damages. In March 2011, Stanford's attorneys argued that the defendant's right to a speedy trial had been violated. Costa, however, told the Associated Press that delays largely were the result of Stanford's own requests for continuances. In March 2012, Stanford was found guilty on 13 of 14 counts including fraud, obstructing investigators and conspiracy to commit money laundering.  Federal judicial service  = Service on the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas = In July 2011, Texas's two Republican senators, John Cornyn and Kay Bailey Hutchison, sent a letter to President Barack Obama, recommending that he nominate Costa to the vacant seat on the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas that had been created when Judge John David Rainey took senior status in June 2010. The seat would be based in the Galveston Division. The anticipated nomination earned bipartisan support, as Democratic United States Representative Lloyd Doggett, who serves as the spokesman for Texas Democrats on federal judicial matters, urged the president to nominate Costa as well. On September 8, 2011, President Obama nominated Costa to the seat on the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas. He received a hearing by the Senate Judiciary Committee on November 2, 2011, and his nomination was reported to the floor on December 1, 2011. Costa's nomination was approved by the U.S. Senate on April 26, 2012, by a 97‚Äì2 vote and he received his commission the same day. = Service on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit = On December 19, 2013 President Obama nominated Judge Costa to a vacant seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit due to Fortunato Benavides assuming senior status. He received a hearing before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee on February 25, 2014. On March 27, 2014, Costa's nomination was reported out of committee by voice vote. On May 13, 2014, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid filed for cloture on Costa's nomination. On Thursday May 15, 2014 the Senate voted 58‚Äì36 on the motion to invoke cloture. On Tuesday, May 20, 2014 the Senate voted 97‚Äì0 for final confirmation and elevation to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.

The technology for manufacturing solar cells on paper was developed by a group of researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with support from the National Science Foundation and the Eni-MIT Alliance Solar Frontiers Program. Features Circuits of organic photovoltaic materials are deposited in five layers on ordinary paper substrates in a vacuum chamber. It is done by coating conformal conductive polymer electrodes with oxidative chemical vapor, a process known as chemical vapor deposition. Such solar panels are capable of producing voltages exceeding than 50V, which in turn can power appliances at normal lighting conditions. The solar cell is also shown to be flexible. The solar cell conductive grid is similar to an inkjet photo printout with patterned rectangles. When leads are attached to the electrical substrate, it is shown to power electrical appliances. The cost of \\"printing\\" (as MIT describes it) is claimed to be similar to that of inkjet photo printing. This technology uses vapor deposition temperatures of less than 120¬∞C, which makes it easier to manufacture on ordinary paper. The current efficiency of the panel is near 1%, which the researcher hopes to improve in the near future. Testing The circuit was also tested by depositing the photovoltaic materials on a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate. The PET sheet was folded and unfolded 1000 times and no overt deterioration in performance was observed, whereas common photovoltaic materials deposited on PET deteriorated with just a single fold. The solar cell was also passed through a laser printer to demonstrate its continued performance after exposure to [somewhat] high temperatures and it still retained its characteristics after the procedure. Advantages In conventional solar panels, the supporting structures of the panel like glass, brackets etc. are mostly twice as costly as the photovoltaic materials manufactured on them. As paper costs approximately a thousandth of glass, solar cells using printing processes can be much cheaper than conventional solar panels. Also other methods involving coating papers with materials include first coating the paper with a smooth material to counter- act the molecular scale roughness of paper. But in this method, the photovoltaic material can be coated directly onto untreated paper. Applications If such solar cells can achieve sufficient technological maturity, they can be used as wall paper and window shades for producing electricity from room lighting. They can also be manufactured on clothing, which can in turn be used to charge portable electronic devices like mobile phones and media players. Flexible solar modules can be used on curved roofs, or roofs where it does not make sense to install a rack mounting system. Disadvantages In order to last 20+ years outdoors exposed to the elements, such solar cells must be finished with a front sheet of a UV-resistant fluoropolymer or thermoplastic olefin rather than the glass used in conventional solar cells, which is comparatively inexpensive (citation needed). Solar cells must be sealed so water and oxygen cannot enter and destroy the cells via oxidative degradation.

In August 2007, the court found Stansberry guilty with the U.S. Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals and subsequently denied a 2009 appeal. Death of Rey Rivera On May 24, 2006, the body of Rey Rivera, a financial writer and videographer for Stansberry Research was found inside the Belvedere Hotel. Rey Rivera and Porter Stansberry met when they were teenagers and were best friends. Rey Rivera and his wife had moved to Baltimore so that Rivera could work with Stansberry. The Baltimore Police Department was unable to question Rivera's workplace regarding the nature of Rivera's death due to a gag order placed by Stansberry's legal team hours after Rivera's body was found. Porter Stansberry has refused to speak to police about the death of his best friend. The case is unique to Stansberry Research due to Rivera's longtime friendship with Porter Stansberry and Rivera receiving a phone call from the Stansberry offices at the moment of his disappearance on May 16, 2006.

It was one of a group of vessels known as the \\"China Fleet\\", which were acquired by the RAN in similar circumstances. Built in 1941 for the China Steam Navigation Company, Poyang was acquired by the RAN in 1942, and commissioned into naval service at the end of 1943. Poyang operated with the RAN until 1946, when she was decommissioned and returned to her owners. The ship changed hands several times between 1963 and 1965, and operated under the names Bali Steer and Rosalina. The vessel was scrapped in 1970.

She plied the east coast of Australia and also was in Noum√©a and Milne Bay during 1942. She was commissioned into the Royal Australian Navy as HMAS Poyang on 6 December 1943 and served in New Guinea waters in 1944. Sailed as part of the supply force for the Leyte campaign, and was attached to the supply force for the military landings at Lingayen Gulf, however Poyang was not present at the landing. She then served in Australian waters until early 1945, where she served in New Guinea and Morotai areas. Poyang was part of the landing on 22 September 1945 of the Australian 33rd Brigade on Ambon for the surrender of Imperial Japanese forces on the island. The vessel returned to Australia, after serving in Solomon Islands area, on 12 January 1946 and was paid off on 6 March and later handed back to her owners. She was sold in February 1963 to Power Navigation, Hong Kong, then resold to Steering Line, Hong Kong and renamed Bali Steer. She was transferred to Steering Line Company, Liberia in May 1964, and delivered to Cia Nav. Viento del Sur, Singapore in June 1965 and renamed Rosalina.

It is found in shallow waters off the northwest coast of Europe and usually lives symbiotically with the sea anemone Adamsia palliata. Description Like other hermit crabs, P. prideaux has an asymmetric, unarmoured abdomen and protects this by concealing it within the empty shell of a gastropod of appropriate size and shape, and carrying it around by clasping onto an internal part of the columella of the sea snail shell. The carapace of the crab is brownish-red with paler patches and rather wider than it is long. It has several tufts of short bristles and can reach a length of . The right cheliped can block the entrance to the shell. It is armed with a pincer and is larger than the left one. Distribution and habitat P. prideaux is found on sand, gravel and mud between the tide marks and in the shallow sublittoral. It particularly favours muddy areas with shell fragments and gravel. It occurs in the Mediterranean Sea, the North Sea and the northeast Atlantic Ocean from Cape Verde north to Norway. Ecology P. prideaux is nearly always found in association with the sea anemone, Adamsia palliata (the \\"cloak anemone\\"). The anemone grows on the underside of the shell inhabited by the hermit crab. Its base enlarges and two flaps wrap around the shell until eventually they meet at the top. Its base secretes a chitinous membrane that extends the gastropod shell, enlarging its capacity, and allowing the hermit crab to occupy it for a longer period. The relationship between the two is symbiotic. The crab is less likely to be attacked by predators because of the anemone's nematocysts and the anemone in turn benefits from the food fragments thrown up by the crab's activities. Another animal with which P. prideaux has a symbiotic relationship is the polychaete worm Iphitime paguri. Adult worms and the larval stages are frequently found in the apex of the gastropod shell. Intermediate sized worms are found in the gill chambers and in a groove under the carapace.

Bogert, of the Westervelt & Co. Shipyard of New York City. The engines were built by the Morgan Iron Works, also in New York City. The original name of the ship was Queen of the Pacific. Dimensions This was a 2,801 gross ton ship, with a length of 327 feet and a beam measuring 42 feet. It had a straight stem, two funnels and two masts. The ship was of wooden construction, with side-paddle propulsion and a speed of 12 knots. There was accommodation for 350 1st- & 2nd-class passengers. History =Queen of the Pacific= Launched in April 1857, Queen of the Pacific had been ordered by the Morgan & Garrison Partnership. This was a company set up as part of the scheme of Charles Morgan and Charles Garrison to replace the Accessory Transit Company of Cornelius Vanderbilt as the dominant company serving the lucrative New York - San Francisco trade route during the period of the California Gold Rush. Morgan and Garrison were trustees of Vanderbilt's company. The Partnership had been set up in connection with the armed takeover of Nicaragua by the American adventurer William Walker, with the help of some 100 other United States citizens. Declaring himself President of the Republic, Walker then cancelled the charter of Vanderbilt's Transit Company to transport passengers across the Isthmus of Panama and seized its property, transferring it to Morgan & Garrison. Vanderbilt was enraged by this betrayal by his own trustees. In a famous letter he sent the rival company, he swore to crush the enterprise, rather than waste time in legal action. He successfully lobbied the U.S. government to withhold recognition of Walker's puppet state. Walker was soon defeated by Central American forces and Morgan & Grant came to an end. =Ocean Queen= By that time, the waning of the Gold Rush meant decreased demand for transit to California. The ship was sold to Cornelius Vanderbilt's European Line in 1859, altered, and renamed. On 17 May 1859, she commenced her first New York - Southampton - Le Havre voyage. The fifth‚Äîand final‚Äîcrossing from Le Havre to Southampton and New York started on 23 November 1859. In 1861, she was chartered to the United States War Department, for which she sailed until the end of the American Civil War. In May 1864, Ocean Queen transported 220 Navy recruits from Aspinwall, Pennsylvania to New York City. Approximately 30 mutineers tried to seize the command of the ship, but Navy Commander Daniel Ammen, who was in charge of the recruits aboard the ship and Captain Tinklepaugh shot the leaders of the mutiny and regained control of the vessel. After the Civil War, she once again sailed between New York and Panama, carrying passengers destined for California, who then had to take a train across the Isthmus and find passage on the Pacific side. She commenced her first New York - Bremen - Copenhagen voyage under charter to Ruger Brothers & Associates on 7 April 1869. One further voyage was made, leaving from New York to Le Havre, Brouwershaven, Swinem√ºnde, Christiansand, arriving back in New York on 3 March 1870. =Notable Passenger= The only passenger known (so far) to have achieved some note of fame was William Jay Gaynor, later the Mayor of New York (1910-1913), who eventually died of an assassin's bullet in 1913. He had sailed this ship in his youth, when he was a Roman Catholic teaching Brother, a member of the Brothers of the Christian Schools, better known as the Lasallian Christian Brothers. He was part of a group of seven Brothers sent to staff the newly founded St. Mary's College of California in San Francisco. They set sail from New York on the Ocean Queen on 16 July 1868, landing in Aspinwall, Panama, from which they then proceeded to San Francisco by train and ship. =End of the voyage= The ship was scrapped in 1875 in Wilmington, Delaware.

Da Silva's sound can be classified as International Fusion, as it is influenced by Brazilian music, namely Bossa Nova, but also incorporates elements of Lounge, Electronica, Indie Pop, MPB, and Worldbeat. Da Silva has released two solo albums Miles From Nowhere and Brasilissima. Her compositions have been featured in TV & Film, such as the Golden Globe Award winning film Lady Bird (2017), and the Paramount Network series American Woman (2018). Early life Monica da Silva was born in Grand Rapids, Michigan, to a Brazilian mother and an American father, who met while her father was in the Peace Corps in Bel√©m, Brazil. Because her mother is Brazilian, da Silva has dual Brazilian-American citizenship. Da Silva grew up living back and forth between the United States and Brazil. She is fluent in English and Portuguese. She started singing and playing piano and flute at an early age. Career =Early years and Nectar= Da Silva and her siblings Erica and Bruce Driscoll formed the band Nectar in their teens.

The duo met with Grammy nominated producer Rick Barnes, who agreed to record their songs at his studio Rax Trax. Miles From Nowhere, da Silva's first studio album, was released in 2007. The second song from the album was featured on a promotional video for 3M. =Brasilissima= In December 2007, da Silva met drummer Chad Alger, after responding to an ad he had posted on Craigslist. Alger's ad, searching for \\"someone to start a Brazilian project with\\", intrigued da Silva, who had been wanting to steer her music toward her Brazilian heritage. Da Silva and Alger formed a quartet, which performed regularly around Chicago. The pair also began writing original songs, featuring Alger on guitar. The songs they wrote were heavily influenced by Brazilian Bossa Nova. Da Silva later coined their sound Indie Nova. Da Silva's album Brasilissima was released on 3 December 2010. It was co-produced by Alger, and Bruce Driscoll (Freedom Fry, Blondfire), who is da Silva's brother. The first single from the album \\"A√≠ Ent√£o\\" was featured on the Putumayo World Music compilation Brazilian Beat in 2012.

Originally the centre of the Wotton Estate and the seat of the Evelyn family, it was the birthplace in 1620 of diarist and landscape gardener John Evelyn, who built the first Italian garden in England there.\\"At Wotton on his brother's estate he and a relation George Evelyn introduced between 1643 and 1652 what was really the first Italian garden into England, terracing a steep hillside and fitting a little temple into the bottom of it.\\" Construction The house was built in the early 17th century by the Evelyn family who extended it in the later 17th century. In the 18th century it was extended eastwards by William Kent. Further extensions and alterations were made in the early 19th century by Francis Edwards. Following a fire in the 1870s the house was restored and enlarged by Henry Woodyer for William John Evelyn in 1877. Its architectural features include distinctive terracotta decorations on brickwork, octagonal turrets and stacks, winged gryphons on the porch, and plaster wall panels by Kent painted in Chinese style by Belgian Jean Derraux. The old orangery (now the centre's bar), has a decorative parapet and banded piers. Many of the doors feature small paintings above them. The estate Wotton House, rear view showing terraced gardens, 2003 John Evelyn (1620‚Äì1706) and his elder brother George created the first Italian garden in England. Work on it started in 1643, was completed by 1652, and it is the house's most famous feature. The grounds are unusually highly listed as Grade II* and there are also two grottoes close to the house, both listed Grade II. The River Tillingbourne flows through the estate, which had its own mill at one time. The mill was originally used for the manufacture off gunpowder, a major source of the family's fortune. Later the mill was adapted for use as a wire-works and copper mill. Notable residents Wotton House was the family seat of the Evelyn Family. John Evelyn, the diarist, landscape designer and collector, was born in a room still in existence there. He inherited the house and estates on the death of his brother George in 1699. The descendants who inherited the house in turn included Conservative politician William John Evelyn (1822-1908), who was elected MP for Western Surrey from 1849 until 1857 and became MP for Deptford in 1885 until resigning in 1888. Post-war use Between 1947 and 1981 the house was leased to the Home Office and used as the Fire Service College. Grade II* listed status was given to the garden in 1984, and the house and its two garden grottoes became listed in 1987. Twenty- first century Wotton House being used as a wedding venue In 2003, having been fully refurbished following a period of relative neglect, Wotton House was re-opened as a hotel, wedding venue, training and conference centre. The property is currently owned and run by InterContinental Hotels Group.

She lives and works between New York City and Puerto Rico. Her unique dramatic public artworks has garnered enormous controversy due to its provocative nature and colorful statement. Maldonado is a leading contemporary artist that has collaborated with the Nuyorican Movement. Biography Sofia Maldonado was born and raised in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Her love for art manifested at a very young age. It was at the Liga del Arte in Old San Juan where she took her first formal art classes. Later, she attended junior high and high school at Central High of Visual Arts in Santurce. She received a BFA from the Escuela de Artes Pl√°sticas (2006) in San Juan, a Master of Fine Arts from the Pratt Institute in 2008, and was a fellow at the Vermont Studio Center. In 2008, Maldonado exhibited at Queens Museum. In 2009 Maldonado created a large scale public art work with Real Art Ways in Hartford, Connecticut. This artist, who shares her life between New York and Puerto Rico, is very prolific and involved in numerous artistic and community projects with a social dimension. Maldonado was selected by the Times Square Alliance to create a mural on 42nd Street in Manhattan in 2010. Maldonado has painted an expansive body of work including skateparks, murals, live painting performances, mix media, and video. Her work is inspired by dilapidated structures of the Caribbean, the Latina female character, and urban subcultures. Her murals, her immediately- recognizable style and her freshness make her one of ‚Äúthe most well-known young artists in Puerto Rico, with an accelerated trajectory who puts forward the themes and work techniques of many emerging artists‚Äù, the director of the MAC Marianne Ram√≠rez Aponte adds. Her work has been featured in solo exhibitions internationally, including Magnan Emrich, New York (2008), Witzenhausen Gallery, Amsterdam (2010), Museo de Arte Contempor√°neo, Puerto Rico (2010), Magnan Metz Gallery, NY (2010), Ringling Museum, Sarasota (2011), and the University of Wisconsin, Madison (2011).

He is an undead evil sorcerer bound to the servitude of four malevolent, godlike entities known as the Ancient Spirits of Evil. Native to the planet of Third Earth, Mumm-Ra's goal is to destroy the ThunderCats and ensure his world remains under his control. 1985 series During development of the show, while the creators were looking for various names for the main villain character, nothing sounded \\"evil\\" enough; not until Haim Saban suggested to use Mummia Raa (◊û◊ï◊û◊ô ◊®◊¢◊î - A Bad Mummy in Hebrew). It was shortened to Mumm-Ra. The demon sorcerer Mumm-Ra is the self-proclaimed \\"ever- living source of evil\\" on Third Earth, possessed of powers of sorcery and an apparently unlimited lifespan. He is, in fact, a bound servant to the Ancient Spirits of Evil (represented by four anthropomorphic statues of a boar, crocodile, vulture, and ox) who provide him with increased power and virtual immortality to further his pursuit of spreading their dark influence throughout Third Earth. Residing within the Black Pyramid amid the ruins of what appears to be an ancient Egyptian civilization, Mumm-Ra exists in a decayed, weakened form that must return to a stone sarcophagus to replenish his energy. He can summon the power to transform himself into a more vigorous, muscular form - Mumm-Ra, the Ever-Living - by reciting the incantation: \\"Ancient Spirits of Evil, transform this decayed form to Mumm-Ra, the Ever- Living!\\" While in this form, Mumm-Ra possesses fortification of his mystical might ‚Äî casting spells, throwing energy bolts, etc. ‚Äî to battle his foes. He can also alter his physical form into a variety of alter-egos to deceive his enemies. Seemingly invincible in whatever form he chooses, Mumm-Ra appears to have a singular weakness: seeing his own hideous reflection neutralizes his ability to remain outside the Black Pyramid and forces him to withdraw there in his emaciated mummy form. However, at the beginning of the second season, the Ancient Spirits of Evil overcome this shortcoming. Mumm-Ra is a master of deception, and will use whatever means necessary to fight against the forces of good. In later episodes, while endowing Mumm-Ra with his powers, the statues of the Ancient Spirits of Evil come down from their perches, and extend their arms over him. He uses his magic to create disguises and deceive the ThunderCats on various occasions. Among these are: Diamondfly (in the episode \\"Queen of Eight Legs\\"), Gregory Gregion (\\"All That Glitters\\"), Silky (\\"The Garden of Delights\\"), The Netherwitch (\\"The Astral Prison\\"), and Pumm-Ra (in the episode \\"Pumm-Ra\\"). He once took the form of King Arthur to acquire the legendary magic sword Excalibur, using it against the Sword of Omens. In a few episodes, Mumm-Ra has an even more powerful form beyond \\"Mumm-Ra the Ever- Living\\" called \\"Mumm-Ra the All-Powerful\\": in this manifestation, he absorbs the entire power of the Ancient Spirits of Evil to become grander in size and strength, and the design pattern on his loin cloth changes, as does his voice. This form is only presented in the series three times. In another incarnation, calling himself \\"Mumm-Ra the Dream Master\\", he enters the Thundercats' dreams to subliminally influence them. Mumm-Ra is regarded as immortal, and when defeated, he simply returns to his sarcophagus. Mumm-Ra cannot be truly killed; even in cases where his body is destroyed, he will eventually be restored, as he often states: \\"Wherever evil exists, Mumm-Ra lives!\\" Later, Mumm-Ra is shown to have a blue undead, bulldog-like companion named Ma-Mutt, capable of flight and supernatural feats of strength and speed. He is generally evil, though some episodes depict him as having sympathetic qualities. Ma-Mutt is the only living creature Mumm-Ra shows any compassion and love for - in one episode, after the machine in his evil plan is destroyed, he frantically searches for Ma-Mutt, and upon finding him, apologizes for being horrible to him. Fed up with Mumm-Ra's repeated failures, the Ancient Sprirts of Evil demand he destroy the ThunderCats or be exiled from Third Earth. When he misses the deadline, they trap him in a crystal with a miniature pyramid and cast him to the furthest reaches of the universe. When the ThunderCats rebuild and colonize New Thundera, the Spirits free Mumm-Ra and rebuild his cauldron on Third Earth. In one episode, it is said that Mumm- Ra once owned the Sphere of Seti which increased his power. When he recovers it after Char finds it, he plans to use it to increase his power and free himself from servitude to the Ancient Spirits of Evil. Angered at his plot, and his deceptive attempts to hide it, the Spirits seal off the Black Pyramid, forcing him to choose between sustenance (the pyramid) or power (the sphere). Ultimately, he admits he cannot survive without the pyramid, surrendering the sphere and resuming his role as a servant. 2011 series In the 2011 version, Mumm-Ra is an Ancient Spirit of Evil employed by the Ancient Spirits of Evil (confirmed by series Art Director Dan Norton) with changes including demon wings on his Ever-Living form, a larger body, and a weakness to intensely bright light. His ultimate goal is universal domination and enforcing his ideal order on it. When utilizing the power of the Gauntlet of Plun-Darr, Mumm-Ra's power increases and he gains a robed armored form (this continuity's equivalent to the All-Powerful form), with a skeletal mask and Egyptian headdress. In his Ever-Living form, he continues the show's trend of all characters and creatures being animals by showing traits of a leaf-nosed vampire bat. Centuries prior to the new series, Mumm-Ra used advanced technology and magic at his disposal to enslave the ancestors of the ThunderCats and the Animals into serving him so he would gather the Four Powerstones (the War Stone, the Tech Stone, the Spirit Stone, and the Soul Stone) from various planets to place on the Sword of Plun-Darr, a weapon forged from a star he had collapsed at the cost of the entire Plun-Darr galaxy. But managing to take the War Stone (which would become the Eye of Thundera) while staging a rebellion with the Animals' help, the ThunderCat Leo defeats Mumm-Ra and strips him of the other Powerstones. But when Mumm-Ra's pyramid spacecraft was pulled into Third Earth's atmosphere, Mumm-Ra entered his tomb to bide his time for everyone else to die in the resulting crash. However, the controls were smashed and Mumm-Ra was trapped within his pyramid as the stones and survivors spread across Third Earth. Many centuries later, Mumm-Ra used Grune to release him from his prison and masterminded Thundera's downfall. With the aid of Grune and Slythe, Mumm-Ra not only plans to obtain the Eye of Thundera, but to regain the other three Powerstones in order to get to the Sword of Plun-Darr and the remaining stones. Mumm-Ra also resurrected Pumyra to serve him and planted her amongst the Thunderian slaves. After Grune ends up trapped in the Astral Plane, Mumm-Ra has Slithe recruit the homicidal Addicus and sociopathic Kaynar to not only ensure the loyalty of the Lizard army and punish any deserters, but also increase their numbers with the new generals' respective races. Later, through a calculated scheme involving the revelation of his own agent Pumyra, Mumm-Ra regains the Sword of Plun-Darr (along with his All-Powerful form) and the Tech Stone while gaining a new ally in Vultaire. The series, had it not been cancelled, would presumably have followed Mumm-Ra's search for the final Stone, the Soul Stone. ThunderCats Roar Mumm-Ra is similar to his original 1985 incarnation, initially appearing in the series in his \\"Ever-Living\\" form due to the power of his Doomstaff which he also used to establish a curse where whomever utters his name besides himself is struck by lightning. But the ThunderCats destroyed his staff, forcing him into his current state as he vows revenge. Powers and abilities An absolute master of magic, Mumm-Ra possesses nearly unlimited knowledge of mystical arts from all corners of the universe. As such, he can summon their use to assist him in almost any manner he chooses. His abilities include energy manipulation, levitation, necromancy, alchemy, shapeshifting, temporal manipulation, teleportation, psychokinesis, transfiguration, mind control, astral projection, scrying, and so on. While in the form of Mumm-Ra the Ever-Living, he becomes a conduit for the Ancient Spirits of Evil; such that he can amplify his aforementioned abilities to a nearly cosmic scale, gain superhuman strength, as well as retain his undead status despite the passage of time or any injuries sustained. The price of this power however, is extremely limited stamina: once Mumm-Ra the Ever-Living has surpassed a given threshold of energy-expenditure, he must revert to his mummified form, and enter his sarcophagus to rejuvenate himself. Also, Mumm-Ra's power in his Ever-Living form is directly linked to the condition of both his sarcophagus and the Ancient Spirits' four statues within his pyramid; should any of them be harmed or destroyed, his power weakens immediately and considerably. In the 2011 show, Mumm-Ra's Ever-Living form similarly amplifies his already formidable mystic powers, while not seeming to have any definite limit as to how long he can maintain this form. Once he recovers the Gauntlet of Plun-Darr (the precursor to the Gauntlet of Omens, Lion-O's gauntlet), he is able to use a double-edged sword decorated with bat wings and a ring where the Eye of Thundera could fit. He can use the gauntlet in his Ever-Living form so as to achieve an All-Powerful form (or a form analogous to the 1980s version) which increases his power further, allowing his double-edged sword to become a dual- bladed scimitar. However, this form can only be achieved if he has two or more of the Powerstones in his possession. If his Powerstones are stripped from his gauntlet while in his All-Powerful form, Mumm-Ra reverts to his skinny, mummified self. Reception Mumm-Ra has been generally well received by the public and fans alike Viewers have noted the character for his notoriously frightening appearance and deep, raspy voice.In addition, Mumm-Ra is also praised for being much more competent than other famous cartoon villains from the 1980s; such as Skeletor of Masters of the Universe fame.

They are administered by the Universal Accreditation Board. Overview =History= The APR credential was established in 1964 as a certification program sponsored by the Public Relations Society of America (PRSA). The PRSA continued to manage the program until 1998 when the Universal Accreditation Board - consisting of approximately 25 representatives from nine major PR professional societies - was formed as part of an effort to make the credential an industry-wide, instead of organization-specific, certification. Richard Edelman is among those who called for PRSA to eliminate the APR as a requirement to hold national office in the organization. Recognizing the value of having leaders who have earned the PR industry's credential and thus demonstrate their knowledge of and commitment to the principles of the profession, members voted to retain the APR as a requirement for certain PRSA national leadership positions. The Universal Accreditation Board meets quarterly to approve recent APRs and oversee all aspects of the APR process. It regularly updates the two-step assessment process (Panel Presentation and computer-based Examination) to ensure it is assessing relevant PR knowledge, skills and abilities. In 2009, the UAB added the APR+M, an enhanced credential for military public affairs professionals. In 2014, UAB launched the Certificate in Principles of Public Relations, designed for graduating seniors to benchmark their knowledge of the field and enter the pipeline for pursuing the APR after attaining some years of professional experience. A comprehensive timeline of major events in the APRs history was compiled as part of the credential's 50th Anniversary in 2014, as well as a white paper describing its history in more detail (see External Links). =Support and criticism= The APR certification has been endorsed by some in the PR industry who feel it establishes a clear indicator of competence for those who possess it, separating \\"the contenders from the pretenders.\\" A 2005 survey found that accredited PR practitioners earn, on average, 20-percent more than those who lack accreditation. According to a 2013 study of the APR by OPG (Organizational Performance Group), all the credentials they studied required certification to serve in leadership positions, validating PRSAs decision to maintain that requirement for some of its national leadership positions. A 2003 textbook cites a survey of unaccredited PRSA members which found that 80-percent felt a sense of disenfranchisement from the organization as a result of preferences within the group given to those holding the APR. It also referenced feedback that the certification has been criticized over the low number of APR candidates who are able to successfully complete the requirements to earn the credential. However, since that time the number of practitioners earning their APR each year has increased dramatically, ranging from 80 in 2004, 222 in 2009 and 179 in 2015. Some of the participating organizations \\"rebate\\" part of the fee to their members once they pass the computer-based Examination, bringing the cost to under $300. In 2019, 19 percent of all PRSA members are APR certified. =Future= In 2013, the UAB and PRSA began an internal review on how to enhance the relevance of the APR certification. An outside consulting firm retained to study the credential recommended an overhaul that would include third-party certification of the APR by an independent certifying body such as the American National Standards Institute, increased marketing of the credential to employers and the public, strengthening of continuing education requirements, opening the certification to persons other than members of UAB affiliated organizations, and the creation of an entry-level credential. In 2014, the UAB launched a nationwide campaign celebrating the APRs 50th anniversary, and in 2016 the UAB launched a campaign to promote awareness and value of the APR, called \\"It Takes A PRo.\\" The UAB added two new participating organizations in 2016 and 2017, which expanded the pool of public relations professionals who can pursue the APR credential. Certification process =APR credential= The Accredited in Public Relations (APR) certification is designed for public relations professionals with a recommended (not required) five or more years of industry experience, and who possess an undergraduate university degree or higher. To earn the APR, candidates first must be members in good standing of a UAB member organization and submit an application with APR fee. Once the application is approved, the candidate completes a written series of questions detailing their professional background and experience. The candidate is then interviewed by a panel of three current PR practitioners who hold the APR certification, during which time a portfolio of the candidate's past work is presented and reviewed, along with the candidate's detailed questionnaire. This oral component is referred to as the \\"panel presentation\\" The final element is a computer-based Examination covering key concepts in PR planning, relationship management, communications theory, legal issues, and professional ethics. Testing is administered by Prometric. Once granted, the certification is retained for life, contingent on completion of regular continuing education activities, and current membership in a UAB member organization. U.S. Marines at the PRSA 2010 \\"Digital Impact\\" conference in New York City. Since 2010, the UAB has offered the \\"Accredited in Public Relations and Military Communications\\" certification. =APR+M credential= The Accredited in Public Relations and Military Communications (APR+M) certification is designed for members of the United States armed forces and civilian employees of the United States Department of Defense, who have a recommended (not required) five or more years of experience in public affairs, and who possess an undergraduate university degree or higher. Written submission, oral presentation, and testing requirements are essentially similar to those required for the APR, however, examiners are drawn from APR+Ms and the computer-based Examination uses a unique set of questions specific to military communications. In addition, the oral presentation (\\"panel presentation\\") is offered via telephone or video conference to military personnel who are deployed overseas. Unlike the APR, membership in a UAB member organization is not a prerequisite to earn or maintain the APR+M, however, ongoing continuing education is required to maintain the currency of the certification. =Certificate in Principles of Public Relations= Beginning in 2013, a certification called the \\"Certificate in Principles of Public Relations\\" has been offered by the UAB as an entry-level credential for those entering the PR field. The certificate is designed for university students within six months of graduating (before or after) in a degree-granting program in public relations. Candidates must have student-class membership in a UAB member organization, take a university-sponsored or online preparatory course, and pass a computer- based Examination on principles and theory of public relations. Twenty-four U.S. universities currently offer the preparatory course, with more joining every year. Universal Accreditation Board The Universal Accreditation Board, which administers the APR, APR+M, and Certificate in Principles of Public Relations, is composed of approximately 25 public relations educators and practitioners appointed by the nine major public relations professional associations: Asociaci√≥n de Relacionistas Profesionales de Puerto Rico, California Association of Public Information Officials, Florida Public Relations Association, Maine Public Relations Council, National Association of Government Communicators, National School Public Relations Association, Public Relations Society of America (PRSA), Religion Communicators Council, Southern Public Relations Federation.

It tells stories of a priest's life around the 1870s in the Goulburn area.Andrew Pike and Ross Cooper, Australian Film 1900‚Äì1977: A Guide to Feature Film Production, Melbourne: Oxford University Press, 1998, 128. Unlike many Australian silent films, a copy of it survives today. Plot A priest reads from the book of poems by John O'Brien and recalls his earlier life in the country. He remembers travelling hawkers, his first school, a bishop inspection, childhood romance, and the marriage of a girl to another man. Cast *Molly O'Donohue (or O'Donohoe) as Laughing Mary Production The movie was shot on location in the New South Wales bush, mostly at the Wollondilly River area near Goulburn, in early 1925. The director had previously worked as an assistant on While the Billy Boils (1921) and would direct The Birth of White Australia (1928). He also tried to make a film of the novel Love Blind but was unable to raise finance. Most of the cast were anonymous people who lived in the area. Unlike The Birth of White Australia, which was funded by the residents of Young, this film received no financial assistance from Goulburn. Release The film met with resistance from distributors who felt it was Roman Catholic propaganda. It was also criticised for having little plot and consisting mostly of a travelogue of scenery and incidents in the country. Other reviewers however gave it unqualified praise; it screened throughout Australia and New Zealand, made money for its backers, and created renewed interest for Hartigan's book.

Background In 1986, Ted Turner's cable-TV conglomerate acquired most of the pre-May 1986 MGM film and television library In 1988, its cable channel Turner Network Television was launched and had gained an audience with its film library. In 1991, it purchased animation studio Hanna-Barbera Productions and acquired its large library as well as most of the pre-1991 Ruby-Spears library. TBS Early programming included such Japanese animated shows as Astro Boy, Kimba the White Lion, Marine Boy, The Space Giants, and Speed Racer. By the mid-1970s, The Flintstones and many others were added to the schedule. In the 1980s, WTBS focused heavily on movies, running two during the day, and all movies after 8 p.m. with the exception of sports events. Other times, WTBS continued to run mostly classic sitcoms, and vintage cartoons. In 1986, with Ted Turner's purchase of MGM, WTBS now had the rights to the entire MGM library as well (including certain acquisitions by MGM). This gave WTBS many theatrical cartoons like Tom and Jerry. WTBS began to run The Little Rascals, Tom & Jerry, Looney Tunes/Merrie Melodies cartoons released prior to 8/1/1948, theatrical Popeye cartoons, and Three Stooges shorts under the banner Tom & Jerry and Friends between an hour and 90 minutes in the mornings and for an hour in the afternoons from 1986 to the mid-1990s. In the early 1990s, shows like The Flintstones, Scooby-Doo, The Jetsons, Looney Tunes/Merrie Melodies, and others remained on the schedule. Original animated programming such as 2 Stupid Dogs, and SWAT Kats: The Radical Squadron were added as well, as part of the Sunday Morning In Front Of The TV block. In 1996, Turner was bought by Time Warner. Among the programming changes instituted after the merger was the addition of later Looney Tunes/Merrie Melodies cartoons, released no earlier than August 1, 1948 (as previously mentioned); the change was promoted with the title of Super Looney Tunes. Also added were reruns of the WB Animation series Taz-Mania, which had recently ceased airing on Fox Kids. In response to educational program mandates, TBS added a live-action educational program, Feed Your Mind. At this point, TBS's children's programming was now under the banner of the Disaster Area.TBS Disaster Area Official Web site. Last updated 1999. TNT Up until 1998, TNT would also show cartoons from the Turner library, such as The Flintstones, Scooby-Doo, Dexter's Laboratory, The Real Adventures of Jonny Quest, among many others on a block called TNT Toons. The Rudy and Gogo World Famous Cartoon Show was also a TNT original show featuring classic Warner Bros., MGM, and Popeye shorts, hosted by marionettes and a nanny goat. TNT also aired episodes of Garfield and Friends on a separate syndication contract. They also used to have a block in 1992 during Cartoon Network's launch, titled Cartoon Network on TNT. Demise The eventual discontinuation of TNT and TBS cartoon programming was planned in mid-1992 with the debut of Cartoon Network. The first challenge for Cartoon Network was to overcome its low penetration of existing cable systems. When launched in October 1992, the channel was only carried by 233 cable systems; however, the channel benefited from package deals. New subscribers to sister stations TNT and WTBS could also get access to Cartoon Network through the relatively new practice of retransmission consent, which allows cable stations to dictate the terms of carriage on cable systems. TBS and TNT, two of the most popular cable networks of the time, arranged for deals that encouraged cable outlets to carry Cartoon Network, a move that gave the network a greater amount of leverage over competitors such as Nickelodeon. The high ratings of Cartoon Network over the following couple of years led to more cable systems including it. By the end of 1996, Cartoon Network had become \\"the fifth most popular cable channel in the United States\\".Mittell (2004), p. 80 For the first several years of Cartoon Network's existence, TBS and TNT carried Cartoon Network's original programs as part of its lineup to cross-promote the new channel. Due to restrictions on children's advertising and educational programming mandates (an issue for WTBS, which was still a terrestrial station at the time, but not for TNT), as well as the greater establishment of Cartoon Network's distribution and the industry-wide move of better cartoons to cable, WTBS and TNT both dropped all their cartoons in the fall of 1998 and moved those exclusively to Cartoon Network. By the early 2000s, most of these cartoons were once again moved to Boomerang, a commercial-free digital cable channel, although a handful of TBS and TNT-era programs remain on Cartoon Network. TBS and TNT have both since specialized their programming: TNT to drama, and TBS to situation comedy; their carrying of other programs outside those genera is mostly limited to sporting events.

It was designed by Ludvig Fenger in a Neo-Gothic style and built between 1876 and 1878. History Completed in 1856, St. John's Church in N√∏rrebro was the first church to be built in Copenhagen outside the city's Bastioned Fortifications after it was decided to decommission them and allow the city to expand. Its first pastor, Rudolf Frimodt, launched a campaign for more new churches in fast-growing new neighbourhoods which, over the course of seven years, from 1874 to 1880, led to four new churches. St. James's was the second of these churches to be completed and the first church to be built in √òsterbro. Its architect was Ludvig Fenger, who also designed St. Mathew's in Vesterbro which was completed just two years later. Construction of St. James's began in 1876 and the church was completed in 1878. The site was still relatively sparsely developed but among the buildings in the area was the Brumleby terraces, Denmark's first example of social housing, which had been built between 1854 and 1872. Architecture The church is built to a Neo- Gothic design with inspiration from English architecture. It is constructed in red brick. A relief above the main entrance depicts Saint James with a scallop shell, his emblem. St. James's today The church belongs to Church of Denmark and remains the largest church in √òsterbro. It lies a little recessed from √òsterbrogade and is today located close to Parken and √òsterbro Stadiums. The church is open to visitors every day from 9--13.

Because of the efficiency with which seismic waves propagate through the Earth and the technical difficulties of decoupling explosions to diminish their seismic radiation, forensic seismology is a critical technique in the enforcement of bans on underground nuclear testing. In addition to nuclear explosions, the signatures of many other kinds of explosions Koper, K. D., T. C. Wallace, and R. C. Aster (2003), Seismic recordings of the Carlsbad, New Mexico, pipeline explosion of 19 August 2000, Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America, 93(4), 1427-1432 can also be detected and analyzed by forensic seismology, and even other phenomena such as ocean waves (the global microseism), the movement of icebergs across the sea floor or in collision with other icebergsMartin, S., R.

Organizations with expertise in forensic seismology include AWE Blacknest, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Sandia National Laboratory, and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.  Seismic detection of nuclear detonations  Forensic Seismology is one of several other methods used by the global community to determine compliance with the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT). A network of approximately 170 seismic stations, along with data generated from sources such as infrasound, hydroacoustics, and radionuclide detection, is used to identify and locate nuclear detonations. Forensic seismology is specifically used to locate nuclear detonations that may have occurred underneath the ground. Seismic stations record underground pressure waves and transmit this data for processing via secure communication links. There are many challenges involved with trying to differentiate a nuclear explosion from other natural and man- made phenomena, such as earthquakes, mining explosions, and construction. Nuclear explosions exceeding 150 kilotons generate pressure waves that primarily travel through the Earth's core and mantle. These types of explosions are straightforward to identify because the mixture of rock the signals pass through is fairly homogeneous and the signals generated are free from noise. Smaller nuclear explosions are more difficult to identify because pressure waves primarily travel through the Earth's upper mantle and crust, leading to signal distortion due to the heterogeneity of rocks at this depth. Nations may also conduct clandestine underground tests that are not easily identifiable. One method of hiding an underground nuclear detonation is called decoupling. This involves detonating a nuclear warhead in an underground cavity in order to significantly muffle the amplitude of the subsequent underground pressure waves. Another proposed method of hiding nuclear detonations is called mine masking. This technique uses a larger explosion to mask a smaller nuclear explosion. The feasibility of mine masking has been called into question because seismic events large enough to mask a nuclear explosion are exceedingly rare and would draw suspicion. Smaller nuclear detonation yields may also be hard to detect because they produce readings similar to small earthquakes or other natural events. When seismic data is gathered, it has to be processed to produce meaningful information. Algorithms are used to isolate patterns, remove noise, and generate estimates. The development of efficient algorithms for nuclear detonation detection has led to many advancements in other fields such as kriging, an advanced method of interpolation used primarily in geostatistics. Algorithms are used to identify key characteristics of wave forms, such as peak-to-peak distance, amplitude, phase, P-wave amplitude, and S-wave amplitude. P-waves, or primary waves, are compression waves that propagate quickly through rock, and are generally the first waves to reach seismic stations. S-waves, or shear waves, arrive after P-waves. The ratio of P to S waves is one of several important values used to characterize seismic events. When a nuclear detonation has been identified, algorithms are used to estimate the detonation time, explosive yield and depth of burial.

Sihai phangrei is a long flat hill range, one of the favorite picnic spots in Ukhrul district. The hill range joins with the Shirui Peak/Shirui Kashong, home of the famous flower Shirui Lily (Lilium mackliniae) Neighboring villages of the settlements are Khamasom, Longpi, Lunghar, Shirui, Mapum and Zingsui. Population According to 2011 census, Sihai Khullen has 188 households with the total of 867 people of which 448 are male and 419 are female. Of the total population, 145 were in the age group of 0‚Äì6 years. The average sex ratio of the village is 938 female to 1000 male which is lower than the state average 985.

The literacy rate of the village stands at 51.51% which is lower than the state average 76.94%. Male literacy rate stands at 58.13% while female literacy rate was 43.88%. History The original name of the settlement is 'Saanhee' meaning 'cow's gem' in the local dialect and 'Sei-hai' in Tangkhul dialect, the common vernacular of the Tangkhul Naga tribe.'The settlement became better known as Sihai as outsiders find it hard to call the settlement by the local name. However, the neighboring villages refer to the settlements as Cow's Jewel in their respective dialects. Sihai Khullen Waterfall The origin of the name is traced back to the time of migration and settlement based on a legend believed by the settlers. According to the legend, a cow was slaughtered as sacrifice to commemorate the occasion of the settlement and that a jewel was found in the cow's bowel. The jewel found inside the cow as said by the settlers was given away to the daughter of the village chief as a marriage gift who married the son of Phungcham Chief. Phungchamis a village approximately 35 kilometers north of Ukhrul. The jewel till then was in the custody of the village chief and his predecessors for several generations. After staying together in a single location for several centuries, the original settlement got bifurcated into two, with almost half of the settlers moving further east in the 19th century. The main reason for the relocation was to occupy and cultivate more of the inherited fertile arable land that lies beyond the river. The old settlement was named Sihai Khullen/Phungcham (old settlement) and the new settlement was named Sihai Khunou/Phungdhar (new settlement). Sihai Khunou later got bifurcated into Sihai Khunou and Sihai Kahaophung. Until recently the three settlements were under one chief. Orchid in full bloom People and Occupation Agriculture is the main occupation of the settlers. The main crops grown in these settlements are rice, corn, and pulses of many varieties. Sihai Khullen is well known in Ukhrul district for cabbage cultivation and its large scale export. Sihai in general is also famous for it traditional bamboo handicrafts. Bamboo products from the village include various types of baskets locally called sopkai, pengkai, luk, ngala shung, kashai, shung, etc. Sihai is also famous in the district for uniqueness of the folk songs and folk dance.99.9% of the population are Christians. Literacy rate of the settlements is 64%. Vegetation The settlements as a whole has a rich reserve of both rare and common flora and fauna. The place is famous for the rich variety of rhododendrons that bloom in the spring season. During April and May one can see the whole spring beds covered with white and red rhododendrons, locally called as Anyii-van/Ngayawon and Koktaa- van/Kokluiwon. Sihai also is home to various varieties of orchids that blooms round the year. Fruits grown in Sihai are peach, plum, grapes, passion fruit, pear, and apple.

Biography  Descended from the German family settled in Galicia (Southern Poland) during the time of the Napoleon wars, later a part of the Austrian Habsburg Empire. He was the son of J√≥zef Herman and Petronela de domo Stefanowski. Educated in the Franz Joseph High School (so called Gymnasium at that time) in Lvov (1865‚Äì1873), than studied physics, chemistry and mathematics at the Krak√≥w University till 1878. Supplementary studies in Vienna (1879‚Äì1880). In 1879 he defended his Ph. D. thesis in Krak√≥w based on the study: On general methods of integration of the algebraic and transcendental functions (in Polish: O og√≥lnych metodach ca≈Çkowania funkcyj algebraicznych i przestƒôpnych). Since 1878 for nearly two decades was a teacher of mathematics and physics in the renowned agricultural school in Czernich√≥w near Krak√≥w. In 1897 he started his academic career at the Jagiellonian University, where he continued to work till the end of his life. At the beginning he was an extraordinary professor, than - since 1919 ‚Äì he became an ordinary professor and lecturer of the history of mathematics, physics, astronomy and physical geography, simultaneously being a Chair of the History of Exact Sciences. In 1893 he was elected the correspondent member of Krak√≥w Academy of Sciences and Letters, and in 1927 became its regular member. He was one of the organizers of the Library Commission of the Academy (1901). In 1910-1913 he held the post of the secretary of its Commission for the History of Mathematical and Natural Sciences. Since 1918 the Academy was renamed into the Polish Academy of Sciences and Letters. Birkenmajer was also the member of Scientific Society in Toru≈Ñ (Thorn) and of the International Astronomical Union in Oxford. In 1923 took significant part in the jubilee celebration of the 450 anniversary of the Copernicus birth with the series of lectures presented in Krak√≥w, Toru≈Ñ, Pozna≈Ñ and Warsaw.  Scientific output  He analyzed the Copernicus main work De revolutionibus orbium coelestium, and came to the conclusion that the Heliocentric Theory was created by Copernicus before he got acquainted with the Ptolemy Almagest. He also elaborated the biographical materials and records of the Copernicus life till 1500, as well discovered - an unknown earlier - letter of the astronomer to the king Sigismund I the Old concerning the Teutonic Order. He also studied scientific output of Marcin Bylica of Olkusz, and prepared the history of geodesy and gravimetry. Prepared the scientific edition of Tito Livio Burattini Misura universale (1897), the Practical geometry of Marcin Kr√≥l (1895), as well as the Commentariolum super theoreticas planetarum of Albert of Brudzewo (1900). Moreover in his academic interests he studied theoretical physics, astronomy, algebraic functions and geophysics. In 1883 he won the prize of the Krak√≥w Academy in geometry for solving what would (17 years) later be known as Hilbert's third problem, and later received Swedish Order of the Polar-Star, and Polish Commander Cross of the Republic of Poland (1924).  Birkenmajer family  Ludwik was the founder of the renown Polish family of scholars. He was married Zofia (Sophie), the daughter of Franciszek Karli≈Ñski, the professor of astronomy in the Jagiellonian University, and inherited his library embracing mostly the books on mathematics and physics. They had three sons: Aleksander Ludwik (historian of culture and exact sciences, and bibliologist), J√≥zef (poet, interpreter and literature historian), and Wincenty (Polish philologist, teacher and renown Tatra Mountains-climber). His grandson is Krzysztof Birkenmajer (professor of geology, member of the Polish Academy of Sciences).

The period began in 1533 and lasted until 1929. The Yaqui Wars, along with the Caste War against the Maya, were the last conflicts of the centuries long Mexican Indian Wars. Over the course of nearly 400 years, the Spanish and the Mexicans repeatedly launched military campaigns into Yaqui territory which resulted in several serious battles and massacres.Yaqui history: A Short History Wars =18th century= The cause of the conflicts was like many of the Indian Wars. In 1684, the Spanish colonists in the present day Mexican state of Sonora discovered silver in the Rio Yaqui Valley. Following this, the Spanish gradually began settling on Yaqui land, and by 1740, the natives were ready to resist. Some minor conflicts from before dated back to 1533 but in 1740 the Yaqui united with the neighboring Mayo, Opata, and Pima tribes and successfully drove the colonists out by 1742. =Juan Banderas= During the Mexican War of Independence from Spain (1810‚Äì1821) the Yaqui did not participate on either side. It was when Occidente passed a law in 1825 making the Yaqui its citizens and subjecting them to taxes that the Yaqui decided to go to war, since they had not previously been subjected to taxes. The first fighting was at Rahum. The movement was encouraged by Pedro Leyva, a Catholic priest and took the Virgin of Guadalupe as its symbol. The Yaqui coalesced around Juan Banderas as their leader. Juan Banderas was a noted Yaqui leader, who after receiving visions in 1825, attempted to unite the Yaqui and other nearby tribal groups, including the Opata, Lower Pima (Pima Bajo), and Mayo, under the banner of the Virgin of Guadalupe. Banderas successfully challenged Mexican rule in Sonora and Sinaloa between 1825 and 1832. Occidente was so affected by the war that the capital was moved from Cosala to Fuerte. In 1827 Banderas' forces were defeated by Mexicans in the vicinity of Hermosillo. This defeat was partly due to the Yaquis having primarily bows and arrows, while the Mexicans had guns. After this defeat, Banderas negotiated a peace with Occidente, in which he was granted pardon, and recognized as a captain-general of the Yaqui, and was given a salary.Edward H. Spicer, Cycles of Conquest (Tucson: University of Arizona Press, 1962) p. 60‚Äì61 In 1828 the office of captain-general was abolished, and Occidente government reasserted its right to tax the Yaqui, as well as proposing a plan for allotting the Yaqui lands. In 1832 Banderas renewed the war against the Mexican authorities, in cooperation with Dolores Guti√©rrez, a chief of the Opata people.Spicer, Cycles of Conquest, p. 62 Mexican forces captured Banderas and other Indian leaders after the defeat of Banderas' forces at the battle of Soyopa, Sonora, in December, 1832. In 1833 Banderas and Guti√©rrez, along with 10 others, were executed in January 1833. Banderas remained a powerful and admired symbol of Yaqui resistance to foreign domination. =Mid-19th century resistance= Some warriors fled from their occupied pueblos along the Rio Yaqui and continued fighting in the Sierra Vakatetteve. In 1834 Yaquis at Torim tried to drive the Mexican settlers from that location. The Mexican forces in this fighting were led by a Yaqui, Juan Ignacio Juscamea. Juscamea continued to cooperate with the Mexican government until 1840 when he was killed by anti-Mexican Yaquis in fighting at Horcasitas.Spicer, Cycles of Conquest, p. 64 During the 1830s and 1840s the Yaqui often allied with Manuel Mar√≠a G√°ndara, a former conservative governor of Sonora, in his struggle against Jos√© de Urrea for control of Sonora. In 1838 this led to Urrea capturing the coastal salt deposits of the Yaqui and transferring them to state control.Spicer, Cycles of Conquest, p. 65 In 1857 G√°ndara was removed from power by Ignacio Pesqueira. The Yaqui under the leadership of Mateo Marquin, also known as Jose Maria Barquin, were among the chief allies of G√°ndara in his attempt to regain control of Sonora. Initially most of the fighting was in the Guaymas River valley. However, in 1858 C√≥corit became a point of violence. The Mayos joined the Yaqui in waging war against the Mexican government, and destroyed Santa Cruz, Sonora. In August 1860, bands of Yaqui and Mayo insurgents, some 1,000 or 1,200 strong, marched towards Guaymas, burning and leveling Mexican settlements as they advanced. The citizens of Guaymas fortified the town, declaring a state of siege, and armed 350 men in its defense. The Prefect of Guaymas dispatched a courier to the Governor at Hermosillo, demanding additional aid. The dispatch reached Hermosillo on the 31st of August. Governor Pesquiera, with a force of sixty horse and eighty infantry, promptly left Hermosillo. He intended to travel to El Cachora to gather an additional 300 troops, but the Yaqui ambushed him and his troops en route at Jacalitos, a small village about forty-two miles from Hermosillo. The inexperienced Mexican troops fled the battle, leaving Pesquiera and General Angel Trias of Chihuahua, who accompanied Pesquiera, with some eight or ten of the body guard to face 600 well armed Yaqui. Pesquiera and Angel Trias eventually succeeded in escaping and joined the forces at El Cachora. Following this defeat, Pesqueira invaded Mayo and Yaqui territory in 1862, and forced them to accept peace terms. The peace was negotiated at Torim, Sonora. The terms of the peace allowed a pardon to the leaders of the Yaqui, but required a military post to be established at Agua Caliente, Sonora, for the Mexicans to control the actions of the Yaqui. After the French victory over Pesqueira at Guaymas in 1865, the Yaqui allied with the French in fighting the Mexicans. Mateo Marquin publicly expressed support for the French. Refugio Tenori, a leader of the Opata, also allied with the French. These native allies of the French took control of Alamos, Sonora, and drove Pesquira from his base at Ures. In 1868, with the withdrawal of the French, Pesqueira appointed pro-Mexican Yaqui to administer the Yaqui towns, but in B√°cum the Yaqui killed this official.Spicer, Cycles of Conquest, p. 66 Pesqueira then appointed Garcia Morales to lead a campaign against the Yaqui. In 1868, 600 Yaqui surrendered at C√≥corit. The Mexicans held 400 Yaqui in a church, and when they felt the Yaqui were not being cooperative enough, fired artillery on the church causing a fire that killed 120 men, women and children. This was representative of the harsh military attacks on the Yaqui, who accepted peace terms to avoid continued massacres.Spicer, Cycles of Conquest, p. 67 Affairs such as this drove many of the natives to emigrate, while others were deported by the Mexicans or enslaved.A Short History of the Yaqui Indians by Edith te Wechel =Cajem√©= In 1874 Pesqueira appointed Cajem√© as alcalde-mayor of all the towns of both the Yaqui and Mayo. Jos√© J. Pesqueira, son of the current governor, was designated successor to the governor. This caused an attempt to violently appoint a new governor, which Pesqueira reacted to by attacking Cajem√© and his people. From Medano, Pesqueira attacked a large number of Yaqui residents, killing Yaqui just because they were present, and pillaging their farms and ranches.Spicer, Cycles of Conquest, p. 68 In 1876 the Yaqui leader Jos√© Maria Leyba Peres, or Cajem√©, established a small independent republic in Sonora. By then there were only about 4,000 undefeated Yaqui, and they attempted to defend their county by building the fortification called El A√±il (The Indigo). El A√±il was located near the village of V√≠cam, in the middle of a thick forest and on the left bank of the Yaqui river. The fortification consisted of a wide moat. Food and livestock were stockpiled within the fortification, and to assure a source of water, there was a large trench to the river. There was also a wooden stockade with walls made of thick trunks of trees placed side by side, and woven with branches providing an enclosure where the 4000 Yaqui people were protected.Troncoso (Francisco de Borja del Paso y Troncoso), pp. 117-124 Agustin Ortiz, whose brother Carlos was then the governor of Sonora, led an attack from Navojoa to Capetemaya in 1882, with the intention of capturing Cajem√©. Cajem√© was wounded in the Battle of Capetemaya, but the forces of Ortiz were routed. Fighting in the Mayo territories continued until 1884 when they agreed submitted to Mexican authority. However, Cajem√© continued to insist on his independence. In 1885 Loreto Molino, a Yaqui who had previously been one of Cajem√©'s chief lieutenants or teniente-general, led a raid from Guaymas against Cajem√©'s home. The house was burned down, but Cajem√© was in the south at the time and thus survived the attack.Spicer, Cycles of Conquest, p. 71 The repercussions of this raid, which was sanctioned by the local Mexican government, led to a resumption of full-scale war between the Yaqui and the Mexican government. In March 1886, three columns, each about 1,200 strong, were set in motion against the Yaquis. Every Mexican town or point of importance was fortified and garrisoned to resist any hostile Yaqui forces. The mitrailleuse is reported to have been used by the Mexican Federal Forces against the well organized Yaqui forces. Three of them were used, with two mitrailleuse under the command of the forces of Generals Leiva and Marcos Carillo, and one under the command of General CamanoH. H. Bancroft, History of Mexico, Vol. VI, p. 462. (The History Company, San Francisco, 1888) In May, 1886, the Mexican army began a concentrated series of military campaigns against the main Yaqui fortress of El A√±il. General Carrillo, with 1,200 soldiers, initially attacked El A√±il in a fierce battle to dislodge the indigenous Yaqui forces. General √Ångel Mart√≠nez brought up an additional 1,500 Mexican soldiers, and concentrated his forces to finish the campaign with a decisive blow. El A√±il was captured on May 12, 1886. Only a few Yaqui soldiers escaped by fleeing deep into the mountains, leaving 200 dead, and some 2,000 people, consisting primarily of the elderly, children, and the sick. The losses of the Mexican forces were 10 officers and 59 troops.Troncoso, pp.124-129 Following the battle, the people living in the villages of Huiviris, Potam, Bacum, C√≥corit were amnestied by the Mexican government, in return for giving up their weapons. In return, the people in the villages were given clothes and food. The bulk of the remaining Yaqui soldiers were now unable to make war directly on Mexican military forces, so hid in the mountains, while being persecuted and systematically decimated. At this point, Cajem√© sent a note to General Juan Hern√°ndez saying\\" > \\"Desde luego nos someteremos todos a la obediencia del gobierno, bajo la > condici√≥n de que dentro de 15 d√≠as se retiren todas sus fuerzas que est√°n en > el r√≠o Yaqui para Guaymas y Hermosillo, de no hacerlo as√≠, pueden ustedes > obrar de manera que les convenga; yo, en uni√≥n de mi naci√≥n, estoy dispuesto > a hacer hasta la √∫ltima defensa.\\" > \\"We will all submit in obedience to government, under the condition that > within 15 days [the government will] withdraw all their forces at the Rio > Yaqui to Guaymas and Hermosillo. Failing to do so, you can act in a way that > suits them [the government]. I, together with my nation, am willing to > continue [fighting] until the last defense.\\" Nearly one year later, Cajem√© was captured in the village of San Jos√© de Guaymas, about 10 miles outside of the Port of Guaymas. Cajem√© was eventually transported to the mouth of the Yaqui River, and paraded through many of the Yaqui villages to show that he had been captured. On April 23, 1887, Cajem√© was executed at Tres Cruces de Chumampaco. Juan Maldonado took Cajem√©'s place, and continued a guerrilla war in the Sierra del Bacatete. The Yaqui towns along the Rio Yaqui became mostly deserted, with many of the inhabitants fleeing into the surrounding mountains, and to other states in Mexico, including Chihuahua and Sinaloa. =Yaqui Uprising, 1896= In February 1896 an event known as the Yaqui Uprising began after the Mexican revolutionary Lauro Aguirre drafted a plan to overthrow the government of Porfirio D√≠az. Aguirre and his men were able to convince several Yaqui and Pima natives to join in the revolt so on August 12 a combined force of no less than seventy men attacked the customs house at Nogales, Sonora. A battle then ensued which left at least three people dead and many more wounded. During the fight a group of American militia formed in the adjoining town of Nogales, Arizona and they assisted the Mexican defenders in repelling the rebels' attack. Ultimately the Yaquis and the others were obliged to withdraw from the area, ending the uprising and leading to a United States Army operation to track the hostiles. Two companies of the 24th Infantry Regiment were assigned to hunt the rebels who were being pursued by troops of the Mexican Army Colonel Emilio Kosterlitsky. However, the rebels got away, some escaped to Arizona. In 1897 a peace treaty was signed in Ortiz between the Yaquis and the Mexican government but in 1899 another serious outbreak of hostilities began and it led to the bloody Mazocoba Massacre of 1900, in which several hundred natives were killed.Garcia, pg. 173-176Ruiz, pg. 97-117URREA, TERESA  The Handbook of Texas Online Texas State Historical Association (TSHA)Johnson, pg. 664‚Äì665Garza, pg. 40‚Äì41Huachuca Illustrated, vol 1, 1993: Fort Huachuca: The Traditional Home of the Buffalo Soldier Manuel Balb√°s wrote in Recuerdos del Yaqui how some Yaqui's at Mazocoba survived combat, but chose to take their own life, either with their own weapons, or by throwing themselves from the cliffs rather than surrender to the enemy. One event in which a young woman who had been hiding but was discovered, without a tear in her eyes, \\"approached the body of her loved one, knelt a moment, bowed slightly, and perhaps for a last time looked at the face of the beloved, and arose at once, quickly running like a gazelle toward the precipice, and without a moment's hesitation , plunged into the abyss.\\"Manuel Balb√°s, Recuerdos del Yaqui: Principales Episodios Durante la Campa√±a de 1899 a 1901 (Mexico City: Sociedad de Edition y Liberia Franco Americana, 1927) p. 58 It was at this point in time, in the late 1890s and early years of the 1900s, that a large number of Yaqui people began traveling north to settle in the United States around Tucson and Phoenix, Arizona, and into parts of Texas, including the El Paso area, as well as the Lubbock area, where a group of Yaqui refugees had settled years earlier. =Later developments= a group of Yaqui Indians at the surrender and signing of peace treaty at Ortiz, Mexico, ca.1910. Two Mexicans stand near three Indians in the foreground. Around this time Porfirio D√≠az began advocating for a solution to the Yaqui wars. By 1903 the decision was made to deport both the peaceful and rebellious Yaqui natives to the Yucatan and Oaxaca. Meanwhile, from 1904 to 1909, the Mexican governor of Sonora, Rafael Iz√°bal, led \\"organized manhunts\\" in which about 8,000 to 15,000 Yaquis were taken prisoner and \\"virtually enslaved\\". 15,000 to 60,000 Yaquis perished in deportations in 1900 through 1911. Following the outbreak of the Mexican Revolution in 1910, Yaqui warriors joined all of the armies of the major rebel factions. They also began resettling their ancestral lands along the Rio Yaqui. In 1911, D√≠az was exiled and President Francisco Madero took office. He is said to have promised the Yaqui people compensation for their losses but by 1920, when the main phase of the war ended, the promises were forgotten. By 1916, Mexican generals, such as √Ålvaro Obreg√≥n, began establishing estates on Yaqui land during the revolution and this led to renewed hostilities between the natives and the military. It was during this period of the conflict that the United States Army fought the last battle of the American Indian Wars. In January 1918, a small group of about thirty natives were intercepted by Buffalo Soldiers of the 10th Cavalry, just across the international border, near Arivaca, Arizona. In the thirty- minute skirmish that followed, the Yaqui commander was killed and a handful of others were taken prisoner. The last major engagement of the Yaqui Wars came almost ten years later in what is called \\"The Yaqui Revolt of 1926-1928.\\" The battle began in April 1927 at Cerro del Gallo (Hill of the Rooster. Yaqui name: Totoi-ta-kuse'epo). On April 28, 1927, the Los Angeles Times reported that Mexican Federal Troops had captured 415 Yaquis, including 26 men, 214 women, and 175 children. It was reported in the Mexican newspaper El Universal that because the Yaqui had withdrawn in the mountains, the Mexican Federal Staff had decided to undertake a major offensive against them. Operations would be directed by General Obreg√≥n, assisted by the General Manzo.El Universal, September 28, 1927 According to another report published on October 5, 1927, 12,000 \\"federales\\" were soon to present in the state of Sonora, equipped with 8mm machine guns, airplanes and poison gas.El Universal, October 05, 1927 On October 2, 1927, the Los Angeles Times reported that General Francisco R. Manzo, Commander of the federal forces in Sonora, had informed President Calles that he expected the Yaqui chieftain, Luis Matius, would soon surrender after holding out in the Bacatete Mountains for more than a year.\\"Surrender Due in Yaqui Strife: Leader Expected to Accept Mexican Terms Today,\\" Los Angeles Times, October 2, 1927. After that, some minor warfare continued into 1929 but the violence was quelled mainly by bombings from the Mexican Air Force. The Mexican Army also established posts at all of the Yaqui settlements. This action prevented future conflict. Gallery File:Cajeme2.jpgThe Yaqui warrior Cajem√© in April 1887, taken at the time of his arrest by Mexican authorities.

Founded in 2008, the GRDL has two teams that compete in the league and a combined team that competes in interleague bouts. They support both men and women in the league, but their current competitive teams are women only. History The Geelong Roller Derby League was founded in March 2008, and by 31 October of that year they were able to present their first bout. This first event was for family and friends only, and featured the Frankenskaters and the Bloody Marys ‚Äì the latter of which was the origin of the name of their current interleague team. Their first public match was held just over a month later, on 6 December 2008, in which the Death Leopards competed against the Black Sadists. The GRDL's first interleague bout was held the following year, in March 2009. They competed against the Victorian Roller Derby League's B team, \\"New Breed\\", followed by a rematch in May. The GRDL grew quickly, and by October that year they had over 40 members and were able to field two official teams: the Atom Bombs and the Psychotics. Their first full season was also held in 2009, taking place at Bell Post Hill Leisuretime Centre where they had relocated from their original venue, with the Psychotics dominating the series over the Atom Bombs. 2010 saw their second full season, in which the Atom Bombs reversed the results of the previous year, winning undefeated. 2010 also saw the Great Southern Slam hosted by Adelaide Roller Derby, the largest roller derby competition held outside of the United States. The \\"Maulrats\\", a combined team consisting of members of the Ballarat Roller Derby League and the GRDL, made it into the second day of the competition. Recently, the Geelong Roller Derby League travel team, the Bloody Marys, took second place in the inaugural Vic/Tas Tournament, a two-state tournament featuring some 16 teams from each state, losing to the Victorian Roller Derby League's Queen Bees.

The national treasure also includes items that are valuable in terms of history and Thai artistic features. The treasures include regalia, royal decorations, ornaments and Thai coins. These treasures are currently in the custody of the Bureau of Grand National Treasure, The Treasury Department. The national treasures are restored, conserved and displayed for the general public at the Pavilion of Regalia, Royal Decorations and Coins in the Royal Grand Palace. Royal Regalia The Royal Regalia of Siam Regalia symbolize prestige and rank and were also rewards for good services. It was an ancient tradition that the King bestowed regalia on members of the royal family, courtiers and officials, according to their rank and status. The recipients would display regalia during important royal ceremonies and on special occasions. The bestowing of regalia was later revised after the royal decorations were established during the Bangkok period to signify rank and prestige. The regalia was then bestowed only on high- ranking members of the royal family as symbols of their status and as components of the Chulachom Klao decorations. Types of Regalia are classified into seven categories: 1\\\\. Regalia for prosperity This type of regalia was bestowed for prosperity as well as for the purpose of reminding the recipients to perform their duties with righteousness and prudence. The Regalia for Prosperity includes items such as the Ceremonial Gold Chain, the amulet chain, the 108 gold beaded rosary and nine gems ring. 2\\\\. Headgear Headgear was conferred only to members of the royal family and high-ranking couriers. Headgear includes items such as the Royal Crown and Pointed Crown (for bestowing on the King‚Äôs sons), various types of decorated hats, namely\\"Phra Mala Sao Soong\\" (for bestowing on royal children of Chao Fah title), The ‚ÄúSao Satern Hat‚Äù (for male courtiers with the Chao Phraya title), and ‚ÄúSong Prabhas Hat‚Äù (for officials of the equivalent rank to a town governor). 3\\\\. Attires Attire was presented to those who performed duties as the King‚Äôs representatives as well as to those who served well in war. There are different types of garments, such as blouses, robes, gowns and trousers. 4\\\\. Weapons of rank Weapons of rank were presented to male courtiers and male officials for exploits in war. These Weapons of rank are considered to be the highest honor given to recipients. They include items such as swords, daggers, long handled swords, lances and guns. 5\\\\. Royal Paraphernalia Set The Royal Paraphernalia Set is made up of personal utensils of the monarch for daily use which were bestowed on members of the royal family, courtiers and officials, both male and female. The Royal Paraphernalia Set includes items such as betel nut tray sets, betel nut boxes, spittoons, cylindrical kettles and water pitchers. 6\\\\. Umbrellas of state, sunshades, fans and flags These items were presented for use as symbols of the recipient‚Äôs rank during important ceremonies. There are various kinds of umbrellas, including Chatra, Klod, Suppathon, and Kanching, sunshades (called ‚ÄúBangsoon‚Äù and ‚ÄúBangsaek‚Äù), a whip of yak hair (‚ÄúChamorn‚Äù), a palm leaf fan (called ‚ÄúPhatbok‚Äù), and flags. 7\\\\. Vehicles Vehicles were presented to royalty and noblemen for their convenience and to signify their rank. These vehicles included a stretcher (called ‚ÄúSalieng‚Äù), a palanquin (called ‚ÄúKrae Kanya‚Äù), and a barge (called ‚ÄúRua Kanya‚Äù). Royal Decorations 120px King Mongkut of the present Chakri dynasty created the ‚ÄúDara Irapot‚Äù or the ‚ÄúThree ‚Äì headed Elephant Star‚Äù to be adorned on his attire pursuant of the European custom. In the following years, the ‚ÄúDara Noparat‚Äù or the Star of Nine Gems was created to be bestowed upon members of the royal family. Other ‚ÄúDara‚Äù were also created by royal command such as ‚ÄùThe White Elephant Star‚Äù to be presented to officials and foreigners as a reward for their good service. The Chochasi and Rajasi Stars were bestowed on the Ministers of Defense and Interior respectively. The tradition of creation and bestowal of the royal decorations has since been a legacy transmitted from every reign until the present. Although the origins of royal Thai decoration are not in current usage, their significance have been immersed into and become part of the nation‚Äôs heritage. Ornaments Ornaments are used by members of the royal family and courtiers during various auspicious ceremonies. Their design and the metal used differ according to the rank of the recipient. The items includes bracelets, gold chains, chest-piece decorations, rings decorated with gems, gold belts and buckles and upper arm decorations. Thai Coins Siam pottery tokens The evolution of Thai Coins began with the flat, round coins of the Funan Kingdom which occupied the areas which is now Thailand around the 1st ‚Äì 6th centuries A.D. The early coins of Thailand represented the influence of India and China. It was not until the middle of the 13th century when indigenous Thai money was first introduced when the people of Sukhothai created their own money for use in the kingdom. The money, which is commonly called ‚ÄúPod Duang‚Äù by the Thais, or is better known by foreigners as ‚ÄúBullet money‚Äù, had been a dominant currency in the Thai monetary system for more than 600 years before being replaced by flat modern coins in 1904.

It is housed in the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna, Austria. History The work is mentioned by Late Renaissance art biographer Giorgio Vasari, who lists it as one of three small-size paintings that the artist brought to Rome with him in 1525. Vasari relays that the self- portrait was created by Parmigianino as an example to showcase his talent to potential customers. The portrait was donated to pope Clement VII, and later to writer Pietro Aretino, in whose house Vasari himself, then still a child, saw it. It was later acquired by Vicentine sculptor Valerio Belli and, after his death in 1546, by his son Elio. Through the intercession of Andrea Palladio, in 1560 the work went to Venetian sculptor Alessandro Vittoria, who bequeathed it to emperor Rudolf II. It arrived in Prague in 1608, and later it became part of the Habsburg imperial collections in Vienna (1777), although attributed to Correggio. Description The painting depicts the young artist (then twenty one) in the middle of a room, distorted by the use of a convex mirror. The hand in the foreground is greatly elongated and distorted by the mirror. The work was painted on a specially-prepared convex panel in order to mimic the curve of the mirror used.

The confluence point of the Nag and Pioli rivers is near Pawangaon, the confluence point of Nag and Pora river is near Titur, and the confluence point of Nag and Kanhan River is near Sawangi village. In November 2015, various efforts have been made to restore the river to the city's heritage list from which it was removed in 2001. The river serves as drainage for Nagpur and as a result its ecosystem is heavily polluted by urban waste from the city Rejuvenation and Beautification The Nag River Rejuvenation was cleared by National River Conservation Directorate in November 2019 at the cost of Rs 2434 crores. This cost was escalated from an earlier estimate of 1476.96 crores. This was because of delay in approvals and inclusion of the Goods and Service Tax. Share of Centre in the project is 60%, 25% of state and remaining 15% of NMC. Japan International Cooperation Agency is expected to approve long term loan for shares of Centre and State, which they will repay. NMC will only have to contribute its share of 15%. The project also covers rejuvenation of Pioli River along with Nag river and is estimated to take four years to complete. the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) is also preparing Nag Riverfront Development Project of Rs1,600 crore.

Here are listed the sole archdeacons of Durham diocese, then those of the senior of two unnamed lines, then all those called Archdeacon of Durham. The archdeaconry has been split twice: once on 23 May 1882, to create the Auckland archdeaconry after the Diocese of Newcastle was created from the diocese's other two archdeaconries and a second time in 1997, to create the Sunderland archdeaconry.

Born in the Melbourne suburb of Box Hill, She is the youngest of three children. She was part of the Australia women's national wheelchair basketball team (Gliders) at four Paralympics: the 1992 Barcelona, 1996 Atlanta, 2000 Sydney, and 2004 Athens games. She was a member of the Gliders team that won silver medals in 2000 and 2004. She competed as Paula Lohman at the 1992 Games and at the 1996 Games she competed as Paula Ewen. She has two sons James and Jacob. She was the domestic partner of wheelchair basketballer Sandy Blythe for eight years until his suicide in 2005. After his death, she took up a directorship for the Blythe-Sanderson Group. In 1987, Coghlan was a passenger in a car accident where the driver dozed off behind the wheel. The car was flipped onto its roof, and her foot got trapped outside the car. After an attempt to try and rebuild most of her leg through plastic surgery, Coghlan eventually made the decision to amputate below her knee. A wheelchair rugby player called John Kinnery, who was a quadriplegic, encouraged Coghlan to play wheelchair basketball even though she did not use a wheelchair. Coghlan did not want to participate in a sport that required her to get into a wheelchair. But after attending a wheelchair basketball game and jumping in to have a go, she fell in love with it. Coghlan said 'I just fell in love with it and never looked back. I never stopped playing from that... I was hooked'. The competitive nature of the sport lured Coghlan into playing, as well as being on a level playing field again. At the time she started playing wheelchair basketball, no women's team existed in Victoria. Coghlan had begun playing with the men, with players such as Kevin Coombs and Sandy Blythe. Coghlan approached Wheelchair Sports Victoria to create a team for the Women's National League. To qualify for the 1992 Barcelona Games, the Australian team had to travel to Stoke Mandeville in England to qualify. The qualifying tournament required the team to beat France and Japan. The national team managed to win the tournament, and they qualified for the Games. At the Barcelona Games, the Gliders finished fourth. One particular sporting highlight for Coghlan was wearing the green and gold at the 1992 Barcelona Games because it was the first time Australia would be represented in women's wheelchair basketball. Coghlan left the Australian team after the 1992 Games to have her son, James. In 1995, the coach for the Gliders, Peter Corr, asked her to come back and play in the 1996 Games in Atlanta. At the Atlanta Games the Gliders placed fourth. At the 1997 World Championships, the Gliders won a bronze medal. The Sydney 2000 Games was a major turning point for paralympic sport. There was a stronger connection between the paralympic athletes and the able-bodied athletes, and Coghlan's public profile had increased. The Gliders had been undefeated and had reached the gold medal play off against Canada, but they were defeated. Coghlan was the Gliders team captain at the 2004 Games. She was also given the female captain role for the whole Paralympic team.

His father is presumed to be Edward Holl, a stonemason from Beccles in Suffolk, who died in January 1816. Career Edward Holl became an architect in the Navy Board for the Royal Navy in 1804; the second architect employed after Samuel Bunce. He was employed by Brigadier General Sir Samuel Bentham (Inspector General of Naval Works). Chatham Dockyard Church, designed by Edward Holl The Admiralty agreed to the construction of a chapel in Chatham, England in November 1805. Designed by Holl, and built by dock craftsmen, it was completed in 1810. In 1806 in Chatham Dockyard, Holl designed the No. 1 Smithery which featured three ranges around an open courtyard. Holl supervised William Pilkington who designed and built the Naval Hospital at Great Yarmouth between 1809 and 1811. The Inspector General's department was abolished in 1812, resulting in Holl being directly employed by the Navy Board. He assumed a new role, Surveyor of Buildings, which was used during the extensive re-building of the Navy's fleet bases at Portsmouth and Plymouth Dock (Devonport), England. He re-designed the East Ropery building, formerly the spinning house, in Devonport, England. Originally constructed between 1763‚Äì71, it had been gutted by fire in 1812. Despite being damaged during World War II, the East Ropery is the only Holl- designed building remaining in the dockyard today. A new chapel at Plymouth was built in 1814 based on Holl's original designs from 1797. The chapel was destroyed during World War II. In 1815, he drew up plans with John Rennie for Pembroke Dockyard in Wales. The dock included a row of shipbuilding slips, a dry dock, and a single line of buildings including storehouses, offices, kilns, a mould loft, and a pitch house. Various other structures in Pembroke Dockyard were constructed during later years, including the following: the entrance gates and lodges (1817); several terraces of houses (1817‚Äì1818); the fleet surgeon's house, the Sunderland House, and the Old Storehouse (all 1822); and the Captain Superintendent's house (1832‚Äì1834), later used as a hotel. Between 1815 and 1817, the School of Naval Architecture at Portsmouth was designed and built according to Holl's designs. The school closed in 1932. Also in 1817, the Navy Board authorised a lead and paint mill at Chatham. Holl designed a fireproof structure with cast-iron pillars, iron beams, yorkstone paving for the floors, and a brick exterior. Bermuda Royal Naval Hospital was built in 1818 according to the original designs of Holl and John Rennie. Used initially as a quarantine unit, it was later used to treat convicts who were re-building the dockyard. The hospital featured a cast-iron frame and locally sourced limestone stonework. The Royal Navy appointed the surgeon, doctors and medical staff. The hospital was used during World War II to treat many wounded sailors brought in from vessels damaged by torpedoes. The Royal Navy left Bermuda in the 1950s, and the hospital was demolished in 1972. In 1820, several barracks in the Caribbean (such as those in Barbados, Bermuda, Antigua and St Lucia and St Vincent) were designed by Colonel Sir Charles Smith using Holl's designs. Commissioner's House in Bermuda, designed by Edward Holl Bermuda Dockyard was also designed by Holl and included the Commissioner's House. Many of the materials used were pre-fabricated in London and then transported to Bermuda, saving labour and material costs for the project. Featuring iron as its main structural material, the house was later completed by George Ledwell Taylor. Edward Holl died in Chelsea, England in December 1823. Inside Chelsea Old Church, there is a memorial to \\"EDWARD HOLL, 1823\\". Between 1824‚Äì1829, a large storehouse building based on Holl's designs was built at Sheerness Dockyard. The storehouse was constructed with thick, stone brick walls supporting an iron frame and stone floors, and featured a granite entrance leading to a large quadrangle of four-storied ranges. The storehouse was demolished in 1980. Major works *1804‚Äì1824 Chatham Dockyard Offices; Chatham Dockyard Chapel; sawmills (with M.I.

Biography Doni was born at Assisi. While is said by Lanzi and others to have been a disciple of Pietro Perugino,The History of Painting in Italy: The schools of Rome and Naples (1828), By Luigi Lanzi, page 40 the first we know of him was that in 1530 he was an assistant to Giovanni di Pietro (lo Spagna) at San Giacomo in Spoleto.Key to Umbria biography. In the church of San Francesco, at Perugia, is a picture by this master of the 'Last Judgment;' and one of the 'Adoration of the Kings' is in San Pietro in the same city.

Pier Maria III de' Rossi (1504 - 15 August 1547) was an Italian general and nobleman, the second marquess and seventh count of San Secondo. Biography Born at San Secondo Parmense, he was a member of the local Rossi noble family, the son of Troilo I de' Rossi and Bianca Riario, the first daughter of Caterina Sforza and the half-sister of Giovanni delle Bande Nere. He was also the brother to bishop Giovangirolamo de' Rossi. He was educated at the Medici court together with his uncle Giovanni, who had nearly the same age. At his father's death (1521), he inherited the family lands as count of San Secondo. In 1523 he married Camilla Gonzaga, who brought a dowry of 6,000 ducati, jewels, furniture and other assets. After a first sojourn in France, Pier Maria returned to Italy and here he defended the family fiefs alongside his uncle. During the siege of Florence (1529-1530), he commanded a corps of the imperial troops. Under the service of emperor Charles V, he was at Tunis in 1535, in Provence in 1536 and in Albania in 1537: in reward, he obtained an imperial privilege which granted his lands the independence from the nearby Parma. In those years he was portrayed by the local painter Parmigianino, who perhaps also depicted his wife. Both paintings are now at the Museo del Prado in Madrid. In 1542 he entered the service of king Francis I of France, who named him general and knight of the Order of St. Michael. He also held a correspondence with humanist Pietro Aretino.

The first two instars feed on the back of leaves, from the leaf margin and veins and then move to another leaf. The third instar larvae aggregate on the trunk, produce silk and become ball- shaped. They are reddish brown, with a dorsolateral white streak. Mature larvae pupate in a cocoon spun on branches or fallen leaves, or underground. The pupa is reddish brown, rough and rugose.Immature Stages of Four Bombycidae Species of Taiwan Gallery Image:Andraca_theae_eggs.JPGEggs Image:Andraca theae eggs1.JPGEggs Image:Andraca_theae_larvae.JPGFirst instar larvae Image:Andraca_theae_larvae1.JPGThird instar larvae Image:Andraca_theae_larvae2.JPGFinal instar larvae Image:Andraca_theae_larvae3.JPGFinal instar larvae Image:Andraca_theae_pupa.JPGPupa Image:Andraca theae cocoon.JPGCocoon References Category:Moths described in 1909 Category:Andraca ","title":"Andraca theae"},{"id":"33031111","title":"List of the largest trading partners of the European Union"},{"id":"33031121","text":"Night time view of Adam's fountain Adam's fountain is a public display fountain in Charring cross, Ooty. It was built in 1886 as a memorial to a Governor of Ooty, who was very famous in the region during his tenure. The total cost of finishing the fountain was between Rs. 13,000 to Rs. 14000, which was funded through public funding. History Adam's fountain Night time view of Adam's fountain The fountain was originally planned to be placed near the Ooty market. But it was decided later that the site in front of the District collector's office in Ooty was a better place as it had higher number of passers by. After building the fountain, it was discovered that the site did not have the necessary water head for the fountain to function properly. It was finally moved to its present location in Charring cross in 1898. An old melanoxylon tree which stood in the site of the present location of the fountain, which was considered as a landmark in Charring cross was removed for the construction of the fountain. Tourist attraction As the fountain is located in one of the most important and beautiful places in Ooty, it is an important tourist landmark in the Ooty town.

Personal Adams was born in Perth on 11 July 1966. As a child, Adams thought that she could perhaps be an Olympic gymnast. From the age of five to seventeen, Adams was involved with competitive gymnastics. During this period, she would often train for over thirty hours a week. While attending university, she worked in gymnastics as a designer of routines for other gymnasts, which could be video taped and compared against national standards. It was while practising routines she had done before that she injured herself falling on her neck, and severed her spinal cord after landing on her back. While she was in the hospital following her accident, she was approached by a wheelchair basketball player. The sport administrator knew of her background in competitive athletics and recruited her to play wheelchair basketball. She was not initially interested in participating in the sport, but her physiotherapy program required her to play. After playing the sport for the first time, she fell in love with it and decided to pursue it on a more competitive level. Competitive career =Wheelchair basketball national team= 1996 Atlanta Paralympics Adams shoots the ball during competition at the 2000 Sydney Paralympics Adams competed in the Australian women's national wheelchair basketball team's first international tournament, which took place in St. Ettienne, France in 1990, and Australia finished in sixth place. She participated in the training camp for the women's team in preparation for the 1992 Barcelona Paralympics but did not make the final selection. This disillusioned her and she did not compete in the sport for several years. She was selected for the 1996 Atlanta Games squad and moved from Western Australia to Melbourne to be on the national team. Between 1996 and 2000, the government increased funding for Australian Paralympic athletes. Before this period, Adams and other Paralympians were largely paying their own way to compete, such as the case with Adams paying her own way to compete in France. Getting compensation from government funding of sport organisations meant that she could spend more time working on improving her sporting performance. In the eight months before the 2000 Summer Paralympics, she could be an athlete full- time. She was part of the national squad that beat Canada in a June 2000 tournament. The victory against the Canadians was the first time Canada had lost a game in a tournament in ten years. She was part of the silver medal winning Australia women's national wheelchair basketball team at the 2000 Summer Paralympics. =Women‚Äôs National Wheelchair Basketball League= She was named as one of the Women‚Äôs National Wheelchair Basketball League's All Star Five in 2001, 2002 and 2003 as a member of the Victorian Wheelies. In 2008, she was competing for the Western Stars. Recognition In 2000, she was given a special medallion by Victoria's Premier Steve Bracks and Community Services Minister Christine Campbell in recognition for her performance at the 2000 Paralympics.

Knit 2 Together involves a series of knitting circles/local history sessions hosted by Stellar Quines in partnership with Heart of Hawick. Playwright Sylvia Dow will use the project as the inspiration for a new play which celebrates women, knitting and Scotland's social history. The play will be given a rehearsed reading in Hawick in October 2013, as part of the Luminate festival. All Our Stories, a brand new small grant programme, was launched in support of BBC Two's The Great British Story and was designed as an opportunity for everyone to get involved in their heritage. Research Digital Development Stellar Quines conducts research into the ways digital technology may be used to enhance the work of the company, with the three main areas of research development being artistic, audience and business. Artistic development focuses on the ways in which digital technology may be used to enhance the creation of live theatre; audience development explores how company can extend its reach and engagement with new and current audiences; business development exploring new business models, with the aim of extending the life of live performances and delivering work in new ways. To date this work has involved a number of projects and experiments, including live streaming and 3D theatre. Gender in Scottish Theatre In 2010, Stellar Quines undertook a research project, funded by the Scottish Arts Council Equalities Department, to provide the basis for Stellar Quines to test its purpose as a company, and refocus its vision for the future. Phase One of the project was a piece of desk-based research, reviewing secondary data related to gender in the performing arts, to build an opinion based picture of women in theatre. The output of a series of Scottish building-based and touring companies in 1993 (the year Stellar Quines was founded) and 2009 (the last full Scottish theatre season before the research was commissioned) was assessed. The study of two Scottish theatre seasons 18 years apart explored to what extent women were represented as directors, writers, actors, lighting, set and costume designers, and composers/musical directors. Phase Two involved consultations with, and a survey of, a wide range of individuals from the Scottish theatre world. Individuals, groups and organisations who had a relationship with the company, or were relevant to the company's work, were surveyed - as well as those who had no existing relationship with the company but showed an interest in the future development of women in Scottish theatre. Stellar Quines then reviewed the results from both phases of research, before adding its own observations.

While working upon the Primal Love (–ù–∞—á–∞–ª—å–Ω–∞—è –ª—é–±–æ–≤—å) compilation, Bunin changed the story's title into \\"Meliton\\" (after its main character's first name). In its final version the novella appeared in the July 6, 1930, No.3392 issue of the Paris-based Poslednye Novosti newspaper.The Works by I.A. Bunin. Vol.II. Stories and novelets, 1892-1909. Khudozhestvennaya Literatura. Moscow, 1965. Commentaries, pp.509-511.  History  \\"Skete\\" was the first piece of prose Ivan Bunin published in the Journal for Everyone magazine, where his poetry was appearing regularly since 1898. Upon receiving the text, the magazine's editor Viktor Mirolyubov wrote in a letter dated May 29, 1901: \\"Thank you very much, dear Ivan Alekseevich, for \\"Skete\\". I liked it a lot... Whenever you put just one living person into this artistic frame of nature pictures, the nature itself gets so much livelier.\\" Bunin replied: \\"I am glad you liked \\"Skete\\". As for the pictures of nature which, as far as I can see, you seem to feel I am too much devoted to, this is not exactly the case, for I never depict 'naked' nature, in a protocol way, as it were. What I am concerned with is beauty, no matter what this beauty is attributed to; or, alternatively, what I try to do is transport the reader part of my soul with these [pictures of] nature...\\"Literary Archive, Issue No.5, Moscow-Leningrad, 1960, —Ä.132. = Missing parts = The final part of the story suffered from censorship. In early July 1901 Bunin enquired in a letter to Mirolyubov: \\"I haven't found the final three lines in [the publication of] \\"Skete\\". Besides, the word –≤—ã–ø—É–∫–ª–æ (bulgingly) is missing (when it comes to the rooster bit).Literary Archive, —Ä.139. Mirolyubov replied: \\"The last three lines from \\"Skete\\" have been dropped by the censors for some reason ( was responsible). As for the word 'bulgingly', I pity for it more than you even, if you only knew how I fought it for.\\" In all the next versions Bunin reinstated the missing word, but not the three lines that had been crossed out by censor. What exactly they were remained unknown for not a single manuscript or a proof-reader's copy of the story survived. All through his later years Bunin, rather than reinstating the censure-dropped bits, was busy stripping his prose of details he deemed superfluous. Modern researchers (Oleg Mikhailov among them) point to the fact that in emigration, while preparing his earlier works for new publications, he was cutting off fragments dealing with political and social context of the times those stories were written in, aiming apparently at erasing the 'period' aspect of them and going for more universal, time-unrelated appeal. Meliton provides a telling example of this. In 1930 Bunin extracted from the story half a page of the original text, relating to the young protagonist's telling how he went abroad trying to evade this horrible thing, the Russian autumn: \\"Only occasionally did Russia came back to my mind and in those moments it seemed such a remote, out of the way place, that I was imagining Gostomysl, drevlyane, tatarschina... How dark and wet autumn is there!\\" The young man goes on to paint the bleak picture of autumnal landscapes of stripped-bare rural Russia, exclaiming: \\"And what an immense patience is needed there to just live this infinite autumn through!..\\" The next paragraph, dealing with the protagonist's return to Russia (the country now suffering of hunger) to witness the early winter approaching, was cut too, the story resuming with: \\"The last time I visited Meliton was at one point of the last winter.\\"  External links  * \\"–ú–µ–ª–∏—Ç–æ–Ω\\".

The ~22 nucleotide mature miRNA sequence is excised from the precursor hairpin by the enzyme Dicer. This sequence then associates with RISC which effects RNA interference. Origin and evolution of miR-214 miR-214 is a vertebrate- specific miR family that possesses one member in non-teleost vertebrates and two members in teleost fish. miR-214 is likely to have emerged within the Dnm3 gene after the divergence of jawed and jawless vertebrates and is located on the opposite strand of an intron of Dnm3 and is associated in an expression cluster with miR-199.  Function  miR-214 is a \\"melano-miR\\", so-called because it is thought to encourage the metastasis of melanoma. Specifically, the mature microRNA excised from miR-214 is predicted to target two activating protein 2 transcription factors, bringing about downstream effects on a number of genes regulating vital cell cycle processes, such as apoptosis, proliferation and angiogenesis. miR-214 is also thought to regulate type-I collagen. Role in cancer miR-214 has been found to be downregulated in human cervical cancer; when miR-214 was upregulated in HeLa cancer cells, it was found to significantly reduce cell growth. Two mRNA targets were identified as those encoding the proteins MAP2K3 and MAPK8. The increased expression of miR-214 in pancreatic cancer could bring about increased resistance to chemotherapy. In human glioma cell line T98G expression of miR-214 has been shown to suppress expression of the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 9 (UBC9) and reduces tumour cell proliferation. The protein UBC9 is involved in the sumoylation pathway, and is up-regulated in many cancers. Implication of miR-214 in skeletogenesis miR-214, along with its cluster mate miR-199, has been shown to be implicated in skeleton formation. miR-214 has been shown to inhibit bone formation in human cell lines both by targeting ATF4, a gene encoding one of the maintranscription factors required for osteoblast function and by suppressing osteogenic differentiation of C2C12 myoblast cells by targeting Sp7, an osteoblast-specific transcription factor. Also, Twist-1, which is a major actor in skeleton formation, regulates miR-199 and miR-214 cluster expression in mouse. Furthermore, miR199-214 cluster deletion in mouse lead to skeletal development abnormalities including craniofacial defects, neural arch and spinous processes malformations, and osteopenia.

Gould was part of the Australia men's national wheelchair basketball team at the 1984 New York/Stoke Mandeville, 1988 Seoul, 1992 Barcelona, 1996 Atlanta, and 2000 Sydney Paralympics. He was the top point scorer at the 1988 Seoul Paralympics, and won a gold medal as part of the winning 1996 team, for which he was awarded an Order of Australia Medal. In 2000, he received an Australian Sports Medal. He retired after the 2002 World Championships in Kitakyushu, Japan, but subsequently became assistant coach of the Australia women's national wheelchair basketball team at the 2012 London Paralympics, where they won silver. Personal David Ian Gould was born in Adelaide on 19 April 1965. He is the youngest of three children, with an older brother and sister. He attended Croydon Park Primary School and Croydon High School in Adelaide. In July 1977, he became a paraplegic due to a near-fatal shooting accident. Gould came from a sporting family; his sister played netball and his brother played basketball. He started playing basketball at the age of seven, and also played cricket for his school. He was selected for the South Australian Under 12 basketball team when he was eleven, and played against Andrew Gaze in a series against Victoria. After his accident, he began coaching junior basketball. Basketball =State team= When Gould was 15, he was introduced to the sport of wheelchair basketball. He was chosen to represent South Australia in 1982, and scored the winning shot that won his team the Australian championship. South Australia finished runner-up in 1983. Although it slipped to fourth in 1984, Gould was the team's best and fairest, and was selected in the All Star Five. He was Most Valuable Player in 1985, and was the top point scorer every year from 1984 to 1991. South Australia won the national championships again in 1986, with Gould as its best and fairest, and part of the All Star Five. He was selected to the All Star Five again every year from 1986 to 1992. South Australia was runner-up in 1987 and 1988, and won in 1989, 1990 and 1991. Gould's South Australian team, now known as the Adelaide Thunder, won the National Wheelchair Basketball League (NWBL) championship in 1993. In 1994, with Gould as vice captain, the team were undefeated championships, and he received the Carlton United Disabled Sports Star Award. In 1995, Adelaide Thunder won the league championship for the third year in a row, and Gould was voted the league's Most Valuable Player. Playing for South Australia in the National Games in Sydney in April 1996, he was runner up as Most Valuable Player and Top Points Scorer, and selected in the All Star Five Team, despite only playing in four of the seven games. Sidelined for most of the 1997 season due to an injury, Gould was still runner up Top Point Scorer, averaging 25.9 points per game, and was once again named part of the All Star Five. The following year he was part of the South Australian 3 on 3 team that won a tournament in Himeji, Japan. He became captain of Adelaide Thunder in 1999, and was once again its Top Points Scorer and Most Valuable Player. He was named to the league's All Star Five in 1998 and again in 2000. =National team= Gould's wheelchair lifts off the ground during a 2000 Sydney Paralympics match Gould made the Australia men's national wheelchair basketball team in 1983, and played in the 1984 New York/Stoke Mandeville Paralympics, where the Australian team finished eleventh, its best ever performance. In 1985, he played at the Stoke Mandeville Games, winning a bronze medal. The Australians finished tenth at the Wheelchair Basketball World Championship in Melbourne in 1986, which was once again it best ever performance, and then went on to win the gold medal at the Stoke Mandeville Games that year. In his second Paralympic Games, the 1988 Seoul Paralympics, where Australia finished tenth. He was captain of the Australian team that played at the World Championships in Bruges in 1990. The Australians toured the United States in 1991, and played in the Stoke Mandeville Games. The following year he attended his third Paralympic Games, the 1992 Barcelona Paralympics, where the team finished seventh, and he was top offensive rebounder. In 1994, Gould represented Australia in the Gold Cup Qualification tournament in Tehran, and was subsequently vice captain of the Gold Cup team which finished sixth in Edmonton later that year. He was named as a member of the World All Star Five, and was selected as part of a World team that competed against the United States in Atlanta. He captained the Australian Team at the Paralympic Qualification Tournament in Japan, where the Australian qualified and he was the tournament's top point scorer. He was captain of the national team at the 1996 Atlanta Paralympics where, for the first time, the Australian team won a Paralympic gold medal, for which he was awarded an Order of Australia Medal in the Australia Day Honours in January 1997. Gould was co-captain of the national team, now known as the Rollers, at the World Wheelchair Basketball Championships in Sydney in 1998, where it finished fourth, and in the six-nation Roosevelt Cup tournament in the United States, where the Rollers finished sixth. He carried the Olympic torch at the 2000 Sydney Olympics, and subsequently carried the torch for the 2000 Sydney Paralympics, his fifth Paralympic Games. He played with the Rollers, who were placed fifth. In 2000, he received an Australian Sports Medal for his \\"many years service to the Paralympic movement as an basketball athlete\\". He retired from playing international basketball after the 2002 World Championships in Kitakyushu, Japan. When the National Wheelchair basketball Development was established in 2010, one of its four teams was named the David Gould Whites after him. =Coach= Gould returned to coaching, and became coach of the North Adelaide District Basketball Club Under 10 girls team in 2006, and then the Under 18 boys in 2008. He then became coach of Adelaide Thunder in 2009. In 2011, he became a full-time coach under the Australian Sports Commission Scholarship Coach Program.

The shared information content of two terms in an Ontology (information science) is a popular technique to measure their semantic similarity.. DiShIn re-defines the shared information content between two concepts as the average of all their disjunctive ancestors, assuming that an ancestor is disjunctive if the difference between the number of distinct paths from the concepts to it is different from that of any other more informative ancestor. In other words, a disjunctive ancestor is the most informative ancestor representing a given set of parallel interpretations. DiShIn is an improvement of GraSM in terms of computational efficiency and in the management of parallel interpretations.  Example  For example, palladium, platinum, silver and gold are considered to be precious metals, and silver, gold and copper considered to be coinage metals. Thus, we have: metal / \\\\ precious coinage /  \\\\ \\\\ / / \\\\ /  \\\\ gold / \\\\ palladium platinum silver copper When calculating the semantic similarity between platinum and gold, DiShIn starts by calculating the number of paths difference for all their common ancestors: gold -> coinage -> metal gold -> precious -> metal platinum -> precious -> metal gold -> precious platinum -> precious For metal we have two paths from gold and one from platinum, so we have a path difference of one. For precious we have one path from each concept, so we have a path difference of zero. Since their path difference is distinct, both common ancestors metal and precious are considered to be disjunctive common ancestors. When calculating the semantic similarity between platinum and palladium, DiShIn starts by calculating the number of paths difference for all their common ancestors: palladium -> precious -> metal platinum -> precious -> metal palladium -> precious platinum -> precious For both metal and precious, we have only one path from each concept, so we have a path difference of zero for both common ancestors. Thus, only the common ancestor precious (the most informative) is considered to be a disjunctive common ancestor. Given that node-based semantic similarity measures are proportional to the average of the information content of their common disjunctive ancestors: metal and precious in case of platinum and gold; and precious in case of platinum and palladium, means that for DiShIn palladium and platinum are more similar than platinum and gold. When calculating the semantic similarity between silver and gold, DiShIn starts by calculating the number of paths difference for all their common ancestors: gold -> coinage -> metal gold -> precious -> metal silver -> coinage -> metal silver -> precious -> metal gold -> precious silver -> precious gold -> coinage silver -> coinage As in the case of platinum and palladium, here all common ancestors have a path difference of zero, since silver and gold share the same relationships and therefore have parallel interpretations. Thus, only the most informative common ancestor precious or coinage is considered to be a disjunctive common ancestor. This means that for DiShIn the similarity between silver and gold is greater or equal than the similarity between any other pair of the leaf concepts. Thus, DiShIn does not penalize parallel interpretations as GraSM did.

Although originally not intended to be a meaningful whole, as a set they comprise one of the most important collections of works in the history of music.Rosen (2002), accompanying note Hans von B√ºlow called them \\"The New Testament\\" of the piano literature (Johann Sebastian Bach's The Well-Tempered Clavier being \\"The Old Testament\\"). Beethoven's piano sonatas came to be seen as the first cycle of major piano pieces suited to concert hall performance. Being suitable for both private and public performance, Beethoven's sonatas form \\"a bridge between the worlds of the salon and the concert hall\\". The first person to play them all in a single concert cycle was Hans von B√ºlow, the first complete recording is Artur Schnabel's for the label His Master's Voice.  List of sonatas  =Early sonatas= Beethoven's early sonatas were highly influenced by those of Haydn and Mozart. Even so, he began to find new ways of composing his sonatas. His Piano Sonatas No. 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 11, 12, 13, and 15 were four movements long, which was rather uncommon in his time. * Opus 2: Three Piano Sonatas (1795) *#Piano Sonata No. 1 in F minor *#Piano Sonata No. 2 in A major *#Piano Sonata No. 3 in C major * Opus 7: Piano Sonata No. 4 in E-flat major (\\"Grand Sonata\\") (1797) * Opus 10: Three Piano Sonatas (1798) *# Piano Sonata No. 5 in C minor *# Piano Sonata No. 6 in F major *# Piano Sonata No. 7 in D major * Opus 13: Piano Sonata No. 8 in C minor (\\"Path√©tique\\") (1798) * Opus 14: Two Piano Sonatas (1799) *#Piano Sonata No. 9 in E major (Also arranged by the composer for String Quartet in F major (H 34) in 1801) *#Piano Sonata No. 10 in G major * Opus 22: Piano Sonata No. 11 in B-flat major (1800) * Opus 26: Piano Sonata No. 12 in A-flat major (\\"Funeral March\\") (1801) * Opus 27: Two Piano Sonatas (1801) *# Piano Sonata No. 13 in E-flat major 'Sonata quasi una fantasia' *# Piano Sonata No. 14 in C-sharp minor 'Sonata quasi una fantasia' (\\"Moonlight\\") * Opus 28: Piano Sonata No. 15 in D major (\\"Pastoral\\") (1801) * Opus 49: Two Piano Sonatas (composed 1795-6, published 1805) #Piano Sonata No. 19 in G minor #Piano Sonata No. 20 in G major =Middle sonatas= After he wrote his first 15 sonatas, he wrote to Wenzel Krumpholz, \\"From now on, I'm going to take a new path.\\" Beethoven's sonatas from this period are very different from his earlier ones. His experimentation in modifications to the common sonata form of Haydn and Mozart became more daring, as did the depth of expression. Most Romantic period sonatas were highly influenced by those of Beethoven. After 1804, Beethoven ceased publishing sonatas in sets and only composed them as a single opus. It is unclear why he did so. * Opus 31: Three Piano Sonatas (1802) #Piano Sonata No. 16 in G major #Piano Sonata No. 17 in D minor (\\"Tempest\\") #Piano Sonata No. 18 in E-flat major (\\"The Hunt\\") * Opus 53: Piano Sonata No. 21 in C major (\\"Waldstein\\") (1803) **WoO 57: Andante favori ‚Äî Original middle movement of the \\"Waldstein\\" sonata (1804) * Opus 54: Piano Sonata No. 22 in F major (1804) * Opus 57: Piano Sonata No. 23 in F minor (\\"Appassionata\\") (1805) * Opus 78: Piano Sonata No. 24 in F-sharp major (\\"A Th√©r√®se\\") (1809) * Opus 79: Piano Sonata No. 25 in G major (\\"Cuckoo\\") (1809) * Opus 81a: Piano Sonata No. 26 in E-flat major (\\"Les adieux/Das Lebewohl\\") (1810) * Opus 90: Piano Sonata No. 27 in E minor (1814) =Late sonatas= Beethoven's late sonatas were some of his most difficult works and some of today's most difficult repertoire. Yet again, his music found a new path, often incorporating fugal technique and displaying radical departure from conventional sonata form. The \\"Hammerklavier\\" was deemed to be Beethoven's most difficult sonata yet. In fact, it was considered unplayable until almost 15 years later, when Liszt played it in a concert. * Opus 101: Piano Sonata No. 28 in A major (1816) * Opus 106: Piano Sonata No. 29 in B-flat major (\\"Hammerklavier\\") (1818) * Opus 109: Piano Sonata No. 30 in E major (1820) * Opus 110: Piano Sonata No. 31 in A-flat major (1821) * Opus 111: Piano Sonata No. 32 in C minor (1822) Performances and recordings In a single concert cycle, the whole 32 sonatas were first performed by Hans von B√ºlow.

Green Mountain Care, established by the passage of H.202, creates a system in the state where Vermonters receive universal health care coverage as well as technological improvements to the existing system. On December 17, 2014, Vermont abandoned its plan for universal health care, citing the taxes required of smaller businesses within the state.Governor abandons single-payer health care plan, yahoo.com, December 17, 2014 Planning In 2010, the State Legislature passed S 88 (which included provisions from Act 128), which enabled the state of Vermont to establish a commission to study different forms of health care delivery in the state.S 88 : An act relating to health care financing and universal access to health care in Vermont. As passed by House and Senate, 2010. Dr. William Hsiao, a Harvard University professor of economics who was an advisor during Taiwan's transition to single-payer health care,New York Times: Health Care Abroad: Taiwan. November 3, 2009. was enlisted to design three possible options to reform Vermont's health care.Vermont Public Radio: Dr. William Hsaio on health care system reform. January 20, 2011. Hsaio, along with Steven Kappel and Jonathan Gruber, presented the proposal to the legislature of Vermont on June 21, 2010.The Vermont Option: Achieving Affordable Universal Health Care. Dr. William Hsaio, Steven Kappel, Jonathan Gruber, and a team of health policy analysts, June 21, 2010. The three options were laid out as follows: * Option 1: As laid out by the requirements of Act 128, the first option would create \\"a government- administered and publicly financed single-payer health benefit system decoupled from employment which prohibits insurance coverage for the health services provided by this system and allows for private insurance coverage only of supplemental health services.\\" The proposal considered this option to be the easiest path to single-payer, but was critical of the \\"complex and inefficient process\\" of proof of residency needs. * Option 2: As laid out by the requirements of S 88, the second option would create \\"a public health benefit option administered by state government, which allows individuals to choose between the public option and private insurance coverage and allows for fair and robust competition among public and private plans.\\" The commission noted that this option did not provide universal coverage on its own or the enforcement mechanism in place for any possible mandates put in place to achieve more coverage. * Option 3: Act 128 allowed the commission to design a system that met the various principles outlined in Section 2 of the Act. The commission's design ultimately sought out an \\"approach to Option 3... by combining three studies to ascertain what type of universal health insurance, what methods of financing, and what type of single payer system is most likely to be politically and practically viable for Vermont.\\" The commission's proposal ultimately considered the third option to be \\"the most politically and practically viable single payer system for Vermont,\\" noting that Vermont, \\"a small state with communitarian values,\\" with its existing network of non- profit hospitals and a medical community that had previously shown support for state intervention, would be \\"uniquely poised to pass universal health reform.\\" Legislation Following the proposal, Democratic state senator Mark Larson introduced H 202 on February 8, 2011, titled Single-Payer and Unified Health System.Project VoteSmart: H 202 - SINGLE-PAYER AND UNIFIED HEALTH SYSTEM - KEY VOTE. The bill passed the House on March 24, 2011, with 94 votes in favor and 49 against.H. 202 The bill then passed the Senate on April 26, 2011, with 21 votes in favor and 9 against. The conference report legislation passed the Senate on May 3, 2011 with 21 votes in favor and 9 opposed, and the House on May 4, 2011 with 94 votes in favor and 49 against.H. 202 conference report. Governor Peter Shumlin signed the bill on May 26, 2011. =Green Mountain Care= The signing of H. 202 led to the creation of Green Mountain Care, described by Kaiser Health News as \\"a state-funded-and-managed insurance pool that would provide near-universal coverage to residents with the expectation that it would reduce health care spending.\\"Kaiser Health News: Vermont Edges Toward Single Payer. October 2, 2011. Governor Shumlin, in a blog post at Huffington Post, described the plan as \\"a single payer system\\" that he believed \\"will control health care costs, not just by cutting fees to doctors and hospitals, but by fundamentally changing the state's health care system.\\"Huffington Post: The Economic Urgency of Health Care Reform. August 5, 2011. As of January 2013, Vermont was still working out the role of Green Mountain Care and the responsibilities of the bill, as well as how to fund the program. Dr. Hsiao, for example, had proposed an 11% payroll tax on employers, and the administration was required under Act 48 to provide a financing system in 2013.Vermont Business Magazine: Health care committee to look at insurance subsidies, financing for single payer, role of Green Mountain Care Board. January 14, 2013. The state also had to align Green Mountain Care with provisions in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, passed by the United States federal government in 2010, which required the creation of a health care exchange in individual states. To launch fully, Green Mountain Care would have had to gain approval from the federal government to use federal health finances to fund the state program. As of April 2014, Vermont had yet to craft a bill that would address the $2 billion in extra spending necessary to fund the single-payer system,Bloomberg: Vermont's Single-Payer Dream is Taxpayer Nightmare. April 24, 2014.Vox: Forget Obamacare: Vermont wants to bring single-payer to America. April 9, 2014. and by the end of the year, the state abandoned their plan for universal health care, citing the taxes required of smaller businesses within the state. Popular opinion and reactions Dr. Hsiao, in his proposal, noted that \\"a two-thirds majority of Vermonters said that all Vermonters should be able to get the health care they need when they need it, regardless of their ability to pay even if this means that they would have to pay higher taxes and higher insurance premiums themselves.\\" The bill was passed in the Vermont legislature on party line votes, with Democrats and Progressives in favor and Republicans against. The bill is considered the first single-payer bill to be passed on the state level, but private insurers can continue to operate in the state. Representative Larson has described Green Mountain Care's provisions as \\"as close as we can get [to single-payer] at the state level.\\"American Medical News: Vermont approves universal health program. May 16, 2011. According to Leigh Tofferi, the director of government, public and community relations for Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont, the lack of initial specifics was causing \\"anxiety\\" to many providers. The Vermont Medical Society had no position on the bill or on single-payer in general. David Himmelstein, the founder of Physicians for a National Health Program, a single-payer advocacy group, was critical of the plan due to the ability of private insurers to operate in the state, arguing that the plan \\"give[s] up a significant part of the administrative savings by doing that,\\" but agreeing that Green Mountain Care \\"lays the foundation\\" for single-payer. In the 2014 gubernatorial election, Governor Shumlin was heavily favored for re-election but only received a plurality of the vote, 46.4%, to Republican Scott Milne's 45.1%. The election was decided by the Vermont General Assembly on January 8, 2015; Shumlin defeated Milne by a vote of 110 to 69. The Burlington Free Press ascribed the result, in part, to voters' dissatisfaction with the progress the state had made in instituting single-payer health care. Aftermath One of the problems found since the abandonment of the Vermont Health Care initiatives is questionable billing from Jonathan Gruber, who according to CNBC, has come under more scrutiny because of the contract. According to a Vermont State report filed by Doug Hoffer, an invoice sent by Gruber to Vermont on December 30, 2014 for $40,000 increased the amount of scrutiny on the billing.

Classification The clade Gravisauria was appointed by the French paleontologist Ronan Allain and Moroccan paleontologist Najat Aquesbi in 2008 when a cladistic analysis of the dinosaur found by Allain, Tazoudasaurus, as the outcome was that the family Vulcanodontidae. The group includes Tazoudasaurus and Vulcanodon, and the sister taxon Eusauropoda, but also certain species such as Antetonitrus, Gongxianosaurus and Isanosaurus that do not belong in Vulcanodontidae but to an even more basic position occupied in Sauropoda. It made sense to have Sauropoda compared to this, more derived group that included Vulcanodontidae and Eusauropoda in a definition: Gravisauria (heavy lizards), defined as the group formed by the last common ancestor of Tazoudasaurus and Saltasaurus (Bonaparte and Powell, 1980) and all its descendants. Below is a cladogram found by Nair and Salisbury in 2012 showing the relationships of Gravisauria: Synapomorphies Aquesbi mentioned two synapomorphies, shared derived characteristics of Gravisauria: the vertebrae are wider side to side than front to rear and possession of asymmetrical condyles femoris at the bottom of the femur. Those were previously not thought to be Eusauropoda synapomorphies but Allian found these properties also on Tazoudasaurus. Involvement in extinction Gravisauria split off in the Early Jurassic, around the Pliensbachian and Toarcian, 183 million years ago, and Aquesbi thought that this was part of a much larger revolution in the fauna, which includes the disappearance of Prosauropoda, Coelophysoidea and basal Thyreophora, which they attributed to a worldwide mass extinction.

Teams The league contracted from fourteen teams to thirteen, after the Gold Coast Football Club left and entered the Australian Football League. The fledgling Gold Coast club had used the 2009 TAC Cup season and the 2010 VFL season as preparation for joining the AFL. There was originally speculation that the Greater Western Sydney Giants, which had played TAC Cup in 2010 and was set to join the AFL in 2012, may have spent the 2011 season in the VFL under a similar plan, but instead the club opted to play in the North East Australian Football League. The VFL continued to serve as both the top state-level football league in Victoria, and as a reserves competition for Victorian-based clubs in the Australian Football League, as had been the case since 2000. The affiliation agreements between VFL and AFL clubs were unchanged from 2010. The top three teams from 2010 - North Ballarat, Northern Bullants and Williamstown - competed in the inaugural Foxtel Cup competition, with Williamstown winning the event. Port Melbourne dominated the 2011 season, winning twenty-one games in a row to win the premiership undefeated. In the home-and-away season, the Borough finished with a record of 18-0, finishing four games clear atop the ladder; it was the first time a club had finished the home-and-away season undefeated since Geelong West in 1972 Division 2, and the first to do so in the top division since Williamstown in 1957. The Borough maintained its undefeated record through the finals to claim the premiership, replicating the feat of Geelong West's 1972 team, but becoming the first team to achieve the feat in the top division since North Melbourne in 1918. Ladder Finals =Grand Final= Awards *The J. J. Liston Trophy was won for the second consecutive year by Shane Valenti (Port Melbourne), who polled 25 votes. Valenti finished ahead of Matthew Bate (Casey Scorpions), who was second with 15 votes, and Ben Jolley (Williamstown), who was third with 13 votes. *The Frosty Miller Medal was won by Patrick Rose (Port Melbourne), who kicked 67 goals for the season. *The Fothergill-Round Medal was won by Ahmed Saad (Northern Bullants) *The top three teams, Port Melbourne, Williamstown and Werribee, qualified for the 2012 Foxtel Cup tournament. *The reserves premiership was won by Box Hill.

Born in Johannesburg, South Africa he currently resides in Ch√¢teau d'≈íx, Switzerland. He studied Human Movement Science at Stellenbosch University in Western Cape, South Africa. Horn is currently undertaking his latest expedition Pole2Pole, a two-year circumnavigation of the globe via the two poles. Mike Horn became famous in 2001 after completing a one-year, 6-month solo journey around the equator without any motorised transport. In 2004 he completed a two-year, 3-month solo circumnavigation of the Arctic Circle, and in 2006 along with Norwegian explorer B√∏rge Ousland, became the first men to travel without dog or motorised transport to the North Pole during winter, in permanent darkness. Biography Mike was born in Johannesburg, South Africa. He spent most of his childhood outdoors climbing trees, cycling for miles and fishing with his three brothers and sisters. Both of his parents were university teachers, but his father was also a successful amateur rugby player.Mike Horn, About Mike (2014) Mike Horn Mike said that he learned to challenge himself from a young age, but it was the army that taught him about survival.Laura Secorun Palet, Mike Horn's Extreme Adventures (2013) Ozy ‚ÄúI hate war but I think it prepared me for what I do today,‚Äù he said, remembering his days in the military service when he was sent to Angola and first witnessed death. ‚ÄúI was only an 18-year- old kid when I discovered one will do anything to stay alive‚Äù. He studied Human Movement Science at the University of Stellenbosch in Western Cape, South Africa. Mike says he first felt the call of the wild at 24 years old. He quit his comfortable sports science job, gave everything away and moved to Switzerland. From there, he embarked on a series of adventures, including descending by delta plane from a 22,000-foot mountain and riverboarding the world's deepest canyon.Zar, Special South Africans (2007) ZAbra Mike was married to Cathy Horn. She died in February 2015 due to breast cancer. Motivational Coaching Horn uses his experiences to motivate sportsmen and other people involved in challenging work such as deep sea drilling. During 2010 and 2011, he conducted motivational sessions for the Indian Cricket Team at the request of its coach, Gary Kirsten.Motivator Horn offers to help India espnstar.com. Retrieved 25 November 2011. The team went on to win the 2011 Cricket World Cup for the second time after 28 years. Members of Indian Cricket Team acknowledged Horn's motivational work. Horn then accompanied Kirsten and the South African cricket team, whom Kirsten then coached, on an expedition to the Alps in 2012, as a team bonding exercise and part of their preparation for their Test series against the then No. 1 ranked team England. They dominated England in the first test (of a 3 test series), a feat which England and world cricket had not seen in a decade. Eventually, South Africa went on and won the series 2‚Äì0 with one test drawn. With this victory, South Africa took the No. 1 test ranking from England, and currently holds the mace. He was also hired by Kolkata Knight Riders team for IPL-7 and KKR won the first match with 41 Runs against Mumbai Indians and went on a 9 match unbeaten run eventually winning the IPL-7 Title. The latest in line to benefit from Horn's expertise was the German football team. The entire squad went on a sailing trip with Horn in June during their preparations for the World Cup and came out a rejuvenated side. Germany captain Philipp Lahm was impressed, saying it was \\"incredible what the human body can achieve.\\" \\"We must be well prepared, and have to respect the opponent,\\" said Lahm when asked what they had learned after Horn's presentation. Eventually even Germany won the FIFA World Cup, after 24 years. Expeditions =Amazon (1997)= In April 1997, Mike launched his first big expedition: the six-month solo traverse of the South American continent. He left on foot from the Pacific Ocean and climbed to the source of the Amazon River high in the Peruvian Andes. From here he descended the 7,000 km of the Amazon River on a hydrospeed, until he reached the Atlantic Ocean. It took him six months, solo and without assistance.Petzl, Mike Horn (2014) Petzl Team <> Mike hunted, fished and survived off his environment. His finish point was the Atlantic Ocean where he finally tasted saltwater.Mike Horn, Amazon (2014) Mike Horn =Latitude Zero (1999-2000)= In 1999, Mike set off on an 18-month voyage to circle the equator on foot and by sailing. He left Gabon and crossed the Atlantic to Brazil on a Corsair F-28 trimaran. He then crossed Brazil and Ecuador on bike, canoe and on foot. After that he crossed the Pacific Ocean reaching Indonesia via the Galapagos Islands and crossed Borneo and Sumatra on foot, before crossing the Indian Ocean. To finish the expedition, he crossed the African continent on foot through the Congo and Gabon.Alison Cockcroft, Mike Horn (2001) National Geographic <> This was the first solo circumnavigation of the world around the Equator ‚Äì unaided and with no engine-driven support. =Arktos (2002-2004)= In 2002‚Äì04, Mike went around the world on the Arctic Circle solo in an expedition dubbed ‚ÄúArktos‚Äù. It was a solitary voyage of two years and three months without motorised transport (boat, kayak, ski kite and on foot) on a odyssey. Mike left North Cape in Norway and went through Greenland, Canada, Alaska, Bering Strait and Russian Siberia before he reached North Cape.Raphael Blanc, Arktos: The Internal Journey of Mike Horn (2005) Documentary . Mike spent time with the local people who had courageously adapted to the unforgiving environment.Mike Horn, Arktos (2014) Mike Horn In 2005 Mike published his account of this expedition in Conqu√©rant de l'impossible (published in English in 2007 as Conquering the Impossible by St. Martin's Press). =North Pole by Night (2006)= In a world-first, Mike set off on a 60-day voyage on skis without dogs or motorised transportation during the Arctic night with Norwegian explorer Borge Ousland in 2006. From February to March they dragged pulkas from Cape Artichesky in Russia to the North Pole. For two months the pair walked in total darkness, and often on paper-thin ice.Arctic Portal, Mike Horn ‚Äì North Pole Winter Night Expedition (2012) Arctic Portal http://arcticportal.org/vh/viewvideo/204/north-pole/mike-horn-north-pole- winter-night-expedition-2006 =Pangaea (2008-2012)= In 2008, Mike and his team launched the Young Explorers Program. This program consisted in recruiting and then inviting young adults between the ages of 15 and 20 years old, from all over the world ‚Äì to explore the Earth's continents and travel across the planet's oceans with the PANGAEA expedition sailing vessel. Close to 100 Young Explorers accompanied him to 12 hot spots around the world where they implemented ecological and social projects ‚Äì following the motto ‚Äúexplore ‚Äì learn ‚Äì act‚Äù. Although this project ended in 2012, the Young Explorers ‚Äì now young world ambassadors ‚Äì continue to set in motion different types projects around the globe. =Driven To Explore (2015)= In May 2015, Mike Horn set off on the ‚ÄúDriven To Explore‚Äù expedition, sponsored by Mercedes-Benz. Leaving from Switzerland, Horn drove through 13 countries, reaching Pakistan where he attempted to summit K2 (8611 m) in the Karakoram mountain range. =Pole2Pole (2016-2019)= In 2016, Horn set off on his latest expedition ‚ÄúPole2Pole‚Äù, a two-year circumnavigation of the globe via the South and North Poles. On May 8, 2016, Mike left from his point of departure, The Yacht Club of Monaco with the support of H.S.H Prince Albert of Monaco II. Sponsored by Mercedes-Benz and Panerai Mike's Pole2Pole adventure took him across land and sea. Equipped with his exploration sailing vessel, Pangaea, Mike circumnavigated the globe from Africa to Antarctica, Oceania, Asia, the Arctic, and back to Europe. The Pole2Pole expedition ended in December 2019 following the completion of Mike's Arctic crossing which brought him back to Europe, his starting point over three years after leaving the Yacht Club of Monaco in May 2016. This Pole2Pole expedition fell perfectly under three main themes: Adventure, Environment and Sharing. =Antarctica Crossing (2016-2017)= On February 7 2017 at 22:50 UT Mike Horn completed the longest ever solo, unsupported north-to-south traverse of Antarctica from the Princess Astrid Coast (lat -70.1015 lon 9.8249) to the Dumont D'urville Station (lat -66.6833 lon 139.9167) via the South Pole. He arrived at the pole on January 9, 2017. A total distance of 5100 km was covered utilising kites and skis in 57 days. =Arctic Crossing (2019)= On December 7 2019 just before midnight, Mike Horn and B√∏rge Ousland completed the first ever full crossing of the Arctic Ocean via the North Pole. The pair left from Nome, Alaska on August 28th 2019 on Mike Horn's exploration sailing vessel Pangaea captained by famous Swiss sailor Bernard Stamm and a small crew. The goal was to sail as far north as possible towards the North Pole, until solid ice prevented them from navigating any further. This position was reached on September 11th and would be Mike and B√∏rge's departure point for their #NorthPoleCrossing expedition. (Coincidentally, Pangaea ended up being the furthest north a sailing vessel has ever ventured to. Not a record to be proud of however, because it reflects the significant speed at which the planet's polar regions are melting due to climate change.) The two explorers disembarked Pangaea and began their trek across the frozen Arctic Ocean on September 12th 2019 pulling two sleds each weighing over 180kg. Their journey lasted 87 days, 57 of which were spent in total darkness due to the winter season. The main difficulties faced during this adventure were the fragility of the ice due to the warming climate and strong negative drifts pushing the duo away form their goal. Due to these challenges and the significant delays they caused, Mike and B√∏rge had to finish their expedition differently than originally anticipated. The initial plan was to be picked up by Mike's boat Pangaea on the Norwegian side, where the solid ice broke into the open water. However due to food shortage, a larger boat capable of making its way further north into the ice, was sent to pick up the two adventurers instead. Today, the success of this ambitious endeavour is marked as a history-writing moment in the world of polar exploration. Mountaineering =Gasherbrum 1 (8035 m) and Gasherbrum 2 (8068 m)= In 2007, Mike, Jean Troillet, Fred Roux and Olivier Roduit reached the summit of Gasherbrum 1 (8035 m) and Gasherbrum 2 (8068 m) without oxygen. The original plan was to climb four Himalayan summits of 8000 meters, but their luck turned with weather which made them turn back.Mike Horn, Himalaya Expedition (2014) Mike Horn http://www.mikehorn.com/expedition-item/himalaya-expedition/ =Broad Peak (8047 m)= In 2010, Mike and Swiss mountain guide/alpinist K√∂bi Reichen reach the summit of Broad Peak (8047 m) without the use of additional oxygen in the Karakoram mountain range in Pakistan. =Makalu (8463 m)= In 2014, Mike and Fred Roux summited the majestic peak of Makalu at (8,463 m) in alpine style, without high altitude porters or the use of additional oxygen. =K2 (8611 m)= In May 2015, Mike Horn set off on the ‚ÄúDriven To Explore‚Äù expedition with the loyal support of his main sponsor Mercedes-Benz. Leaving from Switzerland, Horn drove through 13 countries at the wheels of two Mercedes- Benz G-Class SUVs to finally reach Pakistan where he attempted to summit K2 (8611 m) in the Karakoram mountain range. Accompanied by his climbing partners, Fred Roux and K√∂bi Reichen, the team unfortunately did not make it to the summit due to unfavourable weather. Television shows =The Island: seuls au monde= Since 2015 Horn has been participating in M6's French television show ‚ÄúThe Island: Seuls au monde‚Äù season 1, 2 and 3 as the show's survival expert, where he shares his deep knowledge of survival with the show's participants in order for them to survive on a tropical island without food or assistance over the period of one month. =√Ä L'√âtat Sauvage= Between 2016 and 2018, Horn participates in M6's French version of the American television show: Running Wild with Bear Grylls, named: √Ä L'√âtat Sauvage. In each episode, Horn brings a different celebrity along on his adventures. The following 6 French celebrities made their embarked on an adventure with Horn: Michael Youn, Matt Pokora, Laure Manaudou, Christophe Dechavanne, Shy'm and Adriana Karembeu. Each episode took place in different countries around the world: Namibia, Sri Lanka, Botswana, Venezuela and Nepal. =Cap Horn= After 6 episodes of \\"√Ä L'√âtat Sauvage\\", Horn starts his own format of the show: \\"Cap Horn\\". So far, two episodes of this new show have aired in 2018, featuring celebrities Arnaud Ducret and Bernard de La Villardi√®re, whom he embarked on adventures with in the Philippines.

It is a member of the Forkhead/winged helix (FOX) family of transcription factors that is involved in ciliogenesis. FOXJ1 is expressed in ciliated cells of the lung, choroid plexus, reproductive tract, embryonic kidney and pre-somite embryo stage.  Gene Location  The human FOXJ1 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 17, region 2, band 5, sub-band 1.  Structure  FOXJ1 has a conserved 100 amino acid long DNA binding domain.  Function  This gene encodes a member of the forkhead family of transcription factors. Similar genes in zebrafish and mouse have been shown to regulate the transcription of genes that control the production of motile cilia. The mouse ortholog also functions in the determination of left-right asymmetry. = Ciliogenesis = Primary ciliogenesis is FOXJ1 dependent and this transcription factor is required for motile ciliated cell differentiation. The onset of FOXJ1 expression is indicative of cells fated to become motile cilliated cells. Cells commit towards ciliogenesis prior to FOXJ1 activation. Activation promotes basal body trafficking, docking at the apical membrane and subsequent axoneme growth. The protein p73 a member of the p53 protein family directly regulates FOXJ1 and is a requirement for ciliated cell formation. The 10,000bp long transcription start site of FOXJ1 features three sequence specific binding sites for p73. = Immune system = In mammalian cells, FOXJ1 has been shown to suppress NFŒ∫B, a key regulator in the immune response and also inhibits the humoral response in B-cells. This occurs via regulation of an inhibitory component of NFŒ∫B called IŒ∫BŒ≤ and IL-6. = Development = FOXJ1 is expressed at various points during embryonic development in relation to teeth germination, enamel, oral and tongue epithelium formation, and formation of sub-mandibular salivary glands and hair follicles. Absence of FOXJ1 expression decreases calpastatin, an inhibitor of the protease calpain. Calpain dysregulation affects basal body anchoring to the apical cytoskeleton affecting axeonemal formation. Expression of FOXJ1 is inhibited by IL-13.  Clinical significance  Polymorphisms in this gene are associated with systemic lupus erythematosus and allergic rhinitis. Viral infections of the respiratory system have been found to lower the expression of FOXJ1. This affects ciliogenesis and impacts mucocillary action. = Breast cancer = Studies into human breast tissue lines and primary breast tumors have observed that the gene FOXJ1 are aberrantly hypermethylated in primary tumors. This hypermethylation serves to silence production of the FOXJ1 protein and has been proposed as a potentially important event in tumor formation. = Clear renal cell carcinoma = FOXJ1 expression has been shown to be elevated in clear cell renal carcinoma patients and indicative of tumor stage, histological grade and tumor size. High expression of FOXJ1 in CRCC patients was associated with poor prognosis. There is potential for FOXJ1 to act as an oncogene marker for CRCC patients and has value as a therapeutic target. = Axenfeld‚ÄìRieger syndrome = Axenfeld‚ÄìRieger syndrome patients have a point mutation in PITX2 a regulatory protein of the FOXJ1 gene. PITX2 alongside LEF-1 and Œ≤-Catenin regulate FOXJ1. FOXJ1 in turn interacts with PITX2 to form a positive feedback mechanism. In the PITX2 point mutant whilst able to bind with FOXJ1 lacks the ability to activate the FOXJ1 promoter, this results in improper oro-facial morphogenesis a factor in ARS. = Hydrocephalus = Mutations in this gene have been associated with an autosomal dominant syndrome that includes hydrocephalus and randomization of left/right body asymmetry.

In 1927, Buisman provided the final proof that Graphium ulmi (later named Ophiostoma ulmi) was the causal agent of the disease, concluding the controversy which had raged among Dutch and German scientists since 1922. Buisman developed the inoculation method for screening large numbers of elm plants for resistance, and in 1932 discovered the generative form of the fungus, Ceratostomella ulmi. The first ever resistant elm clone released in the Netherlands was named for her in 1937, following her untimely death the previous year.Heybroek, H. M. and Nijboer, R. (2013). Christine Johanna Buisman in Italy. p. 4-6\\\\. Private publication, Netherlands. Biography Buisman was the eldest of four children raised in a liberal and socially conscious family in Leeuwarden. She completed her secondary education at the local gymnasium in 1919, after which she studied Biology in Amsterdam, her main interest at that time being marine flora. During 1923‚Äì24, Buisman joined practical courses at the phytopathology laboratory ‚ÄúWillie Commelin Scholten‚Äù in Baarn, a small town near Amsterdam.Faasse, P. E. (1992). In splendid isolation -a history of the Willie Commelin Scholten Phytopathology Laboratory 1894-1992, p. 106. Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. KNAW Press, The laboratory was accommodated in the leafy Villa Java alongside the Centraal Bureau voor Schimmelcultures (fungicultures) (CBS), where Buisman also worked as an assistant. Both institutions were led by Prof. Johanna Westerdijk (1883‚Äì1961), the first female professor in the Netherlands, appointed in 1917. In 1927, Buisman was awarded a doctorate by Utrecht University. Elm disease research At the end of 1926, funds were granted for further research into the cause of Dutch elm disease. Buisman was charged with this two-year project, and part of the villa garden was duly planted with elm seedlings. To infect so many plants, Buisman experimented with the use of a syringe, a method which would be used in successive decades. In 1927, she succeeded in producing both vascular discolouration and leaf wilt, simply by inoculating her trial plants earlier in summer than Bea Schwarz had done in 1921, confirming the results achieved by Wollenweber and Stapp in Berlin, providing the definitive proof that Graphium ulmi caused Dutch elm disease (DED). In 1929, Buisman left the CBS for further study in Dahlem Berlin. In August that year, she attended a congress of the International Federation of University Women in Geneva, where she met Bernice Cronkhite, dean of Harvard University‚Äôs Radcliffe College in Boston, US. Buisman seized the opportunity to apply for a fellowship to study the elms and elm diseases in the US, and by the next month she began her one year‚Äôs study in Boston, with the main objective of determining whether Graphium ulmi was also present in the US. It was not until the last days before her return to Europe that she managed to isolate the fungus in samples from Cleveland, being the first to confirm the presence of the fungus on the North American continent. She also studied other elm diseases, helped by donations of Ulmus americana seedlings from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. She recorded this research in a paper published in the Journal of the Arnold Arboretum, Vol. XII (1931): \\"Three Species of Botryodiplodia Sacc. on Elm Trees in the United States\\". Dutch Elm Committee During Buisman's stay in the US, the threat posed by DED in the Netherlands was taken more seriously and, in February 1930, a second attempt led to the founding of the Committee for Study and Control of the Elm Disease. Westerdijk invited Buisman to accept the position of researcher at Baarn on her return in October 1930. During her years at Baarn, Buisman wrote many publications on elm disease, delivering speeches in and beyond the Netherlands (she was multilingual), quickly establishing herself as the paramount elm specialist in Europe. From the thousands of seedlings under test, by 1935 Buisman had selected several promising elm clones with a significantly better resistance to DED, notably two from France (clone no. 1) and Spain (clone no. 24), which she prepared to use in hybridization experiments in The Hague, assisted by Simon Doorenbos, director of that city's parks department. Death In March 1936, Buisman underwent a gynaecological operation. Although the surgery initially appeared successful, she succumbed to an infection on March 27, just five days after her 36th birthday. Buisman was buried three days later at the hilltop cemetery 'Westerveld' at Driehuis, set in the dunes of the North Sea west of Amsterdam. Eponymy Ulmus minor 'Christine Buisman' in Amsterdam, 2007 When the Dutch Elm Committee decided to release clone No. 24 in 1937, the clone was named for the dedicated elm researcher. Although the 'Christine Buisman' elm didn't meet expectations concerning its growth habit, and appeared to be susceptible to Coral Spot fungus, Nectria cinnabarina, many mature specimens still survive in the Netherlands, England and the US as living proof of her achievement. Epilogue The Dutch resistant-elm breeding project continued until 1992, followed in due course by similar projects in North America, Italy, and Spain, releasing to commerce many more DED-resistant elm cultivars. =Christine Buisman Foundation= Soon after her death, Buisman's parents inaugurated the Christine Buisman Foundation, which contributes to the expenses for foreign studies by female Dutch biology students.

A prominent member of the influential 1970s‚Äì1980s derevenschiki movement, Belov's best known novels include Business as Usual (–ü—Ä–∏–≤—ã—á–Ω–æ–µ –¥–µ–ª–æ, 1966), Eves (–ö–∞–Ω—É–Ω—ã, 1972‚Äì1987), Everything's Ahead (–í—Å—ë –≤–ø–µ—Ä–µ–¥–∏, 1986) and The Year of a Major Breakdown (–ì–æ–¥ –≤–µ–ª–∏–∫–æ–≥–æ –ø–µ—Ä–µ–ª–æ–º–∞, 1989‚Äì1994). Vasily Belov was a harsh critic of the Soviet rural policies (particularly collectivisation), which he felt were dominated by the cosmopolitan doctrines aiming at repressing the Russian national identity. Even detractors, though, praised Vasily Belov's tough stance on ecological issues and his activities aimed at restoration of the old Russian historic sites and churches. A great admirer of Ivan Ilyin and his legacy, Belov financed the publication of the first Complete Ilyin collection and wrote a preface for it.Russian Writers and Poets. The Brief Biographical Dictionary. Moscow, 2000. –í–∞—Å–∏–ª–∏–π –ë–µ–ª–æ–≤ Vasily Belov, the USSR State Prize (1981) and the State Prize of the Russian Federation (2003) laureate, was also a recipient of the Order of the Red Banner of Labour (1982), the Order of Lenin (1984), the Order of Merit for the Fatherland (IV, 2003) and the Order of Honour (2003).  Biography  Vasily Ivanovich Belov was born in Timonikha, Kharovsky District, Northern Krai, now Vologda oblast, into a peasant family, the eldest of five children. His father Ivan Belov was killed in 1943 in the Second World War. While at school, Vasily had to work at the local kolkhoz, helping his mother to raise the family. His main memory of childhood, as Belov once recalled, was that of \\"overbearing hunger, for food and books.\\" In 1949 he joined a professional college in Sokol, Vologda Oblast to learn the craft of carpenter and joiner. After the army he worked in one of the Molotov factories, then in 1956 moved back to Vologda where he started contributing to the regional Communard newspaper. Supported by Aleksander Yashin, an established Vologda writer, Belov in 1959 enrolled into the Maxim Gorky Literature Institute in Moscow. =Career= In 1961 Vasily Belov's first book of poetry My Small Forest Village was published, along with the Village Berdyaika novella, his debut in prose. In 1963 he became a member of the USSR Union of Writers and a year later, having graduated the Gorky Institute, returned to Vologda. In 1964 his book of short stories Sultry Summer was published, followed by Beyond the Three VoloksVolok (–í–æ–ª–æ–∫), 'a drag': a space of dry land between two rivers across which boats and small ships had to be dragged by human force. (1965). It was the novella Privychnoye delo (Business as Usual, 1966) published by Sever magazine, that made Belov a well-known author, its main character Ivan Africanovich soon becoming the village prose movement's token figure. Business as Usual was miles apart from the standards of Socialist realism, and the magazine's editor Dmitry Gusarov even had to place the \\"To be concluded\\" tag in the end of it to appease censors who felt the story's finale was \\"too pessimistic\\". It was followed in 1968 by the Carpenter Tales short stories collection (published in Aleksander Tvardovsky's Novy Mir) and then Vologda Bukhtinas (1969) a set of modern local folklore pieces.Bukhtina, –±—É—Ö—Ç–∏–Ω–∞ ‚Äì in the local Vologda argot, a joke, funny anecdote. The leitmotif of the collection Upbringing According to Dr. Spock (1974) was the rural-against-urban lifestyle dilemma, the latter seen by the author as unnatural, amoral and deficient. In contrast, 1979's Lad (Harmony) compilation of ethnographical essays proved to be Belov's most cheerful book, portraying the traditional Russian rural ways of life as an idyll of man living in harmony with nature. An outspoken opponent of some of the Soviet official policies, Vasily Belov has not for a moment been considered a dissident, having found his ideological stronghold in the opposite corner of the ideological specter. In 1981 he received the USSR State Prize (\\"For creating works of superb artistic quality\\"), then the Order of the Red Banner of Labour (1982) and Order of Lenin (1984). In the early 1980s he became one of the leading figures in the Soviet Writers Union and the Russian Federation Writers Union's first secretary. His plays Over the Light Waters, On the 206th, The Immortal Koshchey were running in theatres all over the country, all highlighting the idea of fighting amorality (the natural consequence of urbanization, as he saw it) and concentrating upon preserving the Russian natural riches. The 1986 Everything's Ahead novel, again targeting the urban set of values, caused controversy and brought about heated discussion in the Soviet press. It was followed by Such Was the War (1987), a collection comprising a novel and some short stories. Before that, in 1983, one of Belov's best-known works, the Eves (the novel which he started in 1972) came out, followed by The Year of a Major Breakdown (1989‚Äì1991) and The Sixth Hour (The 1932 Chronicle). This epic trilogy, telling the tragic story of three peasant families, became arguably the strongest statement against collectivization in the non-dissident Soviet literature, exploring what the author saw as the conflict between Russian rural traditionalism and the Bolsheviks-imposed 'rootlessness', the latter leading to chaos, mass murder and degradation. In 1989‚Äì1991 Belov published a series of children's books: The Old and the Small, The Little Spring fairytale and others. He started to get involved in the practical politics, first as the People's deputy, then (in 1991‚Äì1992) the member of the Supreme Soviet. In 1993‚Äì1995 the Sovremennik Publishers issued the first Complete Vasily Belov collection in five volumes. The Honeymoon novella came out in 1996, but by this time Belov became better known as an author of highly emotional essays (appearing mostly in pro- nationalist Moskva, Nash Sovremennik magazines and Zavtra newspaper) on issues like the demise of small Russian villages and the degradation of the Russian language. In 1997 Vasily Belov became the Honorary citizen of Vologda. In the 2000s he was awarded the Order of Reverend Sergius of Radonezh (2002), the Order of Merit for the Fatherland (IV, 2003) and the Russian Federation's State Prize (2004) for literature and arts. Vasily Belov devoted his last years to the restoration of the Nikolskaya church in Timonikha where he had been baptized as a child. He financed the project and worked on scaffolds himself. In 2011 the church was robbed and desecrated. On the next day Belov suffered a stroke from which he never fully recovered. Vasily Belov died on 4 December 2012, aged 80, in Vologda.

Researchers data mine large digital archives to investigate cultural phenomena reflected in language and word usage. The term is an American neologism first described in a 2010 Science article called Quantitative Analysis of Culture Using Millions of Digitized Books, co-authored by Harvard researchers Jean- Baptiste Michel and Erez Lieberman Aiden. Michel and Aiden helped create the Google Labs project Google Ngram Viewer which uses n-grams to analyze the Google Books digital library for cultural patterns in language use over time. Because the Google Ngram data set is not an unbiased sample, and does not include metadata, there are several pitfalls when using it to study language or the popularity of terms. Medical literature accounts for a large, but shifting, share of the corpus,Comparison of example terms which does not take into account how often the literature is printed, or read. Studies Narrative network of US Elections 2012 In a study called Culturomics 2.0, Kalev H. Leetaru examined news archives including print and broadcast media (television and radio transcripts) for words that imparted tone or \\"mood\\" as well as geographic data. The research was able to retroactively predict the 2011 Arab Spring and successfully estimate the final location of Osama Bin Laden to within . In a 2012 paper by Alexander M. Petersen and co-authors, they found a \\"dramatic shift in the birth rate and death rates of words\\": Deaths have increased and births have slowed. The authors also identified a universal \\"tipping point\\" in the life cycle of new words at about 30 to 50 years after their origin, they either enter the long-term lexicon or fall into disuse.\\"The New Science of the Birth and Death of Words \\", CHRISTOPHER SHEA, Wall Street Journal, March 16, 2012 Culturomic approaches have been taken in the analysis of newspaper content in a number of studies by I. Flaounas and co-authors. These studies showed macroscopic trends across different news outlets and countries. In 2012, a study of 2.5 million articles suggested that gender bias in news coverage depends on topic and how the readability of newspaper articles is related to topic. A separate study by the same researchers, covering 1.3 million articles from 27 countries, showed macroscopic patterns in the choice of stories to cover. In particular, countries made similar choices when they were related by economic, geographical and cultural links. The cultural links were revealed by the similarity in voting for the Eurovision song contest. This study was performed on a vast scale, by using statistical machine translation, text categorisation and information extraction techniques. The possibility to detect mood shifts in a vast population by analysing Twitter content was demonstrated in a study by T. Lansdall-Welfare and co-authors. The study considered 84 million tweets generated by more than 9.8 million users from the United Kingdom over a period of 31 months, showing how public sentiment in the UK has changed with the announcement of spending cuts. In a 2013 study by S Sudhahar and co-authors, the automatic parsing of textual corpora has enabled the extraction of actors and their relational networks on a vast scale, turning textual data into network data. The resulting networks, which can contain thousands of nodes, are then analysed by using tools from Network theory to identify the key actors, the key communities or parties, and general properties such as robustness or structural stability of the overall network, or centrality of certain nodes. In a 2014 study by T Lansdall-Welfare and co-authors, 5 million news articles were collected over 5 years and then analyzed to suggest a significant shift in sentiment relative to coverage of nuclear power, corresponding with the disaster of Fukushima. The study also extracted concepts that were associated with nuclear power before and after the disaster, explaining the change in sentiment with a change in narrative framing. In 2015, a study revealed the bias of the Google books data set, which \\"suffers from a number of limitations which make it an obscure mask of cultural popularity,\\" and calls into question the significance of many of the earlier results. Culturomic approaches can also contribute towards conservation science through a better understanding of human-nature relationships. In 2016, a publication by Richard Ladle and colleagues highlighted five key areas where culturomics can be used to advance the practice and science of conservation, including recognizing conservation- oriented constituencies and demonstrating public interest in nature, identifying conservation emblems, providing new metrics and tools for near- real-time environmental monitoring and to support conservation decision making, assessing the cultural impact of conservation interventions, and framing conservation issues and promoting public understanding. In 2017, a study correlated joint pain with Google search activity and temperature. While the study observed higher search activity for hip and knee pain (but not arthritis) during higher temperatures, it does not (and cannot) control for relevant other factors such as activity. Mass media misinterpreted this as \\"myth busted: rain does not increase joint pain\\", while the authors speculate the observed correlation is due to \\"changes in physical activity levels\\". Criticism Linguists and lexicographers have expressed skepticism regarding the methods and results of some of these studies, including one by Petersen et al.,\\"When physicists do linguistics\\", BEN ZIMMER, Boston Globe, February 10, 2013 while other have demonstrated bias in the Ngram data set, and their results \\"call into question the vast majority of existing claims drawn from the Google Books corpus,\\" and \\"instead of speaking about general linguistic or cultural change, it seems to be preferable to explicitly restrict the results to linguistic or cultural change ‚Äòas it is represented in the Google Ngram data‚Äô\\" because it is unclear what caused the observed change in the sample.

Portumna Castle is a semi-fortified house in Portumna, County Galway, Ireland. It was built in the early 17th century by the 4th Earl of Clanricarde, Richard Burke. Location Portumna Castle is located close to the shore of Lough Derg near where the River Shannon enters the lake. Portumna Abbey is to the east. History When it was built, Portumna Castle was without equal in Ireland at the time in style, grandeur and distinction, outshining castles at Rathfarnham, Kanturk, Carrickfergus, Charlemont and Burncourt. Its builder was Richard Burke, 4th Earl of Clanricarde, Lord President of Connaught, of the de Burgo family of Norman descent. The castle was built around 1610 to 1617 at a cost of ¬£10,000. The Earl also built a mansion, Somerhill House, Royal Tunbridge Wells in Kent. Portumna castle was built in the Renaissance style already prevalent in Italy and France for over a century, but not commonly found in Ireland or England at that time. The Renaissance features of the exterior are, strictly speaking, limited to the doorcase of the front entrance and the Tuscan gateway of the innermost courtyard, but the layout is an expression of Renaissance ideas. The castle is symmetrical in shape and consists of three stories over a basement with square corner projecting towers. The castle measures 29.7m by 21.2m and the corner towers are 6.5m square with gunports. A central corridor, 3m wide, runs longitudinally from top to bottom, supported by stone walls, which contain numerous recesses and fireplaces. The castle was abandoned as a home following a fire in 1826. The Office of Public Works has re-built the huge chimney stacks. The estate grounds contain walled gardens, gate lodges, gateposts and a yard.http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/search.jsp?type=record&county;=GA&regno;=30343048http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/search.jsp?type=record&county;=GA&regno;=30343038http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/search.jsp?type=record&county;=GA&regno;=30343037http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/search.jsp?type=record&county;=GA&regno;=30343036http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/search.jsp?type=record&county;=GA&regno;=30343039http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/search.jsp?type=record&county;=GA&regno;=30343050http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/search.jsp?type=record&county;=GA&regno;=30343051 See also * Flight of the Wild Geese References * Portumna Castle & its Lords, Michael Mac Mahon * Jacobite Ireland, J.G Simms. * A Short History of Ireland, J.C.

His academic work at the University of California at Davis is recognized internationally. His 16 books and some 400 articles contributed significantly to the development of the modern (post-Prohibition) wine industry in California; to the improvement of wine cultures in Europe, South America, and Australia; and to the professional standards for judging and tasting wine. In the early 1940s, he and his colleague Albert J. Winkler developed the Winkler scale, a technique for classifying wine growing regions based on temperatures, that continues to be used in the United States and elsewhere. His research, organizational, and advisory efforts in wine tasting helped bring about a more objective vocabulary to that field, based on flavors and scents rather than allusive references.Lawrence Osborne, The Accidental Connoisseur: An Irreverent Journey Through the Wine World (2004), pp. 130-131. Biography Amerine was born in 1911 in San Jose, California, the child of Roy Reagan Amerine and Tennessee Davis Amerine. He grew up on their farm in Modesto, California. In 1935, while still completing his Ph.D. in plant physiology at the University of California at Berkeley, he became the first faculty member hired into the new Viticulture and Enology Department at the University of California at Davis. He became full professor in 1952, was deemed All-University Lecturer in 1962, and continued his research and teaching at Davis until his retirement in 1974. He remained Professor Emeritus, served as an advisor at the Wine Institute in San Francisco, and continued to write, travel, and advise on wine production and evaluation nearly until his death in 1998. Amerine was featured on an episode of \\"To Tell the Truth\\" on the CBS television network in the 1960s accompanied by two impostors. Host Bud Collyer read a description of Amerine's work at UC Davis noting that his tasting class was \\"closed to undergraduates.\\" Amerine sat in the middle seat (No. 2). The panel for the show: Tom Poston, Kitty Carlisle, Don Ameche, Polly Bergen. (Bergen asked No. 3: \\"Where is the University of California, besides being in California?\\" No. 3 answered that the branch where he taught was in Davis, CA; Bergen seemed extremely dubious about this answer [i.e., not familiar with the fact that UC has a Davis campus, perhaps expecting \\"Berkeley\\" or \\"Los Angeles\\"].) None of the panelists chose the real Amerine; three votes went to No. 1 and one to No. 3. The first named professorship at the University of California was endowed in Amerine's honor, as the Maynard Amerine Chair, by Ernest Gallo (an early classmate of Amerine's). In 1991, the Maynard A. Amerine Room and Wine Collection in Shields Library was named in his honor and to house his extensive collection of books, a product of his years as a wine bibliographer and collector. His wine of choice was California zinfandel, according to his New York Times obituary (see link below). Selected publications * 1965. Wine, An Introduction. Revised edition 1975 with Vernon L.

The Institute provides hospitality management development courses and has its campus in S√∂renberg, Switzerland. Each semester the Institute has approximately 200 students from more than 35 nationalities to engage its range of programmes, of which a similar number of additional students will be concurrently undertaking work placements, supported by the school, in Switzerland and internationally to consolidate their academic training. Currently, the Hotel and Tourism Management Institute is organised into six centres: * The School of International Hotel and Tourism Management * The Centre for Career Management * The International Hospitality Research Centre Switzerland * The Centre for Culinary Management * The Centre for Events Management Training *The Student Service Centre The school has two main buildings in S√∂renberg which provide classrooms, training restaurants, accommodation and offices. These are Hotel Campus Mariental and Hotel Campus Panorama. History HTMi was established as a private hotel school in late 1990 in the UK where it began with a few students and moved from Scotland to Bournemouth. In 1999, it was unanimously decided that the School could not compete in the UK against the big Swiss hotel schools. In 1999, the management team planned a relocation strategy. Professor Robert Larmour launched HTMi in S√∂renberg, Switzerland. HTMi started with 16 students from two nationalities; now it has approximately 420 students in Switzerland from 35 nationalities. The Institute further enhanced its range of qualifications offered with the introduction of a BA degree from the University of Ulster, in 2004. This program ran until 2007, when it was replaced with BSc (Hons) International Hotel and Tourism Management, also validated and awarded by the University of Ulster. HTMi added a Masters level qualification to its portfolio in 2006 with the introduction of the MBA Hospitality, awarded by Queen Margaret University, Edinburgh. This was replaced in 2012 by the Master of Science in International Hospitality and Tourism Management, validated and awarded by Edinburgh Napier University. Mission The management development philosophy of the educational institute is captured in the given mission of HTMi: Come as a Student, Become a Manager. This statement provides the basis for an understanding of the holistic approach towards management training and education, whereby students are placed in an environment that matches that which would be found within the hospitality industry, in terms of professional behavior and professional image. Courses and Programmes The educational institute offers a number of courses, all taught in English, as follows: * Certificate in International Hotel and Tourism Operations * Diploma in International Hotel and Tourism Management * Higher Diploma in International Hotel and Tourism Management * Diploma in Training for Trainers in Hotel Management - Specialisation Course * BSc (Hons) International Hotel and Tourism Management (awarded by University of Ulster) * Advanced Diploma / PgD in European Baking and Pastry Arts - Specialisation Course * Postgraduate Diploma in International Hotel and Tourism Management * Postgraduate Diploma in Events Management * MA Hotel Business Management and MA Postgraduate Diploma in Hotel Business Management (Double Award) * MBA in Hospitality Management and MBA Postgraduate Diploma in Hospitality Management (Double Award) * Master's Dissertation Course * Joint Degree: MSc International Hospitality and Tourism Management (awarded by Edinburgh Napier University) & MBA in Hospitality Management and MBA Postgraduate Diploma in Hospitality Management (awarded by HTMi) (Triple Award) * Executive MBA in Hotel Management, includes Exec.

For example, in Switzerland this is carried out by the EDUQUA certification. In the UK, The Institute of Hospitality - IOH, formerly known as the HCIMA, requires a quinquennial resubmission of all the Degree and Sub-degree courses. This is subject to a panel-based review by specialists in the field. In addition, the British Accreditation Council also conducts a quinquennial review of the schools provision, via an onsite inspection. HTMi is also a member of the Swiss Private School Register. Sister School SHML Swiss College of Hospitality Lenk In 2015, SHML Swiss College of Hospitality Lenk has reached an agreement with HTMi that HTMi will merge SHML within its umbrella organization to operate SHML Lenk.

Subtitled Delici√¶ BasiliensesDeliciae Basilienses., it was first performed on 21 January 1947, by the chamber orchestra Basler Kammerorchester under Sacher. On the same program were the premieres of two other works commissioned by Sacher: Igor Stravinsky's Concerto in D and Bohuslav Martin≈Ø's Toccata e due Canzoni. Honegger's symphony, which contains musical quotations from two Basel folk songs, expresses the composer's happiness during a pleasant stay in the Swiss countryside after the end of World War II. Despite the pastoral and often joyous mood throughout much of the symphony, the closing minutes include some tragic or more serious elements. Honegger's Fourth Symphony is a three- movement work with a total running time of about 27 minutes. The movements are titled: # Lento e misterioso - Allegro (approx. 11'45\\") # Larghetto (approx. 6'15\\") # Allegro (approx. 8'30\\") This symphony is published by √âditions Salabert.
