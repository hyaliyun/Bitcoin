Later he was the first officer of the brig Margaret as an investment he and John Turnbull made in Turnbull and Co., John Turnbull being his second officer and a historian. Margaret, after some delay, left England on July 2, 1800, and sailing by way of the Cape of Good Hope, reached Sydney in February 1801. They reached the Society Islands in September 1802. After trading with various islands in the group, the ship sailed for the Hawaiian Islands, arriving at Oahu on December 17. After trading for salt at Oahu, Kauai, Niihau, and Hawaii island, Margaret sailed south on January 21, 1803. The ship sailed in among the Tuamotuan atolls and, on March 6, 1803, Nukutepipi, one of the Duke of Gloucester Islands, was visited and named Margaret Island, after the ship, though previously discovered in 1767. On March 10, Makemo was discovered and named Phillips Island, after a late sheriff of London, Sir Richard Phillips. On the same day, Taenga was discovered and named Holts Island. Some other islands were sighted but they had been previously discovered and were not landed on. Once in Tahiti, Turnbull set up an establishment ashore for buying pigs and salting them down with the salt obtained in the Hawaiian Islands. Margaret, under Buyers, set out to trade for hogs with the neighboring islands, but ran onto a reef in the Palliser Islands and was wrecked. Buyers and his crew, after considerable hardship, managed to reach Tahiti on a roughly constructed barge made of planks from the wreck. A ship which called at Tahiti afforded passage to Sydney for both Turnbull and Buyers. They left Sydney on 16 March 1804, in Calcutta and reached England via Cape Horn. Though a financial failure, the voyage obtained interesting information about the Society and Hawaiian Islands and the discovery of the islands Margaret, Phillips, and Holt in the Tuamotu Archipelago.

Thomas Stanley, 1st Earl of Derby, had the castle built in 1490 to provide defence for his estates around Garstang. He was also allowed to enclose a park and have in it 'free warren and chase'. The land on which the castle was built is said to be a gift to Stanley from his stepson Henry Tudor for his assistance in defeating Richard III at the Battle of Bosworth. In the 16th century John Leland described it as a 'pretty castle of the lords of Derby'. The castle stood on a small area of raised ground, about square and was rectangular with towers square at each corner. It was constructed of rubble and sandstone with angle quoins. The entrance was to the east on higher ground and there was probably a moat in the lower ground surrounding the castle. During the English Civil War the castle was garrisoned by James Stanley, 7th Earl of Derby in support of Charles I. It was one of the last two Royalist strongholds in Lancashire to succumb following a bitter siege during 1644/45 by Oliver Cromwell's forces. The other was Lathom. The siege was led by Colonel Dodding and Major Joseph Rigbie. The garrison at Greenhalgh Castle eventually surrendered in May 1645 provisional on their being granted safe conduct to return to their homes unharmed. Thereafter, demolition teams partially destroyed the castle to ensure that it could not be used again for military purposes. Following continued deterioration of the ruins, the only remains of the original four towers is the lower portion of one. Many of the local farmhouses, including the neighbouring Castle Farm which was built in the 17th century, have incorporated the stones from the castle ruins into their buildings. In 1772 Thomas Pennant described it as 'the poor remains of Greenhaugh Castle'. References Other sources *Collinson, E.

From Adalbert Seitz (ed.): Macrolepidoptera of the World (1915) \\"Catagramma\\" on plate 25 of Biologia Centrali-Americana \\"Catagramma\\" is an obsolete genus of Neotropical butterflies; the name continues to be used e.g. among butterfly collectors as a form taxon. \\"Catagramma\\" species are popularly known as 88s, in reference to a pattern on the hindwing undersides of many that looks like the number 88. They are medium-sized (around 5 cm (2 in) wingspan) forest insects. The genus once contained over 100 species, essentially being a \\"wastebin taxon\\" for what was then already recognized of the clade that became the tribe Callicorini in 1952. The members of \\"Catagramma\\" are now divided among the related genera Callicore, Catacore, Diaethria, Paulogramma and Perisama; others (like Cyclogramma) are not often considered distinct anymore however. These genera have been found to be close relatives of Antigonis and Haematera, which like them are in the Callicorini. Jean Baptiste Boisduval lumped this conspicuous group of Callicorini during his epic Lepidoptera reviews from the 1830s to 1850s. He ignored the generic names of previous authors, creating numerous junior subjective synonyms throughout, but was widely followed by subsequent sources. Frederick DuCane Godman and Osbert Salvin, for example, used the name Catagramma in the Biologia Centrali- Americana, establishing it for posterity. The type species of Catagramma is Catagramma hydaspes. Described in 1836 from new material by Boisduval, it belongs to the present genus Callicore. It is probably a junior subjective synonym of C. pygas, first validly described by Jean Baptiste Godart in 1924 as Nymphalis pygas.

The headquarters is in Durban. The original team was Paul Naude, Mike Larmont and Doug MacDonald. They set up shop in the rooftop of Larmont's surfboard factory, working nights while keeping their daytime jobs. Initially the magazine was tabloid-sized and released quarterly. In 1988 the magazine, struggling to make ends meet and with a full-time staff of one, was sold. Craig Sims and Rob van Wieringen, the new owners, teamed up until 1991. Sims soldiered on and in March 2007 Touchline Media bought Atoll Media. At the end of 2007 Sims passed the custodianship of the fourth oldest surfing magazine in the world to the Publisher/Editor partnership of John McCarthy and Will Bendix. McCarthy left less than a year later to start a rival magazine. Meanwhile, Zigzag continued under the guidance of the Editor, William Bendix, with a former Editor, Jeremy Saville, entering the fray in 2008 as the magazines brand manager. Due to the global economic recession and Publishing House handovers, 2008 and 2009 was a roller coaster period for the Title. The magazine had to negotiating major staff retrenchments and lacked a dedicated publisher to lead the magazine. Despite the major re-structuring, in 2009 Zigzag reached a celebratory milestone by printing its 200th issue. Later that year Zigzag beat other popular national magazines (boasting more than double and triple the circulation of Zigzag) by taking out the 2009 'Best Special Interest Magazine' at the prestigious annual PICA awards. The PICA's are regarded as the Academy Awards for South Africa's magazine publishers and the 'Special Interest' category one of their premier awards. Touchline Media was bought out by the largest media company in Africa, Media24 (Naspers), and Zigzag was moved around the company, first as a subsidiary of Famous Publishing (2010) and then from 2011 it was moved across to Media 24 Magazines until 2013. In October 2013 the magazine was acquired by Jingo Media, a content creation company that publishes South African creative culture magazine, Mahala, owned by Andy Davis, a regular Zigzag contributor. In so doing, Zigzag magazine moved back into the hands of an independent publisher and surfer.

Overview Kakolat waterfall, situated on the Kakolat hill, located on the border of Bihar and Jharkhand, just 33 km from Nawada and 4 km from Thali Bazar (the last turn leading to Kakolat waterfall). This is one of the most visited and renowned Bihar getaways, where tourists come from all over the states and adjoining areas to witness the sheer beauty of Mother Nature cascading marvelously. The Kakolat waterfall of Bihar cascades down from a height of between 150 and 160 feet and forms a natural reservoir at the base of the waterfall. Legends are also associated with the Kakolat waterfall such as, a Treta Yuga king was cursed to take the shape of a python and live at the falls here, by a Hindu spiritualist. The place was then visited by the Pandavas during their exile and it was during that time that the python king got rid of the curse, and he proclaimed that any person who bathed in the waterfall would never be reborn as a snake. Kakolat waterfall has become an increasingly popular tourist attraction in Bihar, where huge crowds can be seen during summers for weekend picnics. This waterfall also boats a wide variety of watersports and fun in the water. Apart from its significance as a tourist destination, the Kakolat waterfall is also widely visited at the time when a big fair is held on an occasion of bishua or chait Sankranti. This is basically a religious event accompanied with a three-day mela, where many devotees take their bath in the waterfall. The Kakolat waterfall has great historical and mythological significance. The waterfall is located near Govindpur police station, about 33 km away from Nawada, on Kakolat Hill. Below the falls there is a deep natural reservoir. The fall is approximately in height. The scene is panoramic due to all-round green forest area. Kakolat Fall is a popular tourist spot in Bihar. During the summer, people from all over India come to the falls for picnics. On 30 Dec 2018 honourable CM Nitish Kumar visited the Kakolat fall and announced various projects related to the development of renowned kakolat fall. During his visit he announced that a ropeway to be built to attract tourists. Role in Indian mythology According to legend, during the Treta Yuga epoch a king was cursed by a rishi and had to take the shape of a python and lived in Kakolat. The place was visited by the great Pandavas during their exile and the accursed king got salvation from damnation. The king after getting rid of the curse proclaimed that one who would bath in the waterfall will not take the yoni of snake, and that is why a large number of people from far and near bathe in the falls. A large festival is held at Kakolat on the occasion of Baisakhi or Chait Shankranti.

The protocol was defined within the GridFTP working group of the Open Grid Forum. There are multiple implementations of the protocol; the most widely used is that provided by the Globus Toolkit. The aim of GridFTP is to provide a more reliable and high performance file transfer, for example to enable the transmission of very large files. GridFTP is used extensively within large science projects such as the Large Hadron Collider and by many supercomputer centers and other scientific facilities. GridFTP also addresses the problem of incompatibility between storage and access systems. Previously, each data provider would make their data available in their own specific way, providing a library of access functions. This made it difficult to obtain data from multiple sources, requiring a different access method for each, and thus dividing the total available data into partitions. GridFTP provides a uniform way of accessing the data, encompassing functions from all the different modes of access, building on and extending the universally accepted FTP standard. FTP was chosen as a basis for it because of its widespread use, and because it has a well defined architecture for extensions to the protocol (which may be dynamically discovered). Numerous GridFTP clients have been developed. The Globus Online software-as-a-service system is particularly popular.  Features of GridFTP  GridFTP integrates with the Grid Security Infrastructure, which provides authentication and encryption to file transfers, with user-specified levels of confidentiality and data integrity, also for cross-server transfers (what FTP calls the File eXchange Protocol, FXP). GridFTP achieves much greater use of bandwidth than conventional data stream technology by using multiple simultaneous TCP streams. Files can be downloaded in pieces simultaneously from multiple sources; or even in separate parallel streams from the same source, which is still able to make better use of the bandwidth. Striped and interleaved transfers, again either from multiple or single sources, allow further speed increases. Although FTP has the ability to resume an interrupted file transfer from a specific point in a file, it does not support the transmission of only a certain portion of a file. GridFTP allows a subset of a file to be sent. Such a feature is useful in applications where only small sections of a very large data file are required for processing (a motivating example being the processing of data from a high energy physics experiment, a traditional use of Grid technology). GridFTP provides a fault tolerant implementation of FTP, to handle network unavailability and server problems. Transfers can also be automatically restarted if a problem occurs. The underlying TCP connection in FTP has numerous settings such as window size and buffer size. GridFTP allows automatic (or manual) negotiation of these settings to provide optimal transfer speeds and reliability (optimal settings are likely to be different with large files and for large groups of files).

Dunnell was born in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk and educated at Rossall School. He was admitted a solicitor in 1891 and joined the Solicitor's Department of the North Eastern Railway Company. He became assistant solicitor to the company in 1900, solicitor in 1905, and also secretary to the company in 1906. In 1917 he was appointed Assistant Secretary to the Admiralty and the following year served as secretary to the British Naval Mission to the United States under Sir Eric Geddes. At the end of the First World War he became secretary of the demobilisation section of the War Cabinet and in 1919 first secretary and solicitor to the new Ministry of Transport. In 1919 he was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB). In 1921 he returned to his old company, which amalgamated into the London and North Eastern Railway Company in 1923, as chief legal adviser. In December 1921 it was announced that he would be created a baronet for his services to the Ministry of Transport, with the creation being 11 January 1922. He retired in 1928, but in April 1930 was appointed a Railway and Canal Commissioner. In 1947 he moved to Nairobi, Kenya, where he died. His wife Ruby (n√©e Garrett) had died in 1901, after only four years of childless marriage, and the baronetcy thus became extinct upon his death.

She is a pioneer in the study of gender in film. In 1974, Doane received a B.A. in English from Cornell University and in 1979, earned her Ph.D. in Speech and Dramatic Art from the University of Iowa. Doane specializes in film theory, feminist theory and semiotics, and she joined the UC Berkeley Film and Media faculty in the fall of 2011.  As a film theorist  Doane is best known for her collection of essays Femmes Fatales: Feminism, Film Theory, Psychoanalysis. The essays in this book examine the ways in which women are misrepresented and alienated in films. The articles have appeared in academic journals such as Screen, Discourse, Camera Obscura, and the anthology Psychoanalysis and Cinema. Doane argues that Classical Hollywood cinema was produced, moderated, and controlled by the male spectator's views. Thus, most of the female characters are a representation of their desires or fears. She gives the example of the femme fatale, a female stock character that often appears in the film noir genre. The femme fatale is often portrayed as an evil force trying to deceive the male protagonist, and she is usually punished or killed because of this. Doane claims this is a \\"desperate reassertion of control on the part of the threatened male subject.\\" This is debated among film theorists, but Doane argues that the femme fatale is not an empowered female character. She is a projection of masculine insecurities and should not be viewed as a character with agency. In Film and the Masquerade: Theorising the Female Spectator, Doane agrees with Laura Mulvey on cinema catering to male pleasures and the male gaze. She argues that women are too close to the object of the gaze; they struggle between feminine and masculine viewing positions, ‚Äúinvoking the metaphor of the transvestite.‚Äù As a result of having to adopt male viewpoints, women are more fluid in terms of sexuality and gender. Women must \\"'masculinize' their spectatorship\\" to avoid masochism (from over-identification) or narcissism (from becoming their own object of desire), and because of this, Doane claims \\"womanliness is a mask which can be worn and removed\\". Doane has also written, published, and co-edited numerous other articles and books, including The Desire to Desire: The Woman's Films of the 1940s and The Emergence of Cinematic Time: Modernity, Contingency, the Archive.Doane, Mary Ann (2002). \\"The Emergence of Cinematic Time: Modernity, Contingency, the Archive\\", Harvard University Press, Cambridge. .  Awards  In 1990, Doane won the Guggenheim Fellowship for Humanities, U.S. and Canada for her work in film, video, and radio studies. In 2016 she was a fellow at the American Academy in Berlin. Also, her book, The Emergence of Cinematic Time: Modernity, Contingency, the Archive, won the Limina award.

It is in essence an amalgam of contract law, commercial law, planning law, employment law and tort. Construction law covers a wide range of legal issues including contract, negligence, bonds and bonding, guarantees and sureties, liens and other security interests, tendering, construction claims, and related consultancy contracts. Construction law affects many participants in the construction industry, including financial institutions, surveyors, quantity surveyors, architects, builders, engineers, construction workers, and planners. Specific practice areas Construction law builds upon general legal principles and methodologies and incorporates the regulatory framework (including security of payment, planning, environmental and building regulations); contract methodologies and selection (including traditional and alternative forms of contracting); subcontract issues; causes of action, and liability, arising in contract, negligence and on other grounds; insurance and performance security; dispute resolution and avoidance. Construction law has evolved into a practice discipline in its own right, distinct from its traditional locations as a subpractice of project finance, real estate or corporate law. There are often strong links between construction law and energy law and oil and gas law. Some of the major areas a construction lawyer covers are: *Alternative Dispute Resolutions **Arbitration **Dispute Review Boards (or other third party reviews) **Mediation **Structured negotiations *Bankruptcy issues for contractors, owners, suppliers, etc. *Bidding (tendering) disputes *Building and other permits *Building information modeling *Contract law **Change Orders (Variations) **Construction claims **Construction liens **Wage requirements (Davis-Bacon Act, etc.) **Payment and Prompt payments acts **Extensions of time **Drafting construction contracts **Industry-standard construction contracts **Negotiating construction contracts **Negotiating a termination claim, whether for convenience or for default *Defective design or construction *Delays and acceleration *Employment Law including Immigration *Environmental matters in construction *False Claims Act(s) *Fire codes and regulations *Fulfilling regulations for non- discrimination or other social impact legislation *Insurances issues **Damage, liability **Indemnification **Surety Law (Payment and Performance Bonds) *Labor issues and strikes *Licensing construction professionals *OSHA, and other federal agencies *Overinspection *Project delivery systems, such as design-bid-build, Design-Build, Construction Manager (CM) at Risk or Agency CM *Provide defense to businesses facing administrative actions such as delisting (loss of bid listing) *Provide legal counsel *Public construction **Federal construction under FAR or other regulated procurements **State contracting procedures *State and local building codes *Sustainable construction, e.g. LEED *Litigation: trying construction cases in court *Violations, safety or other regulatory Country specific practice =United Kingdom= In the United Kingdom, there has been an active Society of Construction Law since 1983, and there is now a European Society of Construction Law, and Societies of Construction Law in Australia, Hong Kong, Singapore, and the UAE. The Joint Contracts Tribunal works on the most popular type of standard construction contracts and the latest suite of contracts from the JCT are the 2016 editions. The form of contract most favoured by public bodies is the NEC contract suite. Although some see Construction Law as another form of general contract law, it is a very specialised area and most people requiring advice on construction law in the UK would seek advice from construction law specialists. =Canada= In Canada, the law requires money for work done to be paid in trust. =United States= The Forum on Construction Law of the American Bar Association established in 1973 is the largest organization of construction lawyers in the United States. The group includes law firms of every size, solo practitioners, in-house and government counsel, non-lawyers such as, construction professionals and the public sector representatives. Forum members include those of owners, developers, design professionals, contractors, subcontractors, suppliers, construction managers, lenders, insurers and sureties. Standard form contracts promulgated by the American Institute of Architects have been the standard in the industry (insofar as building construction); the organization first published a form in 1888, and has over 200 forms, with revisions to selected forms happening typically every ten years.Klinger M. (2007). A New Era in Standard Form Construction Documents: a Rivalry Between the Old Guard American Institute of Architects And An Upstart Consortium Led by the Associated General Contractors of America. Sedgwick, Detert, Moran & Arnold LLP. However, these forms have been criticized as unfair to contractors in favor of owners and architects, which led to the publication of ConsensusDocs standard contracts in September 2007. The ConsensusDocs Coalition includes 41 trade associations representing design professionals, owners, contractors, subcontractors and sureties in the design and construction industry. ConsensusDocs publishes more than 100 contract documents, addressing all methods of project delivery, and are written in the project's best interest versus one particular party. Engineering lead projects such as horizontal infrastructure use other standard form contracts such as those developed by the Engineers Joint Contract Documents Committee. Recently several other organizations have developed contracts for use such as the CMAA (for projects using agency CM) and the Design-Build Institute of America for projects using design-build. =South Africa= The standard form construction law contracts, in use in South Africa, include FIDIC, NEC, GCC and JBCC agreements. Construction contracts Although no special contract formalities are required, it is normal practice to use standard-form contracts such as, in the UK, the JCT form. In order to expedite dispute resolution, standard forms have often provided for arbitration by a \\"board of arbitration\\" or professional arbitrator, although many now offer a choice between arbitration and litigation. Construction law has been affected by the requirements in public contracts, which include surety bonds and other procedures. In private contracts, the requirements are negotiated between the parties. As of 1998, the principles of construction law were \\"well established\\". Remedies for breach of contract are the same as in the ordinary law, and include damages, repudiation, rescission, and specific performance. In the UK, specific requirements relating to payments and adjudication provisions were introduced by the Housing Grants, Construction and Regeneration Act 1996 and were subsequently amended in Part 8 of the Local Democracy, Economic Development and Construction Act. These requirements are generally known as the Construction Act requirements. The requirements set out certain minimum provisions which must be included in any construction contract (as defined within the Act) and failure to comply with these requirements will cause the relevant provisions to be deleted and compliant provisions to be inserted in their place, which can lead to unexpected consequences for unsuspecting parties to a construction contract. =Deviation= When a plan has been adopted for a building, and in the progress of the work a change is made from the original plan, the change is called a \\"deviation\\". \\"Deviation\\" is a concept borrowed from both Insurance law and the Law of Carriage of Goods by Sea, and cases such as Glynn v Margetson and Leduc v Ward. When the contract is to build a house according to the original plan, and a deviation takes place, the contract shall be traced as far as possible, and the additions, if any have been made, shall be paid for according to the usual rate of charging.See also St Paul Fire and Marine v McConnell [1995] 2 LLR 116 CA, where contractors failed to inform insurers of a signification change to the specified foundations; (the builders failed to install piles, as the plans had required).

With regard to the Hebrew texts, the glosses chiefly contained explanations of purely verbal difficulties of the text; some of these glosses are of importance for the correct reading or understanding of the original Hebrew, while nearly all have contributed to its uniform transmission since the 11th century. Later on, Christian glosses also contained scriptural commentaries; St. Jerome extensively used glosses in the process of translation of the Latin Vulgate Bible. Etymology The English word gloss is derived from the Latin glossa, a transcript of the Greek glossa. In classical Greek it means a tongue or language. In the course of time it was used to designate first a word of the text which needed some explanation, and later the explanation or addition itself. Explanatory glosses The words which were commonly the subject of explanatory glosses may be reduced to the following five classes: * foreign words; * provincial dialectical terms; * obsolete words; * technical terms; or * words employed in some unusual sense or in some peculiar grammatical form. Where these glosses consisted of a single explanatory word, they were easily written between the lines of the text or in the margin of manuscripts opposite the words of which they supplied the explanation. In the process of time the glosses grew in number, and in consequence they were gathered in separate books where they appeared, first in the same order of succession as they would have had if written in the margin of the codices, and ultimately in a regular alphabetical order. These collections of glosses thus formed kinds of lexicons which gave the concrete meaning of the difficult words of the text and even historical, geographical, biographical, and other notices, which the collectors deemed necessary or useful to illustrate the text of sacred writings. A lexicon of the kind is usually called a glossary (from Lat. glossarium), or just \\"gloss\\". From a single explanatory word, interlined or placed in the margin, the word gloss has been extended to denote an entire expository sentence, and in many instances even a running commentary on an entire book. Glosses as marginal notes Marginal notes are found in nearly all manuscripts and printed editions of the Scriptures. With regard to the Hebrew text, these glosses or marginal notes are mostly extracts from the Masorah or collection of traditional remarks. They usually bear on what was regarded as a questionable reading or spelling in the text, but yet was allowed to remain unmodified in the text itself through respect for its actual form. At times the margin bids the reader to transpose, interchange, restore, or remove a consonant, while at other times it directs him to omit or insert even an entire word. Some of these glosses are of importance for the correct reading or understanding of the original Hebrew, while nearly all have contributed to its uniform transmission since the 11th century. The marginal notes of Greek and Latin manuscripts are annotations of all kinds, chiefly the results of exegetical and critical study, crowding the margins of these copies and printed texts far more than those of the manuscripts and editions of the original Hebrew. In regard to the Latin Vulgate, in particular, these glosses grew to so many textual readings that Pope Sixtus V, when publishing his official edition of the Vulgate in 1588, decreed that henceforth copies of it should not be supplied with such variations recorded in the margin. The Douay Version respected this idea. James I of England wanted the Authorized Version to be free of marginal notes, but it appeared in 1611 with such notes, usually recording various readings. The glosses or marginal notes of the British Revised Version published 1881-85, are greatly in excess over those of the Version of 1611. They give various readings, alternate renderings, critical remarks, etc. The marginal notes of the American Standard Revised Version (1900‚Äì1901) are of the same general description as those found in the British Revised Version. Glosses as textual additions =Hebrew Bible= The word gloss designates not only marginal notes, but also words or remarks inserted for various reasons in the very text of the Scriptures. The existence of such textual additions in the Bible is universally admitted by Biblical scholars with regard to the Hebrew text, although there is at times considerable disagreement as to the actual expressions that should be treated as such. Besides the eighteen corrections of the Scribes which ancient Rabbis regard as made in the Tanakh before their time, and which were probably due to the fact that marginal explanations had of old been embodied in the text itself, recent scholars have treated as textual additions many words and expressions scattered throughout the Hebrew Bible. Thus the defenders of the Mosaic authorship of the Pentateuch naturally maintain that the more or less extensive notices found in the Mosaic writings and relative to matters geographical, historical, etc., decidedly later than Moses' time, should be regarded as post-Mosaic textual additions. Others, struck with the lack of smoothness of style noticeable in several passages of the original Hebrew, or with the apparent inconsistencies in its parallel statements, have appealed to textual additions as offering a natural and adequate explanation of the facts observed. Some have even admitted the view that Midrashim, or kinds of Jewish commentaries, were at an early date utilized in the framing or in the transcription of our present Hebrew text, and thus would account for what they consider as actual and extensive additions to its primitive form. By means of the literary feature known as \\"parallelism\\" in Hebrew poetry, many textual additions may be suspected in the Hebrew text of the poetical books, notably in the Book of Job. The presence of similar textual additions in the text of the Septuagint, or oldest Greek translation of the Old Testament, was well known to the Roman editors of that version under Sixtus V. One has only to compare attentively the words of that ancient version with those of the original Hebrew to remain convinced that the Septuagint translators have time and again deliberately deviated from the text which they rendered into Greek, and thus made a number of more or less important additions thereunto. These translators frequently manifest a desire to supply what the original had omitted or to clear up what appeared ambiguous. Frequently, too, they adopt paraphrastic renderings to avoid the most marked anthropomorphisms of the text before them: while at times they seem to be guided in their additions by the Halacha and Haggadah. =New Testament= Glosses as textual additions exist also in manuscripts of the New Testament, owing to a variety of reasons, the principal among which may be: # Copyists have embedded marginal notes in the text itself; # they have at times supplemented the words of an Evangelist by means of the parallel passages in the other Gospels; and # sometimes they have completed New Testament's quotations from the Old Testament. =Vulgate versions= Textual additions appear in the manuscripts and printed editions of the Latin Vulgate. Its author, St. Jerome, freely inserted in his rendering of the original Hebrew historical, geographical and doctrinal remarks he thought necessary for the understanding of Scriptural passages by ordinary readers. Nevertheless, he complains at times that during his own life copyists, instead of faithfully transcribing his translation, embodied in the text notes found in the margin. After his death manuscripts of the Vulgate, especially those of the Spanish type, were enriched with all kinds of additional readings, which, together with other textual variations embodied in early printed copies of the Vulgate, led ultimately to the official editions of Jerome's work by Pope Sixtus V and Pope Clement VIII. Glosses as scriptural lexicons Rabbinical Tanakh commentaries contain collections of glosses, or \\"glossaries\\", with chief object to supply explanations of Hebrew words. A part of the Masorah may also be considered as a kind of glossary to the Hebrew Bible; and the same thing may be said in reference to the collections of Oriental and Western readings given in the sixth volume of the London Polyglot. As regards the Greek Bible texts, there are no separate collections of glosses; yet these texts are taken into account, together with the rest of the Greek literature, in a certain number of glossaries which afford explanations of difficult words in the Greek language. The following are the principal glossaries of that description: * the lexicon of Hesychius, of the 4th century; * the \\"Lexeon synagoge\\" (collection of glosses) of Photius (died 891); * the lexicon of Suidas, apparently an author of the 10th century; * the \\"Etymologicum Magnum\\" by an unknown writer of the twelfth or the 13th century; * the \\"Synagoge lexeon\\" of the Byzantine monk Zonaras; * the \\"Dictionarium\\" of the Benedictine Varius Phavorinus, published early in the 16th century. Most of the glosses illustrating the language of Scripture which are found in the works of Hesychius, Suidas, Phavorinus, and in the \\"Etymologium Magnum\\", were collected and published by J. C. Ernesti (Leipzig, 1785‚Äì86). The best separate gloss on the Latin Vulgate, as a collection of explanations chiefly of its words, is that of Isidore of Seville, which he completed in 632, and which bears the title of \\"Originum sive Etymologiarum libri XX\\". It is found in Migne, P. L., LXXXII. Glosses as commentaries As Scriptural commentaries there are two celebrated glosses on the Vulgate. The former is the Glossa Ordinaria, thus called from its common use during the Middle Ages. Its author, who was believed to be the German Walafrid Strabo (died 849), had some knowledge of Greek and made extracts chiefly from the Latin Fathers and from the writings of his master, Rabanus Maurus, for the purpose of illustrating the various senses‚Äîprincipally the literal sense‚Äîof all the books of Holy Writ. This gloss is quoted as a high authority by Petrus Lombardus and Thomas Aquinas, and it was known as \\"the tongue of Scripture\\". Until the 17th century it remained the favourite commentary on the Bible; and it was only gradually superseded by more independent works of exegesis. The \\"Glossa Ordinaria\\" is found in vols. CXIII and CXIV of Migne, P. L. The second gloss, the Glossa Interlinearis, derived its name from the fact that it was written over the words in the text of the Vulgate. It was the work of Anselm of Laon (died 1117), who had some acquaintance with Hebrew and Greek. After the 12th century copies of the Vulgate were usually supplied with both these glosses, the \\"Glossa Ordinaria\\" being inserted in the margin, at the top and at the sides, and the \\"Glossa Interlinearis\\" being placed between the lines of the Vulgate text; while later, from the 14th century onward, the \\"Postilla\\" of Nicholas of Lyra and the \\"Additions\\" of Paulus Burgensis were added at the foot of each page. Some early printed editions of the Vulgate exhibit all this exegetical apparatus; and the latest and best among them is the one by Leander a S. Martino, O.S.B. (six vols. fol., Antwerp, 1634).

Truss Project Arts Centre Ltd, Dublin, 32 pp. Essay by Medb Ruane. ISBN No. 1 872493 05 X For her contribution to sculpture and the Arts in Ireland, MacDonagh was elected in 2004 to Aosd√°na, the Irish organisation that recognises artists that have contributed a unique body of work. Background \\"Eileen MacDonagh's sculptures are candid, direct and ultimately rational. They spring from a harmonious and human-centered vision which seeks to charge natural materials with an aesthetic significance governed always by principles of clarity and formal coherence. Their major analogues derive from architecture and from craft... though never minimalist, the sculptures can sometimes be minimal, working to achieve a sort of meditative stillness where every details counts.\\" ‚ÄîMedh Ruane. MacDonagh's work has featured in many exhibitions, both in Ireland and abroad, including shows in Portugal, Scotland, India and Japan. Eileen has both organised and participated in the International Sculpture Symposium movement, in Ireland and abroad; her work is included in numerous collections, such as the Irish Office of Public Works (OPW), the Lough Boora Sculpture in the Parklands, Co. Offaly, Kilkenny and Cork County Councils, Marlay Park, Dublin and Tawara Newtown, Osaka, Japan. MacDonagh works mainly in stone to produce large-scale sculptures. Due to the scale of her work, she has tended to concentrate on public art commissions although she has also exhibited in the context of the gallery exhibitions. She received a Diploma in Sculpture at the School of Art, Regional Technical College, Sligo, Ireland (1974‚Äì79) and an Art Teachers Certificate from the Limerick School of Art & Design (1979‚Äì80). MacDonagh's first solo exhibition in 1992,Truss, showed large-scale works made from both wood and stone. MacDonagh has continued through her career as a sculptor taking on large-scale projects, and has built up a large body of public art since across Ireland and in other countries. Catherine Marshall, head of collections at Irish Museum of Modern Art, wrote in 2005 that: \\"when MacDonagh talks about granite and limestone her language takes on a new dimension, introducing the listener to colour, texture, density and ultimately to the processes that working with them involve. 'Granite is the noblest of stones', she says, 'just the toughness of it. Every time you strike the stone you make fire. Granite is volcanic, it was born of fire and you need fire to form it.' She loves the challenge of working on a large scale, coaxing her vision out of unyielding, resistant stone. The circularity of the process, appeals to her sense of the invisible order that is a hall- mark of her work'.\\"Woods, Suzanne and Marshall, Catherine. 2005. Eileen MacDonagh: Another Constellation. Model Arts and Niland Gallery . 24 pp MacDonagh is deeply influenced by books such as Robert Lawlor's Sacred Geometry and Fritjof Kapra's The Tao of Physics in which formal patterns are linked to ideas, religions and to the physical make-up of the universe. She has investigated the colour, texture and density of granite and limestone, as well as the challenge of working on a large scale. In recent years she has undertaken large-scale public works in stainless steel ‚Äì The Medusa Tree (2009) for VISUAL, The Contemporary Art Centre, Carlow and ‚Äì The Tallaght Cross (2008). Many of MacDonagh's sculptures examines a fascination with geometry. She has long been inspired by the purity and ubiquity of geometric principles and the way in which geometric rules govern the universe. Her 2008 Fire from Stone show at the Centre Culturel Irlandais featured four major installations, the largest of which was composed of fifteen pieces of differing size. The individual pieces were based on icosahedral forms, a complex geometric shape, and are carved from over ten different types of Indian granite. They ranged in size from 4-foot in diameter to just 4 inches, and were all created when MacDonagh was on a residency in India. Career In February 2012 MacDonagh will be showcasing new original works alongside past works in a Retrospective Exhibition of her work at VISUAL, the Centre for Contemporary Art, Carlow, Ireland. The show is called Lithosphere, opening 5 Feb 2012 at 3pm.

It starred actress Judy Ann Santos and was directed by Dante Nico Garcia, who won Best Director at the 2008 Asian Festival of First Films. Filming was done in the municipality of Cuyo in Palawan, Garcia's hometown. The film was the official entry of the Philippines for Best Foreign Language Film at the 81st Academy Awards. Synopsis In the present, a mysterious Taiwanese fisherman, Muo Sei, lands in the town of Cuyo, Palawan beside the sea where he immediately looks for someone named \\"Ploning\\". In a flashback to some years ago, Ploning is known as a hardworking and thoughtful woman who, despite her age and beauty, decided not to marry. She had loved a man named Tomas fourteen years ago who left for a better life in Manila leaving her heartbroken and pining for his return. Despite this, Ploning continues her roles as a dutiful daughter to the town patriarch Susing and to Tomas' grieving mother Intang, a compassionate friend to outsider Alma, and a caretaker of the invalid Juaning, whose son Digo she has taken under her care as well. Ploning however, decides to leave their peaceful life to look for Tomas in Manila. Digo, overcome by grief, seeks help in the town guest, the nurse Celeste, whom they learn also had a lover named Tomas back in Manila. Due to her deep devotion, Ploning rejects the notion that this Tomas and her Tomas are the same person. On the day Ploning disappears, rain falls on Cuyo who has been suffering a dry season. Muo Sei is later revealed to be Digo, and the townspeople who are leading the town are the people Ploning helped back then. Cast * Judy Ann Santos * Cedric Amit * Mylene Dizon * Bodjong Fernandez * Gina Pare√±o * Eugene Domingo Production An aerial view of the Cuyo archipelago. The filming of Ploning was entirely done on the municipality of Cuyo in Palawan. It was directed by Dante Nico Garcia, who incidentally, is a native of the town. According to him, the film is based on his childhood memories of the town. When he wrote the screenplay for the film with Benjamin Lingan, he decided to use his native tongue, Cuyonon. He had stated that the inspiration for the character Judy Ann Santos played in the film is based on a Cuyonon folk song about a girl's hidden feelings, originally sung by a male but was first recorded by a female. This led him to think of a story of a woman singing the song while remembering her lover. (Tagalog) Shooting of the film was done in various locales of the town. This includes the pier, the waiting place of Ploning; and Intigan beach. The basketball court, meanwhile, provided for a setting for the first meeting between Digo and Celeste, while Emilod was the location for the esposada (bridal shower), which took three nights to shoot. A cemetery was purposely built for the film and the locals decided to preserve it as a tourist attraction. The film was produced by Panoramamanila Pictures Co., which, despite its fledgeling status, tried its best to authenticate the production of the film. Cashew nut brittle, the town's delicacy, as well as the harvesting of salt in an asinan was showcased in the film. Cuyo's Pagdayao Festival, an Ati-atihan-like celebration usually celebrated on August 27, was also featured as the town fiesta. =Cast= The cast of Ploning is played by veteran actors as well as newcomers to show business. Veteran actress Judy Ann Santos got the title role. Compared to her other roles, which are very dramatic (particularly that of Mara in Mara Clara), her character in the film is seen as mellow and reserved. Numerous comediennes are also cast in the film, such as Gina Pare√±o (as Intang), Eugene Domingo (as Juaning), Ces Quesada (as Nieves), and Tessie Tomas (as Seling), whose dramatic performances seem weird in contrast to Santos'. The role of Celeste is supposed to have been given to Iza Calzado but Mylene Dizon took the role instead when scheduling conflicts between the film and Joaquin Bordado were not resolved. (Tagalog) Other cast members include newcomers Lukas Agustin (as Siloy), Ogoy Agustin (as Veiling), Cedric Amit (as Digo), and Bodjong Fernandez (as Mou Sei) as well as established actors Ketchup Eusebio (as Badocdoc), Ronnie Lazaro (as Old Veiling), Jojit Lorenzo (as Basit), Tony Mabesa (as Susing), Spanky Manikan (as Tsuy), Crispin Pi√±eda (as Toting), Meryl Soriano (as Alma), Beth Tamayo (as Divina), and Joel Torre (as Mayor Siloy). =Inspiration= The inspiration for the film came from the folk song \\"Ploning.\\" A fragment is shown below: { cellpadding=6 - !

The film was shown during the 6th Paris Cinema International Film Festival on July 5, 2008, as part of a showcase which featured Filipino films such as Himala and Kubrador. It was then seen in the Hong Kong Asian Independent Film Festival on November 16 and 21 and the 39th International Film Festival of India on November 28 and 30, 2008. (Chinese) Before 2008 ended, Ploning premiered at the Asian Festival of First Films in Singapore on December 9, where it received a Best Director award and a Best Screenplay/Script nomination. In the United States, Ploning was shown during the 20th Palm Springs International Film Festival held in Palm Springs, California on January 12 and 13, 2009, with lead star Judy Ann Santos and director Dante Nico Garcia in attendance. It was part of the For Your Consideration program at the Christopher B. Smith Rafael Film Center in Rafael, California, where it was screened on January 18, 2009 with director Garcia in attendance. It was then seen at the 10th Newport Beach Film Festival in Newport Beach, California on April 26, 2009. DVDs and VCDs of the film were released during the Christmas season by GMA Records and Home Video. These contain the film as well as bonus features such as the trailer and behind the scenes productions. There are Tagalog/Filipino subtitles but no English subtitles. Reception The Cinema Evaluation Board (CEB) graded Ploning with an \\"A\\" evaluation, entitling it to a 100% tax rebate on its earnings. (Tagalog) Meanwhile, the Movie and Television Review and Classification Board (MTRCB) gave it a \\"General Patronage\\" rating. After it was officially selected for the Academy Awards, it was reported that the Philippine government had given one million pesos (twenty thousand US dollars) in support of the film. Various celebrities were also noted to have supported the film. (Tagalog) (Tagalog) The film gained critical praise after Dante Nico Garcia won the Best Director award while he and Benjamin Lingan were nominated for the Best Screenplay award during the Asian Festival of First Film Awards in Singapore. (Polish) Judy Ann Santos, the film's star, was involved in a minor controversy when her home network, ABS-CBN, refused to promote Ploning and instead chose to promote the film When Love Begins. (Tagalog) This led to disputes between her manager, Alfie Lorenzo, and the network though both parties have since reconciled. (Tagalog) In August 2008, she returned to Cuyo to grace the screenings and was awarded as the town's \\"adopted daughter.\\" Ploning's road to the Oscars ended when the Top 9 shortlisted entries (later narrowed to the Final 5) for the Best Foreign Language Film category was announced but the team behind Ploning remained positive and appreciative of the experience. On January 18, 2009, ABS-CBN aired the primetime television special Pangarap ni Ploning (Dream of Ploning), which chronicled the fundraising events mounted to finance the lobbying efforts for the film's Oscar bid. Then, on February 22, 2009, lead star Judy Ann Santos and director Dante Nico Garcia launched the Ploning Foundation to help future filmmakers raise funds for the promotion of the chosen Philippine entry similar to what they did for Ploning.

The film was written and directed by British film director Joshua Newton. It stars Roy Scheider, in his final film after he died in February 2008 before his filming was completed. The film was shot in 2007, production completed in 2008, had a preview showing in 2009, premiered at the 26th Boston Film Festival in 2010, and had a limited release in 2011. Plot Joseph is a retired NYPD cop and Holocaust survivor. He travels to Nuremberg to visit his son Ronnie years after turning his back on him for rejecting a promising career in the NYPD and marrying a local artist, Anna. No sooner does Joseph attempt to heal the rift with Ronnie than he swears that an elderly man living in Ronnie's building, under the false name of Shrager, is the Nazi SS Commander who slaughtered his entire family during World War II. With little hope of seeing him stand trial, Joseph talks Ronnie into exacting justice - and vengeance - and together they set out to kill him. Flashbacks reveal the teenage love of Young Joseph for a heroic Polish girl, Kashka, and his narrow escape from the massacre, leading to the film's climax. Cast * Roy Scheider as Joseph ** Alexander Newton as Young Joseph * Scott Cohen as Ronnie * Helmut Berger as Shrager / Vogler * Calita Rainford as Anna * M√≥nica Cruz as Gaby * Sarah Bolger as Kashka * Enrique Arce as Guillermo * Anna Polony as Frau Ganz Production Newton developed the script from a concept involving his father, Bruno Newton. Joshua asked himself what his father would do in the event that he discovered the man who murdered his family during the Holocaust. The character of Joseph, played by Roy Scheider, is loosely based on Bruno Newton. Alexander Newton, son of Joshua and grandson of Bruno, played the character of Joseph as a youngster during World War II. Bruno Newton died during filming from the same disease that took Roy Scheider's life nine months later, Multiple myeloma. As Scheider died before production was finished, some of his scenes were completed utilizing CGI techniques. Accolades The film had a week-long qualifying run in Los Angeles, for awards consideration. It later aired at the 26th Boston Film Festival in September 2010, where director Joshua Newton won the Visionary Filmmaker Award. His son, Alexander, won the festival's prize for Best Young Actor for his portrayal of the young Joseph.https://www.forbes.com/feeds/prnewswire/2010/09/20/prnewswire201009200756PR_NEWS_USPR_____NE67551.html On 15 November 2010, the film received the Remembrance Award at the Museum of Tolerance International Film Festival in Los Angeles. Rabbi Marvin Hier, Founder and Dean of the Museum of Tolerance and the Simon Wiesenthal Center, called the picture \\"The most important film since Schindler's List\\". Box Office Pro magazine's Pete Hammond gave the film a favourable review, writing \\"What he's achieved here is a beautifully crafted movie likely to have audiences talking long afterward, especially considering the twist ending that left the audience I previewed the film with buzzing.\\" Oscar campaign lawsuit In the summer of 2009, Variety editor Tim Grey listed Iron Cross, among about 50 other films, as a potential Academy Awards nominee. The magazine's sales staff, apparently acting independent of the editorial staff, contacted Joshua Newton that same day, signing him to a $400,000 ($ today) Oscar ad campaign. The November 2009 Oscar ad campaign was undercut after the film had a week-long, unadvertised, Oscar qualifying run in Los Angeles in December 2009. A review from that run, published by Variety's editorial staff, was quite negative, opening with: \\"Iron Cross will be remembered as Roy Scheider's swan song and little else\\". Following an apology by the magazine's managing director, the editor removed the review from the magazine's website, with no official explanation. Calibra LLC, the production company behind the film, sued Variety, stating that the review breached the advertising agreement to promote the picture for Oscar consideration. On 12 May 2010 a California Superior Court judge granted Varietys anti-SLAPP motion and dismissed Calibra's case as Variety's review was protected under the First Amendment. Calibra subsequently appealed on the grounds that Variety had impliedly waived the magazine's free speech rights when it signed the promotions contract. The California Court of Appeal held that Varietys rights under the First Amendment could only be waived expressly, not as an implied term of the agreement, and as such ruled in favor of Variety. The original negative review from Variety has been re-posted to their website. As a result of the lawsuit, the film's financiers decided to place the film's general release on hold--it was previewed at the Boston Film Festival in September 2010, and had a limited general release in March 2011.

Situated from Oslo Central Station (Oslo S), it is only served by extra rush-hour L22 service of the Norwegian State Railways' Oslo Commuter Rail. The station, which originally provided a passing loop, was designed by Balthazar Lange and opened on 24 November 1882. The passing loop was demolished in 1989 and the station unmanned. It was renovated as a heritage site in 2014. History Discussion of a railway through Eidsberg was first debated in the municipal council on 5 January 1867. The municipality approved a grant of 20,000 Norwegian speciedaler on 25 January 1873.Thoresen: 33 After it was decided in 1873 that the √òstfold Line was to be built, the main route controversy regarding the Eastern Line was whether it should run via Mysen, or take a straight line from Askim to Rakkestad. The railway engineers originally favored a bypass, but this was overruled by Parliament on 4 June 1874.Lang√•rd & Ruud: 23 Eidsberg was granted three stations. The southernmost was the most controversial and stirred up much local debate. The main proposed locations were Finnestad, Gjerud and Gutu. The municipal council ultimately voted on 1 May 1880 to let the decision fall on the railway company.Thoresen: 34 The station and line opened on 24 November 1882,Bjerke & Holom: 50 although temporary traffic had taken place since July. Many of the protests from the southern part of the municipality were met in 1895, when Heia Station opened. The station before 1922 Eidsberg Station grew up as a community hub and featured at various times a store, post office, telegraph, caf√©, bakery and fuel station. However, there never grew up a village around station like many other of the stations in the area. The post office opened in 1885,Sandberg: 25 and a year later a warehouse for Felleskj√∏pet was erected next to the station.Sandberg: 33 A road was built from the station to Huseby in 1910.Sandberg: 39 Eidsberg and Mysen were split into two municipalities in 1920. Unlike around Mysen Station, Eidsberg Station had never developed into a town. Some people called for the new municipal hall to be built next to the station so a new village could be built around them. This was not done and instead it was placed at S√∏ndre Mysen. Despite efforts, only nine lots were sold around Eidsberg Station the following one and a half decade.Sandberg: 75 An interlocking system was installed at the station on 22 January 1971. The station became unmanned from 1 January 1989. The passing loop was disabled on 22 May. The station building was renovated by Rom Eiendom in 2014 for a cost of 2.5 million Norwegian kroner. In addition to bringing it up to modern standards, the work restored the window and door designs from 1882. This was part of a project to make the station a cultural heritage site. Eidsberg is the only station along either of the √òstfold Lines which has received such a renovation. Facilities Eidsberg Station situated on the Eastern √òstfold Line, from Ski Station and from Oslo S, at an elevation of above mean sea level. The station has a simple asphalt side platform which is long with a platform height of . The station is located in a rural area and has 10 parking spaces for cars. The station was designed by Balthazar Lange in Swiss chalet style, who had the responsibility for all stations along the Eastern √òstfold Line. The wooden building is a third-class station and has the same design as many other stations on the line, Kr√•kstad, Tomter, Slitu, Mysen, Gautestad and Ise.Hartmann: 133 The station building is , including a goods shed built as an annex. The station building is listed as a cultural heritage site. The upper floor is rented out as a residence, while the ground floor is rented out as for commerce. Service Eidsberg is served with two daily L22 trains operated by the Norwegian State Railways' Oslo Commuter Rail. The station had 3,400 daily boarding and disembarking passengers in 2012.

Originally built in 1821, the mill was further extended to its current 5 stories in 1870. It is powered by 4 sails, 11 metres in length, and was in commercial use until 1966. Between 1954 and 1966 the mill was used for grinding animal feedstuff using newly installed electric rollers but also continued producing stoneground flour, too. The mill was sold to the local council in 1969 for ¬£1 and after being renovated was opened in 1974 as a working museum. It is the last working English windmill north of the Humber, producing stoneground wholemeal flour from locally grown wheat. The mill is open to visitors all week, milling takes place from Wednesday to Sunday weather permitting. Adjacent warehouses contain the Museum of East Riding Rural Life, including a famous 'Wolds Wagon' built by P. H. Sissons & Sons, which was originally lent to the Beverley Army Museum of transport. P. H. Sissons & Sons were based at Beswick and built wagons from 1854 onwards. In 2008, work began on the mill to replace some structural members in the cap and fantail. The work involved the 15 ton cap being removed by a crane; the only time that the cap has been removed since the 1870s.http://www.thisishullandeastriding.co.uk/news/lid-plain-sailing- vidarticle-634022-details/article.html Further refurbishment started in late-2019, with the removal of the sails and fantail which were transported to Norfolk for restoration. In July 2020, roof and window repairs were to be undertaken followed by painting of the tower which would take three months to complete. The sails and fantail were to be returned to the mill in early 2021.

Biography Jelena \\"Jela\\" Spiridonoviƒá-Saviƒá was born in ≈†abac, Kingdom of Serbia, 11 January 1890. She was the wife of a prominent Consul general of Yugoslavia in New York City, Vladislav Saviƒá. She spent three years in Trieste before World War I studying at the parochial school of Nostra Signora della Provvidenza e di Sion (Notre Dame de Sion Parish School). Educated in the world's centers of culture, New York, Munich, Trieste, and Monaco, she had the opportunity to intersect the Orthodox theology as part of her traditional heritage with ideas of Western Christianity, especially in the area of mystical spirituality. Having researched the mosaic of Christian spirituality, Spiridonoviƒá opened the questions about the metaphysical aspects of the world, as well as practical activities of the woman according to religious principles. Religious mysticism is deeply incorporated into the spiritual essence of her poetry, prose and essays. Her essays are based on the postulates of the scientific literature on feminist theory, which raises questions, rediscovering marginalized writers and offering new interpretations of their works. She died in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, September 1974.

Gandhi in 1909. In it he expresses his views on Swaraj, modern civilization, mechanisation etc. The book was banned in 1910 by the British government in India as a seditious text. Background Mohandas Gandhi wrote this book in his native language, Gujarati, while traveling from London to South Africa on board SS Kildonan Castle . It has also been translated to French. Hind Swaraj Text in French Key arguments Gandhi's Hind Swaraj takes the form of a dialogue between two characters, The Reader and The Editor. The Reader (specifically identified by the historian S. R. Mehrotra as Dr Pranjivan Mehta) essentially serves as the typical Indian countryman whom Gandhi would have been addressing with Hind Swaraj. The Reader voices the common beliefs and arguments of the time concerning Indian Independence. Gandhi, The Editor, explains why those arguments are flawed and interject his own arguments. As 'The Editor' Gandhi puts it, \\"it is my duty patiently to try to remove your prejudice.\\" In the dialogue that follows, Gandhi outlines four themes that structure his arguments. # First, Gandhi argues that ‚ÄòHome Rule is Self Rule‚Äô. He argues that it is not enough for the British to leave only for Indians to adopt a British-styled society. As he puts it, some \\"want English rule without the Englishman ... that is to say, [they] would make India English. And when it becomes English, it will be called not Hindustan but Englishtan. This is not the Swaraj I want.‚Äù # Gandhi also argues that Indian independence is only possible through passive resistance. In fact, more than denouncing violence, Gandhi argues that it is counter-productive; instead, he believes, ‚ÄúThe force of love and pity is infinitely greater than the force of arms. There is the harm in the exercise of brute force, never in that of pity.‚Äù This is essential throughout Hind Swaraj. # To exert passive resistance, Gandhi reasons that Swadeshi (self-reliance) be exercised by Indians, meaning the refusal of all trade and dealings with the British. He addresses the English when he states, ‚ÄúIf you do not concede our demand, we shall be no longer your petitioners. You can govern us only so long as we remain the governed; we shall no longer have any dealings with you.\\" Gandhi makes an intriguing argument here: if the British want India for trade, remove trade from the equation. # Finally, Gandhi argues that India will never be free unless it rejects Western civilization itself. In the text he is deeply critical of western civilization, claiming, ‚ÄúIndia is being ground down, not under the English heel, but under that of modern civilization.\\" He speaks about civilization not just in relation to India, though. He argues that ‚ÄúWestern civilization is such that one has only to be patient and it will be self-destroyed.\\" It is a profound repudiation. Not only is western civilization unhealthy for India, but western civilization is by its own virtue unhealthy. Censorship The Gujarati translation of Hind Swaraj was banned by the British authorities, on its publication in India.Arvind Krishna Mehrotra, A History of Indian Literature in English. C.

The original cobblestone floor lies a couple of feet down, and was discovered in the mid 1970s when trees were cleared on the site.

The band claims to play \\"loud, heavy, noisy, punk rock\\" and is influenced by 1980s hardcore punk and post-hardcore bands. The band have released several 7\\" singles and five albums, and are currently signed to Sub Pop. In March 2013, Pissed Jeans was named one of Fuse TV's 30 must-see artists at SXSW. History The members of Pissed Jeans all attended Nazareth High School and initially planned to use the name Unrequited Hard-On before settling on Pissed Jeans. As Matt Korvette explains, Pissed Jeans released its debut, Shallow, in 2005 on Parts Unknown Records. This was followed by Hope for Men (2007), King of Jeans (2009) and Honeys (2013), all released on Sub Pop Records. King of Jeans and Honeys were both produced by Alex Newport. The New York Times acknowledged the band for \\"bring(ing) back ‚Äô80s memories of hard, slovenly noise, when punk bands realized they could slow down and let their music fall apart a bit\\"; however, the article also observed the \\"aggressive, nasty\\" reaction of attendees at a 2008 show, who evidently were unprepared for Pissed Jeans sonics: the concert goers \\"started to huddle defensively on the sides,\\" with \\"the columns of speakers on either side of the band...being used as something to hold on to.

S√§chsischen Staatseisenbahnen (Royal Saxon State Railways). It runs from Plauen im Vogtland through Weischlitz, Adorf und Bad Brambach over the national border to Cheb.  History  = Planning and construction = Locomotives of the Royal Saxon State Railways during the escape to Bohemia (Eger) during the Austro-Prussian_War 1866 The origins of the present mainline between Plauen‚ÄìCheb stem from the Vogtl√§ndischen Staatseisenbahn from Herlasgr√ºn through Falkenstein/Vogtl. and Oelsnitz to Eger, which opened in November 1865. A direct track from Plauen to Bohemia was planned, and in October 1871 work started on the tracks from Plauen to Oelsnitz. To overcome the height difference between the Saxon-Bavarian Railway and the floor of the White Elster valley a considerable amount of earth had to be moved. In Plauen a large arched viaduct was constructed over the Syra, and on 1 November 1874, the twin-tracked section was opened. = Operation = The section from Plauen‚ÄìEger developed into the most important route from central Germany and Thuringia to Bohemia. The express trains from Dresden to Munich used the tracks as it was shorter than the route through Hof. After the First World War when Czechoslovakia was formed, the whole line remained in the control of the Royal Saxon State Railways and the subsequent Deutsche Reichsbahn. = During World War II = After the Anschluss or annexation of Sudetenland in Autumn 1938 the Vojtanov -Franti≈°kovy L√°znƒõ section became double track. At the end of the Second World War, the line was the target of heavy American bombing. On 8 April 1945, the station at Cheb was severely bombed so that rail traffic was no longer possible. Photographs from May 1945 show the impact of the bomb explosions and the severely damaged locomotives. On 12 April 1945 the viaduct across Oh≈ôe in Cheb was damaged. Till the end of the war the Plauen Oberer Bahnhof station was attacked and almost totally destroyed. = Post War = At the end of the war on 9 July 1945, the section in the Czech Republic passed over to the Czechoslovak State Railways ƒåSD. No compensation was received, because it was part of war reparations. The tracks in the German section were given as war reparations to the Soviet Union, and the second track was removed. The viaduct across Oh≈ôe in Cheb was replaced with a temporary bridge which remained in place until 19 May 1951 when the bridge had been rebuilt. Cross border goods traffic resumed in 1957, and passenger trains in the Czech section between Plesn√° and Cheb. From the start of the 1960s crossborder passenger trains resumed, then an express DR Class VT 18.16 Karlex from Berlin to Karlovy Vary. The goods traffic regained its importance, and the ƒåSD build a new border station at Vojtanov. Siemens Desiro, VT19a, operated by the Vogtlandbahn in Bad Brambach station. From the beginning of the 1980s the Czech section was electrified to the normal southern standard of 25 kV 50 Hz. The tracks between Vojtanov and Cheb went live 17 October 1983. The Deutsche Reichsbahn began to double the tracks in the 1970s, and the section Pirk‚ÄìAdorf and Raun‚ÄìBad Brambach were completed by the end of the 1980s. Though the line is principally used by Regional Express trains there is still a need for some goods traffic. Since 1997 Vogtlandbahn has operated local trains from Zwickau‚ÄìBad Brambach, and from 2000 the trains have run over the Czech border to Cheb serving all the intermediate stations. RegionalExpress-trains of the Deutsche Bahn ran from Leipzig to Bad Brambach, but on the introduction of the Karlex, in the mid 1990s there is no longer a need for this service. = Future developments = During the 1990s, restoring the second track through Bad Bambrach was discussed and in the long term this may happen. Similarly, it is possible that the line may be electrified- this was tied to the Leipzig City-Tunnel scheme.  Description of the route  The single track at Bad Elster Halt From the Oberer Bahnhof (upper station) in Plauen, the route uses the tracks of the Leipzig and Hof line and passes over the Syra Viaduct and reaches the halt on the site of the former Plauen West station. There are seven stations and halts in Plauen, that before July 2008 was not in the Vogtlandkreis. From K√ºrbitz the tracks run alongside the Elster Valley Railway as far as Weischlitz then follows the White Elster under the motorway bridge that carries the Bundesautobahn 72. From Pirk station, the section becomes doubled tracked, it passes through Oelsnitz/Vogtl. and on to Adorf/Vogtl. where it joins the tracks of the Chemnitz-Aue-Adorf Line. At Bad Elster the track bed leaves the Elster valley and swings through a series of tight curves through the highlands of the Elster Mountains. Shortly before Bad Brambach the line passes in and out of the Czech territory. Shortly after Bad Brambach station the tracks cross the Czech border again and reach the Czech station of Plesn√°, and again pass over to Germany on the south side of the Kapellenberg hills. On a constant gradient the line descends into the Czech border station of Vojtanov. From here, the section is electrified. Shortly after the station there is a junction with the lines from A≈° which formed the Cheb‚ÄìOberkotzau Line. More important is the station at the famous spa town of Franti≈°kovy L√°znƒõ, from here there is an express train to Prague and on into Slovakia. Shortly before the final station in Cheb, the line passes over the imposing Oh≈ôe viaduct, one of the largest bridges built by the Royal Saxon State Railways.

The Rajputana famine of 1869 (also the Great Rajputana Famine, Bundelkhand and Upper Hindustan famine, Rajputana famine of 1868-70) affected an area of and a population of 44,500,000, primarily in the princely states of Rajputana, India, and the British territory of Ajmer. Other areas affected included Gujarat, the North Deccan districts, the Jubbalpore division of the Central Provinces and Berar, the Agra and Bundelkhand division of the United Provinces, and the Hissar division of the Punjab. Course of famine The monsoon of 1868 was late in coming. When it came, was light and brief, lasting until only August 1868. There was a shortage of fodder in most areas of Rajputana, and some areas had water shortages as well. Since the much-needed grain could be brought in only on slow camel trains, the stricken areas were more or less inaccessible. Many inhabitants of the famine-stricken regions of Rajputana (for example, two- thirds of the population of Marwar) emigrated with their livestock or herds. Initially, they did not go to the British territory of Ajmer, where relief works had been arranged; many wandered in search of food until they died from starvation. Late in 1868, epidemics of cholera broke out among the vulnerable population, and there was no harvest in the spring of 1869. In May 1869, many villagers, who had emigrated earlier now returned to their villages believing that the rains would be early. However, the rains held off until mid-July and, in the interim, many thousands more died of starvation. Even so, the autumn harvest promised to be abundant, but swarms of locusts descended upon the fields and destroyed the young crops. In September and October 1869, there were heavy rains that, although good for the spring harvest, caused an epidemic of malaria and killed many more. Finally, the anticipated harvest of spring 1870 arrived and ended the famine. Relief Having been criticized for the badly bungled relief effort during the Orissa famine of 1866, British authorities began to discuss famine policy soon afterwards. In early 1868, Sir William Muir, Lieutenant-Governor of Agra Province, issued a famous order stating that: > \\"every District officer would be held personally responsible that no deaths > occurred from starvation which could have been avoided by any exertion or > arrangement on his part or that of his subordinates.\\" The Government of British India organized famine relief works in the British territory of Ajmer and in neighboring Agra Province of British India. In Ajmer, Rs. 49 lakhs were spent in the relief effort, Rs. 5 lakh in revenue remission, and Rs. 21 lakhs in a new scheme for agricultural credit. In Agra, another Rs. 30 lakhs were spent in relieving 29 million units (i.e., one person for one day). The princely states of Rajputana provided very little relief: only Udaipur State spent Rs. 5 lakhs. Consequently, the immigration from the princely states into British India in the later stages of the famine began to overwhelm British efforts. In spite of Muir's newly defined responsibility for each district officer, the resulting mortality was great. It is thought that over 1.5 million people died all over Rajputana during the famine.

It was used by the U.S. Navy, Marines, and Coast Guard.Donald 1997, p. 840. The S-52 was the first US helicopter with all-metal rotor blades. A two-seater, it was developed into the four-seat S-52-2. It was designated HO5S-1 by the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps; HO5S-1G by the Coast Guard; and YH-18A by the Army. Design and development Sikorsky Aircraft began designing the S-52 in late 1945.Harding 1990, p. 228. The prototype S-52, first flown in 1947, was a two-seater and used a 178 hp (133 kW) Franklin air-cooled flat-six piston engine. The two-seat version was modified into the S-52-2, a four-seat helicopter using a 245 hp (183 kW) Franklin O-425-1 air-cooled flat-six. It had a semi-monocoque fuselage of pod-and-boom arrangement with a large bubble-like front greenhouse, a three-blade rotor, and quadricycle fixed landing gear. The production S-52-3 (HO5S-1) incorporated a downward sloping (anhedral) v-tail stabilizer.FAA type certificate It also had sliding doors on the right forward and left rear sides, and a vertically split front bubble, allowing the left half to swing open in a clamshell fashion. The engine was placed at the aft end of the cabin and was canted forward 30 degrees to couple with the clutch and transmission.Flight manual, page 5 The pilot-in-command occupied the right front seat. The first American helicopter to have all-metal rotor blades, the prototype set several speed and height records in 1948, including 129.6 mph (204.2 km/h) on a 3 km (2 mi) course, 122.75 mph (197.54 km/h) on a 1 km (1,100 yd) circuit, and an absolute height of 21,220 ft (6,468 m). It was capable of hover out of ground effect at 5,900 ft (1,798 m) or 9,200 ft (2,804 m) in ground effect. The S-52 was the first helicopter to be flown in a loop, as flown by Harold E. Thompson on 19 May 1949. The S-52 also served as the basis of the turbine-powered S-59, which as the XH-39, competed for and lost the contract that produced the Bell UH-1 Iroquois. This aircraft differed in having a four-bladed rotor (against the S-52's three) and retractable tricycle gear. Operational history The Navy operated the aircraft as a utility type, and it was used by the Marines for observation and scouting in Korea,Polmar and Kennedy, p. 289 caption. where the HO3S proved more popular. Four S-52s were evaluated by the United States Army for utility use in 1950, as the YH-18A, but not purchased in quantity. Many of the former military HO5S-1 units were demilitarized, rebuilt, and licensed as civil aircraft by Orlando Helicopters, who acquired the parts inventory from Sikorsky.

Most species in this group produce a downy mildew disease, which can cause severe damage to many different cultivated crops, as well as wild and ornamental plants. There are 19 genera that produce downy mildew, and Peronospora has been placed alongside Pseudoperonospora in the group of downy mildews with coloured conidia. Peronospora has far more species than any other genus of the downy mildews. However, many species have been moved from this genus to be reclassified to other or new genera. Among these was the most famous Peronospora species, formerly known as Peronospora parasitica, and now known as Hyaloperonospora parasitica. Now, the Peronospora species of most importance is likely the Peronospora tabacina. Peronospora tabacina causes blue mold on tobacco plants and can severely reduce yields of this economically important crop to the point where it has been classified as a bioweapon. History Peronospora was first described in 1837 by August Carl Joseph Corda, a Czech mycologist and physician, in his first of six volumes of his Icones fungorum hucusque cognitorum. Since then, many of the species originally placed in Peronospora have been allocated to other genera or given rise to new genera based on new techniques such as molecular genetics. There was an epidemic in 1960 of Peronospora tabacina affecting tobacco plants leading to $25 million in losses across eleven countries, which was about 30 percent of the tobacco plants. Another epidemic that was caused by Peronospora destructor reduced the yield of sweet onions by 25 percent in Georgia, USA in 2012, and led to an estimated $18.2 million in losses. Habitat and ecology Most of the Peronospora species are highly specific to their hosts and can generally be found anywhere the host plant grows, or is being cultivated. A large portion of their life cycle in spent inside their host plant. Many species of Peronospora are seedborne pathogens, so the worldwide spread of Peronospora crop-plant pathogens is likely to be a result of unknowingly trading infected seeds to new areas. There are also many Peronospora species that are spread by wind currents, which allows them to disperse over large distances. Peronospora species prefer humid air and cool temperatures. General form and structure The first stage in the Peronospora life history is the sporangia. The sporangia are small spore-like structures about 65 um long that germinate a germ-tube when they are near a leaf stoma. A germ tube will come from the sporangium and penetrate the leaf cell where it will form a haustorium. The haustorium absorbs nutrients from the leaf, while hyphae invade the intercellular space, and the leaf will eventually develop a lesion. These lesions often start out yellow and then turn brown as the leaf starts to undergo necrosis. From here, Peronospora can undergo either asexual reproduction or sexual reproduction. Asexual reproduction occurs when the air outside is moist making for favourable conditions. During asexual reproduction, hyphae on the host plant will form sporangiophores, which will produce conidia. The conidia will be dispersed by the wind is able to infect other plants. The asexual cycle only takes five to seven days to complete. Sexual reproduction occurs when the conditions are unfavourable and it needs to withstand harsh environmental conditions. During sexual reproduction, the hyphae will undergo meiosis forming antheridia and oogonia, the only haploid structures in the Peronospora life history. The antheridia will fuse to the oogonia, initiating plasmogamy and then karyogamy, and will result in the production of many oospores. The oospores can then be dispersed by the wind to infect more plants. Both Peronospora and Pseudoperonospora are characterized by their ability to produce melanized sporangia, but Pseudoperonospora produces zoospores whereas Peronospora cannot. Practical importance The model oomycete pathogen, Peronospora parasitica, used to be included in this genus, however it has been reclassified to the genus Hyaloperonospora. Some species of Peronospora have been considered for their use as a bioweapon or have been classified as potential bioweapons. Peronspora somniferi was considered for its ability to devastate fields of the opium poppy, which could have targeted areas that depend on the crop. The United States has classified Peronospora tabacina as a possible bioweapon, because if it were used to target the US tobacco industry, it would lead to major economic loss. Genomics and genetics Only one species in the genus Peronospora has had its genome sequenced and assembled. In 2015, Derevnina et al. performed a de novo sequence assembly of the genome of two Peronospora tabacina isolates using Illumina sequencing. They estimated the genome size to be 68 Mb with a mitochondrial genome of 43 kb. The two assemblies had 61.8x and 128.9x coverage for the nuclear genomes and 6,824x and 43,225x coverage for the mitochondrial genomes.

History  The Harrow Observer has documented a variety of events over the years, from rail crashes to royal visits, court cases to council estates. It began life as the four-page, two pence The Harrow Monthly Gazette and General Advertiser. The paper first hit newsstands on 1 April 1855, fulfilling the dream of local estate agent and civic leader William Winkley Junior, who published it from a small shop in High Street, Harrow on the Hill. By the 1880s, the publication had grown into a broadsheet and the cover price had risen by half a penny. The Gazette lost its monopoly in April 1895 when non-conformist Robert A Smith launched the alternative Wealdstone, Harrow and Wembley Observer. In 1921, Oswald Mosley, then MP for Harrow, took over as editor of the Harrow Observer and under his command the two rivals merged. After several changes of owner, the newspaper came into the hands of Westminster Press, under whose tenure a 20-page midweek edition was published in 1967. The sister free paper, the Leader series, came into existence in 1983 and three years later the Harrow Observer switched from a broadsheet to tabloid format.

History  The original Kameyama Castle was founded by Seki Sanetada in 1264 to the west of the present Kameyama Castle, and was one of the five fortifications guarding the clan domains in northern Ise Province. It came under occasional attack by the Oda clan to the north, and was overrun when Oda Nobunaga extended his authority over Ise Province. When Seki Kazumasa was relocated to Shirakawa in 1590, Okamoto Munenori, a retainer of Toyotomi Hideyoshi was given control of the castle. Okamoto moved the castle to the southeast and reconstructed all the main structures.Kansai Collection: Kameyama Castle. Organization of Kansai Unity. Accessed May 15, 2008. Under the Tokugawa shogunate, the castle became the headquarters of Ise-Kameyama Domain, and the surrounding castle town prospered as a post station on the T≈çkaid≈ç highway connecting Edo with Kyoto.

Despite the error, the shogunate refused permission to rebuild the donjon. From 1644 and 1648, Honda Toshitsugu received permission to build a yagura on the raised base of the former donjon.

There are three Tajik enclaves (including the Sarvan exclave surrounded by Uzbekistan), which were products of several border adjustments during the Stalin regime of the 1920s to 1950s. Due to the inherent territorial restrictions of the exclave, violent conflicts over land ownership, access to pasture, and shared water resources have become more common, as logistical complications within this densely populated and impoverished region have also given rise to economic concern. The location of the border of the enclave is disputed by the Tajik and Kyrgyz governments.

McCarthy was an important, but largely forgotten film critic, as his work never reached the general public. Every week from 1932 to 1968, he produced single-sheet reports assessing the commercial viability of individual films for different audiences. These were available to cinema owners (usually independents) on a subscription-only basis. Managers of independent cinemas relied upon his judgements to choose what their audiences would see. He reviewed more than 11,000 films, and the entire collection is now owned by the Bodleian Library, having been discovered by bookseller Ed Maggs. The story behind these reviews only emerged after McCarthy's son Brian McCarthy answered an appeal for information on Front Row, the BBC Radio 4 programme. When he died in 1970, his local paper noted the passing of a loyal member of the Finchley Chrysanthemum Association, but neglected to mention his history as a film reviewer.

In the 1950s the church had a mission for Japanese people.Mayer, p. 30. \\"Several Japanese attend the Japanese Mission which meets at the Trinity Methodist Church, 13100 Woodward.\\" After Trinity left the building in 1978, the next year the New Mt. Moriah Baptist Church congregation moved into the building. New Mt. Moriah was established in 1952. As of 2020, the church remained in the building, led by Rev. Dr. Kelvin A. Brooks, Pastor and First Lady Charline Brooks. Architecture The former Trinity United Methodist Church is a gray limestone, Gothic Revival church measuring 125 feet by 110 feet. The main facade has a gabled, two-story entrance pavilion with a recessed entrance located between a plain extension and a crenelated tower with belfry. On the side, there is a shallow, gabled transept with a large window, and a projecting entrance between the church and attached chapel. References * Mayer, Albert. Ethnic groups in Detroit, 1951.

It is typically a broad and heavy strip of leather, often with a hard handle, the more flexible 'blade' being applied to the offender. Probably because of the stiffness, the word \\"strap\\" is sometimes used interchangeably with a leather paddle. Other terms that are used interchangeably include whipping, lashing, and confusingly even in some official language, belting‚Äîin principle a belt is lighter, without a handle. These terms are strictly speaking reserved for other implements. The Scottish tawse is a forked version with two or more tails, colloquially known as the belt, and was the standard implement of punishment in state schools until it was banned in 1987.\\"The Cane and the Tawse in Scottish Schools\\" at World Corporal Punishment Research. * The historical strap, usually made for institutional use, is also known as a prison strap because it was mainly used on adult convicts - either for discipline within the prison system, or as an original judicial corporal punishment, often combined with prison time, imposed by a court but carried out by prison staff. This has been the case notably in the USA (mainly the South, e.g. Arkansas at least until 1967; sometimes a spanking inflicted on the trousers, sometimes bare bottom but also used on the back) and Canada (until 1972, delivered to the offender's bare buttocks).\\"The Canadian Prison Strap\\" at World Corporal Punishment Research. The strap has also been used on minors in reformatories and in schools. The latter was particularly prevalent in Canada, applied to the student's hand, until the practice was abolished in 2004, but there, in modern times at least, it was generally made of canvas/rubber rather than leather. * Because of the forceful impact a disciplinary strap makes, which can easily knock the recipient out of balance and make fall over (reported by strapped punishees who were ordered to receive it while grabbing their ankles), the victim is usually supported in a bending or lying position, often tied down, e.g. over a table or punishment horse, or against a whipping post. * Like the holed paddle, there is a version of the strap with holes. It intentionally increases the risk and severity of blistering if administered on the bare skin. Martin Tabert, a 22-year-old man arrested for vagrancy, died after being hit about 100 times with a 5-foot leather strap in 1921. The strapping was punishment for Tabert failing to perform his work as part of a prison work-gang in Leon County, Florida. He was weak with malaria at the time. Sheriff J. R. Jones had \\"sold\\" the man to the head of the work-gang for a twenty-five dollar fee. Cavalier County (North Dakota) States Attorney Gudmunder Grimson and New York World reporter Samuel \\"Duff\\" McCoy brought the case to national attention. The World won the 1924 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service for its coverage of the incident. A ballad by Marjory Stoneman Douglas memorialized the case. The whipping-boss, Walter Higginbotham, was charged with Tabert's murder but acquitted. Florida's then governor Cary Hardee outlawed the use of flogging in the wake of public outrage over the death, and brought an end to the convict lease system in the state.Martin Tabert's Brutal Death Leads to End of Convict Lease System.

She was a former coastal trader, a brig named Surprise. King Charles took passage on Surprise after the final defeat of the royalist cause in 1651, narrowly avoiding pursuing Parliamentarian forces. He arrived safely in France, where he lived in exile until the Restoration in 1660. On his return Charles purchased the ship he had travelled on, naming her after his escape from England nearly a decade before. He kept her moored close to his palace, showing her to other royals. The ship remained on the Navy Lists for many years, being sold finally in 1750, though several other vessels perpetuated the name until 1877. King Charles's escape After the royalist defeat at the Battle of Worcester on 3 September 1651 King Charles II escaped and fled from the Parliamentarian forces who had orders to arrest him. He travelled eventually to Brighton, where he met the captain of a coal-brig, Nicholas Tattersall, and arranged passage to France. Tattersall was the only person who was to know Charles's identity; the crew were told that the passengers were merchants fleeing their creditors. Tattersall agreed to make the passage, and safely landed the royal party at F√©camp. Return Charles remained fond of the ship that had helped his escape, and on his return to England at the Restoration in 1660, purchased her, renaming her Royal Escape. Charles had her moored in the Thames off the Palace of Whitehall, where he would show her off to other royalty. She was entered on the Navy List as a smack, long, with a beam of , and drawing . She was retained on the navy lists for a number of years, being rebuilt in 1714 and 1736 as a transport.

This later craft was broken up in 1791, and a new Royal Escape was launched in 1792. This vessel, a transport, was broken up in 1877.

Biography =Early life and career= He was born in Scotland. In 1930 he married Gertrude Wilson. After farming in the Waikato, he worked at the Otahuhu Railway Workshops and became a secretary for the local branch of the New Zealand Railways Union. =Political career= At the 1938, 1941 and 1944 local-body elections he was a Labour candidate for seats on the One Tree Hill Borough Council and Auckland Hospital Board. He was unsuccessful in each attempt. He represented the Ponsonby electorate from 1946 to 1963, and then the Grey Lynn electorate from 1963 to 1969, when he retired. Union secretary Tom Skinner was resentful of the fact that Macdonald had won the nomination for the safe seat of Ponsonby whilst he had been allocated the more marginal seat of Tamaki. From 1958 to 1966 Macdonald was Labour's junior whip. Macdonald was skilled at engaging with labourers and factory workers more effectively than most of his more intellectual caucus colleagues who considered him a lightweight, but Warren Freer said that he possessed a \\"common touch\\". Macdonald was one of the few senior Labour MPs who backed Norman Kirk as leader. He considered Kirk the most democratic leader Labour had ever had and appreciated how he let caucus members openly \\"say their piece\\" in ways never allowed under Fraser, Nash or Nordmeyer, and he regretted that the newer (and future) Labour MPs would be unable to make this comparison. The then Mayor of Auckland Sir Dove-Myer Robinson said about him when he retired: \\"His is the old style of personal assistance. The majority of modern politicians do not know what that means.\\" Robert Chapman said that the Parliamentary superannuation scheme (introduced in 1946) .... encouraged thoughts of retirement even among Labour's sempiternal back-benchers for, after all, Ritchie Macdonald did retire, not die, in the end.New Zealand Politics and Social Patterns: selected works by Robert Chapman; page 266 (1999, Victoria University Press, Wellington) =Later life and death= In 1970, Macdonald was appointed a member of the board of trustees of the Auckland Savings Bank. In the 1973 Queen's Birthday Honours, he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire, for services to the community. Macdonald died at his home in One Tree Hill on 14 March 1987, aged 91, and his body was cremated at Purewa Crematorium.

The band has released three full length studio albums to date: Floor, Dove and Oblation and one EP: Madonna. History =Floor and Dove (1992 ‚Äì 2013)= Initially from Miami, Floor was formed in 1992 by guitarist Steve Brooks, bassist and guitarist Anthony Vialon and drummer George Rios. Betty Monteavaro replaced Rios on drums in 1993. Jeff Sousa became the drummer in late 1993, and Brooks and Vialon changed their sound by implementing two uniquely low-tuned guitars, forgoing the need of a bassist. Material was recorded for two full-length albums (Dove 1994, Saturnine and Tears 1995) but neither were released until after their eponymous album years later. During that time several vinyl-only 7\\" EPs were released, followed by the band's first break-up in 1996. They reformed with a new line-up for one show in 1997 with Henry Wilson on drums and practiced only occasionally until 2001. They released their first full- length album, self-titled Floor, before splitting up in 2003. The Self-Titled album went on to garner accolades from the underground music scene and the bands' cult-following grew in their absence. Brooks would go on to form the band Torche. Henry Wilson went on to form the bands Dove and House of Lightning. Anthony Vialon, having also played several years with Miami outfit Cavity, focused on theology. The band reformed in 2010 for a reunion tour to support the release of Below & Beyond, an 8-CD/10-LP box set encompassing their entire career. =Oblation (2013 ‚Äì present)= In March 2013, Floor reunited again and announced its intention to tour and release a new album through Season of Mist. Vialon said that after the group's 2010 reunion tours, Floor had, \\"noticed that our fan base had grown exponentially and doing a new record, kind of picking up where we'd left off, was something we agreed we should focus on.\\" Floor released their third studio album Oblation on April 29, 2014 to generally favorable reviews scoring 77% on aggregate website Metacritic. Musical style The band is known for incorporating two low- tuned and distorted guitars that forgo the need to have a bass guitar. This includes the extended use of what some critics have called the \\"bomb note\\", an E string that is extremely loosely strung to the guitar. AllMusics Gregory Heaney called it \\"a shuddering explosion of sludgy distortion that comes from hitting a guitar string that's detuned until it's barely hanging on\\". PopMatters described the effect as \\"a guitar string tuned so low it flaps like a pensioner's bingo wing\\" while Grayson Haver Currin of Pitchfork remarked \\"Who needs a fourth wheel when you‚Äôve got 12 strings tuned to the introductory letters of the alphabet?\\".

In 1845 he was apprenticed for three years to the engraver Cyrus A. Swett, where he was trained in copper and wood engraving. Walker provided the engravings for catalogues, government reports, advertisements and magazines such as The Canadian Illustrated News, L'Opinion Publique and Le Monde Illustr√©, and produced the front-cover illustration for his launching of Punch in Canada in 1849. The magazine was styled on the English Punch and failed when published by Walker as a weekly. His other short-lived humorous periodicals were The Jester, Grinchuckle and Diogenes. He is regarded as a pioneer of political cartooning in Canada and dominated engraving in Montreal from 1845 into the 1890s. His legacy of illustrations provides a rich insight into life in Victorian Canada.

Neither his real name, nor the dates of his birth and death are known. Presumably this artist was a pupil of the Nikoxenos Painter. The name was introduced in 1911 by John Beazley, a classical historian at the University of Oxford who had a special interest in attic vases. Through close examination of stylistic details, Beazley and other scholars recognized pieces painted by the same artist. In this case, the nickname appreciates the anonymous painter's repeated use of kalos inscriptions praising the beauty of a named young boy. A vase with the inscription ŒöŒëŒõŒüŒ£ ŒïŒ•ŒßŒëŒ°ŒôŒîŒïŒ£ (\\"kalos Eucharides\\", i.e. Eucharides is beautiful) became the source of the artist's name. The Eucharides painter was working in Athens in the years from about 500 BC to 470 BC. At this time the technique of vase painting switched from black-figured to red-figured illustrations, a process commonly attributed to the Andokides Painter. Correspondingly, both black-figured and red-figured vases are attributed to the Eucharides painter. Their shapes range from large kraters to small cups. Scenes were drawn from mythology and daily life. Many of this artist's known works were retrieved from Etruscan tombs in Italy. Recently, one of his attic vases was claimed to be looted and was repossessed by the Italian State. NY Observer NY Times Vases Examples of attic vases attributed to the Eucharides painter are on display around the world, e.g.: * Getty Museum, Malibu, California, USA (no. 86.AE.227).

After earning a law degree from the University of Pennsylvania Law School, Schnader went on to become Special Deputy Attorney General of Pennsylvania in 1923 and Attorney General in 1930. He served as the Attorney General of Pennsylvania under two successive governors, during which time he directed major new codifications of the laws of corporations and banking. In 1934, Schnader was an unsuccessful Republican candidate for governor. He lost to Democrat George Howard Earle. In 1935, following his unsuccessful bid for Governor of Pennsylvania, Schnader and Bernard G. Segal, the former Deputy Attorney General, joined with Francis A. Lewis, who had been a partner in another law firm and the treasurer of Schnader's gubernatorial campaign, to form the law firm of Schnader & Lewis in Philadelphia. Shortly thereafter, they added Bernard Segal as a named partner. In the early years, the members of the firm gained prominent clients and soon national recognition handling a major case heard by the Supreme Court of the United States. In 1948, Earl G. Harrison, after resigning as Dean of the University of Pennsylvania Law School, joined the firm as the fourth named partner. Schnader was active in creating the Uniform Commercial Code ‚Äì in fact, he dedicated nearly twenty years of his life to the organization, drafting, development and promotion of a nationwide system of business law, which earned him the title, \\"Father of the Uniform Commercial Code.\\" Notably, much of this work was accomplished while in a wheelchair following a crippling stroke. For this \\"conspicuous service to American jurisprudence,\\" he was awarded the Gold Medal of the American Bar Association in 1960. His public service included many other contributions, including five years' work as Chairman of the American Bar Association Bill of Rights Committee (the forerunner of the present Section of Individual Rights and Responsibilities), and service as President of the Pennsylvania Bar Association in 1962‚Äì63.

It is found in Panama, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Suriname, Bolivia, Venezuela, Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, and Brazil. It is a species group, which may be, or may not be several species. Many subspecies have been described. Description The basal part of the upper surface in the males brilliant steel blue, the distal area of both wings delicate light blue. But in the female the proximal region is darkened, being broadly black, though with intensive metallic reflection. Forewing with three white median dots, the light blue restricted to a relatively narrow median area. Taxonomy The accepted subspecies are: *M. d. neoptolemus Wood, 1863 (Brazil: Amazonas, Colombia, Peru) Basal part of both wings black brown, only distally with slight dark blue sheen. Female: The blue median band of both wings broader, darker but more glossy blue than in the nominate deidamia. Under surface with somewhat less extended red submarginal patches, but with more copious white reticulation. *M. d. granadensis C. & R. Felder, [1867] (Nicaragua, Panama, Colombia, Ecuador, Venezuela) Upper surface similar to Morpho peleides, but the black distal border considerably more extended, the wings more rounded, the Morpho reflection deeper blue, and especially characterized by its large, light cinnamon-brown ringed ocelli, those on the forewing of uniform size, whilst on the hindwing the apical eyespots far surpass the three closely approximated anal ocelli. *M. d. polybaptus Butler, 1875 (Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama) The black distal area of the upper surface somewhat widened and the white subapical spot of the forewing more strongly expressed. On the under surface the whitish yellow anteterminal bands are more prominent and the bordering to the ocelli is of a finer bronzy greenish colour. Median band of the hindwing strongly elbowed, distally with a nose-shaped projection in the middle of the wing. *M. d. pyrrhus Staudinger, 1887 (Peru) *M. d. electra R√∂ber, 1903 (Bolivia) A highly specialized local form from Bolivia with the hindwing decidedly more rounded and the forewing shorter. The upper surface is brilliant light blue, in certain lights with greenish gloss. The black distal margin very narrow, at the hinder angle of the forewing only about 2 mm and at the apex about 10 mm, in the middle of the hindwing about 3 mm in breadth. In the apex of the forewing are placed two white spots; the costal margin of the forewing is brown black from the base to the discocellular, the white costal spot which follows about 10 mm in length. The base of the wing only very slightly darkened. Under surface dark red brown; the form of the light markings quite similar to those of deidamia, but the eyespots much smaller, margined with red yellow (granadensis Felder, but the subapical eyespot of the hindwing is considerably larger in the latter), the distal-marginal markings are white (not yellow as in deidamia), the proximal silver white markings reduced, less continuous, and at the distal margin of the hindwing there are only small, narrow red longitudinal spots (no transverse band). *M. d. hermione R√∂ber, 1903 (Colombia) Differs from the typical deidamia of the Lower Amazon in having the black distal border much narrower; at the posterior angle of the forewing it is only about 2 mm in breadth, but gradually widens and at the apex attains a breadth of about 1.5 mm; the distal margin of the hindwing is about 3 mm in breadth in the middle. The greenish-blue median band is about 25 mm in breadth, with its proximal boundary sharp and almost straight, the distal indistinct. The dark brown basal part is about 18 mm in breadth and has only in the distal third a dark blue gloss. In the apex of the forewing are placed two small, distinct white spots and one very indistinct light one. At the costal margin of the forewing there is a small white spot. At the inner angle of the hindwing there are only traces of small reddish spots. The under surface is dark mahogany brown, on the hindwing somewhat lighter about the veins, the light markings are in shape almost like those of deidamia, but are much less developed (narrower) and of the submarginal brick-red spots of the hindwing only slight traces are present. *M. d. neoptolemus Fruhstorfer, 1907 (Ecuador, Colombia) Basal part of both wings black brown, only distally with slight dark blue sheen. Female: the blue median band of both wings broader, darker but more glossy blue than in deidamia from Surmame and Obidos. Under surface with somewhat less extended red submarginal patches, but with more copious white reticulation. *M. d. guaraura Le Cerf, 1925 (Venezuela) *M. d. diomedes Weber, 1944 (Peru) *M. d. diffusa Le Moult & R√©al, 1962 (Brazil: Maranh√£o) *M. d. steinbachi Le Moult & R√©al, 1962 (Bolivia) Morpho deidamia deidamia MHNT male dos.jpgMorpho deidamia deidamia, male - MHNT Morpho deidamia deidamia MHNT male ventre.jpgMorpho deidamia deidamia, male underside - MHNT Morpho deidamia deidamia MHNT femelle dos.jpgMorpho deidamia deidamia, female - MHNT Morpho deidamia deidamia MHNT femelle ventre.jpgMorpho deidamia deidamia, female underside - MHNT Etymology Deidamia was the daughter of Lycomedes, king of Scyros, figures in Greek mythology.

He is portrayed by Luke Macfarlane. His relationship with Kevin Walker (Matthew Rhys) was included in TV Guides list of \\"The Best TV Couples of All Time\\". Character history =Background= Scotty Wandell is a gay man who grew up in Oxford, Mississippi until he moved to New York City and then later to California to start an independent life because his parents, Wally and Bertha Wandell,Scotty Wandell (Luke MacFarlane) Character Bio - Brothers & Sisters - ABC.com didn't accept his homosexuality when he came out. As stated in episode 2.16 Prior Commitments, his parents never used the word \\"gay\\" until he told them he was. Scotty has worked many temporary jobs including cater-waitering. He was also a head chef at San Estephe, the five- star restaurant where he interned as an assistant sous chef while attending culinary school in Pasadena. He is currently running his own restaurant with Saul, Kevin's uncle. =Season 1= Scotty first met Kevin Walker at Kevin's law office. He was a key witness to insurance fraud for the company he was temporarily working for as a receptionist. Scotty (who at the time was more flamboyant than Kevin) quickly deduced Kevin's homosexuality and jokingly accused him of being ashamed and trying to \\"pass\\" for heterosexual. Kevin held a grudge over Scotty for these accusations, but after Sarah invited him to the family's pool party, Kevin started to enjoy Scotty's presence. After making a date, Kevin had to cancel due to the guilt that his mother Nora imposed on him to get him to go with her to a golf tournament. When she changed her mind, and wanted to go to the movies instead, they ran into Scotty and a man, both holding hands with each other. Scotty then dropped by Kevin's office to tell him that the male companion was just a friend. They set up another date, and bonded by talking about their backgrounds. Scotty impulsively kissed Kevin, he was put off, and remained distant for the time after. The date ended on a sour note, but the next day, Scotty dropped by Kevin's apartment to apologize for being judgmental and to tell Kevin how much he got to Scotty. Kevin expressed relief that Scotty wasn't perfect and kissed him in front of a neighbor. After jokingly slamming the door in his face, Kevin pulled Scotty inside the apartment in order to take their relationship further. When Scotty was unable to get off work to attend a charity benefit with Kevin, Kevin offered to pay Scotty's salary for the time he would miss. Scotty bristled at the idea of being \\"bought\\" by Kevin, and felt he was being made to feel inferior due to his social status. Coincidentally, Scotty turned out to be a waiter at the benefit. When a drunk Kevin apologized to him, they kissed and made up, but Scotty's boss fired him for putting his personal life before the job. Kevin threatened the boss with an anti-discrimination lawsuit unless he agreed to rehire Scotty, with a bigger salary. Kevin and Scotty made up. When Kevin found out the family ranch house was about to be sold, he and Scotty decided to go for a weekend visit, not realizing the rest of his family had had the same idea. During the weekend, Kevin's brother Tommy, who had recently discovered his sterility, asked Kevin for his sperm in order to father a child with Tommy's wife Julia. Kevin turned him down. When Sarah found out she angrily confronted Kevin at the dinner table, and asked Scotty for his opinion. Kevin unthinkingly snapped that Scotty was not family and he should \\"shut up\\". He quickly apologized, but a hurt Scotty went home. Kevin confided to Kitty that he didn't want to bring a child into the world because he was afraid the child would be considered different for having a gay uncle as a biological father, and face the kind of suffering he had faced. Kitty assured him the Walkers would never let anyone hurt the child, and Kevin (along with their other brother, Justin) agreed to be a sperm donor for Tommy and Julia. When Kevin got back to town, Scotty would no longer return his calls. Scotty dropped by the office to accept a settlement check, and Kevin joked that Scotty could take him to dinner since he was now on Kevin's financial level. A hurt Scotty said it had taken him a long time to accept himself, and in only two months, Kevin had made him feel worthless. He then told Kevin to rip up the check. Soon after, Kevin called Scotty and finally put his heart on the line. Scotty asked him for the check, and thanked him for the time they had spent together, but said the relationship was over. Kevin barely held his tears at bay as he ended the conversation. On Valentine's Day, a mutual friend (Michelle), set up Kevin and Scotty on a blind date, unaware that Kevin was having an affair with Michelle's boyfriend, Chad. With jealously playing up and strong feelings for Scotty, Kevin slept with Scotty that night. The next morning when Chad called Kevin and asked if he slept with Scotty, Chad hung up before Kevin could take the conversation further. Scotty, overhearing this, thought Kevin only slept with him to get back at Chad, which was not true. Scotty wished Kevin good luck then left. =Season 2= A few months later, Scotty was arrested for DUI. He went to Kevin's office for legal help with the arrest, because he states the officer only arrested him because he had a problem with his homosexuality. Kevin managed to have the case dismissed. As a thank you present, Scotty treated Kevin to a private dinner at the fancy restaurant where he worked as a cook. After the meal, Scotty nearly kissed Kevin before he stopped himself. Kevin somewhat nervously said that he had a boyfriend now - Jason - who he was living with, and who was now away in Malaysia (as a missionary). Scotty took this to mean that Kevin really had changed. Kevin left, but later returned to tell Scotty that they'd never had the chance to be friends, and he very much wanted to be Scotty's friend. Scotty was in the middle of a busy service, but told Kevin that was fine with it. Scotty's tuition then was due, and he could no longer afford his apartment, cell phone and insurance. Kevin invited Scotty to live with him. In the meantime, Kevin had not been talking to Jason for quite a while because Jason did not respond to Kevin's calls. Kevin felt emotionally lonely and also realized he still loved Scotty. One night, after a meal and champagne, he and Scotty slept together. A few days later, he finally got a call from Jason. He told Jason he had slept with Scotty and then broke up with Jason. When Jason returned to town, he told Kevin he'd undergone a spiritual crisis and could not bring himself to call. Scotty arranged a meal between the three of them which turned tense. After a quarrel, Jason left, and Scotty moved into his car, as he assumed Kevin no longer wanted him around. The next morning, Kevin convinced him he wanted to continue the relationship, and the two moved in together. Soon after, Scotty cut himself badly and incurred large expenses because he had no health insurance. Kevin suggested they enter a domestic partnership so Scotty could share his coverage. Scotty, stung that Kevin only cared about practicality, rejected the idea. Kevin's uncle, Saul, called him after driving his car into a tree while drunk. Kevin and Saul had fallen out some months earlier because Kevin suspected Saul was gay (Scotty had seen him at a gay dinner party he'd catered) but Saul had vehemently denied it. After Kevin picked him up, Saul despondently asked Kevin how a man Saul's age could deal with being gay. The loneliness of Saul's life led Kevin to realize just how special his relationship with Scotty was. When he returned home, he proposed marriage to Scotty, even getting down on one knee. Scotty, moved by Kevin's words, happily said yes. Before the marriage, Scotty told Kevin that his parents refused to attend the wedding. Kevin, outraged (although Scotty said he was fine with it), went with his brothers to Arizona to try and talk his parents into going, which failed. Scotty's father gave Kevin a small box however, which was made by Scotty when he was little and contained the cuff links that Mr. Wandell wore at his wedding. Scotty was moved by this. At the end of the second season finale, they were married. =Season 3= Scotty and Kevin must settle into married life which is made difficult with Kevin spending most of his time at work, attempting to secure a promotion as a partner. While at a business dinner it is implied to Kevin by his boss that he'd be more successful should he keep his sexuality a secret. Although uncomfortable he is initially tempted to go along with this which upsets Scotty. Though in the end he decides against it and takes a new job working with Robert. Meanwhile Scotty is doing well in his career and is eventually promoted to head chef. Although happy for him, Kevin struggles with the fact that Scotty now brings home more money. Scotty also spends some time taking care of Kevin after he has a liver transplant to help Elizabeth, which leads him to clash with Nora on the best way to help him heal. When Kevin's ex- boyfriend Chad Berry returns he intrigues the couple with the suggestion that they participate in a threesome. Although they are at first tempted they decide it could ruin their relationship. =Season 4= Scotty and Kevin decide to start a family and look into surrogacy. They constantly disagree about how to approach it, especially once Scotty's good friend Michelle offers to be their surrogate which Scotty agrees to as it would make the pregnancy more personal to them. He is irritated by Kevin's business like manner towards his friend. They are happy to learn towards the end of the season that Michelle is pregnant. Due to tough economic times Scotty is devastated to learn that his restaurant is being closed down forcing him out of a job. When Kevin also becomes unemployed because of Robert cancelling his campaign, Scotty decides to take some catering jobs but Kevin tells him it's time for him to follow his dreams. Along with Saul, Scotty starts plans to open his own restaurant. Scotty is unharmed in the accident in the season finale. =Season 5= In the year that's passed since the accident Scotty and Kevin have become distant. Due to his feelings about Robert being in a coma Kevin has been neglecting Scotty who has been busy with the opening of his new restaurant. He later reveals that he had a one night stand which causes a strain on their marriage. Kevin eventually decides to forgive him because he know he was to blame for their problems. The couple also decide to look into adoption again as their surrogate Michelle suffered a miscarriage. They eventually adopt a young girl named Olivia. Although she is at first nervous in her new family she becomes settled into life with Scotty and Kevin. Whilst out with Olivia Scotty bumps into Michelle who has not had any contact with him since her miscarriage. She explains that she is only in town for a couple of days visiting her mother and didn't have time to see him. He becomes worried about her because they have been best friends their whole lives and he convinces Kevin to help him look for her. They go to the airport where they know she will be taking her flight and see her with a baby but at the sight of them she runs to the gate. After some time and interaction with police and attorneys, Scotty and Kevin are worried that seeing Michelle has caused her to flee and they will never get a chance to see the baby (who was born in the exact time frame that their surrogate baby would have been born in), named Daniel. Michelle calls Scotty and sets up a meeting in a cafe, but Scotty doesn't tell Kevin of the meeting in case his hard-headedness or rage would cause Michelle to flee again and they would lose all hope of getting their baby. Scotty is angry with Michelle and claims that he has forgiven her, deciding they should find a way to make it all work. Michelle calls Scotty's phone but Kevin picks up and eventually screams at her that the baby is not genetically related to her when Scotty comes in and Michelle hangs up. Scotty blames Kevin for the possibility that they may never see Daniel again. Days later, Kevin and Scotty are putting Olivia to bed when Kevin receives a call from Justin who claims he is on their doorstep. Kevin and Scotty open the door to Justin who is holding a baby, and he claims, \\"She just left him.\\" Kevin and Scotty are in shock as Olivia walks in the room and asks, \\"Whose baby is that?\\" Markus (Season 5, episode: \\"An Ideal Husband\\") ‚Äì Scotty comes clean with Kevin, explaining that he had an affair with a man, although careful not to mention his name or occupation. After a brief period of not talking and with Kevin sleeping on the couch, their marriage seems to be on the verge of failure, despite the fact Kevin's mother Nora Walker and sister Kitty Walker try to convince him otherwise. On the night of Nora's charity event, Kevin nicknames a waiter \\"rob\\" and leaves, before his brother Justin Walker, who is working the bar, gains knowledge of a waiter who claimed to have had sex with the chef of the restaurant and hoped to succeed again. Justin tells Scotty, who learns that Nora's brother Saul Holden, hired him to work as a waiter that night, although completely oblivious to his part in Scotty's affair. Scotty asks Justin to get rid of him but without Kevin knowing, however Kevin gains knowledge of the fact and attacks a waiter at random, thinking he is the person Scotty slept with. When Justin attacks the real Markus, the whole event watches him leave in a hurry and Justin tries to calm Kevin down. Scotty and Kevin remain separate until Kevin's sister's (Sarah Walker) daughter, Paige Whedon, asks them for their help on her debating project. Kevin, after a failed attempt to get rid of Scotty from the presence of himself, Paige and Nora, helps Paige. Later on, Scotty shows up at Sarah's house and finds Kevin there. The two were tricked by Paige, who strove to repair their marriage. After a long talk in which they reconcile their marriage, Kevin and Scotty show up at Paige's debate session and start with a clean slate.

He collaborated with Le Corbusier on several projects, and sought to revitalise Breton furniture design. He ran a workshop in Tr√©guier . Early life Savina was born in Douarnenez. Both his father and brother were cabinetmakers, and Savina was apprenticed in the trade at Tr√©guier, learning carpentry and carving. He soon progressed to become foreman of the workshop. In 1927, having graduated as a fully trained cabinetmaker, he won the national Meilleur Ouvrier de France (Best Craftsman of France) competition. He organized his own design studio in 1929, situated in the rue Saint-Andr√© in Tr√©guier. His early works were mainly statuettes depicting fishermen and restoration work on the carvings in the city's cathedral. He later sought to modernize Celtic traditions, introducing Celtic knot patterns into his work. He joined the Breton nationalist art movement Seiz Breur, which was influenced by the Arts and Crafts movement, becoming its principal woodworker. He insisted that \\"plastic work is the basis of architectural work\\" and was an ardent defender of Breton folk art. Collaboration with Le Corbusier  He first met Le Corbusier in 1935, leading to a long friendship based on respect and mutual admiration. The two regularly exchanged ideas, and Corbusier expressed admiration for the \\"sense of plasticity\\" in Savina's work. Savina executed carvings from Corbusier's drawings.\\"Joseph Savina et le Corbusier\\", Ouest-France, 26 Jan, 1997. Under Corbusier's influence Savina made a number of abstract sculptures. Corbusier wrote to Savina of these works: \\"Your works are just the right size; art for the apartment; art for the loving collector\\".\\"L'√©chelle que vos statuettes poss√®dent est parfaite. art d'appartement, art de collectionneur amoureux...\\" He added that \\"this type of sculpture comes into what I call the plastic- acoustic: that is to say forms that both speak and listen.sculpture entre dans ce que j'appelle la plastique acoustique, c'est-√†-dire des formes qui √©mettent et qui √©coutent\\". Savina ran his workshop until 1970, when he retired and passed it to his prot√©g√© Michel Le Calvez. The Lyc√©e Joseph Savina in Tr√©guier is named for him.

History =Establishment= The first library of the Bowling Green Normal College was established in 1914 in the basement of a nearby Methodist Church, with its first professional librarian hired in 1915. Also in 1915, the library was moved from its temporary location off campus to the third floor of University Hall. =McFall Center= In 1927 the library moved into its first dedicated building, The McFall center. In the 1950s the old library was expanded, and by 1961 it contained 330,000 items. =Jerome Library= Construction of a new library began in 1965. In 1982, the building was named in honor of William Travers Jerome III, who served as the sixth president of Bowling Green State University. In 2017 Jerome Library served about 450,000 people annually and held over 2 million items. Jerome Library The building, which was designed by state architect Carl E. Bentz, features unique non-objective murals on the east and west facades of the library designed by Don Drumm. Drumm, an artist in residence during the 1960s, actively participated in the conceptualization and construction of the murals. Drumm outlined contemporary designs onto the concrete. Construction crews then sandblasted the designs into the concrete. Drumm added shadow pins to the west mural to capture light and create shadows to complete the mural. The nine-level, 156,895 sq ft structure, is located between Memorial and East Halls. The William T. Jerome Library is open to the community. The library is a member of OhioLINK, a statewide library and information system that enables BGSU students, faculty and staff to borrow books from other Ohio libraries and to access to many online research databases. =Learning Commons= The Learning Commons opened in fall 2011, consolidating the Study Skills Center, Writing Center, and Mathematics and Statistics Tutoring Center.

(2002a). Positive organizational behavior: Developing and managing psychological strengths. Academy of Management Executive, 16(1): 57-72. For a positive psychological capacity to qualify for inclusion in POB, it must be positive and must have extensive theory and research foundations and valid measures. In addition, it must be state like, which would make it open to development and manageable for performance improvement. Finally, positive states that meet the POB definitional criteria are primarily researched, measured, developed, and managed at the individual, micro level.Luthans, F. (2002b). The need for and meaning of positive organizational behavior. Journal of Organizational Behavior, 23: 695-706. The state-like criterion distinguishes POB from other positive approaches that focus on positive traits, whereas its emphasis on micro, individual-level constructs separates it from positive perspectives that address positive organizations and their related macro-level variables and measures. Meeting the inclusion criteria for POB are the state-like psychological resource capacities of self-efficacy, hope, optimism, and resiliency and, when combined, the underlying higher- order, core construct of Positive psychological capital or PsyCap.Luthans, F., & Youssef, C. M. in 2007a. Emerging positive organizational behavior. Journal of Management, 33:321-349. General overview POB is the application of Positive psychology to the workplace. Its focus is on strengths and on building the best in the workplace under the basic assumption is that goodness and excellence can be analyzed and achieved. =Origins of POB: The Positive Psychology Movement= Although POB research is relatively new, its core ideas are based on ideas of earlier scholars. POB origins developed from the Positive Psychology movement, initiated in 1998 by Martin Seligman and colleagues. Positive Psychology aims to shift the focus in psychology from dysfunctional mental illness to mental health, calling for an increased focus on the building of human strength. The levels of analysis of positive psychology have been summarized to be at the subjective level (i.e., positive subjective experience such as well being and contentment with the past, flow and happiness in the present, and hope and optimism into the future); the micro, individual level (i.e., positive traits such as the capacity for love, courage, aesthetic sensibility, perseverance, forgiveness, spirituality, high talent, and wisdom); and the macro group and institutional level (i.e., positive civic virtues and the institutions that move individuals toward better citizenship such as responsibility, altruism, civility, moderation, tolerance, and a strong work ethic).Seligman, MD., & Csikszentmihalyi, M. (2000). Positive psychology. American Psychologist, 55, 5‚Äì14. By integrating positive psychology to organizational setting, Fred Luthans has pioneered the positive organizational behavior research in 1999. Since then, Luthans and colleagues have been attempting to find ways of designing work settings that emphasize people's strengths, where they can be both their best selves and at their best with each other. Thus far research has shown that employees who are satisfied and find fulfillment in their work are more productive, absent less, and demonstrate greater organizational loyalty. Despite initial studies and conceptualizations, the field of POB is still in its infancy. Further research regarding the precise antecedents, processes, and consequences of positive psychological behavior is needed. The challenge currently awaiting POB is to bring about a more profound understanding the real impact of positive states for organizational functioning and how these states can be enhanced within the work place.

The most visible feature of the development is the two unique equine sculptures known as The Kelpies. Overview The Forth and Clyde Canal was reopened as part of the Millennium Link project in 2001, and included the Falkirk Wheel, a revolving boat lift which connects it to the Union Canal. By 2014, the Falkirk Wheel had become one of Scotland's most popular tourist attractions, second only to Edinburgh Castle among destinations that charge for entry. The canals from there to Glasgow and Edinburgh have also become popular, but the final of the Forth and Clyde Canal from the Wheel to Grangemouth, descending through a flight of 12 locks and two single locks, was little used. The final part of the route to the original outlet at Grangemouth Docks had been obliterated by the construction of a motorway, a road, housing and factories. An alternative route was opened; it connected to the River Carron through a sea lock further upstream, but was not ideal, as the river was crossed by two road bridges and two pipe bridges below the entrance lock. This provided limited headroom when the tide was high, and insufficient water to enter the lock when it was low; an alternative route was therefore sought. The opportunity to remedy the situation and to make the eastern end of the canal more accessible to the general public was provided by the Big Lottery Fund Living Landmarks programme. ¬£140 million of funding was on offer, and in 2005 the Helix project was awarded one of the top four prizes, which kick-started the ¬£43 million project. The plans included a new section of canal, which would join the river below the four fixed bridges at a new sea lock. A new tunnel under the M9 motorway would be constructed by cut and cover methods, and a lift bridge would be inserted into the A905 road. The plans also included the re-routing of two high-pressure oil pipelines which crossed the area to feed the refinery at Grangemouth. The project was designed to transform under-used land between Falkirk and Grangemouth into a thriving urban greenspace called \\"The Helix\\". This includes a performance area, on which large-scale events can be held, facilities for watersports provided by the construction of a large lagoon, all surrounded by play areas and high quality pathways. The central area is known as Helix Park and the whole development covers some . Access around The Helix will be provided by of cycleways and footpaths. The name ‚ÄòHelix‚Äô comes from the distinctive shape of the project as it spirals down from Langlees to Laurieston and Polmont. Funding Falkirk Council led a Big Lottery Living Landmarks bid in partnership with British Waterways (Scotland) and Central Scotland Forest Trust. In 2007 the consortium were successful in their application, which saw 316 entries and 3 winners, with The Helix receiving an award of ¬£25m. This award was the first of its kind in Scotland through the programme, and the largest ever awarded by BIG to individual projects at the time. Additional funding was received from a number of other sources including the Scottish Government, Sustrans, Score Environmental and Forth Environmental Trust. A contract worth ¬£13.5 million was awarded to Balfour Beatty in early 2012 for the construction of the new canal. Another ¬£1 million contract for the visitor centre was awarded to Nicholl Russell Studios, a firm of architects based in Dundee. The Kelpies The most visible feature of the development is the two unique equine structures known as The Kelpies. Each structure measures around in height. The Kelpies were the brainchild of Andy Scott who also created the \\"Heavy Horse\\" sculpture at the side of the M8 motorway between Glasgow and Edinburgh. Another inspiration was the fact that Carnera, the UK's largest Clydesdale horse, once resided in Falkirk, hauling wagons of the soft drink Irn-Bru for Robert Barr. Construction of the 1,600-tonne foundations for the Kelpies began in early 2013. The steel structures for the Kelpies were fabricated at Sherburn-in-Elmet in North Yorkshire by SH Structures; delivery of the main steelwork began in March 2013. Each Kelpie weighs 300 tonnes, and once the structural steel framework was erected, they were clad in 990 uniquely shaped stainless steel plates, with construction completed in October 2013. The Kelpies hosts a visitor experience, enabling visitors to examine the complex and impressive internal structure of The Kelpies. By December 2012, the channel for the canal link had been excavated, and the first major artwork was erected in the Abbotshaugh Community Woodland in early 2013. The project was expected to be completed by the summer of 2014.

With partners around the globe, EarthLink is actively involved in the pursuit of a common cause‚Äîharmony between people and nature. Together with the local population, EarthLink designs strategies and measures to protect the environment and to further environmentally conscious development of the people's living spaces. To have locals participate in project work is an integral aspect for any long-term success. EarthLink together with its partners is involved in concrete projects to protect forests, oceans and coastal areas. Through environmental education for children and youth as well as adults and current decision makers from the political and business sector, EarthLink lays the foundation for ecologically sustainable development. Practically-oriented ways for a future that is worth living in are shown through forest camp-outs, joint reforestation programmes, seminars and workshops. Currently, EarthLink e.V. is campaigning against child labour. History EarthLink e.V. was founded in Munich, Germany in 1998 by Bernhard Henselmann, initially to take over the Projects for Protection of Rainforests in South America, Africa and Asia, following the disbanding of the organization Artists For Nature. From 1998 to 1999, EarthLink e.V. took part in the Slate Creek Preserve project. The aim of this project was to develop a management program for the conservation of the habitats around Slate Creek, Belize, through active protection from illegal felling, illegal hunting and fire damage. From 1998 to 1999, the NGO participated to the project for \\"Environmental education and its practice conversion by beekeeping with small farmers in Serra das Andorinhas, Brazil\\". The project was successful in several ways. The farmers are now capable to do the beekeeping by themselves and thus have an ecologically compatible source of income. Consequently, deforestation diminished visibly. From 2000 to 2003, EarthLink started an information campaign named \\"ThinkShrimp\\". The goal of this campaign was to raise the awareness of people regarding shrimp farming practices and their negative environmental and social consequences, such as the destruction of mangroves and bad working conditions for the people working in the shrimp industry, especially in Asia and Latin America. Since 2003, EarthLink e.V. is running an information campaign on child labour. The campaign officially started on 20 September, during the World Children's Day. The main purpose of this campaign is to raise the general awareness to this theme. To achieve this goal, EarthLink is primarily working on a database.

The hindwing darker red-brown.Distal border more broadly black with the yellowish rounded patches considerably smaller. ‚Äî bisanthe Fruhst. (66 b), with the type from Sta. Catharina, describes the southern form of the collective species, in the female recognizable at once by the almost uniformly large yellowish submarginal spots, which mostly extend from the anal angle to the apex, whilst in aega and mellinia they do not reach beyond the median part of the forewing. The circumcellular spots are larger and lighter. The black spot before the apex is narrower, more diffuse, and only extends to the middle of the anterior wall of the cell.The ground-colour of the yellow female much paler, on the hindwing without brown tinge ; the submarginal patches of the forewing more uniform, forming a more complete row. The females are among the most variable Morphids and three principal forms may be distinguished, including the normal (most commonly occurring), predominantly brown-yellow female, analogous to that of mellinia, and probably the ancestral form, still recalling the Brassolids, thus phyletically the oldest. Besides this we have mixta Fruhst., with partial blue reflections on the forewing (66 b), and finally pseudocypris Fruhst. (66 c), in which the yellow-brown gives place to a dark or light blue, which overspreads the whole upper surface. Whilst the males before me from Rio de Janeiro,Parana and Blumenau show inter se no differences worth mentioning, the males of bisanthe from Rio Grande do Sul can be at once separated from their more northern representatives by the predominantly white-grey instead of purple-brown under surface, which in addition is traversed by more sharply defined, i.e. more strongly black-bordered and consequently more distinct, grey-white or pale yellow longitudinal bands. Also the bisanthe females are paler yellow beneath and in the form pseudocypris with more prominent light areas than in mellinia. Thus in the north Esp√≠rito Santo with an almost uniform hot, damp climate all the year round, which produces a continuous, vast forest area covering the still almost unknown interior of the province, has a deep-coloured, one might say rainy-season form. Rio Grande do Sul, on the contrary, with pronounced separation of the seasons and great extremes in temperature, produces, on account of the dry prairies extending from Argentina, which restrict the primeval forest to a relatively narrow tract in the eastern slopes of the coast-mountains, a pale race with all the characteristics of a product of a dry region. Mabilde says that bisanthe occurs for 10‚Äì15 days in the spring and 20‚Äì40 days in the autumn on forest- paths. Of the rare females about 10‚Äî15 are found to males Burmeister knew an aega race with blue females from the Missiones in the state of Argentina, discovered there by Carlos BergFruhstorfer, H., 1913.

Most sports are governed by associations under the umbrella of the Cyprus Sport Organisation (). Football GSP Stadium in Nicosia Football is the most popular spectator and participation sport on the island. Football was introduced to Cyprus early in the 20th century by the British. As football became established, the clubs were united in agreeing that an official body was needed to regulate the sport. In September 1934, the Cyprus Football Association (CFA) was formed and matches were soon being played on an official basis. The association became a FIFA member in 1948 and an UEFA member in 1962. The Cypriot national team has not yet qualified for any major events, while major Cypriot clubs compete at European competitions with limited success. APOEL FC made history in 2012 by being the first Cypriot team to reach the quarter finals of Champions League. The Cypriot First Division is semi-professional with a few professional clubs. Basketball Basketball is also quite popular in Cyprus. The Cypriot league is semi-professional, but Cypriot teams have had good European campaigns. Recently, EKA AEL has finished 3rd in the FIBA EuroCup. Tennis Tennis in Cyprus has recently received more attention mainly due to Marcos Baghdatis' success in the ATP rankings. Baghdatis reached the final of the 2006 Australian Open, was a semifinalist at the 2006 Wimbledon Championships and reached a career-high ATP singles ranking of World No. 8 in August 2006.Marcos Baghdatis is the most popular athlete in Cyprus Athletics In recent years, Cypriot athletes have achieved some notable successes in Athletics. High jumper Kyriakos Ioannou has won medals in the IAAF World Athletics Championships, Commonwealth Games and the Mediterranean Games. Sprinter Eleni Artymata has also won multiple medals in the Mediterranean Games, including gold medals in the 200 metres in 2009 and 2013. Rugby union Union rugby is not very popular on Cyprus the last 2 years if became more popular. In this sport, in Cyprus, there are 4 different teams, Larnaca Spartans, Limassol Crusaders, Nicosia Bulldogs and Paphos Tigers. Olympic Games Cyprus in 2010 Winter Olympics Cyprus has sent athletes to every summer and winter Olympic Games held since 1980. Pavlos Kontides, competing in the men's Laser class sailing event, won the country's first-ever Olympic medal in 2012.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/olympics/9468928/London-2012-Olympics- Telegraph-quiz-answers.html Cyprus Rally The Cyprus Rally is a rallying competition held yearly in Cyprus since 1970. The event is run by the Cyprus Automobile Association[1] and is based in the city of Limassol (Lemesos). It is run on the winding gravel roads of the nearby mountains of Tro√∂dos. It was part of the FIA World Rally Championship from 2000 to 2006. In 2007, the event was part of the FIA Middle East Rally Championship. The same applies for 2008. It is due to rejoin the World Rally Championship in 2009. The Cyprus Rally Skiing The sport of Skiing first appeared on Cyprus sometime around 1934, when a group of people created the first \\"Mountaineering Club\\" of the island. Unfortunately though, the ensuing World War II meant that the development of skiing was delayed for several years. The Cyprus Ski Club was created on March 2, 1947 and since then it has a leading role in the development of skiing on the island. The first lift was built and operated on the eastern face of Mt. Olympus using primitive equipment, while a second lift was built in 1951 near the \\"Dolphin\\" restaurant, to the west of Troodos Square (the remnants of this lift, which was powered by the engine of a Ford truck, can still be seen). After the independence of Cyprus in 1960, the Ski Club developed into its modern form, with a ski Federation under the auspices of the FIS, and four regional clubs (Nicosia, Limassol, Troodos, and Famagusta) competing in various skiing competitions. Until 1968, mobile lifts operated by the British Army were used, but in 1968 the first lift owned by the CSC was built at Sun Valley 1. The big lift at North Face was the second to be built, followed by Hermes (Sun Valley 2) in 1973, and Hera (North Face 2) in 1986. Simultaneously, more trails were created reaching 9 by 1986. Each of the lifts has its own base area with a cafeteria, and the various lifts are interconnected by a trail network. Alongside of the development of the area, the CSC initiated the tradition of skiing lessons for the school children of the area from the 1959 season onwards. In 1960, the Federation introduced the annual Pan Cyprian ski competitions. Since 1963, Cypriot skiers have started participating in international competitions, with first participation in the World Championships coming in 1978 at Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany. The first Winter Olympic participation of Cyprus took place in the 1980 Olympics at Lake Placid. Ever since, Cyprus has been actively participating in the various regional competitions, as well as the World Championships and the Olympics. Today many hundreds of Cypriots and perhaps as many foreigners enjoy the wonderful sport of skiing every winter on the beautiful slopes of Mt Olympus. Skiing, with its 60-year plus history on this island, is here not only to stay, but to continue its growth. Paragliding It is a relatively new sport in Cyprus, but some clubs has developed around the island. Cyprus Paragliding Club is one of the most active in improving the quality of flights, and finding new sites where paragliding could be possible. From time to time local competitions are organized. Noticeable sites are Curium, Stavrovouni, where is possible to fly above the Stavrovouni Monastery.

It was constructed in 1890 and is a good example of stick-style architecture. The house was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1991. History The Ruffin Drew Fletcher, or simply R. D. Fletcher, House was constructed in 1890. Ruffin Drew Fletcher took a job with the Chicago, Wilmington and Vermilion Coal Company in 1876 and moved to Streator, Illinois. The coal company constructed the house for Fletcher and he stayed in it until 1900 when he was transferred to another location and the house was sold to Dr. George Dicus.Bucholtz, Arthur and Felicia. \\"Ruffin Drew Fletcher House\\", (PDF), National Register of Historic Places Registration Form, March 28, 1991, Illinois Historic Preservation Agency, accessed May 15, 2008. Architecture The Fletcher House shows the characteristics of Victorian stick-style architecture in its decorative ornamentation and roof massing. It falls into a subcategory of stick-style houses that Virginia and Lee McAlester described as the gabled roof classification in their Field Guide to American Houses. The Fletcher House contains many of the specific elements described by the McAlesters. Outbuildings There are two outbuildings on the property, a one-story wash house and a two-story carriage house. Both structures were built at the same time as the house and also in the stick style. The outbuildings lack the ornamentation of the house but still contribute to the architectural significance of the Fletcher House. Historic significance The Fletcher House maintains its 1890s architectural integrity. On a local level, the earliest changes to the house, such as the installation of electric fans, illustrates the life style of the upper middle class in Streator, Illinois. The Ruffin Drew Fletcher House was added to the National Register of Historic Places on August 5, 1991. Both outbuildings were included as contributing properties in the National Register listing.

It charted at number 18 the first week in Sweden. When Jeff Scott Soto, Marcel Jacob and Pontus Norgren where in Stockholm, Sweden laying vocals for their new band called Humanimal, they decided to perform at the Sweden Rock Festival in S√∂lvesborg, Sweden, thanks to dj Dr. Rock from the Swedish Radio Rock Klassiker who persuaded the guys to perform it. They played at the Rockklassiker stage with a 2000 crowd capacity. Two nights before the festival gig, Talisman played in Stockholm. Because of a miscommunication between Jamie, Pontus, Marcel and the guys doing the mobile recording stuff, Marcel's entire gear (bass included!) was left at the venue in Stockholm instead of travelling with everybody else‚Äôs gear down to S√∂lvesborg, south of Sweden, where the Sweden Rock Festival takes place. Marcel wanted to leave the festival but, after looking inside the tent which was fully packed with a crowd shouting for Talisman, he decided not to turn his back on those people. So Marcel and other people started to run around the festival area to look for a bass to be borrowed in time for the show: Magnus Ros√©n from HammerFall finally lent Marcel one of his bass guitars. The show went great and, since another band playing at Sweden Rock Festival had a mobile hard disc recording unit, Christer Wedin managed to get the Talisman show recorded as well. But the sound Marcel had at the show was not too exciting, severe problems with Jeff's microphone and some out of tune guitars needed some fixing. So he and Pontus went into the studio to record live together the entire show exactly the same way they would have done it on stage.

Geography Created with the passage of the California Wilderness Act of 1984 by the U.S. Congress, the South Sierra Wilderness is Wilderness.net acreage data in size. It is managed by the U.S. Forest Service, and within Sequoia National Forest and Inyo National Forest. The South Sierra Wilderness is the southernmost Forest Service-managed section of a continuous chain of wilderness areas protecting the Sierra Nevada crest from Walker Pass to Lake Tahoe. Elevations range from about near Kennedy Meadows, up to at Olancha Peak. The Wild and Scenic South Fork of the Kern River bisects the wilderness on the east side, in a north‚Äìsouth direction. Ecology Wildlife includes the large Monache mule deer herd, the sensitive Sierra Nevada red fox, pine martens, mountain lions, and American black bears. =Flora= Two very different landscapes with distinct habitats are protected within the South Sierra Wilderness: *The southern portion is the lower Kern Plateau landform, with low, forested ridges, narrow meadows, and woodlands of Jeffrey pine (Pinus jeffreyi), red fir (Abies magnifica) and lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta). *The northern portion is more mountainous, and includes the alpine flora of Olancha Peak and Round Mountain. Rare California native plants observed in the area are Kern ceanothus (Ceanothus pinetorum), a locally endemic shrub found on slopes in pine and red fir forests, at elevations between . Ceanothus pinetorum is not currently state or federally listed under the Endangered Species Act, but is considered by the California Native Plant Society as \\"uncommon enough that their status should be monitored regularly\\". Rare wildflowers include Kern Canyon clarkia (Clarkia xantiana ssp. parviflora) and goosefoot yellow violet (Viola pinetorum ssp. grisea), both are also endemic to California. Recreational activities Recreational activities include backpacking, day hiking, fishing, rock climbing, mountaineering, skiing and snowshoeing.

In the United States, the first episode of the series originally aired on Howdy Doody in 1955. The series was revived multiple times, with the last episode airing on December 31, 1988. The first season was broadcast on NBC, while the following seasons were made for syndication. A majority of the episodes are available on DVD in multiple regions, as well as via online streaming services. Series overview Pilots Art Clokey's first clay animation film was Gumbasia (1953), a short film showcasing a series of clay shapes twisting, turning and contorting in kaleidoscopic patterns. Clokey showed the film to producer Sam Engel, who suggested that Clokey apply the technique to form children's stories. Although Gumbasia didn't originally air on television, it is usually considered to be the first pilot episode of what would become The Gumby Show. Soon afterward, Clokey completed an official pilot for NBC through the financial assistance of Engel. Entitled \\"Gumby on the Moon\\", this marked the first appearance of Gumby. The pilot was then shown on Howdy Doody to much success, and NBC ordered Gumby his own series. Episodes Since information about the original airdates or original production order is unknown, these listings are reasonable estimates of the original production order. The following was compiled based on the evolution of the voices and appearance of the characters. Most of the 1950s episodes were originally presented as 11-minute stories, but they were split up and presented as separate entries when syndicated along with episodes produced in the 1960s. Several of these abbreviated versions borrow footage from their counterparts, while some had new material filmed specifically for these shorter versions (as evidenced by a brief change in how the characters look in the newer footage). New title sequences were filmed for half of these, while the other half retained the original title sequence. For identification purposes, all 1950s episodes have been listed with the original title of the uncut version followed by any counterparts that were created when these episodes were split up. =The Gumby Show (1956)= =Syndicated revival (1960‚Äì68)= =Gumby Adventures (1988)= The show was revived in 1988 as Gumby Adventures with 99 new episodes and five shorts (\\"Gone Clayzy\\", \\"Gumball Gumby\\", \\"Chatter Box\\", \\"Clay Trix\\", and \\"The Funny Bathtub\\").

These 5 episodes have Native American stereotypes that are now considered politically incorrect, thus the reason why they were skipped over. In 2013, Beyond Home Entertainment released the complete series on NTSC DVDs in Australia as a JB Hi-Fi exclusive. This is a 7 disc, collector's edition set within a tin steelbook case and includes Gumbasia, 6 \\"bumper\\" clips, and every episode from the 1950s, 1960s, and 1980s (including the 5 shorts skipped over on other sets). The film transfers are said to be the Premavision authorized official versions which are all new restorations from the original negatives and can be played on Regions 1 & 4 DVD players (possibly other regions as well). Throughout the 1980s Family Home Entertainment released a majority of the 1950s and 1960s Gumby episodes on various VHS collections (the only episodes that didn't get a release were \\"This Little Piggy\\", \\"Tricky Train\\", and \\"Foxy Box\\"). These all retained their original audio tracks as they were released prior to the 1987 revival series, in which completely new soundtracks had to be recorded due to licensing issues involving the original soundtracks. In 2002, Kid Rhino Home Video (a division distributed by Warner Bros. Family Entertainment and WEA) (a subsidiary of AOL Time Warner) released a 7-disc DVD compilation containing 110 episodes from the 1950s and 1960s. The set was not widely distributed, and it received much negative feedback because the film elements used were the 1980s reissues with the redubbed soundtracks and voices. Three years later, Rhino Home Video/Rhino Retrovision released a two-volume set entitled The Very Best New Adventures of Gumby. Classic Media had a few home media releases of Gumby starting on September 4, 2007 with Gumby Essentials, Volume 1, which contained episodes from each season of the show. In 2008, Classic Media released a director's cut of Gumby: The Movie that included bonus episodes from the series. That same year, the company also released a 2-disc DVD set containing four Christmas themed programs. In addition to a compilation of Gumby episodes titled Gumby Season's Greetings, the other programs include Casper the Friendly Ghost, Fat Albert, and George of the Jungle. In the fall of 2010, Columbia Music Entertainment released two compilation DVDs in Japan titled with permission from Premavision and Classic Media. The two DVD series contains the best selected episodes from both 1950s‚Äì1960s era to the 1980s era, all digitally remastered and each have Japanese subtitles. Two DVDs were released: Gumby Best Selection: Early Years 50s-60s,http://columbia.jp/prod-info/COBM-5829/ released on September 1, 2010 followed by its English subtitled version on November 17, 2010 and Gumby Best Selection: 80s,http://columbia.jp/prod- info/COBM-5830/ released on November 17, 2010. =Unofficial releases= There have been many home media releases that were not authorized by Art Clokey or Clokey Productions, and therefore are considered unofficial releases. In 1994, GoodTimes Entertainment released Christmas with Gumby on VHS. The set features \\"Scrooge Loose\\", \\"Santa-Witch\\", \\"Pigeon in a Plum Tree\\", and \\"Toy Crazy\\"/\\"Toy Joy\\" edited together as one half-hour program without any episode title sequences. It was re-released on DVD in 2003. GoodTimes Entertainment also released the VHS Fun with Gumby in 1994, containing the episodes \\"The Kachinas\\", \\"Tree Trouble\\", \\"Lion Drive\\", \\"Yard Work Made Easy\\", and \\"The Magic Show\\" (edited for time). In 1996, GoodTimes Entertainment released the VHS Gumby's Greatest Adventures. Later released on DVD in 2003, the set features \\"Toying Around\\", \\"Sad King Ott's Daughter\\", \\"The Blockheads\\", \\"Gumby Crosses the Delaware\\" (edited for time), \\"Gumby Concerto\\", \\"The Glob\\", \\"Gold Rush Gumby\\", \\"Baker's Tour\\" (edited for time), \\"The Black Knight\\", and \\"Gumby Racer\\". In 2013, Legend Films released Gumby's Best Episodes (The Original Adventures) on DVD. The set includes: \\"Tree Trouble\\", \\"Lion Drive\\", \\"Yard Work Made Easy\\", \\"Sad King Otts Daughter\\", \\"The Blockheads\\", \\"Gumby Concerto\\", \\"The Glob\\", \\"Bakers Tour\\", \\"The Black Knight\\", \\"The Kachinas\\", \\"In a Fix\\", \\"The Witty Witch\\", \\"The Groobee\\", \\"Gumby Racer\\", \\"Rain for Roo\\", and \\"Hidden Valley\\". =Public domain= Many budget-priced DVD collections can be found at dollar stores because some episodes have fallen into the public domain. Gumby episodes believed to be in the public domain include \\"Too Loo\\", \\"Gumby Concerto\\", \\"Robot Rumpus\\", \\"Mysterious Fires,\\" \\"Stuck on Books\\", \\"Gold Rush Gumby\\", and \\"Tricky Train\\". These collections also often include Clokey's experimental film, Gumbasia. =Restoration= From 2005 to 2006, a project took place in attempt to restore the entire 1950s and 1960s Gumby library. These versions are all official and authorized as they contain Premavision copyright notices at the beginning. , a total of 36 restored transfers exist (33 episodes, the pilot cutdown \\"Gumby on the Moon\\", the experimental film \\"Gumbasia\\" and a stand-alone transfer of the 1964 theme-song intro). The 1950s episodes were assembled back to their original 11-minute format as close as possible with the existing material. These restorations were not perfect as the original negatives for the 11-minute versions appear to be lost and now only exist split into their syndication halves. This is very noticeable as the restoration for \\"The Magic Show\\"/\\"The Magic Wand\\" retains the 1960s title sequence \\"The Magic Wand\\" instead of the original title sequence \\"The Magic Show\\". On a similar note, a narration track recorded for the beginning of the syndicated half titled \\"Gumby Concerto\\" is still heard on the restoration for \\"Too Loo\\"/\\"Gumby Concerto\\". Some of these restored versions have since been released on DVD by Classic Media, the rightsholder at the time these restorations were done. =Online distribution= In 2007, the batch of restored versions were made available to view and/or download on various Internet video sites. Most of them were first made available for free viewing on AOL's In2TV, while later a select few became available on YouTube. These episodes were also made available to purchase through Amazon's video-on-demand service Amazon Video. A few of the later additions to YouTube wound up being sourced from 1980s VHS transfers from Family Home Entertainment instead of actually being restored versions, indicating that the project to restore the entire Gumby library might have been either abandoned or temporarily stalled. The complete 1987 series was later added to Amazon. While many of the aforementioned services are no longer active, Legend Films' Gumby's Best Episodes is available for streaming on Hulu. In November 2014, the entire first and second seasons of Gumby were launched on television and online via the children's on demand network Kabillion.

He also has a thirty-minute syndicated radio program titled Herald of Joy.\\"Nominee for ORU post is praised\\" Tulsa World (United States), January 22, 2009. Rutland is married to Alison Rutland (n√©e Permenter) and has three children. Early life Rutland was born in Commerce, Texas but grew up and was raised throughout the southeastern United States, including Florida and Georgia, until finally coming of age in Maryland. He met his future wife, Alison, in his junior year of high school, where she was a member of the cheerleading squad. Upon graduation from high school, Rutland entered the University of Maryland, College Park initially to earn a degree in public relations and to pursue a career in politics (Rutland, 1987 p. 2). Eventually, however, he began to pursue a career in Christian ministry and upon graduation from the University of Maryland, he enrolled in the Candler School of Theology at Emory University. Rutland credits this change in direction to several supernatural experiences that took place in his youth. He became a born-again Christian while attending an evangelical youth camp in Blue Lake, Alabama, and it was there that Rutland believes to have received a mandate from God calling him to be a preacher (Rutland, 1987 p. 4). Some years later, his wife Alison, also a born-again Christian, indicated that she too had received a word from God that Rutland was to become a minister and it is his wife's confirmation that he credited as the deciding factor in his decision to abandon his dreams of politics and pursue a life of ministry. Upon completion of study at Emory University, Rutland's first assignment was at the Little River United Methodist Church in Woodstock, Georgia (Rutland 1987, p. 8). Later, he became a pastor at Oak Grove United Methodist Church in Atlanta, Georgia. During his tenure at Oak Grove, Rutland claims that his marriage was disintegrating and that he attempted suicide.\\"Renaissance Man\\" Charisma Magazine (United States.), July 8, 2009. (Rutland, 1987 p. 16). It was at a \\"Conference on Power for Ministry Today\\" held at a Ramada Inn in Atlanta, Georgia in December 1975, that Rutland was baptized in the Holy Spirit as evidenced by speaking in other tongues (Rutland, 1987 p. 23). Rutland credits this experience as the real turning point in his life (Rutland, 1987 p. 23). Missions work After his experience in 1975, Rutland began preaching at revivals and conferences in a number of churches and it was during this period that he believes God began calling him to the mission field. His first mission was to Mexico in 1977 where he worked with American missionary couple Jim and Helen Mann in the village of Laborcitas (Rutland, 1987 p. 51‚Äì53) While Rutland undertook many other missions to Mexico, his foray into missions did not begin in earnest until 1979 when, after he believed he had received a revelation that God would be sending him all over the world to carry out missions, he traveled to Ghana (Rutland, 1987 p. 77) Initially, Rutland was forced to wait in London, England, for several days as Accra Airport, Ghana, was closed as a result of an attempted coup on May 15, 1979, by forces loyal to future leader of Ghana, Flight Lieutenant Jerry Rawlings. Rutland's mission to Ghana in 1979 consisted of a 28-day crusade in which he preached in many places and churches throughout the country, including the cities of Accra and Kumasi. In Kumasi, he worked a great deal with a man named Brew Riverson, the president of the small Methodist training college in the city (Wesley College) and whom he had become acquainted with several years before at a rally he had held in Atlanta, Georgia. In the following years, Rutland carried out many other evangelistic missions to many countries, including Ghana; among the many places where Rutland undertook missions in the subsequent years were Nigeria, India, Benin, Colombia, Peru, Thailand, and Mexico among others (Rutland, 1987). It was also during this time that he founded the Trinity Foundation, later renamed Global Servants. Originally intended to be an evangelistic organization operating within the United States, Global Servants became an evangelistic missions association that has carried out operations all over the world, from the founding of bible training schools in many different countries to the founding of the House of Grace in Chiang Rai City, Thailand, in 1988. The House of Grace was started as a place of refuge for young ethnic Akha girls at risk of becoming ensnared in the lucrative Southeast Asian sex slave trade. Later pastoral work In 1987, Rutland was invited by the senior pastor of Mount Paran Church of God in Atlanta, Georgia, to serve as an Associate Pastor for a period of two years.Rutland, 1987 p. 177 After completing his two years at Mount Paran, Rutland took the helm of the financially struggling and leaderless Calvary Assembly of God in Orlando, Florida, in 1990.\\"Calvary History\\" Calvary Assembly of God (United States.), July 8, 2009. When Rutland arrived at Calvary, the church was reeling from the effects of a financial crisis (bankruptcy was thought to be inevitable), a sexual scandal, and drastically reduced membership.\\"Mark Rutland tapped to lead ORU\\" Charisma Magazine (United States.), July 8, 2009. During Rutland's leadership of Calvary Assembly of God from 1990 to 1995, he oversaw the reduction in the church's debt by $4 million from $15 million. Calvary was among the largest Assembly of God congregations in the United States and during Rutland's leadership of the church, attendance increased from 1,800 to 3,600. President of Southeastern University In 1999, Rutland was asked to become the new president of Southeastern University of the Assemblies of God in Lakeland, Florida\\"Dr. Mark Rutland Announced as President-Elect of ORU\\" Christian News Wire (United States.), July 8, 2009. At that time, Southeastern University was struggling financially, facing many maintenance issues, and was suffering from declining enrollment. In the ten years since he took over the institution, Southeastern transitioned to become a full university and experienced greater than a tripling in its enrollment, increasing from around 1,000 to greater than 3,000. As well, more than $50 million has been invested in various construction and renovation projects on campus, including new dormitories, a new cafeteria, administrative offices, a fitness center and a bookstore. President of Oral Roberts University On January 28, 2009, the board of trustees of Oral Roberts University in Tulsa, Oklahoma, elected Rutland as the third president of the institution. Rutland's selection came about after he was recommended by the university's presidential search committee to the board of trustees. The committee had been formed following the resignation of the school's former president, evangelist and son of the institution's namesake, Richard Roberts, in 2007. Roberts' resignation came on the heels of a financial scandal and a wrongful termination lawsuit filed by several former faculty members of the university, as well as numerous claims of misuse of funds and impropriety directed against his wife, Lindsay Roberts. Rutland's election marks the first time in the history of Oral Roberts University that a person not a member of the Roberts family has held the office of president. Rutland was selected from a pool of more than 130 applicants to lead the university and he assumed the office of president on July 1, 2009, taking the reins of the institution from Interim President Dr. Ralph Fagin, who was appointed to the position following the resignation of Richard Roberts in 2007.\\"ORU taps trustees, interim president \\" Tulsa World (Tulsa, OK), May 8, 2009. Although Oral Roberts was not personally involved with the selection process, Rutland is reportedly the only person he seriously considered to take over the presidency of the university.\\"Tulsa: Oral Roberts has faith in university leader Mark Rutland\\" NewsOK (Oklahoma City, OK), February 15, 2009. Rutland initially told ORU he was not interested in the position, and would not even submit a resume, but was eventually persuaded to accept the post by ORU board chairman Mart Green.Bill Sherman, \\"ORU president finishes first year\\", Tulsa World, July 7, 2010.

According to an Associated Press report, Rutland would make a yearly salary of $275,000.Justin Juozapavicius,\\"Family tradition ends as Oral Roberts U. revamps\\", Associated Press, reprinted in Dayton Daily News, July 1, 2009.

The film was originally released to theaters in 1981 as a concert film. It was later released on VHS, Betamax and laserdisc video format, but has not been officially released on DVD. Film and video releases In 1980, Black Sabbath co-headlined a number of the U.S. shows on their worldwide \\"Heaven & Hell Tour\\" with Blue √ñyster Cult, at the suggestion of Sandy Pearlman, who was managing both bands at the time. These shows became known as the \\"Black and Blue Tour\\" and were very well attended, often ranking in Billboard magazine's weekly \\"Top Boxoffice\\" charts. The two bands' October 17, 1980 performances at Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Hempstead, New York were filmed and edited together into the concert film Black and Blue, which was released to theaters in 1981 after the conclusion of the tour. Following its initial release, the film played for some time on the theatrical midnight movie circuit in the United States. In the 1980s, it was released for the home video market in VHS format by Polygram Video in the UK, and by Warner Bros. in US. It was also released in laserdisc format by Polygram in UK and Warner Bros. in Japan. According to Martin Popoff, a Betamax version was also issued. In 2002, a DVD release of the film was announced by Castle Pictures, and was available for pre-order from online merchants. However, the release was postponed several times before finally being cancelled in January 2003. In 2004, a second announcement was made of an upcoming DVD release, this time by Universal Video. However, the release was again postponed and then cancelled at the last minute. A few copies were sold by some record stores in European countries that had received advance shipments before the withdrawal. Since then, there has been no official DVD release of the film, although various bootlegs are available. Several sources, including Castle Pictures, have indicated that the DVD has not been released because Black Sabbath, in particular Tony Iommi, do not want it released. The 2011 book Black Sabbath FAQ by Martin Popoff contained statements from members of Blue √ñyster Cult about the video, with Joe Bouchard saying that Iommi and Sabbath opposed release of the video, and Eric Bloom opining that the video was not very good due to the lack of post-production, which was too expensive at the time the film was made. On a 2013 episode of That Metal Show, Buck Dharma of Blue √ñyster Cult talked very minimally about the release and said to his knowledge, the reason it has not been re-released is because the members of Black Sabbath don't want it being distributed, for reasons unknown to Dharma.

He made his opera debut in 1997 and his international career has included performances with the Metropolitan Opera, La Scala di Milano, Opera de Paris, Bayerische Staatsoper, Opera Australia, Liceo de Barcelona, among many others. In 2008, he made his Broadway debut as Emile De Becque in a revival of South Pacific, for which he won the Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Musical, the Drama Desk Award, the Outer Critics Circle Award, the Theatre World Award.

Biography Szot was born in S√£o Paulo of Polish parents who emigrated to Brazil after World War II. He began his musical training in piano at the age of five and later added violin and classical ballet. However, at age 21, a knee injury cut short any aspirations for a career in dance, causing him, with encouragement from his instructor, to pursue singing instead. Szot studied at Jagiellonian University in Poland. He began singing professionally in 1990 with the National Song & Dance Ensemble \\"≈ölƒÖsk\\". Later, he made his professional opera debut in a production of Il barbiere di Siviglia at the Municipal Theatre of S√£o Paulo in 1997. Since then, he has performed with the New York City Opera, the Palm Beach Opera, the Canadian Opera Company, Op√©ra de Marseille, and Vlaamse Opera, among others, in such operas as L'elisir d'amore, La boh√®me, Don Giovanni, Cavalleria rusticana, Pagliacci, Carmen, Cos√¨ fan tutte, Le nozze di Figaro and Maria Golovin. In March 2010 he made his debut at the Metropolitan Opera as Kovalyov in Dmitri Shostakovich's The Nose. Szot returned to the Metropolitan Opera as Escamillo sharing the stage with the French tenor Roberto Alagna and as Lescaut in Manon along with Anna Netrebko. Szot returned to the Met in 2014 as the Captain of the Achille Lauro in The Death of Klinghoffer. He sang the role of Guglielmo in Mozart's Cos√¨ fan tutte at the Palais Garnier, and at the Aix-en-Provence Festival in Le nozze di Figaro. In 2013 he sang in The Nose at Teatro dell'Opera di Roma and at La Scala in the role of Filip Filippovich, the protagonist of Alexander Raskatov's 2009 opera A Dog's Heart. In 2018 and 2019, Szot sang the role of the Celebrant in the Chicago Symphony Orchestra's performance of Leonard Bernstein's Mass under the direction of Marin Alsop with the Chicago Children's Choir and the Highland Park High School Marching Band.

Contemporary versions of the Royal arms show an abbreviated motto, in the form of IN DEFENS or, where English is used as an alternative, IN DEFENCE. The motto appears above the crest of the arms, in the tradition of Scottish heraldry.The Public Register of Arms, Flags and Badges of Canada  Origins  Adopted during the reign of the Stewart dynasty, and certainly in use by the reign of James IV (1488‚Äì1513), \\"In my defens God me defend\\" was originally the only motto associated with Scotland's Royal arms, Typographical Antiquities: an historical account of printing in England , by Joseph Ames with versions appearing in both truncated and abbreviated forms; In my defens, for example, having been adopted for the Royal arms of James IV. (An embroidered wall hanging depicting these arms is displayed in the Great Hall at Stirling Castle). Later versions of the arms which feature the abbreviated form IN DEFENS include the armorial by Sir David Lyndsay of the Mount, which appears in his Register of Scottish Arms (1542). The motto is also associated with an old Scots prayer, of which there are several versions where In my defens God me defend appears as the opening line, including: And: Also, in the form of a couplet: Another variation of the phrase, appearing as BE MY DEFENS GOD ME DEFEND FOREVER MORE, is to be found engraved upon a number of traditional Ballock knives, with one particular example, (dated 1624), now forming part of the Arms and Armour collection of the Art Institute of Chicago.My Armoury Accessed 28 July 2008 Nemo me impune lacessit Arms of Elizabeth II, showing Nemo me impune lacessit in addition to IN DEFENS During the reign of Charles II (1660‚Äì1685), the Royal arms used in Scotland were augmented with the inclusion of the Latin motto of the Order of the Thistle, the highest Chivalric order of the Kingdom of Scotland. The motto of the Order of the Thistle, Nemo me impune lacessit, appears on a blue scroll overlying the compartment.Heraldry ‚Äì The Arms of the Earl of Dundee (taken from a book \\"Scottish Heraldry\\" by MD Dennis, published in 1999 by the Heraldic Society of Scotland: ) (Previously, only the collar of the Order of the Thistle had appeared on the arms.) The addition by King Charles of Nemo me impune lacessit ensured that the blazon of his Royal arms used in Scotland complemented that of his Royal arms used elsewhere, in that two mottoes were displayed. The blazon used elsewhere had included the French motto of the arms, Dieu et mon droit, together with the Old French motto of the Order of the Garter, the highest Chivalric order of the Kingdom of England. The motto of the Order of the Garter, Honi soit qui mal y pense, appears on a representation of the garter surrounding the shield. Henceforth, the versions of the Royal arms used in Scotland and elsewhere were to include both the motto of the arms of the respective kingdom and the motto of the associated order of chivalry.  Confusion  The rules governing heraldry and armorial achievements in England have possibly resulted in a degree of confusion as to the status of the mottoes associated with both the Royal coat of arms of Scotland and those of the United Kingdom used in Scotland. In English heraldry the motto is placed beneath the shield, whereas in Scottish heraldry the motto is placed above the crest. Appearing beneath the shield may have led to the conclusion that Nemo me impune lacessit is the motto of the Royal arms, whereas historical evidence coupled with the conventions of heraldry in Scotland would suggest that In my defens God me defend is the motto of the Royal arms and therefore the motto of Scotland itself.  Usage  Crest and motto The motto IN DEFENS not only appears on the Royal arms, but also, in conjunction with the crest of the Royal arms, upon the logo of both the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service and the General Register Office for Scotland.

The goal of a world car program is to save costs and increase quality by standardizing parts and design for a single vehicle in a certain class, in hopes of using the cost savings to deliver a superior product that satisfies expectations for quality, appeal and performance of automobile buyers worldwide. Examples include the Ford Mondeo and Focus, modern no-frills cars such as the Fiat Palio, Dacia Logan and VW Fox along with luxury cars such as the BMW 3 Series and Lexus LS. History of the world car In the pioneering days of the automotive industry, automobiles were primarily designed for the local market that the manufacturer was based in, such as the Ford Model T, which was engineered to cope with the rural lifestyle and rugged terrain that most automobile buyers in the United States had to contend with in the early days of the automobile. However, the Model T was arguably the first world car, with knock-down kits being assembled in locations such as Canada, England and Argentina. The two largest manufacturers at the time, Ford Motor Company and General Motors (GM), both of the United States, were focused on expanding globally, with General Motors either acquiring or partnering with local automobile manufacturers, such as Opel of Germany, Vauxhall of England and Holden of Australia, while Ford created overseas subsidiaries such as Ford of Germany, Ford of Britain and Ford Australia. Both Ford and GM's overseas subsidiaries would later develop their own line of bespoke automobiles independently of their American parents. In 1933, Ford introduced their first car designed for European tastes that was not sold in the United States, the Ford Model Y, developed by Ford of Britain, and also manufactured by Ford of Germany as the Ford K√∂ln. General Motors responded with the Opel 1.2 litre, developed by GM in the United States but exclusively built and sold in Europe. This would begin the divergence of vehicles sold by Ford and General Motors worldwide. In Australia, the Coup√© utility was beginning to catch on in popularity, as ‚Äúa vehicle to go to church in on a Sunday and which can carry our pigs to market on Mondays.‚Äù =Economy cars= The Volkswagen Beetle was a success worldwide due to affordability and economy. To a lesser extent, its European contemporaries succeeded in global markets with the original Mini and Citro√´n 2CV. The Toyota Corolla and Nissan Sunny were the first two-passenger cars from Japan to be popular worldwide, thanks to a combination of durability and economy. The 1970s energy crisis saw Japanese and European manufacturers make inroads worldwide as American and Australian manufacturers focused on larger and less fuel-efficient cars. =Diversification= In the 1980s, compacts including the Beetle evolved into the C-segment, featuring vehicles such as the Volkswagen Golf and Ford Escort, along with the supermini class such as the Opel Corsa and Fiat Panda, which has become the leading segment in the European car market. Japanese domestic market vehicles increasingly focused on performance or luxury, featuring exclusive vehicles or variants of existing cars unique to Japan, such as the Nissan Laurel and Toyota Soarer. Buoyed by exports to the United States, Volkswagen opened a plant in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania in 1978. Honda, Nissan, Toyota along with an Isuzu-Subaru joint venture also opened plants in the United States during the 1980s, while their Japanese compatriots Mazda, Suzuki and Mitsubishi Motors partnered with their American affiliates, Ford, General Motors and Chrysler, respectively, to create joint ventures in the lucrative North American market. The Honda Accord was the first vehicle from a foreign brand that became the top selling car in the United States in 1989. From then on, Japanese manufacturers designed their midsize sedans to primarily appeal to the lucrative family sedan sector in the United States, with their sales in Japan and other markets an afterthought. Toyota launched the first Camry that exceeded Japanese width restrictions in 1991, a successful attempt that saw them surpass the Accord and Ford Taurus for best- selling passenger car in the United States, and Honda launched a bespoke Accord for the North American market in 1997 that was not sold in Japan or Europe. =Modern attempts at a world car= Models in the C-segment have usually shared a platform worldwide, with minimal styling changes for each market they are sold in. The most successful C-segment car is the Toyota Corolla. The Ford Mondeo was the first modern attempt by an automaker to make a mainstream D-segment car that specifically designed to successful in the United States and Europe and was billed as a \\"world car\\", succeeding the Ford Sierra in Europe and the Ford Tempo in North America. Market needs worldwide Despite being a global design initially, world cars have to have specific changes made per national laws/regulations, or cultural differences / market tastes where these are divergent. For example, fuel prices vary greatly in different countries, and this affects the choice of engine fitted. One vehicle that is an example of this is the Volkswagen Golf (currently sold in the Mk VI version), offered only with a 2.5-litre 5-cylinder petrol in the United States and Canada, but in Europe, it has 1.4, 1.4 TSI turbo, 1.6, 2.0, 2.0 turbo 4-cylinder and 3.2 V6 petrol and 1.9 SDI diesel and 2.0 TDI turbodiesel engines. The differences between market needs are not just reflected by equipment levels (in Europe the Golf offers multiple trim levels, compared to North America where it is only available in two versions, and sold as a premium hatchback rather than a workaday family car as in Europe.

He is a longtime collaborator with fellow hometown native Tech N9ne and is signed to his label Strange Music from its inception since 1999. Career Krizz Kaliko began his musical career in the late 1990s when he began working with local producer IcyRoc Kraven. Another local rapper by the name of Tech N9ne was also collaborating with IcyRoc at the time, which led to the two rappers meeting. At the time, Tech N9ne was working on a song titled \\"Who You Came To See\\" and Kaliko made a comment that the song could have a better hook. Tech offered up the opportunity to prove his case, and Tech was blown away when Kaliko did. Tech would bring Kaliko into his \\"inner circle\\", which would eventually result in Kaliko signing to the new-found label Strange Music co-owned by Tech N9ne and Travis O'Guin. Since then, Kaliko has often contributed to albums put out by Tech N9ne, be it being featured as a rapper or simply providing background vocals for tracks on the album. Although most of his work is that of his collaborations with Tech N9ne, he has also performed similar tasks for former labelmates Kutt Calhoun, Rittz, and fellow labelmates Skatterman & Snug Brim, Ces Cru, and Prozak. Other collaborations include tracks with the Kottonmouth Kings, Potluck, E-40, T-Pain, Twiztid, Andy Mineo, Chris B, and RM from South Korean group BTS . His debut album, Vitiligo, released on May 6, 2008, charted on several Billboard charts, including peaking at number 19 on the Top Independent Albums in the week of May 28, 2008. In the same week, he peaked at number 167 on the Billboard 200. His second studio album, Genius, was released on July 14, 2009. A number of his songs can be heard in the background of the strip club scenes in the movie Big Fan starring Patton Oswalt. Kaliko chose the title Shock Treatment for his third studio album. Other titles he considered were Son of Sam and Walk on Water. S.I.C., his first EP, was released on May 17, 2011. In June 2011, he was featured on Winnipeg's Most's second single, \\"Forgive Me\\", from their second album, GoodFellaz. On May 15, 2012, Kaliko released his fourth studio album, titled Kickin' and Screamin'. It is currently his highest charting album on the Billboard 200. The album has features from long-time collaborator Tech N9ne, as well as rappers Twista, Chamillionaire, T-Pain, Twiztid and Rittz, while the production is almost entirely handled by Seven. In November, Kaliko released his second EP, Neh'mind. The song \\"Damage\\" featuring Snow Tha Product was made the lead single. A video for \\"Damage\\" was shot and released on YouTube on December 14, and received over 100,000 views in two weeks. On August 27, 2013, Kaliko released his fifth album, Son of Sam. It features guest appearances from Tech N9ne, CES Cru, Kortney Leveringston, IcyRoc Kravyn, and his wife Crystal Watson. The album debuted at number 56 on the Billboard 200 chart, with first- week sales of 8,000 copies in the United States. On April 8, 2016, Kaliko released his sixth studio album, GO. Unlike his previous albums, which were predominantly hip-hop, GO is his first R&B;/pop album. The album features labelmates Tech N9ne, Stevie Stone, Rittz, CES Cru, Wrekonize and JL B.Hood. It went on to chart as the number 4 Rap album on Billboard and number 28 in the Top 200.

Kroonland was the sister ship of and a near sister ship of and of the same company. Kroonland sailed for IMM's Red Star Line for 15 years, and also sailed for IMM's American Line and Panama Pacific Line. During World War I, the ship served as United States Army transport USAT Kroonland through April 1918, and as the Navy auxiliary USS Kroonland (ID-1541) from April 1918 to October 1919. Announced by the Red Star Line in 1899, Kroonland was completed in 1902 by William Cramp & Sons of Philadelphia. When launched, she was the largest U.S. steamship ever built. Kroonland sailed from New York City to Antwerp on her maiden voyage in June 1902, beginning service on the route she would sail for the next twelve years. According to The New York Times, Kroonland became the first ship to issue a wireless distress call at sea when she radioed for help during a storm in 1903. In another radio first, Kroonland heard the \\"first real broadcast of history\\" in December 1906.Bliss, p. 3. Kroonland was one of ten ships that came to the aid of the burning liner in the mid-Atlantic in October 1913. Despite stormy seas, Kroonland was able to take aboard 89 survivors, for which captain and crew received accolades that included U.S. Congressional Gold Medals. When the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 disrupted service to Belgium, Kroonland shifted to alternate routes. On a trip to the Mediterranean in October 1914, Kroonland was detained by British authorities at Gibraltar, and part of her cargo was confiscated amidst diplomatic wrangling between the then-neutral United States and the United Kingdom. During a chartered circumnavigation of South America in February 1915, Kroonland became the largest passenger ship to date to transit the Panama Canal. Kroonland was placed in New York ‚Äì Panama Canal ‚Äì San Francisco service until a landslide temporarily closed the canal to navigation. Returned to transatlantic service, Kroonland was one of the first U.S. ships armed by the Navy for defense against German submarine attacks. In May 1917 Kroonland was struck by a torpedo, which failed to detonate and only slightly damaged the ship. After the United States entered World War I, Kroonland served as a troopship for the U.S. Army and Navy. She made six trips carrying troops to France before the Armistice and eight voyages after, transporting nearly 38,000 troops in total. Returned to IMM in late 1919, Kroonland was scorched in a shipyard fire in January 1920 while she was being refitted for passenger service. The liner resumed North Atlantic service in April, remaining there until returning to New York ‚Äì San Francisco service in 1923. Kroonland inaugurated IMM's winter New York ‚Äì Miami service from December 1925 to March 1926, but was laid up in Hoboken, New Jersey, when IMM did not resume the Miami service the following year. The ship was sold and scrapped at Genoa in 1927.  Design and construction  In July 1899, the Red Star Line announced plans for the construction of four large ocean liners. Two ships, Kroonland and , were to be built at William Cramp & Sons in Philadelphia, and the others, and , at John Brown & Company of Clydebank in Scotland.Bonsor, p. 840. By April 1901, the two Scottish-built ships were completed and in service for Red Star, with the construction of the American pair well underway. Kroonland and the virtually identical Finland, at each,Bonsor, p. 856. were slightly larger than Vaderland and Zeeland.Bonsor, p. 855. The American pair were the largest steamships built in the United States at the time of their launch, and were the highest tonnage civilian ships ever built by William Cramp. U.S. Navy ships listed are by displacement. Kroonland was long (pp) and abeam, with a molded depth of . Her hull was steel and nearly all the rivets were set with pneumatic rivet guns.Pollack, p. 109. Kroonland was propelled at up to by twin triple-expansion steam engines. The engines were each rated at and had cylinders of , , and with a stroke. There were nine single-ended coal-fired Scotch boilers with a heating area of , a grate area of , and an operating pressure of . Kroonland had eleven watertight compartments with reinforced bulkheads, and was designed to remain afloat with up to two compartments flooded. Kroonlands coal bunkers surrounded the boilers, to offer limited protection in case the ship was used in wartime.William Cramp, p. 133. The first-class passengers smoking room on SS Kroonland, c. 1909 The area below the main deck could carry up to of freight and stores. Kroonlands water tanks could carry of fresh water. Refrigerated storage was provided for meats and other perishables.William Cramp, p. 134. Third-class passenger accommodations were located on the main deck: three compartments for men located forward, and a single compartment for families at the rear. The family compartment had state rooms containing either two, four, or six bunks. All compartments had well-lighted dining areas and wide hallways that led to lavatories and sanitary facilities on the upper deck. The upper deck housed facilities for officers and first- and second-class passengers. A long forecastle contained the accommodations for the crew and petty officers, as well as a hospital and the third-class lavatories.William Cramp, p. 135. First-class staterooms for 106 passengers were located close to the middle of the ship. To their rear, between the funnels, was the first-class passenger dining room, spanning the width of the ship. With seating for 208, it featured mahogany furniture and satinwood paneling with inlays, and a glass skylight ceiling that extended up through two decks. Beyond this area were the galleys, sculleries, and pantries that served all passenger classes. Moving further aft, the second-class passenger dining room, which could accommodate 120 diners, was next. It, too, spanned the width of the ship and featured mahogany furniture, but was paneled with tapestry upon a cream-colored ground. Beyond the dining area were cabins for 76 second-class passengers. A bridge deck amidships contained state rooms for another 204 first-class and 120 second-class passengers. In the rear was a deck house that contained a social room for third-class passengers. A promenade deck was located above and was permanently enclosed by a boat deck, where Kroonlands 20 steel lifeboats were stowed.William Cramp, p. 136. The promenade deck housed the library and smoking room for first-class passengers. Kroonland was launched on the afternoon of 20 February 1902 in a small, informal ceremony. Mrs. Rodman Griscom christened the ship, but Kroonland did not budge on the launching way; cold weather had frozen the tallow used to grease the timbers. Hydraulic jacks eventually freed the ship for her plunge into the Delaware River.  Red Star Line service, 1902‚Äì1914  Kroonland sailed on her maiden voyage from New York to Antwerp on 28 June 1902. Kroonland remained on New York ‚Äì Antwerp service for the next twelve years. In these early years of service, she was involved in two radio firsts. After the steering gear failed west of Fastnet Rock during a moderate gale in early December 1903, the ship's crew was able to communicate their predicament via Marconi wireless system,Williams, p. 227. becoming, according to one contemporary news account, the first ship in distress ever to use wireless. Kroonland put in at Queenstown, Ireland, for repairs, and transferred her passengers and freight to ships of the White Star Line, another IMM subsidiary.Kroonlands first- and second-class passengers were transferred to RMS Teutonic and third-class passengers were transferred to another, unreported steamer. See: Cargo was transferred onto . Freight customers ended up paying twice for the shipments because Red Star and White Star, even though both subsidiaries of International Mercantile Marine, were separate companies. See: The other radio first came on 24 December 1906, when the ship's wireless operator heard‚Äîrather than the expected dots and dashes of morse code‚Äîthe voice of a woman singing. The singing was followed by a recording of Handel's \\"Largo\\", a poetry reading, and more music played from phonographs. The steamer was on the receiving end of what journalist and author Robert St. John called the \\"first real broadcast of history\\", originated by early radio pioneer Reginald Fessenden from Brant Rock in Massachusetts. During her time on the New York ‚Äì Antwerp route, Kroonland was frequently battered by the storms that were typical in the North Atlantic. In November 1904, a Brussels news agency reported a rumor that the ship had foundered in a mid-ocean storm. The report‚Äîproved false when Kroonland safely docked in New York)‚Äîreceived wide coverage in the American press. Also, While in a heavy December gale, the ship was struck by what contemporary news accounts referred to as a \\"tidal wave\\" as high as the tops of her funnels. The wave crashed over the deck, and brought the ship to a standstill. A Belgian passenger's leg was broken when he was thrown into a wall, and a crewman on watch in the crow's nest was sent tumbling to the deck below with only minor injuries. In another December gale in 1907, one of the two propeller shafts on Kroonland broke while the liner was off the Isles of Scilly. Using the lone remaining propeller, the liner was able to make her way back to Southampton, where two tugs brought her into port. Passengers were transferred to to continue their transit to New York, while Kroonland entered drydock at Southampton. Fitted with a new shaft, she sailed‚Äîwithout passengers and cargo‚Äîfor New York, where she arrived on 2 January 1908. In February 1910, severe winter storms on the North Atlantic extended one of Kroonlands westbound trips, delaying her arrival in New York by three days. In May, Kroonland broke another propeller shaft, and again headed to Southampton for repairs. Not all of the ship's mishaps were storm- related. In late April 1911, Kroonland hit the breakwater in Dover Harbour, disabling the steering gear and delaying the ship by a day. On 8 January 1913, Kroonland ran aground in Ambrose Channel during a heavy fog while outbound from New York. It took more than six hours for tugs to free the liner from the soft mud. The Red Star Line changed Kroonland from American to Belgian registry on 6 November 1908 in Antwerp. One reason given for the change was to allow Red Star to hire non-American crews at lower cost. She made her maiden voyage under the Belgian flag the next day. In May 1911, Kroonlands crew, acting on rumors of an impending British mariner's strike, refused to sign on for the ship's next voyage, forcing Red Star to hire a replacement crew.Typically, crew members had no contracts and had to \\"sign on\\" after each voyage. See: Coons and Varias, p. 125. International Mercantile Marine submitted a bid for a ten-year contract for Kroonland and Finland to carry U.S. mail between New York and San Francisco after the opening of the Panama Canal. By law, only U.S.-flagged ships could carry U.S. mail under contract. It was also anticipated that U.S.-flagged vessels would receive preferential treatment for canal tolls.Vose, p. 425 In a short ceremony aboard the liner in New York Harbor on 27 December 1911,Vose, p. 418. the Belgian flag was lowered and the American flag was raised to the playing of \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\" by the steamer's band, shortly before she sailed for Antwerp. Finlands registry was changed on 3 January 1912. = Volturno rescue = At about 06:00 on 9 October 1913, , a Royal Line ship under charter to the Uranium Line, caught fire in a gale on the North Atlantic. The crew fought the fire for about two hours, but, realizing the severity of the fire and the limited options for dousing it in the high seas, Captain Francis Inch of Volturno had his wireless operator send out SOS signals. The westbound Kroonland, already beyond Volturnos location, turned east to aid the burning liner. In the meantime, several of Volturnos lifeboats with women and children aboard were launched with tragic results: all those aboard the lifeboats were killed as the boats capsized or were smashed by the hull of the heaving ship. In all, ten ships heeded the distress calls, arriving throughout the day and into the next. Kroonland arrived at about 17:00, and by 20:00 had launched a lifeboat with a volunteer crew. The boat was unable to get close to the burning liner. Kroonlands lifeboat returned at 22:30 with an exhausted crew and the one person who had dared to brave the jump into the stormy water. Captain J. C. Barr of , the first ship to arrive, took command of the rescue effort. Barr had the vessels form a \\"battle line\\" of sorts and slowly circle the burning ship, while his ship kept a searchlight on Volturno and another sweeping the ring of rescue ships to help them avoid collisions. Despite Carmanias efforts, Kroonland and the French Line steamer almost collided, coming‚Äîaccording to one passenger‚Äîwithin of impact. For his part in helping rescue victims of the fire, Kroonlands captain, Paul H. Kreibohm, was made a Chevalier of the Order of the Crown, and received a gold watch, a Congressional Gold Medal, and a Silver Sea Gallantry Medal. Kroonlands lifeboat, manned by a fresh crew, headed back out and returned with 13 steerage passengers. On board Volturno, the crew and some of the male passengers, unable to extinguish the fire, were at least able to keep it from spreading to the aft cargo holds, over which the others on board were gathered. Shortly before dawn, a large explosion‚Äîprobably of her boilers‚Äîrocked Volturno, and the rescuers felt that the ship, which had not been in imminent danger of sinking up to this point, might founder at any time. The tanker Narragansett turned on her pumps and sprayed lubricating oil on the sea to help calm the surface. The combined effect of the oil and the lessening of the storm allowed many more lifeboats to be sent to Volturnos aid. Kroonland launched two more boats herself and saved 75 more, including Captain Inch, the last person to leave the stricken ship. In all, some 520 passengers and crew were rescued by the ten ships‚Äî89 on Kroonland alone. The loss of life was limited to around 130, mostly women and children from the early lifeboat launchings. With all boats recovered by 09:00, the liners resumed their original courses. Kroonland turned west and continued on to the United States, hampered by a cracked crankshaft that slowed her to . During her slow passage to New York, Kroonlands cabin passengers drafted a resolution honoring Captain Kreibohm and the crew for their actions during the rescue, and raised $700 for the benefit of the Volturno survivors. Kroonland finally docked in New York on 16 October. The crew, like those of the other nine ships involved, received many accolades for its rescue efforts. After sending the ship a congratulatory telegram at the time of the rescue, King Albert of Belgium made Capt. Kreibohm a Chevalier (Knight) of the Order of the Crown in January 1914. At the same time, the Belgian government awarded its Third Class Civic Cross to Kroonlands third officer, and First Class Civic Medals to six crewmen and a steward. In March, King George V of the United Kingdom, on recommendation of the Board of Trade, awarded 39 of the ship's crew the Silver Sea Gallantry Medal, along with a ¬£3 award. Crewmen from all ten ships received Sea Gallantry Medals, but no other ship had more medals awarded than Kroonland. (Convenience copy located here.) Later in March, the United States Congress honored Kreibohm with a gold watch, Kroonlands officers‚Äîincluding Kreibohm‚Äîwith Congressional Gold Medals,Stathis, p. 17.It is not entirely clear from contemporary sources whether Kreibohm actually received both a watch and a gold medal. Stathis (p. 17) indicates Kreibohm did, in fact, receive a gold medal. and other crewmen with five silver and 25 bronze medals. In April, the Life Saving Benevolent Association of New York awarded its Life Saving Medal to Kreibohm, four officers, and 35 crewmen. In June 1916, Kreibohm was presented with the American Cross of Honor by Congressman Henry Bruckner. Kroonland resumed her normal New York ‚Äì Antwerp service until 11 August 1914, when she arrived at New York with passengers that had narrowly escaped the hostilities beginning to engulf the European continent. = Notable passengers = During her pre-war New York ‚Äì Antwerp sailings, Kroonland carried some notable and interesting passengers. On 1 August 1904, one of the ship's passengers arrived in New York as somewhat of a mystery woman. She recounted that she had gone out for dinner in Antwerp and awakened to find herself at sea with only the white silk evening gown she was wearing. Having no money or luggage, she was barred from entering the United States and was compelled to remain on board the ship. After her predicament was reported in The New York Times, she received letters and telegrams that included marriage proposals. Her background story and a letter of credit eventually verified her identity, but she was deported after a New York doctor pronounced her insane. Later the same month The New York Times reported on first-class passengers' complaints over privileges for their dogs and the conditions in the kennel aboard the liner. One passenger was determined to have her dog in her state room, and after others joined her in removing canine companions from the kennel, Kroonlands crew took all the dogs back to the kennel. Many of the dog owners refused to speak to the others involved for the duration of the voyage. On 27 May 1905, American author Molly Elliot Seawell sailed for Europe on Kroonland on a day when six liners, with over 1,500 passengers, departed New York. In October, Helen Taft returned from Europe on Kroonland and was met by her husband, Secretary of War William Howard Taft. The next August, Henry Yates Satterlee, the first Episcopal Bishop of Washington, returned on Kroonland from a six-week tour of cathedrals of Europe, during which he noted both good and bad design elements of cathedrals in preparation for the building of the Washington National Cathedral. Also returning on the same voyage were Admiral Charles Sperry and Lieutenant Daniel W. Wurtsbaugh of the U.S. Navy, and Brigadier General Robert O'Reilly, the Surgeon General of the U.S. Army; all were American delegates to the Second Geneva Convention. It was not the first trip on Kroonland for either Satterlee and O'Reilly. Satterlee had traveled on the liner the previous May to visit the spa town of Bad Nauheim in Hesse;Brent, p. 290. O'Reilly had been on the November 1904 trip in which Kroonland had been reported as sunk. Kroonland was the scene of an attempted murder-suicide in October 1908. Two acquaintances in steerage had an argument over a young female second-class passenger that both men knew. One man threw a knife at the other‚Äîonly slightly wounding him‚Äîand then fled and jumped over the railing into the English Channel near Dover. U.S. Senator Benjamin Tillman and his wife were aboard the liner at the time and saw the young man jump overboard. Although the ship lowered a boat to look for him, no trace of him was found, and he was presumed drowned. American actresses Kitty Cheatham and Isabel Irving‚Äîeach married to a different man named \\"W. H. Thompson\\"‚Äîtraveled on Kroonland in May 1910. Alerted to each other's presence when mail addressed to \\"Mrs. W. H. Thompson\\" was confused, the actresses‚Äîold friends, having both worked in the theatre company of Augustin Daly‚Äîshared a state room for the voyage. Later that month, the ship was the official \\"World Missionary Conference Steamship\\" for delegates and representatives on their way to the World Missionary Conference in Edinburgh, Scotland.Grant, p. 375 Honda Yoitsu, said to be the only Japanese Methodist Episcopal bishop, was among those on the liner when she sailed on 31 May. News accounts reported on some of the unusual activities aboard Kroonland during this trip. Among them were morning devotional services held daily in the ship's dining room, and the spontaneous singing of hymns on deck every evening. Kroonland was tangentially involved in a more sinister affair in July 1910. American physician Hawley Crippen and his lover, Ethel La Neve, had fled England after the circumstances around his wife's death were questioned. After a body was found in the basement of Crippen's North London residence, Scotland Yard Chief Inspector Walter Dew sought the couple for murder charges. One theory had the couple sailing from Dover on Kroonland, but when inspected in New York on arrival, Crippen and Le Neve were not to be found. The fleeing couple had instead sailed from Antwerp on the Canadian Pacific liner . Crippen, identified during Montroses crossing, was arrested, convicted of his wife's murder, and hanged; La Neve was acquitted. The American novelist Theodore Dreiser, returning from an extended European tour in April 1912, briefly considered returning on , but instead sailed two days later on the American-flagged‚Äîand less expensive‚ÄîKroonland. Dreiser recounted the gloomy mood of Kroonlands passengers after hearing the news of Titanics sinking, observing that the \\"terror of the sea had come swiftly and directly home to all\\".Loving, pp. 214‚Äì15. On Kroonlands next return trip to New York, Horst von der Goltz, a self-described German secret agent, eluded German authorities by working as a steward in steerage aboard the liner.von der Goltz, p. 112.  American Line service, 1914‚Äì1915  With the German invasion of Belgium in early August 1914, Kroonland was switched to New York ‚Äì Liverpool service. After two circuits on that route, IMM announced that the ship would be moved to service in the Mediterranean to attract business to offset that lost because of the war. Sailing from New York on 15 October for Gibraltar, Naples, and Piraeus, Kroonland became what IMM called the first large, American-flagged steamer \\"to engage in trade with the far corners of the Mediterranean\\". Along with passengers, the ship carried a cargo of rubber and of copper destined for Italy.McMaster, p. 53. SS Kroonland sails in the Culebra Cut of the Panama Canal on 2 February 1915. Kroonland was the largest passenger ship to transit the canal to that date. On 28 October, British authorities detained the ship at Gibraltar. Because neutral Italy did not restrict the shipment of copper (which could be used in war munitions) to Germany or Austria-Hungary, the British claimed the right to detain the ship‚Äîa claim disputed by the U.S. State Department. Kroonland was allowed to resume her journey on 8 November after the copper and rubber were unloaded and taken to a prize court. The ship arrived at Naples on 11 November,Fess, p. 260. then completed the rest of her Mediterranean trek. Returning to New York, she carried the new minister from Bulgaria to the United States, arriving on 4 December.U.S. Dept. of State, pp. 32‚Äì33. IMM had advertised that Kroonland would sail the Mediterranean route again in December, but the liner was removed from the route. In late January 1915, Kroonland departed on a business tour of South America under charter to the American Trade Tour Company. The tour was designed as a showcase for American companies hoping to expand into South America, and Kroonland circumnavigated that continent, traveling over in 82 days. During the voyage, the liner docked at various ports where businessmen or trade representatives, like the Babson Statistical Organization, made sales pitches and showed films of factories to potential customers aboard Kroonland. During this South American foray, the ship sailed westbound through the Panama Canal on 2 February, becoming the largest passenger ship to transit the canal to that date.Direction of travel: Date, largest to-date: The smaller of the Northern Pacific Line transited the canal on the same date. Also on the trip, while transiting the Straits of Magellan in late February, Kroonland passed British cruiser refueling from a collier, and, on 26 February, when entering the harbor of Punta Arenas, Chile, passed the departing , on the hunt for the German cruiser .Jones and Hollister, p. 41. Kroonland returned to New York on 14 April.  Panama Pacific Line service, 1915  In May 1915, Kroonland and sister ship Finland were chartered to the Panama Pacific Line for the long- planned service between New York and San Francisco via the Panama Canal. Kroonland departed from New York for California on 22 May and counted 50 honeymooning couples and a large cargo of flour from St. Paul, Minnesota, among her payload. The intercoastal trip took about 17 days each way and the ships called at either Los Angeles or San Diego on eastbound and westbound trips. Convenience copy of relevant page can be found here . Retrieved 13 May 2008. With two ships on the route, one ship departed from either New York or San Francisco about every three weeks. The service was marketed as the ideal manner to visit the Panama-California Exposition in San Diego and the Panama- Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco. At the San Francisco exhibition, a detailed model of Kroonland was one of ten that comprised a part of IMM's exhibit in the Palace of Transportation.Todd, pp. 243‚Äì45. Frequent and progressively worse landslides in the canal disrupted Kroonlands and Finlands service. In August 1915, Kroonlands arrival in New York was delayed a day by a Gaillard Cut slide. In early September, both ships were delayed ten days while waiting for the canal to be dredged after another slide.Length of delay: Both ships affected: In early October, another landslide in the Gaillard Cut‚Äîthis one in excess of of mud and dirt‚Äîclosed the canal, and it was expected that it might remain closed for as long as ten months. Kroonland was en route to the canal from San Francisco, while Finland was at the canal's eastern terminus, Col√≥n. After Kroonland arrived at the canal's western end at Balboa, the two liners exchanged passengers‚Äîincluding former First Lady Helen TaftHelen Herron Taft had sailed on Kroonland ten years before, in October 1905 and her daughter, Helen‚Äîby rail across the isthmus.  American Line service, 1915‚Äì1917  During Kroonlands time on New York ‚Äì Liverpool service, she would have been greeted by The Three Graces of Liverpool's Pier Head. The delay caused by the October slide in the Panama Canal created uncertainty for the immediate future of Kroonland. Her sister ship Finland was transferred to a New York ‚Äì London route almost immediately after the canal's closure, but Kroonland was \\"trapped\\" on the west side of the continent. By early November, Kroonland‚Äîloaded with cargo destined for the United Kingdom, and sailing under the banner of the American Line‚Äîdeparted San Francisco for London, via the Straits of Magellan. On 21 December, the liner arrived at Rio de Janeiro after having run aground, but was found to be undamaged. Continuing on to London, Kroonland departed for New York on 30 January 1916. Although plans were announced in mid 1916 for the two sister ships to return to the Panama Pacific Line, and to add the Hawaiian port of Honolulu to the canal route, both ships remained in North Atlantic service. On 20 February, Kroonland, continuing to sail for the American Line, returned to New York ‚Äì Liverpool service after an absence of 18 months. As a ship of the still-neutral United States sailing in a war zone, Kroonland had her name painted in large letters on each side of her hull. The name was flanked on either side by large American flags and kept illuminated at night. In June, she carried US$1,500,000 of Argentine gold from London for deposit with the Guaranty Trust Company of New York. On late 1916, a cook aboard Kroonland was arrested for smuggling feathers, wings, and heads of birds of paradise and crowned pigeons. The man, who was paid $300 for each load of feathers, smuggled in at least three loads of the avian contraband before his arrest. In January 1917, a jumble sale held in the saloon on Kroonland raised ¬£73 15s 11d for The Times Fund, for the benefit of the British Red Cross and the Order of St. John. Five American Line steamers are seen laid up in New York in February 1917 after Germany resumed unrestricted submarine warfare. While returning from Liverpool in early February 1917, passengers and crew on Kroonland witnessed the German U-boat sink the Dutch ship Gamma off the Irish coast. According to the source, there was only one Dutch ship sunk on 1 February 1917, Gamma, which was sunk off the coast of Ireland. On 1 February 1917, at around 15:30, passengers and crew saw the German submarine overtake and stop the Dutch freighter. At about 16:15, the U-boat, by then on the far side of the Dutch ship and out of view from Kroonland, fired three shots from her deck gun. Gamma immediately began listing to port and sank within five minutes. Kroonland was less than away, and was prepared to rescue the crew of the sunken ship, but stopped when the German submarine took Gammas lifeboat in tow. Four days later, a suspected submarine was seen off Kroonlands port side, and there were other reports of a ship that passengers took to be a German commerce raider or submarine tender. Because Germany had resumed unrestricted submarine warfare again on 1 February, Kroonland was laid up for almost two months at the American Line piers in New York, along with sister ship Finland and three other vessels. During this forced downtime, Kroonland was converted from coal burning to oil burning, a long-awaited modification that had been announced in October 1915. The conversion reduced the number of stokers needed from 75 to 12, lowering Kroonlands payroll. Because fuel oil was stored inside the double bottom of her hull, her cargo capacity was increased through the elimination of her coal bunkers. The labor savings and the additional freight revenues from the increased cargo space resulted in a net gain of $25,000 income per trip.Burling, p. 445.  Troopship duties  Kroonland served as a troopship for about the next year.Sources are unclear under what purview Kroonland sailed. Bonsor (p. 856) simply lists \\"1917 US troopship\\". Kroonland is recorded as being a United States Army transport ship from mid-February 1918 by the Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships (See entry here ). In early March, U.S. Navy ordnance officers inspected Kroonland and took measurements in preparation to arm her for defense against submarine attacks. On 13 March, she was assigned guns by the Navy, becoming one of the first seven ships to be armed.Bureau of Ordnance, p. 40. The other six were steamers , , , , , and . With her arming complete, and carrying an armed naval guard to man the guns, Kroonland sailed for Liverpool on 25 March 1917. Twelve days later, the United States formally declared war on Germany. A gun on Kroonland, one of the first seven defensively armed American merchant ships On the morning of 20 May, while the liner steamed toward Liverpool through a heavy fog, a torpedo struck her without exploding. Two minutes later her lookouts spotted a submarine bearing down on Kroonland so close alongside the liner that her guns could not be depressed enough to open fire on the raider. Although the U-boat, apparently also taken by surprise, reversed her screws and tried to turn to avoid a collision, she lightly struck the liner's hull and scraped along her side before diving out of sight. Meanwhile, two more torpedoes came within some of hitting Kroonlands stern. That afternoon the liner sighted another submarine, surfaced some off her port quarter. Kroonland immediately began shelling the U-boat, forcing the submarine to dive for safety. In early June, this failed torpedo attack on the ship made front-page news in American newspapers. In September, elements of the U.S. 42nd Infantry Division sailed from New York to Halifax on Kroonland.Thompson and Ferrell, pp. 5‚Äì8. The ship sailed from Halifax on 30 September in an Allied convoy with the American ship and Commonwealth ships (which had led the Volturno rescue in 1913), Anchises, Canada, Grampian, Ionican,This may actually be Ionian, a steamer with the Allan Line that was engaged in troop transport around this time. See Bonsor, vol. 1, p. 322. Themistocles, Victoria, , Medic, Miltiades, Mokoia, and Ruahine.Several of these ships were carrying Australian and New Zealand troops, and had been the first transports loaded with troops to use the Panama Canal. See Two days out from Halifax, the last five ships split off from the convoy and headed to Scotland; Kroonlands group sailed to Liverpool. On 15 October 1917, the United States Shipping Board (USSB) requisitioned all American passenger ships over for use by the government in the war effort. Though it is not clear what immediate impact this had on Kroonland,Crowell and Wilson, p. 319. it is known that the liner was operating as a U.S. Army transport (under the name USAT Kroonland) by February 1918, when she was loaded with materiel and departed New York for Saint-Nazaire, France. In February 1918 the USSB assigned Kroonland to the transport fleet as a U.S. Army Chartered Transport (USACT),Crowell and Wilson, pp. 320, 647. and after her return from France on 9 April, she was converted to a troop transport in New York by the William J. Kennedy Company. A typical conversion from passenger liner to troop transport involved having all of the second- and third-class accommodations ripped out and replaced with berths for troops. Cooking and toilet facilities also had to be greatly expanded to handle the large numbers of men aboard.Crowell and Wilson, p. 316.  U.S. Navy transport duties  After problems with crew discipline aboard Army transports and when they were torpedoed, the U.S. Navy, led by the recommendations of Rear Admiral Albert Gleaves, insisted that all troop transports be manned entirely by Navy personnel. This was accomplished soon after, to avoid the need for what Gleaves called \\"ignorant and unreliable men\\" who were \\"the sweepings of the docks\\".Gleaves, pp. 108‚Äì10. Accordingly, Kroonland was handed over to the Navy on 22 April and commissioned the same day, with Commander Manley H. Simons in command. = Transporting troops to France = USS Kroonland was assigned to the Cruiser and Transport Force after being commissioned.Gleaves, p. 240. The ship departed New York on 30 April with the transports , , and Finland. and ‚Äîtwo transports that sailed from Newport News, Virginia‚Äîrendezvoused with Kroonlands group. provided the convoy with protection until its arrival in France on 12 May. Kroonland returned to New York on 1 June.Crowell and Wilson, p. 608. Kroonland next left New York on 15 June with Finland, , , , , the Italian steamer , and the British steamer Vauban and met up with the Newport News portion of the convoy‚Äîconsisting of , , , , and the British troopship (another fellow Volturno rescuer)‚Äîthe next morning and set out for France. The convoy was escorted by the cruisers and , and the destroyers and ; the battleship and several other destroyers joined in escort duties for the group for a time. The convoy had a false alarm when a floating barrel was mistaken for submarine, but the otherwise uneventful trip concluded at Brest on the afternoon of 27 June.List of ships, date of arrival in Brest: Crowell and Wilson, pp. 610‚Äì11. Battleship Texas and other convoy details: Cutchins and Stewart, pp. 67‚Äì68. Kroonland pitches in heavy seas during a transatlantic crossing while in Navy service. On 10 July,Gleaves, on p. 170, reports the date as 20 July. as Kroonland steamed homeward from France, a lookout spotted a periscope rising from the water about away. Kroonland opened fire and the fourth shot from her No. 4 gun \\"burst with a tremendous cloud of dirty blue smoke\\" exactly on the periscope. The submarine zig-zagged \\"erratically back and forth until she was directly in the disturbed water\\" of Kroonlands wake. The transport continued firing until the submarine disappeared, leaving an oil slick which could be seen for at least 15 minutes.On her return journey, Covingtons encounter with a submarine had a decidedly different outcome. She was torpedoed by U-86 on 1 July and sank the next afternoon. See: Kroonland arrived safely in New York on 13 July.Crowell and Wilson, pp. 610‚Äì11. On 26 July, Kroonland, loaded with 3,248 officers and men,Crowell and Wilson, p. 555. departed on her next trip to France. In the company of Finland and the Italian steamer , she met up with , , and the Italian steamers and from Newport News.Crowell and Wilson, p. 614. The cruisers , , and destroyers and escorted the transports.Crowell and Wilson list the destroyer as \\"Calhoun\\". The only ever was a former Confederate steamer captured during the American Civil War. Gordon Van Kleeck, a private in Company F of the U.S. 51st Pioneer Infantry, one of the units aboard Kroonland on this trip, recorded his day-to- day activities in a journal. He stated that the soldiers wore overalls rather than uniforms, and were required to wear life jackets at all times. During the early mornings, the most dangerous time for submarines according to Van Kleeck, the soldiers had to stand by their life rafts until the sun was completely up. Bathing facilities were too small, so several times during the trip the soldiers gathered on deck for salt water baths, which consisted of a hose turned on them by the ship's crew. On 2 August, Finland developed engine trouble and fell back from the convoy, but by the next day, she and a destroyer that stayed with her had rejoined the convoy. The convoy arrived in Brest on 7 August, and Kroonland arrived back in the United States on 19 August. After embarking 3,334 soldiers, Kroonland began her next crossing on 30 August when she sailed from New York with Susquehanna, and to join the Newport News contingent of Duca d'Aosta, Caserta, and . Kroonlands convoy was escorted by Frederick and Colhoun.Crowell and Wilson, pp. 557, 616. As with other Navy ships throughout 1918,NHC, Personal account by Rear Admiral William B. Caperton; Gleaves, p. 190. Kroonland was not immune to the worldwide Spanish flu pandemic. On this particular crossing, two of her crewmen were felled by the disease as her convoy reached France on 12 September.Bureau of Naval Personnel, Officers and Enlisted Men‚Ä¶, pp. 242, 328. The source did not provide information on whether there were any deaths among Army personnel aboard. Kroonland returned to New York on 27 September. Troops board Kroonland at Saint-Nazaire, France, on 11 March 1919 to return to the United States. At 20:00 on 7 October, Kroonland departed New York on her fifth Navy voyage with 2,567 men. She joined Caserta and the British steamer Euripides in rendezvousing with , Susquehanna, America, and Czar from Newport News.Crowell and Wilson, p. 618Crowell and Wilson, p. 561 The cruisers and and the destroyers and Fairfax served as convoy escorts for the group, which arrived in France on 20 October. Kroonland arrived in New York on 3 November, and was in port when the Armistice was signed on 11 November. In total, Kroonland carried 14,125 troops to France during the five trips of her Navy career.Gleaves, pp. 246‚Äì47. = Returning troops home = At war's end, the task of bringing home American soldiers began almost immediately.Gleaves, p. 31. Kroonland did her part by carrying home 26,152 passengers in eight trips. The ship departed from Brest in late November with her first load of nearly 2,000 wounded and convalescing soldiers, many of whom were from the U.S. 76th Infantry Division. The former liner arrived at the Quarantine Station on 10 December 1918, and docked in New York the next day. One of the men aboard was Captain Walter Camp who had been wounded and gassed in the Meuse-Argonne Offensive; Camp was the son of the Yale University football coach of the same name.Location of departure: All other details: Another passenger on board was Sarah Wilmer, an American YWCA front-line worker who had become lost in the Argonne forest and gassed when a German shell exploded nearby. Before departing on her next voyage, Kroonland hosted a party for 150 newsboys from New Jersey at her Hoboken, New Jersey, pier on Christmas Day. With a Christmas tree in the troops' mess, the newsboys were treated to a dinner and entertainment by the ship's band, and all received presents. Kroonland arrived at Newport News on 18 February with 2,805 passengers, including units from the U.S. 36th Infantry Division, after a rough trip from Saint-Nazaire.Nature of trip: White, pp. 210‚Äì11. Number of troops, destination: On her next voyage, she carried another 2,943 officers and men from Saint-Nazaire to Newport News, arriving there on 24 March. The 132nd Regiment of the 61st Field Artillery Brigade returned on the ship, and brigade historian Rex F. Harlow called Kroonland \\"probably the best vessel on which any units of the brigade returned to America\\".Harlow, p. 191. After her Navy service ended, Kroonlands guns were removed before she was returned to her owners, International Mercantile Marine. On 18 April, Kroonland began her next homeward journey, embarking several companies of the 111th Infantry Regiment of the U.S. 28th Infantry Division among the 3,100 troops carried. Though the fighting was over, the men still wore life jackets for the first three days at sea amidst fears of striking floating mines. George W. Cooper, historian of the 2nd Battalion of the 111th Infantry, reported that some of the men had to serve as stokers during the trip because of a \\"shortage of help\\". In the middle of the crossing, the ship \\"sprung a leak\\" and took on of water; she had a list for a day or so, until repairs were made. The troops later disembarked at New York on 29 April.Composition, number of troops: Other voyage details: Cooper, p. 176. Kroonland returned to Saint-Nazaire in May and loaded Major General Joseph E. Kuhn and some 3,000 men of his U.S. 79th Infantry Division, which included the 304th Engineer Regiment, and departed France on 18 May. The band of the 304th Engineers gave concerts on deck every evening on the voyage home to entertain the men. Though initially bound for Newport News, Kroonlands crew received orders in mid ocean to head instead to New York, where they arrived on 29 May.Number, identity of troops: Other trip details: U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Official History‚Ä¶, pp. 242, 247, 283. After completing another passage to Newport News in late June, Kroonland sailed on 19 July with 3,642 passengers‚Äîincluding officers, men, thirteen war brides, and one war baby‚Äîfrom Saint-Nazaire, in the final transport departure from that port before it was closed as a port of embarkation by U.S. military authorities. Among the passengers was Brigadier General Samuel D. Rockenbach, the founder of the United States Tank Corps. On 21 August, the USSB announced that Kroonland would be released from government service after surveys for repairs had been completed. After leaving New York on 10 August, the ship was in the middle of what would be her final trip returning soldiers. After arriving at Brest, 1,532 officers and men boarded Kroonland for New York, where the transport arrived on 10 September. Also on board was Michael Gilhooley, a 15-year-old stowaway making his fourth unsuccessful attempt to sneak into the United States aboard a Navy transport.Departure location, date: Composition of troops, return date, stowaway details: The ship was decommissioned and returned to the USSB on 13 September, and returned to International Mercantile Marine shortly thereafter. In her eight trips returning troops, Kroonland‚Äîaffectionately called the \\"Empress of the Seas\\" by her crewNixon (see subtitle of book).‚Äîaveraged just under 39 days per turnaround, beating the overall average of all ships by almost a full day, and edging out sister ship Finland by less than that.  Red Star Line service, 1920‚Äì1923  After her return to International Mercantile Marine (IMM), the ship underwent a refit at the W. & A. Fletcher Marine Works yard in Hoboken that outfitted her for 242 first-, 310 second-, and 876 third-class passengers. On 8 January 1920, while Kroonland was still under repair, the American Line ship , berthed next to her at the Fletcher yard, caught fire. In the multi-alarm fire, firefighters believed that St. Louis was a lost cause, and so focused their efforts on saving Kroonland. At one point, St. Louis heeled over and leaned on Kroonland but the only resulting damages were scorch marks on her side.St. Louis was never rebuilt and her hull was scrapped in Italy in 1925. (See ) Kroonland resumed her civilian career in April 1920, sailing once again for the Red Star Line on the New York ‚Äì Antwerp route. She sailed from Pier 61 on the North River opposite sister ships Finland and Zeeland and the newer until early 1923.Pier location: Brooklyn Daily Eagle, p. 94. Ships on the route, duration: Immigration Information Bureau, p. 206.The fourth sister ship, , had been sunk by off the Irish coast on 4 June 1917 (See Bonsor, vol. 2, p. 855). Rough weather on the North Atlantic took its toll on Kroonland while sailing this route. A storm off Sable Island in December 1920 was so intense that the liner was only able to travel during one 24-hour stretch and nearly exhausted her fuel supply. When the liner arrived in New York, tugs were required to tow her from the quarantine station to the pier. Heavy seas in another storm in October 1921 broke Kroonlands port propeller shaft past Sandy Hook. She returned to New York at and transferred most of the passengers to Lapland. Another eastbound crossing four months later was marked by almost continuous gales with winds up to ; the liner arrived at Plymouth covered in ice and snow. Kroonland was also involved in several non-weather-related events. On 12 November 1920, after departing Antwerp for New York, she collided with a Dutch tug in the Scheldt, killing two of the tug's crew. In March 1921, a Czechoslovakian woman gave birth to fraternal twins on board the liner shortly after she and her husband sailed from Antwerp. Because the twins were born on a U.S.-flagged vessel, they were automatically American citizens. On 10 June 1922, The New York Times reported that Charles Simmons, Kroonlands Chief Steward, was found dead in his bunk. Crewmen aboard the ship, which had been docked in New York since 4 June, said Simmons had been seen on deck in apparently good health the day before. The medical examiner nevertheless asked police to investigate, because it appeared to him that Simmons had been dead for three to four days.Date of arrival in New York: All other details: There were no further reports on the death or investigation in the newspaper. During an August eastbound crossing, Kroonland stood by for two hours after receiving a report of an explosion and fire on , some behind. The gas explosion in one of Adriatics forward cargo holds killed five crewmen and seriously wounded three others. It also spawned a fire that was quickly extinguished and left little damage. Offers of help from ten liners (including Kroonland) were politely declined and Adriatic arrived in New York three days later. In October, U.S. Federal judge Learned Hand issued a restraining order preventing the Prohibition-related seizure of alcohol aboard Kroonland, Finland, and St. Paul. IMM had sought the order to enable her to continue to carry Italian third-class passengers; Italian law required a minimum number of a ship's crew to be Italian, with Italian wine of at least 12% alcohol provided for them. Ambassador Myron T. Herrick was part of the U.S. delegation to the International Chamber of Commerce which sailed on Kroonland in 1920. Kroonland also carried some notable passengers during her time on this route including a majority of the U.S. delegates to the International Chamber of Commerce for its meeting in Paris in June 1920. Among those on board were Myron T. Herrick, former U.S. Ambassador to France; Paul M. Warburg, former member of the Federal Reserve Board; and 14 current and former directors of the United States Chamber of Commerce. Dr. Samuel Eyde, the newly appointed Norwegian Minister to the United States, sailed for his diplomatic post in December on Kroonland. On the same trip, Max Goldberg, a 14-year-old flower delivery boy, returned from an accidental roundtrip, begun in New York when the gangway was raised and the ship departed while he was making a last-minute delivery. Four of the United States' seven delegates to the 19th Inter-Parliamentary Union Convention in Stockholm‚ÄîCongressmen Alben W. Barkley and Edwin B. Brooks, and Senators Thomas J. Walsh and William B. McKinley‚Äîreturned on Kroonland in September 1921. Passengers were not the ship's only cargo during this time. The New York press reported on gold deposits carried to the United States on the liner several times on the Antwerp route. In a storm-tossed December 1920 voyage, for example, she carried $1,650,000 in gold, and the following June she carried ¬£100,000 gold to the Equitable Trust Company in New York. Another notable cargo arrived in New York in November 1922, when Kroonland brought of cheese from Switzerland. The shipment was said to be the first big shipment from that country since before World War I. A more unwelcome cargo was carried in March 1921, when a Hungarian immigrant in steerage was found to have typhoid fever. Discovery of the disease necessitated that all 731 steerage passengers be quarantined indefinitely. Kroonland began her last voyage on the Antwerp route in January 1923, after which she underwent a refit during the first half of 1923. The ship was converted to cabin- and third-class passengers only, and was painted white. In preparation for her announced return to the Panama Pacific Line in October 1923, more refrigeration and cool air space were added for transporting Southern California agricultural products. After this refit, the ship was briefly assigned to the American Line for three roundtrips on a New York to Hamburg route, with intermediate stops at Plymouth and Cherbourg. On her first Hamburg trip, she carried American comedic actress Florence Shirley and her husband, headed for a European vacation. Cecil Arden, a mezzo-soprano with the Metropolitan Opera, and botanist Otto Warburg sailed on the same trip.  Panama Pacific Line service, 1923‚Äì1925  In April 1923, IMM announced that Kroonland and sister ship Finland would be returned to the Panama Pacific Line beginning in late September, sailing from New York to San Francisco via Havana, the Panama Canal, and Los Angeles, with Los Angeles being the west coast hub of operations. In June, Manchuria was also assigned to the route. See: On 18 October, Kroonland departed on her first voyage on the route since 1915. Kroonland arrived in Los Angeles Harbor on 3 November amidst fanfare, becoming the largest liner to date to enter that harbor.On Kroonlands previous visits, she had to anchor offshore and use lighters to transfer passengers and cargo. See: Kroonland passes through the Pedro Miguel Locks of the Panama Canal on 23 October 1923. It was the liner's first voyage on the New York ‚Äì San Francisco route after an absence of eight years. In contrast to her time on the North Atlantic, Kroonland encountered few weather or mechanical delays on the coast-to-coast route. In December 1923, however, the ship was delayed one day by unusually heavy seas and gales off Baja California. Another delay in October 1924 proved to be fatal, according to the ship's physician. An arrival two days late, caused by adverse currents north of Panama, cost a female passenger her life. Had the ship not been delayed, the physician believed, prompt hospital care could have saved her. On this same trip, Kroonland passed through a \\"hurricane zone\\" but was not adversely affected by the storm.In all probability the \\"hurricane zone\\" referred to the Cuba hurricane (12‚Äì23 October) of the 1924 season that formed in the Caribbean Sea off the Yucatan Peninsula and moved across Cuba, Florida, and into the Atlantic. In December 1924, the Panama Pacific Line announced that it would add to the New York ‚Äì California route in February to replace Kroonland. Even though press accounts reported as late as March 1925 that Kroonland had sailed her last on the route, she continued carrying passengers and cargo through at least June 1925 because of booming business. Although plans had been announced to convert Kroonland and Finland to freighters upon the delivery of two new ships ordered for the route in late 1924, there is no evidence that this was ever carried out. = Notable passengers = Kroonland carried her share of notable passengers during her second stint for the Panama Pacific Line. On her first voyage, passengers included American Modernist poet Wallace Stevens and his wife, Elsie. After transiting the Panama Canal, the liner headed north along the western coast of Mexico. The ship passed the Gulf and Isthmus of Tehuantepec in early November, inspiring Stevens to later pen the poem \\"Sea Surface Full Of Clouds\\". First published in the July 1924 issue of literary magazine The Dial,Cook, p. 80. it was later included in the 1931 edition of Stevens' Harmonium.Stevens, p. xi. Each of the five stanzas begins with the line \\"In that November off Tehuantepec\\" and is a different portrayal of the surface of the sea. The poem has been called one of Stevens' \\"most persuasive statements of the imagination's powers\\",Litz, pp. 150‚Äì51. and considered \\"the most perfect example of a 'pure poem'\\".Richardson, p. 22. Other notable passengers included Brooklyn Dodgers shortstop Ray E. French, who sailed with his wife to their home in California on the same voyage as Stevens. California artist William Barr, American author Frederick O'Brien, and actress Mary Carr all sailed on Kroonland in December 1923. In February 1924, Daniel Willard, president of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, sailed from New York to Los Angeles. Acknowledging that the Panama Canal had \\"detract[ed] volumes of freight\\" from railroads, Willard said that there was no cause for alarm because the railroad business was booming. In January 1925, Gene Byrnes, creator of the comic strip Reg'lar Fellers, sailed from New York to Los Angeles with his wife. On the same voyage, University of Southern California president Rufus B. von KleinSmid boarded Kroonland at Panama after attending the Pan-American Scientific Congress in Lima. In mid-June the same year, short story author and screenwriter H. C. Witwer and his family returned to New York aboard the ship.  American Line service, 1925‚Äì1926  Kroonlands New York ‚Äì Miami service was not renewed following the 1926 Miami Hurricane which struck the city in September and caused widespread damage. In October 1925, the American Line announced plans for the liner to sail on a weekly New York ‚Äì Miami route. Kroonland, supplanted was a later name for Great Northern, the ship that transited the Panama Canal the same day as Kroonland back in February 1915. of the Admiral Line as the largest ship in Miami service, and sailed from Pier 62 in New York on Thursdays, arrived and departed Miami on Sundays, and returned to New York on Wednesdays. Though Kroonlands passenger capacity was potentially much larger, she was outfitted for 500 passengers in first class only. She sailed on her first voyage with 400 passengers, including American professional golfer Gene Sarazen, on 10 December. By the time the seasonal service to Miami ended in late March 1926, Kroonland had carried 11,000 passengers on the route. Though plans were announced for the liner to resume the route the following winter, this did not happen. IMM offered no reasons, but conditions in Miami at the end of 1926 were very different from the previous year. The wild South Florida real estate boom had collapsed in mid 1926, and the Great Miami Hurricane struck on 18 September, killing more than 325 and leaving as many as 50,000 residents homeless, while causing some $100 million damage (just over $2 billion in 2005 dollars). With no place to put the aging ship, IMM laid up Kroonland in Hoboken. The ship was later sold to shipbreakers in Italy and departed the United States for the last time on 29 January 1927. After delivering a cargo of grain to her old homeport of Antwerp, she was taken to Genoa and scrapped. According to an Associated Press report, Kroonland had completed 234 voyages totaling during the course of her career without serious accident.The Associated Press article did not state whether the career totals included wartime service.

Life He was the son of Abraham Laub and Anna Maria Schenborn. Laub, who converted from the Jewish to the Catholic faith and changed his name from \\"Jakub\\" into \\"Jakob Johann\\", first visited High School in Rzesz√≥w. Next stations were the University of Vienna, the University of Krak√≥w and finally the University of G√∂ttingen, where he studied mathematics under David Hilbert, Woldemar Voigt, Walther Nernst, Karl Schwarzschild and Hermann Minkowski. Afterwards he went to the University of W√ºrzburg, where he attained a doctorate in 1907. Soon he established closer contact to Wilhelm Wien, Arnold Sommerfeld, Johannes Stark, and Albert Einstein. When he travelled to Bern in 1908 to visit Einstein (with whom it corresponded later frequently and was friendly) he found him still working as a patent employee. This he called a \\"stair joke [Treppenwitz] of history\\". In 1909 he became co-worker of Philipp Lenard at the University of Heidelberg. In 1911 he emigrated with his wife Ruth Elisa Wendt to Argentina. There he worked at the geophysical and astronomical observatory in La Plata. Afterwards he obtained a leading position at a Physics Department in Buenos Aires. After accepting the Argentine nationality (with the Spanish first name variant \\"Jacobo Juan\\") he began to work in the Diplomatic service of Argentina. In 1947 he returned to Germany. In his new home town Freiburg he went into economic troubles and therefore sold a part of his correspondence with Einstein.R. O. Barrachina: Una perspectiva weberiana para la biograf√≠a de Jakob Laub, primer colaborador de Einstein Elke Flatau, Albert Einstein als wissenschaftlicher Autor Scientific Work In 1905 he investigated cathode rays together with Wilhelm Wien. Afterwards he investigated some topics on special relativity and wrote in 1907 an important work on the optics of moving bodies. In 1908 he wrote several works together with Einstein on the basic electromagnetic equations, which was aimed to replace the four-dimensional formulation of the electrodynamics by Minkowski by a simpler, classical formulation. Both Laub and Einstein discounted the spacetime formalism as too complicated. However, it turned out that Minkowski's spacetime formalism was fundamental for the further development of special relativity. Laub also published some papers on relativistic effects within gases and in 1910 he wrote one of the first survey articles on relativity. Also in the following years Laub still wrote many scientific papers on different topics.

The winter ranges are most common in open forests and floodplain marshes in the lower elevations. In the summer it migrates to the subalpine forests and alpine basins. Elk have a diverse habitat range that they can reside in but are most often found in forest and forest edge habitat and in mountain regions they often stay in higher elevations during warmer months and migrate down lower in the winter. They may even come down the mountain and leave the forest into some grassland for part of the day but head back into the timber in the evening. Climate change/warming can keep elk in their higher elevation habitats for longer into the winter than normal.Climate changes such as warming have in some cases even increased the seasonal range of elk in the winter. For example, in Yellowstone the climate warming has kept the snow at a lower level than in the past and has given the elk the ability to populate higher ranges than before. The lack of snow in Yellowstone has also given the elk an advantage over the wolves in their predator prey relationship because wolves rely on deep snow to hunt elk in winter ranges of Yellowstone. The total wild population is about one million individuals. The Rocky Mountain elk was reintroduced in 1913 to Colorado from Wyoming after the near extinction of the regional herds. While overhunting is a significant contributing factor, the elk‚Äôs near extinction is mainly attributed to human encroachment and destruction of their natural habitats and migratory corridors. A year later, twenty-one elk from Jackson Hole, Wyoming were reintroduced to South Dakota's Wind Cave National Park for population increase.https://southdakotamagazine.com/winter-elk. Conservation efforts also brought the elk populations in New Mexico from near zero numbers in the late 1800s and early 1900s, to healthy populations in the 1930s in Northern New Mexico. Population numbers of elk in Nebraska continued to increase through the 1970s and 1980s, to a level in which complaints from landowners in the Pine Ridge region led to the implementation of relatively liberal hunting seasons in the late 1980s. Elk numbers continued to increase through the 1990s to the present. All Rocky Mountain elk in Washington are the result of reintroductions conducted in the early 1900s from Yellowstone elk herds. These initial reintroductions have expanded their range and have also been translocated within the State. Not all of these elk have all the habitat to be successful in large numbers; supplemental feeding programs are used to compensate for lost winter range . In 1990, feasibility studies were conducted to determine if wild, free-ranging elk still had a place in some of their former eastern haunts. Once this was complete, healthy source herds of Rocky Mountain elk from Arizona, Kansas, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oregon, and Utah were used to introduce this elk subspecies to the former eastern elk range. In recent years, elk from Utah have been used to reestablish a population in Kentucky. Their populated Canadian ranges occur in Alberta's Jasper and Banff National Parks as well as British Columbia's Kootenay and Yoho National Parks. As of 2010, the Rocky Mountain elk herd has been diagnosed with a serious disorder called Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD). CWD affects the brain tissue of infected elk and is similar in symptoms to bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), commonly known as mad-cow disease (MCD). There is no evidence to conclude that elk CWD is transmittable to humans, and research concerning CWD and its effect on the eco-system continues. Environmental and CWD problems in Estes Park, Colorado and, on a greater scale, throughout the Western U.S. and North America have local, state, and federal policy makers searching for solutions.

The Manor of Honington was in the ownership of the Priory of Coventry until the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the 16th century. In 1540 it was granted by the Crown to Robert Gibbes. The estate was sold by the Gibbes family in about 1670 to Henry Parker who in 1696 succeeded to the Parker Baronetcy and an estate at Melford Hall, Suffolk. The present house was built by Parker in 1682 but was sold by Parker's grandson in 1737 to Joseph Townsend who carried out considerable alterations and extensions in the mid 18th century. The Georgian style house has a number of fine features including round headed niches over the ground floor windows of the east front which contain busts of Roman Emperors. The Townsends held the estate until 1905 when it passed by marriage to Sir Grey Skipwith Bt ( see Skipwith baronets). Later the estate became the seat of the Wiggin family.

Mariology is not at the centre of Catholic‚ÄìOrthodox ecumenical discussions. Catholics and Orthodox, while very close to one another in the faith, have difficulties in understanding each other culturally and mentally. In the East, there is a highly developed culture, but one with neither the Western separation between Church and State nor the modern Enlightenment in its background, and one perhaps marked most of all by the persecution of Christians under Communism.Walter Kasper 2005 Positive results dialogues have been reciprocal visits and regular correspondence between the Pope and the Patriarchs, frequent contacts at the local church level and ‚Äì importantly for the strongly monastic Oriental Churches ‚Äì at the level of the monasteries. Several meetings between Popes and Patriarchs took place since the Vatican Council. In their Common Declaration of Pope John Paul II and the Ecumenical Patriarch His Holiness Bartholomew I (July 1, 2004), they agree that in the search for full communion, it would have been unrealistic not to expect obstacles of various kinds. They identify doctrine, but mainly the conditioning by a troubled history. New problems emerged from the radical changes in the East. The dialogue was made more and not less difficult after the fall of communism. The Joint International Commission for Theological Dialogue between the Catholic Church and all the Orthodox Churches produced three between 1980 and 1990, which show a deep community in the understanding of faith, church and sacraments. Mariology and Marian issues were not even addressed in any of the joint documents, because mariological differences are seen as minor. The only seriously debated theological issue, besides the \\"Filioque\\"-clause in the Creed, which is still a motive of separation for most Orthodox, is the question of Roman primacy, the role of the pontiff.Kasper, 2005 As far as relations between the Church of Rome and the Church of Constantinople are concerned, Pope Benedict XVI and Patriarch Bartholomew agreed in 2007, that the memory of the ancient anathemas for centuries had a negative effect on relations between the Churches,COMMON DECLARATION BY HIS HOLINESS POPE BENEDICT XVI AND PATRIARCH BARTHOLOMEW I So far, no mariological commissions have been formed, according to one Orthodox specialist, because there are really no major differences in mariology itself.

The Common statement on Mary has an \\"Introduction\\" and two major sections: \\"Part One: Issues and Perspectives\\" and \\"Part Two: Biblical and Historical Foundations.\\" Mediatrix The key issue for the Lutheran participant was the role of Mary as Mediatrix in the Catholic Church. The Marian dogmas of the Immaculate Conception and the Assumption, the Lutheran participants thought that these need not divide the two churches as long as the sole mediatorship of Christ is safeguarded and in a case of more unity, Lutherans would not be asked to accept these two dogmas. There was an impression that the Mariology of Vatican Two included a strong description of Mary's mediator role. Lumen gentium was quoted: \\"in a wholly singular way [Mary] cooperated by her obedience, faith, hope and burning charity in the work of the Savior in restoring supernatural life to souls.\\"LG 28 \\"Taken up to heaven she did not lay aside this saving office but by her manifold intercession continues to bring us the gifts of eternal salvation.\\"LG 29 While Lumen gentium also stated that \\"is so understood that it neither takes away anything from nor adds anything to the dignity and efficacy of Christ the one Mediator.\\"L G 30 some Lutheran participants questioned whether these quote reduce the sole role of Jesus Christ as saviour. Anglicanism =Anglican mariology= Anglican Mariology has a long tradition and rich history. Anglican Marian piety is close to Roman Catholic devotion: Never think about Mary, without thinking about God, and never think about God without thinking about Mary.E L Mascall The mother of God, London 1948 From a Roman Catholic perspective, the closeness of the Anglican and Roman Catholic mariologies is overshadowed by the fact that Marian teachings have no binding doctrinal implications on Churches in the Anglican Communion.Algermissen Anglikanische Mariologie, Regensburg 1967, p.228 =Ecumenical dialogue on Mariology= The Anglican-Roman Catholic International Commission (ARCIC) claims to have illuminated in a new way the place of Mary. The joint study led to the conclusion that it is impossible to be faithful to Scripture without giving due attention to the person of Mary.(paragraphs 6-30). Mariological consensus Developments in the Anglican and Catholic communities opened the way for a new re-reception of the place of Mary in the faith and life of the Church.(paragraphs 47-51). Consensus was reached regarding the role of Mary: * The teaching that God has taken the Blessed Virgin Mary in the fullness of her person into his glory as consonant with Scripture, and only to be understood in the light of Scripture(paragraph 58); * That in view of her vocation to be the mother of the Holy One, Christ‚Äôs redeeming work reached ‚Äòback‚Äô in Mary to the depths of her being and to her earliest beginnings(paragraph 59); * That the teaching about Mary in the two definitions of the Assumption and the Immaculate Conception, understood within the biblical pattern of the economy of hope and grace, can be said to be consonant with the teaching of the Scriptures and the ancient common traditions(paragraph 60); * That this agreement, when accepted by our two Communions, would place the questions about authority which arise from the two definitions of 1854 and 1950 in a new ecumenical context(paragraphs 61-63); * That Mary has a continuing ministry which serves the ministry of Christ, our unique mediator, that Mary and the saints pray for the whole Church and that the practice of asking Mary and the saints to pray for us is not communion-dividing(paragraphs 64-75). Marian devotions The growth of devotion to Mary in the medieval centuries, and the theological controversies associated with them included some excesses in late medieval devotion, and reactions against them by the Reformers, contributed to the breach of communion between us, following which attitudes toward Mary took divergent paths.(paragraphs 41-46). The commission agreed, that doctrines and devotions which are contrary to Scripture cannot be said to be revealed by God nor to be the teaching of the Church. We agree that doctrine and devotion which focuses on Mary, including claims to ‚Äòprivate revelations‚Äô, must be moderated by carefully expressed norms which ensure the unique and central place of Jesus Christ in the life of the Church, and that Christ alone, together with the Father and the Holy Spirit, is to be worshipped in the Church.(ARCIC) 79 The Commission did not to clear away all possible problems, but deepened a common understanding to the point where remaining diversities of devotional practice may be received as the varied work of the Spirit amongst all the people of God.(ARCIC) 80 Issues concerning doctrine and devotion to Mary need no longer be seen as communion-dividing, or an obstacle in a new stage of growing together. The Commission hopes, that, ‚Äúin the one Spirit by which Mary was prepared and sanctified for her unique vocation, we may together participate with her and all the saints in the unending praise of God. =Joint Anglican ‚Äì Roman Catholic document= On May 16, 2005, the Roman Catholic and Anglican churches issued a joint 43-page statement, \\"Mary: Grace and Hope in Christ\\" (also known as the Seattle Statement) on the role of the Virgin Mary in Christianity as a way to uphold ecumenical cooperation despite differences over other matters. The document was released in Seattle, Washington, by Alexander Brunett, the local Catholic Archbishop, and Peter Carnley, Anglican Archbishop of Perth, Western Australia, co-chairmen of the Anglican‚ÄîRoman Catholic International Commission (ARCIC). The joint document is said to seek a common understanding to help both churches agree on the theological reasoning behind the Catholic dogmas, despite Anglicans not accepting the papal authority that underpins them. Carnley has reportedly said that Anglican concerns that dogmas about Mary are not provable by scripture would \\"disappear\\", with the document discussing that Anglicans would stop opposition to Roman Catholic teachings of the Immaculate Conception (defined in 1854) and the Assumption of Mary (defined in 1950) as being \\"consonant\\" with the biblical teachings.

He has received some attention due to his disappearance in 1882, after which he was never seen or heard from again. Early outlaw life Jesse J. Evans was believed to have been born around 1853 in Missouri, although some historians believe he was born in Texas. He was half-Cherokee, and a graduate of Washington and Lee College in Virginia. He was arrested with both his parents on June 26, 1871, in Elk City, Kansas, for passing counterfeit money. He was released shortly thereafter, and by 1872 he was in the New Mexico Territory. Evans began working as a cowboy, employed by several ranches, including that of John Chisum. After he ended his employment with Chisum, Evans ventured to both Las Cruces and La Mesilla, New Mexico, where he became associated with John Kinney. At the time, Kinney was leading one of the more well known gangs of the New Mexico Territory, called the John Kinney Gang. Evans joined the gang, and over time he and Kinney became close. On the night of December 31, 1875, Kinney, Evans, Pony Diehl, and Jim McDaniels went into Las Cruces. While there the gang members became involved in a disagreement and later a brawl with soldiers of the US Cavalry stationed at Fort Seldon. The outlaws lost the fight, and left, only to return and open fire on the saloon which resulted in several persons killed and wounded. According to one contemporary report dated January 3rd 1876, the soldiers came from \\"E\\" Company/Third Battalion/8th U.S. Cavalry. Two persons were killed-a Private Le Voir and a Mexican and three other soldiers were badly wounded and another soldier was found badly beaten. See Arizona citizen., January 15, 1876, Image 2. According to one newspaper report January 29, 1876 there were 3 to 4 killed and one crippled. See the Las Vegas gazette. volume, January 29, 1876, Image 1. There are different versions of casualties-see Footnotes #1; #2 #3 on Pony Diehl article. According to 1961 The English Westerners Brand Book Volume 3-13 \\"...Private John Reovir and a Mexican were killed and three soldiers, Benedict Alig, Hugh McBride, and Samuel Spence, and a Mexican were seriously wounded...\\". In addition another soldier would die of Injuries. See Nolan p.64] Forming of his own gang Kinney had been badly wounded in the earlier fight, and needed to heal. A short time after that night, while Kinney was still healing, Evans and gang member Samual Blanton shot and killed Quirino Fletcher in Las Cruces, for reasons still not known. There was also alleged to have been a third shooter present, a man named Morris, but that is unconfirmed. Evans stood trial for the murder, but was somehow acquitted. It was around this time that Evans broke away from the Kinney Gang to form his own. Several of the Kinney Gang members followed him as members of his new gang, to include Billy Morton, Frank Baker, Jim McDaniels, Buffalo Bill Spawn, Dolly Graham, Tom Hill, Bob Martin, Nicholas Provencio, and Manuel Segovia. Although usually referred as the \\"Jesse Evans Gang\\", they referred to themselves as \\"The Boys\\". They became involved in numerous acts of robbery and cattle rustling between 1875 Lincoln County War and after In late 1877 the gang was hired by the \\"Murphy-Dolan faction\\" prior to and eventually during the Lincoln County War, to face off against Billy the Kid and his faction. Despite the fame that Billy the Kid would eventually receive due to the war, by many accounts Evans was the most feared of the two factions. Evans and members of his gang harassed rancher John Tunstall, and on February 18, 1878, Evans, Frank Baker, William Morton, and Tom Hill murdered Tunstall, which ignited the Lincoln County War. Evans would figure prominently into the range war, often taking the lead on operations against the Lincoln County Regulators. His role is often downplayed, but in most documented accounts, Evans was at the front. In later letters written by Billy the Kid to Governor Lew Wallace, Evans was mentioned, and Billy Bonney even stated in one that he feared being assassinated by Evans. On March 6, 1878 William Morton and Frank Baker were tracked down by the Regulators and killed for the Tunstall murder, and on that same day Evans and Tom Hill were rustling sheep during which Hill was killed and Evans was wounded by the sheep farmer. On April 29, 1878, Evans led a posse that killed Regulator Frank McNab and badly wounded Regulator Ab Saunders. On April 30, 1878, Seven Rivers Warriors members Tom Green, Charles Marshall, Jim Patterson and John Galvin were killed in Lincoln, and although the Regulators were blamed, that was never proven, and there were feuds going inside the Seven Rivers Warriors at that time. The Regulators reacted by tracking down Manuel Segovia, the Seven Rivers gang member believed responsible for the death of McNab, killing him. Starting on July 15, 1878, Evans and his gang were a main factor in the Battle of Lincoln, which ended in a draw with three dead on the Regulators side, and three dead on the Murphy- Dolan side, along with several wounded. After the Lincoln War ended, Evans and gang member Billy Campbell on February 18, 1879, killed an attorney named Huston Chapman, who was the lawyer hired by Susan McSween on behalf of her husband Alexander McSween, who was killed during the Battle of Lincoln, and the gang was again on the run from lawmen. Texas Rangers caught up to them near Presidio del Norte, in Mexico. In the ensuing gunbattle, Evans shot and killed Ranger George Bingham, while gang member John Gross was wounded by the Rangers, and gang member George Davis was shot and killed by Rangers D.T. Carson and Ed Sieker. Ranger Carson was also shot and wounded. The gang had already lost several other members, killed prior to Presidio while Rangers were pursuing them, to include Dolly Graham. Evans was arrested, tried and sentenced to prison. However, he escaped while on work detail one day, but was recaptured a few months later. Sent to Huntsville Prison, he was released in 1882 and was never seen or heard from again. Where he went and what happened to him is a mystery. Joe Hines In 1948, a probate investigator from St. Louis, Missouri, William V. Morrison, located an elderly man called Joe Hines in Florida, who had claimed the lands of his deceased brother. During Morrison's interview, Hines said that of those involved in the Lincoln County War in New Mexico, three, including himself, remained alive, and that the other two were Jim McDaniels (an Evans Gang member) and Billy the Kid. Hines told Morrison of his experiences in the range war and surprised him by claiming that Billy the Kid was still alive, but refused to reveal the name he had assumed or exactly where he was living. Some commentators have suggested that Hines was actually Evans, living under an assumed name. Morrison privately continued his search for the man who claimed to be Billy the Kid, and in 1948 an elderly man named Frank J. Dalton in Lawton, Oklahoma claimed to be Jesse James, and said Billy the Kid was still alive in Hamilton Texas, where he was known as O. L. Roberts. With some coaxing, Roberts did talk to Morrison, who found his story convincing enough to write a book detailing Roberts' exploits as Billy the Kid, but eventually his story was discredited by almost all historians. Hines won his case, and was granted his brother's land in North Dakota, although it was never shown that Hines had been Evans. Morrison also attempted to track down former Evans Gang member Jim McDaniels, locating him in Round Rock, Texas. McDaniels, along with Severo Gallegos, Martile Able, Jose Montoya, and Bill and Sam Jones, all of whom had known Billy the Kid, signed affidavits claiming to verify that Roberts was, in fact, Billy the Kid. In popular culture and media In the 1970 movie Chisum, Evans is portrayed by Richard Jaeckel. The character is aligned with the Murphy/Dolan faction and is shot dead by Billy the Kid when trying to escape in the aftermath of the Battle of Lincoln.

AllMusic, praising the \\"pristine\\" sound and \\"lovely\\" packaging suggested that \\"no Davis fan should be without these recordings purchased separately or as a set\\". The All About Jazz website said that the set was \\"so fastidiously remastered it sounds live in your living room\\".  Complete cover imagery  The original 1961 albums and the 2003 complete reissues (both the 4-disc and 2-disc) displayed a photograph by Leigh Wiener of Davis with his first wife, Frances Taylor, for whom the song \\"Fran-Dance\\" was composed. The 2003 restoration of the original cover art came after a number of reissues that used a photo with an atmospheric representation of the exterior of the Black Hawk taken during Davis's performance. Complete track listing The track listing for In Person Friday and Saturday Nights at the Blackhawk, Complete reproduces in its entirety the performances of Friday and Saturday nights, April 21 and 22, 1961. Because of space constraints and a desire not to divide sets, the producers of the box set put sessions 1 and 3 together on the first disc, placing the more energetic and lengthier 2nd set on Disc Two. For the two double-disc sets, the track listing for Friday Night: In Person at the Blackhawk in San Francisco, Complete is that of Disc One and Disc Two, below. For Saturday Night: In Person at the Blackhawk in San Francisco, Complete, it is that of Disc Three and Disc Four.

The creek passes through some of the more scenic areas in the Austin region and forms a greenbelt that is the habitat for many indigenous species of flora and fauna. It runs beneath steep slopes and benches surfaced with shallow clay loams that support ashe juniper, escarpment live oak, mesquite, and grasses. The creek begins in north central Travis County (at ) and flows approximately southeast through Austin to Lake Austin, where it merges with the Colorado River (at ). Bull Creek is flanked by areas of the Balcones Canyonlands National Wildlife Refuge. Recreation There are parks and hiking trails along the banks of Bull Creek. The Bull Creek Trail offers a hiking and swimming opportunities. Bull Creek Park is a popular spot with easy access from Capital of Texas Highway, while St. Edwards Park (map) offers a more secluded experience. History Archaeological investigations of the Bull Creek area show a long history of utilization by humans. One study sponsored by the Bull Creek Foundation found prehistoric utilization dating from \\"Early Archaic to Late Prehistoric (Toyah phase)\\".Archeological Survey of the Stenis Tract Hike and Bike Trail, Bull Creek Watershed, Travis County, Texas, by Gemma Mehalchick, Douglas Kevin Boyd, Prewitt and Associates, and the Texas Antiquities Committee, published by Prewitt and Associates, 2004 Among the early Anglo settlers to the Bull Creek area were Will Preece, wife Elizabeth Gideon, and sons Richard Lincoln Preece (also known as Dick Preece) and Will Jr., both of whom would go on to be Texas Rangers. The Preece family owned about ‚Äúthree thousand acres that stretched from Lake Travis to Cedar Park, roughly along FM 1431‚Äù. Will Preece brought his family to Texas about 1838 and settled in the Bull Creek area. The name ‚ÄúBull Creek‚Äù is attributed to the killing of a male buffalo on Bull Creek, either by Will Preece, or by his son Dick. In his article, ‚ÄúMy Grandfather, Dick Preece‚Äù, Real West magazine, Harold Preece, grandson of Dick Preece, claims it was his great-grandfather, Will Preece, while other sources cite Dick Preece. That same article says that ‚ÄúA few miles from the Preece ranch lay the southern terminus of the bloody Comanche Trail‚Äù, and Dick Preece was active as a Texas Ranger in combatting the Comanche in Texas. During the Civil War, the Preece family, like many in Travis County, opposed secession from the Union, and the remote location and \\"caves\\" of Bull Creek provided a base for Union loyalists resisting the Confederacy. After the Civil War, a feeder branch of the Chisholm Trail is said to have passed by the house of Dick Preece. After his death in 1919 Dick Preece was buried along West Bull Creek, at the Preece cemetery, on Vaught Ranch Rd. Austin, TX 78730, just off RM 2222 (lat/long 30.372948,-97.807322). The University of Texas‚Äô Briscoe Center for American History is home to the ‚ÄúRichard Lincoln Preece Papers, 1859-1919‚Äù, which comprises correspondence, printed material, legal and financial documents, etc. pertaining to Dick Preece‚Äôs experiences as a soldier serving in the Civil War and as a rancher following the war. The History of Travis County and Austin states \\"The Mormons are credited with construction, in 1846, of one of Travis County's oldest roads to the northwest, the one that today is a scenic drive along Bull Creek to the Spicewood Springs Road, and which then led to a mill on Bull Creek used after the Mormon Mill washed away\\". The \\"Mormon Mill\\" referenced is the one that was built near what used to be called the \\"Great Falls\\" on the Colorado river before Tom Miller Dam was constructed, and the \\"scenic drive\\" is today Lakewood Drive. Most of the original road is now under Loop 360.

The market now includes a host of buyers and sellers, and an increasingly diverse infrastructure. Consumers range from residential buyers to huge industrial consumers mining the oil sands, operating pipelines and milling forest products. On the supply side, generators range from wind farms east of Crowsnest Pass to huge coal-fired plants near Edmonton. The diversity of Alberta's electricity supply has increased substantially. To a large extent because of deregulation, the province has more technology, fuels, locations, ownership, and maintenance diversity than in the past. The system's reliability, its cost structure and Alberta's collective exposure to risk are now met by a complex system based on diverse power sources, mainly coal and natural gas, with some wind and hydroelectric energy sources.  History  The Sheerness Generating Station, near Hanna. Commissioned in 1986, the 760-MW coal-fired power plant is a joint venture between ATCO and TransAlta. The 23rd Alberta Legislature passed the Electric Utilities Act (1996) effective January 1, 1996, which created Power Pool of Alberta, a wholesale market clearing entity. The Power Pool was a not for profit entity that operated the \\"competitive wholesale market including dispatch of generation.\\" The Electric Utilities Act stipulated all electric energy bought and sold in Alberta had to be exchanged through the Power Pool which \\"served as an independent, central, open access pool.\\" It functioned as a \\"spot market intending to match the demand with the lowest cost supply and establish an hourly pool price.\\" Alberta was the first Canadian province to implement a deregulated electricity market. Competitive wholesale markets were being fostered in the 1990s as part of the liberalization process of the 1990s changing some parameters such as the unbundling of generation, transmission and distribution functions of incumbent utilities. Local distribution utilities, either investor- or municipally owned, retained the obligation to supply and the 6 largest utilities were assigned a share of the output of existing generators at a fixed price. The province moved to full retail access in 2001. In 2003 The Alberta Electric System Operator was established under the provisions of the Electric Utilities Act, and through the AESO, a spot market was created. After consumers complained about high prices in 2000, the government implemented a Regulated Rate Option (RRO), as a means to shield consumers from price volatility. The generation sector in Alberta is dominated by TransAlta (formerly Calgary Power), ENMAX, and Capital Power Corporation, a spin-off of Edmonton's municipally owned company EPCOR. Utility companies in Alberta also include the wind generating Bullfrog Power, TransAlta Corporation, Alberta Power limited, AltaLink, ATCO Power and FortisAlberta. Although 5,700 megawatts of new generation was added and 1,470 of old plants were retired between 1998 and 2009, coal still accounted for 73.8% of utility-generated power in 2007, followed by natural gas, with 20.6%. Installed capacity reached 12,834 megawatts in 2009, with coal (5,692 MW) and natural gas (5,189 MW) representing the bulk of the province's generation fleet. As of 2008, Alberta's electricity sector was the most carbon-intensive of all Canadian provinces and territories, with total emissions of 55.9 million tonnes of equivalent in 2008, accounting for 47% of all Canadian emissions in the electricity and heat generation sector. In 2013, electrical generation consisted of coal (55%), natural gas (35%), renewable and alternative sources (11%).https://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/EnergyPoliciesofIEACountriesCanada2015Review.pdf pg186 By 2010 wind capacity had reached 657 MW and hydroelectric capacity produced 900 MW. In June 2010 the federal government announced tougher new emission measures. In November 2015, the Alberta NDP government committed to phasing out coal-fired power plants by 2030. In November of 2016, the federal government announced that coal-fired power plants are to be phased out by 2030 nationally. Following this, power generation from coal has declined significantly with little forecasted to remain online by 2023. Market components Alberta's electricity market consists of six fundamental components and features. *Seventeen firms supply electricity into the grid. Five of those providers‚ÄîATCO Power, Enmax, Capital Power Corporation, TransAlta and TransCanada Corp.‚Äîsupply about 80% of the province's generation capacity. *Alberta's transmission grid, owned in sections by companies like TransAlta, AltaLink and ATCO Electric, then carries electricity produced by generating providers to wholesale electricity purchasers or retailers. Connections to BC, Saskatchewan and Montana allow imports and exports of competitive power. *The Alberta Electric System Operator (AESO)Alberta Electric System Operator leads the planning and operation of the power system, facilitates competitive power markets. Also, it ensures and manages open access to the grid. *There are about 160 wholesale electricity purchasers, many of which are also resellers to other end-users like ENMAX, EPCOR, FortisAlberta, and Direct Energy. *Retail consumers have the option to buy electricity at competitive prices from third-party sellers like Just Energy or at regulated prices through the local utility like ENMAX and EPCOR. *The Market Surveillance AdministratorMarket Surveillance Administrator ensures that Alberta's electricity markets are fair, efficient and competitive. = AESO = While generation companies (e.g., EPCOR) continue to own both generation and transmission in Alberta, the Alberta Electric System Operator (AESO) which is \\"independent of any industry affiliations and owns no transmission or market assets\\" has transmission control. The Alberta Minister of Energy appoints the members of AESO's board. \\"[It] is governed by an independent board, which has a diverse background in finance, business, electricity, oil and gas, energy management, regulatory affairs and technology. The Board's governance strategy is founded on balancing the interests of a diverse set of stakeholders, while at the same time, providing benefit for the overall industry stakeholder needs. (AESO cited in Brennan 2008:9).\\" Electricity with British Columbia Alberta and neighbouring British Columbia are buyers and sellers of each other's power. Historically, commercial parties in Alberta import energy during peak demand period. Similarly, exports from Alberta frequently occur during off-peak periods (weekends, evenings, or statutory holidays when demand in Alberta diminishes or when there is an abundance of wind energy during off-peak periods). This energy trade confers benefits on both provinces. The power trade between the two provinces is based in part on geography. Alberta historically has had coal and natural gas, while B.C.'s generation is largely hydro-electric. Whether for reasons of temporary high demand, short supply or both, commercial parties in Alberta buy electricity from its western neighbour through AESO. By contrast, commercial parties might export electricity in Alberta during off- peak periods. During that period, B.C. uses that power to reduce its hydroelectric generation or that energy is wheeled through to the Pacific Northwest wholesale electricity market. Commercial parties in Alberta buy electricity from B.C. during periods of peak consumption, on unusually cold or hot days or when a larger-than-normal number of generators are down for maintenance. Historically, British Columbia bought electricity from Alberta during off-peak periods. More recently, purchases from Alberta tend to take place when there is an abundance of wind generation during periods of low demand in Alberta. This trade benefits both provinces to make use of their generating and storage capacity and use assets more efficiently. Also, it puts competitive pressure on power prices in both provinces. Electricity imports from Alberta represent just 3% of all imports into B.C. In fact, B.C. exports six times as much as it imports from Alberta, which helps to substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions there. Market models The differences between Alberta's and British Columbia's market models represent the two extremes in use within Canada. Alberta has developed a system in which markets determine wholesale prices and the pace of investment. B.C. has a conventional cost of service regulated power system (that exists in most of Canada and most of the United States). Despite the vast differences in market design and because of large differences in the mix of generation assets, the electricity systems of Alberta and British Columbia enjoy a unique symbiotic relationship. B.C. may provide a market for Alberta's off-peak surplus and a peaking supply for Alberta's crunch periods. The investment climate in Alberta has attracted a steady stream of private investors-funded generation projects since 1996. This is one of the reasons Alberta's electricity system has provided reliable, sustainable power even during periods of rapid economic growth.  Cost of electricity in Alberta  In April 2013, Calgary ranked third (with an average monthly payment of $216 based on a monthly consumption of 1,000 kWh) and Edmonton fourth ($202 a month) in Canada compared to other cities in terms of high electricity bills. Halifax placed first and worst in Canada at $225 a month. Compared to other cities in North America, Calgary and Edmonton placed seventh and eighth in terms of highest power costs. Vancouver, BC was among the least expensive ($130 a month). In Alberta, energy spending (without gasoline costs) represents 2.3% of total household spending.https://energyrates.ca/how-much-do-natural-gas-and-electricity- affect-the-cost-of-living-in-canada/ The unit price of electricity in Calgary in April 2013 was 14.81 cents per kWh, compared to 6.87 cents per kWh in Montreal, 15.45 in Halifax. Keith Provost, former senior vice-president of Alberta Power Ltd. (now ATCO Power), with decades of experience in the electrical utilities business, argued that instead of marketing electricity contracts for future deliveries in a regulated market, AESO has their own system that is open to manipulation and is not a free-market system. According to AESO, \\"The pool price is the arithmetic average of the 60 one-minute system marginal prices. Only those offers accepted generate power and receive the AESO pool price. All offers accepted receive the same price, the pool price, not the price offered.\\" It is this deregulated system that causes volatility in the price of electricity, keeps consumer prices high while maximizing profits to generating companies.

Hartenstein served as the headquarters of the British 1st Airborne Division. In the museum an extensive and diverse collection is displayed consisting of original weaponry, genuine uniforms and equipment used in the battle. The numerous photos and films on display provide a realistic picture which is enhanced by interviews with Allied soldiers. In addition the museum has an award-winning Airborne Experience exhibition, that depicts the area around Arnhem and Oosterbeek during the battle. The museum also provides German and civilian perspectives.  History of the Hotel Hartenstein  Historical records from 1728 indicate that an inn called ‚ÄòHet Rode Hert‚Äô (‚ÄòThe Red Deer‚Äô) stood at the important crossroad of the 'Utrechtseweg' in Oosterbeek. In 1779 the inn and the surrounding land was acquired by a wealthy attorney to the Court of Gelderland named J. van der Sluys. The inn was demolished and in its place a mansion was constructed complete with adjacent annexes. The new mansion was named ‚ÄòHartenstein‚Äô. After the death of Van der Sluys, ‚ÄòHartenstein‚Äô was passed along to a variety of owners. In 1865 the present building appeared on the site and a coach house was built next to it (now the site of restaurant ‚ÄòHartenstein@Laurie'). In 1905 the villa was extended with two conservatories. Finally, in 1942, the Municipality of Renkum became Hartenstein's new owner and transformed it into a hotel.Leloux, H.J., en Duyts, W.J.M., In Heerlijckheit en Hoofdkwartier 1949-1989 (Renkum 1989) 5-9  Operation Market Garden and the Battle of Arnhem  Major General Roy Urquhart shortly after returning to his Divisional HQ at the Hotel Hartenstein, 19 September. After the invasion of Normandy in June 1944, the Allied troops made a quick advance towards Germany. The supply troops could not keep up with the troops on the front line causing the advance to a halt. A new frontline was formed in Belgium and France. To avoid the Siegfried Line, Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery planned an operation in which Allied forces would occupy several bridges in the Netherlands between Eindhoven and Arnhem. If this mission succeeded, the road to Germany would be open. Operation Market Garden started on September 17th 1944 and ended in the morning of September 26th. In the end, Operation Market Garden failed due to a combination of factors: a lack of airlift to transport the British 1st Airborne Division and the Polish Brigade on the first day, poorly chosen drop and landing zones for the troops that were too far from the Arnhem bridge over the Rhine, an unrealistic timetable for their relief by XXX Corps, and above all, intense German opposition by the disregarded presence of SS armoured forces in the Arnhem area.Ed. Mayer, S.L., Encyclopedia of World War II (Feltham 1977) 18-19 In the area around Arnhem more than ten thousand men of the British 1st Airborne Division and the Glider Pilot Regiment landed north of the Lower Rhine, whilst the Polish 1st Independent Parachute Brigade landed on its southern banks in order to capture the Arnhem Road Bridge. Over 700 men under the command of John Dutton Frost did manage to reach the bridge and held its northern ramp for 4 days, but the bulk of the British forces were engaged by superior German forces (including the II SS Panzer Corps) and became trapped in Oosterbeek. Major General Roy Urquhart chose ‚ÄòHartenstein‚Äô as his headquarters. After holding out north of the Rhine for nine days, the division had to be withdrawn, although just over 2,000 of the 10,000 men who had landed reached the Poles south of the river. The Allied troops lost the Battle of Arnhem and ‚ÄòHartenstein‚Äô was left in a heavily damaged condition.Ryan, C., A Bridge too Far(Bussum 1974) 76-77  The museum  Airborne Experience Information Centre Battle of Arnhem, an appendix near the John Frost Bridge in Arnhem Shortly after the Second World War, plans were made to open a museum to commemorate the battle. In 1949 Doorwerth Castle near the Rhine was chosen as the museum's site. Soon it became evident that Doorwerth could not accommodate the display of the growing collection and a better location was sought. Hotel ‚ÄòHartenstein‚Äô, which functioned again as a hotel after the war, was chosen as the ideal place for a museum and was purchased. On 11 May 1978, Major General Roy Urquhart officially opened the Airborne Museum ‚ÄòHartenstein‚Äô.Leloux, H.J., en Duyts, W.J.M., In Heerlijckheit en Hoofdkwartier 1949-1989 (Renkum 1989) 46 In 2008, the museum temporarily closed for an extensive renovation and expansion: a brand new lobby and basement were added to the building. The basement is used to display the new 'Airborne Experience', a series of dioramas of the battle. The display was awarded the Gouden Reiger (‚ÄúThe Golden Heron‚Äù) a Dutch award for audience interaction in the category \\"three- dimensional media interaction\\" Permanent Exhibition, The battle of Arnhem in 9 Days: 'Did you know?' airbornemuseum.nl/en, accessed 26 September 2018 In September 2009, on the 65th anniversary of the Battle of Arnhem, the museum was reopened. Each year the Airborne Museum ‚ÄòHartenstein‚Äô is involved in events commemorating the Battle of Arnhem. It also serves as a gathering place for veterans, civilians and young people. The museum is close to the Arnhem Oosterbeek War Cemetery where several hundred of the Allied casualties are buried. Every year the participants of the Airborne March pay a special tribute when the parade is held in front of the museum. References Bibliography airbornemuseum.nl * mooigelderland.nl * Ed.

Biography George William Cooke was born in Kingston on Soar, son of William Harry Cooke, a farmer, and Sarah Jane (n√©e Whittaker). After attending Loughborough Grammar School he entered University College Nottingham in 1935 and, two years later, was awarded an external degree of the University of London, with first class honours in chemistry. He stayed on for another year, working with J M Gulland before starting research in the chemistry department at Rothamsted in 1938. After completing his thesis in 1940, Cooke moved from Laboratory life to field trials, examining the use of fertilizers and the profitable management of soils. The details of his many research activities are described in the Royal Society biography. His main focus throughout his career was on obtaining the maximum productivity of various soils with minimum addition of fertilizer. =Appointments= * Head of chemistry department, Rothamsted, 1956 * Deputy director of Rothamsted Experimental Station, 1962-1975 * Fellow of the Royal Society, 1969 * Member of the Soil Survey Research Board, 1962-1966, 1969-1973 * Agricultural consultant to the Rubber Research Institute of Malaysia, 1962-1978 * Chairman of the Rothamsted Field Plots Committee, 1971-1975 * Foreign member of the Lenin All-Union Academy of Agricultural Sciences of the USSR, 1972 * Consultant in soils to the Empire Cotton Growing Corporation, 1972-1973 * CBE, 1975 * Chief Scientific Officer of the Agricultural Research Council (ARC), 1975-1981 * Member of the Board of Directors of the International Fertilizer Development Centre, Muscle Shoals, 1976-1979 * Honorary member of the Royal Irish Academy, 1980 =Books= * Fertilizers and Profitable Farming.

Buenos Aires, October 15, 1955) is an Argentine politician. He served from 2005 to 2013 as Secretary of Domestic Trade, a position to which he was appointed by President N√©stor Kirchner and in which he remained under the presidency of Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner until his resignation, in the midst of scandal, in November 2013. He was found guilty in March 2014 of abuse of authority and was economic attach√© at the Argentinian embassy in Rome. A 2011 Financial Times (FT) article stated that Moreno was widely viewed as ‚ÄúArgentina‚Äôs de facto economy minister.‚Äù Moreno, wrote the Infobae news website in 2013, ‚Äúis the man who drives the economy of Argentina.‚Äù He was also described during his cabinet tenure as ‚Äúthe person most reviled by businesses ‚Äì good and bad alike ‚Äì in Argentina.‚Äù At the time of his resignation, Bloomberg News described Moreno as ‚Äúthe most feared government official‚Äù who had spent eight years ‚Äúcontrolling prices and imports using strong-arm tactics that earned him a reputation as a bully.‚Äù Mercopress, in 2010, called him ‚Äúa controversial but all-powerful thug-style figure from the Kirchner bunker.‚Äù Early life and education Moreno's parents were Victoria and Mario Antonio Moreno Bravo. He grew up in the southern suburbs of Buenos Aires. In 1970, the Moreno family purchased a house in the neighborhood of Villa Lugano. During the years that followed, Moreno began to be politically active. He is said to have been an active member of the left-wing group Peronist Youth, which favored a Castro-style revolution in Argentina, although some acquaintances have said he was an extreme Catholic activist. By 1982, he had become a ‚Äúmilitant‚Äù Peronist. After democracy returned to Argentina, he opened a hardware store, Distribuidora America, in the town of San Martin, and completed his degree in Economics at the Argentine University of Business (UADE).Diario Perfil: Guillermo Moreno: Biograf√≠a no autorizada del apretador oficial de los K , 20 April 2008. (Spanish) Government career His first government position was Under-Secretary of Production in the Buenos Aires City Government, under mayor Carlos Grosso, in the early 1990s. He later became an assistant to the Trade Secretary during the Presidency of Eduardo Duhalde (2002‚Äì2003).Clar√≠n: La carne no baj√≥ y Kirchner decidi√≥ cambiar a uno de los negociadores, 13 April 2006. (Spanish) Moreno was linked with economists Eduardo Curia, Pablo Chall√∫, and Daniel Carbonetto and with union leader Omar Viviani. He was also an advisor to the Argentine Workers Movement (MTA). He later served as an advisor to Pablo Chall√∫ at the Ministry of Domestic Trade and as an official in the Ministry for the Protection of Competition, both under the presidency of Eduardo Duhalde. Moreno became close to N√©stor Kirchner before Kirchner became president in 2003. He was one of the members of the Calafate Group, a think-tank created by Kirchner and others as a forum to foster ideas that would reverse the neo- liberal policies of the 1990s. In Kirchner's government, Moreno served as Secretary of Communications for a few months in 2005. Moreno was named Secretary of Domestic Trade by N√©stor Kirchner in November 2005. He remained in the post after Kirchner was succeeded in the presidency by his wife, Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner, in 2007.La Naci√≥n: \\"Cristina aval√≥ la manipulaci√≥n de las estad√≠sticas del Indec\\", 5-07-2009. (Spanish) Cristina Kirchner's government was described by the Center for Security Policy in 2013 as seeking ‚Äúto impose price controls by intimidating the business community,‚Äù an action ‚Äúopenly carried out by her Secretary of Commerce, Guillermo Moreno.‚Äù Moreno's severe control-economy approach was widely criticized for drying up investment and devastating Argentina's manufacturing sector. The Financial Times identified Moreno in 2011 as Argentina's ‚Äúweapon‚Äù in the fight ‚Äúto curb rising food prices and to ration gas to factories, to quell petrol price hikes and to block imports,‚Äù as well as ‚Äúto control the black market exchange rate.‚Äù Moreno, stated El Litoral, ‚Äúwas responsible for the implementation of various price-freeze programs, all with poor results.‚Äù These included short-term ‚Äúprice agreements‚Äù covering basic food products and bread prices. Moreno also introduced a government-issued ‚ÄúSuperCard,‚Äù also known in the media as a ‚ÄúMorenocard,‚Äù in 2013 as an alternative to regular credit cards. =Perception= Moreno has been described as ‚Äúmak[ing] decisions‚Ä¶with an iron hand‚Äù and as having a ‚Äúa style of permanent confrontation.‚Äù During his tenure in the cabinet, he was accused of using ‚Äúviolence to extort industrialists and entrepreneurs‚Äù and of encouraging ‚Äúquasi-guerrilla‚Äù activity by unions. He ‚Äútried to intimidate businessmen and traders,‚Äù and when that failed, he encouraged ‚Äúmarches and boycotts against those who dared to challenge his authoritarian behavior.‚Äù N√©stor Kirchner ‚Äúliked to say tongue in cheek that Moreno was as gentle as Lassie, the famed collie of movie and television.‚Äù ‚ÄúMoreno has no magic recipe or even particular policies,‚Äù stated the Financial Times in 2011. ‚ÄúBut in general, what he says, goes.‚Äù Moreno's ‚Äúmethodology is intimidation,‚Äù the FT added, noting that ‚Äúhe has been rumoured in the past to carry a gun and he took boxing gloves to a meeting of shareholders of a key newsprint company in which the state has a stake in a bid to show who was boss.‚Äù The newsprint company was Papel Prensa SA, which is controlled by Grupo Clar√≠n SA, Argentina's largest media conglomerate and most prominent anti- Kirchner voice; the meeting was in August 2010. The FT maintained that ‚Äúmany businessmen prefer silence to crossing with him ‚Äì perhaps remembering Mart√≠n Lousteau, a former economy minister, who defied him over farm export tariffs. Moreno was seen at an event running his fingers across his throat, indicating Lousteau was playing a fatal game: the minister indeed lost his job, while Moreno has gone from strength to strength.‚Äù Miguel Jorge, Brazilian Minister of Development and Industry, said in a 2007 interview that he had no interest in further meetings with Moreno, who had put a revolver on the table during a negotiation, apparently in order to intimidate his counterparts.http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2010/03/14/elpais/p-02158842.htm. (Spanish) =Inflation rate and INDEC= Graciela Bevacqua, the chief statistician overseeing the formulation of consumer price data at INDEC, the National Statistics and Censuses Institute, accused Moreno in 2006 of having requested the names of the stores surveyed in the calculation of the retail price index. She refused, on the grounds that the Secrecy Act forbade her to disclose such information to him.La Naci√≥n: Respalda ATE los dichos de Bevacqua y busca neutralizar \\"un maquillaje\\" en el Indec, 06-07-2009. (Spanish) Moreno's removal of Bevacqua from her post, and his firing of other officials who refused to understate the inflation rate, made him the target of nationwide criticism.Clar√≠n: Conflicto INDEC: un club de mujeres es el mayor dolor de cabeza para Moreno, 27 September 2007. (Spanish)La Naci√≥n: Boudou acept√≥ su derrota, 20-07-2009. (Spanish)Minuto Uno: Culpan a \\"la patota de Guillermo Moreno\\" por destrozos en el INDEC, 22 July 2008. (Spanish) He allegedly followed these moves by having phones tapped and using other surveillance methods to control internal disagreements at the bureau.La Naci√≥n: Intimidaciones, esp√≠as y peleas en el INDEC que maneja Moreno, 4-08-2008. (Spanish) Bevacqua recalled in a 2009 interview that Moreno had called her into his office on May 29, 2006, and had angrily criticized her statistical methodology and accused her of being ‚Äúunpatriotic‚Äù for not disclosing to him the requested details about the inflation rate. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll do it like in the old Peronist days,‚Äù he shouted, threatening to ‚Äúdelete‚Äù official data at will. After leaving INDEC, Bevacqua recounted, she was unable to find other work because of pressure exerted by her superiors, apparently on orders from Kirchner and Moreno. RT.com reported in 2013 that Moreno's stated inflation rate was ‚Äúlaughable‚Äù and that when Economy Minister Hern√°n Lorenzino had been recently asked what the rate was, Lorenzino had been ‚Äúvisibly terrified,‚Äù knowing ‚Äúonly too well that telling the truth about inflation will get him into huge trouble with Mrs Kirchner, Mr Moreno and the militant organization ‚ÄòLa Campora.‚Äô‚Äù In February 2013, the International Monetary Fund censured Argentina for failing to report accurate inflation data. =Anti- Clar√≠n activities= As part of the Kirchner administration‚Äôs attack on the newspaper Clar√≠n, which it accused of presenting a distorted view of Argentina under the Kirchners, Moreno displayed balloons reading ‚ÄúClar√≠n lies‚Äù during a 2012 visit to Vietnam. Also in that year, he handed out small cakes to members of Congress decorated with the same words. The Telegraph reported in October 2013 that Moreno had ordered major Argentinian retailers the previous February not to advertise in media owned by Clar√≠n, or in La Naci√≥n and Perfil, which were also considered hostile to the Kirchner regime. The Wall Street Journal reported that he was the subject of a criminal investigation into charges that he had given these orders. Other activities Moreno reportedly pressured Argentina's leading importers to boycott U.S. companies. According to a 2010 article in Mercopress, Moreno made it an ‚Äúunwritten rule‚Äù that Argentinian supermarkets must not import goods from Brazil that were also made in Argentina. When a leader of the textile firm, Kowsef SA, criticized Argentina's prohibitive tax level on textiles and refused to meet with Moreno, the government accused Kowsef of running illegal-immigrant sweatshops. The ensuing controversy surrounding Kowsef was described as the effect of ‚Äúthe long arm of Guillermo Moreno.‚Äù Praise and criticism A 2008 article in La Naci√≥n warned that the ‚Äúemphatic praise‚Äù for Moreno that had been proffered by the Kirchner administration in the wake of the INDEC controversy could cause trouble for Kirchner, given the low esteem in which Moreno was held in many quarters. La Naci√≥n quoted Senator Ernesto Sanz as saying that ‚ÄúMoreno is one of the most incapable and worthless men in this government. Everywhere he has touched, he has created disasters.‚Äù The INDEC would not be trusted again, maintained Sanz, unless Moreno and his entire staff were replaced. Adrian Perez, head of the Civic Coalition in the Chamber of Deputies, said that Moreno was a criminal and ‚Äúcompletely inefficient.‚Äù Oscar Aguad, head of the UCR's bloc of deputies, said that having Moreno as Secretary of Domestic Trade was a ‚Äúdiscouragement to investment,‚Äù given that Moreno provides ‚Äúfalse statistics,‚Äù ‚Äúprice controls,‚Äù and profit limits.La Naci√≥n: Fuerte y amplio rechazo a la defensa oficial de Guillermo Moreno, 30 July 2008. (Spanish) and it has often been argued that he exerts far more influence in national politics than would be reasonably expected, considering his office as a Secretary, formally subordinated to the Minister of Economics. It is believed his power struggle against former Minister Mart√≠n Lousteau was the main reason behind the latter's resignation in April 2008, after four months in office.Periodismo de Verdad: El matrimonio Kirchner decide si Guillermo Moreno y Ricardo Jaime contin√∫an en sus cargos, 15 May 2008. (Spanish) Trial and resignation In September 2013, Moreno was prosecuted before Judge Claudio Bonadio for dereliction of duty and abuse of authority in the INDEC matter. The charge was brought in 2011 by economist Jorge Todesca of the consultancy firm Finsoport. Todesca had been economy vice-minister under Eduardo Duhalde and was one of more than a dozen experts whom Moreno had fined 500,000 pesos apiece in 2010 for disseminating a version of the Consumer Price Index that differed from the official CPI. Bonadio froze 50,000 pesos worth of Moreno's assets. Moreno resigned his cabinet position on November 19, 2013, effective December 2. After his resignation, he was named economic attache at the Argentinian embassy in Rome. He was replaced by Axel Kicillof. After Moreno's resignation, Eduardo Hecker of the consulting firm DEL told Bloomberg that the Argentinian government was ‚Äúacknowledging that there is a problem in the macro-economy and that Moreno‚Äôs policies have failed to fix it.‚Äù Hecker added that Moreno's resignation ‚Äúshows that there was a political fight inside the inner circle that was won by Kicillof, who will became the most powerful economy minister from both Kirchner administrations as he has been the only one able to oust Moreno.‚Äù When President Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner arrived in Rome in March 2014 to visit the Pope, Moreno met her at the airport. A few days later, on March 20, Moreno was found guilty by Judge Bonadio of abuse of authority. Bloomberg News noted in late 2013 that despite his legal troubles, Moreno's annual income had increased during that year by 26 percent to 2.26 million pesos. Personal life Moreno was married in the early eighties to a psychologist. They are divorced and have two children, Joseph Paul and Victoria. He is currently in a long-time relationship with Amelia Marta Cascales, who has been described as his ‚Äúbattle partner‚Äù and legal bodyguard. Cascales is described as having her ‚Äúown place‚Äù in the constellation of ‚ÄúK power,‚Äù and as having ‚Äúmanaged to establish a personal relationship with the President‚Äù and won ‚Äútrust‚Ä¶in the first circle of Kirchner power.‚Äù Cascales has been deputy director of the state-owned firms Energy Argentina SA (Enarsa) and Soluciones Satelitales Argentinas SA, and served as notary in N√©stor Kirchner's establishment of Meldorek SA and in the formation of several other Kirchner-controlled businesses; she also helped produce the TV miniseries The Pact, which presents the official Kirchner version of the relationship between the Clar√≠n media empire, the largest media conglomerate in Argentina, and the country's last civil-military dictatorship.

The initials VL are those of Vladimir Lenin (ru: –í–ª–∞–¥–∏–º–∏—Ä –õ–µ–Ω–∏–Ω), after whom the class is named. History Designed by the (en: All- Russian scientific research and design-engineering institute of electric locomotive construction) ‚Äì usually abbreviated to –í–≠–ª–ù–ò–ò ‚Äì the VL80 enjoys the accolade of having the longest production span of any Soviet electric locomotive: 33 years. All variants of the series were built at the Novocherkassk Electric Locomotive Plant (NEVZ; ru: –ù–≠–í–ó) between the years 1961 and 1994. All the mechanical parts, traction engines, and auxiliary electric machinery were manufactured at the Novocherkassk plant. Some of the important components, such as the tractive transformer, were sourced from other factories. The first VL80s were characterised by their mercury arc rectifiers. Later, they were replaced with silicon ones, thus giving birth to the –í–õ80–ö (en: VL80K) series. The –ö stands for –∫—Ä–µ–º–Ω–∏–π, the Russian word for silicon. Between the years 1961 and 1973, a total of 695 VL80Ks had been produced. Currently, the VL80 series is used on all electrified routes in Russia, as well as in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Belarus, and Ukraine. Technical data The VL80 is a dual-section (or articulated) locomotive composed of two identical units, each resting on two two-axle bogies, powered by eight –ù–ë-418–ö6 (en: NB-4186K6) electric tractive motors equipped with axle- support suspension. In order to pick up the current from overhead lines, the VL80 is fitted with two pantographs; one above the driver's cab on each section. Similarly, each section of the locomotive is equipped with one –û–î–¶–≠-5000/25–ë (en: ODCE-5000/25B) tractive transformer. The VL80T and –í–õ80–° (en: VL80S) models are furnished with dynamic brakes. VL80T Manufactured between 1961 and 1980, the VL80T (ru: –í–õ80—Ç) introduced a markedly different electrical system, as well as an improved lateral support system which improved the locomotive's stability. Originally, the series used spring suspension similar to that found in the VL80K, but all models built since 1971 have cradle suspension. A total of 2,107 units were made during the 19 years in which the series was in production. VL80R Designed for use along the difficult sections of the Krasnoyarsk, Eastern Siberia, and Far Eastern routes ‚Äì as well as the \\"–ë–∞—Ç–∞–π—Å–∫\\" (en: Bataysk) depot in the North Caucasus ‚Äì the VL80R (ru: –í–õ80–†) has the same tractive capabilities as the VL80T and the VL80S. The difference between the VL80R and the two aforementioned models is that it has an improved anti-wheelslip system which continuously regulates the amount of voltage supplied to the traction engines, thus ensuring that an increase in thrust doesn't result in jerks, which invariably lead to wheelslip. The VL80R gets its R designation from the fact that it is fitted with regenerative braking (ru: —Ä–µ–∫—É–ø–µ—Ä–∞—Ç–∏–≤–Ω–æ–µ —Ç–æ—Ä–º–æ–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ) mechanism. Several locomotives, assigned to the Krasnoyarsk section, have been modernised and are capable of participating in MU operations with consists containing 3 coupled units. Despite having been in production for almost 20 years (1967-1986), a mere 373 examples rolled out of the NEVZ plant. =Notable examples= –í–õ80–†-1549 was used as an exhibit at the –≠–ª–µ–∫—Ç—Ä–æ-77 (en: Elektro-77) expo held in Moscow in June 1977. Built in 1982, –í–õ80–†-1718 became the 10,000th locomotive to be produced by NEVZ, since the plant's inception in 1936. –í–õ80–†-1685 featured in the Soviet film –ú–∞–≥–∏—Å—Ç—Ä–∞–ª—å (en: Mainline) and has obtained cult status amongst Russian rail enthusiasts. VL80S The VL80S (ru: –í–õ80—Å) is simply a VL80T which has been modified for use in MU operations. The 'S' in its name derives from the first letter of the Russian term for multiple-unit train control: –°–∏—Å—Ç–µ–º–∞ –ú–Ω–æ–≥–∏—Ö –ï–¥–∏–Ω–∏—Ü (literally: Multiple Unit System) and commonly shortened to –°–ú–ï. The first VL80Ss to roll off the production line were designed to work with only two or four coupled units (or sections). In 1982, unit numbers 550, 551, and 552 were built to work with sets of two, three, or four sections. All VL80Ss built since 1983 (–í–õ80—Å-697 being the first of these) have this capability. The only restriction is that the consist cannot be a third trailer section equipped with dynamic brakes. As a result of several modifications being made to the locomotive's construction, enabling it to pull additional units, the new certified weight became 192 tonnes. A total of 2,746 examples rolled out of the NEVZ works between 1979 and 1994. VL80SM The last of the VL80 series, only 4 VL80SMs (ru: –í–õ80—Å–º) were built during the model's three year, post- Soviet production life (1991-1994). All four units are currently housed at the Bataysk depot in the North Caucasus.

The game was created by Ed-u-Cards Manufacturing Corporation, New York. The deck The deck consists of 36 cards representing a variety of base hits, (mostly singles, but only one home run), balks, stolen bases, a hit-by-pitcher, balls, strikes, and a variety of outs. Two outs, a full count, one RBI, and the bases are loaded: a standard deck (circa 1957) with the original diamond diagram. A typical deck from the late 1950s or early 1960s consists of: *10 balls *10 strikes *2 foul balls *2 fly outs *1 foul out *2 singles *2 doubles *1 triple *1 home run *1 balk *1 stolen base *1 hit-by- pitcher Early \\"Batter-Up Baseball\\" deck, c. 1949, with instruction sheet/diamond diagram Earlier decks omitted the balk, stolen base, and hit-by- pitcher, in favor of an additional ball, an additional double play, and an additional single. \\"Mets\\" Special Edition deck from the early 1960s In some editions from the 1960s, strikes and outs are color-coded orange, balls green, and all cards that advance a runner, blue, while in late-1950s editions, strikes and outs are green, balls blue, and cards advancing a runner, red. The cards are illustrated with line drawings of the action represented by the card; in the 1960s, a New York Mets edition included Mr. Met as the principal figure in the illustrations, and a Mets logo as the back design. The play The game is playable by any arbitrary number of players (the box stating that it \\"can be played by 1 to 9 players\\"). The cards are not dealt; instead, whichever player is \\"at bat\\" turns over cards from a freshly shuffled deck until put out three times, following the actions named on the cards: *Strikes are collected, with three strikes becoming an out (and clearing any collected balls). *Balls are collected, with four balls becoming a walk (and clearing any collected strikes). *Outs are collected (with each out clearing strikes and balls) until the third out ends the player's turn. If the out is marked \\"double play at first,\\" and a double play at first is possible, then it counts as a double play. *Base hits, walks, and hit-by-pitcher are placed on the diamond diagram, with any cards already on the diagram advancing appropriately. A base hit clears the balls and strikes. *Balks and stolen bases advance runners according to the instructions on the card, and actual baseball rules. An inning consists of each player getting a turn \\"at bat\\" for three outs; a game consists of nine innings. Scoring is as in an actual baseball game. Availability This game had a limited print run, but decks of varying vintage can be found online. Or one could improvise a deck from the same \\"VisEd\\" cards traditionally used in the game of 1000 Blank White Cards.

For Lithuania (in burgundy) it was the only access to the Baltic Sea. Treaty of Salynas (, ) was a peace treaty signed on 12 October 1398 by the Grand Duke of Lithuania Vytautas the Great and the Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights Konrad von Jungingen. It was signed on an islet of the Neman River, probably between Kulautuva and the mouth of the Nevƒó≈æis River. It was the third time, after the Treaty of K√∂nigsberg (1384) and Treaty of Lyck (1390), that Vytautas promised Samogitia to the Knights. The territory was important to the Knights as it physically separated the Teutonic Knights in Prussia from its branch in Livonia. It was the first time that the Knights and Vytautas attempted to enforce the cession of Samogitia. However, it did not solve the territorial disputes over Samogitia and they dragged on until the Treaty of Melno in 1422. Background When Grand Duke of Lithuania Jogaila married Jadwiga of Poland and was crowned as King of Poland in 1386, he appointed his unpopular brother Skirgaila as viceroy for Lithuania. Vytautas seized the opportunity to renew his struggle for power and started the Lithuanian Civil War (1389‚Äì92). He allied himself with the Teutonic Knights, promising them Samogitia. However, Jogaila and Vytautas reconciled in 1392 by signing the Treaty of Astrava. The Knights, betrayed by Vytautas, invaded Lithuania in 1394 and unsuccessfully besieged Vilnius for three weeks. The invaders were driven away by joint Lithuanian and Polish forces demonstrating that the old raids were no longer effective against the new Polish‚ÄìLithuanian alliance. A truce between the Knights and Vytautas was signed in 1396. Vytautas needed to secure his western front as he was planning a massive campaign against the Golden Horde, which resulted in a disaster at the Battle of the Vorskla River in 1399. Treaty Former Vytautas' captive and friend Marquard von Salzbach helped to negotiate the agreement. A preliminary treaty was signed on 23 March 1398, in Hrodna; it was finalized in October 1398. According to the treaty Samogitia was ceded to the Knights roughly up to the Nevƒó≈æis River, leaving the mouth of Nevƒó≈æis in Vytautas' hands. For the first time the Order also received a portion of Sudovia, an almost uninhabited territory north and west of the ≈†e≈°upƒó River. The treaty recognized spheres of influence: Veliky Novgorod for Vytautas and Pskov for the Knights. Vytautas also promised to help the Knights build two new castles as compensation for castles he burned in 1392. The Knights promised to help Vytautas in his campaign against the Tatars. The treaty also guaranteed freedom of trade. Sigismund Kƒôstutaitis and other hostages kept by the Knights since the Civil War were released. During the week-long celebration following successful negotiations, Lithuanian nobles proclaimed Vytautas as King of Lithuania. While such a declaration had no political force, it was a reply to demands by Jadwiga of Poland to pay Polish taxes. It showed their determination to keep the Grand Duchy of Lithuania separate from the Kingdom of Poland despite the Union of Krewo in 1385. Such a proclamation, known only from the chronicles of Johann von Posilge, raised doubts as to reliability among Polish historians. The treaty is noted among Lithuanian historians as it showed the extent of Vytautas' power in Lithuania: he made territorial concessions without approval from Jogaila, who theoretically was the Supreme Duke of Lithuania. Aftermath The Order attempted to take control of Samogitia. They took many hostages into Prussia and presented Samogitian nobles with gifts (wool, salt, clothes). They also built fortresses ‚Äì one with Vytautas' help near Nevƒó≈æis River and another (named Friedeburg) near Dubysa. The Knights tried to maintain a friendly relationship with Vytautas, warmly welcoming his wife Anna during her pilgrimage to the tomb of Dorothy of Montau and sent him gifts. However, soon disagreements arose when the Order demanded the return of about 4,000 peasants who escaped into Lithuania. Vytautas argued that they were free people and had the right to choose where to live. The disagreement grew into a war. The treaty was violated in March 1401 by Vytautas, who was assured Polish support by signing the Union of Vilnius and Radom in January 1401. The Samogitians organized a local rebellion, capturing and burning the two newly built castles. In the fall of 1401 the Knights raided Kaunas and Hrodna; in May 1402 the Samogitians burned Klaipƒóda. Vytautas joined the fight in 1402 by attacking Raudondvaris (Gotteswerder). Jogaila's brother ≈†vitrigaila joined the war on the side of the Teutonic Knights as he had laid claim to the throne of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. He confirmed the Treaty of Salynas in exchange for Order's military assistance. When neither side could achieve decisive victory and Vytautas wished to concentrate his attention on troubles in Smolensk, the Treaty of RaciƒÖ≈º was signed on 22 May 1404. It mirrored the Treaty of Salynas, but did not solve the disputes. The second Samogitian uprising in 1409 resulted in the Battle of Grunwald in 1410.

He is usually referred to as Donald Walsh. He was the creator of the Walsh diagram and Walsh's Rules.A Dictionary of Chemistry R Rennie & J Law Life Arthur Donald Walsh was born on 8 August 1916 to Arthur Thomas Walsh (who worked for Messenger & Co. Ltd.) and Amy Florence (n√©e Vollans). He spent his early rears with the family at 11 Burton Street, Loughborough, first attending the local primary school, and then Loughborough Grammar School, from 1928 to 1935. Walsh won a Mawson Scholarship to Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, graduating with a Natural Sciences Tripos in 1938. He then undertook research with W C Price on the spectra of double- and triple-bonded molecules, including butadiene, diacetylene and acrolein; he was awarded a PhD in 1941. He was then invited by Professor R G W Norrish to join a project on the study of knock in combustion engines; his work is described in detail in the FRS Biographical Memoir. In the period 1946-1949 Walsh was funded by an ICI fellowship at Cambridge to continue work in both spectroscopy and combustion. This was followed by a lectureship (and then a readership) at Leeds, during which time he spent a semester as Visiting Professor at the University of California, Berkeley (1950-51). On his return he wrote his well- known series of ten papers on The electronic orbitals, shapes, and spectra of polyatomic molecules, published in 1953. See Walsh diagram for detailed list In 1955 he left Leeds to take the Baxter Chair of Chemistry at Queen's College, Dundee, then a part of the University of St Andrews where he then spent the rest of his career. During his tenure he expanded the number of staff in his department, and attracted several research chemists via industrial research grants. When Queen‚Äôs College gained independence as the University of Dundee in 1967, he was appointed Dean of the Faculty of Science. As Dean of Science, he played a key role in creating a biochemistry department at the University. As convenor of the University of Dundee‚Äôs gardens sub- committee he was a prime mover in developing open spaces on the institutions main campus, notably Frankland Court, the establishment of which particularly pleased him. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were Ernest Geoffrey Cullwick, George Dawson Preston, John Meadows Jackson, Alexander Murray MacBeath and Anthony Elliot Ritchie. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1964. Family Walsh married Elin Frances Woolley in 1945. They had met in Cambridge when she was a student at Girton. Elin, a geographer, published a paper the year she was married. The couple adopted two children (Peter in 1951 and Valerie in 1953) and later in 1957 had twins of their own in Dundee (Timothy and Margaret).

The house is still used as a private summer residence.Polly M. Rettig and S. S. Bradford (March 8, 1976) , National Park Service and Description and history The Gilman House is set on a high bluff, overlooking the town of Northeast Harbor's harbor area to the east, with views extending south toward Bear and Sutton Islands. It is a three-story wood frame structure, clad in wooden shingles, with a side gable roof large enough to house the full third floor. The house is oriented to the waterfront, with an open veranda across the eastern facade, and porches on the north side of the first and second floors. The living room, which takes up the southern part of the house, has a projecting bay window. The house is little-altered since it was built in 1880s, the principal alteration being the removal of some partitions to enlarge the kitchen. The house was built for Daniel Coit Gilman, and was his summer residence until his death in 1908. Gilman was a native of Norwich, Connecticut, who graduated from Yale College in 1848. He helped to organize Yale's Sheffield Scientific School in 1855, and became the school's librarian and secretary, as well as teaching geography as a professor. He became president of the recently founded University of California at Berkeley in 1872, but left that school over disagreements on curriculum. He was appointed president of the newly founded Johns Hopkins University in 1875, where he was able to implement ideas about high level competence in subject material by its professors, a high-quality student body, and the importance of academic freedom and research in the university setting. The success of these ideas was demonstrated by their wide adoption by other academic institutions, and by the presence of Johns Hopkins graduates in the professorial ranks of more than 60 schools by 1892.

The show was produced by Total Television, which created King Leonardo and His Short Subjects, Tennessee Tuxedo and His Tales, and Underdog. The show was cancelled by CBS after one season, despite finishing in the top 10 for Saturday mornings. It then went into reruns on ABC from September 9, 1967, to September 2, 1968. Inspiration It is often claimed that the show drew inspiration from the rock band the Beatles, based on the similarity of the show's name. In fact, the two characters in the band, Stringer and Tubby, were spoofs of Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis. The original masters of this series are in the possession of TTV artist Joe Harris, according to an interview Harris did for the book Created and Produced by Total Television Productions by Mark Arnold. A soundtrack album, Here Come the Beagles, was released on Columbia Records's Harmony offshoot in 1967. The single \\"Looking For The Beagles/I Want To Capture You\\" was released on Columbia, as Harmony did not release singles. Bio The Beagles were different from The Beatles in that The Beagles were a duo rather than a quartet and both members were anthropomorphic dogs. Stringer (voiced by Mort Marshall impersonating Dean Martin), the tall one, played guitar, while Tubby (voiced by Allen Swift impersonating Jerry Lewis), short, fat and wearing spectacles, played stand-up bass. They often got into trouble as a result of publicity stunts planned by their manager, a Scottish terrier named Scotty (also voiced by Swift). Cancellation According to Joe Harris, the editor of The Beagles died on the job and his widow threw out all the editing materials including the master negatives. The series was presumed lost; but the original negatives and tracks were found decades later in a warehouse owned by Golden Books. The films had apparently been shipped by mistake to Producers Associates of Television, General Mills' TV film subsidiary, which owned all of Total Television's other series, and were only discovered after Golden Books had bought P. A.T.'s interests.

He started and finished his 19-year professional career with Levante, amassing La Liga totals of 387 games and eight goals over 15 seasons. He also represented in the competition Tenerife (four years), Rayo Vallecano, Villarreal (three) and Mallorca (four). Club career Born in Burjassot, Valencian Community, Ballesteros came through the ranks of local Levante UD. In January 1996 he moved on loan to the Canary Islands' CD Tenerife, making his La Liga debut on 3 January in a 2‚Äì0 home win against Racing de Santander. After making the move permanent he went on to become an important defensive player, also starting to garner a reputation as a tough, sometimes to excess, central defender: in the 1998‚Äì99 season, as Tenerife ranked second from bottom, he was sent off twice in just eight appearances. For the 2000‚Äì01 campaign, Ballesteros moved to Rayo Vallecano in Madrid, collecting ten yellow cards during his only season and playing all the games and minutes in the team's quarter-final run in the UEFA Cup. He subsequently spent three years at Villarreal CF, being an important defensive element as the club consolidated in the main division. From 2004 to 2008, Ballesteros represented RCD Mallorca also in the top flight, receiving six additional marching orders in over 100 first-team appearances. In July 2008 the 33-year-old was deemed surplus to requirements and released, re- joining freshly relegated to the second level Levante after 13 years. Veteran Ballesteros rarely missed a match for the Granotas in the following seasons, playing 34 matches in 2010‚Äì11 (one goal, against CA Osasuna in a 2‚Äì1 home win) as the team finally retained their top flight status. He fared even better the following campaign ‚Äì also finding the net once, at Rayo Vallecano in a 2‚Äì1 victory‚Äì to help the side finish sixth and qualify for the Europa League for the first time ever. Ballesteros was again a starter and team captain in 2012‚Äì13. However, late into the campaign, he, alongside Juanlu and Gustavo Mun√∫a, was accused by teammate Jos√© Barkero of lack of commitment during a 0‚Äì4 home loss to Deportivo de La Coru√±a, which led to several match fixing allegations.

Jacques Laudy was born in Schaarbeek in 1907 as the son of the painter Jean Laudy. He worked mainly as a painter, illustrator, and comics artist. Laudy started his career as an artist for Bravo magazine that, like Spirou magazine, was one of the leading Belgian comics publications before and during World War II. One of the other artists there was Edgar Pierre Jacobs, who had first met Laudy in the 1920s and who would become a lifelong friend. Laudy was the physical example for Blake, one of the main characters of Jacobs' Blake and Mortimer. Herg√© asked Laudy as one of the first artists, together with Jacobs, Paul Cuvelier, and Jacques van Melkebeke, to fill the new Tintin magazine. Laudy created The Legend of the Four Aymon Brothers. His only real series was Hassan et Kadour, while the rest of his oeuvre consisted mainly of one-offs, stories that didn't belong in a series. This lack of a series and lack of album publication also meant that Laudy never became as well known as the others. In 1992, he was the focus of a retrospective exhibition at the Belgian Centre for Comic Strip Art. His main interest outside art was music. From 1928 on, he was a collector and maker of pipes, mainly Scottish ones. An instrument made by him in 1940 is in the collection of the Musical Instrument Museum of Brussels. Bibliography Many works by Laudy have never been published as albums and are only available in the magazines they originally appeared in.

Background Gold has been the central element in the area's history going back to the 1858-1860 Fraser River Gold Rush. Miners rushed to the Cayoosh and Bridge River areas looking for placer deposits, One named Cadwallader looked for the outcroppings on the creek that is now named for him and turned out later to be the site of the richest hard-rock veins in the region. Early exploratory parties of Chinese and Italians in the upper Bridge River basin were driven out by Chief Hunter Jack, who himself had a secret placer mine somewhere in the region, believed to be in upper Tyaughton Creek. and whose big-game hunting territory this also was. During the 1870s Hunter Jack began to invite chosen prospectors into the valley, and ran a ferry across the Bridge River that virtually all entering the region had to cross. Among these were those who would eventually discover the hard rock lodes on Cadwallader Creek. Though styled the Bridge River Gold Rush, in this early period there were so few who had made it into the district that there were only forty residents during the 1890 Census, prompting the naming of one of the claims \\"Forty Thieves\\". In the 1890s intrepid prospectors searched for the underground source of that gold in the mountains. William Allen prospected the area in 1897, and his claim took the name from his hotel‚Äîthe Pioneer‚Äîin Lillooet. A small mill was imported from California, and later Welshman John Williams, who had worked the California goldfields, built an arrastra or Mexican rock mill, which became a symbol of the Bridge River mines and remained in service into the heavy-production years of the mines. Again in 1897, three men hiked in from Lillooet to Cadwallader Creek looking for gold. They made three claims‚Äîthe Lorne, Marquis, and the Golden King. These would form the core of the complex of claims which became the Bralorne Mine. Arthur Noel bought the claims and worked them sporadically, holding on in bad times, waiting for the good.. He installed a 12 stamp mill. Unfortunately, the mine became tied up in litigation and stood idle for a dozen years.. By 1914 Pioneer Gold Mines was set up with more industrial equipment, boilers and modern rock mill. The site worked through the 1920s and the profitable King vein exploited. But it was the collapse of world markets and the solid price of gold in the Depression, when the mines really took off; when men and investment ramped up production. The district was one of the few bright lights in the BC economy during the Depression - in a seven-year period in the 1930s, the mines of the Bridge River produced $370,000,000 in gold. Taylor installed a 100-ton a day capacity mill but under the direction of M. O'Brian, output increased fivefold.BC Dept of Highways viewpoint sign, Bralorne-Gold Bridge Road, often quoted in all sources. The golden years Bralorne came into its own in the Great Depression years. In 1931 Austin C. Taylor and associates acquired the Bralorne property and financed construction of a 100-ton mill. The Bralorne Mine operated from March 1932 until 1971. In that time 3 million ounces of gold were refined from its adits. From this wealth, came a complete town, with schools, churches, post office, houses, recreation halls and hunting lodges. The mines themselves needed support buildings; power houses, boiler houses, blacksmith shops, machine shops, concentrator buildings and so on. Over one hundred miles of tunnels were dug in the forty or so years of operation. As Bralorne sits on a volcanic fault, the shafts were quite warm inside: 40 degrees C was not unknown. On the topic of environment, the plant used cyanide to separate the gold from the quartz (see Gold cyanidation); when the site was abandoned the drums of chemical sat open and leaching into the rivers, though they have since been cleaned up. The Bridge River provided a sanctuary from the economic woes of the world. As all around North America plants were idled and people starved, Bralorne provided a ray of hope. Hundreds of men were on the payroll for the mines. Huge bunkhouses were built to shelter the men. A huge community ensued‚Äîbanks, churches, ball teams, and bakeries followed. In fact, the Bralorne mines propped up an otherwise failing region. Without the business from the mines, the Pacific Great Eastern railway, truckers, Cariboo ranchers, and town of Lillooet probably would have failed. Parts for all heavy equipment for the mines were brought into the district via the tortuous Mission Mountain Road and its continuation the Bridge River Road, after being barged down Seton Lake to Shalalth from the Lillooet end of the lake, when not shippable by railway. Other nearby mines As the Bridge River region is rich in mineral deposits, other mines sprouted at Brexton and Minto City. These mines were not as large as Bralorne, employing men in the order of dozens, and not hundreds, but still contributed to the area. Bralorne today Bradian is an unoccupied neighbourhood of Bralorne, aka \\"Third Townsite\\". For many years Bralorne sat abandoned and forgotten, its empty buildings bare and open to all who want to strip or damage them. Lately, interest has been renewed in the area, and people are returning using some of the old buildings as recreation properties. An extensive museum of the area is in Bralorne. Some other buildings have fallen down, have been burned, or stripped of lumber and fittings. The rusting and derelict ball and concentrator mill, has been cleaned up under the Mine Reclamation Act. Since 2002 rising gold prices have led to new exploration in the area and plans for re-opening the Bralorne Mine, and nearby Pioneer Mine.. In 2014, a realtor put the Bralorne's \\"third townsite\\", Bradian, on sale for $1 million. Recently, the entire town was sold for just over one million dollars. It is a ghost town consisting of some 20 dwellings last occupied in the 1970s.

It is located on the Merthyr Line, north of . Passenger services are provided by Transport for Wales.  History  Ex- Taff Vale 0-6-2T in 1946 It was first opened on this site as \\"Navigation Road\\" in 1840 and was then renamed \\"Aberdare Junction\\" by the Taff Vale Railway in 1846 then further renamed \\"Abercynon\\" in 1896 and to \\"Abercynon South\\" in 1988. The original station buildings, including the Great Western Railway signal box of 1932 (which originally came from Birmingham Moor Street station) have been demolished, with the signal box being demolished near the end of 2013. In November 2007, a proposal was submitted by the Welsh Assembly Government to discontinue all services provided at . From a date \\"no sooner than 1st May 2008\\" as the notice ran, all services were to be transferred to Abercynon South, which would be rebuilt (with the reinstatement of the disused \\"up\\" side of the island platform) to accommodate all services serving both stations. Abercynon Railway Station before the merger with Abercynon North and the subsequent rebuilding of the station Following the merger of Abercynon North and South, the latter station's name reverted to simply \\"Abercynon\\". On 14 December 2010, a free Park and Ride car park opened on the site of the station yard, with capacity for 160 cars. This is hoped to improve commuter travel to Cardiff and other areas on the Valley Lines network. This was funded by the Welsh Assembly Government and the European Regional Development Fund. On 26 and 27 April 2012, the British Royal Train visited the station as part of the tour of the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II. The train had to stop at Abercynon due to the tight curves on the line, with the Royals continuing their journey by road. In October 2013 the Signal Box (out of use since the aforementioned 2008 remodelling & resignalling) was removed and a new Ticket Vending Machine was installed on the station to enable travellers to purchase tickets before boarding a train as well printing tickets for pre-booked journeys. The layout is currently controlled from an interim signalling centre next to the 'up' (Cardiff-bound) platform. This was due to hand over control to the Cardiff Rail Operating Centre in 2014 as part of the wider modernisation of the area ahead of electrification of the Valley Lines network, but still appears to be under control. On 21 February 2015, a blue plaque was unveiled at the station entrance to mark the location of trade unionist John Ewington's workplace. His claim against his employer, the Taff Vale Railway Company for unfair treatment led to the famous Taff Vale Case which was fundamental in the creation of the Labour Party. In February 2016 work started at the station to improve the facilities ahead of the South Wales Metro system. Work included the installation of an extra shelter and a bike shelter where the old signal box stood. Transport for Wales replaced an existing shelter with a larger one including TFW branding in Spring 2019. In December 2017 Rhondda Cynon Taff funded the expansion of the car park to increase the number of spaces for users. There are future plans to further increase the number of spaces which is a reflection of the popularity of the site for commuters. In April 2019, Rhondda Cynon Taf council opened a further extension to the car park. An extra 310 spaces have been built in the nearby Navigation Park to cater for future increase in demand. Other work included adapting the footpath to the station and adding a bus stop in the existing car park. The project was funded by the Welsh Government. In October 2018, it was announced that the South Wales Metro would receive ¬£119 million from the European Union. Some of this money is earmarked for doubling the line from Abercynon and Aberdare and from Abercynon to Merthyr Tydfil. Extra platforms would also be built to handle the extra services.  Service  During a typical off-peak service, Abercynon is served by four southbound trains per hour, with all trains stopping at Cardiff Central. 2-3 of those trains then continue to Barry Island and an hourly service operates to Bridgend via The Vale of Glamorgan Line. 3 trains per day off-peak are also scheduled to terminate at Cardiff Central rather than continuing south. Northbound services operate twice hourly to Merthyr Tydfil and twice hourly to Aberdare Monday to Saturday. On Sundays, southbound services generally operate every two hours to Barry Island and Bridgend via The Vale of Glamorgan Line, and northbound service operate every two hours to Merthyr Tydfil and every two hours to Aberdare. From April 2018, Arriva Trains Wales increased morning and late afternoon services between Aberdare and Cardiff. This has given an hourly service between Aberdare and Cardiff in the morning and late afternoon. Major stations on the network are , , , and .

It was built in the mid-18th century for the Graham family on the site of an earlier house. William Adam prepared plans for Nicol Graham of Gartmore in the 1740s, but according to Historic Scotland, it is doubtful that he designed the house as built. The house was enlarged for Nicol's son, Robert Graham of Gartmore by John Baxter Junior in 1779-80. Gartmore became the home of Robert Bontine Cunninghame Graham (1852‚Äì1936) in 1883. He was forced to sell the estate in 1900 to pay death duties. The estate was then bought by Sir Charles Cayzer. It was partly redesigned by David Barclay, a student of Charles Rennie Mackintosh, who added the tower, altered the roof and redesigned the western front, in 1901-1902. Internally, the main stairs were relocated in the centre of the house and the staircase is substantial, timber (which Cayzer claimed came from the Spanish Armada) with balustrades and newel posts which reflect Mannerist forms. Stained glass added by Cayzer was designed by Stephen Adam.http://www.victorianweb.org/art/stainedglass/adam/gailbraith.html The house was commandeered by the Army in the 1940s, and became a barracks until 1950. After the war, the Cayzer family did not take the house back and it was sold off in pieces. In 1953, the Archdiocese of Glasgow bought the house to establish St. Ninian's, a list D school run by the De La Salle Brothers, a Roman Catholic religious order. During this period the house was the site of numerous cases of child abuse, perpetrated by the staff of St. Ninians. These cases did not come to light until several decades later.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1433637/Former-monk-is-found- guilty-of-child-abuse.html Between 1983 and 1985 Gartmore House lay dormant, and was then bought by The Way in GB Ltd as a European base for The Way International. From 1995 to 1997 Gartmore House was again empty until it was bought by Peter and Anne Sunderland in conjunction with Cloverley Hall, and became a conference and activity centre. In 2000, Cloverly Hall was bought over and Gartmore House became a charitable trust. Then, in 2004, it was joined with Carberry Tower in East Lothian. Gartmore House is now a conference centre, used by groups including schools, orchestras and religious groups. Recently, the oil fuel system was replaced by a Biomass heating system in an attempt to reduce carbon emissions. The house is a Category B listed building.

The squadron was first activated during World War II. After training in the United States, it deployed to the European Theater of Operations, whe it earned a Distinguished Unit Citation for its actions on D-Day. After V-E Day, the squadron remained in Germany until the fall of 1946 as part of the occupation forces. The squadron was reactivated in the reserve in 1949. It was mobilized for the Korean War, but was inactivated and its personnel used as fillers for other units. When the reserve began flying operations again in 1952, it was once again activated. The 303d was mobilized again during the Berlin Crisis of 1961. It continued the airlift mission until 1984, when it converted to operating fighter aircraft. History =World War II= Douglas C-47A-15-DK Skytrain Serial 42-92879 of the 303d TCS/442nd TCG at Fullbeck in Normandy invasion markings. The squadron was constituted on 28 May 1943 and activated on 1 September, as the 303d Troop Carrier Squadron, one of four squadrons assigned to the 442d Troop Carrier Group at Sedalia Army Air Field, now Whiteman Air Force Base, Missouri. The 303d, with its parent unit, was created to provide airlift support of Allied forces in Europe during World War II using cargo aircraft and gliders. Following their stateside training, the squadron arrived at RAF Fulbeck, England on, 23 March 1944, where they made final preparations for the pending invasion of Europe. On D-Day, 6 June 1944, the 303d participated in the airborne assault of the 82nd Airborne Division four hours in advance of the first seaborne landings at the Normandy beaches. The squadron went on to participate in other major operations in Italy, France, the Netherlands, and Germany throughout the remainder of the war in Europe. Following V-E Day on 8 May 1945, the squadron remained in Europe as part of the occupation forces until it was inactivated in 1946. =Reserves and mobilization for the Korean War= In 1949 the 303d was reactivated at Fairfax Field, Kansas City, Kansas, with its parent unit, the 442nd Troop Carrier Wing, and assigned to the Air Force reserve. =Return to reserve duty= Following another active duty tour during the Korean War, the 442nd, with the 303d, eventually relocated to Grandview Air Force Base, Kansas City, Missouri. The airport was renamed Richards-Gebaur Air Force Base in 1957 for Lieutenant John Francisco Richards II and Lieutenant Colonel Arthur William Gebaur Jr., two Kansas City fliers who died in military combat. The squadron was recalled to active duty for the Berlin Crisis in 1961 and, from 1966 through 1971, provided support for ongoing activities in Southeast Asia. The mission of the 303d changed to fighter aircraft in 1982 when the unit received the Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II and the unit was redesignated the 303d Fighter Squadron. In 1991 the Base Realignment and Closure Commission recommended the closure and inactivation of Richards-Gebaur. It was later announced that the 442d, with the 303d, would relocate to Whiteman Air Force Base, Missouri and, on schedule, in June 1994 the unit completed its move to Whiteman. After its return to its original home at Whiteman, the squadron deployed to Italy to support the No-fly zone over Bosnia and Herzegovina four times for Operations Deny Flight and Decisive Edge. In 1998, the squadron deployed to the Persian Gulf area for 45 days to support Operation Southern Watch, the United Nations' effort to deny Iraqi military access to southern Iraq. In 2000, the squadron's responsibility shifted from Operation Southern Watch to flying Combat Search and Rescue missions for Operation Northern Watch from Incirlik Air Base, Turkey. 303d operations and maintenance members, along with two A-10 Thunderbolt II aircraft deployed to Afghanistan from April to July 2002 in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. In March 2003, squadron members and aircraft were deployed in of Operation Iraqi Freedom. The squadron made Air Force history when it became the first Air Force fighter squadron to forward deploy into Iraq, soon after arriving in the area of responsibility, and based at Tallil Air Base. The squadron made Air Force history again when it became the first Air Force fighter squadron to forward deploy a second time into Iraq, this time to base at Kirkuk Air Base. The 303d returned home from Iraq in November 2003 following an eight-month deployment with no aircraft damage and no combat injuries. In 2006 the 303d won the A-10 gunnery competition Hawgsmoke. Fox News reported that on January 19, 2018, 12 A-10s from the Squadron were deployed to Kandahar Airfield, Afghanistan, to provide close-air support, marking the first time in more than three years A-10s had been deployed to Afghanistan.

The diet has been advocated by former U.S. President Bill Clinton.  Background  Esselstyn was born in New York City in 1933.

Esselstyn is also on the advisory board of Naked Food Magazine, for which he is also a regular contributor of articles espousing a plant-based diet.  Diet work  Esselstyn promotes his diet with claims it can prevent coronary disease and cardiovascular disease. The diet excludes all animal products and oils and recommends foods such as fruits, vegetables, pasta, and especially cruciferous vegetables. His work received media attention when former U.S. President Bill Clinton cited it, along with work by Dean Ornish and The China Study as the basis for his change of diet in 2010Philip Sherwell for The Telegraph.

Formerly a public company, it had eighty-five locations at its peak. Early History and Growth Timber Lodge Steakhouse Inc. was founded under the name Minnesota Steakhouse in September 1991 in Burnsville, Minnesota. The founder of Minnesota Steakhouse, Doron Jensen, changed the name to Timber Lodge in 1995 to make it more marketable in other areas of the country.Q-Steaks, Inc. Announces Management Changes - Free Online Library After the founder split off due to conflicts with his business partner, the company grew from 16 Minnesota locations to 85. Restaurants ranged from New York to Arizona under mainly the name Timber Lodge Steakhouse, with a couple exceptions (Paul Bunyans Steakhouse in New York). Bankruptcy and Closings Bad locations plagued the company and it dwindled back down to a few Minnesota restaurants. All locations outside the state of Minnesota have closed. The chain operated 18 locations when it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2006. In August 2008 Taher Inc. acquired Timber Lodge Steakhouse Inc. Minnetonka-based Taher Inc., led by founder and CEO Bruce Taher, provides foodservice management for schools, senior-housing facilities and corporate cafeterias in 10 states. \\"They have really good food,\\" Bruce Taher said about Timber Lodge. \\"They cook from scratch, which fits our culture of chef-driven restaurants, and I think they provide a good value to customers.\\" Bob Campbell, who was part of the previous ownership group that consisted of 10 local investors, said it was a good deal. \\"I think it's a very positive change for Timber Lodge, our employees and our customers, and in the long run for our vendors and everyone else involved,\\" he said. Timber Lodge was down to ten locations by the time of its sale to Taher. In November 2009, restaurants closed in St. Cloud, and Rochester, Minnesota. As a result of the closings, a judge levied a $3.57 million judgment against Timber Lodge for not fulfilling its leases. The Fargo, North Dakota, location closed its doors on July 24, 2010. The Sioux Falls, South Dakota, location also closed late July 2010. The Duluth location closed permanently on January 1, 2016. Owner Bruce Taher cited lack of customer parking, high rent, and the restaurant's large footprint as reasons for the closing. The Duluth restaurant had been located in the Waterfront Plaza building in Canal Park for 20 years. Following the May 2019 closure of their Bloomington location, the independently-owned Timber Lodge Steakhouse in Owatonna, Minnesota, became the only remaining location. In February 2020, the Owatonna restaurant was put up for sale.
