It is a distinctive dominant in the spa town of Darkov. The bridge is declared a Czech cultural monument.  History  The bridge, spanning the Olza River and connecting parts of Darkov, was designed by the Viennese builder Ing. Franz Rabe. The construction began in 1922 and was completed in 1925. During the floods of 1997, the Olza River nearly flooded the bridge. In 2003‚Äì2004 the bridge underwent a reconstruction. The entire reinforced concrete structure was re-mediated and the whole bridge body was lifted two meters above the original leveling, at the same time preserving the original wall reliefs. In the early years the bridge experienced a heavy car traffic. Since 2004 it has been designated for pedestrians and cyclists use only. It has been a Czech cultural monument since 1991. It has been part of the Karvin√° heritage zone since 1992.  Description  Reinforced concrete arched bridge with neo- baroque elements represents a unique technical solution. The bridge deck is suspended on two longitudinal arches. A lightweight reinforced concrete Vierendeel beam in the upper arch was used for the construction. The bridge is reinforced transversely with three triples of horizontal bars one above the other, interspersed with a vertical middle bar. The bridge height is 6.25 meters, the lower deck is 55.8 meters long and the bridge is 5.6 meters wide.  Gold coin  From 2011 to 2015, the Czech National Bank issued ten commemorative gold coins in the Bridges of the Czech Republic set.

This civil action involved two litigants - Annette Carson and Joanne Reynolds, which was on appeal from the Supreme Court and was a UK labour law and Human Rights Act 1998 case on \\"Right to property\\" under Article 1 of the First Protocol (Protection of Property) and Article 14 of the Convention (Prohibition of Discrimination. In Reynolds's case, there was also Article 8 - the right to respect for \\"private and family life\\" to consider.  Background  Carson relocated from the UK to South Africa in 1989 for work purposes, and continued paying her National Insurance Contributions (NICs) to ensure that on retirement she would be eligible for the full UK State Pension. She started drawing her UK state pension in September 2000, and then she realised that the amount she received would not be increased each year in line with her peers in the UK, and her pension was being \\"frozen\\" at the level at which she first started receiving it. Carson contended that she was being discriminated against with regard to deprivation of the annual inflationary increase to her UK State Pension because she had relocated to South Africa para 9. In addition, Carson contended that the failure of the UK Government to pay the annual inflationary increase to the UK State Pension in some countries but not others contravened the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and that she and many others were being discriminated against. She had found that the annual increase to the UK State Pension is payable in countries like the UK, the European Economic Area (EEA) and a number of disparate countries (the United States, for example), whilst not being payable in predominantly Commonwealth countries such as Australia, Canada, New Zealand and South Africa. Carson claimed that under Article 1 her state pension, or alternatively its uprating, are \\"pecuniary rights\\", and therefore ‚Äúpossessions‚Äù within the meaning of Article 1 of the First Protocol and Article 14. In her original case, Justice Burnton had found in favour of the UK Government, citing that the judiciary should not override legislative UK government policy. This was upheld in her appeal to the Supreme Court. Reynolds was born on 9 November 1976. When she left school she began work and continued to work until she was made redundant on 12 October 2000. Whilst she was working she paid National Insurance Contributions. On 24 October 2000 she applied for Jobseeker's Allowance and it was paid with effect from that date. There are two different types of Jobseeker's Allowance - ‚ÄúJSA(C)‚Äù which is based on National Insurance Contributions paid over a prescribed minimum period and is not means-tested - the other ‚ÄúJSA(IB)‚Äù is income-based and a Means-tested benefit. Reynolds was paid the lesser of the two amounts and therefore was taking civil action against the UK Government saying that the UK Government's action was incompatible with Article 1 of the First Protocol to the Convention; and under Article 14 of the convention she claimed she was being discriminated against because of her age; and under Article 8 of the ECHR (respect for her private life and her home); and finally her right not to be subjected to degrading treatment under Article 3 of ECHR (the prohibition of torture, and \\"inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment\\").  Judgment  = Carson's appeal = Lord Hoffman, one of the Appellate Committee Lords of Appeal Lord Hoffman stated that Carson's case was typical of over 400,000 United Kingdom pensioners living abroad in countries which do not have reciprocal treaty arrangements under which annual cost of living increases are payable. Arrangements exist for countries within the European Economic Area (which is made up on European Union countries, Norway, Iceland and Lichtenstein) and a number of other countries such as the United States (\\"treaty countries\\"). However, there are no such treaties with South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and many other countries. para 6 Carson complained that she was being unfairly treated, since she had paid the same National Insurance] Contributions as a United Kingdom resident and therefore she should receive the same pension. She is supported by associations of expatriate pensioners in South Africa and elsewhere. Whilst the case had generated a good deal of passion. para 7, Lord Hoffman stated that: :\\"The sense of grievance may be understandable but it is not justified. There is nothing unfair or irrational regarding the different treatment of people living abroad\\". para 8 Lord Hoffman agreed that there was no doubt that Carson was being treated differently compared to a pensioner who has the same contribution record but lived in the United Kingdom or a treaty country, but that in and of itself is not enough to amount to discrimination. para 14 Carson agreed that she could have no complaint if the United Kingdom had rigorously applied the principle that the UK state pension is for UK residents only and not payable to UK pensioners who had moved abroad, or who had, like her, relocated for work purposes. para 19. Lord Hoffman stated that it was unnecessary for the UK Government to try to justify the sums paid since it distracted attention from the main argument. para 26 Lord Hoffman dismissed Carson's appeal. para 34 In Lord Rodger's opinion, the fact that Carson gets less by way of pension does not constitute unlawful discrimination contrary to Article 14. para 44 He dismissed Carson's appeal. Lord Walker stated that he could understand Carson's dissatisfaction at this state of affairs, but, in his opinion, she was not misled concerning what her entitlement would be. para 71 He believed that this was an issue of macro-economic policy which was within the responsibility of the UK government para 80, and therefore he dismissed Carson's appeal. para 80 In Lord Nicholls's opinion, Carson's complaint would need to be specifically covered as a Convention right in Article 14 of the Convention (Prohibition of Discrimination) and on a ground stated in article 14. If this was true, then does Carson's difference in treatment, i.e. alleged discrimination stand up to scrutiny? Sometimes, where the position is not so clear, a different approach is called for, in which case the court's scrutiny may best be directed at considering whether the differentiation has a legitimate aim and whether the means chosen to achieve the aim is appropriate and not disproportionate in its adverse impact. para 3 Lord Nicholls had decided this was not the case and dismissed Carson's appeal. para 1 Lord Carswell had a dissenting opinion. Whilst it had been made clear in the Supreme Court that as far as UK law is concerned the difference in the way different cohorts of pensioners are treated is in accordance with the law, Carson and her fellow \\"frozen\\" pensioners can only hope that their appeals to logic and a sense of fair play will eventually prevail, contrary to their experience to date. para 93 Lord Carswell considered the impact of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\\"the Convention\\"), as brought into play by the Human Rights Act 1998 and whether it was unlawful for the Government to operate legislation which has such an effect, para 93 and Carson had been discriminated against. The UK Government maintained that her case could not be compared to other, similar cases, and therefore she had failed to demonstrate discrimination. para 96 Lord Carswell stated that other judgments had missed the fact that Carson's financial position cannot be directly compared with those of pensioners either in the United Kingdom or in other countries, since exchange rates, inflation rates and the cost of living vary between these countries, therefore her case could not be directly compared with theirs and that accordingly she had not been discriminated against. para 96 He stated that: :\\"A broader approach might more readily yield a serviceable answer which corresponds with one's instincts for justice\\". para 97 Lord Carswell stated that Carson and other pensioners who reside in countries in which their pensions are not uprated are unquestionably treated differently, to their disadvantage, by reason of their residence in those countries. It is a fallacy to use variation in exchange rates or the relative cost of living in different countries when comparing Carson, and other \\"frozen\\" pensioners compared with pensioners residing in the United Kingdom or in countries where pensions are uprated. That makes little sense. If some of them are not paid pensions at the same rate as others then that would, in his opinion, constitute discrimination for the purposes of Article 14. para 98 If the UK Government had submitted reasons of economic or state policy to justify the difference in treatment, then Lord Carswell would yield to its decision-making power in those fields. It has not done so. On the contrary, the reasons for the policy lie wholly in the cost of uprating. It is stated in paragraph 11 of the memorandum by the Department of Social Security (DSS) memorandum to the House of Commons Social Security Committee in the session 1996-7: :\\"Agreeing to additional expenditure on pensions paid overseas would be incompatible with the government's policy of containing the long term cost of the social security system to ensure that it remains affordable\\". The UK state pension was becoming too expensive to continue paying at the \\"full rate\\" to everyone who had paid into the social security system, so the UK Government had to find some means of keeping down the cost, and in so doing, deprived one cohort of pensioners from receiving the annual uprating. para 99 However, Lord Carswell stated, once the UK Government started uprating the UK state pension for some pensioners living abroad, then there can be no justification for paying some and not others and less than their peers in the UK. para 100 Lord Carswell therefore allowed the appeal and declared that regulation 3 of the Social Security Benefits Up-rating Regulations 2001 (SI 2001/910) is unlawful. para 104 = Reynolds's appeal = Lord Hoffman stated that the key issue was whether the UK government had the right to deal with Job Seekers who were under 25 in a different way to those who were over the age of 25. paras 36 & 3' Reynolds contended that Job Seekers Allowance and Income Support should be viewed in the same way, since both of them were determined on need, and were not related to lost earnings. With regard to Job Seekers Allowance, rather than the under 25/over 25 age demarcation, Reynolds contended that the legislation would be fairer if the distinction was between householder (of which Reynolds was one) and non-householders, since the expenses of a householder were much higher than those for a non-householder. para 38 The UK government confirmed that initially, the Job Seekers Allowance did have the householder/non-householder split, but this had been substituted with an age qualification instead. para 39 Lord Hoffman stated that, in terms of the Job Seekers Allowance, a line had to be drawn somewhere, and that the UK Government had determined that this line should be an applicant's 25th birthday, even though an applicant's expenses do not change the day that they turned 25. Lord Hoffman therefore dismissed Reynolds's appeal. para 41 In Lord Rodger's opinion, Reynolds felt that she was discriminated against on the grounds of age, but that the UK government treated the under 25 cohort of Job Seekers Allowance recipients as being in a different class since they will be receiving less, and therefore will have lower costs, and that by paying a lower amount, the UK government was encouraging them to live with others, rather than on their own, in which case there are many costs that could be shared, para 45 and therefore there was no unlawful discrimination under Article 14. He dismissed Reynolds's Appeal. Lord Walker reviewed the details as to Reynolds's alleged discrimination. para8 81-84 He then reviewed these circumstances against case law as it pertained to Reynolds and he then set out the five reasons that the UK government believed that there was no such age discrimination para 86 \\\\- People in the 18-24 age group earn less than those 25 and over; the majority of the \\"under 25's\\" do not live on their own, so their cost base is lower; the payment of lower amounts to the \\"under 25's\\" discourages them from living independently; there are other social welfare benefits that can be given to those who can prove financial hardship and, the UK government needs simple rules for good administration - the age distinction was easier to apply than those between householder and non-householder. Lord Walker stated that in Asmundsson v Iceland, paras 89 & 90 there was case law such as to support the distinction between those under 25 and those \\"25 and over\\". para 86 It was for the UK Parliament, and not the judiciary, to decide where to draw the demarcation line, and they had decided that is should be done based on age. para 88 Lord Walker therefore dismissed Reynolds's appeal, saying that demarcation lines needed to be \\"bright lines\\", and that it was the role of Government to draw them (as the United States Supreme Court had done in the Margia case, para 91 and he therefore dismissed Reynolds's appeal.

History  = Origins = The Colonial Guard was founded as a result of the Budget Law of 1908, which provided for replacement of garrisons of the Marine Infantry, the Civil Guard and the Customs office by a single body that could assume all the functions of these three. The objective of the Colonial Guard was to protect Spaniards settled in the colony. At its creation, the Colonial Guard was composed of 430 European and indigenous personnel, which meant an increase of more than 12% in the number serving in the colony over the sum of the three bodies it replaced. The establishment of this first composition was set at 1 captain, 3 first lieutenants, 7 second lieutenants, 14 sergeants, 42 corporals and 1 cornet (all of them Europeans living in the colony and from the Civil Guard), 1 senior musician, also of European origin, as well as 12 cornets, 6 1st guards, 320 2nd guards, 6 1st musicians, 12 2nd musicians and 6 music learners (all of them indigenous). = 1920s = Through the 1920s, the Kingdom of Spain mounted military campaigns to subdue the indigenous Fang people in R√≠o Muni; by 1926, garrisons of the Colonial Guard were established throughout the enclave, and the whole colony was considered 'pacified' by 1929.Ner√≠n, Gustau. \\"La √∫ltima selva de Espa√±a:\\" antrop√≥fagos, misioneros y guardias civiles.

It merged in 1958 with the Langenthal-Melchnau Railway (Langenthal-Melchnau-Bahn, LMB) to form the Oberaargau-Jura Railway (Oberaargau-Jura-Bahnen, OJB), which then operated the then still 11 km-long, metre-gauge LJB line from Langenthal to Niederbipp. After further mergers, the railway line has been part of the Aare Seeland mobil (ASm) since 1999.  History The Langenthal-Jura Railway, which was based in Langenthal, opened its metre-gauge line, mostly located in the canton of Bern, from Langenthal via Niederbipp to Oensingen Schulhaus in the canton of Solothurn on 26 October 1907. It has been electrified at 1200 Volt DC since its opening. It operated class LJB CFe 4/4 railcars, among others. Langenthal was also the starting point of the metre-gauge Langenthal-Melchnau Railway, which opened on 6 October 1917. Its line to Melchnau began at Gaswerk station as a branch of the Langenthal‚ÄìJura-Bahn Railway. Cooperation was planned from the very beginning, so LMB not only selected the same electrification system, but also contracted all operations to the Langenthal-Jura Railway. With the opening of the Solothurn-Niederbipp Railway (Solothurn-Niederbipp-Bahn, SNB) on 9 January 1918, another connection to a metre-gauge railway was opened in Niederbipp. The SNB also sought contact with the LJB and entered into an operating contract, adopted the electrification system of the Langenthal-Jura Railway and ran individual trains to Oensingen. The Langenthal-Jura Railway connected with the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB) at the stations of Langenthal, Niederbipp and Oensingen SBB. On the Niederbipp‚ÄìOensingen section, it was in direct competition with the SBB and initially did well. Although it had a longer travel time, due to its poorer routing as a tramway, it offered a much better timetable than the SBB then operated for regional traffic. The route also allowed somewhat more connections from Oensingen and more services for the workforce of the companies in the Balsthal industrial district of Klus (including Von Roll) to be provided by the Langenthal-Jura Railway or from 1918 by the SNB; Klus itself has been served since 1899 by the standard gauge Oensingen‚ÄîBalsthal railway (Oensingen-Balsthal-Bahn, OeBB). As the SBB strongly expanded regional services on the Olten‚ÄìOensingen‚ÄìSolothurn line in the following years, passenger numbers collapsed; the SNB service to Solothurn was no longer able to compete with the SBB over the entire line and concentrated on serving the traffic between Solothurn and Niederbipp. Due to a lack of passengers, the LJB closed the most unprofitable section, the about one and a half kilometre-long Oensingen SBB‚ÄìOensingen Schulhaus section on 14 May 1928 and subsequently dismantled it. During the Second World War, the Langenthal-Jura Railway ran into financial hardship and asked the authorities for financial aid. The Canton of Berne essentially approved support for the almost two and a half kilometers long Niederbipp‚ÄìOensingen section. This had long since become rundown and unprofitable as a result of competition with the SBB, it had been relocated on state roads, it had fallen into a poor condition due to a lack of maintenance and it also had the political disadvantage of running to another canton. Thus on 9 May 1943 operations stopped and the tracks were dismantled immediately‚Äîiron and copper were sought-after raw materials in the war years and the company needed the additional income. Niederbipp became a terminal station for the LJB and the SNB, with a remnant of the line used as a siding. The 40-year cooperation between the Langenthal- Jura Railway and the LMB was eventually followed by a legal merger: on 1 January 1958 the Langenthal-Jura Railway and the LMB merged to form the Oberaargau-Jura Railway (Oberaargau-Jura-Bahnen, OJB). As a result, a new cooperation agreement was signed in 1959 with the SNB. With the contract, the LJB/OJB workshop in Langenthal also became a workshop for the SNB, which could abandon its own rolling stock maintenance. Since the timetable change in December 2012, the line to Oensingen station has been served again. The new line runs parallel to the SBB line between Niederbipp and Oensingen, and also has a station to serve the industrial area there. This line is not identical to the original line between Niederbipp and Oensingen.  Transporter wagon yards  The LJB opened the first transporter wagon yard for the transport of standard-gauge freight wagons on a metre-gauge line in Switzerland in Langenthal on 29 December 1909. The delivery points, which initially ended at Aarwangen, were extended to Bannwil on 7 March 1913. The LMB carried transporter wagons to Melchnau from its opening in 1917. Since the LMB's opening, deliveries to Melchnau have also been possible. The SNB, which was opened on 9 January 1918, included another transporter wagon yard, located in Niederbipp, which was also used by the LJB. It served delivery points as far as Bannwil from Niederbipp. The whole LJB line has been served from Niederbipp since 1943.

It is about an orphaned girl named Lovey Mary who runs away from her orphanage and is taken in by a woman named Mrs. Wiggs in an area of urbanized Kentucky known as the Cabbage Patch, an area which was inspired by Rice's personal experiences growing up in Kentucky. The novel is largely dramatic, however it features comic relief through jokes and sarcasm among those that Lovey Mary meets in the Cabbage Patch. While not as successful as Mrs. Wiggs of the Cabbage Patch, Rice's 1903 novel was well-enough received to be both dramatized and adapted into a film in 1904 and 1926 respectively.  Publication  The vast majority of the copies of Rice's novel were published in 1903, while there were also re-prints in years such as 1907. In 1903, the novel was published mainly in New York City by the Century Company, yet other publishing locations and companies such as The Montreal News Company in Montreal, William Briggs in Toronto, and Hodder & Stoughton in London published the novel as well.  Adaptations  In 1904, the novel was dramatized, along with Mrs. Wiggs of the Cabbage Patch, by Anne Crawford Flexner, and adapted into a Metro-Goldwyn- Mayer Pictures film in 1926, directed by King Baggot and starring Bessie Love as Lovey Mary. Only 6 of the 7 original reels of film for this adaptation survive until today, and these exist in the MGM preservation.

Together with the coinage of the Kushano-Sasanians, these coins are often described as \\"Indo-Sasanian\\". They form an important part of Sasanian coinage. Context Sasanian rulers from the reign of Shapur I claimed control of the Sindh area in their inscriptions. Shapur I installed his son Narseh as \\"King of the Sakas\\" in the areas of Eastern Iran as far as Sindh. Two inscriptions during the reign of Shapur II mention his control of the regions of Sindh, Sistan and Turan. Still, the exact term used by the Sasanian rulers in their inscription is Hndy, similar to Hindustan, which cannot be said for sure to mean \\"Sindh\\". Al-Tabari mentioned that Shapur II built cities in Sind and Sijistan. Characteristics of the coinage Location map of the Sasanian coinage of Sindh, circa 400 CE. In the area of Sindh, from Multan to the mouth of the Indus river, an important series of gold coins was issued on the model the coinage of Sasanian Empire rulers Shapur II down to Peroz I, that is covering approximately the period from 325 to 480 CE. These coins have been recovered from the areas of Sindh, Baluchistan and Kutch. The coins are made of gold only, have a weight of around 7.20 grams, making them similar to the traditional \\"heavy\\" Sasanian dinars. The number of coins so far discovered suggests a significant volume of coinage, equivalent to about half of the more famous Kushano-Sassanian coinage. However, the time span of 150 years covered by the Sindh coins is much longer than the roughly 50 years time span of the Kushano-Sasanians, suggested about 1/6th of the Kushano-Sasanian output per time unit. The coins are not the usual Sasanian imperial type, and the legend around the portrait tends to be degraded Middle Persian in the Pahlavi script, but they have the Brahmi script character ≈örƒ´ (14px \\"Lord\\") in front of the portrait of the King. The coins suggest some sort of Sasanian control of Sind during the 5th century, a recognition of Sasanian overlordship, but the precise extent of the Sasanian presence or influence is unknown. The facts that these coins do not use the traditional Sasanian imperial titulature, that they do not use the Sasanian weight standards, and that the standard Sasanian silver monetary standard was not in circulation in the region, all suggest that the Sasanians were actually not ruling directly in Sindh. Still, such vast influence from the Arabic peninsula to the Sindh and the Kushan realm probably provided the Sasanians with a remarkable position in terms of maritime trade, giving them a sort of trade monopoly. The expansion of the Sasanians in northwestern India, which put an end to the remnants of Kushan rule, may also have been done at the expense of the Western Satraps and the Satavahanas. =Sasanian rulers (325-480 CE)= Sindh coinage of Sasanian Empire rulers from Shapur II down to Peroz I are known, covering approximately the period from 325 to 480 CE. The last coins of the series, those copied on Peroz I (r. 459-484), deviate from the series as they introduce a Brahmi legend, often with the title \\"Rana Datasatya\\". Paradoxically, several of the Sasanians kings have more dinar gold coins known from the Sindh mints than from the regular Sasanian mints: this is the case of Shapur III and Bahram V, both of whom only have about five regular Sasanian dinar gold coins known, compared to nine and thirteen respectively for the Sindh mints as of 2016. To explain this, R.C. Senior has suggested that Shapur III, who had a very troubled reign and suffered defeats at the hand of the Kushans, had been unable to issue gold coinage and had to take refuge in Sindh where he was able to strike his beautiful coins, some with the Sri symbol, and some without.

Some later imitations of these coins after 480 CE may have been made by the Hephthalites, who added a Hunnic tamgha to the design, after they took over the northwestern Indian provinces. The quality of the coins also becomes very much degraded by that time, and the actual gold content becomes quite low.

Typically, the bust of the king on the obverse is highly simplified and geometric, and the design of the fire altar, with or without the two attendants, appears as a geometrical motif on the reverse of this type of coinage.\\"The Indo-Sassanian coins, also termed as Gadahiya and circulated from 600 to 1200 A.D., are found in good numbers from Ahmadahad, Banaskantha, Bhavanagar, Junagarh, Kaira, Kutch, Mehsana, of Gujarat.\\" in File:Gujuras of Sindh Circa AD 570-712.jpgCoin of the Chavada dynasty, circa 570-712 CE.

Elio Perlman is portrayed by Timoth√©e Chalamet in the 2017 adaptation of the same name. Directed by Luca Guadagnino and written by James Ivory, the film follows Elio Perlman, a 17-year-old as he spends the summer of 1983 with his family in their 17th-century villa in Lombardy, Italy. He soon meets Oliver, a doctoral student who's working as an intern for Elio's father, and the two become infatuated with each other over the course of the summer. For his portrayal, Chalamet received nominations for an Academy Award, a BAFTA Award, a Golden Globe Award, a Screen Actors Guild Award, and a Critics' Choice Award, all for Best Actor. He also won numerous critics awards, namely New York Film Critics Circle Award, Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award and London Film Critics' Circle Award. Characterization Elio Perlman is a 17-year-old Jewish-Italian boy. He spends a great deal of time playing piano, learning classical pieces as well as composing his own. He is the protagonist of the coming-of-age story, a teenager on the brink of manhood, experiencing love for the first time. The son of Jewish scholars, Elio is trilingual, well- read, and a talented musician. He spends his summers working on classical scores, playing the guitar and piano, reading and swimming with friends. He is initially attracted to and in a sexual relationship with Marzia. When he meets Oliver, his attraction eclipses his other interests. During Oliver's stay in his family's house, Elio tries to spend as much time as possible in his presence. Although he understands he's attracted to Oliver, it takes time for Elio to decide if he wants anything to happen between them. Relationships =Marzia= Marzia is Elio's Italian friend with whom Elio has a casual sexual relationship. After Elio's romance with Oliver begins, Marzia is confused by Elio's avoidance of her and is hurt by his indifference. After Oliver returns to America, Marzia realizes that Elio has been in love with Oliver all along, she tells him that she is not upset and the two agree to stay friends. =Oliver= Oliver is a 24-year-old Jewish-American graduate student who is writing and researching with Elio's father in Italy. While he is similarly intellectual and thoughtful, he is more sociable than Elio, often participating in social drinking, playing games, flirting with women. Unlike Elio, he did not have an accepting upbringing, and therefore experiences more shame and ambivalence about his homosexual feelings. Soon enough, Elio feels tortured by the idea that his attraction might slip by unnoticed, so he tells Oliver how he feels. When he and Oliver finally kiss, he isn't sure what to make of their connection. Similarly, he feels confused after they have sex, ultimately experiencing a sense of shame even though he's glad to have acted on his feelings. In the beginning of their acquaintanceship, Oliver and Elio do not quite know what to think of one another, or how to deal with their mutual attraction. In the early days of their courtship, they find it easiest to talk about intellectual and artistic matters. Oliver asks Elio about the music he is playing, lightly challenging his claims about the compositions. He asks Elio what he thinks of a sentence from his academic work, and they engage in light banter. =Sami Perlman= Sami Perlman is an archaeology professor and Elio's father. He invites grad student Oliver to live with his family in Italy over the summer. He is passionate and warm-hearted, and encouraging of his son's friendship and eventual affair with Oliver. Towards the end of the film and novel, he expresses his approval for Elio and Oliver's relationship, suggesting that the love they share is something very special, and urging Elio to grow rather than to repress his feelings about their relationship. Casting In 2015, it was reported that Shia LaBeouf and Greta Scacchi were set to be cast in a film adaptation of the novel. In September 2016, Ivory had confirmed that the duo were no longer involved in the project. Ivory said he got along with LaBeouf, who had read for the film in New York City, but the production company later felt the actor was unsuitable after the public and media attention regarding his \\"various troubles\\". Ivory thought Scacchi and LeBeouf read well together and could have made it into the film, but the company disagreed. In 2013, Chalamet was introduced to Guadagnino by Brian Swardstrom ‚Äì husband of producer Peter Spears ‚Äì who immediately felt the actor had \\"the ambition, the intelligence, the sensitivity, the naivety, and the artistry\\" that was required in order to play Elio. Chalamet had already read Aciman's novel prior to being cast and described it as \\"a window into a young person\\". His character, 17-year-old Elio, is fluent in three languages: English, French and Italian. Upon his arrival in Italy, Chalamet‚Äîwho already spoke French fluently and had played piano and guitar for years‚Äîprepared for his role with a schedule of daily lessons in Italian, gym workouts three times a week, and by working with composer Roberto Solci. Reception The Economist described the tension \\"between pain and pleasure\\" in the film and praised Chalamet portrayal of Elio, saying that he \\"evokes so many shades of humanity, portraying a path of youthful self-discovery that is more raw, unhinged, and ultimately honest than many actors could manage\\". For Vanity Fair, Richard Lawson wrote that \\"Chalamet has the bearing of a natural; he‚Äôs deeply committed to his character\\" and that he also manages to \\"infuse Elio with something of himself, too, as the best movie stars do\\". He also writes that \\"Chalamet seems to know that he‚Äôs got an innate charm, a boyish grace, and he uses that to striking effect. Elio, soulful and impetuous and a little bratty, is a kid you‚Äôve known, a kid you wanted to be, a kid you care and root for\\", before calling his portrayal of Elio \\"a mature and thoughtful performance, and it augurs great things for Chalamet going forward\\". =Performance recognition= At the age of 22, Chalamet became the youngest Best Actor nominee since 1939, in addition to nominations at BAFTA, the Golden Globes, the Screen Actors Guild, and a Critics' Choice Awards for Best Actor. At the 33rd Independent Spirit Awards, Chalamet won the Best Male Lead Award, other accolades he won included; The National Board of Review, the Gotham Independent Film Awards and the Hollywood Film Awards for Breakout Actor, respectively. IndieWire, in a series of articles regarding the best of film in the 2010s, named Chalamet's portrayal of Elio as the 39th best film performance of the 2010s.

The April conference includes annual statistical and financial audit reports not included in the October meeting. Both conferences are identified by the number of years since the church was founded in April 1830; thus, the April 2016 meeting was the 186th Annual General Conference, and the October 2016 meeting was the 186th Semiannual General Conference. Since October 1848,After the death of Joseph Smith, general conferences were held under the direction of Brigham Young in October 1844 (Nauvoo, Illinois); April 1845 (Nauvoo); October 1845 (Nauvoo); December 1847 (Kanesville, Iowa); and April 1848 (Kanesville). For the dates and locations of conferences prior to Smith's death, see General conference (Latter Day Saints). all of the conferences have been held in Salt Lake City, Utah, with the exception of the April 1877 conference, which was held in St. George, Utah. Conferences were held in a bowery in Salt Lake City from 1848 to 1852, in the Old Salt Lake Tabernacle from 1852 to 1867, in the Salt Lake Tabernacle from October 1867 to April 2000, and in the Conference Center since that time. Historically, sessions were held over three days, with the annual conference always including April 6, the anniversary of the church's organization. This made conference participation difficult for those with work and school commitments when April 6 fell on a weekday. In April 1977, during Spencer W. Kimball's presidency, changes were made to reduce the conference to the first Saturday and Sunday of April and October. As of October 2018, the conference consists of four general sessions, along with either a priesthood session (held in April) or a women's session (held in October) which occurs on Saturday evening. The general sessions commence at 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. MT on Saturday and Sunday, with the priesthood or women's sessions beginning at 6 p.m. on Saturday evening. The priesthood session held in April is for men and boys (12 years and older) who hold the church's priesthood. The women's session held in October is for those eight years and older. Each of the general sessions lasts about two hours, with the evening session typically lasting approximately 90 minutes. Historically, beginning in 1994, a women's general meeting was held on Saturday a week prior to the general sessions of the October conference, with a general meeting for young women held at a similar time before the April conference. In November 2013, church leadership announced that beginning in 2014 these meetings for women would be replaced by a semiannual General Women's Meeting for those eight years of age and older. In October 2014, the First Presidency announced that it \\"has decided that the General Women's Meeting will be designated as the General Women's Session of general conference\\". In October 2017, the First Presidency announced that, beginning in April 2018, the Priesthood Session will occur during the April conference, while the General Women's Session would be held during October's conference. These sessions will occur during the Saturday evening time previously used for the Priesthood Session. Tickets to the conference are free of charge and church members can obtain them either from local leaders or by writing to church headquarters. Due to demand, the church often restricts the number of separate session tickets issued to attendees (meaning that it is difficult or impossible for most people to acquire tickets to multiple sessions for the same conference weekend). Standby tickets are also available, as frequently many ticket holders are not able to attend. The proceedings of a general conference are traditionally been conducted in English, although for a short time, beginning in October 2014, speakers delivering sermons had the option of speaking in their native language. The proceedings are translated and broadcast in over 90 different languages worldwide. =Adjustments in 2020= In October 2019, church president Russell M. Nelson announced that the following April's general conference would be \\"unlike any other\\" and would celebrate the bicentennial of events that served as \\"the very foundation of the restoration\\", and encouraged church members to prepare for the occasion.Four Ways to Get Ready for April 2020, Ensign, November 2019, pg. 125.

Retrieved 28 September 2020. Organization Crowd on Temple Square in between sessions of conference. A member of the church's First Presidency normally conducts each Conference session, with the President of the Church presiding. (On occasions in the past, when part or all of the First Presidency have been absent, the First Presidency designates someone to conduct the conference, typically the most senior apostle not in the First Presidency.) The conducting official introduces the various speakers, which over the course of the sessions will generally include all members of the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and a selection of other leaders in the church. Almost every general authority of the church is present, though outside the First Presidency and Twelve only a few speak. Non-general authority speakers may include male and female officers of auxiliary organizations. Most area seventies travel to Utah to attend at least one general conference per year. During one general session (usually Saturday afternoon), all the general authorities and general officers of the church are presented for the formal sustaining vote by the membership, and it is usually at this time that any changes among the general church leadership are announced. Normally, the members of the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve are mentioned by name; those in other positions are mentioned by name only if they are released from a previous position or called to a new one. The person conducting asks all of those who are in favor of sustaining the current leadership or the calling of a new leader to raise their hand in a \\"vote.\\" He then asks that any who are opposed raise their hand. Dissenting votes are rare and the customary declaration at the end of the voting is that the voting has been unanimous. At the first General Conference after the death of a church president and the calling of his successor, the session at which the sustaining vote takes place is called a solemn assembly. At a solemn assembly, groups of Latter-day Saints are asked to stand in succession and sustain the new president of the church. Typically, the order is: First Presidency, the Quorum of the Twelve, the Quorums of Seventy, Melchizedek priesthood holders, Aaronic priesthood holders, Relief Society members, members of the Young Women organization, and then all members together. Then the names of all other general authorities are read, and a sustaining and opposing vote is called for. Frequently, significant announcements are made at a General Conference, which may include building sites for new temples or the institution of new policies or programs. Music Music is an important part of the Conference in setting the appropriate spiritual mood. The Tabernacle Choir at Temple Square, formerly known as the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, accompanied by tabernacle organists, generally provides the majority of the music, with the exception of the Saturday afternoon, priesthood sessions, and general women's sessions. At the Saturday afternoon session and the priesthood session guest ensembles include regional choirs, institute choirs, an MTC choir, and the BYU Choirs. The hymns are usually selected from the normal repertoire of LDS hymns and their various arrangements, with an occasional piece from traditional sacred choral repertoire. Usually, the congregation is invited to stand and join in with one hymn halfway through each session. Very rarely, soloist artists will perform for Conferences, The last performer to do so, Liriel Domiciano, did so alongside the Tabernacle Choir at Temple Square. Sermons Members of the church regard and sustain the president of the church, the counselors in the First Presidency, and members of the Quorum of Twelve Apostles as \\"prophets, seers, and revelators\\", and are counseled to pay close attention to what they teach throughout the year. However, the sermons given at general conference are held in particularly high esteem and they are considered the will of God to the church members at the current time. The sermons (called \\"talks\\") are published in the Ensign, an official church English-language magazine, the month following a General Conference. They are also translated and printed in the Liahona, the church's international version of the Ensign, which is published in multiple languages. Church members are encouraged to read and study the talks, discuss them at home and at church, and quote from them while giving lessons and sermons at church. A sample of the topics of general conference discourses includes: *Our Good Shepherd (Renlund, April 2017) *Unity (Eyring, October 2008) *Forgiveness (Faust, April 2007; Hinckley, October 2005) *Natural disasters and preparedness (Hinckley, October 2005) *Faith (Sorensen, April 2005) *The dangers of pornography (Oaks, April 2005; Hinckley, October 2004) *The first vision of Joseph Smith (Uchtdorf, April 2005) *Acquiring a testimony of Jesus (McMullin, April 2004) *Fatherhood (Perry, April 2004) *The Atonement of Jesus (Hafen, April 2004) *Fasting (Pratt, October 2004) *Repentance (Nelson, April 2007; Uchtdorf, April 2007; Oaks, October 2003) *Eternal life through Jesus (Madsen, April 2002) *Tithing (Tingey, April 2002) *Hope in the Atonement of Jesus (Faust, October 2001) *The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ (Packer, October 2001) Broadcasting The events of the conferences are televised both locally and internationally through various platforms to increase their exposure and availability. Sessions are broadcast on screens in various buildings on Temple Square, including the Tabernacle, Assembly Hall and the Joseph Smith Memorial Building. The conference sessions are also broadcast via satellite to church meetinghouses throughout the world, either simultaneously or time delayed to accommodate differing time zones and languages. The conferences have also aired through webcasts, and since 2010, the complete sermons have been posted on the church's Mormon Messages YouTube channel. The sessions are translated and broadcast in over 100 different languages worldwide. General Conference was first broadcast on television in October 1949. General Conference was first interpreted in multiple languages in 1961 (Dutch, German, Samoan, and Spanish). Live coverage of the conferences are also shown on local television and radio stations with ties to the LDS Church. These include Utah's NBC affiliate KSL-TV and ABC News Radio affiliate KSL (AM)/FM (owned by Bonneville International, a commercial broadcasting arm of the church), KBYU-FM and KBYU- TV (public broadcasters owned by Brigham Young University), Latter-day Saints Channel (the church-owned radio network, which also has additional HD Radio coverage in Bonneville markets), KSRR 1400 K-Star, KQMB Star 96.7, KMGR 99.1 Classy FM, BYU Television (national cable and satellite, and over KBYU-DT2), and BYU Radio.

In additional to his priestly duties, he was a journalist and a patron of the arts; involved in collecting, conservation and restoration.  Biography  His great-grandfather was , a Portuguese nobleman who was a close friend and unofficial advisor to the Empress Maria Theresa. He was the third son of , who was originally devoted to a military career, but resigned to join the landed gentry. From 1834 to 1838, he studied philosophy, then spent a year studying theology at Palack√Ω University in Olomouc. From 1841 to 1843, he continued his studies in Brno. In 1847, he renounced his inheritance in favor of his younger brother, Augustus (1818-1872). During these years, from 1835 to 1838, he also took courses in landscape painting from Professor Anton√≠n M√°nes at the Academy of Fine Arts, Prague and became acquainted with Josef M√°nes, who was related to one of his mother's friends. While in Brno, he made friends with Franti≈°ek Su≈°il, also a Catholic priest, who was making a collection of Moravian folk music. = Art collector & patron = As a result of these cultural influences, he devoted himself to promoting the local arts, making significant donations to the collection of the Brno Museum. He made an especially large donation in 1859, pursuant to his departure to Northern Italy, where he had volunteered to serve as a chaplain in the Austrian military hospitals during the Italian War. The donations included coins, engravings and old prints as well as paintings. He was an active participant in the Czech and Moravian Revival Society, as well as several educational and patriotic organizations, and was a major supporter of , a scientific society; now part of the Czech Academy of Sciences, engaged primarily in researching Moravian history.

The main purpose of the bridge was holding the floating wood. It served its function until the middle of the last century. The structure is located next to road I / 39 in the Volary direction. The structure was declared a Czech cultural monument in 1958.  History  The covered wooden footbridge was built in 1870 and was used for the retention, counting, rectification and discharge of timber floating down the Vltava river from the Bohemian Forest, namely from the Boubin area, to the paper mills in Louƒçovice and Vƒõt≈ôn√≠. The Czech name Rechle comes from the German word \\"der Rechen\\" which means \\"rake\\". And that describes what the function of the bridge used to be.There were openings in the floor of the bridge where beams were inserted into the river, and they were used similar to rakes for retaining the wood during low water. The logs were released when water level has risen again. The bridge carried on this function until the Lipno dam was built in 1959 an timber was not flown down the river anymore. An overall repair of the bridge was carried out in 1985 on the initiative of the Lenora municipality. Although it survived the 2002 floods unscathed, it had to be renovated in 2014. More than three million crowns were raised from the European Union for the repair.  Description  The wooden structure is 25 meters long and 1.8 meters wide. The bridge deck lies on three stone pillars at a height of about 3 meters above the water . The building is covered with a hipped roof and is accessed from the south side by wooden stairs.  Recognition  There are nineteen covered wooden bridges in the Czech Republic, of which only two were used when floating wood - one is in Lenora and the other is in ƒåesk√Ω Krumlov. The Lenora bridge is an authentically preserved example of a technical structure, which proves the constructional qualities of the 19th century builders, it was declared a cultural monument in 1958. The footbridge uniqueness was recognized by the Czech National Bank when it issued a commemorative 5000 CZK gold coin in 2013 depicting the \\"Rechle\\".

History  The locomotives were built for the T√°bor to Bechynƒõ and Rybn√≠k to Lipno railways, both of which were electrified with non standard 1.5kV DC electrification. The locomotives were delivered to ƒåSD during early 1957. After approval testing had been carried out, and modifications made, the locomotives entered service in July 1957. They were then used mostly on freight services until 1973, when the new ƒåSD E 426.0 class locomotives were delivered, cascading the locomotives onto passenger work. The locomotives started to be withdrawn in 1997, with locomotive 4 being scrapped in 1998, and locomotive 2 being used as a source of spare parts. The last 100 in regular service was locomotive 3, withdrawn in 2002. = Preservation = Since withdrawal, locomotive 1 and 3 have been kept operational by ƒåD, and are used occasionally on special journeys, based at T√°bor.

Creative work  The piano EP is named after \\"ME\\", the purpose is return to the truest self, to explore the heart from the perspective of the first person. All the musical works included in the EP are based on the mentality of some of the things that Lee experienced in the past. Lee has been interested in psychology for the past two years, he began to explore and explore his heart through the books of psychologist Carl Gustav Jung. By constantly digging into your heart, Lee associates with the theme of \\"ME\\". When everyone starts to face themselves, the feedback is beautiful, more love and empathy. It is not easy to criticize yourself and criticize others when you decide. The birth of the new EP is the process of Lee's continuous exploration and understanding of himself.

Life  Grave of Prof. Rolf Reuter on the Inner Plauenschen Cemetery in Dresden Reuter was born as son of the composer in Leipzig. After studying music at the Hochschule f√ºr Musik Carl Maria von Weber Dresden he began his career in 1951 as Kapellmeister at the theatre in Eisenach. In 1956 he moved to Meiningen, from there Reuter went to Oper Leipzig as general music director in 1961. From 1978 to 1980 he was chief conductor of the Deutsches Nationaltheater und Staatskapelle Weimar. From 1981 Reuter was General music director of the Komische Oper Berlin, where he remained until 1993. His numerous guest performances and master classes have taken him around the world, including Paris, London, Tokyo, Beijing, Houston and Buenos Aires, as well as Israel, Italy, France, Spain, the former Soviet Union, Bulgaria, etc. His conducting, partly in collaboration with Harry Kupfer, for example the Mozart cycle, Wagner's Die Meistersinger von N√ºrnberg, Boris Godunov, and the world premiere of Siegfried Matthus' opera Judith, significantly shaped the artistic profile of the Komische Oper Berlin. Among the most important artists with whom he performed are David Oistrach, Jessye Norman, David Geringas, Alfredo Kraus, Anna Tomowa-Sintow, Christa Ludwig, Peter Seiffert, Kiri Te Kanawa, Theo Adam and many more. Since 1966 Reuter had also been director of conducting at the University of Music and Theatre Leipzig in addition to his conducting activities. He was president of the Hans Pfitzner Society and honorary professor at the Hochschule f√ºr Musik \\"Hanns Eisler\\" in Berlin. World-famous conductors emerged from his teaching, for example Vladimir Jurowski, Walter Taieb, Thomaskantor Georg Christoph Biller, Claus Peter Flor as well as Shi-Yeon Sung. Reuter died in Berlin at age 80. His grave is located at the in Dresden. The violist Sophia Reuter is his daughter.  Honours and Critic  Reuter was an honorary member of the Komische Oper Berlin and the Leipziger Opera. In 2000 he was awarded the Bundesverdienstkreuz. He was awarded the National Prize and the Patriotic Order of Merit of the GDR as well as the Franz Liszt Prize of the Republic of Hungary. Shortly before his death the conductor got into public criticism, because he opened on 13 May 2006 together with a \\"Singleiterkurs\\" of the and held on this occasion two lectures with the titles Das deutsche Volkslied als Mutterboden der Hochkultur (The German folk song as the breeding ground of high culture) and Anton Bruckner und die deutsche Volksseele (Anton Bruckner and the German People's Soul) in front of the neo-fascist organization.report of the circle of friends Ulrich von Hutten in the magazine Huttenbriefe, in the internet as PDF-file, issue 02/2006 as downloaded at www.huttenbriefe.com Reuter did not deny having given these lectures, nor the personal contact to this organization. In response to strong public pressure and numerous reports in the German press, he expressly dissociated himself from the ideas of these and all other right-wing and left-wing radical organizations.Website of the House of Representatives of Berlin and the daily newspapers Die Welt, S√ºddeutsche Zeitung, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Neues Deutschland, Frankfurter Rundschau], Leipziger Volkszeitung in print editions as well as press agency reports DPA, Reuters and AFP from 11. - 18 September 2007 The Bundespr√§sidialamt did not grant a demand by the member of the Abgeordnetenhaus of Berlin, the SPD politician Tom Schreiber, to deprive the conductor of the Federal Cross of Merit awarded in 2000.Obituary Prominent pupils, such as Vladimir Jurowski in the Leipziger Volkszeitung, stressed that his teaching had taken place in a humanist spirit. Reuters last students at Hochschule f√ºr Musik \\"Hanns Eisler\\" Berlin joined a public statement that his teaching was cosmopolitan, tolerant and humane.

Working at Vienna theatres for decades, he wrote the libretto for Schubert's opera Fierrabras.  Biography  Kupelwieser was born in Vienna, the son of Johann Kupelwieser (1760‚Äì1813), a tinware manufacturer with factories in Markt Piesting, Guntramsdorf and Vienna. From 1801 to 1802, Joseph attended the Akademisches Gymnasium and the Erziehungsinstitut (a boarding school) operated by Gaetano Giannatasio del Rio (1764‚Äì1828). He also studied briefly at the K.k. Akademie f√ºr Orientalische Sprachen, before becoming a soldier. He ran the factory of his father, which went bankrupt in 1822. In 1812, he married Anna N√∂del, and they had at least five children. He was a member of the Unsinnsgesellschaft (Nonsense Society) from 1817, a group of painters, actors and writers who participated in revelries ostensibly devoted to the god \\"Insanius\\" (Unsinn).Die Unsinnsgesellschaft: Franz Schubert, Leopold Kupelwieser und ihr Freundeskreis (review) Project MUSE. From 1823, he also belonged to a literary society Ludlamsh√∂hle, named after a play by Adam Oehlenschl√§ger. Although apparently a benign social club, it was banned in 1826 for \\"endangering the state\\". From 1821, Kupelwieser worked for two years as the dramaturge at the Vienna Court Opera, where he began his activities as a translator, poet and librettist. He became involved in an affair with the actress Emilie Neumann. The play Rosamunde by Helmina von Ch√©zy was apparently written for her at his request. Eventually, his wife left him and took their children. He also lost his job but had a successful career with engagements in Graz, to where he followed Neumann, and then from 1825 in Pressburg (today Bratislava). He moved to Agram (today Zagreb) in 1829, where he served as director for two months. From 1836 to 1862, he once again worked as a dramaturge, now at the Theater in der Josefstadt. His second wife was Elise Sedelmeyer. Scene from a performance of Schubert's Fierrabras at the Salzburg Festival in 2014 His best-known work is the libretto for the opera Fierrabras, by Franz Schubert, whom he had befriended at the Nonsense Society. Although written and approved by the censors in 1823, it was not performed at the court theatre then. Schubert blamed the librettist, writing in a letter to Leopold Kupelwieser that the opera written by his brother \\"has been declared to be unusable, and in consequence, there has been no demand for my music\\". A concert version was performed in 1835, and a staged version finally played in 1897. Kupelwieser also wrote the libretto for Die M√ºllerin von Burgos, a \\"com√©die en vaudevilles\\" by Franz von Supp√©, in addition to translating and editing librettos for operas, mostly from French to German for performances in Vienna, including Boieldieu's Les voitures vers√©es, Meyerbeer's Il crociato in Egitto, Rossini's Le si√®ge de Corinthe and Matilde di Shabran, Donizetti's Les martyrs and Maria di Rohan, Michael William Balfe's The Bohemian Girl, and Ferdinand H√©rold's Zampa. Kupelwieser died in Rudolfsheim, now part of Vienna. Leopold Kupelwieser, his younger brother, was a well-known painter.

The Order is also responsible for the elaboration of specific technical and deontological norms and has an autonomous disciplinary regime by imperative of tutelage, in the pursue of public interest.  General Principles  The establishment of professional Order is exceptional and can only take place when its purpose is to safeguard a public interest of particular importance that the State cannot directly ensure. Its creation must be adequate, necessary and proportionate to regulate the legal property to be protected, and to respect to professions that should be subject to it. All Orders are legal persons governed by public law and each regulated profession can only correspond to one Order. Nevertheless, the same Order may represent more than one profession, provided that they all have a common technical or scientific basis.  Incorporation of an Order  Orders are incorporated by law, therefore incorporation of an Order starts with a bill tabled by the Assembly of the Republic and approved by the President of the Republic. The creation of new Order is always preceded by an independent study on its need to achieve the public interest and their impact on the regulation of the profession. The study also involves the hearing of the existing professional associations and a public consultation.  Denomination  Under the law, the term Order (in Portuguese: Ordem) is to be used only when the exercise of the regulated professions depends on the prior attainment of a bachelor's degree or higher. Should the profession depend on the attainment of any other degree, the association is to be called a Chamber (in Portuguese: C√¢mara).  Colleges, Mace-Bearers and Symbols  Orders can be internally subdivided into specialized colleges (in Portuguese: Col√©gios das Especialidades), which group different areas of expertise within the Profession. For example, the Order of Biologist has four specialized colleges that group four major fields: the College of Environment, the College of Biotechnology, the College of Education, and the College of Human Biology and Health. The President of an Order has the title of Mace-Bearer (in Portuguese: Baston√°rio). In accordance to Portuguese Law, Orders are entitles to their symbols, chains of office and flags. Under these prerogatives, most Orders, namely the oldest ones have adopted as their symbols, coat or arms, such is the case of the: Order of the Medical Doctors, the Order of the Engineers, the Order of the Engineering Technicians, the Order of the Economists and the Order of the Veterinarians. The Order of the Nurses had adopted and heraldic badge, while the remaining Orders have adopted logos.  Legal Framework  The Constitution of the Portuguese Republic, under Article 267 (4), establishes that Orders can only be incorporated to satisfy specific needs and that they cannot perform the functions of trade unions associations. Furthermore, their internal organization must be based on respect of the rights of its members and the democratic formation of their organs.  Existing Orders  *Order of the Pharmacists (founded in 1835 as the Pharmaceutical Lusitanian Society and legally succeed by incorporation as Order in 1972) * Order of the Lawyers (incorporated in 1926) * Order of the Engineers (incorporated in 1935) * Order of the Physicians (incorporated in 1938) *Order of the Customs Agents (incorporated first as a Chamber in 1945 and then as Order in 2015) *Order of the Veterinarians (incorporated in 1991) *Order of the Architects (incorporated in 1998) * Order of the Biologists (incorporated in 1998) *Order of the Economists (incorporated in 1998) *Order of the Nurses (incorporated in 1998) *Order of the Dentists (incorporated in 1998) *Order of the Chartered Accountants (incorporated in 1999) *Order of the Engineering Technicians (incorporated in 1999) *Order of the Statutory Auditors (incorporated in 1999) *Order of the Solicitors and Enforcement Agents (incorporated first as a Chamber in 2003 and then as Order in 2015) *Order of the Notaries (incorporated in 2004) *Order of the Nutritionists (incorporated in 2011) *Order of the Psychologists (incorporated in 2008) *Order of the Social Workers (incorporated in 2019)  Bibliography  * COSTA, Carlos Filipe Fernandes de Andrade. ¬´Ordens profissionais : Associa√ß√µes de empresas (o caso particular da ordem dos advogados)¬ª in E-publica, vol. 2, n.¬∫ 1, mar√ßo de 2015, pp. 69‚Äì98.

The festival, managed with the help of local volunteers, features print exhibitions, workshops, talks and panel discussions, a mixed-media residency, slideshow nights, portfolio reviews and an arts and education programme. It distinguished itself by being an open air festival, anchored in the local communities of Patan and Kathmandu, and using public spaces such as courtyards, squares, alleys and drinking fountains to exhibit photographic bodies of work and to present slideshows. At each festival, Photo Kathmandu recognises individuals who have helped the growth of Nepali photography with an Award for Excellence.  History  The first edition of Photo Kathmandu followed the April 2015 Nepal earthquake, during the 2015 Nepal blockade, in an effort to shift international attention back to Nepal. The festival was held in the historical city of Patan. The second edition of Photo Kathmandu took place in 2016, before going biennial. The 2018 third edition saw the creation of the South Asia Incubator 1, a programme where young and up-and-coming photography practitioners from South Asia could meet and discuss their work with each other and various mentors. The festival has exhibited works from renowned artists such as Philip Blenkinsop, Amar Kanwar, Sohrab Hura Kevin Bubriski, Munem Wasif, and Tasneem Alsultan. =Themes =  2015: Time  Following the 2015 earthquakes, the first edition of Photo Kathmandu looked at Nepal's past, present and future.  2016: Resilience  Twenty years after the end of the Nepalese Civil War, the 2016 edition focused on stories of resilience from across South Asia, showcasing and celebrating how people face and overcome hardship. A guest curator, Tanvi Mishra, co-curated the festival's exhibitions.  2018: Gender, patriarchy, power, identity and sexuality  The 2018 edition was inaugurated by Tham Maya Thapa, Minister for Women, Children and Senior Citizens.

Life and career Augustus Tennant was born in Simla in British India and educated at Rugby School in England, where he played in the First XI in 1859 and 1860. He arrived in New Zealand in the early 1860s and began working for the Canterbury Province government. He was appointed as Commissioner‚Äôs Clerk of the West Canterbury goldfields in Hokitika in 1865. When the County of Westland was formed he held a position in the County Treasury in Hokitika, and on the formation of Westland Province he held a position in the Superintendent‚Äôs Office. When the provinces were abolished in 1873 he worked for the national government in the stamp office, still in Hokitika. His wife died in 1872, after which \\"[b]ad times swept over him and he commenced to drift\\". In 1874 he was convicted of assault. In 1882 he was arrested on a charge of embezzling from the Stamp Office, convicted and sentenced in March 1883 to nine months' labour. He died of Bright's disease, aggravated by other ailments, in Westland Hospital in Hokitika on 28 November 1892. Cricket career Tennant played several matches for Canterbury in the 1860s as a batsman and wicket-keeper. He was Canterbury's best batsman when George Parr's English team visited in 1863-64. When Parr's XI dismissed the Canterbury XXII for 30 and 105, Tennant made 28, the highest score on either side, in the second innings. After the early finish of that match, a second match was played between two elevens combining the English and Canterbury players, and Tennant was the highest scorer in that match too, with 21 and 33. He was less successful with the bat in his first two first-class matches for Canterbury, but in his last match, in 1865-66, he again made the highest score on either side with 24 in Canterbury's second innings. In 1864-65 his wicket- keeping drew praise from the Lyttelton Times, which described it after the match against Otago as one of \\"the most noticeable features in the whole game\\" and as a model for the young cricketer. He retained his involvement with cricket after he transferred to Hokitika, and at the time of his death he was the secretary of the Hokitika Cricket Club.

Biography =Career= Peu Sousa was born in Salvador, Bahia on July 22, 1977, and was the stepson of Novos Baianos member Luiz Galv√£o. He began his career in 1995 with the band Dois Sapos e Meio, which lasted until 1999, and later served as a live musician during performances of Carlinhos Brown and his stepfather. In 2003 he was invited by singer Pitty to be part of her live band; he stayed for one year, during which he was the guitarist of her debut Admir√°vel Chip Novo and co-wrote the track \\"D√©j√†-Vu\\" off her 2005 album Anacr√¥nico. In 2005 he formed the band Tr√™mula, which was nominated for a MTV Video Music Brazil award. His final music project was the short-lived Nove Mil Anjos, alongside Junior Lima, Champignon and Per√≠ Carpigiani. =Suicide= Sousa began to struggle with depression during his final years. On May 5, 2013, after a discussion with his wife, she left their house in Itapo√£ with their two children; after returning, she found Sousa hanging from their bedroom ceiling with a belt around his neck. The police ruled his death as a suicide. Sousa's brother Lahiri Galv√£o, however, claimed on an interview that he found \\"very unlikely\\" that he was driven to suicide merely because of the argument with his wife, and his former Nove Mil Anjos bandmate Champignon (who himself committed suicide four months after Sousa) stated that \\"for a while, Peu had lost his faith in life\\". Junior Lima and Pitty later made statements on his death and gave their condolences.

She served as a municipal councillor of the Mogalakwena Local Municipality prior to her appointment to provincial legislature. Maritz was a member of the Democratic Alliance (DA) until 2015, when she resigned from the party after allegations of racism. The DA soon laid criminal charges regarding racism against her in 2019. Political career Maritz was a ward councillor of the Mogalakwena Local Municipality and a member of the DA until 2015, when the party accused her of racism. She denied these allegations, though the party's Provincial Disciplinary committee continued with their investigation of her breaching internal party rules. She resigned from the party in September 2015 amid the investigation taking place. She subsequently joined the FF+. Her resignation as a party member of the DA caused her seat in the municipal council to become vacant. A municipal by-election was held in her ward on 18 November 2015, which Maritz contested as the FF+ candidate. The DA won the ward. Maritz became a PR councillor in the Mogalakwena Local Municipality following the 2016 municipal election, as the FF+ had won one seat on the municipal council. She soon became the provincial leader of the party and was the party's premier candidate for the 2019 general election. She was elected to the Limpopo Provincial Legislature and became the party's sole representative. Controversies On 25 September 2019, the DA announced that it would be laying criminal charges of racism against Maritz after a video surfaced in which she described the Afrikaans Protestant Church as a \\"church without kaffirs\\". The term is seen as a racial slur in South Africa directed to the black majority. The FF+ responded with a media statement disputing the authenticity of the video and said that the video is from 2015, when Maritz was still a DA member. The DA investigated a claim in 2015, that Maritz had used the word and consequently dismissed her. Maritz has denied both times that she used the word. The DA's Beyers Smit and Geoffrey Tshibvumo opened the criminal case on 26 September 2019. The DA claims that the leaked video was recorded in 2017, two years after Maritz had resigned from the DA and became a member of the FF+. The ANC referred her to the legislature's Ethics Committee. Maritz's lawyers have advised her not to discuss the issue publicly. Soon after on 3 October 2019, the South African Human Rights Commission announced that it had taken Maritz to the Equality Court over the incident.

Berga village Originally Berga was a village with ancient ancestry. Burial cairns from the Bronze Age and the Late Iron Age can be found on the mountains to the west and within the open landscape to the east and south there are several grave fields from the Early Iron Age, as well as cup marks and remains after now disappeared torps and farms that have been in use since the Middle Ages. Berga is mentioned in writing for the first time in 1401 as \\"Dygraberghom\\", then \\"Berghom\\" in 1437. The village comprised in 1554-1573 four mantal of tax and one church homestead. The latter was located at the village of Fors, where runestone S√∂ 237 stands at the edge along the farm entrance. Berga seat farm Building housing Berga Land Management School. The first known owners of the farm that would become Berga seat farm was a Gierss in 1669, Ulfsparre in 1670 and Ehrenhjelm in 1686. Then the farm came to T√∂rnflycht, in the 1700s again to Ehrenhjelm in 1722, Colling in 1735, Flach in 1740, Aul√¶vill in 1772, then to the kommerser√•d (official in the National Board of Trade) Ljunggren, managing director Zethelius and merchant A. Tyd√©n. During the 1850s, the estate consisted of 2 mantal seat farm, with 5 subordinates, a mill and sawmill. During the 1880s the estate consisted of Berga 5 mantal, Dalby 1, Kapp Ekeby 2, Fors 1, Ormesta 1, Fors mill and sawmill. Later owners owned the island of Vitsgarn in Musk√∂ socken located outside Berga. In 1921, the Berga Agricultural School (Berga lantbruksskola) was founded at the mansion and its facilities, which today is Berga Land Management School (Berga naturbruksgymnasium). In 1944, the Swedish state acquired Berga seat farm, after which the naval school at Skeppsholmen in Stockholm was relocated to Berga. The area included a beach strip that stretched from Vits√• harbor to N√§ringsberg, which was divided into a naval port and naval schools. In addition to the beach strip, there was also a part of the area where Berga Agricultural School was located. Berga Castle Berga Castle in 2008. Berga Castle with associated buildings was built in 1913-15 by industrialist and art patron Helge Axelsson Johnson (1878‚Äì1941) according to drawings by architect Torben Grut (1871‚Äì1945). The two-storey building is built of red brick and rests on a pedestal of granite. It is equipped with a s√§teri roof and has two towered wings towards the courtyard side. During Helge Axelsson Johnson's ownership there was a large hunting ground at Berga with, among other things, wisents. These animals were later transferred to his private facility in Avesta. Other animals included in the park were deer, roe deer, European badgers, foxes, hares and a variety of bird species. In the autumn it was traditional moose hunting and King Gustaf V and his company occupied their own wing at Berga. Thus Helge Axelsson Johnson became hovj√§gm√§stare and the building was upgraded to a castle. Helge Axelsson Johnson was a board member of family-controlled investment company Nordstjernan. He was also a great art lover and collected works at the castle by notable artists including Anders Zorn, Bruno Liljefors, Carl Eldh. When Helge Axelsson Johnson died in 1941, in accordance with his will, his entire estate was sold and most, except for a few grants for various charitable purposes formed a foundation, the Helge Helge Axelsson Johnson Foundation (Helge Ax:son Johnsons stiftelse), which issues grants annually for cultural purposes. In 1944, Berga was sold to the Swedish state for 2.6 million, and the Swedish Navy gained access to sought-after land adjacent to H√•rsfj√§rden, while the Swedish Forest Service (Dom√§nverket) took over the agricultural lands and Berga property. During the last years of World War II and after, the area was expanded for military purposes and in 1946 the Swedish Navy Non- Commissioned Officers‚Äô School started here. During all the years in the hands of the Swedish Armed Forces, the castle has been used for practical purposes, staffs, school management and in recent years also a naval command. Even today there is an office room with a view of H√•rsfj√§rden at the disposal of the Chief of Navy.

The White Peak Homestead was one of the five original pastoral leases established in the region. It was settled by John Drummond, a pioneer pastoralist. The homestead and surroundings retain the homestead building, which is notable for its large scale and grand detailing in comparison with other farmhouses in the region. Outbuildings including stone stables, tack room, shearing shed, machinery sheds are still in place, although some original stone walls have been demolished. History Drummond accompanied William Burges in 1849 on a review of the pastoral potential of the country north of Champion Bay. Both Burges and Drummond took up pastoral leases in the region. In 1851 Drummond took up a lease of 4,000 acres north of Smugglers Cove and named it White Peak, a name inspired by a conical hill on the lease with a large, exposed face of limestone on the summit. Drummond subsequently added a leasehold of 3,000 acres to the southern boundary of White Peak. He also purchased 10 acres near the mouth of Buller River, where he built a small cottage and several outbuildings for his new wife, naming it Red Cliffs. Drummond and his wife Mary lived at Red Cliffs for about 10 years. Mary is believed to have been the first white woman to settle in the district and their daughter, who died in infancy, the first white child born in the region. This buildings at Red Cliffs has since been demolished. In 1855 copper was discovered on White Peak. A company called The White Peak Copper Mining Company was floated by Drummond and George Shenton in 1855, however, after producing only a small volume of metal, then worth 126 pounds a tonne, this company went out of operation in 1858. In 1857 Drummond resigned from the police force following a transfer to Albany, and settled permanently at White Peak, commencing work on the larger White Peak Homestead. This homestead is constructed of local stone sourced from the White Peak Quarry. The homestead had walled gardens that kept the sheep and cattle out. Grapes were grown and wine distilled on the property. In 1881 Edward Charles Wittenoom, who was related to Drummond by marriage, purchased White Peak, where he established a notable sheep stud. He also made additions to the homestead, which are still discernible, including the two large rooms on the western elevation. The White Peak Station had its own railway siding called the Wokarena Siding. The White Peak Station was not re-purchased by the Government for closer settlement like other pastoral leases, however, various parcels of land from the property have been sold privately.

Sruthi Raman from The Times of India, noted in her review, in which about the song \\"Maavuliyo Maavuli\\" she stated that \\"The song hits all the right notes, accompanied by Tenma‚Äôs voice and EDM beats.\\" She referred \\"Nilamellam\\" as \\"a fast-paced number accompanied by Therukoothu and Magudattam.\\" For \\"Nedu Vazhi\\" she stated \\"Vignesh Ishwar‚Äôs voice depicts a beautiful portrait of a son‚Äôs relationship with his father. The acoustic beats hold the song‚Äôs core intact. For the song \\"Thalaimurai\\" she referred that \\"the one song that depicts all that the film stands for, is rendered by two women, with completely different vocal textures. Shakthisree Gopalan and Chinnaponnu conjure a world of peace, yearning to let go off violence and war. Fierce keys complement the fast-paced number\\". She further added \\"Irul Vaanam\\" as \\"a romantic soliloquy that is pleasantly rendered by Subiksha Rangarajan\\" She added \\"Chinna Machan (from Charlie Chaplin 2) fame folk singer Senthil Ganesh injects his characteristic energy into Iruchi, which makes brilliant use of harmonium and Nadaswaram.\\" She finally concluded that \\"It is clear from Tenma‚Äôs rich soundscape that it is designed to organically flow with the film‚Äôs narrative rather than stick out as individual pieces.\\"  Release  Irandam Ulagaporin Kadaisi Gundu was released on 6 December 2019.

She is the co-creator and director of the Broadway musical Passing Strange, and her work in \\"algorithmic theater\\" includes the plays Hello Hi There, A Piece of Work, and Yesterday Tomorrow. Dorsen has received an Alpert Award in the Arts, a Guggenheim Fellowship and a MacArthur Fellowship.  Early life and education  Dorsen was born in 1973 in New York City to Harriette and Norman Dorsen. She has two sisters. She graduated with a BA degree from Yale University in 1996, and received an MFA degree from Yale School of Drama in 2000.  Career  In collaboration with Heidi Rodewald and Stew, Dorsen created and directed the rock musical Passing Strange, a semi-fictional story about Stew's life that was co-commissioned by Berkeley Repertory Theatre and The Public Theater. The show opened Off-Broadway at The Public Theater in 2007, and had its Broadway premiere at the Belasco Theatre in 2008. While Passing Strange was running on Broadway, Dorsen also created Democracy in America, an Off-Broadway satire of American politics and polling, in which anyone could pay a fee to add their own material to the script being performed. Dorsen has collaborated with computer programmers to produce \\"algorithmic theater\\" in which custom algorithms process source material to generate live scripts and scores that are performed by chatbots and human actors. Her first piece of \\"algorithmic theater\\" was Hello Hi There, in which chatbots use text from the Chomsky‚ÄìFoucault debate, the works of William Shakespeare, the Bible, and YouTube comments to create unique dialogue for each performance. In the five- act play A Piece of Work, chatbots and a human actor perform a script created in real-time by processing the text of Hamlet. Yesterday Tomorrow, the final piece in Dorsen's trilogy of algorithmic performances, uses custom algorithms to produce a live score, performed by three singers, that transitions from the Beatles song \\"Yesterday\\" to the song \\"Tomorrow\\" from the musical Annie. In 2017, Dorsen received a grant from the Foundation for Contemporary Arts to support her play The Great Outdoors, in which audience members lie down inside an inflatable planetarium and listen to a human performer read recent Internet comments selected and processed by an algorithm. A year later, Dorsen received the Spalding Gray Award, which provided funds to produce her play The Slow Room. The play, a human performance of a fixed script assembled from virtual sex chat room messages, premiered later that year at Performance Space New York.  Recognition  Dorsen received one of the 2014 Alpert Awards in the Arts, which recognize the work of experimental artists by providing a US$75,000 prize to each recipient. In 2018, she received a Guggenheim Fellowship. The following year she received a MacArthur Fellowship. She was one of six MacArthur fellows from New York City.

History Skullerupholm was in the beginning of the 14th century owned by Anders Pedersen Uldsaks and probably his brother Sakse Pedersen Uldsaks. Sakse's daughter, Ingeborg Uldsaks, inher1der the estate in 1355. She outlived her husband, Peder Jensen Grubbe, by more than 20 years. The estate was by then owned by several heirs. Ingeborg Uldsaks' son-in-law, Johan Olufsen Bj√∏rn, was the sole owner of the estate from 1397. After his death in 1416, Skullerupholm passed to his daughter Eline Johansdatter Bj√∏rn and her husband Sten Basse. Skulderupholm was after their deaths the opbject of a legal dispute between several heirs and lenders. In 1454, Gerver Lunge, Johan Bj√∏rnsen and Oluf Axelsen Thott were each awarded one third of the estate. Oluf Daa, Bishop of Roskilde, acquired all three stakes of the estate in 1457‚Äì61. Skullerupholm was after the Reformation, in 1536, confiscated by the Crown. It was then operated as a royal fief. Mads Frithof was lensmann9 of the Skullerupholm from 1554 to1594. After Frithof's death, Skullerupgaard was divided into two tenant farms and placed under Roskildeg√•rd. After the introduction of Absolute monarchy in 1660, Sukllerupholm was ceded to the magistrate in Copenhagen. Johannes Fincke restored the manor of Skullerupgaard in 1664. It was later ceded to his father-in-law, Henrik M√ºller, one of the largest landowners in the country. It was from 1673 part of Skjolden√¶sholm birk. In 1688, M√ºller ceded Skullerupgaard to his daughter Sophie M√ºller and her husband Johannes Fincke.

It is the headquarters of the Isle of Wight Council. History Following the implementation of the Local Government Act 1888, which established county councils in every county, it became necessary to find offices for the Isle of Wight County Council. The \\"Swan Hotel\\" in the High Street, Newport was acquired for this purpose in 1898. After deciding that this arrangement was inadequate for their needs in the context of the increasing responsibilities of county councils, county leaders chose to demolish the existing premises, acquire some adjoining properties and procure a purpose-built county headquarters on the same site. The new building, which was designed by Gutteridge and Gutteridge of Southampton in the Neo-Georgian style, was officially opened by the former Treasurer of the Household, Lord Bayford, on 19 October 1938. The design involved a symmetrical main frontage of nine bays facing the High Street; the central section featured a doorway with a rectangular fanlight on the ground floor; there was a tall window spanning the first and second floors above. The left and right sections were faced with stone on the ground floor and featured balconies on the first floor. The county coat of arms, flanked by figures depicting Public service and Knowledge, which had been designed by John Hammond Harwood of the Sheffield College of Arts, were erected above the doorway. Pevsner described the design as \\"moderately civic-monumental\\". An 18th century residential property known as \\"Hazards\\" was demolished to make way for a modern extension with a blue and white chequer pattern which was built to the east of the main building in 1969. Following a change of name of the former County Council to Isle of Wight Council in 1995, County Hall became the home of the new unitary authority. After Citizens Advice established a new advice centre in the building in November 2018, the Princess Royal visited the centre and received a demonstration of the centre's new video conferencing system in October 2020.

Originally published in 1920, it was reissued by New Sage Press in 1995 in commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The commemorative edition was edited by Carol O'Hare to update the language for a modern audience. Jailed for Freedom will be reissued again in 2020 by Black Dog & Leventhal in a 100th anniversary edition. The Historical Journal of Massachusetts characterizes the book as \\"a lengthy and sympathetic account of these events\\". Johanna Neumann in the Wall Street Journal ranked Jailed for Freedom number one of books on the fight for women's suffrage. Jailed for Freedom is extensively quoted in Encyclopedia Britannica's Annals of American History in the essay \\"Suffragettes Criminals or Political Prisoners?\\" Silent Sentinels, suffragists picket President Wilson in the White House  Background  Doris Stevens was born in 1888 in Omaha, Nebraska to a pastor father and an immigrant mother from Holland . She attended Omaha High School and later Oberlin College. At Oberlin College she became involved in women's suffrage and became actively involved in advocating for women's legal rights. After graduating, she moved to Washington D.C. and joined NAWSA as a regional organizer. She wrote Jailed for Freedom, which was a firsthand account of her involvement with the more militant National Woman's Party and their fight for suffrage, published in 1920. It follows the story of women's suffrage and the repercussions of fighting for one's rights. Jailed for Freedom discusses how women picketing the White House were jailed and depicts the political and social tensions of that time. Stevens shares accounts of beatings, police brutality, and cruelty faced by women protesters, as well as the injustice faced by women in prison for standing up for their rights. Stevens was an organizer and a devout participant in the Silent Sentinels, protests which began in January 1917 outside of the White House, urging President Woodrow Wilson to pass the 19th Amendment. It was during these peaceful protests that Stevens and other suffragist women were arrested and jailed for their involvement. Stevens dedicated Jailed For Freedom to Alice Paul, another leader of the National Woman's Party who was jailed alongside Stevens during the Silent Sentinels. The book has three parts. Part 1 is titled \\"Leadership\\" and illustrates the work of Susan B. Anthony and Alice Paul. Part 2 is titled \\"Political Action\\" and talks about women organizing to protest the capital and President Woodrow Wilson to gain the right of suffrage. Part 3 is titled \\"Militancy\\" and talks about the violent, cruel backlash these women faced from authorities and in jail. It highlights the fight the women gave the capitol and how they finally succeeded in passing the 19th Amendment.  Part 1  Susan B. Anthony (1820-1906), the first women's suffrage leader Stevens praises in Jailed For Freedom Stevens begins her account praising one of the main founders of NAWSA, Susan B. Anthony. She praises Anthony as a hero, who led women in dramatic militant protests, forcing the public to notice the injustices women were facing. Stevens recounts a time when Susan B. Anthony refused to conform to patriarchal societies' laws, by actually breaking the law. Anthony illegally voted in a presidential election in 1872. She was brought to trial and charged a fine of $100 for her crime which she refused to pay. Stevens and NAWSA later use this tactic of relentless determination to refuse bail and serve time in the Occoquan Workhouse. When Susan B. Anthony died in 1906, Stevens recounts that the militant movement died with her. The revival of the militant movement was sparked with Alice Paul, a quaker who joined NAWSA in 1912. Stevens worked closely with Alice Paul whom she described as quiet, but having a fierce determination like Susan B. Anthony. Stevens recounts how Alice Paul had a quality to her which allowed her to recruit women and men to the Suffrage Movement without an argument. She could win arguments without saying a single word and compelled confidence and self-respect in women. She was the perfect leader as she was extremely calm and knew everything that was coming before it did. Alice Paul, one of the leaders of the Silent Sentinels, got the 19th Amendment passed in 1919.  Part 2  In March 1913, before the inauguration of Woodrow Wilson, women led by Alice Paul and Lucy Burns paraded in front of the Capital. It was a demonstration of how many women wanted the vote, organized by NWP and NAWSA. This Women‚Äôs March did not receive enough police protection. Women got beaten up and harassed by large crowds of the public who were against suffrage. This made headlines and was bad press for police chiefs and the government which refused to protect women. Alice Paul (1885-1977), the second woman's suffrage leader Stevens praises in Jailed For FreedomAfter this, Paul and four other women addressed President Wilson personally in a private conference asking, ‚ÄùMr. President, do you not see you can‚Äôt address tariffs without asking women?‚Äù This was a direct reference to taxation without representation. The women are using the government's own goal of promoting democracy outside of the United States to address democracy in the United States. Alice and Paul and the women are asking how President Wilson can be fighting for Democracy abroad when there is no democracy in the United States. President Wilson promised to consider this issue. He said he had never considered suffrage before. The women's huge demonstrations were all met warmly by the President until the Silent Sentinels. 22 senators were in favor of women‚Äôs suffrage and 3 were against. Women argued that Philippino men get self government before women under Wilson, although he promised to consider women again and again. The women led by Alice Paul and NWP went to congress, lobbied, petitioned, and raised tons of money because now suffrage became a national issue. When the President said the states should decide women‚Äôs suffrage, Alice Pual decided to begin the Silent Sentinel protests. The Silent Sentinels resulted in the imprisonment of over 200 suffragists. Led by Alice Paul and the National Woman‚Äôs Party, women appeared every day at the gates of the White House from the months of June to November to picket the president, Woodrow Wilson, for his lack of action towards the suffragist cause. The woman used the US involvement in World War I as fuel for their cause, calling Wilson a hypocrite for fighting for ‚Äòliberty abroad‚Äô while denying it to women at home. They bore signs with messages like the following: ‚ÄúHow long must women wait for liberty?‚Äù ‚ÄúTell the president that he cannot fight against liberty at home while he tells us to fight for liberty abroad.‚Äù ‚ÄúTell him to make America safe for democracy before he asks the mothers of America to throw their sons to the support of democracy in Europe.‚Äù ‚ÄúAsk him how he can refuse liberty to American citizens when he is forcing millions of American boys out of their country to die for liberty.‚Äù Their signs were not well-received. Army and Navy boys, furious that the women would picket a wartime president, knocked women to the ground and ripped the purple and gold suffrage sashes from their bodies, some tearing the women‚Äôs blouses off in their frenzy. The women (six in total) were taken from the White House and sentenced to 30 days in the Occoquan workhouse. Conditions at the Occoquan workhouse were brutal. Upon arrival, the women were stripped naked, sprayed down with water and forced to change into prison suits. Women were given no way to contact their families-- not even their closest relative. They were permitted three showers a week with the same bar of soap shared amongst all prisoners. They were fed a diet of half cooked vegetables, rice, sour cornbread and ‚Äúrancid soup with worms in it‚Äù. If they refused to eat, the women were beaten until their blood had to be scrubbed from their clothes and the floor. Continued hunger strike resulted women in being force-fed through feeding tubes, that were forced down their noses, leaving them bloody. Officers at the workhouse were so brutal that they sometimes even ordered the African American prisoners to attack the white prisoners. As news got out of the terrible conditions that American women were enduring, the public was horrified. 275x275pxIn July of 1917, a good friend and confidant of President Wilson, Dudley Field Malone, wrote a letter to Wilson protesting the Administration‚Äôs handling of the ‚Äúsuffrage question‚Äù. He urged Wilson to sign a federal bill on suffrage, claiming that it would give him the support from thousands of women on the war for international justice, World War I. Two months later, Wilson remained inactive on the issue and Malone resigned from office on the account that he could ‚Äòno longer be a part of an administration that sent American women to disgusting prisons for demanding suffrage‚Äô. The resignation came as a shock to the American people. Malone received letters of praise from suffragists for his statements in his letter of resignation, such as Alice Stone Blackwell (daughter of Lucy Stone), and Carrie Chapman Catt. However, the arrests of women for picketing continued.  Part 3  The third part of the book focuses on militancy, or what Stevens noted was the name given by many to \\"dramatic acts of protest\\", arguing in the preface: \\"[M]ilitancy is as much a state of mind, an approach to a task, as it is the commission of deeds of protest. It is the state of mind of those who in their fiery idealism do not lose sight of the real springs of human action.\\" In the 27 chapters of Part Three, Stevens continues to describe picketing the White House, in addition to the legal repercussions of doing so throughout 1917. In the time leading up to the first arrests, the suffragettes picketing the White House specifically protested the decision of the Wilson administration to focus solely on \\"wartime measures.\\"... Stevens believed that the Wilson Administration was left only two choices by the picketers: \\"It must yield to this pressure from the people or it mist suppress the agitation which was causing such interest. It must pass the amendment or remove the troublesome pickets.\\" Choosing to get rid of the picketers, the Administration had the police department warn the National Women's Party, before arresting Lucy Burns and Katherine Morey at the next protest. Starting in June 1917, and continuing throughout that year, more suffragettes were arrested each week on the charges of obstructing traffic. Unwilling to admit any guilt by paying a fine, most of the arrested picketers were place in the Occoquan Workhouse. Here, many women, including Alice Paul and Lucy Burns, protested their sentence, and the poor conditions of the facility by going on hunger strike. In addition to using this physical protest as a political weapon, the women defended themselves in court. They pleaded not guilty to the charges of obstructing traffic. Their main lawyers were Mr. Dudley Field Malone (who later becomes Steven's husband) and Mr. J. A. H. Hopkins. Eventually, the women were successfully, and the charges of obstructing traffic were dropped. Stevens develops and illustrates the unclean, and abusive experience of the Occoquan Workhouse throughout Part 3. Following the release of the prisoners, there was a large amount of public support for the movement, and enough pressure of President Wilson to convince him to set a date for Congress to vote on the 19th Amendment. The rest of Part 3 continues to illustrate the results that came around after the picketing, prison time, and hunger strikes. Stevens follows the passing of the 19th Amendment, and the follow up amendment proposal that followed: the Equal Rights Amendment.  Legacy  The impact of Doris Stevens novel has been long-lasting, and it was the basis for the 2004 film, Iron Jawed Angels. Jailed For Freedom, to this day, is the one definitive record of women who went to prison for the suffrage cause. Today, one can learn more on the topic of the Silent Sentinels and women who have been jailed for freedom at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History in Washington DC. One of the items on display is a pin called the \\"Jailed for Freedom\\" pin which was presented to the women who endured the Occoquan Workhouse by the National Women's Party. It resembled a jail cell with a heart shaped lock on it designed by Nina Allender.

The group consisted mainly of highly educated, middle and upper class white women of prominent families. They were originally part of the larger National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA), but broke off in 1906. Prominent leaders in the group included Laura Clay and Kate Gordon, who supported and focused on local and state reforms rather than a national amendment. The group applied tactics like the Lost Cause, the belief that the Confederate cause was moral and just, and the Southern strategy, which appealed to white voters by promoting racism.  Roots  In 1866, a group of former abolitionists formed the American Equal Rights Association, an organization working to win suffrage to all, regardless of race or sex. After three years, however, the group split over arguments with the ratification of the 14th and 15th Amendments. The Fourteenth Amendment (all persons born in the US were citizens and received Due Process) was ratified in 1868. This was followed by the 15th Amendment (black men could vote) in 1870. The ratification of these two Reconstruction-era amendments divided the woman suffragist movement. The Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendment addressed racial equality but did not protect women's rights. Angered at the specific exclusion of women by expressing the rights of men in the 15th Amendment, former AERA members Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony formed the National Woman‚Äôs Suffrage Association (NWSA). The NWSA wanted to achieve the vote with a Constitutional amendment, and pressed the federal government with other women‚Äôs rights issues (unionization of female workers, marital rights). The American Woman Suffrage Association (AWSA), formed by Lucy Stone, wanted to achieve suffrage by reforming the local and state levels . Local suffrage also became the main tactic employed by the Southern States Women‚Äôs Suffrage Association in their ‚Äúwhite only‚Äù movement.  Formation of Southern States Women Suffrage Association  Mrs. Alva Belmont, a donor to both the CU and the SSWSA The NWSA and AWSA had their own agendas until 1890, when they decided to reunite and form the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA). NAWSA worked for state-level amendments, hoping to eventually gain enough momentum for a national amendment. NAWSA was the first group to pioneer the Southern Strategy, convincing Southern political leaders that they could ensure white supremacy by enfranchising white women. At this time, women from the South were interspersed in groups like NAWSA, forming local chapters such as the Equal Suffrage League of Virginia. However, in the early 1900s, a uniquely Southern movement arose. Led by Kate Gordon of Louisiana (1861-1932), these upper class Southern women believed that state- level suffrage measures would help maintain white supremacy. One of Gordon's letters, published in Tennessee's The Journal and Tribune, said \\"I have always maintained that there are no women in the United States who should feel the degradation of disfranchisement so keenly as Southern women, for they have felt a special resentment in witnessing their government make their ignorant slaves the political superiors of the white women of the nation.\\" Gordon first started the ERA (Equal Rights for All) Club in New Orleans, to gain suffrage while appealing to a majority white electorate. Her leadership in the ERA was noticed by the NAWSA, and she was offered a position as secretary of the organization. However, her more conservative views and state‚Äôs right approach ostracized her from NAWSA. Gordon opposed the push for a national amendment, and formed the Southern States Woman Suffrage Association (SSWSA) at a conference in New Orleans. This gathering was later known as the Southern States Woman Suffrage Conference, and was the most notable gathering of these Southern suffragists. Like Gordon, Laura Clay of Kentucky (1849-1941) had been a prominent member of NAWSA; however, she became distanced from the establishment because she did not fully agree with its goals, specifically its aim of a federal amendment. She saw the federal amendment as a way to gain ‚Äúpublicity,‚Äù but would much rather have suffrage centered within the power of the individual states. Clay was ‚Äúlukewarm‚Äù about a separate suffrage group, but joined forces with Kate Gordon in 1916 and became vice president of SSWSC. Initially, Gordon had promised her new group would work alongside, and not against, NAWSA, appealing to more centrist members like Clay. Another leader of the new SSWSC was Ida Porter Boyer, who took the position of Executive Secretary.  Beliefs and timeline of the SSWSA  SSWSA utilized a local- level suffrage, much like the AWSA‚Äôs strategy. Like conservative Southern Democrats at the time, the SSWSA felt that black voters were a source of corruption and saw black disenfranchisement as a positive. The SSWSA, specifically Gordon, paralleled their beliefs to the United Daughters of the Confederacy. Formed in 1894, the United Daughters of the Confederacy was a group championing the Lost Cause, or that the Confederate fight was a just one. They worked to commemorate fallen Confederate soldiers with statues, romanticizing the era of slavery and continuing white supremacy. Membership numbers of the SSWSA were never recorded. The organization‚Äôs New Southern Citizen was a monthly publication updating members on SSWSA‚Äôs progress; it was published from October 1914 to 1917. The New Southern Citizen famously said that \\"like a searchlight, the great white rays of Liberty are turned on one state after another.\\" In a local Tennessee newspaper, the Bristol Herald Courier, the New Southern Citizen is mentioned as reporting on the \\"state rights\\" stance of Congressmen who voted against a federal suffrage amendment. The SSWSA perceived its greatest victory to be the 1916 Democratic primary, claiming that its ‚Äústates' rights suffrage‚Äù had been included in the party platform. 248x248px Monetary funds for the organization, which were estimated at $6,000 a year, were donated anonymously. Later, it was revealed that these donations came from Alva Belmont (previously a Vanderbilt), who once donated to the CU (Congressional Union). The CU, later named the National Woman‚Äôs Party, was the militant, feminist break-off from NAWSA, started by Alice Paul. Its belief in a federal amendment ideologically opposed SSWSA's state rights approach. Nevertheless, Belmont donated to both. Known for her philanthropy towards African Americans in New York, Belmont also wrote to Laura Clay saying that she understood the SSWSA‚Äôs ‚Äúeternal vigilance [on the race problem] in the southern suffrage movement‚Äù.  Tension and division  A poster detailing the \\"Lost Cause\\". These beliefs were incorporated into the platform of the SSWSA. Gordon and Clay‚Äôs group was increasingly at odds with NAWSA, and many Southern suffragists opposed Gordon‚Äôs state level approach. No policies in the SSWSA were established to govern relations with other suffragist groups. Gordon and her ideas were seen as extreme to most suffragists, even in the South, and was all but shunned by the federal level movement. However, the position was similar to that first claimed by the National Woman Suffrage Association and Elizabeth Cady Stanton: the 15th Amendment was an over-reach of federal intervention. Laura Clay, having studied the argument of Henry St. George Tucker presented in 1916 before the Law School of Yale University, emphasized in her own presentation in 1919 during a debate with Kentucky suffragist Madeline McDowell Breckinridge that the proposed new federal amendment would overturn the rights protected by the 10th Amendment. Clay argued: :The ratification of the Anthony amendment is less a question of extending suffrage to women where the states have not done so than of conferring upon Congress certain autocratic powers over the votes for women however they may be gained. It is evident that it gives to states and sections having many Congressmen a great access of power to dictate public policies in states or sections which have a less numerous representation in Congress. Gordon‚Äôs unwavering opposition to federal suffrage drove some prominent SSWSA leaders out of the group. Many SWWSA members preferred state suffrage, but would accept federal change if it meant gaining suffrage. Laura Clay proposed a bill to bridge the two sides: a goal of national suffrage without infringing on state‚Äôs rights. She believed she could unite all suffrage groups (NAWSA, SWWSA) under this one bill. After receiving support from the two groups, she took the bill to Congress, but it never left committee. When the Nineteenth Amendment was written in 1919, Gordon opposed its ratification.  End of SWWSA  The group's activity began to decline in 1917, becoming nothing more than a ‚Äúpaper organization‚Äù. The group officially ended after the 19th Amendment was ratified in 1920.

He became an Honored Artist of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic in 1983.  Biography  Vyshinsky was born in the city of Zlatoust in Chelyabinsk region. After graduating from high school, he entered the Odessa Institute of Water Transport Engineers. On July 15, 1941 he voluntarily joined the Red Army, became a cadet at the flight school in the city of Rostov-on-Don, and upon graduation became a fighter pilot of the Second Guards Fighter Leningrad Aviation Corps. In January 1945, during a combat sortie, he was seriously wounded. In 1945, after the end of World War II, he entered the All-Union State Institute of Cinematography (VGIK, now Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography), where he studied in the workroom of Igor Savchenko and graduated from the directing department cum laude in 1951. He worked at film studios of Alexander Dovzhenko, and later, at the Gorky Film Studio. Since 1953 he worked at the Mosfilm. He joined the CPSU in 1949. Vyshinsky's directorial debut, a full-length color adventure film, In the Square 45 (Russian: –í –∫–≤–∞–¥—Ä–∞—Ç–µ 45), is dedicated to the work of aviators in peacetime. From 1956 to 1960, Vyshinsky dubbed more than twenty feature films and shot a full-length documentary, Our District (Russian: –ù–∞—à —Ä–∞–π–æ–Ω). In April 1962, on the first anniversary of Yuri Gagarin's space flight, Vyshinsky's movie The Submarine was released. It takes place aboard a U.S. submarine off the coast of Cuba during the first manned space flight. In 1963, the black-and-white movie novel Appassionata (Russian: –ê–ø–ø–∞—Å–∏–æ–Ω–∞—Ç–∞), based on the essay V. I. Lenin by Maxim Gorky. The television version of the film received the Golden Lotus prize at the Second International Film Festival in Alexandria, Egypt in 1963. The theme of the Russian revolution was continued by the feature drama The Salvos of the Aurora Cruiser (Russian: –ó–∞–ª–ø –ê–≤—Ä–æ—Ä—ã, 1965). In 1970, Vyshinsky turned to the genre of adventure film and created the movie When the Fog Dissipates (Russian: –ö–æ–≥–¥–∞ —Ä–∞—Å—Ö–æ–¥–∏—Ç—Å—è —Ç—É–º–∞–Ω) based on the eponymous novel by Anatoly Kleschenko, and in 1974 he filmed an adaptation of Alexander Stein‚Äôs play The Ocean (Russian: –û–∫–µ–∞–Ω) about Soviet sailors. The White Snow of Russia (Russian: –ë–µ–ª—ã–π —Å–Ω–µ–≥ –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–∏, 1980), Vyshinsky's last movie about the Russian √©migr√© chess player Alexander Alekhine, was the result of many years of research and the collection of materials about the fates of prominent figures of the post-1917 Russian emigration (the original script covered three Russian celebrities abroad - Alexander Vertinsky, Aleksandr Kuprin and Alexander Alekhine). The movie raises issues such as Man and His Homeland, Citizen and Artist. Vyshinsky died in 1990 in Moscow. He was buried at the Khovansky Cemetery in Moscow.

It is spoken in the city of Serui and other places on the Yapen Islands, as well as in nearby coastal areas of the New Guinea mainland. Though it is likely that Malay was used to an extent in previous centuries, its widespread use and its current form date to the 20th century. Serui Malay is generally referred to as Bahasa Indonesia by its speakers, but it diverges from Standard Indonesian in a number of ways. It has similarities to Ambon Malay, but van Velzen considers it to be more closely related to Ternate Malay.  History  A large number of local languages are spoken in the area, and the need for a common lingua franca has been underlined by the centuries-old traditions of inter-group interaction in the form of slave-hunting, adoption, and intermarriage. It is likely that Malay was first introduced by the , who had contacts with the Sultanate of Tidore, and later, in the 19th century, by traders from China and South Sulawesi. However, Malay was probably not widespread until the adoption of the language by the Dutch missionaries who arrived in the early 20th century and were then followed in this practice by the Dutch administrators. The spread of Malay into the more distant areas was further facilitated by the ('Education for village teacher') programme; it tended to attract a lot of Waropen men, which has led to the influence of the Waropen language on the local Malay varieties.  Phonology  People from West Yapen (Woi, Ansus, Pom) neutralise word-final nasals to []. Those from other ethnic groups do not have because the phoneme is absent from their native languages. The distinction between /r/ and /l/ is clearer in the speech of educated people. The palatal stops of Indonesian are not often distinguished by uneducated speakers, who substitute with , and with , or (Indonesian -> ; -> or ). Word-finally, voiceless stops and are dropped: -> , -> ; may or may not be dropped: -> , -> . is consistently distinguished, unlike in many other varieties of Papuan Malay. Indonesian schwa // has various realisations, sometimes accompanied by a change in the position of stress: as ( -> ), as ( -> ), as ( -> ), as ( -> ), or dropped altogether ( -> ). Indonesian and correspond to and respectively: -> , -> .  Grammar  The morphology is more limited than in standard Indonesian. For example, passive voice or object focus are not marked on the verb, and verb bases are generally used without affixes. A smaller number of derivational affixes are used than in Indonesian. The productive verbal prefixes are the following: * (corresponding to Indonesian ): 'contents' -> 'contain', 'child' -> 'have children'; * (corresponding to Indonesian ): 'beat' -> 'beaten' * (Indonesian ). Used rarely: 'versus' -> 'be opposed to' * (absent from Standard Indonesian, but available in Ambonese, Ternatan and Manadonese Malay). It has a reciprocal meaning: 'beat' -> 'beat each other', 'seduce' -> 'seduce each other'; *, derives intransitive verbs: 'unwilling' -> 'not feel like'. Reduplication is also used, with several meanings, both with nouns and with verbs: 'laugh' -> 'laugh repeatedly', 'stroll' -> 'stroll around', 'child' -> 'children', 'swab' -> 'cleaning rag'. Most speakers do not distinguish between inclusive and exclusive first person ( and in Standard Indonesian), even though this distinction is present in most regional languages of the area. Possession is expressed using (or its shortened form ): :  Vocabulary  Serui Malay diverges in a number of ways from Indonesian in its vocabulary. There are words that have extended or otherwise changed their meaning in comparison with Indonesian: * means \\"moustache\\" in Standard Indonesian, but in Serui Malay it has developed a wider range of meanings: \\"moustache, beard, chest hair, sideboards\\" * (\\"motor, motorcycle\\" in Indonesian) has similarly developed the meanings \\"motor, motor canoe, motorcycle, lungfish\\" *Indonesian 'kill' corresponds to Serui Malay , which has developed the additional meaning \\"switch off\\" * 'oar' is a noun in Indonesian, but in Serui Malay it is a verb meaning 'paddle, row'; the very opposite change has occurred with the Indonesian verb 'row', which has become the noun 'oar'. There are many words in Serui Malay not found in Standard Indonesian: * 'shell' (cf. Indonesian ) * 'grandfarther' (cf. Indonesian ) * 'iguana' (cf. Indonesian ) * 'messy' (a loan from Ambonese Malay, differs from Standard Indonesian ) * 'chili pepper' (cf. Indonesian ) * 'scabies' (cf. Indonesian ) * 'mangrove trees' (cf. Indonesian ) * 'sea urchin' (cf. Indonesian ) * 'skin diving' * 'black magician' * 'Papuan' * 'exclamation of resistance' * 'seduce' * 'hermit crab'. Serui Malay has borrowed vocabulary from Dutch, Portuguese, other Malay varieties and regional languages: * 'head' (from Portuguese ) * 'chair' (from Portuguese ) * 'muscle' (from Dutch ) * 'square' (from Dutch ) * 'give someone a hard time' (from Dutch ) * 'department of forestry' (from Dutch ).

Elliman's main political participation during her lifetime was in the suffrage movement and she was an active member of the National American Women Suffrage Association, otherwise known as NAWSA. She organized rallies, advocated for women, and spread information about suffrage throughout Massachusetts on horseback, where she lived for a large portion of her life.  Background  Elliman was born in Baltimore, Maryland in the 1880s and she remained in Baltimore for many years before getting married at age twenty-eight. She married Joseph Albert Catlin, but he died four years after they married which left her to be a thirty-two- year-old widow.  Education and employment  This is Claiborne Catlin's sash that she wore during her ride for women's suffrage. After her husband's death, Elliman was reluctant to move back to her home so she moved to New York. There she went to the New York School of Philanthropy, a higher education institution that trained people to do social work, where she began to do settlement work. Additionally, she worked with Dr. Charles Davenport studying eugenics in Cold Spring Harbor, Long Island. In 1914 she got a job working at a psychological clinic at the University of Pennsylvania where she wrote an excerpt in The Psychological Clinic, Volume 8 titled, \\"Incorrigibility Due to Mismanagement and Misunderstanding\\". This is Claiborne Catlin's saddlebag she wore during her ride for suffrage.  Political activism  During her work and educational experience, Elliman joined the suffrage movement and started her journey as a political activist. She joined the Massachusetts Political Equality Union and became a member of the National American Women Suffrage Association (NAWSA). As a member of NAWSA she was responsible for publicizing a rally that was to be held at Tremont Temple. She chose to spread news of the event by riding a horse through downtown Boston with fellow suffragist, Linda Marston, to call attention to the movement and gain supporters for the rally. Her work towards gaining supporters was wildly successful and inspired her to do the same thing on a larger scale. On July 2, 1914, Claiborne Caitlin began her horseback tour around Massachusetts to spread the word about women's suffrage. She received money with a collection box that was passed around for donations, since she started the journey without any money. She was a well- known horsewoman and planned to ride a horse named Trixie, who had competed and won in many horse races across the country. Claiborne packed very light because she was a minimalist, and only carried a raincoat and necessary feminine products in her saddlebag. She rode around in a khaki suit, leggings, and a sombrero with a feather. Her trip covered 530 miles, she visited 37 cities and organized 59 meetings along her trip. She felt it gave her purpose in the movement and in politics that she didn't have before joining the suffrage movement. It also gave her exhilaration and camaraderie to be a part of the women's suffrage movement.  Legacy  While there was less documentation of Claiborne Catlin's involvement in the women's movement after her ride for suffrage, it left a significant mark on the history of the movement. Her passion for women's rights and suffrage was inspiring to other women and her ride for suffrage was well documented throughout the United States at the time in the press. Today, her sash and her saddlebags that she took with her on her ride for suffrage in 1914 are historically important and protected artifacts which represent her work in the women's movement.

In the 1910s, she campaigned and translated at rallies in Southern California, where suffragists distributed tens of thousands of pamphlets in Spanish.  Early life  When she was a child, de Lopez lived in San Gabriel, Los Angeles. La casa Vieja de Lopez or La casa de Lopez de Lowther Adobe was the home for Juan Lopez, Maria de Lopez's father. He moved into this home in 1849. Members of his family occupied the house until 1964, and when Maria de Lopez retired she lived in her ancestral adobe. The home is currently closed to the public. Her father was a blacksmith, Juan Nepomiceno Lopez, and her mother was Guadalupe. She had a sister named Ernestina de Lopez, who was also educated. The eldest daughter in her family, Belen, lived at home and worked as a seamstress and was not able to seek further education because she had to help at home. By the 1890s, all of the older children in her family had left the house, and two sisters of Maria de Lopez had married and left home. This made it financially easier on the parents and made it possible for Maria and Ernestina de Lopez to stay in school. When their father died in 1904, both sisters returned home to San Gabriel to live with their mother, and they supported her financially by working as Spanish teachers.  Early career  Maria de Lopez had a long work history in the field of education. She was a teacher at Los Angeles High School, where she taught English as a second language course. Maria de Lopez worked at the University of California, Los Angeles, as a translator. In 1902, she became the youngest instructor at the University of California, making her possibly the first Latina to teach at UCLA. In the 1930s, she served as president of the UCLA faculty women's club.  Suffrage work  Pamphlet of the Los Angeles Political Equality League by Maria de Lopez. de Lopez was a member of the Los Angeles-based Votes for Women Club alongside Cora Lewis, Martha Salyer, Clara Shortridge Foltz, and Mary Foy which was formerly known as the Equality Club. On October 3, 1911, the Votes for Women Club held a large rally at the plaza, which featured Maria de Lopez giving her speech in Spanish. She was a member in Women's College Club, Women's Business Club, and the Executive Board of the high school teachers' association of Los Angeles. She was also the president of the College Equal Suffrage League of Southern California when suffrage was won in 1911. That year she published an article in the Los Angeles Herald calling for equal rights for women and men as foundational in a democracy. The Los Angeles Herald also noted 1913 that de Lopez was chosen to be one of the suffragists representing California to march in the 1913 suffrage parade in Washington, D.C., organized by suffragists Alice Paul and Lucy Burns. It is unknown if de Lopez attended the 1913 suffrage parade or not. de Lopez was a Spanish-language translator for the suffrage movement during the 1911 state-wide campaign.She \\"Instituted a campaign among the Spaniards and the Mexicans and toured the state giving suffrage lectures in Spanish.\\" Maria de Lopez is credited as the first person to make speeches in California on equal suffrage in the Spanish language. She also gave speeches on suffrage in English.  Involvement in World War I  During World War I, Maria de Lopez temporarily gave up her teaching job and moved to New York City. There she trained as an ambulance driver. She also learned to fly a plane and served in the ambulance corps in France. She was later cited for bravery by the French government.  Personal life  Maria de Lopez was also known as Lupe, Eva, Maria, and Marie. In 1897 she graduated from Pasadena High School, and then she graduated from the Los Angeles Normal School, a teaching college. Maria de Lopez married Hugh Lowther, a professor at Occidental College. After marriage, she became Maria de Lopez Lowther or sometimes Maria de Lopez de Lowther. The 1930 census said de Lopez was married at age 38.

The project was named \\"h-pem\\" by combining \\"h\\" for the Hamazkayin Armenian Educational and Cultural Society, with \\"pem,\\" the Armenian word for \\"platform.\\" Lilly Torosyan joined h-pem in 2017 as the assistant project manager and staff writer, while Rupen Janbazian joined the following year as the platform's editor, content manager, and data protection officer. Shahen Araboghlian, h-pem's social media strategist and management assistant, joined in 2019. H-Pem was made available to the public on May 13, 2019.  Features  Though most of the platform is open to the public, h-pem features a free membership option, which allows users to comment on articles, to submit their work and recommendations, and to interact with other users. H-Pem's content is divided into two main parts: \\"Featured content,\\" which features pieces written by contributors, and \\"Your stage,\\" a space in which users' works are highlighted. The \\"Featured content\\" portion of the platform is h-pem's online magazine, which includes stories, interviews, analyses, and profiles of Armenian cultural figures and achievers, as well as stories in pictures. \\"Your stage\\" is an experimental space, which includes a multimedia guide and a submissions area, aspiring and established artists are encouraged to introduce and share their creative output. \\"Your stage\\" also features a section for collaborations with artists, writers, cultural executives, students, and graduates from multiple disciplines, as well as organizations, institutions, and community members, on focused projects. The platform also features a section, which live streams Armenian cultural events around the world.

Born in England, Stuart Simmonds was an academic based at SOAS between 1948 and 1982, who specialized in the language and history of the Thai people. He was Director of the Royal Asiatic Society from 1965‚Äì1968 and its President from 1973‚Äì1976. Serving in the British armed forces during World War II, Simmonds was captured along with the rest of the British forces at the surrender of Singapore in 1942. He was subsequently interned in labour camps on the Burma Railway, in western Thailand, during the rest of the war. Despite the conditions, it was this experience which first sparked an interest in Thai culture, which he pursued after returning to England in the post-war period. Simmonds played a central role in establishing the study of Tai languages, literature and culture at the university level in post-war Britain. This role was publicly acknowledged when, in 1988, the King of Thailand appointed him Commander of the Most Exalted Order of the White Elephant.

Its source is a small pond near WakeMed Soccer Park in Cary, and it flows generally eastward through several small reservoirs, including Lake Cramer in Cary as well as Lake Johnson and Lake Raleigh in Raleigh, before reaching its confluence with the Neuse just south of Poole Road in East Raleigh. The course of the creek closely parallels Interstate 40, running mostly along the north side of the freeway. The Walnut Creek Trail, a branch of the Capital Area Greenway, follows the length of Walnut Creek from Lake Johnson to its confluence, and is the second longest trail in the Greenway System.

Partly due to this development, ECAC East split into two conferences when the NESCAC began sponsoring ice hockey as a sport and the 9 existing programs left ECAC East to form the new league. Each team in the ECAC East and NESCAC played one another in one game that counted in their respective conference standings. Because the NESCAC now sponsored ice hockey as a varsity sport, the conference dropped the policy that allowed member schools to play in only one postseason tournament. Member teams could now play in both the conference tournament and the national tournament. Despite the dissolution of the Division II Tournament, five eastern teams continued to compete as Division II programs. At the conclusion of the regular season they held an ECAC Division II Tournament rather than compete in their respective conference tournaments.

It was owned by Toronto businessmen Abe Orpen, Charles Vance Millar, H. D. Brown and Thomas Hare. Orpen also owned Dufferin Park Racetrack and Long Branch Racetrack. It was notable for a match race between horses Man o' War and Triple Crown winner Sir Barton in 1920. The track operated from September 1916 to 1935. It was one of three racetracks that operated in the Windsor area while horse racing in Michigan, specifically Detroit, was banned. The track operated for only two years after horse race betting in Michigan was legalized in 1933. History In 1916, partners Charles Millar, H. D. \\"Curly\\" Brown, Abe Orpen and Thomas Hare built the Kenilworth Park Racetrack on just outside Windsor, Ontario. They bought the grandstand from the defunct Kenilworth Racetrack in Buffalo, New York, dismantled it and reconstructed it at the new track. To make the racing legal, the partners bought an old racing charter that permitted 14 days of racing. It opened as an independent track on September 2, 1916, staffed by the Dufferin Park staff. In 1917, the track joined the Canadian Racing Association (CRA) and held two CRA meets, a seven- day meet in August and a seven-day meet in October, as well as its own season in July. When Kenilworth opened in 1916, there already was an existing track in Windsor: Hendrie, which was controlled by the owners of the Connaught Park track. Later in 1916, a third track was built at Windsor: Devonshire, which was built nearby. Orpen attempted to stop the new track by challenging its license and then threatening that anyone who raced at Devonshire would be banned from Kenilworth. However, when the Devonshire half-mile track opened with horses considered second-rate, Orpen withdrew his opposition to the track. \\"The Race of the Age\\" In 1920, Orpen out-bid several racetracks to land a match race between Man o' War and Triple Crown winner Sir Barton at the track. The Kenilworth Park Gold Cup was so highly anticipated that it became the first horserace to be filmed in its entirety, with the resulting footage later shown in movie theatres across the country. The October 12, 1920, race was originally intended to be a face-off between the three great horses of the time: Man o' War, Sir Barton and Exterminator. However, the owners of Sir Barton and Man o' War agreed to a distance of miles, which was too short for Exterminator to run his best, and agreed to a weight-for-age format, under which the older Exterminator would concede weight to Man o' War. Therefore, Exterminator was not entered, and in fact, raced that same day on a different track. Orpen put up a $75,000 purse and a $5,000 gold cup, now known as the Man o' War Cup, designed by Tiffany & Co. of New York. The crowd at the track for the race was estimated at more than 30,000 and it bet on the race. Millar died in 1926. In his will, every duly ordained Christian minister in Walkerville, Sandwich and Windsor, \\"except Spracklin, who shot a hotelkeeper\\" was to receive a share of Kenilworth Park. In October 1928, five pastors in Windsor claimed the bequest of the Kenilworth shares. The value of the shares was hard to judge, as the stock did not trade publicly. One estimation was that they were worth less than one cent each. In 1933, Michigan legalized horse racing with betting. Michigan officials allowed horse racing on the State Fair Grounds in Detroit ‚Äì across the Canada‚ÄìU.S. border from Windsor ‚Äì at the same time as a planned Kenilworth meet. Orpen applied for relief of racing taxes from the Government of Ontario, but was turned down. Expecting a loss, Kenilworth postponed its meet. The track held its last meet in 1935. According to Orpen, competition from the Detroit race track left no room for a meet. The track had lost on an early spring meet run in May 1934, the dates selected to avoid competing with the Detroit races. Devonshire held its last meet in 1936, ending the run of the Windsor race tracks. Kenilworth's grandstand was demolished in 1939 and the site was developed as a housing subdivision. Fred Orpen had the steel from the grandstand delivered to the Long Branch Racetrack, intending to re-use the steel for a new grandstand at Dufferin Park, but the idea was abandoned. The racing charter was transferred to Long Branch to give it an extra seven days of racing per year. Legacy The racetrack site is marked by a small park known as Kenilworth Park on Howard Avenue. Several of the streets are named after the park: Kenilworth Drive and Kenilworth Place. The match race is available to view on the internet.

History The church was established on this site as early as 1193 but certainly by 1265. Abbot Robert Champeaux of Tavistock Abbey rebuilt it in 1318. There was further building work in 1352 and 1380.. It was largely rebuilt in the 15th century when a new chancel was added at the east end. The south aisle was added between 1445-47 as a bequest from Constance Coffyn. There was a major restoration between 1844-45 by the architect John Hayward when the Caen stone pulpit by Knight of Exeter, a new reading desk, an oak organ screen and carved pew ends were added. The gallery was removed. A new organ bay in the north aisle was added, along with vestries south of the chancel. It reopened for worship on 26 June 1845. In 1896 the font was moved to the west end of the south aisle. Another restoration was undertaken in 1902-03. The choir stalls were removed from the chancel and new marble flooring was installed. The nave and aisles were re-floored and the roofs were overhauled when rubs and wall plates were made good, and new figures of angels restored to the positions occupied previously by similar figures. New brass lighting pendants were suspended from the roof and the seating was re-spaced. The contractor was J.A. Dennis of Tavistock, and the architect George Fellowes Prynne. The new reredos with riddels (curtains) to the design of A.S. Parker was carved by J.R. Hunt and dedicated on 19 May 1929. Vicars Organ The organ case The first mention of an organ is in 1538/9 when it was noted that repairs were needed. By the 1790s there was a barrel organ in a gallery. In 1802 this was replaced, and the 1802 organ was replaced in 1825. The current organ was built by J.W. Walker and Sons. It was opened by Samuel Sebastian Wesley on 25 June 1846. The carved statues on the organ case were added in 1879. There were later modifications and additions by Hele and Company of Plymouth and Lance Foy which has resulted in a three manual organ with 51 stops. A specification of the organ can be found in the National Pipe Organ Register. =Organists= Initially the salary of the organist was funded by the Duke of Bedford, but by 1875 the salary had reached ¬£61 10s per annum () and Francis Russell, 9th Duke of Bedford decided it was time for the congregation to fund it. At the time, the pew rents generated ¬£120 per annum, with expenses of running the church at ¬£118 per annum. *Samuel Sebastian Wesley 1846 *John Frederick Thynne 1846 - 1877 *Alexander Luke Vingoe 1877 \\\\- 1878 *Charles John Vincent 1878 \\\\- 1883 (formerly organist of St Mark's Church, Sunderland, afterwards organist of Christ Church, Hampstead) *John Tomlinson 1883 - 1906 *William Clotworthy 1907 - 1942 (formerly organist of St Mary Magdalene's Church, Launceston) *Harold Charles Lake 1942 - 1956 Bells The tower contains a peal of 10 bells The eight bells of 1925 by John Taylor and Company of Loughborough were expanded to 10 in 1998 by the addition of two new bells by the same founder.

He investigates the chemistry of human breast milk. In 2019 Townsend was selected as one of Chemical & Engineering News Talented 12.  Early life and education  Steve Townsend was born in Detroit in 1983. He graduated from Martin Luther King High School in 2001 before starting an undergraduate degree in chemistry at Oakland University. At Oakland he was a Keeper of the Dream scholar and worked with Amanda Bryant-Friedrich, a toxicologist. He completed his bachelor's degree in 2005 and was awarded the American Chemical Society Outstanding Graduating Senior Award and the Alfred G Wilson Founders Medal - an award that recognizes a senior who has given significant contributions as a scholar, a leader, and a responsible citizen of the institution. In 2005, he matriculated to Vanderbilt University, joining the laboratory of Gary Sulikowski. He was supported by predoctoral fellowships from the United Negro College Fund and Pfizer. After completing his doctoral education at Vanderbilt, he completed a postdoctoral research fellowship with Samuel J. Danishefsky at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and Columbia University. He is an initiated member of Phi Beta Sigma, a predominantly African American Fraternity founded in 1914.  Research and career  Steve joined Columbia University as a postdoctoral scholar, working in the laboratory of Samuel Danishefsky. Whilst living in New York he noticed that in wealthy neighbourhoods there were adverts for breastfeeding, whilst in poor neighbourhoods there were adverts for formula. He became interested in women's health disparities and the science of human breast milk. He started to investigate milk sugars (Human Milk Oligosaccharides, HMOs) and identified that they help infants fight disease. HMOs are prebiotics and help to promote colonisation of the intestine with good bacteria. Townsend was the first to show that HMOs prevent the formation of group B streptococcus and that they can even exert antimicrobial activity. He was awarded the Ruth A. Lawrence Investigator Award for his work in human milk science. Since Townsend's observation that oligosaccharides were crucial for antibacterial defence and to support infection-fighting proteins the oligosaccharide 2‚Ä≤-fucosyllactose has been included in a number of products. Townsend went on to show that whilst 2‚Ä≤-fucosyllactose is in the breast milk of the majority of white women, black and Latina women do not necessarily produce the sugar.

Witwer is an associate professor of molecular and comparative pathobiology and neurology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore, Maryland, United States. His laboratory studies extracellular vesicles (EVs), extracellular RNA (exRNA), and enveloped viruses, including HIV and SARS-CoV-2. Witwer has served as Secretary General and Executive Chair of Science and Meetings of the International Society for Extracellular Vesicles (ISEV), has been a scientific advisor to the US Environmental Protection Agency and the US National Institutes of Health, and is an associate editor of the Journal of Extracellular Vesicles.  Career and research  Witwer's PhD dissertation research was on retroviruses and the innate immune system responses to pathogens such as Visna virus and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) as models of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), specifically regulation of microRNAs, cytokines, and the promyelocytic leukemia protein (TRIM19). He then completed a postdoctoral research project on miRNAs as biomarkers of HIV disease. In 2011, Witwer joined the faculty at Johns Hopkins, and he assumed a tenure-track position in 2012. The Witwer laboratory studies the roles of EVs and exRNA in HIV disease of the central nervous system and in other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Another focus of the group is on how inflammatory insults like cigarette smoking affect progression of disease. Beginning in 2013, Witwer examined the hypothesis that RNAs such as miRNAs in dietary substances could regulate endogenous genes in mammals. These studies led him and others to the conclusion that this type of regulation is unlikely to occur in normal physiology. He subsequently served on two Scientific Advisory Panels of the US EPA and addressed the European Food Safety Authority on related questions of environmental exposure to RNA.  Organization and editing  Witwer chaired the organizing committee of the ISEV2015 annual meeting (Bethesda, United States). He has since filled several leadership roles with ISEV and organized or co-organized multiple workshops and other meetings on five continents. He is co-Chair with Paul Robbins of the 2020 Gordon Research Conference on EVs. Witwer is an associate editor of the Journal of Extracellular Vesicles and a member of the editorial boards of Clinical Chemistry and AIDS.  Scientific rigor, standardization, and advocacy  Witwer has contributed to scientific standardization and rigor efforts. He was corresponding author in 2013 of the first position paper of the International Society for Extracellular Vesicles, on standardization of isolation and characterization of EVs in RNA studies. With Clotilde Th√©ry, he coordinated the Minimal Information for Studies of Extracellular Vesicles (MISEV2018), a consensus guidelines document for the EV field. An opponent of AIDS denialism, a largely defunct movement that denied the existence of HIV or its role in causing AIDS, he has encouraged high standards in scientific publishing, critiquing predatory publishing and other publishing practices.Jocelyn Kaiser, \\"ScienceInsider: U.S. Government Accuses Open Access Publisher of Trademark Infringement\\" , Science, 9 May 2013 He has advocated public availability of scientific data. With the emergence of COVID-19, Witwer was interviewed about the virology of the pandemic and conspiracy theories that arose around SARS-CoV-2.

Most of the world's data is recorded on HDDs, and there is continuous pressure on manufacturers to create greater data storage capacity in a given HDD form-factor and for a given cost. In an HDD, data is stored using magnetic recording on a rotating magnetic disk and is accessed through a write-head and read-head (or read-element). TDMR allows greater storage capacity by advantageously combining signals simultaneously from multiple read-back heads to enhance the recovery of one or more of data- tracks. In this manner, data can be stored with higher areal-density on the disks thus providing higher capacity in each HDD.A. Shilov speaking with Mark Re, Seagate CTO, \\"The evolution of hdds in the near future\\", AnandTech: 6 July, 2016T.

Mellor, \\"MAMR Mia! Western Digital's 18TB and 20TB microwave-energy hard drives out soon\\", The Register, Sept 4, 1019  Overview  The TDMR approach arose from a working group set up under INSIC to explore alternative future storage technologies.R. Wood, \\"Shingled Writing and Two-Dimensional Magnetic Recording\\", INSIC Annual Meeting, Alternative Storage Technologies 2009: You Want to Build What?, 5 Aug. 2009 In the initial concept, the data-tracks were assumed to be very narrow tracks created by shingled recording and subject to considerable mutual interference. The read-heads were assumed to be each centered over a corresponding data-track and a joint detector would optimally recover data from several tracks simultaneously.R. Wood, M. Williams, A.

These actual first implementations of TDMR are much simpler and very different to the scenario originally envisioned above. Current implementations recover only a single track using a read head with just two read-elements stacked one above the other (i.e. downtrack) and rely on the skew arising from the use of a rotary actuator to create some cross-track separation between the sensors.J.

The Act changed the law regarding organ donation so that unless someone expressly opted out, they would be deemed as having given consent. It was a private member's bill introduced by Geoffrey Robinson and Lord Hunt of Kings Heath. Provisions The provisions of the act include: *Amending the Human Tissue Act 2004 to change organ donation in England, Wales and Northern Ireland to an opt-out programme. *Excepting adults who have not been resident in England for 12 months prior to their death or one who for a significant period before their death lacked the capacity to consent. Legacy The Organ Donation (Deemed Consent) Act 2019 was dubbed \\"Max and Keira's Law\\", after Kiera Ball, a nine-year-old child who was killed in a traffic accident whose heart was donated to Max Johnson, another nine year old. The chair of the Medical Ethics committee of the British Medical Association, John Chisholm said the association was \\"delighted\\" with the Bill's passing and that the law would \\"maximise the number of lives that can be saved\\". Some critics argued that the NHS would need the money and infrastructure to cope with the change. Some conservative pundits argued that the law represented a government \\"takeover of the body\\". Elsewhere, the law prompted discussions about the relationship between organ donation and religious beliefs and practices. Questions were also raised over how effective 'deemed consent' laws were after it was reported that organ donation had not increased significantly after Wales implemented an opt-out system.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2019. History In 1906, Henry Richter, bishop of the Diocese of Grand Rapids, recruited Monsignor Anthony Volkert to develop a seminary program. In 1909, the diocese purchased a building in Grand Rapids and opened Saint Joseph's Minor Seminary, educating high school- and college-age boys. The seminary proved a success, and a new four-story brick building was constructed in 1910 to house the program. The building was enlarged in 1913, but still proved too small to house all students. In 1919, the diocese purchased property on Burton Street, in what was still a rural area, to construct a new building. Construction started in 1919, and the building was completed at the end of 2020, with enough room to house 100 students, as well as convent room for the Sisters of Mercy, who provided food and infirmary services. However, enrollment steadily increased, and by the late 1920s, there were again more students than the school had room for. Alterations were made in 1933 to provide more room, and again in 1943. In 1944, a separate convent was constructed for the sisters, and in 1946 the attic was furnished. By 1955, over 200 students were at the school, and in 1956 ground was broken for a new building, Saint Henry Hall. Further additions were made in 1957 and 1958. However, enrollment began declining in the 1960s. The college students began taking classes at nearby Aquinas College, and Saint Joseph became a high school-only institution. By 1968, student enrollment was below 100. In the 1970s, the high school students began taking their classes at the nearby Catholic Central High School, and much of Saint Joseph was converted to office space. In 1981, the school closed for good. The diocese continued to use the main building for offices and a conference center.

Life Haulleville was born in Luxembourg on 28 May 1830 and was orphaned at an early age. He was raised by uncles, and educated at state secondary schools in Virton, Arlon and Li√®ge.Norbert Piepers, \\"Haulleville (Charles-Alexander-Prosper, baron de)\\", Biographie Nationale de Belgique, vol. 37 (Brussels, 1971), 413-420. Raised a non- believer, at the age of 16 he heard a sermon by Lacordaire that entirely changed his outlook. After obtaining a doctorate in law from the Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles, he studied History and Philosophy at the University of Bonn. In 1857, he was appointed to a professorship in law at the State University of Ghent, but he was removed from this position a year later by order of Prime Minister Charles Rogier due to his outspoken views on the rights of Catholics. His academic career at an end, he dedicated the rest of his life to journalism and independent study. In 1860 he took over the failing newspaper L'Universel but was unable to turn it around. It folded in 1861. Haulleville was among the organisers of the first of the Malines Congresses, in 1863. The following year he established a publishing house that acquired Pierre Kersten's Journal historique et litt√©raire and launched the Revue G√©n√©rale (1865), of which he became editor from 1874 to 1890. At the same time, he was editor of the Journal de Bruxelles from 1878 to 1890. His editorial line at both the Revue G√©n√©rale and the Journal de Bruxelles campaigned against Liberal encroachments on the rights of Catholics under the ministry of Walth√®re Fr√®re-Orban (1878-1884), but also adopted progressive stances aligned with the emergence of Christian democracy that were at odds with the conservatism of the Catholic Party that came to power in 1884.N. Piepers, La Revue g√©n√©rale de 1865 √† 1940 (1968), pp. 27-30. He also published contemporary writers associated with La Jeune Belgique. After more or less being forced out as editor in 1890, Haulleville was in 1891 appointed chief curator of the Royal Museums of Decorative and Industrial Arts and Halle Gate. In the early 1890s he repeatedly tried to get Tramways Bruxellois to extend a line to the new museum site in the Cinquantenaire Park, but was unable to provide the matching funds they required.Liesbet Nys, De intrede van het publiek: Museumbezoek in Belgi√´, 1830-1914 (Leuven, 2012), p. 304. Since 1888 he had also been lecturing on history and constitutional law at the Royal Military Academy. He continued publishing political controversy, but under the pen name F√©lix de Breux, in the Journal de Bruxelles, Durendal, L'Avenir social and La Justice sociale. Haulleville had stood for parliament on four occasions but was never elected. In 1895, he was elected to Brussels city council on the National Independents list. He died in Brussels on 25 April 1898.

Holman Bible Publishers, Nashville, Tennessee. 2012. This book is one of the Five Megillot, a collection of short books, together with Book of Ruth, Lamentations, Ecclesiastes and Esther, within the Ketuvim, the third and the last part of the Hebrew Bible. Jewish tradition views Solomon as the author of this book, and this attribution influences the acceptance of this book as a canonical text, although this is at present largely disputed. This chapter contains the man's descriptive poem of the woman's body and the invitation to be together which is accepted by the woman. Text The original text is written in Hebrew language. This chapter is divided into 16 verses. =Textual witnesses= Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter in Hebrew are of the Masoretic Text, which includes the Codex Leningradensis (1008). Some fragments containing parts of this chapter were found among the Dead Sea Scrolls: 4Q106 (4QCanta; 30 BCE-30 CE; extant verses 1‚Äì7), and 4Q107 (4QCantb; 30 BCE-30 CE; extant verses 1‚Äì3, 8-11, 14‚Äì16).Dead sea scrolls - Song of Songs. There is also a translation into Koine Greek known as the Septuagint, made in the last few centuries BCE. Extant ancient manuscripts of the Septuagint version include Codex Vaticanus (B; \\\\mathfrak{G}B; 4th century), Codex Sinaiticus (S; BHK: \\\\mathfrak{G}S; 4th century), and Codex Alexandrinus (A; \\\\mathfrak{G}A; 5th century). Structure Modern English Version (MEV) groups this chapter into: * = The Man * = The Woman =Male: First descriptive poem and call to come along (4:1-8)= Mount Hermon, highest point in the Anti-Lebanon range, looking north from Mount Bental in the Golan Heights. Satellite image of Lebanon. The snow-covered areas nearer the coast are the Mount Lebanon range and the snow- covered areas further inland are the Anti-Lebanon mountain range. The beginning (verse 1a) and the end (verse 8a) of this part contain repeated lines that 'frame an address of endearment': \\"my darling/[my] bride.\\" Verses 1-7 contain the man's wa·π£f or descriptive poem of his female lover from head to breast, using imagery of flora and fauna, with a few of 'fortifications and military weapons'. Verses 2 and 5 begin and end this imagery with comparisons with animals, such as sheep and fawns, whereas verses 6-8 focus on the desire of the male speaker to visit \\"the mountain of myrrh\\" and to be joined there by his partner, expressing his desire in terms of a sensual pursuit with his lover's body as a mountain on which he finds perfumes. Verse 7 concludes with a summary statement of the woman's perfection and invitation to his bride to 'come away from the impregnable heights and to join him'. This wa·π£f and the later ones (5:10-16; 6:4-10; 7:1-9) theologically demonstrate the heart of the Song that values the body as not evil but good even worthy of praise, and respects the body with an appreciative focus (rather than lurid). Hess notes that this reflects 'the fundamental value of God's creation as good and the human body as a key part of that creation, whether at the beginning () or redeemed in the resurrection (, )'. While verse 7a is in parallel with verse 1a forming an inclusio as well as a sense of closure to this part of the poem, verse 7b follows the positive assertion of the woman's beauty with a more negative assertion that \\"she has no blemish or defect\\" (m√ªm; referring to physical imperfection; cf. the use in the sacrificial ritual, , : ), which is similar to the reference to Absalom () or Daniel and his three friends in the court of Nebuchadnezzar (). Verse 4 :Thy neck is like the tower of David builded for an armoury, whereon there hang a thousand bucklers, all shields of mighty men. KJV *\\"Tower of David\\": the actual tower is unknown. *\\"Bucklers\\": small shields.Note [a] on Song 4:4 in NKJV The image of the shields and bucklers describe the necklace around the neck of the woman. Verse 8 :Come with me from Lebanon, my spouse, with me from Lebanon: look from the top of Amana, from the top of Shenir and Hermon, from the lions' dens, from the mountains of the leopards. KJV This verse depicts the danger and the woman's inaccessibility (cf. Song 2:14). The man is asking his bride not to go with him to Lebanon but to come with him from Lebanon, which is a 'figurative allusion to the general unapproachableness' of the woman. Verse 8b contains two parallel expressions that frame the central expression \\"from Hermon\\": :Travel ::from the peak of Amana, ::from the peak of Senir, :::from Hermon, ::from the dens of lions ::from the mountain lairs of leopards. A similar structure in verse 7 forms together the twin centers of \\"my darling\\" and \\"from Mount Hermon\\", which beautifully summarize the concern of the man for access to his bride. *\\"Lebanon\\": located north of Israel in modern-day Lebanon and Syria; Amana, Shenir (or Senir) and Hermon are the names of individual peaks in the Anti-Lebanon mountain ranges. *\\"Spouse\\" or \\"bride\\" together with \\"sister\\" (, ; 5:1) are terms of affection. =Male: A walk in the garden (4:9-15)= This section is a part of a dialogue concerning 'seduction and consummation' (until 5:1), where here the man seduces the woman, with extravagant imagery of food and flowers/herbs. Verse 14 :Spikenard and saffron; calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense; myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices: KJV *\\"Saffron, calamus, cinnamon\\" and \\"aloes\\" are spices from India. =Female: Invitation to her garden (4:16)= The woman consents to the man's call (verses 9-15), leading to a closure in 5:1.

The Suffragettes are (left to right) Dorothy Hartopp Radcliffe, Dora Spong who appears to be holding a pile of Votes for Women newspapers, Hilda Dallas and Charlotte Marsh carrying the placard Dora Beedham (3 June 1879 - 1969) was a British nurse from the social activist Spong Family and suffragette who joined the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) in 1908 and was imprisoned and force-fed.  Biography  Born as Dora Spong in Balham, London in 1879, she was the fourth daughter of Frances Elizabeth Scott (1843-1929) and father James Osborne Spong (1839-1925) who ran a labour-saving device engineering company, Spong & Co, who made and sold devices which may 'help women move out of the kitchen' like coffee grinders, corkscrews, knife cleaners, burglar and fire alarms, animal traps and a meat mincer which had sold 200,000 by 1882. Spong & Co. mincers were used in the largest public and private institutions in the land. Her mother was a vegetarian - Dora and the other daughters followed suit. In June 1910 Dora Spong began training as a midwife, a career she was still following in 1915.UK, The Midwives Roll, 1904-1959 for Dora Beedham (1915) She married Ralph John Beedham (1879-1975) on 14 October 1910 with whom she had two children:, Ruth (born 1914) and David (born 1918. Ralph was a woodcut engraver for artists (a formschneider), a Quaker and pacifist, and conscientious objector during World War I. Both vegetarians, they had farmed in Herefordshire, but later had to give it up, living with the Spong family. They were known to wear loose clothing and sandals.  Imprisonment and protest  Dora Spong's parents supported her activism and that of her sisters. Their mother Frances Spong attended WSPU demonstrations. Initially working in the poorest areas of London, Tottenham and Battersea, Dora Spong was a nurse and midwife and sanitary inspector to slum residents. She was a member of the Independent Labour Party, Finsbury branch. She joined the Women's Social and Political Union, the suffragette activists, in 1908. votes for women poster Spong was involved in WSPU poster protests, where small groups of women carrying and selling Votes for Women or other publications for handing out could progress through London streets, raising awareness and publicity, with less risk of violent reactions from objectors, compared to mass demonstrations. A picture in the Museum of London (see above) shows Dora Spong with Dorothy Hartopp Radcliffe, Hilda Dallas and Charlotte Marsh with a placard promoting the Women's Parliament on 30 June 1908. Following that event, the suffragettes tried to march from Caxton Hall to the House of Commons into a crowd of around 10,000 who tried to harass them, with only 1700 police to keep order, and was amongst the seventy-five suffragettes were arrested in the ensuing aggression. Spong was charged for the first time the next day on 1 July 1908 for obstruction and sentenced to a month in Holloway prison, where her fellow members of Finsbury ILP wrote to her in support and 'admiration of the courage and determination in submitting to the onus of the prison cell in the women's cause'. She became ill and was released early. Another arrest with a hundred suffragettes marching on the House of Commons on 12 July 1909 has no complete record of her sentence. In 1911, Beedham (n√©e Spong) was one of the seventeen WSPU members of the forty-two signatories to the petition from Ellen Avery to Constance Lytton's brother Lord Lytton expressing gratitude for his faith in women's suffrage movement such that \\"in the years to come the Women of our Race - strong in the Freedom that you have done so much to win - will abundantly justify that faith.\\" Beedham's name was not found on the 1911 Census nor are her sisters apart from Annie (when many suffragettes refused to be 'counted' without the right to vote). In 1912 she was charged with breaking windows with a hammer, with Constance Moore who had a poker at Westbourne Grove Post Office. Their sentence was two months with hard labour in Holloway Prison. And only a month after her marriage, in November 1914, she was arrested at Black Friday; as with other suffragettes, no charges brought. Dora Beedham was given a Hunger Strike Medal 'For Valour'.

He was laid to rest on September 25, 2019 in his hometown of Cagayan de Oro and was given full military honors. The Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP), along with the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI), have already started an investigation on Dormitorio's death. The House of Representatives is also planning to conduct a congressional inquiry on this incident.  Cadet background  Cadet 4th class Dormitorio, who would have been a member of PMA Class 2023, was a 20-year old plebe of the Philippine Military Academy (PMA), the military school of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP). His father, retired Army Col. William Dormitorio, is a graduate of PMA Marangal Class of 1974. Dormitorio was the youngest of the three children and his parents described him as \\"very kind\\" and \\"just quiet.\\" Hazing incident Initial reports indicated that Dormitorio died from continuous vomiting after complaining of stomach pain while in his barracks in Fort Del Pilar, Baguio City. However, subsequent reports revealed that he was found unconscious in Room 209 at the PMA's Mayo Hall Annex, at around 3:40 AM of September 17, 2019. He was still rushed to the Fort del Pilar Hospital in Baguio City but was declared dead on arrival at around 5:15 AM. According to the PMA report, his cause of death was \\"blunt force trauma.\\" Dormitorio reportedly wrote a letter in late August 2019 telling his parents that he was confined in the hospital but was doing fine as he was adjusting to life in the PMA. The letter was later circulated on social media. He told them that they can visit him but if they weren't available, a visit from his brother or sister would be fine. He asked his parents for extra money to purchase uniforms, and asked that his brother or sister bring him pizza and doughnuts should one of them visit him. He also told his family that he missed them and Brando, their pet Doberman. He gave the letter to another cadet's mother so that it could reach his parents. The letter prompted Dormitorio's brother Dexter to visit him in the hospital on August 25, 2019. Dormitorio also wrote a report of the incident that happened on the night of August 21, 2019, detailing the punishment he got from PMA Cadets 3rd Class Shalimar Imperial and Felix Lumbag after spending half of his allowance. This was taken as an offense by the upperclassman cadets. Consequently, he was made to perform \\"pumping exercises\\" and \\"bridge under bunks.\\" Dormitorio fell down several times during one of these punishments, which prompted Lumbag to punch him in the ribs. On September 17, 2019, he was sent back to the hospital, where he was diagnosed with urinary tract infection and was later discharged the same day. According to Col. Allen Rae Co, Chief of Baguio Police Provincial Office, the victim was beaten up by the three suspects for losing Cadet First Class Axl Rey Sanopao's boots. Sanopao then ordered Imperial and Lumbag to \\"punish\\" the victim for not being able to find his boots. He was allegedly maltreated in the evening of September 17, 2019 by the two new suspects, who electrocuted his genitals using a taser flashlight.  Suspects  On September 26, 2019, the police identified but refused to reveal the names of two more PMA upperclassmen as additional suspects in Dormitorio's death, along with Sanopao, Imperial, and Lumbag. The police are expected to file a case against the suspects for violating Republic Act 1105 or the Anti-Hazing Act of 2018 and murder, as it was established that the suspects had been planning to harm the victim since August 19, 2019. A 2nd Class cadet was also added to the list of suspects on September 27, 2019, and another cadet was added on September 29, bringing the total to seven. The said suspect, who was also not identified, was the one who kicked the victim prior to his hospital confinement on September 1, 2019. The cadets were Cadet Imperial, Cadet Lumbay and Cadet Manalo. In popular culture This story was featured on the docudrama program Imbestigador in its 41st episode, \\"Dormitorio.\\" Darwin Dormitorio was portrayed by Martin del Rosario, while his brother Dexter Dormitorio was portrayed by Biboy Ramirez. Reactions = Government = During a press briefing on September 23, 2019, Presidential Spokesperson Salvador Panelo said that President Rodrigo Duterte was \\"angry\\" about the hazing incident, which occurred just a year after he signed the Anti-Hazing Act of 2018 into law. The President then vowed to deliver justice for the victim. However, a year after signing the law, Duterte stated in a press conference that removing hazing in educational institutions is impossible, describing such measure as \\"permanent insanity\\". In a statement, the Commission on Human Rights (CHR) called for the \\"total elimination\\" of hazing \\"in all schools and non-school-based organisations, including in military and army trainings\\" as it \\"curtails the right to life of individuals particularly the youth.\\" Its regional office in the Cordillera Administrative Region will conduct its own investigation into this incident. Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) Secretary Eduardo A√±o has also ordered the Philippine National Police (PNP) to be \\"transparent and not withhold information or whitewash\\" in investigating the hazing circumstances that led to the victim's death. = Police and armed forces = As a result of the incident, AFP Chief Lt. Gen. Noel Clement ordered the Inspector General of the Armed Forces to conduct a probe into the incident and to formulate changes in the PMA. Clement also asked all PMA cadets to undergo an orientation \\"to change their mindset, specifically in all their activities and dealings inside the academy.\\" PMA Superintendent Lt. Gen. Ronnie Evangelista and commandant of the Corps of Cadets Brig. Gen. Bartolome Vicente Bacarro have already tendered their resignation as a matter of \\"command responsibility.\\" Evangelista was replaced by Rear Admiral Allan Cusi while Bacarro was replaced by Brig. Gen. Romeo Brawner, the former commander of the Marawi-based 103rd Brigade. Meanwhile, Lt. Col. Cesar Candelaria and Capt. Flor Apple Apostol, who were in charge of the PMA station hospital that initially treated the victim, were also replaced by Lt. Col. Nerio Zabala as officer-in-charge. On September 28, PNP chief Gen. Oscar Albayalde condemned the hazing incident, calling it an \\"'affront' to what the institution stands for.\\" = Social media and public = In a tweet, Dormitorio's girlfriend Ashley Ravidas honored him by posing with his framed picture. \\"It's not easy loving a soldier, loving you has a high price to pay. I know my Cadet is watching over me, guiding me always. Continue serving up there, do what you love the most,\\" she tweeted. The hashtag #JusticeForDarwin was used by netizens to share their thoughts about the incident and about hazing as a \\"form of discipline.\\" Some slammed Senator Ronald \\"Bato\\" dela Rosa for \\"ignoring\\" anti-hazing laws. The parents of Horacio Castillo III, the 22-year old freshman from University of Santo Tomas (UST) who died as a result of hazing on September 17, 2017, urged legislators in Congress to amend the Anti-Hazing Act of 2018. The Anti-Hazing Act was crafted in response to Castillo's death. The Castillos urged lawmakers to define hazing as a \\"heinous crime,\\" hoping that it would \\"deter\\" those who plan to disregard and violate the said law. = Politics = Mayor Omaradji Pizarro of Kalilangan, Bukidnon, who is also Domitorio's uncle, called on legislators in Congress to review the implementation of the Anti-Hazing Act of 2018, which prohibits and penalizes hazing and regulates other forms of initiation rites in fraternities, sororities, and other organizations. Similarly, Cagayan de Oro 2nd District Representative Rufus Rodriguez filed a resolution to investigate Dormitorio's death in the Congress.'You're the kindest': PMA cadet na namatay sa hazing inalala ng pamilya, kaibigan  TV Patrol. 0:38-. Pero ang hinanakit ng mga magulang ni Darwin, hindi pinagbigay-alam sa kanila ang PMA ang lagay ng kadete. (...) Naghain na ng resolution si Cagayan de Oro 2nd District Representative Rufus Rodriguez para maimbestigahan na sa Kongreso ang pagkamatay ni Dormitorio. Several senators have also reacted to the incident. Panfilo Lacson, a member of PMA Class 1971, has dismissed calls for an inquiry into the incident, saying that the Anti-Hazing Act of 2018 was \\"very clear\\" and that the incident was \\"a clear violation of the Anti-Hazing Law as amended.\\" Ralph Recto called on the PMA to \\"relentlessly pursue\\" delivering justice to the victim while emphasizing that PMA cadets are \\"people's investments,\\" since producing one PMA graduate costs PHP 2.982 million. Ronald \\"Bato\\" dela Rosa lamented the resignation of Evangelista as head of PMA, calling him a \\"good officer whose career was wasted because of that very unfortunate incident.\\" Former Magdalo Representative Gary Alejano described Dormitorio's death an \\"isolated incident\\". Ako Bicol Representative Alfredo Garbin Jr. believed that the hazing can be only prevented if the suspects are arrested, charged, and convicted.

The book is one of the most popular works by Jim√©nez, and unfolds around a writer and his eponymous donkey, Platero (\\"silvery\\"). Platero is described as a \\"small donkey, a soft, hairy donkey: so soft to the touch that he might be said to be made of cotton, with no bones. Only the jet mirrors of his eyes are hard like two black crystal scarabs.\\" Platero remains a symbol of tenderness, purity and naivet√©, and is used by the author as a means of reflection about the simple joys of life, memories, and various characters and their ways of life.  Plot  Platero is a silver-colored donkey (\\"plata\\" means silver in Spanish) who throughout the years is seemingly the only constant friend and companion of the author, who makes observations to and confides in him. The author believes that Platero understands everything, except for the language of humans, just as humans do not know the language of animals, but he gives his master joy and sincere warmth.  Adaptations  Bronze statue of Platero. Work from sculptor Leon Ortega; Moguer, Spain. In 1960, the Italian composer Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco composed a suite of music for guitar with narrator based on the stories in the book.

It is native to eastern North America where it grows on hard bottoms in swiftly flowing rivers and streams and is considered a foundation species. Description The roots are green, fleshy and flattened, spreading finger-like over the surface of the rock to provide anchorage. The stems are closely packed together, being apart. The leaves have basal sheaths and boat-shaped leaf bases which extend into stipules. The petioles are slender and the leaf blades linear. The inflorescences are lateral, each individual flower being bilaterally symmetric. Each flower has two scale-like tepals that are shorter than the ovary, and a further tepal on top of the andropodium, between the two stamens. The ovary is set on a pedicel and orientated obliquely. The fruit is a two- chambered capsule. The actual form of the plant is rather variable, probably influenced by its environment; in one form the leaves are up to long, while in another they are stubby and clustered at the end of the stems. The stems vary as well, sometimes being hardened and blackish, contrasting with the bright green growth of the foliage in spring and summer. The leaves may become reddened or senescent in the winter. Distribution and habitat Podostemum ceratophyllum is found in eastern North America. Its range extends from Ontario and Quebec southwards to Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia. It also occurs in the Dominican Republic and in Honduras. It grows in fast flowing rivers and streams on rocky substrates at altitudes up to about . It is a foundation species in mid-sized montane and piedmont rivers. Ecology Hornleaf riverweed flowers in the summer when water levels drop and the plants become exposed to the air. After pollination, which is probably performed by wind or insects, the capsules take two or three weeks to mature. The seeds are small and sticky; they may adhere to hard substrates under water or may be carried elsewhere, stuck to the legs of birds. The plants grow fast and vigorously and provide habitat for many aquatic insects and their larvae, as well as Cnidaria, Turbellaria, Mollusca, Annelida, Hydrachnidia, Cladocera and Copepoda. Small fish feed on the invertebrates and freshwater snails graze on the foliage. It is also sometimes consumed by turtles, beavers and white-tailed deer. This plant affects its environment by altering water-flow and by encouraging the deposition of sediment. It also contributes to the detritus present, although the leaves decompose rapidly after being shed. It can be considered a foundation species, removing nutrients from the water, accumulating biomass, supplying food in the food chain and providing habitat. The plant is in decline in much of its range, but precisely why is unclear; changes in sedimentation or water quality may be involved, as may changes in water temperature and overgrowth by epiphytes. Whatever the reason for the decline, a decrease in hornleaf riverweed is likely to have considerable effects on the ecosystem.

It is historically the first Prague railway bridge over the Vltava and currently it is the second oldest Prague bridge over this river and its thirteenth downstream bridge in the capital. It is also the longest railway bridge and the third longest bridge in the Czech Republic. The viaduct was declared a Czech cultural monument in 1964.  History  = Construction = The Karl√≠n Viaduct was built as part of the Dresden branch of the Northern State Railways Olomouc-Prague-Dresden project, which was approved by the State Railways Directorate in 1842. The construction started in spring 1846, was completed in 1849 and the bridge was put into operation on 1 June 1850. The construction costs amounted to one and a half million Austro-Hungarian gulden. At that time the bridge had 87 stone arches, eight of which stood directly in the Vltava River. The railway line was double-tracked, in the second half of the 19th century a third shunting blind track has been laid.The current width is 110 meters. The width of the bridge deck between the stone railings is 7.6 m. The length is 1100 meters and until 1910 it was the Europe's longest bridge. The construction was to be entrusted to Jan Perner, who already led the construction of the line between Olomouc and Prague, but he unexpectedly died and Alois Negrelli took over the bridgework. The viaduct was built over the then unregulated river. Granite, mined in the Schwarzenberg Quarry, which is now flooded with the Orl√≠k Reservoir , was ferried from Kam√Ωk nad Vltavou and processed on site. The entire viaduct had vaults made of block masonry, Czech granite and pillar cladding were made of sandstone with granite blocks on the corners. The core of the masonry is made of quarry stone, the pillars are based on wooden gratings Up to 3000 workers of different nationalities participated in the construction. For the first time steam lifting machines were used to a greater extent. Worldwide, it was a quite unique building, since in many places at that time similar bridges were built from wood and not from granite. = Operation and maintenance = Later, houses were erected in close proximity to the bridge. With the growing industry, vacancies under its arches were filled with craft workshops and forwarding companies, mostly with built-in floors. In 1871 the bridge was extended on the south side by the Karl√≠n connecting viaduct to enable a direct connection between Bubny and Libe≈à. At the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries extensive adjustments were made to the Vltava River, and three branches under the Negrelli Viaduct near the former ≈†a≈°kovy ml√Ωny (≈†a≈°kovy mills) north of Pob≈ôe≈æn√≠ Street were back- filled. By the end of the 19th century, critics pointed out that the bridge was an obstacle to the development and permeability of the city. In 1952‚Äì1954, three bridge arches were demolished in the area of K≈ôi≈æ√≠kova Street to improve the throughput of motor vehicles. The newly created gap was bridged over by beamed lintels made of pre-stressed concrete. In 1981 a similar intervention was carried out on the Holesovice side, above the Bubenske embankment. The viaduct survived the August 2002 flood in full operation. = Reconstruction 2017‚Äì2021 = A major bridge reconstruction which started in 2017 is scheduled to be finished in 2021. The budgeted cost is 1,443 billion CZK (out of which 990 million CZK is funded by the European Union). It addresses the unsatisfactory condition of the bridge structure, the railway superstructure, the signaling, communication and heavy-current equipment and the overhead lines. At the same time preserving an important cultural monument.  References   See also  * Jan Fischer, Ond≈ôej Fischer: Pra≈æsk√© mosty. Academia, Praha 1985, , p. 29‚Äì34.

On 18 September 1962, the Ilyushin Il-14 operating this flight crashed shortly after takeoff. All 27 passengers and five crew members were killed. The Air Accident Investigation Commission determined that pilot error was the main cause of the accident. Accident Weather conditions at the time of the flight were poor. Visibility was 4-10km in light snow with a cloud base of 600-700 meters. Flight 213 departed Chersky Airport at 06:20. The normal procedure involved circling above the valley while climbing to an altitude above surrounding terrain. This procedure was not followed and the crew flew on a heading directly to Keperveyem Airport. At an altitude of 800 meters and climbing, flying in clouds the aircraft impacted a 975 meter tall mountain. The Ilyushin was destroyed and there was a post collision fire. There were no survivors. Aircraft Construction of the Il-14M involved, serial number 146000929 09-29, was completed at the Moscow Banner of Labor production factory in 1956 and it was transferred to the civil air fleet. It was powered by two Shvetsov ASh-82 radial engines and at the time of the accident, the aircraft had sustained a total of 9,858 flight hours.

As a juvenile in 2019 he won two minor races before taking the Prix de Cabourg and then moving up to the highest class to win the Prix Morny and the Middle Park Stakes. Background Earthlight is a chestnut colt with a broad white blaze and white socks on his hind legs bred in Ireland by Godolphin in whose blue colours he races. The colt was sent into training with Andr√© Fabre in France. He was from the eleventh crop of foals sired by Shamardal whose wins included the Dewhurst Stakes, Poule d'Essai des Poulains, Prix du Jockey Club and St. James's Palace Stakes. His other offspring have included Able Friend, Mukhadram, Lope de Vega and Blue Point. Earthlight is the first foal of his dam Winters Moon who won only one of her seven races but finished third in the Fillies' Mile and the Sweet Solera Stakes. Her dam Summertime Legacy won the Prix des R√©servoirs and produced the Group 1 winners Wavering (Prix Saint-Alary) and Mandaean (Crit√©rium de Saint-Cloud). She was a daughter of Zawaahy, a half-sister to Golden Fleece. Racing career =2019: two-year-old season= Earthlight was ridden in all of his races as a two-year-old by Mickael Barzalona. On his racecourse debut the colt was made the 1.1/1 favourite for a maiden race over 1100 metres at Maisons-Laffitte Racecourse on 19 June and won by a neck from Dutch Chop with a gap of four and a half lengths back to the other eight runners. Two weeks later at Deauville Racecourse he started odds-on favourite for the five-runner Prix de Caen over 1200 metres. After settling in third place he went to the front 200 metres from the finish and drew away in the closing stages to win in \\"comfortable\\" style by three and a half lengths. On 28 July, over the same course and distance, Earthlight was stepped up in class for the Group 3 Prix de Cabourg and started 1.3/1 favourite against four opponents. He raced in fourth place before moving up to take the lead 200 metres out and won \\"readily\\" by four lengths from Well of Wisdom. On 18 August at Deauville Earthlight started 2.4/1 second choice in the betting behind the filly Raffle Prize (winner of the Queen Mary Stakes and the Duchess of Cambridge Stakes) in the Group 1 Prix Morny. The other six runners included A'Ali (Norfolk Stakes, Prix Robert Papin), Arizona (Coventry Stakes), and Golden Horde (Richmond Stakes). After racing in mid-division as Raffle Prize set the pace, Earthlight moved up to challenge the favourite, gained the advantage in the last 200 metres and won by a neck. After the race Andr√© Fabre said that the colt would stay further and would probably be aimed at the 2000 Guineas. On 28 September, Earthlight was sent to England to contest the Miiddle Park Stakes over six furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse and started the 11/4 favourite. His eight opponents included Mums Tipple (an eleven-length winner of his last race), Siskin (Phoenix Stakes), Threat (Champagne Stakes), Monarch of Egypt (runner-up in the Phoenix Stakes), Lope Y Fernandez (Round Tower Stakes) and Golden Horde. Siskin was withdrawn from the race after becoming unruly in the starting stalls. Earthlight started quickly but then settled in mid-division before making a sustained run in the last quarter mile. He got the better of Golden Horde inside the final furlong and won by a neck with third and fourth places going to the outsiders Summer Sands and King Neptune. In the official rating of European two-year-olds for 2019 Earthlight was rated the second-best juvenile of the year, level with Kameko but ten pounds inferior to Pinatubo. =2020: three-year-old season= Earthlight was expected to begin his second campaign in the Prix de Fontainebleau at Longchamp on 11 May, the day on which racing resumed in France after the COVID-19 outbreak lockdown. On 6 May however it was announced that the colt would miss the race after sustaining a sprained fetlock in training. The colt made a belated seasonal debut in the Listed Prix Kistena over 1200 metres at Deauville on 12 July and started the 2/5 favourite against seven opponents. He took the lead 400 metres from the finish and drew away to win by two and a half lengths from Wanaway.

It flows south through boreal forests from the Canadian Shield to the Gulf of Saint Lawrence. In 2018 salmon fishing was banned on the river due to critically low stocks. Location The Jupitagon River flows south to the Saint Lawrence between the Magpie River to the east and the Tonnerre River to the west. The mouth of the river is in the municipality of Rivi√®re-Saint-Jean in the Minganie Regional County Municipality. The mouth is east of the village of Rivi√®re-au-Tonnerre. At the start of the 20th century there was a hamlet called Jupitagon at the mouth of the river where some fishermen's families lived. In 1903 there was a Eudist missionary station at the mouth of the river. P√®re Arthur Gallant (1896-1976) was a Eudist missionary at Rivi√®re- Saint-Jean with responsibility for the dessertes of Longue-Pointe-de-Mingan, Magpie and Jupitagon from 1928 to 1938. Today the location is used by vacationers. Name The Innu of Mingan call the river the Atshukupakatan Hipis or Atshukukupitan Hipis, meaning \\"little river with the sea-lion\\". On the 1744 map by Charlevoix, published by Jacques-Nicolas Bellin in the Histoire g√©n√©rale de la Nouvelle-France (General History of New France), the Jupitagon River is referred to as Ouapitougan. The name is written by different sources as Jupitagun, Jupitagan, Jupitagone and Chipitagun. Some say it is derived from the Innu language ouapitagon or shusshupitagan meaning \\"river with sharpening-stones\\". Others claim that the word is a distortion of the Cree and Atikamekw chiwitagan, which means \\"salt\\". Some 20th century authors think the name has the same origin as the Ouapitagone Archipelago, west, which some texts call Jupitagan. Basin The Jupitagon River watershed is elongated, with a north-south axis and a width up to downstream. It lies between the basins of the Tonnerre River to the west and the Magpie River to the east. It covers of the Minganie Regional County Municipality, divided between the unorganized territory of Lac-J√©r√¥me (47.1%) and the municipalities of Rivi√®re-Saint-Jean (34.0%} and Rivi√®re-au-Tonnerre (18.9%). A small part of the northern watershed is on the plateau of the Canadian Shield, where the land slopes steeply and reaches an elevation of . Most of the watershed is in the piedmont area to the south of the plateau, which falls from in elevation. This is a belt about wide of rounded rocky hills. The coastal plain is wide, relatively flat land that slopes from down to the shore of the Gulf of Saint Lawrence. The coastal plain and a small section to the northwest are on orthopyroxene granitoid rocks. The remainder is on an anorthosite massif. The bedrock of the plateau and the piedmont area is covered by an undifferentiated and discontinuous layer of glacial till no more than . On the coastal plain the Goldthwait Sea deposited large quantities of marine clay and silt sediments, which were later covered by sandy deltaic sediments. Hydrology The streams and rivers follow angular courses dictated by the fractures of the bedrock. On the plateau and in the piedmont area the rivers mostly flow through straight V-shaped valleys, although the Jupitagon River flows through an old U-shaped glacial valley in the center of the catchment area, where it has a winding course. On the coastal plain the river and its tributaries make many meanders through the loose sediment. The Jupitagon River runs for from north to south with a vertical drop of . It is generally narrow and shallow, apart from a few places such as Lake Atsuk about upstream and the base of the falls at its mouth. The annual average flow at its mouth is estimated as , varying from during the year. The river has two sizable tributaries, the Petite rivi√®re au Foin in the southeast part and an unnamed stream in the southwest. There are many water bodies, covering 8.22% of the watershed. Most are long and narrow, oriented from north to south. The Maloney, Belley, Panneau, Brochets and Martre lakes each have an area of just over . Ombrotrophic bogs cover 2.29% of the basin, mostly on the coastal plain. There are few flat surfaces further inland where wetlands can develop, and no large wetlands. Environment The Rivi√®re-au-Tonnerre weather station, from the mouth of the Jupitagon, reports an annual average temperature of and annual average rainfall of . Temperatures would be lower inland. A map of the ecological regions of Quebec shows the Jupitagon in sub-regions 6j-T and 6m-T of the east spruce/moss subdomain. Black spruce (Picea mariana) forest dominates the coastal plain. Inland in the piedmont and plateau area the forest is a mix of black spruce and balsam fir (Abies balsamea), with mossy groundcover. There was a serious infestation of hemlock looper moths (Lambdina fiscellaria) in the late 1990s and early 2000s which caused widespread defoliation of the fir trees. The north shore of the Gulf of Saint Lawrence from the mouth of the Jupitagon to Magpie harbor is the Waterfowl Concentration Area of the Jupitagon River, Magpie Harbor (Aire de concentration d'oiseaux aquatiques de la Rivi√®re Jupitagon, Havre de Magpie), designated an IUCN Management Category IV water fowl gathering area since 1998. It is managed by the Quebec Minist√®re des For√™ts, de la Faune et des Parcs. Fish The river looking south towards the Gulf from Quebec Route 138 An 1859 account said that salmon were plentiful. The downstream section of the Jupitagon River is known as an Atlantic salmon river, but there is an impassable fall within from its mouth, which would prevent migration. Between 1984 and 2017 annual reported catches of salmon peaked at 92 in 1990 and since then steadily declined, with an average of 4 per year in 2012‚Äì2016. Some of the decline may have been due to fishing restrictions. Other species are brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis), American eel (Anguilla rostrata), rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax) and three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). In May 2015 the Ministry of Forests, Wildlife and Parks of Quebec announced a sport fishing catch-and-release program for large salmon on sixteen of Quebec's 118 salmon rivers. These were the Mitis, Laval, Pigou, Bouleau, Aux Rochers, Jupitagon, Magpie, Saint-Jean, Corneille, Piashti, Watshishou, Little Watshishou, Nabisipi, Aguanish and Natashquan rivers. The Quebec Atlantic Salmon Federation said that the measures did not go nearly far enough in protecting salmon for future generations. In view of the rapidly declining Atlantic salmon population catch-and-release should have been implemented on all rivers apart from northern Quebec. On 1 April 2018 sport fishing for salmon in the Jupitagon River was prohibited, since the population was critically low. Fishing for other species was allowed, but if a salmon were caught it must be returned to the water.

He joined the Royal Navy in 1964 and after training, flew Sea Vixens. This was followed by tour with the US Navy, including the Top Gun course at the Fighter Weapons School at NAS Miramar. Consequently he was posted to HMS Ark Royal in 1974 as an Air Weapons Instructor, flying F-4K Phantoms.  Navy test pilot  During the development of the Sea Harrier, John Farley, (Hawker Siddeley's deputy chief test pilot) asked Fleet Air Arm for \\"one of your best youngsters off Ark Royal At this time HMS Ark Royal was just decommissioning\\" to be the Project Liaison Officer. As a result, Scott was posted to Dunsfold in 1977. There he quickly impressed John Farley, and was made the leader of the Sea Harrier cockpit development programme. In this programme, the Sea Harrier avionics were flight tested in a modified two seat Hunter.  Civilian test pilot  In 1979 he left the Royal Navy to join British Aerospace (BAe) as a Sea Harrier test pilot. In this role he was responsible for rationalising the Sea Harrier cockpit displays. At the start of the Falklands War Scott was instrumental in clearing the AIM-9L Sidewinder for use from the Sea Harrier. He also volunteered for active service, however this was refused. Instead he was placed on temporary recall and tasked with helping to re-form and train 809 NAS. He returned to BAe and in 1983 was appointed Sea Harrier Project Test Pilot. In October 1987 Scott was promoted to Deputy Chief Test Pilot. On 22 October 1987 Scott was carrying out the final pre-delivery test flight of Harrier GR. 5 ZD325, before handover to the Royal Air Force. A malfunction of the parachute-deployment rocket ejected him from the aircraft at 30,000 ft. His parachute was damaged and he was killed in the fall. The explanation put forward by the inquest was, that when Scott lowered his seat to reduce glare on the instrument panel, the manual override (MOR) had been activated by a loose object under the MOR rocket operating rod. In March 1990 a BAe memorandum relating to the cause of this incident was briefly discussed in the House of Commons by Alan Clark.  Personal life  He married Margaret A. Hayes in 1972 and together they had two children.

Petrongolo previously worked at the London School of Economics, the Paris School of Economics and the Universidad Carlos III (Madrid). Petrongolo's economic research focuses on labour economics.  Education and work  Petrongolo was born in Pisa, Italy. She began studying economics at the University of Pisa and Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna, where she acquired her Bachelor of Arts in 1993. She continued her studies in economics through the London School of Economics. Petrongolo obtained her Masters of Science (MSc) in Economics in 1994 and her Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degree in Economics in 1998.http://personal.lse.ac.uk/petrongo/cv-mar2017.pdf In 1997, Petrongolo became employed as an assistant professor in economics at the Universidad Carlos III in Madrid.

She then joined Queen Mary University of London in 2010 as a professor of economics, where she currently teaches.  Selected publications  = \\"How Local Are Labour Markets? Evidence from a Spatial Job Search Model\\" (2017) = Barbara Petrongolo and co-author Alan Manning analyzed search strategies of the unemployed to determine if labour markets were local or not. They discuss how local labour market policies must be appropriate for the size of the market it is targeting in order to be effective. They also created their own model to address the fact that the economy cannot be separated into non-overlapping segments, as previous models have done. This allowed them to test how local shocks effect labour demand and labour mobility. As previous literatures evaluated the economy as non-overlapping segments, it did not lead to the correct conclusion of whether labour markets were local or not. With Petrongolo and Manning's new overlapping model, they were able to characterize the job searching strategies of the unemployed. They found that job seekers are influenced by the cost of the distance to the job as well as their applications expected success rate. Their expected success rate is determined by how many other job seekers in the market are interested in the same job as them. They used the UK labour market to conduct their empirical research. The study found that distance, which is measured using commuting cost or time, discourages workers from applying for jobs. Areas with high application competition also discouraged people from applying for jobs. The study concluded that local location-based labour policies are not effective in decreasing unemployment because labour markets overlap. A more effective alternative is to provide hiring subsidies to the unemployed as it increases their chances of beating the competition. = \\"Gender Gaps and the Rise of the Service Economy\\" (2017) = Petrongolo co-authored this research paper with L. Rachel Ngai. This paper looked at the post World War II era and how the female participation in the U.S. labour market has changed. More specifically, they looked at how structural transformation and marketization has increased female work hours and wages causing an increase in the role of services as well as an increase in female workforce participation. The study found that the increase in female labour force participation was closely related to structural transformation and marketization and that the fall in male work has partially contributed to the rise in female work. Historically, men have had a comparative advantage in good-producing sectors such as manufacturing, construction, and utilities because men are better endowed with \\"brawn\\" skills. This was accompanied with women having a comparative advantage in the services sector because it required \\"brain\\" skills, not \\"brawn\\" skills. With a structural transformation causing the services sector to broaden, women were able to get more work hours. Secondly, women generally specialized in home production. It was suggested in the paper that home production activities and market services were close substitutes. Therefore as the service market expanded, women would shift out of home production and into the services sector. Petrongolo and Ngai found that marketization attracts women into the workforce while structural transformations creates the job openings that women need. These effects are able to partially explain the decrease in the gender wage gap and the increase in female workforce participation. = \\"The Economic Consequences of Family Policies: Lessons from a Century of Legislation in High-Income Countries\\" (2017) = Petrongolo and Claudia Olivetti co-authored this paper together. The paper aimed to analyze the effects that family policies have on female workforce participation. The researchers studied the consequences that past policies have had on female workforce participation using tools such as parental leave and other forms of family aid, beginning from the end of the 19th century. Petrongolo and Olivetti found that within the last century, labour markets have been changing in high-income nations. There has been an increase of females in the workforce which has led to a decrease in the gender wage gap. Petrongolo and Olivetti looked at events such as industrialization and demographic transitions and how they impacted women's workforce participation. Petrongolo and Olivetti found that by the beginning of the 21st century, most high-income nations have implemented some sort of parental leave and family benefit policies in hopes of increasing fertility and child development. They concluded that the most effective family policies to increase female workforce participation and decrease the gender wage gap, are policies that increase early childhood spending. Such policies focus on increasing spending of early education and childcare.

Description  From The Hartford Courant: :\\"Max Ernst's 1937 \\"The Barbarians\\" shows a bird-creature with a half-human, half-something. Are they battling? Commiserating? Whichever, they tower over the human below them.\\" Ernst's Surrealist paintings are steeped in Freudian metaphor, private mythology, and childhood memories. One of his major themes centered on the image of the bird, which often incorporated human elements. Although some of these birds look benign, their mere presence appears to be ominous. He first coupled birds and windblown, apocalyptic animals in a series of small works entitled The Horde (1927), and he resumed the theme in 1935 in a series of even smaller paintings called The Barbarians, to which the present one belongs. In his biography of the artist, John Russell identified these creatures as expressions of Ernst's fearful anticipation of the impending devastation in Europe during World War II. In this small painting, a gigantic, malevolent-looking bird couple marches forward with seemingly mile-long strides. The dark female leads the way as her male companion turns to look at the strange animal-perhaps their offspring-clinging to his left arm. In the far distance, a tiny woman holds onto some undefined winged being. The strange patterns on the bodies of the main figures, which evoke fossils or geological formations, are the result of grattage (scraping). In this technique, the artist coated the canvas, or in this case, a piece of cardboard, with layers of paint and while it was still wet pressed it against objects that left imprints on the surface. Afterward, he used a brush to touch up the forms thus created, or scraped away layers of pigment.

She is noteworthy for being one of the first Canadian women, and one of the first women in the world post WWII, to fly a fighter jet, along with her contemporary, Dee Brasseur.  Biography  Foster joined the Canadian Forces in 1982 as one of the candidates in a trial program called SWINTER (Service- Women in Non-Traditional Environments and Roles.) SWINTER ran from 1979 to 1984, to assess whether women were competent to serve in various military roles. As part of SWINTER, Foster trained as a pilot and received her military wings in 1984. Upon completion of her training, she was posted to the 2 Canadian Forces Flying Training School (2CFFTS) in Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan. She worked as an instructor at 2CFFTS for four years; in 1988, she was selected to be in the first cadre of female pilots to fly Canada's McDonnell Douglas CF-18 Hornet, commonly known as the CF-18 Fighter Jets. One other woman, Dee Brasseur, was selected for the program at the same time. The program was heavily condensed, and \\"crammed a four-year university course into one year.\\" It required study of up to 18 hours a day on the CF-18 controls. Foster received combat-ready status after six months. On February 20, 1989, a Canadian Human Rights Tribunal declared that the Canadian Forces were obligated to remove \\"any remaining employment restrictions base on sex, with the exception of submarine duty.\\" While Foster and Brasseur were already enrolled in the training, the public commitment to women's integration in the Canadian Forces was supported by their participation in the CF-18 training. On June 20, 1989, Foster and Brasseur officially became the first Canadian women to fly fighter jets.  Historic Achievement and Controversy  When their training was complete in 1989, Foster and Brasseur became the first women anywhere in the world to fly fighter jets since the end of the Second World War. They also became the first Canadian women and the first female members of NATO to fly fighter jets, as the earlier WW2 female fighter pilots had exclusively served in the Soviet Union. Colonel David Jurkowski, their commander, told the Canadian Press they were \\"the only women in the world, to our knowledge, in that unique position.\\" As a member of 441 Tactical Fighter Squadron, a NORAD unit, she participated in the intercept and escort of the first Soviet aircraft, a MiG-29 Fulcrum, to fly in Canadian airspace. She was one of six Canadian CF-18 pilots to fly in a Rim of the Pacific military exercise, where Canadian fighter jets had to simulate defensive measures against an attacking force attempting to destroy Comox, British Columbia. The emergence of Foster and Brasseur as CF-18 pilots caused some public controversy. Ed Vanwoudenberg, the leader of the Christian Heritage Party of Canada, claimed that God did not intend for women to engage in high-speed flight, and that the force of the planes would damage their fertility.  Later career  After flying the fighter jets for a year, Foster opted to transition into a ground job by choice, mentioning that operating the aircraft was \\"a little frightening.\\" She did not participate in any combat missions as a military pilot. Foster temporarily left the RAF from 1992 to 1999, raising her two children. From 1999 to 2006 she served as a part-time reservist; in 2006, she rejoined 2CFFTS as an instructor, where she taught and flew the CT-156 Harvard II.

It lies where Penobscot Bay and Blue Hill Bay meet, between Swan's Island and Isle au Haut. Uninhabited, it is one of the largest undeveloped islands surrounding the contiguous United States. History Development of the island was explored in the 1980s, with wells drilled for 14 potential properties, but these plans fell through due to a weak real estate market. The island was purchased in three parcels by the Maine Coast Heritage Trust in 2003 and 2004 for a total cost of $6.3 million. Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the unorganized territory has a total area of 5.5 square miles (14.1 km¬≤), of which 1.6 square miles (4.1 km¬≤) is land and 3.9 square miles (10.1 km¬≤) is water (71%). Covering 985 acres, Marshall Island is the 11th largest island in Maine. It is almost entirely forested, apart from a pair of discontinued runways. While it has a primarily rocky coast, it also has more than ten beaches, the largest of which is located on the southeastern side of the island in Sand Cove. Activities Maine Coast Heritage Trust has turned the island into Ed Woodsum Preserve, which is open to the public. The land trust has campsites available on the island, and maintains hiking trails that surround and cross the island. It also advertises the island as an ideal location for boating, birdwatching and swimming at its sandy beaches. The island is also open to hunting and fishing.

The earthquake struck at 07:46:44 Eastern Indonesia Time (23:46:44 on 25 September UTC) with a shallow depth of 18 km. The tremor could be felt throughout the island, with an intensity of very strong (VII) reportedly felt in the provincial capital of Ambon. In the aftermath of the quake, severe damages were reported throughout the island. More than 6,000 structures were damaged or destroyed throughout Maluku. A total of 41 people were killed by the quake and another 1,578 people were injured. More than 150,000 people evacuated and set makeshift camps due to aftershocks and fear of building collapse. As of 6 October, more than a week after the earthquake, approximately 1,105 aftershocks had been recorded by local geological stations in Maluku. Earthquake According to the Indonesian Meteorology, Climatology, and Geophysical Agency (BMKG), the earthquake's epicenter was located inland of Seram Island, some northeast of the city of Ambon, the capital of Maluku and 10 km from the town of Kairatu. BMKG reported a magnitude of 6.8, while the United States Geological Survey (USGS) reported a 6.5 earthquake. It struck at 23:46:44 UTC, with a depth of according to the USGS. BMKG later revised the magnitude of the earthquake to 6.5. The agency reported that the earthquake was caused by a strike slip fault mechanism. Indonesian National Earthquake Centre reported that the fault that was responsible for the quake hadn't been previously mapped by scientists. They stated that the fault had \\"shifted\\" due to deformation on the fault. The fault, however, was not considered as a new fault. The Indonesian Institute of Sciences stated that energy released by the earthquake was equivalent to that released in the 1945 nuclear bombing of Hiroshima. Strong shaking were felt in the provincial capital of Ambon and in several other regencies in Maluku. Following the earthquake, roads were jammed with vehicles as mass panic occurred throughout Ambon. Panicked residents of Ambon had attempted to rush to higher ground due to tsunami fears, though BMKG stated that there was no risk of a tsunami. Several people were injured in the chaos and a woman was reportedly killed after she fell from her motorcycle during the evacuation. Road accidents reportedly occurred due to the mass panic. A man was apprehended by police for yelling \\"tsunami\\" out loud in the midst of a crowd of evacuees. The Indonesian BMKG disclosed the information of the intensity of the earthquake felt by the resident in Maluku, with an intensity of V (moderate) in the provincial capital of Ambon and II (weak) in Banda Islands. The USGS, however, reported that the intensity of the earthquake was VII (very strong) in Ambon and its surrounding area. =Aftershocks= By morning of 27 September, BMKG reported that they have detected 239 aftershocks. On 6 October, the agency reported that more than 1,000 aftershocks had been recorded, of which the strongest was a magnitude 5.6, which struck Ambon at a depth of 10 km, less than an hour after the mainshock. On 11 October, a 5.2 magnitude earthquake struck Ambon at a depth of 10 km. The quake struck with a strike-slip mechanism, with its epicenter located offshore, approximately 16 km east of the city. The powerful quake managed to damage several buildings in Ambon. Several buildings including a music shop and an ICU suffered significant damages and a high school reportedly collapsed, killing a student. A government-owned office building also reportedly collapsed due to the aftershock. A total of 8 people were injured in the aftershock. Due to the powerful aftershock, shops were closed and dozens of people evacuated. Damage A damaged hallway in Pattimura University, Ambon In the immediate aftermath of the earthquake, significant damages were reported in the provincial capital Ambon. Ambon's iconic Merah Putih Bridge, then the longest bridge in Eastern Indonesia, suffered cracks on its expansion joint. Buildings in Pattimura University, Ambon's oldest university, suffered cracks on the walls and caved ceilings. State Islamic University of Ambon reported cracks and wall collapse. The university's auditorium and library were also damaged in the quake. A lecturer and a student were injured and taken to the hospital, while another lecturer and another student were reportedly killed due to fallen debris. A major fire was also reported in a neighborhood in Ambon. Malls and public institutions reported slight damages. Places of worship such as churches and mosques also reportedly suffered slight damages In Tulehu, a floating market collapsed onto the sea due to the shaking. Patients in Tulehu Hospital were evacuated to Darussalam University due to the damages in the hospital. In Central Maluku Regency, the main hospital, dr. H. Ishak Umarella Regional Hospital, suffered significant damages. Fearing that the hospital might collapse, emergency tents were set up outside of the hospital, with patients treated outside. Hundreds of houses were severely damaged in Central Maluku Regency. At least 4 villages reported moderate to heavy damages to many homes and structures in the villages. Soil liquefaction was reported in a village in Ambon, with mud and \\"coral\\" spewing out from the ground. There were also reports on multiple sand boil in the village. Rockfalls and landslides were also reported in the region. At least one person was killed after a landslide struck an elementary school in Ambon. Another 8 people were killed after a mine collapse onto miners in Ambon. Ambon's local disaster mitigation agency reported 25,000 people in temporary shelters following the earthquake, with 224 houses reported damaged. On 3 October, the figure rose to 6,000 damaged houses, of which nearly 2,000 were severely damaged or destroyed. Further examination revealed that more than 6,700 structures across the region were damaged or destroyed in the quake. Preliminary report showed that a total of 21 schools were damaged in Ambon. As of 9 October, at least 172 schools and campus were damaged, most of which reportedly suffered moderate damage. Casualties By the evening of 27 September, local time, 23 fatalities had been confirmed from the earthquake, primarily due to falling rubble from damaged buildings. Over a hundred people were reportedly wounded. A majority of the casualties occurred in the Central Maluku Regency, where 14 deaths were reported. On 29 September 2019, seven other people were found dead or had succumbed to their injuries, bringing the death toll to 30. Four more deaths were announced on September 30. The death toll rose to 36 on October 2 and 38 on October 4. On October 8, at least 39 people were declared dead, with 1,578 reported injuries. 41 deaths were finally reported on October 18. Response President of Indonesia Joko Widodo expressed his condolences for the earthquake, and stated that affected victims would have their medical fees covered by the government. At least 2,000 emergency packages were sent to Maluku. The Indonesian National Board for Disaster Management released Rp 1 billion ( USD 70,000) in immediate funding and Rp 515 million in logistical support. The Ministry of Social Affairs released a further Rp 1.1 billion in funds, later announced that those who had relatives killed by the quake would be compensated with a total of Rp15 million rupiah. The Indonesian Ministry of Public Works and Public Housing provided sanitation and gallons of drinkable water to Maluku. The Ministry announced that \\"habitable houses\\" will be built in Maluku to those who had lost their homes in the quake. Approximately 3,000 houses will be built across 11 cities and regencies in Maluku. Immediately after the disaster, the provincial government of Maluku declared a state of emergency for 14 days. It later made a plea to Jakarta to help with the rehabilitation process. Four days after the earthquake, Ambon local government declared a disaster declaration for 2 weeks. On 9 October, due to the increasing number of evacuee, the provincial government of Maluku extended the state of emergency to an unspecified time amount. The local government of Ambon, however, stated that they would not extend the state of emergency , effectively ending the state of emergency period in Ambon on 9 October. Due to the \\"unusual\\" number and \\"aggressiveness\\" of earthquakes and aftershocks in the region, the Indonesian National Disaster Mitigation Agency announced that it would conduct a joint study with experts from Bandung Institute of Technology (ITB) on the seismic zone and the fault mechanism in the area. Consequently, a total of 11 seismographs were installed in the region. The study later proposed an earthquake-proof structural design for educational institutions in Indonesia. The agency also announced that a total of Rp 2 billion rupiah of emergency funds would be provided to ease the relief efforts in Maluku. It also provided economic relief programs to the evacuees. The Indonesian National Police sent logistics and essential supplies to the evacuees. The Regional Police of Maluku provided trauma healing and counseling to treat PTSD, with check-ups routinely held every day. Multiple political parties, community organisations and universities also sent aids to Maluku. Perempuan Bangsa (Nation's Women), which is under the affiliation of Indonesian National Awakening Party, assisted with emotional counseling for the affected. National Democrat Party (Nasdem) sent a team of medical health professionals to Maluku. Government-owned health insurance company BPJS and major aid organisation Rumah Zakat sent hundreds of logistics to Maluku. Meanwhile, University of Indonesia sent the local government of Ambon an Earthquake Warning Alert System (EWAS). Fundraisers were also set up by youth organisations in the country. Moluccan community in Waalwijk, Netherlands made a plea to the local government to send aid to Ambon. The majority of the council members overwhelmingly accepted the motion. Ex-senator from Netherlands' GroenLinks Party Samuel Richard Pormes stated that he hoped for the willingness of the Indonesian National Disaster Mitigation Agency to cooperate for the aids distribution. There were many complaints from evacuees that they had not received aids, donations and logistics from the government. Maluku's government admitted that relief effort and aids delivery were hampered due to the inaccessibility of some villages in the region. They later added that there was a shortage of blankets, tarps and tents in some evacuation centres. On 29 October, 9 days after his second inauguration, Indonesian President Joko Widodo visited several evacuation centres in Maluku to check with the evacuees. He stated that the government would send more aids and emergency funds and that houses that had been either damaged or destroyed would be rebuilt or repaired. A total compensation of Rp50 million would be handed to those who had their houses heavily damaged by the quake, while a total of Rp25 million and Rp10 million would be handed to those with moderate and slight damages, respectively. He later promised that the aid funds would be available for the evacuees in 6 months.

The first US edition was published in 1967 by Harper & Row, and the UK edition in 1968 by Hodder & Stoughton. A second collection of stories followed in 1982 under the title Mr. Calder and Mr. Behrens.  Stories  The book contains the following stories, most of which were originally published in Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine between 1962 and 1967: * \\"Game without Rules\\" * \\"The Road to Damascus\\" * \\"On Slay Down\\" * \\"The Spoilers\\" * \\"The Cat Cracker\\" * \\"Trembling's Tours\\" * \\"The Headmaster\\" * \\"Heilige Nacht\\" * \\"Upon the King...\\" * \\"Cross-Over\\" * \\"Prometheus Unbound\\" * \\"A Prince of Abyssinia\\"  Principal characters  The collection features two of Gilbert's most popular characters, the amiable and elderly spies Daniel John Calder and Samuel Behrens. The third member of the team is Mr Calder's Persian deerhound, Rasselas, a ferocious creature of at times distinctly superhuman intelligence.  Literary criticism  The mystery critic Anthony Boucher called Game without Rules the second-best volume of spy short stories ever published, next only to Somerset Maugham's Ashenden. Kirkus Reviews considered the book to be a coup, a \\"stellar collection of short stories in a very difficult form ‚Äî episodes and espionage\\". The reviewer thought the stories to be highly diverting and sometimes touching. The New York Times Book Review called the stories \\"entertaining and exciting\\", and found it hard to say which element was the most effective: the smooth ingenuity of plotting, the disconcerting combination of elegance and harshness, or the shock of amoral realism. The New Yorker opined that Gilbert \\"has given us an evening of pure joy in this collection of tales\\". And Life Magazine praised the author's almost perfect timing and surprise, elegance of language, and general sense of economy. In their encyclopedic Catalogue of Crime, Barzun and Taylor noted that while the story-telling is first-rate, \\"the genre seems to us more liable to repetition of effects than crime and detection\\". In a 1984 essay, George N Dove considered that one of the reasons for the lasting popularity of Calder and Behrens was the happy contrast between their outward appearance of elderly, quiet gentility and the pair's ability to take forceful action.

A policemen followed Burbridge to a nearby doctor and overheard her confess to the doctor as to how she became burned, and where she left the chemical, which was collected in evidence. Burbridge's case at the Marylebone Police Court, was defended by Arthur Marshall, husband of Kitty Marshall, who in leading her defence, emphasised Burbridge's role as the main earner for her father and sister, as a typist, and her suffering and pain. The magistrate noted the \\"peculiar circumstances\\" and she was bound over to keep the peace rather than imprisoned. The news of her action and injury spread as far as Australia, under the headline \\"The Biter Bitten\\" and in another report the magistrate was quoted as calling her \\"a poor deluded dupe'.

Rev. He served in pastoral ministries at University Presbyterian Church in Seattle, Union Church in Manila, First Presbyterian Church of Berkeley, and The National Presbyterian Church in Washington, D.C. Palmer is known for his expositional preaching and teaching style. He has a strong interest in pursuing theological themes that are present in classic and contemporary literature, with focus on authors such as C.S. Lewis, J.R.R. Tolkien, Karl Barth, and Dietrich Bonhoeffer. Palmer has written over 20 books, and served on the boards of Princeton Theological Seminary, New College Berkeley, Whitworth University and Regent College.  Early life  Palmer was born in McCloud, California to parents, Lewis Ward Palmer and Myrtle Elizabeth Hovey Palmer. He is named after his uncle, Earl and his grandfather, Frank Hovey, who drove the Wells Fargo Stage Coach on the mountain trail from Northern California to Southern Oregon. The second of four children, he joined his older brother, Lewis Ward Jr. and was joined later with the birth of two sisters, Nancy Elizabeth and Marian Lee. Palmer was baptized as an infant in the Episcopal Church as in Yreka, California and in his youth attended his hometown McCloud Community Presbyterian Church just up the street from his home. Living in the shadow of Mount Shasta he climbed the 14,179 foot mountain over 50 times, on one occasion he climbed it twice in one day. For his summer work during college he worked as a compass man for the McCloud River Lumber Company throughout the Northern California forests.  Education  Palmer graduated from University of California, Berkeley with a bachelor of arts in political science as a pre-law major in 1953. As a sophomore, it was through a men's Bible study in his dorm that led him to make a commitment to the Christian Church. He became an active member of the fellowship at First Presbyterian Church. In his senior year, he met with Dr. Robert Boyd Munger and shared that he was thinking about being a minister. This pastor encouraged Palmer to consider Princeton Theological Seminary where he eventually earned his Bachelor of Divinity Degree in 1956 (now defined as a Master of Divinity). Palmer has also receoved honorary decorates from Seattle Pacific University and Whitworth University.  Ministry career  = University Presbyterian Church = Upon graduation in 1956 from Princeton Theological Seminary, Palmer accepted the position as pastor to high school and college students at University Presbyterian Church (UPC) in Seattle. He later returned to Seattle in 1991 when received the call to be Senior Pastor at UPC. = Union Church of Manila = In March of 1964, Palmer was called to be the pastor of Union Church in Manila ‚Äì a post he held for the next 6 years. Palmer claims that, \\"the Manila years were deeply formative as I learned to preach to an international community and serve as a solo pastor to a congregation of over five hundred.\\" His time there also included a teaching post at Union Theological Seminary in the Cavite Province with an opportunity every week to explore the New Testament with the students. In 1969 he was invited by the Navy Chaplains of the Seventh Fleet assigned to Vietnam to travel to Saigon and DaNang to meet with them as they served in the Vietnam War. = First Presbyterian Church of Berkeley = Palmer and his family returned to the United States from Manila in response to the call in 1970 to be pastor at First Presbyterian Church of Berkeley (FPCB). There, Palmer met the challenge that he describes as \\"turbulent\\" due to political and social unrest amongst Berkeley students. Earl's 21 years there were spent ministering to those students and the congregation at large. Palmer also travelled with his family to do Ministry in South Africa, Australia, South East Asia, China, Russia and Europe. = New College Berkeley = While at Berkeley, Palmer, along with David W. Gill, co-founded an interdenominational graduate school of theology for laypersons. New College for Advanced Christian Studies, later renamed New College Berkeley, was founded in 1977. = National Presbyterian Church = In the fall of 2008, 10 days after he retired from University Presbyterian Church, he boarded a plane and headed to Washington D.C. to serve as Preaching Pastor in Residence at The National Presbyterian Church. Palmer had the opportunity to connect with many Christian organizations speaking at retreats and events in the area surrounding the nation's capital. He returned to his home in Seattle in June of 2010. = Earl Palmer Ministries = When Palmer retired from University Presbyterian Church in 2008, a group of individuals encouraged Palmer to remain active and founded Earl Palmer Ministries (EPM), a not for profit organization created with the goal of continuing Palmer's activities as a teacher and preacher. EPM seeks to mentor young theologians through an internship program and monthly theological dialogues, produce live podcasts through the Kindlings Muse and offer regular teaching and conversation for all ages to consider major Christian themes. EPM also puts on Word and Worship to provide a setting for expositional teaching of the Bible and music. Earl Palmer Ministries wider ministry focuses primarily on encouraging pastors and giving a case for expositional worship. The idea for Earl Palmer Ministries was borne from the example of John Stott Ministries, founded in order for the late John Stott to continue doing ministry after he retired from the pulpit. = Today = As of 2020, Palmer remains actively involved in ministry through EPM and as an expositor of the Bible and authors such as C.S. Lewis, Karl Barth, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, J.R.R. Tolkien, George Herbert as well as many others. He continues to preach, write and teach in the Seattle area and around the world.  Family life  Earl and Shirley Palmer Palmer met Shirley Green Palmer in Seattle and asked her to be his wife. According to Palmer, \\"it was love at first sight\\" and they were married on June 14, 1958. They welcomed their first child in 1962. While in Manila from 1964-1970, they had their second and third children. While Palmer was developing his skills as a pastor, Shirley, with her education in public health, reached out to the rural barrios and worked with the families to improve nutrition under the auspices of the World Health Organization teaching cooking classes using local foods and encouraging young mothers in the care of their children. She worked as junior high counselor at The American School of Manila as well as providing hospitality for the church community in their home located next door to the sanctuary. While living in the San Francisco-East Bay area Shirley returned to her field to combine her public health background and her educational credentials to become Supervisor of Health Services, Curriculum and Programs in the Richmond Unified School District. While Palmer was Senior Pastor in Seattle, his children left for college and married, Shirley returned to graduate school and earned her Ph.D. in Organizational Theory/Analysis in the College of Education and Department of Leadership and Policy Studies from the University of Washington in 2002. Earl lives with his wife Shirley in Seattle, Washington, and their three adult children and 8 grandchildren live nearby.  Legacy  = The Earl Palmer Collection = Earl with Kenneth Henke (Special Collections director at PTS) in the PTS Library's climate-controlled archival vault. The Earl Palmer Collection within the Theological Commons at the Princeton Theological Seminary Library represents a collaboration between Earl Palmer Ministries and Princeton Theological Seminary. This collection contains over 3500 audio and video recordings and selected writings by Rev. Earl Palmer, an alumnus and former member of the Board of Trustees of Princeton Theological Seminary. For years, Earl's study assistants, family members, friends, and staff at the seminary's library helped in the collection, organization and archival of almost all of Earl's work over his 65+ years in ministry. The physical and digital materials are stored in state of the art cloud servers, and temperature controlled archival rooms.left = The Palmer House = The Palmer House Exterior Officially named The Earl and Shirley Palmer Center for Student Ministry, the Palmer House was strategically planned for 15 years, and finally completed in 2019. Earl Palmer originally had thought of creating a space where college students at the University of Washington and other surrounding universities could find home away from home. Owned by University Presbyterian Church, this building was transformed from law offices into a coffee house and community space. Currently, the main space of the house holds the coffee bar and the larger gathering area. The second floor holds offices the college ministry at UPC, The Inn, and Young Life College. The house is managed by five female students who live in the top floor apartment. It also features a commercial grade kitchen, a conference room, a prayer room and two lounge spaces. On the front of the building, a plaque bares this inscription in honor of Earl and Shirley Palmer: > \\"Rev. Palmer served University Presbyterian Church as the Senior Pastor from > 1991 - 2008 and as the Pastor to students from 1956 - 1964. He is known for > his outstanding expository preaching, proficiency as a scholar of > contemporary literature, passion for discipline University students, and > abiding faith in Christ. This building, named in honor of Reverend Earl > Palmer and his wife, Dr. Shirley Palmer, will be used to impact future > generations of students with the gospel of Jesus Christ and will serve as a > legacy to their outstanding leadership and faithful ministry.\\" = The Berkeley Palmer Lectureship = In May of 2018, First Presbyterian Church of Berkeley and New College Berkeley launched an annual lectureship in honor of the Reverend Earl F.

He flew 50 missions, and was awarded the Air Medal for heroism six times. After being shot down in 1945, he was captured in Austria and subsequently lynched by a mob. He was posthumously awarded the Congressional Gold Medal in 2007. Manning is the only known black man to have been lynched in Austria during World War II. Military service = World War II = The Tuskegee Airmen's aircraft had distinctive markings that led to the name, \\"Red Tails\\". In 1942 Manning was rejected for military service because of a hammer toe. Manning used his savings to pay for surgery to repair his toe so that he could enlist. In 1943 he enlisted in the Army Air Force. in 1944, after graduation, he was assigned to the 301st Fighter Squadron, 332nd fighter Group with the rank of 2nd lieutenant. He served as a pilot from Ramitelli Air Base, Italy. =Dogfight= Manning was involved in a dogfight with Nazi planes on Easter morning, April 1, 1945, over the Danube River. Tuskegee Airmen escorted B-24 bombers on a bombing mission to St. Polten, Austria. On the return trip to their base at Ramitelli Air Field in Italy, the group spotted enemy planes near Wels, Austria. There were seven Tuskegee Airmen flying the mission that day and they engaged the German planes. The Tuskegee Airmen shot down 12 German planes in the dogfight. However three of the Tuskegee Airmen's planes were shot down: one pilot was able to make crash-land in friendly territory, one was killed outright when he was shot down, and the third pilot was Manning: his plane was damaged so badly that he had to bail out. He parachuted into a waiting mob. =Lynching= On April 3, 1945, Manning was captured and jailed in Austria at a Nazi Luftwaffe Air Force base near Linz. A gang of citizens helped by Luftwaffe officers broke into the jailhouse and tied Manning's hands behind his back. They dragged Manning outside and beat him badly. They hung a wooden tablet around his neck that read \\"We help ourselves! The Werewolf\\", and they hanged him from a lamppost. After the end of war the body of Walter Manning was recovered by US troops. Although they found clear signs of murder US officials closed his case early. Nobody was ever sentenced for the war crime. = Research and commemoration = In 2013 the Austrian historians Nicole-Melanie Goll and Georg Hoffmann carried out a research project together with Jerry Whiting to clarify the fate of Walter Manning. As a result of their findings the Austrian Army raised a commemoration plaque at the place where Walter Manning was murdered. =Awards= *Air Medal for heroism with 5 Oak Leaf Clusters, *European‚ÄìAfrican‚ÄìMiddle Eastern Campaign Medal (EAME) *Purple Heart Medal. *Congressional Gold Medal (2007) (posthumously) Education *Attended Howard University *Tuskegee Institute (1944) Personal life Manning was born in Baltimore, Maryland but grew up in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

He served five years as Deputy Mayor of New York City and 17 years as President of Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, which was the longest such tenure in the Center's history. During Leventhal's career, he served at the highest levels for four New York City mayors, as City Hall chief of staff for Mayor John V. Lindsay, deputy mayor for Ed Koch and transition chairman for both mayors David Dinkins and Michael Bloomberg. At Lincoln Center, he oversaw a major expansion of Lincoln Center programming, creation of two additional Lincoln Center constituent organizations, construction of the first new campus building since the center was created and laying the foundation for Lincoln Center's, $1.2 billion redevelopment program. Early life Leventhal was born in New York City. He grew up in Brooklyn before moving to Forest Hills, Queens at the age of ten. His father worked as a sales executive, who according to Leventhal was an exceedingly hard worker. His mother was a homemaker during Leventhal's youth. During his teenage years, she died of cancer while he was a high school senior. He was fond of music from a young age, took piano lessons and taught himself to play the guitar. Leventhal recited in an interview he didn't enjoy his piano lessons as he felt they were very formal. Years later, Leventhal would revive his love for the piano, playing mainly in private. Despite a love for music, Leventhal initially pursued an education in the sciences. He attended Cornell University for a year, before deciding to go down a different educational path. Returning to New York City, he studied locally at Queens College, where he received a BA in public affairs; following graduation, Leventhal received a law degree from Columbia Law School, where he was Editor in Chief of the Columbia Law Review. Career =Government career= Leventhal's career in government began in 1967, when he worked at The Pentagon in the office of the General Counsel of the Air Force. He remained in Washington to work as an assistant to the executive director of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which had recently been established by the civil rights act in 1964. In 1969, he moved back to New York City to work for the administration of Mayor John V. Lindsay as fiscal director of the human resources administration, then moving to the mayors office to become assistant to the mayor and then City Hall Chief of Staff. In 1972, Lindsay appointed Leventhal, then 29, as Commissioner of Rent and Housing Maintenance. After serving briefly in 1973-74 as chief counsel to the US Senate subcommittee on administrative practice and procedure, chaired by Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Leventhal practiced law in New York City for four years, becoming a partner at a law firm, Poletti Frieden Prashker Feldman and Gartner before returning to city government in 1978, when newly elected Mayor Edward Koch appointed him Commissioner of Housing Preservation and Development. In August 1979, Mayor Koch implemented a major reorganization of the City Hall staff in a move whose scope \\"stunned\\" City Hall observers and appointed Leventhal Deputy Mayor of Operations, with all city commissioners reporting to Leventhal; previously all commissioners had reported directly to Mayor Koch. As deputy mayor, Leventhal was responsible for overseeing the day-to-day operations of City government, including implementing a government-wide productivity program. Included among the productivity initiatives overseen by Leventhal was the first New York City \\"gain-sharing\\" program where, in return for reduced manning requirements, sanitation workers performing more work shared in the budgetary savings in the form of incremental pay. Leventhal also suggested to Mayor Koch that the city move to a GAAP balanced budget a year before the State law required, a move widely praised in the press and the financial community and which led to the restoration of the city's investment-grade rating. After leaving his post in 1984, to assume the position of President of Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, Leventhal was the subject of New York Times editorial, which noted that Mayor Koch had run on the slogan \\"why not try competence\\" stating that Leventhal \\"supplied much of it\\" providing \\"invaluable services for his community\\" and \\"departs City Hall with its gratitude.\\" Similar comments were also made in the New York Post, stating he performed his job with \\"surpassing style and skill.\\" =President of Lincoln Center= Leventhal's hiring as president of Lincoln Center was recommended to its board by Chairman Martin E. Segal, a cultural leader of New York City over many decades. Together with Segal and his successors - George Weissman, former CEO of Philip Morris and operatic superstar Beverly Sills - Leventhal focused on overseeing a significant expansion of Lincoln Center's programming activities including the establishment of a new jazz program, hiring the then-26 year-old trumpet virtuoso Wynton Marsalis as its artistic leader, eventually culminating in the creation of a permanent constituent organization, Jazz at Lincoln Center; launched the Lincoln Center Festival, an eclectic gathering of cutting edge performances from around the world; created Lincoln Center's American Songbook series, a tribute to the golden days of American popular music; and started Midsummer Night Swing, a populist informal program of dancing open to the public on Lincoln Center's central plaza. While these initiatIves were generally well received, they occasionally elicited criticism from Lincoln Center constituents that Lincoln Center‚Äôs expansive programming was competing with their own programmng and fundraising efforts. [15]. Nevertheless, during his tenure, there was also unprecedented cooperation in programming among Lincoln Center and its constituents, most evident in the Mozart Bicentennial celebration of 1991/1992, in which all constituents joined in performing all of Mozart's compositions. Leventhal also supervised the construction of the Samuel P. and David Rose building, the first new building since Lincoln Center's creation which, among things, included the first dormitory facilities for the Juilliard School and the School of American Ballet (which had become the first new Lincoln Center constituent company since its founding); a year- round performance facility for the Film Society of Lincoln Center; and rehearsal, studio and office space for Lincoln Center and its constituent companies. Together with Chairman Beverly Sills, Leventhal launched what would become a $1.2 billion Lincoln Center redevelopment program, securing a $250 million grant from New York City to start the project. He and Sills were also instrumental in receiving New York City's commitment to have the developer of the future Time Warner Center include provisions in his plan for a new Lincoln Center performance space. Later career In March 2000, Leventhal announced that he would be leaving his position as President of Lincoln Center by the end of the year. Leventhal admitted that he looked forward to spending more time at his home in Connecticut, playing tennis, and resuming piano lessons. However, in November 2001, the surprise winner of the 2001 New York City election, Michael Bloomberg, asked Leventhal to chair his transition committee, as Leventhal had previously done in 1989 for former Mayor David Dinkins. Leventhal stayed on to chair Bloomberg's appointments committee for the next 12 years, recommending candidates to fill city commissionerships and deputy mayor positions. Leventhal also became active in his new home in New York State's Suffolk County, serving on a fiscal task force appointed by the county executive, as well as a member of the budget and finance committee of the town of Southampton. In April 2020, the Suffolk County Executive appointed Leventhal to a four member COVID-19 Task Force, charged with the responsibility of advising the County on the financial impact of the coronavirus pandemic and ways to ameliorate its negative effects on the County‚Äôs economy. (Robinson, Pam ‚ÄúBellone Picks Fiscal Impact Task Force‚Äò‚Äô Huntington Now, April 16, 2020). In 2017, Leventhal became Board president of Palm Beach Opera. Since 1989 onwards, Leventhal has served as a director of equity, fixed income and money market funds managed by BNY Mellon and Dreyfus. From 2003 to 2020, Leventhal served as a Director of Movado Group Inc. where he was chairman of the nominating and corporate governance committee. Other pro bono governmental positions held by Leventhal: In 1993, New York Governor Mario Cuomo appointed Leventhal to be a member of the New York State Commission on Constitutional Revision. [Benjamin, Gerald, editor, ‚ÄúNew York State Constitution‚Äú March, 1994]. In 1997, Leventhal was nominated by President Clinton and confirmed by the US Senate for a five-year term on the National Council on the Arts. In 2007, Mayor Michael Bloomberg nominated and the New York City Council confirmed Leventhal's five-year term on the NY City Planning Commission.

Ebeid's cabinet claimed that Warraq and Dahab did not exist prior to the construction of the Aswan Dam. The islanders protested against the 2001 decree and took legal action against the government, winning their case in 2002. In May 2017, Egyptian president Abdel Fattah el-Sisi announced a campaign for the state to recover state-owned land that was illegally occupied. In July, a rumour circulated that residents' houses on Warraq Island would be demolished and replaced by investment projects. Member of Parliament (MP) for Warraq Island Ahmed Youssef stated that 700 \\"enroachments\\" and 160 squatted homes were to be removed. Another Warraq Island MP, Mahmoud el-Saeedy, stated that insufficient communication between residents and security forces occurred. On 16 July 2017, security forces and construction equipment appeared on Warraq Island. Security forces and residents fought, with the death of a 23-year old, 24 injuries and 9 arrests. Warraq Island resident Mohamed Arafa stated that during the conflict on 16 July, \\"furnished houses were demolished and some residents were kicked out of their homes. During the 16 July demolition, resident Heba Nagaa Otmorsi's house was demolished without warning while she was at work on the mainland. The demolition crews and security forces arrived early in the morning when \\"most families\\" were asleep. As a result of the protests by the islanders, only 9 buildings were demolished. The Guardian reported on a 2010 plan to transform Warraq Island into \\"'Horus Island', complete with glossy towers, wide boulevards and a marina\\" and a 2013 proposal that included \\"a glass skyscraper, a glistening glass pyramid, and manicured riverside walkways\\" for restructuring the island. The plans retained in 2017 included the construction of a bridge, which The Guardian suggested was the first step in a similar plan for a major transformation of the whole island.

He holds the rank of admiral, and retired in 2016 after serving as First Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Navy. Tatarinov's service began with the Soviet Navy, after studying at and graduating from the . He entered service with the Baltic Fleet, rising through the ranks to his own commands by 1980. He then went on to several staff appointments, at first with the Baltic Fleet, and then with the Black Sea Fleet, where he served as chief of staff and was promoted to vice-admiral. He was tipped to take command of the fleet in 2002, but was passed over in favour of Vladimir Masorin. When Masorin was appointed to a different post in 2005, Tatarinov took his post as commander of the Black Sea Fleet. His work required considerable diplomatic skill, as he held meetings and negotiations with NATO officials, and representatives of the Ukraianian forces over shared access to Black Sea naval facilities. On 20 July 2007 Tatarinov was appointed Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Navy, and then chief of staff and First Deputy Commander-in- Chief in 2009, and served in this post for several years. Despite criticism over the navy's response to the 2010 Russian wildfires, Tatarinov played a key role in naval reforms, and trials of the RSM-56 Bulava ballistic missile. He was given special dispensation to continue in service beyond the usual mandatory retirement age of 60, and instead retired at 65. He had received several honours and awards over his period of service. Early career The Kashin-class destroyer Obraztsovy, Tatarinov's command from 1980. Tatarinov was born on 25 October 1950 in Olovyanninsky District, Chita Oblast, then part of the Russian SFSR of the Soviet Union. He completed his high school studies in 1967, and went to study at the , graduating in 1972. He began his active service with the Baltic Fleet, acting as head of one of the rear base's mine- torpedo armaments laboratory between 1972 and 1973. In 1973 he was appointed commander of an anti-aircraft battery, and in 1976 took command of the artillery section of the Kashin-class destroyer Slavny. From 1977 to 1979 Tatarinov was the senior assistant to the commander of the Krivak-class frigate Bodryy, followed by a post as senior assistant to the commander of Bodryys sister ship Neukrotimyy. He took the , graduating in 1980, and was appointed commander of the Kashin-class destroyer Obraztsovy. Tatarinov graduated with honours from the Naval Academy in 1988 and was appointed chief of staff of an anti-submarine brigade of the Baltic Fleet, becoming the brigade's commander in 1990. In 1994 he became the chief of staff and first deputy commander of the Baltic Naval Base, and then in April 1996, he was appointed the base's commander of the Baltic Naval Base. On 22 September 1997 Tatarinov was appointed chief of staff of the Black Sea Fleet, and was promoted to vice-admiral on 23 February 1999. Tatarinov undertook further study at the Military Academy of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Russia, graduating in 2002. Following the resignation of the fleet's commander, Admiral , in October that year, there was media speculation that Tatarinov would be appointed to succeed him. Instead Vice-Admiral Vladimir Masorin, the commander of the Caspian Flotilla, was appointed as the fleet's commander, supposedly on the pretext of Tatarinov's \\"excessive exactingness and rigidity as leader\\". Black Sea command and staff posts Ships of the Black Sea Fleet in 2005, during Tatarinov's tenure as fleet commander On 15 February 2005 Masorin was appointed Chief of the Main Naval Staff, with Tatarinov assigned to fill his position as commander of the Black Sea Fleet. In his new role Tatarinov worked with NATO representatives in July 2005 to determine the role of Russian warships in Operation Active Endeavour, an anti- terrorist operation in the Mediterranean. On 12 December 2005 Tatarinov was promoted to admiral. In January 2006 Tatarinov led a deputation of officers from the fleet's base in Sevastopol to Yalta to negotiate with Ukrainian officials over the status of a disputed lighthouse. On 20 July 2007 he was appointed deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Navy, and on 7 July 2009 was advanced to Chief of staff and First Deputy Commander of the Navy. After naval installations were damaged during the 2010 Russian wildfires, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev sacked several senior naval officials, and warned both Tatarinov and Navy Commander-in-Chief Vladimir Vysotskiy over their \\"incomplete professional responsibility\\". In October 2011 he met with NATO Supreme Allied Commander Europe Admiral James G. Stavridis to discuss joint anti-piracy measures, and cooperation with Operation Active Endeavour. In October 2010 Dmitry Medvedev took the step of extending Tatarinov's time in service by another year. On 30 January 2012 it was extended by another four years, meaning Tatarinov would retire at the age of 65, rather than the usual mandatory retirement age of 60. This was part of several extensions granted to important figures connected to Russian military reform. Tatarinov was noted as playing a key role in the trials of the RSM-56 Bulava ballistic missile. Awards and honours Over his career Tatarinov has been awarded the Order of Military Merit, the Order of Naval Merit and the Order \\"For Service to the Homeland in the Armed Forces of the USSR\\" Third Class. On 10 November 2005 he was awarded the Order of Saint Righteous Grand Duke Dmitry Donskoy Second Class by Patriarch Alexy II of Moscow, for his \\"hard work on the revival and establishment of the original spiritual traditions of the Russian military in the Russian Navy\\". Tatarinov is married, with two children, a daughter and son.

AC Stark Shift by optical lattice The laser field in an optical lattice induces an electric dipole moment in the atoms to exert forces on them and hence confine them. However, the difference in polarizabilities of the atomic states leads to an AC Stark shift in the transition frequency between the two states, a shift that is dependent on the laser's optical intensity at the particular atom's location in the lattice. When it comes to precise measurements of transition frequency such as atomic clocks, the temporal fluctuations of the laser's optical intensity would then deteriorate the clock accuracy. Furthermore, due to the spatial variation of laser intensity in the lattice, the atom's motion within the lattice would also be coupled into the uncertainty of the internal transition frequency of the atom.  Polarizability depends on wavelength  Despite having different function forms, the polarizabilities of two atomic states do have a dependency on the wavelength of the laser field. In some cases, it is then possible to find a particular wavelength at which the two atomic states happen to have exactly the same polarizability. This particular wavelength, where the ac- stark shift vanishes for the transition frequency, is called the magic wavelength; and the frequency that corresponds to this wavelength is called the magic frequency. This idea was first introduced by Hidetoshi Katori's calculation in 2003, and then experimentally achieved by Katori's group in 2005.

The film premiered at the 2005 Guadalajara International Film Festival. It was the country's submission to the Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film in 2005, but was disqualified.  Synopsis  Julio Verne, writer and adventurer, becomes bored with his life and decides to sail down the Amazon. He arrives in South America at the Venezuelan coast, meeting Italian geographer Conde Ermanno Stradelli; Stradelli has a mission from Rome to map the Orinoco. Verne decides to join him, and they gain another late addition: Juan de Kermor. Through the journey, Verne and Stradelli discover that Juan is actually a woman, Juana, who has been searching for a way to travel down the Orinoco looking for her father.  Cast  * Marco Villarubia as Julio Verne * Kristin Pardo as Juana de Kermor * Ronnie Nordenflycht as Conde Stradelli * Elba Escobar as Honorine Verne * Julio Bustamante as Coronel Kermor  Production  The screenplay was written by Gustavo Michelena, Rafael Arraiz and Alfredo Anzola, based on the Verne story The Mighty Orinoco. The film combines Verne's story, about the character Jeanne de Kermor, with a fictionalized framing narrative of the real Vernes and Count Stradelli being part of the journey.  Oscars selection  The film was chosen as Venezuela's 2005 entry for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. However, incomplete paperwork led to the entry being disqualified. At the time of its selection, the choice of the CNAC was controversial; the film Secuestro Express by Jonathan Jakubowicz was also eligible for nomination and was much more successful both nationally and internationally. Jakubowicz criticized the choice not to nominate his film, which is about kidnapping and gangs in Venezuela, saying that it was overtly political because his film was artistically superior. Anzola did not comment on the artistic quality of either film, but said that Jakubowicz, a relative newcomer to the industry at the time, was upset because he wanted his first feature film to receive a nomination and that he would be calmer with more experience. Jakubowicz was forced to leave Venezuela because of Secuestro Express after receiving threats from then-President Hugo Ch√°vez. Ultimately, no submission was accepted from Venezuela in 2005.
